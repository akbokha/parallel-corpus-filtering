Munich 18@@ 56 : four maps that change your view of the city
an Ir@@ ren @-@ Anst@@ alt , where yo@@ ung@@ sters meet today .
a pit chapel , where it is du@@ g for the S @-@ Bahn tunnel .
small gar@@ den@@ ers manage the former cause of peasants .
the oldest official ticket Munich promotes exciting stories to days .
it is anno@@ ying when maps are not up @-@ to @-@ date .
everybody knows everybody who had to wake up because the car @-@ Nav@@ i showed a green me@@ adow instead of a b@@ ypass road .
the historical maps of the digital Bavaria At@@ las@@ es , an offer of the Ge@@ op@@ ort@@ as of the State Government , are anything but up @-@ to @-@ date - yet very reve@@ aling .
especially if you compare them with current online maps .
then it becomes clear how cities and municipalities in the area of the Munich Merk@@ ur have changed since the 19th century .
the digital Bavaria @-@ Atlas is a pat@@ ch@@ work that one does not recognize as such .
in the large picture postcard for cities and municipalities detailed maps , so @-@ called documents , were incorporated .
according to the Bay@@ er@@ ical surv@@ ey@@ ing administration between 18@@ 10 and 1864 , they emerged from the first surv@@ ey@@ ing of Bavaria .
your client : Napoleon .
the French military leader occupied Bavaria since spring 1800 during the Second Co@@ alition War with Austria .
Napoleon wanted an overview of the occupied country and gave a top@@ ographic recording of Bavaria in order - of course for military purposes .
even if the French troops were finally pulled off with the peace of Lun@@ é@@ ville from 9 February 18@@ 01 : it was the neigh@@ bors who created the idea of a surface @-@ covering Bavaria card .
Kur@@ für@@ st Max IV . Joseph moved forward the project , founded the &quot; Top@@ ographic Bureau &quot; - and there@@ with the Bavarian Department of Meas@@ u@@ rement .
the certificate of origin for Munich dates from 18@@ 56 and is found like any other on the website of the Bay@@ erische Landes@@ bibliothek .
the comparison of former / Today is the most impressive in the example of the state capital .
the city has expanded in all directions and has grown together .
an example of this is sub@@ send@@ ling that still appears relatively isolated in the map of 18@@ 56 .
S@@ end@@ ling was established 21 years after the map was created , i.e. in 1877 , as the Munich district .
today , Unter@@ send@@ ling is located in the middle of the city .
the houses of Unter@@ send@@ ling are concentrated around 18@@ 56 along today &apos;s Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser@@ straße , which was named after Georg Sebastian Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser in 1878 , a leader of the u@@ prising of the Bavarian farmers against Austria in 17@@ 05 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; where today the West@@ park is , you see nothing but fields - at first sight : there is a smaller map with do@@ zens of lines and numbers : hand@@ written @-@ numbered hall@@ marks from the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; primitive take @-@ up &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from which the basic income was derived . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; small plots today show no farmers more - but small gar@@ den@@ ers of the plant &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Land in Sun &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a large green area is located north of Lower send@@ ling .
Ther@@ esi@@ en@@ wi@@ ese , since 18@@ 10 of the Oktober@@ fest , was actually a me@@ adow in the 19th century - and no concrete desert .
on the other side of the Is@@ ar , the historical map provides an insight into the history of psychiat@@ ric medicine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the area of today &apos;s district , Au @-@ Hai@@ d@@ hausen , one reads not only the street name &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the Gast@@ ei@@ g &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or from the hill &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Auf der Lü@@ fte &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - but also in big letters &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ir@@ ren Anst@@ alt &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
yes , here at Au@@ er@@ feld@@ straße one once opened people with del@@ usions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there was in 18@@ 58 / 59 the Münchner Kreis @-@ Ir@@ ren@@ anstalt &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Auf der Au@@ er Lü@@ fte &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
from 1872 Dr. Bernhard von Gu@@ dden headed the institution - the psychiat@@ rist , which is brought in connection with the death of King Ludwig II .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he was advanced for his time and ended for example the chains of so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ir@@ ren . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , he has forbidden the personnel to apply violence against the in@@ mates , &quot; says Hermann Wilhelm , head of the Museum of Hai@@ d@@ hausen , who has occupied himself for an exhibition with the institution .
for 280 patients it was first place , later on 500 places was expanded .
at some point , this capacity was no longer sufficient - the reason for the construction of the Kreis@@ ir@@ ren@@ anstalt in Haar 1905 .
since 2006 the Is@@ ar @-@ Amp@@ er @-@ Klin@@ ikum München @-@ Ost , one of the biggest psychiat@@ ries in Germany , has been there since 2006 .
in the area of the former Au@@ er Anst@@ alt , yo@@ ung@@ sters meet in the Sal@@ esi@@ an@@ um in Munich .
the Order acquired the building complex in 1920 and converted it into a youth hostel with educational establishments .
west lies the football field of the T@@ SV München Ost , east of residential buildings from the 1980s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in 2015 the children &apos;s house &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Casa Don Bos@@ co &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was built in an architectural style similar to the original &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Casa Don Bos@@ co &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which had been destroyed during World War II by bom@@ bing attacks . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Marien@@ platz was listed in 18@@ 56 as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; main place &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the Kauf@@ inger Street name was called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kauf@@ inger G@@ asse &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a decisive change brought the Second World War also in the heart of Munich .
the Al@@ lied bom@@ bs outlined many holes in the city center in December 1944 .
a big one remained until today - at the Marien@@ hof .
the English Institute , small business houses , and a chapel chapel dating back to the Middle Ages , once stood at the Marien@@ hof , where these days were prec@@ eded and on April 5 , 2017 the ground@@ breaking ceremony for the second S @-@ Bahn regular route took place .
with the slider , the old Munich @-@ card can be compared with the a@@ erial view of today - and fill the hole in the Marien@@ hof .
Om@@ bud@@ s@@ man publ@@ ishes travel warning for Mis@@ sour@@ i
the National Association for the Promotion of Col@@ ors has issued a warning for coloured people who travel to Mis@@ sour@@ i because of discrimin@@ atory policies and rac@@ ist attacks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the NA@@ AC@@ P Travel Advisory for the Federal State of Mis@@ sour@@ i , which will enter into force by August 28 , 2017 , calls for international travelers , visitors and Mis@@ sour@@ i to take special attention in traveling through the state , as a number of question@@ able , r@@ acial @-@ based inci@@ dents occur in recent times throughout the country and be noted here , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the Group &apos;s position . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a recently adopted law of Mis@@ sour@@ i , which makes it harder for people to gain discrimination , as well as the prosec@@ ution authorities of the state , which disp@@ rop@@ or@@ tion@@ ately aim on minorities , promp@@ ted the group to issue the travel warning , said the NA@@ AC@@ P .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they have violations of civil rights that happen to people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they are stopped because of their skin colour , they are beaten or killed , &quot; said the President of Mis@@ sour@@ i NA@@ AC@@ P , Rod Chapel , Kan@@ sas City Star .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we hear complaints in such a frequency that we have not yet heard . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is the first such warning that the organization has issued for a state in the United States .
the group c@@ ited inci@@ dents like rac@@ ist off@@ ences against black students at the University of Mis@@ sour@@ i and the death of T@@ ory S@@ anders , 28 , a black man from Tenn@@ es@@ see .
S@@ anders died under question@@ able circumstances at the beginning of the year , after he had no more fuel during the journey and was taken cust@@ ody by the Mis@@ sour@@ i police without being accused of a crime .
the Council also points to a recent report by the Mis@@ sour@@ i General Council , shown that black drivers in the state will be 75 percent more common than white .
&quot; the recommendation is that people are aware and inform their families , friends and staff about what could happen in Mis@@ sour@@ i , &quot; said Chapel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people need to be willing to bring any che@@ wing money or letting relatives know that they travel through the state . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mis@@ sour@@ i signed up to 100 hate crimes in 2015 , according to the latest figures from the F@@ BI &apos;s Hass@@ ver@@ bre@@ chens @-@ Reports Programme , which classi@@ fies the state in terms of the number of injuries to the 16th rank of the country .
the travel warning is also an answer to a new Mis@@ sour@@ i law that would make it harder to acc@@ use a company for housing or employment discrimination .
earlier , the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union ( AC@@ L@@ U ) issued travel war@@ nings for Texas and Arizona , after the States had passed immigration laws to arrest local law enforcement agencies to arrest people for immigration reasons , which will contribute to further r@@ acial regulation .
travel war@@ nings are usually issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for other countries , but recently , interest groups have used the measure as a response to certain laws and trends within the US .
Wei@@ dez@@ aun@@ projekt is elementary
the Fischer@@ bacher Wei@@ dez@@ au@@ n project is a success project and will continue in the coming year .
the C@@ DU Par@@ li@@ ament@@ ary Con@@ gres@@ s@@ men Peter Weiß and K@@ ord@@ ula Kov@@ ac have acquired a picture on the spot .
at the Haupt@@ grab@@ en@@ hof of the family Schwen@@ de@@ mann , representatives of the Fischer@@ bacher C@@ DU local association met with mayor Thomas Schneider and the two MEPs .
Markus Schwen@@ de@@ mann initially granted insights into his farm in which he cultivated 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest , providing 40 dairy cows and as many young animals and houses in five apartments Feri@@ eng@@ ä@@ ste .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Black Forest Mil@@ k &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is for him the alternative marketing path for the milk of his cows , so Schwen@@ de@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the table of the Feri@@ eng@@ ä@@ ste comes only Regi@@ on@@ ales .
&quot; &quot; &quot; since he is also the BL@@ HV @-@ chair of Fischer@@ bach , he called the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ele@@ mentary Import@@ ant &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; project as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; element@@ ar important &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I cannot prosp@@ er on such steep surfaces .
the green area care for a lot of work , many things must be handled with the sense of the motor sense .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have here to fight with the conditions and the top@@ ography , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Schwen@@ de@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2003 , he took over the el@@ ter@@ nal operation and used this without chemical plant protection and fertilizer , even if he does not lead a bio @-@ operation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for Mayor Thomas Schneider , it was clear : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Commun@@ e recognised the importance of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wei@@ dez@@ aun@@ projekt &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and is happy about the leader promotion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the cost of 3000 to 4000 euros per hect@@ are the farmers would have to be supported .
it is hoped that the so@@ lic@@ itation of the surfaces could be extended for quite a while .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the greatest treasure we have is the people working in agriculture and thinking about how they continue their operations , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Mayor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; farmers often stand in criticism because of the promotion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
over the course of the course , a total of 25 plots were f@@ enced by eleven participants in 2013 .
the total surface area amounts to 40 hectares , which are not allowed to be restricted by at least 2023 .
from the total cost of 71 500 euros , half were promoted through leader , a quarter contributed to the community of Fischer@@ bach .
thus , the farmers remained 12 610 euros , which they had to invest in 16.@@ 2 kilometers of course .
&quot; the great advantage is the lon@@ ge@@ vity of the f@@ ences , &quot; explained Schwen@@ de@@ mann .
&quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ ord@@ ula Kov@@ ac said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you do a really good job , without farmers and farmers &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; also for Peter Weiß stand firm , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Here are the best food produced . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ art landscape ( L@@ PR ) Baden @-@ Württemberg enables the state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ art promotion of f@@ ences .
the aim is to open the Black Forest .
the prerequisite is the presence of a conveyor for the L@@ PR .
in addition , the f@@ enced surface should not be s@@ lugg@@ ish ( slope incl@@ ination above 35 percent ) and must therefore be threatened by the so@@ lic@@ itation .
for the 2018 Fischer@@ bacher Wei@@ dez@@ aun@@ projekt 2018 , the application of eight participants with 24 par@@ c@@ els , which would like to build just under 16 kilometres of fence .
the total surface area corresponds to 35 hectares , the calculated costs are more than 112 000 euros .
is nothing sacred anymore ?
now the White House of Tr@@ ump occupies the Statue of Liberty
the saf@@ est sign of a regime change is when they begin to attack the statues .
the Americans appreciate these as well as any other - hence the thou@@ ght@@ ful fall of Sadd@@ am Hussein at the Fir@@ on Square in Bag@@ h@@ dad in 2003 .
Stephen Miller , one of the key ide@@ ologists of the Tr@@ ump regime , certainly knew what he did when he took a symbolic ax@@ e in a heated argument with Jim A@@ co@@ sta of CN@@ N about the presi@@ dents to dra@@ st@@ ically restri@@ ct legal immigration to the Statue of Liberty .
to stay fair , Miller did not handle the statue itself .
a hor@@ de of boat owners and Liberty be@@ eke@@ epers would have liked it if he had done it .
but he took their meaning , and in particular the significance that it was attributed to when the famous poem by Emma Laz@@ arus 1903 , 17 years after completion of the monument , was added to his base .
as Miller A@@ co@@ sta imp@@ lied : &quot; I don &apos;t want to go into a complete thing about history , but the Statue of Liberty is ... a symbol of American freedom that illumin@@ ates the world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the poem by which you refer to , which was added later and is not part of the original Statue of Liberty . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Miller is fac@@ tual right , but as he himself formulated it , it is not really about history .
it is about the contemporary response to the angry words of Laz@@ arus , the only ones in which a state does not only invite any old immigrants , but the p@@ oo@@ rest of the poor : &quot; your troub@@ les , your poor , and your oppressed masses , who lon@@ ged to breathe freely , / the falling of your rich co@@ asts . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; there was never a time when the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; poor waste &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was better seen on our screens . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Miller was not engaged in literary criticism - he made it clear that these people are not welcome in the USA .
this conflict owing to the importance of a statue is part of a broader political and cultural dispute : it is indeed a conflict around the importance of America .
Laz@@ arus - and her friends who used to place their words after their death at the base - knew very well that they performed a highly political action .
the sculpture was to show the connections between French and American re@@ public@@ anism by portr@@ aying the female em@@ bodi@@ ment of freedom in a worn @-@ out classical depic@@ tion .
Laz@@ arus changed this meaning : in her poem the female figure is no longer abstract - she has received a voice .
and she gives herself a very different name : mother of the Ex@@ ile .
the link between the poem and the image is a brilliant femin@@ ist coup and a devast@@ ating attack on American N@@ ati@@ vis@@ m .
and just like Laz@@ arus changed the meaning of the statue , the people from the right wing wanted to change it for a long time .
the great writer R@@ ush Lim@@ bau@@ gh , a kind of John the Baptist for the coming of Tr@@ ump , ar@@ gues 2010 that the Statue of Liberty is no one drawer but rather an early Neo@@ conserv@@ atives that brings the American flame to the um@@ ber@@ ed world : &quot; Lady Liberty moves forward .
it should bear the tor@@ ch of freedom from the United States into the rest of the world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the tor@@ ch should not en@@ ligh@@ ten the way to the United States . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Lim@@ bau@@ gh is quite unusual here .
the importance of the statue is entirely and even a question of the stand@@ point of perception .
the great creative act of Laz@@ arus was to see her as she was seen by the exhau@@ st@@ ive but hop@@ eful people after long and often terrible journeys to the de@@ cks of ships .
it is the true sense of seeing the world from the perspective of people who seek refuge and a chance to improve their lives .
her statue speaks to them the words of hope and the welcome they have to hear .
and this is of course not the perspective that Miller and Tr@@ ump will ever recognize .
their tor@@ ch shall not en@@ ligh@@ ten the way , but the hatred which is their only source of power .
world Cup 2017 : N@@ eil Black pra@@ ises Scot@@ t@@ ish members of the team of Great Britain
Ei@@ li@@ d@@ h Do@@ yle ev@@ okes a time when only two Sc@@ ots belong to the UK team
&quot; &quot; &quot; the performance director of the United Kingdom &apos;s Ath@@ le@@ tics , N@@ eil Black , says that the 16 @-@ member Scot@@ t@@ ish cont@@ ingent in the world championship header &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; will make a massive contribution to the team . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a record number of Scot@@ t@@ ish athletes was chosen for London in 2017 , which starts on Friday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; black believes that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; something special develops in Scotland &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the athle@@ tics of the United Kingdom must learn something from it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we welcome it and we try to understand it and we will continue it until we find it out , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Black . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I talk to people at the Scot@@ t@@ ish Institute of Sport and they think it has something to do with what they have done . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Scot@@ t@@ ish athletes think it has something to do with what they have done .
British Ath@@ le@@ tics : it has something to do with what they have done .
and also with the type on the corner .
whatever the combination of circumstances is , it is absolutely brilliant . &quot;
several of the Scot@@ t@@ ish athletes are Med@@ a@@ illen candidates , including Laura Mu@@ ir and Andrew But@@ chart , who compete against Sir Mo Far@@ ah on the 5,000 m track , while Ei@@ li@@ d@@ h Do@@ yle was elected by the team to team captain .
&quot; Ei@@ li@@ d@@ h is rather modest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; her captain &apos;s speech was incredible , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Black . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; a number of athletes , whether they were Scot@@ t@@ ish or wherever they live or train , went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motivated .
the passion and the real feeling that Ei@@ li@@ d@@ h came naturally , were great . &quot;
the Com@@ mon@@ wealth Silver med@@ al winner , who will compete in their fifth world champion@@ ships at the 400 m hur@@ d@@ les , says that it is &quot; unbelie@@ vable &quot; that 16 Sc@@ ots are in the British team .
Scotland &apos;s so far best total of athletes at the World Championship was seven , which were achieved in 1983 and 2015 .
the middle @-@ distance runner Mu@@ ir leads on this road and has set up five British and two European records last year .
it will take part in the 1,500 m and 5,000 m of runs .
Chris O &apos;@@ H@@ are , who runs 1,500 m , is another Scot@@ s@@ man to watch the victory at the British Team Tri@@ als and Anni@@ versary Games .
Do@@ yle is remin@@ is@@ cent of her first world champion@@ ships , when the only other Scot@@ s@@ man was in the Lee Mc@@ Con@@ nell team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the team captain says that they are &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hu@@ gely proud &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that many of their country@@ men are not only part of the team , but in some cases also with the med@@ als and the fin@@ als . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the special thing about being team captain is that it was chosen by the other members of the team , but knowing that my team @-@ mates voted for me and chose me , makes it something very special for me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; obviously I am very proud of all the Sc@@ ots that belong to the team .
it just shows how far we came .
and they are here as well @-@ established athletes , athletes who want to climb on Po@@ di@@ en .
what is my speech as a captain ?
yes , I think it went well .
I only pointed out that we are very happy in this situation as we have a home world championship .
so it is really important to put on this home support and to benefit from the fact that we are back at the Olympiastadion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I get a second chance to go out there and compete and it will simply be such a great atmosphere out there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
block@@ ade Crit@@ ic@@ ism on Facebook : don &apos;t worry about a public office if you cannot toler@@ ate vot@@ ers
the father of our country knew something of bad press .
the Americans loved George Washington , but it did not take long until the newspapers struck him because of everything , from domestic politics to his political principles .
he imp@@ lied with criticism .
but he has not sil@@ enced his critics .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for in 17@@ 83 , Washington said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; freedom of speech can be taken away - and , stup@@ id and mu@@ te we are led like sheep to the s@@ laughter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this brings me to Mary@@ land to Gover@@ nor Lar@@ ry H@@ og@@ an , who must work to be more like Washington .
Ho@@ gans collabor@@ ators have blocked and deleted posts of at least 450 people who have expressed their opinion on their official Facebook page .
and the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union def@@ ended it this week .
the Gover@@ nor &apos;s staff dism@@ is@@ sed the law@@ suit as fri@@ vol@@ ous , and the online comment was full of a counter @-@ reaction with &quot; Na , and ? . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s just Facebook , &quot; many people said .
but it is important .
and it is especially important when it is a type like H@@ og@@ an .
this is a Republi@@ can governor in an overwhelming democratic state , which is amaz@@ ingly popular .
he has the second highest consent of the 50 govern@@ ors of the nation .
H@@ og@@ an is not a reactionary H@@ itz@@ head .
he has shown a firm hand in the leadership of his state and strict adher@@ ence to the principles .
he was also very cle@@ ver@@ ly to use Facebook as a primary means to connect with his vot@@ ers and to debate his ha@@ iry head after chemotherapy on his side .
therefore the block@@ age of persons who come to the Gover@@ nor &apos;s side - is a public forum that is designated as officially and by employees who are paid with public tax dollars - unnecessary and ultimately dangerous .
in an interview with The Washington Post , Ho@@ gans answered Amel@@ ia Ch@@ asse the governor &apos;s actions and argu@@ ed that the block@@ age of comments is nothing more than moder@@ ation .
but it is too easy to use the image of cast@@ ors or br@@ aces or hate @-@ filled people who vibr@@ ate online the wh@@ ip .
the post was talking to some of the real people blocked by H@@ og@@ an .
and these are only real people speaking with their elected leaders : a teacher , an entrepren@@ eur , and a priest , no role .
they all said their comments were resp@@ ect@@ ful , thou@@ ght@@ ful and not prof@@ ane .
the priest c@@ ited the Bible in his post and appe@@ aled to Ho@@ gans Catholic faith .
attor@@ ney Lak@@ sh@@ mi Sar@@ ma Ram@@ ani of Bo@@ wie , M@@ d . , was not h@@ ated , but she asked for hate crimes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I polit@@ ely commented that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to hate crimes and other news , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wrote in the commentary section of the news agency &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Post . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t appreciate this idea if a number of people take a position on the same issue , then they are considered by some rather than a so @-@ called collective employment and not recognized as a large group of affected citizens . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; what the Gover@@ nor &apos;s employees referred to as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concentrated spam attack &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would probably call &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; inter@@ cession . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Facebook era makes it easy to crop a message by simply blocking a cr@@ itic or del@@ eting a negative comment .
it is much cleaner than in earlier times when one had done the same thing that employees were sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical edit@@ orials and to arrest or arrest prot@@ esters and to silence .
but this is exactly what happens digit@@ ally .
H@@ og@@ an is not the first public official to critic@@ ise Facebook and other social media .
President Tr@@ ump is filed by Twitter users blocked by his Twitter feed .
one of the first mil@@ estones in this issue fell last week in Virginia .
the Chairman of the Board of Super@@ vis@@ ors des Lou@@ dou@@ n County injured the First A@@ mend@@ ment , according to US District Ju@@ dge James C. C@@ ach@@ er@@ is in Alexand@@ ria , when they bann@@ ed a vot@@ er from their Facebook page .
and in K@@ ent@@ u@@ cky , governor Matt Be@@ vin ( R ) also received a visit from AC@@ L@@ U because of his use of Facebook and Twitter .
this should not be so difficult .
at the time of Washington , the time of affordable door@@ men had a similar effect as the Internet .
the number of papers varied between 17@@ 76 and 1800 , and anonymous correspon@@ ders put on his leadership .
and even then , Washington had anonymous tro@@ ll@@ s .
the people who used pseu@@ don@@ y@@ ms like &quot; Jur@@ ic@@ ola , &quot; &quot; Val@@ eri@@ us , &quot; &quot; Bel@@ is@@ arius &quot; and &quot; Por@@ ti@@ us , &quot; wrote all letters to newspapers that made Washington &apos;s decisions .
pet@@ itions that crit@@ ici@@ zed his point of view of the treaty of am@@ ity , trade and shipping with Britain were overwhel@@ med by the historical documents that were collected by the online papers of George Washington Project .
but he has not brought them to silence .
freedom of speech , dis@@ agreement and dis@@ courses belong to our nation .
and true leadership means accepting this .
Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty hopes for domestic comfort in the Renaissance Club
the former European no . 1 Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty will be hoping for domestic comfort over the next three days , as the Renaissance club in East Lo@@ th@@ ian organiz@@ es the 25th edition of the Scot@@ t@@ ish Senior Open .
the Nor@@ di@@ re , who led last year in the Ar@@ cher@@ field Links to the En@@ dr@@ unde , before he lost against Paul E@@ ales , is associated with the new venue and acts as a tournament ambassador on behalf of the association founder and CE@@ Os Jer@@ ry Sar@@ v@@ adi .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have seen how the Renaissance club was built , and we see how he achieved his fame with this event , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Raff@@ er@@ ty said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; players will see this course from its best side , it is in a great condition . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jer@@ ry did a great job when he set this place .
he is a fier@@ ce champion of this game and is proud of his performance here .
this is a great showcase for this course . &quot;
the English E@@ ales is looking forward to defending a championship for the first time , although he won the European Tour as well as the European Challenge Tour in his 32 @-@ year career .
&quot; that really feels special , &quot; said the player home in South@@ port .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I did not defend the Extre@@ mad@@ ura Open because it was taken out of the program in the year after I won them . &quot; &quot; &quot;
return to this part of the world is magical .
it is a wonderful place to play golf .
the memories of last year come back and it was something special for me and my wife Shar@@ on , last year to win here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was a really special time and one we will always appreciate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gary Or@@ r , who came to the European Senior Tour after his 50@@ th birthday this year , returns to the action on homeland .
this event will be the first Scot@@ t@@ ish Open in 2013 since Aber@@ de@@ en Asset Management Scot@@ t@@ ish Open .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it always means a bit more when you play at home , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Or@@ r , the man from Hel@@ ens@@ burgh . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; you want to do it well , but you also feel this extra pressure .
I really enjoyed playing again and I played a solid golf .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am happy about how it happened so far . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

less lung canc@@ ers due to passive smoking
in the past two decades fewer people have died because of passive smoking on lung cancer .
scientists from the University Hospital of Hamburg @-@ E@@ pp@@ endorf ( U@@ KE ) come to this conclusion in a study .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to our estimates , 167 lung cancer deaths are attributed to passive smoking per year , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said study manager Hei@@ ko Becher . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as a comparison , he drew up his own study on this topic from 1994 .
at that time there were more than 400 lung cancer deaths due to passive smoking per year in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the new investigation is published in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; International Journal of Public Health . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; house connections prove to be very complex &quot; &quot; &quot;
the construction works in the Vill@@ ingen street are in full swing and &quot; lie reasonably in time , &quot; says the director of the court Fred Hein@@ ze .
in the area of the house connections , the situation is more complicated than suspected , as there is a lot of hiding in the underground , which is not indicated in the plans .
the traffic , which repeat@@ ed@@ ely hin@@ ders the construction work , represents a big problem for the building tr@@ up@@ p of the company St@@ ump@@ p .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ignorance of drivers in front of red lights and barrier plates is already enormous , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reports Hein@@ ze . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the road is locked and only the buses were allowed to enter .
Angelo Car@@ uso , Mar@@ vin Kost@@ or@@ z and Tim Kost@@ or@@ z from the company St@@ ump@@ p have been busy working on the bridge for weeks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the hot days were already very exhau@@ sting . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but luck@@ ily we were supplied by our friend Fritz Matt with cool mineral water , &quot; says Mar@@ vin Kost@@ or@@ z .
poverty and death in the Indonesian Gold@@ land
if Bar@@ dina De@@ ge@@ i cooked dinner , she does not use a stove .
it even rarely uses a pot .
in her wooden house in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , the capital of the Pan@@ i@@ ai Re@@ gency in the troubled Indonesian province Pap@@ ua , the house@@ wife usually puts a sweet potato - locally called &quot; not@@ a &quot; - directly in the fireplace .
after half an hour the char@@ coal min@@ ol@@ le is taken with eag@@ erly , un@@ washed hands and swal@@ lowed up .
De@@ ge@@ i sits on the lo@@ am floor - she has no furniture - where she also performs her daily work , for example washing clothes with drinking water from the nearby sw@@ amp .
a bu@@ cket in a hom@@ eless space serves as a lat@@ rine .
as the youngest of the four wives of her husband , her were not assigned to her .
poly@@ gam@@ y is custom@@ ary here .
of course , too late can be dangerous : most vill@@ agers are unemployed , and many drink heavy , and there are the soldiers here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nobody dar@@ es to walk around in the village after 17 o &apos;clock , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is a rare insight into daily life in the high@@ lands of Pap@@ ua , a former Dutch colony , which was taken in 1969 following a controversi@@ al referendum in Indonesia , when only 1,0@@ 26 elders were to vote in front of the occup@@ ying forces .
an existing movement , which stir@@ red up for independence against the Dutch rule , quickly turned against the government of Jak@@ arta , which maintains control of the region and exclu@@ des foreign journalists or j@@ uri@@ di@@ cal ob@@ servers .
in 2003 , the province was officially split into Pap@@ ua and West Pap@@ ua , whereby the independent part of Pap@@ ua New Guinea belonged to the eastern part of the island .
En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali is as remote as it is desol@@ ate . the trip includes a 90 minute flight from the provincial capital Jay@@ ap@@ ura to Nab@@ ire and then a morning 5 @-@ hour drive with a rental car .
there is no public transport .
the city with some 19,@@ 000 inhabitants consists of wooden houses surrounded by bam@@ boo @-@ f@@ ences , and out of corrug@@ ated roofs that were transformed by rust into various yel@@ low@@ ish tones .
only very few Indonesian have made their journey here , let alone journalist and practically no fore@@ igner .
before Christian mission@@ aries arrived , Me@@ e P@@ ago Pap@@ u@@ ans honored a god named U@@ ga Tam@@ ee .
there were also other changes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we were not used to wear these clothes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says De@@ ge@@ i and points to her lively , hand @-@ woven tur@@ ban , her dark shirt and her bright rock . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the past we only had leaves on our bodies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pap@@ ua is Indonesia &apos;s p@@ oo@@ rest province , where 28 % of people live below the poverty line and have some of the worst inf@@ ant mort@@ ality and liter@@ acy rates in Asia .
but it is also Indonesian Gold@@ land .
the largest and most profitable gold mine in the world , Gras@@ berg , owned by Fre@@ ep@@ ort Mc@@ Mor@@ an from Phoenix , is only 60 miles from Pan@@ i@@ ai , a high@@ land province in the size of New Jersey with 15@@ 3,000 inhabitants .
in 2015 alone , Fre@@ ep@@ ort was worth $ 3.1 billion in gold and copper .
in addition , Pap@@ ua has wooden resources worth 78 billion US dollars .
these riches , however , are a source of mis@@ ery for the Pap@@ ua , ensuring that Indonesia &apos;s powerful military keeps a strong presence .
an investigation of 2005 in the New York Times reported that Fre@@ ep@@ ort paid almost $ 20 million between 1998 and 2004 , including up to 15@@ 0,000 US dollars to a single officer .
Pap@@ u@@ anian demands for greater autonomy threat@@ ens these golden go@@ ose and are treated mer@@ cil@@ essly .
according to the information of activists , more than 500@@ ,000 Pap@@ ua were killed and thousands have been rap@@ ed , tor@@ tured and im@@ pris@@ oned by the Indonesian military since 1969 .
mass k@@ ill@@ ings in Pap@@ u@@ as tribe high@@ lands in the 1970 @-@ s have been comp@@ lied with in accordance with the Asia Human Rights Commission for Gen@@ ocide .
in the region alone , the Indonesian police arrested more than 3,@@ 900 peaceful demonstr@@ ators last year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we Bec@@ oming Every@@ thing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; means in a report of the Arch@@ di@@ oc@@ ese Bris@@ ban@@ e from 2016 , which reports about atro@@ cities in the previous year , such as illegal exec@@ utions and torture - rape and electric strikes are particularly popular after another report - and the brutal defeat of peaceful demonstrations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is difficult to count the number of victims , as each week inci@@ dents occur , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Andreas Har@@ son@@ o , Indonesia researcher for Human Rights Watch . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the screws have intensi@@ fied since Pap@@ u@@ as resources bring an influ@@ x of sett@@ lers from other parts of Indonesia .
the population of 3.5 million inhabitants of the province is 83 % Christian , but demo@@ graphic developments are changing as Muslim economic migrants come from the populated islands of Java , Bor@@ neo , Sum@@ atra and Sul@@ awes@@ i .
Jav@@ an@@ ese war@@ ding can@@ te@@ ens sell ro@@ asted chicken and G@@ ado @-@ G@@ ado , a mixed vegetables served with pe@@ an@@ ut sauce .
local people fight to keep up here .
&quot; the migrants have started to sell ch@@ ick@@ ens and vegetables cheaper than the local pap@@ ua , &quot; explains A@@ bet@@ h You , a 24 @-@ year @-@ old Pan@@ i@@ ai local , who went to work in the provincial capital of Jay@@ ap@@ ura .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it has cost the native Pap@@ ua - Mama @-@ Mama &#91; the women &#93; of Pap@@ ua - her market . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Indonesian President Jok@@ o Wi@@ do@@ do , pop@@ ularly known as Jok@@ ow@@ i , promised to address ine@@ qualities and legal violations in Pap@@ ua during his election campaign in 2014 .
the former carp@@ enter secured 27 of the 29 districts of Pap@@ ua including Pan@@ i@@ ai - on the way to the presidential palace in Jak@@ arta .
but Pap@@ ua has changed little , and today the locals feel che@@ ated .
&quot; our hearts are broken because we voted for Jok@@ ow@@ i 2014 , with the expect@@ ation that he will fulfil our hopes that justice will be restored , &quot; says You .
in fact Pan@@ i@@ ai suffered only two months after Jok@@ ow@@ is inaugur@@ ation in October .
on 7 December 2014 a group of 11 children was outside and sang Christmas car@@ ols in front of a camp@@ fire in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , when two Indonesian soldiers broke through the darkness on a motorcycle .
the fri@@ ghtened children told them they were to turn their spot@@ lights on .
one of the soldiers hit their tone and later came back with four soldiers , so the local past@@ or Y@@ av@@ edt T@@ eb@@ ai .
the soldiers who had dr@@ unk , pursued and beat the group with their guns , said sacrifice and witnesses .
then one of the soldiers fired into the group of children .
a child , 16 @-@ year @-@ old Y@@ uli@@ anus Y@@ ei@@ mo , was so severely ro@@ uted that he fell into coma .
a few hours later , the building of the nearby Government Commission was set fire and things calculated the next day .
about 1,000 young Pap@@ ua men , women and children gathered on a soccer field in front of the local police station and the military command center to demand justice .
they wor@@ e cerem@@ onial hunting bows and carried the Wa@@ ita dance - running in circles and a bird song im@@ it@@ ating - from Pap@@ u@@ as Me@@ e P@@ ago @-@ trunk .
some demonstr@@ ators began to hur@@ ry stones on police and military posts .
when the mood was heated , the soldiers were sent a command over an internal radio : &quot; if the masses do more than three times , they shoot them dead , &quot; says it in an official document of TIME , which was not released to the local media .
Y@@ er@@ em@@ ias Kay@@ ame , 56 , the head of the K@@ ego K@@ oto neighborhood of En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , saw the threatening danger and called for tranquility and ur@@ ged the crowd to return home .
nobody was listening to the mood .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when I turned around , I suddenly shot into my left wrist , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said TIME on the veranda of his colorful painted wooden house . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Kay@@ ame still does not know who fired , but says that the ball came out of the ranks of the soldiers assembled here .
&quot; it was over@@ crowded , many shots were fired , &quot; he adds .
the native man Al@@ fi@@ us You@@ w was hit three times , so his c@@ ousin , who witnessed the sho@@ ot@@ ings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I ran to him and examined his body to make sure he was it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Y@@ oh@@ anes , who just bears a name like many Indonesian , the TIME in a glo@@ omy atmosphere . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I saw that he was dead ... I kis@@ sed him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the chief inspec@@ tor of the Pap@@ ua @-@ police , Y@@ ot@@ je Men@@ de , said re@@ por@@ ters that his officers wanted to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; secure &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; their station as they are attacked . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must defend ourselves when people thre@@ aten to kill us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the spokes@@ man of the Pap@@ ua Police , Commissioner Pu@@ d@@ jo Su@@ list@@ i@@ yo , in 2015 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is about life and death . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to Human Rights Watch , five young demonstr@@ ators were killed and many others were injured .
the news about the k@@ ill@@ ings came only the following day &quot; fil@@ tered &quot; to Jak@@ arta .
three weeks Jok@@ ov@@ i in Jay@@ ap@@ ura kept a passionate speech in which he expressed sympathy for the families of the victims and s@@ wor@@ e to tackle the historical gri@@ ev@@ ances in Pap@@ ua .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want this case to be solved immediately so that it will no longer happen in the future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; security Minister Wir@@ anto said in October 2016 that he introduced an extr@@ aj@@ udi@@ cial mechanism for backing up historical human rights violations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the exc@@ uses began almost immediately .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most of the injuries occurred long ago . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some were in the 90 @-@ ern and the beginning of the 2000 @-@ 2000 years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the point is that we have committed ourselves to address these violations , but there are processes that need to pass through , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
then , Wir@@ anto did a retreat when he spoke to TIME on June 5 in Jak@@ arta and said he did not plan to establish a complaint mechanism in Pap@@ ua .
&quot; &quot; &quot; instead , everything is regulated by law , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wir@@ anto , which the UN charged for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; crimes against humanity &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which demanded more than 1,000 deaths in East Tim@@ or &apos;s bloody independence vote of 1999 , said that 11 cases of human rights ab@@ uses in Pap@@ ua were already attached , including the pan@@ i@@ ai incident . &quot; &quot; &quot;
families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai victims met such claims with fier@@ ce dis@@ belief .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was inter@@ viewed four times over the last three years , but there was no progress , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Y@@ oh@@ anes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I am tired . &quot;
he says that years later he still lives in fear .
&quot; I &apos;m afraid , &quot; he says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am afraid to be arrested by the military , afraid to be shot . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his brother Y@@ ac@@ ob@@ us repeated the view that people in Pan@@ i@@ ai were afraid to discuss the incident .
he says he was struck by the military after he helped to bury four of the victims .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after I had buried the cor@@ p@@ ses , the military sought me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sho@@ wer@@ ies have not ceased .
on Tuesday the Indonesian police shot on vill@@ agers in Pan@@ i@@ ais neighborhood Dei@@ y@@ ai .
during a confront@@ ation between vill@@ agers and the manager of a B@@ auf@@ ir@@ ma who refused to bring a conscious man to the hospital , one person and 17 others were injured , including children .
the man , the 24 @-@ year @-@ old R@@ avi@@ anus Dou@@ w , who was dro@@ w@@ ned when he f@@ ished in a nearby river died on the way to the hospital .
excited village inhabitants prot@@ ested in front of the company &apos;s location .
the police said that the vill@@ agers threw stones on officers who responded by fir@@ ing warning .
but local people say that the mobile bri@@ g@@ ade ( Indonesian param@@ il@@ itary police ) began to shoot at the crowd and killed one .
&quot; we were so in pan@@ ic , we are afraid that there will be re@@ venge , &quot; says the 29 @-@ year @-@ old Dom@@ ing@@ g@@ u B@@ adi@@ i , who lives near the hospital and witnessed how the injured were quickly delivered here , so the TIME .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I hid myself two days in my house . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dei@@ y@@ ai Parliament has called to call on the officers involved and withdraw the mobile bri@@ g@@ ade of police from the territory . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pan@@ i@@ ai was always a rel@@ ap@@ se for the Indonesian government .
the lack of meaningful development strengthens the dis@@ content of the tri@@ bal people Me@@ e , Mon@@ i , Dan@@ i and Dam@@ al , who live in the green high@@ lands of Pap@@ ua .
many joined the &quot; Free Pap@@ ua Movement &quot; ( O@@ PM ) , the re@@ bel army , claiming to defend the rights of the Pap@@ ua by pushing spor@@ adi@@ cally attacks and kid@@ n@@ apping of Indonesian soldiers .
some of the top O@@ PM leaders come from Pan@@ i@@ ai , among them T@@ adi@@ us Yog@@ i and Daniel Yu@@ das K@@ og@@ o@@ ya .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in response to this , thousands of people in Pan@@ i@@ ai were arrested and arbit@@ rar@@ ily arrested in cust@@ ody , under the pre@@ text of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; securing national sovereignty . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some never appear again .
among the people of Pap@@ ua Pan@@ i@@ ai is known as a &quot; trag@@ ic , forgotten place . &quot;
poverty strengthens dis@@ satisfaction .
the little rice that is sold in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali is too expensive for locals .
bread is just as out of reach .
people here build everything they eat : especially not@@ a and fruit and leaf@@ y vegetables .
agriculture is the task of women who can process four or five fields of sweet potatoes .
they retain most of the crop for the family , while the rest is sold on the local market .
ten pieces of Not@@ a tast@@ ed only 10,000 Indonesian Rup@@ ies ( 75 C@@ ents ) .
over time , economic ine@@ qualities have grown between the indigenous Pap@@ ua and the new migrants who have arrived in greater numbers since the opening of new routes to Nab@@ ire Airport .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the few jobs that exist in the region usually go to the better educated and prosper@@ ous migrants . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pap@@ ua sel@@ dom have capital or abilities to make their own businesses competitive .
&quot; the young people are not interested in staying in the village ... because there are no jobs or money , &quot; says John Gob@@ ai , Chairman of the Board of Directors of Pan@@ i@@ ai .
isolation keeps the eyes of the world far from Pap@@ ua .
in addition , restrictions on the reporting of international media remain ten@@ se .
at the beginning of the year , French journalists Fran@@ ck Esc@@ u@@ die and Basi@@ lle Long@@ champ were deport@@ ed from Pap@@ ua because of lack of coordination with related institutions , although they were given their rare permission to film .
according to P@@ hel@@ im K@@ INE , Deputy Asia director of Human Rights Watch , the promises of Jok@@ ow@@ is election campaign , to raise the limitations of reporting to promote transparency and development , were not realized .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are new dangers to foreign journalists who try to report from Indonesia &apos;s un@@ peaceful provinces of Pap@@ ua and Western Pap@@ ua : visa ref@@ usal and a black list , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in an explanation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
lack of press control means that the international pressure on the Indonesian government remains largely restricted to the immediate neighbours of Pap@@ u@@ as .
in March six p@@ aci@@ fic states - Ton@@ ga , Nau@@ ru , Palau , Tu@@ val@@ u , the Marshall Islands and the Solomon Islands - the UN Human Rights Council to investigate the &quot; different and widespread injuries &quot; of Pap@@ ua including Pan@@ i@@ ai shooting .
the same countries have historically supported the O@@ PM .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the spokes@@ man of the Indonesian Ministry of Foreign Affairs Ar@@ r@@ man@@ atha N@@ asi@@ r dism@@ is@@ sed the accus@@ ations of the group and said journalists in Jak@@ arta : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Indonesia , there is still a democratic system , and there are free media , so it is difficult to cover the evidence of human rights . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people on the ground want more foreign governments to note this . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as an official delegation from the Netherlands , under the direction of Human Rights Ambassador K@@ ees Van B@@ aar , Jay@@ ap@@ ura visited their silence and pressed him &quot; We want freedom , &quot; according to a source , which also participated in the meeting , but would like to remain anonymous .
Indonesia has another presidential election , but the Pap@@ ua say they will probably not vote for Jok@@ ow@@ i again .
&quot; Jok@@ ow@@ i is a man who has good intentions , but he is surrounded by the people involved in the Pan@@ i@@ ai shots , &quot; says Gob@@ ai , the Chairman of the Board of Directors .
he wants that Jok@@ ow@@ i knows that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people , aside from that it lives under the constant threat of a rob@@ ber@@ y military , is in poor educational and health services .
Gob@@ ai says that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people , like other Pap@@ ua , consider their voice for Jok@@ ow@@ i as a &quot; gu@@ ilt &quot; he must pay back .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they don &apos;t need money , they just want justice , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
despite the threats and inti@@ mid@@ ations , families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai shot victims led a last symbolic act of de@@ fi@@ ance : the cor@@ p@@ se of a victim was buried on a site exactly opposite the police and the military station .
they know that they may never come to justice , but at least they don &apos;t forget those responsible for their crimes .
&quot; a member of our family was killed , &quot; says Y@@ ac@@ ob@@ us with a lo@@ wered head .
&quot; what else can we do ? &quot;
fire records the &apos; Tor@@ ch &apos; sky@@ scrap@@ er from Dubai for the second time
a fire occurred on Friday in one of the highest towers of the world in Dubai , and forced hundreds of residents to flee from the 337 meter high , 79 @-@ storey building .
it is the second fire that folds in just two years through the high @-@ rise building , which is acci@@ dentally called the Tor@@ ch Tower ( tor@@ ch tower ) .
the building was ev@@ acu@@ ated , injuries were not reported , and there was no direct word about the cause of the flame .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we slept and we got up at the fire alarm and at the scre@@ aming of the people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we burned down the stairs , and it took about 10 minutes to come down from the 50@@ th floor down , &quot; an inhabit@@ ant told his name as George ang@@ ab , Reu@@ ters .
Dub@@ ais civil protection authorities said that fire fighting units against 4.00 pm local time ( 0@@ 0.00 GMT ) cleared the fire and cooled down the building .
the government said they work on providing accommodation to those affected .
the incident can re@@ vit@@ alize questions regarding the safety of materials used in outside areas of high @-@ rises all over the world .
an investigation by the management of the Tor@@ ch building after the fire in 2015 revealed that most of the damage from the cl@@ adding , exterior cl@@ adding for decoration or insulation came .
in Britain , the police said they believe that the system of panels for insulation and cl@@ adding at the London Gren@@ fell Tower could have contributed to the rapid spread of a fire in which about 80 people died .
no Davis Cup reform : further Best @-@ of @-@ five
the President of the International tennis association ( IT@@ F ) has fallen through its great Davis Cup cou@@ p at the AG@@ M .
at the meeting in H@@ o Chi Min@@ h City , the pro @-@ thirds majority supported this sport @-@ revolutionary proposal to play Davis Cup single only on two winning sets , w@@ afer @-@ thin not supported by the required two @-@ thirds majority .
although often very long , but even so much appreciated five @-@ sentence classic remain the traditional competition thus preserved .
6@@ 3,@@ 54 percent of the member states voted for reform , the objective of the IT@@ F President David Hag@@ ger@@ ty was therefore only scar@@ ce .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we respect this decision but are disappointed that our member@@ ships do not have adopted the whole reform package for the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we need a change to secure the long @-@ term future of this icon@@ ic and historical cont@@ ests , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hag@@ ger@@ ty said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
one will continue to work on improving the application .
not only after the vote , after many contradictions , the proposal had already come before the proposal to carry out the final in a neutral place .
new from 2018 are only compar@@ atively minor details : in the next round , the fin@@ alists will have the host right in the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup in the next round .
in order to reduce the costs for the organizers , the requirements regarding training places etc. are facilit@@ ated and players will have to do less official media dates before the Davis Cup .
more than 1 of 5 US travelers will bring forbidden objects to the aircraft , find a survey
a survey conducted in flight pass@@ words revealed that more than 20 % inten@@ tionally or un@@ consciously prohibited items at the check@@ points of the US Transportation Security Administration are sm@@ ug@@ ging , including at least 6 percent who entered the plane while they acci@@ dentally worn out kni@@ ves or other items with blades .
less than 1 percent claimed they had reported delayed , that they had mistakenly traveled with fire@@ arms , am@@ mun@@ ition or explo@@ sives .
the survey was conducted at more than 1,000 people , which was conducted by a Jet @-@ Char@@ ter@@ service , the Str@@ at@@ os Jet Char@@ ters Inc . , also noted that younger travellers rather dis@@ regard the rules .
from the respon@@ dents who agreed that they were kno@@ w@@ ingly trying to fly with something that was bann@@ ed by the T@@ SA were 19.@@ 7 percent millen@@ ni@@ als , compared to less than 15 percent , the members of the Generation X were .
the most common items that were inten@@ tionally to@@ wed to T@@ SA agents were food and flu@@ ids .
over 3 per cent said kno@@ w@@ ingly to have borne objects with blades by security control , while 2.2 percent of female respon@@ dents and 3.7 percent of the male respon@@ dents also confirmed that they had inten@@ tionally bann@@ ed bann@@ ed drugs into the aircraft .
the company said it was asking travelers throughout the country to find out how many acci@@ dentally sm@@ ug@@ gled goods through airport security and how many had done it inten@@ tionally .
it is no surprise that people who are most often sm@@ ug@@ gling - kno@@ w@@ ingly or unk@@ now@@ ingly - wear those who were most often flying .
however , the company points out that the T@@ SA guidelines are a bit complicated and conf@@ using .
people are often unsure which liquids they are allowed to take with or how much of it .
so it is no surprise that the largest amount of liquids bor@@ dered by the T@@ SA are prohibited .
for a while people thought that T@@ SA could look at books as sm@@ ug@@ gling goods .
liquids are allowed on domestic flights , but not on international flights .
&quot; &quot; &quot; El@@ on Mus@@ k doesn &apos;t matter : tens of thousands of Tes@@ la customers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cancel &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Elektro @-@ Taus@@ end@@ s@@ as@@ sa El@@ on Mus@@ k enjoys the huge number of pre@@ orders for his new Tes@@ la &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Model 3 &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he has so far under@@ sco@@ red that some of the customers have already with@@ drawn their non @-@ binding reservation .
in addition to the triumph@@ ant figures on sales increases and even more gigantic sales targets , Tes@@ la leader El@@ on Mus@@ k will reveal a different , less glorious number for the first time at the announcement of the recent quar@@ terly balance : the cancellation of the new mass market model 3 .
in recent months , Mus@@ k had frequently recru@@ ited more than 500@@ ,000 pre @-@ orders for the new car , whose delivery is just beginning .
now Mus@@ k adm@@ its : from the total of 5@@ 18,@@ 000 pre @-@ orders , 6@@ 3,000 have already been with@@ drawn .
critics have always pointed out that they are merely non @-@ binding reservations .
in case of cancellation , Tes@@ la pays the 1000 Euro ( in the U.S. 1000 dollars and in the United Kingdom 1000 Po@@ unds ) &quot; reservation payment . &quot;
at present 45@@ 5,000 of such non @-@ binding reservations , Mus@@ k said in a telephone conference with analysts .
however , that the cancellation of up to now twelve percent of all orders could become a problem , the Tes@@ la leader does not believe .
its argument : the challenge in the ambitious growth targets is not on demand , but on the production site .
in the past year , Tes@@ la delivered 8@@ 4,000 vehicles .
in 2018 , all models should be - 500@@ ,000 , 2020 one million .
the demand for this is obvious .
according to Mus@@ k , there are currently 1800 reservations per day .
if a Model 3 is ordered today , at the earliest in the second half of 2018 , the delivery can be expected - if Tes@@ la manages to drive his brand @-@ new , never @-@ tested production lines without any major inter@@ rup@@ tions with maximum capacity utilization .
many experts doubt that this is possible .
but if it comes to major delays , then the limitation of reservations could be a problem for Tes@@ la .
because then the company cannot prevent dis@@ satisfied customers from running in flo@@ cks .
EPA @-@ Chef P@@ ru@@ itt returns to reduce emissions due to the delay of the rules of the Obama Er@@ a
one day after being acc@@ using of 15 states Scott P@@ ru@@ itt , the chief of the Environmental Protection Agency , with@@ drew his previous decision to delay the implementation of the rules of the Obama era in order to reduce emissions of smo@@ g poll@@ uting poll@@ ut@@ ants .
P@@ ru@@ itt presented the changes when his agency referred to the needs of state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ art environmental authorities more respon@@ sive than previous administr@@ ations .
he did not mention the complaint that had been raised against his previous position in a Federal Court of App@@ eal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is about a period that went on October 1 for states to comply with the 2015 standard of o@@ zone &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; P@@ ru@@ itt declared in June that he would delay the observ@@ ance of a year to give his authority more time to study the plan and to avoid &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; interfer@@ ing in local decisions or to hin@@ der economic growth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
P@@ ru@@ itt , who was before his appointment by President Donald Tr@@ ump At@@ tor@@ ney at O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma , was a long time a reliable opponent of tough@@ er environmental regulations .
since its arrival in Washington , P@@ ru@@ itt has repeatedly gone over to block or delay regulations for the chemical industry and the industry of fossil fuels .
the sudden change from Wednesday is the recent legal set@@ back for the re@@ section regulatory roll@@ back agenda .
last month , a Federal Court of App@@ eals in Washington decided that the EPA @-@ ste@@ ward exceeded its authority when he tried to delay the implementation of a rule of the Obama administration , the oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce meth@@ ane le@@ aks .
in a statement published on Wednesday evening , P@@ ru@@ itt suggested that its revers@@ al in o@@ zone standards was simply the willingness of EPA to cooperate with the States through the complex process of timely fulfillment of the new standards .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; under previous administr@@ ations , the EPA has often failed to comply with the dead@@ lines for implementation and then waiting to be accused by activ@@ ist groups and others , and in an agreement struck the date for implementation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said P@@ ru@@ itt , who dar@@ ed the EPA more than a dozen times in his previous job . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not believe in regulation through judicial proceedings , and we take dead@@ lines seriously . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we also take the law and authority that gives us serious . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , the EPA &apos;s statement stated that P@@ ru@@ itt eventually sei@@ zes his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; authority to delay and all other legally available powers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to ensure that the provisions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; are based on a solid policy and the best available information . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the re@@ public@@ ans in the Congress are pushing for a more comprehensive re @-@ constitution of the o@@ zone rules .
a draft law approved last month shall delay the implementation of the 2015 rules by at least eight years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the measure has not yet been set up in the Senate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the New York General Prosec@@ utor , Eric Schnei@@ der@@ man , who led the Co@@ alition of States who acc@@ use the EPA this week , said the Group intends to maintain legal pressure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the conversion of EPA - according to our complaints - is an important gain for health and safety of these 6.7 million New Yor@@ kers and the more than 115 million Americans who are directly affected by the smo@@ g that flows into their congregations , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Schnei@@ der@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
new York joined in this case California , Connec@@ tic@@ ut , Del@@ aware , Illinois , I@@ owa , Ma@@ ine , Massach@@ us@@ etts , Minn@@ es@@ ota , New Mexico , O@@ reg@@ on , Rho@@ de Island , Vermont and Washington and the District of Columbia .
ground o@@ zone arises when poll@@ ut@@ ants from cars , power plants , oil refin@@ eries , chemical plants and other sources in the atmosphere react to sunlight .
the resulting smo@@ g can cause serious breathing problems in sensitive groups of people , and contribute to thousands of premature deaths each year .
representatives of the public health care system and the environ@@ ment@@ alists che@@ ered over P@@ ru@@ ffy aston@@ ishing course changes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is distur@@ bing how much pressure it takes to get this sensible step from the responsible for the protection of the air we inhal@@ e , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lor@@ i Ann Bur@@ d from the Center for Bi@@ ological Di@@ versity . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must continue fighting against the ideological cr@@ us@@ ade of the Tr@@ ump government to address environmental poll@@ ut@@ ors and their particular interests . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
tum@@ ble@@ stone celebrates 750 years of St. Hil@@ arius @-@ Church
750 years of St. Hil@@ arius church : on the occasion of the Jubil@@ ee of the Berg@@ kirche , the old cemetery site in Tum@@ lingen will be invited to a ser@@ en@@ ade at 16 : 30 pm .
whether its idyllic location and beautiful view of the village , the historic St. Hil@@ arius facility is a popular place to stay .
visitors to the sixth Ben@@ e@@ fi@@ z ser@@ en@@ ade can be ench@@ anted by this powerful place .
the rescue and preservation of the oldest building in the village have made the friends and promot@@ er tum@@ ours to their concern .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Walter Mart@@ ini points out : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s a unique village gem . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 12@@ 67 the St. Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kap@@ elle was first mentioned in the Wür@@ tt@@ ember@@ gian dictionary : count Hermann von Sul@@ z sold the mountain with the parish church to Tum@@ lingen and the Vog@@ tei &quot; at Mag@@ ister Eber@@ hard von Hor@@ b and his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark Silver .
according to the wording of the document , on the Tum@@ linger mountain , besides the former parish church , besides the former parish church , there was also a magnificent courtyard , to which the church or the patron saint belonged and not the other way round .
so there were also people there .
as seen from the description of the Ober@@ am@@ tes Freuden@@ stadt of 18@@ 58 , it was next to the Unter@@ dorf and the Ober@@ dorf , which are still visible in the village of tum@@ ulus , the &quot; mountain &quot; of the third , the splendid settlement core of the village .
old maps from the time around the year 1600 confirm these historical circumstances .
the right of pat@@ ron@@ age originated from the early medieval owner &apos;s right .
a gentle@@ man who built a church , furnished and occupied with a priest , still remained the owner of this church and could also inher@@ it this owner &apos;s church .
this ent@@ ails the right to use a priest or propose a new past@@ or to the bishop .
there were three alt@@ ars in the church and two bells on the tower .
the Gre@@ ater of the two were bar@@ ren at Christmas 16@@ 73 .
the newly created bell rang out for the first time in 16@@ 92 , but had to be released in 1942 during the Second World War .
in the 30 @-@ year @-@ old war ( 16@@ 16 to 16@@ 48 ) the windows were inserted and the bells were stolen .
the roof was le@@ ak@@ y .
in 17@@ 96 French forces enc@@ amped in the vicinity of the church .
they removed the pul@@ pit and church chairs and used them as fire@@ wood .
to overthrow the remains of the church in 18@@ 09 .
until 1869 , the Tum@@ linger Hil@@ arius cemetery served as last resting place for the dead from Hör@@ schwei@@ ler .
in 18@@ 23 the cemetery was extended and the Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kirche was demol@@ ished .
only the church tower was left .
during the New Year &apos;s night in 18@@ 34 , a storm divided the church tower and half over@@ threw .
to prevent mis@@ fortune , the tower was demol@@ ished .
only the Tur@@ m@@ z@@ wer@@ g still existing today remained as a witness to the 750 @-@ year @-@ old church history .
today Horst K@@ allen@@ berger and Rolf @-@ Dieter was@@ em maintain the Hil@@ arius system from the &quot; Schaff@@ hausen Rent@@ ners &quot; as the successor of Dieter Dock@@ horn .
as organis@@ er , the friends and promot@@ ers invite their friends and sponsors on Sunday , July 16 , to the sixth ser@@ en@@ ade on the old cemetery to St. Hil@@ ary Chapel .
this is designed by the com@@ bo of the Ke@@ pler @-@ Gymnasium Freuden@@ stadt and with contributions by Kurt Kü@@ bler and Rein@@ hold Matt@@ eis .
location : Hart@@ mut Rom@@ ann is talking about the closing word .
the program starts at 4.@@ 30 p.m .
admission is from 3.30 pm .
for the so@@ unding of the ser@@ en@@ ade there is a trunk in front of the cemetery .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; enjoy a summer evening under the shade of old trees and with a wide view over meadows to the forest , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the organizers reveal the fantastic view . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the ser@@ en@@ ade only takes place in dry weather .
the organizers are hoping for many supporters to get the historic St. Hil@@ arius facility , which is of importance for tum@@ ors and list@@ eners .
the friends and promot@@ ers of Tum@@ arc are particularly committed to home care , including Ser@@ en@@ ade Organ@@ izer Walter Mart@@ ini .
association wants to make approval by Win@@ dr@@ ä@@ dern
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim resi@@ des &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; does not see a legal requirement for the construction and has therefore turned to the council . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the association &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim resi@@ des &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has called on Land@@ rat Andreas Co@@ enen ( C@@ DU ) to withdraw its approval for the construction of planned wind turbines in the Bo@@ ish@@ eim N@@ ette . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is un@@ lawful .
the association ar@@ gues that at the time of hom@@ olog@@ ation on December 30 , 2016 , no wind turbines could have been approved , since at the time in Vier@@ sen only at the city border to Schwal@@ m@@ tal has existed a wind power concentration zone .
within this concentration zone , the construction and operation of wind turbines are generally possible , but at the same time the concentration area causes the exclusion of wind energy use for the rest of the city .
such zones should prevent a &quot; spar@@ ing &quot; of the landscape .
although the city Vier@@ sen had decided a second wind power concentration zone in the Bo@@ ish@@ washer N@@ ette a few days earlier , but the district government Düsseldorf did not appro@@ ve , because of a missing form .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the lack of planned legal requirements , the granted permit is still illegal and therefore res@@ ale , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Christoph Er@@ k@@ ens , chairman of &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim cat@@ ches . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
current state of affairs : before the summer break the city council again decided on the wind@@ break zone in the Bo@@ ish@@ washer N@@ ette ; a permit from the district government still stands out .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Er@@ k@@ ens : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with this , the distribution of a permit for the construction of wind turbines is excluded . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the circle confirms the entrance of the invitation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the corresponding letter has been made in the circle of Vier@@ sen since last week , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a spokes@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the circle takes her to investigate the matter once more .
however , they do not expect the procedure to be stopped .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with regard to ongoing proceedings at the Administr@@ ative Court , the circle on Thursday did not want to speak about the argument of the association &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim for@@ wards &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the NEW Re , a subsidiary of the NEW , plans to build four @-@ metre high wind turbines on an area at the Bo@@ ish@@ eimer N@@ ette .
last year , the company , in which the city Vier@@ sen was indirectly involved , has closed lease agreements with the owner of approximately 65 hectares of land .
with the construction of the four wind turbines , the power requirement of around 11 400 households should be covered - this corresponds to approximately one @-@ fifth of the electricity requirement of all four @-@ sen@@ er households .
the NEW Re wants to invest some 20 million euros .
last summer , Vier@@ sen &apos;s town council gave its green light for the purchase of three wind turbines in the Lin@@ ni@@ ch Wind@@ park near Aachen as well as a participation in a wind energy plant in Ü@@ bach @-@ Pal@@ enberg in the district of Hein@@ sberg .
car and tractor cr@@ acking : woman dies at terrible accident
one terrible traffic accident happened Friday morning at 10 o &apos;clock on the L 333 between Nieder@@ wall@@ men@@ ach and Bo@@ gel ( Rhein @-@ L@@ ahn @-@ Kreis ) .
a woman was dead@@ ly wounded .
two more persons were easily injured .
the national road remained closed over hours .
according to police statements , a 17 @-@ year @-@ old young woman from Bor@@ ni@@ ch continued with her 53 @-@ year @-@ old mother as a companion to the L 333 in the direction of Bo@@ gel .
town and ret@@ ailer planning &quot; Home Sh@@ opp@@ en &quot; weekend
bad Langen@@ sal@@ ak and people from the region are to re@@ discover the shopping opportunities in the city centre in September .
the trad@@ es and the city administration want to use the weekend on September 8 @-@ 9 to attract the residents to the city &apos;s shopping spre@@ e .
as the chairman of the business association , Christian König , announced , the &quot; Home Sh@@ opp@@ en &quot; weekend aims to sens@@ it@@ ise customers what offers their own city apart from the usual supermarket goods .
thus , there is a market with regional suppliers , similar to the weekly market .
in addition , local firms should present themselves with their training positions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , the shops of the city center are to invite to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mit@@ ter@@ acht @-@ Sh@@ opp@@ en &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in doing so , the action targets not only on residents of the city and the region .
in preparation are commerci@@ als on the radio , an internet video and printed bags , pointing to the action weekend , so Christian King .
municipal and trade associations collabor@@ ate with the Chamber of Commerce and Industry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this makes the trad@@ es@@ man and the city into a further stage of the project &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Attrac@@ tive city centre &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this includes new offers such as the first &quot; active day &quot; for the well @-@ being , including sale @-@ on Sunday , talks with all business@@ men and hosts to actively participate in active participation .
also attractive offers on Saturday and the reno@@ un@@ cement of parking fees on this day are part of the concept .
in addition , customer potentials should be newly opened or re @-@ opened again .
this includes spa guests and tourists .
but many locals would have lost the city center at shopping .
in the end , everyone would have to contribute to revi@@ ving the city centre - to land@@ lords , the establishments of the whole city and clubs .
it laugh@@ ed to overcome the le@@ th@@ ar@@ gy with a network , which made itself partially wider , had said King in the spring .
Birgit Stre@@ ich , head of the I@@ HK @-@ Center in Mühl@@ hausen shared with the third &quot; Heimat @-@ Sh@@ opp@@ en &quot; day , five Thurin@@ gian cities for the first time .
in addition to Bad Langen@@ sal@@ za , this is Weimar , S@@ ö@@ mmer@@ da , Heiligen@@ stadt and Blei@@ cher@@ ode .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the day should promote the appreciation of local trade and make its significance stronger for the common good of our cities , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Stre@@ ich . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the action under the leadership of the Chamber of Commerce and with many partners makes it clear that every citizen with his buying behaviour can influence his direct surroundings .
two dead and several injured after explosion at US school
during construction , there was a gas explosion in the school building .
new people were hurt .
at a gas explosion in the US city of Min@@ ne@@ apolis two people were killed and nine more injured , some of them severely injured .
according to the fire bri@@ g@@ ade was on Wednesday ( local time ) nor a vulner@@ ability in critical condition .
a man died when a part of a school building collap@@ sed during the explosion .
a first missing one was later buried also dead .
at the dead there were employees of the school .
as a matter of fact , the authorities suspected working on a gas pipeline .
only a few people stayed in the building of the Min@@ neh@@ aha Academy .
Tr@@ ump continued after pier@@ ced tran@@ scripts of telephone calls Mexico under pressure because of the payment of the boundary wall
tran@@ scripts of telephone calls between U.S. President Donald Tr@@ ump and leader of Mexico and Australia were published by the Washington Post .
on January 27 , Tr@@ ump requested a telephone conversation with the Mexican President En@@ rique P@@ ena Nie@@ to to say publicly that he would not pay for a planned limit wall .
the US President imp@@ lied him because he publicly den@@ oun@@ ced the Wall . according to report , he said to him , &quot; You cannot tell the press . &quot;
Tr@@ ump started his presidential campaign with the promise to build a wall on the southern border of the United States , and s@@ wor@@ e to leave Mexico for the project .
tran@@ scripts of his first call with the Australian Prime Minister Mal@@ col@@ m Turn@@ bull were also published and revealed a ten@@ se exchange .
Mr. Tr@@ ump said Mr. Turn@@ bull that a trade for the US refugees , who emig@@ rated to Australia , &quot; ridi@@ cul@@ ous , &quot; &quot; mies &quot; and &quot; stup@@ id &quot; and that the existence on the trade which was medi@@ ated by the Obama administration would make him look like a &quot; dep@@ p &quot; after having proposed a ban on the res@@ ett@@ lement of refugees in the United States .
Mr. Tr@@ ump finished the call after he had said Mr. Turn@@ bull , &quot; this is the most unpleasant call for the whole day . &quot;
Moo@@ res Ford @-@ Mass@@ ac@@ re : activists lead rac@@ ist Lyn@@ ch@@ act as a call for justice
a 1948 @-@ er Ford Mercury drove through a group of spectators in Mon@@ roe , Georgia , and shr@@ unk to the Ford Bridge of Mo@@ ore .
before the car , which had four black passengers and a white driver , could reach the bridge , a group of white men emerged with ri@@ fl@@ es to block his way .
the leader of the mo@@ b - a middle aged man in a needle strip train - took a long train to his c@@ ig@@ ar and looked through the wind@@ shield .
inside the in@@ mates moved in fear .
&quot; we want this n --@@ -- r Roger ! &quot; the man ro@@ ared .
&quot; get him out of the car ! &quot;
scre@@ ams broke the silence when a young black man was dist@@ orted by the passenger seat .
luck@@ ily , this terrible scene , which was played on July 22 , is just one post@@ pon@@ ement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but if a loop is thrown around the neck of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Roger &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; almost everybody in the audience rep@@ lied very real sig@@ h . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since 2005 Om@@ bud@@ s@@ man has come back to Mo@@ ore &apos;s Ford Bridge to mim@@ ic the night in which two black couples - Roger and Dor@@ othy Mal@@ com and George and Ma@@ e Mur@@ ray Dor@@ sey - were logged in 1946 by K@@ u Klu@@ x Kl@@ an .
no one was ever charged with the murder .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is really unbelie@@ vable that no single person was arrested in all these years - although we see them in our congregations , although we know who they are , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ty@@ rone Broo@@ ks who helps in organizing the creation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a dirt spot on a history , but it is a burden for our souls . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Broo@@ ks is a 71 @-@ year @-@ old Con@@ gres@@ s@@ man of the State of Georgia and a life @-@ long citizen .
for him , the position serves as a dramatic call to action and represents an annual reminder of the Mon@@ roe Union that an in@@ justice has never been corrected .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to prosec@@ ute , we want to end , we want healing , we want reconciliation , but first we must receive justice , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we cannot reach healing and reconciliation until we receive justice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a medical doctor lays a bed cloth on the cor@@ p@@ se of one of the victims of the Mo@@ ore @-@ Ford @-@ Lyn@@ ch on July 27 , 1946 .
according to F@@ BI files received by the N@@ BC News , more than 50 men from Mon@@ roe and the surrounding county were suspected in the Lyn@@ ching process .
but no one was ever charged .
although susp@@ ects remain free on foot for decades , citizens say that the double motivation for the Lyn@@ ch actions throughout the city was always known : politics and sex .
in April 1946 , a decision by the Supreme Court of Justice allowed the black citizens in Georgia for the first time to vote their vote in the summer election campaign .
approximately at the same time as the election , according to the F@@ BI , the black Far@@ mer Roger Mal@@ com , a white land@@ owner , Bar@@ nett Ch@@ ester , settled during a struggle - allegedly because of a woman .
Broo@@ ks said the rum@@ our in the city was that H@@ ester slept with Mal@@ com@@ s Mrs. Dor@@ othy and that the baby she carried , did not come from her husband .
on 25 July 1946 , Lo@@ y Har@@ rison , a prominent white land@@ owner , paid 600 dollars to free Mal@@ com from prison , so the F@@ BI .
he was accompanied by Dor@@ othy and her cou@@ sins Ma@@ e Mur@@ ray and George Dor@@ sey .
but when they were then removed from prison and the Mo@@ ore &apos;s Ford Bridge were approaching , a Lyn@@ ch@@ mo@@ b surrounded the car ring .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as it turns out , it was Har@@ rison who has prepared and arranged the k@@ ill@@ ings , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; conclu@@ des a F@@ BI report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is also obvious that there was a conspir@@ acy between state and local prosec@@ ution , which was not only involved in the murder , removing evidence and conce@@ aled the identity of witnesses . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Broo@@ ks form@@ ulates it even more conc@@ ise .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was an elec@@ toral law massac@@ re , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they were all killed to send a message to black people in this community : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you let yourself be registered and if you vote , then this will happen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for nearly a decade Cass@@ andra Gre@@ ene has led the yearly appointment of the Mo@@ ore Ford Bridge Lyn@@ ch @-@ Mor@@ de .
their representation is clear , po@@ ign@@ ant , and is based on a kind of deep rac@@ ism , from which many believe that he does not exist in America anymore .
it is difficult to watch , and even more difficult to look away , but Gre@@ ene said that this is the point .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t want to talk about Lyn@@ ch because we are confronted with the ug@@ liness in all of us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I cannot build a relationship with you if you don &apos;t want to listen to me or do not want to hear what I have done . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the rehear@@ s@@ als for this year &apos;s production began in June , and on the first day almost 30 actors - a dozen wh@@ ites and the rest of the bl@@ acks - came into a room and listened , when Gre@@ ene started a well @-@ tuned overview of the piece .
W@@ ade Mar@@ bau@@ gh is a Gre@@ ene Co @-@ director .
he has played the role of the boss member member for years , but he said the role will never be easier .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I feel dirty because I am not so &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Mar@@ bau@@ gh . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; but I think it is very important to keep this story alive because we do not want to return to these times . &quot;
on the other side of the room , actors Dar@@ ren Brad@@ sh@@ aw and Nick Ras@@ cona , who play Roger Mal@@ com and Bar@@ nett the H@@ ester , tried their lines .
the piece starts with Mal@@ com , the H@@ ester inf@@ lic@@ itly and ur@@ ges him , angry that he slept with his wife Dor@@ othy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I said n --- he , disappeared from my property ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; As@@ cona &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ref@@ utes the fire . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is a break .
and then everyone ( at least all black actors ) breaks out in laughter .
Gre@@ ene laugh@@ s at the lou@@ dest .
&quot; what ? ! , &quot; asked Ras@@ cona .
he is al@@ armed and confused .
was I too hard ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gre@@ ene , still ki@@ di@@ ous . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I simply don &apos;t think that white people then &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; n --- he said &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yet , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of the other black performers wit@@ t@@ led . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you just have to hit the hard &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; R. &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and exactly there the energy moves in space , a feeling of compan@@ ion@@ ship replaces the dis@@ comfort .
everyone is busy to get this right , not only because of the game , but also because of the memory of the four killed people .
the scene begins again .
this time when Ras@@ cona announces the N @-@ word , he says it sharp and with emphasis .
absolutely no one laugh@@ s .
this repet@@ ition ends violent and fast .
there are scre@@ ams , shots and then silence .
a woman , dressed with a mour@@ ning dress , stands above the cor@@ p@@ se of actors and leads Bil@@ lie Holidays trau@@ matic praise of &quot; Stran@@ ge Fruit . &quot;
their voice breaks in every second word .
about a hundred meters behind it , a group of about four dozen viewers wi@@ ped out sweat and tears from the eyes .
the audience is divided almost ev@@ enly between black and white .
a couple is from I@@ th@@ aca , New York , travelled to see the performance , many come down only the street .
they all experienced Geor@@ gi@@ as for eight hours when Broo@@ ks leads them on a pilgrimage to the tom@@ bs of Mal@@ com@@ s and Dor@@ se@@ ys .
up to this point , the mur@@ ders have remained an an@@ ec@@ d@@ ote , but now , when one stands in the same country , where the Lyn@@ ch @-@ Mor@@ de took place , the air feels wei@@ rd .
when the last notes of the song sound out , Gre@@ ene invites the crowd to come closer and inspect the cor@@ p@@ se .
children ho@@ ck on their heads , register the bog@@ us blood and the silent bodies and whis@@ pers each other .
&quot; they are not really dead , &quot; mur@@ m@@ urs a little boy , as if he wanted to remember .
after a few minutes Gre@@ ene would like to thank the crowd - and suddenly it is over .
the actors throw away the Lyn@@ x we@@ dge and wi@@ pe off their tears .
Brad@@ sh@@ aw um@@ ar@@ mt Mar@@ bau@@ gh , the man in suit , who has played the cl@@ an member .
Nick Ras@@ cona h@@ ug@@ s two of his fellow players and then breaks down in their arms , the emotional burden of the performance breaks through him .
&quot; it &apos;s okay , &quot; one of the women whis@@ pers .
&quot; we know that this is not in your heart .
&quot; &quot; &quot; you have done it for a reason . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
later the audience joins the actors for dinner .
at a table a white pair from Atlanta talks about the post@@ pon@@ ement with a black couple that they just got to know .
Den@@ ise Du@@ pl@@ ń@@ ski was struggling to find words , which feeling the performance left behind .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is difficult to hear these terrible words and deeds ... from people who look like you and who do that because they look like you , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what this really does with me makes me believe that the Lyn@@ ch still goes on , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she added , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today it is called Police shooting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the same room , Ty@@ rone keeps Broo@@ ks &apos;s court at his table , he e@@ ats and reminds of the civil rights .
he said he started planning the performance next year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the post@@ pon@@ ement is in a certain way inspiring because it describes the hor@@ rors of what we have endu@@ red , but it is also a moment of learning , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is like we don &apos;t learn from it , then it can happen again . &quot; &quot; &quot;
whoever does not study his own history , who does not know his own history , is condemned to repeat them . &quot;
&quot; Göt@@ ter@@ d@@ ämmerung &quot; reconc@@ iled the W@@ agn@@ eri@@ ans in Bay@@ reuth
in the fourth part of Richard Wagner &apos;s monumental work , director Frank Cast@@ orf focuses on a colorful @-@ fri@@ vol@@ ous st@@ aging against a gigantic , six @-@ story setting .
the revol@@ ving stage ( designed by Aleks@@ and@@ ar DEN@@ IC ) shows a sh@@ ab@@ by street corner together with a wall rest and D@@ ön@@ er@@ bu@@ de in Berlin , a &quot; Pl@@ aste and El@@ aste &quot; logo from G@@ DR times or the New York Stock Exchange .
before that , an open Mercedes @-@ Oldtimer , in which the Rhein@@ tö@@ chter pose as Rock@@ er@@ ir@@ ls , or alternatively an Is@@ etta .
st@@ acked oil drums remind of Cast@@ or@@ fs Leit@@ mot@@ iv - money , power and gre@@ ed - that moves through his &quot; ring &quot; stages .
the three Rhein@@ tö@@ chter - sung by Steph@@ anie Hou@@ tz@@ e@@ el , Wi@@ eb@@ ke L@@ ehm@@ ku@@ hl and Alexandra St@@ einer - harmon@@ ize like already in the Rhein@@ gold .
K@@ ess decei@@ ved Siegfried ( Stefan Vin@@ ke ) , rent a cor@@ p@@ se into the trunk in Hollywood @-@ Man@@ ier and give the Kra@@ wall@@ o @-@ Cli@@ que .
Stephen M@@ illing sings the wonder@@ fully fi@@ bro@@ us Hagen , which surro@@ unds the au@@ ra of a heav@@ y@@ weight box@@ ers .
brutal the scene when he beats Siegfried .
later also Gun@@ ther ( Markus Oak ) must also believe in it .
the audience would like to thank the ensemble with strong appl@@ ause .
F@@ oster , M@@ illing , Vin@@ ke and Con@@ duc@@ tor Jan@@ owski are stor@@ my che@@ ers , who humble himself and the hands of the Merkel @-@ Rau@@ te for@@ wards .
big appl@@ ause is available for the Festival Orchestra , which shows itself on stage for the first time - in view of the great heat back into empty casual wear .
the performance was awa@@ ited by Frank Cast@@ orf and his team team .
in 2013 , in 2013 , he had to leave an un@@ brid@@ led pipe concert on himself , there were five years later , great che@@ ers , in which the scattered &quot; Bu@@ h &quot; calls were sub@@ merged .
Fest@@ spiel@@ ch@@ ef@@ in Katharina Wagner is likely to have enjoyed this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one not@@ ices that the audience has grown together with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ring &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a certain way , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said shortly before the performance of the d@@ pa . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the audience did not only make a form of peace with Cast@@ orf , but it also grew into an understanding of its sights .
I prefer a positive ré@@ sum@@ é .
max quantity works as volunteers
they work in several places in their volunteer year .
where to go everywhere ?
quantity : usually in Stein@@ furt , in the furniture shop , once a week , I am helping in Greven in the furniture bridge .
and I also worked in the open full day at the school .
how are your experiences with it ?
lot : it is a beautiful , broad spectrum that I see here .
I have to do with different people , with young people , with refugees , with young adults .
they are now 26 years , so a late @-@ working volunteer .
how does that come ?
quantity : I have taken Ab@@ itur .
and then a building engineer , let &apos;s say , successfully ab@@ orted .
I realized for myself that it is wrong for me and I want to do something else , work with people .
and then I asked myself what do you do .
do a social year , there is an insight , as it can be seen as it is on the spot , at the focal point maybe too , really is .
and was it so ?
lot : I collected some great impressions .
I will start my studies in social work in the winter semester .
I will study dual , probably in the youth hostel Her@@ ne is a social worker training and studying at Ham@@ m at the university of applied sciences .
isn &apos;t it a bit unusual to have several different areas of application during the Vol@@ un@@ te@@ er Service ?
lot : yes , it is very variable .
it probably always comes to where you do your FS@@ J .
you can make it from Alter@@ sheim to youth work - in all possible fac@@ ets of social work .
with me it was very varied .
I was also partially in the O@@ GS , so in the after@@ no@@ ons of after@@ no@@ ons .
for me it was exactly the right thing that prov@@ oked me .
I could see my own strengths and see how it really runs out .
different than in civil engineering ?
lot : well , here it &apos;s not about calcul@@ ating stati@@ cs .
one always has different people in front of them , each having a completely different story behind them .
whether a refugee , whether a young man , who has been taken out of the family - you always have to deal with it individually .
very interesting .
and you were not afraid ?
quantity : I do not have the type for this .
it is an area that gives a lot .
lots of love , lots of kindness .
there are also negative moments , but life is so .
Pear@@ son cuts further 3,000 jobs and cuts the divi@@ dend to revi@@ ve business
the British education group Pear@@ son said on Friday , they will reduce further 3,000 jobs and cut their divi@@ dend by 72 percent , as another restructuring programme will be launched to overcome the pressure that the company is confronted with .
the job reduction , CEO John Fall@@ on , announced mainly for late 2018 and early 2019 , comes in addition to his previous restructuring in which 4,000 jobs were lost .
Pear@@ son announced a third cost reduction plan in May at a cost reduction plan by another 300 million pounds ( 394 million US dollars ) to revi@@ ve a business that was hit by the fast pace of digital learning .
the company , which had sold its stake in Pen@@ guin Rand@@ om House to Partner Ber@@ tel@@ smann last month , said that the outlook for the financial year remains unchanged after having achieved an increase of 1 percent to 2.05 billion pounds in the first half of the year .
Kon@@ vo@@ i attack of Kab@@ ul : NATO soldier killed in case of su@@ icide bom@@ b
a su@@ icide bom@@ ber attacked a military con@@ vo@@ y in the Afgh@@ an capital Kab@@ ul , killed a NATO soldier and injured several others , officials say .
five soldiers and an interpre@@ ter were injured , shared an explanation of NATO .
according to un@@ confirmed local reports , three civilians died during the incident in the Q@@ ar@@ ag@@ h district .
the bom@@ bar@@ d@@ ment is the last violent act that Afghanistan hit this month - on Tuesday more than 30 people were killed in a mos@@ que in Her@@ at .
on Monday , a su@@ icide bom@@ ber killed two people near the Ira@@ qi emb@@ assy in Kab@@ ul .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in an opinion of NATO , it is said that the explosion happened on Thursday evening when a joint pat@@ rol with the Afgh@@ an army was attacked by a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; supported impro@@ vised &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explosive device . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the statement states that all injured are in a stable state and be treated at Bag@@ ram in the U.S. military hospital .
correspon@@ dents say that the growing strength of the Tali@@ ban and the group known as the so @-@ called Islamic State ( IS ) in Q@@ arab@@ ag@@ h is a major concern for NATO troops in nearby Bag@@ ram .
according to the United Nations , there were at least 1,6@@ 62 civilian cas@@ u@@ alties in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017 , about 20 % of them in the capital .
at the end of July a su@@ icide bom@@ b killed at least 30 people in a predominantly Shi@@ ite district of Kab@@ ul .
the Tali@@ ban said they had carried out this attack .
on May 31 , a massive bom@@ bing in the centre of the city killed more than 150 people with the most dead@@ liest milit@@ ant attack of the country , since the US @-@ led troops re@@ pressed the Tali@@ ban from power in 2001 .
the force under@@ lines the prec@@ ari@@ ous security situation in Afghanistan , as U.S. President Donald Tr@@ ump weigh@@ s the number of U.S. troops supporting the military and police in the country .
correspon@@ dents say that the su@@ icide bom@@ b@@ ings in Kab@@ ul have also caused a crisis of public trust in the government , their policies and in particular in the call of President As@@ hr@@ af Gh@@ ani .
EPA returns decision to delay the smo@@ g rule following complaints
the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has a decision to delay a regulation of the Obama administration , repe@@ aled that States are obliged to contain the smo@@ g @-@ poll@@ uting emissions . this was a day after 15 countries def@@ endants the agency because of the ste@@ pping .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the EPA late on Wednesday announced the decision to promote the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; o@@ zone regulation 2015 &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; and said they show the obligation of the agency to cooperate with states . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we believe in dialogue with and that we respond to our state partners , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said EPA boss Scott P@@ ru@@ itt in an explanation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
P@@ ru@@ itt had announced the intention of EPA in June to determine the o@@ zone provisions - in which poll@@ ut@@ ant emissions are to be measured in a part of the country , where inc@@ isions have to be made to comply with stric@@ ter air@@ quality standards - to delay one year until October 2018 .
a group of 15 mostly democratic states , together with the district of Colombia , filed a complaint on Tuesday , saying that the effort was illegal .
the government of President Donald Tr@@ ump has tried to return a wide range of environmental issues imposed by former President Barack Obama as part of a broader agenda , which according to Tr@@ ump aims to boost economic growth .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , efforts have triggered the set@@ back of democr@@ ats and nature conservation groups that are concerned about the impact of larger emissions on public health . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the EPA website states that inhal@@ ing air , which contains o@@ zone &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reduces lung function and can increase respiratory symptoms &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; such as as@@ thma . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gemein@@ der@@ at wants to share common room
in the end , the decision was clear : in two counter@@ parts , the municipal council of Flu@@ orn @-@ Win@@ z@@ eln decides to set up a common room in the future sen@@ iors .
before the discussion there is an important information : the purchase contract for the still lack of land is signed , says Mayor Bernhard T@@ j@@ aden .
it will still take until the area belonging to the church community so far belongs to the community , but there is no planning obstacle for the project coming from a private investor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is a discussion about a common room for this . &quot; &quot; &quot;
one of the two investors who are still in the boat has offered to meet the community .
on the ground floor , it would provide a living space - some 55 square meters - and an ad@@ joining terrace with 70 square meters of space for a special price .
the administration and the majority of the Municipal Council ho@@ vers such a common room not just as a meeting place only for the inhabitants of the fair living , but openly in the church .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for example , the word of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; kn@@ itting café &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; made the round . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the decision made by the provision of funds for the current budget has already been decided last autumn by means of funding .
the construction is in the renovation area .
the establishment of a community room would be , thus reported T@@ j@@ aden , with 60 percent of 30 percent .
the proposal proposed to signal the investor is that in this respect you don &apos;t want to throw a ni@@ pp@@ le between the legs , the finding that both saddle - what is le@@ aning on the surrounding area - as well as P@@ ult@@ roof - which reduces the height and the construction of an economic power - would be possible .
need@@ less to say , not just Wil@@ fried Soh@@ mer , be this supplement .
when it helps : un@@ anim@@ ously , it happens to the body .
it is not that easy with the common room .
Daniela &apos;s call points to the many own buildings with which one does not move so well , for that one can lean on the common room from the window , says : &quot; I &apos;m really doing it with it . &quot;
Y@@ von@@ ne Sta@@ iger talks about the common room - but absolutely against a municipal participation .
it sees behind it a cover@@ t subsi@@ dy of any weal@@ thy or even foreign investors .
this is not the case , because with the acquisition of the surface there is no allowance , but get a real , market@@ able counter @-@ value , which is market@@ able in case of doubt , is the counter @-@ speech .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sta@@ ig@@ ers &apos;s request to split the proposal according to the proposal will find three advoc@@ ates . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; so it remains with two counter@@ parts in the original program that Stefan H@@ aller summar@@ izes : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we believe the decision , we make a huge step towards closing a huge gap in our infrastructure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
coll@@ ision with car : Rad@@ ler turns on road
when crossing the road , a 82 @-@ year @-@ old cycl@@ ist on Wednesday in Gar@@ ath was captured by a car and badly injured .
as the police announced , the 82 @-@ year @-@ old Langen@@ felder was traveling by bike on the bicycle track of the road Schwar@@ zer Weg in direction of Hil@@ den .
the senior wanted to cross the road at Am Buch@@ hol@@ zer bush .
one in the same direction driving passenger car driver granted him priority .
when the field of Langen@@ felder was driving onto the road , however , he obviously didn &apos;t respect the counter @-@ traffic .
he met with a car who headed a 66 @-@ year @-@ old Hil@@ den@@ ess .
the man was thrown into the street .
he suffered severe injuries and was brought to a hospital with a retreat carriage .
FC Bayern München must ab@@ stain from the Super@@ cup against Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund on David Al@@ aba and Thi@@ ago
the Super@@ cup takes place without him : David Al@@ aba must leave the game against Dortmund .
with personnel care , the FC Bayern will be travelling to Dortmund for the first mandatory play of the new season .
seven professionals are missing the title def@@ ender in the Super@@ cup against the cup winner .
personnel care at the German soccer record master Bayern Munich will always be bigger in front of the Super@@ cup on Saturday ( 20.@@ 30 p.m. / ZDF and Euro@@ sport ) at Pok@@ al@@ si@@ eger Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund .
trainer Carlo An@@ cel@@ otti must ab@@ stain from David Al@@ aba in Du@@ eling with the BV@@ B .
the Italian was confirmed on Friday .
furthermore , Manuel Neu@@ er , James , Thi@@ ago , Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng , Ar@@ j@@ en Rob@@ ben and Juan Bern@@ at are missing .
for the five defe@@ ats over the past six years An@@ cel@@ otti has been responsible for the physical condition and the missing balance in the game of his team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we know that we are not in the best physical condition , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said An@@ cel@@ otti and added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the most important point is the balance in the team . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; last but not least that was not good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the 58 @-@ year @-@ old believes in a performance in the first official compulsory game of the season .
&quot; football is also tac@@ tic , strategy , personality and motivation .
I have great confidence that my team shows these qualities .
the team is ready .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we want to play intelligent , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said An@@ cel@@ otti , who expects a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; difficult , intense game &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the du@@ el of the two German football heav@@ y@@ weights attracts the fans in their spell .
the game is sold out with 8@@ 1,@@ 360 spectators , the German Football League ( DF@@ L ) shared on Friday .
hiking in the resin of Star to Star
the country &apos;s first &quot; Stern@@ en@@ pf@@ ad &quot; should arise in the Harz Mountains .
this is planned by the association Stern@@ warte Sankt Andre@@ as@@ berg .
a planet path exists in Göttingen - since 2003 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Stern@@ en@@ pf@@ ad &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is coming to meet the need for information of many Har@@ z@@ go@@ ers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he combines nature , science , movement and athle@@ tic performance .
the members want to set up boards along the planned route and inform you about stars and con@@ stell@@ ations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a first phase until 2018 , the association plans &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; well accessible installations to five to six places &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Ober@@ har@@ z . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in@@ quire , St. Andre@@ as@@ berg , Braun@@ lage , Hoh@@ eg@@ ei@@ ß and Sie@@ ber .
the information on the boards should be added to the internet .
therefore , a good mobile network reception plays a role in the selection selection .
accessibility is a criterion .
later , the Stern@@ en@@ pf@@ ad Zug is to be extended by train .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the Stern@@ en@@ pf@@ ad the viewers experience a lot of knowledge , for example about the physics of the individual stars , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained the association . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they also learned why stars would have different colors or why a star was stronger than another , although it was much further away .
also , in which con@@ stellation you find a selected star and when it is best to see .
since 2014 , the association operates in the mountain town of St. Andre@@ as@@ berg , the highest located observ@@ atory in Northern Germany .
according to information from the Federal Office for Nature Con@@ servation , the site in the middle of the Harz National Park is one of the six dar@@ k@@ est regions in Germany .
often from there the Mil@@ ky Way and even the Andro@@ med@@ a Galaxy with bare eye can be seen clearly .
in the Uni @-@ Stadt , there has been something similar to the planned Stern@@ en@@ wer@@ g - the planetary route since 2003 at the initiative of the plan@@ et@@ arium Göttingen .
starting before Geb@@ hard &apos;s hotel in the Goe@@ the@@ alle@@ e , which forms the interior of our solar system , the planet path with its stel@@ ae leads up to Hain@@ berg and the observ@@ atory - as well as an &quot; extr@@ ater@@ restrial &quot; location in Di@@ em@@ arden ( community ) with the planet Sed@@ na .
the stel@@ ae with the individual planets - including the Plu@@ to de@@ graded to the d@@ warf planet - are positioned exactly in the distance and scale of one to two billions .
the earth shr@@ inks so on a ball of 6.5 milli@@ meters in diameter , while the sun is exactly 75 meters distant , measuring 70 centi@@ meters .
the entire distance of the planet is about four kilometres .
while the light of sun goes up to the Plu@@ to about eight hours , pedestri@@ ans need a good hour to the st@@ ele with Plu@@ to .
pedestri@@ ans are faster than the light in the universe .
the march to the next fixed star however would last for half a year .
Mik@@ ey Gar@@ cia and Vas@@ yl Lom@@ ach@@ enko meet for the first time , discuss a possible show@@ down
Vas@@ yl Lom@@ ach@@ enko and Mik@@ ey Gar@@ cia , who should stand in a coll@@ ision course to stage the most exciting boxing match in the near future under 147 pounds , met for the first time on Thursday .
they were in separate rooms at ES@@ PN offices in Los Angeles , to Gar@@ cia , the un@@ moved world Bo@@ xing Council lightweight champion , down the cor@@ ridor to gre@@ et Lom@@ ach@@ enko to the World Bo@@ xing organisation super @-@ fe@@ ather@@ weight champion .
after Gar@@ cia &apos;s victory through the former four @-@ divisions world champion Adri@@ en Bron@@ er on Saturday at Show@@ time , both fighters are members of the Top Five Po@@ und @-@ for Po@@ und list .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Gar@@ cia stretched out his right hand and said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; How is it , Champion ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I wish you a lot of luck . &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ enko def@@ ends his belt against Miguel Marri@@ aga on Saturday evening at 7 pm on ES@@ PN .
when the couple pose for photos , Lom@@ ach@@ enko @-@ manager Eg@@ is Kli@@ mas noticed that a possible show@@ down would be the &quot; perfect magn@@ itude . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am a former fe@@ ather weight , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gar@@ cia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I rose for Bron@@ zer &#91; to 140 pounds &#93; , but I am not so big . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I am small for 140 .
I want to get down on light weight .
and it has to move to light weigh@@ ers &#91; 135 pounds &#93; and then we fight .
that is what the fans demand .
let &apos;s give them that . &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ enko agreed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; boxing needs this fight . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Kli@@ mas asked if it should be on pay @-@ per @-@ view , part of a strategy that Lom@@ ach@@ enko must fight with a 135 pound debut in this year to arrange a date in the next summer with Gar@@ cia ( 37 @-@ 0 , 30 kno@@ ck@@ outs ) who also interest in the fight against the winner of Jorge Lin@@ ares @-@ Luke Camp@@ bell according to their lightweight title fight in the Forum on September 23 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this fight could take place in pay @-@ per @-@ view mode because all fans asked him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gar@@ cia and later expressed himself openly to fight on the network offering the best financial package . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are the best .
no other names can create this kind of attention .
whenever they are ready ... &quot;
Gar@@ cia said he sets Lom@@ ach@@ enko as &quot; an enormous figh@@ ter , &quot; and he might be part of his Saturday fight .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but Lom@@ ach@@ enko said with the generous praise for Gar@@ cia and said he &apos;s thinking the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tri@@ athlon Champion from River@@ side &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is very slow , I &apos;m sorry Mik@@ ey ... you wanted the co @-@ off . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gar@@ cia said , the focus was to show head@@ strong , then boxes .
both said they could feel the momentum that developed for their own struggle .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the battle that needs to be carried out . &quot; &quot; &quot;
no other fight creates so much attention and enthusiasm .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I am more than happy to work on it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gar@@ cia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I waited for the top fighters and that &apos;s Mik@@ ey . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it will be a great fight . &quot;
four injured after tire fl@@ ashes
in an accident on the A7 , four people were severely injured on Thursday afternoon .
after the first information , the driver of a Opel Z@@ af@@ ira was lost at 16.@@ 30 o &apos;clock in front of the market width presum@@ ably after a tyre plat@@ ter control over his vehicle .
the passenger to@@ wed to the right into the em@@ bank@@ ment , where he over@@ took and then stood on the roof in the grass strip .
the four occup@@ ants - two adults and two children - were severely injured during the accident .
during the first supply of the injured by the rescue service , the A7 was locked in the north for about an hour , then the traffic on the left road@@ way could be passed by the accident site .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Fort@@ un@@ as Hoffmann : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; turning Chain &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; works better &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after 2 : 2 , Andr@@ e Hoffmann is hoping for the season op@@ ener against Br@@ uns@@ wick that optimi@@ zes the def@@ ensive formation in Au@@ e points .
with the first seasonal game , Andr@@ e Hoffmann was satisfied , with the result too , there would not have been the two opponents at 2 : 2 against Braunschweig .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these were two opponents too much , and we need to fit better in Au@@ e , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the def@@ ensive player from Fort@@ una Düsseldorf . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the Or@@ e Mountains the three @-@ dimensional chain is to be further optimized .
and a gate after a free shot , the fa@@ un@@ ners don &apos;t want to catch anymore .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the future it will be so that no one stands on the line alongside Michael ( R@@ ens@@ ing ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hoffmann is convinced that his team will also perform better after the experience in preparation with the triple chain than with the quad @-@ chain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know how we will act in Au@@ e , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says his trainer Fried@@ helm Funk@@ el , but Hoffmann is sure of his thing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because we have just been able to build on the semi @-@ positions in Ka@@ an Ay@@ han and Nik@@ o G@@ ieß@@ el@@ mann players who can build well , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hoffmann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a prerequisite is , however , that we are even better harmon@@ ising and we don &apos;t afford to do so many play@@ things in building up . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
of course Hoffmann also goes to Au@@ e to win the game .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but if you cannot speak of a mis@@ erable start , you don &apos;t know . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the performance could be okay , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hoffmann said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but if we can take four points on Sunday and concentrate on the cup , we will surely be able to speak of a regular season op@@ ener . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his trainer wanted to know nothing about that .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I judge the start into the season only after six to eight game days , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fried@@ helm Funk@@ el , who doesn &apos;t want to talk about an advantage over Au@@ e just because the game of Saxony in Hei@@ den@@ heim had to be broken pre@@ mat@@ urely for an accident . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now they can start the season virtually with a home game , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Funk@@ el and Hoffmann , that the players from Au@@ e might even be a little fresh@@ er , since they had no heavy and complete game like Fort@@ una against an asc@@ ension favourite in the bones . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but they do not know as 100 percent where they are currently standing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the Interior Minister of Fort@@ una . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although the guest from the Rhin@@ eland is a light favorite on Sunday in the meeting at last ( almost ) finished stadium of Au@@ e .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that we swe@@ ep them away , just because we have the right to come under the first six , is stup@@ id , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Funk@@ el , whose balance sheet is quite positive with only one defeat against Au@@ e out of nine games . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no team in the 2nd Bundes@@ liga , which must be hit from the out@@ set , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Fort@@ un@@ as chief coach . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; meeting such a statement would be arrogan@@ t and arrogan@@ t . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and so Funk@@ el wants to experience his players on Sunday in no case .
new Results of the Swedish Asyl@@ um Evaluation Review submitted
the latest results of tests for asylum seek@@ ers in Sweden , who have under@@ gone a new method for assess@@ ing their age , show that more than 80 percent of the tested people are older than 18 years . but not everyone believes in the accuracy of these results .
the Swedish authorities for For@@ en@@ sic Medicine ( sovi@@ et medic@@ in@@ al@@ ver@@ ket ) started the tests last year .
they are to take a closer look at the assessment of the age during the asylum procedure after the Swedish Migration Authority ( Mig@@ r@@ ations@@ ver@@ ket ) has been critic@@ ised for errors in assess@@ ing the correct age of some refugees who were under@@ age .
until today , Mig@@ r@@ ations@@ ver@@ ket has sent 6,@@ 880 to test cases and the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency has now published the results of a total of 2,@@ 481 tests from the period from mid @-@ March to 31 July 2017 .
eigh@@ ty percent ( 2002 ) were assessed as 18 or older , while in other 25 cases the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency assessed that the person was &quot; possibly 18 years or older . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in 432 cases the conclusion was that the person &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; possibly under 18 years old &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the tests are conducted only in cases where the age of the person is question@@ ed .
according to Johan Gö@@ ran@@ sson from the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency , the results are consistent with the past months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t see a big difference in the statistics of the past months , the numbers are pretty constant , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said the journal The Local . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the high proportion of cases in which the person was judged for over 18 years does not necessarily mean that the asylum seeker has lied over his age .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in May the agency published the results of 581 tests and said that there are 442 cases that suggest that the examined person is 18 years or older . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when the newspaper S@@ ven@@ ska Dag@@ bla@@ det examined the 581 results , she found that in 243 of these cases the person had openly said that she was 18 years old this year .
the method of the medical grade assessment , when X @-@ ray images of wisdom teeth and M@@ RI sc@@ ans are made of knee joints , which are then analyzed by denti@@ sts and radi@@ ologists , was also crit@@ ici@@ zed in some areas .
a sc@@ ep@@ tic is the endo@@ cr@@ in@@ ologist Claude Marcus of the Kar@@ ol@@ in@@ ska Institute , whose work involves assess@@ ing the biological maturity of people in order to see if they went sooner or later than usual through pu@@ ber@@ ty .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had reason to think about it and I don &apos;t think the type of measurement should be used . &quot; &quot; &quot;
jud@@ ging the biological age in this way is very uns@@ af@@ e .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if we cannot say it , we should not pret@@ end as if we could , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said the newspaper Metro . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , Gö@@ ran@@ sson from the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency def@@ ended the accuracy of the tests : &quot; in general , you can say that the risk of assess@@ ing a child as an adult is low .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the greatest risk is when the person is under 18 , in this case this is about 10 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
fully in the Plan
the work on the three bridges of the road 108 between Lau@@ ter@@ bach and Sch@@ ram@@ berg is progres@@ sing well .
on Wednesday , a seven tons of heavy concrete was installed on the bridge at the eastern outskirts of Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are very good at the time , it runs great , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Rein@@ hold Lei@@ cht , building manager at the department of road and traffic in the governing district of Freiburg . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the same time , the work began at the same time on all three rehabil@@ itated bridges between Sch@@ ram@@ berg and Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
the building is scheduled for October and Ligh@@ tweight is sure the schedule is respected .
the first bridge , coming from Sch@@ ram@@ berg , leads across the Tro@@ mb@@ ach .
it is a rain@@ bow bridge made of concrete , which is covered with red Bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein and has a total length of 4.@@ 80 metres .
it was built in 1900 .
like the two other bridges , it has now come into the years .
in order to ensure stability and road safety , the three structures are now thoroughly rehabil@@ itated .
the two other bridges lead over the Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
they are made of red Bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein .
both were built in 1939 and are twelve , respectively 60 metres long .
the bridge at the entrance of Lau@@ ter@@ bach has now obtained a 1,30 meter wide and seven tons heavy so @-@ called bridge cap on Wednesday morning on the north side .
this is a side mounting , which is also used as an operating path .
on the southern part of the bridge a 2.20 meters wide bridge cap is to be used on Friday .
then the pedestrian wal@@ k@@ way is supposed to pass .
the special thing is that there are finished parts , a patent of the Sch@@ ram@@ berger company Di@@ zw@@ o .
the other two bridges are already equipped with the patented bridge caps .
particular finger @-@ tip feeling has required the laying of cables through the building in Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
because there is also a fiber cable connected to which many companies are connected .
the residents were informed about the project in advance of the work .
in addition , fish and cru@@ st@@ ace@@ ans had to be cut off at first .
for bridges between the building site and the collective farm in the direction of Sch@@ ram@@ berg , traffic is regulated by a traffic light gauge .
for construction work on the bridge at the Lau@@ ter@@ bacher village entrance , the road in the area of the bridge at the level of the hotel &quot; Tann@@ en@@ hof &quot; and &quot; Seven Lin@@ den &quot; is completely closed .
the cost of the three bridge denom@@ inations amount to 700 000 euros .
the whole is financed through the country .
Af@@ D in Ger@@ ol@@ stein : b@@ unter Prot@@ est at German potato salad
it is not so common that parties draw on a strand , but when it comes to the alternative for Germany ( Af@@ D ) , it comes together , which is otherwise difficult to put under a hat .
the parties represented in the Cre@@ ist@@ ag Vulkan@@ ei@@ fel ( C@@ DU , SPD , Green , F@@ DP , F@@ WG , Left ) belong to a broad alliance , which will show peace@@ fully on that day , because the Af@@ D invites Ron@@ delle in the Ger@@ ol@@ st@@ einer Stadthalle in Ron@@ dell , according to the poster &quot; Great Elec@@ tive Action op@@ ener . &quot;
and familiar names to the start - like Alice Wei@@ del , who together with Alexander Gau@@ land forms the top duo for the German elections on September 24 , and the dep@@ uty chairman Beat@@ rix of Stor@@ ch .
but those who are on the spot already hours before the start of the event do not want to listen to the Af@@ D artists , but demonstrate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the motto &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Eifel remains colourful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; originally the city picnic under the motto &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; All at a table &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is planned on the fountain square , but now takes place on the parking lot below the Ron@@ d@@ ells - and thus directly in front of the eyes of those who come to the Af@@ D event in the Stadthalle . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a colorful picture that offers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and what Christ@@ a Kar@@ oli , Chair@@ woman of the Forum A world and one of the author@@ itative organizers , is pleased : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; great how many people have come together here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are music and lots of food , among them a &quot; original potato salad , which could also eat Af@@ D without any problems , &quot; says the woman who brought him .
the police ordered many officials to Ger@@ ol@@ stein , it shows presence especially at the train station , which is only a few metres from the venues .
how is Af@@ D actually come to Ger@@ ol@@ stein ?
Mario Hom@@ pes reports from Af@@ D Vulkan@@ ei@@ fel , he tried to make such an event and get the supplement .
the 45 @-@ year @-@ old from G@@ ön@@ ner@@ sdorf had first asked in Dau@@ n , but there was a rejection , because because of the already built @-@ up Laur@@ enti@@ us church there were not enough parking available .
so now the Ron@@ dell , Hom@@ pes is happy that &quot; we can have such a nice event here . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; with a view of the event on the Ron@@ d@@ ell@@ platz , he says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the good right of the people , the main thing , it remains peaceful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this also does it : at 8@@ pm on Ron@@ d@@ ell@@ platz is a band for entertainment , in the Stadthalle diverse speakers , including the Rhin@@ eland @-@ pf@@ äl@@ z@@ ische Af@@ D @-@ Chair@@ woman Uwe Junge .
in the hall there are about 200 list@@ eners who are waiting for the Spitz@@ enk@@ an@@ di@@ dat@@ in for the German elections , Alice Wei@@ del , and the dep@@ uty chairman Beat@@ rix of Stor@@ ch .
the police presence remains unchanged , but so far the officials had a quiet evening .
a little more than an hour the Af@@ D event lasts , the guests on the fore@@ court have a longer breath , but there is also short after 21 o &apos;clock .
the police can back - no special inci@@ dents .
tro@@ mb@@ one meets trumpet
a listening to the Wolf@@ acher Pos@@ aun@@ ist Freder@@ ic B@@ elli is available in the row of Has@@ l@@ acher Kloster@@ konzer@@ te tomorrow , Sunday at 8 pm in the Kloster@@ kirche .
&quot; &quot; &quot; together with the Bulgarian trumpet Mi@@ ros@@ lav Pet@@ kov , he gives a concert under the motto &quot; Black Sea &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Balkan fol@@ klore &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; meets classical German training with roots in brass music . &quot; &quot; &quot;
both solo@@ ists are winners and pri@@ ze@@ winners of numerous international competitions and have held solo positions in European top orchest@@ ras .
so Pet@@ kov Sol@@ ot@@ ro@@ mp@@ eter is at the renowned Concer@@ t@@ geb@@ ou@@ w Orchestra Amsterdam and Freder@@ ic B@@ elli is the solo@@ ist of the SW@@ R Symphony Orchestra .
both unite the desire not only to cross borders on their instruments , but also to merge the boundaries of the different gen@@ res .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Johann Sebastian Bach sounds like in a new gu@@ ise , Daniel Schn@@ y@@ der &apos;s &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; world music &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; combines with Bulgarian fol@@ klore , and in the piece &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Exchange Suite &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the J@@ az@@ ze@@ ch@@ op@@ re@@ ist@@ rä@@ gers N@@ ils W@@ ogram , classical , jazz and free games blend into an intri@@ gu@@ ing Gesamt@@ kunst@@ werk . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this core of the program was first performed this spring with huge success in Freiburg .
the renowned composer N@@ ils W@@ ogram has written it especially for the two musicians and more : the Has@@ l@@ acher Kloster@@ kirche and its special acou@@ stics are consciously incorporated into the concert .
K@@ risten Ste@@ wart speaks about her bis@@ exu@@ ality
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some people love gr@@ illed che@@ eses and will eat it to the end of their lives . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but I want to try everything , &quot; says K@@ risten Ste@@ wart openly about her bis@@ exu@@ ality .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once I bite into gr@@ illed cheese , I think : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Oh that was cool , what comes next ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the probably best @-@ known relationship of Hollywood stars was that of her &quot; twi@@ light &quot; colleague Robert P@@ att@@ inson , which ultimately became bitter .
despite all this , the brun@@ ette Dar@@ stell@@ erin is insured against the &quot; Har@@ per &apos;s B@@ az@@ aar &quot; magazine : &quot; I was seriously in love with anyone I had been .
&quot; &quot; &quot; or do you think I have played it ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; after their separation , K@@ risten admitted that she was bis@@ ex@@ ual : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have always lived and seriously believed in du@@ alism . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so it has never been confused or ham@@ per@@ ed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I only liked it to be taken seriously . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in particular , they suffered according to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; B@@ ang Show@@ biz &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but during the school period when they preferred to dress like a boy : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not all girls are typical girls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this really hurt me .
when I was eleven , the children told me , I would look like a bu@@ b .
I really felt attacked , fri@@ ghtened and ashamed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; now I look back and think : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; girl , be proud of you ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
especially the public doesn &apos;t like to declare their love life : &quot; people expect you to settle in a certain way and that anno@@ ys me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and perhaps some call me un@@ grateful , but I don &apos;t like to justify myself before the whole public . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Gover@@ nor of West Virginia announces that he changes the party
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the democratic governor of West Virginia , Jim Justice , announced Thursday evening with a rally with President Tr@@ ump that he would change the party . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; whether you like it or not , the Democrats have been removed from me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gover@@ nor Justice . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; today I will tell you a lot of prayers and a lot of re@@ thinking ... today I will tell you as a resident of West Virginia , I can &apos;t help you if I &apos;m a democratic governor . &quot;
the rally broke out in jubil@@ ation .
&quot; tomorrow I will change my registration to the re@@ public@@ ans , &quot; Justice added .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a trainer , I would say it &apos;s time to play another game . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mr. Tr@@ ump announced a great announcement at the West Virginia rally .
Mr. Tr@@ ump won West Virginia with 42 points , and Justice did not endor@@ se the democratic candidate H@@ illary Clinton .
Justice , who according to For@@ bes is the only bil@@ li@@ on@@ aire in the state , was elected in 2016 .
For@@ bes states that he has coal mines in five states , and has inher@@ ited a coal store by his father .
it is worth about $ 1.@@ 59 billion .
in the interim , the Republi@@ can National Committee on Thursday evening gave an explanation in which it said : &quot; the party change of Gover@@ nor Justice is another blow to a Democratic Party that would rather hin@@ der us than to make our country magnificent . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with only 15 govern@@ ors and the control of the least legislative bodies in history , the announcement of Gover@@ nor Justice is only the last ref@@ usal of a party which is from top to bottom without guidance and unable to find a positive , uni@@ fying message , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said R@@ onna CEO R@@ onna Mc@@ Daniel in an explanation of the C@@ BS News . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Co@@ E pra@@ ises &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; honest &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Russian exc@@ use for dop@@ ing sc@@ andal &quot; &quot; &quot;
the world leader of Ath@@ le@@ tics , Sebastian Co@@ e , praised on Thursday what he described as an apparent exc@@ use from Russia to a dop@@ ing sc@@ andal , but he repeated it was not the moment for the country to resu@@ me the sport .
Russian athle@@ tics boss D@@ mit@@ ry Sh@@ yl@@ ak@@ ht@@ in said during the IA@@ AF congress on the eve of the Ath@@ le@@ tics World Championships that the exile of his country was correct and that he was determined to fight dop@@ ing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said it is sorry for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; All athletes , who were cut away from competitions gold and silver med@@ als . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
despite his comments , the IA@@ AF congress voted for the maintenance of the ban imposed in November 2015 after a report from the World Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing Agency ( WA@@ DA ) had found evidence of state @-@ funded dop@@ ing in Russia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I thought it was a very open reply today , a very honest presentation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said IA@@ AF @-@ President Co@@ e the re@@ por@@ ters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the whole council and the entire congress were delighted that the Russian Federation has realized in itself that it has experienced some rather hot times and will do everything possible to ensure that the Federation is re@@ designed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Co@@ E said he was also &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; delighted &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that Russia accepted the criteria for its re@@ introduction . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think it was a very constructive day , and I think progress has been achieved , but the congress supports the recommendations of the Task Force that this is not the moment to re@@ use Russia , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Co@@ e . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need to do everything in the next few months to norm@@ alize this situation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the guiding principle was always that we wanted to separate the clean ath@@ l@@ ete from the dep@@ ra@@ ved system , &quot; he added
ninet@@ een Russian athletes will compete in the Ath@@ le@@ tics World Championships that start on Friday in London , following the strict IA@@ AF criteria as neutral players .
the head of IA@@ AF @-@ Task Force , R@@ une Ander@@ sen , said on Monday that Russia had to meet some of the criteria for a re @-@ setting .
drug tests are still in@@ adequate and prohibited trainers are still free , he said re@@ por@@ ters in London after a lecture at IA@@ AF Council .
mour@@ ning for Mali , crashed soldiers
at a fun@@ eral service in the North H@@ essi@@ an Fr@@ itz@@ lar around 1,000 people of the two were thinking about a helicop@@ ter crash in Mali .
the ceremony took place on Thursday in the cathedral city under high security measures .
in order to still un@@ explained , Secretary of Defense , Ursula von der Ley@@ en ( C@@ DU ) said nothing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they described the two inver@@ ted pil@@ ots as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; experts of their expertise &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we bow to the highest sacrifice they have provided in the name of the Federal Republic of Germany , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she explained . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 33 @-@ year @-@ old Major and the 47 @-@ year @-@ old stab@@ le@@ man from Northern h@@ essen came to life on Wednesday a week in the West African Mali .
her coff@@ ins were transferred to Germany and , on Thursday , accompanied by a dead@@ ly wa@@ che of the Bundes@@ wehr in the Fr@@ itz@@ lar cathedral Sankt Peter .
at noon , only the families in the church took leave .
after that the fun@@ eral service started in the circle of the family , close friends , representatives of the Bundes@@ wehr as well as politics .
among them were H@@ ess@@ ens Prime Minister Volker Bou@@ ff@@ ier ( C@@ DU ) and the general inspec@@ tor of the German army Volker Wi@@ eker .
sad@@ ly laid down ro@@ ses , the relatives were arm in arm on the coff@@ ins .
in front of the church , Fr@@ itz@@ lar and numerous soldiers persec@@ uted the ceremony on a canvas .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Secretary of Defense of the Ley@@ en signed the in@@ verse soldiers as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; highly decorated &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and sat@@ in . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Stab@@ sh@@ aup@@ t@@ mann built the flying operation of the combat helicop@@ ter Tiger in Fr@@ itz@@ lar and was one of the first six educated tiger pil@@ ots of his reg@@ iment .
Volker Bau@@ ers@@ inn , commander of the reg@@ iment , to which the soldiers are , said : &quot; if this occupation could not turn off the crash , nobody would have liked it . &quot;
doubt about the UN mission in Mali , Minister of the Ley@@ en did not show : the deployment was dangerous .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but it is also of great importance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a country from which we are separated only by two states , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the fun@@ eral ceremony , the coff@@ ins were brought out of the cathedral .
when and where they are buried , the Bundes@@ wehr did not provide any information .
Prinz Hen@@ rik does not want a grave next to his wife
the man of the Danish queen Mar@@ gre@@ the ( 77 ) , prince Hen@@ rik ( 83 ) , will not be buried next to his wife after his death .
that shared the Royal House on Thursday with .
traditionally , the Danish royal couple is buried in the Dom@@ kirche of Ros@@ kil@@ de .
the sculp@@ tor Bj@@ ør@@ n N@@ ør@@ ga@@ ard already made a sar@@ cop@@ h@@ ag@@ us for the two .
the Queen agreed with her husband &apos;s decision , she said further in the message .
where Prince Hen@@ rik is buried , be still un@@ clear .
but he did not intend to be buried in his French homeland .
Prince Hen@@ rik had never made a secret that he was not happy with his title .
after the accession of his wife Mar@@ gre@@ the in 1972 he would have liked to become king .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in 2016 he retired and also lays down the title &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Prinz@@ reg@@ ahl &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since Hen@@ rik in Denmark did not get the title and the function he wanted , he couldn &apos;t see himself as equivalent to his wife - even after death , L@@ ene B@@ alle@@ by , who was chief spokes@@ person of the Danish king &apos;s house .
where the last resting place of the 83 @-@ year @-@ old will ultimately be , be still un@@ clear .
but he did not intend to be buried in his French homeland , but in Denmark .
he likes the country for which he has worked in the last 50 years .
Henri de Labor@@ de de Mon@@ pe@@ z@@ at , son of a French noble family , met Mar@@ gre@@ the 1965 in London .
he worked in the French emb@@ assy on the Th@@ ames .
during his later wife the sympath@@ ies of the people always flo@@ pped , Prince Hen@@ rik had a heavy standing in his nearly fifty @-@ year @-@ old reign with the Dan@@ es .
in an auto@@ biography , Hen@@ rik commented on the first years in Denmark : &quot; a few months after my arrival everything I did was crit@@ ici@@ zed .
my Danish was sw@@ aying , I preferred wine instead of beer , silk stock@@ ings instead of kn@@ itting so@@ cks , Citro@@ ë@@ n instead of Volvo , tennis instead of football .
even for the Gau@@ lo@@ ises that I smo@@ ked instead of Virginia tobacco and who had the reputation of being the brand of socio @-@ critical intellec@@ tu@@ als , I could not hope to hope .
I was different .
I seemed to be happy with this position and not ashamed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; these were two mistakes ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Minister @-@ President Wei@@ l wants rapid re @-@ election
C@@ DU and F@@ DP against possible majority in Lower Saxony
after the loss of red @-@ green government majority for a swi@@ ft re @-@ election of parliament , Lower Saxony &apos;s Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) does not want to withdraw .
because I spoke on Friday for the resolution of parliament .
prior to that , the surprising withdrawal of a Green Party from its Land@@ tag fraction in Lower Saxony had over@@ thrown the government of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) into a severe crisis .
five months before the official date of the country election , the red @-@ green coalition in Hanover lost its scar@@ ce one @-@ vote majority in parliament to the opposition from C@@ DU and F@@ DP .
the former Gre@@ ens El@@ ke T@@ westen combined their step with the non @-@ nom@@ ination for the 2018 election in their constitu@@ ency in Rot@@ enburg ( W@@ ü@@ mme ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I see my political future in C@@ DU , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she explained on Friday in Hanover . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; C@@ DU faction leader Björn Th@@ üm@@ ler wants to recommend his group to record it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
thus C@@ DU and F@@ DP would have 69 seats in the Lower Saxon Parliament , SPD and Green 68 seats .
so far the ratio was revers@@ ed .
the new Land@@ tag will be voted on 14 January next year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; red @-@ green &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; government now has to decide whether or not to gover@@ n this situation without a majority . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , Stephan Wei@@ l remains un@@ think@@ able that the Parliament quickly resol@@ ves his self @-@ resolution as quickly as possible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the C@@ DU group is expected to decide on their further action on Tuesday .
the Constitution also provides the possibility that the Land@@ tag does not depri@@ ve the Prime Minister and cho@@ oses a successor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our constitution offers several options . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; these possibilities must be examined legally , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said sums . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will discuss all questions in peace if they are legally tested . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; cost@@ um@@ ers called T@@ western &apos;s step &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but something curious . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the politicians themselves stressed : &quot; I am not a tra@@ itor .
I feel very good . &quot;
she described himself as a trailer of black @-@ green .
the Gre@@ ens called for the rebel@@ li@@ ous dep@@ u@@ ties for the return of their parliament mandate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we , of course , assume that she has received immediate effect on the Green National List with immediate effect , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the presi@@ dents Met@@ a Jan@@ ssen @-@ Ku@@ cz and Stefan Kör@@ ner shared with them . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the presi@@ dents of the Green Anja P@@ iel said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we deeply regret the decision of El@@ ke T@@ westen excell@@ ently . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she has deliberately decided not to lead any pron@@ unci@@ ation in the Group . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even against the background that there were no substan@@ tive differences , we cannot compreh@@ end this step . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
SPD chan@@ cell@@ or Martin Schulz condem@@ ns the transfer of the lower Saxon Green @-@ Members El@@ ke T@@ westen to the C@@ DU as betra@@ yal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the behavior of the former Green @-@ Members in Lower Saxony is not only betra@@ yal of the elec@@ torate and vot@@ ers but also betra@@ yal of red @-@ green &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; wrote the Social Democrats &quot; Bund@@ esch@@ ef on Friday on Facebook . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he supports the decision of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) to quickly elect the Parliament .
the exit T@@ west@@ ens costs red @-@ green in Lower Saxony the majority .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the politicians &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in their enti@@ re@@ ty van@@ ity and in their fru@@ stration &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; their personal interests before the welfare of the country , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said SPD @-@ General Hubertus Heil . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a sc@@ andal that the C@@ DU in Lower Saxony particip@@ ates in this dirty intri@@ gue and tries to strike political capital from it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Lower Saxony &apos;s C@@ DU faction leader Björn Th@@ üm@@ ler wants to recommend his dep@@ u@@ ties to take the El@@ ke T@@ westen into the C@@ DU . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the leader of the SPD in the German Bundestag , Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , threw T@@ westen before , with a personal career to fal@@ si@@ fy the outcome of the 2013 country election .
the C@@ DU was at that time the strongest force in the SPD and the Gre@@ ens in the Land@@ tag but a very thin majority of one vote .
Minister of Agriculture in the Interview - How do we protect ourselves from po@@ isons , Mr. Schmidt ?
Germany disc@@ usses about contamin@@ ated eggs .
how could the sc@@ andal happen ?
how can consumers protect themselves ?
Minister of Agriculture Christian Schmidt ( CS@@ U ) is in an interview with the editorial network Germany ( R@@ ND ) speech and answer .
Mr. Schmidt , how can the consumer protect himself from po@@ is@@ oned eggs ?
I can only encourage all consumers to look at the eggs in your refrigerator and check the stamp pressure .
on the Consumer Protection portal www.@@ Lebensmittel@@ war@@ n@@ ung@@ .de , the federal states provide the latest information on the affected egg bat@@ ches .
affected eggs should be destroyed or returned .
even if after all we currently know , a health haz@@ ard is practically excluded .
now Al@@ di takes over the best possible crisis reaction - all eggs out of the offer - because the central role of the clar@@ i@@ fier is not really perceived by the German Minister of Agriculture ?
food monitoring is the task of the federal states .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless my house has turned off immediately and since the announcement of Germany &apos;s concern is in close contact with the authorities of the countries . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all information and risk assessment are available for consumers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; trade has as well as the manufacturers to ensure that the sold @-@ out products are market@@ able and harm@@ less to health . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if the resi@@ dual value of 0,@@ 00@@ 5mg / kg is exceeded with eggs , these are not rush @-@ capable .
un@@ loaded eggs can however be sold and consumed .
this time the farms are not to blame .
do production plants and consumers sit in the same boat ?
after the time of knowledge , the production companies do not have an immediate fault .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rather , they must reck@@ on with economic damages due to presum@@ ed illegal practice of service companies . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as always , there is too little control over the harvest .
is it missing only at the personnel or even at the concl@@ usive jurisdiction ?
there were just the official controls that have revealed the process .
the truth is , however , that food fraud and criminal energy can never be excluded 100 per cent .
this is precisely why a consistent clar@@ ification of such events and the surrender to the prosec@@ ut@@ ors in cases where crimes can prevail , are of decisive importance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have already told many times that I expect a complete clar@@ ification from the responsible authorities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
is regular al@@ ar@@ mis@@ m really necessary in food sc@@ and@@ als ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; consumers have the right to only get safe and market@@ able food . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if a non @-@ approved in@@ sec@@ ti@@ ci@@ de is used in the food industry , consumers are ri@@ ghtly ou@@ trag@@ ed .
by means of the pan@@ elled means manufacturers , distributors and consumers are in a situation that is absolutely not necessary .
basically , it must be clear : the un@@ lawful use of the in@@ sec@@ ti@@ ci@@ d fi@@ pron@@ il in the attitude of food @-@ safe animals is not acceptable and must be termin@@ ated immediately .
it must be applied consistently and with high pressure on all levels .
I expect all competent authorities that the atomic fact becomes swi@@ ft@@ ly and un@@ broken .
how to affect the financial rules of football on Ne@@ y@@ mar@@ s re@@ location to Paris
the rules aimed at preventing un@@ interrupted issues of European football clubs will not distur@@ b Ne@@ y@@ mar@@ s &apos;s world record transfer from Barcelona to the French Paris @-@ Saint Ger@@ main .
any consequences will come to Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main of UEF@@ A , as the guiding organisation that super@@ vis@@ es the European game has the power to ban teams from access to the prestigious Champions League tournament .
financial fair play rules launched in 2011 by the UEF@@ A mean that at some point it must prove that the transfer of Ne@@ ym@@ ar was financed without major losses .
Barcelona has paid 222 million euros ( 262 million dollars ) to extract the Brazilian from its contract , and Ne@@ ym@@ ar will receive a sal@@ ary that will amount to tens of tens of millions of dollars a year .
here are some of the financial aspects of Ne@@ y@@ mar@@ s &apos;s move to France .
PSG can make the money loose , so that Ne@@ ym@@ ar will sign and bring him into a galax@@ y of other stars , given the financing of the team by the power @-@ rich family of Qatar .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; clubs may spend a lot of money on the acquisition of players , but they have to counter@@ act legitimate revenue streams , which allow them to take the break @-@ even point in their football @-@ related business . &quot; &quot; &quot;
FF@@ P was designed by Michel Plat@@ ini after his election to the UEF@@ A President in 2007 .
the former French player believed that clubs , who had taken enormous debt in their quest for success , were effectively decei@@ ving and ris@@ king to ruin if banks or owners with@@ drew their support .
in 2011 , FF@@ P shi@@ fted from concentr@@ ating on the debt of clubs on the monitoring of their losses .
the change meant that the business model that novel Abr@@ amo@@ vich bought in Chelsea in 2003 - bought a club with potential and then invested heavily to improve the team and build a global brand - becoming a harder task .
during the current three @-@ year FF@@ P @-@ shift period , which runs until 2018 , clubs can accept losses in the amount of 30 million euros .
and even though Plat@@ ini has fallen from the presi@@ dency in 2015 , his UEF@@ A successor Aleks@@ ander Ce@@ fer@@ in continues to fri@@ gh@@ ten excessive spending .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; surely FF@@ P is not dead and we will strengthen the rules for the future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Andrea Tra@@ ver@@ so , who is responsible for the UEF@@ A for FF@@ P , compared to The Associ@@ ated Press in the past week . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although the PSG has paid the Buy @-@ out cl@@ ause of Ne@@ ym@@ ar in a package , it can distribute the amount for invo@@ icing over the duration of his contract .
Ne@@ ym@@ ar has signed a five @-@ year contract so that the revenue streams for the next five years can be reported in the amount of 4@@ 4.1 million euros in the financial statements .
the first wave of FF@@ P sanctions in 2014 , together with Abu Dhabi , which is owned by Manchester City , has hit the he@@ avi@@ est sanctions .
the PSG received a fine of 60 million Euros ( 82 million dollars ) , which was later reduced to € 20 million - and it was arranged that the team members for the Champions League of the 2014 / 15 season will be limited to 21 players instead of the usual 25 players .
UEF@@ A is looking for clubs that could try to super@@ se@@ ct their financial supervision by bl@@ ending their income through companies connected with the owners of a club .
while a cat@@ ar@@ ic company might sponsor the PSG if the value of sponsor@@ ship should exceed the standard market rates , UEF@@ A would not be considered legitimate income .
this was exactly what happened in 2014 when the UEF@@ A decided that the value of the sponsor@@ ship of the PS@@ A was infl@@ ated by the Qatar Tourism Authority .
it was reported that a part of the PSG payments to Ne@@ ym@@ ar could come to Qatar about payments of the World Cup 2022 .
but PSG and Qatar 2022 have argu@@ ed that Ne@@ ym@@ ar World Cup amb@@ ass@@ ad@@ ors will be and could easily find out such a man@@ oeu@@ vre for the UEF@@ A regul@@ ators .
the previous sanctions against PSG involve that UEF@@ A will be more attentive to ob@@ serving each attempt to circum@@ vent the rules .
the UEF@@ A had no prepar@@ atory discussions with PSG via Ne@@ y@@ mar@@ s Transfer , on Thursday the people familiar with the situation .
they talked about the condition of anon@@ ym@@ ity with The Associ@@ ated Press , as they were not authorized to discuss the PSG situation .
the latest published reports show that PSG 2015 / 16 achieved a profit of more than 10 million euros with a turnover of € 54@@ 2.4 million .
accounts for the last fiscal year must be published .
PSG anticip@@ ates that Ne@@ y@@ mar@@ s arrival is a blessing for sponsor@@ ing deals , merchan@@ dis@@ ing and tri@@ cot selling .
the association assumes that sales after the signature will rise by at least 30 percent .
the Spanish League was clearly irrit@@ ated to see one of the best football players , and she tried to prevent Ne@@ y@@ mar@@ s pulling away by claiming that PSG would hurt the FF@@ P .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a clear case of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; financial Dop@@ ing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the club and the state , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the President of the League , J@@ avier T@@ eb@@ as , the Spanish daily AS in relation to Qatar &apos;s final ownership . &quot; &quot; &quot;
ar@@ sen@@ al @-@ Manager Arsen@@ e Wen@@ ger , whose association is owned by an American sport @-@ ty@@ co@@ on , divi@@ des the reservations of La Liga against a state financed by an association .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is the consequence of the owners and that has completely changed the whole landscape of football in the past 15 years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger on Thursday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once a country has an association , everything is possible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it will be very difficult to respect the financial Fair@@ play because you have different ways or may have different interests if a country has such a big player to represent a country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Swiss is looking for a new g@@ og@@ ging supplier
in recent years , Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y has produced chocolate for Swiss .
now the sweet cooperation is in front of a potential end : the airline re@@ signs the order .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Swiss spokes@@ person Mei@@ ke Fu@@ hl@@ rott confirmed on request of the news agency s@@ da an appropriate report of the newspaper &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Nord@@ west@@ schwei@@ z &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to current plans , the airline will conclude a new contract in the first half of 2018 .
the products were checked every two or three years and subjected to quality control .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the current supplier Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y , we are very satisfied &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said the spokes@@ person . &quot; &quot; &quot;
approx . 17 million small rot@@ orange sealed scrap panels spread to 14 grams per year before landing to the passengers .
Swiss did not want to provide any information about the costs .
industry insi@@ ders estimate the volume of orders according to &quot; Nord@@ west@@ schwei@@ z &quot; to 1.5 to 2 million Swiss francs - Mig@@ ros subsidiary achieves an annual turnover of approximately one billion Swiss francs .
but more important is always the advertising effect : it is a prestigious order for a sound manufacturer .
Swiss will not want to betra@@ y Swiss as many applicants with the new tender .
however , only Swiss manufacturers come into question .
according to the newspaper article Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y wants to make an effort to ren@@ ew the contract beyond spring 2018 .
for the s@@ da , the biggest Swiss chocolate manufacturer was not available for an opinion .
Swiss cho@@ col@@ ates spread the Swiss since 2006 on board their flights .
before Swiss concluded a contract with Mig@@ ros subsidiary , Bar@@ ry C@@ alle@@ baut has delivered the chocolate tablet in collaboration with Hu@@ g .
the possibility to place the logo led Swiss two and a half years ago with the start of collaboration with Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y .
the airline operates with different Swiss chocolate producers .
on long @-@ hau@@ l flights the customers of the First Class are spoiled with le@@ aks from the Con@@ fis@@ erie Spr@@ ün@@ gli , in Business Class , passengers Sch@@ og@@ gi from Lin@@ dt and Economy Class Sch@@ og@@ gi from Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y .
also on the short @-@ hau@@ l , Swiss sch@@ og@@ gi distri@@ butes Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y , both in Business and Economy Class .

N@@ ost@@ alg@@ ie goes into &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer &quot; and &quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; in the niche
this repet@@ ition of history is at the same time no@@ stal@@ gic because of the glorious days of characters of the 80 @-@ ies , for the 90 @-@ year @-@ Gr@@ unge era ( when the pione@@ ers David W@@ ain and Michael Sho@@ walter turned the sketch com@@ edy &quot; The State &quot; for M@@ TV ) , and for himself - that is , for 2001 , before their stars , like Elizabeth B@@ anks , Amy Po@@ eh@@ ler and Paul Ru@@ dd went to bigger things .
as a cultural arti@@ fact , it is equally a par@@ ody and em@@ bodi@@ ment of our Facebook @-@ capable era permanent memories .
but as fran@@ chise it feels like the time is scar@@ ce .
&quot; first Day of Camp &quot; worked surprisingly well , not only because of his absurd hum@@ or ( it contained an original story for a promising can of vegetables , which was spoken by H. Jon Benjamin ) .
by p@@ aving at the core of the g@@ ags - middle @-@ aged actors play hor@@ ny children that grow up - they nevertheless managed to win the last part of the W@@ itz@@ es .
&quot; ten Years L@@ ater , &quot; with his adults who now play adults , is less emotion@@ ally rooted and his par@@ ody goes more to the found@@ ry &apos;s prin@@ cipl@@ ed , among them a riff on the Stal@@ ker films of the 90 @-@ ies like &quot; The Hand That Ro@@ cks the Cr@@ adle &quot; ( &quot; Die Hand , die die Wie@@ ge &quot; ) .
at one point , a character has a character through an Apple Power@@ book , some inline sk@@ ates and &quot; a number of other things from 1991 . &quot;
many of the central stories are the same .
the ami@@ able C@@ oop ( Mr. Sho@@ walter ) , now nov@@ aut@@ or , has not forgotten K@@ atie ( Mar@@ gu@@ er@@ ite Mo@@ reau ) .
Victor ( K@@ en Marino ) has still not lost his vir@@ g@@ inity .
and there is another crazy bunch of P@@ lot , included in the Ronal@@ d Re@@ ag@@ an ( also Mr. Sho@@ walter ) , who is now supported by George H. W. Bush ( a good impression of Michael Ian Black ) .
as always , the courses are the best part of fran@@ chise .
it is especially fun to see the eternal young Mr. Ru@@ dd , who shows Matt D@@ ill@@ ons Unter@@ li@@ ppen@@ bart by &quot; Sing@@ les , &quot; whose former Big @-@ Man @-@ on @-@ Camp Andy feels like an old boy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s the moments of acci@@ dental mad@@ ness that could hei@@ gh@@ ten this fran@@ chise as a sort of repet@@ itive &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Seven Up ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; series until he achieves that which I accepted as his logical conclusion : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer : Tw@@ enty Years L@@ ater &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; whose last scene will show the band how to attend the film premiere of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; on Amazon now re@@ members a different type of no@@ stal@@ gia : to re@@ vit@@ alize the Cold War of &quot; The Americans , &quot; to the film &quot; Atom@@ ic Bl@@ onde &quot; and even to &quot; GLO@@ W &quot; with its East against West ring @-@ war icon@@ ography .
the com@@ edy created by Brian G@@ ate@@ wood and Alessandro Tan@@ aka as a director announces a ti@@ led TV series : a Romanian drama of the eigh@@ ties with the two polic@@ emen as friends , two officers from Buchar@@ est , who are fighting for truth , a@@ the@@ ism and the path of Marxism @-@ Lenin@@ ism .
the main roles - a hard @-@ headed Gregor and an ide@@ alistic I@@ os@@ ef - are played by Flor@@ in Pier@@ sic J@@ r. and Corn@@ eli@@ u u@@ lic@@ i , whose di@@ alogues by Ch@@ anning Tat@@ um ( also an extensive producer ) and Joseph Gordon @-@ Lev@@ itt are du@@ b@@ bed in English .
it is a brilliant idea .
but it is not much more than an idea .
there are some nice g@@ ags to watch ( the police spend the time watching chess on television as Americans might do with football ) .
and the list of famous actors - including J@@ enny Sl@@ ate , Nick offer@@ man , Mah@@ er@@ sh@@ ala Ali and Chlo@@ ë Sev@@ ign@@ y - provides a decent game &apos; Find out the voice &apos; .
but &quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; is so much involved in the tru@@ th@@ fulness of a des@@ perate propaganda drama - a mur@@ derer who carries a Re@@ ag@@ an mask , is involved - that it often plays like one .
there are six long ep@@ iso@@ des , and the com@@ edy is not fast or frequent enough .
&quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective , &quot; which was re@@ acted to a lower length could better deliver his ag@@ it@@ pro@@ p s@@ ati@@ re , since Gregor and I@@ os@@ ef always attend the American emb@@ assy , whose lobby is always occupied by two thick men who dev@@ our a bunch of ham@@ bur@@ gers .
the message for the imag@@ inary communist audience is that Western culture can make everything to feed for a jo@@ ke .
the fic@@ t@@ itious Romanian cre@@ ators were not wrong : we even make it with our own younger history and with thei@@ rs .
blow against drugs Maf@@ ia in the country
the police have succeeded in a blow against the Italian m@@ af@@ ia in Baden @-@ Württemberg .
on Wednesday morning the Schwar@@ zw@@ ald @-@ B@@ aar @-@ Kreis , in Rot@@ tw@@ eil , Con@@ stance , Ess@@ lingen and Stuttgart searches for numerous objects , as the public prosec@@ utor Konstan@@ z communicated on Friday .
at the age of 25 , 15 patients aged 25 and 77 years of age were arrested and already issued arrest warran@@ ts against them .
in addition , the officials set up large quantities of marijuana and co@@ ca@@ ine , fire@@ arms and several hundred thousand euros .
at the same time , two people were arrested in Italy at the same time .
there were German arrest warran@@ ts against the two susp@@ ects .
the two are therefore probably delivered to Germany .
Italian and Bavarian Er@@ mitt@@ ler participated in the action .
altogether over 300 polic@@ emen were in use .
the Maf@@ ia &apos;s members are accused of organised drug crimin@@ ality , heavy violence , trials of murder , rob@@ ber@@ y and black@@ mail .
already in the summer of 2016 , the public prosec@@ utor const@@ ituted Con@@ stance against organised drug traff@@ icking in the south German region .
between the public prosec@@ ut@@ ors in Con@@ stance and Palermo there was a lively exchange and the investig@@ ators of the K@@ rip@@ o Rot@@ tw@@ eil had almost daily contact with their colleagues on Sicily .
therefore , the big effort was accompanied by four officials from Palermo on Wednesday morning .
in the sight of the investigations , Italian nation@@ als were mainly related to the Italian Maf@@ ia .
also an incident on May 27 in Hü@@ fingen , where several shots were fired at a restaurant early in the morning , should go to the bank account .
manner compl@@ ains large g@@ aps in the fore@@ igner @-@ register
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; data from citizens who should not appear there &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : according to a report the fore@@ igner regi@@ sters in Germany shows significant short@@ com@@ ings . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this leads to partly serious mis@@ decisions concerning asylum procedures .
the Commissioner for the Refu@@ ge@@ e Management of the Federal Government , Frank @-@ Jürgen Weise , has report@@ edly paid attention to a media report on large g@@ aps in the fore@@ igner &apos;s register .
&quot; &quot; &quot; short@@ com@@ ings with the data recorded there could lead to partially grave errors in asylum procedures and deport@@ ations , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; warned in an analysis which is the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the regi@@ sters , ten million people with foreign nation@@ ality are recorded in the register , including some 5,@@ 7 million from non @-@ EU states .
the data is therefore managed by approximately 600 foreign nation@@ als in Germany .
because the data has not been adequ@@ ately maintained , data quality has not been good in parts so far .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in individual cases , data from 1921 has been found , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by people who are no longer alive , or of citizens who have become German citizens and should actually no longer appear in the register . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; incorrect data inputs can significantly slow reverse processes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the report further . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the statistics of depar@@ ting people , EU citizens are covered , which would not have to leave . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , such false assign@@ ments led to a dist@@ orted debate on dealing with out@@ going &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; it says accordingly in the analysis . &quot; &quot; &quot;
meanwhile , the federal government apparently started sending refugee families back to Italy with 16 @-@ year @-@ old children when they arrived from there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this emerg@@ es from an internal paper of the Federal Office for Migration and Refu@@ ge@@ es ( BA@@ MF ) , reports the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; New Osn@@ ab@@ rück@@ er Zeitung &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in paper it is said that the BA@@ MF is conducting such procedures &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concerning families with children - with the exception of inf@@ ants and small children - to Italy since 1 June 2017 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the end of 2014 , this was virtually no longer possible , so the newspaper was referring to the difficult situation on site .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the Dublin Trade Agreement , it is responsible for refugees from the EU state which they reach first . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if a mig@@ rant travels to another EU country , this state can send it back to the entry country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the office now has : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the meantime , the recording capacity for families with minor children in Italy has significantly increased . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Italy has given guarantees for the inclusion and accommodation of families . &quot; &quot; &quot;
even the European Court of Human Rights ( EC@@ rt@@ HR ) considers these commitments to be sufficient .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other EU states would also send refugees back in the framework of the Dublin agreement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the internal political spokes@@ person for the left @-@ wing faction in the Bundestag , U@@ lla Jel@@ p@@ ke , crit@@ ici@@ zed this decision : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; families with children thre@@ aten due to the short@@ com@@ ings in the Italian asylum system un@@ lawful conditions and a threat to child welfare . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
second best result achieved
a total of 220 litres of blood of people living in Ober@@ rei@@ chen@@ bach already provided the blood donation service to other people .
at least of the twelve citizens who were honored on Friday .
all of them were Jürgen Gre@@ ule , who meanwhile donated 50 litres of blood with his 100 donations .
traditionally , the municipality in the session of the Municipal Council ackno@@ wle@@ dges the multiple read@@ iness to don@@ ate blood .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is in@@ gen@@ ious how our bodies are laid out for it and we give respect to the don@@ ors who provide their blood for foreigners , still un@@ sel@@ fish@@ ly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Mayor Karl@@ h@@ ein@@ z K@@ ist@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a single blood donation helps several people , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained the Kreis@@ ure@@ leiter of the German Red Cross ( DR@@ K ) , Holger Ma@@ isen@@ bacher , because the cann@@ ed are de@@ composed into their constitu@@ ents . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for example , three people could benefit from a blood donation .
at the same time , Ma@@ isen@@ bacher reported about the actions carried out in Ober@@ rei@@ chen@@ bach in the spring .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this year we achieved the second best result with 114 don@@ ors , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the DR@@ K Kreis@@ ure@@ Manager . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; obviously , the change to the theatre house has led to higher numbers of participants a few years ago . &quot; &quot; &quot;
already before , Thomas Bo@@ ck@@ stadt , Susanne Reich@@ le , Sandra Schö@@ ck , Thomas Reich@@ le and Met@@ a Um@@ beer were among the multiple don@@ ators and were awarded for 50 completed blood donations each .
half of so many , Herbert M@@ air and Dor@@ o@@ thee Ri@@ ex@@ inger , while Tam@@ ara Pf@@ rom@@ mer , Petra Schle@@ eh , Stefanie St@@ oll and Uwe V@@ etter have spent ten times per 500 milli@@ liter of their li@@ ve@@ juice .
Bank of England will keep interest rates at 0.25 %
the Bank of England will likely announce that interest rates will remain unchanged after the weak economic growth and the weak@@ ening of inflation have damp@@ ened spec@@ ulation on an increase .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Bank of England warned that economic growth will remain &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mot@@ ions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when it retained interest rates on family income in the middle of an intensi@@ fying pressure . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the political decision @-@ makers of the Monetary Committee ( M@@ PC ) agreed with 6 to 2 to keep interest rates on 0,25 % , with fewer members to increase in this month as the weak economic growth has weak@@ ened the support of an increase .
in its quar@@ terly inflation report , the Bank reduced its growth forecasts for 2017 to 1.6 % , and warned that pressure on household income would continue , with inflation expected to rise to just under 3 % in the fall .
but they sign@@ alised that in the coming years interest @-@ ups would be necessary to stock the inflation heated by Bre@@ x@@ it and they said that the bor@@ ro@@ wed costs would have to rise more than expected in the financial markets .
the members also agreed to withdraw part of the m@@ amm@@ ut business package issued a year after Bre@@ x@@ it .
it will demand time for the financing plan to provide cheaper financing funds for banks as of next February , although it is expected that it will now be expected to provide 15 billion pounds more within the framework of this system - with 115 billion pounds ster@@ ling .
&quot; &quot; &quot; minutes after the decision on the interest rate , the Bank said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the central prog@@ no@@ sis of the M@@ PC , GDP remains weak in the short term , as the pressure on the real income of households continued to burden consumption . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; at the interest rates , it repeated that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a certain stream@@ lining of monetary policy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would be required for the cooling of inflation and a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; bigger scale &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; than the markets await . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the markets currently forecast the first rise in the third quarter of the next year and another in 2020 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , the Bank emphas@@ ised that elev@@ ations would be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; grad@@ ual &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; limited &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the growth forecasts of the Bank for this year and next year are projected to be 1.9 % and 1.7 % compared with the growth forecast in May .
it has maintained its growth forecast to 1.8 % in 2018 .
the pound fell to these news against the dollar and the euro .
the pound fell by 0.5 % to $ 1.@@ 31 and fell by 0.4 % to 1.11 euros .
no change is made after the recent dis@@ ap@@ pointing growth figures have damp@@ ed the rising expectations of an interest rate and GDP increased to 0.3 % in the second quarter of 0.2 % in the previous three months .
growth is expected to be 0.3 % in the third quarter , although it will recover slightly after the bank at the end of the year .
the recent inflation report provided little enthusiasm for households that are affected by rising inflation and low @-@ level sal@@ aries , as the shar@@ pen@@ ing will first be even worse before it gets better .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she added that monetary policy cannot &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prevent &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the coming years , but she added that wages will be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; clear &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the end of its three @-@ year prog@@ no@@ sis . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the economy is also strengthened by increasing demand for British goods , which is attri@@ but@@ able to the weak pound , which will compens@@ ate for a portion of lower consumption expenditure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the decision comes a year after lowering interest rates to 0.25 % last August following the sho@@ cking EU vote causing the sin@@ king of the pain . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Bank estimates that it will probably last four years until it will reach the prices and the economy completely .
before the Bank &apos;s last judgment at the rate of interest rates , the call was increased after a rate of interest , as inflation increased pressure on hard @-@ pressed households , with three polic@@ y@@ makers in July called for an increase to 0.5 % .
inflation was dropped from 2.9 % in June to 2.6 % in June , although the Bank said this was expected and will be attrac@@ ting them over the coming months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the bank said the exceeding in proportion to their goal of 2 % is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; entirely &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to the weak pound . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Andrew Mont@@ lake , director of Co@@ rec@@ o Mort@@ gage Bro@@ kers said : &quot; in view of the recent decl@@ ining of s@@ wap rates , the mort@@ gage market is likely to become more competitive , as the len@@ ders are looking for businesses looking for businesses and want to end the year in a positive way .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the market is especially good for those in which the existing de@@ als are running and the new mort@@ g@@ ages will complete , and many with toll free options and low rates are becoming more and more popular . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
N@@ HS ( National Health Service ) should prescri@@ be controversi@@ al HIV drug 10,000 people
&quot; &quot; &quot; patients will receive access to a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; transform@@ ative &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; HIV prevention treatment from September after a fight against the financing of the drug in the N@@ HS . &quot; &quot; &quot;
N@@ HS England announced that a pre@@ dispos@@ ition pro@@ phy@@ la@@ xis ( pre@@ p ) taken before sexual intercourse can decrease the risk of infection in high @-@ risk patients by about 86 percent , now delivered by healthcare through a first three @-@ year study for estimated 10,000 people .
he agreed to finance the trial after the App@@ eals Court confirmed a ruling by the Supreme Court last year that the N@@ HS had the authority to pay for the pre@@ p despite the claim that the local authorities should finance it .
the chess train announced on Thursday was welcomed by N@@ HS England chief Simon St@@ ev@@ ens as an &quot; important new intervention &quot; while the National AIDS Trust ( NA@@ T ) called this as a &quot; decisive moment . &quot;
sexual health clinics in London , Bri@@ gh@@ ton , Manchester , Liverpool and She@@ ff@@ ield will be among the first to join the registration of people and further clinics will follow in October before it will be introduced throughout England in April 2018 .
pre@@ dispos@@ ition pro@@ phy@@ la@@ xis ( pre@@ p ) is a sequence of HIV preparations used prior to sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection .
studies have shown that pre@@ p significantly reduces HIV transmission in infection risk .
pre@@ p before sexual intercourse means that just enough drugs in the body of a person are present to prevent an HIV infection .
such drugs may be taken every day or so already two hours before sexual intercourse .
to those who are eligible for treatment include gay or bis@@ ex@@ ual men , trans@@ sexual and individuals with HIV positive partners who have not been treated successfully .
in clinics , suitable candidates are identified , including men , women , trans@@ gender and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not known by anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment .
people who live in England and registered with a veter@@ in@@ arian can also register for possible participation in their local participating sex clinic .
the program is £ 10 million and N@@ HS England signed a contract for delivering the drugs this week following an international competitive procurement .
the study aims to assess the entire potential of pre@@ p by collecting clinical evidence , as it is being used and implemented on a large scale .
&quot; &quot; &quot; St@@ ev@@ ens said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this great new intervention should complement and over@@ take the far @-@ reaching and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is another milestone in the more than three decades of ongoing progress in addressing one of the biggest health challenges of humanity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Deb@@ or@@ ah Gold , Chief Executive at NA@@ T ( National AIDS Trust ) , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV . &quot; &quot; &quot;
pre@@ p , if it is targeted on ne@@ edy and endangered people , offers the possibility to change the English HIV epide@@ mic .
from September onwards people with high HIV @-@ risk will have access to this N@@ HS @-@ funded project in England to develop a new instrument that is truly individually controlled and is not subject to a negoti@@ ation with a partner , leading to the improvement of many , many lives .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we warm@@ ly welcome this announcement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ian Green , CEO of the Hig@@ gins Trust , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the priority must now be that the study is carried out quickly across the country and that no one who has a risk for HIV is left behind . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; now , as the pre@@ p test medicine has been obtained , we are on the best way to protect more than 10,000 people infected with HIV . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Shar@@ on Ho@@ d@@ g@@ son , Minister of Health , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the beginning of the pre@@ p process is welcome and over@@ due after months of delay and re@@ lu@@ ct@@ ant implementation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the evidence shows how transform@@ ative this drug may be as part of our approach to HIV prevention and can end the transmission of this life @-@ changing infection .
this attempt brings us one step closer to the understanding of the advantages of pre@@ p .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now it is important that this study is carried out as soon as possible throughout the country to protect people who are infected with HIV , and that it will contribute to the completion of the spread of HIV in society a step closer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
living the big living : mezzanine and clever designer tricks have transformed this small Ear@@ ls Court apartment into a spacious home
Jo@@ anne L@@ eig@@ h , a former ban@@ ker with a passion for real estate , shr@@ unk in 2014 from a big house in K@@ nigh@@ ts@@ bridge to an Ear@@ ls Court apartment .
it is located on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne Terrace - and it &apos;s a proof of the new design that Jo@@ anne has not packed her bags and sold her bags .
&quot; before that , I lived with my ex in K@@ nigh@@ ts@@ bridge in a much larger space , &quot; says Jo@@ anne .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I looked for something comparable to my price . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I was shown this apartment in Ear@@ ls Court and she had the same high ceilings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I fell in love with them and made an offer this day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the first inspection , the 1,000 square feet of the apartment was completely over@@ hau@@ led .
originally a one @-@ room property with a ne@@ sted layout - you had to go through the kitchen to get into the bedroom - wanted to add Jo@@ anne storage space and a mezzanine to optimally use the spacious ceiling height .
&quot; I wanted high ceilings , large windows , lots of light .
that was my requirement , &quot; she says .
for this purpose , she commissioned the Archit@@ ec@@ tural and Design@@ studio Duck &amp; Sh@@ ed of Er@@ fan Az@@ adi from Not@@ ting Hill , to make use of 12.5 foot high ceilings and to create a home that was not just a development , but also a place to live for jo@@ anne .
the ceiling was not big enough to place two rooms over one another so that the architectural challenge consisted of creating an intermediate floor in which one could stand .
Er@@ fan had to think creative in order to resolve the issue .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the steel structure is quite complicated , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he explains . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we had to arrange the rooms so that they were st@@ acked on one another without having to bite . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was not only about building a simple platform , but creating the steel so that it had the right height for the function above or down . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this arrangement enabled Er@@ fan to place two rooms at full height - with much additional drama .
for the mezzanine , a classic copper light window from Ret@@ rou@@ vi@@ us looks down over the glam@@ orous living area .
mir@@ ro@@ red gold furniture , silver acc@@ ents and vintage Ser@@ ge Mou@@ ille lighting set the style for the program .
the use of mirrors plays a role in adding theatre , space and light .
at both ends a short cor@@ ridor is mir@@ ro@@ red to make it work longer .
in the kitchen the mir@@ r@@ oring feels like a window into another room .
at the entrance , mir@@ ro@@ red units provide space for all cut@@ lery and j@@ ars of Jo@@ anne .
through the perception of a glam@@ orous space , the beauty of the living room can close the kitchen when it is not used .
fol@@ dable kitchens are nothing new .
the special thing about this is that it is a garage door .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a bit of engineering went in , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Er@@ fan from the steel @-@ reinforced , vene@@ ered MDF door . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important , so if you push the door , very easily gli@@ des . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thanks to the clever use of space and storage space , Jo@@ anne could gain additional 16 m ² , an additional bedroom and an improved layout .
&quot; at the end of the day you will sell the land - or how your property is appreciated , &quot; says Er@@ fan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a ru@@ di@@ mentary form a real estate agent will enter and perform a calculation based on the ground size . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
here they have managed to enlarge the floor space while at the same time use high @-@ quality materials that give the space its luxurious advantage .
&quot; the materials are the things you touch and who are therefore helping create an emotional attachment in a home , &quot; says Er@@ fan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you don &apos;t love the electrical sockets in the walls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
these are important , but they do not play with your heart . &quot;
it shows that a flat can transform itself through good design and increased square met@@ rics from something standard to something completely aston@@ ishing .
in fact , like Jo@@ anne , you could decide to leave it .
brothers fighting for a 500 million US dollar real estate empire
two brothers have four decades after their Italian family founded the dyn@@ asty , in a confront@@ ation because of one of the biggest real estate Imperial Vict@@ ori@@ as worth over $ 500 million .
the former director of the &apos; Carl@@ ton Football Club &apos; and developer Col@@ in De LU@@ TI@@ S lives in a villa in To@@ or@@ ak , only three doors from his younger brother Paul . he brought him to the Supreme Court to clarify how to divide their property and their assets .
Paul wanted to withdraw from family business since 2014 , but a sharp debate on the separation takes place in the Supreme Court .
together with her mother Anna , the brothers have acquired 38 properties worth more than half a billion dollars , since the 1973 family purchased a business in Smith Street , Coll@@ ing@@ wood .
there the family West@@ co je@@ ans founded je@@ ans and grew to a chain of 160 retail stores .
it was sold for 85 million US dollars in 1999 .
this money has been invested in real estate , and the portfolio of De LU@@ TI@@ S now includes offices in the city center , the development areas of Br@@ uns@@ wick and Sorrento , the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Bul@@ ler as well as shopping centers in the suburbs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; after an agreement with her de@@ ceased father , Col@@ in - by Paul described as the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; main operator &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the dominant personality &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the De LU@@ TI@@ S family - about two thirds of the company &apos;s assets and Paul about one third . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a court file states that this means that Col@@ in has property worth $ 316 million and worth $ 176 million in the value of $ 176 million .
the division of property and cash has proved to be a point of issue for Paul .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the divisions proposed by Col@@ in have left him with what I thought for the best objects , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he wrote in 2015 in a first mon@@ key . &quot; &quot; &quot;
last Friday , after several failed plac@@ ements , the first hearing of the Supreme Court of Justice took place .
the Brothers are now fighting for control of the existing business - including Col@@ in , as Paul claims to have ruled him .
Col@@ in ar@@ gues that this is not true , but re@@ jects Paul to manage some poss@@ essions in@@ competent .
in an early mon@@ key that was submitted by Col@@ in , he says he hopes to settle the dispute .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my Italian inheritance notes that the family is the most important priority , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the cost increases in the case , with hundreds of pages with affir@@ m@@ ations , emails and reports of companies , including Del@@ o@@ itte , Pit@@ cher Partners and Charter K@@ eck Cr@@ amer , and with leading lawyers , including Allan My@@ ers , Q@@ C , and both parties held by law firms .
Mrs. De LU@@ TI@@ S and her husband @-@ husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who operated milk bars and delicacies from the late 19@@ 50s and bought a store in Br@@ uns@@ wick in the early 1970s .
they used the security to buy the Coll@@ ing@@ wood Property in which Col@@ in opened the first je@@ ans of the family .
Col@@ in says that he started West@@ co there when he was &quot; in my last years of high school when Paul was still a little child ( about 10 years old ) . &quot;
Anna De LU@@ TI@@ S says that she and Luigi , who died in 2012 , hoped to share their property with their sons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Luigi often said to me that he never wanted the brothers to land before the court , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two other brothers , Mark and Luke , are no longer part of the De LU@@ TI@@ S group , whereby Col@@ in claims that Mark had paid $ 10 million and Luke 26 million dollars when leaving the company .
&quot; &quot; &quot; both Luke and Mark are , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Paul says &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has become bitter about the conditions of their financial separation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Col@@ in with@@ held a lot , although he was a former AF@@ L board member and after a biography from Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ire , the best friend of the TV star .
Fair@@ fax Media took contact with Col@@ in and Paul De LU@@ TI@@ S and their lawyers .
only Col@@ in answered by SMS to say &quot; I really can &apos;t say much , &quot; because the case is before the courts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very , very sad that my brother Paul decided to acc@@ use me and to withdraw our sur@@ name by the courts , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in mid @-@ 2016 Col@@ in wrote in a letter to the court that he tried to meet the demands of his brother .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our father didn &apos;t want Paul and I would end up in our current conflict , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said and added that he &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; still hoping for a solution . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Friday , this hope seemed to be over .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our matter will be solved in the near future by the courts , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote Col@@ in . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the new Chief of Staff plans to restri@@ ct the President &apos;s media ab@@ st@@ in@@ ence . &quot; &quot; &quot;
others have tried and failed .
maybe John F. Kelly can actually do it .
if so , he will be the first .
POL@@ IT@@ IC@@ O reports that the new Chief of Staff of White House plans to restri@@ ct the flow of information to President Tr@@ ump - including the news media reports - hoping to hold the boss on a more uniform course .
here is a piece of re@@ porter Jos@@ h D@@ aw@@ sey :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when John F. Kelly , the new Chief of Staff of the White House , met with executive employees on his first working day , he presented a major problem in President Donald Tr@@ umps White House , which he wanted to repair : bad information coming into the hands of the President . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Kelly said to the staff that information should flow through him - whether on paper or in brie@@ f@@ ings - because the president would make better decisions if he would receive good information . &quot;
Kell@@ ys diagnosis makes sense , but others have tried to t@@ ame Tr@@ ump by monitoring his media density .
President Tr@@ umps &apos;s relationship to television dates back decades - and now , where he is in the White House , his tel@@ ev@@ isions are still strong .
&quot; if candidate Tr@@ ump was angry for un@@ fair coverage , it was productive to show him that he received a fair reporting of places that were to convince , &quot; said the former elec@@ toral advis@@ er Sam N@@ un@@ berg in February opposite Polit@@ ico .
Polit@@ ic@@ os Tara pal@@ mer@@ i wrote at the time that &quot; the key to keep Tr@@ umps Twitter hab@@ it under control , according to six former elec@@ toral officials , to ensure that his personal media consumption includes a steady praise . &quot;
Originaltitel : des@@ perate House@@ wives ( TV )
&quot; &quot; &quot; but the idea that tr@@ umps Twitter hab@@ it was ever &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; under control &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is ridi@@ cul@@ ous . &quot; &quot; &quot;
maybe these campaign officials know something we don &apos;t know others - that the twe@@ ets wouldn &apos;t contain any more fuel without their interventions .
we will probably never know anything about the twe@@ ets that Tr@@ ump did not send .
if his collabor@@ ators have managed to keep away from him several times , then their efforts have been worth it .
but no one has consistently been able to prevent Tr@@ ump cont@@ ro@@ ver@@ ts .
a part of the problem is that people in a White House , which consists of competing parties , try again and again to present their own agenda by presenting Tr@@ ump Material that may promote their views from the world .
POL@@ IT@@ IC@@ O - dedicated to this story - reported in May about the predi@@ le@@ ction of the advis@@ ors to provide dou@@ bt@@ ful information to the President for strategic reasons .
this was an example described by Re@@ porter Sh@@ ane Gold@@ macher :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; up @-@ to @-@ date and former Tr@@ ump officials say that Tr@@ ump is able to react like a volcano to negative press excer@@ pts , above all those with dam@@ aging le@@ aks , and that he will find out where they come from . &quot; &quot; &quot;
exactly this happened at the end of February when someone gave the president mal@@ icious printed copy of an article of Got@@ News@@ .com , the web site of Internet pro@@ voc@@ ate@@ urs Charles C. Johnson , who accused the dep@@ uty commander K@@ atie Wal@@ sh , &quot; to be the source behind a he@@ ap of le@@ aks &quot; in the White House .
although Johnson was permanently bann@@ ed from Twitter for sh@@ ik@@ es , or that he did not offer any concrete evidence or that he had false alle@@ g@@ ations in the past and re@@ vo@@ ke her .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Tr@@ ump read the article and began to ask staff about Wal@@ sh . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gold@@ macher added that the then Chief of Staff Rein@@ ce Pri@@ eb@@ us and the Secretary @-@ General of the White House , Rob Porter , &quot; tried to implement a system in order to manage and document the paper@@ work and document the dump . &quot;
how did that work ?
Kelly tries to do the same three months later .
perhaps he will prove to be an effective manager as a pri@@ eb@@ us , but Tr@@ ump is still his impul@@ sive self , and his advis@@ ors are still seeking influence .
these imm@@ utable factors make Kell@@ ys &apos;s mission very difficult .

&quot; &quot; &quot; rag@@ ing residents have pushed the Council of Soli@@ h@@ ull , who said it was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; useless to deal with the problem . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; an anonymous resident said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they went there on Monday evening after they were forwar@@ ded by Bentley He@@ ath , where they have thrown stones onto the pass@@ ers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Council must indeed be forced by shame on the implementation , as it was useless when dealing with the problem . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the travellers were there in May , were moved on and are now back .
more came yesterday evening , probably today even more . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Birmingham Council knows how to deal with it by holding long transfers to protect its parks . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I live on the Stre@@ ets@@ brook Road and I am not happy to continue paying my common@@ place if the Council cannot stop it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a resident who didn &apos;t want to be called , said : &quot; it &apos;s ridi@@ cul@@ ous , we just saw the last round of these travelers , just to be pl@@ under@@ ed by another round .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the numbers have been increased this time and you even have seen a horse in the parking area . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a spokes@@ person for the Council of Soli@@ h@@ ull said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are aware of an un@@ authorised camp on the country beyond the Stre@@ ets@@ brook Road and work with the police of Soli@@ h@@ ull . we take the necessary legal steps so that they can move as quickly as possible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
to support our evidence , it is very important that as many people as possible report an anti @-@ social or criminal behaviour in the police by calling 101 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this helps create a picture of the situation in which the Court must examine when we present our case . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Birken@@ hof will become Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise
the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise is made up of the former Hotel Birken@@ hof .
the house in front of the gates of Freuden@@ stadt is currently being renovated and will be re@@ opened on 1 March next year .
these are good news for the city .
due to the closure of the hotel Birken@@ hof due to the Ambiente company operating company mbH on April 13 , 2014 , some 30 000 over@@ nights per year were lost and also revenues by the tourist tax .
in the autumn of 2014 , in view of a dramatic increase in numbers of refugees who came to the district , the hotel building offered the Land@@ rat@@ samt as a collective shelter , which provided for contro@@ vers@@ y discussions .
the city prevented the placing of asylum seek@@ ers by setting up a building plan to secure the area as a hotel location .
the decision was not disp@@ uted at that time in the Municipal Council .
but especially Freuden@@ stadt &apos;s mayor Julian Os@@ s@@ wald def@@ ended the hotel location and already spoke of serious people interested in the house .
he should keep right .
the group of Lu@@ is@@ enh@@ otels with manager Birgit Sch@@ erer , based in Bad Berg@@ z@@ ab@@ ern , has acquired the former Hotel Birken@@ hof for a voluntary increase in Berlin and wants to return to a house of the three @-@ star plus category under the name Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
the group has four houses with the Freuden@@ stadt object .
two of them in Bad Berg@@ z@@ ab@@ ern and one in Bad Men@@ al@@ b .
you are looking for Hotel Lu@@ ise , Lu@@ isen@@ park , Park@@ hotel Lu@@ ise and now Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
at the former Hotel Birken@@ hof have been building sh@@ utt@@ ings in front of the entrance for a longer time , and when you enter the house , it becomes clear what extensive renov@@ ations are made .
the floors were pulled out , blan@@ kets partly dismant@@ led , old bath@@ tu@@ bs removed from the rooms .
the entire hotel building is a single building site .
until March there is still much to do .
&quot; it &apos;s actually a nice hotel , &quot; says Thomas Sch@@ erer in conversation with our newspaper .
everything is to be renewed in the Black Forest style .
the rooms are equipped with large walk @-@ in showers , the entrance area is re@@ designed , new windows are installed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; everything should later become &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fair &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as Thomas Sch@@ erer expresses . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to make a piece of jewellery . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
swimming pool , wellness area and conference room belong to the equipment .
you don &apos;t want to be positioned at the high level of the hotels in Lau@@ ter@@ bad , but already on a higher level of city level , empha@@ sizes sc@@ iss@@ ors .
the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise with its about 60 rooms wants to spread broad@@ ly , explains Sch@@ erer .
both individual ho@@ liday@@ makers , groups or business@@ men should feel at ease in the hotel .
conversations with OB Julian Os@@ s@@ wald and tourism director Michael Kr@@ ause have already led , such sh@@ a@@ vers .
the ideas of the city are identical with those of the hotel group .
&quot; we are on the same line . &quot;
according to the amount of investment , Thomas Sch@@ erer doesn &apos;t want to determine exactly .
just under a million euros , he reck@@ ons .
the external systems are also brought to the fore@@ man , which is already clearly visible .
in a courtyard there is a large terrace that is accessible from the restaurant which is public .
Thomas Sch@@ erer is optim@@ istic : &quot; Freuden@@ stadt is a good market . &quot;
Russia @-@ Aff@@ aires : us Special Represent@@ ative of the Grand Jury
in the Russian affair around US President Donald Tr@@ ump , special investig@@ ator Robert Mu@@ eller is said to have used a so @-@ called Grand Jury after a report .
&quot; &quot; &quot; during the past weeks , the committee has recorded the work , wrote the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wall Street Journal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; calling on the subject of familiar persons . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the newspaper evaluated the step as a sign that Mu@@ eller has expanded and intensi@@ fied its investigation .
the CN@@ N was reported , there are already the first inv@@ itations of the Gre@@ mi@@ ums in connection with a meeting between the el@@ dest son and a Russian lawyer .
U.S. intelligence agencies have been acc@@ using the Krem@@ lin for a long time to have been targeted in the 2016 presidential campaign .
Mu@@ eller is investig@@ ating whether there were agreements between the Tr@@ umps Wahl@@ kamp@@ f@@ Team and Moskau .
the investigation will focus on several men who acted as an advis@@ or to the Re@@ public@@ ans in the election campaign .
according to reports , Mu@@ eller took more and more of the priv@@ ates and business environment under the micro@@ scope .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a few weeks ago , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Washington Post &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote that the special investig@@ ator Tr@@ ump has personally moved into the centre and exam@@ ining whether the president could possibly hin@@ der the judi@@ ci@@ ary in the course of the affair . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the main task of Grand Jur@@ ys is to examine this evidence in possible dis@@ rup@@ tions and decide whether to be charged .
Grand Jur@@ ys are therefore also called count @-@ chambers .
mostly they are turned on when it comes to larger and controversi@@ al cases .
the process always takes place behind closed doors .
the body can also be turned on by the public prosec@@ utor to charge persons to the company under o@@ ath .
according to the CN@@ N transmitter , pre @-@ inv@@ itations have already been issued , which revol@@ ve around the encounter between Donald Tr@@ ump J@@ r. and a Russian lawyer .
persons involved in the meeting were asked for a statement , it was stated in the report .
in addition , they should provide documents .
in addition to Tr@@ ump J@@ r. , Tr@@ umps consultants and son @-@ in @-@ law J@@ ared K@@ ush@@ ner and his former Elec@@ tor Paul Man@@ a@@ fort also attended the conversation .
right @-@ wing experts said on the Thursday evening on the U.S. television that the implementation show that Mu@@ eller would not be inti@@ mid@@ ated in his work and that he should act quickly if necessary .
but it must not necessarily mean that the Grand Jury will end up on the end to decide on the collection of an indictment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , the enforcement of the committee is the beginning of a new phase in the investigations and a new reason for the concern for President Tr@@ ump . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the midst of the new re@@ vel@@ ations , on Thursday evening , the President used a speech in West Virginia to por@@ tray the Russi@@ ans as a campaign of his political opponents .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Russian history is a total invention , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tr@@ ump . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the topic gives the Democrats a way to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; feel good &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because they have nothing else to talk about . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his special advis@@ er T@@ y Cob@@ b stated in an opinion , he did not know anything about the composition of a Grand Jury .
but I usually work in the secret , he emphas@@ ised .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the White House endor@@ ses any measures which accelerated the work of the special agent in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; f@@ aire &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the former F@@ BI chief James Com@@ ey said three times that not against the president will be determined .
I have no reason to accept that something has changed , it was written in the Declaration .
Mu@@ eller was first used after Tr@@ ump Com@@ ey fired .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of this draft repro@@ ach , accus@@ ations against Tr@@ ump had become no@@ isy , he did not want to hin@@ der the judi@@ ci@@ ary . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Com@@ ey said in June before a Senate Committee , Tr@@ ump asked him to set the investigation against the former National Security Consult@@ ant Michael Fl@@ yn@@ n .
the President is under great pressure because of the investigation .
after the presentation of U.S. media , the White House collected material against the special agent and its employees .
the del@@ eting spec@@ ulation about whether Tr@@ ump Mu@@ eller wants to dism@@ iss .
unlike an independent investig@@ ator of Congress , such as in the Wat@@ erg@@ ate affair around the later rec@@ alled President Richard Ni@@ xon , Mu@@ eller has a position in which he could theore@@ tically be fired at the ur@@ ging of the President of the Ministry of Justice .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; several sen@@ ators of both parties want to prevent such a step . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two groups of Republi@@ can and Democratic sen@@ ators presented law@@ makers on Thursday , after which the special investig@@ ators could no longer be dism@@ is@@ sed .
Ant@@ arc@@ tic : gigantic ic@@ e@@ berg drives in Ant@@ arc@@ tica
in the Western Ant@@ arc@@ tic , a gigantic ic@@ e@@ berg was replaced by the almost seven @-@ fold great@@ ness of Berlin from the Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s .
this shared the Bre@@ mer@@ ha@@ ven@@ er Alfred We@@ gener Institute for Polar and Marine Research on Wednesday .
the heavy and 5@@ 800 square kilomet@@ re @-@ kilomet@@ re @-@ kilomet@@ re @-@ kilomet@@ re @-@ kilometer drove north and will need two or three years until it was mel@@ ted .
with 175 kilometres of length and a width of up to 50 kilometres , it is one of the largest ice @-@ e@@ aters who have registered researchers over the past three decades .
there is no danger for man from him .
to what extent climate change has played a role in the departure of the ic@@ e@@ berg , is un@@ clear after research data .
however , for some 30 years there have been a series of unusual gather@@ ings of ice @-@ stu@@ ffs in the region , writes the U.S. research center for snow and ice ( N@@ SI@@ DC ) in a background .
according to many researchers , this could be related to global warming .
the now broken col@@ os@@ sus was a part of the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s until now .
Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s flo@@ ats on the sea and is fed by large gl@@ aci@@ ers .
it continues to grow into the sea and breaks out regularly .
the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s is located south of South America almost at the top of the Ant@@ arc@@ tic Peninsula .
to the north of this Sch@@ el@@ mish , the balance of w@@ axes and dis@@ rup@@ tions was dis@@ rupted some years ago .
a complete Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s is broken there , writes A@@ WI researcher Daniela Jan@@ sen .
there is a lot about the fact that the Lar@@ sen @-@ C Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s is in danger , as the front edge has never with@@ drawn as far as currently .
in addition , the ice sheet stands under stress and can crum@@ ble if a piece is broken down at a key point .
the mel@@ ting of Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s and Eis@@ berg does not increase sea level as they float on the water and displ@@ ace as much water as it yields after mel@@ ting itself .
however , the loss of gravity leads to the fact that the gl@@ aci@@ ers can flow directly into the sea and flow much faster than before .
this could possibly increase sea level , but only in a small extent , the British research project for the observation of Ant@@ arc@@ tica ( Mi@@ das ) .
according to A@@ WI data , the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s is the fourth biggest shr@@ ink@@ er of Ant@@ arc@@ tica with nearly 50 000 square kilometres .
at the crossing from the mainland , it is up to 700 meters thick , at the front edge to the free ocean approximately 200 meters .
there it breaks out regularly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although it is a natural phenomenon and has no direct connection to climate change , the ice shield now comes into a more dangerous position , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Martin O &apos;@@ L@@ ear@@ y from British Sw@@ an@@ sea University . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the longest withdrawal since the beginning of records , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he also confirmed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
among scientists , it is controversi@@ al whether the Lar@@ sen @-@ C Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s will grow back or go back in the long term and possibly collapse , said his colleague Adrian Luck@@ man and added : &quot; our models say it will be less stable . &quot;
but this development will last decades .
even though these researchers are not returning to climate change this gigantic ic@@ e@@ berg has fallen apart in recent decades , however , many mis@@ chie@@ fs of the Ant@@ arc@@ tic Peninsula have fallen apart .
this long ridge of Ant@@ arc@@ tica extends towards South America .
according to data of the research program British Ant@@ arc@@ tic Survey , the ice surface of the Ant@@ arc@@ tic Peninsula has decreased by 28 000 square kilometres since the 19@@ 50s .
the decline in temperature has contributed to the decline .
the Ant@@ arc@@ tic Peninsula has grown up around three degrees in the last 50 years and thus t@@ amed to the areas in which the temperature rises the fastest .
C@@ DU wants pets in staff
because it becomes increasingly difficult to occupy vac@@ ant positions , the C@@ DU calls on the employers &apos; association to become more attractive .
only shortly before the summer break , the Cre@@ ist@@ ag has established 41 new jobs in the administration .
more than 1100 employees and officials work for the county administration in M@@ ett@@ mann .
now 17 apprenti@@ ces have their first working day behind them .
the teachers at the circle are obviously very sought @-@ after .
around 620 applications were to be recorded for the places surrounding this year .
nevertheless , the circle is still lacking personnel to cope with the increased requirements and tasks .
at present there are still 50 not occupied places in the M@@ ett@@ mann district .
among other things , doctors and engineers , as well as forces of general administration , are sought .
the C@@ DU is now attemp@@ ting to take the initiative together with the F@@ DP and U@@ WG and to relie@@ ve the short@@ age of skilled workers in the administration .
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to the wish of the parties , administration is to develop a concept for human resources and personnel development . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the goal is not only to cover short @-@ term requirements for skilled workers , but to counter@@ act the future @-@ oriented application short@@ age , it is said .
the overall concept should orient@@ ate itself internally and extern@@ ally , show concrete measures for trans@@ former members and include an education offensive , C@@ DU , F@@ DP and U@@ WG .
this sounds like a good approach .
because the circle has to do with personnel problems you did not know before .
other cities advertise good officials and employees and offer more attractive conditions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the speech is of a regular &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; competition of public employers &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , a high number of employees , the disease or age @-@ related , comes from the service .
thus , the highest amount of time for action , so that no more jobs will remain un@@ occupied .
but Klaus @-@ Dieter peoples , leader of the C@@ DU spokes@@ person , goes beyond the joint request with his party .
he had long ago in the Krem@@ ist@@ ag for a f@@ ist surprise when he publicly question@@ ed the personnel costs and the other parties were aston@@ ished .
people want all possibilities to be verified that allow a withdrawal from the local employers &apos; association .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we do not come to a satis@@ factory solution here at short notice , the county administration should seek a pet with the trade unions - perhaps even in cooperation with the surrounding towns - a pet &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; so people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in doing so , the C@@ DU tried to better pay the employees and officials than it actually fore@@ sees tari@@ ffs for the public service .
the sal@@ aries are currently accurately pre @-@ written , increases or more money there is only when you move to a higher stage oriented towards professional years .
but the tasks of the circle have grown more and more in recent years .
only a few weeks ago , new rooms had to be set up in which employees take care of the provisions of the new Pro@@ stitu@@ te Protection Act .
last but not least due to the increasing number of asylum seek@@ ers , Land@@ rat Thomas Hend@@ ele and Kreis@@ direktor Martin Richter have a problem : they have too little staff .
Italy ag@@ grav@@ ates the tone to NGOs &apos; migrants &apos; rescue boats
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Italy has warned NGOs who use lif@@ ebo@@ ats for migrants in the Mediterranean , warned that they should not continue this if they do not comply with new rules for their operations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if NGOs do not sign a new code of conduct , it is difficult to see how they can continue &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Minister of Interior Marco Minn@@ iti in an interview with the Turin daily La St@@ ampa . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Minn@@ iti &apos;s warning came one day after the Italian authorities had seized a boat from the German aid organisation &apos; Youth Save &apos; because their team had worked together effectively with traff@@ ick@@ ers in a way that facilit@@ ated illegal immigration .
the relief organization , which has only been in operation for one year , refused to express itself in detailed accus@@ ations of the Italian prosec@@ utor Amb@@ ro@@ gio Car@@ to@@ si@@ o .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are very sorry that we cannot operate in the search and rescue zone at the moment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the organization in a statement on social media . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can only judge any accus@@ ations that are currently being raised after we have collected all the information and can judge the situation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Italian authorities had watched the boat from &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Youth R@@ ettet , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; which was super@@ vised by I@@ u@@ vent@@ a since October . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is thought that the crew will take ding@@ h@@ y migrants abo@@ ard , which are delivered directly by men &apos;s tra@@ ders and that the sm@@ ug@@ gl@@ ers can depart , so that the ships can be used again .
at least one such meeting was allegedly only 1,3 miles off the Liby@@ an coast , according to the prosec@@ utor &apos;s file , whose content was published by Italian media .
the occupation is suspected of taking over the authority of the Italian Coast Guard , the rescue missions in the zone for humanitarian reasons and not from any other motives .
under the Code of Con@@ duct , boats such as the I@@ u@@ vent@@ a must mainly have an Italian police officer who super@@ vis@@ es their activities .
only three of the nine NGOs who are involved in search and rescue operations have previously agreed to abide by the code : save the Children , MO@@ AS from Malta and Pro @-@ Activ@@ a Open Ar@@ ms from Spain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be considered un@@ necessarily , but acceptable as they would not bring any &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; major changes or disabilities &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to their rescue operations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
among those who refuse to sign are the Nobel Prize Win@@ ner Organisation Doc@@ tors Without Bor@@ ders ( MS@@ F ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Minn@@ iti now said that the number of migrants who arrived in Italy after the rescue measures had declined strongly in recent weeks , indicating that efforts to strengthen the Liby@@ an coast guard and cooperation with local may@@ ors have borne fruit . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the last days we began to see light at the end of the tunnel , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Minister . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he announced plans for further talks with Liby@@ an citizens in this month about economic development initiatives and with C@@ had , Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants who leave these countries in hope to reach Europe .
asc@@ ents and Tri@@ als
nine Wei@@ ler@@ ers Bik@@ er , the &quot; Berliner Outdoor Out@@ post &quot; and two guest drivers met in Wach@@ en@@ heim in the northern Pal@@ at@@ in@@ ate to enjoy Tri@@ als and S@@ ights for four days .
three be@@ fri@@ ended guides were available for this .
the accommodation in the Wach@@ en@@ heimer valley proved to be a good starting point for the tours .
the Burg@@ und@@ y and W@@ einf@@ est of Wach@@ en@@ heim was a welcome extra .
the first tour led to hot summer temperatures along the vineyards to the Micha@@ el@@ skap@@ elle just above Dei@@ desheim .
there were view@@ points , partly on towers , from which one could look far over the Pf@@ äl@@ zer Wald and the up@@ stream planes .
there were still longer asc@@ ents in between for the long tri@@ angles .
on the second day we went to Bad Dür@@ k@@ heim to Sal@@ ine and Volks@@ fest Wur@@ st@@ markt .
again there was a look@@ out spot at a look@@ out point , connected by &quot; flow@@ y &quot; tri@@ als and moderate asc@@ ents .
on the last two days there were again a lot of altitude metres .
caves , rocks , towers , castles , ruins and shel@@ ters brought welcome breaks .
in Bad Dür@@ k@@ heim the bi@@ kers breathe in the open @-@ air inhal@@ atorium .
also Neustadt was controlled .
after 173 kilometers and almost 4500 meters of altitude , the group had met the Pf@@ äl@@ zer Wald from its best side - sporty and cul@@ turally .
console instead of lawn - Bundes@@ liga prepar@@ es for e @-@ sports
are sports @-@ stars sitting in front of computer con@@ soles in the future , instead of fighting through stor@@ ms with wind and weather ?
fact is : e @-@ sport has long been a serious business , becoming a lu@@ cr@@ ative business - big stars , millions of fans and huge tournaments with high levels .
this also recognized the first Bundes@@ lig@@ aver@@ eins , who are increasingly involved in this field .
the beginning of 2015 was the V@@ f@@ L Wolfs@@ burg , followed by the FC Schal@@ ke 04 and finally the V@@ f@@ B Stuttgart , who founded an e @-@ sport department in mid July and took two pro@@ s for the computer game FIFA 17 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we hope to inspire new young audiences for the V@@ f@@ B , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says CEO Jochen Rö@@ tt@@ ger@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he is sure , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that there are still a number of clubs on this train . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the football world association FIFA in London will host the first &quot; Inter@@ active Club World Cup , &quot; in which the gam@@ ers of different clubs compete against each other .
in addition to Schal@@ ke and Wolfs@@ burg , for example Manchester City , Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main or the PSV Ein@@ d@@ hoven qualify .
Robin D@@ ut@@ t also sees great potential in E @-@ Sport .
the ex @-@ trainer of Bayer Le@@ verk@@ usen and Wer@@ der Bremen is now advis@@ ing an agency for virtual football players .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; real football needs to deal in particular with the 14 to 30 @-@ year @-@ olds that the young people will go to the stadium in the future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 52 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and : the clubs tried to conquer all possible markets , especially the Asian .
with prominent E @-@ sport@@ s@@ men under contract , one could be much more often present on these markets than once a year to send the Federal Office to Asia once a year .
what is it exactly ?
in E @-@ Sport , computer games such as &quot; League Of Le@@ gends , &quot; &quot; D@@ ota 2 , &quot; &quot; Co@@ unter@@ strike &quot; or even the football simulation FIFA are fought on competition level .
long ago , as in normal sports , L@@ igen was established where professionals compete against each other .
and by 2022 , E @-@ Sport is already part of the official programme .
but is it a kind of sport at all ?
for many , the idea is certainly getting used .
Ingo F@@ rob@@ os@@ et has also been dealing with the question for a long time .
for the professor at the Deutsche Sp@@ orth@@ och@@ schule in Cologne , e @-@ sport is a sport because it is competent and show many biological and physical reactions which are also found in classical sports - for example , increased heart rate , stress reactions , hormon@@ al changes .
in addition , it needs cognitive abilities , a technical and tac@@ tical understanding and a fast reaction .
professional gam@@ ers should not only train on the console but also exercise their body and pay attention to nutrition .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the fit player is a good player . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but F@@ rob@@ os@@ us also sees problems : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dop@@ ing is becoming more and more a topic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
controls are difficult to perform in online games , and in the scene the structures of classical sports were missing .
the scientist raises the high integr@@ ative effect of the e @-@ sport in a positive way .
players are travelling internationally , which is like a big global family , there are no intercultural barriers .
a study of the management consultancy Del@@ o@@ itte and the Bundes@@ verband Inter@@ active Entertainment Software ( BI@@ U ) predi@@ cts rapid growth in the E @-@ Sport .
in 2016 , 50 million euros have been implemented in Germany , mainly via advertising , sponsor@@ ing and big tournaments .
in three years , sales are expected to lie at 130 million .
against the nearly 2.4 billion euros of the Bundes@@ liga , this is little .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , the E @-@ Sport &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is no longer far from the other established sports such as hand@@ ball , basketball or ice ho@@ ckey , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; writes the Del@@ o@@ itte Ad@@ vis@@ ors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many countries are already on the ground .
big markets are Asia and the USA , where ex @-@ basketball players Sha@@ qu@@ ille O &apos;@@ Ne@@ al and Bas@@ eb@@ all@@ star Alex Rodri@@ gu@@ ez participate in the US Team N@@ RG e@@ Sports .
Hollywood actors Ash@@ ton Kut@@ cher inv@@ ests in the e@@ Sport @-@ bet@@ ting provider Uni@@ kr@@ n .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is a lot in Europe too . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a Norwegian school e @-@ sport was introduced as a classroom , says F@@ rob@@ osa .
according to D@@ ut@@ t , the Bundes@@ liga @-@ Ver@@ eine in the Netherlands and in France are now oblig@@ ated to establish an e @-@ sport department .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the European comparison , Germany lag@@ s behind , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains V@@ f@@ B @-@ Board Rö@@ tt@@ ger@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
only in no@@ stal@@ gia to fall , and the old times to be clar@@ ified , today is no longer sufficient .
it is about preserving the tradition of the association , but to align the company with the modern market at the same time .

Michelle Carter for the lyrics imp@@ eding Con@@ rad Roy to su@@ icide , condem@@ ns him
a woman from Massach@@ us@@ etts was sentenced to two and a half years , because she encouraged her friend through texts and calls to su@@ icide .
Michelle Carter , now 20 , will spend 15 months of her conviction behind bars and five years were subjected to prob@@ ation .
Carter was sentenced in June by Con@@ rad Roy driving a neg@@ ligent killing of Con@@ rad Roy , who took life on 13 July 2014 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the father of Roy said on Thursday at the hearing : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my family is un@@ comfor@@ ting . &quot; &quot; &quot;
my son was my best friend . &quot;
Carter was allowed to remain free until his vocation .
she had been faced with a maximum penalty of 20 years , but her legal representatives argu@@ ed that both she and Mr Roy suffered from a mental illness .
dressed in red pants and a cream colored bl@@ ouse , Carter stood with tears in her eyes , with folded hands and down@@ ward eyes when she was convi@@ cted .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; their actions have taken Con@@ rad Roy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the prosec@@ utor to the court . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she finished his life to make her own better . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she has no responsibility , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she has not shown any re@@ mor@@ se . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but Car@@ ters lawyer said it was a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dre@@ ad@@ ful circum@@ stance that she completely regre@@ t@@ ted . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , Ju@@ dge Lawrence Mon@@ iz said he did not find out that you &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; age or maturity or even their mental illness have a significant impact on their actions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a prosec@@ utor read a statement by Ro@@ ys Mutter Lyn@@ n Roy who said that there is &quot; no day in which I don &apos;t pray the loss of my beloved son .
I want it to be proud of me and how I surround myself with everything . I try , despite all my pain that we will carry with us for eternity to be there for his sisters , &quot; it says in it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ro@@ ys sister , Cam@@ dy@@ n Roy , said that she was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; persec@@ uted &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the realization that she would never take part in the wedding of her brother or be a a@@ unt for his children . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no longer this only person with whom I have been together since my birth , is a pain I will always keep with me for the rest of my life , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the case appears to be a legal preced@@ ent since there is no law in Massach@@ us@@ etts , which makes it a crime to challenge another , commit su@@ icide .
Carter was 17 years old when Roy found dead from a carbon mon@@ oxide tox@@ in in a vehicle in 2014 .
the case attracted national attention after Car@@ ters revealed text messages that she encouraged him to end his life .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hang on , spring from a building , create yourself , I don &apos;t know , there are many ways , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said in several news that she had sent in the two weeks before his death , while he was on vacation with his family . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the eyes of his su@@ icide she wrote : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you must do it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Con@@ rad &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Every@@ thing you have to do is to turn on the generator and you will be free and happy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
judge Mon@@ iz said that Carter attracted attention by Roy &apos;s death and ordered that she should benefit from any press from the fall .
the case has shared legal opinions .
to the few who def@@ ended Carter , Am@@ anda Kno@@ x , who was convi@@ cted in Italy for murder on her British room@@ mate in Italy , was acqu@@ itted before two years ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ms. Kno@@ x , 30 years of age , published a comment in the Los Angeles Times : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Michelle Carter deserves compassion and help , not j@@ ail . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Joshua K@@ imm@@ ich : learning from the new Mini @-@ Lah@@ m of the FC Bayern
that Joshua K@@ imm@@ i was allowed to run the Audi Cup as a captain is not a coinci@@ dence .
the FC Bayern dar@@ es to give a big season to the Con@@ fed @-@ Cup winner - extra motivation is not possible .
something was different from his place in the cabin , which was Joshua K@@ imm@@ ich immediately , even if the additional garment was very , very small .
but there was no Philipp Lah@@ m and no Manuel Neu@@ er on the second day of the Audi C@@ ups on the second day of the Audi C@@ ups .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the trainer hasn &apos;t announced it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Con@@ fed @-@ Cup winner told us after his first deployment as a Bavaria @-@ captain . &quot; &quot; &quot;
well , the obj@@ ectiv@@ ity could have been better than at 0 : 2 against the SS@@ C Naples .
but the sign of Coach could also interpre@@ t K@@ imm@@ i as well .
not the eight year older Ar@@ tur@@ o Vi@@ dal was chosen in the C @-@ El@@ f &apos;s C @-@ El@@ f who had been chosen from the holiday , but he was chosen from the holiday .
the sweet@@ est of sugar is to be distributed to those who want to drink a lot , which one wants to keep in mood .
those who were chosen to take the hei@@ r of Lah@@ m can only use a little extra motivation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ imm@@ ick confirmed : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is what you want as a player : take responsibility . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Wednesday the 22 @-@ year @-@ old fl@@ ashed out as a mini @-@ l@@ ame over the field .
to the right , this is his position , the white bond on the arm did its rest .
and at all , K@@ imm@@ i worked in this starting @-@ formation like the one who can best take the ru@@ d@@ der in his hand .
he gave instructions , trying to ste@@ er the innocent bracket .
he had the view of the whole , while many others were occupied with himself .
Vi@@ dal thus to over@@ play his lack of fitness ( folded hard ) ; Ren@@ ato San@@ ches , on the devil , come out to the services of the Asia journey ( fold also only conditi@@ onally ) ; and Sebastian Ru@@ dy and Ni@@ kl@@ as Sü@@ le with it , in their first appearance in the Bavaria Tri@@ k@@ ot are not neg@@ atively affected .
after all , it was quite good .
Sü@@ le ran next to K@@ imm@@ ich , Ru@@ dy off the defense , both acted confi@@ dently .
the well @-@ known Nap@@ oli storm is often difficult , moreover , Sü@@ le also tried a few times in the game design .
&quot; &quot; &quot; his colleague Ru@@ dy admitted that the result was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not as we hoped for &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but he also showed a decent performance at the debut .
&quot; &quot; &quot; game re@@ location , tempo change : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was also picked up for this style . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as un@@ usually this Bavaria @-@ world is still for the new entran@@ ces , one saw in the connection to the game .
for example , Ru@@ dy did not have one or two interviews in the cat@@ ac@@ om@@ bs but definitely six or seven interviews .
K@@ imm@@ ick said good@@ bye to some cr@@ isp@@ y statements in the back of his new fellow players .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there he heard of Sü@@ le an interesting pro@@ position : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what is going on here , I have already noticed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in Bavaria you just have to win any game . &quot;
after all , he doesn &apos;t have to teach the new one more .

the Bavaria legi@@ on@@ aire is quasi club @-@ mate of Ö@@ F@@ B @-@ captain Schn@@ all@@ beck and f@@ ie@@ bert with our shop .
the twe@@ et of the Austrian football champion of the year and Champions League winner should be a special motiv@@ ational sy@@ ringe .

company satisfied with the rh@@ ein@@ land @-@ pf@@ äl@@ z@@ isches Minister : economy pra@@ ises Wis@@ sings Tempo
it was often irre@@ conc@@ il@@ able , the relationship between the country and the regional economy , when E@@ vel@@ ine Lem@@ ke ( Green ) was still the Minister of Economic Affairs of Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ in@@ ate .
this is after more than a year in which the new Minister of Economy Volker Wis@@ sing ( F@@ DP ) is in office .
chambers and companies from the region speak on T V request of a change in economic policy - and at the same time t@@ ad the old Minister .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Frank N@@ atus , Chairman of the Association of Tri@@ erer companies ( V@@ TU ) , says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wis@@ ser attacks the wishes of the economy that Lem@@ ke all@@ es@@ amt blocked . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the biggest turn@@ around sees N@@ atus in infrastructure policy : the gap between the Autobahn 1 between Kel@@ berg and A@@ den@@ au is now at the top of the country &apos;s priority list .
still this year the Ministry hopes for a planning process , until 2021 the construction law is supposed to stand .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a role in the plans of the country also plays the western enc@@ ir@@ cle@@ ment of Trier , which stands in the urgent need of the Bundes@@ verkehr@@ swe@@ ge@@ Plan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the aim is to take the route into operation in December 2020 , says Minister Spe@@ aker Cornelia Hol@@ t@@ mann .
N@@ atus sees in it a sign to support regional , but internationally competing companies .
the Chamber of Commerce and Industry ( I@@ HK ) Trier streams , as is stim@@ ulated by Wis@@ ser , in wine a Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ in@@ ate label to increase sales in supermarkets and stop the trend of the German wine exports rising for ten years .
in addition , Wis@@ sing has an open ear for people who want to establish their own company , praise the Chamber of Commerce .
the Chamber of Cra@@ fts Trier sees an additional incenti@@ ve for young train@@ ees in the new Master @-@ Bonus , says managing director Matthias Schwal@@ bach .
a bonus of 1000 Euros for the completed master test and 2500 euros , if graduates are self @-@ employed within ten years of the master education .
but the home@@ work list for the country remains long .
with the planned road construction , there are quick facts to create , at the same time there is no need for the country to provide the necessary personnel , says Jan Glo@@ ck@@ auer , Managing Director of the Chamber of Commerce in Trier .
of 56 new engineers who want to hire wis@@ sing at the state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ art mobility , only 29 jobs are occupied .
the Chamber requires more orders to be awarded to external offices .
C@@ DU spokes@@ person Christian Bald@@ auf points to calculations of the Court of Aud@@ itors , the country invested in 2017 and in 2018 more than 20 million euros less than suggested by country roads .
Frank N@@ atus also expects a concept of the country to resolve the short@@ age of skilled workers in the region .
the present broad@@ band construction in the country is more serious .
in 2016 , regional companies had rated power supply in an I@@ HK @-@ survey with a rating of 3.4 .
they compl@@ ained about obst@@ in@@ ate Internet connections and break@@ through@@ s .
on the other hand , ex @-@ Economic Minister E@@ vel@@ ine Lem@@ ke is currently out of politics and is still sitting in the super@@ visory board of the wind power company Pro Wind .
the Green Group left Lem@@ ke in April to become President of a private university in Karlsruhe - where they already cleared the field after four months due to dis@@ agreements .
Audi should change 85@@ 0,000 diesel vehicles - car manufacturers meet with a counter reaction
one day before the announcement of Audi , BMW announced that it would offer to update the software in more than 35@@ 0,000 vehicles .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the BMW Chairman said that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are more intelligent options than driving constra@@ ints , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and related to European cities - including Munich , where BMW is based - to ban or restri@@ ct diesel vehicles . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Daimler announced on Tuesday that there will be three million Mercedes cars in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions .
none of the companies described the under@@ tak@@ ings as a recall .
European automotive manufacturers have strongly encouraged the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support the compliance of carbon dioxide emissions rules .
but nitrogen oxi@@ des that em@@ it diesel engines are considered to be car@@ cin@@ ogen@@ ic and can cause as@@ thma .
the cost of autom@@ obil@@ es to install systems for the neutr@@ alization of exhaust gases , which makes it difficult for autom@@ obil@@ es to keep the price of cars competitive .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also accused of for@@ getting the powerful car companies and ignor@@ ing the signs of the problem .
the companies try to avoid the errors of Volkswagen , which could regulate the use of so @-@ called de@@ preci@@ ation devices that regulate emissions in order to comply with the rules when a car was tested , but revers@@ ed in normal driving conditions .
several Volkswagen employees were indi@@ cted in the United States , others were examined on both sides of the Atlantic .
last month , the former head of ther@@ mod@@ ynam@@ ics was arrested in the engine development of Audi in Germany .
the former manager , Z@@ ac@@ ch@@ eo Giovanni P@@ ami@@ o , is Italian and is therefore not protected from delivery and could be tried in the United States .
at the beginning of this year , Audi was involved in German criminal investigation at Volkswagen , after the authorities accused Audi having installed a system to circum@@ vent emissions regulations in Europe , and a request that was focused on the United States has been expanded .
the incorpor@@ ation of Audi into the investigation could wei@@ gh Volkswagen heavy : the luxury car manufacturer contributes in disp@@ rop@@ or@@ tion@@ ately to Volkswagen &apos;s profit .

Mor@@ dil@@ los Kn@@ oll@@ enn@@ ases and the laughter against the suffering
Mor@@ di@@ llo has been one of the most publi@@ ci@@ zed carto@@ on dra@@ fts@@ men , the Kn@@ oll@@ enn@@ asen of his characters are his trademark .
also with 85 the Argent@@ ine@@ an still draws and works in a film .
&quot; &quot; &quot; his message : laughter , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for there is too much suffering in the world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Guill@@ ermo Mor@@ di@@ llo was born on 4 August 1932 as the son of Spanish immigrants in Buenos Aires .
in the first years as an artist , he proposed himself as an artist for bl@@ iss cards - which fru@@ str@@ ated him .
&quot; the happ@@ i@@ est day in my professional life was the day when I lost my job , &quot; he once said .
after stops in Lima , New York and Paris , at the end of the 60 &apos;s the breakthrough came : with the publication of his carto@@ ons in &quot; Paris Match , &quot; and then also in the &quot; star &quot; and other leading magazines around the world .
even in China Mor@@ di@@ llo found many fans .
again and again the artist was inspired by cities .
large , rounded Mor@@ di@@ llo characters cav@@ ort in drawings with the Le@@ aning Tower of Pisa , Big Ben in London and the Red Square in Moscow .
in the early morning , he report@@ edly still sits in the drawing @-@ table today , works almost ten hours a day .
about cal@@ end@@ ars , puzzles , books for young and old , t @-@ shirts , pl@@ ush toys and watches keep his funny figures still widely spread worldwide .
for six years he has been working on a carto@@ on film and a TV series with his characters .
the protagon@@ ist in the movie &quot; Cra@@ zy Island &quot; is a gir@@ affe - Mor@@ dil@@ los popular animal in his drawings - who has a thous@@ and@@ fold as an opponent .
for the first time , his figures speak in 3D film , which should come to the film screen in 2019 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know exactly what they will say it &apos;s wei@@ rd for me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Mor@@ di@@ llo . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the script is not written by him .
therefore he relies more on the TV series , which , like his original drawings , is produced by wor@@ dless .
lav@@ ender from Provence is threatened by climate change
it has become a symbol of Provence in the South of France , but there is a warning that it is threatened by climate change .
the lav@@ ender is decl@@ ining because of the conditions that are remin@@ is@@ cent of dro@@ ught and due to the illnesses that are transmitt@@ ing insects , what scientists and farmers trying to find solutions , causing great head@@ aches .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Eric Cha@@ isse , expert of the agricultural research institute CRI@@ EP@@ P@@ AM in Provence , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the lav@@ ender in Provence is effectively endangered because the plant has been exposed to the effects of climate change over the past few years , which in spring has much less rain and in the autumn much more . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this has implications for the life of lav@@ ender .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there is also a small pi@@ ke , a micro@@ bacter@@ ium that transm@@ its the d@@ warf c@@ zi@@ k@@ thread , and with very dry weather , there are a lot of it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and there is much on the game .
lav@@ ender oil is not only available for ho@@ liday@@ makers , it is also very popular for perf@@ ume and cosmetics .
Eric Cha@@ isse said : &quot; instead of having very long plant drilling with a large number of flowers , we have smaller , under@@ developed and either missing or weak@@ ened .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so we have fewer parts with essential oil . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the solutions that are considered include better water distribution and ev@@ ap@@ oration of ev@@ ap@@ oration from the ground , but also the spra@@ ying of plants with a protective blend of clay and water and the development of varieties that are more resistant to dro@@ ught .

the assass@@ ination of a journalist under@@ lines the growing threat in Mexico
the employees of the weekly Ri@@ odo@@ ce meet usually on Wedn@@ es@@ days to review their plans for reporting on the recent chaos in the state of Sin@@ alo@@ a by organised crime , corrupt officials and in@@ cess@@ ant drug wars .
but on that day , in the shadow of their own trag@@ edy , they came together to talk about security .
they were told that it is important to change their routines .
two high @-@ ranking journalists discuss what feels more secure : they are supposed to take their children into the office , which in 2009 were the target of an attack with gr@@ en@@ ades , or leaving them at home .
security experts have written three words on a tablet at the front of the room : opponents , neutral , allies .
they ask the re@@ por@@ ters to propose names for each column - no evidence is necessary , percep@@ tions and gut feelings .
there are drug sm@@ ug@@ gl@@ ers , politicians , business@@ men , journalists who are suspected of standing on the pay@@ roll list of government or cart@@ els , a catalog of crimin@@ als that make the chaos of Mexico dangerous .
there is no rest break from violence , and while in the whole country the bodies pile up , more and more journalists are there : at least 25 , since President En@@ rique P@@ ena Nie@@ to entered into office in December 2012 . 589 are facing attacks and threats under federal protection and until now there have been at least seven dead in seven states this year .
among the latter is her editor and her inspir@@ er of Ri@@ odo@@ ce , co @-@ founder J@@ avier Val@@ dez Car@@ den@@ as .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and be a journalist , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote Val@@ dez in one of his numerous books on violence in connection with drugs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
his absence is felt deeply even though his presence is present everywhere - a large picture of Val@@ dez , which shows his middle finger with the word &quot; Justice , &quot; hang@@ s on the facade of the Ri@@ odo@@ ce building . two re@@ por@@ ters in the thir@@ ties , Aaron I@@ bar@@ ra and Mi@@ riam R@@ ami@@ rez , wear t @-@ shirts which show his sm@@ iling face with glasses or his typical Panam@@ ah@@ ut .
the workshop takes place less than two months after his death , and the re@@ por@@ ters discuss their shared issues , the trau@@ ma , their night@@ mar@@ es , sle@@ e@@ pl@@ ess@@ ness , par@@ ano@@ ia .
although a Son@@ der @-@ Bundes@@ an@@ walt@@ schaft was established in 2010 in order to process the cases of journalists , it has conducted only two criminal proceedings , according to the Committee for the Protection of Journ@@ alists .
as with most thousands of mur@@ ders linked to drug traff@@ icking and organised crime every year , the mur@@ der@@ ers of journalists are rarely brought to court .
in Ri@@ odo@@ ce , they still ins@@ ist on treating the violence of Sin@@ alo@@ a although they are in@@ separ@@ able and although the terrain is still more tra@@ itor .
without any information about the mur@@ der@@ ers , without justice , the meeting to discuss security has little value , says I@@ bar@@ ra .
&quot; it is very stup@@ id to waste my time in this workshop , &quot; he says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as long as we don &apos;t know the Why , we all &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mist@@ rust . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the morning of 15 May , Val@@ dez left the office of the newspaper Ri@@ odo@@ ce in the province capital of Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
he only managed to drive a few blocks away before his red Toyota Cor@@ olla was stopped by two men . he was forced out of his car and was shot 12 times , probably because of the name of the newspaper - which is translated with &quot; T@@ wel@@ ve river . &quot;
the sho@@ oter drove away in his car and damaged it nearby .
Val@@ dez was 50 years old .
he left a woman and two adult children .
rum@@ ors tend to fly freely in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
but on the subject of Val@@ dez there is practically nothing but silence .
since Gu@@ z@@ man &apos;s arrest last year and delivery to the United States in January , Sin@@ alo@@ a has become one of the bloo@@ dies@@ t batt@@ le@@ fields of the country , since ri@@ val fac@@ tions are fighting here to fill the vacuum .
it does not matter that in Sin@@ alo@@ a anyone or several people are shot on the street every day or that the Grav@@ ey@@ ard is full of tri@@ cky , two @-@ storey m@@ aus@@ ole@@ ums for drug kings that are larger than many homes for the living .
&quot; &quot; &quot; forget for a minute that there is a state of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; peace &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if only a cart@@ el has control over the coastal state with its precious har@@ bours and drug trade routes in the United States . &quot; &quot; &quot;
despite the fact that Val@@ dez was aware of the dangers of his work , Is@@ mail Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez ( 60 ) , a co @-@ founder and director of Ri@@ odo@@ ce , broke the blame on that he could not protect his friend .
he believes that two mis@@ understand@@ ings have contributed to the murder .
first of all , in February , there was the publication of an interview with Damascus , a leader of one of the ri@@ val cart@@ el fr@@ actions in the war with Gu@@ z@@ man &apos;s sons .
this publication may have anger@@ ed the children , presum@@ ed hard@@ ships bought each copy of the issue as soon as they were shipped to newspaper ki@@ os@@ ks .
the second mistake was to force Val@@ dez not to leave the country on its own security after the sei@@ z@@ ure of another newspaper , which had published the same story .
Val@@ dez was a legend in Mexico and abroad , and his killing is regarded as a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists .
he had survived so long that his friends and colleagues accepted that he would always be there .
he worked as an experienced re@@ porter for Nor@@ o@@ este in 2003 when he joined with five colleagues to establish Ri@@ odo@@ ce and sold 50 US dollars of shar@@ ehol@@ dings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in Sin@@ alo@@ a , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was impossible to run journ@@ alism without encounter@@ ing smoking problem , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez . &quot; &quot; &quot;
over time , the newspaper earned a reputation for cour@@ ageous and honest reporting , and sales and advertising increased .
re@@ por@@ ters loved to be able to publish harsh investigations without fear of c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship , and the readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that no one else dar@@ ed to treat .
&quot; &quot; &quot; eight years after the establishment of Ri@@ odo@@ ce , it received the prestigious &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Maria Mo@@ ors Cab@@ ot Prize &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for their coverage in Latin America . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the same year , Val@@ dez won the &apos; International Press Freedom Award &apos; of the committee for the protection of journalists for his courage in pursuing the Mexican drug history wherever it led .
he voluntarily gave him that he was afraid .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to continue living , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said at the time of CP@@ J award . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; drug traff@@ icking in Sin@@ alo@@ a is a way of life , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said last October in an interview with Rom@@ pe@@ vi@@ ento @-@ TV . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you need to take over the task you become a journalist - either that or you play the dum@@ my . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want to be asked : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what did you do in the face of so many mur@@ ders ... why did you not say what was going on ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ri@@ odo@@ ce team missing Val@@ dez , the Sp@@ a@@ ß@@ vogel that could flood like a do@@ ck@@ worker , the friend who was generous with h@@ ug@@ s and advice , a teacher who knew how to survive .
they trusted in his routine .
he would always wear his hat .
he would always go to El Guay@@ abo , the bar opposite the office , and always sit there at the same table .
&quot; &quot; &quot; now they ask , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was his love for routine his ruin ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his death has also forced them to question their own assu@@ mp@@ tions about how they can best do their job and stay alive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they don &apos;t like it if you deal with their wives , their children , their clean stores , their secret startup and run@@ ways &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to move drugs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these things were not allowed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the result is , even in the best times , a high degree of self @-@ c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship and self @-@ preservation .
trust his own inst@@ in@@ cts .
if it sm@@ ells wrong , keep away from it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the trouble is , the editor of the Ri@@ odo@@ ce And@@ res Vill@@ ar@@ real said that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; smell is a sense that can be decei@@ ved ... and then the matter with J@@ avier is happening . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the old rules , as he and others say , are no longer valid in Sin@@ alo@@ a - as did in Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as , Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z , Gu@@ err@@ ero and other states in which a po@@ ison@@ ous mixture of lu@@ cr@@ ative sm@@ ug@@ gling routes , weak institutions and corrupt government officials at home .
the landscape is changing constantly .
in the space where the employees of Ri@@ odo@@ ce met security training , no mobile phones were suddenly allowed . days before it became known that spy@@ ware , which is sold exclusively to governments , was used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico .
outside , two polic@@ emen were looking for protection against the heat of 104 degrees ( 40 ° C ) in the shadow of a tree .
they were commissioned by the state government to protect the offices of Ri@@ odo@@ ce in a four @-@ storey building in a mid @-@ class neighborhood of Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
half of the jo@@ ke , some of the re@@ por@@ ters asked themselves whether these officers belong to the 50 per cent of the polic@@ emen who signed the governor himself as un@@ trust@@ worthy .
it is months since the re@@ por@@ ters have gone into the mountain landscape , where the drug gangs de fac@@ to are under control .
for the issue of this week , Ri@@ odo@@ ce has blocked three main stories .
there was assass@@ ination of the brother of the former famous Box@@ ers Ju@@ lio Ces@@ ar Cha@@ vez in Sin@@ alo@@ a .
they also had an expos@@ é to the government spending , which concentrated on the provincial town of the governor .
and there was a group that was in one of the most expensive restaurants in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an , a blo@@ c from the office of the Prosec@@ utor , conducted a kid@@ n@@ apping .
there was no official word about who was kid@@ n@@ apped or as it happened , so be careful when it was time to write what everyone in the city knows : that the restaurant is a favorite local of drug dealers and authorities .
a re@@ porter made public record that the restaurant was registered under the name of a polit@@ ician who ruled the ruling Institu@@ tional Revolution Party ( PR@@ I ) , which dominated almost the whole century all political levels .
recently , several PR@@ I @-@ govern@@ ors were accused of corruption .
Vill@@ ar@@ real asked the re@@ porter to write about previous inci@@ dents in this location , including one where a son of &quot; El Chap@@ o &quot; Gu@@ z@@ man escaped a military attack .
only a few months before , readers would have viewed the colum@@ n@@ ist of Val@@ dez as the best informed source of kid@@ n@@ apping .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once we had known what &apos;s going on , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Vill@@ ar@@ real , 46 , with the nick@@ name &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; El Fl@@ aco &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of his slender body stat@@ ure . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now all channels of communication with our sources are broken . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the office of Val@@ dez was dedicated to the storage room for signs and stick@@ ers protest@@ ing against the mur@@ ders of journalists , because the employees have become something they never expected : activists in the name of the press .
re@@ porter Mi@@ riam R@@ ami@@ rez d@@ ashed a few signs and went to a demonstration in the next morning because of another journalist for the office of the prosec@@ utor .
Salvador Ad@@ ame disappeared three days after Val@@ dez had been killed , in the western state of Mi@@ cho@@ ac@@ an .
a burned body was discovered and officials say , based on DNA testing that it is its .
journalists all over the country have become more lou@@ der by written down in organized protests &quot; SOS Press &quot; on wal@@ k@@ ways and constructions .
this day , the director Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez is in Washington and tries to collect international support for the judi@@ ci@@ ary in the case of Val@@ dez .
at a meeting with the governor of Sin@@ alo@@ a on the day following the assass@@ ination of Val@@ dez , R@@ ami@@ rez accused the authorities to sp@@ ill up journalists and leave them because they said the truth .
she has since been asked to re@@ unite her by the government because she is worried that her anger has viol@@ ated her obj@@ ectiv@@ ity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Val@@ dez had repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico were &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; surrounded &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Mexico by organised crime , the government officials and a indiffer@@ ent society . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in his last book &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Nar@@ co @-@ Journ@@ alism &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he wrote that re@@ por@@ ters are not only killed by drug gangs , but also on the orders of politicians and security forces committed under a ceiling with organised crime . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the media coverage group &quot; artic@@ ulo 19 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has attributed more than half of the attacks to journalists of the police and officials over the past year . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Mexico you die because they want you to hold the mouth , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said R@@ ami@@ rez . &quot; &quot; &quot;
obviously , the mur@@ ders have a det@@ err@@ ent effect .
nobody for@@ gets the death of the blo@@ gger Maria Elizabeth M@@ aci@@ as in the northern border state of Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as six years ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; her body was found together with a note that was allegedly signed by the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Z@@ etas @-@ Kart@@ ell &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here I am about my reports . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a computer keyboard and head@@ phones were beside their separate head .
some branches have chosen to include the newspaper El Norte in the northern border state of Ch@@ ihu@@ ah@@ ua after the assass@@ ination of correspon@@ dent Mi@@ ros@@ lava Bre@@ ach in March .
others continue , as El Man@@ ana of Nu@@ evo Laredo did after the assass@@ ination of her director in 2004 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in 2010 , the Di@@ ario de Ci@@ ud@@ ad Ju@@ are@@ z publicly launched the drug cart@@ els with a editorial on the front page with the heading &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; What do you want from us ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some journalists are fled from their home states or even from the country .
it is a painful decision .
it is hard to find work in exile , and they still observe the streets and search for dangers .
and sometimes they are hun@@ ted as evi@@ dently the photographer Ru@@ ben Esp@@ in@@ osa , who was mur@@ dered in 2015 along with four women in an apartment in Mexico City three months after the escape from Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z .
for those who remain behind and continue work , it is a daily dance with ris@@ ky decisions .
I@@ bar@@ ra , who once wanted to be a poet , adm@@ its that drug traff@@ icking might fri@@ gh@@ ten him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mexico is going to hell and therefore I became re@@ porter , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at midnight on the last Friday , when the last issue was already finished , the editors of Ri@@ odo@@ ce sat before the office and d@@ rank beer when all their phones began to sum@@ mon .
a number of sho@@ ot@@ ings with ri@@ val ri@@ val and security forces close to the spa town Maz@@ at@@ lan had left 19 confirmed T@@ ote .
the war continued to escal@@ ate , as promised by a number of cart@@ el emb@@ assi@@ es in the region .
from the Bord@@ estone edge they have published the news on the website of Ri@@ odo@@ ce via mobile phone .
the front page had to be changed the next day .
sir@@ ens are nearby - another shooting in the area .
Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez threw a look at the polic@@ emen who kept guard to see if they were in read@@ iness .
if they were afraid , they did not show it .
under the huge portrait of the fallen founder of the newspaper , whose middle finger was visible for all Sin@@ alo@@ a , the employees of Ri@@ odo@@ ce followed his traces .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how can you just think about it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if on the same day that J@@ avier was mur@@ dered , the train@@ ees asked me to send them to the street . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
din@@ osau@@ rs used cam@@ ouflage to avoid its enemies
at first glance it looks like a statue , al@@ beit a fri@@ ghtening .
&quot; &quot; &quot; researchers found that the first findings of the incredible r@@ hin@@ oc@@ eros of a Canadian mountain labor@@ er have been so well received that experts described it as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mon@@ a Lisa of the Din@@ osau@@ rs &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was so good that they could even notice that his sc@@ aly skin was of red@@ dish brown - and they said they had something of a &quot; troubled past . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the report in the journal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Current Biology &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; described him as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the uphol@@ stered Din@@ osau@@ rs , who has ever been found , and one of the best din@@ osau@@ r copies of the world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the fossil is a newly discovered type of no@@ dose @-@ carrier , which lived in the middle of the C@@ ret@@ ace@@ ous period between 110 million and 112 million years ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; its incredibly well preserved condition has aston@@ ished researchers who described it as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; really remarkable . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to reports in National Geo@@ graphic , the ar@@ mo@@ red plant @-@ glut@@ ton is the best preserved fossil of its kind .
it was found by Sha@@ wn Funk , when he was buried in the Sun@@ cor Millen@@ ium mine on 21 March 2011 near Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the north of Alber@@ ta , Canada .
he met something that seemed mis@@ leading from the surrounding rock and decided to look more closely .
the fossil was sent to the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rell Museum of Pal@@ e@@ ont@@ ology .
they spent the next six years to un@@ cover the wild animal within the 2,500 pounds ( 1,@@ 100 kg ) heavy underground pump@@ ing .
after all this hard work , the finished result is now ready to be revealed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you just blin@@ king a little with your eyes , you could almost believe that it slept , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the main author Cal@@ eb Brown , scientist at the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rell Museum , where the creature is to be seen . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will enter the history of science as one of the most beautiful and best preserved din@@ osau@@ r specimens - the Mon@@ a Lisa of the din@@ osau@@ r . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
researchers found that these her@@ bi@@ vo@@ res , although it is covered with an arm@@ or and re@@ sembles a changing shell , probably was threatened by meat @-@ eating din@@ osau@@ rs .
the heavily arm@@ oured din@@ osau@@ r used a red and white cam@@ ouflage to hide from pre@@ dat@@ ors , and used a sh@@ iel@@ ding technique known as counter@@ sh@@ ading , which is also used by many modern animals .
this would have allowed to blend better into its surroundings and to avoid its enemies , say experts , suggest@@ ing that it was threatened by larger din@@ osau@@ rs .
the 110 million years old creature from the family of the No@@ dos@@ au@@ r has made head@@ lines for the first time in May and is now to be seen in the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rell Museum of Pal@@ ae@@ ont@@ ology .
researchers have now studied the wild animal and named Bo@@ real@@ op@@ el@@ ta mark@@ c@@ ch@@ elli after the museum engineer Mark Mit@@ ch@@ ell , one of a team who spent more than 7,@@ 000 hours to cover it carefully .
the amazing preservation of the specimen allowed Dr. Mit@@ ch@@ ell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and the form of scales and arm@@ or over his body .
they discovered the confront@@ ation , a widespread defense method in the animal kingdom , meaning that the lace of the creature was dar@@ ker than its under@@ side .
although the con@@ ter@@ sh@@ ading is common , the results are surprising as the size of Bo@@ real@@ op@@ el@@ ta by far exceeds the animals living today .
it suggests that the din@@ osau@@ r of enough pressure was hun@@ ted by meat e@@ ore din@@ osau@@ rs that the evolution fav@@ oured the conce@@ al@@ ment of confront@@ ation as a means of survival .
but most contemporary animals that use the counter sh@@ ading - think of deer , zeb@@ ras or ar@@ ma@@ dil@@ los - are much smaller and vulnerable than loo@@ t , which signals that this no@@ dose @-@ carrier was exposed to a real fight for survival .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; strong pre@@ dat@@ ory behaviour on a massive , heavily arm@@ oured din@@ osau@@ r show how dangerous the din@@ osau@@ rs must have been the C@@ ret@@ ace@@ ous time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Brown said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the skin of the din@@ osau@@ r was bay @-@ brown .
scientists continue to examine the animal on reference to his life , including his con@@ served intestinal content to find out what it &apos;s eaten as his last meal .
they believe that the din@@ osau@@ r , when he died , came into a river and went out into the sea where he sank on the back to the sea .
at that time , Alber@@ ta was as warm as South Fl@@ ori@@ da today , and rivers and oceans probably more widespread than they are today .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this no@@ dose @-@ carrier is really remarkable because it is completely covered with con@@ served skin but also preserved in three dimensions and maintains the original form of the animal , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Brown said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the result is that the animal looks almost exactly the same today as in the early C@@ ret@@ ace@@ ous period . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you don &apos;t need to use much fantasy to re@@ construct it . if you only have a little with your eyes , you could almost believe that it is sleeping . &quot;
the C@@ ret@@ ace@@ ous time was a time when huge thermop@@ o@@ ds , car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ r that were standing on two legs crossed the earth .
although the king of them , who lived Ty@@ ran@@ n@@ osau@@ rus Re@@ x , millions of years after Bo@@ real@@ op@@ el@@ ta , the arm@@ oured din@@ osau@@ r was hun@@ ted by some of his terri@@ fying ancestors .
this includes the Acro@@ can@@ th@@ osau@@ rus , a 38 foot ( 11,@@ 5 m ) long , six tons heavy monster .
the scientists whose latest findings appear in the journal &apos; Current Biology &apos; believe that Bo@@ real@@ op@@ el@@ ta sank after death in the sea and was m@@ um@@ i@@ fied in mud .
the creature was found by Sha@@ wn Funk , when he was buried in the Sun@@ cor Millen@@ ium mine on 21 March 2011 near Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the north of Alber@@ ta , Canada .
according to the museum , it is the uphol@@ stered arm@@ oured din@@ osau@@ rs in the world , including skin and arm@@ or , and is completely from the mu@@ zzle to the hip .
the creatures were weigh@@ ed about 18 feet ( 5 meters ) in average and weigh@@ ed up to 3.000 pounds ( 1.@@ 300 kg ) .
it contained two 20 @-@ inch @-@ long sp@@ ik@@ es , which rag@@ ed from his shoulders .
the researchers believe that the ge@@ ther@@ ed her@@ bi@@ vo@@ res were swe@@ pt through the Western Canada until a floo@@ ded river floo@@ ded it into the open sea .
but the underwater @-@ cre@@ mation of the din@@ osau@@ r kept his arm@@ or in exquisite detail .
the pet@@ ri@@ fied remains of this special specimen are so well preserved that the Hau@@ tre@@ ste still covers hol@@ ded ar@@ mo@@ red plates along the din@@ osau@@ r
as Michael Gre@@ sh@@ ko has written for National Geo@@ graphic , such a level of preservation is as rare as a winning in the lot@@ tery .
the more I see it , the more conf@@ using it becomes .
pet@@ ri@@ fied resi@@ du@@ es of the skin still cover the hol@@ pri@@ zed arm@@ oured plates that carry the skull of the animal .
his right fore@@ foot rests on his side , his five fingers are spread to the top .
I can count the scales on his sole . &quot;
in the th@@ under@@ storm : Mass@@ enk@@ ar@@ amb@@ ol@@ age on A8 : many injured
heavy accident on Thursday evening on the A8 : nearly 30 vehicles are involved in a mass arc@@ ade .
there are numerous injured , mile @-@ long st@@ ems - and g@@ aff@@ er .
on the motorway Stuttgart @-@ Munich ( A8 ) , about 20 people were injured during a mass ar@@ amb@@ ol@@ age on Thursday afternoon .
according to the police first data of the police were between the connections Adel@@ z@@ hausen and O@@ del@@ z@@ hausen ( Ai@@ ch@@ ach @-@ Fried@@ berg district ) during a th@@ under@@ storm , nearly 30 vehicles , among them probably trucks , crashed .
at first there are no information about the exact number of the injured .
it was an easy to moderate injury , said a police spokes@@ man .
a large range of b@@ ail@@ out vehicles was at the accident site .
the A8 was completely closed in the direction of Munich .
in the direction of Munich , a ten @-@ kilomet@@ re @-@ long back@@ stab@@ au was formed .
as reported by a AZ @-@ re@@ porter , it also came on the counter@@ part to massive disabilities - through numerous g@@ aff@@ ers .
the fire bri@@ g@@ ade listed the characteristics of the vehicle drivers who now have to reck@@ on with sensitive pen@@ alties .
shortly after 18 : 45 a second accident occurred on the A8 , this time between Augsburg and D@@ asing .
it was a coll@@ ision between an automobile transpor@@ ter and a passenger car .
a helicop@@ ter was on the way to the accident .
Deutsche Bahn : group tests &quot; Comfort Check @-@ in &quot;
it &apos;s a moment that almost everyone has ever experienced : you sit in the train and sleep .
or one is deep@@ ened into his work and has just a brilliant mind .
and then : buffer .
comes the Schaff@@ ner and awak@@ ens an uns@@ us@@ p@@ ected or e@@ ats the passenger in the middle of the workflow .
chassis control .
but the times of inter@@ rup@@ tions are over soon .
the Deutsche Bahn is currently testing the paper@@ less chassis control .
you simply confirm by phone that you take your seat and thereby vali@@ date the ticket .
a test operation is currently running on two routes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; come the offer , we extend it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it will probably be available in Germany at the beginning of next year , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a railway speaker . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comfort Check @-@ in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is called the railway card de@@ valu@@ ation without Schaff@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in order to be able to use it , however , some requirements must be met : you need a smartphone or tablet .
and you have to book an online ticket - which is already the most passengers do anyway .
you also have to buy it via the app of the train , the DB Navigator , which is the most convenient way of ticket booking anyway .
and finally you need a seat reservation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; because the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Comfort Check @-@ in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; works : one gets into the train , calling his ticket under &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; My Tickets &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the test customers , a button for electronic de@@ valu@@ ation will then appear .
the train companions receive a message on their mobile devices that Pass@@ enger X is in the train and has taken the reserved seat Y .
when the train companion comes to place Y , he knows that there is a passenger sitting with an already vali@@ dated online ticket .
so one can continue to sleep , keep on working , keep silent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Check @-@ in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has two advantages : one for the customer , one for the railway - which in turn should use the passengers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; who wants to travel relaxed without ticket inspection by our train staff , just checks in the DB Explorer itself . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this allows passengers to person@@ alise their journey time by train , &quot; says Michael Peter@@ son , Marketing Manager of DB Fern@@ verkehr .
&quot; &quot; &quot; second Plus : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and our employees have more time than today to respond to individual customer needs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
those who take the train often know that in addition to delays and missed trains , the chassis control is one of the biggest off@@ s .
because often you have , in any case , however , one of the passengers does not need all the documents you need for the de@@ valu@@ ation of online tickets .
either the credit card or the ID card or otherwise a document you have to suggest .
the result is endless discussions between tractor and passenger , which leads to bad mood in the part or greater space and delays in controlling one &apos;s own ticket and the creator at the end takes the time to take care of other matters .
only a small number of test customers can use the new service .
and that &apos;s only on the connections ICE 915 Dortmund @-@ Stuttgart and ICE 912 Stuttgart @-@ Essen .
further access numbers on the same route are not yet un@@ locked .
&quot; &quot; &quot; how an activ@@ ist came to learn the answer to the question : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on 9 August 2014 , Br@@ itt@@ any Fer@@ rell was sh@@ aken up to her core .
only one day after arriving in New York City , the one in St. Louis was sitting on the bed of a Air@@ b@@ n@@ b apartment that she rented and sc@@ rolled through Facebook on her phone .
she stum@@ bled across a post from someone from High School .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police had just killed a 18 @-@ year old child , and it is still on the street , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said it there . &quot; &quot; &quot;
confused , since no one else posted the information on their feed , she closed Facebook and opened Twitter .
a user with the Hand@@ le @ The@@ e@@ Phar@@ o@@ ah was constantly prayed on her tim@@ eline .
the rap@@ per from the area of St. Louis was the death of Michael Brown , an un@@ armed black 18 @-@ year @-@ old who was killed by a white polic@@ eman in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , Mon .
he posted a picture of Brow@@ ns &apos;s empty body that was stretched out on the street and would stay there four hours .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is wild , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thought Fer@@ rell . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but death was nothing new for her and her community .
she left her mobile phone to twe@@ et on the Can@@ field @-@ Drive to twe@@ ets later in the evening .
there were photos from police band and people who cried out , and from a man who claimed to be Brow@@ ns &apos;s father who had a sign with the in@@ scription : &quot; F@@ erg@@ us@@ on police just killed my un@@ armed son ! &quot;
she watched a live feed with which a polic@@ eman was standing in front of a group of demonstr@@ ators with a bar@@ king dog .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in another video , she said , un@@ secured another polic@@ eman his ri@@ f@@ le and cried : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will kill you ... animals all kill . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not common , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he remembered her statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not the type of murder we have ac@@ custom@@ ed to and which we can name typical . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at that moment I felt sh@@ aken .
I was angry and we@@ pt . &quot;
she booked a return flight and went home the next day .
after landing at 23 o &apos;clock she took her 6 @-@ year @-@ old daughter from her father &apos;s house and decided that the two would drive to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on the next morning .
what happened in the following three years with Fer@@ rell and F@@ erg@@ us@@ on is the theme of a new documentary film , &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? , &quot; in cinem@@ as from 11 .
it is a story of survival and protest , love and loss , strength and resistance , which consists of the viewpoint of people who live in the community and have filled the streets to demand answers .
as Fer@@ rell and her daughter , who wor@@ e a flo@@ g@@ dress and a matching crown to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , the two discussed a conversation that she had countless times before this morning &quot; on the black experience and the black state . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you remember how I taught you when black people have to fight for what they believe ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she remembered what she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we now go to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on because the police killed a 18 year old boy and that wasn &apos;t right . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I couldn &apos;t take her with me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ rell later . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what happened today is a highlight of what happened in the past . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it must know it and see it and be raised in it .
it must be well developed , not only acti@@ vis@@ m and organization , but also the various layers of black experience and the black Constitution and what we have to do to free ourselves to free ourselves .
even if I have the luck to give her an experience in which she personally does not experience any ek@@ lat@@ ist rac@@ ism , she is not different from the next black women child .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I feel I would have a bad service to keep them away from it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the first station , when they arrived in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , was located at the South Flor@@ iss@@ ant Road , a place opposite the police agency that became a camping area when the activists were waiting for the possible non @-@ accus@@ ation by Officer Dar@@ ren Wilson .
there Fer@@ rell and her daughter were connected to a local business owner who made lunch .
they prepared bags before and helped to pass them on demonstr@@ ators .
slowly began a new type of acti@@ vis@@ m for Fer@@ rell shape .
&quot; my acti@@ vis@@ m has totally changed after 9 August , &quot; she said and noticed that she was a student at the University of Mis@@ sour@@ i @-@ St. Louis , president of the Min@@ ority Student Nur@@ ses Association and concentrated on food justice and health ine@@ qualities in black communities .
&quot; I had no experience in organizing .
it is all come . &quot;
weeks later , Fer@@ rell met Sab@@ a@@ ah Fol@@ ay@@ an during an evening demonstration , one of the co @-@ directors of the film .
Fol@@ ay@@ an said she and her cam@@ er@@ aman Lucas Al@@ var@@ ado @-@ Far@@ r@@ ar wanted to &quot; document &quot; what was happening .
a question came Fer@@ rell in the sense : &quot; do you want to document or try to find a story you can use ? &quot;
this sc@@ ep@@ tic@@ ism was nour@@ ished by countless cases of people , often from wh@@ ites - in a community benef@@ iting from their pain and resi@@ li@@ ence .
as Fol@@ ay@@ an recently stated in an interview : &quot; we heard that people who were born and raised in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on have not c@@ entered their voices and we wanted to do it differently . &quot;
Fol@@ ay@@ an had already worked together with the former Co @-@ director Dam@@ on Davis , an artist from the area known for his acti@@ vis@@ m around To@@ dest@@ ra@@ kt in@@ mates .
his involvement brought Fer@@ rell the project closer together with six other locals , the team of &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; in the years after Brow@@ ns &apos;s shooting .
&quot; this documentary is not someone who speaks for us or speaks with us . we speak , &quot; Davis said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was the main thing for me , as these people are represented , for I will be represented . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the goal was not to concentrate on Fer@@ rell &apos;s experience - to show that it is not a Messi@@ ah leader , but a community that comes together , &quot; said Fol@@ ay@@ an - it proved to be the most obvious participant in the film .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as a result , documents of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; show surprising personal aspects of Fer@@ rell &apos;s life , as she falls in love and mar@@ ries her wife . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I felt like naked , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ rell and laugh@@ ed when she saw the finished product for the first time . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I understood that in this work and in the human@@ ization of black people there must be a certain vulner@@ ability . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , Fer@@ rell &apos;s history repe@@ ats the role of black women in the wider Black @-@ Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter movement .
two of the three founders of the Movement , who , after the killing of the black teen@@ ager Tra@@ y@@ von Martin , have shaped the film &quot; Black@@ Li@@ ves@@ Mat@@ ter &quot; in social media in 2012 , identify themselves as gay .
&quot; black , gay women in leadership positions have carried the movement altogether , &quot; said Fer@@ rell , &quot; and so we are constantly struggling on different fron@@ ts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; black , gay women must bear the main burden of everything . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an agreed to note that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the movement really is maintained by black women and many black women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , it insi@@ sts that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not an affir@@ m@@ ative type of action , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in which Fer@@ rell was chosen as a heart of the film because of her identity . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; she was the person who sh@@ ook this energy , &quot; she said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is no accident , although it was at the fore@@ front , because in a life at these clo@@ aks as a black , gay woman stands so much on the game . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you can feel their energy through the screen . &quot;
meanwhile , the news agencies in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on have long since disappeared , but the r@@ acial connections between the municipality and the police continue to exist .
Fer@@ rell is on prob@@ ation for 2 ½ years due to the block@@ age of a highway at a demonstration .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she describes the soci@@ opolit@@ ical atmosphere of the area she calls her home : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a chaos . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
nevertheless she cl@@ ings to a song and she feels bound to this memory since she went to the street three years ago .
&quot; it is our duty to fight for our freedom .
it is our duty to win .
we have to love and support each other .
we have nothing to lose except our chains . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; from &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dream &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; meg@@ al@@ om@@ ania &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : TV readers discuss about Bit @-@ Galerie &quot; &quot; &quot;
the bit gallery moves people , although it is not built for a long time .
but the idea of a shopping centre at the south end of the pedestrian zone out@@ lines the population in advoc@@ ates and opponents since the first presentation 2009 .
the topic hardly leaves one cold .
&quot; &quot; &quot; also on our Facebook page &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Volks@@ fre@@ und Bit@@ burg &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the topic is discussed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; while they say one to the bit gallery : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that would be a dream &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Anja Becker ) or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; This would be really great &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Nicole Schau@@ sten ) , comes from the other side : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; does not need a person &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Sig@@ gi B@@ etzen ) or simply : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Si@@ zes ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Lars Sch@@ olz ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
while the supporters claim that a gallery is attrac@@ ting more customers into the city , from which the remaining businesses benefit , the opponents fear that then the pedestrian zone is ble@@ eding .
in addition , the gallery is plan@@ ed exactly on the plot on which the farmers market hall stands , in which 13 direct mark@@ eters offer their products .
at the beginning of the construction work will be finished .
the gallery @-@ makers want to integrate a market hall into the new building - to the Bed@@ a place with the opportunity to sit outside .
Simone rooms : &quot; we have been selling almost weekly in the farmers market for many years .
mainly our eggs , but also the delicious cakes of the farmers are always happy again .
we also discovered the but@@ cher &apos;s egg for us .
we would like to see that even during and above all after the construction of the gallery there is a chance to maintain this offer .
in other cities there is also .
&quot; &quot; &quot; especially the small market hall in Frankfurt is interesting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gerd D@@ ens@@ ing : &quot; if direct mark@@ eters move in a market hall in the gallery , the amount of rent is coming .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but this is probably not likely to be low in the new project . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Eva Ki@@ lic : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what Purch@@ asing Market in Bit@@ burg ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
whether clothes , shoes , dru@@ g@@ stores or supermarkets : I think it &apos;s unnecessary .
there are enough of them in our city .
one can see how many shops here are empty here - some for months and years .
but since there is not even a weekly market , it is all the more important that at least the market hall remains .
because after all , the goods we offer is fresh , is mostly offered directly by the producer and is also inexpensive .
as you can see , store shops are rented in a shopping center only by larger companies , because the local r@@ ents are often not portable for a ret@@ ailer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; too bad , special stores are almost no longer and what is left of it will probably disappear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Wolf F@@ andel : &quot; a shopping m@@ all with a market hall does not fit for me .
and the gallery does not fit into Bit@@ burg .
first of all : where is the peasant market hall supposed to be during the construction period ?
the old E@@ de@@ ka would be the solution - even if the bit gallery is actually coming some@@ time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; or does it create the gh@@ ost bit gallery already before removing all the shops from Bit@@ burg ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
George Mar@@ quet : &quot; this will simply not work .
and a shopping centre , which is empty , no one needs .
in my opinion , it would have been better to take a real farmer &apos;s market instead of this gallery .
but for a peasant market hall , thanks to the ins@@ ane many - as I find - meaning@@ less construction projects in Bit@@ burg do not have a place anymore .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when the farmers market hall is broken , a piece of culture will disappear again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
an appropriate simil@@ arity : artist creates portraits with Chelsea Mann@@ ing DNA
in the middle of the room of the Fri@@ d@@ man Gallery in New York there are many faces to see - white , black and brown , which are almost imper@@ cep@@ tible - that hang on cables from the ceiling .
the 30 portraits were created by the artist He@@ ather De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg from W@@ angen @-@ T@@ up@@ pers and hair@@ cuts that were sent to her by Chelsea Mann@@ ing .
Mann@@ ing sent out the excer@@ pts from Fort Le@@ aven@@ worth prison , where the former secret service analy@@ st had a 35 @-@ year prison sentence , after making official diplomatic reports on the Wiki@@ Le@@ aks website .
the new exhibition opened on August 2nd , is called A Bec@@ oming re@@ semb@@ lance ( An appropriate simil@@ arity ) .
she is the product of two years correspondence between De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose discipline united their expertise in technology , computer science and art , and Mann@@ ing , a trans@@ wife and land@@ mark dis@@ sident , whose condem@@ nation was transformed by Barack Obama when he had only three days in his office .
through the algorith@@ mic analysis of DNA that was extracted by Mann@@ ing and created from the 30 portraits , how someone could look with these gen@@ om@@ ic data - the many ways how they can be interpreted and the inherent determin@@ ism of these interpret@@ ations - but also created for identity .
Mann@@ ing , who was born as Brad@@ ley Edward , but had already spoken openly about identification as a woman since her pu@@ ber@@ ty , was convi@@ cted in 2013 because of 20 charges , among them six cl@@ ashes to the es@@ pi@@ on@@ age law , computer fraud and the@@ ft .
through the prison her picture was supp@@ ressed , so much that there was only one photo - a gra@@ iny , black @-@ white Self@@ ie , in which Mann@@ ing obviously sits on a driver seat and carries a plat@@ inum blonde wig - associated with it .
in 2015 De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg was just about the great success of their 2012 project &apos; Stran@@ ger Vis@@ ions &apos; .
the artist produced portraits of stran@@ gers from for@@ en@@ sic arti@@ facts like cigar@@ ette mu@@ te and che@@ wing g@@ um by extr@@ acting the DNA from the waste to produce a picture of how these people could look like .
that was the time she received an email from a newspaper magazine .
&quot; they conducted an interview with Chelsea Mann@@ ing while she was in prison , and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article , &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg at a press preview of the new exhibition .
and she couldn &apos;t attend this time and she could not be photograph@@ ed , so she contacted Chelsea and asked her if she wanted to make a DNA portrait .
the artist and her im@@ pris@@ oned m@@ use were too un@@ equal Bri@@ eff@@ re@@ ans who exchanged several letters over the course of two years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they even created a com@@ ic &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Supp@@ ressed Images &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; illustrated by Sho@@ ili Kan@@ ung@@ o , who predicted a future in which the President of Chelsea would transform judgment and would be able to see the exhibition personally . &quot; &quot; &quot;
that Obama was actually only a few days after the book was published , to ask Mann@@ ing &apos;s release after seven brutal years in a Kan@@ sas military prison , there was a welcome type of happy meeting .
there is also now at the opening of the exhibition something low and strong , since Donald Tr@@ ump carries out a war against in@@ forman@@ ts from the government camp and against trans@@ gender troops to find new , twe@@ ez@@ able ways to avoid the rigid circuits that he should fix .
when De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg was asked for the strange timing of all these things , she said &quot; things happen for a certain reason . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a artistic statement written down on the wall of the gallery , Mann@@ ing called for an end to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; automatic frag@@ mentation , whose foundation sex , race , sexu@@ ality and culture have been . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the opposite wall its mit@@ och@@ on@@ dri@@ al DNA sequence - a thous@@ and@@ fold of Cs and Gs and As , is written in pencil .
De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg hoped , by incorpor@@ ating the 200 letters ( or nucle@@ oti@@ des after the highly developed scientific lex@@ icon of the artist ) , how aston@@ ish@@ ingly similar , at least in biological ways , we are all .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what people will hopefully take along is that our gen@@ ome doesn &apos;t care about who we are and how open genetic data for an interpretation and how subj@@ ectively they are , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose video works from 2007 , Sp@@ ave Mem@@ ories , is also visible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; DNA @-@ data can tell so many different stories , so these are 30 of these stories . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the last piece in the exhibition , which is kept in a separate room , is a page from the above mentioned com@@ ic nov@@ ella .
she shows Mann@@ ing as she emerg@@ es with a Fre@@ is@@ pre@@ cht@@ el@@ ef@@ on in his hand from the disciplines of the United States , such as King Kong .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if they make your speech cold , then they have won , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so never stop the mouth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it came directly from a letter that she wrote to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the artist , who gre@@ ets them from Philadelphia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I still get go@@ os@@ eb@@ umps when I talk about it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mann@@ ing has not seen the exhibition personally - as it was supposed to be anticipated in the com@@ ic book - but if she should do it , then she will be greeted in the middle of the room by the mas@@ ks , from their own gen@@ om@@ ic sim@@ ulations , which are like hor@@ des of prot@@ esters .
this was also focused on how everything was written in the exhibition , up to size ( 5 &quot; 2 , Mann@@ ings St@@ atur ) , where their genetic h@@ ap@@ log@@ groups were written with a pencil .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the past I had them on the wall , but I wanted them to feel like a crowd , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg from the portraits . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I wanted it to feel like a mass movement that formed with Chelsea , like the movement that was also behind their liberation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Professor of North@@ western University and one of the Oxford University accused of killing
a nation@@ wide man @-@ hunt is in progress for a professor at North@@ western University and an employee of Oxford University , who are looking for susp@@ ects after a man had been stab@@ bed in a luxurious apartment in Chicago with dead@@ ly injuries .
on Monday , W@@ yn@@ d@@ ham La@@ them ( 42 ) and Andrew War@@ ren ( 56 ) were issued arrest warran@@ ts for murder due to their alleged involvement in the death of Tr@@ ent@@ on H. James Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au , as demonstrated by the acts of the Court of C@@ ook County .
the documents say that Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au , 26 , died after several engra@@ v@@ ings .
a community warning system published by the Chicago police agency states that the cor@@ p@@ se was discovered on July 27 .
officials received a call , arrived at the Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victim with multiple injuries to his body .
Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au was still declared dead , and det@@ ec@@ tives examined the stit@@ ches as murder , while the police were actively looking for the two susp@@ ects , officials said .
La@@ them has been an associate professor for micro@@ biology and immun@@ ology at North@@ western University since 2007 .
Alan K. Cub@@ gar@@ s , the vice president for university relations , said in an email statement that La@@ them had now been judged and excluded from entering the campus of North@@ western University .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is now a criminal affair that will be examined by the competent authorities and the North@@ western University co@@ operates with this investigation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said CU@@ BO . &quot; &quot; &quot;
War@@ ren is Senior Treas@@ ury Assistant at Oxford University .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a speaker from the University and Som@@ er@@ ville College said in an email statement that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are in contact with the police in the UK and are willing to help US investig@@ ators in any way possible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the statement added that War@@ r@@ ens colleagues were sho@@ cked and want him to surrender .
chief Communications Officer of Chicago , Anthony Gug@@ li@@ el@@ mi , said he strongly urge the susp@@ ects to face the authorities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police has an idea of their where@@ ab@@ outs , and our efforts to locate them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gug@@ li@@ el@@ mi . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gug@@ li@@ el@@ mi said local , regional and national authorities help find the susp@@ ects .
Gug@@ li@@ el@@ mi said , the police got a call from the building manager of the Grand Plaza building , who had just received an en@@ ig@@ matic tip , compl@@ aining that something happened in apartment 1008 .
the police described the scene as a very cru@@ el .
Gug@@ li@@ el@@ mi said it was un@@ clear whether the incident took place on July 27 .
it was confirmed by security cameras that La@@ them and War@@ ren were in the building .
&quot; we believe Professor L@@ ath@@ am and the victim had a relationship , &quot; said Gug@@ li@@ el@@ mi .
the Grand Plaza management team published an explanation of the inhabitants : &quot; the police are currently working on the tim@@ eline and the background of the victim and explo@@ res a variety of motives , including a possible domestic incident . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will finish the WA@@ DA road@@ map in the near future &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - Russian vice @-@ president Mut@@ ko &quot; &quot; &quot;
Russian Vice President Vit@@ aly Mut@@ ko said it won &apos;t take long before the remaining criteria of the World Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing Agency ( WA@@ DA ) are implemented for the restoration of the Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing agency ( Rus@@ ada ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at a certain stage of meeting the criteria of the road@@ map , Rus@@ ada has the right to plan and test in cooperation with UK@@ AD ( UK Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the WA@@ DA road@@ map was updated in this respect , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mut@@ ko on Thursday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the PM commented on the second part of WA@@ DA &apos;s schedule to comply with the code that describes the criteria for the re @-@ entry of Rus@@ ada and was recently published on the organization &apos;s website .
according to Mut@@ ko , he does not include anything that could cause concern for Russia .
&quot; everything has been announced , everything will be implemented .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee ( I@@ OC ) and the WA@@ DA in the near future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
one of the criteria mentioned in the list , however , states that the Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing authorities have to publicly accept the reported results from the Canadian attor@@ ney Richard Mc@@ L@@ aren to publicly subsidi@@ zed state @-@ sponsored dop@@ ing in Russian sports .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in relation to the matter , Mut@@ ko said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we carry out the investigation as our anti @-@ dop@@ ing system has a mistake . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all measures have been implemented .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but there were no state programmes , and we will not admit anything that does not exist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mut@@ kos &apos;s words agreed with those of Vit@@ aly Sm@@ ir@@ nov , the leader of the independent Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing commission .
in conversation with Russian sales point r@@ sport at the beginning of the day Sm@@ ir@@ nov gave problems of the past to Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing organisations , but then added : &quot; we have repeatedly said that the report contains controversi@@ al positions and regulations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; nobody pre@@ fers to accept this report un@@ conditi@@ onally , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; added Sm@@ ir@@ nov . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Rus@@ ada was excluded in November 2015 as part of the dop@@ ing sc@@ andal of the WA@@ DA from the implementation of dop@@ ing control systems in Russia .
however , you were allowed to plan and coordinate tests under the supervision of international experts and the UK Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing ( UK@@ AD ) .
after a visit to the headquarters in Moscow in July , WA@@ DA Director General Olivier Nig@@ gli said that Rus@@ ada moved &quot; in the right direction &quot; to be used again .
Al@@ di doesn &apos;t sell eggs more
these shared the Group &apos;s groups .
it is a mere precau@@ tion , there could no longer be assumed by any health imp@@ air@@ ment , it was stated in the Communication .
from now on only eggs should be delivered to Al@@ di , which have been proven to have been tested negative on fi@@ pron@@ il@@ ein Anti @-@ L@@ utter@@ em@@ itt@@ el .
Al@@ di wanted to make clarity and transparency in his customers .
the start @-@ ups that will help your company will not become the next U@@ ber
Amy Er@@ rett wanted to measure luck with your employees at your e @-@ commerce start @-@ up , but the pol@@ ls didn &apos;t work .
answers were often v@@ ague , little helpful , or - worse - fr@@ aud@@ ul@@ ent .
and even if you promised anon@@ ym@@ ity , some workers did not trust the process .
&quot; there was simply never consistency and obj@@ ectiv@@ ity , &quot; said Er@@ rett , who runs the 75 @-@ person San Francisco e @-@ Commerce Hair Care company Ma@@ dison Re@@ ed .
she called people out of the outside for help .
a new race of Human Resources start @-@ ups is at the growth of helping businesses find out how their employees feel .
by creating and licens@@ ing software , which has the specific purpose of the measurement of employee engagement , they enable companies to conduct surveys , offer specific groups and demo@@ graphic groups , provide employees anon@@ ym@@ ity and complaint hot@@ lines , and in some cases , wh@@ ist@@ le@@ blo@@ wers allow managers to b@@ ypass the C @-@ suite managers and turn directly to the Board of Directors .
&quot; you now have tools like Str@@ ava and Fit@@ bit for pursuing their health , but where is the Fit@@ bit for your company ? &quot; said Jim Bar@@ nett , co @-@ founder and Chief Executive of Red@@ wood City Start @-@ up G@@ lin@@ t , whose software analy@@ tics tools are used by companies to measure employee engagement .
Er@@ rett said she had a better insight into what your employees think and feel in the three years with G@@ lin@@ t .
in addition to Sn@@ ap surveys and surveys from certain teams , it provides a heat map of the company that shows at a glance which units have the most dis@@ comfort and which managers have low condition results - so you can rep@@ licate why .
companies come to see that at the top of the workplace culture must remain , so that you won &apos;t be the next U@@ ber involved in sc@@ and@@ als since a former employee has published a blog post that describes an environment of nu@@ is@@ ances in which those who have spoken , were pun@@ ished .
for start @-@ ups like G@@ lin@@ t , this wish is an overview of a lu@@ cr@@ ative business opportunity .
the global governance , regulation and compliance sector could have more than $ 1@@ 18.@@ 7 billion in 2020 , following the funding @-@ technical website of Let &apos;s Talk Pay@@ ments .
Den@@ ver , Colorado , start @-@ up Conver@@ cent , the company helps to prevent and recognize bad behavior , saw an increasing interest and activity in the middle of the U@@ ber @-@ F@@ alles in Mis@@ sk@@ re@@ dit .
Converter has almost 600 clients including Air@@ b@@ n@@ b , Microsoft and Tes@@ la .
U@@ ber has recently registered as a client .
as G@@ lin@@ t , conver@@ se companies can send customized &quot; pulse &quot; surveys , collect sensitive responses in real time and view the heat cards of your problem areas .
it also provides an anonymous SMS hot@@ line that allows employees to report bad behavior .
and if the main managing director is involved , complaints directly go to the super@@ visory board .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the court of public opinion has seized the regul@@ ators , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Patrick Qu@@ in@@ lan , the founder and managing director of Conver@@ cent . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when a company finds its employees badly treated or beha@@ ves in@@ ethical , it can experience expensive consequences due to consumer boy@@ cot@@ t , employee fluctu@@ ation and complaints , said Qu@@ in@@ lan .
Ruby Tuesday , the restaurant chain with more than 25,@@ 000 employees and more than 500 locations , has used Conver@@ cent for more than a year to ensure that employees are aware of policies and procedures and have an easy way to reach their corporate headquarters .
earlier , if an employee wanted to report a problem , he or she found a phone number or e @-@ mail for the corporate headquarters , submit a formal complaint and hope that he was taken seriously .
it was often a inti@@ mid@@ ation and un@@ comfortable experience , said James Vit@@ rano , Ruby TU@@ ES@@ DA@@ YS General Coun@@ sel who said there was no good opportunity to pursue the dis@@ comfort of employees .
now , as the company conver@@ ts conver@@ sely , problems hidden by executives who were sitting in offices in cities or states have been identified - such as discrimination , har@@ ass@@ ment or in@@ fair intern@@ ships .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can get closer to this holistic , 360 @-@ degree view into the experience with employment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Vit@@ rano , who heads the risk management group of Ruby Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and we protect our shareholders from employment disputes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
companies began to re@@ ap ethics , values and employee engagement in 2002 , after the accounting firm Arthur Ander@@ sen collap@@ sed for ethical violations due to the En@@ ron sc@@ andal , Qu@@ in@@ lan said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but it took until the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Social Media &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; came to their right &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that companies recognized that they could not prevent their dirty laundry online . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before using technology for monitoring ethics , people used hope as a strategy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
both G@@ lin@@ t and Conver@@ cent offer your software as a service , and burden the companies with recur@@ ring charges for the use of their products .
it is a business model and a chance to find the agreement between Venture Capital investors who have supported both start @-@ ups .
conver@@ sely $ 10 million received funding in February of companies such as Sap@@ phire Vent@@ ures and T@@ ola Capital , raising the total capital to $ 47 million .
gl@@ itz@@ ers secured $ 10 million in November by Bes@@ se@@ mer Venture Partners and earned his entire financing to $ 60 million .
these investments are hardly surprising , given the inter@@ connected nature of companies , culture and venture capital .
there is a growing complex of research that shows that today &apos;s employees expect more from their jobs than before .
in competitive markets such as Si@@ licon Valley , high sal@@ aries and interesting projects are just assign@@ ments .
employees want to feel that you are accepted and appreciated and that you give your time to a company with a positive mission .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if people are happy to be in a company that &apos;s worth their votes and that the work you do is worthwhile , then they feel more committed to making this company successful , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Nina Mc@@ Queen , Vice President of Global Ben@@ ef@@ its and Emplo@@ ye@@ e Experience in Link@@ ed@@ In , which uses both Conver@@ cent and G@@ lin@@ t . &quot; &quot; &quot;
investors reach Rend@@ ites when their portfolio companies run well . companies run well when employees are committed and committed .
if the analy@@ tics tools of third parties promise to increase commitment and commitment of employees , it is no wonder that you will find support .
the data on employee engagement according to the experts of the workplace culture is important .
but the data are useless if the car@@ et@@ aker of a company does not take action .
in fact , when a company asks employees after your feedback , it may have an expect@@ ation that change is on the way .
and if the change does not come fast enough or not at all , this can breed dis@@ appointments and motiv@@ ate employees .
&quot; if you ask for 4.000 suggestions , you need to be ready to have 4,000 talks , &quot; said Rus@@ sell Ra@@ ath , President of Consulting at the Business Management firm Kot@@ ter International , who has seen companies that have reli@@ ed on collecting data .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for if you do not follow staff , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Have you really heard me ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
do you care about it ?
and if you don &apos;t care about why should I ? &quot;
Ma@@ dison Re@@ ed , who now carries out monthly staff surveys , was able to implement measures on the same day if a problem is reported via G@@ lin@@ t , so Er@@ rett .
and after collecting feedback from fru@@ str@@ ated employees , it was able to re@@ organize several teams within the company and to add communication training to address the problems .
at Ruby Tuesday , the company gets new insights into the employees and hopes that in the long run , this leads to a better binding of employees in a sector that is known for high turnover .
&quot; if you are not oblig@@ ated to create a culture of transparency , you will lose people , &quot; Vit@@ rano said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and if you lose people , you also lose customers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and if you lose customers , then you will lose business .
the N@@ CA@@ A elimin@@ ates the two @-@ day practices and makes a long day for fry
it starts at 23 : 00 when a lot of U@@ C@@ LA foot@@ ball@@ ers conver@@ ge on one side of the new training fields of the team on campus .
some have moved out their fun@@ eral parts and show the back full of sweat from the first day of the training camp .
a lunch break is a good part of the team for a good part of the team .
players who are en@@ rolled in the summer courses will return to their final examinations after the three @-@ hour exercise before they return at 6 : 30 at the Water@@ man Football Center next morning .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is for the guys the next three days a real treadmill , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bru@@ ins @-@ Trainer Jim Mor@@ a shortly before the Monday was Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the N@@ CA@@ A elimin@@ ates two @-@ day exercises to facilitate the load of the players , and it has actually extended their days - at least until the final on Friday .
therefore , the first three trainings of the U@@ C@@ LA should start at 7 : 15 p.m. to meet the already fully packed schedule of the players .
the compromise reached from the two days is more than a day when the Bru@@ ins moved to the beginning of the camp almost a week after the last season and during the summer school for the first time during Mor@@ as six playing times in West@@ wood practic@@ ed practical exercises .
they are supposed to hold 18 exercises over the course of August . 20 before starting the formal arrangements for their pre@@ lu@@ de against Texas A &amp; M in September .
Mor@@ a said he supports the change of rules of the N@@ CA@@ A , even if they add another point to the multi@@ part routes of the players .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we put this enormous strain on them three or four days and it is very challenging , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mor@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and they simply pushed it , they plac@@ ken further , they are great people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think once we come to Saturday and we have more time , it will be really great . &quot;
the U@@ C@@ LA will end its practices once the camp is finished , which in view of the clear lines of its fields from an adjacent car park and the adjacent Lus@@ kin Center , a hotel of the up@@ scale class , which has already been thrown with foot@@ balls , which is already clearing a protective net behind a pe@@ at post , will be no easy task .
Bru@@ ins players should occupy the hotel from this weekend but Mor@@ a admitted that there could be a problem as soon as these rooms are free during the season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will use our security , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mor@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a real problem , and it is not far fet@@ ched to think that people can rent a room there and then stop there to record an exercise . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you have the video tape of one exercise , it &apos;s a pretty good deal .
but we have security forces there and we have security forces on parking 8 .
we will do the best with what we have .
I don &apos;t worry too much about this .
we have a plan . &quot;
Facebook wants to intensi@@ fy facts verification in the fight against counter@@ f@@ eit news
Facebook wants to send more potential items with bug reports to third parties and show their results below the original article , the world &apos;s largest online social network on Thursday . it is one of its efforts to fight so @-@ called f@@ ake news .
the company said in an opinion on its website that it will begin with the use of updated machine learning methods to detect possible false reports and to send them to fac@@ tual inspec@@ tors who may display results of the fact examination from the original article .
Facebook has been critic@@ ised as one of the main distribution points for so @-@ called f@@ ake news , many of whom believe that they also influenced the US presidential election 2016 .
the problem has become a major political issue in Europe , with French vot@@ ers floo@@ ded in May with false stories , and Germany supports a plan to pun@@ ish social media networks if they fail to quickly eliminate hate @-@ filled post@@ ings as before the elections there in September .
on Thursday , Facebook said in a separate statement in German that in the USA , France , the Netherlands and Germany , a test of the new facts review will be launched .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to the realization of the stories of fac@@ tual aud@@ itors of third parties , people want more context to make informed decisions about what they read and share , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Sara Su , product manager for Facebook news in a blog . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she added that Facebook will continue to test his feature to the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; related article &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and work on other changes to his news feed to reduce false news . &quot; &quot; &quot;
creating a novel &apos;s novel : a castle in the history of England
in his younger past , the little Scot@@ ney Castle was seen in a sque@@ eze music video and was a lo@@ op@@ hole for Margar@@ et Th@@ at@@ cher in the 1970 @-@ he and 1980 @-@ he years .
but Scot@@ ney has experienced 700 years of turbul@@ ent history from its cozy sitting in the Con@@ sci@@ ous River Valley in K@@ ent and is now an inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rho@@ des , a mop@@ ha@@ ired Yor@@ k@@ shi@@ re@@ man with a preference for historical documents .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I find it so beautiful to look at the hand@@ writing of someone who has been dead for 300 years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says we@@ ary . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what a personal relationship to keep this letter in my hand . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&apos;@@ A Castle in England &apos; spann@@ ed the period from the Middle Ages to the age of Edward and documents the families living in Scot@@ ney . each story was illustrated by another British artist - Isaac Ste@@ ie@@ wicz , Bri@@ ony May Smith , William Ex@@ ley , Beck@@ y Pal@@ mer and Isabel Gre@@ enberg .
it is not the first book of Rho@@ des based on an archive : he wrote in 2014 &apos; Dead Men &apos;s Te@@ eth and Other Stories &apos; , a collection inspired by documents in the British Library - a project that he found un@@ expect@@ edly emotional .
&quot; I only re@@ acted to the thum@@ b print on the page of a letter that was written by a double agent in the 1700 &apos;s , who worked for the Jacob@@ ins , &quot; he says .
&quot; this is his thum@@ b print !
and letters always sm@@ elled smoke , because at that time a fire was kind@@ led because of the light .
for someone who lives 300 years later , the smell has an effect , as if he himself would .
&quot; &quot; &quot; ah , I love Archive ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for someone who is so sm@@ itten with old papers that he is supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council England and lived almost four months in a castle ( &quot; To be honest : I have reviewed my welcome greeting &quot; ) seems to be all too beautiful to be true .
Rho@@ des spent his days exploring the Vict@@ orian &quot; new &quot; castle , to study the archives and study the many treasures and curios@@ ities of the castle , such as the mounted hy@@ ri@@ bs on the walls and bottles that had spent centuries in the dit@@ ch .
he wander@@ ed through the grounds and the ruins of the old castle and spoke to the artists , gar@@ den@@ ers and sometimes with the artists working on the illustrations of his book .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then , at night he d@@ rank &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Whis@@ key and started writing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the intimate history of Scot@@ ney is relatively unknown , since the National Trust first received full access in 2006 , when the last hei@@ r , Elizabeth Hus@@ sey , died .
when Rho@@ des had arrived a decade later , the employees just started taking care of the archive , which he described as &quot; hundreds of years , in which Arist@@ oc@@ rates said , &quot; Oh , throw it on the at@@ tic . &quot;
di@@ aries , letters from the period of English Emp@@ ires , cards that show who what was owned : &quot; you could think that land conflicts would be boring , &quot; says Rho@@ des , &quot; but there was a bir@@ ch to fight the two families .
guys , let &apos;s go through it ! &quot;
some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point for a broader base into English history , including &apos; The Lab@@ our@@ er &apos; , which follows a man who leaves the newly built castle to join the farmer rebel@@ lion of 13@@ 81 .
&quot; there is a record of a rebel@@ lion who stood in the castle in 13@@ 80 , in this book entitled &apos; K@@ nigh@@ tly Famili@@ es of K@@ ent and Sus@@ sex &apos; , &quot; says Rho@@ des .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the farmer rebel@@ lion began in this area and I thought an insurrection was a good start . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; maybe the two are connected to each other ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
other stories are firmly rooted in the history of the castle - like &apos; The Pri@@ est &apos; , which tells the story of the Jesu@@ it pat@@ rons which the Dar@@ rell family hid for seven years during the English Reformation .
or &apos; The Sm@@ ug@@ gler &apos; , in which the sm@@ ug@@ gler Arthur Dar@@ rell was portr@@ ayed out of the 18th century , filled his own fun@@ eral by filling a coff@@ in with stones ( a discovery which was first made years later when his coff@@ in was excav@@ ated ) .
the Dar@@ rell@@ s are Rho@@ des &apos;s favourite family of Scot@@ ney : &quot; the gentle@@ men seemed to be a G@@ aun@@ er , always making debt and spending money for things they couldn &apos;t afford .
&quot; &quot; &quot; other generations of Dar@@ rell men rede@@ emed their debt crises by mar@@ rying rich old women - I imagine them as a bunch of well @-@ looking guys , with a talent to advertise . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the end of his use in the castle Rho@@ des is searching for other unique write experiences
he has taken a two @-@ week stay in the Finnish wilderness for a com@@ ic novel about El@@ äm@@ än@@ mä@@ ki , the territory of a san@@ atorium from the early 20th century , which has since been re@@ claimed by nature .
but Scot@@ ney has a special place for him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was sorry to go back , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was like : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ah , now I have to deal with the dam@@ ned life again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
campaign launched : over 300 years old Mari@@ enkap@@ elle in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf
with the casing of the 301 year old Mari@@ enkap@@ elle in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf , the city of Bad Honne@@ f has launched its campaign to introduce a new umbrella brand ( Rund@@ schau of Thursday ) .
Mayor Otto Neu@@ hoff and his marketing team around Nelson Mand@@ z want to keep the logo and the slogan in secret until Thursday .
at the end of August , it is said to be a highlight of the campaign on the island of Gra@@ fen@@ wer@@ th .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; too beautiful for us . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; or ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ask the makers of the action since yesterday on the posters at the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rh@@ ön@@ dorfer chapel &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t really think this ( of course ! ) not really , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they write on their last webpage . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; but we use this measure to attract your attention .
and to make clear that some is better than it seems .
basically , we believe that we as Bad Honne@@ fer citizens know the beauty and attr@@ activ@@ eness of our city very well . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the action is more than &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; just a logo and a slogan &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is necessary to form@@ ulate an all@@ stand@@ ingly promise , one that gives the city an un@@ mistak@@ able unique feature . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after all , they stand in competition with other municipalities .
an average five @-@ digit amount can be paid by the City of Bad Honne@@ f its new umbrella brand and the campaign cost .
military reforms in Turkey - Erdo@@ gan &apos;s afraid of the army
every year at the beginning of August in Ankara the Supreme Military Council ( Y@@ as ) advis@@ es on reti@@ rements and promotions in the officer cor@@ ps .
so also this week .
at first sight a normal process .
but nothing is routine for the Turkish armed forces one year after the attempt of the coup attempt .
the meeting was no longer held in the General Staff &apos;s building , as before , but in the presi@@ dency of the Prime Minister .
at the meetings of the head of the government , the five Vice @-@ Govern@@ ors and the Ministers of Defence , Home Affairs , Justice and Foreign Affairs took part in the consult@@ ations .
thus the civilians in the Y@@ as were in abundance .
the government moves the re@@ ins in the military .
the Chief of Staff , Hul@@ usi ak@@ ar , remains in office , but the commander of the army , the air forces and the Navy have been dism@@ is@@ sed .
since the failed coup , state head Erdo@@ gan has fired 169 of the 326 gener@@ als and admir@@ als .
over 10,000 soldiers were removed from the ranks of the army - mostly because of alleged connections to the movement of the Ex@@ ile pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , who sees Erdo@@ gan as wire @-@ pulling of the coup attempt .
against 486 people who are directly involved in the attempted coup attempt in Ankara , this week has been negoti@@ ated in Ankara .
&quot; &quot; &quot; already on the day after the coup , Erdo@@ gan had called the overthrow attempt as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; God &apos;s gift &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as he gives him the opportunity to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; clean &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the armed forces . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but does Erdo@@ gan really have the army under control ?
at the end of February , the newspaper &quot; Hür@@ ri@@ yet &quot; published an article with the heading &quot; Un@@ comfort in the military headquarters . &quot;
in the general staff there were concerns due to an increasing &quot; Islam@@ isation &quot; of the army , which , among other things , manifest@@ ing itself in the abol@@ ition of the ban on women , wrote the newspaper .
in any case , the large @-@ scale coach in the army and the security forces continues .
in mid @-@ July , Erdo@@ gan fired up further 7@@ 395 sovereign operators , among them 23@@ 03 polic@@ emen and 546 soldiers .
it seemed that Erdo@@ gan en@@ um@@ er@@ ated the military .
the gener@@ als were formerly regarded as the actual lords of the country .
three times later , they appe@@ aled their role as gu@@ ardi@@ ans of the world@@ ly state order .
after his election victory in 2002 , Erdo@@ gan ur@@ ged the power of the military to take step by step , not least on appeal to the reform proposals of the European Union .
former officers say Erdo@@ gan drives targeted a Islam@@ ization of the armed forces .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the magazine &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Voc@@ al Europe &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a particular non @-@ so @-@ called officer who sought asylum after the coup attempt from persecution abroad , the Turkish army will be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; full of extrem@@ ists and Sal@@ af@@ ists &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a few years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if this is true , such a development could not leave the N@@ ato cold .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; anyway , there is doubt in the alliance after cleansing doubts about the read@@ iness of the Turkish army . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the leadership structures and operational skills are &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; weak@@ ened &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; say N@@ ato diplom@@ ats . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Washington changes green card rules
there will be a new US immigration plan to change the rules of Green Card , said President Donald Tr@@ ump , c@@ ited from the media .
it seems to lower the legal immigrants to 50,000 per year , stric@@ ter rules for obtaining vis@@ as for a temporary work permit and restrictions on family @-@ oriented vis@@ as .
the new rules are proposed by the Re@@ public@@ ans and supported by the President .
the draft law shall be discussed in the two chambers of Congress .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this law will reduce poverty , increase wages and save billions of dollars for tax@@ pay@@ ers , and will do so by changing the way citizens from other countries are dealt Green Cards . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the law will prevent the chains migration and replace the current system .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this new application procedure will benefit candidates who have the financial means to support themselves and show knowledge that will benefit our economy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tr@@ ump , quoted by the American media . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ministry is going to rehabil@@ itate route for race @-@ level shuttle
again and again in the past few months over the future of the race sh@@ utt@@ les had been fought - now it should be quite fast .
before the end of the year , it is supposed to be built on the most important route on which the tourist track runs .
in order to secure the future of the race sh@@ utt@@ les in the long run , according to the Ministry of Transport , construction work will begin on the track this year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the decision to further order and renov@@ ate the route Il@@ men@@ au @-@ Renn@@ stei@@ g , the country is familiar with this particularly important for tourism , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Minister of Culture , Klaus S@@ üh@@ l on Friday in Erfurt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the costs for the repair of the distance declined to about 2.5 million euros .
of this sum , the country ski@@ ps 75 percent .
the contract , on which the shuttle is to be ordered also in the future from the country , will at present be defin@@ iti@@ vely coordinated , declared S@@ üh@@ l .
the Ministry and the Southern Thurin@@ gian rail@@ ways as operators are already in agreement with the technical details .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with this , the road@@ map , the vehicles used and the quality standards are negoti@@ ated , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said S@@ üh@@ l . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the planned contract between the ministry and the railway company will be closed for a period of eleven years .
thus the race @-@ stei@@ g @-@ Shuttle will be ordered at the end of December 2017 .
the Renn@@ stei@@ g @-@ Shuttle is a railway link between the underground stations Il@@ men@@ au and Renn@@ stei@@ g , especially with tourists .
over the past few months , in the course of a pilot operation , it has been tested whether the route is used by a lot of people to order them regularly in the future .
the track is also very b@@ ump@@ y in parts .
the rise of sex robots is real and we should be worried
just as you thought it can not become more crazy in 2017 , a new report on technological developments in the field of sex robot is coming .
yes , in fact .
sex robots are currently a great thing .
recently , the Foundation for Respon@@ sible Robotics ( FR@@ R ) published a report on the development of sex robots in the next five to ten years .
according to No@@ el Shar@@ key , Emer@@ itus Professor of Robotics and Arti@@ ficial Intelligence at the University of She@@ ff@@ ield and Co @-@ Fo@@ under of the FR@@ R , we have to start taking their rise seriously .
customers can choose the eye color of the robot , its shape of the ni@@ pp@@ le and the type of f@@ ing@@ ern@@ ail .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people make fun of them , but the companies deliver a lot of it , and we will see them much more often , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr. Shar@@ key in the release of his new report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
modern sex@@ es have developed from their infl@@ atable partners to robots with a silicone skin that feels warm - with conscious human reactions which are achieved through artificial intelligence .
the user can also adjust his robot according to his beliefs &quot; and select everything from the eye color of the robot on the form of ni@@ p@@ ples to the type or colour of his f@@ ing@@ ern@@ ails .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but it becomes even more distur@@ bing as many robots have the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; personalities &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which would let a st@@ ep@@ ford woman look progressive . &quot; &quot; &quot;
modern sex@@ es have developed into robots with a silicone skin .
the Real@@ Bot@@ ix robot enables for example its users to adapt their robots to the properties they are appealing like , for example , sh@@ red@@ ness .
and then there are the Ro@@ xx@@ xy Gold Sex @-@ robots developed by True Compan@@ ion with pre @-@ programmed personalities such as Fri@@ gi@@ d Far@@ rah , &quot; which convey@@ s the impression of sh@@ y@@ ness and &quot; Wild W@@ endy &quot; with an &quot; advent@@ u@@ rous &quot; personality .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ro@@ xx@@ xy Gold has a personality adapted to your personality as good as possible , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; war@@ ms the site of True Compan@@ ion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so she likes what you like , and she doesn &apos;t like what you don &apos;t like , etc .
in the course of the day she also has her m@@ oods - just like real people !
&quot; &quot; &quot; she can be tired of being fixed on conversation or she can &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; be in mood &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are many distur@@ bing aspects of this rise of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the sub@@ mis@@ sive female features , the An@@ no@@ un@@ cements on rape , when one goes a step towards Fri@@ gi@@ d ( i.e. : resi@@ sting ) Far@@ rah , distur@@ bing one most .
on his website True Compan@@ ion Ro@@ xx@@ xy is compatible with a vibr@@ ator , but for men .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if women ( sic ) can have a vibr@@ ator , why can men then have no Ro@@ xx@@ xy ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it says on the website . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , these sex robots are not just a fet@@ ish or just another sex toys .
their formation and increasing refin@@ ement indicate a somewhat dar@@ ker and lowering in our culture , on a retreat from the ideal of gender equality towards a desire for sex with sub@@ jug@@ ation as an optional enc@@ ore .
most men will of course hold no sex robots , while the FR@@ R notes their rising popularity nonetheless , they remain pro@@ vision@@ ally on the br@@ ink of consumer culture .
but what perme@@ ates from the boundary zones can be very instruc@@ tive regarding the spirit of time in which we live .
and many people are not stran@@ gely or ins@@ ul@@ ting until the free market gives them permission .
there is a certain over@@ lap that these highly developed sex robots are emerging in a time when the rights of women are threatened worldwide in which there is a president in the White House , who pra@@ ys to have women sex@@ ually attacked .
the most det@@ err@@ ent aspect of the TV series &apos; The Hand@@ maid &apos;s T@@ ale &apos; ( &apos; The report of the maid &apos; ) are not the graphical images , the intri@@ cate body and the out@@ cast eyes , but how realistic this vision works .
the Republic of Gilead is a leap , but at the moment it does not feel like a big leap .
the goal behind these sex robots is to make a physical simil@@ arity to actual women as realistic as technically possible ( although with por@@ no@@ star proportions ) .
their builders want them to feel human that they im@@ itate the movement of a real body .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but , when it comes to their &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; person@@ ages &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the robots are no real women . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they cannot separate from their companion or simply go away .
they have no medi@@ ation or background history , nothing that hin@@ ders independence or anything that could inter@@ fere with the fant@@ asi@@ es of total submission .
in other words , they are f@@ ake slaves .
or to express it in the Rede@@ mption of 2017 : M@@ aid
pumps great power ?
he makes Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney the ep@@ it@@ ome of common sense .
it has become a bond@@ age of the Tr@@ ump era that the political divisions , pol@@ arized the U.S. constitu@@ ency , have also split families in small format .
around Christmas and Th@@ ank@@ s@@ giving , there were newspapers in the U.S. with advice on how to deal with the hor@@ ror of Tr@@ ump @-@ choosing relatives .
we all think that we are all supp@@ os@@ edly to burst our filter bub@@ bles .
less noticed is the power of g@@ umps together to bring families together .
I mention this because my c@@ ousin , a left @-@ directed poet , who lives in Chicago and has long been busy with the re@@ public@@ ans in our family , visited me this week in New York .
it reminded me that unity against a common enemy can have a powerful effect .
with Tr@@ ump in the White House , everyone , whom she knows , including the re@@ publi@@ can relationship , with which she fought for decades because of politics , suddenly and suddenly at the same side .
for the dining table this is certainly a good thing , but it is in a wider context that this also ent@@ ails considerable risks .
the left was strengthened by the ump but the dep@@ uty effect of his presi@@ dency has the power to push us all to the right .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if we speak of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; norm@@ alisation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; b@@ ump &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; we refer to the sp@@ ook@@ y possibility that his k@@ itt@@ ens will no longer meet us . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , there is a long @-@ term scenario , norm@@ alized in the Tr@@ ump Re@@ public@@ ans of the right wing , &quot; which suddenly appear as the ep@@ it@@ ome of reason@@ abl@@ eness when compared with its standards .
I find myself today from an active no@@ stal@@ gia for Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney &apos;s ur@@ ian version of the crazy - the dog on the car roof , the 14 % income tax ( but at least we knew how to see his tax return ) - both in comparison to Tr@@ ump in fact appear to be a very mild criminal off@@ ence .
when Tr@@ ump is going , the next Re@@ public@@ ans will only be mentally healthy to qualify as imm@@ eas@@ urable improvement .
when my c@@ ousin was in the city , we brought our children to the car@@ ou@@ sel in Central Park , the largest of the New York &apos;s car@@ ou@@ sel &apos;s car@@ ou@@ sel , and the best three dollars you can spend in the city if you don &apos;t need any caff@@ eine .
the horses are enorm@@ ously big , the fi@@ ber@@ glass designs on the central cylinder - all c@@ low@@ ns are kn@@ ur@@ led and the animals are twi@@ sted to look at full fear of their own shoulders - extremely dark and the cyc@@ lical music convey@@ s this in a strange way .
so many c@@ lich@@ és of a city dis@@ ap@@ point : the views of tall buildings are old , the sky@@ lines are too familiar to offer much excitement , and the reality of the city will not meet the dream .
thirty @-@ five years later , and I am still not across the day when I discovered that Swiss Cottage is indeed not a Swiss cottage - the Top@@ ic Pub Y@@ e Ol@@ de Swiss Cottage is not one - but a big round@@ about in the north of London .
the Central Park @-@ car@@ ou@@ sel is still a strange magic experience , since here two two @-@ year @-@ old , a 11 @-@ year @-@ old and two women in the 40 @-@ ies can go on it and all have a great time .
if I could have rated the car@@ ou@@ sel , I would have given him the full score , but luck@@ ily nobody asked him .
on the other hand , I was forced into a department store this week to evaluate my &quot; experience &quot; with transactions on a scale of one to five stars before I could pass through my credit card .
in the coffee house at the corner of my street it &apos;s the same , plus the option to match the rating with a 15 % tip - this in order to buy something about the counter .
this not only leads to a slow@@ down of what is supposed to be a neutral exchange , but also exer@@ ts pressure on the server to bring personality into a situation in which no need is needed .
the poor woman in the department store was ap@@ ologi@@ zing gr@@ ins@@ ing while I was tired of making my credit card with five stars .
Oscar Pist@@ ori@@ us transferred to hospital with chest pain
for the second time , Pist@@ ori@@ us left the prison for a visit to a hospital .
last year , he was brought to the hospital for the treatment of cuts at his hand joints , according to the prison authorities , according to a case in his cell .
Pist@@ ori@@ us was sentenced to a first death sentence due to murder following an appeal against prosec@@ ut@@ ors .
he killed Ste@@ enk@@ amp in the early hours of Valent@@ ine &apos;s Day 2013 by shooting them several times through a door of the toil@@ et@@ ries in his house in Pre@@ toria .
Pist@@ ori@@ us claimed that he held his girl@@ friend for a nigh@@ tly in@@ tru@@ der who hid himself in the cabin .
the prosec@@ ut@@ ors have announced their intention to appeal against the six @-@ year prison sentence of Pist@@ ori@@ us App@@ ell , of which they say they are too si@@ ghted .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the national prosec@@ ution authority said that it was lod@@ ged by the Supreme Court of South Africa , and the obj@@ ection could be heard this year . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pist@@ ori@@ us runs risk that his sentence will be increased to 15 years if the prosec@@ ut@@ ors are successful .
there is no capital punishment in South Africa .
as farmer Arnold finds a strange egg
as the last of the Blum@@ berger schools , the Vier@@ t@@ kl@@ äss@@ ler from F@@ ats and E@@ pf@@ en@@ hofen were released into the holidays and the secondary schools .
three of the class@@ mates go to secondary school in the future , four to the secondary school .
on Tuesday evening , Angel@@ ika S@@ itte welcomed the parents and representatives of the public at the Bürger@@ haus Bi@@ es@@ ental in E@@ pf@@ en@@ hofen .
as a symbol of school leaving , the 29 students of the four classes elected by Sophia Schumacher and Reg@@ ine Me@@ der a young eag@@ le growing in the chicken farm , but then released into freedom .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , the lower band introduced a musical with the title &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Eagle in the Ch@@ icken Farm . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
farmer Arnold found a strange egg , and let it ro@@ ar off his ch@@ ick@@ ens .
instead of a chicken bin , a small eag@@ le came out .
but the hope of making a hen out of him sh@@ attered , the eag@@ le spread forth his wings on a high mountain and disappeared .
after that the classes showed three and four in the entry of Y@@ von@@ ne Frank a chicken dance .
the h@@ ens d@@ anced with the young Go@@ ck@@ les who bore the cylinders to the bet .
the eag@@ le stands for integration , said School Director Angel@@ ika S@@ itte .
the young is different from the other k@@ itt@@ ens ( ch@@ icks ) , but belong to that .
but he will never be like a chicken .
his appointment is to be free .
she wished each four @-@ t@@ aster that he feels accepted in his new school .
thanks to the colleagues , the former school manager Michael Müller , who repeatedly j@@ umps to Unter@@ richt@@ sen@@ g@@ p@@ äs@@ sen , and the parent representatives .
the Kü@@ ken@@ zeit was over now , declared class teacher Sophia Schumacher .
they leave their students for two years of teaching only very odd , as it was a really great time .
finally , they can rely on the Vier@@ t@@ kl@@ äss@@ ler .
at the end , all students left a song of summer time and holiday time .
with the children a great joy broke out .
eight first @-@ gra@@ ders have already registered for the new school year .
two Bulg@@ arians arrested for illegal camping in Greece
two Bulg@@ arians were im@@ pris@@ oned for illegal camps in Greece , the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , quoted from television , shared .
in the morning of August 1 , in Si@@ th@@ onia , the police arrested a group of illegal people , including the two Bulg@@ arians .
on the same day they were released , while an investigation is underway .
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs told B@@ TV that Bulg@@ arians were released later .
the Greek authorities have ti@@ ghtened the control of the free Camp@@ en and place anyone who is found to stay in a place that is not intended for this purpose , significant monetary fin@@ es .
the inspec@@ tions will continue throughout the season .
the ministry said that the court can impose a fine fine .
software update for diesel vehicles : what people need to know now
how exactly does the software update take place ?
do diesel drivers need to participate in the action ?
the most important questions and answers at a glance .
at the Diesel Summit , BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW group have offered software updates for a total of around 5.3 million cars .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are to improve the emission performance of car emissions from Euro 5 and partly Euro 6 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Euro @-@ 4 diesel or worse are excluded .
Anja S@@ met@@ an@@ in from ACE Auto Club Europe gives ratings :
is the new promotion compulsory ?
no , the software updates are optional .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the oblig@@ atory updates previously only apply to the vehicles that have the Schum@@ an software , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Anja S@@ met@@ an@@ in . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the retro@@ fitting has ordered the Kraft@@ fahrt @-@ Bundes@@ amt ( KBA ) .
how and when will customers be informed of updates ?
the manufacturers have announced a rapid implementation in the next few months , but still no exact date .
Daimler has communicated to every person concerned .
when an inspection is due anyway , it will be done within its framework .
how long should the retro@@ fits be drawn altogether ?
&quot; hard to say , &quot; says S@@ met@@ an@@ in .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the app@@ rais@@ al of the commitment of the manufacturers as well as political pressure . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because we have seen , voluntary workers do not act voluntarily on the subject of the environment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how long should the update last ?
the retro@@ fitting itself could take only three to four hours in the workshop .
time @-@ consuming could be to get an appointment .
what are drivers that do not drive cars from BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW group ?
the ACE advis@@ es for waiting .
presum@@ ably foreign manufacturers would follow , so S@@ met@@ an@@ in .
is there a massive drop in price of Euro @-@ 4 cars ?
the ACE fears that .
but just in the regions where driving b@@ ans thre@@ aten .
in rural areas there is now no loss of value for older dies@@ els .

ll Cool J Recei@@ ves Kennedy Center Award
the Kennedy Award Gala is one of the most glam@@ orous events in Washington .
the first prize @-@ giving under President Tr@@ ump promises to become political .
one of the winners does not want to come - from protest .
ll Cool J ( 49 ) receives one of the cov@@ eted awards from the renowned Kennedy Center as the first rap@@ per .
as the cultural setting announced on Thursday , this year also singer Gl@@ oria E@@ ste@@ fan ( 59 ) , Li@@ onel Rich@@ ie ( 68 ) and the chore@@ o@@ grapher Carmen de Lav@@ all@@ ade ( 86 ) and the TV producer Norman Le@@ ar ( 95 ) are among the scholars .
prizes will be handed over in the beginning of December .
traditionally , U.S. President Donald Tr@@ ump will hold a reception and join with his wife Mel@@ ania at the awar@@ ding ceremony .
the award winner Le@@ ar announced that the award winner Le@@ ar announced the participation in the gal@@ a .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; New York Times &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this presi@@ dency has decided to completely negle@@ ct the arts and human rights - even depri@@ ve them of the means - and it bur@@ dens me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 59 @-@ year @-@ old E@@ ste@@ fan stressed that she will use the conversation with Tr@@ ump to clear her view .
the Kennedy Center named after former President John F. Kennedy is the largest cultural institution in the U.S. capital .
among the former award winners are Mer@@ yl Stre@@ ep , Are@@ tha Fran@@ klin , Robert De N@@ iro , George Lucas , Tom H@@ anks and St@@ ing .
we make the city li@@ vable
Roland W@@ acker , Has@@ l@@ ach@@ s Stadt@@ bau@@ meister , continues in R@@ ente next year .
the place has already been written - however suitable candidates are rare .
W@@ acker Stadt@@ bau@@ meister has been a city engineer for 31 years .
and the work still makes him great fun as he convey@@ s in the press talk .
he reports on varied but also challenging tasks that are waiting for his successor .
at the same time , he mar@@ v@@ elled that no application has been submitted to the requirements profile so far .
at the next stage , the city seeks an architect or a civil engineer .
in compliance with the regular periods of notice , there is still enough time for a revision .
since Has@@ lach functions for the administrative community as a sub@@ contractor , the applic@@ ant must assign corresponding degrees .
for this function wants to keep the city in any case .
if they could no longer fill them , the citizens would have to go to Off@@ enburg until Off@@ enburg .
but the clos@@ eness to the city and the city itself is important , says W@@ acker , who reports from a good working atmosphere and good mood between the authorities and the citizens .
in more than 30 years of office , some important projects have been gathered , looking back to the W@@ acker with pride .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we make the city li@@ fel@@ ong , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is sure about the building office and its employees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but also in the future there are varied projects on the agenda : the transformation of the former Hu@@ kl@@ a @-@ Are@@ as and the Nieder@@ ho@@ fen@@ park@@ platz , for example , are encountered .
the Kin@@ zig@@ brücke between B@@ oll@@ en@@ bach and Stein@@ ach will be renewed , even the mainst@@ ream production is still a topic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; only the latter will be@@ ech about 1.5 million Euros to be@@ ech , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we do it right , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says W@@ acker . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; all in all great tasks are waiting for my successor .
the work here is fun . &quot;
designed for a Stadt@@ bau@@ meister large game room .
Has@@ lach &apos;s private farm and gar@@ dener can react flexibly to many .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can move a lot , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said W@@ acker , and the design of the green spaces is often praised by citizens and visitors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the old town stands as an ensemble under monument protection , it is important to &quot; have an eye on what fits , &quot; if new buildings are approved , the se@@ cular city builder emphas@@ ises .
the Stadt@@ bau@@ meister contributes high responsibility anyway .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he is a builder , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the end everything is going on over my table . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
with care and coordination he can count on many years of staff : Markus Neum@@ ai@@ er ( Hoch@@ bau ) has been with Manfred Schön@@ er ( deep @-@ construction ) for the past 15 years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; also , that his successor stays long , W@@ acker wishes himself : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are looking for someone who really wants to identify and remain with the job . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
continuity is not only important for a good working environment , but also for the further design of the city .
anyone who wishes to inher@@ it Roland W@@ acker should be able to inform the city of Has@@ lach as a graduate engineer or a bach@@ el@@ or with subject area architecture and have good knowledge in the areas of construction and construction law .
the Municipal Building Office under@@ lies high@@ - and civil engineering , construction management , gr@@ under@@ age affairs , administration of urban property , urban depo@@ t with building yard and urban gar@@ dener as well as the Lower Building Law Authority including monument protection .
bike thrown on lines : southern railway track locked
according to the police , the previously unknown offen@@ ders had thrown the blue bicycle from the railway track crossing in the area of the Le@@ ob@@ ener Straße ( B@@ 116 ) onto the lines .
these were so severely damaged that the approaching freight train had to be stopped .
the investig@@ ators go out of two male offen@@ ders and have been searching for them for the night .
near the crime scenes , a ros@@ ary sco@@ oter and a bike rider were observed by witnesses .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this goes far beyond a margin &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Ö@@ BB @-@ Spe@@ aker Christoph Pos@@ ch to AP@@ A . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he or the perpet@@ rators would have brought themselves into great danger and also je@@ op@@ ardi@@ zed the train traffic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition to the damage to the locom@@ otive and the plant , as well as the delay and the costs for rail transportation , there could also be pat@@ rons of the rail@@ ways to the perpet@@ rators .
&quot; &quot; &quot; all in all , a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; substantial &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sum is said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the spokes@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the damage was repaired on Friday afternoon , the railway traffic on the southern railway route could be led without disabilities .
nearly ten persons were free Friday morning , two of them were concerned with long distance traffic .
freight trains were not out , but they had delays .
according to Ö@@ BB @-@ speaker Christoph Pos@@ ch had to be replaced around 200 metres of overhead lines .
ins@@ ulators and ma@@ sts were also damaged .
red meat , dairy products and chocolate could help alle@@ vi@@ ate IB@@ D ( inflammatory bo@@ wel disease )
red meat and chocolate can sound like a night@@ mare for your digest@@ ive system .
but a new study claims exactly the opposite : a diet rich in meat @-@ based proteins and dairy products could alle@@ vi@@ ate symptoms of patients with inflammatory bo@@ wel disease .
the incur@@ able condition that affects approximately 1.3 million and 300@@ ,000 in the United States causes stomach cr@@ amps and flat@@ ul@@ ences , recur@@ ring or bloody confusion , weight loss and extreme fatigue .
while the suffer@@ ers are usually advised to avoid flesh and dairy products to alle@@ vi@@ ate their symptoms , researchers found at the Wash@@ ing@@ ton@@ er University that the essential amino acid tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han helps to develop immune cells that promote a toler@@ ant gut .
the leading researcher , Dr. Marco Col@@ onna , stated that immune cells in the intest@@ ines pat@@ rol to ensure that harmful micro@@ bes that hide in food do not penet@@ rate into the body .
cells that are capable of trig@@ gering inflammation , are balanced by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without dam@@ aging sensitive tissues .
if the balance tends to be too far in the direction of inflammation , it can result in an inflammatory bo@@ wel disease .
experiments have been found that a kind of tolerance promoting immune cell occurs in mice that carry a certain bacter@@ ium in their intest@@ ines .
and the bacter@@ ium requires tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han - one of the building blocks of proteins - to dis@@ solve the appearance of the cells .
Professor Col@@ onna said : &quot; we have established a connection between a bacterial Lac@@ tobac@@ ill@@ us reu@@ ter@@ i - which is a normal part of the gut micro@@ bi@@ ome , and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance .
the more tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han the mice had in their food , the more they had from these immune cells . &quot;
it suggested that the combination of L. reu@@ ter@@ i and a nutrition rich in tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han encourages more toler@@ ant , less inflammatory intestinal mi@@ lie@@ us if the same system ac@@ qui@@ res people .
post @-@ doctoral research Dr. Lu@@ isa Cer@@ v@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ rag@@ an examined a kind of immune cell that promotes tolerance , when she found out that a group of study mice had such cells , but another group of the same tribe , which was separately housed , did not .
they suspected that the difference had to do with intestinal micro@@ bi@@ al symptoms - the community of bacteria , viruses and fung@@ i that normally live in the gast@@ ro@@ intestinal tract .
the intest@@ ines of the mice were DNA @-@ sequ@@ enced and six bacterial species were found , which were present in mice with the immune cells , but without them missing in mice .
mice were raised in a ster@@ ile environment so that they lack@@ ed intestinal micro@@ bi@@ ome and they did not develop these kinds of immune cells , and they got the L. reu@@ ter@@ i and the immune cells .
in order to understand how bacteria re@@ acted to the immune system , the researchers left L. reu@@ ter@@ i in a liquid and then transferred small amounts of fluid - without the bacteria - to imm@@ atur@@ ated immune cells isolated from mice .
the immune cells developed into the toler@@ ant cells .
when the active component was pur@@ ified from the liquid , it proved to be a by @-@ product of tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han metabolism , known as an In@@ dol @-@ 3 lac@@ tic acid .
when the researchers doubled the amount of tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han in the lining of mice , the number of such cells increased by approximately 50 percent , but when the tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han values were hal@@ ved , the number of cells decreased by half .
Dr. Cer@@ v@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ rag@@ an stated that people have the same toler@@ ant cells as mice and that most of us L. reu@@ ter@@ i in our gast@@ ro@@ intestinal tract .
it is not known whether Tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han @-@ by @-@ products from L. reu@@ ter@@ i develop the cells in humans as in mice , but defects in genes in relation to tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han were found in people with inflammatory bo@@ wel disease .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The development of these cells is probably something we would like to promote since these cells control inflamm@@ ations on the inner surface of the intest@@ ines . &quot; &quot; &quot;
potentially high tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han values in the presence of L. reu@@ ter@@ i can lead to an extension of this population . &quot;
Jose M@@ our@@ in@@ ho believes that Manchester United has committed a &quot; gen@@ ius &quot; with N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic
in Manchester United with N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic signed a &quot; gen@@ ius , &quot; Jose M@@ our@@ in@@ ho believes after the mid@@ fiel@@ der on Wednesday evening had his debut at S@@ amp@@ dor@@ ia .
the 40 million pound signature from Chelsea started with a 2 : 1 victory in Dublin , the last pre @-@ season game before the UEF@@ A Super Cup starts against Real Madrid on Tuesday , and impressed in the holder &apos;s role as people like Paul Pog@@ ba and Andreas Per@@ eira mar@@ ched at will .
however , M@@ atic was excluded from the pre @-@ Asian tour of the blues , only 45 minutes later , what M@@ our@@ in@@ ho admitted that he had to improve before the Premier League season .
&quot; he needs time , but his experience , intelligence , gen@@ ius in the way he thinks - he thinks football , &quot; M@@ our@@ in@@ ho said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will help him to be ready sooner than later . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
besides M@@ atic , Victor Lin@@ del@@ of and Rom@@ el@@ u Lu@@ k@@ ak@@ u started in the Avi@@ va stadium , when M@@ our@@ in@@ ho formed his start @-@ XI for the beginning of the season .
the Independent revealed this week that M@@ our@@ in@@ ho had three more new commitments , but he insist@@ ed that the club had already done a &quot; fantastic job , &quot; three of its four priority real@@ ign@@ ments to be fulfilled .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; three out of four , I thank the association , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will be happ@@ ier if they get four out of four for me , but they have taken great effort . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bo@@ eing &quot; m@@ alt &quot; Dream@@ liner in the sky
the U.S. aircraft manufacturer Bo@@ eing has painted the sil@@ houette of a Dream@@ liner in the sky .
the pilot fle@@ w from Seattle in the US State of Washington , but the drawing began in Marqu@@ ette in US state Michigan and moved in the form of a Dream@@ liner across the USA , which are several thousand kilometres .
the action lasted 18 hours and a minute .
on the radar screens the shape of a Dream@@ liner was to be .
the whole thing was a endurance test for new engines .
Bo@@ eing had already made such advertising earlier .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the number &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 7@@ 87 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the Bo@@ eing logo was painted in the sky . &quot; &quot; &quot;
new grav@@ itation for Martin Schulz - Hanover , we have a problem
as the wind turned , as Sig@@ mar Gabriel was still the SPD leader , social @-@ democratic Prime Minister , before elections , always looked after Berlin with a certain concern .
only no interference from the party central , but no head@@ wind from the Con@@ federation , was the most important wish of the elec@@ toral fighters .
since Martin Schulz leads the party , this has changed fundamentally .
since then , the employees from the Willy @-@ Brandt @-@ Haus ob@@ serving the events in the SPD @-@ governed state capit@@ als .
what Schulz has received from there since the beginning of the year would not be described in the approach with a head@@ wind .
there were pl@@ ur@@ als .
and one by one .
following the surprising end of the red @-@ green majority in Lower Saxony , the Federal C@@ DU has a general signal against co@@ al@@ itions of the SPD and the Gre@@ ens .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this once again shows more : red @-@ green can simply not gover@@ n reliably , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said C@@ DU @-@ General Peter Tau@@ ber to the editorial network Germany ( R@@ ND ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the surprising fac@@ tional exit of a Green @-@ member has pl@@ ung@@ ed the government of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) into a serious crisis .
five months before the country &apos;s election , its red @-@ green coalition was losing its one @-@ vote majority to the opposition from C@@ DU and F@@ DP .
the Green @-@ German Managing Director Michael Kell@@ ner ur@@ ged the apost@@ ate lower @-@ Saxon Gre@@ ens @-@ Euro MPs from El@@ ke T@@ westen to return her mandate .
the re@@ sign@@ ation to the C@@ DU is a clear fal@@ si@@ fication of the elec@@ torate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; El@@ ke T@@ westen immediately needs to return her mandate , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the German executive and elec@@ toral campaign of the Gre@@ ens to the editorial network of Germany ( R@@ ND ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it must not be true , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sig@@ h a SPD @-@ elec@@ tive figh@@ ter , when on Friday morning the new Job Message reached the party headquarters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Stephan Wei@@ l , SPD Prime Minister of Lower Saxony , stands after the re@@ sign@@ ation of the green dep@@ u@@ ties El@@ ke T@@ westen to the C@@ DU without its own government majority .
it is the pro@@ visional climax of a whole series of large and small crises in SPD state feder@@ ations .
and nobody knows what comes next .
the Mis@@ ere began with the un@@ expect@@ edly significant defeat in the Saar@@ land election in March .
a blue eye , more did not , cal@@ med the com@@ rades at that time .
after the National@@ rat@@ sw@@ ahlen in Schleswig @-@ Holstein and Nordrhein @-@ Westfalen everything will be different .
this was also the case - and it all became much worse .
the defeat in Kiel brought the SPD into the de@@ bit , the Düsseldorf bank@@ rup@@ t@@ cy made the party smooth .
the com@@ rades had lab@@ orious again in the weeks after that .
then , when they had just created new courage , the G @-@ 20 summit of Hamburg came .
and with him came the next storm .
Mayor Olaf Sch@@ olz , the last strong SPD head of the SPD , lost his Nim@@ bus on that weekend because he was sitting in the El@@ b@@ phil@@ harmon@@ ie while his city was burning .
and because he did everything wrong in crisis communication , what could be done wrong .
since then , Sch@@ olz has been fighting for his political survival .
now also Stephan Wei@@ l .
because of the VW emission and its role in the Supervisory Board , the Prime Minister &apos;s Prime Minister has been in criticism for some time now .
mi@@ ese survey results came added .
nevertheless , or perhaps precisely why , in recent weeks , Wei@@ l tried getting stronger in the League of acc@@ ents .
the aim of the former mayor of Hanover to expand its power in Berlin remained hidden in the environment by Martin Schulz .
they let him give him as they promised a stabi@@ lization of the party from Wei@@ l .
now the exact opposite could occur .
at the same time Wei@@ l meets the party @-@ internal co@@ er@@ ci@@ on of the Lower Saxony @-@ Gre@@ ens basically no gu@@ ilt .
and Schulz is not at all .
at times the com@@ rades try to keep their own ranks closed .
their anger is directed toward the Gre@@ ens , and here especially on the rebel@@ li@@ ous Par@@ li@@ ament@@ arians in T@@ westen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is unbe@@ ar@@ able and democr@@ ati@@ fying , as Ms. T@@ westen puts her own career on the interests of everyone else , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Matthias M@@ ier@@ sch , Head of the Party Left in the SPD Par@@ li@@ ament@@ ary Group , the editorial network of Germany ( R@@ ND ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; woman T@@ westen has not been elected to Parliament because of her person as a direct candidate , but on the country list of the Lower Saxony &apos;s Gre@@ ens . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the logical consequence would be that she returns to her mandate .
Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , Head of the SPD Par@@ li@@ ament@@ ary Group , compl@@ ains a &quot; un@@ democratic maneu@@ ver . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the elec@@ toral campaign four years ago was clear : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people have made Stephan Wei@@ l as prime minister , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Op@@ per@@ mann , who leads the Dutch SPD as top candidate to the German elections , the R@@ ND . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now the personal career of a future C@@ DU @-@ MPs cor@@ rup@@ ts the election result , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Op@@ per@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he called for clar@@ i@@ fying the background .
I want to know if there has been more or has given further commitments of the C@@ DU Lower Saxony .
convey@@ ors for Ort@@ sk@@ ern III
who wants to renov@@ ate his house in the years can soon get support from the country .
the mayor Albert Sch@@ in@@ dler and three representatives of ST@@ EG urban development on Wednesday were informed about this .
at the beginning of the information event , Sch@@ in@@ dler was once again looking back on what happened .
since 1991 it has been in sens@@ it@@ isation areas .
at that time , in the San@@ itation Area I from 1991 to 2004 , the State of Baden @-@ Württemberg took over two thirds of the funding amount .
in the II from 2005 to 2016 , the subsi@@ dy was still 60 percent .
for Sch@@ in@@ dler , the previous renov@@ ations are a &quot; success project &quot; - it is ultimately important to encourage internal development and not only to open new construction areas .
on April 4 , I received the information from the Government Council of Karlsruhe that there will be a rehabilitation area III .
the funding amount was 833 333 euros , of which 500 000 euros would be from the country , the rest from the municipality &apos;s sensiti@@ v@@ ities .
how is a rehabilitation area now created ?
one will continue to study as Sch@@ in@@ dler , where the &quot; really old &quot; houses are .
but it also plays a role as to whether in the planned area they are interested in re@@ building .
if necessary , the regional boundaries could also be post@@ pon@@ ed again .
the ST@@ EG spent on Wednesday evening Martin Keller , Gab@@ y Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann and Sarah Got@@ zel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Keller presented the contents of the Federal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Social Town Programme &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; in which the refurb@@ ishments would then be carried out . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the core of the program is the re@@ vit@@ alization of inner cities , improving living and working relationships and maintaining and expanding the infrastructure .
the measures would be object @-@ related , i.e. per property .
the remedi@@ ation area would then finally set as a pro@@ position .
the grant period for the funding period has been running until April 30 , 2017 until April 30 , 2026 .
until September this year , however , it would only be possible to take stock of stock , in the context of those participating in the renovation area will receive a questionn@@ aire to fill out the questionn@@ aire .
in November or December , the decree must be carried out as possible , so that the rehabil@@ itations can be started in the coming year .
Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann subsequently stated that each commun@@ e must carry out the said preliminary investigations .
it is about evalu@@ ating and deciding the resi@@ li@@ ence of the city and decide when it is rehabil@@ itated and to what extent .
a re@@ mark in the basic book will be registered for the respective property .
Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann will even come back to feelings and get a picture of the situation , she promised .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Got@@ zel emphas@@ ised , a key success factor for the project is the participation of the participants . &quot; &quot; &quot;
that is why there will be questionn@@ aires that will be sent post @-@ electron@@ ically to the citizens in the coming weeks and can be filled out until the end of the summer holidays .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the yellow questionn@@ aire is the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; building and land arc &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; in which it is possible , among other things , about the structural condition and the restructuring process . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the gray questionn@@ aire , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; household and housing &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; information about size , division and inhabitants of a residential area can be made . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the blue &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; operating sheet &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; can only be completed when operating in the building premises . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , to note , Got@@ zel pointed out that a filled questionn@@ aire is not at the same time an application for funding .
moreover , new building measures are not condu@@ ci@@ ve .
Sch@@ in@@ dler still emphas@@ ised that the distribution of the subsidies according to the &quot; gre@@ y@@ ho@@ und principle &quot; - who comes first , ex@@ h@@ orts first .
&quot; &quot; &quot; no funds can be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reserve &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for later . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; finally pictures of the project &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ort@@ sk@@ ern II &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; were shown to make a renovation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tasty &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
British invent@@ or sets itself a micro@@ chip in order to get in house and car with a hand movement
a British invent@@ or is the first in the country equipped with a micro@@ chip to open his door , enter his office and even start his car with a hand movement .
Steven North@@ am , 33 , had im@@ planted the tiny chip between thum@@ b and index finger and now offers the service for companies and individuals who want to simplify their life with technology through its company Bio@@ Te@@ q .
he joined Dr. Ge@@ off Wat@@ son , a consultant at the Royal H@@ amp@@ shire County Hospital in Win@@ chester , H@@ ants , to ensure that the im@@ plant procedure is performed according to medical standards .
the technology re@@ sembles a cat and dogs im@@ planted micro@@ chip and lasts only 30 seconds .
the company of Mr. North@@ am also wants to change the locks on houses and cars so that they are compatible with the chip , all for a surcharge of £ 300 per lock .

the advertising costs of the White House cost the tax@@ pay@@ er thousands
the decision of the White House to fly a nav@@ y helicop@@ ter to the South La@@ wn for an event that highlights American production last month costs tax@@ pay@@ ers according to the military service provided to the TIME Magazine , up to 24,@@ 000 US dollars .
the green @-@ white Sik@@ or@@ sky V@@ H @-@ 3D , known as Marine One , when the president is on board , was the cent@@ rep@@ iece of the event on July 17th in the White House with American construction programs .
President Donald Tr@@ ump , Vice President , Mike P@@ ence and senior officials of the White House made a tour through products from all 50 countries .
the helicop@@ ter was built in Connec@@ tic@@ ut next to a yacht from Ma@@ ine , a fire bri@@ g@@ ade car from Wis@@ cons@@ in and a forkli@@ ft from Miss@@ issi@@ ppi .
the military office of the White House requested the presence of the helicop@@ ter in a frag@@ mentary order or fr@@ ago , barely 36 hours before the helicop@@ ter landed on the South La@@ wn , according to the recordings of the Marine Hel@@ icop@@ ter S@@ quad@@ ron One ( H@@ MX @-@ 1 ) , the unit responsible for the operation of the helicop@@ ter .
&quot; I only wanted you to be aware of it , because it is such an unusual event with high visibility , &quot; wrote the commander of the H@@ MX @-@ 1 on the eve of the event his su@@ peri@@ ors , the dep@@ uty commander of the Navy .
the message showed that the helicop@@ ter arrived at 7 o &apos;clock in the morning at 7 o &apos;clock in the morning , and stayed until the lawn was cleared between 18 : 00 and 21 : 00 .
the note adds that if the departure from the White House was delayed , a second team would be required for the return flight due to the limitation of the hours .
the original flight crew was at the helicop@@ ter during the event , while the security personnel of the unit remained on the ground during the time on the aircraft .
the records provided by the TIME were not clear whether a second flight crew was ultimately required .
the H@@ atch Act for@@ bi@@ ds federal states to use state property for political purposes .
dat@@ as@@ ets indicate that H@@ MX @-@ 1 asked if the event could viol@@ ate the destiny .
&quot; a question we asked was whether it was a violation of the H@@ atch Act and we were informed that this was not the case , &quot; wrote the commander .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sounds as if you are locked &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the dep@@ uty commander answered . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the event &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Made in America &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was designated by the White House as an official event and would not be covered by the H@@ atch Act . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but also official events have political over@@ tones .
at the event , the president gave an imp@@ etus to reform of the health reform that was in the Senate , and he propag@@ ated the efforts to em@@ ulate government regulations .
the use of the aircraft , which is known as Marine One or Air Force One , is hardly a new phenomenon from politically advantageous purposes .
President are obliged to use them for the journey .
but to claim their use only for a photo operation is unusual .
in February Tr@@ ump performed an investigation , when the presidential plane was in front of the background of his first campaign r@@ all@@ ye in Melbourne , Florida , taxi services , and his Twitter account is full of news that compl@@ ain about the use of the presidential plane through its predecessor .
&quot; the White House is inspired by the Show &quot; Made in America &quot; - the products from all 50 states produced by American workers with American materials , &quot; said the dep@@ uty secretary of the White House , Lind@@ say Wal@@ ters .
H@@ MX @-@ 1 cre@@ ws frequently perform training flights in the Washington area around Washington and South La@@ wn to susp@@ end the US president in the White House with precise centi@@ meter sets .
when Tr@@ ump was in Germany at the beginning of July at the G@@ 20 summit , H@@ MX @-@ 1 conducted 58 practice land@@ ings in the White House .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the flight for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Made in America &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; event included the training needs of the flight crew for the month , said an official . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; helicop@@ ter units also fle@@ w 11 hours a day for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; non @-@ presidential support missions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the White House said that tax@@ pay@@ ers took the burden for none of the other pro@@ ps presented at the event .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a spokes@@ man from Sik@@ or@@ sky said that the company was not involved in putting the helicop@@ ter out on the South La@@ wn . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
H@@ MX @-@ 1 does not maintain budget records for the presidential flights , and it is difficult to determine the exact cost of the event .
according to the St@@ and@@ un@@ ari@@ fen of the U.S. Department of Defense for the fiscal year 2017 , the Do@@ D reim@@ bur@@ sement rate for the V@@ H @-@ 3D is 24.@@ 380 USD per hour .
records of the unit records the flight time of the aircraft as 30 minutes from the home base of Marine Cor@@ ps Air Fac@@ ility in Qu@@ an@@ tico in Virginia .
the White House ar@@ gues that the actual costs for the operation of the helicop@@ ter lie far below this rate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the cost of tax@@ pay@@ ers on the basis of estimates for reim@@ bur@@ sement rates is highly mis@@ leading , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wal@@ ters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these estimates include personnel , maintenance and many other hidden costs that are included in the annual funding . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to a R@@ AND study from 2015 , the reim@@ bur@@ sement rates for Do@@ D do not include personnel costs , but take into account the cost of fuel , maintenance and conclusion of the contract .
at this time the former press spokes@@ man of the White House , Se@@ an Sp@@ ic@@ er , def@@ ended the use of helicop@@ ter for the event .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the idea is to present things that are made in America , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Sp@@ ic@@ er . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and I know that Sik@@ or@@ sky and the Connec@@ tic@@ ut state are very proud that they contribute to our national security and I assume that hundreds if not thousands of people depend on it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I think like most Americans , we are all proud of the helicop@@ ter and other military equipment for which so many Americans have worked ti@@ rel@@ essly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; of course it is appropriate to highlight this . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was not clear whether Tr@@ ump inter@@ acted with the helicop@@ ter when he entered his tour across the South La@@ wn for the event , but he sat down in the driver &apos;s seat of a fire figh@@ ter car .
in the White House Tr@@ ump spoke to representatives of Sik@@ or@@ sky and talked with the media about his own fleet of company products .
&quot; I know Sik@@ or@@ sky very well , &quot; said the president , &quot; I have three of them . &quot;
TC BW Ne@@ uss in front of kne@@ eling task

the TC blue @-@ white Ne@@ uss will take place tomorrow at 11 o &apos;clock in Kiel at the Tab@@ ell@@ end@@ rit@@ ten Su@@ chs@@ dorfer SV .
despite the five games still f@@ law@@ less balance , the top leader of the Second tennis Bundes@@ liga has given the sense of reality .
team Princip@@ al Mari@@ us Z@@ ay at any rate has respect for the opponent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a compact team that always plays in quite similar formation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; especially in the post@@ erior position I find the team very good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for class and stability at the Su@@ chs@@ dorfer SV especially the imports from the high north .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; their Dan@@ es and Finn@@ s can even refer to wag@@ ers in the Davis Cup . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and they are also strong in the double , &quot; says Z@@ ay with views of Har@@ ri Hel@@ i@@ ov@@ a@@ ara ( Finland ) , Andr@@ e Gö@@ ran@@ sson ( Sweden ) , S@@ ör@@ en and Es@@ ben O@@ lesen , Martin Pe@@ der@@ sen and Andreas Bj@@ erre@@ h@@ us ( all Denmark ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this will be hard for us . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; you need a good portion of luck . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ne@@ uss@@ er crew for the trip to the high north is convenient .
his debut for blue @-@ white could give Maxim@@ e Jan@@ vier .
at the moment , the Chall@@ enger tournament in the Italian Bi@@ ella active Fr@@ ench@@ man does not lead to the Bundes@@ liga @-@ Par@@ tie , the Z@@ den@@ ek Kol@@ ar ( Czech Republic ) playing at the Czech Liber@@ ec ( Czech Republic ) is at his first place in this season .

how America can harm the O@@ MV
Donald Tr@@ ump was not really happy when he placed his signature on Wednesday evening under the law for ti@@ ghtening sanctions against Russia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in his ha@@ ste to leave the law , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I judged Congress a few &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ constitutional provisions &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Moscow reaction was also as sharp as expected , and even Brussels was fo@@ aming the US thrust .
after all , the draft plans to pun@@ ish European companies that help the Russi@@ ans to build gas pi@@ pel@@ ines in the EU .
since then , investors of local O@@ MV , who co @-@ financed the construction of the Russian Baltic Sea Region North Stream 2 together with other European companies .
the Dro@@ h@@ kul@@ isse is huge .
nevertheless , it is too early for an assessment of the consequences , thus the official statement of the oil company .
in fact , Donald Tr@@ ump himself would have to raise the sanctions even by Executive Order .
twelve weapons give him a choice .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the press &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; looked at which the Group could aver@@ t and which could really hurt him . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Nar@@ cos Rel@@ ay 3 Trailer : without Pablo Es@@ co@@ bar the Cal@@ i Cart@@ el is moved to the center of the series of Net@@ fli@@ x
despite the second season of Nar@@ cos , who un@@ vei@@ led Pablo Es@@ co@@ bars killer , Net@@ fli@@ x &apos;s series is not over yet .
the bat@@ ches three and four were already confirmed by streaming service , the first got their first trailer and showed the latest vill@@ ains of the show .
with the third season , DE@@ A has directed their attention to the rich@@ est organization of drug traff@@ icking in the world : the Cal@@ i Kart@@ ell .
led by four powerful sponsors , they operate &quot; like a Fort@@ une 500 @-@ company &quot; only with more government bri@@ ber@@ y and violent actions .
Gil@@ berto Rodri@@ gu@@ ez Ore@@ ju@@ ela ( Dami@@ an Alc@@ azar ) is the leader of the Kart@@ ells , Miguel Rodri@@ gu@@ ez Ore@@ ju@@ ela ( Francisco Denis ) is her head , Pach@@ o Herr@@ era ( Alberto Am@@ mann ) commands the Mexican connection , and Ch@@ ep@@ e Sant@@ ac@@ ru@@ z London@@ o ( Pep@@ e Rap@@ az@@ ote ) is located in New York .
in the newly published trailer , Pedro Pascal returns to J@@ avier Pe@@ ña , the guy who invites American and Colom@@ bian prosec@@ ution authorities to support the war against drugs .
other new actors are M@@ ati@@ as Var@@ ela , Michael Stahl @-@ David , Matt W@@ hel@@ an , Miguel Angel Silvest@@ re , Kerry bis@@ he and Ar@@ tur@@ o Castro .
the third season of Nar@@ cos will begin on September 1st .
Roll back@@ wards : the city provides 46 kitchen aids
the city organis@@ es the K@@ ita lun@@ ch@@ time itself .
with fixed contacts for the children and an assignment to the team .
the clock will be turned back in the municipal nur@@ ser@@ y workshops .
on the 1st of September the city Kre@@ feld takes over the food supply to the municipal kinder@@ gart@@ ens ( Kit@@ as ) again in self @-@ reg@@ iment .
for Son@@ ja Pom@@ mer@@ anz , vice @-@ chairman in the youth welfare department , this is a good news : &quot; we were all very pleased . &quot;
bo@@ iled will continue to be bo@@ iled : a cat@@ erer takes over this task and delivers freshly cooked cooled .
the city operates in the area of 46 day@@ care centres in the Kre@@ feld area , in 44 the children receive a hot meal at lun@@ ch@@ time .
last year , 2800 children were seated at the tables , and the need is growing steadily .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; meanwhile , not only children who are taken care of 45 weekly hours , in the K@@ ita for lunch , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Pom@@ mer@@ anz . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the offer is also valid in the 35 @-@ hour care when children stay until 2 pm . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
46 part @-@ time forces begin on 1 September kitchen service : they heat up the delivered food , supplement them with salad , raw food and fruit , por@@ tion@@ ate the meal individually , give food off , clean , rin@@ se and clean the kitchen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the workers are firmly assigned to a K@@ ita , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Pom@@ mer@@ anz . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the size - there are two groups as well as sevent@@ y units - decides on the ho@@ ur@@ ly circum@@ ference .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the kitchen assist@@ ants now belong to the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ ita @-@ Team &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says Pom@@ mer@@ anz . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so they are much more involved and it is easier to implement ped@@ agog@@ ical concepts for the care of the k@@ ite . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that &apos;s why it &apos;s all about healthy nutrition and cooking lessons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; children should help prepare food . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the direct connection of the kitchen personnel to the team is reasonable .
also for the children .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they have a well @-@ known power in the K@@ ita , a person familiar to them , and not constantly changing people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this continuity is important for the children .
the cleansing of the K@@ ita rooms - until now also the task of the kitchen forces - is done by special cleaning personnel in the future .
this variant - the separation of cleaning and kitchen service - besides the quality improvement of the kitchen performance , has also the charm that it has shown in the cost comparison between equity and foreign allocation for the city as the most economical one , is it from the press office .
and that , although 46 part @-@ time forces are re@@ configured .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but these hours are not so strong for some 750 people in the education area , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Son@@ ja Pom@@ mer@@ anz . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Afgh@@ an democracy depends on the political role of women , says the UN
elections can only be representative if all members of society , including women , play a role , said the Chief of the UN Mission in Afghanistan on Wednesday .
Nicholas Hay@@ som , acting head of the United Nations mission , said that hundreds of women are chann@@ eling in the provinces . three women are chann@@ eling the role of vice @-@ presi@@ dents and more than 30 percent of newly registered vot@@ ers are women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the role of women cannot be over@@ estimated &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he said on Wednesday in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
elections can only be truly representative and credi@@ ble when women participate fully and be involved in all parts of the election process .
Afgh@@ an elections for the provincial council and presidential elections take place on April 5 .
the Tali@@ ban have published threats against a choice trial which coinci@@ des with the transition of international combat operations to an advisory role .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this year the elections for the first time will give the power peace from a democr@@ atically elected government to the next . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hay@@ som said a strong role for women will strengthen Afghanistan &apos;s democratic success . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Afgh@@ an Independent Ele@@ ction Commission reports that 1.2 million women are registered by a total of registered 3.6 million vot@@ ers .

two young men aged 19 and 23 should have tried on Thursday to ro@@ b a 13 @-@ year @-@ old girl .
according to the police , the men said the 13 @-@ year @-@ old who held up with friends at the Kol@@ p@@ ing@@ straße , at 2.@@ 55 a.m. , because they wanted to phone the girl &apos;s mobile phone .
the 13 @-@ year @-@ old rejected the request and continued with their friends .

the two young men were later arrested by the police .
the investigations run .
G@@ MB concern about investments in the Mc@@ Vit@@ ie factory in Glas@@ go@@ w
in management of the bis@@ cu@@ it producer Mc@@ Vit@@ ie , a union would like to make sure the long @-@ term commitment to production at its plant in Glas@@ go@@ w .
G@@ MB Scotland said that the company was silent about the future of investments at the T@@ oll@@ cross location .
more than 500 employees work in the plant , which besides other products Hob@@ art and R@@ ich Tea K@@ ek@@ se produces .
Mc@@ V@@ ities owner Pla@@ di said he invested more than 5 million pounds in recent years .
he added that workers and union representatives would be &quot; first experienced &quot; if their activities would change .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a letter to the company &apos;s branch , G@@ MB Scotland Mc@@ Vit@@ ie &apos;s invited to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; raise concerns that financing for modernis@@ ation of production lines will not be promoted . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
G@@ MB @-@ Senior @-@ Organis@@ ator Dre@@ w Du@@ ffy , said : &quot; the fact that we cannot gain clarity about the business needs and investment plans for the future of T@@ oll@@ cross , our members are deeply concerned .
generations of families have worked here and the workers concentrated strongly on the local community and the Gre@@ ater Glas@@ go@@ w , an important pillar for decent employment in an area with high unemployment and social dis@@ advantage .
therefore , under the perspective of jobs , wages and prosperity , and against the background of Bre@@ x@@ it , the rising cost of living and the chronic production decline , the eastern end of Glas@@ go@@ w urg@@ ently requires a flour@@ ishing production presence at Mc@@ Vit@@ ie . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a spokes@@ person from Pla@@ di said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Fili@@ alle@@ iter at T@@ oll@@ cross has just received a letter from G@@ MB Scotland , and the company will respond directly to it , as we value the ongoing commitment to employees and trade union representatives . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two months ago we had a regular meeting with employees and G@@ MB @-@ representatives at T@@ oll@@ cross , where some questions were openly discussed .
we discussed with the employees that we , like all the companies operating in an extremely competitive and uns@@ af@@ e business climate , constantly review our businesses - and this applies to all our business areas and locations - to stay competitive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in recent years , we invested more than 5 million pounds in our T@@ oll@@ cross site , especially in production lines and operational improvements . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we recognise the legacy of T@@ oll@@ cross as production site fully and entirely . should our operations change at the site , the employees and their union representatives will be the first to experience this . &quot;
did the PSG Barcelona war@@ n of Ne@@ ym@@ ar three years ago ?
the page of La Liga may regret your interest in Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti
Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main will not ref@@ rain from the persecution of Ne@@ ym@@ ar after having submitted a £ 189 million offer to release its release cl@@ ause , but did they war@@ n Barcelona three years ago before the world record ?
the sens@@ ational approach has heated the transfer window in the summer , because the Lig@@ ue 1 club is ready to break the world record by more than the double of the previous brand , whereby Paul Pog@@ ba returned to Manchester United in the past season for 89 million pounds .
after finishing , Ne@@ ym@@ ar becomes the most expensive player in the world and the highest @-@ paid professional sport@@ s@@ man in the world . PSG offers wages of more than 500@@ ,000 GBP per week .
Barcelona is angry about the way Ne@@ ym@@ ar en@@ forced its way outside , although a source near the Catal@@ ana Board insi@@ sts that the club always has its best to take care of it since its arrival from Santos in 2013 .
but was the football world war@@ ns against this prospect three years ago ?
when Manchester City expressed interest in the signing of Bla@@ ise M@@ atu@@ i@@ di , N@@ asser Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi had a strict warning for every club that wanted to sign one of the best players of PSG .
&quot; I &apos;m not worried because they know that when they touch one of our players , we will be in opposition to them , we will contact their players , &quot; said Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi .
&quot; we respect all the clubs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but if they try to sign one of our players , this will have consequences . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Barcelona seems to have crossed this line , whereby the Spanish club expressed interest at the beginning of this summer interest in the PSG mid@@ fiel@@ der Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti .
PSG progres@@ sed clearly that they would not allow the International from Italy to travel under any circumstances , and Barcelona could feel the consequences of this interest by losing one of their price deals for Ne@@ ym@@ ar .

interview : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dom@@ sp@@ atzen &apos;s report reli@@ eves the Pope &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Georg R@@ atz@@ inger &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen @-@ report on the mis@@ use cases reli@@ eves the Pope &apos;s brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
this means author and hist@@ orian Michael Hes@@ emann .
the final report on the abuse sc@@ andal in the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen continues for discussions .
Christian Weis@@ nder , spokes@@ man for the reform movement , &quot; We are the Church , &quot; said after publication in front of the German press agency , he expects the former R@@ atz@@ inger Bishop and present @-@ day Car@@ dinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller as well as by the Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , the 93 @-@ year brother of the retired Pope Benedi@@ ct XVI , an exc@@ use .
it would serve the respect of the Catholic Church very much if Müller and R@@ atz@@ inger would express their deep regret about their own om@@ issions or their then false evaluation of the events .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Vatican Secretary &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Os@@ serv@@ at@@ ore Rom@@ ano &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; on the other hand , crit@@ ici@@ zed that in reporting on violence in the cathedral @-@ cats with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; two measures &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
regarding the attacks in Regensburg , no one doubt that it would have to be &quot; sh@@ ame@@ ful and sh@@ ame@@ ful acts , &quot; which would have to be pun@@ ished and prevented in the future ; but the &quot; degree of media manipulation , &quot; said the author Luc@@ etta Scar@@ aff@@ ia , hist@@ orian and member of the National Italian Bio@@ ethics Committee .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the hab@@ it of describing the Catholic Church as a source of all ev@@ ils is already part of everyday life and prepar@@ es public opinion to keep it normal , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; writes Scar@@ aff@@ ia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Princess Gl@@ oria of Th@@ urn and Tax@@ is said in an interview with Bay@@ er@@ ischer Rundfunk : &quot; one likes to go to the church and this is a found fres@@ co@@ es . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she also pointed out that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; strikes a completely normal educational tool &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; have been &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to cope with che@@ ek@@ y children as I was one . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are un@@ fair to apply today &apos;s standards for past decades , as the world has changed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in connection with the reports on the abuse of abuse , Pope brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger often appeared .
&quot; &quot; &quot; totally un@@ just@@ ly , author and hist@@ orian Michael Hes@@ emann , who wrote the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mein Bruder of the Pope &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with R@@ atz@@ inger ( translated into 12 languages ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I must take Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in protection , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Hes@@ emann , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for all this had nothing to do with him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he evalu@@ ates the results of the final report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
what exactly stands in the 440 @-@ page report presented by the German di@@ oc@@ ese Regensburg with the clar@@ ification of attor@@ ney Ulrich Weber ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; a total of 547 Rain@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen were &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; victims of attacks &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; 67 Dom@@ sp@@ atzen were sex@@ ually ab@@ used between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the final report , it is said to Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , who was active in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994 : &quot; in summary , it can be said that by Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister R. in many cases , forms of physical and psychological violence have been applied .
especially with high emotion@@ ality , the punishment for the students was even more violent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , unlike many other accused , many victims have estimated the general humanity of R. and therefore , in numerous cases , even have positive memories with him , despite violence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the interview E@@ zek@@ iel explains why the Final Report was reli@@ eved of the abuse sc@@ andal at the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in his opinion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. Hes@@ emann , the 440 @-@ page report on the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; inci@@ dents of violence of violence in protective cases &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a contradi@@ c@@ tory picture of Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for one , many students empha@@ size his &quot; humanity . &quot;
on the other hand , it also appears as a chol@@ era and perfec@@ tion@@ ist , which became handy when a domain sp@@ eck didn &apos;t bring top performance musi@@ cally .
how do you evaluate this final report as his bio@@ grapher ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : if you make the effort and read the whole 440 pages long report from the front to the back , you have to ask yourself why the name Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is in general .
just eight pages are dedicated to him and he is clearly acqu@@ itted of any suspic@@ ion of the mid@@ day or fellow @-@ hood in the terrible cases of sexual abuse .
the ex@@ cess@@ es of violence at the pre @-@ school also occurred outside of his sphere of activity .
at best it is possible to repro@@ ach him , learn from it too late or not have taken first hints seriously enough .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Dom@@ sp@@ atz@@ eng@@ ymn@@ asi@@ um , on which he worked , was felt by virtually all respon@@ dents - as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; salvation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; heaven &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; better world &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the vast majority of his pupils Georg R@@ atz@@ inger also describes it as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; warm hear@@ ty , &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sincer@@ ely , &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; competent &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; competent &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; competent &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; competent &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; always cared for by grapes grown from children . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
only a minority compl@@ ains about his perfec@@ tion@@ ism and his high emotion@@ ality that led to bur@@ gl@@ ary breaks even before .
that he did not only kne@@ ad with chairs and cast the keys on the floor , but also distributed ear @-@ fig@@ s and pulled too nau@@ gh@@ ty guys to the hair or ears , he himself had admitted years ago , deeply regre@@ ts and ap@@ ologi@@ zed for this .
to his salvation , however , must be said that such educational methods were widespread in the question@@ able time , the 1960s and 1970s , in parents like teachers .
do you still know such breeding methods ?
of course , I think everyone of us , who was born before 1968 .
I also experienced it in a se@@ cular school , a state gymn@@ asi@@ um .
compared to what actually is in this report , namely , the horri@@ fic sexual abuse and the ex@@ cess@@ es of violence at the pre @-@ school , there is certainly Bag@@ at@@ elles .
you wonder if it &apos;s not about his acquain@@ tance and his role as a brother of Benedi@@ ct XVI , that many media just fell on him .
at the Bavarian pop@@ e many people who have never understood him are still busy .
but the truth is : the report reli@@ eves Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in every respect !
in the media , in connection with the report a lot was reported about the issue of abuse in the Regensburg Dom@@ sp@@ atzen .
is Georg R@@ atz@@ inger put in the final report also any under@@ taking or co @-@ operation with regard to sexual abuse ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : clearly no .
not one of the 67 victims of sexual assault claimed to have entrusted himself to the Cathedral Chapel .
not even the parents were consecr@@ ated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I never dar@@ ed to talk about it with my father or mother , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said one affected representative for the others , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It was all very embarrass@@ ing to me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the real problem with the enlighten@@ ment of sexual abuse has been and is , however , that most victims are silent . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if they did not even trust parents and si@@ bl@@ ings , then certainly not a ch@@ oral leader , who had been professionally a college of perpet@@ rators .
how do the domain @-@ mit@@ ts students rate R@@ atz@@ inger &apos;s role in regard to the mis@@ use cases ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : a question@@ ed student formulated it in such a way : &quot; regarding sexual abuse ... I see ... no case in which he ( Georg R@@ atz@@ inger ) had had timely re@@ aliz@@ ations and could have stopped the respective perpet@@ r@@ ator .
I think it ... also for really absurd to assume that all of this ... boys inv@@ ade in@@ tru@@ ely and clear@@ er or even more , than opposite their parents , dormit@@ ories , trust@@ ees , etc .
&quot; &quot; &quot; that you talk to him about sex ... - un@@ think@@ able . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; thus the report comes to the very clear result : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that the students and / or their surroundings confi@@ ded in the run @-@ up could not be confirmed in the context of the investigation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as far as sexual abuse is concerned , so , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is free to speak about any fellow man .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so he cannot be accused of being prevented or brought to the announcement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
therefore there is no reason to link his good name to these contradi@@ c@@ tory crimes , as unfortunately happened in some cases .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a lot of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; violence ex@@ cess@@ es &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the media was to be read in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rain@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the former Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is disc@@ arded in the report &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Look Out &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
must he live with this repro@@ ach ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : this is the big problem that in the reporting everything is mixed and mixed up to a huge mel@@ ange of sexual abuse and violence ex@@ cess@@ es and somewhere , in the middle of dr@@ in , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
but this again is an abuse of the report .
therefore it is clean separated : between the pre @-@ school and the gymn@@ asi@@ um of the cathedral @-@ cats , between sexual abuse and ex@@ cess@@ es as well as , we say once , other repro@@ aches .
in addition , the report covers events from time since 1945 , so also for four decades , in which Georg R@@ atz@@ inger was not the choir director of the cathedral @-@ cats .
the whole aw@@ ful exam@@ iner ped@@ agog@@ y , the cases in which boys of sa@@ dist@@ ic teachers were properly chann@@ eled and mal@@ ign@@ ed , and who suffered them horri@@ bly , occurred all at the pre @-@ school in Et@@ ter@@ z@@ hausen and P@@ iel@@ en@@ hofen , where really sc@@ andal@@ ous conditions have to prevail .
but with those , Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger had nothing to do , because he only got the boys his face when they were already at the gymn@@ asi@@ um gymn@@ asi@@ um .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on that , like most witnesses , emphas@@ ise the subject &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pre@@ school &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
one was only happy to be able to escape and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even &quot; paradi@@ si@@ ac@@ al &quot; conditions .
what was different from the gymn@@ asi@@ um gymn@@ asi@@ um ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : there was discipline , but there was no sa@@ dist@@ ic violence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this also applies to Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , where the report conclu@@ des that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many victims are estimated the general humanity of R. and therefore in numerous cases even positive memories with him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the most , it remains the repro@@ ach to have looked away .
however , despite all efforts , the report could only define two periods in which it was reported by the states at the pre @-@ school .
the first time 1970 / 71 when he began to establish himself and from the events at a school in which he was not working and responsible , ( so the witness ) wanted nothing to hear , and then again around 1993 .
did Georg R@@ atz@@ inger consistently close the ears ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : no , because already in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the Dom@@ sp@@ atz@@ eng@@ ymn@@ asi@@ um , who even reproduced the report .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in this he points out to this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that in the pre @-@ school , the audit is still practic@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
even in the face of the danger of negative media representatives , he recommended urgent action .
this was , of course , at a time when legal clarity was , when inspec@@ tors were bann@@ ed in Bavaria for a long time .
before that , they occurred in a legal grey area , as each of us probably knows .
it was difficult for him to guess where the people concerned were perhaps exagger@@ ated or dram@@ ati@@ zed , and where really the per@@ missible limit had been exceeded .
but you can &apos;t say that he always looked away .
this is simply not true .
only in 1980 , the test penalty for schools was officially abol@@ ished in Bavaria .
Princess Gl@@ oria of Th@@ urn and Tax@@ is claimed that it was un@@ fair to apply today &apos;s ped@@ agog@@ ical standards to the time at that time .
how do you see this ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : we histori@@ ans talk of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pit@@ fall of an@@ ach@@ ron@@ ism &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; that is , the danger of assess@@ ing the past according to today &apos;s moral standards . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the prin@@ cess is right . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but of course this does not apply to sexual abuse , which was ab@@ hor@@ red at all times , and not for what was broken in the pre @-@ school of ad@@ versity and violence against innocent children &apos;s sh@@ ri@@ mp@@ s , that goes far beyond the usual practice .
this is all horri@@ ble and I am happy that it will finally be re@@ worked .
but at the same time , I must take Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in protection , because all that had nothing to do with him .
his means of discipline and punishment , i.e. ear@@ phones and ears to draw , were widespread in the 1970s .
as physical punishment is forbidden , he has kept strictly adher@@ ed to .
&quot; &quot; &quot; which picture of his Rain@@ s@@ burger time has Georg R@@ atz@@ inger returned in the talks with you for the book &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; My Bro@@ ther of the Pope &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
did the subject of testing also come to speech ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : well , in the book it &apos;s about the life of his brother Joseph , i.e. Pope Benedi@@ ct XVI , tells from his perspective , there the cathedral @-@ cats played only one side role .
nevertheless , I did not at all deny that he carried out a strict reg@@ iment there .
but this must also be said once : without these perfec@@ tion@@ ism , without un@@ conditional discipline , it would hardly have been possible for him to form an institution of world tran@@ g , true cultural ambassador of Europe and his musical tradition , which went on tour twice in the USA ( 1983 and 1987 ) and Japan ( 1988 and 1991 ) .
with bis@@ cu@@ its and cand@@ y alone , one makes no big singers and stands before every success , regardless of what area , but always discipline , passion and self @-@ over@@ coming .
what kind of man did you experience Georg R@@ atz@@ inger during the talks about her book ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : through the work on the book and beyond , I really met Georg R@@ atz@@ inger and again and again experienced a wonderful , hum@@ orous , basic , deeply believing and heart@@ felt people , from which one can &apos;t imagine that he could only do a fly .
I get on a regular basis , like many former cathedral @-@ cats today , 23 years after his retirement , regularly visit him , visit him , read it - he is almost blind - and treat him as a member of her family .
those who have not for@@ given him until today that he was once strictly to them , are therefore clearly in the minority .
most of the cathedral @-@ cats today are thank@@ ful to him that he enri@@ ches her life and brought them to the world of music .
and that he is always a good , pat@@ ernal teacher - a strict father , certainly , that may be - but also a lov@@ able resp@@ ect@@ ful person , to which they still look up today and which they almost worship .
and please , once again clearly : all you submit to him are educational methods that were on the agenda at that time .
we can be glad that we have long ago overcome this time .
but it is most un@@ just , a man , just because he is prominent and has an even more prominent brother to make a medi@@ al sc@@ ap@@ eg@@ o@@ at .
there is the evil intent that is behind it , only too obvious .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the report that has just been published is reli@@ eved . &quot; &quot; &quot;
now the sei@@ z@@ ure would be , a 93 @-@ year @-@ old man , who has acquired great mer@@ its and without the outside of Bavaria and maybe even Germany nobody would probably know the Regensburg Dom@@ sp@@ atzen , finally to leave in peace .
