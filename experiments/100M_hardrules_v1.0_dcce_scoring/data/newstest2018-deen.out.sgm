<seg id="1">Munich 1856: four maps that change your view of the city</seg>
<seg id="2">An Irren-Anstalt, where youngsters meet today.</seg>
<seg id="3">A pit chapel, where it is dug for the S-Bahn tunnel.</seg>
<seg id="4">Small gardeners manage the former cause of peasants.</seg>
<seg id="5">The oldest official ticket Munich promotes exciting stories to days.</seg>
<seg id="6">It is annoying when maps are not up-to-date.</seg>
<seg id="7">Everybody knows everybody who had to wake up because the car-Navi showed a green meadow instead of a bypass road.</seg>
<seg id="8">The historical maps of the digital Bavaria Atlases, an offer of the Geoportas of the State Government, are anything but up-to-date - yet very revealing.</seg>
<seg id="9">Especially if you compare them with current online maps.</seg>
<seg id="10">Then it becomes clear how cities and municipalities in the area of the Munich Merkur have changed since the 19th century.</seg>
<seg id="11">The digital Bavaria-Atlas is a patchwork that one does not recognize as such.</seg>
<seg id="12">In the large picture postcard for cities and municipalities detailed maps, so-called documents, were incorporated.</seg>
<seg id="13">According to the Bayerical surveying administration between 1810 and 1864, they emerged from the first surveying of Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="14">Your client: Napoleon.</seg>
<seg id="15">The French military leader occupied Bavaria since spring 1800 during the Second Coalition War with Austria.</seg>
<seg id="16">Napoleon wanted an overview of the occupied country and gave a topographic recording of Bavaria in order - of course for military purposes.</seg>
<seg id="17">Even if the French troops were finally pulled off with the peace of Lunéville from 9 February 1801: it was the neighbors who created the idea of a surface-covering Bavaria card.</seg>
<seg id="18">Kurfürst Max IV. Joseph moved forward the project, founded the "Topographic Bureau" - and therewith the Bavarian Department of Measurement.</seg>
<seg id="19">The certificate of origin for Munich dates from 1856 and is found like any other on the website of the Bayerische Landesbibliothek.</seg>
<seg id="20">The comparison of former / Today is the most impressive in the example of the state capital.</seg>
<seg id="21">The city has expanded in all directions and has grown together.</seg>
<seg id="22">An example of this is subsendling that still appears relatively isolated in the map of 1856.</seg>
<seg id="23">Sendling was established 21 years after the map was created, i.e. in 1877, as the Munich district.</seg>
<seg id="24">Today, Untersendling is located in the middle of the city.</seg>
<seg id="25">The houses of Untersendling are concentrated around 1856 along today's Plinganserstraße, which was named after Georg Sebastian Plinganser in 1878, a leader of the uprising of the Bavarian farmers against Austria in 1705.</seg>
<seg id="26">"" "where today the Westpark is, you see nothing but fields - at first sight: there is a smaller map with dozens of lines and numbers: handwritten-numbered hallmarks from the so-called" "" "primitive take-up" "" "from which the basic income was derived." ""</seg>
<seg id="27">"" "small plots today show no farmers more - but small gardeners of the plant" "" "Land in Sun" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="28">A large green area is located north of Lower sendling.</seg>
<seg id="29">Theresienwiese, since 1810 of the Oktoberfest, was actually a meadow in the 19th century - and no concrete desert.</seg>
<seg id="30">On the other side of the Isar, the historical map provides an insight into the history of psychiatric medicine.</seg>
<seg id="31">"" "in the area of today's district, Au-Haidhausen, one reads not only the street name" "" "at the Gasteig" "" "or from the hill" "" "Auf der Lüfte" "" "- but also in big letters" "" "Irren Anstalt" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="32">Yes, here at Auerfeldstraße one once opened people with delusions.</seg>
<seg id="33">"" "there was in 1858 / 59 the Münchner Kreis-Irrenanstalt" "" "Auf der Auer Lüfte" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="34">From 1872 Dr. Bernhard von Gudden headed the institution - the psychiatrist, which is brought in connection with the death of King Ludwig II.</seg>
<seg id="35">"" "" "" "he was advanced for his time and ended for example the chains of so-called" "" "Irren." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="36">In addition, he has forbidden the personnel to apply violence against the inmates, "says Hermann Wilhelm, head of the Museum of Haidhausen, who has occupied himself for an exhibition with the institution.</seg>
<seg id="37">For 280 patients it was first place, later on 500 places was expanded.</seg>
<seg id="38">At some point, this capacity was no longer sufficient - the reason for the construction of the Kreisirrenanstalt in Haar 1905.</seg>
<seg id="39">Since 2006 the Isar-Amper-Klinikum München-Ost, one of the biggest psychiatries in Germany, has been there since 2006.</seg>
<seg id="40">In the area of the former Auer Anstalt, youngsters meet in the Salesianum in Munich.</seg>
<seg id="41">The Order acquired the building complex in 1920 and converted it into a youth hostel with educational establishments.</seg>
<seg id="42">West lies the football field of the TSV München Ost, east of residential buildings from the 1980s.</seg>
<seg id="43">"" "in 2015 the children's house" "" "Casa Don Bosco" "" "was built in an architectural style similar to the original" "" "Casa Don Bosco" "", "which had been destroyed during World War II by bombing attacks." ""</seg>
<seg id="44">"" "the Marienplatz was listed in 1856 as" "" "main place" "", "the Kaufinger Street name was called" "" "Kaufinger Gasse" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="45">A decisive change brought the Second World War also in the heart of Munich.</seg>
<seg id="46">The Allied bombs outlined many holes in the city center in December 1944.</seg>
<seg id="47">A big one remained until today - at the Marienhof.</seg>
<seg id="48">The English Institute, small business houses, and a chapel chapel dating back to the Middle Ages, once stood at the Marienhof, where these days were preceded and on April 5, 2017 the groundbreaking ceremony for the second S-Bahn regular route took place.</seg>
<seg id="49">With the slider, the old Munich-card can be compared with the aerial view of today - and fill the hole in the Marienhof.</seg>
<seg id="50">Ombudsman publishes travel warning for Missouri</seg>
<seg id="51">The National Association for the Promotion of Colors has issued a warning for coloured people who travel to Missouri because of discriminatory policies and racist attacks.</seg>
<seg id="52">"" "" "" "the NAACP Travel Advisory for the Federal State of Missouri, which will enter into force by August 28, 2017, calls for international travelers, visitors and Missouri to take special attention in traveling through the state, as a number of questionable, racial-based incidents occur in recent times throughout the country and be noted here," "" "says the Group's position." ""</seg>
<seg id="53">A recently adopted law of Missouri, which makes it harder for people to gain discrimination, as well as the prosecution authorities of the state, which disproportionately aim on minorities, prompted the group to issue the travel warning, said the NAACP.</seg>
<seg id="54">"" "" "" "they have violations of civil rights that happen to people." ""</seg>
<seg id="55">They are stopped because of their skin colour, they are beaten or killed, "said the President of Missouri NAACP, Rod Chapel, Kansas City Star.</seg>
<seg id="56">"" "" "" "we hear complaints in such a frequency that we have not yet heard." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="57">It is the first such warning that the organization has issued for a state in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="58">The group cited incidents like racist offences against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, 28, a black man from Tennessee.</seg>
<seg id="59">Sanders died under questionable circumstances at the beginning of the year, after he had no more fuel during the journey and was taken custody by the Missouri police without being accused of a crime.</seg>
<seg id="60">The Council also points to a recent report by the Missouri General Council, shown that black drivers in the state will be 75 percent more common than white.</seg>
<seg id="61">"the recommendation is that people are aware and inform their families, friends and staff about what could happen in Missouri," said Chapel.</seg>
<seg id="62">"" "" "" "people need to be willing to bring any chewing money or letting relatives know that they travel through the state." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="63">Missouri signed up to 100 hate crimes in 2015, according to the latest figures from the FBI's Hassverbrechens-Reports Programme, which classifies the state in terms of the number of injuries to the 16th rank of the country.</seg>
<seg id="64">The travel warning is also an answer to a new Missouri law that would make it harder to accuse a company for housing or employment discrimination.</seg>
<seg id="65">Earlier, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) issued travel warnings for Texas and Arizona, after the States had passed immigration laws to arrest local law enforcement agencies to arrest people for immigration reasons, which will contribute to further racial regulation.</seg>
<seg id="66">Travel warnings are usually issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for other countries, but recently, interest groups have used the measure as a response to certain laws and trends within the US.</seg>
<seg id="67">Weidezaunprojekt is elementary</seg>
<seg id="68">The Fischerbacher Weidezaun project is a success project and will continue in the coming year.</seg>
<seg id="69">The CDU Parliamentary Congressmen Peter Weiß and Kordula Kovac have acquired a picture on the spot.</seg>
<seg id="70">At the Hauptgrabenhof of the family Schwendemann, representatives of the Fischerbacher CDU local association met with mayor Thomas Schneider and the two MEPs.</seg>
<seg id="71">Markus Schwendemann initially granted insights into his farm in which he cultivated 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest, providing 40 dairy cows and as many young animals and houses in five apartments Feriengäste.</seg>
<seg id="72">"" "the" "" "Black Forest Milk" "" "is for him the alternative marketing path for the milk of his cows, so Schwendemann." ""</seg>
<seg id="73">On the table of the Feriengäste comes only Regionales.</seg>
<seg id="74">"" "since he is also the BLHV-chair of Fischerbach, he called the" "" "Elementary Important" "" "project as" "" "elementar important" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="75">I cannot prosper on such steep surfaces.</seg>
<seg id="76">The green area care for a lot of work, many things must be handled with the sense of the motor sense.</seg>
<seg id="77">"" "" "" "we have here to fight with the conditions and the topography," "" "said Schwendemann." ""</seg>
<seg id="78">In 2003, he took over the elternal operation and used this without chemical plant protection and fertilizer, even if he does not lead a bio-operation.</seg>
<seg id="79">"" "for Mayor Thomas Schneider, it was clear:" "" "the Commune recognised the importance of the" "" "Weidezaunprojekt" "" "and is happy about the leader promotion." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="80">At the cost of 3000 to 4000 euros per hectare the farmers would have to be supported.</seg>
<seg id="81">It is hoped that the solicitation of the surfaces could be extended for quite a while.</seg>
<seg id="82">"" "" "" "the greatest treasure we have is the people working in agriculture and thinking about how they continue their operations," "" "said the Mayor." ""</seg>
<seg id="83">"" "" "" "farmers often stand in criticism because of the promotion." ""</seg>
<seg id="84">Over the course of the course, a total of 25 plots were fenced by eleven participants in 2013.</seg>
<seg id="85">The total surface area amounts to 40 hectares, which are not allowed to be restricted by at least 2023.</seg>
<seg id="86">From the total cost of 71 500 euros, half were promoted through leader, a quarter contributed to the community of Fischerbach.</seg>
<seg id="87">Thus, the farmers remained 12 610 euros, which they had to invest in 16.2 kilometers of course.</seg>
<seg id="88">"the great advantage is the longevity of the fences," explained Schwendemann.</seg>
<seg id="89">"" "Kordula Kovac said:" "" "you do a really good job, without farmers and farmers" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="90">"" "also for Peter Weiß stand firm," "" "Here are the best food produced." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="91">The state-of-the-art landscape (LPR) Baden-Württemberg enables the state-of-the-art promotion of fences.</seg>
<seg id="92">The aim is to open the Black Forest.</seg>
<seg id="93">The prerequisite is the presence of a conveyor for the LPR.</seg>
<seg id="94">In addition, the fenced surface should not be sluggish (slope inclination above 35 percent) and must therefore be threatened by the solicitation.</seg>
<seg id="95">For the 2018 Fischerbacher Weidezaunprojekt 2018, the application of eight participants with 24 parcels, which would like to build just under 16 kilometres of fence.</seg>
<seg id="96">The total surface area corresponds to 35 hectares, the calculated costs are more than 112 000 euros.</seg>
<seg id="97">Is nothing sacred anymore?</seg>
<seg id="98">Now the White House of Trump occupies the Statue of Liberty</seg>
<seg id="99">The safest sign of a regime change is when they begin to attack the statues.</seg>
<seg id="100">The Americans appreciate these as well as any other - hence the thoughtful fall of Saddam Hussein at the Firon Square in Baghdad in 2003.</seg>
<seg id="101">Stephen Miller, one of the key ideologists of the Trump regime, certainly knew what he did when he took a symbolic axe in a heated argument with Jim Acosta of CNN about the presidents to drastically restrict legal immigration to the Statue of Liberty.</seg>
<seg id="102">To stay fair, Miller did not handle the statue itself.</seg>
<seg id="103">A horde of boat owners and Liberty beekeepers would have liked it if he had done it.</seg>
<seg id="104">But he took their meaning, and in particular the significance that it was attributed to when the famous poem by Emma Lazarus 1903, 17 years after completion of the monument, was added to his base.</seg>
<seg id="105">As Miller Acosta implied: "I don't want to go into a complete thing about history, but the Statue of Liberty is... a symbol of American freedom that illuminates the world.</seg>
<seg id="106">"" "the poem by which you refer to, which was added later and is not part of the original Statue of Liberty." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="107">Miller is factual right, but as he himself formulated it, it is not really about history.</seg>
<seg id="108">It is about the contemporary response to the angry words of Lazarus, the only ones in which a state does not only invite any old immigrants, but the poorest of the poor: "your troubles, your poor, and your oppressed masses, who longed to breathe freely, / the falling of your rich coasts."</seg>
<seg id="109">"" "there was never a time when the" "" "poor waste" "" "was better seen on our screens." ""</seg>
<seg id="110">Miller was not engaged in literary criticism - he made it clear that these people are not welcome in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="111">This conflict owing to the importance of a statue is part of a broader political and cultural dispute: it is indeed a conflict around the importance of America.</seg>
<seg id="112">Lazarus - and her friends who used to place their words after their death at the base - knew very well that they performed a highly political action.</seg>
<seg id="113">The sculpture was to show the connections between French and American republicanism by portraying the female embodiment of freedom in a worn-out classical depiction.</seg>
<seg id="114">Lazarus changed this meaning: in her poem the female figure is no longer abstract - she has received a voice.</seg>
<seg id="115">And she gives herself a very different name: mother of the Exile.</seg>
<seg id="116">The link between the poem and the image is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on American Nativism.</seg>
<seg id="117">And just like Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, the people from the right wing wanted to change it for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="118">The great writer Rush Limbaugh, a kind of John the Baptist for the coming of Trump, argues 2010 that the Statue of Liberty is no one drawer but rather an early Neoconservatives that brings the American flame to the umbered world: "Lady Liberty moves forward.</seg>
<seg id="119">It should bear the torch of freedom from the United States into the rest of the world.</seg>
<seg id="120">"" "the torch should not enlighten the way to the United States." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="121">Limbaugh is quite unusual here.</seg>
<seg id="122">The importance of the statue is entirely and even a question of the standpoint of perception.</seg>
<seg id="123">The great creative act of Lazarus was to see her as she was seen by the exhaustive but hopeful people after long and often terrible journeys to the decks of ships.</seg>
<seg id="124">It is the true sense of seeing the world from the perspective of people who seek refuge and a chance to improve their lives.</seg>
<seg id="125">Her statue speaks to them the words of hope and the welcome they have to hear.</seg>
<seg id="126">And this is of course not the perspective that Miller and Trump will ever recognize.</seg>
<seg id="127">Their torch shall not enlighten the way, but the hatred which is their only source of power.</seg>

<seg id="137">And also with the type on the corner.</seg>
<seg id="138">Whatever the combination of circumstances is, it is absolutely brilliant. "</seg>
<seg id="139">Several of the Scottish athletes are Medaillen candidates, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart, who compete against Sir Mo Farah on the 5,000 m track, while Eilidh Doyle was elected by the team to team captain.</seg>
<seg id="140">"Eilidh is rather modest.</seg>
<seg id="141">"" "her captain's speech was incredible," "" "says Black." ""</seg>
<seg id="142">"a number of athletes, whether they were Scottish or wherever they live or train, went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motivated.</seg>
<seg id="143">The passion and the real feeling that Eilidh came naturally, were great. "</seg>
<seg id="144">The Commonwealth Silver medal winner, who will compete in their fifth world championships at the 400 m hurdles, says that it is "unbelievable" that 16 Scots are in the British team.</seg>
<seg id="145">Scotland's so far best total of athletes at the World Championship was seven, which were achieved in 1983 and 2015.</seg>
<seg id="146">The middle-distance runner Muir leads on this road and has set up five British and two European records last year.</seg>

<seg id="156">Yes, I think it went well.</seg>
<seg id="157">I only pointed out that we are very happy in this situation as we have a home world championship.</seg>

<seg id="160">Blockade Criticism on Facebook: don't worry about a public office if you cannot tolerate voters</seg>
<seg id="161">The father of our country knew something of bad press.</seg>
<seg id="162">The Americans loved George Washington, but it did not take long until the newspapers struck him because of everything, from domestic politics to his political principles.</seg>
<seg id="163">He implied with criticism.</seg>
<seg id="164">But he has not silenced his critics.</seg>
<seg id="165">"" "for in 1783, Washington said:" "" "freedom of speech can be taken away - and, stupid and mute we are led like sheep to the slaughter." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="166">This brings me to Maryland to Governor Larry Hogan, who must work to be more like Washington.</seg>
<seg id="167">Hogans collaborators have blocked and deleted posts of at least 450 people who have expressed their opinion on their official Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="168">And the American Civil Liberties Union defended it this week.</seg>
<seg id="169">The Governor's staff dismissed the lawsuit as frivolous, and the online comment was full of a counter-reaction with "Na, and?."</seg>
<seg id="170">"it's just Facebook," many people said.</seg>
<seg id="171">But it is important.</seg>
<seg id="172">And it is especially important when it is a type like Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="173">This is a Republican governor in an overwhelming democratic state, which is amazingly popular.</seg>
<seg id="174">He has the second highest consent of the 50 governors of the nation.</seg>
<seg id="175">Hogan is not a reactionary Hitzhead.</seg>
<seg id="176">He has shown a firm hand in the leadership of his state and strict adherence to the principles.</seg>
<seg id="177">He was also very cleverly to use Facebook as a primary means to connect with his voters and to debate his hairy head after chemotherapy on his side.</seg>
<seg id="178">Therefore the blockage of persons who come to the Governor's side - is a public forum that is designated as officially and by employees who are paid with public tax dollars - unnecessary and ultimately dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="179">In an interview with The Washington Post, Hogans answered Amelia Chasse the governor's actions and argued that the blockage of comments is nothing more than moderation.</seg>
<seg id="180">But it is too easy to use the image of castors or braces or hate-filled people who vibrate online the whip.</seg>
<seg id="181">The post was talking to some of the real people blocked by Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="182">And these are only real people speaking with their elected leaders: a teacher, an entrepreneur, and a priest, no role.</seg>
<seg id="183">They all said their comments were respectful, thoughtful and not profane.</seg>
<seg id="184">The priest cited the Bible in his post and appealed to Hogans Catholic faith.</seg>
<seg id="185">Attorney Lakshmi Sarma Ramani of Bowie, Md., was not hated, but she asked for hate crimes.</seg>
<seg id="186">"" "" "" "I politely commented that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to hate crimes and other news," "" "she wrote in the commentary section of the news agency" "" "The Post." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="187">"" "" "" "I don't appreciate this idea if a number of people take a position on the same issue, then they are considered by some rather than a so-called collective employment and not recognized as a large group of affected citizens." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="188">"" "what the Governor's employees referred to as" "" "concentrated spam attack" "" "would probably call" "" "intercession." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="189">The Facebook era makes it easy to crop a message by simply blocking a critic or deleting a negative comment.</seg>
<seg id="190">It is much cleaner than in earlier times when one had done the same thing that employees were sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical editorials and to arrest or arrest protesters and to silence.</seg>
<seg id="191">But this is exactly what happens digitally.</seg>
<seg id="192">Hogan is not the first public official to criticise Facebook and other social media.</seg>
<seg id="193">President Trump is filed by Twitter users blocked by his Twitter feed.</seg>
<seg id="194">One of the first milestones in this issue fell last week in Virginia.</seg>
<seg id="195">The Chairman of the Board of Supervisors des Loudoun County injured the First Amendment, according to US District Judge James C. Cacheris in Alexandria, when they banned a voter from their Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="196">And in Kentucky, governor Matt Bevin (R) also received a visit from ACLU because of his use of Facebook and Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="197">This should not be so difficult.</seg>
<seg id="198">At the time of Washington, the time of affordable doormen had a similar effect as the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="199">The number of papers varied between 1776 and 1800, and anonymous corresponders put on his leadership.</seg>
<seg id="200">And even then, Washington had anonymous trolls.</seg>
<seg id="201">The people who used pseudonyms like "Juricola," "Valerius," "Belisarius" and "Portius," wrote all letters to newspapers that made Washington's decisions.</seg>
<seg id="202">Petitions that criticized his point of view of the treaty of amity, trade and shipping with Britain were overwhelmed by the historical documents that were collected by the online papers of George Washington Project.</seg>
<seg id="203">But he has not brought them to silence.</seg>
<seg id="204">Freedom of speech, disagreement and discourses belong to our nation.</seg>

<seg id="435">If a Model 3 is ordered today, at the earliest in the second half of 2018, the delivery can be expected - if Tesla manages to drive his brand-new, never-tested production lines without any major interruptions with maximum capacity utilization.</seg>

<seg id="466">750 years of St. Hilarius church: on the occasion of the Jubilee of the Bergkirche, the old cemetery site in Tumlingen will be invited to a serenade at 16: 30 pm.</seg>

<seg id="470">"" "Walter Martini points out:" "" "it's a unique village gem." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="471">In 1267 the St. Hilariuskapelle was first mentioned in the Württembergian dictionary: count Hermann von Sulz sold the mountain with the parish church to Tumlingen and the Vogtei "at Magister Eberhard von Horb and his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark Silver.</seg>
<seg id="472">According to the wording of the document, on the Tumlinger mountain, besides the former parish church, besides the former parish church, there was also a magnificent courtyard, to which the church or the patron saint belonged and not the other way round.</seg>
<seg id="473">So there were also people there.</seg>
<seg id="474">As seen from the description of the Oberamtes Freudenstadt of 1858, it was next to the Unterdorf and the Oberdorf, which are still visible in the village of tumulus, the "mountain" of the third, the splendid settlement core of the village.</seg>
<seg id="475">Old maps from the time around the year 1600 confirm these historical circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="476">The right of patronage originated from the early medieval owner's right.</seg>
<seg id="477">A gentleman who built a church, furnished and occupied with a priest, still remained the owner of this church and could also inherit this owner's church.</seg>
<seg id="478">This entails the right to use a priest or propose a new pastor to the bishop.</seg>
<seg id="479">There were three altars in the church and two bells on the tower.</seg>
<seg id="480">The Greater of the two were barren at Christmas 1673.</seg>
<seg id="481">The newly created bell rang out for the first time in 1692, but had to be released in 1942 during the Second World War.</seg>
<seg id="482">In the 30-year-old war (1616 to 1648) the windows were inserted and the bells were stolen.</seg>
<seg id="483">The roof was leaky.</seg>
<seg id="484">In 1796 French forces encamped in the vicinity of the church.</seg>
<seg id="485">They removed the pulpit and church chairs and used them as firewood.</seg>

<seg id="487">Until 1869, the Tumlinger Hilarius cemetery served as last resting place for the dead from Hörschweiler.</seg>
<seg id="488">In 1823 the cemetery was extended and the Hilariuskirche was demolished.</seg>
<seg id="489">Only the church tower was left.</seg>
<seg id="490">During the New Year's night in 1834, a storm divided the church tower and half overthrew.</seg>

<seg id="507">It is unlawful.</seg>
<seg id="508">The association argues that at the time of homologation on December 30, 2016, no wind turbines could have been approved, since at the time in Viersen only at the city border to Schwalmtal has existed a wind power concentration zone.</seg>
<seg id="509">Within this concentration zone, the construction and operation of wind turbines are generally possible, but at the same time the concentration area causes the exclusion of wind energy use for the rest of the city.</seg>
<seg id="510">Such zones should prevent a "sparing" of the landscape.</seg>

<seg id="521">Last year, the company, in which the city Viersen was indirectly involved, has closed lease agreements with the owner of approximately 65 hectares of land.</seg>
<seg id="522">With the construction of the four wind turbines, the power requirement of around 11 400 households should be covered - this corresponds to approximately one-fifth of the electricity requirement of all four-sener households.</seg>
<seg id="523">The NEW Re wants to invest some 20 million euros.</seg>

<seg id="908">The building is scheduled for October and Lightweight is sure the schedule is respected.</seg>
<seg id="909">The first bridge, coming from Schramberg, leads across the Trombach.</seg>
<seg id="910">It is a rainbow bridge made of concrete, which is covered with red Buntsandstein and has a total length of 4.80 metres.</seg>
<seg id="911">It was built in 1900.</seg>
<seg id="912">Like the two other bridges, it has now come into the years.</seg>

<seg id="922">The other two bridges are already equipped with the patented bridge caps.</seg>
<seg id="923">Particular finger-tip feeling has required the laying of cables through the building in Lauterbach.</seg>
<seg id="924">Because there is also a fiber cable connected to which many companies are connected.</seg>
<seg id="925">The residents were informed about the project in advance of the work.</seg>
<seg id="926">In addition, fish and crustaceans had to be cut off at first.</seg>

<seg id="1121">How to affect the financial rules of football on Neymars relocation to Paris</seg>
<seg id="1122">The rules aimed at preventing uninterrupted issues of European football clubs will not disturb Neymars's world record transfer from Barcelona to the French Paris-Saint Germain.</seg>
<seg id="1123">Any consequences will come to Paris Saint-Germain of UEFA, as the guiding organisation that supervises the European game has the power to ban teams from access to the prestigious Champions League tournament.</seg>
<seg id="1124">Financial fair play rules launched in 2011 by the UEFA mean that at some point it must prove that the transfer of Neymar was financed without major losses.</seg>
<seg id="1125">Barcelona has paid 222 million euros (262 million dollars) to extract the Brazilian from its contract, and Neymar will receive a salary that will amount to tens of tens of millions of dollars a year.</seg>
<seg id="1126">Here are some of the financial aspects of Neymars's move to France.</seg>
<seg id="1127">PSG can make the money loose, so that Neymar will sign and bring him into a galaxy of other stars, given the financing of the team by the power-rich family of Qatar.</seg>
<seg id="1128">"" "" "" "clubs may spend a lot of money on the acquisition of players, but they have to counteract legitimate revenue streams, which allow them to take the break-even point in their football-related business." ""</seg>
<seg id="1129">FFP was designed by Michel Platini after his election to the UEFA President in 2007.</seg>
<seg id="1130">The former French player believed that clubs, who had taken enormous debt in their quest for success, were effectively deceiving and risking to ruin if banks or owners withdrew their support.</seg>
<seg id="1131">In 2011, FFP shifted from concentrating on the debt of clubs on the monitoring of their losses.</seg>
<seg id="1132">The change meant that the business model that novel Abramovich bought in Chelsea in 2003 - bought a club with potential and then invested heavily to improve the team and build a global brand - becoming a harder task.</seg>
<seg id="1133">During the current three-year FFP-shift period, which runs until 2018, clubs can accept losses in the amount of 30 million euros.</seg>
<seg id="1134">And even though Platini has fallen from the presidency in 2015, his UEFA successor Aleksander Ceferin continues to frighten excessive spending.</seg>
<seg id="1135">"" "" "" "surely FFP is not dead and we will strengthen the rules for the future," "" "said Andrea Traverso, who is responsible for the UEFA for FFP, compared to The Associated Press in the past week." ""</seg>
<seg id="1136">Although the PSG has paid the Buy-out clause of Neymar in a package, it can distribute the amount for invoicing over the duration of his contract.</seg>
<seg id="1137">Neymar has signed a five-year contract so that the revenue streams for the next five years can be reported in the amount of 44.1 million euros in the financial statements.</seg>
<seg id="1138">The first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014, together with Abu Dhabi, which is owned by Manchester City, has hit the heaviest sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="1139">The PSG received a fine of 60 million Euros (82 million dollars), which was later reduced to €20 million - and it was arranged that the team members for the Champions League of the 2014 / 15 season will be limited to 21 players instead of the usual 25 players.</seg>
<seg id="1140">UEFA is looking for clubs that could try to supersect their financial supervision by blending their income through companies connected with the owners of a club.</seg>
<seg id="1141">While a cataric company might sponsor the PSG if the value of sponsorship should exceed the standard market rates, UEFA would not be considered legitimate income.</seg>
<seg id="1142">This was exactly what happened in 2014 when the UEFA decided that the value of the sponsorship of the PSA was inflated by the Qatar Tourism Authority.</seg>
<seg id="1143">It was reported that a part of the PSG payments to Neymar could come to Qatar about payments of the World Cup 2022.</seg>
<seg id="1144">But PSG and Qatar 2022 have argued that Neymar World Cup ambassadors will be and could easily find out such a manoeuvre for the UEFA regulators.</seg>
<seg id="1145">The previous sanctions against PSG involve that UEFA will be more attentive to observing each attempt to circumvent the rules.</seg>
<seg id="1146">The UEFA had no preparatory discussions with PSG via Neymars Transfer, on Thursday the people familiar with the situation.</seg>
<seg id="1147">They talked about the condition of anonymity with The Associated Press, as they were not authorized to discuss the PSG situation.</seg>
<seg id="1148">The latest published reports show that PSG 2015 / 16 achieved a profit of more than 10 million euros with a turnover of €542.4 million.</seg>
<seg id="1149">Accounts for the last fiscal year must be published.</seg>
<seg id="1150">PSG anticipates that Neymars arrival is a blessing for sponsoring deals, merchandising and tricot selling.</seg>
<seg id="1151">The association assumes that sales after the signature will rise by at least 30 percent.</seg>
<seg id="1152">The Spanish League was clearly irritated to see one of the best football players, and she tried to prevent Neymars pulling away by claiming that PSG would hurt the FFP.</seg>

<seg id="1185">As a cultural artifact, it is equally a parody and embodiment of our Facebook-capable era permanent memories.</seg>

<seg id="1190">At one point, a character has a character through an Apple Powerbook, some inline skates and "a number of other things from 1991."</seg>

<seg id="1198">"Comrade Detective" on Amazon now remembers a different type of nostalgia: to revitalize the Cold War of "The Americans," to the film "Atomic Blonde" and even to "GLOW" with its East against West ring-war iconography.</seg>

<seg id="1201">It is a brilliant idea.</seg>

<seg id="1205">But "Comrade Detective" is so much involved in the truthfulness of a desperate propaganda drama - a murderer who carries a Reagan mask, is involved - that it often plays like one.</seg>
<seg id="1206">There are six long episodes, and the comedy is not fast or frequent enough.</seg>
<seg id="1207">"Comrade Detective," which was reacted to a lower length could better deliver his agitprop satire, since Gregor and Iosef always attend the American embassy, whose lobby is always occupied by two thick men who devour a bunch of hamburgers.</seg>

<seg id="1317">Living the big living: mezzanine and clever designer tricks have transformed this small Earls Court apartment into a spacious home</seg>
<seg id="1318">Joanne Leigh, a former banker with a passion for real estate, shrunk in 2014 from a big house in Knightsbridge to an Earls Court apartment.</seg>
<seg id="1319">It is located on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne Terrace - and it's a proof of the new design that Joanne has not packed her bags and sold her bags.</seg>
<seg id="1320">"before that, I lived with my ex in Knightsbridge in a much larger space," says Joanne.</seg>
<seg id="1321">"" "" "" "I looked for something comparable to my price." ""</seg>
<seg id="1322">I was shown this apartment in Earls Court and she had the same high ceilings.</seg>
<seg id="1323">"" "I fell in love with them and made an offer this day." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1324">Since the first inspection, the 1,000 square feet of the apartment was completely overhauled.</seg>
<seg id="1325">Originally a one-room property with a nested layout - you had to go through the kitchen to get into the bedroom - wanted to add Joanne storage space and a mezzanine to optimally use the spacious ceiling height.</seg>
<seg id="1326">"I wanted high ceilings, large windows, lots of light.</seg>
<seg id="1327">That was my requirement, "she says.</seg>
<seg id="1328">For this purpose, she commissioned the Architectural and Designstudio Duck & Shed of Erfan Azadi from Notting Hill, to make use of 12.5 foot high ceilings and to create a home that was not just a development, but also a place to live for joanne.</seg>
<seg id="1329">The ceiling was not big enough to place two rooms over one another so that the architectural challenge consisted of creating an intermediate floor in which one could stand.</seg>
<seg id="1330">Erfan had to think creative in order to resolve the issue.</seg>
<seg id="1331">"" "" "" "the steel structure is quite complicated," "" "he explains." ""</seg>
<seg id="1332">"" "" "" "we had to arrange the rooms so that they were stacked on one another without having to bite." ""</seg>
<seg id="1333">"" "it was not only about building a simple platform, but creating the steel so that it had the right height for the function above or down." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1334">This arrangement enabled Erfan to place two rooms at full height - with much additional drama.</seg>
<seg id="1335">For the mezzanine, a classic copper light window from Retrouvius looks down over the glamorous living area.</seg>
<seg id="1336">Mirrored gold furniture, silver accents and vintage Serge Mouille lighting set the style for the program.</seg>
<seg id="1337">The use of mirrors plays a role in adding theatre, space and light.</seg>
<seg id="1338">At both ends a short corridor is mirrored to make it work longer.</seg>
<seg id="1339">In the kitchen the mirroring feels like a window into another room.</seg>
<seg id="1340">At the entrance, mirrored units provide space for all cutlery and jars of Joanne.</seg>
<seg id="1341">Through the perception of a glamorous space, the beauty of the living room can close the kitchen when it is not used.</seg>
<seg id="1342">Foldable kitchens are nothing new.</seg>
<seg id="1343">The special thing about this is that it is a garage door.</seg>
<seg id="1344">"" "" "" "a bit of engineering went in," "" "explains Erfan from the steel-reinforced, veneered MDF door." ""</seg>
<seg id="1345">"" "" "" "it is important, so if you push the door, very easily glides." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1346">Thanks to the clever use of space and storage space, Joanne could gain additional 16 m ², an additional bedroom and an improved layout.</seg>
<seg id="1347">"at the end of the day you will sell the land - or how your property is appreciated," says Erfan.</seg>
<seg id="1348">"" "" "" "in a rudimentary form a real estate agent will enter and perform a calculation based on the ground size." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1349">Here they have managed to enlarge the floor space while at the same time use high-quality materials that give the space its luxurious advantage.</seg>

<seg id="1351">"" "" "" "you don't love the electrical sockets in the walls." ""</seg>
<seg id="1352">These are important, but they do not play with your heart. "</seg>

<seg id="1357">The former director of the 'Carlton Football Club' and developer Colin De LUTIS lives in a villa in Toorak, only three doors from his younger brother Paul. he brought him to the Supreme Court to clarify how to divide their property and their assets.</seg>
<seg id="1358">Paul wanted to withdraw from family business since 2014, but a sharp debate on the separation takes place in the Supreme Court.</seg>
<seg id="1359">Together with her mother Anna, the brothers have acquired 38 properties worth more than half a billion dollars, since the 1973 family purchased a business in Smith Street, Collingwood.</seg>
<seg id="1360">There the family Westco jeans founded jeans and grew to a chain of 160 retail stores.</seg>
<seg id="1361">It was sold for 85 million US dollars in 1999.</seg>
<seg id="1362">This money has been invested in real estate, and the portfolio of De LUTIS now includes offices in the city center, the development areas of Brunswick and Sorrento, the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Buller as well as shopping centers in the suburbs.</seg>

<seg id="1368">The Brothers are now fighting for control of the existing business - including Colin, as Paul claims to have ruled him.</seg>
<seg id="1369">Colin argues that this is not true, but rejects Paul to manage some possessions incompetent.</seg>

<seg id="1372">The cost increases in the case, with hundreds of pages with affirmations, emails and reports of companies, including Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer, and with leading lawyers, including Allan Myers, QC, and both parties held by law firms.</seg>
<seg id="1373">Mrs. De LUTIS and her husband-husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who operated milk bars and delicacies from the late 1950s and bought a store in Brunswick in the early 1970s.</seg>
<seg id="1374">They used the security to buy the Collingwood Property in which Colin opened the first jeans of the family.</seg>
<seg id="1375">Colin says that he started Westco there when he was "in my last years of high school when Paul was still a little child (about 10 years old)."</seg>

<seg id="1391">If so, he will be the first.</seg>
<seg id="1392">POLITICO reports that the new Chief of Staff of White House plans to restrict the flow of information to President Trump - including the news media reports - hoping to hold the boss on a more uniform course.</seg>
<seg id="1393">Here is a piece of reporter Josh Dawsey:</seg>
<seg id="1394">"" "" "" "when John F.

<seg id="1395">Kelly said to the staff that information should flow through him - whether on paper or in briefings - because the president would make better decisions if he would receive good information. "</seg>
<seg id="1396">Kellys diagnosis makes sense, but others have tried to tame Trump by monitoring his media density.</seg>
<seg id="1397">President Trumps's relationship to television dates back decades - and now, where he is in the White House, his televisions are still strong.</seg>
<seg id="1398">"if candidate Trump was angry for unfair coverage, it was productive to show him that he received a fair reporting of places that were to convince," said the former electoral adviser Sam Nunberg in February opposite Politico.</seg>

<seg id="1403">We will probably never know anything about the tweets that Trump did not send.</seg>
<seg id="1404">If his collaborators have managed to keep away from him several times, then their efforts have been worth it.</seg>
<seg id="1405">But no one has consistently been able to prevent Trump controverts.</seg>
<seg id="1406">A part of the problem is that people in a White House, which consists of competing parties, try again and again to present their own agenda by presenting Trump Material that may promote their views from the world.</seg>
<seg id="1407">POLITICO - dedicated to this story - reported in May about the predilection of the advisors to provide doubtful information to the President for strategic reasons.</seg>
<seg id="1408">This was an example described by Reporter Shane Goldmacher:</seg>
<seg id="1409">"" "" "" "up-to-date and former Trump officials say that Trump is able to react like a volcano to negative press excerpts, above all those with damaging leaks, and that he will find out where they come from." ""</seg>
<seg id="1410">Exactly this happened at the end of February when someone gave the president malicious printed copy of an article of GotNews.com, the web site of Internet provocateurs Charles C. Johnson, who accused the deputy commander Katie Walsh, "to be the source behind a heap of leaks" in the White House.</seg>
<seg id="1411">Although Johnson was permanently banned from Twitter for shikes, or that he did not offer any concrete evidence or that he had false allegations in the past and revoke her.</seg>
<seg id="1412">"" "Trump read the article and began to ask staff about Walsh." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1413">Goldmacher added that the then Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and the Secretary-General of the White House, Rob Porter, "tried to implement a system in order to manage and document the paperwork and document the dump."</seg>
<seg id="1414">How did that work?</seg>
<seg id="1415">Kelly tries to do the same three months later.</seg>
<seg id="1416">Perhaps he will prove to be an effective manager as a priebus, but Trump is still his impulsive self, and his advisors are still seeking influence.</seg>

<seg id="1522">With 175 kilometres of length and a width of up to 50 kilometres, it is one of the largest ice-eaters who have registered researchers over the past three decades.</seg>
<seg id="1523">There is no danger for man from him.</seg>
<seg id="1524">To what extent climate change has played a role in the departure of the iceberg, is unclear after research data.</seg>
<seg id="1525">However, for some 30 years there have been a series of unusual gatherings of ice-stuffs in the region, writes the U.S. research center for snow and ice (NSIDC) in a background.</seg>
<seg id="1526">According to many researchers, this could be related to global warming.</seg>
<seg id="1527">The now broken colossus was a part of the Larsen-C-Schelfeis until now.</seg>
<seg id="1528">Schelfeis floats on the sea and is fed by large glaciers.</seg>
<seg id="1529">It continues to grow into the sea and breaks out regularly.</seg>
<seg id="1530">The Larsen-C-Schelfeis is located south of South America almost at the top of the Antarctic Peninsula.</seg>
<seg id="1531">To the north of this Schelmish, the balance of waxes and disruptions was disrupted some years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1532">A complete Schelfeis is broken there, writes AWI researcher Daniela Jansen.</seg>
<seg id="1533">There is a lot about the fact that the Larsen-C Schelfeis is in danger, as the front edge has never withdrawn as far as currently.</seg>
<seg id="1534">In addition, the ice sheet stands under stress and can crumble if a piece is broken down at a key point.</seg>
<seg id="1535">The melting of Schelfeis and Eisberg does not increase sea level as they float on the water and displace as much water as it yields after melting itself.</seg>
<seg id="1536">However, the loss of gravity leads to the fact that the glaciers can flow directly into the sea and flow much faster than before.</seg>
<seg id="1537">This could possibly increase sea level, but only in a small extent, the British research project for the observation of Antarctica (Midas).</seg>
<seg id="1538">According to AWI data, the Larsen-C-Schelfeis is the fourth biggest shrinker of Antarctica with nearly 50 000 square kilometres.</seg>
<seg id="1539">At the crossing from the mainland, it is up to 700 meters thick, at the front edge to the free ocean approximately 200 meters.</seg>
<seg id="1540">There it breaks out regularly.</seg>
<seg id="1541">"" "" "" "although it is a natural phenomenon and has no direct connection to climate change, the ice shield now comes into a more dangerous position," "" "said Martin O'Leary from British Swansea University." ""</seg>
<seg id="1542">"" "" "" "this is the longest withdrawal since the beginning of records," "" "he also confirmed." ""</seg>
<seg id="1543">Among scientists, it is controversial whether the Larsen-C Schelfeis will grow back or go back in the long term and possibly collapse, said his colleague Adrian Luckman and added: "our models say it will be less stable."</seg>
<seg id="1544">But this development will last decades.</seg>
<seg id="1545">Even though these researchers are not returning to climate change this gigantic iceberg has fallen apart in recent decades, however, many mischiefs of the Antarctic Peninsula have fallen apart.</seg>
<seg id="1546">This long ridge of Antarctica extends towards South America.</seg>
<seg id="1547">According to data of the research program British Antarctic Survey, the ice surface of the Antarctic Peninsula has decreased by 28 000 square kilometres since the 1950s.</seg>
<seg id="1548">The decline in temperature has contributed to the decline.</seg>
<seg id="1549">The Antarctic Peninsula has grown up around three degrees in the last 50 years and thus tamed to the areas in which the temperature rises the fastest.</seg>
<seg id="1550">CDU wants pets in staff</seg>
<seg id="1551">Because it becomes increasingly difficult to occupy vacant positions, the CDU calls on the employers' association to become more attractive.</seg>
<seg id="1552">Only shortly before the summer break, the Creistag has established 41 new jobs in the administration.</seg>
<seg id="1553">More than 1100 employees and officials work for the county administration in Mettmann.</seg>
<seg id="1554">Now 17 apprentices have their first working day behind them.</seg>
<seg id="1555">The teachers at the circle are obviously very sought-after.</seg>
<seg id="1556">Around 620 applications were to be recorded for the places surrounding this year.</seg>
<seg id="1557">Nevertheless, the circle is still lacking personnel to cope with the increased requirements and tasks.</seg>
<seg id="1558">At present there are still 50 not occupied places in the Mettmann district.</seg>
<seg id="1559">Among other things, doctors and engineers, as well as forces of general administration, are sought.</seg>
<seg id="1560">The CDU is now attempting to take the initiative together with the FDP and UWG and to relieve the shortage of skilled workers in the administration.</seg>
<seg id="1561">"" "according to the wish of the parties, administration is to develop a concept for human resources and personnel development." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1562">The goal is not only to cover short-term requirements for skilled workers, but to counteract the future-oriented application shortage, it is said.</seg>
<seg id="1563">The overall concept should orientate itself internally and externally, show concrete measures for transformer members and include an education offensive, CDU, FDP and UWG.</seg>
<seg id="1564">This sounds like a good approach.</seg>
<seg id="1565">Because the circle has to do with personnel problems you did not know before.</seg>
<seg id="1566">Other cities advertise good officials and employees and offer more attractive conditions.</seg>
<seg id="1567">"" "the speech is of a regular" "" "competition of public employers" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1568">In addition, a high number of employees, the disease or age-related, comes from the service.</seg>
<seg id="1569">Thus, the highest amount of time for action, so that no more jobs will remain unoccupied.</seg>
<seg id="1570">But Klaus-Dieter peoples, leader of the CDU spokesperson, goes beyond the joint request with his party.</seg>
<seg id="1571">He had long ago in the Kremistag for a fist surprise when he publicly questioned the personnel costs and the other parties were astonished.</seg>
<seg id="1572">People want all possibilities to be verified that allow a withdrawal from the local employers' association.</seg>
<seg id="1573">"" "" "" "if we do not come to a satisfactory solution here at short notice, the county administration should seek a pet with the trade unions - perhaps even in cooperation with the surrounding towns - a pet" "", "so people." ""</seg>
<seg id="1574">In doing so, the CDU tried to better pay the employees and officials than it actually foresees tariffs for the public service.</seg>
<seg id="1575">The salaries are currently accurately pre-written, increases or more money there is only when you move to a higher stage oriented towards professional years.</seg>
<seg id="1576">But the tasks of the circle have grown more and more in recent years.</seg>
<seg id="1577">Only a few weeks ago, new rooms had to be set up in which employees take care of the provisions of the new Prostitute Protection Act.</seg>
<seg id="1578">Last but not least due to the increasing number of asylum seekers, Landrat Thomas Hendele and Kreisdirektor Martin Richter have a problem: they have too little staff.</seg>
<seg id="1579">Italy aggravates the tone to NGOs' migrants' rescue boats</seg>
<seg id="1580">"" "" "" "Italy has warned NGOs who use lifeboats for migrants in the Mediterranean, warned that they should not continue this if they do not comply with new rules for their operations." ""</seg>
<seg id="1581">"" "" "" "if NGOs do not sign a new code of conduct, it is difficult to see how they can continue" "", "said Minister of Interior Marco Minniti in an interview with the Turin daily La Stampa." ""</seg>
<seg id="1582">Minniti's warning came one day after the Italian authorities had seized a boat from the German aid organisation 'Youth Save' because their team had worked together effectively with traffickers in a way that facilitated illegal immigration.</seg>
<seg id="1583">The relief organization, which has only been in operation for one year, refused to express itself in detailed accusations of the Italian prosecutor Ambrogio Cartosio.</seg>
<seg id="1584">"" "" "" "we are very sorry that we cannot operate in the search and rescue zone at the moment," "" "said the organization in a statement on social media." ""</seg>

<seg id="1586">"" "the Italian authorities had watched the boat from" "" "Youth Rettet," "" "which was supervised by Iuventa since October." ""</seg>
<seg id="1587">It is thought that the crew will take dinghy migrants aboard, which are delivered directly by men's traders and that the smugglers can depart, so that the ships can be used again.</seg>
<seg id="1588">At least one such meeting was allegedly only 1,3 miles off the Libyan coast, according to the prosecutor's file, whose content was published by Italian media.</seg>
<seg id="1589">The occupation is suspected of taking over the authority of the Italian Coast Guard, the rescue missions in the zone for humanitarian reasons and not from any other motives.</seg>
<seg id="1590">Under the Code of Conduct, boats such as the Iuventa must mainly have an Italian police officer who supervises their activities.</seg>
<seg id="1591">Only three of the nine NGOs who are involved in search and rescue operations have previously agreed to abide by the code: save the Children, MOAS from Malta and Pro-Activa Open Arms from Spain.</seg>
<seg id="1592">"" "the latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be considered unnecessarily, but acceptable as they would not bring any" "" "major changes or disabilities" "" "to their rescue operations." ""</seg>
<seg id="1593">Among those who refuse to sign are the Nobel Prize Winner Organisation Doctors Without Borders (MSF).</seg>
<seg id="1594">"" "" "" "Minniti now said that the number of migrants who arrived in Italy after the rescue measures had declined strongly in recent weeks, indicating that efforts to strengthen the Libyan coast guard and cooperation with local mayors have borne fruit." ""</seg>
<seg id="1595">"" "" "" "in the last days we began to see light at the end of the tunnel," "" "said the Minister." ""</seg>
<seg id="1596">He announced plans for further talks with Libyan citizens in this month about economic development initiatives and with Chad, Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants who leave these countries in hope to reach Europe.</seg>
<seg id="1597">Ascents and Trials</seg>
<seg id="1598">Nine Weilerers Biker, the "Berliner Outdoor Outpost" and two guest drivers met in Wachenheim in the northern Palatinate to enjoy Trials and Sights for four days.</seg>
<seg id="1599">Three befriended guides were available for this.</seg>
<seg id="1600">The accommodation in the Wachenheimer valley proved to be a good starting point for the tours.</seg>
<seg id="1601">The Burgundy and Weinfest of Wachenheim was a welcome extra.</seg>
<seg id="1602">The first tour led to hot summer temperatures along the vineyards to the Michaelskapelle just above Deidesheim.</seg>
<seg id="1603">There were viewpoints, partly on towers, from which one could look far over the Pfälzer Wald and the upstream planes.</seg>
<seg id="1604">There were still longer ascents in between for the long triangles.</seg>
<seg id="1605">On the second day we went to Bad Dürkheim to Saline and Volksfest Wurstmarkt.</seg>
<seg id="1606">Again there was a lookout spot at a lookout point, connected by "flowy" trials and moderate ascents.</seg>
<seg id="1607">On the last two days there were again a lot of altitude metres.</seg>
<seg id="1608">Caves, rocks, towers, castles, ruins and shelters brought welcome breaks.</seg>
<seg id="1609">In Bad Dürkheim the bikers breathe in the open-air inhalatorium.</seg>
<seg id="1610">Also Neustadt was controlled.</seg>
<seg id="1611">After 173 kilometers and almost 4500 meters of altitude, the group had met the Pfälzer Wald from its best side - sporty and culturally.</seg>
<seg id="1612">Console instead of lawn - Bundesliga prepares for e-sports</seg>
<seg id="1613">Are sports-stars sitting in front of computer consoles in the future, instead of fighting through storms with wind and weather?</seg>
<seg id="1614">Fact is: e-sport has long been a serious business, becoming a lucrative business - big stars, millions of fans and huge tournaments with high levels.</seg>
<seg id="1615">This also recognized the first Bundesligavereins, who are increasingly involved in this field.</seg>
<seg id="1616">The beginning of 2015 was the VfL Wolfsburg, followed by the FC Schalke 04 and finally the VfB Stuttgart, who founded an e-sport department in mid July and took two pros for the computer game FIFA 17.</seg>
<seg id="1617">"" "" "" "we hope to inspire new young audiences for the VfB," "" "says CEO Jochen Röttgermann." ""</seg>

<seg id="1619">The football world association FIFA in London will host the first "Interactive Club World Cup," in which the gamers of different clubs compete against each other.</seg>
<seg id="1620">In addition to Schalke and Wolfsburg, for example Manchester City, Paris Saint-Germain or the PSV Eindhoven qualify.</seg>
<seg id="1621">Robin Dutt also sees great potential in E-Sport.</seg>
<seg id="1622">The ex-trainer of Bayer Leverkusen and Werder Bremen is now advising an agency for virtual football players.</seg>
<seg id="1623">"" "" "" "real football needs to deal in particular with the 14 to 30-year-olds that the young people will go to the stadium in the future," "" "says the 52-year-old." ""</seg>
<seg id="1624">And: the clubs tried to conquer all possible markets, especially the Asian.</seg>
<seg id="1625">With prominent E-sportsmen under contract, one could be much more often present on these markets than once a year to send the Federal Office to Asia once a year.</seg>
<seg id="1626">What is it exactly?</seg>
<seg id="1627">In E-Sport, computer games such as "League Of Legends," "Dota 2," "Counterstrike" or even the football simulation FIFA are fought on competition level.</seg>
<seg id="1628">Long ago, as in normal sports, Ligen was established where professionals compete against each other.</seg>
<seg id="1629">And by 2022, E-Sport is already part of the official programme.</seg>
<seg id="1630">But is it a kind of sport at all?</seg>
<seg id="1631">For many, the idea is certainly getting used.</seg>
<seg id="1632">Ingo Froboset has also been dealing with the question for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="1633">For the professor at the Deutsche Sporthochschule in Cologne, e-sport is a sport because it is competent and show many biological and physical reactions which are also found in classical sports - for example, increased heart rate, stress reactions, hormonal changes.</seg>
<seg id="1634">In addition, it needs cognitive abilities, a technical and tactical understanding and a fast reaction.</seg>
<seg id="1635">Professional gamers should not only train on the console but also exercise their body and pay attention to nutrition.</seg>

<seg id="1639">The scientist raises the high integrative effect of the e-sport in a positive way.</seg>
<seg id="1640">Players are travelling internationally, which is like a big global family, there are no intercultural barriers.</seg>
<seg id="1641">A study of the management consultancy Deloitte and the Bundesverband Interactive Entertainment Software (BIU) predicts rapid growth in the E-Sport.</seg>
<seg id="1642">In 2016, 50 million euros have been implemented in Germany, mainly via advertising, sponsoring and big tournaments.</seg>
<seg id="1643">In three years, sales are expected to lie at 130 million.</seg>

<seg id="1809">The assassination of a journalist underlines the growing threat in Mexico</seg>
<seg id="1810">The employees of the weekly Riodoce meet usually on Wednesdays to review their plans for reporting on the recent chaos in the state of Sinaloa by organised crime, corrupt officials and incessant drug wars.</seg>
<seg id="1811">But on that day, in the shadow of their own tragedy, they came together to talk about security.</seg>
<seg id="1812">They were told that it is important to change their routines.</seg>
<seg id="1813">Two high-ranking journalists discuss what feels more secure: they are supposed to take their children into the office, which in 2009 were the target of an attack with grenades, or leaving them at home.</seg>
<seg id="1814">Security experts have written three words on a tablet at the front of the room: opponents, neutral, allies.</seg>
<seg id="1815">They ask the reporters to propose names for each column - no evidence is necessary, perceptions and gut feelings.</seg>
<seg id="1816">There are drug smugglers, politicians, businessmen, journalists who are suspected of standing on the payroll list of government or cartels, a catalog of criminals that make the chaos of Mexico dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="1817">There is no rest break from violence, and while in the whole country the bodies pile up, more and more journalists are there: at least 25, since President Enrique Pena Nieto entered into office in December 2012. 589 are facing attacks and threats under federal protection and until now there have been at least seven dead in seven states this year.</seg>
<seg id="1818">Among the latter is her editor and her inspirer of Riodoce, co-founder Javier Valdez Cardenas.</seg>
<seg id="1819">"" "" "" "the biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and be a journalist," "" "wrote Valdez in one of his numerous books on violence in connection with drugs." ""</seg>
<seg id="1820">His absence is felt deeply even though his presence is present everywhere - a large picture of Valdez, which shows his middle finger with the word "Justice," hangs on the facade of the Riodoce building. two reporters in the thirties, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, wear t-shirts which show his smiling face with glasses or his typical Panamahut.</seg>
<seg id="1821">The workshop takes place less than two months after his death, and the reporters discuss their shared issues, the trauma, their nightmares, sleeplessness, paranoia.</seg>
<seg id="1822">Although a Sonder-Bundesanwaltschaft was established in 2010 in order to process the cases of journalists, it has conducted only two criminal proceedings, according to the Committee for the Protection of Journalists.</seg>
<seg id="1823">As with most thousands of murders linked to drug trafficking and organised crime every year, the murderers of journalists are rarely brought to court.</seg>
<seg id="1824">In Riodoce, they still insist on treating the violence of Sinaloa although they are inseparable and although the terrain is still more traitor.</seg>
<seg id="1825">Without any information about the murderers, without justice, the meeting to discuss security has little value, says Ibarra.</seg>
<seg id="1826">"it is very stupid to waste my time in this workshop," he says.</seg>
<seg id="1827">"" "" "" "as long as we don't know the Why, we all" "" "mistrust." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1828">On the morning of 15 May, Valdez left the office of the newspaper Riodoce in the province capital of Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1829">He only managed to drive a few blocks away before his red Toyota Corolla was stopped by two men. he was forced out of his car and was shot 12 times, probably because of the name of the newspaper - which is translated with "Twelve river."</seg>
<seg id="1830">The shooter drove away in his car and damaged it nearby.</seg>
<seg id="1831">Valdez was 50 years old.</seg>
<seg id="1832">He left a woman and two adult children.</seg>
<seg id="1833">Rumors tend to fly freely in Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1834">But on the subject of Valdez there is practically nothing but silence.</seg>
<seg id="1835">Since Guzman's arrest last year and delivery to the United States in January, Sinaloa has become one of the bloodiest battlefields of the country, since rival factions are fighting here to fill the vacuum.</seg>
<seg id="1836">It does not matter that in Sinaloa anyone or several people are shot on the street every day or that the Graveyard is full of tricky, two-storey mausoleums for drug kings that are larger than many homes for the living.</seg>
<seg id="1837">"" "forget for a minute that there is a state of" "" "peace" "" "if only a cartel has control over the coastal state with its precious harbours and drug trade routes in the United States." ""</seg>
<seg id="1838">Despite the fact that Valdez was aware of the dangers of his work, Ismail Bojorquez (60), a co-founder and director of Riodoce, broke the blame on that he could not protect his friend.</seg>
<seg id="1839">He believes that two misunderstandings have contributed to the murder.</seg>
<seg id="1840">First of all, in February, there was the publication of an interview with Damascus, a leader of one of the rival cartel fractions in the war with Guzman's sons.</seg>
<seg id="1841">This publication may have angered the children, presumed hardships bought each copy of the issue as soon as they were shipped to newspaper kiosks.</seg>
<seg id="1842">The second mistake was to force Valdez not to leave the country on its own security after the seizure of another newspaper, which had published the same story.</seg>
<seg id="1843">Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his killing is regarded as a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists.</seg>
<seg id="1844">He had survived so long that his friends and colleagues accepted that he would always be there.</seg>
<seg id="1845">He worked as an experienced reporter for Noroeste in 2003 when he joined with five colleagues to establish Riodoce and sold 50 US dollars of shareholdings.</seg>
<seg id="1846">"" "in Sinaloa," "" "it was impossible to run journalism without encountering smoking problem," "" "said Bojorquez." ""</seg>
<seg id="1847">Over time, the newspaper earned a reputation for courageous and honest reporting, and sales and advertising increased.</seg>
<seg id="1848">Reporters loved to be able to publish harsh investigations without fear of censorship, and the readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that no one else dared to treat.</seg>
<seg id="1849">"" "eight years after the establishment of Riodoce, it received the prestigious" "" "Maria Moors Cabot Prize" "" "for their coverage in Latin America." ""</seg>
<seg id="1850">In the same year, Valdez won the 'International Press Freedom Award' of the committee for the protection of journalists for his courage in pursuing the Mexican drug history wherever it led.</seg>
<seg id="1851">He voluntarily gave him that he was afraid.</seg>
<seg id="1852">"" "" "" "I want to continue living," "" "he said at the time of CPJ award." ""</seg>

<seg id="1858">He would always wear his hat.</seg>

<seg id="1863">"" "" "" "these things were not allowed," "" "said Bojorquez." ""</seg>
<seg id="1864">The result is, even in the best times, a high degree of self-censorship and self-preservation.</seg>

<seg id="1869">The landscape is changing constantly.</seg>
<seg id="1870">In the space where the employees of Riodoce met security training, no mobile phones were suddenly allowed. days before it became known that spyware, which is sold exclusively to governments, was used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico.</seg>
<seg id="1871">Outside, two policemen were looking for protection against the heat of 104 degrees (40 ° C) in the shadow of a tree.</seg>
<seg id="1872">They were commissioned by the state government to protect the offices of Riodoce in a four-storey building in a mid-class neighborhood of Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1873">Half of the joke, some of the reporters asked themselves whether these officers belong to the 50 per cent of the policemen who signed the governor himself as untrustworthy.</seg>
<seg id="1874">It is months since the reporters have gone into the mountain landscape, where the drug gangs de facto are under control.</seg>
<seg id="1875">For the issue of this week, Riodoce has blocked three main stories.</seg>
<seg id="1876">There was assassination of the brother of the former famous Boxers Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa.</seg>
<seg id="1877">They also had an exposé to the government spending, which concentrated on the provincial town of the governor.</seg>
<seg id="1878">And there was a group that was in one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan, a bloc from the office of the Prosecutor, conducted a kidnapping.</seg>

<seg id="1880">A reporter made public record that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician who ruled the ruling Institutional Revolution Party (PRI), which dominated almost the whole century all political levels.</seg>
<seg id="1881">Recently, several PRI-governors were accused of corruption.</seg>
<seg id="1882">Villarreal asked the reporter to write about previous incidents in this location, including one where a son of "El Chapo" Guzman escaped a military attack.</seg>

<seg id="1886">The office of Valdez was dedicated to the storage room for signs and stickers protesting against the murders of journalists, because the employees have become something they never expected: activists in the name of the press.</seg>
<seg id="1887">Reporter Miriam Ramirez dashed a few signs and went to a demonstration in the next morning because of another journalist for the office of the prosecutor.</seg>

<seg id="1946">But most contemporary animals that use the counter shading - think of deer, zebras or armadillos - are much smaller and vulnerable than loot, which signals that this nodose-carrier was exposed to a real fight for survival.</seg>

<seg id="1949">Scientists continue to examine the animal on reference to his life, including his conserved intestinal content to find out what it's eaten as his last meal.</seg>
<seg id="1950">They believe that the dinosaur, when he died, came into a river and went out into the sea where he sank on the back to the sea.</seg>

<seg id="1958">The scientists whose latest findings appear in the journal 'Current Biology' believe that Borealopelta sank after death in the sea and was mumified in mud.</seg>
<seg id="1959">The creature was found by Shawn Funk, when he was buried in the Suncor Millenium mine on 21 March 2011 near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta, Canada.</seg>
<seg id="1960">According to the museum, it is the upholstered armoured dinosaurs in the world, including skin and armor, and is completely from the muzzle to the hip.</seg>

<seg id="2039">After landing at 23 o'clock she took her 6-year-old daughter from her father's house and decided that the two would drive to Ferguson the next morning.</seg>
<seg id="2040">What happened in the following three years with Ferrell and Ferguson is the theme of a new documentary film, "Whose Streets?," in cinemas from 11.</seg>
<seg id="2041">It is a story of survival and protest, love and loss, strength and resistance, which consists of the viewpoint of people who live in the community and have filled the streets to demand answers.</seg>
<seg id="2042">As Ferrell and her daughter, who wore a flogdress and a matching crown to Ferguson, the two discussed a conversation that she had countless times before this morning "on the black experience and the black state."</seg>

<seg id="2051">The first station, when they arrived in Ferguson, was located at the South Florissant Road, a place opposite the police agency that became a camping area when the activists were waiting for the possible non-accusation by Officer Darren Wilson.</seg>
<seg id="2052">There Ferrell and her daughter were connected to a local business owner who made lunch.</seg>
<seg id="2053">They prepared bags before and helped to pass them on demonstrators.</seg>
<seg id="2054">Slowly began a new type of activism for Ferrell shape.</seg>
<seg id="2055">"my activism has totally changed after 9 August," she said and noticed that she was a student at the University of Missouri-St. Louis, president of the Minority Student Nurses Association and concentrated on food justice and health inequalities in black communities.</seg>
<seg id="2056">"I had no experience in organizing.</seg>
<seg id="2057">It is all come. "</seg>
<seg id="2058">Weeks later, Ferrell met Sabaah Folayan during an evening demonstration, one of the co-directors of the film.</seg>
<seg id="2059">Folayan said she and her cameraman Lucas Alvarado-Farrar wanted to "document" what was happening.</seg>
<seg id="2060">A question came Ferrell in the sense: "do you want to document or try to find a story you can use?"</seg>
<seg id="2061">This scepticism was nourished by countless cases of people, often from whites - in a community benefiting from their pain and resilience.</seg>
<seg id="2062">As Folayan recently stated in an interview: "we heard that people who were born and raised in Ferguson have not centered their voices and we wanted to do it differently."</seg>
<seg id="2063">Folayan had already worked together with the former Co-director Damon Davis, an artist from the area known for his activism around Todestrakt inmates.</seg>
<seg id="2064">His involvement brought Ferrell the project closer together with six other locals, the team of "Whose Streets?" in the years after Browns's shooting.</seg>

<seg id="2071">In addition, Ferrell's history repeats the role of black women in the wider Black-Lives Matter movement.</seg>
<seg id="2072">Two of the three founders of the Movement, who, after the killing of the black teenager Trayvon Martin, have shaped the film "BlackLivesMatter" in social media in 2012, identify themselves as gay.</seg>
<seg id="2073">"black, gay women in leadership positions have carried the movement altogether," said Ferrell, "and so we are constantly struggling on different fronts.</seg>
<seg id="2074">"" "black, gay women must bear the main burden of everything." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2075">"" "Folayan agreed to note that" "" "the movement really is maintained by black women and many black women." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2076">"" "however, it insists that" "" "this is not an affirmative type of action," "" "in which Ferrell was chosen as a heart of the film because of her identity." ""</seg>

<seg id="2124">An appropriate similarity: artist creates portraits with Chelsea Manning DNA</seg>
<seg id="2125">In the middle of the room of the Fridman Gallery in New York there are many faces to see - white, black and brown, which are almost imperceptible - that hang on cables from the ceiling.</seg>
<seg id="2126">The 30 portraits were created by the artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from Wangen-Tuppers and haircuts that were sent to her by Chelsea Manning.</seg>
<seg id="2127">Manning sent out the excerpts from Fort Leavenworth prison, where the former secret service analyst had a 35-year prison sentence, after making official diplomatic reports on the WikiLeaks website.</seg>
<seg id="2128">The new exhibition opened on August 2nd, is called A Becoming resemblance (An appropriate similarity).</seg>
<seg id="2129">She is the product of two years correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, whose discipline united their expertise in technology, computer science and art, and Manning, a transwife and landmark dissident, whose condemnation was transformed by Barack Obama when he had only three days in his office.</seg>
<seg id="2130">Through the algorithmic analysis of DNA that was extracted by Manning and created from the 30 portraits, how someone could look with these genomic data - the many ways how they can be interpreted and the inherent determinism of these interpretations - but also created for identity.</seg>
<seg id="2131">Manning, who was born as Bradley Edward, but had already spoken openly about identification as a woman since her puberty, was convicted in 2013 because of 20 charges, among them six clashes to the espionage law, computer fraud and theft.</seg>
<seg id="2132">Through the prison her picture was suppressed, so much that there was only one photo - a grainy, black-white Selfie, in which Manning obviously sits on a driver seat and carries a platinum blonde wig - associated with it.</seg>
<seg id="2133">In 2015 Dewey-Hagborg was just about the great success of their 2012 project 'Stranger Visions'.</seg>
<seg id="2134">The artist produced portraits of strangers from forensic artifacts like cigarette mute and chewing gum by extracting the DNA from the waste to produce a picture of how these people could look like.</seg>
<seg id="2135">That was the time she received an email from a newspaper magazine.</seg>
<seg id="2136">"they conducted an interview with Chelsea Manning while she was in prison, and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article," said Dewey-Hagborg at a press preview of the new exhibition.</seg>
<seg id="2137">And she couldn't attend this time and she could not be photographed, so she contacted Chelsea and asked her if she wanted to make a DNA portrait.</seg>
<seg id="2138">The artist and her imprisoned muse were too unequal Brieffreans who exchanged several letters over the course of two years.</seg>
<seg id="2139">"" "they even created a comic" "" "Suppressed Images" "" "illustrated by Shoili Kanungo, who predicted a future in which the President of Chelsea would transform judgment and would be able to see the exhibition personally." ""</seg>
<seg id="2140">That Obama was actually only a few days after the book was published, to ask Manning's release after seven brutal years in a Kansas military prison, there was a welcome type of happy meeting.</seg>
<seg id="2141">There is also now at the opening of the exhibition something low and strong, since Donald Trump carries out a war against informants from the government camp and against transgender troops to find new, tweezable ways to avoid the rigid circuits that he should fix.</seg>
<seg id="2142">When Dewey-Hagborg was asked for the strange timing of all these things, she said "things happen for a certain reason."</seg>
<seg id="2143">"" "in a artistic statement written down on the wall of the gallery, Manning called for an end to" "" "automatic fragmentation, whose foundation sex, race, sexuality and culture have been." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2144">On the opposite wall its mitochondrial DNA sequence - a thousandfold of Cs and Gs and As, is written in pencil.</seg>
<seg id="2145">Dewey-Hagborg hoped, by incorporating the 200 letters (or nucleotides after the highly developed scientific lexicon of the artist), how astonishingly similar, at least in biological ways, we are all.</seg>
<seg id="2146">"" "" "" "what people will hopefully take along is that our genome doesn't care about who we are and how open genetic data for an interpretation and how subjectively they are," "" "said Dewey-Hagborg, whose video works from 2007, Spave Memories, is also visible." ""</seg>

<seg id="2159">A nationwide man-hunt is in progress for a professor at Northwestern University and an employee of Oxford University, who are looking for suspects after a man had been stabbed in a luxurious apartment in Chicago with deadly injuries.</seg>
<seg id="2160">On Monday, Wyndham Lathem (42) and Andrew Warren (56) were issued arrest warrants for murder due to their alleged involvement in the death of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau, as demonstrated by the acts of the Court of Cook County.</seg>
<seg id="2161">The documents say that Cornell-Duranleau, 26, died after several engravings.</seg>
<seg id="2162">A community warning system published by the Chicago police agency states that the corpse was discovered on July 27.</seg>
<seg id="2163">Officials received a call, arrived at the Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victim with multiple injuries to his body.</seg>
<seg id="2164">Cornell-Duranleau was still declared dead, and detectives examined the stitches as murder, while the police were actively looking for the two suspects, officials said.</seg>
<seg id="2165">Lathem has been an associate professor for microbiology and immunology at Northwestern University since 2007.</seg>
<seg id="2166">Alan K. Cubgars, the vice president for university relations, said in an email statement that Lathem had now been judged and excluded from entering the campus of Northwestern University.</seg>

<seg id="2170">The statement added that Warrens colleagues were shocked and want him to surrender.</seg>

<seg id="2175">The police described the scene as a very cruel.</seg>
<seg id="2176">Guglielmi said it was unclear whether the incident took place on July 27.</seg>
<seg id="2177">It was confirmed by security cameras that Lathem and Warren were in the building.</seg>
<seg id="2178">"we believe Professor Latham and the victim had a relationship," said Guglielmi.</seg>

<seg id="2184">The PM commented on the second part of WADA's schedule to comply with the code that describes the criteria for the re-entry of Rusada and was recently published on the organization's website.</seg>

<seg id="2203">The start-ups that will help your company will not become the next Uber</seg>
<seg id="2204">Amy Errett wanted to measure luck with your employees at your e-commerce start-up, but the polls didn't work.</seg>
<seg id="2205">Answers were often vague, little helpful, or - worse - fraudulent.</seg>
<seg id="2206">And even if you promised anonymity, some workers did not trust the process.</seg>
<seg id="2207">"there was simply never consistency and objectivity," said Errett, who runs the 75-person San Francisco e-Commerce Hair Care company Madison Reed.</seg>
<seg id="2208">She called people out of the outside for help.</seg>
<seg id="2209">A new race of Human Resources start-ups is at the growth of helping businesses find out how their employees feel.</seg>
<seg id="2210">By creating and licensing software, which has the specific purpose of the measurement of employee engagement, they enable companies to conduct surveys, offer specific groups and demographic groups, provide employees anonymity and complaint hotlines, and in some cases, whistleblowers allow managers to bypass the C-suite managers and turn directly to the Board of Directors.</seg>
<seg id="2211">"you now have tools like Strava and Fitbit for pursuing their health, but where is the Fitbit for your company?" said Jim Barnett, co-founder and Chief Executive of Redwood City Start-up Glint, whose software analytics tools are used by companies to measure employee engagement.</seg>
<seg id="2212">Errett said she had a better insight into what your employees think and feel in the three years with Glint.</seg>
<seg id="2213">In addition to Snap surveys and surveys from certain teams, it provides a heat map of the company that shows at a glance which units have the most discomfort and which managers have low condition results - so you can replicate why.</seg>
<seg id="2214">Companies come to see that at the top of the workplace culture must remain, so that you won't be the next Uber involved in scandals since a former employee has published a blog post that describes an environment of nuisances in which those who have spoken, were punished.</seg>
<seg id="2215">For start-ups like Glint, this wish is an overview of a lucrative business opportunity.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The global governance, regulation and compliance sector could have more than $118.7 billion in 2020, following the funding-technical website of Let's Talk Payments.</seg>
<seg id="2217">Denver, Colorado, start-up Convercent, the company helps to prevent and recognize bad behavior, saw an increasing interest and activity in the middle of the Uber-Falles in Misskredit.</seg>
<seg id="2218">Converter has almost 600 clients including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.</seg>
<seg id="2219">Uber has recently registered as a client.</seg>
<seg id="2220">As Glint, converse companies can send customized "pulse" surveys, collect sensitive responses in real time and view the heat cards of your problem areas.</seg>
<seg id="2221">It also provides an anonymous SMS hotline that allows employees to report bad behavior.</seg>
<seg id="2222">And if the main managing director is involved, complaints directly go to the supervisory board.</seg>
<seg id="2223">"" "" "" "the court of public opinion has seized the regulators," "" "said Patrick Quinlan, the founder and managing director of Convercent." ""</seg>
<seg id="2224">When a company finds its employees badly treated or behaves inethical, it can experience expensive consequences due to consumer boycott, employee fluctuation and complaints, said Quinlan.</seg>
<seg id="2225">Ruby Tuesday, the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and more than 500 locations, has used Convercent for more than a year to ensure that employees are aware of policies and procedures and have an easy way to reach their corporate headquarters.</seg>
<seg id="2226">Earlier, if an employee wanted to report a problem, he or she found a phone number or e-mail for the corporate headquarters, submit a formal complaint and hope that he was taken seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2227">It was often a intimidation and uncomfortable experience, said James Vitrano, Ruby TUESDAYS General Counsel who said there was no good opportunity to pursue the discomfort of employees.</seg>
<seg id="2228">Now, as the company converts conversely, problems hidden by executives who were sitting in offices in cities or states have been identified - such as discrimination, harassment or infair internships.</seg>
<seg id="2229">"" "" "" "I can get closer to this holistic, 360-degree view into the experience with employment," "" "said Vitrano, who heads the risk management group of Ruby Tuesday." ""</seg>
<seg id="2230">"" "" "" "and we protect our shareholders from employment disputes." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2231">Companies began to reap ethics, values and employee engagement in 2002, after the accounting firm Arthur Andersen collapsed for ethical violations due to the Enron scandal, Quinlan said.</seg>
<seg id="2232">"" "but it took until the" "" "Social Media" "" "came to their right" "" "that companies recognized that they could not prevent their dirty laundry online." ""</seg>
<seg id="2233">"" "" "" "before using technology for monitoring ethics, people used hope as a strategy," "" "he said." ""</seg>
<seg id="2234">Both Glint and Convercent offer your software as a service, and burden the companies with recurring charges for the use of their products.</seg>
<seg id="2235">It is a business model and a chance to find the agreement between Venture Capital investors who have supported both start-ups.</seg>
<seg id="2236">Conversely $10 million received funding in February of companies such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, raising the total capital to $47 million.</seg>
<seg id="2237">Glitzers secured $10 million in November by Bessemer Venture Partners and earned his entire financing to $60 million.</seg>
<seg id="2238">These investments are hardly surprising, given the interconnected nature of companies, culture and venture capital.</seg>
<seg id="2239">There is a growing complex of research that shows that today's employees expect more from their jobs than before.</seg>
<seg id="2240">In competitive markets such as Silicon Valley, high salaries and interesting projects are just assignments.</seg>
<seg id="2241">Employees want to feel that you are accepted and appreciated and that you give your time to a company with a positive mission.</seg>
<seg id="2242">"" "" "" "if people are happy to be in a company that's worth their votes and that the work you do is worthwhile, then they feel more committed to making this company successful," "" "said Nina McQueen, Vice President of Global Benefits and Employee Experience in LinkedIn, which uses both Convercent and Glint." ""</seg>
<seg id="2243">Investors reach Rendites when their portfolio companies run well. companies run well when employees are committed and committed.</seg>
<seg id="2244">If the analytics tools of third parties promise to increase commitment and commitment of employees, it is no wonder that you will find support.</seg>
<seg id="2245">The data on employee engagement according to the experts of the workplace culture is important.</seg>
<seg id="2246">But the data are useless if the caretaker of a company does not take action.</seg>
<seg id="2247">In fact, when a company asks employees after your feedback, it may have an expectation that change is on the way.</seg>
<seg id="2248">And if the change does not come fast enough or not at all, this can breed disappointments and motivate employees.</seg>
<seg id="2249">"if you ask for 4.000 suggestions, you need to be ready to have 4,000 talks," said Russell Raath, President of Consulting at the Business Management firm Kotter International, who has seen companies that have relied on collecting data.</seg>
<seg id="2250">"" "" "" "for if you do not follow staff," "" "Have you really heard me?" ""</seg>
<seg id="2251">Do you care about it?</seg>
<seg id="2252">And if you don't care about why should I? "</seg>
<seg id="2253">Madison Reed, who now carries out monthly staff surveys, was able to implement measures on the same day if a problem is reported via Glint, so Errett.</seg>
<seg id="2254">And after collecting feedback from frustrated employees, it was able to reorganize several teams within the company and to add communication training to address the problems.</seg>
<seg id="2255">At Ruby Tuesday, the company gets new insights into the employees and hopes that in the long run, this leads to a better binding of employees in a sector that is known for high turnover.</seg>
<seg id="2256">"if you are not obligated to create a culture of transparency, you will lose people," Vitrano said.</seg>

<seg id="2388">The rise of sex robots is real and we should be worried</seg>
<seg id="2389">Just as you thought it can not become more crazy in 2017, a new report on technological developments in the field of sex robot is coming.</seg>
<seg id="2390">Yes, in fact.</seg>
<seg id="2391">Sex robots are currently a great thing.</seg>
<seg id="2392">Recently, the Foundation for Responsible Robotics (FRR) published a report on the development of sex robots in the next five to ten years.</seg>
<seg id="2393">According to Noel Sharkey, Emeritus Professor of Robotics and Artificial Intelligence at the University of Sheffield and Co-Founder of the FRR, we have to start taking their rise seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2394">Customers can choose the eye color of the robot, its shape of the nipple and the type of fingernail.</seg>
<seg id="2395">"" "" "" "people make fun of them, but the companies deliver a lot of it, and we will see them much more often," "" "said Mr. Sharkey in the release of his new report." ""</seg>
<seg id="2396">Modern sexes have developed from their inflatable partners to robots with a silicone skin that feels warm - with conscious human reactions which are achieved through artificial intelligence.</seg>
<seg id="2397">The user can also adjust his robot according to his beliefs "and select everything from the eye color of the robot on the form of nipples to the type or colour of his fingernails.</seg>
<seg id="2398">"" "but it becomes even more disturbing as many robots have the" "" "personalities" "", "which would let a stepford woman look progressive." ""</seg>
<seg id="2399">Modern sexes have developed into robots with a silicone skin.</seg>
<seg id="2400">The RealBotix robot enables for example its users to adapt their robots to the properties they are appealing like, for example, shredness.</seg>
<seg id="2401">And then there are the Roxxxy Gold Sex-robots developed by True Companion with pre-programmed personalities such as Frigid Farrah, "which conveys the impression of shyness and" Wild Wendy "with an" adventurous "personality.</seg>
<seg id="2402">"" "" "" "Roxxxy Gold has a personality adapted to your personality as good as possible," "" "warms the site of True Companion." ""</seg>
<seg id="2403">So she likes what you like, and she doesn't like what you don't like, etc.</seg>
<seg id="2404">In the course of the day she also has her moods - just like real people!</seg>
<seg id="2405">"" "she can be tired of being fixed on conversation or she can" "" "be in mood" "" "!" ""</seg>
<seg id="2406">There are many disturbing aspects of this rise of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the submissive female features, the Announcements on rape, when one goes a step towards Frigid (i.e.: resisting) Farrah, disturbing one most.</seg>
<seg id="2407">On his website True Companion Roxxxy is compatible with a vibrator, but for men.</seg>
<seg id="2408">"" "" "" "if women (sic) can have a vibrator, why can men then have no Roxxxy?" "" "it says on the website." ""</seg>
<seg id="2409">However, these sex robots are not just a fetish or just another sex toys.</seg>
<seg id="2410">Their formation and increasing refinement indicate a somewhat darker and lowering in our culture, on a retreat from the ideal of gender equality towards a desire for sex with subjugation as an optional encore.</seg>
<seg id="2411">Most men will of course hold no sex robots, while the FRR notes their rising popularity nonetheless, they remain provisionally on the brink of consumer culture.</seg>
<seg id="2412">But what permeates from the boundary zones can be very instructive regarding the spirit of time in which we live.</seg>
<seg id="2413">And many people are not strangely or insulting until the free market gives them permission.</seg>
<seg id="2414">There is a certain overlap that these highly developed sex robots are emerging in a time when the rights of women are threatened worldwide in which there is a president in the White House, who prays to have women sexually attacked.</seg>
<seg id="2415">The most deterrent aspect of the TV series' The Handmaid's Tale '(' The report of the maid ') are not the graphical images, the intricate body and the outcast eyes, but how realistic this vision works.</seg>
<seg id="2416">The Republic of Gilead is a leap, but at the moment it does not feel like a big leap.</seg>
<seg id="2417">The goal behind these sex robots is to make a physical similarity to actual women as realistic as technically possible (although with pornostar proportions).</seg>
<seg id="2418">Their builders want them to feel human that they imitate the movement of a real body.</seg>
<seg id="2419">"" "but, when it comes to their" "" "personages" "", "the robots are no real women." ""</seg>
<seg id="2420">They cannot separate from their companion or simply go away.</seg>
<seg id="2421">They have no mediation or background history, nothing that hinders independence or anything that could interfere with the fantasies of total submission.</seg>
<seg id="2422">In other words, they are fake slaves.</seg>
<seg id="2423">Or to express it in the Redemption of 2017: Maid</seg>
<seg id="2424">Pumps great power?</seg>
<seg id="2425">He makes Mitt Romney the epitome of common sense.</seg>
<seg id="2426">It has become a bondage of the Trump era that the political divisions, polarized the U.S. constituency, have also split families in small format.</seg>
<seg id="2427">Around Christmas and Thanksgiving, there were newspapers in the U.S. with advice on how to deal with the horror of Trump-choosing relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2428">We all think that we are all supposedly to burst our filter bubbles.</seg>
<seg id="2429">Less noticed is the power of gumps together to bring families together.</seg>
<seg id="2430">I mention this because my cousin, a left-directed poet, who lives in Chicago and has long been busy with the republicans in our family, visited me this week in New York.</seg>
<seg id="2431">It reminded me that unity against a common enemy can have a powerful effect.</seg>
<seg id="2432">With Trump in the White House, everyone, whom she knows, including the republican relationship, with which she fought for decades because of politics, suddenly and suddenly at the same side.</seg>
<seg id="2433">For the dining table this is certainly a good thing, but it is in a wider context that this also entails considerable risks.</seg>
<seg id="2434">The left was strengthened by the ump but the deputy effect of his presidency has the power to push us all to the right.</seg>
<seg id="2435">"" "if we speak of" "" "normalisation" "" "and" "" "bump" "", "we refer to the spooky possibility that his kittens will no longer meet us." ""</seg>
<seg id="2436">However, there is a long-term scenario, normalized in the Trump Republicans of the right wing, "which suddenly appear as the epitome of reasonableness when compared with its standards.</seg>
<seg id="2437">I find myself today from an active nostalgia for Mitt Romney's urian version of the crazy - the dog on the car roof, the 14% income tax (but at least we knew how to see his tax return) - both in comparison to Trump in fact appear to be a very mild criminal offence.</seg>
<seg id="2438">When Trump is going, the next Republicans will only be mentally healthy to qualify as immeasurable improvement.</seg>
<seg id="2439">When my cousin was in the city, we brought our children to the carousel in Central Park, the largest of the New York's carousel's carousel, and the best three dollars you can spend in the city if you don't need any caffeine.</seg>
<seg id="2440">The horses are enormously big, the fiberglass designs on the central cylinder - all clowns are knurled and the animals are twisted to look at full fear of their own shoulders - extremely dark and the cyclical music conveys this in a strange way.</seg>
<seg id="2441">So many clichés of a city disappoint: the views of tall buildings are old, the skylines are too familiar to offer much excitement, and the reality of the city will not meet the dream.</seg>
<seg id="2442">Thirty-five years later, and I am still not across the day when I discovered that Swiss Cottage is indeed not a Swiss cottage - the Topic Pub Ye Olde Swiss Cottage is not one - but a big roundabout in the north of London.</seg>
<seg id="2443">The Central Park-carousel is still a strange magic experience, since here two two-year-old, a 11-year-old and two women in the 40-ies can go on it and all have a great time.</seg>
<seg id="2444">If I could have rated the carousel, I would have given him the full score, but luckily nobody asked him.</seg>
<seg id="2445">On the other hand, I was forced into a department store this week to evaluate my "experience" with transactions on a scale of one to five stars before I could pass through my credit card.</seg>
<seg id="2446">In the coffee house at the corner of my street it's the same, plus the option to match the rating with a 15% tip - this in order to buy something about the counter.</seg>
<seg id="2447">This not only leads to a slowdown of what is supposed to be a neutral exchange, but also exerts pressure on the server to bring personality into a situation in which no need is needed.</seg>
<seg id="2448">The poor woman in the department store was apologizing grinsing while I was tired of making my credit card with five stars.</seg>
<seg id="2449">Oscar Pistorius transferred to hospital with chest pain</seg>
<seg id="2450">For the second time, Pistorius left the prison for a visit to a hospital.</seg>
<seg id="2451">Last year, he was brought to the hospital for the treatment of cuts at his hand joints, according to the prison authorities, according to a case in his cell.</seg>
<seg id="2452">Pistorius was sentenced to a first death sentence due to murder following an appeal against prosecutors.</seg>
<seg id="2453">He killed Steenkamp in the early hours of Valentine's Day 2013 by shooting them several times through a door of the toiletries in his house in Pretoria.</seg>
<seg id="2454">Pistorius claimed that he held his girlfriend for a nightly intruder who hid himself in the cabin.</seg>
<seg id="2455">The prosecutors have announced their intention to appeal against the six-year prison sentence of Pistorius Appell, of which they say they are too sighted.</seg>
<seg id="2456">"" "" "" "the national prosecution authority said that it was lodged by the Supreme Court of South Africa, and the objection could be heard this year." ""</seg>

<seg id="2536">The place has already been written - however suitable candidates are rare.</seg>
<seg id="2537">Wacker Stadtbaumeister has been a city engineer for 31 years.</seg>
<seg id="2538">And the work still makes him great fun as he conveys in the press talk.</seg>
<seg id="2539">He reports on varied but also challenging tasks that are waiting for his successor.</seg>
<seg id="2540">At the same time, he marvelled that no application has been submitted to the requirements profile so far.</seg>
<seg id="2541">At the next stage, the city seeks an architect or a civil engineer.</seg>
<seg id="2542">In compliance with the regular periods of notice, there is still enough time for a revision.</seg>
<seg id="2543">Since Haslach functions for the administrative community as a subcontractor, the applicant must assign corresponding degrees.</seg>
<seg id="2544">For this function wants to keep the city in any case.</seg>
<seg id="2545">If they could no longer fill them, the citizens would have to go to Offenburg until Offenburg.</seg>
<seg id="2546">But the closeness to the city and the city itself is important, says Wacker, who reports from a good working atmosphere and good mood between the authorities and the citizens.</seg>

<seg id="2557">Since the old town stands as an ensemble under monument protection, it is important to "have an eye on what fits," if new buildings are approved, the secular city builder emphasises.</seg>

<seg id="2562">Continuity is not only important for a good working environment, but also for the further design of the city.</seg>
<seg id="2563">Anyone who wishes to inherit Roland Wacker should be able to inform the city of Haslach as a graduate engineer or a bachelor with subject area architecture and have good knowledge in the areas of construction and construction law.</seg>

<seg id="2580">Red meat and chocolate can sound like a nightmare for your digestive system.</seg>
<seg id="2581">But a new study claims exactly the opposite: a diet rich in meat-based proteins and dairy products could alleviate symptoms of patients with inflammatory bowel disease.</seg>
<seg id="2582">The incurable condition that affects approximately 1.3 million and 300,000 in the United States causes stomach cramps and flatulences, recurring or bloody confusion, weight loss and extreme fatigue.</seg>
<seg id="2583">While the sufferers are usually advised to avoid flesh and dairy products to alleviate their symptoms, researchers found at the Washingtoner University that the essential amino acid tryptophan helps to develop immune cells that promote a tolerant gut.</seg>
<seg id="2584">The leading researcher, Dr. Marco Colonna, stated that immune cells in the intestines patrol to ensure that harmful microbes that hide in food do not penetrate into the body.</seg>
<seg id="2585">Cells that are capable of triggering inflammation, are balanced by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging sensitive tissues.</seg>
<seg id="2586">If the balance tends to be too far in the direction of inflammation, it can result in an inflammatory bowel disease.</seg>
<seg id="2587">Experiments have been found that a kind of tolerance promoting immune cell occurs in mice that carry a certain bacterium in their intestines.</seg>
<seg id="2588">And the bacterium requires tryptophan - one of the building blocks of proteins - to dissolve the appearance of the cells.</seg>
<seg id="2589">Professor Colonna said: "we have established a connection between a bacterial Lactobacillus reuteri - which is a normal part of the gut microbiome, and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance.</seg>
<seg id="2590">The more tryptophan the mice had in their food, the more they had from these immune cells. "</seg>
<seg id="2591">It suggested that the combination of L. reuteri and a nutrition rich in tryptophan encourages more tolerant, less inflammatory intestinal milieus if the same system acquires people.</seg>
<seg id="2592">Post-doctoral research Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barragan examined a kind of immune cell that promotes tolerance, when she found out that a group of study mice had such cells, but another group of the same tribe, which was separately housed, did not.</seg>
<seg id="2593">They suspected that the difference had to do with intestinal microbial symptoms - the community of bacteria, viruses and fungi that normally live in the gastrointestinal tract.</seg>
<seg id="2594">The intestines of the mice were DNA-sequenced and six bacterial species were found, which were present in mice with the immune cells, but without them missing in mice.</seg>
<seg id="2595">Mice were raised in a sterile environment so that they lacked intestinal microbiome and they did not develop these kinds of immune cells, and they got the L. reuteri and the immune cells.</seg>
<seg id="2596">In order to understand how bacteria reacted to the immune system, the researchers left L. reuteri in a liquid and then transferred small amounts of fluid - without the bacteria - to immaturated immune cells isolated from mice.</seg>
<seg id="2597">The immune cells developed into the tolerant cells.</seg>
<seg id="2598">When the active component was purified from the liquid, it proved to be a by-product of tryptophan metabolism, known as an Indol-3 lactic acid.</seg>
<seg id="2599">When the researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in the lining of mice, the number of such cells increased by approximately 50 percent, but when the tryptophan values were halved, the number of cells decreased by half.</seg>
<seg id="2600">Dr. Cervantes-Barragan stated that people have the same tolerant cells as mice and that most of us L. reuteri in our gastrointestinal tract.</seg>
<seg id="2601">It is not known whether Tryptophan-by-products from L. reuteri develop the cells in humans as in mice, but defects in genes in relation to tryptophan were found in people with inflammatory bowel disease.</seg>
<seg id="2602">"" "she said," "" "The development of these cells is probably something we would like to promote since these cells control inflammations on the inner surface of the intestines." ""</seg>
<seg id="2603">Potentially high tryptophan values in the presence of L. reuteri can lead to an extension of this population. "</seg>

<seg id="2673">The mayor Albert Schindler and three representatives of STEG urban development on Wednesday were informed about this.</seg>
<seg id="2674">At the beginning of the information event, Schindler was once again looking back on what happened.</seg>
<seg id="2675">Since 1991 it has been in sensitisation areas.</seg>
<seg id="2676">At that time, in the Sanitation Area I from 1991 to 2004, the State of Baden-Württemberg took over two thirds of the funding amount.</seg>
<seg id="2677">In the II from 2005 to 2016, the subsidy was still 60 percent.</seg>
<seg id="2678">For Schindler, the previous renovations are a "success project" - it is ultimately important to encourage internal development and not only to open new construction areas.</seg>
<seg id="2679">On April 4, I received the information from the Government Council of Karlsruhe that there will be a rehabilitation area III.</seg>
<seg id="2680">The funding amount was 833 333 euros, of which 500 000 euros would be from the country, the rest from the municipality's sensitivities.</seg>
<seg id="2681">How is a rehabilitation area now created?</seg>
<seg id="2682">One will continue to study as Schindler, where the "really old" houses are.</seg>
<seg id="2683">But it also plays a role as to whether in the planned area they are interested in rebuilding.</seg>

<seg id="2692">In November or December, the decree must be carried out as possible, so that the rehabilitations can be started in the coming year.</seg>
<seg id="2693">Pietzschmann subsequently stated that each commune must carry out the said preliminary investigations.</seg>

<seg id="2718">The helicopter was built in Connecticut next to a yacht from Maine, a fire brigade car from Wisconsin and a forklift from Mississippi.</seg>
<seg id="2719">The military office of the White House requested the presence of the helicopter in a fragmentary order or frago, barely 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South Lawn, according to the recordings of the Marine Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1), the unit responsible for the operation of the helicopter.</seg>

<seg id="2904">"" "a total of 547 Rainsburger Domspatzen were" "" "victims of attacks" "", "67 Domspatzen were sexually abused between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s." ""</seg>
<seg id="2905">In the final report, it is said to Georg Ratzinger, who was active in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994: "in summary, it can be said that by Domkapellmeister R. in many cases, forms of physical and psychological violence have been applied.</seg>
<seg id="2906">Especially with high emotionality, the punishment for the students was even more violent.</seg>
<seg id="2907">"" "nevertheless, unlike many other accused, many victims have estimated the general humanity of R. and therefore, in numerous cases, even have positive memories with him, despite violence." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2908">In the interview Ezekiel explains why the Final Report was relieved of the abuse scandal at the Regensburger Domspatzen Georg Ratzinger in his opinion.</seg>
<seg id="2909">"" "Mr. Hesemann, the 440-page report on the" "" "incidents of violence of violence in protective cases" "" "in the" "" "Regensburger Domspatzen" "" "is a contradictory picture of Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger." ""</seg>
<seg id="2910">For one, many students emphasize his "humanity."</seg>
<seg id="2911">On the other hand, it also appears as a cholera and perfectionist, which became handy when a domain speck didn't bring top performance musically.</seg>
<seg id="2912">How do you evaluate this final report as his biographer?</seg>
<seg id="2913">Michael Hesemann: if you make the effort and read the whole 440 pages long report from the front to the back, you have to ask yourself why the name Georg Ratzinger is in general.</seg>
<seg id="2914">Just eight pages are dedicated to him and he is clearly acquitted of any suspicion of the midday or fellow-hood in the terrible cases of sexual abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2915">The excesses of violence at the pre-school also occurred outside of his sphere of activity.</seg>
<seg id="2916">At best it is possible to reproach him, learn from it too late or not have taken first hints seriously enough.</seg>
<seg id="2917">"" "the Domspatzengymnasium, on which he worked, was felt by virtually all respondents - as" "" "salvation," "" "heaven" "" "and" "" "better world" "". "" ""</seg>

<seg id="2919">Only a minority complains about his perfectionism and his high emotionality that led to burglary breaks even before.</seg>
<seg id="2920">That he did not only knead with chairs and cast the keys on the floor, but also distributed ear-figs and pulled too naughty guys to the hair or ears, he himself had admitted years ago, deeply regrets and apologized for this.</seg>
<seg id="2921">To his salvation, however, must be said that such educational methods were widespread in the questionable time, the 1960s and 1970s, in parents like teachers.</seg>
<seg id="2922">Do you still know such breeding methods?</seg>
<seg id="2923">Of course, I think everyone of us, who was born before 1968.</seg>
<seg id="2924">I also experienced it in a secular school, a state gymnasium.</seg>
<seg id="2925">Compared to what actually is in this report, namely, the horrific sexual abuse and the excesses of violence at the pre-school, there is certainly Bagatelles.</seg>
<seg id="2926">You wonder if it's not about his acquaintance and his role as a brother of Benedict XVI, that many media just fell on him.</seg>
<seg id="2927">At the Bavarian pope many people who have never understood him are still busy.</seg>
<seg id="2928">But the truth is: the report relieves Georg Ratzinger in every respect!</seg>
<seg id="2929">In the media, in connection with the report a lot was reported about the issue of abuse in the Regensburg Domspatzen.</seg>
<seg id="2930">Is Georg Ratzinger put in the final report also any undertaking or co-operation with regard to sexual abuse?</seg>
<seg id="2931">Michael Hesemann: clearly no.</seg>
<seg id="2932">Not one of the 67 victims of sexual assault claimed to have entrusted himself to the Cathedral Chapel.</seg>
<seg id="2933">Not even the parents were consecrated.</seg>
<seg id="2934">"" "" "" "I never dared to talk about it with my father or mother," "" "said one affected representative for the others," "" "It was all very embarrassing to me." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2935">"" "" "" "the real problem with the enlightenment of sexual abuse has been and is, however, that most victims are silent." ""</seg>
<seg id="2936">If they did not even trust parents and siblings, then certainly not a choral leader, who had been professionally a college of perpetrators.</seg>
<seg id="2937">How do the domain-mitts students rate Ratzinger's role in regard to the misuse cases?</seg>
<seg id="2938">Michael Hesemann: a questioned student formulated it in such a way: "regarding sexual abuse... I see... no case in which he (Georg Ratzinger) had had timely realizations and could have stopped the respective perpetrator.</seg>
<seg id="2939">I think it... also for really absurd to assume that all of this... boys invade intruely and clearer or even more, than opposite their parents, dormitories, trustees, etc.</seg>
<seg id="2940">"" "that you talk to him about sex... - unthinkable." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2941">"" "thus the report comes to the very clear result:" "" "that the students and / or their surroundings confided in the run-up could not be confirmed in the context of the investigation." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2942">As far as sexual abuse is concerned, so, Georg Ratzinger is free to speak about any fellow man.</seg>
<seg id="2943">"" "" "" "so he cannot be accused of being prevented or brought to the announcement." ""</seg>
<seg id="2944">Therefore there is no reason to link his good name to these contradictory crimes, as unfortunately happened in some cases.</seg>
<seg id="2945">"" "a lot of" "" "violence excesses" "" "in the media was to be read in the" "" "Rainsburger Domspatzen." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2946">"" "the former Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger is discarded in the report" "" "Look Out" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2947">Must he live with this reproach?</seg>
<seg id="2948">Michael Hesemann: this is the big problem that in the reporting everything is mixed and mixed up to a huge melange of sexual abuse and violence excesses and somewhere, in the middle of drin, Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2949">But this again is an abuse of the report.</seg>
<seg id="2950">Therefore it is clean separated: between the pre-school and the gymnasium of the cathedral-cats, between sexual abuse and excesses as well as, we say once, other reproaches.</seg>
<seg id="2951">In addition, the report covers events from time since 1945, so also for four decades, in which Georg Ratzinger was not the choir director of the cathedral-cats.</seg>
<seg id="2952">The whole awful examiner pedagogy, the cases in which boys of sadistic teachers were properly channeled and maligned, and who suffered them horribly, occurred all at the pre-school in Etterzhausen and Pielenhofen, where really scandalous conditions have to prevail.</seg>
<seg id="2953">But with those, Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger had nothing to do, because he only got the boys his face when they were already at the gymnasium gymnasium.</seg>
<seg id="2954">"" "on that, like most witnesses, emphasise the subject" "" "Preschool" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2955">One was only happy to be able to escape and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even "paradisiacal" conditions.</seg>
<seg id="2956">What was different from the gymnasium gymnasium?</seg>
<seg id="2957">Michael Hesemann: there was discipline, but there was no sadistic violence.</seg>
<seg id="2958">"" "this also applies to Georg Ratzinger, where the report concludes that" "" "many victims are estimated the general humanity of R. and therefore in numerous cases even positive memories with him." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2959">At the most, it remains the reproach to have looked away.</seg>
<seg id="2960">However, despite all efforts, the report could only define two periods in which it was reported by the states at the pre-school.</seg>
<seg id="2961">The first time 1970 / 71 when he began to establish himself and from the events at a school in which he was not working and responsible, (so the witness) wanted nothing to hear, and then again around 1993.</seg>
<seg id="2962">Did Georg Ratzinger consistently close the ears?</seg>
<seg id="2963">Michael Hesemann: no, because already in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the Domspatzengymnasium, who even reproduced the report.</seg>
<seg id="2964">"" "in this he points out to this," "" "that in the pre-school, the audit is still practiced." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2965">Even in the face of the danger of negative media representatives, he recommended urgent action.</seg>
<seg id="2966">This was, of course, at a time when legal clarity was, when inspectors were banned in Bavaria for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="2967">Before that, they occurred in a legal grey area, as each of us probably knows.</seg>
<seg id="2968">It was difficult for him to guess where the people concerned were perhaps exaggerated or dramatized, and where really the permissible limit had been exceeded.</seg>
<seg id="2969">But you can't say that he always looked away.</seg>
<seg id="2970">This is simply not true.</seg>
<seg id="2971">Only in 1980, the test penalty for schools was officially abolished in Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="2972">Princess Gloria of Thurn and Taxis claimed that it was unfair to apply today's pedagogical standards to the time at that time.</seg>
<seg id="2973">How do you see this?</seg>
<seg id="2974">"" "Michael Hesemann: we historians talk of the" "" "pitfall of anachronism" "", "that is, the danger of assessing the past according to today's moral standards." ""</seg>
<seg id="2975">"" "" "" "the princess is right." ""</seg>
<seg id="2976">But of course this does not apply to sexual abuse, which was abhorred at all times, and not for what was broken in the pre-school of adversity and violence against innocent children's shrimps, that goes far beyond the usual practice.</seg>
<seg id="2977">This is all horrible and I am happy that it will finally be reworked.</seg>
<seg id="2978">But at the same time, I must take Georg Ratzinger in protection, because all that had nothing to do with him.</seg>
<seg id="2979">His means of discipline and punishment, i.e. earphones and ears to draw, were widespread in the 1970s.</seg>
<seg id="2980">As physical punishment is forbidden, he has kept strictly adhered to.</seg>
<seg id="2981">"" "which picture of his Rainsburger time has Georg Ratzinger returned in the talks with you for the book" "" "My Brother of the Pope" "" "?" ""</seg>
<seg id="2982">Did the subject of testing also come to speech?</seg>
<seg id="2983">Michael Hesemann: well, in the book it's about the life of his brother Joseph, i.e. Pope Benedict XVI, tells from his perspective, there the cathedral-cats played only one side role.</seg>
<seg id="2984">Nevertheless, I did not at all deny that he carried out a strict regiment there.</seg>
<seg id="2985">But this must also be said once: without these perfectionism, without unconditional discipline, it would hardly have been possible for him to form an institution of world trang, true cultural ambassador of Europe and his musical tradition, which went on tour twice in the USA (1983 and 1987) and Japan (1988 and 1991).</seg>
<seg id="2986">With biscuits and candy alone, one makes no big singers and stands before every success, regardless of what area, but always discipline, passion and self-overcoming.</seg>
<seg id="2987">What kind of man did you experience Georg Ratzinger during the talks about her book?</seg>
<seg id="2988">Michael Hesemann: through the work on the book and beyond, I really met Georg Ratzinger and again and again experienced a wonderful, humorous, basic, deeply believing and heartfelt people, from which one can't imagine that he could only do a fly.</seg>
<seg id="2989">I get on a regular basis, like many former cathedral-cats today, 23 years after his retirement, regularly visit him, visit him, read it - he is almost blind - and treat him as a member of her family.</seg>
<seg id="2990">Those who have not forgiven him until today that he was once strictly to them, are therefore clearly in the minority.</seg>
<seg id="2991">Most of the cathedral-cats today are thankful to him that he enriches her life and brought them to the world of music.</seg>
<seg id="2992">And that he is always a good, paternal teacher - a strict father, certainly, that may be - but also a lovable respectful person, to which they still look up today and which they almost worship.</seg>
<seg id="2993">And please, once again clearly: all you submit to him are educational methods that were on the agenda at that time.</seg>
