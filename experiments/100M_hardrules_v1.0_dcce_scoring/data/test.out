a 28 @-@ year @-@ old cook who recently moved to San Francisco , was found dead in the stair@@ way of a local shopping centre .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the brother of the victim said he could not imagine anyone who would harm him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fin@@ ally it went uph@@ ill with him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

the brother of the victim , Louis Gal@@ icia , shared the ABS transmitter K@@ GO in San Francisco that Frank , who previously worked as a cook in Boston , took his dream job as a cook in the S@@ ons &amp; Dau@@ gh@@ ters Restaurant in San Francisco six months ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a spokes@@ man of the S@@ ons &amp; Dau@@ gh@@ ters said that they were &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sho@@ cked and destroyed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; about his death . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are a small team who works like a close family and we will miss him pain@@ fully , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the spokes@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Louis Gal@@ icia admitted that Frank was first living in host@@ els but that , &quot; things were finally going uph@@ ill for him . &quot;

Louis Gal@@ icia said he could not imagine anyone who would do harm to his younger brother .
he was a friendly person with a great heart .
to connect his family with his family , it was always something to cook for us to prepare dinner , &quot; said Louis Gal@@ icia .
he never wanted to participate in any sort of dispute .
he was the brother who sw@@ am with the river .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with everything going wrong in the world , he was this un@@ polished diamond , which sh@@ ines bri@@ ghtly every day , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Jen@@ ni@@ fer A@@ ni@@ ston : I will always be in drawers
Jen@@ ni@@ fer A@@ ni@@ ston not always has to be perfect or successful .
that made the Hollywood star un@@ am@@ big@@ uous in an interview .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m always put into drawers or stuck from outside the label that usually doesn &apos;t have little to do with me and the reality . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I do not have the desire to be always perfect and successful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hon@@ estly , these things are rather s@@ nu@@ g to me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Jen@@ ni@@ fer A@@ ni@@ ston ( 47 ) can only laugh about her as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Miss Perfect &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as she explains in the current &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cos@@ mopolit@@ an &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the act@@ ress sp@@ ends her time at home , a television with a delicious D@@ ut@@ t and Mexican food , it is said in the magazine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she asks the question of the children &apos;s wish : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we women don &apos;t have to be married or have children to be perfect , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the Hollywood star . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in her new movie &quot; Mother &apos;s Day - Love is not Child &apos;s Play &quot; is A@@ ni@@ ston to see her mother of two sons .
the film runs with us from August 25th .
gol@@ fer Lan@@ ger wins the sports pyramid
his experiences on the horse are man@@ age@@ able .
at the end of a golf tournament in South Africa , Bernhard Lan@@ ger , with some colleagues , sought a little di@@ version with a ride on the beach .
it was a premiere for the 58 @-@ year @-@ old .
CHI@@ O : &quot; golden Sports Pyrami@@ d &quot; for Bernhard Lan@@ ger
after a few minutes the horses remembered their holidays , they hun@@ ted at home in fast gal@@ lo@@ ping home .
a kilometer at this pace , I was afraid .
&quot; it was not a good experience , &quot; Lan@@ ger says .
and so the riding career ended up again .
on Saturday Germany was the best gol@@ fer ever - 101 tournament vic@@ tories - again near horses .
he took his family over the site of the AL@@ RV , on a horse he did not even get to photography .
long was the first time in Aachen and there@@ with also at CHI@@ O .
the reason was quite convincing .
the German sports aid presented the man from An@@ hausen in the context of a small gal@@ a the Golden Sports Pyrami@@ d .
it does not lack the sy@@ mp@@ a@@ thetic sport@@ s@@ man .
Bundes@@ ver@@ dienst@@ kreuz , Silber@@ nes Lor@@ be@@ er@@ blatt , Champions @-@ Tour @-@ Player of the year ...
even the British Queen already ad@@ mi@@ red him .
long is the 18th prize @-@ winner of the sports pyramid .
in Aachen he met the first prize winner Hans Günter Win@@ kler on Saturday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this award means a lot to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Lan@@ ger , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for it is not only awarded for sporting achievements , but also for social commitment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for decades , Lan@@ ger has promoted the offspring .
and so he also gave the prize money of 25.000 Euro .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with 15 other outstanding sport@@ s@@ men , the double US mast winner was recorded on Saturday in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hall of F@@ ame des deutschen Sports &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the athletes are Hart@@ wig Gau@@ der and Harald Schmit@@ t , the gymn@@ ast Eber@@ hard Gi@@ enger , the ke@@ eper Cornelia Han@@ isch , Alexander P@@ usch and Ar@@ nd Schmit@@ t , the helm of Peter @-@ Michael Kol@@ be , the Ju@@ do@@ ka Frank Wi@@ en@@ eke , the jumping champion Al@@ win Sho@@ ck@@ em@@ öh@@ le and pos@@ th@@ um der Hand@@ b@@ aller Er@@ hard Wunder@@ lich .
many of these sports legends had come to Aachen on Saturday .
after the official part , the illustri@@ ous society moved to the jumping stadium , where the Lav@@ azza @-@ price ran .
Bernhard Lan@@ ger kept distance to the big animals .
Clin@@ tons und Tr@@ umps Wirtschaft@@ spolitik compared : it &apos;s all about the money
investing in infrastructure and preventing the T@@ TP trade agreement - they want both Clinton and Tr@@ ump .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the two US presidential competitors are at the same time in the tax and energy policy as well as in a fundamental issue . &quot; &quot; &quot;
differences in economic policy between Donald Tr@@ ump and H@@ illary Clinton is a fundamental , rather philosoph@@ ical difference .
he , on the role of the state .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ump does not want to keep in doubt small and war@@ ns against how the state of the economy can harm - with taxes and regulations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Clinton wants to put the economy to death and regulate it to death , he says .
he himself , on the other hand , would be completely different , asser@@ ts Tr@@ ump .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he will massi@@ vely return regulations and he is strong for far @-@ reaching tax reform with lower tax rates - for private people and for companies . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Clinton says : the state has certain tasks to fulfill , it has dis@@ advant@@ aged opportunities to open up and needs money for it .
that is why taxes for the rich would increase , they say .
interest@@ ingly , both are very close to the topic of infrastructure .
in those that need to be invested , Tr@@ ump and Clinton say almost verb@@ ally .
the democratic candidate even announces the largest investment in new jobs since World War II .
state investment programmes in infrastructure are classic democratic policies and are strictly rejected by the government @-@ critical wing of the Republi@@ can Party .
on Tr@@ ump , there could still be part@@ isan discussions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the differences in energy and climate policy are more evident . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tr@@ ump wants to build coal @-@ fired power plants and drive coal mining in the USA . &quot; &quot; &quot;
oil production should also be possible in so far protected areas , the Paris climate protection agreement wants to announce .
Clinton , on the other hand , intends to explicitly expand renewable energy with its investment program : &quot; a country will become the super power of clean energies and create millions of jobs . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will be either China , Germany or America - I want us to be . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but not only in infrastructure - even in international trade agreements , the two competitors are not too far away from each other .
T@@ PP , the tran@@ sp@@ azi@@ fic trade agreement , both do not want to sign .
at the same time , both , however , do not want to isol@@ ate the US from international trade - but simply protect only American jobs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they should also be paid better then calls for Clinton . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the current minimum wage of USD 7.@@ 25 is a famine wage .
she wants to raise her to 15 dollars per hour .
what Tr@@ ump wants to do in this matter is not quite clear : once he says , the minimum wage needs to go , then he says he should not be changed .
but the great discussion of the coming months is likely to be more likely to develop the tax policy of the two camps .
on the one hand stands Tr@@ ump , who wants to relie@@ ve the economy and citizens in order to boost growth .
his critics ad@@ here to him , that the budget defic@@ it would be even greater .
on the other hand Clinton , who wants at least demand from the rich that they pay more taxes , and their critics say : more taxes are not the solution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; escape : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; every wing@@ ed woman has experience with sexual violence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
sexual violence is part of women who are fle@@ eing alone , almost everyday life .
when they arrive in Germany they are often traum@@ ati@@ zed .
a house offers shelter .
there are four women sitting in a large kitchen .
each one has a baby , which is at most one year old .
one has put her little son in her arms .
he looks cur@@ i@@ ously in the room with big eyes .
his mother star@@ es on the table top .
until she notes that she is observed .
she sm@@ iles shortly and kis@@ ses the little ones .
the scene seems normal .
until one speaks with Kat@@ rin B@@ ahr .
she is an area manager of Con@@ dro@@ bs , a sponsor for social welfare services in Bavaria , and deals among other things with the issue of women on the run .
the four women in the kitchen are p@@ oultry .
they live in the North of Munich in one of the few de@@ central accommodations for women and their children in Bavaria .
in January , Con@@ dro@@ bs set up the establishment together with Pro Familia and the Munich Women &apos;s A@@ id .
recently it was officially opened .
60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children .
men are not there - even not as a visitor .
the exception is a guard in front of the door .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is not exagger@@ ated to say : every woman who arrives here has made experiences with sexual violence on her escape , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; men flee for wars because they are politically persec@@ uted because they thre@@ aten torture or death , or because their families send them to Europe as a hop@@ eless person , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in women , other reasons for the escape : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many ste@@ al secre@@ tly because they do not see any other way out . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in their home they have experience with sexual violence , forced , hon@@ or@@ able moral , slavery or pro@@ stitution .
that drives them away .
on the run this goes on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for example , that tu@@ gs demand a sexual act for a bottle of water is not a rar@@ ity , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the women are alone , they are not protected by their families .
who believe that the end as soon as they anchor in Germany , B@@ ahr is telling .
here too , women in refugee shel@@ ters would often be considered inferior and ab@@ used in the worst case .
this leads to the fact that about 90 percent of women living in the housing in the north of Munich are traum@@ ati@@ zed , they appreciate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some of the children surely did not come up voluntarily &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
many women are so used to say nothing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or they don &apos;t dare to talk openly about the experience because the shame is too big . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since they often don &apos;t know how to help , it needs more accommodations only for them , demands B@@ ahr .
in Bavaria , the seven District Govern@@ ments are responsible for the accommodation of refugees .
on the question of whether they knew from a similar project like in Munich in their jurisdiction , some answer with no .
in the Ober@@ pf@@ alz and Upper Fran@@ con@@ ia there is no such thing in accommodation of the governments .
even in the ra@@ v@@ ens , alone @-@ fle@@ d@@ ged women are not accommod@@ ated separately , says Karl @-@ Heinz Meyer , press spokes@@ man of the government .
in Upper Bavaria , Lower and Central Fran@@ con@@ ia there are floors or own houses only for single women and their children .
the exception is Lower Bavaria , there are two central accommodations exclusively for women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the committee &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rights of Women and Gender E@@ quality &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the European Parliament also calls for women to be separated from men . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a study published for the committee , it says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It is very important that men and women are being shel@@ tered separately . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; lack of privacy , or becoming men and women together , can make it - perpet@@ ual - violence against women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
especially the wash@@ rooms should be separated and easily accessible for women , is available in the study .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how much the women feel this protection need can be read at the rush that puts it on the house in Munich . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since we have spoken around , we have a long waiting list , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot; &quot; &quot;
one could easily make a second home .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; assistance doctors &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Stri@@ king : demands for new labor steps &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
dep@@ u@@ ties of the resident doctors have called on their union to appro@@ ve new labor @-@ fighting measures with regard to a new treaty .
the Junior Doc@@ tors Committee ( J@@ DC ) of the British Medical Association ( B@@ MA ) required its entire Council to appro@@ ve more labor @-@ fighting measures from the beginning of September .
the J@@ DC said that it was a minister to address the concerns regarding the contract .
assistant doctors and medical students have agreed in July about the rejection of a contract agreed with the B@@ MA .
he was rejected by 58 % of his members who voted in the elections .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a letter to the members released on Twitter on Thursday evening , the chairman of the J@@ DC Ellen Mc@@ Court said that the government remained &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; persist@@ ently calm &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which led to the fact that the treaty was rejected . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in view of this , the J@@ DC Committee has agreed to fully reject the proposed new contract and calls for official re @-@ negotiations for all your concerns . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in response to the silence of the government , the J@@ DC Executive Board today filed a formal application for a special meeting of the B@@ MA Council to appro@@ ve a running program of escal@@ ating labor campaign , which begins at the beginning of September .
the disputes led to the fact that Assi@@ stance physicians struck six sm@@ ally this year , the first overall fail@@ ures in the history of the N@@ HS .
the head of the B@@ MA Registr@@ ar Dr Johann Mal@@ aw@@ ana came back after the election to reject the agreed contractual conditions recommended by the B@@ MA .
he shared B@@ MA members during meetings , which were still held before the vote by 54,@@ 000 Assi@@ stance physicians and medical students , that the contract should be beneficial and accepted .
after the vote , the Minister of Health Jerem@@ y H@@ unt said that the contract for doctors in England would be for@@ ci@@ bly introduced .
Russia and Turkey : an &quot; alliance of out@@ si@@ ders &quot; ?
it was a gest@@ ure that ended a crisis .
the leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to give their hands and to pro@@ claim an official end of the eight @-@ month war of words and economic sanctions .
but when Vladimir Putin has received his Turkish counter@@ part in the gil@@ ded hall of St. Petersburg Palace , I cannot rep@@ udi@@ ate the impression that Ankara wants this reconciliation most .
there was the hand@@ shake , yes .
but Putin &apos;s smile was sm@@ iling and he hardly radi@@ ated warmth , even for his restra@@ ined circumstances .
Rec@@ ep Tay@@ y@@ ip Erdo@@ gan , on the other hand , spoke repeatedly about his &quot; dear friend &quot; Putin - according to a report all five times .
I could not count it any more .
he also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis , but will even improve .
the next day , a newspaper described that Erdo@@ gan had heard that it would never have happened .
to me his enthusiasm seemed more to indicate the opposite .
but one of Putin &apos;s brilliant , sustainable cool@@ ness showed that Russia &apos;s head of state had nothing to forget .
rather , the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his introduc@@ tory words : the shot of a Russian figh@@ ter plane at the Syrian border through Turkey .
Moscow &apos;s reaction to the time was w@@ asted .
Putin shared and accused Ankara to have fallen into the back of Russia .
the off@@ ence was even greater since it was committed by a supposed friend .
to re@@ build Vet@@ rop@@ es becomes difficult , if not even impossible .
the public opinion in Russia has changed since November .
for months , the state @-@ controlled media launched a violent , un@@ restricted attack on Ankara .
at once it seemed as if the Tur@@ ks would bear the blame for everything .
most serious were alle@@ g@@ ations of leading officials that Erdo@@ gan &apos;s own family would have benef@@ ited from illegal oil trade in areas of Syria , controlled by the so @-@ called Islamic State .
he has denied this v@@ eh@@ ement .
but in St. Petersburg , the official message was that it was time to look forward .
finally , this meeting took place only because Putin received the exc@@ use of President Erdo@@ gan , which he wanted to hear .
Russia was able to make a way of victory .
for Ankara , the advantages of a ce@@ ase@@ fire are obvious .
Erdo@@ gan is primarily concerned with all the friends he can get after he was un@@ vei@@ led last month at a failed coup d &apos;@@ é@@ tat of almost his ministry .
repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey have also sh@@ aken him .
but there are also economic motives .
Russian sanctions have hit Turkey hard - in particular the ban on charter flights , which usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast each year .
the number is decreased by almost 90 % .
in Russia travel operators and charter companies will be reli@@ eved when the flights are resum@@ ed .
they count on a late @-@ season rush to the Mediterranean Sea .
this week , the state television predicted bil@@ li@@ ger@@ ous fruits and vegetables as soon as Turkish agr@@ arian imports are allowed again .
a report in Ve@@ demo@@ st@@ i formulated it as follows : &quot; tourists there long , tomatoes here long . &quot;
but the visit had an additional political value for Moscow .
Ankara is fur@@ ious on the West , since it respon@@ ds to the attempted coup of power as a weak response .
to this end , the ongoing res@@ ent@@ ment about the sn@@ ail emp@@ t@@ ying of EU accession negotiations and Putin - that is pi@@ ke to benefit from the cool mood and to reduce the relationship of Turkey to the West .
the Russian head of state won a bonus in Ankara that after the attempted coup d &apos;@@ é@@ tat , he demanded support for the elected state organs .
this is well @-@ evident for Moscow , a matter of course , which itself has a deep @-@ seated fear of reg@@ iment .
the summit in this glam@@ orous palace by the sea enabled Russia and Turkey to represent an analy@@ st who once described me an &quot; alliance of out@@ si@@ ders &quot; : two countries that viol@@ ate the West and feel badly treated and are now alli@@ ed .
nevertheless , despite the public reconciliation , there are still major differences between the two .
the biggest difference is Syria , where Moscow has recently played the role as a pe@@ ac@@ em@@ aker , but where Russia and Turkey support opposing sides .
it could be significant that after almost three hours of first conversations , both the presi@@ dents at the press conference said they had not even stri@@ pped the issue .
the President of Turkey for@@ ged to answer a question about their differences , while Putin decided to emphas@@ ise this .
there is no clear con@@ sensus on what a common denom@@ in@@ ator can be found in Syria .
but after months of open host@@ il@@ ities - and in view of the potential for a perfect disaster , when NATO member Turkey shot the Russian figh@@ ter jet - it is certainly better that the two heads of state speak at least once again .
Royal Bank of Scotland no longer available to customers outside Scotland
according to the Board of Management of the Bank , the R@@ BS should only be reduced to a back office role .
the Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer be available to customers outside Scotland .
ROSS Mc@@ E@@ wan shared the BBC Scotland with the R@@ BS brand associated with the global amb@@ itions of the Bank .
since then , the Bank has dist@@ anced itself since it had to be almost collap@@ sed and saved eight years ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; at this time , brand strategi@@ sts &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; R@@ BS &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; have used to protect other end @-@ consumer finance brands . &quot; &quot; &quot;
she supported international sport with millions of pounds of sponsor@@ ship , from Six Nations Rug@@ by to Wim@@ ble@@ don winner Andy Mur@@ ray .
but now she has decided to put more national brands into focus .
the Royal Bank of Scotland will be available only for customers in Scotland but will not be initi@@ alized .
in England and Wales , all RS@@ B references , the de@@ centralized head office and the stock exchange will change to Nat@@ West .
the Ul@@ ster Bank brand is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland .
there are other smaller brands for private customer business that will get more meaning - C@@ out@@ ts , Adam &amp; Co , Dr@@ um@@ mond and Hol@@ t &apos;s Military Bank .
Mc@@ E@@ wan was inter@@ viewed during a guided tour of customers and employees in In@@ ver@@ ness @-@ Sh@@ ire .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he shared the BBC Scotland : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the RS@@ B brand becomes our investor &apos;s stamp as well as the brand under which our employees will be busy as we are now becoming a bank of brands . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when the Bank itself became a global brand , R@@ BS became a global brand .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I say now that we do not pursue global goals , but pursue local goals . &quot; &quot; &quot;
each of these brands will stand in their own communities for something completely different and our employees will work among these brands with their customers .
R@@ BS has already said that it will no longer continue its Six Nations sponsor@@ ship and that it will increase the percep@@ ti@@ bility of the various brands in its sports sponsor@@ ship .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is time for us to develop to the bank of the brands , as how do we focus on ourselves inside ( we asked ) to make this a better bank for customers ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Chief of Officer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it would have been very cy@@ n@@ ical three years ago when we said that we would be a great bench for our customers and would have launched these marks .
but with our work , the focus on customer needs and not our own , I think you will see many changes .
we can launch these marks again , so I think the time has come .

I am very emotional because my family is here too
I am very happy that it happened at New@@ market because I landed here 30 years ago .
it &apos;s not a big meeting , it &apos;s not Royal As@@ cot - it &apos;s a ban@@ al Friday evening with 20,000 people .
I am reli@@ eved and very modest .
D@@ ett@@ ori picked up the che@@ ers when he fet@@ ches victory on Pre@@ di@@ le@@ ction
two jo@@ ck@@ eys have reached the milestone in the ste@@ ep@@ le race - Jo@@ ckey Richard Johnson and the retired 20 @-@ time winner Sir Anthony Mc@@ Co@@ y , who reached over 4,@@ 300 wins in a record breaking career .

Frank@@ ie is one of the best jo@@ ckey in the modern era and it is no surprise that he reached this milestone , only a few have reached before him .
it has style and is strong , but it is its tac@@ tical intel@@ le@@ ct that distingu@@ ishes it from the others in the weight control room .
he is a fantastic ambassador for racing , his enthusiasm and char@@ isma fans have been enthusiastic fans for years for this kind of sport .
I said Frank@@ ie a few weeks ago at Ep@@ som , that he had already brought 6,@@ 000 wins if he was not only a weekend and a great tournament jo@@ ckey !
Frank@@ ie has been in the UK for almost 30 years , which is great .

&quot; &quot; &quot; a whole series of major tournaments , including his famous &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gl@@ orious Seven &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 1996 in As@@ cot , but he also survived an aircraft crash and received a ban on drugs . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Russian Putin hum@@ id rod @-@ head Serge@@ i Ivan@@ ov
Russian President Vladimir Putin recently dism@@ is@@ sed his head of staff Serge@@ i Ivan@@ ov .
Ivan@@ ov was part of Putin &apos;s tigh@@ test confidence circle for many years .
the 63 @-@ year @-@ old was appointed Special Represent@@ ative for Environmental and Transport Affairs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in an opinion of the Krem@@ lin , it reads that without giving reasons &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ivan@@ ov@@ s dism@@ is@@ sed his duties as chairman of the Russian Presi@@ dential administration . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Anton V@@ ain@@ o , who has been a dep@@ uty since 2012 , was appointed to his successor .
V@@ ain@@ o , 44 , is a former diplom@@ at .
born in Tallinn in 1972 , he graduated from the renowned Moscow Institute for International Relations ( M@@ GI@@ MO ) and worked in Tokyo &apos;s emb@@ assy .
on the website of the Krem@@ lin it is called ( in Russian ) that he later became the chief manager and Chief of Staff of the Government Party .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said to Putin about his appointment : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thank you for your confidence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think it is the most important task of the government to support your activity as head of state in terms of laws and controls to implement your instructions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Putin shared the Russian TV station on Friday that Ivan@@ ov was asked to leave his post and V@@ ain@@ o as his successor .
are the sm@@ iling faces ?
this step has been exposed to Moscow myst@@ ically .
Serge@@ i Ivan@@ ov has been one of Vladimir Putin &apos;s tigh@@ test confi@@ d@@ ants for a long time , as he works for the Soviet Intelligence Service , the K@@ GB .
as Chief of Staff , he was one of the most powerful men in the country .
at a meeting with President Putin , which was broad@@ cast@@ ed on television , both men claimed that the Chief of Staff re@@ signs at his own request .
but despite the smile for the cameras , few of them are convinced - especially now , just before the parliamentary elections .
so here is the result of a kind of power struggle ?
that knows no one at the moment .
but the official claim - that a man who once tou@@ red as a potential president at once would like to lead Russian environmental policy - came across great sc@@ ep@@ tic@@ ism .
in his remarks to Putin , quoted on the Krem@@ lin &apos;s website , Ivan@@ ov said , &quot; It is true that I asked you in a conversation at the beginning of 2012 , to me this very complicated post - you could almost say - compl@@ ain@@ ant posts for four years .
as it turns out , I have been chairman of the Russian Presi@@ dential administration for four years and eight months .
Ivan@@ ov took the position in December 2011 .
previously he was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence .
he is a member of the Russian Security Council and as a former member of the State Security Service K@@ GB .
in the late 1990s , when Putin was chairman of the Federal Security Service ( F@@ SB ) who replaced the K@@ GB , Ivan@@ ov was appointed his dep@@ uty .
when Putin came to power he called Ivan@@ ov as one of five people he trusted most .
once it was assumed that Ivan@@ ov could become president of Russia after Putin &apos;s second term , since a third term Putin had viol@@ ated the constitution .
but this post was taken by another , close allies of Putin , D@@ mit@@ ry Med@@ ve@@ dev .
Putin became Prime Minister before he became president three and a half years later .
criminal Min@@ ds Star Thomas Gib@@ son fired after he beat producer
Gib@@ son took part in a physical examination at the set of the series in Los Angeles last month .
ABC Studios and C@@ BS Television Studios , which produce the series , announce his dism@@ iss@@ al in a joint statement .
Gib@@ son , who played the special agent Aaron Hot@@ chner , publicly ap@@ ologi@@ zed on Thursday before the announcement of his dism@@ iss@@ al .
the set came to artistic differences and a dis@@ agreement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I regret the incident , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in a message . &quot; &quot; &quot;
details of how the character Gi@@ bs@@ ons from the series , which follows a team of F@@ BI agents , is expected to be published at a later date according to ABC Studios and C@@ BS Television Studios .
the 54 year old , who previously played in Sit@@ com D@@ har@@ ma &amp; Gre@@ g , has been with us since the first season of the series in 2005 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I love criminal Min@@ ds and put my whole heart blood in the last twelve years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gib@@ son in a message published on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I had hoped to be at the end , but this will not be possible now .
I would like to thank the authors , producers , actors , our wonderful crew and especially the best fans who can only wish for a series .
the planned radi@@ ance of the twel@@ fth season is scheduled for September 28 .
ri@@ dd@@ les around fish that landed in the garden in Ban@@ ff
a population of Ban@@ ff called for help in identifying the fish that appeared in his garden in Ban@@ ff .
Kevin B@@ ain thinks it could deal with the 75 fish for sand@@ als produced by a fountain of foun@@ tains .
Mr. B@@ ain , who lives around 500 meters from the sea , published a video of the spect@@ acle in Per@@ is@@ cope in the hope that someone could shed some light on the appearance of the two inches long fish .
Que@@ ens@@ ferry Crossing : crossing the Bridge
the £ 1,35 billion expensive project is to be completed by May 2017
engineers have connected the north deck of the Que@@ ens@@ ferry cross@@ ings with Vi@@ ad@@ u@@ kt - meaning that the bridge is now connected with fi@@ fe .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is the first of four closures of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; deck blo@@ wer &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which comes to completion for each of the three towers of the bridge . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the bridge section of Fi@@ fe is now 600 meters long and weigh@@ s 30,000 tons .
it has more than 10,000 tonnes of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 spare parts .
the £ 1,35 billion expensive project is to be completed by May 2017 .
Minister of Economy Keit@@ h Brown today visited the construction site and was one of the first to go from the country to the bridge .
he said , &quot; This is a historic and symbolic moment when building the Que@@ ens@@ ferry cross@@ ings .
we are all witnesses of an engineering of a truly ep@@ ic extent on this project with more than 30.000 tonnes of concrete and steel , which were used alone for this part of the bridge .
despite the massive size and weight of the bridge , the completion of the closure between the vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct and the bridge deck is a delicate activity that requires extremely precise toler@@ ances for the fit .
in total , almost 79 % of the entire bridge &apos;s ceiling is at its place and the last section of the deck today gets a concrete sl@@ ack for the deck , meaning that the entire deck is ready to be lifted on the bridge to its place .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Michael Martin , Project Manager of For@@ th Crossing Bridge Construc@@ tors said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the first conclusion is a significant milestone in each bridge project . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this fantastic project represents the conclusion of forward @-@ looking high and civil engineering .
after the installation of the last section of the road and its connection with the northern tower on the north , we had to close the existing gap in the north or south side .
this was reached by pulling the northern fe@@ eder bridge 700 milli@@ meters south .
this was a massive and at the same time very delicate activity .
massive , since the Vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct is 222 metres long , weigh@@ s about 6,@@ 000 tons and had to be pulled upwards on an incl@@ ine of approx . 3 % .
the toler@@ ances on which the team work were tiny - on each side they were only a few milli@@ meters .
fortunately everything went very well .
&quot; &quot; &quot; rescue in Mo@@ el@@ fr@@ e Bay : three men have &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; luck &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; still alive &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; three men have &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; lucky &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to be alive after they were thrown from their fishing boat ahead of Angl@@ es@@ ey . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Mo@@ el@@ fr@@ e RN@@ LI rescue station struck at 13 : 20 B@@ ST Alarm after a crew observed the event at Mo@@ el@@ fr@@ e Bay .
the three men had difficulty to swim while their boat moves from their own strength .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we saw how the boat revol@@ ved around and set us the worst off , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the leader of the rescue station of Mo@@ el@@ fr@@ e Vin@@ ce Jones . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fortunately , the strong winds have already ri@@ pped the boat out of their reach until we left to water , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two of the men were saved by a local fishing boat while the third man was exhausted at the age of 60 and was found on a board without life@@ jacket .
they all came abo@@ ard the coast ret@@ ailer and were brought back to the rescue station
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mr Jones said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the three men who were thrown into the water have been un@@ har@@ med and still alive . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the boat engine had an emergency stop , but they rid themselves when the boat was cr@@ acked by the person who controlled the boat .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; someone has wo@@ ke up today about these men . &quot; &quot; &quot;
seriously wounded - man stab@@ bed his ex @-@ girl@@ friend
a man has attacked his ex @-@ girl@@ friend in Hamburg @-@ Har@@ burg with a knife and seriously injured .
as the police announced yesterday , the 50 @-@ year @-@ old had the key to the apartment to get his personal bel@@ ong@@ ings .
instead , the alcoholic perpet@@ r@@ ator cuts the clothes of his ex @-@ girl@@ friend .
when she came into the apartment , he stab@@ bed on her twice .
the 44 @-@ year @-@ old was injured in the hand and in the body .
the police were able to arrest the perpet@@ r@@ ator .
during the 50 @-@ year @-@ old ru@@ ined the clothes of his ex @-@ girl@@ friend , he called his mother .
this ther@@ eu@@ pon he aler@@ ted his sister .
together with her partner , the 45 @-@ year @-@ old wanted to calm their brother .
but she could not move it to leave the apartment .
therefore she went out of the house with her partner .
on the road they met the man &apos;s ex @-@ partner .
when the two women entered the apartment again , the 50 @-@ year @-@ old thrust his sister to the side and attacked his ex @-@ girl@@ friend .
who builds Braunschweig cheap apartments ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD and the Gre@@ ens mean : investors should be much more involved in the future . &quot; &quot; &quot;
how do you react to the bad news that Braunschweig will lose nearly 1,@@ 300 cheap apartments over the next years ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD propos@@ es a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concept of action &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the next meeting session . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but stri@@ fe is programmed .
first and foremost , it is about the question : who should build the favourable apartments ?
a regulation is missing so far .
&quot; &quot; &quot; SPD leader Christoph Brat@@ mann comments : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we agree with the Gre@@ ens : whoever wants to build on urban areas must show 20 percent of all apartments as social housing in the future . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the favourable apartments can also be found in the stock .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , the big dispute in the town hall is , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Brat@@ mann : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how to deal with investors who want to build on private surfaces ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want investors to build at least 10 percent on such surfaces , but build as 20 percent of the apartments as social housing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a new urban housing construction program that will cost millions and must still be funded , should provide incenti@@ ves for incenti@@ ves .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the problem , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Brat@@ mann : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is currently no agreement between the parliamentary groups . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the C@@ DU would like to make investors as few regulations as possible .
the left wants even harder editions for investors .
regardless of the so @-@ called Brat@@ mann , there is a ti@@ ghtening of the situation in the housing market .
if the concept of action is implemented , this will take care of additional tasks in the building administration .
more staff is needed .
it is un@@ clear whether we will get the skilled workers .
but the program does not yet fully stand out : the approximately 1260 new apartments , which should be built anyway .
but how does one compare the loss of other around 1300 favourable apartments , whose funding will be run over the next few years ?
it will be 500 apartments alone until 2020 .
in order to prevent this , so the bud@@ get@@ ary spokes@@ person Nicole Palm , should now be bought out @-@ of @-@ the @-@ art bonds purchased from the city .
in addition , it would have to be thought to get apartments back into price binding again .
this is possible in the western town .
in one stroke the problem could be solved .
because in the western city the year @-@ end dead@@ lines run out .
around 1800 apartments could be brought back to the price binding for cheap apartments .
only : that is what the owners do not want , the housing companies do not want .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the number of social housing in the West is dra@@ st@@ ically increased , one remo@@ ves from the aim of so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mixing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is no need for a concentration of socially dis@@ advant@@ aged people in just a few parts of the city .
the Gre@@ ens reck@@ on that there is still movement in the discussion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; group president Holger Her@@ lit@@ sch@@ ke says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a broad majority , the C@@ DU must go into the boat . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
indeed , I have concentrated on more building plots for single @-@ family homes .
but what does not mean is that a compromise can not yet be found .
Pok@@ é@@ mon Go , a hunt for health and happiness that is worth it
it is fascinating to watch how the world changes .
the fact that teen@@ agers and children do not go outside for playing , but rather prefer to spend their leisure time on screens , have been compl@@ ained by many in the last decade .
Pok@@ em@@ on Go is about getting people from the sofa and becoming more active .
the time on the screen was initially limited to the TV , then on video games and finally limited to smartphones .
therefore it is great to see that technology and outdoor activities are not mut@@ ually exclusive .
of course I refer to the Pok@@ é@@ mon Go @-@ W@@ ahn , an app based on the characters that were initially created for vide@@ og@@ ames in the 199@@ 0@@ ies ( later a carto@@ on series , playing cards and other spin @-@ off@@ s ) were created .
how many pop culture phenomena decreased interest in the publication of the game in the US , Australia and New Zealand in early July .
market launch in other countries was shi@@ fted by the massive demand that the server over@@ l@@ apped .
within a few days , Pok@@ é@@ mon Go had more users than ink and almost as many as Twitter .
how does it work ?
in short , players go outside with their smartphones and search for Pok@@ é@@ m@@ ons who can be tr@@ acked with a GPS and once they were found , &quot; photograph@@ ed &quot; ( over a screen@@ shot on the phone ) or &quot; captured . &quot;
a generation that played the game when she was younger , joined the tap and jump@@ ed for the search of the sofa .
in the United States , the game led to a si@@ zable increase in steps the &quot; average &quot; person puts back every day .
Car@@ di@@ ogram , an app for Apple Watch , pursuing 35,@@ 000 users , the Washington Post recently reported that within two days after the launch of the game , the number of persec@@ uted people who exercise every day 30 minutes , jump@@ ed from 45 percent to 53 percent .
the company doesn &apos;t know who plays Pok@@ é@@ mon Go - it just looks the raw data for improving performance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; many public awareness campaigns for health that want to bring people to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; take 30 minutes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; come from the sofa &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to be active every day &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; because many public messages are bo@@ red to health and come from people who feel mis@@ erable . &quot; &quot; &quot;
nevertheless , the importance of sport cannot be over@@ rated .
anyone who drives sports regularly reduces its chances of developing cancer or depression .
physical activity helps in weight control , high blood pressure , diabetes and a long list of benefits that is too long to lead them here .
but the wonderful thing about Pok@@ é@@ mon Go is that it brings people to do something outdoors that makes them fun .
three pillars of health are covered - exercise , fresh air and sunshine as well as fun .
some people even join new friend@@ ships on the hunt .
as always there are also m@@ ür@@ rical play@@ mates who always have to compl@@ ain about something .
and yes , someone could go against a door .
what is it ?
there is a breakthrough .
even if smartphone apps like Fit@@ bit were already pursuing our activity earlier , they gave us no reason to play sports as this game does .
the new will lose its charm and the use will be ref@@ unded with time .
however , due to Pok@@ em@@ on &apos;s success , there will be more games that will combine apps and virtual reality with the active in the real world and help many people on the hunt , more active , f@@ itter and heal@@ thier .

Simone Bil@@ es creates gold in the D@@ ament@@ als
forget the pressure .
forget the hyp@@ e .
Simone Bil@@ es is on all the immune .
dynamic on the jumping horse .
effort@@ lessly on the beam .
breathtaking on the ground .
on the whole line brilliant .
and now finally Olympic champion .
the 19 @-@ year @-@ old American gymn@@ ast er@@ kl@@ om@@ m on Thursday for the title title and magni@@ fied the gap between himself and the rest of the world in front of all eyes under the spot@@ light of the Olympic Games .
her total result of 6@@ 2,@@ 198 was clearly before the silver med@@ alli@@ sts and &quot; Final Five &quot; -@@ team amer@@ ad@@ in A@@ ly R@@ ais@@ man and the Russian bronze med@@ al Ali@@ ya Must@@ af@@ ina .
the American women Simone Bil@@ es tur@@ nt on the floating beam during the single multi @-@ campaign of women at the Olympic Summer Games in Rio de Jan@@ eiro 2016 , Brazil , Thursday .
Bil@@ es is the fourth h@@ eter@@ os@@ ex@@ ual American who wins a multi @-@ ran@@ ged title and a total of the fifth , while she consoli@@ dates her reputation to be the best of her generation or even at all .
she burst into tears when her end result was shown and her long journey at this moment found an end .
this success puts them in the same le@@ ague as unique athletes like Michael P@@ helps , who brought their sports to new heights :
Bil@@ es has dominated the sport for the last three years - including 10 gold med@@ als - including 10 gold med@@ als - with so amazing exercises that include a mixture of amb@@ ition and precision that the Olympics from 1984 Mary Lou Rett@@ on from her said that she is &quot; the best gymn@@ ast I &apos;ve ever seen . &quot;
it was expected to be a final exam in Brazil , a competition not so much between Bil@@ es and the rest of the athletes , but rather between her and a burden of over@@ sized expectations .
not returning with a hand@@ ful of gold back to the family in Spring , Texas , would be considered dis@@ appointment .
the American women Simone Bil@@ es , left , and A@@ ly R@@ ais@@ man embrace each other after they have won gold and silver in the single multi @-@ campaign of women at the Olympic Summer Games 2016 in Rio de Jan@@ eiro , Brazil , Thursday .
Bil@@ es took the first med@@ al on Tuesday , while she served as excl@@ am@@ ation mark at the gradu@@ ation ceremony of the team coordin@@ ator Martha Kar@@ ol@@ yi .
although Bil@@ es insist@@ ed on having never planned the future , it is not really true .
part of their floor exercises - which contain their typical cav@@ eman &apos;s passport - is tuned to Latin American music that would fit at home on the street outside the Olympi@@ a@@ arena in Rio .
this is not a coinci@@ dence .
this girl , adopted by her grand@@ parents as a small child and was discovered by trainer A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ man &apos;s mother during a school excursion into the gym , trained in Bo@@ or@@ man , became vig@@ orous .
since the summer of 2013 , she has no longer lost a competition competition , a winning series , which will last as long as it wishes .
even though Must@@ af@@ ina was slightly led by two turns , the picture stim@@ ulated .
Schwe@@ be@@ bel@@ ken and Bo@@ dies - in which Bil@@ es holds the world title - lau@@ ded .
she got up again with 15,@@ 433 on the Schwe@@ be@@ for@@ ks - and with a 15,@@ 9@@ 33 on the ground she was still on top of it .
R@@ ais@@ man gently embr@@ aced her as she expected her En@@ der@@ g@@ b@@ nis - a pure form@@ ality - and tears stre@@ amed on Bil@@ es shiny red , white and blue eyel@@ iner , as the vision she once described in her collective book became reality .
the performance R@@ ais@@ mans was a re@@ venge for the last time four years ago when she fought for the third place , but the bronze med@@ al went to Must@@ af@@ ina in a Ti@@ eb@@ ra@@ ke .
this time , the 22 @-@ year @-@ old female company , called O@@ ma , &quot; had a lead .
after her ground , she threw the audience to the audience , overwhel@@ med by a com@@ eback , which sometimes seemed dou@@ bt@@ ful .
as far as it concerns itself , the rapidly expanding Twe@@ et of 19 @-@ year @-@ olds has a very new meaning from the beginning of this week :
police : 3 victims in mass murder when listening to music in the car
according to police reports released on Thursday , two women and a 12 @-@ year old girl were shot , who have died in one of the le@@ thal attacks for a decade in the first mass mur@@ derer from Phoenix , while they stopped in the car and listened to music .
Angela Rochelle Liner , Stefanie R. El@@ lis and El@@ lis daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah were shot on June 12 , while the car was par@@ ked in a dri@@ ve@@ way , the authorities said .
the perpet@@ r@@ ator fired eight shots from a hand weapon , while he stood on the passenger side of the car and then fled with another vehicle , is to be read in the report .
the police reported that the thre@@ e@@ fold murder would not have been the result of a rob@@ ber@@ y out@@ fit , as the att@@ acker did not take the hand@@ bags or the $ 2,@@ 900 , which took possession of one of the adult victims .
the police spokes@@ man of Phoenix S@@ g@@ t. Jonathan Howard said that the shooting was led by the investig@@ ators to take a closer look at whether it is connected with four previous attacks .
altogether , seven people were killed and two more injured in H@@ isp@@ anic residential neighbor@@ hoods within four months in nine attacks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it happens in a residential neighborhood in front of a house , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Howard of K@@ HP@@ O , a subsidiary of C@@ BS , beginning of the month . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is assumed that susp@@ ects have used several vehicles , including a brown N@@ iss@@ ans from the late 199@@ 0@@ ies , a black BMW from the late 199@@ 0@@ ies and a white Cadi@@ l@@ lac or Lincoln .
the investig@@ ators refused to expose the evidence that led them to the conclusion that the attacks were linked and committed by the same mur@@ derer .
El@@ lis , 33 , was hospit@@ alized due to their injuries and died later .
liner , 31 , and El@@ lis daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah died on the spot .
a witness told the police that it was not unusual for them to sit in a par@@ ked car and listen to music .
the authorities also published a police report on the shooting , which aimed at an empty pick@@ up truck half an hour before the thre@@ e@@ fold murder and assumed that it was the work of the serial killer .
investig@@ ators found cartridge sleeves and secured a ball from the seat as well as ball fragments from the engine compartment .
mother of a 6 @-@ year @-@ old with micro@@ cep@@ hal@@ ia : &quot; it gets better &quot;
like most 6 @-@ year @-@ old Ed@@ mund Pic@@ ci@@ uto loves singing , toys and of course his mother .
but as the least of his anti@@ quity , Ed@@ mund &apos;s micro@@ cep@@ hal@@ y , the result of a genetic disorder , about which his mother Elizabeth Pic@@ ci@@ uto did not know during her pregnancy .
when he came home for the first time , my first thought was , I did not .
I don &apos;t manage to do that .
then I did not let myself in .
&quot; &quot; &quot; what is not right at all -- of course you have been invited to it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
her husband Vincent and her was told that Ed@@ mund may never recognize her and that he may not even survive .
some doctors even went so far that they proposed to institution@@ alise him .
&quot; my first answer was &quot; I didn &apos;t know that people still do , &quot; &quot; explained Pic@@ ci@@ uto .
Ed@@ mund can run with the help of a side@@ walk .
Ed@@ mund could neither sit nor cra@@ w@@ l up to his third year of age and he can still not speak .
but he makes progress slowly .
it can run with support and cycle .
he also loves playing and singing with his two brothers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Elizabeth shows the sign language , which Ed@@ mund for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Please sing me something before &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we bring him drawing language to him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Pic@@ ci@@ uto C@@ BS News . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it is not a typical sign language -- says it . Ed@@ mund invented some characters alone .
micro@@ cep@@ hal@@ ia has a variety of causes : genetic as well as with Ed@@ mund and infection with viruses such as meas@@ les or c@@ ic@@ avi@@ rus during pregnancy .
symptoms and pro@@ gn@@ oses can vary greatly .
it is still too early to say how it will affect the life of infected people with the Z@@ ik@@ avi@@ rus .
Pic@@ ci@@ uto is remin@@ is@@ cent of the emotional price of an un@@ certain future .
I constantly asked what will happen ?
what will happen ?
and she still does not really know .
I have not asked for the prog@@ no@@ sis for a long time , because I do not expect them to really tell me .
but Pic@@ ci@@ uto has a hop@@ eful advice for mothers of inf@@ ants with birth defects caused by the Z@@ ik@@ avi@@ rus .
it gets better .
you know it will become better for you .
you will love your child and your child will love you .
heavy ra@@ inf@@ alls , floo@@ ding gives cause for b@@ ail@@ outs in Lou@@ is@@ iana , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi
heavy ra@@ inf@@ alls and large @-@ area floo@@ ds in Lou@@ is@@ iana forced the governor to call on the emergency room on Friday . it is expected all Saturday about with more rain falls .
numerous rivers in the south @-@ east Lou@@ is@@ i@@ anas and the south of the Miss@@ issi@@ pp@@ is floo@@ ded their banks and threatened with large @-@ area floo@@ ds after extreme ra@@ inf@@ all , the National Weather Service reported .
the Gover@@ nor of Lou@@ is@@ iana John B@@ el Ed@@ wards informed that state officials are in constant contact with the local authorities and are already on the road to the affected communities .
Mike Ste@@ ele , a spokes@@ man for the Office of Hom@@ eland Security and Emer@@ gency Pre@@ par@@ edness of the governor , informed that the requests for flood vehicles , boats and sand@@ bags increased .
Ste@@ ele said that the municipality of Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa had claimed ten thousand sand@@ bags .
a flood warning system is used across large parts in the south of Lou@@ is@@ i@@ anas until Saturday .
the weather service left that additional 3 to 5 inches could drop in this area .
in the south of Al@@ ab@@ ama a flood warning system was used on Friday while it continued to rain in the Mobile area .
the river Com@@ ite near Bat@@ on Rou@@ ges and the river Am@@ ite near Den@@ ham Springs , both in Lou@@ is@@ iana , will probably reach record levels after the weekend .
the Met@@ ere@@ ologist Ale@@ k Kr@@ aut@@ mann says that both rivers are floo@@ ding many houses in the suburbs near Bat@@ on Rouge .
he also said that an up@@ stream @-@ directed floo@@ ding in Ascension Par@@ ish poses a danger , as these rivers are only slowly flowing into the Lake Mau@@ rep@@ as .
the river Tick@@ fa@@ w , south of the Miss@@ issi@@ ppi State Border in Liverpool , Lou@@ is@@ iana , reached the highest level already at 09.@@ 00 , which was ever recorded .
rescue teams still ple@@ d@@ ged people from floo@@ ding in Am@@ ite and Wil@@ k@@ inson in the southwest of Miss@@ issi@@ ppi .
L@@ ero@@ y Hans@@ ford , his wife and son @-@ son , were among those who were saved on Friday near Glo@@ ster .
Hans@@ ford , 62 , says that water from Beaver Creek that is usually more than 400 feet away from his house is rising overnight .
he said that another step @-@ of @-@ son @-@ son , who lives nearby , would have warned him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are aw@@ ake and the water g@@ lows and floo@@ ded , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hans@@ ford . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it reached my wa@@ ist .
his wife Hans@@ ford said that she had never seen such a flood of the river in the 48 years she lived there .
Hans@@ ford said he and his family members would have all disabilities and he would be the only one who can swim .
Hans@@ ford said that No@@ thel@@ fer had saved all three in a large military truck and brought them to the next fire station in Glo@@ ster , where they were accommod@@ ated until Friday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Kr@@ aut@@ mann said that the flood hit &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; quickly spread &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as there were still heavy ra@@ inf@@ alls and that the authorities were recommen@@ ding ev@@ acu@@ ation instructions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to Kr@@ aut@@ mann , an observer reported in the proximity of Liv@@ ing@@ stone from midnight to Friday morning of 13.@@ 75 inches .
Kr@@ aut@@ mann said that the ground was considerably s@@ worn by the ra@@ inf@@ all since Wednesday .
the authorities announced that heavy ra@@ inf@@ alls and street floo@@ ds caused the rescue of inhabitants from their homes in Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa Par@@ ish and lesson in five school districts .
the C@@ BS subsidiary WW@@ L reported that a co @-@ ordin@@ ate in Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa caused 200 floo@@ ded houses .
the inhabitants were ev@@ acu@@ ated in two churches which were both floo@@ ded .
the leader of Rob@@ by Miller community said that the authorities saved 72 people and seven pets that were washed by floo@@ ds .
in the cities of Am@@ ite and Ham@@ mond , emergency shel@@ ters were set up to accommodate the ev@@ acu@@ ations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as soon as the water begins to go back , they will be able to go back to their homes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the town of Ham@@ mond of the municipality of Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa , almost two dozen roads were closed due to the floo@@ ds and sand bags for the inhabitants are provided , who hope to keep the water from their houses and shops .
&quot; the last big flood we had was in March , &quot; said L@@ acy Land@@ rum from the municipal administration .
this seems to be a similar incident .
in Miss@@ issi@@ pp , the emergency manager Rupert L@@ acy of Har@@ rison Coun@@ t@@ ys said that it continued to rain on the Gulf Coast .
according to his statements , a hand@@ ful of houses were reported to be floo@@ ded on Thursday , but there were no signs on Friday .
Keit@@ h Tow@@ n@@ son , manager at Shop@@ per Value F@@ oods in Am@@ ite , has been living in the area for 40 years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I saw water in places where I never saw it before , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tow@@ n@@ son , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and it is still coming . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mah@@ aj Brown , 6 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pier@@ ced by bul@@ lets &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; survived shooting in Philadelphia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police said that the 6 @-@ year @-@ old boy was shot in Philadelphia this week already the second time that a 6 @-@ year @-@ old child is shot .
the grand@@ parents of the boy identified him for C@@ BS Philadelphia as Mah@@ aj Brown .
the grand@@ parents pret@@ ended that Brown suffered several shot injuries including in the end , leg , arm and belly , but that he was in the hospital in his transport .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has gone through a lot , his little body was pier@@ ced by bul@@ lets , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shared his grand@@ mother Del@@ ores Mel@@ ende@@ z to the transmitter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I can simply not believe it .
the condition of the boy was considered critical in a hospital and he had to undergo several operations .
the boy &apos;s family shared the station that he is expected to recover .
he would have started the first class in a local primary school .
brown was one of four people who were shot in German@@ town .
three men were also shot : two at the age of 29 and a 32 @-@ year @-@ old .
one of the 29 @-@ year @-@ old men is in critical condition ; the other two victims are in stable condition according to C@@ BS Philadelphia .
the boy was found on the front seat of a car along with the 29 @-@ year @-@ old who finds himself in a critical condition , reports the transmitter .
the other two victims were not found in the car and the police were investig@@ ating whether they could be among one of the injured men of the perpet@@ rators .
investig@@ ators shared C@@ BS Philadelphia that it seems to have come to a bon@@ fire between several sho@@ ot@@ ers .
cartridge fill@@ ers for assault ri@@ fl@@ es , which were trac@@ ed back to various assault ri@@ fl@@ es , over@@ se@@ wed the crime scene .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it seems that this is clearly an ongoing struggle . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the street , on both sides of the side@@ walk , H@@ ül@@ sen took place .
thus , there seems to have been several armed fighters , who were very active , &quot; shared police spokes@@ man Anthony Gin@@ al@@ di of the police in Philadelphia the broad@@ c@@ aster .
there were also several houses and vehicles in the area .
there was no fixed income and the police are now sc@@ rut@@ in@@ ising the surveillance video .
on Tuesday , another 6 @-@ year @-@ old girl was hit by a cross @-@ sle@@ dge at the arm when she played in front of her house in the residential area of West Oak Lane .
it reco@@ vers and the police are still searching for a susp@@ ect .
why we need Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie
that is what I present under the Women &apos;s Olympics in the Tur@@ ning and that is for more than one reason .
first , I have been at every summer Olympics since 1984 and the US has never been so dominant .
and secondly : this team has three gymn@@ asts , Simone Bil@@ es , Gab@@ by Douglas and Lau@@ ren &quot; Lau@@ rie &quot; Her@@ nan@@ dez , who were inspiring for many young girls of other skin colours .
the structure of this team , the A@@ ly R@@ ais@@ man , the Jü@@ din is and Ma@@ dison Ko@@ cian , who is Cath@@ o@@ lic@@ ine , makes everyone proud .
this team is finally reflected in the US .
it has soli@@ di@@ fied the black and H@@ isp@@ anic female presence at the top of this sport .
in the last four years the number one among female gymn@@ ast@@ ics was an A@@ fr@@ o @-@ American .
last year Simone and Gab@@ by # 1 and # 2 were .
this shows strength .
during the last Olympic Games , Gab@@ by Douglas was a surprising Olympi@@ ah@@ winner and America che@@ ered .
now the world was able to witness the incredible performance of the triple world champion@@ ships Simone Bil@@ es , Douglas and Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , how they were unexpected , but master@@ ful gy@@ ros routines .
on Thursday Simone was the fourth , h@@ eter@@ os@@ ex@@ ual American , who won gold at an individual event for women .
team member A@@ ly R@@ ais@@ man won silver .
we experience the top of this sport , but we do not see gymn@@ asi@@ um classes all over the country .
Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie beat all the same way as A@@ ly and Ma@@ dison to create it into the Olympic team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they are the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Last Five &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; because the next Olympic team will only have four gymn@@ asts in the team . furthermore , this is the last year with Mart@@ a Kar@@ ol@@ yi as a trainer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the reality looks like gymn@@ asts are a more expensive sport and gymn@@ asts are primarily in private sports clubs , which are maintained by parents who pay for training , orientation , travel clothing , competition and hotel costs ( for the trainers and their gymn@@ asts and families ) .
the majority of these gymn@@ ast@@ ics lie in weal@@ thy suburbs that can support the business .
in these clubs , the gymn@@ asts get their complete training and this is an expensive and long @-@ term commitment to the families .
A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ man , trainer of Simone Bil@@ es , and Mag@@ gie Han@@ ey , trainer of Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , have trained their athletes since they started with the gymn@@ asi@@ um .
we need to au@@ n the churches au@@ n inn@@ um@@ erable , young girls , who are inspired by Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie , an affordable and easily accessible gymn@@ asi@@ um .
I founded my TR@@ G of 20 years .
during my events , we have offered free and affordable gymn@@ asts in Harlem for more than 15,@@ 000 urban juni@@ ors ( especially black and h@@ isp@@ anic ) and national and international winners .
in September we will expand to Det@@ ro@@ it ( my hom@@ etown ) to offer youth high @-@ quality gymn@@ ast@@ ics offering the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport .
gymn@@ ast@@ ics develops strength , flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work , discipline and determination for the mind .
this combination offers life @-@ long benefits for health as well as for academic and professional success .
it is the inspiration of this team that brings thousands of young girls to be interested in the gymn@@ ast@@ ics and that &apos;s great .
it is so important to participate in sports , especially for girls .
this is such an exciting time .
thanks Simone , A@@ ly , Lau@@ rie , Gab@@ by and Ma@@ dison for this real representation of &quot; Girl Power &quot; by the Hol@@ en des Olympic team @-@ gol@@ ds and thank you , you motivated so many young girls with different backgrounds to start their way to become healthy , strong and successful young women .
assistance doctors want to organize more strikes after rej@@ ecting Jerem@@ y Hun@@ ts &apos;s proposal
the ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the changes by adop@@ ting a re@@ formed agreement with the function@@ aries of the British Medical Association , but 58 percent of the 37,@@ 000 Assi@@ stance physicians who voted in a election refused to dism@@ iss him .
in July H@@ unt plans un@@ vei@@ led the agreement to introduce the treaty and said that the N@@ HS was in a &quot; Ni@@ em@@ and@@ s@@ land &quot; and would be dam@@ aging any further delay for the employees and patients .
the first resident doctors should receive a new contract , which includes changes to night and weekend work to improve the care of un@@ even times .
DR Ellen Mc@@ Court , the chairman of the B@@ MA committee for assistance doctors shared last night in a communication with : &quot; Assist@@ enz@@ ologists have still considered serious concerns about the proposed contract , in particular that it will address the current availability crisis and administ@@ er it to treat all doctors . &quot;
with only eight weeks remaining until the first group of doctors will fall under the new contract , progress must be made and the time runs out .
efforts on the part of the B@@ MA to resolve disputes by calling on the government to participate and sometimes de@@ af@@ ening silence .
this happened that of a promise that Jerem@@ y H@@ unt had made about the last month that his door would always be open .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Jerem@@ y H@@ unt has to act now to lift up the condition and address the wor@@ ries of the assistant doctors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if he did not do this , the assistant doctors have made it clear that they are ready to perform further work steps .
the last strike at the end of April saw a delay of nearly 13,@@ 000 routine operations and 100,000 appointments , since nur@@ ses and specialists were involved in order to cover doctors on the strip of strips .
the ministers had hoped to termin@@ ate the dispute over the changes by adop@@ ting the re@@ formed agreement with the function@@ aries of the British Medical Association .
the B@@ MA would like to pay a better weekly re@@ mun@@ eration for the 54.@@ 000 assi@@ sts who are subject to the contract .
Daniel Mor@@ timer , Director General of the N@@ HS Staff , asked the assist@@ ants to stop the strike .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mor@@ timer said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; working @-@ fighting measures do not achieve anything of only little , but already burden exagger@@ ated teams and service providers and prepare the patient , nur@@ ses and their families only concerned , dist@@ ress and inter@@ ruption . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
during the last two months , we talked to the assistant tee of the Assistant Doc@@ tors and responded positively to the concerns regarding the tut@@ el@@ age and W@@ hist@@ leb@@ y@@ ings with the Ministry of Health and other minist@@ ries .
employers hoped that continuing positive commitment to other important subjects - such as deployment , flexibility in training , training k@@ ills , mutual recognition of the cur@@ riculum , training education and gender @-@ specific pay gap in medicine - were a sign of how serious it was the employers , the Health Education England and the Ministry of Health regarding compliance with the B@@ MA in November , February and May .
the £ 2 @-@ per day medication that can reduce heart risk
thousands of heart attack patients will benefit from a £ 2 @-@ per day drug after recommended by the authorities to administ@@ er this more people for a longer period of time .
the anti @-@ inflammatory drug T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or reduces the risk of repeated heart attacks for persons with heart disease .
the medication is administ@@ ered for 12 months after a heart attack , reducing the risk of stroke or another heart attack .
the N@@ HS Reg@@ ul@@ atory Authority has recommended a four @-@ year intake to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
the N@@ HS Reg@@ ul@@ atory Authority has recommended a four @-@ year intake to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
every year around 14@@ 0,000 people suffer a heart attack and a quarter of it suffer a further heart attack or stroke .
heart attacks and stro@@ kes are caused by accum@@ ulations of fatty material in the arter@@ ial walls that form floor@@ ings .
when the layer breaks apart , it can cause a cl@@ ots of blood , which c@@ ents blood flow to the heart and causes a heart attack .
when the blood cl@@ ots dis@@ sol@@ ves , it can flow through the blood@@ stream and stop the blood flow to the brain , causing a stroke .
people who already had a heart attack are subject to a higher risk another .
T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , which is produced by the British company A@@ stra@@ Zen@@ eca and is mark@@ eted under the trade name Bri@@ li@@ que , reduces this risk by making the formation of blood cl@@ ots more likely .
the release of NI@@ CE , which was published today , recommends a 12 @-@ month intake of 90@@ mg T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , followed by 60mg with a twice daily intake of aspir@@ in for the next three years .
Professor Car@@ ole Long@@ son , Director of the NI@@ CE health technology evaluation centre said : &quot; despite the availability of secondary prevention , a quarter of all individuals who have suffered a heart attack or stroke - often have disast@@ rous consequences . &quot;
the fear of a renewed heart attack can have significant negative effects on the quality of life of a person .
the experience shows that T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or is effective in combination with aspir@@ in effectively in reducing further heart attacks and stro@@ kes in people who already had a heart attack .
due to a pro@@ visional recommendation from T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or we are pleased that we are able to expand available treatment options to thousands of people who can benefit from this .
the information on the efficacy and safety of T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or - above all the risk of blood - is limited to a period of up to three years .
culture of Political Cor@@ rec@@ tness allows bal@@ dness to flour@@ ish in Muslim areas
the former mayor of Tower Ham@@ lets Lut@@ zu Rah@@ man was removed last year following a government report for corruption from office
a culture of political Cor@@ rec@@ tness has led to the fact that widespread elec@@ toral fraud in Muslim communities is kno@@ w@@ ingly ignored just like a cr@@ ushing government report today .
the former cabinet of cabinet , Sir Eric Pic@@ kl@@ es , inter@@ ven@@ es the police , elec@@ toral ob@@ servers and town halls to have ignor@@ ant evidence of elec@@ toral mis@@ use due to &quot; hyper@@ sensiti@@ v@@ ities regarding eth@@ nic@@ ity and religion . &quot;
the former Minister for Integration and Commun@@ al Government , which is now an anti @-@ corruption affair , said that the inti@@ mid@@ ation of vot@@ ers from religious motives was so bad that the police should be allowed to set up shut@@ ters outside of constitu@@ encies to guard inti@@ mid@@ ated vot@@ ers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he recommends that vot@@ ers should lead a passport to prove their identity in elections . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the moment a vot@@ er must simply name his name and address . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the report propos@@ es not removing removable inks on a person &apos;s fingers when they vote their votes in order to prevent someone cho@@ oses twice .
wh@@ ist@@ le@@ blo@@ wers should receive more protection , says Sir Eric .
it demands that the press should have more access to community documents and decisions of non @-@ official committees or working groups .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this not only serves to fraud , but also to protect the local government from wider corruption and financial fraud that is associated with it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the report was arranged by Dow@@ ning Street as a result of Tower Ham@@ lets elec@@ toral sc@@ and@@ als in the east of London .
last year , a special elec@@ toral court ruled that the reign@@ ing mayor Lut@@ a Rah@@ man should be contained in a lit@@ any to corrupt and illegal practices of his ministry .
the Court found that Rah@@ man had per@@ ver@@ ted the religious sen@@ ti@@ ments of his Muslim community in a cy@@ n@@ ical way , and that he had sil@@ enced his critics with rac@@ ism and Islam@@ opho@@ bic accus@@ ations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Rah@@ man shall have led &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his campaign on the basis that it is the reli@@ ant duty of Muslims to elect him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
up to 300 voices were either dou@@ bt@@ ful or the consequence of an im@@ itation in which one person cho@@ oses another .
Sir Eric said that there was evidence for fraud throughout the country .
he especially expressed al@@ arm@@ ingly for the dec@@ eit@@ ful letter of letters - among the older members of the Muslim community had made pressure on people to choose a candidate of their choice .
Sir Eric , m@@ apped , made several recommendations to pur@@ ify the elec@@ toral system , including fail@@ ing to prove the identity
in his report , it is said : &quot; as evidence has been placed that pressure on vulnerable members of some ethnic minorities has been exerc@@ ised , especially women and young people , in order to choose according to the Will of the El@@ der , in particular communities with Pakistan &apos;s or Banglad@@ es@@ hi background .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there were concerns that ... governmental institutions have ignored such conduct on the basis of &quot; politically correct &quot; hyper@@ sensiti@@ v@@ ities regarding eth@@ nic@@ ity and religion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sir Eric suggested 50 recommendations to pur@@ ify the system , including the prohibition that political activists deal with letter papers to stop &quot; election harvest . &quot;
the report held by Ther@@ esa May also requires tough@@ er registration checks to prevent the election directory to be used for immigration and social fraud purposes .
consider options to ask vot@@ ers before choosing your ID .
do not use removable ink on the finger of a person as soon as she has given her voice to prevent someone cho@@ oses twice .
systematic review of the nation@@ ality of a person to ensure that they are optional .
a three @-@ year limitation on applications on an automated letter selection .
bann@@ ing political activists to process full stamp reports and envel@@ op@@ es of letter elections .
the police give the authority to set up shut@@ dow@@ ns .
a change in the law which makes an accus@@ ation easier for inti@@ mid@@ ation in accordance with the Re@@ presentation of the People Act 1983 ( People &apos;s Auth@@ orities Act 1983 ) .
Fot@@ ograf@@ ier@@ ver@@ bot in Wahl@@ stationen
requirement that only English may be used in the elec@@ toral stations ( with the exception of Wales ) .
intensi@@ fication of the training to ensure that the employees are generally en@@ forced that vot@@ ers alone go to the bal@@ lot box alone .
Sir Eric falls over the Metropolitan Police and finds it &quot; aston@@ ishing &quot; that after the Tower Ham@@ lets case there was no criminal complaint .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the elec@@ toral court has declared Lut@@ an Rah@@ man and his dep@@ uty for a lit@@ any to corrupt and illegal practices , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
due to a number of reasons , he was found guilty for a number of reasons - according to the high demands in criminal proceedings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he also critic@@ ises the effective &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shut @-@ off controls &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the elec@@ toral clearing departments of the town halls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Sir Eric said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the court sentence in Tower Ham@@ lets from last year was a warning signal . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our country carries as the mother of parli@@ aments a proud heritage , but the wor@@ rying and ob@@ sc@@ ure spread of elec@@ toral fraud and den@@ ial of some authorities thre@@ aten this good reputation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
crazy for K@@ ates Rad@@ ler @-@ Doppel@@ gän@@ ger and other famous Doppel@@ gän@@ ger from Olympi@@ as@@ port@@ lern in Rio
fans of the 2016 Olympics in Rio came out this week via the French cycl@@ ist Pau@@ line Ferr@@ and @-@ Pre@@ v@@ ot , except the edge and the band , which proved to be an impressive double @-@ end of the Du@@ chess of Cambridge .
but the 24 @-@ year @-@ old Olymp@@ ion@@ ik@@ in is by far not the only gold @-@ fighting ath@@ l@@ ete , who has its own famous Doppel@@ gän@@ ger - at least not , if one can give faith to the social media .
in honor of the Olympic Games in Rio and all the famous faces that fli@@ cker at the time on our screens , F@@ email has created a list of Olympi@@ ans that have more than just a certain simil@@ arity with Hollywood celebr@@ ities .
the h@@ unter and the wolf : team member of the U.S. team in ar@@ chery Br@@ ady Ell@@ ison , left , is compared with Leonardo Di@@ Cap@@ rio since childhood
except K@@ ate Doppel@@ gän@@ ger on the rac@@ et@@ rack , many people on the Internet pointed out how a certain ar@@ cher of the twin of A @-@ Pro@@ mi Leonardo Di@@ Cap@@ rio might be .
the team member of the U.S. team in ar@@ chery Br@@ ady Ell@@ ison caused a storm on Twitter after pictures on which he looks similar to the Wolf of Wall Street Star .
in fact , the arch@@ ers got the ins@@ anity into the social media and admitted that he has already heard since his childhood that he looks like Leo .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I do not see any great simil@@ arity , except for the facial hair , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Br@@ ady sent the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is a good @-@ looking guy , so I feel this as a compli@@ ment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
one of the most popular compar@@ isons since London 2012 will undoubtedly be the focus of this year : the striking simil@@ arity between the British Weit@@ spr@@ inger Gre@@ g Ru@@ ther@@ ford and the popular actor N@@ eil Patrick Harris .
the Russian gymn@@ ast Ali@@ ya Must@@ af@@ ina , with her big , expres@@ sive eyes , is to go through to the Cub@@ an @-@ American singer Gl@@ oria E@@ ste@@ fan .
and in the swimming pool , the South African swi@@ mmer Cameron van der Bur@@ gh has been compared with the Gle@@ e Star Matthew Mor@@ rison for years .
one ais@@ le higher : this user believes that Nathan is the &quot; athle@@ tic version &quot; of the In@@ ception actor
another continuous comparison was drawn between the tennis star Rafael Nad@@ al and actor Jos@@ h Hart@@ nett , who has similar severe eyeb@@ rows and lips .
the Russian silver med@@ al pool Y@@ uli@@ a E@@ f@@ im@@ ova has more than just the sun @-@ t@@ ann@@ ed skin and blond hair like the act@@ ress Ann@@ aly@@ n@@ ne Mc@@ Cor@@ d , while the American Nathan Adrian was attacked by fans , an &quot; athle@@ tic version of Joseph Gordon Lev@@ itt . &quot;
strong women : soccer star Hope Solo , left , and D@@ ex@@ ter act@@ ress Jen@@ ni@@ fer Car@@ p@@ enter , right , have a similar facial shape and eyes
not the only ones : a Twitter user was very happy that others also noticed the simil@@ arities
theory into the room : according to this user , there is perhaps one reason for the simil@@ arity of the couple .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a Twitter User@@ in explained their satisfaction that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the rest of the Internet thinks that Hope solo and Jen@@ ni@@ fer Car@@ p@@ enter are almost identical . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in fact , the US soccer star Hope solo and the D@@ ex@@ ter act@@ ress Jen@@ ni@@ fer Car@@ p@@ enter have an incredibly similar face @-@ face and eyes .
other popular compar@@ isons embr@@ aced K@@ err@@ i Wal@@ sh @-@ J@@ enn@@ ings and her smile , which is almost identical with the act@@ ress Laura Lin@@ ney as well as the gold med@@ alli@@ sts in the Tur@@ ning Gab@@ by Douglas , who has a beautiful , broad smile , similar to that of Br@@ ing It On Star Gabri@@ elle Union .
&quot; &quot; &quot; C@@ BC comment@@ ator for the Olympic Games ap@@ olog@@ ises for his statement that Chinese float &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a pig died . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
B@@ yr@@ on Mac@@ Don@@ al@@ ds analysis over the fourth place of 14 @-@ year @-@ old Ai Yan@@ han at d@@ r 4x@@ 200m release @-@ swi@@ mm@@ ed spect@@ ator of the C@@ BC @-@ live broadcast of the Ol@@ m@@ yp@@ hic Games on Wednesday
&quot; &quot; &quot; Canadian broad@@ c@@ aster C@@ BC had to ap@@ olog@@ ise after one of his comment@@ ators said that the 14 @-@ year @-@ old Chinese float &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; like M@@ ief &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and during the race as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a pig died . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the comment@@ ator B@@ yr@@ on Mac@@ Don@@ al@@ ds thought that his microphone was off when he left off his own opinions at the end of the 4x@@ 200m .
Mac@@ Donald who had been brought on board in the commentary team of the C@@ BS to give more &quot; colour &quot; could be heard say : &quot; this little 14 @-@ year old Chin@@ es@@ in has lost the connection , baby . &quot;
too excited , went away like M@@ ief , died like a pig .
thanks for it .
the Chinese float in Ai Yan@@ han , 14 , sw@@ am the second stage of the swimming arm 1 : 57,@@ 79 - 1,@@ 61 seconds s@@ lower than Canada &apos;s Taylor Ru@@ ck , which enabled the Canadi@@ ans to shut the gap to China .
spectators across Canada quickly re@@ acted after they were sho@@ cked by the sound and language
&quot; &quot; &quot; Em@@ met@@ t Mac@@ far@@ lane twe@@ ete , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ as the C@@ BC comment@@ ator just said that 14 @-@ year @-@ old swi@@ mmer from China &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a pig died &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ? ? ? ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the I@@ di@@ ot has not capit@@ alized that they were still on show . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ai Yan@@ han from China was described as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this little 14 year old Chin@@ es@@ in has lost the connection , baby . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the cr@@ iti@@ que against B@@ yr@@ on Mac@@ Donald on Twitter came quickly and hard , with which many of them talked about
twitter users didn &apos;t think back when they heard how in@@ sensitive B@@ yr@@ on Mac@@ Donald was
another Twitter User@@ in Sarah Paradi@@ s wrote : &quot; w@@ ow , # By@@ ron@@ Mac@@ Donald .
you represent the C@@ BC and Canada and lets us look like R@@ assi@@ sts . # ange@@ ek@@ elt .
shortly afterwards Scott Rus@@ sel ap@@ ologi@@ zed for the C@@ BC broadcast , live for the comment of Mac@@ Donald and said : &quot; we ap@@ ologi@@ ze that the comment on a swimming capacity was broad@@ cast@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was an un@@ happy chosen formulation , we are sorry that it happened . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
sorry , there is no translation for this news @-@ article .
the commentary colony Scott Rus@@ sel had to ap@@ ologi@@ ze on behalf of Mac@@ Donald
C@@ BC copied and added his exc@@ use to more than 90 other Twitter users compl@@ aining about Mac@@ Donald &apos;s comments
the network also ap@@ ologi@@ zed quickly and gave a message .
we regret that these statements were made and that it was made possible that they will be broadcast .
yesterday night we ap@@ ologi@@ zed to our audience on show and our fol@@ lo@@ wer@@ n in the social media .
to clarify one , B@@ yr@@ on &apos;s comments related to the performance of the swi@@ mm@@ ers and not on them as a person .
nevertheless , they were in@@ appropriate and an un@@ happy wording . B@@ yr@@ on does what he said , very sorry .
on Thursday afternoon Mac@@ Donald ap@@ ologi@@ zed and tried to justify his re@@ mark by saying that it was not his intention that it was designed as a personal attack .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would like to take a moment to ap@@ ologi@@ ze for the comment I made after the women &apos;s swimming pool in the C@@ BC Olymp@@ is@@ endung , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I focused on the performance of the swi@@ mm@@ ers and not on them as a person . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; of course , no cont@@ emp@@ t was intended and I am very sorry . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
buyer in Pri@@ mark so@@ aring over woman who tried under@@ wear in the middle of business
the buyers did not know where to go , when a woman went out to dress her clothes in the midst of a priest to try the pants .
to wor@@ sen the situation , she insp@@ ected how she looked in it , pulled it out and put her back to the shelf .
she continued to rum@@ mage and tried four pairs of pants in a shop at the Bou@@ ver@@ ie Place Shopping Centre in Folk@@ estone .
the Pri@@ mark Shop in the Bou@@ ver@@ ie Place Shopping Centre in Folk@@ estone , where the woman tried the pants before she put her back into the shelf
a mother of two children , J@@ enny Davi@@ dson , who was in business at the same time , said that after the mysterious woman had tried under@@ wear , &quot; she d@@ anced and left the business without purchasing something . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The people could not believe what they saw . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
standing in the middle of the sales area , she took a pair of pants from the out@@ lay , pulled out her own h@@ ul@@ ls and trousers and tried them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she did not even try to find a somewhat dis@@ crete place to do it - she just stood there , like O@@ sk@@ ar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; everyone star@@ ed when she pulled out the pants that you obviously didn &apos;t like , as she put her back on the shelf . &quot;
she repeated the same with three other pants before she finally decided that her did not fall back and r@@ ushed out .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she did not seem to inter@@ fere with anyone watching - or thinking about the person who under certain circumstances would buy the pants they had tried . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ms. Davi@@ dson , 33 , who lives in K@@ ent , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how to think that someone would take shelter with someone who had another person and who were not washed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the incident occurred on Tuesday afternoon .
Davi@@ dson &quot; Davi@@ dson &quot; added : &quot; as I got along , the employees tried to pull the garments out of the sale after she went - which is just as good . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would hate to go home with a new pair of pants and find out that another woman had touched her and retired and she was not washed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a spokes@@ man from Pri@@ mark said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pri@@ mark is aware of the incident that occurred on Tuesday , 9 August at our branch in Folk@@ stone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

how to protect oneself with Kra@@ v Mag@@ a against weapons attacks
the world outside is a dangerous place , but this video from D@@ ail@@ y@@ mail@@ .com could make him safer for you .
we spoke with Rh@@ one Mi@@ z@@ ra@@ chi , a Grand@@ master of Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Ver@@ ban@@ des in New York to find out how to deal with armed rob@@ bers at close distance .
regardless of whether you approach you from the front or from behind , this video will show you how to turn the sk@@ e@@ wer for your rob@@ ber .
when you approach you from behind , you should turn around as first , so that you can see your att@@ acker and &quot; go out of the shot line , &quot; says Mi@@ z@@ ra@@ chi .
grab the weapon between your fore@@ arm and shoulder before you face it with your free el@@ bow .
hit him with the knee in the bar and twist , while the att@@ acker is cur@@ vy of pain , the gun comes out of his hands . hit him with the run into the face and move back@@ wards as she dire@@ cts the weapon to him .
when att@@ ack@@ ers approaching from the front , the technique is similar - move your body out of the shot line , grab the weapon and twist it so that the att@@ acker cannot shoot .
at the same time , shift the weight onto the weapon and hit the att@@ acker onto the chest , then turn the weapon out of its grip before moving back@@ wards and put the weapon on it .
sounds difficult ?
watch the video to see exactly how Mi@@ z@@ ra@@ chi is doing .
but remember that it is saf@@ est for a rob@@ ber@@ y to cover your money - unless you are a Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Grand@@ master .
trav@@ eller Ian W@@ right sh@@ ab@@ t for a travel guide his tongue at the most dir@@ ti@@ est places in Europe
a British trav@@ eller under@@ went his immune system and wor@@ ms of a serious test by le@@ aking some of the dir@@ ti@@ est and most det@@ est places in Europe .
the moder@@ ator and travel author Ian W@@ right , 51 , from Su@@ ff@@ ol@@ k cut off his course on a Euro @-@ Sch@@ ein , a rail@@ ing at Pic@@ ca@@ dil@@ ly Cir@@ cus , a r@@ ins@@ ing kno@@ b of a train toilet and a public telephone in Russia to demonstrate the resistance of his immune system .
in front of the le@@ ak@@ age of each object he used a L@@ umin@@ ometer to show himself and us on what he is going to get involved .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but the experiment that was fil@@ med under the title &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The L@@ ick@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; brought some surprising results to the daylight . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the thought of le@@ aching the r@@ ins@@ ing kno@@ b of a traction toilet , which has already been used by thousands of others , may be completely rep@@ ul@@ sive , but in fact there are more bad bacteria in a kitchen sink .
on his journey through Europe , Mr. W@@ right spoke to doctors and healthcare professionals about the promotion of intestinal bacteria as well as their own health .
fortunately , nothing left what he li@@ cked , more than a bad after@@ taste in the mouth .
Mr. W@@ right was known to test the robu@@ st@@ ness of his bo@@ wel by travelling through the world and ate peculi@@ ar and wonderful things .
from public rail@@ ings to train stations to sin@@ ks of toilets , the task put its immune system defin@@ iti@@ vely under one sample
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the movie he told : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; already as a child I was relatively un@@ concerned about what my health concerns and I have put all sorts of things in my mouth , earth , wor@@ ms and mud water . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the film , he was able to do justice to his reputation .
the only thing he refused was a dirty public toilet in Russia .
its test layer showed a lumin@@ ance of more than 4000 units .
compared to this , the L@@ umin@@ ometer @-@ number of newly washed hands is less than 60 .
but there was a Russian toilet that he refused to lick off after their lumin@@ ance was over 4000 units , while freshly washed hands have one of less than 60 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mr W@@ right and Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Vali@@ o produced the travel film &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The L@@ ick@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which shows the number of bacteria in different places like the bathroom . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the film he says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It comes close to the worst that I have cleaned in a toilet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is nothing more dirt than that !
I will not dock here , because it is in@@ deli@@ bly ec@@ lec@@ tic here .
&quot; the L@@ ick@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength &quot; was produced in cooperation with the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Vali@@ o .
the company equi@@ ps Mr. W@@ right with Vali@@ o Ge@@ fil@@ us , which includes lac@@ tic acid bacteria and vitamin C and D to support intestinal bacteria and immune system .
vali@@ os Senior Venice President for snacks , ju@@ ices and new categories Nik@@ o Vu@@ or@@ ma@@ a says : &quot; we wanted to offer consumers something new .
something that is fascinating to look at and at the same time explains the advantages of pro@@ biot@@ ics .
we performed crazy Bra@@ inst@@ or@@ m@@ ings that ended up saying that we told &quot; L@@ ass us Ian . &quot;
they claim that the interest in gut health becomes a global phenomenon
instead of talking about the products we wanted to put them into a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday surroundings , the importance of gut health and how it is linked to the immune system .
the growing interest in gut health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary , we were able to provide consumers with more information in an interesting way .
I also think the film shows that we have a great sense of hum@@ our !
Tom Hak@@ ala , who led the film director , added : &quot; let me say so - I would have lost my respect for Ian if he had awak@@ ened some of the things I had instruc@@ ted him , just like the ec@@ lec@@ tic Russian toilet that is shown in the film . &quot;
of course there were things in which it was easier to put Ian to le@@ ak them and others in which this was quite difficult .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m glad we recorded some of these dirty goo@@ dies on film . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a survey conducted by Vali@@ o in 2015 84 percent of all asked lac@@ tic acid bacteria associated with the well @-@ being of the stomach and intest@@ ines and 58 percent said that at least occasionally they use products containing added lac@@ tic acid bacteria .
as@@ o@@ zi@@ ale family destroyed before Del@@ o@@ gi@@ erung social housing in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall
an as@@ o@@ zi@@ al family left her social housing after a del@@ o@@ gi@@ erung with a damage of £ 50,000 because she had terror@@ ized her neigh@@ bors .
T@@ anya Skel@@ don and her partner Sh@@ au@@ n Tre@@ bil@@ cock were thrown after a long list of complaints from their property in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall .
after they were ab@@ orted by force from their property , the housing association found the property in an ir@@ repar@@ able condition .
the walls pointed ar@@ round holes , wooden pl@@ anks were torn , rub@@ b@@ ish was scattered on the floor and gra@@ ff@@ iti was lubri@@ cated to the walls .
the family have been moved and it is assumed that she now lives in a private accommodation
Donn@@ a Mc@@ E@@ vo@@ y , who works for the management of Corn@@ wall Housing , said that she was afraid that the apartment was no longer repaired .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It was a night@@ mare for the people here and I think people don &apos;t have to live in this way . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are many things to consider since this estate is probably considered not as beautiful as Corn@@ wall .
the family is not@@ orious and their reputation is also .
the couple had three sons , who meanwhile lived in the apartment and the police said that the terror that the family had added , street fights with bas@@ eb@@ all bats , inti@@ mid@@ ation of residents , drug abuse , drug traff@@ icking and excessive scre@@ aming , spreading and flu@@ chen .
in June , Skel@@ don , 47 , whose name was on the lease , had an arrangement for ant@@ iso@@ cial behaviour in June .
in some rooms of the house , which will be demol@@ ished under certain circumstances , old rub@@ b@@ ish was found
in the estate , in which drugs were trad@@ ed in the past , the wooden pl@@ anks were torn down
neighbours said they had to fight them on the streets and regularly inv@@ oked the police .
Corn@@ wall Housing co@@ ined her and her partner this week for@@ ci@@ bly from the property after having given them an extended period of 11 weeks to volunteer .
the Del@@ o@@ gi@@ erung were che@@ ered by facilit@@ ated neigh@@ bors who said that their life was made to hell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; They don &apos;t care for anyone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we lived 20 years beside them and it was always bad .
the countless times we tell the police here are incredible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we could not sleep this morning . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we stood up because it was so quiet here - we are not used to it !
now , where they are finally gone , it will be beautiful .
Adam F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck , Nei@@ gh@@ bour@@ hood En@@ forcement Manager of Corn@@ wall Housing , said that it had been administ@@ ered by the family with local authorities .
the family lived in the house where the police were called at regular intervals , for 20 years
gar@@ bage and old toys were thrown down on the over@@ grown side of the community .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a shame that the ten@@ ant so@@ ws to accept any responsibility for their behaviour and family as a del@@ o@@ gi@@ ance is always the last step of taking account of the Corn@@ wall Housing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this was a very difficult case , because the behavior was extreme and their deeds had to be looked horri@@ bly for their neigh@@ bors .
I appreciate all the work my team , the police of De@@ von and Corn@@ wall , as well as members of the community that have cour@@ age@@ ously moved to us and gave us the information .
I hope this development will give comfort to some neigh@@ bors and the message convey@@ s that ant@@ iso@@ cial behaviour will not be toler@@ ated .
F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck said that all three sons had lived at different times in the house , but that they were all over 20 .
a dirty mattress resi@@ ding in one of the bedrooms of the house after the Del@@ o@@ gi@@ erung on the floor
workers of the house administration will now have to dig rub@@ b@@ ish mountains surrounding the house
in 2014 , the police launched a raid on the house and found more than 70@@ g cannabis as well as scales , par@@ ap@@ her@@ it@@ alia and cash in the amount of £ 1,@@ 700 .
Skel@@ don was given a fine of money after having found guilty of the possession of a class B drug in trade @-@ confidence .
she claimed that the money was for a tom@@ b@@ stone of her son Lee Skel@@ don , who came to life in 2013 in a car accident .
after they were without shelter , T@@ anya and her partner are now living in a private accommodation in Pl@@ ym@@ outh .
many rooms of the house were decorated with gra@@ ff@@ iti .
the police said they will don@@ ate ten@@ ants who do not stick to the house rules
Angela C@@ row from the police of De@@ von and Corn@@ wall told that the deleg@@ ations were a clear warning to the other ten@@ ants who do not stick to the house rules .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this goes to those who think they can act without self @-@ repro@@ aches as well as those who have been har@@ med by such a behavior , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police of De@@ von and Corn@@ wall will never toler@@ ate criminal and anti @-@ social behavior that continue to work with partners to protect our communities .
tourists visiting Portugal in pan@@ ic after an eff@@ ected military jet flies the beach
Sonnen@@ an@@ bet@@ er in Av@@ eiro , Portugal experienced the shock of her life
a portu@@ g@@ is@@ i@@ esch@@ es P @-@ 3@@ C Ori@@ on plane of air forces laid an unbelie@@ vable storm
the air forces stated that it was on a training flight , but insist@@ ed that there was no security risk .
this was the moment in which fri@@ ghtened tourists start to pan@@ ic after a ti@@ dy jet over@@ thro@@ ws over a full beach .
dramatic video sho@@ ots showed how the military aircraft fle@@ w almost in close proximity to the sun @-@ wor@@ ship@@ pers on the beach in Av@@ eiro in the north of Portugal .
the vac@@ ation@@ ers jump@@ ed up when they started to worry about the noise of the jet engines , without seeing what came through the clouds .
the incident happened yesterday afternoon in Costa Nova , near Av@@ eiro .
Daniel Fern@@ andes , one of the many ho@@ liday@@ makers who posted videos on the dramatic fly @-@ by in the social media , said : &quot; it fle@@ w two times really very deep and there was a moment when it looked like it would crash . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; N@@ uno Arro@@ yo added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was on surfing and it felt like the plane would fall on me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
tourists at the beach of Av@@ eiro were shi@@ fted in pan@@ ic when the plane came out of the darkness and flying incredibly deep
the Portuguese air forces today announced that the pilot of the P @-@ 3@@ C Ori@@ on aircraft was on a training flight to identify fishing boats off the coast and so far had to fly so deeply that this was the only way to recognize them .
the speaker said that , due to the poor visibility of the area , the jet had a little deeper than usual , but the air forces insist@@ ed that safety at no time was at risk .
area fires have destroyed parts of the Portuguese mainland during these summer , where also four people on Madeira Island came to death .
the Portuguese air forces today announced that the pilot had to fly as deeply because of the conditions - heavy fog and fire smoke - which restri@@ cts his view .
the plane was on a training flight where the pilot had to identify fishing boats as part of the exercise
Super@@ cup : Bar@@ ca with worry about Sev@@ ille
Sevilla - FC Barcelona cho@@ oses the first step on Sunday to win the first victory in the new football season .
the Catal@@ ans enter the Spanish Super@@ cup in the du@@ el around the FC Sevilla , the re@@ play rises three days later at Camp No@@ u .
the dou@@ ble@@ winner must disp@@ ense with the subordin@@ ate Cup@@ fin@@ alist and ruling Europe @-@ League Champion among others to Ne@@ ym@@ ar who cont@@ ests the Olympic football tournament with Brazil .
also there is also Go@@ alie Marc @-@ Andr@@ e ter Ste@@ gen .
the German suffered a change in the knee in the training , with which the in@@ scription on Bar@@ ca was clar@@ ified at least for the benefit of Claudio Bra@@ vo .
the Chil@@ ean International and T@@ er Ste@@ gen vie for the status as number one in Barcelona for two years .
in this respect , Coach Luis En@@ rique under@@ took a clear decision and left Bra@@ vo in the le@@ ague , but in most other competitions , T@@ er Ste@@ gen will prevail .
before the first mandatory play of the new season , the Spanish Master doubts about the fitness level of the team who was hum@@ ili@@ ated on Saturday in a test game of Liverpool with 0 : 4 .
Li@@ onel Mess@@ i and Co. were not really convinced at the 3 : 2 in a rehear@@ sal at S@@ amp@@ dor@@ ia on Wednesday .
Sevilla once again has the 2 : 3 defeat after pro@@ long@@ ation in the European Super@@ cup against Real Madrid and stri@@ ves for the second triumph in &quot; Super@@ cop@@ a de Esp@@ ana . &quot;
Barcelona is with so far eleven successes of the record winner in this job .
mA Long in a le@@ ague table to table tennis gold

the 27 @-@ year @-@ old defeated their comp@@ atri@@ ot on Thursday in Rio de Jan@@ eiro in a single @-@ sided fin@@ als and &quot; defending champion &quot; Z@@ hang Ji@@ ke 4 : 0 ( 12.@@ 5.@@ 4.4 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; thus the world @-@ ranking @-@ first took the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Golden Grand Sl@@ am &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with successes at World Cup , World Cup , World @-@ Tour @-@ Fin@@ al@@ tur@@ nier and even Olympia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
bronze went to the Japanese Jun Mi@@ zu@@ ani .
the two Chinese made it as expected in the final game and made the title among themselves .
it was clear that for the third time in a row Chinese would fetch the single title in the sign of the Five Rings .
last non @-@ Chinese on the top Olympic staircase was the former SV@@ S @-@ N@@ Ö legi@@ on@@ ary Ry@@ u Se@@ ung @-@ min from South Korea .
mA and z@@ hang were left alone on the disk , between sets and time @-@ outs they had no co@@ aches .
they had with@@ drawn themselves to the grand@@ stand and left their prot@@ ectors in a fair competition alone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the matches so far I played for my country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the final I play for myself , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Z@@ hang fol@@ lic@@ ally . &quot; &quot; &quot;

mA had really strug@@ gled with his 28 @-@ year @-@ old opponent in the first movement .
then he determined the tempo on the plate and left Z@@ hang from there only a total of 13 points .
the su@@ peri@@ ority of Ma did not develop the expected ro@@ using match .
nevertheless , nevertheless , there were enough stunning ball @-@ changes to be seen .
Mi@@ zu@@ ani won the bronze game against the 40 @-@ year @-@ old Vladimir Sam@@ son@@ ov 4 : 1 .
in his quarter @-@ final against the German champion Dimit@@ ri@@ j Ov@@ t@@ char@@ ov , white r@@ uses had been drawn to a ri@@ b injury , after that in medical treatment , &quot; ultimately &quot; had to be satisfied with lead .
by the way , the Swedish Jan @-@ O@@ ve Wald@@ ner ( 38 / 2004 ) and Jör@@ gen Pers@@ son ( 42 / 2008 ) have become the Olympic @-@ Fourth of the Olympic @-@ Fourth .
Donald Tr@@ ump cle@@ ars major problems ″ in the election campaign
the leadership of the Republi@@ can re@@ public@@ ans is pl@@ agu@@ ed by massive wor@@ ries , even in traditional conservative states to lose their majority .
presidential candidate Donald Tr@@ ump announced the short@@ com@@ ings of his campaign in the Ut@@ ah re@@ publi@@ can stron@@ gh@@ old .
a rare moment in which usually large @-@ handed and self @-@ confident mul@@ tim@@ illi@@ on@@ aire vo@@ iced such a thing as concerns , as correspon@@ dents reported .
after having thrown 16 ri@@ vals out of the race in his own Republi@@ can camp , the doubts pers@@ ist in his success in the struggle for the White House .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have huge problems in Ut@@ ah , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tr@@ ump against evangel@@ ical Christians , who asked for support in major states such as Ohio , Florida or Virginia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
gu@@ ilt is wrong reports of his can@@ did@@ acy , he resum@@ ed his well @-@ known media .
re@@ publi@@ can stron@@ gh@@ old w@@ ack@@ ers
Ut@@ ah is usually a secure bank for the re@@ public@@ ans .
according to a survey conducted by Sur@@ vey@@ ard from June , Tr@@ ump and his competitors were syn@@ onymous with the Democrats , H@@ illary Clinton .
other institutes view Tr@@ ump in the front , but not by the distance that is common for Republi@@ can candidates in the federal state .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Arizona and Georgia are also regarded as endangered . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in an interview with the Sen@@ ders CN@@ BC Tr@@ ump answered the question of how he wanted to stop Clin@@ tons &apos;s rise again : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; just as I did before . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and if afterwards : this will be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; either successful &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or I will make a very nice , long holiday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he makes nothing else than &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; telling the truth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if it did not reach for him in the end for reasons of political correctness , that was fine , Tr@@ ump said further .
then I return to a very good way of life .
according to press reports , the party should have threatened the Tr@@ ump to paint money to support his campaign , he should not present any better demand .
instead of that , the candidates of the Re@@ public@@ ans wanted to attack the Congress more strongly than their arms .
Olympia : three @-@ can Frau@@ d bei Dop@@ ing @-@ Test
the I@@ OC intends to establish a disciplinary commission .
Kenya &apos;s athletes are threatening after the second dop@@ ing affair at the Olympic Games in Rio de Jan@@ eiro .
after a fraud attempt at a dop@@ ing control in the Olympic Village , Kenya has sent a trainer home .
the International Olympic Committee was able to immediately set up a commission of discipline in order to investigate the case .
a Ken@@ yan officials had told that the former Spr@@ inter and today &apos;s coach , John An@@ z@@ rah , had a urine test in the Olympic village under the name of the 800 @-@ metre runner F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ ich .
this was reported to the team leadership of Kenya by the dop@@ ing controllers .
the IA@@ AF World Association has asked the I@@ OC for information on the case to ex@@ ert their own investigations , sharing an IA@@ AF spokes@@ man .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; depending on the results of the study and the following actions of the I@@ OC the IA@@ AF will make an assessment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said it in an IA@@ AF declaration . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; he ( An@@ z@@ rah ) went to the dop@@ ing control station and acted as F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ ich , submitted the sample and signed , &quot; explained Ken@@ yan Chef de Mission Stephan Ara@@ p So@@ i .
he was in possession of the accred@@ itation of the ath@@ l@@ ete , who was on the list for the training control of the World Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing Agency .
F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ ich had become more than 800 meters in Beijing in 2015 .
four days before , the Ken@@ yan Leicht@@ athle@@ tik @-@ Del@@ eg@@ ation@@ sch@@ ef Michael Rot@@ ich had been de@@ duc@@ ted from the Rio games .
he is said to have informed about upcoming dop@@ ing tests against cash payments from his country .
according to media reports , he was report@@ edly arrested at his return to Nairobi &apos;s airport .
Kenya is already under special observation at the I@@ OC after numerous dop@@ ing tests .
with the announcement of the more than 2000 dop@@ ing target controls submitted by the I@@ OC in front of the Rio games , it was usually pointed out that athletes from Kenya and Russia are being targeted .
the World Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing Agency had exer@@ ted a lot of pressure on African country before sum@@ mer@@ ing in Brazil to create an anti @-@ dop@@ ing law and a functioning control system .
the law was adopted a few weeks before the Olympics .
as a result , the WA@@ DA Kenya accepted the list of countries whose dop@@ ing control con@@ form to the rules of WA@@ DA .
Kenya is considered a great runner nation .
athletes of the country won most med@@ als at the 2015 World Cup in Beijing .
in a series of television reports , the ARD repeatedly reported that dop@@ ing funds are easily accessible in Kenya and there should be a considerable ment@@ ality of sports fraud .
I@@ OC member Richard Po@@ und recently called for a similar investigation in Kenya as he had employed in Russian athle@@ tics .
it could be proven that in this sport @-@ art was nation@@ wide and systematically lo@@ op@@ ed .
Russian athletes were then excluded from the summer games .

in the Shakespeare @-@ Year the Salzburger Fest@@ spiele present the &quot; West Side Story &quot; with Tony and Maria as a trag@@ ic couple , similar to Romeo and Juli@@ et .
with it a surprising Ceci@@ lia Bart@@ oli .
a musical conqu@@ ers Salzburg : the &quot; West Side Story , &quot; Le@@ orn@@ ard Bern@@ st@@ eins &apos;s master@@ piece .
the artistic director , Ceci@@ lia Bart@@ oli , wanted to bring the musical into the temple of classical music and filled with the role of Mary a Jugend@@ traum .
in the orchestra pit the Sim@@ ón Bol@@ í@@ var Orchestra under the direction of the Venezu@@ el@@ an conductor Gust@@ av@@ o Du@@ dam@@ el : &quot; this music is full of rhythm , &quot; he war@@ ms .
we always say that it is very Latin @-@ American .
there are many Latin American ingredients in their pace and mel@@ ody .
it is a wonderful mix , the perfect recipe for our orchestra .
I would say that we really have am@@ ber music in our blood !
in this st@@ aging Bart@@ oli plays an older Maria .
she is remin@@ is@@ cent of her kindness with Tony , while the younger Maria plays and dances .
the role of Mary always fascinated me .
first , because they are musi@@ cally extraordinary !
and then there would be Mary &apos;s personality .
she says in her song : &quot; I feel pretty , oh so pretty , I feel pretty and wit@@ ty and bright . &quot;

it is such an honour for us to work with her .
it is an enorm@@ ously generous person .

conducting is a necessity for him .
you see it in each of his movements , in his eyes , it &apos;s his life !
it is such a huge opportunity to share this musical experience with him .
we both have a rather southern temper@@ ament , a fire , a passion and also a cheer@@ ful approach to life , which is very important at all !

London School Cities , which joined the IS , was killed in Syria
K@@ adi@@ za Sult@@ ana , one of three British school@@ girls who left London last year to join the IS , report@@ edly died in Syria .
the Tas@@ n@@ ime A@@ kun@@ je@@ e lawyer said that a few weeks ago her family passed from her death in Ra@@ q@@ q@@ a , Syria .
it was suspected that it was killed by a Russian air attack in Ra@@ q@@ q@@ a , the bul@@ war@@ k of the group in the country , IT@@ V News reported on Thursday .
Sult@@ ana was 17 years old and died shortly after her family returned to leave the war @-@ packed country and return to England .
&quot; one can only hope that the only good lies in it - as a warning and warning to others that these are the risks associated with going into a war zone - people think of ever making this decision , &quot; said A@@ kun@@ je@@ e .
in February 2015 , Sult@@ ana and two other school girls from east London went to Turkey and then entered a bus to the Syrian border .
Sult@@ anas &apos;s family was told that she married an IS@@ IS figh@@ ter in Syria - and became wi@@ dow within a few months .
Rei@@ d says Clinton will remain in the case of a winner in Gar@@ land as candidates for the Supreme Court
Harry Rei@@ d , leader of the Democrats in the Senate , is convinced that the presidential candidate of the Democrats will nomin@@ ate H@@ illary Clinton the judge Mer@@ ri@@ ck Gar@@ land for the Supreme Court .
the Republi@@ can in the Senate have blocked gar@@ lands confir@@ ming since its nom@@ ination by Barack Obama in March .
the majority leader in the Senate Mit@@ ch Mc@@ Con@@ nell said that the next president will ap@@ point the successor to the de@@ ceased judge by the Supreme Court Anton@@ in Sc@@ alia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Rei@@ d said on Thursday during a telephone conference that he expects Clinton to choose &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gar@@ land &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with a certain degree of certainty &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a spokes@@ person from Rei@@ d later said that he had@@ n &apos;t spoken to Clinton if she would nomin@@ ate Gar@@ land and he spec@@ ulates .
he praised Gar@@ land and said , Clinton &apos;s team would not worry for un@@ rest with a new candidate .
Gar@@ land is the Supreme Ju@@ dge for the U.S. App@@ eals Court for the District of Columbia .
RAID states , Re@@ public@@ ans blocked the gar@@ lands &apos;s nom@@ ination , be lack@@ eys and hel@@ pers of the Republi@@ can presidential candidate Donald Tr@@ ump .
he also stated that Donald Tr@@ ump was un@@ suitable for the presi@@ dency .
Tre@@ ats wants cer@@ vi@@ cal cal@@ end@@ ars for &quot; Women and for Men &quot;
the Tre@@ ats Magazin works with the photographer David Bel@@ le@@ blog to bring out a 1970s Pi@@ relli @-@ inspired calendar for 2017 .
but instead of famous naked people , they want to find the next generation of super@@ models for their N@@ U M@@ uses calendar for 2017 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the editor @-@ in @-@ chief of Tre@@ ats Steve Sha@@ w told us the beginning of this year that his nude magazine from Old@@ school @-@ Play@@ boy distingu@@ ishes , since &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Play@@ boy for men is &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I do this for women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; apparently , he believes that it does the calendar too . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must return back to the representation of timeless and classic nude , in which both women and men feel comfortable and feel inspired by these images of a female body , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sha@@ w said in a press release for the release of the Cal@@ end@@ ars . &quot; &quot; &quot;
women will want to participate in this project because it is a beautiful work of art .
models can submit their pictures online or in person at Open Cast@@ ing App@@ eal in Los Angeles and New York .
Turkey : Kur@@ dish community reck@@ ons with mass @-@ cur@@ sed
&quot; whoever does not suit and pra@@ ises Erdo@@ gan sits on packed suit@@ cases , &quot; says the Presi@@ dency of the Gü@@ len Foundation Di@@ alogue and World , Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un .
the Kur@@ dish community of Germany will reck@@ on with tens of thousands of protection seek@@ ers who flee Turkey to Germany at short notice .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the medium term , there might even be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some hundred thousand &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the chairman Ali Top@@ ra@@ k believes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
due to the harsh pre @-@ accession of the Turkish President Rec@@ ep Tay@@ y@@ ip Erdo@@ gan after the attempt of the coup attempt , the Kur@@ dish community of Germany expects a mass flight to Germany .
&quot; in the short term , I reck@@ on with tens of thousands , in the medium term , with several hundred thousand guards from Turkey in Germany , when the Erdo@@ gan regime continues to fight the minorities and the democratic opposition , &quot; says the president Ali Top@@ ra@@ k of the &quot; World &quot; from Friday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because the government has already covered Kur@@ dish stron@@ gh@@ olds with off@@ ences already several months ago , 500@@ ,000 Kur@@ ds have been fle@@ eing within Turkey . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the failed coup , se@@ cular and op@@ positi@@ onal ethnic Tur@@ ks were added .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many will want to start ane@@ w in Europe if they are further supp@@ ressed in Turkey . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it cannot be that a state that takes refugees is producing refugees in their own country , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Top@@ ra@@ k said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ver@@ band@@ sch@@ ef accused the targeted settlement of Syrian Arab@@ s in Kur@@ dish , but also in Al@@ ev@@ it@@ an cities .
so that Erdo@@ gan wants to increase the boom on the remaining cu@@ res .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are the last big minority in Turkey , the Christian Armen@@ ians and Greeks have been exter@@ min@@ ated or distributed in the past hundred years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Top@@ ra@@ k , who is also C@@ DU member . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the head of the association called for the Federal Government to be positioned &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as sharp as Austria against Erdo@@ gan and its supporters . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; also in Germany a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; witch hunt &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is being fought against Erdo@@ gan critics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I feel no longer in Germany for the first time in the past few months .
the German branch of Gü@@ len movement also fears the escape of many Tur@@ ks abroad .
more Tur@@ ks will seek asylum in Germany , especially Kur@@ ds and Opp@@ os@@ ition@@ ists .
the br@@ anding as a Gü@@ len trailer destro@@ ys teachers and other academ@@ ics the professional existence .
&quot; whoever does not suit and pra@@ ises Erdo@@ gan sits on packed suit@@ cases , by the way also the Kem@@ alists and se@@ cul@@ ars , &quot; said Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un , Chairman of the Gü@@ len Foundation for Di@@ alogue and Education , the &quot; World . &quot;
as the paper reports on numbers of the Federal Ministry of Defense , the Tur@@ ks already presented the largest group of asylum @-@ holders recognized in Germany because of political persecution .
on June 30 , this 11,@@ 386 people and thus nearly 29 per cent of all have been eligible to have recognized ( 39.@@ 625 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this survey there is no war , poverty or lack of perspective . &quot; &quot; &quot;
asylum seek@@ ers according to the Basic Law are exclusively political , i.e. from the state side , individually persec@@ uted .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; go where it hur@@ ts &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
strange Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : the locals get nothing from the summer campaign with - and the vac@@ ation@@ ers from North Rhine @-@ Westphalia may not choose the Land@@ tag .
in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern , they understood .
in 2021 , the country election will not take place once again at the end of the summer holidays , the Schwer@@ iner parliament has already decided at the beginning of the year .
because stup@@ id than hi@@ ther@@ to it does not work : summer holidays , heat and ground combat fighting - that is bit@@ ing .
the locals , who are to be convinced by the elec@@ toral fighters , are on vacation .
most tourists who are in the country , on Use@@ dom , Rügen or Hid@@ den@@ see are not locals , so they are not allowed to choose the Land@@ tag .
practical problems come : during the holidays , hel@@ pers who hang up posters , infl@@ ate bal@@ lo@@ ons , spread fl@@ yers and count on the end of the vote , only lab@@ orious .
until 4 September 2016 , the election and last day of the day , Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern once again has to pass an election campaign to the people over itself .
the hot phase , if you can say that at all , has just begun .
and it is also about something : Prime Minister Er@@ win Sell@@ ering , leader of a SPD / C@@ DU @-@ coalition , must fear his office .
the SPD , the strongest party since 1998 , is now clearly lag@@ ging behind the C@@ DU .
exciting is how strong Ne@@ ul@@ ing Af@@ D cut off and what remains at the end of the coalition .
cel@@ ery , 66 years old and head of government since 2008 , makes an almost in@@ con@@ sp@@ ic@@ uous election campaign , one sees from its large posters .
he travels through the country , distri@@ butes ro@@ ses and chat@@ ting a little with the people , as it did his legendary wor@@ d@@ ger Harald Ring@@ storff .
otherwise , sailors will get cold feet and chan@@ cell@@ or Merkel the blame on the blo@@ oming of Af@@ D .
&quot; &quot; &quot; her refugee policy , her &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; We create this &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; acceler@@ ates the rise of right @-@ wing pop@@ uli@@ sts , which will probably cost him the beautiful office . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the C@@ DU , with its peak candidate , the Minister of Interior , Lorenz C@@ aff@@ ier , has already experienced how it is when you make the right place at the right place at the wrong time .
she has twice invited Chancellor Angela Merkel to make a major show ; Merkel &apos;s parliamentary group is in the north @-@ east .
but the target group did not vote , there were more North Rhine @-@ Westphalia , Berlin and Saxony as a Meckl@@ enburger and Vorpommern .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was probably the majority from other federal states , &quot; said Vincent Kok@@ ert , General Secretary of C@@ DU in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern , recently in N@@ DR . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it &apos;s too bad to listen to anybody from other corners of Germany , once Angela Merkel .
otherwise , the Nord@@ ost @-@ C@@ DU ref@@ uses to disp@@ ense with the usual elec@@ toral campaigns at market@@ places and in front of shopping m@@ alls with umbrellas and bal@@ lo@@ ons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; that , says Kok@@ ert , plays only a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; subordin@@ ate role &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Union has also noted that on the country it is the basis that it needs to be very strict , to find another wire to the people again .
it is like the left , the SPD , the Gre@@ ens : hardly available in the vast expan@@ ses of the country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , the Council of the C@@ DU V@@ er Kok@@ ert to his fellow @-@ fights is also self @-@ declar@@ ing : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you must go where it hur@@ ts , namely where people are : Dor@@ ff@@ este , Gol@@ dene Wed@@ dings , any birthday party must be used . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
because a lot is at stake , Sell@@ ering has now called his SPD into a particularly committed campaign .
in surveys , the Socialists and Democrats were at least 22 percent behind Partner C@@ DU ( 25 ) and just just before Af@@ D ( 19 ) .
at the 2011 election , the SPD had still won 35.@@ 6 percent before the C@@ DU ( 22 ) .
the Gre@@ ens , small party with seven percent in the surveys , should make the leap into the country &apos;s day .
they make a modern virtue out of the holiday @-@ need and make their campaign largely on the internet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; online campaign &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; it calls the president Claudia Müller . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; otherwise , green pol@@ lin@@ ators embar@@ k on track search for native voice stor@@ ms among ho@@ liday@@ makers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Silke Ga@@ je@@ k , the Spitz@@ enk@@ an@@ di@@ dat@@ in , cur@@ v@@ ts with a house@@ boat through the Mecklenburg Lake lakes and still finds it beautiful .
&quot; &quot; &quot; your impression : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; election holiday in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern is not a punishment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
B@@ 27 @-@ refurb@@ ishment : inn@@ s suffer from blocking
there is nothing to compl@@ ain about the speed with which the B 27 is rehabil@@ itated .
for those responsible for the construction work , which begin at 5.@@ 30am in the morning and end only at 8@@ pm , there are all praise .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they have done everything pretty sh@@ ak@@ y , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says El@@ vi@@ ra T@@ etz@@ l@@ aff from the jet fuel station . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is a super@@ team .
there is also no delay .
the construction site could be moved to the south at the start of the week , until the end of October everything should be finished .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; v@@ owed will also be the case of those responsible for the construction work , for example when it comes to the establishment of temporary hous@@ ings . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the construction site immig@@ rated on Monday to the south and also the blocking of the Asp@@ erg@@ road in O@@ fter@@ dingen was lifted and thus also the connection to Rot@@ tenburg re @-@ existed , the transport situation within the village was relaxed .
the citizens can now return from O@@ fter@@ dingen from the B 27 on both sides .
depar@@ ting from the place seems to go back .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there were partial significant complaints , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the Deputy Chief Executive Officer , Florian King , responsible for traffic management . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the residents of Bach@@ ar@@ straße , Stein@@ l@@ ach@@ straße , Haf@@ n@@ erst@@ raße and Wei@@ her@@ rain had to fight with more traffic noise because many cre@@ eping roads were looking for and more familiar with their Nav@@ i than the sign@@ age .
what led to the fact that some trucks in residential areas were fran@@ king .
since the speed limits were not met , the assembly called for ampli@@ fied the measuring vehicle from M@@ ös@@ singen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there were considerable exce@@ ed@@ als , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says King who made himself on the spot on the spot . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are already two to three per minute sco@@ red .
the quick@@ est was on the way at 77 km of hour in the tempo @-@ 30 zone .
since the construction site has been moved , it has become qui@@ eter .
for the business@@ men at the B 27 it is only a small con@@ sol@@ ation that for customers from Rot@@ tenburg the road is now open again .
business people don &apos;t like to look into the maps .
however , that the B 27 refurb@@ ishment has led to sales qu@@ arri@@ es , each one that is requested can be seen through .
however , some more and some are less affected .
those who have less to do with the &quot; end customer , &quot; i.e. for other companies , have hardly any consequences for the refurb@@ ishment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; also at the Aut@@ oh@@ aus Mai@@ er Thomas Sul@@ z speaks of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most slight drop , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but also adm@@ its that of course &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the cat@@ alogues are missing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the most heavily exploited are the bars along the road .
J. Albert G@@ öh@@ ner , owner of the Ste@@ ak@@ house , formerly Crown , finds clear words .
this is already exist@@ ential .
&quot; &quot; &quot; not only him , but all the inn@@ s made it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hard hit . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
customers from He@@ ch@@ ingen , Bal@@ ingen and Rot@@ tw@@ eil were missing .
we have to be happy about every euro turnover .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the sales revenues amounted to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; far above 50 percent &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the road landing has thrown its operation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; back two years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he had to dism@@ iss the half of his employees .
if I had a company with 4000 employees and the half would have been dism@@ is@@ sed , politics would have re@@ acted differently .
instead , President Jörg Schmidt has responded to a request by G@@ öh@@ ner whether it could give a financial compensation , the inn profits otherwise from the advantages of the situation at the B 27 . now , it must also bear the dis@@ advantages resulting from the refurb@@ ishment .
G@@ Ö@@ H@@ NER knows from other coun@@ ties , where so much more generous was handled .
with all complaints , G@@ öh@@ ner is sure that his inn will continue .
finally , the family business has been settled here since 17@@ 15 , referring to the long history of history .
that other tri@@ bal guests are now less frequent because of the complicated traffic guidance , he can understand .
if you can &apos;t drive , it is also somewhere else .
G@@ öh@@ ner has no doubts that his regul@@ ars return after the end of the rehabilitation work .
despite the crises with BSE and avian flu , G@@ öh@@ ner considers the effects of the B 27 construction work on his client@@ ele for the biggest crisis he has experienced in its long @-@ standing history .
six months of construction , this is brutal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; constantly in the name of the fight against terrorism , laws are scre@@ wed to laws . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after recent attacks , Interior Minister de Mai@@ zi@@ ère now presents a thick safety package .
but what does a debt status have to do with terror ?
and what does the coalition partner say to all this ?
Thomas de Mai@@ zi@@ ère gives the Vers@@ öh@@ ner .
&quot; &quot; &quot; all his proposals were &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; politically acceptable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to the coalition partner , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the Federal Minister of Interior with the presentation of his new security package . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they do not overwhel@@ m anyone .
other , further points would first be discussed within the parties .
I also participated in this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but as Minister of Interior , he was concerned with results and at a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; achie@@ vable con@@ sensus &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; within the coalition . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the recent attacks in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach , De Mai@@ zi@@ ère has missed a little time before presenting his conclusions for security in the Republic .
but these are all the more extensive .
a lot is already known , announced , announced , that a new security agency will take care of the crack of encrypted communication is not new .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is also not the fact that Germany has to implement multiple EU regulations on air passenger information and weapons law . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the call for more video surveillance and staff for security authorities is not surprising .
in part , de Mai@@ zi@@ ère starts a second outing for proposals that have not yet been made with the SPD : he wants sympathy for terrorist groups under penalty and ji@@ ha@@ dist@@ s with dual citi@@ zenship to kno@@ ck off the German passport .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these will be difficult points for the SPD , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the C@@ DU man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he still considers this to be reasonable and does not demand anything that has no chances in the coalition partner anyway .
a few new ideas are presented by Mai@@ zi@@ ère .
they have partly in themselves : he is planning a quick method for deport@@ ations and more possibilities for det@@ ention of people before deport@@ ation .
refugees who are targeted in the country should check their smartphones and reveal social media accounts for a safety review .
in the case of dam@@ aging for rejected asylum seek@@ ers , he wants to make some worse than so far - such as those who commit crimes or disc@@ ard their papers consciously in order to veil their identity .
some of it is political and legally protected .
some of them are still un@@ balanced and can be answered questions .
and with some points - in the ine@@ quality of im@@ patient for example - the question arises : what does that actually have to do with certainty and terror ?
yes , says de Mai@@ zi@@ ère , it is important to differenti@@ ate between the themes of refugees and terror .
but it cannot be said that the attacks of Ans@@ bach and W@@ uer@@ zburg have been refugees .
in addition , in view of the high refugee toll , many people were worried about security .
and things that the people deep@@ ened could not be par@@ enth@@ ron@@ ed even in elec@@ toral times .
the inner security has moved enorm@@ ously into the focus .
only the attacks in the neighbourhood : Paris , Copenhagen , Brussels , Nice .
then the attacks in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach .
the uncertainty is great .
and yes , there are elec@@ toral struggles .
on the subject of internal security , the Union and the SPD are becoming increasingly in position .
in the past few days the two parties went up high .
only a long @-@ term contro@@ vers@@ y about the equipment of the Federal Police , then a security policy collection of some Uni@@ ons Interior Ministers , in which the R@@ ess@@ ort@@ ch@@ efs also demand a bur@@ ka ban and a return from dual citi@@ zenship .
de Mai@@ zi@@ ère also blo@@ oms here to make irre@@ conc@@ il@@ able sounds .
he doesn &apos;t think of a return from the double pass .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have fre@@ ed the discussion in Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot;
to re@@ open it , be not sensible .
and he has constitutional concerns with a bur@@ ka ban .
&quot; &quot; &quot; whether his own package is un@@ constitutional and whether it is actually &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reasonable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the coalition partner , must still show itself . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is a lot about what could be done for stri@@ fe .
but the SPD is currently attemp@@ ting to pro@@ claim internal security in the topic of internal security .
&quot; &quot; &quot; party director Sig@@ mar Gabriel sign@@ alizes first carefully talk read@@ iness and says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything that helps to further enhance security . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
nor does Volkswagen come off lightly .
despite diesel sc@@ and@@ als , the delivery numbers are rising worldwide .
but not in all markets it runs round .
in the recall action , there is vor@@ tex for a term .
Volkswagen starts its deliveries in the second half of the year .
thanks to its many brands and some well @-@ running markets , Europe &apos;s largest autom@@ aker can further prove a plus despite the diesel affair due to its many brands and some well @-@ running markets .
but in July , the core brand VW weak@@ ened mainly in Western Europe and thus again loaded the total sales , as did the company listed in the D@@ ax .
sold worldwide , the VW brand in July with 4@@ 49@@ 100 cars sold 1.8 percent less vehicles than in the previous year .
in Western Europe alone , after China the second most important market , sales were 14 percent below the prior @-@ year period .
in the home market of Germany , deliveries declined by almost one sixth .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; brand @-@ sales chief Jürgen St@@ ack@@ mann brought back the weaker numbers from July , especially on two sales days less in Europe . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , in some core markets , there has been a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; changed economic framework &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in some core markets . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition to the situation around the Turkey attempt in Turkey , the British V@@ ot@@ um also stressed the withdrawal from the EU , explained a spokes@@ person .
in the USA , where the exhaust air first escal@@ ated , there is also further a minus to be@@ ech .
great support for VW is the Chinese market .
all in all , the primarily concerned house mark of the Lower Saxony seems to have a glimp@@ se of the diesel sc@@ andal . after the first seven months , only an output minus of 0.9 percent is available to 3.@@ 37 million vehicles .
group sales manager Fred Kap@@ pler was able to show a sales split from January to July .
1.3 percent more vehicles delivered Volkswagen at this time , 5,@@ 904 million worldwide .
Volkswagen has been t@@ amper@@ ed with a software testing .
in Germany alone , VW calls around 2.5 million cars to retro@@ fit into the workshops .
in the course of retro@@ fitting , VW reiter@@ ated that the conversion of cars did not have any negative effects .
after retro@@ fitting the vehicles , there is no deteri@@ oration in fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or engine performance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the motorway exit the customer after the retro@@ fitting a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; warranty certificate &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but don &apos;t talk about a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; guarantee &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as it was named on Friday in corporate travel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the reason is legal en@@ m@@ ities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Focus &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; had reported that Volkswagen now wanted its German customers a guarantee for equipped diesel models . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this was confirmed last Monday VW @-@ representative in the Federal Ministry of Transport .
from the Ministry of Transport , it was confirmed that there was this meeting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; VW has fulfilled the requirements of my Insp@@ ection Commission and the KBA . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; devi@@ ations from this are not accepted , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Federal Minister of Transport , Alexander Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t ( CS@@ U ) , according to the Ministry . &quot; &quot; &quot;
VW has assumed the guarantee that in terms of fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or engine performance , no deteri@@ or@@ ations will take place after retro@@ fitting and all type approval relevant vehicle values remain unchanged .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Volkswagen itself does not use the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; guarantee &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but not as it was in corporate travel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; with the wide term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; War@@ ran@@ ty &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Volkswagen has the possibility that for example , customers can come into a workshop about half a year after retro@@ fitting - and this can be trac@@ ed back to the new software even if the damage has nothing to do with it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
also in the interest of customers , it is important to avoid any other damage that has nothing to do with the g@@ utter sc@@ andal , resulting in uncertainty about possible warranty regulations , as it was .
&quot; &quot; &quot; therefore VW is not using the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; guarantee &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Rai@@ ff@@ eis@@ en@@ bank G@@ mund at T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see demands from weal@@ thy savings in the future - as a second institute in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; ban@@ ker Josef Paul said on Thursday : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s just about 139 customers who park 40 million euros on g@@ out or daily cash accounts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the German banks &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; German banks &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; speaks of a single case and does not see in it a signal : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ordinary Spar@@ ks would not fear &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to pay pen@@ alties for their austerity measures . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
banks money over night at the European Central Bank ( EC@@ B ) , they must pay their 0.4 per cent penalty .
this fee is required by the Rai@@ ff@@ eis@@ en@@ bank G@@ mund from private and corporate customers for deposits over 100,000 euros for deposits or daily cash accounts .
&quot; the first 100,000 euros are free . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the next 100,000 will cost 400 euros in the year , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Paul . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he maintained 40 million euros for a long time , which could be lifted from one day to the other and which he could not utilize .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are with me on the central bank account and generate 0.4 percent money , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the bank chief . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I cannot lie down for every million 4000 Euros . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the poll@@ uter @-@ pays principle , he now shares the costs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the cash simply placed in the v@@ aults of Rai@@ ff@@ eis@@ en@@ bank would be far too dangerous : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve already experienced four accidents , I don &apos;t want the fifth ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the bank . &quot; &quot; &quot;
most customers would have understanding and changed to other forms of investment .
only a few mig@@ rated to other banks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the cooperative association Bayern declared : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the EC@@ B &apos;s extreme monetary policy causes considerable costs at all banks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; to bear it alone is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; business @-@ economically viable . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some German banks therefore have increased their fees for account management , credit cards or transfers .
the Thurin@@ gian Volks@@ - und Rai@@ ff@@ eis@@ en@@ bank Alten@@ burger Land with its Sk@@ at@@ bank Fili@@ ale 2014 had head@@ lines for deposits of three million euros .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Michael Kem@@ mer , chief executive of the banking association , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not expect private customers to pay nation@@ wide fees for deposits , the competition in Germany under banks and savings banks is much too strong . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a ban@@ ker said at the T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see there &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a client@@ ele , which is somewhat luxuri@@ ant of wealth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this can become a problem for a small bank , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if they are keeping money free of charge . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the G@@ mund , founded in 1911 , has branches in Bad Wies@@ see , Rot@@ t@@ ach @-@ E@@ gern , Kre@@ uth and T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see .
actors , athletes and entrepreneurs live in the region .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the co @-@ oper@@ atives &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bavaria &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; are currently no further banks known to calculate a substitute for depos@@ iting private customers , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Spe@@ aker Ernst said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the president of the Federal Association of German Volks@@ banks and Rai@@ ff@@ eisen banks ( 1 BvR ) , Uwe Fr@@ öh@@ lich , had declared end of June : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the threshold to go into negative towards the private customer is very , very high . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
competition is tough , and it is threatening the emig@@ ration of investors to competition .
the customers in Germany won &apos;t let this fall in the width .
destination plates : who actually bu@@ ys records ?
lon@@ ely men middle aged love plates .
before you move to the comment section , to see him under the pseu@@ don@@ ym of non @-@ s@@ sam@@ en@@ men &apos;s age with rough ins@@ ults , this statement is derived from current data .
according to You@@ Go@@ v , the complex re@@ formation of records is not due to a boom in Millen@@ ni@@ als , which want to gre@@ et the new@@ ness of physical objects , but to mid@@ life no@@ stal@@ gia .
those who have recently bought a record are all fo@@ resi@@ ght at the age between 45 and 54 .
in fact , the age group of 18 @-@ 24 is the most impro@@ b@@ able buyer group .
there is also no hor@@ des by hobby collectors - it has an emotional impact : older record buyers are keeping their feelings more likely ( 56 % vs. 53 % ) and enjoy it alone time ( 69 % vs. 66 % ) .
but do the results of You@@ Go@@ v agree ?
if this blog were a news report on TV , the camera would follow me while I run in the middle of a busy street in Soh@@ o , a modest gray suit and wil@@ dly gest@@ ure before I stop , keep my hands and something determin@@ ant like this : &quot; so , let &apos;s take a closer look at it . &quot;
so let &apos;s take a look at it .
even though the heart of Soh@@ o slowly stands in its charm - hotels , restaurants and offices now fill the buildings in which once independent sellers were resident - there is still a hand@@ ful of fantastic plate specialized shops .
I would probably ask the cam@@ er@@ aman to turn off the camera for the next part in which I stand in close proximity to various men in such businesses and try to assess their age and mind by ob@@ serving .
Stu@@ art from Glas@@ go@@ w , 55 , which I of S@@ ister Ray ( number of data : two young women , three men middle aged ) into Rec@@ kl@@ ess Records ( number of data : eight men middle age , a woman , probably around the 20 ) , is a day long because of a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the few hours .
is he a collector , I ask ?
&quot; I guess already , &quot; he says .
I have about 3,000 or 4,000 plates .
these records , shown above ( he sent me the snap@@ shot by email , I did not follow him home ) , dress the walls of his living room .
the reason why he has such a considerable number of albums and sing@@ les is the result of his available income : he is now able to buy records he could not afford as they appeared and re @-@ bought items he sold when he was young and ple@@ ite .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many things I buy are from the late 60s , early 70s , who appeared when I was 11 or 12 . things I thought was too young to buy them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he agre@@ es that those who buy records are more intro@@ ver@@ ted and would like to spend time alone , and adds : &quot; I don &apos;t smoke and I don &apos;t drink very much .
this is my disaster .
WE@@ Z , 25 , who works at S@@ ister Ray , also believes that many customers that he meets on You@@ Go@@ v profile .
but he also noticed a new wave of fol@@ ks who are influenced by the media , people who have heard about the com@@ eback , causing them to buy their old records again .
from the conversations I have conducted , people are usually emp@@ tied with their collection in the same way around 1998 or 1999 .
customers who once sold their records to buy CDs now sell their CDs to buy their records , &quot; he says .
this would explain the boom to followers of a specific age .
but what about the alleged emotional importance of plates ?
it takes only a few seconds in a business like Ph@@ onica , to realize that record shops offer a so@@ o@@ thing community of like @-@ minded people .
according to the WE@@ Z some of the older customers stum@@ bled on the cont@@ act@@ less payment system .
some of the board fans feel overwhel@@ med by the digital world and want to pull back to the stability of familiar sound@@ boards , from objects that aw@@ ake happy Jugen@@ der@@ inn@@ erungen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think sometimes it can be the filling of a void or possession of material poss@@ essions as a kind of comfort , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says WE@@ Z . &quot; &quot; &quot;
that &apos;s the case with me as a collector so and I think it is so with many people .
it is a simple way to get involved spiritu@@ ally .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are like their social workers ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a survey by IC@@ M in April revealed that almost 50 % of people who bought a record last month have not yet listened to .
the survey also found that 41 % have a turn@@ table that they never use , while 7 % of those who buy a plate do not have turn@@ tables .
at this time of the news report I would probably look very concerned , while I bl@@ ät@@ ted through a pile of bos@@ sa nova comp@@ il@@ ations .
J@@ onn@@ y , 42 , who works with Sounds of the Universe ( number of data : three men middle age ) has noticed a &quot; tro@@ phy of the revival . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; someone only recently came here and said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t own a record player , but I would like to buy a radi@@ oh@@ ead bells record so I can put them on the shelf &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is not a big percentage , but it definitely happens .
more productive , less musi@@ c@@ astic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we have people who say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t have a turn@@ table . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these are younger people , not older ones , who only slowly enter .
opp , which has devoted to the sound records almost a whole floor , has a lower audience than I go .
there are couples around the 70 , tourists who make photos , teen@@ agers and middle aged women .
even if the atmosphere is slightly less relaxed than in the af@@ ore@@ mentioned shops - wild Be@@ asts latest Syn@@ thesi@@ zer@@ - and sex@@ ist @-@ packed pop instead of experimental jazz p@@ amper@@ ed from the speakers - it is good to see such diversity among the customers .
none of them looks strange , but nag@@ ging psych@@ ic trau@@ mas are hard to determine if you stand next to somebody 30 seconds .
E@@ lan@@ ora , 27 , has been in business for a few minutes and looks at the variety of boards sold for sale .
it rather makes a window bum@@ ble rather than a big shopping .
it does not deserve much , therefore collecting sheets is not a real option , says it .
it costs a lot .
it &apos;s easy to listen to music from a computer or another way , but the beauty of records is ... &quot; she drives away with a loving si@@ gh@@ ter .
I don &apos;t know how to explain it - it &apos;s really unique .
my last stop is a business that is said to have inspired a new generation of record lovers : urban Out@@ fit@@ ters .
while I release the je@@ ans @-@ pants , I watch a group of young teen@@ age girls group@@ ing for a moment to group Polar@@ oid cameras before a father and his daughter are thinking about buying a Cros@@ ley turn@@ table .
on the left there is a staircase , a wall full of records by Adel@@ e , Jeff Buck@@ ley , Amy Win@@ ehouse and Fle@@ et@@ wood Mac : a mixture of contemporary music and classics , the essential plates for an average collection .
no one sees them - perhaps because they are purely decorative , some as far above that it is impossible to touch them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is pure &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; plate art . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but considering that every attraction for these items would mean more money for the industry and could send some customers into the depths of Soh@@ o for more , there is nothing to compl@@ ain .
it is no surprise that a population group that has more time and money than others , is also the one that is most suitable for luxury items such as plates .
even though my research has revealed that the results of You@@ Go@@ v agree , they leave them , at least in record stores in Soh@@ o , the large number of female collectors , which exist in reality , record stores and online forums .
these people probably work hard at school or in offices .
they spend their Thursday morning with security not with the bum@@ ble through plate shops of Ber@@ wick Street and the leaves through plates while they avoid the star@@ ving view of an un@@ cann@@ y , 30 @-@ year @-@ old false moder@@ ator , who rises above the shoulders nothing remin@@ is@@ cent of middle aged .

French Court re@@ jects offer of demol@@ ition of shops in the jungle refugee camp
a French court rejected an offer of the authorities in Cal@@ ais , do@@ zens of pro@@ visional shops and restaurants in the jungle of Cal@@ ais , where thousands of refugees live .
during a trial this week the authorities argu@@ ed in Cal@@ ais that the state should be authorised to sell 72 pro@@ visional transactions in which persons within the camp sell goods , from cigar@@ ettes to En@@ erg@@ y@@ drinks , sell , hair@@ dressing services or sell tea for 50 c@@ ents ( 40 p@@ ence ) or simple meals for a few euros in temporary restaurants .
the pre@@ f@@ ecture of Cal@@ ais argu@@ ed that these places were to be ri@@ pped down because they would represent a parallel economy from which no taxes would be paid and which contain a fire and security risk .
humanitarian groups shared the court that the shops and restaurants are important , as the free meals offered by the state @-@ supported association and other groups would not provide enough food for the growing numbers in the camp .
they also stated that the pro@@ visional shops and restaurants often offer accommodation and free meals for people in need .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a court in L@@ ille decided that there would be no legal basis for the exp@@ ulsion of people who run the 72 temporary businesses , but admitted that the concerns of the pre@@ f@@ ecture of Cal@@ ais &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; are absolutely understand@@ able . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the judge Jean @-@ François M@@ olla said that gro@@ cery stores , cafes and restaurants would play a much greater role than merely feeding people who live &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in extremely prec@@ ari@@ ous conditions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he said that the areas offer quiet meeting points between refugees and volunteers .
one of the places threatened by the ra@@ vine was the Jung@@ le Book Kids &apos; Café des Lag@@ ers , which is operated in non @-@ profit and 200 meals a day , English and French classes as well as advice on asylum cases for the hundreds of vulnerable un@@ accompanied min@@ ors in the camp .
more than 17@@ 0,000 people have signed pet@@ ition to preserve the Kids &apos; Café .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a letter to the Guardian , it meant that the closure &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would be a disaster for these children of which the youngest eight years old are . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the two aid organizations help Refu@@ ge@@ es and L &apos;@@ Au@@ berge des Mig@@ rants appreciated on Friday that the number of people living in the jungle camp had risen to more than 9,@@ 000 people - the highest number to now - after a steep increase in new@@ com@@ ers over the summer .
despite Olympics dis@@ appointment : Martin remains milit@@ ant
despite his dis@@ ap@@ pointing show in the ol@@ ymp@@ ic period , Rad@@ pro@@ i Tony Martin wants to not get down .

he does not have an explanation for his mis@@ erable twel@@ fth place on the sugar lo@@ af .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I hon@@ estly say it is hard to comment yesterday , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Martin . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Martin actually wanted to fight for the title at the time driving championship in Qatar .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will look at everything we have changed in recent times . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Be@@ am went to the start with his offer only in January and has already more than 100,000 users .
you can watch other games , but also interv@@ ene yourself .

here comes the En@@ forcement Trailer
Germany &apos;s rac@@ ers have to adapt to the next generation of speed meters : in various federal states , among others in H@@ esse and Brandenburg , new fl@@ ashes are being tested to effectively manage the Tem@@ pos@@ u@@ ators effectively .
the fut@@ ur@@ istic enforcement trailer of the company Vit@@ ronic from Wiesbaden can , for example , be used on accident centers , where it would be dangerous for a mobile measurement by the police .
for example , on motorway construction sites or to refurb@@ ish bridges with temporary tem@@ ples , there is often no necessary infrastructure to ensure compliance with speed limit .
however , a permanent mobile construction can be too dangerous or costly .
the En@@ forcement trailer is self @-@ sufficient : its battery lasts five days with un@@ interrupted measurement operation , the case data is transmitted encrypted over a modem .
with laser measurement technology , all vehicles can be recorded simultaneously over several tracks simultaneously .
variable speed limits as well as through @-@ through pro@@ hib@@ itions according to time , travel strips and vehicle class can also be monitored .
in the highly @-@ driven state you can move the trailer according to manufacturer with each car with trailer hit@@ ch .
so that it is not simply stolen , it is lo@@ wered in the measurement mode , so that the wheels in the arm@@ oured and by the way also van@@ ish @-@ safe outer shell .
in addition , a built @-@ in alarm system should protect the se@@ ater from v@@ and@@ alism .
since 2015 , the trailer has been tested by Vit@@ ronic in various federal states and now also used .
foreign authorities also fl@@ ashed with the new technology : recently France has ordered 100 cards , after an order of 150 pieces last year .
great Britain takes silver in 7 @-@ er rug@@ by after Fi@@ ji Master@@ class wins gold
the impressive performance of Britain at the 7 @-@ inch rug@@ by came to an ab@@ rupt halt at the last hur@@ dle in the form of Fi@@ j@@ is when they were hit here in Rio with a result of 43 @-@ 7 at the De@@ odoro Stadium .
Fi@@ ji gained a master class in handling , side @-@ ste@@ pping , press @-@ back , line run and rust power to win gold - its first Olympic med@@ al of any color .
the defeat was lost due to the not too bad con@@ sol@@ ation of the Silver med@@ al - Britain &apos;s fourth on that day - and they could be proud of their efforts in this tournament in which they struck New Zealand , Argentina and South Africa .
the clear defeat of the Bo@@ ks , 7 @-@ 5 in the semi @-@ fin@@ als on the same day could fall on it in the final .
but regardless of that , Fi@@ ji could have hit a 15 @-@ man @-@ team in this form .
it could be a comfort for the UK - but it will probably not - that at least a Brit@@ on tomorrow will have a gold med@@ al around his neck : Fi@@ j@@ is chief trainer Ben Ryan , the former boss for England from Wim@@ ble@@ don .
GB had a difficult path .
eight years ago , she lost every game at the Adel@@ aide Sev@@ ens .
here they only lose one .
this hat@@ ch will hurt , but progress is amazing .
Fi@@ ji began to mar@@ vel and let the attacks of G@@ Bs run out of fun .
it felt for Captain Tom Mit@@ ch@@ ell and Co . , as if one was running in driving buses . the World Series Win@@ ner went 5 @-@ 0 upwards , when O@@ sea Kol@@ in@@ is@@ au was over@@ crowded in the corner .
with four minutes of playing , Jer@@ ry Tu@@ wa@@ i added another attack from the right corner he turned around .
12 @-@ 0 and GB barely touched the ball .
an ev@@ or@@ rag@@ ing T@@ ackle of Mit@@ ch@@ ell stopped the mountain of man Leone Nak@@ ar@@ awa a third goal , but it only stopped by Fi@@ ji .
in the seventh minute , j@@ asa Ver@@ n@@ alu@@ a l@@ ete a touch down in the right corner and it was 0 @-@ 17 for GB .
Nak@@ ar@@ awa added a new since the restart and there was still over a minute playing time ... in the first half .
V@@ at@@ em@@ o Rav@@ ou@@ vo@@ u pre@@ ached by further weak Tac@@ kl@@ ings of the GB teams and crashed up to the line to make a gate .
the conversion brought a 29 @-@ 0 to a break .
it &apos;s like Fi@@ ji was born to play the 7 , while GB still lear@@ ns .
this is how it is .
GB introduced fundamental changes to half @-@ time and closed the fi@@ asco @-@ gap ... for all four minutes , which was good for the conditions of the first half @-@ time until Joshua Tu@@ is@@ ova ran through a brilliant inter@@ play of Fi@@ ji .
Dan N@@ ort@@ on started an attempt for GB , made a touch@@ down in the left corner for a 36 @-@ 7 , but the game ran long in favor of the South African @-@ Sul@@ li@@ ans , whose fans sang , flags sw@@ apped and d@@ anced on the grand@@ stand .
it was not difficult to admire the play@@ ful approach to Fi@@ j@@ is .
Mat@@ a Vi@@ li@@ ens put the i @-@ dot with another try in the last few seconds .
the P@@ fi@@ ff so@@ unded , the Fi@@ j@@ is h@@ ug@@ ged and GB k@@ ick@@ ed cr@@ ushed out in the lawn .
earlier on the day Fi@@ ji Japan defeated Japan in the semi@@ fin@@ als with 20 @-@ 5 and Britain pushed South Africa in a tight half @-@ fin@@ al@@ Match from the race - Britain &apos;s conversion of difference .
K@@ yle Brown brought the Bo@@ ks in the first half to the front , but Dan N@@ ort@@ on broke the line with an impressive foot@@ work and sco@@ red a gate among the posts in the second half .
a brilliant , late Tac@@ kling of Marcus Wat@@ son , the brother of Anthony of the English 15 @-@ side team , secured the profit - and thus the silver med@@ al .
Hel@@ en Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning inspired by fighting with the trainer &apos;s cancer
there will be no more emot@@ ing gold than with these games and that wants to be hot .
from the first ru@@ d@@ der to the last , 220 hard for@@ ks that go into history , Hel@@ en Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning found an additional meaning in their golden moment at the Est@@ acio de Lag@@ oa .
even if there were only the ones who sat on the helm , there were three voices in the boat . the Echo of the Train@@ ers Robin Williams , was all present when they ru@@ ined the second Olympic age in the two without tax @-@ wife in a row , the first women in the history of the British Sports , who put such a benchmark .
their domin@@ ance was absolutely , at least their 39.@@ 3 un@@ varn@@ ished use , which is also un@@ parall@@ eled .
what we see are two brilliant athletes who gli@@ de across the surface with the elegance of sw@@ ans , which does not reflect the nature of triumph .
behind every gold in rowing is a batt@@ ali@@ on of wild hel@@ pers who make a difference to the incre@@ mental progress that make the difference and there was no one who knew the difference 30 months ago , whether he would survive this day at all when diagnosed with cancer .
as he said he was ris@@ ky .
I had bladder cancer , which is oper@@ able and that did it .
if you do not , it spreads everywhere .
it would have been a rather bad situation .
it changes a little the outlook .
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013 .
the trio was lucky that he could start treatment at the beginning of 2014 , out of season , which kept the break down to a minimum if that is the right term under such circumstances .
I needed money , so I had to go better again soon .
it was an incenti@@ ve .
I was in hospital and ran around on the station - 20 feet , 30 feet , 50 feet at a time when they said that some steps would be enough .
this is how it starts .
the rowing in itself is already a challenge , but this makes it an even bigger one .
in the immedi@@ acy of victory their first thoughts came to Williams , who spent a nerve wre@@ cking tomorrow with a bit more than usual , trying to process his own fears .
&quot; &quot; &quot; p@@ anning , which was the cent@@ ur@@ ion in the Royal Arti@@ ll@@ ery reg@@ iment in a deployment in Afghanistan , said &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was an emotional wre@@ ck this week . this is perhaps a bit extreme , but it means so much . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it just repe@@ ats what I mean , how much I and Hel@@ en and also Robin worked .
there were three fantastic years with Hel@@ en and Robin .
without Robin we would be nobody , therefore a massive thank you to him . he is the best coach in the world .
I couldn &apos;t have wished for a better person for exercising or a better trainer .
Helena Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning did not lose any race during the last five years .
the couple had a hard rhythm with which their opponents could not keep up .
even in the last 500 metres , when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark started to stop , p@@ anning and glo@@ ver had too much in reserve .
we were very captiv@@ ated at the moment .
Hel@@ en called &quot; stay in the process , stay in the process . &quot;
it is really important not to get carried away .
we had a good start and at the same time we were not out of doing something Great .
we didn &apos;t want a fire@@ work today , we just wanted to get a good result , go out and win the race what we did .
the couple will take a break for one year before making decisions about its future .
Glo@@ ver must appear next week on a wedding , their own with the TV advent@@ urer Steve Back@@ shall .
now she just wants to enjoy the moment .
I didn &apos;t want to say that it was my last race .
that would have too much pressure .
in London it took about six months to understand that I am an Olympic champion .
it was all so new for me and I was so stressed .
here it took about four minutes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it feels so much better , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for 31 years provided exempl@@ ary for clarity
the managing director of the water @-@ purpose association &quot; V@@ eit@@ enst@@ ein@@ gruppe , &quot; R@@ upper@@ t G@@ öller , is reti@@ ring .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the association is regarded as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; bay@@ ern@@ ally exempl@@ ary &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a small fr@@ än@@ k@@ ischer drinking water @-@ water @-@ association as a model for the large water producers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is how it was the original sound of the Bay@@ er@@ ischer Rundfunk before a while ago . &quot; &quot; &quot;
little later the water forum of the government of Lower Fran@@ con@@ ia wor@@ e the purpose of purpose .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the work of the V@@ eit@@ enst@@ ein@@ gruppe was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; bay@@ ern@@ wide as exempl@@ ary &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
behind all this is Rupert G@@ öller , who was 31 years in the Association of Emplo@@ ye@@ es , 28 years as Managing Director .
now he was reti@@ re at the age of 65 .
the water @-@ purpose association of the V@@ eit@@ enst@@ ein@@ gruppe , based in K@@ ott@@ endorf , Breit@@ brunn , supports around 15@@ 0,000 cubic meters of water annually and supplies 32 places and hamlet with approximately 5@@ 500 inhabitants .
the municipalities are church lou@@ der , Breit@@ brunn , Lau@@ ter , E@@ bel@@ sbach and the town of Ba@@ un@@ ach .
there are water distribution agreements for other cities and municipalities .
the current chairman , Breit@@ brunnen &apos;s mayor Ger@@ tru@@ d Büh@@ l ( FW ) , rec@@ alled that Rupert G@@ öller was appointed as a Wasser@@ wart in 1985 and was appointed managing director of the Zw@@ eck@@ verband in 1988 .
&quot; his tasks have been very diverse and they extend from water management and maintenance work on office and organization activities , bud@@ get@@ ary planning , calculation of fees and contributions up to emergency operations at weekends , &quot; said the chairman .
as an outstanding event , it called the commissioning and inaugur@@ ation of the new wells ( 1994 ) , purchase sale in the area of the new wells ( 1998 ) and compensation of the farmers , the renovation of the high container ( 1999 ) , the acquisition of a central computer control ( 2004 ) and the pon@@ ds of water pipes .
there have been no stand@@ still and I have always added new additions , because water pollution and drinking water is the most important food .
in their lau@@ dation , they praised Gö@@ ll@@ ers faithful , reliable and correct service for over 31 years .
he has worked with a lot of heart blood for his water @-@ purpose association and he has been living in the water @-@ purpose association as if it were his own company .
a few weeks ago , as a real practition@@ er , he was allowed to present the successful concept of the V@@ eit@@ enst@@ ein@@ gruppe to the nit@@ rate reduction in front of the Unter@@ fran@@ ken &apos;s water@@ forum .
for that he received a lot of praise and praise .
Rupert G@@ öller , on the one hand , praised W@@ eper Al@@ f@@ ons Grie@@ bel , who worked with him for 28 years .
he is the best water @-@ ke@@ eper and he was a loyal kno@@ ck .
together we were an unbe@@ atable team .
as a highlight from his point of view he described the well @-@ being and the restructuring of the Zw@@ eck@@ verband .
but the biggest challenge and the most difficult deployment , however , were the break@@ through@@ s at the Hoch@@ Container at church lou@@ der at a 3rd January .
here we had to work at minus 17 degrees all night so that the villages could be supplied with water .
also the supply of Neu@@ brunn can only be maintained because one filled the high container of P@@ ett@@ stadt with hoses .
the management of the German Dr@@ inking Water Association was handed over to Daniel St@@ ür@@ mer from Lau@@ ter , who joins the succession of Rupert G@@ öller .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the soprano Anna Net@@ reb@@ ko is openly dealing with the aut@@ ism of her son Ti@@ ago - and turns to other aff@@ licted parents : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you must have the courage to talk about it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; medicine has made great progress , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the 44 @-@ year @-@ old of the Italian newspaper &quot; Cor@@ riere della Ser@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when the disease had been recognized by her son , she believed she had to die .
but the eight @-@ year @-@ old Ti@@ ago was well ahead and now lear@@ ns privately in New York , where there are the best therap@@ ists .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to give an example : if I ask him something , which dates back two years when I sang at La Scala , he rec@@ alls nothing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Net@@ reb@@ ko . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but he is the happ@@ i@@ est man on earth .
Ti@@ ago comes from Net@@ reb@@ ko &apos;s connection with the bass bar@@ it@@ one Er@@ win Sch@@ rott .
she is now married to the tenor Y@@ usi@@ f Ey@@ v@@ az@@ ov .
relationship at Bar@@ g@@ t@@ eh@@ ei@@ de - man shooting at risk of life
a 35 @-@ year @-@ old man shot at 10.@@ 45 o &apos;clock in a multi @-@ family house in Bar@@ g@@ t@@ eh@@ ei@@ de ( Stor@@ mar@@ n district ) and wounded her dead@@ ly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the man has inv@@ oked himself with us and stated to have shot his li@@ fel@@ ess , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a police spokes@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the perpet@@ r@@ ator is on the run , and he will be pun@@ ished . &quot; &quot; &quot;
meanwhile nation@@ wide because Sven S. could be on the road with the car .
the man is about 1,80 meters tall , mus@@ cular , brown burned and has a gl@@ at@@ se .
in the meantime , the police released a photo of him .
it is however a few years old .
in the meantime , the man carries a Gl@@ at@@ se .
the man should not be addressed directly .
he could still carry the weapon with him , so the police .
who sees Sven S. , should call the 110 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the police speak of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; relationship of relationships &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the victim was born 1988 , the perpet@@ r@@ ator in 1981 .
at first , the competent police in Lübeck did not want to provide any information about the wa@@ ist@@ band or the relationship between perpet@@ rators and victims ; however , it confirmed that a person had been killed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a child mal@@ treatment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t say more at this time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a police spokes@@ man in Lübeck . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the e@@ ye@@ witnesses , a special application mand@@ o ( SEK ) was at the crime scene .
steel - Light vision for German steel industry
the ris@@ ky and energy @-@ intensive German steel industry remains spar@@ ed from additional costs to millions of millions .
financial bur@@ dens that threatened the industry from green electricity subsidies are from the table .
it remains in the liberation of the Renew@@ able Energi@@ es Survey at the stock levels of the so @-@ called self @-@ mass production in the German steel industry , said Federal Minister of Agriculture Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) of the &quot; West@@ deutsche Allgemeine Zeitung &quot; ( WA@@ Z , Friday edition ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am really happy that we could finally reach negotiations after two years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the European Commission initially planned to ask the steel manufacturers to use gases from the blast furnace to generate electricity for their own consumption . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the German industry association , the steel industry threatened additional costs of 120 to 240 million euros per year .
Gabriel said to the WA@@ Z , now there is a basic agreement with the European Commission following discussions with a competition commission@@ er Mar@@ gre@@ the V@@ est@@ ager .
only when the generators are replaced in the steel works , it has an E@@ EG lev@@ elling of 20 percent .
but also this will not be raised in the steel industry .
IG Metall welcomed Germany &apos;s agreement with the European Commission on its own production .
with this , the status quo of the previous scheme will be largely determined .
the successful efforts of Gabriel for the steel industry have special significance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with regard to our campaign &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Steel is the Future &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is this a first step . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; others need to follow &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even with the reform of emissions legislation , climate and employment targets are weigh@@ ed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; declared IG Metall @-@ Chef Jörg Hof@@ mann in Frankfurt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the steel industry in Europe has suffered from over@@ capacity and considerable price pressure since the financial crisis in 2008 .
last year , the situation intensi@@ fied , when the world @-@ largest producer of China threw massive steel on the world market in view of the weak@@ ening domestic demand .
European manufacturers throw in price dump@@ ing in Chinese steel companies .
in the course of this spring , the situation has a little relaxed .
on the one hand , imposed duties on imported steel have effect , on the other hand the economic prospects in China have emerged .
un@@ clear is how sustain@@ ably the pick @-@ up is .
the German industry pri@@ mus Th@@ ys@@ sen@@ K@@ rupp was c@@ auti@@ ous on Thursday .
last but not least , prices would have been more stag@@ nat@@ ing again .
the industry respon@@ ds to the difficult situation with further cost reduc@@ tions .
at the end Th@@ ys@@ sen@@ K@@ rupp also wanted to not excl@@ ude locking of individual works .
around 86@@ 0,000 people were employed in the German steel industry at the end of 2015 .
in July the German steel producers remain c@@ auti@@ ous despite rising prices and increasing orders .
with 3.4 million tonnes , they produced a good six percent less cru@@ de steel than in the previous year &apos;s month , as the Wirtschafts@@ vereinigung Stahl announced on Friday .
after a brief increase in May , the quantity produced went back the second month in a row .
since the beginning of the year , production has been down by two percent below the previous year &apos;s figure .
in the coming months , the association expects an improved order position with a rising output .
community , mind , health : singing does sen@@ iors well
singing has accompanied Ur@@ sel K@@ ip@@ p all her life : as a young girl she was in the school choir , in the teacher &apos;s office she occupied the subject of music , and today the 78 @-@ year @-@ old sings in a sen@@ iors @-@ choir .
&quot; singing moves me - emotional and physical , &quot; she describes .
after a rehear@@ sal , she feels balanced , cheer@@ ful and alive , she says .
by the way , she does something good for her health and her mind .
for singing is a great hobby for sen@@ iors from several perspectives , says Er@@ hard H@@ ac@@ kler from the German Seni@@ oren@@ liga .
most sen@@ iors sing in the choir and share with like @-@ minded the joy of music , describes H@@ ac@@ kler .
by regular meetings , sen@@ iors can soci@@ alize and maintain social contacts .
because often social and famili@@ al structures dis@@ solve in old age , a choir is then an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this experience also made Ur@@ sel K@@ ip@@ p in her choir : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to speak and organise , to be able to rely on others and to learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of being together . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
singing can be exhau@@ sting in the positive sense , says H@@ ac@@ kler .
for this , sen@@ iors train a deep and controlled breathing .
those who regularly demand his lungs are not so fast from the pu@@ rest in everyday life .
even when it comes to preserving the sound of the voice in old age , singing is an optimal hobby .
in elderly people , S@@ ingen often has a very special effect , says Ursula L@@ enz from the Federal Labour Association of the Seni@@ oren @-@ Organis@@ ations .
in the older generations the common singing had a much higher significance ; it was part of everyday life , both at school and in leisure time , she explains .
L@@ enz often ob@@ serves that singing or listening of songs in elderly people awak@@ ens many memories , often associated with positive feelings of their adol@@ es@@ cent period .
through lyrics and especially melo@@ dies , de@@ menti@@ a @-@ sick people de@@ parts themselves to long past events .
in singing , the head also requires special performance , explains L@@ enz .
focusing on one &apos;s own voice and a given rhythm and adap@@ ting to the other singers - this is a major cognitive challenge .
especially older people who live alone do not only practice concentr@@ ating on themselves .
another positive aspect is the recognition that one experiences through singing in the choir , says H@@ ac@@ kler .
an enthusiastic audience is a great praise .
also the self @-@ este@@ em grows through singing in the choir .
to show himself : if I have long for something , I become better and stronger over me - this experience strengthens .
good reasons to start singing , so there is enough .
those who want to try a new hobby should not hesitate - even if he thinks of having little talent , L@@ enz advis@@ es .
you don &apos;t sing alone - with 50 singing people , who already h@@ ears when a sound goes to it ?
in search of the right offer , senior citizens have different options , says H@@ ac@@ kler .
if someone sings from the circle of acquain@@ t@@ ances in a senior ch@@ urch@@ yard , one can easily join .
many cities also offer views of the choirs in the surrounding area .
whoever wishes to sing in a church choir can turn directly to the church or church leader .
many senior choirs can also be found on the Internet .
anyone who has no access to the Internet can ask the family , friends or neigh@@ bors for help with the internet research .
whoever wants to sing , should necessarily join a choir , advis@@ es H@@ ac@@ kler .
singing does the soul well and has something liber@@ ating - that applies to all ages .
cats react more sensiti@@ vely than males to fri@@ ght the k@@ itt@@ ens
bi@@ ologists have investigated in Hannover what effect the cri@@ es of cat babies has on adult animals .
to their surprise the males did not let the males get cold - however they always kept the difference with the females always the same .
female cats can recognize the degree of sus@@ cep@@ ti@@ bility of k@@ itt@@ ens at the chin of the little ones .
they respond by ten percent faster to k@@ itt@@ ens of k@@ itt@@ ens who have found themselves in great dist@@ ress , as scientists have found out of the Veter@@ inary University and the Medical School Hannover ( M@@ HH ) .
males are also respon@@ ding to the calls of k@@ itt@@ ens - however always the same .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; apparently , the acoustic differences between the mos@@ a@@ ics of less and strongly arous@@ ed juven@@ iles for the males either not percep@@ tible or not of importance , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Biolog@@ in Wi@@ eb@@ ke Kon@@ er@@ ding from the M@@ HH . &quot; &quot; &quot;
she is the first author of the study published on this Friday in the journal &quot; BM@@ C Evol@@ ution@@ ary Biology . &quot;
in a previous study , the research team has already discovered that the duration and pitch of the k@@ itt@@ ens cri@@ es with the ur@@ gency of their help .
a total of nine adult males and eight female animals were observed from the animal hus@@ band@@ ry of the M@@ HH .
they were performed for one calls of little ones who were taken out of the throw box for three minutes and separated from mother and si@@ bl@@ ings .
on the other hand they were confronted by scre@@ aming of stronger k@@ itt@@ ens which were additionally up@@ lifted .
the researchers keep their results in spite of the low stit@@ ch sample for meaningful results .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all females , even those who had no offspring , re@@ acted to the cri@@ es , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Kon@@ er@@ ding . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they turned faster to the speaker when this loop played the very excited k@@ itt@@ ens .
this ability may possibly be inn@@ ate or develop with the sex@@ ually mature .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a surprise was that the males have re@@ acted at all , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Biolog@@ in . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the past , scientists have already repeatedly investigated the reactions of women and men to baby sounds .
some studies showed that women responded sensiti@@ vely to babies , no matter whether they were mothers or not , the Biolog@@ in Marina Sche@@ um@@ ann reported .
Po@@ dol@@ ski pic@@ ks up with &quot; Gala &quot; to Super@@ cup
Hak@@ an Sü@@ kü@@ r is a football legend in Turkey .
in Turkey , an arrest warran@@ t has been issued against the former football star Hak@@ an Sü@@ kü@@ r .
he is accused of being a member of a terrorist group .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the first time after the attempt of put@@ sch@@ ism in Turkey , there is again an important football match . &quot; &quot; &quot;
before the du@@ el of the Erz@@ riv@@ alen between settlements Istanbul and Lukas Po@@ dol@@ ski Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay Istanbul around the Super@@ cup in Kon@@ ya the official line is clear : &quot; business as usual &quot; is announced .
the government , the everyday life of normal vou@@ chers , should not be affected by the arrest of the emergency state after the attempted coup attempt in July .
this does not apply to those suspected of belonging to the movement of the pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , which is responsible for the attempt of put@@ sch@@ ism .
football does not stop at the same time .
against the former star@@ k@@ icker Hak@@ an Sü@@ kü@@ r , the public prosec@@ utor made an arrest warran@@ t .
accordingly , the South of America living in America is accused of being a member of a terrorist group .
Sü@@ kü@@ r will be the supporters of the Pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , who is responsible for the attempt of the coup attempt by President Rec@@ ep Tay@@ y@@ ip Erdo@@ gan .
although the exceptional situation for 90 days is still valid until October , indeed that is as good as no effect on the lives of most Tur@@ ks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the nigh@@ tly &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; democracy guards &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in public places throughout the country has declared Erdo@@ gan in Wednesday for an end . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sport is - like the whole country - split into followers and opponents of Erdo@@ gan .
especially fans of the worker @-@ club Besi@@ kt@@ as traditionally do not count among the friends of the president .
but , in view of dramatic experiences in history , the growth of the Tur@@ ks is the strict rejection of military put@@ ties .
even the fans agree - no matter whether their heart beats Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay or settlements .
&quot; &quot; &quot; at the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gala &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tro@@ phy , it will be especially returned to Lukas Po@@ dol@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Köl@@ ner in the past season proved its sporty value : with 17 gates and nine templates in all competitions , the 31 @-@ year @-@ old finished his first season as a top@@ scor@@ er of his association .
in the final game against Fen@@ erb@@ ah@@ ce he sco@@ red the 1 : 0 @-@ podium result .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the newspaper &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; F@@ AN@@ AT@@ IK &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; che@@ ered him : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he was the best in the place . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he finished the season in an excellent way and secured the cup his team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; thanks to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pol@@ di &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the dis@@ ap@@ pointing season for the record master found an irre@@ conc@@ il@@ able conclusion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; after the pre @-@ round K.@@ O in the Champions League the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; lions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also leave early in the Europe League . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the capacity of SÜ@@ SS Li@@ g it was only to rank six .
the season was not good .
the cup was the only way to win something .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we managed it and that is the most important thing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Po@@ dol@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for master sett@@ lers the year of play was better .
above all , thanks to Mario Gom@@ ez , who made the basis for the 14th title with 26 sa@@ is@@ ont@@ ers as SÜ@@ SS @-@ Li@@ g Tor@@ rette .
this is also the reason that the fans hope to return to the 31 @-@ year @-@ old .
in doing so , the Gom@@ ez acquired only bor@@ ro@@ wed Gom@@ ez after the coup attempt at the AC Florence , because of the political situation in the country after his EM @-@ holidays .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if Mario wants to come to us , he only needs to say it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; c@@ ited the magazine &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ icker &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Club@@ chef F@@ ik@@ ret Or@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , the St@@ ür@@ mer would have to be ready to reno@@ un@@ ce around one third of his annual sal@@ ary to 7.5 million euros , Or@@ man stated clearly : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his sal@@ ary in Florence we cannot pay . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
despite dop@@ ing : these athletes still have med@@ als chances at Olympia in Rio
the 34 @-@ year @-@ old Just@@ in Gat@@ lin was blocked twice due to dop@@ ing ( 2001 and 2006 ) .
Rio de Jan@@ eiro - W@@ hist@@ le@@ blo@@ wer Julia Step@@ an@@ owa must not start in Rio .
other convi@@ cted athle@@ tics sinn@@ ers can only laugh about it - they fight in Rio to med@@ als .
the topic dop@@ ing determines the head@@ lines at the Rio Olympics in Rio .
the Russian swi@@ mm@@ ers Juli@@ ja J@@ ef@@ im@@ owa , who had been acc@@ using her starting right after a dop@@ ing lock shortly before the games , was p@@ aci@@ ously stri@@ ped out and booked at her start ( 100 metres of chest ) .
it was a bizar@@ re scenario : with an up@@ set smile she was still in the hall and had prov@@ oked her appearance .
when determined that she won &apos;t get gold , the audience burst into a storm storm .
but there are numerous other sport@@ s@@ men who go to the start despite the dop@@ ing past at the Rio Olympics .
here is an overview :
Just@@ in Gat@@ lin ( 100 , 200 , 4x@@ 100 @-@ m @-@ Rel@@ ay / USA ) : the 34 @-@ year @-@ old belongs to the most controversi@@ al figures in athle@@ tics .
he was locked twice for dop@@ ing ( 2001 and 2006 until 2010 ) .
since its spell the Olympic champion of 2004 and ex @-@ world champion runs even faster than before , he is the number one in the world over 100 m in 9.@@ 80 seconds and is considered as the biggest chall@@ enger of Us@@ ain Bol@@ t .
Shel@@ ly @-@ Ann Fr@@ aser @-@ Pr@@ yce ( 100 , 4x@@ 100 @-@ m @-@ Rel@@ ay / Jam@@ ai@@ ka ) : the two @-@ time Olympic champion and seven times champion in 2010 had to sit down a six @-@ month lock after taking the pain of pain by Oxy@@ co@@ don .
after an operation she had strong too@@ th@@ ache , the 29 @-@ year @-@ old def@@ ended .
Sandra Per@@ ko@@ vic ( Dis@@ cus / Croatia ) : in 2011 , the 2012 Olympic champion , World Championship of 2013 and European Championship from 2010 to 2016 has been positively tested for the bann@@ ed stim@@ ul@@ ant meth@@ yl hex@@ an@@ amine .
Per@@ ko@@ vic denied the occasional intake and was barri@@ c@@ aded for six months .
the four fur@@ th@@ est thro@@ ws this year go to the account of the great gold favourites .
La@@ Sha@@ wn Mer@@ ritt ( 200 , 400 , 4x@@ 400 @-@ m @-@ Rel@@ ay / USA ) : the Peking Olympic champion and two @-@ time world master over 400 m , had been tested positive in 2010 and locked 21 months in 2010 .
a means of penis enlargement has been responsible , bet@@ ed Mer@@ ritt .
this year the 30 @-@ year @-@ old is about 200 and 400 m the hi@@ ther@@ to fastest man in the world .
Ivan Ti@@ ch@@ on ( ham@@ mer@@ ed , white r@@ ussi@@ a ) : probably hardly an ath@@ l@@ ete were det@@ ectable so many med@@ als afterwards .
so Ti@@ ch@@ on lost his F@@ WC title from 2005 nine years later , after he was diagnosed with testosterone dop@@ ing .
the 40 @-@ year @-@ old also had to leave the Olympic silver in 2004 because of ster@@ oid dop@@ ing and the EM @-@ title 2006 because of testosterone ab@@ uses .
the bronze med@@ al of the 2008 Olympic Games was also reg@@ ained because of a verdi@@ ct of the International Criminal Court CAS .
at 8@@ 0,@@ 04 m he is ranked 2nd in the world ranking .
Li@@ u Hong ( 20 km Walk , China ) : the world record artist and gold favourite was only tested in May , but must still start in Rio .
at the 29 year old World Championships , references to taking a forbidden dietary supplement have been found , the lock of the World Anti @-@ dop@@ ing agency WA@@ DA fell mild and ran away on July 13 .
bom@@ b terror in Thailand - viol@@ ated Austrian - Mehr@@ ere T@@ ote
the Austrian Embassy in Thailand is in contact with the woman , said the spokes@@ man of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , Thomas Schn@@ ö@@ ll , Friday morning .
I had suffered from the pain and had been treated in the hospital , but I have already left it again .
they planned their home trip for the beginning of September .
whether from the further explo@@ sions on the holiday island Ph@@ u@@ ket as well as in the southern cities of Sur@@ at Th@@ ani , Ph@@ ang N@@ ga , Tran@@ g and Ch@@ umph@@ on , also Austrian citizens are still un@@ clear .
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is in constant contact with local authorities , such as bar@@ b@@ arians .
at about 200 kilometres south of the capital Bangkok , Hu@@ a H@@ in initially explo@@ ded two bom@@ bs on Thursday evening .
according to the police , a Thai woman was killed and about 20 people were injured , including the Austri@@ ans , three Germans , three Dutch and three Itali@@ ans .
Friday afternoon , two jump no@@ zzles went up , but a further human being was killed according to the authorities .
also from Ph@@ u@@ ket a bom@@ b explosion was reported in the morning .
during the det@@ on@@ ation near the beach str@@ ands Pat@@ ong popular among ho@@ liday@@ makers , a taxi driver was injured .
in Sur@@ at Th@@ ani at the south @-@ east coast of the country then another bom@@ b explo@@ ded , which killed a municipal employee .
according to the authorities in a flower bed , the explosive rate went into the air before the prec@@ inct of the coastal police .
finally , some det@@ on@@ ations in Ph@@ ang N@@ ga and Tran@@ g on the south @-@ west coast as well as in Ch@@ umph@@ on on the south @-@ east coast demanded several injured .
one go from a connection with the explo@@ sions in Hu@@ a H@@ in , called it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the bom@@ b attacks carry the same signature , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Army General Dan@@ ai Krit@@ meth@@ av@@ ee Friday morning before journalists . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we assume that it is a co @-@ ordin@@ ated attack . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is too early to express themselves to possible motives - probably it is about the actions of Muslim rebels . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Thai media also wanted to see a pattern typical for the bom@@ bing of Muslim separ@@ ati@@ sts in the south of the country .
the Thai police , on the other hand , declared that the attacks would not be in connection with the Islam@@ ist insur@@ gency movement or with international terrorism .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is only local sab@@ ot@@ age limited to limited areas and provinces , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a spokes@@ man in Bangkok . &quot; &quot; &quot;
rather , one assumes that the bom@@ bs were laid down by opponents of the ruling military jun@@ ta .
in the past few days , the authorities would have received secret references to forth@@ coming attacks in the south of the country - but they were not informed of the exact time and the places .
it is still un@@ clear which group behind the attacks st@@ ashed .
the police showed their officials across the country , security around important government buildings , as well as airports , train stations , tourist attractions , restaurants and entertainment districts .
in Thailand there are still smaller bom@@ b attacks , but mostly they do not focus on tourists .
in Hu@@ a H@@ in is a palace that was used over the years of Thailand &apos;s king B@@ hum@@ i@@ bol Ad@@ ul@@ y@@ ade@@ j .
according to the well @-@ known bom@@ b explo@@ sions , the Austrian Foreign Ministry recommends on its homepage to follow the instructions of the Thai security authorities .
high security risk ( security level 3 ) applied for the provinces Nar@@ ath@@ i@@ w@@ at , Y@@ ala , P@@ att@@ ani and Son@@ gh@@ kl@@ a as well as Pre@@ ah Vi@@ hear and surroundings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after disputes between security forces and Muslim populations , there is no need for travelling to these provinces . &quot; &quot; &quot;
increased safety risk ( security level 2 ) landed for the rest of the country .
the attacks on Thursday and Friday took place a few days after a controversi@@ al referendum on a constitution elabor@@ ated by the jun@@ ta .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this gives the military great influence over the coming years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jun@@ ta boss and prime minister Pra@@ y@@ ut Ch@@ an @-@ o @-@ cha said the bom@@ bs were an attempt to sti@@ ff chaos , while the country moved towards stability , improvement of economic situation and tourism .
the military jun@@ ta , who had seized the power in 2014 after a phase of bloody distur@@ ban@@ ces , considers himself to have led the kingdom back to stability and order .
however , the military did not succeed in getting a grip on the insur@@ gent rebel@@ lion of Muslim rebels in the extreme south of the country .
more than 6@@ 500 people have already been killed in the conflict .
almost a year ago , in Bangkok , at an attack on a popular Hin@@ du shr@@ ine , 20 people were killed , most of them foreign tourists .
it was the bloo@@ dies@@ t attack of the country &apos;s younger history .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the right &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ident@@ ity Movement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has been submitted to the Federal Office for Constitutional Affairs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after several national offices , the constitutional conserv@@ ation@@ ists also have set up the group under observation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we see at the &apos; Ident@@ ity Action &apos; locking points for aspir@@ ations against the free democratic constitution , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Constitutional Secretary Hans @-@ Georg Ma@@ ate of the Deutsche Presse @-@ Agentur in Berlin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
thus immigrants from Islamic faith or from the Middle East are being diff@@ used in extrem@@ ist ways .
that is why we are now watching the movement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ident@@ ity Movement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a group@@ ing with French roots which has been active in Germany since 2012 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it turns against &quot; Mul@@ tik@@ ult@@ i W@@ ahn , &quot; &quot; un@@ controlled mass immigration &quot; and the &quot; loss of one &apos;s own identity by est@@ ran@@ gement . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; constitutional conserv@@ ation@@ ists in nine provinces - Bremen , Bavaria , Hessen , Berlin , Baden @-@ Württemberg , NRW , Lower Saxony , Saxony and Thurin@@ gia - observe the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ident@@ ity &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ma@@ ate said his authority was closely coordinated with the state offices in the decision . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; groups like the &apos; Ident@@ ity Movement &apos; try to pick up their target audience where it stands , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Constitutional Court . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in general , extrem@@ ists try to address them with a you@@ thful language , often with p@@ opp@@ y music .
the daily Islam@@ ists as well as right @-@ wing extrem@@ ists .
this is not a num@@ eric advertising for your own cause .
propaganda should appeal to people emotion@@ ally .
young people are particularly sus@@ cep@@ tible .
this is dangerous .
&quot; &quot; &quot; finally , there were reports from several federal states about contacts of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ident@@ ity &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to Af@@ D politicians . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ma@@ ate said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have no knowledge about that . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for constitutional protection , possible contacts of this kind are only relevant after a certain point . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it depends on whether the respective party - in this case the Af@@ D - by certain individuals who are extrem@@ ist , changes their direction and so extrem@@ ist .
decisive is therefore whether such persons have controlled influence on the party .
this is not recogni@@ zable .
with a view to the clear increase in legitimate acts and attacks on asylum seek@@ ers and refugee shel@@ ters , Ma@@ ate said he would not speak of new right terrorism in this context .
but we have found in recent years that there can be right @-@ terrorism structures .
there was the group &apos; Old School Society &apos; or the Friday group .
it may well be that other legally @-@ terrorism group@@ ings or small groups form the attacks against asylum seek@@ ers , against refugee streams or attacks from other right @-@ wing extrem@@ ist motives .
however , a German @-@ wide or Europe @-@ wide control of legal @-@ terrorism is not recogni@@ zable .
the previous groups were created on the regional level or in social networks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; worried about the fact that many sur@@ geri@@ es went to the account of people who had previously not appeared in the right scene . &quot; &quot; &quot;
that is the concern .
many of the susp@@ ects in attacks on asylum shel@@ ters have not previously been known as crimin@@ als , politically motivated pen@@ alties or supporters of the right scene .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many people have committed crimes that previously had nothing to do with right @-@ wing extrem@@ ists who might have been politically indiffer@@ ent or have voted for example C@@ DU , SPD or left , which , however , have radic@@ alised themselves through right @-@ wing extrem@@ ist m@@ oods . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Rio 2016 : RO@@ BEL Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te becomes Inter@@ ne@@ th@@ it
not always the Olympi@@ ans or world records determine the head@@ lines at the Olympic Games .
this shows the bra@@ ve appearance of Ro@@ bel Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te during the summer playing in Rio de Jan@@ eiro .
the Aqu@@ atics Center spon@@ ge the slightly over@@ weight swi@@ mmer from Ethiopia so slowly that it was no longer visible in the TV pictures .
it simply disappeared - no matter how far the neck@@ line was selected .
in social networks , Hab@@ rat was then called for the viral Inter@@ ne@@ th@@ it .
in fact , the 24 @-@ year @-@ old ends with a spine of 48 seconds and occupied the 59@@ th place of 59 star@@ ters .
but it was rather his not just sporty character that attracted the attention of the international media .
why the 24 @-@ year @-@ old still particip@@ ates in the Olympic Games ?
the Ethiop@@ ians had a special starting right from the international swimming association .
this is distributed to make swimming more well @-@ known in under@@ represented countries .
as in Ethiopia , most sport@@ s@@ men run , I just wanted to do something different .
preparation is all : RO@@ BEL RU@@ ros Hab@@ te is ready for the big race .
quickly the first nick@@ names made the round .
&quot; &quot; &quot; some media reported him as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ro@@ uble of the wh@@ ale &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; based on a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prosperity b@@ ust &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the English tab@@ lo@@ id sheet &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Sun &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; D@@ ad Bo@@ d &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; made fun of him . &quot; &quot; &quot;
his time , he only struck a minute and almost five seconds over the 100 meters of Fre@@ estyle , played there no role .
compar@@ isons with &quot; Eric the E@@ el &quot; were also drawn .
at the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney the run by Eric M@@ ous@@ sam@@ ban@@ i took care of media attention .
unforgettable was the appearance of the swimming pool of the equ@@ at@@ orial Guinea , when he had to compete in a pre@@ run over 100 metres of Fre@@ estyle .
M@@ ous@@ sam@@ ban@@ i was fired at that time .
the then 22 year old learned to swim only eight months before the Olympics and had never completed such a long distance before the competition .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tr@@ ump sees the threat of election not so tight &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Republi@@ can presidential candidate , Donald Tr@@ ump , speaks at an election campaign in Florida .
if there is nothing wrong with the election to the US President , Donald Tr@@ ump has already an alternative video .
he then drove into the holiday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Donald Tr@@ ump loses the U.S. presidential elections in November , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ultimately it will either fold , or I have a very nice , long holiday , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Republi@@ can candidate in a phone interview with the U.S. television station CN@@ BC . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if it does not suff@@ ice for him in the end for reasons of political correctness , this is fine , said Tr@@ ump .
he described the US President Barack Obama and the democr@@ ats of the Democrats , H@@ illary Clinton , as the founder of the terrorist mil@@ itia Islamic State ( IS ) .

post rises in trading with electric @-@ transpor@@ ters
an electric vehicle of the Deutsche Post in action .
the interest of other companies in the vehicle is obviously big .
the post is planning to sell your electric vehicle Stre@@ et@@ Sco@@ oter too .
in brief , the Group intends to start trading with the transpor@@ ter .
the Post wants to offer its electric v@@ ans from the coming year on the free car market .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to enter third parties in the sale , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a post @-@ speaker on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for months , the company checks if they are delivered to their own stre@@ et@@ sco@@ ot@@ ers , with which letters and pack@@ ets are delivered , also to sell to other farms .
post @-@ Management Board Jürgen Ger@@ des had said there will always be re@@ questions , such as by crafts@@ men .
&quot; &quot; &quot; after information from the news magazine &quot; Der Spiegel &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the Bon@@ ner Group wants to enter the mass production of the vehicles shortly . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the post @-@ owned factory , the company plans to build up to 10,000 cars per year per shift .
Ger@@ des had announced that the Group wanted to significantly increase its fleet of electric cars and long @-@ term change@@ over to environmentally friendly vehicles in the long run .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will make a very , very robust step towards 2020 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said at the end of July . &quot; &quot; &quot;

GR@@ P leadership steps down after dis@@ ap@@ pointing business figures
the consumer research company Gf@@ K exchanges his head Matthias Hart@@ mann .
the re@@ sign@@ ations suddenly came suddenly - but not surprisingly .
the difficult situation of the market research company Gf@@ K showed that the chair of Chief Executive Officer Matthias Hart@@ mann will be all the more in@@ secure , the longer the success promised by him .
turbul@@ ence at the top of the Nuremberg market research company Gf@@ K : after again dis@@ ap@@ pointing business figures and the re@@ sign@@ ation of the company &apos;s leadership , the global number Five of the industry faces a personalised new beginning .
G@@ FR@@ P Executive Board intends to leave the company at the end of the year .
the Chairman of the Gf@@ K Supervisory Council Ar@@ no Mahl@@ ert already reti@@ res from the super@@ visory committee with effect from 12 September .
the management of the Executive Board over@@ take the previous board member Gerhard Haus@@ jer@@ inger as of 1 September , divided the company .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he should officially take over the function of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; CEO &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; until a successor for Hart@@ mann was found . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; as a reason for the re@@ sign@@ ation , the company called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; different views &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the long @-@ term commercial orientation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
details did not want to mention a company spokes@@ man on Friday .
who in future will lead the market research company , is still un@@ clear .
in investor @-@ circles it was called on Friday , at least in the shareholders , the dis@@ appointment had been large over the continued success of the restructuring of the years ago .
Mr. Hart@@ mann has been at the Gf@@ K top since 2011 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the fruits of restructuring , however , are not yet to be seen after 5 years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
given the latest poor Gf@@ K business figures , each of the shareholders will eventually become rest@@ less .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if it were the case with BMW , it would also make the Qu@@ and@@ ts so , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after set@@ backs in the previous quarters , the company did not have to stop its losses in the second quarter of 2016 .
with a total of 36@@ 1.2 million euros , sales were 6.1 percent below the level of the comparable period of the previous year .
in the first half of the year , sales decreased by 3.4 per cent with 7@@ 21.@@ 2 million euros .
the profit in the second quarter was particularly affected by the imp@@ licit value of the company in the face of its difficult economic situation .
the consolidated value sales of 139 million euros , which were necessary in the Consumer Experience business unit , submitted a loss of 14@@ 8.2 million euros under the stake .
in the second quarter of 2015 , the Gf@@ K posted a net profit of 19.@@ 7 million .
accidents - Bus slides in Krum@@ m@@ hör@@ n in dit@@ ch : eight wounded
in an accident of a travel agency with 43 sen@@ iors as passengers , eight people were injured in Krum@@ m@@ hör@@ n ( Land@@ kreis Aur@@ ich ) on Thursday .
two of the occup@@ ants suffered severe injuries , the police shared with them .
the 66 @-@ year @-@ old driver of the coach of a travel business from Eisen@@ ach had to ev@@ ade her according to a counter@@ act truck , which drove partly on the counter@@ part .
the bus came to the right of the road and sli@@ d into a dit@@ ch , like a spokes@@ person for the police Aur@@ ich / Witt@@ mund reported .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the location of the bus , people could not leave the bus independently , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the fire bri@@ g@@ ade liber@@ ated the occup@@ ants .
six ambul@@ ances and ambul@@ ances came to the accident at the provincial road 2 .
the un@@ injured travelers were brought back from a regular bus back to the Krum@@ m@@ hör@@ ner district of Pe@@ w@@ sum .
there they should wait for a replacement bus of the travel company .
the investig@@ ators demanded the load experience and possible witnesses to report to the police .
the fees per cubic metre wast@@ e@@ water are from 1 October 2016 for the area of the Neu@@ dorf / Re@@ uth / Wel@@ sch@@ enk@@ ahl 3,@@ 44 instead of previously 2.10 euro ; for Zul@@ ten@@ berg / Lin@@ denberg / Lop@@ p 3,@@ 36 Euro ( so far 2,@@ 26 euros ) and for Az@@ endorf 3,@@ 64 Euro ( so far 2,@@ 18 euros ) .
at the plant in Az@@ endorf , the drainage fee will further increase once more if appropriate improvement measures are necessary .
after a per@@ tin@@ ent calculation , the se@@ wage price in Az@@ endorf is then at 4.@@ 37 euros per cubic meter .
as Mayor Bernd Stein@@ häuser ( CS@@ U ) reported , it was found in the authorization of the budget by the Land@@ rat@@ samt Kul@@ mb@@ ach that under@@ covers these wast@@ e@@ water installations .
due to legal foundations , the market Kas@@ endorf is oblig@@ ated to operate the equipment at a cost @-@ effective manner .
from October 1 , 2016 , the citizens as well as the industrial and industrial enterprises from Wel@@ sch@@ enk@@ ahl , Neu@@ dorf , Re@@ uth , Az@@ endorf , Lop@@ p , Lin@@ denberg and Zul@@ ten@@ berg will have to go deeper into the pur@@ se .
the fee increases are between 48 and 67 percent .
as Chairman of the Board of Directors , Herbert Schmidt presented the committee , a re @-@ calculation of the fees for the wast@@ e@@ water systems of the market community was necessary .
in the period from October 2016 to September 2020 survival and under@@ cover from the previous calculation period are also to be compens@@ ated .
Schmidt founded the gra@@ ving fee increases so that there were relatively small facilities with a very low se@@ wage treatment plant , which ran between 6@@ 800 and 1@@ 2000 cubic meters per year .
due to the low distribution base for example expenses for necessary repairs of several thousand Euros would be engra@@ ved .
in addition , the waste water in all three systems is slightly decl@@ ining .
furthermore , in the past calculation period in all three systems , not least due to their age , refurb@@ ishment and repair costs have fallen to a considerable extent .
the plant in Az@@ endorf was almost 30 years old , the facilities for Wel@@ sch@@ enk@@ ahl , Neu@@ dorf and Re@@ uth as well as Zul@@ ten@@ berg , Lin@@ denberg and Lop@@ p almost 20 years .
Schmidt proved that in the se@@ wage plant Az@@ endorf had to be replaced the mechanical ventilation system due to damage .
in the pump station Wel@@ sch@@ enk@@ ahl , the nearly 20 years old conveyor systems had to be over@@ hau@@ led and in the pond treatment plant Lop@@ p , after nearly 20 years operation the first se@@ wage pond was exp@@ elled , the se@@ wage slu@@ dge dispos@@ es and an additional ventilation can be installed in order to keep the water @-@ legal requirements even in the future .
Schmidt : &quot; to these extraordinary expenses came the continual support and maintenance costs , which must be taken into account in the new calculation period . &quot;
the same applies to electricity costs , which were still clearly below the current level during the previous calculation in 2011 / 2012 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; stone houses made clear that in the three systems the expenses for the operation and maintenance were &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fully penet@@ rated &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Schmidt , the market community of major entertainment costs have been spar@@ ed during the last 20 years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the situation for the mentioned systems will continue to remain prec@@ ari@@ ous according to stone houses , especially since the supply area of Fri@@ esen@@ b@@ acht@@ al wast@@ e@@ water sports association cannot be extended , because it is a defic@@ it unit .
Bulgaria books for the first time in 8 months of inflation
national statistics show that inflation in Bulgaria in July was 1 % on a monthly basis .
this is the highest value ( since June 2012 ) and the first over zero since October last year , when positive 0.2 % were recorded .
the annual average annual inflation of the last 12 months ( August 2015 - July 2016 ) compared to the previous 12 months ( August 2014 - July 2015 ) was measured according to the CP@@ I -@@ 0.8 % .
the consumer price index in July 2016 compared to June 2016 was 10@@ 1.0 % , that is , the monthly rate of inflation was 1.0 % .
the inflation rate since the beginning of the year ( July 2016 compared to December 2015 ) was -@@ 0.2 % and the annual inflation in July 2016 compared to July 2015 was -@@ 0.2 % .
in July 2016 , a price increase in the following groups of consumer goods was observed in July 2016 : food and non @-@ alcoholic beverages ( 1,7 % ) ; transport ( 1,8 % ) ; leisure and culture ( 6.3 % ) ; restaurants and hotels ( 1,2 % ) ; different goods and services ( 0.3 % ) .
prices fell in clothes and shoes ( 2.2 % ) ; furniture , household appliances and routine maintenance ( 0.5 % ) ; health ( 0.1 % ) .
prices remained as in the previous month with alcoholic beverages and tobacco ; flats , water , electricity , gas and other fuels ; communication ; as well as education unchanged .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Snap@@ chat &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; An@@ ime &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; effect as an Asian car@@ ic@@ ature &quot; &quot; &quot;
Snap@@ chat says that this filter is An@@ ime @-@ inspired , but some ob@@ servers say it is in@@ sensitive to bre@@ eds .
with its filter tool , the Snap@@ chat allows about 150 million daily users to change reality and play with ident@@ ities in such a way that already borders the absur@@ dity .
you can turn into a p@@ ine@@ apple , a dog or a figure that could be of a Roy Licht@@ enstein painting .
the filters are bl@@ unt , stand@@ alone @-@ rotating tools that generate more than 30 million sel@@ fies per day .
all false appearances come to the public .
Snap@@ chat filters have drawn critic@@ isms in the past in which they were accused of promoting black@@ face pump@@ ing or white skin as a beauty ideal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when this week suggested some users a filter that gave them sli@@ t eyes , false teeth and aw@@ ake che@@ eks , some critics called it a rac@@ ist car@@ ic@@ ature of Asi@@ ans - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yellow @-@ faced &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they asked if these repeated contro@@ vers@@ y had shown a larger problem that the company has diversity .
the news and indi@@ gn@@ ation were widely distributed on Wednesday , with reports from The Ver@@ ge and Mother@@ board , one day after Snap@@ chat shared that it had de@@ activated the feature .
the company offered an exc@@ use : the filter was intended as an hom@@ age to anim@@ e characters and not as car@@ ic@@ ature of Asi@@ ans .
but out@@ si@@ ders who experienced rac@@ is@@ sm@@ us reminded the filter of inj@@ urious c@@ lich@@ és .
others rejected the An@@ ime comparison .
in an e @-@ mail Grace Spar@@ ap@@ ani wrote a Korean @-@ American art student whose twe@@ et was widespread over the photos that the filter was &quot; vulnerable and &quot; said unpleasant . &quot;
she added that &quot; it is difficult to argue with the comparison of a very contradi@@ c@@ tory Asian car@@ ic@@ ature and the filter effects .
it shows that the filter is not yel@@ low@@ ish , but that the yellow @-@ face has been pulled into the stri@@ pping extre@@ m .
Snap@@ chat is not the only company that crosses this cultural drift .
the American culture seems to be involved in an endless diversity of diversity and integration , from conference rooms to Hollywood and the devices we all hold in hand .
and Snap@@ chat &apos;s large audience of young people - who are di@@ vers@@ ed as their older opponents - could expect more to expect sensitivity .
when one of Snap@@ chat filters creates a picture that is ins@@ ul@@ ting for a user , &quot; so it is much more difficult that such things remain un@@ noticed when it was the case , &quot; said the 25 @-@ year @-@ old K@@ atie Z@@ hu in an interview on Thursday .
on Thursday , Z@@ hu decided to work as a product manager and engineer for medium to delete their Snap@@ chat account and ur@@ ged others to do the same .
in an ess@@ ay for Medium and in a telephone interview , she said that she believes that r@@ acial @-@ related contro@@ vers@@ y reflects a lack of diversity among the settings practices at Snap@@ chat .
Z@@ hu crit@@ ici@@ zed the partially white , only male leadership and ended up with a h@@ ash@@ tag : # Del@@ et@@ e@@ Snap@@ chat .
&quot; either they have no different representation of people with other skin colours in their workforce so that they can make such decisions , &quot; said the Chinese @-@ American Z@@ hu , &quot; or they have people with other skin colours that work there , but not in positions in which they feel safe or comfortable to say something about it . &quot;
others share their opinion , a complaint that Snap@@ chat mostly left un@@ answered .
the company does not publish figures on the diversity of its employees and points to its status as private company .
on Thursday , Snap@@ chat declined to discuss the cultural backgrounds of its employees , but according to a subscri@@ ber , the company has recently hired a personnel manager that focuses on under@@ represented population groups and on internal integration efforts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on my part , Z@@ hu said that she will be closed to her Snap@@ chat account and added , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I wonder if they need more users like us to say that it is not O.@@ K. . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
military leadership precip@@ it@@ ates IS@@ IS secret intelligence information , con@@ fron@@ ts the committee of Congress
military members of the United States Central Command set new intelligence in order to draw an optim@@ istic picture of the war against the so @-@ called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria , when the actual conditions were allowed on site , an enquiry committee of the Congress reported in a report on Thursday .
the preliminary report , created by a Task Force of Republi@@ can Member of the Army Commit@@ tees , Intelligence Commit@@ tees , and the Def@@ ender of Defense , reports of great dis@@ satisfaction among Central Command Intelligence analysts who reported how to change their assess@@ ments to American efforts in the fight against the Islamic state .
central Command , short Cen@@ com , is the military headquarters in T@@ ampa , Florida , which controls American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; intelligence services that were typically disp@@ at@@ ched by high @-@ ranking Cent@@ Com com@@ man@@ ders regularly signed a positive image of the American efforts against terrorism as it allowed the actual states on site and were consistently positive as analyses of other intelligence services , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; quoted a newspaper article . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what happened at Cent@@ Com is un@@ acceptable - our soldiers suffer if bad analyses are presented to our political leaders , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ en Cal@@ vert , re@@ publi@@ can member of the House of Represent@@ atives . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the leading errors in the Cent@@ Com reach the top of the organization .
the ten @-@ page report shows detailed contin@@ gen@@ cies in the years 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of American efforts in the training of the Ira@@ qi forces .
although there is no direct evidence that government tips under Obama have given instructions to change reports , it shows how analy@@ st exposed the pressure from their superior laws , an optim@@ istic picture of the threat of the Islamic State , also known as IS@@ IS or IS@@ IL .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during the first half of 2015 , many Central Command press releases , statements and statements before the congress were clearly more positive than the facts , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stated the report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for example , a Cent@@ com An@@ gehö@@ ri@@ ger publicly announced that a military re@@ conquest of Mos@@ s@@ ulp@@ s could already begin in April or May 2015 .
Mos@@ ul , the second largest city in Iraq , remains under the control of the Islamic State .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after months of investigations , so much is clear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mike Pom@@ pe@@ o , Republi@@ can Con@@ gres@@ s@@ man from Kan@@ sas , in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
from the middle of 2014 until the middle of 2015 , Central Command has changed the intelligence reports to play down the threat of IS@@ IS in Iraq .
the Re@@ public@@ ans called the Task Force to live after they were admitted that analysts were worried about the manipulation of reports on the Islamic state .
the report published on Thursday will be completed by more detailed insights , while the investigations will continue .
in addition , further investigation of Cent@@ Com reports by the Secretary @-@ General of the Department of Defense is underway .
democratic Members of the Intelligence Committee issued their own findings on Thursday that agree with some of the conclusions of the Republi@@ can Task Force .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2014 and 2015 , Cent@@ Com also created a moder@@ ately limited process for the creation of thou@@ ght@@ ful assess@@ ments to IS@@ IL and the Ira@@ qi security services , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the highest @-@ ranking democr@@ at in the committee , member of the House of Represent@@ atives , Adam B. Schiff , announced in an opinion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this process , such as Mr. Schiff , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; delayed the publication of intelligence reports , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; compens@@ ated the mor@@ als under analy@@ st and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gave too little space for diver@@ gent opinions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but Mr. Schiff and the Democrats gave no indication of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; certain political opinion &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; intervention in the Cent@@ com analy@@ st . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the preliminary results of the investigations of the congress were published on Tuesday by &quot; The Daily Be@@ ast . &quot;
last August , the New York Times reported an investigation by the Pentagon &apos;s Chief In@@ spec@@ tor , who were recorded after complaints from Cent@@ Com analysts .
Lt@@ . C@@ m@@ dr@@ . Patrick Ev@@ ans , a Pentagon Press spokes@@ man , gave in a statement that the Defense Department would not comment on the Congress , while the investigations of the general inspec@@ tor are still in progress .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but he also admitted that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; experts sometimes have diver@@ gent opinions on the interpretation of complex data , and that the intelligence services and the Ministry of Defense welcome a controversi@@ al discussion on these important issues of national defence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the investigations have reper@@ c@@ ussions on the question of a successful a@@ erial campaign under American leadership in Iraq and Syria ( an alle@@ g@@ ation that is now being made by a growing number of members of the Department of Defense ) .
the alle@@ g@@ ations of last year , however , raised the question of how President Obama can rely on the Central Command for honest assess@@ ments of military operations in Iraq , Afghanistan , Libya and other crisis regions .
the criticism concerning the secret information about the Islamic state remind of dis@@ agreements of more than ten years ago , as a cent@@ com analy@@ st , Greg@@ ory Hoo@@ ker , a written article about how the then government under George W. Bush expected only a small occupation force in Iraq and had little time to worry about the consequences of the invasion of 2003 .
Mr. Hoo@@ ker also played a key role in the revol@@ t against the current coverage of the Islamic State .
last year , the team headed by Mr. Hoo@@ ker stated that contrary to the statements made by the government , air@@ strikes against the refin@@ eries held by the Islamic State would have no significant impact on the financial situation of the terrorist group , as these pro@@ visional refin@@ eries had put into operation to sell oil on the black market .
however , this knowledge was not published , the Times reported in September .
Cent@@ Com &apos;s former commander , Gen@@ . Lloyd J. Austin III , was critic@@ ised by members of the legisl@@ ature because of its over@@ ly positive app@@ rais@@ al of the war situation at a hearing before the Senate .
general Austin retired in April and was replaced with the Central Command by Gen@@ . Joseph L. V@@ otel .
the US wins fourth match in the field ho@@ ckey of women , a show@@ down with the UK .
one day after it had shot three gates during a 6 @-@ 1 victory over Japan , K@@ atie B@@ am also made the first two goals for the American field ho@@ ckey team of women in a match on Thursday against India that the Americans won 3 @-@ 0 .
five gates in two games should actually represent a memorable performance , but B@@ am ( 27 ) said she couldn &apos;t remember that ever done .
&quot; I have no idea . &quot; she said .
I do not belong to the people who keep their doors in mind .
but that knows them : the Americans are at 4 @-@ 0 in the Olympic competition , and they are still in their group with the British on the first place , who remain un@@ defeated after their 2 @-@ 0 victory against Japan .
Britain and the United States will meet on Saturday in the last game of the first round .
both teams have already qualified for the quarter @-@ final , the game will decide which of the two teams will win the first and second place within their group of six teams .
the first placed will take a little longer to the strong D@@ ut@@ ch@@ man who will lead the other group .
whatever the game takes on Saturday , the Americans have triggered a surprising vor@@ tex by their success story , four years after they finished in the last London games on the last of 12 places .
BA@@ M was part of this team .
she grew up in Blue Bell , Pennsylvania , and had the first time with three years a Ho@@ ckey Clubs in hands ( her two older sisters played sports at Dre@@ xel University ) , with 16 years she became national player of the USA , the youngest in the history of the team .
she missed the Olympics in 2008 because she could not qualify for the cad@@ re .
then came the year 2012 , in which for her and her team everything went wrong .
in the following year Cra@@ ig Par@@ n@@ ham , an Engl@@ ish@@ man , trainer of the National Team and thus began to make things better .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a cultural change , a mental change and a physical change , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said B@@ am . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we did not have the work@@ load in London that we now have .
we have been able to s@@ nat@@ ch the rod completely .
on Thursday evening , B@@ am opened the tor@@ ch in the first half of the game with a back@@ stop of the close range .
India had gone into the game without victory in the tournament , but the team proved surprisingly tough and held the game level from 1 @-@ 0 to the third quarter until B@@ am took the game into her hands .
she performed a spr@@ int with the flat ball over the left flan@@ k , then moved into the middle and pl@@ ough@@ ed the ball to the gate to give the American female a 2 @-@ 0 guidance .
Mel@@ issa Gonz@@ al@@ ez made the final goal in the middle of the last quarter .
the Sh@@ ut@@ out was the first of the whole tournament for the US &apos;s go@@ al@@ ke@@ epers , Jack@@ ie Brig@@ gs , who had previously had to book a goal in each of the previous games .
it has a run .
just like B@@ am .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are in a good position &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Par@@ n@@ ham , but how good will depend on the outcome of the next game on Saturday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
amid the R@@ age of the Olympic Games , the Zen of the trampoline
wherever you are , how late it is , it is the Olympic Games .
the events in Rio de Jan@@ eiro feel constantly and in@@ vari@@ ably , a rapid eas@@ el between competition and aspir@@ ation .
it is as if the ol@@ ymp@@ ic tor@@ ch itself is a burning rod , which is handed down from the br@@ acel@@ ets to the swi@@ mmer to the tri@@ ath@@ l@@ ete .
you can &apos;t turn off the TV , read a newspaper or listen to your neighbours during the queu@@ e in the coffee shop without hearing about Simone Bil@@ es , K@@ atie Le@@ deck@@ y or the dispute between Michael P@@ helps and C@@ had le C@@ los .
and then there is Log@@ an Do@@ ol@@ ey .
Do@@ ol@@ ey , who is at the Olympic Games for the first time and a wom@@ b with dim@@ ples , could have been among these well @-@ known names being sent to Prime Time , by sponsors and ben@@ evol@@ ent TV commerci@@ als , if he would be a swi@@ mmer , gymn@@ ast@@ ics or even fun@@ nel .
but Do@@ ol@@ ey , 28 , from Lake Forest , California , fights in the ol@@ ymp@@ ic tramp@@ ol@@ ines around gold .
the ol@@ ymp@@ ic flame does not illumin@@ ate any event the same .
further from the center , partially in the shade there are the sports that are not generally accepted : air pist@@ ol shooting , ar@@ chery , bad@@ min@@ ton , Ta@@ ek@@ won@@ do .
we will always have the breast swim and may it reign for a long time .
but if I should show arguments for my particular favourite , let me draw attention to the discre@@ et charm of the trampoline .
although the trampoline jumping has been an ol@@ ymp@@ ic event since 2000 , when it had its debut in Sydney , the last 16 years it became so spar@@ se that many of those I had asked do not know that there is actually an Olympic sport .
this could also be regional ignorance .
although the US sent athletes to a competition , it has never won a med@@ al in tramp@@ ol@@ ines and until 2012 has had an ath@@ l@@ ete who made it to the final round .
the Chinese and the Russi@@ ans tend to share prices for the men and the Chinese and Canadi@@ ans for women .
Dong Dong from China and Ro@@ sie Mac@@ L@@ enn@@ an from Canada will defend their gold med@@ al from London this year .
the trampoline jumping has a certain out@@ sider charm , partly because it sounds suitable for the un@@ enlighten@@ ed ear for a c@@ low@@ ic school than that sounds for the Olympic Games .
at this point , I should admit that I am not an expert , but only a bear@@ ded enthusi@@ ast .
it has hum@@ orous potential - the carto@@ on@@ ous tre@@ mor of his never @-@ ending up@@ sur@@ ge - but also the Gra@@ zie of the gymn@@ asi@@ um and the do@@ ve , the two sports that it combines in essence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; trampoline &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comes from the Spanish El Tramp@@ oline , which means as much as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; spr@@ ing@@ board &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
emerging vic@@ tors jump on a gigantic trampoline , shoot almost up to 30 feet in the air and have a number of falling movements ( turning , pi@@ ke and sal@@ tos ) before they land on their feet .
according to the official Olympic ogram , they are assessed according to design , level of difficulty and &quot; flight time . &quot;
thirty @-@ two athletes from 17 countries , 16 men and 16 women , will compete against each other in Rio .
the most common ol@@ ymp@@ ic v@@ ector is straight .
med@@ alli@@ sts have to go on in their pursu@@ it of gold , faster , upward and over , sometimes up to the finish , sometimes back and forth , up and down on the playground .
they do not only hunt the finish line or the output wall , but also another goal in television transmission : that of the world or the Olympi@@ ar of the Olympics .
the goal @-@ oriented aspir@@ ation is no@@ bel , admir@@ able , even fan@@ atic - and it is enough to stir even a spect@@ ator to tears .
but it is also what I find myself ti@@ ring when watching those games .
the trampoline offers an at@@ emp@@ ause .
the v@@ ector of the trampoline is above .
a forward movement is not the goal .
he or she dies off , seemingly wei@@ ght@@ less like an ast@@ ron@@ aut , goes up , then down@@ wards , then effort@@ lessly back up .
there is also a competition , of course , not without difficulty , but during exercise there is no hec@@ tic attack on the goal , no wol@@ ves into the distance , only the dre@@ amy , elegant lifting of time and gravity .
it &apos;s as Zen as the competition in the Olympics only can be .
the qualifying and final round of women will take place on Friday afternoon , in streaming at 13.00 Eastern Time ; the men on Saturday , also at 13.00 .
N@@ BC will radi@@ ate the final rounds as part of a afternoon block on both days from 14.00 .
in the midst of the Olympics , they promise a quiet , nice moment , one that is likely to over@@ look in general tur@@ mo@@ il .
when the increase of consciousness can only be achieved by the att@@ aining and the objec@@ ti@@ fication of male athletes - as the male US gymn@@ asts proposed recently - then Mr. Do@@ ol@@ ey expects his air rin@@ se , new fan base .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a generation protests &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Ethiopia , Long an Al@@ lies of the USA &quot; &quot; &quot;
violent protests in Ethiopia
demonstr@@ ators demanding political changes in Ethiopia are pushing for violent resistance to the government .
witnesses say that tens of thousands of prot@@ esters were killed during coll@@ isions with the police .
is Ethiopia just going to collapse ?
in the last ten years , it was one of Africa &apos;s most stable countries , a solid ally of the West with a rapidly growing economy .
but in recent months protests against the government sh@@ ook the country and expanded into more and more areas .
last week thousands of people stor@@ med down the streets and demanded fundamental political changes .
according to human rights organisations , the response of the government was mer@@ ciful .
witnesses said that polic@@ emen shot and killed tens of un@@ armed demonstr@@ ators .
in circulation , videos about the protests , which are probably from the last or early of this year , show how security people strike young people with sticks , while they were forced to make a stand against a wall .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the chief of the UN Human Rights authority now requires an out@@ going investigation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was always difficult to hold this country together and in the future it will even become even more difficult , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ras@@ hid Ab@@ di , the project leader of the Horn of Africa of the International Cris@@ is Group , a research group . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ethiopia is the most pop@@ ulous country in Africa , and its stability is estimated by the West .
American military and secret services work closely with the Ethiop@@ ians to fight terror across the region , especially in Somalia . only a few countries in Africa , if at all , get so much Western aid .
Ethiopia &apos;s economy expanded at a considerable pace .
its infrastructure has dramatically improved - there is a new comm@@ uter train in the capital Ad@@ dis Abe@@ ba .
the roads are generally quiet , safe and clean .
even though Ethiopia was anything but a model for democracy - human rights organisations have constantly led the re@@ pression by the government - the opposition in the country has been restricted , while dis@@ si@@ dents were effectively sil@@ enced .
many were sent into exile or j@@ ail , killed or driven into the expan@@ se of the desert .
but that could change .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you supp@@ ress people and have no other options except to protest , it breaks out , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Sey@@ ou@@ m Tes@@ sa , a lec@@ turer in central Ethiopia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the whole youth protests .
a generation protests .
there are numerous complaints that cover everything from ground use to stran@@ gle@@ hold in relation to the power of the ruling coalition .
following a preliminary vote last year , the ruling party and its allies received the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 percent of parliament .
at the same time , tensions continue along the border to Er@@ it@@ rea ; a fight for this cr@@ ack@@ y , controversi@@ al line called for hundreds of lives in June .
analysts fear that separ@@ ati@@ sts like the Oro@@ mo Liber@@ ation Front , or the National Liber@@ ation Front of the O@@ g@@ aden , which have been defeated more or less in recent years , exploit the turbul@@ ence and re@@ ar@@ ming itself .
several factors explain why feelings of bitter@@ ness explo@@ de after years of being in@@ tox@@ icated under the surface .
the first seems harm@@ less : smartphones .
in recent years , many of the Ethiop@@ ians were able to communicate with social media , as cheap smartphones were becoming more and more common and the internet services improved .
even if the government blocked access to Facebook and Twitter , what they do in regular intervals , especially in protests , many people can still communicate via Internet pro@@ x@@ ies that hide where they are .
several young Ethiopia announced that they were thus gathered to protest .
the second factor is that there is more solidarity between the Oro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as , the two largest ethnic groups in Ethiopia .
the Oro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as are not natural enemies .
for e@@ ons , the Am@@ har@@ as , who from Ethiopia are predominantly Christian high@@ lands , prosp@@ ered in politics and economy while they exploited the Oro@@ mos , many of whom are Muslims and live in low@@ land areas .
but this is also changing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are here to co @-@ ordin@@ ate under a screen , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mul@@ atu Gem@@ ech@@ u , a leader of the Oro@@ mos . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the biggest protests took place in areas of Am@@ har@@ a and Oro@@ mos .
many Am@@ har@@ as and Oro@@ mos have the feeling that Ethiopia is un@@ fair dominated by members of the ethnic group of the tig@@ ray that account about 6 percent of the population and dominant in the military , in the secret services , in trade and politics .
the third reason for the un@@ rest is the death of Mel@@ es Zen@@ awi .
Mr. Mel@@ es , a former re@@ bel leader , was until his death on a non @-@ publi@@ ci@@ zed disease in 2012 17 years of Ethiopia &apos;s prime minister .
he was regarded as tac@@ tical gen@@ ius , a man who could think around corners .
analysts say that he was especially well vers@@ ed in percei@@ ving early signs of dis@@ satisfaction and using special officers to manip@@ ulate opponents and make them harm@@ less .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the current regime l@@ acks this fundamental skill , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr Ab@@ di , a conflict analy@@ st . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ethiopia &apos;s new Prime Minister , H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am Des@@ al@@ eg@@ n , was selected for relatively un@@ c@@ auti@@ ous reasons to take the position of Mr Mel@@ es .
unlike Mr Mel@@ es , who came from the Tig@@ ray region of Ethiopia , Mr. H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am comes from the South .
analysts say that he does not enjoy the confidence of the security services controlled by the Tig@@ ray .
many fear that the result will be more blood@@ shed .
the last time Ethiopia had witnessed such an uph@@ e@@ av@@ al in 2005 , after thousands of elections prot@@ ested , which , according to the analy@@ st statements , were apparently dep@@ rec@@ ated by the government and then stolen .
during the subsequent ra@@ ids , many prot@@ esters were killed even if it was less than in the past few months and this time of un@@ rest was passed relatively quickly .
development experts praised Ethiopia &apos;s leaders for their vision@@ ary infrastructure planning , such as the new comm@@ uter train , as well as for their meas@@ urable progress in poverty reduction .
but apparently this did not prevent the intensi@@ fication of the internal ab@@ hor@@ ment of the Ethiop@@ ian government .
and it adop@@ ts a dangerous ethnic shape .
last month , prot@@ esters in Gon@@ dar , an am@@ har@@ ic city , conducted by Tig@@ ray , and the hatred towards the Tig@@ ray is becoming more and more common in social media .
analysts say that the protests hit the US and other Western allies into a peculi@@ ar position .
the American government used Ethiopia as the basis for D@@ ron@@ en@@ flights over the neighboring Somalia , even though they recently announced that it closed this base .
while the West clearly wants to support democracy , it does not want its ally to collapse in an already vol@@ at@@ ile region .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr Ab@@ di , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a very thin tigh@@ trop@@ e walk . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Donald Tr@@ ump declares his statement Obama has founded IS@@ IS was &quot; sar@@ cas@@ m &quot;
Donald J. Tr@@ ump attempts to disp@@ el the last contro@@ vers@@ y on Friday that surro@@ unds his campaign by fear@@ ing that his repeatedly repeated claims , President Obama and H@@ illary Clinton would be the &quot; founders &quot; of the terrorist group Islamic State , not seriously meant .
this clar@@ ification raised new questions on the communication skills of the Republi@@ can candidate , whether he would be able to communicate clearly and understand@@ ably with the American public .
it also brings his fellow comb@@ at@@ ants who endeav@@ our to take him into protection during an event@@ ful phase , to explain the peculi@@ ar position , declar@@ ations he could not have meant .
after he had made the hint at an election campaign on Wednesday evening , Mr. Tr@@ ump cancelled in relation to the asser@@ tion on Thursday and insist@@ ed in interviews that he really did not intend to suggest the president and Mrs. Clinton would have created IS@@ IS .
but in an early morning twe@@ et on Friday Mr. Tr@@ ump said he was simply sar@@ c@@ astic .
the twe@@ et was the contrast to the previous day , where Mr. Tr@@ ump said in a number of interviews , he meant the accus@@ ation completely serious .
when the conservative radi@@ om@@ or@@ ator H@@ ugh He@@ wit@@ t wants Mr. Tr@@ ump to we@@ aken the statement by remin@@ ding him that Mr. Obama wants to destroy IS@@ IS , the Republi@@ can candidate didn &apos;t want to know about it .
the last storm of cr@@ itic fires down on Mr. Tr@@ ump , while trying to direct the focus of his campaign because of falling demand values to the economic situation .
Mr. Tr@@ ump and Mrs. Clinton talking about the economic situation in Michigan this week .
on Friday Mr. Tr@@ ump attempts to return to this subject again .
reporting on Twitter , he warned that Mrs. Clin@@ tons would lead to higher taxes and that he found her speech d@@ ull .
Mr. Tr@@ ump has already pre@@ ached sar@@ cas@@ m for his defense .
at the end of July he drew strong criticism when he said the Russi@@ ans were supposed to h@@ ack Mrs. Clinton &apos;s emails , but he later said &quot; Of course , I told the sar@@ c@@ astic . &quot;
this method allows Mr. Tr@@ ump to post@@ p@@ one the linguistic boundaries in politics and then return to demand .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think it &apos;s one of his methods to test how certain messages will be recorded by his fans as they arrive , and then &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; clarify &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; depending on how the reaction arises . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ruth Sherman , a communication expert who ob@@ serves the language of both candidates . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but I also believe he &apos;s clever enough to keep his statements v@@ ague enough so that they can be interpreted in various ways .
instead of def@@ ying the tone for the presidential elections , Mr. Tr@@ ump has accepted an even more cau@@ stic tone as his read@@ ings have gone further .
a new survey conducted by N@@ BC / Wall Street Journal / Mar@@ ist , which was published on Friday , showed a lead in the states North Carolina , Virginia , Colorado and a head @-@ to @-@ head race in Florida .
while Mr. Tr@@ ump in general tries to exc@@ use himself for his pro@@ voc@@ ative statements , he often accused his critics to dist@@ ort his statements or mis@@ understand his or her hum@@ or .
but while he is increasingly focusing attention in the last months of his presidential campaign , Mr. Tr@@ umps &apos;s sc@@ iss@@ ors have brought his loyal competitors into the un@@ comfortable situation , regardless of how pro@@ voc@@ ative might be his statements .
Rudol@@ ph W. Giuli@@ ani , former mayor of New York and one of the most prominent inter@@ cess@@ es , gave a great deal of effort to defend the candidate in a CN@@ N interview from Thursday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I believe what he says are legitimate , political comments &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr. Giuli@@ ani , so he was asked for the correctness of Mr. Tr@@ umps statements , whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic State . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is true in this sense that before Obama , IS@@ IS was an almost unknown , small organisation , he called them back @-@ bear@@ er , completely wrong and therefore it happened because he pulled the troops out of Iraq .
most mainst@@ ream Re@@ public@@ ans try to argue that the Obama administration , in which Mrs. Clinton served as a foreign minister , allowed IS@@ IS to spread the situation in the Middle East aggres@@ sively under control .
before the election events in Pennsylvania on Friday Mr. Tr@@ ump continued his attacks on the media and threw them out on each of his words and to be prejudi@@ ced against him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he de@@ fied the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; poor , dark &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; TV experts who try to understand him and said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; You cannot ! &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some of the democr@@ ats mo@@ cked at Mr. Tr@@ umps &apos;s exc@@ use than just another proof that he was un@@ suitable for the presi@@ dency .
once upon the price of the market displ@@ aced , Café in Green@@ point returns
Ver@@ b Cafe was a non @-@ smo@@ ked café in Willi@@ am@@ sburg , where you could only pay cash , which had no Wi @-@ Fi but served for 15 years of good coffee .
of course , the prices from his Bed@@ ford Avenue shop front were displ@@ aced .
So@@ ap Ch@@ erie business , replacing the verb in summer 2014 , sells soap in the form of cup@@ cakes .
locals wor@@ e it as the last loss in a gent@@ ri@@ fying city .
the artist Mol@@ ly Cr@@ ab@@ oot wrote on Twitter , &quot; I know , New York is change , but I still can &apos;t believe that CB@@ GB is dead , the Chelsea Hotel is excluded and Ver@@ b is now a soap shop . &quot;
but when New York is change , it is re @-@ invention .
a re@@ vit@@ alized Ver@@ b Cafe opened last November in Green@@ point , less than a mile north of its original location .
the new verb has Wi @-@ Fi and accepts credit cards , but still has some of the same staff and a similarly simple atmosphere .
the coffee is still good .
the new owner of the verb is Cisco Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , a long @-@ standing employee of the old cafes , the owner and managing director of the new coffee shop .
he started working with Ver@@ b in 2001 and remained there until the end .
when a customer offered to provide funds for a new foreign office , he was excited to do it , he said .
Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , 36 , kept a lot .
verb uses the same Distribut@@ or for the bag@@ els , the same es@@ pres@@ so machine model .
it even uses the same lamps from the old verb .
but Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he wanted to experiment .
he introduced new ingredients .
on the menu there are sand@@ wi@@ ches with bac@@ on and cheese and there are gar@@ n@@ ings like cap@@ ers and s@@ aut@@ é@@ ed onions .
there are natural bow@@ ls .
the café does not serve beer any more , but there are fresh ju@@ ices .
after nine months , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he had noticed a constant stream of old regular customers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many old customers have also been displ@@ aced by prices from Willi@@ am@@ sburg , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
recently on a Sunday , Rebecca Oliv@@ eira was such a customer .
Oliv@@ eira , 34 , lived in Willi@@ am@@ sburg , and visited the verb regularly .
even after she moved to Green@@ point , she would take the path .
after the verb was closed , she gave a while to coffee t@@ ines , she said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I realized that it was on the coffee and on the culture in the verb that struck me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
now she drinks coffee again , even though she ordered a bl@@ ended Cha@@ i Tea on that day instead of her usual I@@ ced coffee , which is another new addition .
Tom Ros@@ enthal has been another long @-@ standing and loyal customer since the beginning of 2003 .
he went there before the work and always ordered the same to be the same .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I came fourth after seven , every day , like a Swiss hand@@ bag and they prepare my Every@@ thing bag@@ el with butter , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
photo Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he wanted to experiment and add new ingredients to the menu .
today Ros@@ enthal still gets his usual order , but sometimes he changes his Every@@ thing Bag@@ el with bac@@ on , egg and cheese .
Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he had no res@@ ent@@ ment over that the soap shop took the old business room .
in fact , the owner of the So@@ ap Ch@@ erie offered to make a special soap for Ver@@ b with the cold bre@@ wed coffee of the coffee table as an ingredient .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we will go down on their offer , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Rodri@@ gu@@ ez . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the traditional , Polish inhabitants of Green@@ point have also accepted the café .
a new customer has translated the menu into Polish and Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he has preferred to put them out soon so that his new neigh@@ bors feel welcome .
the site also has other advantages .
a local saf@@ t@@ shop wants to fill and sell the cold @-@ fried coffee into the bottle .
there is a chance that the café expands to an adjacent building .
for many customers , a new verb is enough to get their old favorites .
Joseph W@@ itt was a regular customer and said he was destroyed at the ground when the cafe closed .
when the new cafe opened , Wh@@ itt said that the sto@@ cking of the Lok@@ al and the Order felt a new coffee like a hom@@ ec@@ oming .
&quot; I had to smell , &quot; he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the de@@ pressing food of the economic crisis in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pl@@ enti@@ ful meal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in March 1933 , shortly after his ascent to the President Fran@@ klin Del@@ ano Ro@@ os@@ ev@@ elt took his lunch at the O@@ val Office .
as a foo@@ die , President Ro@@ os@@ ev@@ elt had a Fai@@ ble for refined Del@@ ik@@ at@@ essen of Fi@@ fth Avenue like P@@ â@@ te de fo@@ ie gr@@ as and Mary@@ land Water@@ tur@@ tle Sou@@ p .
his menu on that day was somewhat modest : filled eggs in tomato sauce , m@@ ashed potatoes and as des@@ sert a pl@@ um pu@@ d@@ ding .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was an act of culinary solidarity with suffering people , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Jane Zi@@ egel@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; her husband Andrew Co@@ e added , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It was also a message to the Americans as they should eat . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the couple lives in Brooklyn Heights and are both food hist@@ orian .
&quot; &quot; &quot; CO@@ Es last book &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; C@@ hop Su@@ ey &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; acted by Chinese cuisine in the US while Zi@@ egel@@ man in her book &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 97 Orch@@ ard &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; relates to life in a residential house on the Lower East Side from the food perspective . &quot; &quot; &quot;
her latest collaboration , &quot; A decent meal , &quot; which will appear on Tuesday at Har@@ per Verlag , illustr@@ ates the history of American cuisine during the Great Depression .
they showed culinary solidarity as they met with a re@@ porter in the Eisen@@ berg &apos;s Sand@@ wich Shop for dinner , a small , car@@ eless snack at the Fl@@ ati@@ ron District , which has been in business since the stock market crash .
Zi@@ egel@@ man , 54 , ordered a fresh cheese sand@@ wich with olive @-@ pieces while co@@ e , 57 , tur@@ key with m@@ ashed potatoes and vegetable mixture .
when the re@@ porter presented Hack@@ br@@ aten , this found the couple suitable for a discussion about the food in the era of Great Depression .
&quot; rich foods were very popular , &quot; said Zi@@ egel@@ man .
there were pe@@ an@@ uts , liver che@@ eses and B@@ ohn@@ en@@ brot .
they were prepared from an ingredient and something cheap that stretches the ingredient .
imagine eating so many pe@@ an@@ uts that they serve them as a dinner .
Co@@ E gr@@ inn@@ ed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it must have put in the stomach as lead , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the years before the Great Depression the table was in an American budget , especially in rural areas , an all @-@ You @-@ Can @-@ E@@ at buffet .
men of women co@@ ded for male field work and it was served freshly baked p@@ â@@ té for breakfast , lunch and dinner .
it was the Americans who sent food to hungry Europeans during the First World War . &quot; a Square Me@@ al &quot; draws the ways with which the country was going to no longer be the land of shame .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was a time when eating for the Americans became a central , ten@@ se issue , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Co@@ e , why he and his wife wanted to write about it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
just as ten@@ se was the new budget : mysterious foods such as bre@@ ads and c@@ asser@@ ol@@ len were added to stap@@ le foods , the c@@ asser@@ ol@@ le as a &quot; wonderful way , &quot; food resi@@ due , &quot; noted Zi@@ egel@@ man , as ch@@ efs were able to hide un@@ appe@@ ti@@ zing ingredients under a cre@@ amy sauce .
fresh fruit has been replaced by cheap dried fruit .
meat , which was the centre of the American cuisine for years , became a rare luxury .
unique mix@@ tures have been tried out , since a low @-@ cal@@ orie and nutr@@ itious satisfaction had priority over taste or even wholes@@ ome kitchen .
during their research for the book , which also includes recipes , Zi@@ egel@@ man prepared a dish from this epoch , baked onions with pe@@ an@@ ut butter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was not a popular supplement at mid@@ day , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Co@@ e . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Zi@@ egel@@ mann continues : &quot; it was sur@@ real . &quot;
pe@@ an@@ ut butter and baked onions are not fit to each other .
it was typical for many of the household recipes .
like never before or ever , fiscal management - including Louise Stan@@ ley , Head of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics from 1923 to 1943 - the eating habits of the country like that .
by publishing recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines , they encouraged women to become &quot; household clean@@ ers &quot; and the challenge to transform p@@ amp@@ e like cre@@ amy sp@@ agh@@ etti with car@@ r@@ ots in delicious meals .
&quot; a Square Me@@ al &quot; is a feast of historical treats .
especially tasty are reports on the response of the government to the hungry citizens , such as President Herbert Hoo@@ vers L@@ ass @-@ me @-@ pie @-@ food @-@ attitude .
while he publicly praised the simple I@@ owa factory kitchen of his kitchen , he saved as a million @-@ million man from the world to which he has become .
&quot; he liked continental cuisine like fish with Gur@@ k@@ ens@@ au@@ ce , &quot; Co@@ e said .
he ate in an almost gil@@ ded dining room and carried a smo@@ king .
he was very close to reality .
President Ro@@ os@@ ev@@ elt might have committed the same mistake if not his wife Ele@@ an@@ or had asked him to st@@ ori@@ ze an est@@ amp with his stomach .
as described in the book , the recru@@ itment of a house@@ ke@@ eper had no interest in flavors by Mrs. Ro@@ os@@ ev@@ elt that the White House produced the most boring food in Washington , but also one of the most comfor@@ ted ones . &quot;
many of the species from the era of Great Depression to deal with food was disc@@ arded as soon as the country returned to the legs .
the legacy is on our continued focus on calories and food , said Zi@@ egel@@ man , as well as on how science was applied to food .
the couple had better understood the eating habits of Zi@@ egel@@ man &apos;s mother @-@ in @-@ law in writing the book - for example how they could not throw food away .
&quot; she had a real fear of the waste of food , &quot; Co@@ e said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Zi@@ egel@@ man remembered : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she actually made people ill . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there was the case of the wind .
after the plates were cleared at Eisen@@ berg &apos;s , they and Co@@ e produced a des@@ sert which they had prepared at home : the pl@@ um des@@ sert , the President Ro@@ os@@ ev@@ elt did lunch .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is called Pr@@ une W@@ hip , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Zi@@ egel@@ man and added that it was a usual trick to miss a nice name . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there was no whi@@ pped cream , only pl@@ ums , some flour , sugar , water and cinnamon .
everyone di@@ ved something re@@ lu@@ ct@@ antly a spo@@ on in the t@@ amed , brown gli@@ b@@ ber .
surprisingly , it was not bad .
Co@@ E repeated three times a supplement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; like a Can @-@ Do @-@ Bud@@ ge@@ ti@@ erer , he said to his wife , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A few chopped wal@@ nuts would help . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
killed in Bom@@ ben attack : he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo
he put his own life on the game to help others : Khal@@ ed O@@ mar .
he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo : Khal@@ ed O@@ mar devoted his life to the people of Syria .
he ris@@ ked everything to save life to others .
now the 30 @-@ year @-@ old has died at a façade attack of the Assad regime .
O@@ mar was a member of the White Helm@@ ets , a civil defence group who , according to Bild @-@ Zeitung , saved the lives of nearly 6@@ 0,000 people .
29@@ 00 Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers place their own lives in order to draw people from bom@@ bed houses and to provide first aid in the war zone .
they are the heroes of the war in Syria .
O@@ mar was the face of the group : a video of the civil servant that showed him during a 11 @-@ hour rescue of an inf@@ ant from the ruins of a house , went around the world in 2014 .
it made the Syri@@ ans a shining symbolic figure in the hor@@ ror of war .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but as heroes he never saw himself , said in the picture , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; For me this is the real ji@@ had . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when I die , save lives , I think God sees in me a mart@@ yr . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
shortly before O@@ mar himself fell victim to an attack , he had spoken in a video about the last bom@@ bing attacks in Syria .
the helicop@@ ters have dropped four barrel bom@@ bs over the Alz@@ adia district , one was filled with chlor@@ ine gas .
a woman and two children died , seven people suffer from breath .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are removing the po@@ ison@@ ous remains of the bom@@ b so that no children play with it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the picture c@@ ites his last words before he died . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the dead@@ ly bom@@ b of the Assad regime had to hit terrorists .
Gr@@ ön@@ land hai : the oldest verteb@@ rate is nearly 400 years old
rare sight .
Greenland &apos;s shar@@ ks usually come to the surface only in winter .
this shar@@ k was allowed to go back to the sea after an investigation on board the ship ship S@@ anna .
he was born in 16@@ 24 and swi@@ ms well at a 1 km / h through the North Atlantic - until today .
Greenland &apos;s shar@@ ks get up with 150 years of offspring .
the Gr@@ ön@@ land shar@@ k usually flo@@ ats along the North Atlantic Ocean , in an hour it reaches an average of just 1,@@ 220 meters .
only when it arrives , the five meter long animal acceler@@ ates to a full 2.6 km / h - and is half as fast as a seal with this top speed .
this lifestyle , em@@ bos@@ sed by slow@@ ness , seems to be a pat@@ ron@@ age for a high age .
Julius Niel@@ sen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report in the journal &quot; Science &quot; at any rate by a Greenland @-@ shar@@ k who could be 392 years old .
&quot; mad@@ ness , &quot; Alexander Sch@@ euer@@ lein comments from the Max Planck Institute for demo@@ graphic research in Rostock this lif@@ esp@@ an , which means a world record for verteb@@ rates .
although the evolution@@ ary bi@@ ologist thought long that Greenland @-@ shar@@ ks become stone @-@ old .
only lack@@ ed the evidence .
Greenland &apos;s shar@@ ks are difficult to observe , after all , they live mainly in the polar sea in front of the spar@@ sely populated co@@ asts of Canada , Greenland , Norway and S@@ val@@ bard .
because they prefer water temperatures around the six degrees Celsius , they usually appear on the surface only in winter .
researchers know correspon@@ dingly little about the lifestyle of Greenland &apos;s shar@@ ks .
their pent@@ pent@@ ine is as they equi@@ p six animals with a transmitter prior to S@@ val@@ bard .
prey make this shar@@ k nevertheless : in the stomach of an animal , researchers found the remains of a seal , another had swal@@ lowed the j@@ aw@@ bone of a young polar bear .
possibly they hunt sleeping animals or pat@@ rol on the ground of the ic@@ e@@ sea and look for car@@ c@@ ass looking from higher water layers down@@ wards .
Julius Niel@@ sen and his colleagues now examined 28 Greenland &apos;s shar@@ ks who held fishermen from Greenland or S@@ val@@ bard as a by@@ catch from the depth of the North Atlantic Ocean between 2010 and 2013 .
the smallest shar@@ k was just 81 cm long , while the greatest 502 centi@@ meter was measured .
to determine the age of the animals , they analysed the liner core of the shar@@ ks with the carbon @-@ 14 method .
this centre of the eye lens arises already before the birth of the shar@@ ks , the proteins in it are later no longer renewed .
the two smallest shar@@ ks had notably a lot of carbon @-@ 14 in the l@@ enti@@ cular nucle@@ us .
their birth should therefore lie in the atmosphere after the early 1960s , when atomic weapons try to drag greater amounts of this radio@@ active carbon into the atmosphere .
in the third @-@ smallest animal with 220 centi@@ meters of length , the l@@ enti@@ cular nucle@@ us , on the other hand , contained a small excess of carbon @-@ 14 from the atomic weapons , it is likely to have celebrated its 50@@ th birthday during its investigation in 2012 .
in their l@@ enti@@ cular nucle@@ us all larger Greenland @-@ shar@@ ks , on the other hand , had normal carbon @-@ 14 amounts , which result from cosmic rays in the atmosphere .
in fact , the carbon @-@ 14 watch for a 493 centi@@ meter long Greenland @-@ shar@@ k showed an age of 335 years , while the record shar@@ k could be 392 years old with 502 centi@@ meters .
that Gr@@ ön@@ land @-@ shar@@ k females only get offspring when they are longer than four meters , was known .
now the researchers were able to assign an age to the length .
since one of the animals with 392 centi@@ meters probably stood at the threshold to the sex@@ ually mature and its age was determined with 156 years , Greenland &apos;s shar@@ ks with the multip@@ lication obviously allow at least one and a half centuries of time .
this is also likely to be a world record for verteb@@ rates .
that such meth@@ us@@ al@@ eme live above all in icy waters , is no coinci@@ dence .
also the previous record holder , a 211 @-@ year old Gr@@ ön@@ land @-@ wh@@ ale , in whose bac@@ on at the neck a 120 @-@ year @-@ old har@@ poon point stuck , was caught in front of Alaska .
due to the low temperatures , the organism of the animals living there often runs on as@@ parag@@ us .
so they mature later - and age s@@ lower .
in order to keep warm in cold water , the animals are also often particularly large .
because the volume grows much faster than its surface by which the animal loses heat .
the heat loss of one gram of mouse is therefore much greater than with one gram of eleph@@ ant .
another advantage : they have fewer enemies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a smaller animal lives therefore more dangerous and should concentrate on having as many offspring as possible as possible , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains the evolution@@ ary bi@@ ologist Sch@@ euer@@ lein . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a very big animal should , on the other hand , invest his resources in a long life .
building plot in double pack
with topics related to construction , the municipal council has dealt with a focus on the recent session .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with relief , the Board adopted the communication by mayor Robert P@@ utz that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; finally the marketing of the recently @-@ proven residential areas can begin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; after the plots , par@@ cel@@ lier@@ - and settlement issues were clar@@ ified and the applications could be placed on surv@@ ey@@ ing , the sale of the plots in the residential areas &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Straß@@ l@@ weg &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Schön@@ au @-@ West &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( section 1 ) to interested parties is nothing more in the way . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the municipal council is convinced that the bro@@ o@@ ks in the rural and quiet residential community Schön@@ au young families and equi@@ distant elderly are equally appealing .
as it was said , Bau@@ wil@@ lig can immediately report in the town hall , on the allocation of the plots , the municipal council is expected to be advised in its September session .
in order to also make inquiries for the settlement of further industrial enterprises , linked to the creation of jobs , the municipal council decided to change the space plan area newly created in the spring of this year .
thus in the area of Unter@@ zeit@@ gen@@ n the commercial area was extended by two plots in the direction of state road 21@@ 12 .
Frankfurt benefits from Bre@@ x@@ it
in the competition with Paris , Dublin and Luxembourg , the city on the Main has the best chances of attrac@@ ting jobs and companies from London .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is highly likely that Frankfurt enjoys the most from the Bre@@ x@@ it V@@ ot@@ um , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Michael Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder , head of the I@@ W &apos;s financial markets and real estate markets . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the Bre@@ x@@ it referendum , it is un@@ certain whether money houses from London may continue to operate from financial transactions across the EU . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; EU passport &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; they have been granted approval in the UK so far . &quot; &quot; &quot;
these are currently using major US banks .
several banks have already announced to shift jobs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Frankfurt Main Finance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; lob@@ b@@ ying association counts with 10000 new jobs on the Main within five years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for Frankfurt , such as the I@@ W , the seat of the European Central Bank ( EC@@ B ) , which un@@ ites responsibility for monetary policy and supervision over the largest banks in the Eurozone , as well as other important authorities like the European insurance supervision EI@@ OP@@ A and the risk of ES@@ R@@ B .
while in Paris , the Organisation for Economic Co @-@ operation and Development ( OECD ) has its headquarters , but this is less significant for the financial sector than the EC@@ B .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the proximity to the central bank is important for banks as they can communicate directly with the supervision , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says I@@ W @-@ Professor Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Luxembourg , though , insi@@ sts a large fund business , but also cuts in the infrastructure like Dublin .
Frankfurt is much easier to reach thanks to the large airport .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the city with easily available commercial properties . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Paris it &apos;s not so easy to find free high @-@ quality offices , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the Seine , the rent for first @-@ class commercial real estate is 50 percent higher than the main . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , Frankfurt offers a higher quality of life than competition thanks to good medical care and infrastructure , as well as less crime .
in a ranking of the company coun@@ sel@@ ing Mer@@ cer , the city ranks seventh , Luxembourg on No. 19 , Dublin on No. 33 and Paris at 37@@ th place .
&quot; &quot; &quot; even if quality of life is a question of preference : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with its already strong position as a financial centre for the European internal market , Frankfurt could attract more banks and investors , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says I@@ W . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but in spite of Bre@@ x@@ it V@@ ot@@ um , London will remain the most important financial center in Europe , my business researchers .
in London , according to figures from the Landes@@ bank Hel@@ aba end of 2015 around 14@@ 4000 people worked in the banking industry , in Frankfurt there were 6@@ 2500 .
Gilead gets legal costs from the h@@ epatitis C patent dispute with Mer@@ ck
a US @-@ based judge ruled that Gilead Sciences Inc . claim to reim@@ bur@@ sement of the legal costs that you have emerged from the h@@ epat@@ its C legal dispute with the pharmaceutical company Mer@@ ck &amp; Co Inc .
in June , Gilead was liber@@ ated by a compensation payment of $ 200 million for the violation of two patents of Mer@@ ck , which were in connection with the block@@ bu@@ ster medications S@@ ov@@ al@@ di and Har@@ von@@ i of Gilead after a US judge un@@ covered a pattern of mis@@ conduct on the part of Mer@@ ck , including Mein@@ ei@@ des and other un@@ ethical actions .
at the request of the law@@ suit on Thursday , U.S. office judge Beth Lab@@ son Fre@@ eman said that Gilead is entitled to decree of the cost incurred during the defense of the case .
Mer@@ ck tries to compens@@ ate with Gilead that domin@@ ates the market of a new generation of h@@ epatitis C drugs that can cure over 90 percent of patients with liver disease .
the case goes back to 2013 when Gilead and Mer@@ ck compl@@ ained about each other and entitled to work on Labor@@ atories to which Sof@@ os@@ bu@@ vir became ground , the active ingredient in the drugs of Gilead .
troops supported by the US say that they reg@@ ained full control over Man@@ bi@@ j from the Islamic State
from the US , troops supported the complete control of the northern city of Man@@ bi@@ j near the Turkish border after the last IS fighters in the city left them , said a spokes@@ man of the group on Friday .
the Democratic forces of Syria ( D@@ KS ) com@@ prise the passage of the remaining group of fighters who have du@@ g within the city , currently the city .
they have fre@@ ed over 2,000 civilians who were held by the fighters as host@@ ages , Shar@@ on Dar@@ wish shared the Man@@ bi@@ j military council Reu@@ ters with the D@@ KS .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the city is now under complete control , but we are carrying out clean @-@ up operations , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he told Reu@@ ters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
clinics earn 10.@@ 75 million in 2015 and pay 34.@@ 2 % federal taxes
H@@ illary Clinton has published its tax return on Friday in 2015 , which sur@@ rendered to the Democrats and her husband a revenue of USD 10.@@ 75 million and an effective Federal tax rate of 34.@@ 2 % .
in 2015 , the Clinton Foundation donated USD 1 million for char@@ itable purposes , mainly to the Clinton Foundation ; former President Bill Clinton generated an income of USD 3 million from the publishing house Simon &amp; Sch@@ uster for her book on her term of office at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs .
Clinton &apos;s candidate for the vice @-@ presi@@ dency , Sen@@ ator Tim KA@@ INE from Virginia , published his tax declar@@ ations of the last ten years together with his wife Anne Hol@@ ton .
they paid an effective Federal tax rate of 20.@@ 3 % in 2015 .
&quot; H@@ illary Clinton and Tim KA@@ INE continue to set standards in terms of financial transparency , &quot; gave Clin@@ tons campaign hel@@ per Jen@@ ni@@ fer Pal@@ mier@@ i in a statement .
in a stark contrast to this , Donald Tr@@ ump is hiding behind false exc@@ uses and withdrawal in relation to his previous promises his tax declar@@ ations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is common for US presidential candidates to publish their tax declar@@ ations , although they are not oblig@@ ated by law because of it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tr@@ ump , a New York business@@ man , and his lawyers , as a reason for his ref@@ usal , stated a tax check by the tax authorities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are on the train , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote Clin@@ tons elec@@ toral hel@@ per Ian Sam@@ s on Twitter , referring to the publication of the presidential candidates of the Democrats . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Thursday , Michael Coh@@ en , Tr@@ umps Sonder@@ consultant , said to CN@@ N that he would not allow Tr@@ ump to publish something before the control inspec@@ tions are not completed .
l@@ umps critics , among other things also the Republi@@ can presidential candidate of 2012 Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney , have already abandoned that his ref@@ usal to raise questions regarding assets , donations for char@@ itable organizations , his business and various other ties , especially with Russia .
Clinton has already over@@ thrown the issue and published a video on the internet on Friday in the high @-@ ranking Republi@@ can Tr@@ ump ordered his tax return .
on Thursday she spoke about the topic also during a speech on the economy in Michigan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he ref@@ uses to do what each other candidate has done in recent decades and publish his tax declar@@ ations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said to the crowd . &quot; &quot; &quot;
POL@@ IT@@ IC@@ O reported that Tr@@ ump paid no or only very little tax during the 1990s , and a business journalist in the New York Times quoted a number of tax lawyers and tax advis@@ ors on Friday that this could still be the case .
Federal taxes have become a subject in the election campaign .
Clinton supports a regulation named after the bil@@ li@@ on@@ aire and investor War@@ ren Buff@@ ett that would ensure that individuals paying more than USD 1 million deserve a tax rate of at least 30 % .
President Obama also supports the proposal .
during an election campaign for H@@ illary Clinton in the past week in Om@@ aha , Neb@@ ras@@ ka called for Buff@@ ett , whose Ber@@ k@@ shire H@@ ath@@ away industrial con@@ glomer@@ ate has its headquarters here , Tr@@ ump to exchange their tax declar@@ ations .
Buff@@ ett said he was also subjected to a control examination of IR@@ S and Tr@@ ump did &quot; fear &quot; from the vot@@ ers and not before tax authorities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Clin@@ tons &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; campaign has issued tax declar@@ ations back to 2007 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Clin@@ tons , which are now living in Ch@@ app@@ aqu@@ a , New York , paid an effective Federal tax rate of approx . 32 % between 2007 and 2014 and an effective combined tax rate of approx . 4@@ 0.5 % .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 2015 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tax return &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of 2015 showed that these are only USD 100 of their income as wages , unlike most Americans . &quot; &quot; &quot;
their main investment position was a cost @-@ effective index fund , from which the Clinton &apos;s divi@@ den@@ ds and earnings were tax@@ ed from USD 10@@ 9,@@ 000 .

con@@ doms with Chi@@ li@@ pu@@ der , fire@@ works promote Tanz@@ anian Ele@@ ph@@ ant Protection
conserv@@ ation@@ ists in Tanzania use an un@@ orthodo@@ x way to prevent eleph@@ ants from going to inhabited settlements - they throw con@@ doms on them filled with chili powder .
the method has proven to be effective and the Honey@@ guide Foundation , who already had the idea for years , intensi@@ fied its promotion together with U.S. natural protection by trained in villages in the north of Tanzania , using a non @-@ violent four @-@ stage method to protect their homes and harvest without hur@@ ting animals .
before , many sp@@ ears have used to defend themselves .
Friday is a day @-@ cell day dedicated to animal protection .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since we have developed the ... Tool@@ kit , we were able to observe a change in their attitude within these communities , whereby they are much more confident that they can keep the eleph@@ ants from their fields without dam@@ aging the eleph@@ ant , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; commented the CEO of Honey@@ guide Dami@@ an Bell in a message . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the first two steps include the lighting of the eleph@@ ant with a tor@@ ch and the bub@@ bles in a horn .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if it is not deter@@ red , a so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; chi@@ lies &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is thrown . &quot; &quot; &quot;
chi@@ li@@ pu@@ der mixed with earth is packed together with a fire@@ work body into a con@@ dom , whose end is fil@@ med up to the ignition cord .
when it is lit , the con@@ dom bur@@ sts with a b@@ ang and spra@@ ys fine dust on chili powder into the air .
a touch is usually already out to ch@@ ase the eleph@@ ant .
a last possibility is a sur@@ fer that sho@@ ots a golf fire@@ works into the air and causes a loud , bright explosion .

however , in the immediate vicinity of the Rhine @-@ bal@@ lo@@ ons on the Rhine , the City Council declined with the application for the new construction of a sale ski in the Rhine near the Rhine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fundamentally we welcome new business@@ men , but at this location in exposed location on the Rhine river , this ki@@ osk does not go down , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Michael Hu@@ br@@ ath for the C@@ DU group . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jewish director cuts Berlin hotel because Israeli pre@@ fix was removed after &quot; Arab &quot; demand - RT News
a French director with Jewish roots unle@@ ashed a media rebel@@ lion after reve@@ aling that the Kemp@@ inski B@@ rist@@ ol Hotel in Berlin did not list Israeli pre @-@ election as there were Arab guests requested by a staff . &quot;
Claude Lanz@@ mann , author of the Holocaust documentary &quot; Sho@@ a &quot; issued his anger at the Kemp@@ inski B@@ rist@@ ol Hotel in Berlin , writing an open letter to the German newspaper FA@@ Z .
during his last stay , Lanz@@ mann tried to find Israel on the hotel &apos;s list of countries .
the country was not listed among the countries that can be inv@@ oked directly from the hotel room .
how is it possible in 2016 in Berlin , the capital of the new Germany , possible that Israel was eliminated and deleted ?
wrote Lanz@@ mann .
instead , the Kemp@@ ink@@ si B@@ rist@@ ol offers a possibility to choose Israel through its own call center .
after an explanation , the director turned to the hotel reception .
the answer he received there , &quot; sho@@ cked him , &quot; as Lanz@@ mann wrote .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the hotel staff said that the measure was a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; deliber@@ ate decision of the management of the Kemp@@ inski Hotel &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the reason behind it was even more fur@@ ious in the director .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most of our guests are Arab@@ s and they have asked that the pre @-@ election is er@@ ased , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the employee was c@@ ited by Lanz@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Israeli ambassador in Germany Y@@ ak@@ ov H@@ adas @-@ Handels@@ man called this a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; great shame &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; writes the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we were horri@@ fied and troubled by this event .
this really is very sh@@ ame@@ ful .
the fact that this has happened in Germany in exactly this hotel chain is even greater shame .
this does not require any explanation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we expect the hotel to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; draw the right conclusions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the minister . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the incident triggered a rather large response on the internet where people called the whole a sc@@ andal .
some under@@ took the Kemp@@ inski Hotel that it would have given the alleged appeal of Arab guests . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shame you , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said it in another article in which it was pointed out that the hotel , which is located on the noble Kur@@ für@@ st@@ end@@ amm , near a synagogue . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the hotel quickly pointed out all accus@@ ations and called the incident &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; seeing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ap@@ ologi@@ zed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at Lanz@@ mann reports The Mir@@ ror . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was never a direct statement , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not to enter Israel into the fast indi@@ sc@@ rimin@@ als , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung quoted a spokes@@ man of the Kemp@@ inski Hotel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it adds that the country code is now added .
police put Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as &amp; Gum@@ mig@@ esch@@ enko to protest against protest@@ ant Brazilian students
students met in Sao Paulo Brazilian city on Thursday when they gathered to protest against the government &apos;s reforms for the public education system .
the police used tear gas and rubber bul@@ bs against the demonstr@@ ators .
the difficulties began when police officers tried to disper@@ se the students , leading to the fact that the police put rubber sho@@ ots and tear gas .
several hundred students participated in the demonstrations in order to express their const@@ ern@@ ation on the plans .
according to the Gover@@ nor of the Federal State of Sao Paulo Ger@@ aldo Al@@ ck@@ min , a little less than 100 public schools are closed , while 300@@ ,000 students are implemented to save money .
some of the protest@@ ants were seen gra@@ ff@@ ites against the pro@@ visional President Michel Tem@@ er on walls .
the most recent protests occurred a few days after demonstr@@ ators went to the streets to support the suspended presi@@ dency of Dil@@ ma Rous@@ se@@ ff , who had been ab@@ sent from the office by a vote of the Senate .
trade between Russia &amp; Iran suddenly rises to 71 % - RT Business
with the lifting of sanctions , according to the Russian ambassador in Iran , Lev@@ an D@@ zh@@ ag@@ ar@@ yan , the exchange rate between Moscow and Te@@ hr@@ an increased by 7@@ 0.9 per cent in the year .
since the international sanctions against Iran have been lifted up , the interest of Russian companies in the country grew strongly in the country , divided the amb@@ ass@@ ad@@ ors .
Russian enterprises anticip@@ ate existing connections with Iran while new companies are ready to access the market .
&quot; &quot; &quot; of course , further trade expansion is one of the largest priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said D@@ zh@@ ag@@ ar@@ yan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it noted that the trade turnover between Russia and Iran in the first five months of the 2016 year rose by 7@@ 0.9 percent compared to the same period in 2015 and $ 8@@ 56 million .
in particular , Russian imports increased by 9@@ 1.5 percent in Iran and amounted to $ 697 million .
Russian imports from Iran rose by 16 percent to $ 158 million .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the trade reb@@ ate was reached by deliveries of machinery , agricultural vehicles and weapons , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the ambassador . &quot; &quot; &quot;
D@@ zh@@ ag@@ ar@@ yan is a record number of Iranian tourists in Russia this year .
last year , the Russian foreign representation was around 35,@@ 000 vis@@ as , primarily travel agencies , Iranian citizens .
in addition , Iran reached the top 20 of the countries concerned by the number of tourists in Russia .
one could say that the record numbers of Iranian tourists in Russia last year , &quot; he said .
at the same time , only relatively few Russi@@ ans visit Iran , something that the ambassador hoped that it will change .
&quot; I personally recommend visiting the towns of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Sh@@ ir@@ az and Y@@ az@@ d , who have received the monuments of the old Persi@@ an civilization in a good condition , &quot; he said .
witnesses searched : beverages market in Wald@@ br@@ öl in@@ fest@@ ed
a rob@@ ber@@ y fall has been pract@@ ised on Thursday evening on the drink market of Re@@ we XXL at the Wald@@ br@@ ö@@ ler Ger@@ ber@@ straße .
under the au@@ spices of a gun @-@ mon@@ key , three dar@@ k@@ ly dressed people , who had surrounded their faces , from the staff of the beverage industry , forced the release of cash and then fled at first on foot and then presum@@ ably with a silver @-@ coloured VW Golf .
how much money was captured , the police did not share with them .
the offen@@ ders should have been between 1,60 and 1.70 metres , so relatively small .
the beverage market is directly accessible and po@@ or@@ ly visible from the parking deck of the Re@@ we market .
after the over@@ fall , the perpet@@ rators must be sc@@ r@@ apped in the direction of Ger@@ ber@@ straße , Friedrich @-@ Engel@@ bert @-@ Weg and be fle@@ eing from the gravel parking space situated opposite the car park entrance , possibly towards B 256 ( Schla@@ der@@ n@@ ring ) .
those who have made observ@@ ations in connection with the rob@@ ber@@ y of the crime must notify the police urg@@ ently .
Nag@@ old : fun and fun during summer holidays
eight beautiful and happy days spent the children and young people of the socio @-@ educational day group / social group work of the Nag@@ old child protection association with their care@@ gi@@ vers on their summer @-@ free time in Nuss@@ dorf , near Mühl@@ acker .
in the quiet open @-@ line theim @-@ Hard@@ tw@@ äl@@ dle the life @-@ joy@@ ful group was lod@@ ged during the first school holiday week .
several full day trips were on the agenda .
on the one hand it went to boards with a visit to the pet@@ ting zoo .
on the other to Maul@@ bron@@ n where there was a special children &apos;s tour in the world @-@ famous monastery .
the third trip took us to P@@ for@@ z@@ heim .
at the Kel@@ ten@@ museum in Hoch@@ dorf , the group learned a lot about everyday life and the food of the Cel@@ ts .
on the hot days , the group enjoyed themselves in the Tiefen@@ lake in Maul@@ bron@@ n , which invited to jump , swimming and pl@@ ung@@ ing .
culinary have been spo@@ ilt for children and care@@ gi@@ vers with their own prepared body@@ courses like the Sau@@ ren Sp@@ ätz@@ le , the Seeb@@ ron@@ ner Pf@@ än@@ n@@ le , I@@ sel@@ sh@@ aus@@ er @-@ Blo@@ ff , the English @-@ Breakfast and T@@ üb@@ inger Bolog@@ n@@ ese .
in workshops were made , beautiful jewels created from pearls and stones or made of wood a Roman mill game .
further highlights of the leisure time were fishing in a nearby pond , the evenings at the fire and the final &quot; Bun@@ te Night . &quot;
the sun and the children and young people returned home on the day of the voy@@ age home .
Ha@@ iger@@ loch : pilgrims to the Gateway of Mer@@ cy
the ministers from the coun@@ sel@@ ing unit of the Ey@@ acht@@ al @-@ Ha@@ iger@@ loch &quot; St. Anna were on the way on a four @-@ day pilgrimage from Vill@@ ingen to Freiburg .
together , four stages were accomplished .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to bridge the time up to the next Roman pilgrimage of all ministers in two years , the top minist@@ erial round of St. Anna has decided to prepare and implement a multi @-@ day pilgrimage . &quot; &quot; &quot;
different pilgrimage destinations have been examined and one decided finally for the bishop &apos;s city of Freiburg , where in this year on the occasion of the Holy Year of Mer@@ cy with the open gate of mercy on the Frei@@ burger Mu@@ en@@ ster , a special pilgrimage destination was offered .
16 Min@@ is from B@@ itt@@ el@@ bron@@ n , Gru@@ ol , Ha@@ iger@@ loch , and Heiligen@@ zimmern were on their way .
in the evening before , Pastor Stor@@ ost sent pilgrims in a small celebration in St. Anna , blessed the Pil@@ gri@@ mage and divided the Pil@@ gri@@ ms .
from Hor@@ b we drove by train to the starting point Vill@@ ingen , where also a Mu@@ en@@ ster of Our Lady stands and so the pilgrimage started from Münster .
the individual day tours were framed in the morning and evening depending on a short impulse with different prayers , songs and texts .
but also on the way , the Min@@ is also made ha@@ ste to sing together a song from a specially @-@ assembled pilgri@@ m song .
for the nights there were parish homes of the local parish .
at the stage destinations Alexandra Burk@@ hardt and Hei@@ di F@@ aller spent a tasty and delicious dinner and breakfast .
on the second day we went on fur@@ tw@@ angen to Gü@@ ten@@ bach .
on top of that , one entered the stage after St. Peter , which was the most exhau@@ sting route , but at first some 500 altitude metres had to be desc@@ ended at low temperatures and then climb@@ ed again afterwards .
the deser@@ ved reward was a common gr@@ illing at the evening in the evening .
after the morning pulse on the fourth pilgrimage day in the impressive monastery church of St. Peter it went to the final stage to Freiburg .
he was visi@@ bly reli@@ eved and happy the Min@@ is met at the Frei@@ burger Mu@@ en@@ ster in the late afternoon and walked through the portals of mercy .
with a little impulse God was given thanks here .
in the evening mass in Münster , Min@@ is commented on the pilgrimage destination of co@@ operator Markus O@@ bert .
after the divine service , the pilgrims were able to visit the sac@@ rist@@ y and the high altar .
the next day was still time for the Bre@@ is@@ gau metro@@ polis .
in the afternoon we went by train to Hor@@ b .
at the end , all participants agreed that the days of spiritu@@ ality and a strong community experience were shaped .
Sch@@ otte Call@@ um Sk@@ inner stor@@ ms home when Br@@ ite Gold won for cycling
Scotland &apos;s Call@@ um Sk@@ inner ra@@ ste last night in the men &apos;s team Sprint at the Vel@@ od@@ rom in Rio for fame when the British team def@@ ended the title of London 2012 .
the 23 @-@ year @-@ old from Glas@@ go@@ w took the anchor , which his comp@@ atri@@ ot Sir Chris Ho@@ y had made himself to E@@ igen . the J@@ ung pro@@ u@@ dly made the legend as he stor@@ med at home to inv@@ ade a victory from the favourites of New Zealand .
England claimed a sho@@ cking victory four years ago , while Ho@@ y won the fifth of six Olympic med@@ als .
they repeated the trick after taking the train world champion@@ ships in London in March despite the withdrawal of Ho@@ ys only a modest sixth place .
the problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of Jamie Staff .
they did this in time as a Hin@@ du .
Ho@@ ys retirement showed a gap that K@@ ian Em@@ adi and Matt Cr@@ amp@@ ton attempted to close .
Sk@@ inner was the man with whom they stayed when they saw potential in the sh@@ all@@ ots that un@@ folded .
Hin@@ des , Kenn@@ y - four years ago with Ho@@ y won - and Sk@@ inner placed an Olympic record in the qualifying rounds , but in the standard laps the New Ze@@ al@@ anders won in the first round .
and the British trio won the du@@ el with gold .
Hin@@ du was just behind after his lap , but Kenn@@ y got the team forward and Sk@@ inner held it .
a change of strategy made a large part of the transformation in which Hin@@ du went in a higher gear to slow it down and allow Kenn@@ y and above all Sk@@ inner to keep pace .
Ho@@ y saw from his position as BBC expert and fell on Sk@@ inner , Kenn@@ y and Hin@@ du , when they climb@@ ed on the podium .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 23 @-@ year @-@ old Sk@@ inner from Glas@@ go@@ w said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a fl@@ atter@@ ing comparison . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I am only here to do my best and to make a name for me .
in the final round we set up an Olympic board and the World Champion inv@@ ests .
it was just unbelie@@ vable .
there is no better way to win this .
after the triumph of 2012 at the page Kenn@@ ys and Ho@@ ys , Hin@@ des admitted that after a weak start , he deliberately fell to the rail@@ road .
he returned this statement later and there was no obj@@ ection to England &apos;s ri@@ vals .
with such an outstanding victory this time there was no such problem .
&quot; &quot; &quot; said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it feels like all the GB flags on the grand@@ stand like London . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we have come together as a team over the last three months .
we went so badly with so many world titles that it was unbelie@@ vable to win again at the Olympics .
this is an event , a gold med@@ al for the nation , the seven of ten titles were won both in Beijing and in London .
if this is a bar@@ ometer of our progress over the last five months , we expect successful five days in the Vel@@ od@@ rom .
with the form of Kenn@@ ys it is in the realm of possibility that he repeated Ho@@ ys &apos;s victory of three ol@@ ymp@@ ic gold med@@ als in a competition .
that would mean for Kenn@@ y - who was born exactly 12 years younger than Ho@@ y , who was born on March 23 ( a seemingly holy date for British sports ; on the day also Steve Red@@ grave , Mon Far@@ ah and Roger Ban@@ ni@@ ster were born ) - a yield of six gold med@@ als and a silver med@@ al .
this is equal to that of Ho@@ y .
Kenn@@ y takes part in the spr@@ int that starts today and will go for three days .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 28 @-@ year @-@ old Bol@@ ton said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I only enjoy this for the moment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the team event is always the best .
you can win it with his colleagues .
it feels something lon@@ ely to win alone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If he wins two more gold med@@ als , he should be beaten to the k@@ night . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was the only med@@ al competition of the day , but there were other good news for England .
Sir Brad@@ ly W@@ ig@@ gins , Ed C@@ lan@@ cy , Steven Bur@@ ke and Ow@@ ain Dou@@ ll qualified with the fastest performance in four @-@ four @-@ kilomet@@ re race .
they arrived at the destination in 3 : 5@@ 1,@@ 942 .
the world record , which won gold in 2012 in London , was 3 : 5@@ 1,6@@ 59 .
the first and final round ( 22.@@ 42 ) will take place on the second day of the competition , where W@@ ig@@ gins will focus on safety .
he had fought with officials before the qualification yesterday , when function@@ aries cried to him to measure his height .
in the corresponding women &apos;s competition , which will be continued and finished tomorrow , Jo@@ anna Row@@ sell Sh@@ and , E@@ lin@@ or Bar@@ ker and K@@ atie Archi@@ bald of Mil@@ n@@ g@@ avi@@ e in world record time in 4 : 13,@@ 260 .
the GB team relies on its strong track team to domin@@ ate the central period of the Olympic Games and to pick up a pair of med@@ als .
after a truly extraordinary representation of absolute domin@@ ance in Beijing and London the expectations for Rio were shut down .
there played Dr@@ amas in the background , so the re@@ sign@@ ation of the technical director Sh@@ ane S@@ ut@@ ton in April among Sex@@ ism and M@@ ob@@ b@@ ing@@ es as well as retirement of sizes such as Ho@@ y and Victoria P@@ end@@ let@@ on .
however , if one looks at the first evening of the competition in the Vel@@ od@@ rom , it looks like the legendary reputation of G@@ Bs , which has reached its peak at the perfect moment , will be repeated again .
future of the sm@@ el@@ ting of Port@@ land due to the abol@@ ition of energy demand
the future of the aluminium mel@@ ting of Port@@ land in Victoria - as well as hundreds of work@@ places of workers - are at stake , as the plant operator termin@@ ates the supply of energy and thus lifts all supply contracts , such as the supplying energy company .
this step was followed by the decision of the government in Victoria at the start of this year , no further subsidies to operate the plant .
a subsi@@ dy for 20 years exp@@ ires in November .
up to 2000 jobs in the Al@@ coa site in Port@@ land are at stake .
not less than 2,000 work@@ places - direct and indirect - could be at risk of closing .
in addition , it could result in dom@@ ino effects since the mel@@ ting process consum@@ es around 10 percent of the total electricity generation of Vict@@ ori@@ as .
in 2014 Al@@ coa joined the Point Henry Schmel@@ zer@@ ei , which led last year to a closure of the Angl@@ es@@ ea power station .
the mel@@ ting of Al@@ coa in Port@@ land lo@@ oses money and cr@@ acks a closure .
this step follows the years of spec@@ ulation regarding the future of the plant , originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar and last@@ ly due to the electricity price for the plant .
AG@@ L , which supplies the large aluminium mel@@ ting with its Lo@@ y Yang A power plant in Lat@@ ro@@ be Valley , announced that three more owners will announce their contracts .
the plant is owned by a joint venture of Al@@ coa and Al@@ um@@ ina , of which the Chinese company C@@ IT@@ IC and the Japanese Mar@@ ub@@ eni Cor@@ p hold smaller shares .
&quot; AG@@ L assumes that the plant will continue to operate in Port@@ land , which means another physical demand for electricity by the mel@@ ting process , &quot; the company shared .
AG@@ L continues to say that the tre@@ aties are so @-@ called &quot; hed@@ ging transactions , &quot; which should be in force from November 2016 .
the contracts have a 12 @-@ month notice period so that they will end 2017 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore AG@@ L expects that the contracts will contribute to the revenue in the financial year 17 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the electricity supplier . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all potential impacts on the revenues on AG@@ L from the G@@ J 18 are currently limited by forecasts of strong financial markets for wholesale electricity prices .
AG@@ L announced that the value of the contracts has already been written in its annual report of $ 187 million in &quot; anticip@@ ation of dism@@ iss@@ al . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Al@@ coa said that the decision to withdraw the contracts , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ab@@ ility Al@@ co@@ as ... to operate the mel@@ ting process &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or to ensure the power supply to the mel@@ ting process &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the U.S. company said that in 2010 it concluded a 20 @-@ year contract with Lo@@ y Yang , who would have entered into force from November this year even if it is still a declaration of why it with@@ drew from the contract .
analy@@ st war@@ n due to the poor economic conditions of the industry in front of the possible closure of the Port@@ land mel@@ ting factory in Victoria and the Tom@@ ago plant near New@@ castle .
referring to analysts at the beginning of the week , Head of Operations Stephen Mik@@ kel@@ sen said that around 600 meg@@ a@@ watts and Tom@@ ago consume around 900 meg@@ a@@ watts of electricity per year .
should both plants disappear from the market , it would mean a considerable reduction in demand in the &#91; electricity market &#93; .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and for us as a generator , that would not be good , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
more than just a Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an Reality TV star , Kendall is on the cover of the September issue of Vo@@ gue
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Christian denom@@ in@@ ator &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; 20 , model and fourth daughter of the manager and mother of the Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an @-@ J@@ enner C@@ lan@@ s Kr@@ is is on the cover of the sought @-@ after Sept@@ ember@@ edition of the US Vo@@ gue . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the brand ambassador of E@@ ste@@ e Lau@@ der and ran to Fashion We@@ eks in Milan , Paris and New York , on Thursday announced the news on their Inst@@ ag@@ ram account .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a room full of people I love brought me the sight of this cover to cry , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote Kendall . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the cover of the cover followed a bizar@@ re ( or simply Ke@@ eping Up with the Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ ans similar ? ) , unle@@ aded reality video , which shows the entire Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an @-@ J@@ enner family ( except for the problem cases Rob and Ca@@ it@@ ly@@ n ) as well as in the presence of the univers@@ ally most popular show@@ biz un@@ cle and producers of Ke@@ eping Up Ryan Se@@ ac@@ rest .
this represents the c@@ lich@@ é plot almost every birthday episode of a children &apos;s program ( Se@@ ac@@ rest brought the sentence , &quot; You thought that we had forgotten you ? &quot; , with the hon@@ esty of a carto@@ on on a Sen@@ de@@ platz at 8 o &apos;clock in the morning ) , but Kr@@ is had to take part in this public@@ ity somehow .
with regard to the September issue of Vo@@ gue , a new era of car@@ das@@ hi@@ an began with certainty .
Kend@@ all &apos;s big sister Kim may have sm@@ itten the Vo@@ gue cover ( they and her husband K@@ any@@ e West were to be seen in April 2014 ) , but the cover of September issue of the magazine is a le@@ ague for itself .
the September edition is the most sold out edition of the year for Vo@@ gue .
with a circum@@ ference similar to a visual tape than a fashion magazine , the output attracts a large number of advertis@@ ers ( Accor@@ ding Fas@@ hi@@ on@@ ista were from the 832 pages of the rolling mill 615 pages advertising ) .
the disclosure of his cover stars is expected to be ad@@ dic@@ ted in the last two years before the official announcement .
women who were already on the cover include Na@@ omi Camp@@ bell , Linda Evangel@@ ista and K@@ ate Mos@@ s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in recent years there were clearly more &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; celebr@@ ities &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; who like &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; models that are celebr@@ ities &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the cover . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Oscar prize winner and director Jen@@ ni@@ fer Lawrence was in 2013 on the cover , a year after Lady G@@ aga had the honor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but even with the small chance that woman J@@ enner - who is described by the magazine as the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; breakthrough model &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of her generation - falls under the former category , is in good company . &quot; &quot; &quot;
these celebr@@ ities are not related to famous people or reality stars or teen@@ agers of today who know how to turn a good Snap@@ chat video ( even though it &apos;s all true to those of men ) .
they are really talented women who stand out in the entertainment industry .
Be@@ y@@ once , who appeared on the last cover , had with the publication of Lem@@ on@@ ade one of the most successful years of her career .
of course J@@ enn@@ ers &apos;s success does not like everyone .
with their reality TV history , J@@ enn@@ ers &apos;s position in the world of fashion was always somewhat ten@@ se .
in June , the former Victoria &apos;s Secret Model was crit@@ ici@@ zed by Steph@@ anie Sey@@ m@@ our J@@ enner and her colleague Gig@@ i H@@ adi@@ d and called her &quot; the Mist@@ resses of the Eye . &quot;
these feelings were bo@@ iling up again when the message came out with the appearance of J@@ enn@@ ers on the Vo@@ gue Cover .
but riding on the Mis@@ sm@@ ut seems to pass by at the point .
the Bandera J@@ enner is on the cover of the September issue of Vo@@ gue .
it is a super@@ model in the tru@@ est sense of the word .
she runs for Marc Jac@@ obs .
she makes advertising for your pri@@ mer of E@@ ste@@ e Lau@@ der .
you and all her sisters will sell pictures of them on their respective pay@@ wall apps .
she sells her pictures from Cin@@ dy C@@ RA@@ W@@ FOR@@ DS daughter to the journal &quot; LOVE . &quot;
and in her spare time she is to be seen in reality TV . probably only to see her sister K@@ our@@ t@@ ney and her children .
municipal reporting centres annually show 16@@ 0,000 people annually
more than 16@@ 0,000 of the country &apos;s relief efforts are rejected annually by the municipal coun@@ c@@ ill@@ aries , while the industry insi@@ sts on the effects of further medium @-@ cuts to already over@@ loaded transactions .
in Que@@ ens@@ land , three out of five persons - mostly older persons , immigrants , ne@@ edy workers , victims of violence and those who have no funds for un@@ fair del@@ o@@ gi@@ v@@ ations and similar - are rejected at their request for free legal advice and legal assistance .
legal services of the municipality , which are already covered in excess , are prepared for further cuts .
from June next year , it is expected that these legal centres will lose another 30 percent of their federal funds .
the director of Que@@ es@@ land James Far@@ rell said that the last survey of the National Association of Municipal Auth@@ orities revealed that thousands of people will be rejected every year .
Far@@ rell said that the situation would only be worse without repe@@ aling the decision of the Federal Government .
&quot; Que@@ ens@@ land &apos;s municipal coun@@ c@@ ill@@ aries are chron@@ ically under@@ financed , meaning that thousands of people of important services that you need will be rejected , &quot; he said .
people who leave violent relations , people with un@@ man@@ age@@ able and op@@ pres@@ sive debt , families who have been dism@@ is@@ sed by part@@ itions - all these people have problems of legal nature and this survey shows that they cannot receive the help they need .
as of June 2017 , the federal government will cut the average by 30 percent , meaning that thousands of people in Que@@ ens@@ land need to be forced to cope with their legal problems without any help .
we call on the General Prosec@@ utor and the Federal judicial Minister as well as sen@@ ators of Que@@ ens@@ land George Bran@@ dis to immediately raise these abbrevi@@ ations , so that people may receive the help they need in case of legal problems .
last year , the state government fulfilled its commitment to raise funds for guidance on the national average .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is now time to look at the needs of the municipal reporting centers and their communities as well as that the government of Pal@@ as@@ z@@ c@@ zu@@ k has invested in this important work . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Donald Tr@@ ump Ele@@ ction Camp@@ a@@ ign after employee report@@ edly drew a gun
new York : Donald Tr@@ umps Camp@@ a@@ ign has been indi@@ cted for alleged in@@ action after she was told that her campaign manager for North Carolina directed a fire@@ arm to an employee , while in February they were on a je@@ ep in a je@@ ep .
the incident was described in an indictment , which was filed on Wednesday at the Court of Charlotte by Vincent Bor@@ dini , a former software program@@ mer for the campaign in this Federal State .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Bor@@ dini has been waiting to have been waiting for months for the issue to be regulated internally before he realized that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that would not happen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Camp@@ a@@ ign Director , Ear@@ l Philip , &quot; drew a pist@@ ol , put his right finger on the trigger , and r@@ ammed the run in Vinc@@ ents Kni@@ ek@@ eh@@ le , &quot; Bor@@ dini ordered his accus@@ ation .
having compl@@ ained with the local and regional campaign management , Bor@@ dini observed that at least four other persons had the same experience with Phil@@ lip , he stated in the indictment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; arms do not have to be fired to cause damage , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bor@@ dini . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the prosec@@ ution completed only two days after the Republi@@ can presidential candidate , when he said to a crowd in North Carolina , said that the Second A@@ mend@@ ment People &quot; - Sh@@ ot@@ gun owners and weapons friends - should take action if his ri@@ val@@ in H@@ illary Clinton should be elected and ap@@ point judges .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the campaign clearly stated that the media drag@@ ged its words out of context and that it would not rise to violence . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bor@@ din@@ is complaint demands compensation from the campaign for violation of duty duty and from Philip because of bodi@@ ly injury and permanent mental damage .
g@@ umps Pres@@ ses@@ ho@@ ver Hope H@@ icks was not to be achieved for an opinion .

Berlin / Schwerin : survey of countries @-@ elections : the SPD and C@@ DU
in the upcoming elections in the federal states of Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern ( September 4th ) and Berlin ( September 18 ) considerable losses were recorded for the government party SPD and C@@ DU .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this resulted in representative surveys of the opinion research institute IN@@ SA for the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bild &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; newspaper ( Friday ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while the red @-@ black government coalition in the north could continue to gover@@ n , this is not possible after the surveys in Berlin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in both federal states , however , the SPD would be the strongest party and thus would have good chances to continue to position the head of government .
in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern , the SPD fell from 35.@@ 6 percent to 24 percent , five years ago .
according to the survey , the party only blo@@ ws close to the C@@ DU , which could come again to 23 per cent .
the third place is controversi@@ al between the left and the Af@@ D .
the left came to 19 percent ( previously 18.@@ 4 percent ) , the Af@@ D would be represented by 19 percent for the first time in the country .
in spite of slight losses , the Gre@@ ens were re@@ lu@@ ct@@ ant with 6 percent ( previously 8.7 percent ) again into the Schwer@@ iner Land@@ tag .
N@@ PD and F@@ DP were not represented in the Land@@ tag with 3 percent .
Euromonitor International has over 30 years experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems .
the C@@ DU reached only 18 percent after 23.@@ 4 percent .
Euromonitor International has over 30 years experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Af@@ D would be represented by 14 percent for the first time in the parliament office . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with 5 percent , the F@@ DP could hope for a return , while the pir@@ ates would not miss the move in contrast to 2011 .
Nokia 9000 Communic@@ ator : the first smartphone
e @-@ Mail and Internet in slow motion : 20 years ago , the Nokia Communic@@ ator came onto the market .
the success@@ ors domin@@ ate the world today - its manufacturer experienced a disaster .
the device weigh@@ ed almost half kilo@@ grams and was more than four times as difficult as an iPhone 5 .
it was th@@ icker and bigger , it was therefore not good in the hand .
on the contrary , it was quite cl@@ ums@@ y .
the built @-@ in memory initially was eight meg@@ ab@@ y@@ tes , which would suff@@ ice today for about two sel@@ fies with high resolution .
an iPhone is now shipped with at least 16 gig@@ ab@@ y@@ tes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Nokia 9000 Communic@@ ator &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; occurred exactly 20 years ago , on August 15 , 1996 , into the shops - and it was the first smartphone . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for a few euros , lovers can buy the equipment on the internet , but they origin@@ ate somehow from the stone age of the internet age .
20 years ago , however , the communic@@ ator was a sensation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Finnish mobile phone manufacturer had announced the product a few months previously at the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; C@@ eb@@ it in Hannover &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; computer trade fair in Hannover . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in fact , the new mobile phone could be sent and received for these standards : SMS and e @-@ mails were sent and received , even via fax the communic@@ ator could be reached .
even the access to web pages was possible via HTML browsers , al@@ beit slow .
a pocket calcul@@ ator was available , a digital address book and an electronic calendar .
there was a small antenna and the mobile phone could be folded like a laptop .
then there was a small keyboard and a black @-@ and @-@ white screen .
the price was quite proud : 2700 D @-@ Mark , i.e. about 1400 euros .
the average selling price of a smartphone in Germany was 392 euros in 2015 .
nobody could susp@@ ect in August 1996 that the communic@@ ator would become the beginning of the smartphone era .
since then everything is different .
the smart phones are a success story , even though not for Nokia .
the mobile savings of Finn@@ s experienced an unprecedented disaster , was eventually sold to Microsoft and handled .
today , vendors domin@@ ate the market all much later than Nokia .
being online anytime and anywhere , this is for a lot of people &apos;s everyday lives .
in 2015 , there were nearly two billion smartphone users around the world .
sold about 1.4 billion devices , Samsung and Apple were sold by alone 555 million units .
worldwide turnover with the equipment is around € 400 billion .
this includes the well @-@ running business of the countless app providers and the telecommunications concept .
a whole industry was created around the smartphone in the meantime .
the decisive breakthrough on the mass market was only beginning in 2007 , at that time , Apple &apos;s boss announced Steve Jobs on the Mac @-@ World to introduce the i@@ Ph@@ ones .
he promised three devices in one : a music player , a phone and an Internet communic@@ ator , everything is easy to use by touch screen .
the triumph@@ al march of Apple started , even today , the iPhone is the most important product of the group .
Nokia , Motorola and Black@@ berry , who ruled the market , had a look .
they finally disappeared , Black@@ berry has to fight .
the sag@@ as now have Apple and Asian vendors like Samsung .
the smartphone is a matter of course for 20 years after its invention .
on average every German guy looks now 88 times a day on his mobile phone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must all learn to put the Smartphone even away , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Jan@@ ina Ball , in charge of the Siemens executive board . &quot; &quot; &quot;
permanent availability is now regarded as a curse and a blessing at the same time .
England must direct the ol@@ ymp@@ ic spirit and extend He@@ a@@ throw
He@@ a@@ throw will not only bring renewal and prosperity to our local communities and throughout London , but throughout the country .
for me it was the biggest attraction of He@@ a@@ thro@@ ws , just as in 2012 in London when we had a great effort to ensure that all our nations and regions were benef@@ iting from the games .
the Olympics brought great benefits to Str@@ at@@ ford and the East End .
and that will be achieved by creating new possibilities for local residents and companies near He@@ a@@ throw .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for our local communities alone , we will already have 10,000 new apprentices@@ hi@@ ps , creating 4@@ 0,000 new jobs and an end to youth unemployment in the airport environment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as they were ahead of us in London 2012 , there will be such that will think that the challenge of enlargement He@@ a@@ thro@@ ws is too big .
I was told that England will never be ready for the games and that we will be bl@@ am@@ aged on the world stage .
the doub@@ ters had w@@ ron@@ ged in 2012 and they will also be wrong at He@@ a@@ throw .
there are always obstacles to overcome , but He@@ a@@ throw answers any question asked .
as the Olympic Games are He@@ a@@ throw for many and not for individuals an infrastructure project .
expansion is a way to create up to 18@@ 0,000 new jobs , £ 211 b@@ n of weather growth and leave a legacy of skills and employment both to the airport and in the whole of the UK .
we have a great team at He@@ a@@ throw , which has implemented a £ 11 billion of your infrastructure investment program in time and budget , from T5 to the world &apos;s best airport terminal , up to T2 , which was built in the middle of the two most frequ@@ ented running bridges of the world .
now they are ready to deliver a third cat@@ walk , which is supported by £ 16 billion in private investments .
London &apos;s London games were a great success for UK and I am confident that He@@ a@@ throw &apos;s enlargement will also be one .
it is time for us to ste@@ er this ol@@ ymp@@ ic spirit and expand He@@ a@@ throw as well as secure our future trade and create a leg@@ acies of skills and jobs that England can be proud of .

&quot; &quot; &quot; Ad@@ block Plus , Facebook in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ atz und Maus@@ spiel &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; regarding ad blocking
&quot; &quot; &quot; for companies that earn money with online advertising , according to one of the software manufacturers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; attempts to b@@ ypass &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ad block@@ age , a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cat and mouse game &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Thursday , only two days after Facebook announced that it would block display block@@ ages on its desktop , Ad@@ block Plus released a blog post in which it shared that users could update their filters in the program to re @-@ block advertising on the social network .
on Tuesday , Facebook shared that its desktop site would change the enco@@ ding regarding its advertis@@ ements to make it more difficult to identify indicating which part of the site is advertising .
but Ad@@ block announced it has found a new way to b@@ ypass the new codes .
in a blog post , the spokes@@ man of Ad@@ block Ben Williams wrote that &quot; this kind of hate and forth @-@ fight between the attrac@@ ting open source community and the users has already been in progress since the invention of display lock@@ ers , &quot; and that it is possible that Facebook will soon come with a new solution .
the fact that the world &apos;s largest social media company has gotten into the fight is a strong indication of how wor@@ rying indicators have become for the industry .
according to a study published last year by Pag@@ el@@ air and Adobe , some 200 million people worldwide use display lock@@ ers ; almost four times as much as 2013 .
with 1.@@ 03 billion daily active users who access Facebook on their mobile devices , Hand@@ y@@ wer@@ bung makes 84 percent of the advertising revenue fac@@ ebooks .
apart from that , mobile ad block@@ ers have no effect on Facebook &apos;s mobile app for the social network and Inst@@ ag@@ ram distributed a spokes@@ person .
advertising on Desktop PCs makes a sufficiently large proportion of revenues , so that Facebook appears to be an investment of such a step as worthwhile .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on Tuesday , Facebook shared that it would update its &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; advertising prize pool &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to have more control over it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Thursday Facebook maintained that ad@@ blocks would be wor@@ rying new filters because they would also block content on the site that are not advertising .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the users , this is not a positive experience , so we plan to address the problem , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shared a Facebook speaker in an email message . &quot; &quot; &quot;
ad block@@ ers are a stup@@ id means , which is why we have focused instead on developing tools like Ad Pre@@ ferences to put more control into the hands of the people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; women in suspected su@@ icide &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; transferred to Swiss highway &quot; &quot; &quot;
the victim was in the middle of the night on the highway .
the police call witnesses after a woman was passed on a highway in the early morning hours on Thursday with a supposed su@@ icide of several vehicles on a highway .
the incident occurred on the A1 near Morges in the canton of V@@ aud shortly after midnight .
a woman lay in the dark &apos; in an act of des@@ per@@ ation &apos; on the road and were hit by several cars , the police said in V@@ aud .
it is obvious that a Swiss woman in the age of 49 , who was passed by several vehicles , including a truck , wanted to kill himself .
she died on the spot .
several drivers have already been heard , but some have not yet been identified , said the police , who are calling them and any witnesses of the incident to report themselves .
an investigation procedure opened , which is a &quot; logical &quot; step in such a situation , G@@ illes Hof@@ st@@ etter shared the Le Tri@@ b@@ une de Gen@@ eve .
however , it remains to be seen whether one of the drivers will be displayed .
was a coll@@ ision avoid@@ able ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is something that the prosec@@ utor has to decide &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Hof@@ st@@ etter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; two similar cases in the last five years show that the drivers are not responsible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in each of the two cases , where a person ran in the dark on the highway , it was decided that drivers do not have to assume that a pedestrian navig@@ ates in the middle of the night on the highway as it was in the newspaper .
last year , a police officer was acqu@@ itted of the neg@@ ligent killing after having crossed a man and killed one night on the A1 near Pay@@ erne in August 2014 .
the 22 @-@ year @-@ old victim had dr@@ unk and has become un@@ conscious on the street , took the court .
the Court found that the polic@@ e@@ woman -- who had responded to an emergency call -- was a just@@ i@@ fiable way and that the presence of a man on the street was a &quot; totally unusual and un@@ predic@@ table situation , &quot; said the judge .
anyone who has more information about the incident on Thursday near Morges should report to the police under number 0@@ 21 644 83 46 or 0@@ 21 644 44 44 .
NA@@ SA Kli@@ m@@ amo@@ dell : Venus was once inhabit@@ able
according to the proj@@ ections of a new NA@@ SA climate model , Venus was probably inhabit@@ able once .
scientists at the Go@@ dd@@ ard Institute for Space Studies in NA@@ SA developed a model to detect the past of Venus based on tools and algorithms similar to those of climate scientists .
the model was designed to determine whether the Venus could have revealed similar conditions with its hot , water@@ less surface and CO2 @-@ tight atmosphere .
scientists have previously indicated that the slow rotation of Venus could be explained by its dense atmosphere .
but the latest simulation suggests that the Venus could have had a thin , earth @-@ like atmosphere and nevertheless slowly revol@@ ved .
the model also illuminated the top@@ ography of the early Venus .
the planet probably had more dry areas than the Earth , but once had enough water and geo@@ graphic vari@@ ability in order to accommodate life and protect against rapid ev@@ ap@@ oration .
the early Venus also benef@@ ited from a sun that was 30 percent lighter .
&quot; in the G@@ ISS model simulation , the slow rotation of the Venus exhibits its day @-@ side of the sun for almost two months , &quot; explained G@@ ISS Scienti@@ sts Anthony Del Gen@@ io in a press release .
this war@@ ms up the surface and produces rain that creates a thick layer of clouds , which acts like a umbrella to shield the surface of much of the sun heat .
the result is average temperatures , which are some degrees cooler than that of the Earth today .
the model produced a history of Venus that re@@ sembles evolution that was previously thought by planets resear@@ ches .
although it was presum@@ ably habit@@ able , Venus was exposed to too much heat and ultr@@ avi@@ olet light over the course of several billions of years .
her oceans ev@@ apor@@ ated and her water vap@@ or was burned away from ultr@@ avi@@ olet light .
as their hydro@@ gen@@ esis , only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide remained with a dead@@ ly greenhouse effect -- Venus , as we know it today .
the researchers divided the results of their new Venus climate model in Ge@@ ophysi@@ cal Research Let@@ ters .
Patrick Roy reti@@ res as a coach of Aval@@ an@@ che
Patrick Roy retired on Thursday as a coach and Vice President Of Ho@@ ckey Operations of the Colorado Aval@@ an@@ che and led to a low co @-@ determination in the decision @-@ making process of the team .
alternatively @-@ President / General Manager of the Color@@ ful Joe Sak@@ ic confirmed this decision and realized that the association will immediately search for a new coach .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; over the past three years I have fulfilled my duties as head coach and Vice President Of Ho@@ ckey Operations of the Colorado Aval@@ an@@ che with energy , passion and determination , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the 50 @-@ year @-@ old Roy in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the course of the summer , I &apos;ve been thinking about how I could improve this team to give it more depth , this it requires and to bring it to a higher level .
to achieve this , the vision of the trainer and vice President Of Ho@@ ckey Operations has to be perfectly aligned with the organisation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he must also have a right to decide on decisions that influence the performance of the team . &quot; &quot; &quot;
these conditions are not currently being fulfilled .
Sak@@ ic who had hired Roy on May 23 , 2013 thank@@ ed him for his contributions to the team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Patrick informed me about this decision today , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Sak@@ ic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we all appreciate what he did for our organisation and wish him only the best for the future .
Roy Adam@@ s Awards were the best coach of the le@@ ague during his debut season at Aval@@ an@@ ches 2013 @-@ 14 .
he led the Club to 112 points and the first place in Central Vision , but Colorado was defeated in the first round of the Minn@@ es@@ ota Pla@@ yo@@ ffs and missed the post@@ season in each of the last years .
the Aval@@ an@@ ches recorded a 39 @-@ 39 @-@ 4 mark in the 2015 @-@ 16 season and fell behind the game for a second wild@@ card spot in the Western Conference by five points .
as Hall of F@@ ame Tor@@ wart Roy won four Stan@@ ley C@@ ups -- two songs with the Montreal Canadi@@ ens and the Aval@@ an@@ che .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Nor@@ des@@ e@@ e@@ öl@@ werk again resu@@ me talks , strike off strike &quot; &quot; &quot;
the struggle for wage re@@ mun@@ eration for North Sea co@@ workers will be exposed , while all quar@@ rels put on the table for a new round of talks , said negoti@@ ators .
strikes against the oil @-@ field service provider Wood Group have been carried out spor@@ adi@@ cally on platforms in the North Sea , operated by Royal Dutch Shell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Wood Group and the Un@@ ite and R@@ MT Uni@@ ons can confirm that we have agreed to restart the process of the current dispute , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says it in a common statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will stop some full @-@ day sessions over the next few weeks , starting next year to restart the problems . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the unions said that their last strike , which is the first in over 25 years , is a protest against possible wage cuts of up to 30 percent .
this year Wood Group has short@@ ened the rates of its counter@@ actors in the North Sea by around 9 percent due to negative market pressure .
the company &apos;s advice is followed by a 10 percent decline for on@@ shore contractors in 2014 .
the company said that additional cuts to the company are given the required space to come through the market down@@ turn .
for its part , Shell has released thousands of people and announced plans to aband@@ on its oil and gas business activities in up to 10 countries as it ration@@ alises its business activities as a result of its meg@@ ac@@ l@@ eness with the British energy company BG Group .
energy companies are under pressure due to lower cru@@ de oil prices , an economic situation that was reinforced by the British decision in June to leave the European Union .
the Scot@@ t@@ ish parliament member Dave Anderson met with workers &quot; leaders at the start of this week to discuss one of the greatest work disputes ever held in the North Sea .
the North Sea is important for the regional economy , he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the North Sea and in the whole country we need an economy that works for many and not only for a few , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2016 , less than $ 1.4 billion are expected to spend new projects in the North Sea in comparison with an average of around $ 7 billion in the last five years .
Ke@@ pler measures the rot@@ ational rate of stars in the con@@ stellation of the P@@ lei@@ ades
the latest mission with Ke@@ pler Space teles@@ cope helped astronom@@ ers to collect the most complete catalog of rot@@ ational rates among the stars of the con@@ stellation of the P@@ lei@@ ades .
the new data will help the astronom@@ ers understand why stars in the cluster are rot@@ ated to different rates as well as in what context the rotation @-@ time periods with the planetary formation stand .
&quot; we hope that by comparing our results with other star clust@@ ers , we learn more about the relationship between the mass of a star , its age and even the history of its solar system , &quot; said Lu@@ isa Reb@@ ull , a researcher at Cal@@ tech &apos;s Infr@@ ared Processing and Analysis Center in Pas@@ ad@@ ena , in a press release .
the star cluster of the P@@ lei@@ ades is 445 light @-@ years away from the Earth .
many stars in this cluster , which emerged around 125 million years ago , are now reaching adul@@ th@@ ood .
you are now turning the fastest way .
at peak rot@@ ation@@ rates , these att@@ acking stars reach large amounts of star@@ ches .
as these winds travel through the magnet @-@ fields of the stars , they have a slow effect on the stars .
when a star age , its rotation rate begins to slow down .
Ke@@ pler measures the rot@@ ational rate of every star by identifying the time between the appearance of a recogni@@ zable star spot -- such as sun@@ spots -- .
the latest Cat@@ alog of rot@@ ational rates suggests that more massive stars rot@@ ate more slowly than less massive stars .
Reb@@ ull compar@@ es the stars with dancers , with bigger stars s@@ lower of pi@@ rou@@ ettes than smaller ones .
&quot; in the B@@ allet &quot; of the P@@ lei@@ ades , we see that slow rot@@ ors tend to be massive , whereas faster rot@@ ors tend to be very bright stars , &quot; Reb@@ ull said .
since the star cluster of the P@@ lei@@ ades is so close , it serves as an ideal cosmic laboratory to compare stell@@ ar qualities like rot@@ ational rates .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the star cluster of the P@@ lei@@ ades offers a anchor for theoretical models of stell@@ ar rotation in both directions , younger and older , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Reb@@ ull said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is much more than we would like to know more about how , when and why stars slow down their rot@@ ations and so to speak their &quot; dance shoes . &quot;
Reb@@ ull and her colleagues reported in detail in three newspaper reports about their latest analysis of the ple@@ j@@ ams of rotation that will soon appear in the Astr@@ onom@@ ical Journal .
a controversi@@ al bas@@ eb@@ all star occurs
the tears ran at Alex Rodri@@ gu@@ ez faster than the US bas@@ eb@@ all star in the best days from Base to Base .
after his emotional re@@ sign@@ ation , the 41 year old pro will wear the T@@ ampa Bay R@@ ays a last time the jer@@ sey of his New York Yan@@ ke@@ es .
&quot; I love this game and this team . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I say &apos; Goo@@ db@@ ye &apos; to join , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the 14 @-@ time All @-@ Star @-@ Game @-@ participant of the Major League Bas@@ eb@@ all ( ML@@ B ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
three times , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez was elected as the most valuable player in the le@@ ague , in 2009 he won the World Series with the Yan@@ ke@@ es .
his signature under a ten @-@ year contract has been awarded 27 million US dollars annually since 2007 .
until the end of the contract on 31 December 2017 , he will act as a consultant and youth coach - at full sal@@ ary .
as a player , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez paid a long time with performance .
with 696 Hom@@ er@@ uns , 3@@ 114 hits and 2021 points for his teams ( &quot; R@@ uns &quot; ) for the Seattle marin@@ ers ( 1994 to 2000 ) , the Texas Rang@@ ers ( 2001 @-@ 2004 ) , and since 2005 he made some mil@@ estones .
with the Hall @-@ of @-@ F@@ ame members H@@ ank Aaron and Wil@@ lie M@@ ays , two other bas@@ eb@@ all players have similar values in the most important statistics .
however , the 41 @-@ year @-@ old should not be recorded in the Hall Hall of the bas@@ eb@@ alls .
&quot; &quot; &quot; because so successful Rodri@@ gu@@ ez - nick@@ name &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A @-@ Rod &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - was in the field , so controversi@@ al is his appearance outside the square . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; already in 2009 the super@@ star appeared at &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ES@@ PN &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; between 2001 and 2003 to have been bann@@ ed ster@@ o@@ ids . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in August 2013 , he was barri@@ c@@ aded by the so @-@ called Bio@@ gen@@ esis sc@@ andal until the end of 2014 for 211 games .
Rodri@@ gu@@ ez is considered the main susp@@ ect to have received high @-@ performance funds for years through an anti @-@ aging clinic in South Florida .
after a dispute , the lock was still reduced to 162 encounters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the League could even have done a favour for 2014 , because I played 20 years without a break , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said at that time sweet . &quot; &quot; &quot;
even his f@@ are@@ well days do not run quietly .
while many bas@@ eb@@ all legends have once again received the big stage in their last games , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez had to sit on the bench frequently .
&quot; my job does not include f@@ are@@ well tour . &quot;
&quot; my job involves trying to win any game , &quot; estimated Yan@@ ke@@ es Coach Joe Gir@@ ardi .
after all , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , who was married with the act@@ ress Cameron Di@@ az and told the relations with Pop@@ star Madonna and the act@@ ress K@@ ate Hudson , got sympathy for fans of Yan@@ ke@@ e @-@ Erz@@ riv@@ alen Boston Red So@@ x .
&quot; we want A @-@ Rod &quot; for the 4 : 9 defeat against the Rodri@@ gu@@ ez team .

&quot; &quot; &quot; the national association takes the matter &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very seriously and demands full cooperation with the investigations , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; quoted X@@ in@@ hua from a message : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will work together with the International Sports Court CAS and will accept the judgment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the first time in history it is no longer the I@@ OC , but the CAS is responsible for the sanc@@ tion@@ ation of athletes with positive cases .
also during the night of Rio , the news about the positive rehear@@ sal was by Dan@@ ek@@ ova , the 33 @-@ year @-@ old went to the offensive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had three tests , all negative , and my fourth test was positive , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an unbelie@@ vable shock &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; she said to the Bulgarian TV channel B@@ NT . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she is innocent , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the only explanation could be dietary supplements , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained the ath@@ l@@ ete . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the report , it is said that the bann@@ ed substance is about the blood dop@@ ing agent EPO .
Dan@@ ek@@ ova was pro@@ vision@@ ally suspended , according to B@@ NT the B @-@ Probe has already been positive .
Bulgaria &apos;s Prime Minister Bo@@ j@@ ko Bor@@ is@@ so@@ v reported immediately with criticism of the Bul@@ letin .
&quot; I don &apos;t understand why sport@@ s@@ men don &apos;t get the right conclusions , &quot; he said : &quot; we are Bulg@@ arians under observation , so many have been excluded . &quot;
thus , for example , all wei@@ ght@@ lif@@ ters from the chronic @-@ dop@@ ing nation must not take part in Rio .
on Friday the case &quot; Adrian Ziel@@ inski &quot; was also known , the London Olympic champion in the class up to 85 kg was tested similar to his brother Tom@@ as@@ z three days previously on the an@@ abolic ster@@ oid N@@ and@@ rol@@ on .
both theore@@ tically deny taking , both may not start in class up to 94 kg .
before starting the athletes , Dan@@ ek@@ ova is another serious blow for the reputation of the whole sport .
the World Association IA@@ AF had prohibited the entire Russian team except for systematic dop@@ ing the start , even the nation nation Kenya produces numerous bad news in Rio .
in the swimming sport , the past trials in China also had caused a sharp confront@@ ation between the athletes .
so the Fr@@ ench@@ man Cam@@ ille Lac@@ our@@ t attacked the Chinese Olympic champion Sun Yang har@@ sch .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sun Yang p@@ ink@@ elt purple &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if I see the podium over 200 m of Fre@@ estyle , I want to hand over , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lac@@ our@@ t in the French radio . &quot; &quot; &quot;
sun was also at the heart of a confront@@ ation with the Australian M@@ ack H@@ ort@@ on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have no time and no respect for dop@@ ing fraud , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said this . &quot; &quot; &quot;
sun was positively tested in the Chinese champion@@ ships on the stim@@ ul@@ ant &apos;s Tri@@ met@@ azi@@ dine , but only had to sit down a three @-@ month lock .
data kl@@ au : so per@@ fi@@ de black@@ mail h@@ ack@@ ers their ran@@ som
programm@@ ers from black@@ mail malware have targeted businesses - and are successful in doing so .
according to a recent survey by malware specialists Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes among 540 companies in North America , Great Britain and Germany , 40 percent of respon@@ dents surv@@ ey@@ ed over the past twelve months at least once , partially multiple victims of an attack with black@@ mail software .
Euromonitor International has over 30 years experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems .
40 per cent of the victims paid will@@ ingly the ran@@ som sal@@ aries demanded by the perpet@@ rators to use the challenged systems and data again .
the perpet@@ rators speci@@ alize their black@@ mailing software , according to the observ@@ ations of Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes , on attacks in company networks .
if they are successful there , the potential for rede@@ em@@ ing ran@@ som is significantly higher than in private users .
&quot; we are currently watching a sc@@ ary fast evolution of the malware , &quot; explains Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes boss Mar@@ cin K@@ lec@@ z@@ yn@@ ski in conversation with the &quot; world . &quot;
in 2008 most of the painting programmes were designed to send advertis@@ ements .
then the perpet@@ rators discovered the black@@ mail software for itself .
first , private users were the target , but the change to corporate attacks took place in the past few months .
Ran@@ som@@ ware works after a simple pattern : once active on the computer of a victim , it searches for recently changed files such as Word , Excel or Database files as well as archives of images and videos .
these files encryp@@ t the ran@@ som@@ ware and del@@ etes the origin@@ als .
subsequently , the software presents the demands of the black@@ press .
to get the final key code to the files , the victims must transfer money - mostly in the form of cryp@@ to@@ currencies Bit@@ coin .
however , where private users are using the personal photo database on the game , companies are concerned with sensitive customer data or project databases without which the production is shut down .
accordingly , the damage occurs when a ran@@ som@@ ware fails .
22 per cent of the affected German companies reported sales losses due to ran@@ som@@ ware , 13 per cent had to break the business completely , in one case people were in danger of life .
in Germany there were already several hospitals victims of attacks , whose patients can be threatened by the loss of medical records .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we always say the victims : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; don &apos;t pay , you only support the problem , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says K@@ lec@@ z@@ yn@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , 80 to 90 percent of companies who pay , get their data again .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is difficult for managers to reject the demands of the perpet@@ rators in the face of down@@ time . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the hacker again know that and try everything to build a good reputation .
in a recent study , the F @-@ Secure Security researchers examined the land @-@ occupied areas and contact with the presses and come to the result : the perpet@@ rators are actually trying to build a kind of customer service to get more money .
they explain their sacrifices via chat on how to pay per Bit@@ coin , set free accessible support websites or de@@ cryp@@ t for free example files .
and will be rede@@ emed private individuals after payments of a few hundred euros , companies have to negoti@@ ate partly hard and pay five @-@ digit sums to retri@@ eve their data un@@ encrypted .
in view of the potentially high and relatively ris@@ ky gains from ran@@ som@@ ware black@@ mail , the h@@ ack@@ ers become more and more professional and share the work , declares security expert Ch@@ ester Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski from the Anti@@ virus vendor SOPH@@ OS : &quot; a single person can write a ran@@ som@@ ware roughly within a week . &quot;
however , it is more likely that it is about three or four people .
the programm@@ ers sell their damage software then in the form of a software construction kit to the actual black@@ press .
the malware kits have been developed by malware , providing advice and additional tools for a single , fixed price between 1000 and 10,000 dollars .
&quot; included in delivery is an adaptation tool , so that smaller configurations , appearance and br@@ anding can be changed , &quot; says Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski .
the presses then look for further h@@ ack@@ ers in order to spread the freshly purchased software among the victims .
we live in a service sector .
thus one logs in one of the forums in the underground , bu@@ ys the set of a criminal and commissioned one more to install the software on as many PCs as possible .
the payment is eff@@ ected per infected computer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; usually the crimin@@ als then apply sp@@ amm@@ ers with the spread , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; declares Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the risk of ran@@ som@@ ware is now known by many companies that better secure their data .
more than 50 percent of the companies IT leaders in the Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes survey trust to be able to aver@@ t ran@@ som@@ ware via file @-@ back @-@ ups and scanner software .
accordingly , the perpet@@ rators are already pursuing new strategies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the encryption of data alone is not a sufficient threat to successful recovery , the perpet@@ rators are threatening to release sensitive data such as customer lists or price calculations , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes boss Mar@@ cin K@@ lec@@ z@@ yn@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this means that the potential for damages depends on the type of data still much higher than before .
in the future , the perpet@@ rators could have completely new goals on the internet of things in the future .
on the Hack@@ er@@ konferenz Def@@ con , safety researchers demonstrated how to control a thermo@@ stat that was connected to the Internet .
in the middle of winter , the activation of such blocked heat could certainly be worth a ran@@ som .
if the offen@@ ders then block a whole production line in a factory instead of heating in the future , Ran@@ som@@ ware could also be a topic in Industry 4.0 .
one for all cases
Honda HR @-@ V is flexible and suitable for everyday use
in the small HR @-@ V Honda will pack everything : a little SU@@ V , a little cou@@ pé and also the versatility of a min@@ iv@@ an .
sounds rather un@@ loaded , but the HR @-@ V , which has been constructed on the same new platform as the new jazz , proves to be extremely flexible in everyday life .
although the only 1.60 m high HR @-@ V is rather small , the passengers have a lot of space in both the first row and in the rear , it does not work closely at any point .
the materials of the interior are well finished and work pleasant , only the cock@@ pit @-@ top is down there .
the HR @-@ V is more versatile than comparable vehicles in storage space .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there is not only a trunk of 453 l at high @-@ speed and 10@@ 26 l with revers@@ ed back arm@@ rests , but there is the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Magic Se@@ ats &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is less magical than it sounds : the seat surfaces of the rear bench can be folded up like Kin@@ os@@ es@@ sel and thus offer storage space , which is very high from the floor to the ceilings .
the trunk can be loaded easily , but the loading height of 650 mm is slightly higher than with the comparable Peugeot 2008 .
the tested 1.6 @-@ l diesel with 88 kW / 120 hp acceler@@ ates the HR @-@ V thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm in wide speed ranges .
however , he should make his work qui@@ eter qui@@ eter .
the daily consumption of 4.7 l / 100 km is pleas@@ ing .
there is still another engine : a 1.5 litre petrol engine with 96 kW / 130 hp .
an all @-@ wheel drive is not offered .
the driving behavior is balanced , a good compromise between dynam@@ ism and comfort .
but the steering should be somewhat more direct .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the equipment leaves nothing to be desired in the tested top version &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Executive &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
among the safety systems , the City emergency brake assistant ( operates up to tempo 32 ) , the coll@@ ision warning system and the lane assistant .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the coll@@ ision war@@ ner sometimes irrit@@ ates because he evalu@@ ates many obstacles as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; approaching objects &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the beam assistant works very reliably .
and the intelligent tempo regul@@ ator respon@@ ds to traffic sign recognition and cho@@ ke the speed if required .
but the full connectivity is only available for the top features : 7 @-@ inch touch screen , nav@@ i , app integration and more .
two USB and one HDMI socket are under the arm@@ rest and are therefore a bit aw@@ k@@ ward to achieve .
the approximately 29@@ 000 euros for the well @-@ equipped top diesel are fine .
those who do not want to invest so much will get the petrol engine from 200@@ 00 Euro , the diesel from 23@@ 000 Euro .
the engines comply with the Euro @-@ 6 emission standard .
the HR @-@ V offers a versatile and everyday car .
airline is not liable : crash on passenger &apos;s bridge
an airline is not liable for the crash of a passenger on the passenger &apos;s bridge .
because a liability is concei@@ vable only for dangers typical of aviation , the Higher Regional Court of Düsseldorf argu@@ ed ( A@@ z . : 18 U 124 / 14 ) .
the pl@@ ain@@ ti@@ ff had broken a knee with the fall .
but the accident could have happened everywhere - it is a general risk of life , such as the court .
the airline did not have to pay any damages to the man .
cases of illness : when paid by the organis@@ er
dise@@ ased ho@@ liday@@ makers will only get money after their trip , if the cause of the disease is des@@ perate in the hotel .
but this is only the case when more than ten percent of the guests show the same symptoms .
in the negoti@@ ated case a family was severely affected by di@@ arr@@ ho@@ ea and v@@ om@@ iting on the second day of their Turkish li@@ king .
she spent almost the entire vacation in the room .
their disease res@@ orted the vac@@ ation@@ ers to a def@@ ective treatment plant , which supp@@ os@@ edly contamin@@ ated sea@@ water .
the family was the view that the trip had been def@@ ici@@ ent - and compl@@ ained against the organis@@ er .
before the court the pl@@ ain@@ ti@@ ffs had no success .
indeed , the purification plant was indeed def@@ ective .
but the organizer was only shortly before departure of the pl@@ ain@@ ti@@ ffs .
until then , he had to assume that the sea@@ water was fine .
so he did not viol@@ ate his duty , so judgment .
especially in the samples of the water no im@@ pur@@ ities have been found .
the condition of several hotel guests - possibly by infection among each other - belongs to the overall risk of life .
of 691 guests were only 38 ill .
de Mai@@ zi@@ ère said , after the acts of violence perpet@@ rated by refugees in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach in July , many people were worried about further attacks .
the state must be so@@ ber and decis@@ iv@@ ely react to terror .
sure : our country will not answer the violence perpet@@ rators with hatred and cle@@ av@@ age .
we will not treat this triumph to the terrorists .
if criminal offen@@ ders had to leave the country faster , the security and strength also increase the consent of the population for refugee policy .
de Mai@@ zi@@ ère aims to implement the proposals up to the election of the German Bundestag in 2017 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he also announced another personnel rein@@ forcement of the security forces , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a medium vi@@ cal magn@@ itude over several years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sympathy for terrorism must be under punishment again . &quot; &quot; &quot;
video surveillance should be improved , the weapon law will be am@@ ended in such a way that the purchase of weapons on the internet is more difficult .
the last much discussed tail light for doctors is supposed to remain intact after de Mai@@ zi@@ ères .
however , he wants to look for solutions in dialogue with the medical profession , as the threat of citizens can be reduced , he said with a view of psychological ab@@ normal@@ ities .
in order to counter@@ act radic@@ alisation of refugees , the minister considers a better social support .
teachers need to be better prepared for dealing with trau@@ mat@@ ised people .
in order to prosec@@ ute crimin@@ als in special areas of the Internet ( Dar@@ k@@ net ) , de Mai@@ zi@@ ère is planning the use of conce@@ aled agents .
&quot; &quot; &quot; SPD leader Gabriel said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything that helps to further enhance security . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important that the Minister of Interior spoke clearly against action . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was a f@@ are@@ well for the Schar@@ f@@ macher in the C@@ DU / CS@@ U , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gabriel said to the newspapers of the Fun@@ ke media group ( Friday ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; de Mai@@ zi@@ ère had rejected calls from the Union after a bur@@ ka ban and the abol@@ ition of double nation@@ ality previously . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a general prohibition of enforcement considers it constitu@@ tionally un@@ problem@@ atic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you cannot do everything you reject , and I reject the wearing of the bur@@ ka .
it is possible to talk about rules about road traffic or for witnesses to court .
green leader Simone Peter accused the minister , he wanted to sim@@ ulate with ever new anti @-@ terror par@@ c@@ els of action and capacity for action .
&quot; &quot; &quot; left @-@ party chief Bernd Ri@@ ex@@ inger said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fleet of PRO@@ VER@@ BS and a ti@@ ghtening of the right of stay bring people in this country no more security . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
better traffic flow on the motorway zu@@ br@@ inger
it st@@ umps regularly on the b@@ ypass road - here &apos;s a picture of November .
but this should change : the rule of law shall be prolonged .
this is a good news for all car drivers who are standing in traffic on the environmental street every night in the traffic jam when they drive over the motorway exit Zu@@ br@@ inger ( A 43 ) .
the road construction is extended on Tuesday and Wednesday ( 16 / 17 August ) in the area between Hammer Straße and exit Wes@@ eler Straße the right @-@ in lane by 700 meters .
drive directly from Hammer Straße to the right .
the big advantage : traffic divi@@ des itself early , thus improving the overall flow of traffic on the busy passage of the Bundes@@ straße 51 .
the idea of the extended exit had the C@@ DU faction in the district of Münster @-@ West .
the road nar@@ rowing on the Zu@@ br@@ inger is anno@@ ying the drivers especially between 17 and 7 o &apos;clock .
on week@@ days , the return from the back to the bridge over the Alber@@ slo@@ fen path and sometimes beyond .
reason is the needle &apos;s eye on the B 51 shortly before the exit Wes@@ eler street .
from here traffic is guided only once in a single lane via the motorway bridge .
the second track had to be built more than three quarters of years ago .
the reason : static calculations had shown that the bridge no longer possesses the required carrying capacity , in order to absorb the heavy load of gravity above all .
as long as this bott@@ len@@ eck and the associated gest@@ ure will last , the responsible state operation cannot be said .
however , it has to be reck@@ oned with years : because the bridge has an official remaining usable length up to 20@@ 34 .
for the extension of the rule of law , the Landes@@ betrieb deliberately selected the traffic @-@ less time in the school holidays because with disabilities .
traffic is passed by on Tuesday and on Wednesday at the construction site .
intercultural travel : cultural activities for schools
&quot; &quot; &quot; the international class of the Wald@@ schule visited the play &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The In@@ visible House &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
N@@ ima &apos;s and the Junge Theater are planning a music project now .
N@@ ima &apos; s association makes it possible for young people with a migration and refugee background to visit cultural institutions in Münster .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; class International &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the Wald@@ schule Kinder@@ haus has visited an idea of the award @-@ winning piece &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The In@@ visible House &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the Young The@@ aters Münster . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the context of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Inter@@ cultural Journey &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the association N@@ ima &apos;s &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Inter@@ cultural Journey &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; 19 students between eleven and 15 years visited the st@@ aging in the small house . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the beginning of the year , the association , which has set itself the goal for the cultural integration of young people with a migration and refugee background , offers schools with welcome classes the opportunity to visit cultural institutions in Münster as part of this project .
most of the young people in the class have come to Mu@@ en@@ ster between September 2015 and March 2016 , including Afghanistan , Iran , Serbia and Syria .
thanks to the chore@@ o@@ graphi@@ es , the scenic images and video anim@@ ations , it was possible to follow the course of action nonetheless , so the press release of the Young Theater Münster .
the N@@ ima &apos;@@ s association , founded by Dr. Tann@@ az West@@ er@@ berg from abroad , and the Junge Theater will work together in the coming season as part of a music theatre project .
from October to December you@@ ths with and without escape and migration background will have the opportunity to visit professionally guided courses in the fields of singing , dancing , acting and music .
activities for children and families in the area of theatre play and theat@@ rical language education are planned .
the project &quot; Inter@@ cultural Journey &quot; goes on .
given the increased numbers of refugees , the association expects many classes to participate .
rain instead of Stern@@ schn@@ u@@ ppen : hope for improvement of weather
the weather has made the star schn@@ u@@ ppen gu@@ ck@@ ers in the southwest of Germany during the night to Friday a stroke through the bill - but there is still hope .
the night was po@@ or@@ ly suitable for clouds and rain to observe the cel@@ est@@ ial spect@@ acle , said the chairman of the observ@@ atory Wel@@ z@@ heim , Hans @-@ Ulrich Keller , on Friday morning .
our hope lies on the night to Saturday .
the weather should be good , then we see many star sn@@ aps in the sky .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Stern@@ schu@@ ppen &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is Persi@@ an , which is part of the fastest shooting stars with 216@@ 000 kilometers per hour . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they have their name because they seemingly come from the con@@ stellation of Per@@ se@@ us , that goes up in the north @-@ east .
relaxing Night : tips for Sle@@ eping Dis@@ orders
in the evening you are rolled around forever , at night you are aw@@ ake for hours , in the morning it &apos;s far from the wake of the wake of the wake of the wake .
this is anything but relaxing .
after all , with such problems in good company : according to the Robert Koch Institute , about a quarter of adult sleep disorders and more than ten percent feel their sleep frequently or permanently than not relaxing .
how do sleeping problems or sleep distur@@ ban@@ ces ?
there are several forms of sleep disorders , and there can be many reasons underlying them , empha@@ sizes Hans @-@ Günter We@@ e@@ ß , Member of the German Society for Schla@@ ff@@ ing and Sle@@ ep Medicine .
what one understands , however , is the in@@ som@@ nia , i.e. an entry and sleep disorder .
many people feel as uns@@ at@@ is@@ factory or in@@ adequate , says Jens Wag@@ enk@@ ne@@ cht , member of the German Haus@@ er Association with practice in Lower Saxony .
what is behind sleep disorders ?
the causes of sleep disorders are complex .
behind it , organic , mental or behavi@@ our@@ al factors , but also drugs are stuck .
in@@ frequently , in@@ som@@ nia is an expression of another disease .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very early awakening is common in case of depression , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says We@@ e@@ ß . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and it can be that various factors would like each other .
for example , those who have a her@@ ni@@ ated disc can lie down badly , w@@ akes up every two to three hours and probably starts to p@@ onder@@ ing about everyday problems and wor@@ ries , We@@ e@@ ß gives an example .
this leads to tension , and sleep is no longer possible .
when should I contact a doctor ?
anyone who does not sleep well over a period of one month or at least three nights per week should go to the doctor , advis@@ es we@@ e@@ ß .
the imp@@ air@@ ment may look quite different : one is down@@ cast , tired , in@@ gest@@ ed , has difficulties with attention and concentration , is easily irrit@@ able , has mood sw@@ ings or bodi@@ ly dis@@ comfort such as stomach or head@@ ache .
to alle@@ vi@@ ate sleeping disorder , it is important to find out their causes .
the treatment options include behavi@@ our@@ al changes , cognitive behavi@@ our@@ al therapy or medicines - classical sleeping pills only in exceptional cases and at most for two weeks - in@@ quire .
Prof. Ingo Fi@@ etze , head of the Inter@@ disciplinary Center of the Char@@ ité University Medicine Berlin , is sc@@ arc@@ ely abandoned in Germany .
therefore , in case of sleep problems one should first turn to the house doctor , advis@@ es we@@ e@@ ß .
this can be clar@@ ified with investigations whether the problems have a physical cause .
who should go to sleep laboratory , and what happens ?
for example , for examination in the sleep laboratory , for example in snor@@ ing with breathing apparatus , in case of mor@@ ti@@ bility , in sleeping @-@ conver@@ ters or if one does not find the cause of a breakdown disorder , Fi@@ etze explains .
you don &apos;t have to prepare for the examination .
you should spend the day normally .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; please do not make a mid@@ day sleep , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Fi@@ etze . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the tast@@ ings , one goes to bed at his usual time .
in addition to the electrodes on the body , one carries a nas@@ al mask , a chest strap and a fe@@ eler on the finger .
in addition , a camera records the sleeping @-@ end at the ceiling .
how can suffer@@ ers get a grip on the problems ?
there are quite a lot of adjusting screws on which one can set for a better sleep .
We@@ e@@ ß counts on : regular sleeping and recording times , not too long in bed , do not sleep on the day , do not watch TV for falling as@@ le@@ ep , avoid alcohol and not watch the watch at night - then you start to calculate immediately , and that &apos;s all and not condu@@ ci@@ ve .
what the jungle camp with missing med@@ als in swimming
the former German swi@@ mmer Markus Dei@@ bler has expressed himself via Facebook to dis@@ ap@@ pointing the DS@@ V team at Olymp@@ is .
in December 2014 he obtained gold for the first time in Doh@@ a for the first time in Doh@@ a , while at the same time he presented his first world record .
now the former DS@@ V @-@ Ath@@ l@@ ete Markus Dei@@ bler has placed himself in front of his ex @-@ team colleagues on Facebook .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a country where an Olympic champion gets 20.000 € award and a jungle king 15@@ 0,000 € shouldn &apos;t be surprised about missing med@@ als , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the 26 @-@ year @-@ old wrote on his Facebook page on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the conveyor system in swimming @-@ sports is bad , the dop@@ ing controls on the other hand are very good .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with this , we cannot compete with countries who promote a great deal and do not see or even operate in the subject of dop@@ ing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t tell you to set the controls here , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he continued . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if he wanted to start a com@@ eback , Dei@@ bler would have to be announced nine months before his first launch of the National Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing Agency ( NA@@ DA ) .
this is exactly what you should do with countries too .

airport : Ban@@ de arrested by Al@@ tes von Bag@@ gage
professional th@@ ie@@ ves at Düsseldorf Airport
on Thursday , civil pen@@ alties of the Düsseldorf police managed to capture two women and two men between the ages of 50 and 61 .
the susp@@ ects had done several hand@@ ker@@ chie@@ fs and luggage lock@@ ers as a ban@@ de .
at 9 : 30 p.m. civil servants in the area of Düsseldorf Airport recognized a gang that was known to the polic@@ eman of past the@@ ft of the@@ ft .
the two women and two men had committed several deleg@@ ations since the middle of July and were passionate , working hard and especially professional .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the specialists of the crime com@@ miss@@ ariat 34 can prove the di@@ ver , who had come to Germany for the off@@ ence of crimes committed to Germany , to prove four deeds . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the same time , they had exploited more than 15,@@ 000 euros .
old buildings , some lime pon@@ ds , inter@@ lac@@ ed by a rest of the cob@@ ble@@ stone p@@ av@@ ings : the R@@ ī@@ ga Street in Berlin @-@ Friedrich@@ sh@@ ain does not seem like at first sight , but the police is one of the &quot; dangerous places &quot; of the city .
if one goes along the road from east to west , one passes on play@@ grounds , a newly painted kinder@@ garten and a bi@@ ol@@ aden .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on the façade of a grey house someone has spra@@ yed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ug@@ ly ! &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
compared to a Li@@ dl , which is to be demol@@ ished soon , a house with high windows and 133 new flats will be built here until 2017 .
article about this &quot; trendy district , &quot; as the competent real estate company Friedrich@@ sh@@ ain calls , will , however , be preferred by burning cars in recent weeks .
reason is the house with number 94 : once it was occupied , meanwhile the residents have rent contracts , but on the ground floor there are still rooms occupied and are used for events .
&quot; &quot; &quot; since the beginning of the year , especially the Berlin Interior Minister H@@ enkel has been calling for a tough police action against the project , the area referred to as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; No @-@ Go @-@ Zone &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for polic@@ emen and the 94 as the starting point of autonomous violence . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on June 22 , the rooms on the ground floor , the Kad@@ ter@@ schm@@ ie@@ de , had been ev@@ acu@@ ated with 300 police officers , the police advised three weeks of official statements with 30 to 40 officials and three crew trucks on site , locked parts of the road and stopped visitors from entering the house with number 94 .
meanwhile , renovated building workers commissioned the premises of the unknown owners .
on 13 July , a Berlin Administr@@ ative Court decided that the clearance was illegal , and a day later , police and building workers went under the che@@ ers of sympath@@ iz@@ ers and residents .
on this summer afternoon the street works peace@@ fully : parents walk with children , people sit on the side@@ walk in front of the houses in the sun , others enter@@ tain vor@@ m Sp@@ ät@@ i .
in the immediate vicinity of the house projects there is a primary school and kinder@@ gart@@ ens .
left violence is not the main concern of many residents : K@@ erst@@ in Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who since 1999 lives in Kie@@ z , and J@@ ana * , who is raising three children here , are mainly generated by the police presence .
with the inhabitants of the house projects , they share the concern for increasing rent and gent@@ ri@@ fication .
it does not sound like a Kie@@ z who wanted to make a majority of police plaster against v@@ andal@@ ous lef@@ ti@@ sts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the dit@@ ch , which the Berlin inner sen@@ ator and the police between house occup@@ ants and their neigh@@ bors arise , does not exist . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Friedrich@@ sh@@ ain in the east of Berlin was actually a traditional &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; working @-@ class &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; district , which also today has a low average income and a high risk of poverty in comparison with the rest of the city . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 1990 , many houses were occupied in the former G@@ DR , including almost the entire Main@@ zer street close to the Riga .
while the Main@@ zer was cleared under large police pan@@ es in a regular street battle , many of the projects were leg@@ alized in the Riga and are still inhabited by the people who had occupied it 26 years ago .
at the same time , the neighborhood has become increasingly a magnet for tourists and pol@@ lin@@ ers from around the world over the past few years . residents from G@@ DR times and former domestic occup@@ iers are now sharing their neighborhood with them .
this is reflected in the rent , which has increased by nearly 60 per cent since 2009 .
many of the new buildings in the R@@ ī@@ ga are attacked as symbols for this development : one recogni@@ zes them on inserted slices or newly painted fac@@ ades that were disc@@ arded with dy@@ es .
&quot; &quot; &quot; no other road was mentioned this year together with the words &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; left autonomous violence &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
one reason why not all neigh@@ bors look at this as a problem could be that they are not necessarily affected by crime : crimes like body injury are almost exclusively directed against polic@@ emen .
most of the off@@ ences make damage to property , which tend to meet the new@@ buildings and newly renovated houses .
for K@@ erst@@ in Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who lives in a rented house for 17 years in addition to controversi@@ al 94 , uncertainty can be no talk of uncertainty .
as for acts of violence , it is more important : the people in the 94 are their neigh@@ bors , who are not sure .
also the famous com@@ bu@@ sti@@ ble cars are no longer in Riga anymore .
for the studied architect , her street is not a criminal focus , on the contrary : &quot; here one helps one another , lives together on the road and gets more from each other than elsewhere . &quot;
Neu@@ geb@@ auer is deliberately pulled into the Riga Road - and stayed .
that is why it was so important that the residents get their road back : from the police , politics and the media , which in July all of the sudden demanded the certainty of the city .
but in the eyes of residents such as Neu@@ geb@@ auer , the road continues to be taken away : by ob@@ tr@@ usive re@@ constructions in former mos@@ quit@@ oes that displ@@ ace the old inhabitants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these are actually con@@ domin@@ iums that are not interesting for many - here are rather people who are not so well @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I absolutely cannot gu@@ ise violence and destruction . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but what should we do if someone never list@@ ens to someone ?
there is fru@@ stration on all sides , even with the police and the inhabitants .
K@@ erst@@ in Neu@@ geb@@ auer has little understanding for zo@@ di@@ zed ri@@ pped over colour bom@@ bs : the skin projects and the left scene belonged to the Kie@@ z .
who pul@@ ls , should be aware of it - just like someone who pul@@ ls into a pub quarter that can compl@@ ain about noise .
all persons identified only with first names are asked to not be called with their correct name
Ur@@ bach : Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le is new Refu@@ ge@@ e Officer
Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le is the contact person for integration and organizer .
she is also a social worker on the spot .
Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le has been the Refu@@ ge@@ e Officer for Ur@@ bach since July .
the social ped@@ ago@@ gue supports the team of management by Achim Gro@@ cken@@ berger .
she sees himself as a contact partner for all actors : refugees , work@@ group refugee assistance , administration , authorities and who else .
Reg@@ ine customer from the working group indicates that the volunteers are more than grateful that Deu@@ sch@@ le is now there , the egg @-@ imposed vol@@ ition mil@@ de@@ w , which above all has a problem .
thus , some - less mo@@ cking than rather focused on the variety of tasks in question - meant when administration wanted to write the job .
looking for an administrative domain with a talent for languages and people , connected with a long @-@ standing experience in the field of social work , just an en@@ forced vol@@ ition of wool .
but administrative work is not their central area , writes Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le .
above all , it is about organization , work with local people and behind the scenes as well as network activity .
the 31 @-@ year @-@ old has been there for about six weeks .
it has limited a 50 percent position for three years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was high time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Reg@@ ine customer that Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le supports hon@@ orary and full @-@ time players . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are big and small problems , organizational , human and communication problems .
soon there are new containers in the Was@@ enstraße
it has been a serious problem for some time to find apartments for the connecting refugees that have been recognized .
the municipalities are responsible for the connection .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they need to accommodate the refugees in their own or hired premises . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the costs of construction , rent or refurb@@ ishment of these accommodation must bear the municipalities themselves .
the responsibility changes from the Land@@ rat@@ samt to Commun@@ e and Job@@ center .
problem : there are free objects , but not every landlord wants to offer his apartment .
the search has been very difficult for some time .
de fac@@ to does not find the administration of private apartments .
so far , it does not work , however , one relies on private apartments , so Deu@@ sch@@ le .
therefore , common flats must be visited as it is so beautiful .
so soon new containers will be set up in the Was@@ enstraße .
but only with dwell@@ ings it is not done .
perspective is the key@@ word , Reg@@ ine customers and Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le agree .
in addition to a permanent place of stay , there are intern@@ ships , training places , training places , one @-@ euro jobs and training activities for refugees and migrants who need to be und@@ one or set up .
&quot; more places would be good , &quot; reported Reg@@ ine customer .
many work in the building yard or help home@@ work , do char@@ itable work - and that motiv@@ ates and very neat as Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le reports .
she hopes that the work for the community will lead to a positive external effect .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no employment therapy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but activity does not mean only work .
the day needs a solid structure , say Deu@@ sch@@ le and customer .
people would have to develop a sense of belonging .
so it needs offers like sport , contacts with local people and especially language courses .
professional courses are rare .
so also , administration and volunteers are also jumping here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is central that the refugees get the feeling they are welcome and welcome in Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the long duration of the procedures is a problem .
they need to explain the refugees that it just takes and they can bridge the time wis@@ ely , for example with language courses .
whoever develops the feeling , he couldn &apos;t help anyone in Ur@@ bach , should not work and be un@@ profitable , he will never be able to integrate himself .
the clear majority is motivated .
but there are also problem cases , &quot; says customer hon@@ estly , &quot; people with whom nothing goes . &quot; therefore , the work of Deu@@ sch@@ le and customer is always to motiv@@ ate others .
&quot; &quot; &quot; all this is already a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mam@@ mot@@ h task &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a difficult question : do the two have fear of radic@@ alization , even in a small community like Ur@@ bach ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Reg@@ ine customer quite clearly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what some might call nai@@ ve &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the hel@@ pers are already sens@@ it@@ ised .
these inci@@ dents are also subject to refugees .
they would have the fear that the assass@@ inations brought them completely .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they want to show that they have nothing to do with it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Reg@@ ine customer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many would like to stay in Ur@@ bach .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so the local and local volunteers must look out for activities in the region and in the region . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they always have in the background that soon a new blow to refugees and migrants could come to Ur@@ bach .
does Germany need an upper limit ?
to answer this question clearly , politics sh@@ ou@@ ted .
actually , it is un@@ fair to place them hel@@ pers on site .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Ur@@ bach we have not arrived yet where we want to go , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le . &quot; &quot; &quot;
no new refugees , that would relax the situation .
Reg@@ ine customer also makes it clear that the Ur@@ bacher is already busy to integrate the existing people wis@@ ely .
these are currently around 100 people , mostly young men .
but when people are in need , they must help them , both women agree .
the political world situation is so complicated , there are no simple answers .
Sch@@ orn@@ dorf : Ein@@ brecher with helicop@@ ter wanted
the police helicop@@ ter fle@@ w different areas for about an hour - un@@ successful .
two unknown men are forced for@@ ci@@ bly into an apartment in a multi @-@ family house on Friday morning at 8.@@ 50 a.@@ m .
the inhabitants surprised the two and struck the in@@ roads in the escape .
the two men were about 1.@@ 65 to 1.70 metres in size , probably mas@@ king , wor@@ e both Blue@@ je@@ ans and black hoo@@ dies .
they fle@@ eing towards the city centre .
the police put a number of strikes as well as a police helicop@@ ter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the gro@@ unding went without success . &quot; &quot; &quot;
maybe the unknown were in fact near the apartment or at their escape .
