<seg id="2">His experiences on the horse are manageable.</seg>
<seg id="3">At the end of a golf tournament in South Africa, Bernhard Langer, with some colleagues, sought a little diversion with a ride on the beach.</seg>

<seg id="10">On Saturday Germany was the best golfer ever - 101 tournament victories - again near horses.</seg>
<seg id="11">He took his family over the site of the ALRV, on a horse he did not even get to photography.</seg>
<seg id="12">Long was the first time in Aachen and therewith also at CHIO.</seg>
<seg id="13">The reason was quite convincing.</seg>

<seg id="15">It does not lack the sympathetic sportsman.</seg>
<seg id="16">Bundesverdienstkreuz, Silbernes Lorbeerblatt, Champions-Tour-Player of the year...</seg>
<seg id="17">Even the British Queen already admired him.</seg>

<seg id="25">Many of these sports legends had come to Aachen on Saturday.</seg>

<seg id="9">"" "" "" "he will massively return regulations and he is strong for far-reaching tax reform with lower tax rates - for private people and for companies." ""</seg>
<seg id="10">Clinton says: the state has certain tasks to fulfill, it has disadvantaged opportunities to open up and needs money for it.</seg>
<seg id="11">That is why taxes for the rich would increase, they say.</seg>
<seg id="12">Interestingly, both are very close to the topic of infrastructure.</seg>
<seg id="13">In those that need to be invested, Trump and Clinton say almost verbally.</seg>
<seg id="14">The democratic candidate even announces the largest investment in new jobs since World War II.</seg>
<seg id="15">State investment programmes in infrastructure are classic democratic policies and are strictly rejected by the government-critical wing of the Republican Party.</seg>
<seg id="16">On Trump, there could still be partisan discussions.</seg>
<seg id="17">"" "" "" "the differences in energy and climate policy are more evident." ""</seg>

<seg id="21">"" "" "" "it will be either China, Germany or America - I want us to be." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="22">But not only in infrastructure - even in international trade agreements, the two competitors are not too far away from each other.</seg>
<seg id="23">TPP, the transpazific trade agreement, both do not want to sign.</seg>
<seg id="24">At the same time, both, however, do not want to isolate the US from international trade - but simply protect only American jobs.</seg>
<seg id="25">"" "" "" "they should also be paid better then calls for Clinton." ""</seg>
<seg id="26">The current minimum wage of USD 7.25 is a famine wage.</seg>
<seg id="27">She wants to raise her to 15 dollars per hour.</seg>
<seg id="28">What Trump wants to do in this matter is not quite clear: once he says, the minimum wage needs to go, then he says he should not be changed.</seg>
<seg id="29">But the great discussion of the coming months is likely to be more likely to develop the tax policy of the two camps.</seg>
<seg id="30">On the one hand stands Trump, who wants to relieve the economy and citizens in order to boost growth.</seg>
<seg id="31">His critics adhere to him, that the budget deficit would be even greater.</seg>
<seg id="32">On the other hand Clinton, who wants at least demand from the rich that they pay more taxes, and their critics say: more taxes are not the solution.</seg>

<seg id="1">Russia and Turkey: an "alliance of outsiders"?</seg>
<seg id="2">It was a gesture that ended a crisis.</seg>
<seg id="3">The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to give their hands and to proclaim an official end of the eight-month war of words and economic sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="4">But when Vladimir Putin has received his Turkish counterpart in the gilded hall of St. Petersburg Palace, I cannot repudiate the impression that Ankara wants this reconciliation most.</seg>
<seg id="5">There was the handshake, yes.</seg>
<seg id="6">But Putin's smile was smiling and he hardly radiated warmth, even for his restrained circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="7">Recep Tayyip Erdogan, on the other hand, spoke repeatedly about his "dear friend" Putin - according to a report all five times.</seg>
<seg id="8">I could not count it any more.</seg>
<seg id="9">He also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis, but will even improve.</seg>
<seg id="10">The next day, a newspaper described that Erdogan had heard that it would never have happened.</seg>
<seg id="11">To me his enthusiasm seemed more to indicate the opposite.</seg>
<seg id="12">But one of Putin's brilliant, sustainable coolness showed that Russia's head of state had nothing to forget.</seg>
<seg id="13">Rather, the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his introductory words: the shot of a Russian fighter plane at the Syrian border through Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="14">Moscow's reaction to the time was wasted.</seg>
<seg id="15">Putin shared and accused Ankara to have fallen into the back of Russia.</seg>
<seg id="16">The offence was even greater since it was committed by a supposed friend.</seg>
<seg id="17">To rebuild Vetropes becomes difficult, if not even impossible.</seg>
<seg id="18">The public opinion in Russia has changed since November.</seg>
<seg id="19">For months, the state-controlled media launched a violent, unrestricted attack on Ankara.</seg>
<seg id="20">At once it seemed as if the Turks would bear the blame for everything.</seg>
<seg id="21">Most serious were allegations of leading officials that Erdogan's own family would have benefited from illegal oil trade in areas of Syria, controlled by the so-called Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="22">He has denied this vehement.</seg>
<seg id="23">But in St. Petersburg, the official message was that it was time to look forward.</seg>
<seg id="24">Finally, this meeting took place only because Putin received the excuse of President Erdogan, which he wanted to hear.</seg>
<seg id="25">Russia was able to make a way of victory.</seg>
<seg id="26">For Ankara, the advantages of a ceasefire are obvious.</seg>
<seg id="27">Erdogan is primarily concerned with all the friends he can get after he was unveiled last month at a failed coup d'état of almost his ministry.</seg>
<seg id="28">Repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey have also shaken him.</seg>
<seg id="29">But there are also economic motives.</seg>
<seg id="30">Russian sanctions have hit Turkey hard - in particular the ban on charter flights, which usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast each year.</seg>
<seg id="31">The number is decreased by almost 90%.</seg>
<seg id="32">In Russia travel operators and charter companies will be relieved when the flights are resumed.</seg>
<seg id="33">They count on a late-season rush to the Mediterranean Sea.</seg>
<seg id="34">This week, the state television predicted billigerous fruits and vegetables as soon as Turkish agrarian imports are allowed again.</seg>
<seg id="35">A report in Vedemosti formulated it as follows: "tourists there long, tomatoes here long."</seg>
<seg id="36">But the visit had an additional political value for Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="37">Ankara is furious on the West, since it responds to the attempted coup of power as a weak response.</seg>
<seg id="38">To this end, the ongoing resentment about the snail emptying of EU accession negotiations and Putin - that is pike to benefit from the cool mood and to reduce the relationship of Turkey to the West.</seg>
<seg id="39">The Russian head of state won a bonus in Ankara that after the attempted coup d'état, he demanded support for the elected state organs.</seg>
<seg id="40">This is well-evident for Moscow, a matter of course, which itself has a deep-seated fear of regiment.</seg>
<seg id="41">The summit in this glamorous palace by the sea enabled Russia and Turkey to represent an analyst who once described me an "alliance of outsiders": two countries that violate the West and feel badly treated and are now allied.</seg>
<seg id="42">Nevertheless, despite the public reconciliation, there are still major differences between the two.</seg>
<seg id="43">The biggest difference is Syria, where Moscow has recently played the role as a peacemaker, but where Russia and Turkey support opposing sides.</seg>
<seg id="44">It could be significant that after almost three hours of first conversations, both the presidents at the press conference said they had not even stripped the issue.</seg>
<seg id="45">The President of Turkey forged to answer a question about their differences, while Putin decided to emphasise this.</seg>
<seg id="46">There is no clear consensus on what a common denominator can be found in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="47">But after months of open hostilities - and in view of the potential for a perfect disaster, when NATO member Turkey shot the Russian fighter jet - it is certainly better that the two heads of state speak at least once again.</seg>

<seg id="1">Russian Putin humid rod-head Sergei Ivanov</seg>
<seg id="2">Russian President Vladimir Putin recently dismissed his head of staff Sergei Ivanov.</seg>
<seg id="3">Ivanov was part of Putin's tightest confidence circle for many years.</seg>
<seg id="4">The 63-year-old was appointed Special Representative for Environmental and Transport Affairs.</seg>
<seg id="5">"" "in an opinion of the Kremlin, it reads that without giving reasons" "" "Ivanovs dismissed his duties as chairman of the Russian Presidential administration." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="6">Anton Vaino, who has been a deputy since 2012, was appointed to his successor.</seg>
<seg id="7">Vaino, 44, is a former diplomat.</seg>
<seg id="8">Born in Tallinn in 1972, he graduated from the renowned Moscow Institute for International Relations (MGIMO) and worked in Tokyo's embassy.</seg>
<seg id="9">On the website of the Kremlin it is called (in Russian) that he later became the chief manager and Chief of Staff of the Government Party.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "he said to Putin about his appointment:" "" "thank you for your confidence." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="11">"" "" "" "I think it is the most important task of the government to support your activity as head of state in terms of laws and controls to implement your instructions." ""</seg>
<seg id="12">Putin shared the Russian TV station on Friday that Ivanov was asked to leave his post and Vaino as his successor.</seg>
<seg id="13">Are the smiling faces?</seg>
<seg id="14">This step has been exposed to Moscow mystically.</seg>
<seg id="15">Sergei Ivanov has been one of Vladimir Putin's tightest confidants for a long time, as he works for the Soviet Intelligence Service, the KGB.</seg>
<seg id="16">As Chief of Staff, he was one of the most powerful men in the country.</seg>
<seg id="17">At a meeting with President Putin, which was broadcasted on television, both men claimed that the Chief of Staff resigns at his own request.</seg>
<seg id="18">But despite the smile for the cameras, few of them are convinced - especially now, just before the parliamentary elections.</seg>
<seg id="19">So here is the result of a kind of power struggle?</seg>
<seg id="20">That knows no one at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="21">But the official claim - that a man who once toured as a potential president at once would like to lead Russian environmental policy - came across great scepticism.</seg>
<seg id="22">In his remarks to Putin, quoted on the Kremlin's website, Ivanov said, "It is true that I asked you in a conversation at the beginning of 2012, to me this very complicated post - you could almost say - complainant posts for four years.</seg>
<seg id="23">As it turns out, I have been chairman of the Russian Presidential administration for four years and eight months.</seg>
<seg id="24">Ivanov took the position in December 2011.</seg>
<seg id="25">Previously he was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.</seg>
<seg id="26">He is a member of the Russian Security Council and as a former member of the State Security Service KGB.</seg>
<seg id="27">In the late 1990s, when Putin was chairman of the Federal Security Service (FSB) who replaced the KGB, Ivanov was appointed his deputy.</seg>
<seg id="28">When Putin came to power he called Ivanov as one of five people he trusted most.</seg>
<seg id="29">Once it was assumed that Ivanov could become president of Russia after Putin's second term, since a third term Putin had violated the constitution.</seg>
<seg id="30">But this post was taken by another, close allies of Putin, Dmitry Medvedev.</seg>
<seg id="31">Putin became Prime Minister before he became president three and a half years later.</seg>

<seg id="2">The £1,35 billion expensive project is to be completed by May 2017</seg>
<seg id="3">Engineers have connected the north deck of the Queensferry crossings with Viadukt - meaning that the bridge is now connected with fife.</seg>
<seg id="4">"" "it is the first of four closures of the" "" "deck blower" "", "which comes to completion for each of the three towers of the bridge." ""</seg>
<seg id="5">The bridge section of Fife is now 600 meters long and weighs 30,000 tons.</seg>
<seg id="6">It has more than 10,000 tonnes of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 spare parts.</seg>
<seg id="7">The £1,35 billion expensive project is to be completed by May 2017.</seg>
<seg id="8">Minister of Economy Keith Brown today visited the construction site and was one of the first to go from the country to the bridge.</seg>
<seg id="9">He said, "This is a historic and symbolic moment when building the Queensferry crossings.</seg>
<seg id="10">We are all witnesses of an engineering of a truly epic extent on this project with more than 30.000 tonnes of concrete and steel, which were used alone for this part of the bridge.</seg>
<seg id="11">Despite the massive size and weight of the bridge, the completion of the closure between the viaduct and the bridge deck is a delicate activity that requires extremely precise tolerances for the fit.</seg>
<seg id="12">In total, almost 79% of the entire bridge's ceiling is at its place and the last section of the deck today gets a concrete slack for the deck, meaning that the entire deck is ready to be lifted on the bridge to its place.</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "Michael Martin, Project Manager of Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors said:" "" "the first conclusion is a significant milestone in each bridge project." ""</seg>
<seg id="14">This fantastic project represents the conclusion of forward-looking high and civil engineering.</seg>
<seg id="15">After the installation of the last section of the road and its connection with the northern tower on the north, we had to close the existing gap in the north or south side.</seg>
<seg id="16">This was reached by pulling the northern feeder bridge 700 millimeters south.</seg>
<seg id="17">This was a massive and at the same time very delicate activity.</seg>
<seg id="18">Massive, since the Viaduct is 222 metres long, weighs about 6,000 tons and had to be pulled upwards on an incline of approx. 3%.</seg>

<seg id="5">But strife is programmed.</seg>
<seg id="6">First and foremost, it is about the question: who should build the favourable apartments?</seg>
<seg id="7">A regulation is missing so far.</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "SPD leader Christoph Bratmann comments:" "" "we agree with the Greens: whoever wants to build on urban areas must show 20 percent of all apartments as social housing in the future." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="11">"" "" "" "we want investors to build at least 10 percent on such surfaces, but build as 20 percent of the apartments as social housing." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="13">"" "the problem," "" "Bratmann:" "" "there is currently no agreement between the parliamentary groups." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="14">The CDU would like to make investors as few regulations as possible.</seg>
<seg id="15">The left wants even harder editions for investors.</seg>
<seg id="16">Regardless of the so-called Bratmann, there is a tightening of the situation in the housing market.</seg>
<seg id="17">If the concept of action is implemented, this will take care of additional tasks in the building administration.</seg>
<seg id="18">More staff is needed.</seg>
<seg id="19">It is unclear whether we will get the skilled workers.</seg>
<seg id="20">But the program does not yet fully stand out: the approximately 1260 new apartments, which should be built anyway.</seg>
<seg id="21">But how does one compare the loss of other around 1300 favourable apartments, whose funding will be run over the next few years?</seg>

<seg id="25">This is possible in the western town.</seg>
<seg id="26">In one stroke the problem could be solved.</seg>
<seg id="27">Because in the western city the year-end deadlines run out.</seg>
<seg id="28">Around 1800 apartments could be brought back to the price binding for cheap apartments.</seg>

<seg id="1">Pokémon Go, a hunt for health and happiness that is worth it</seg>
<seg id="2">It is fascinating to watch how the world changes.</seg>
<seg id="3">The fact that teenagers and children do not go outside for playing, but rather prefer to spend their leisure time on screens, have been complained by many in the last decade.</seg>
<seg id="4">Pokemon Go is about getting people from the sofa and becoming more active.</seg>
<seg id="5">The time on the screen was initially limited to the TV, then on video games and finally limited to smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="6">Therefore it is great to see that technology and outdoor activities are not mutually exclusive.</seg>
<seg id="7">Of course I refer to the Pokémon Go-Wahn, an app based on the characters that were initially created for videogames in the 1990ies (later a cartoon series, playing cards and other spin-offs) were created.</seg>
<seg id="8">How many pop culture phenomena decreased interest in the publication of the game in the US, Australia and New Zealand in early July.</seg>
<seg id="9">Market launch in other countries was shifted by the massive demand that the server overlapped.</seg>
<seg id="10">Within a few days, Pokémon Go had more users than ink and almost as many as Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="11">How does it work?</seg>
<seg id="12">In short, players go outside with their smartphones and search for Pokémons who can be tracked with a GPS and once they were found, "photographed" (over a screenshot on the phone) or "captured."</seg>
<seg id="13">A generation that played the game when she was younger, joined the tap and jumped for the search of the sofa.</seg>
<seg id="14">In the United States, the game led to a sizable increase in steps the "average" person puts back every day.</seg>
<seg id="15">Cardiogram, an app for Apple Watch, pursuing 35,000 users, the Washington Post recently reported that within two days after the launch of the game, the number of persecuted people who exercise every day 30 minutes, jumped from 45 percent to 53 percent.</seg>
<seg id="16">The company doesn't know who plays Pokémon Go - it just looks the raw data for improving performance.</seg>
<seg id="17">"" "many public awareness campaigns for health that want to bring people to" "" "take 30 minutes" "" "to" "" "come from the sofa" "" "and" "" "to be active every day" "", "because many public messages are bored to health and come from people who feel miserable." ""</seg>
<seg id="18">Nevertheless, the importance of sport cannot be overrated.</seg>
<seg id="19">Anyone who drives sports regularly reduces its chances of developing cancer or depression.</seg>
<seg id="20">Physical activity helps in weight control, high blood pressure, diabetes and a long list of benefits that is too long to lead them here.</seg>
<seg id="21">But the wonderful thing about Pokémon Go is that it brings people to do something outdoors that makes them fun.</seg>
<seg id="22">Three pillars of health are covered - exercise, fresh air and sunshine as well as fun.</seg>
<seg id="23">Some people even join new friendships on the hunt.</seg>
<seg id="24">As always there are also mürrical playmates who always have to complain about something.</seg>
<seg id="25">And yes, someone could go against a door.</seg>
<seg id="26">What is it?</seg>
<seg id="27">There is a breakthrough.</seg>
<seg id="28">Even if smartphone apps like Fitbit were already pursuing our activity earlier, they gave us no reason to play sports as this game does.</seg>
<seg id="29">The new will lose its charm and the use will be refunded with time.</seg>
<seg id="30">However, due to Pokemon's success, there will be more games that will combine apps and virtual reality with the active in the real world and help many people on the hunt, more active, fitter and healthier.</seg>

<seg id="10">The 19-year-old American gymnast erklomm on Thursday for the title title and magnified the gap between himself and the rest of the world in front of all eyes under the spotlight of the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="11">Her total result of 62,198 was clearly before the silver medallists and "Final Five" -team ameradin Aly Raisman and the Russian bronze medal Aliya Mustafina.</seg>
<seg id="12">The American women Simone Biles turnt on the floating beam during the single multi-campaign of women at the Olympic Summer Games in Rio de Janeiro 2016, Brazil, Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="13">Biles is the fourth heterosexual American who wins a multi-ranged title and a total of the fifth, while she consolidates her reputation to be the best of her generation or even at all.</seg>
<seg id="14">She burst into tears when her end result was shown and her long journey at this moment found an end.</seg>
<seg id="15">This success puts them in the same league as unique athletes like Michael Phelps, who brought their sports to new heights:</seg>
<seg id="16">Biles has dominated the sport for the last three years - including 10 gold medals - including 10 gold medals - with so amazing exercises that include a mixture of ambition and precision that the Olympics from 1984 Mary Lou Retton from her said that she is "the best gymnast I've ever seen."</seg>
<seg id="17">It was expected to be a final exam in Brazil, a competition not so much between Biles and the rest of the athletes, but rather between her and a burden of oversized expectations.</seg>
<seg id="18">Not returning with a handful of gold back to the family in Spring, Texas, would be considered disappointment.</seg>

<seg id="21">Although Biles insisted on having never planned the future, it is not really true.</seg>

<seg id="23">This is not a coincidence.</seg>
<seg id="24">This girl, adopted by her grandparents as a small child and was discovered by trainer Aimee Boorman's mother during a school excursion into the gym, trained in Boorman, became vigorous.</seg>
<seg id="25">Since the summer of 2013, she has no longer lost a competition competition, a winning series, which will last as long as it wishes.</seg>
<seg id="26">Even though Mustafina was slightly led by two turns, the picture stimulated.</seg>
<seg id="27">Schwebebelken and Bodies - in which Biles holds the world title - lauded.</seg>
<seg id="28">She got up again with 15,433 on the Schwebeforks - and with a 15,933 on the ground she was still on top of it.</seg>
<seg id="29">Raisman gently embraced her as she expected her Endergbnis - a pure formality - and tears streamed on Biles shiny red, white and blue eyeliner, as the vision she once described in her collective book became reality.</seg>
<seg id="30">The performance Raismans was a revenge for the last time four years ago when she fought for the third place, but the bronze medal went to Mustafina in a Tiebrake.</seg>
<seg id="31">This time, the 22-year-old female company, called Oma, "had a lead.</seg>
<seg id="32">After her ground, she threw the audience to the audience, overwhelmed by a comeback, which sometimes seemed doubtful.</seg>

<seg id="1">Why we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie</seg>
<seg id="2">That is what I present under the Women's Olympics in the Turning and that is for more than one reason.</seg>
<seg id="3">First, I have been at every summer Olympics since 1984 and the US has never been so dominant.</seg>
<seg id="4">And secondly: this team has three gymnasts, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren "Laurie" Hernandez, who were inspiring for many young girls of other skin colours.</seg>
<seg id="5">The structure of this team, the Aly Raisman, the Jüdin is and Madison Kocian, who is Catholicine, makes everyone proud.</seg>
<seg id="6">This team is finally reflected in the US.</seg>
<seg id="7">It has solidified the black and Hispanic female presence at the top of this sport.</seg>
<seg id="8">In the last four years the number one among female gymnastics was an Afro-American.</seg>
<seg id="9">Last year Simone and Gabby # 1 and # 2 were.</seg>
<seg id="10">This shows strength.</seg>
<seg id="11">During the last Olympic Games, Gabby Douglas was a surprising Olympiahwinner and America cheered.</seg>
<seg id="12">Now the world was able to witness the incredible performance of the triple world championships Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, how they were unexpected, but masterful gyros routines.</seg>
<seg id="13">On Thursday Simone was the fourth, heterosexual American, who won gold at an individual event for women.</seg>
<seg id="14">Team member Aly Raisman won silver.</seg>
<seg id="15">We experience the top of this sport, but we do not see gymnasium classes all over the country.</seg>
<seg id="16">Simone, Gabby and Laurie beat all the same way as Aly and Madison to create it into the Olympic team.</seg>
<seg id="17">"" "they are the" "" "Last Five" "", "because the next Olympic team will only have four gymnasts in the team. furthermore, this is the last year with Marta Karolyi as a trainer." ""</seg>
<seg id="18">But the reality looks like gymnasts are a more expensive sport and gymnasts are primarily in private sports clubs, which are maintained by parents who pay for training, orientation, travel clothing, competition and hotel costs (for the trainers and their gymnasts and families).</seg>
<seg id="19">The majority of these gymnastics lie in wealthy suburbs that can support the business.</seg>
<seg id="20">In these clubs, the gymnasts get their complete training and this is an expensive and long-term commitment to the families.</seg>
<seg id="21">Aimee Boorman, trainer of Simone Biles, and Maggie Haney, trainer of Laurie Hernandez, have trained their athletes since they started with the gymnasium.</seg>
<seg id="22">We need to aun the churches aun innumerable, young girls, who are inspired by Simone, Gabby and Laurie, an affordable and easily accessible gymnasium.</seg>
<seg id="23">I founded my TRG of 20 years.</seg>
<seg id="24">During my events, we have offered free and affordable gymnasts in Harlem for more than 15,000 urban juniors (especially black and hispanic) and national and international winners.</seg>
<seg id="25">In September we will expand to Detroit (my hometown) to offer youth high-quality gymnastics offering the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport.</seg>
<seg id="26">Gymnastics develops strength, flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work, discipline and determination for the mind.</seg>
<seg id="27">This combination offers life-long benefits for health as well as for academic and professional success.</seg>
<seg id="28">It is the inspiration of this team that brings thousands of young girls to be interested in the gymnastics and that's great.</seg>
<seg id="29">It is so important to participate in sports, especially for girls.</seg>
<seg id="30">This is such an exciting time.</seg>
<seg id="31">Thanks Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for this real representation of "Girl Power" by the Holen des Olympic team-golds and thank you, you motivated so many young girls with different backgrounds to start their way to become healthy, strong and successful young women.</seg>

<seg id="7">Every year around 140,000 people suffer a heart attack and a quarter of it suffer a further heart attack or stroke.</seg>
<seg id="8">Heart attacks and strokes are caused by accumulations of fatty material in the arterial walls that form floorings.</seg>

<seg id="12">Ticagrelor, which is produced by the British company AstraZeneca and is marketed under the trade name Brilique, reduces this risk by making the formation of blood clots more likely.</seg>
<seg id="13">The release of NICE, which was published today, recommends a 12-month intake of 90mg Ticagrelor, followed by 60mg with a twice daily intake of aspirin for the next three years.</seg>
<seg id="14">Professor Carole Longson, Director of the NICE health technology evaluation centre said: "despite the availability of secondary prevention, a quarter of all individuals who have suffered a heart attack or stroke - often have disastrous consequences."</seg>

<seg id="16">The experience shows that Ticagrelor is effective in combination with aspirin effectively in reducing further heart attacks and strokes in people who already had a heart attack.</seg>

<seg id="2">The world outside is a dangerous place, but this video from Dailymail.com could make him safer for you.</seg>
<seg id="3">We spoke with Rhone Mizrachi, a Grandmaster of Krav Maga Verbandes in New York to find out how to deal with armed robbers at close distance.</seg>
<seg id="4">Regardless of whether you approach you from the front or from behind, this video will show you how to turn the skewer for your robber.</seg>
<seg id="5">When you approach you from behind, you should turn around as first, so that you can see your attacker and "go out of the shot line," says Mizrachi.</seg>
<seg id="6">Grab the weapon between your forearm and shoulder before you face it with your free elbow.</seg>
<seg id="7">Hit him with the knee in the bar and twist, while the attacker is curvy of pain, the gun comes out of his hands. hit him with the run into the face and move backwards as she directs the weapon to him.</seg>
<seg id="8">When attackers approaching from the front, the technique is similar - move your body out of the shot line, grab the weapon and twist it so that the attacker cannot shoot.</seg>
<seg id="9">At the same time, shift the weight onto the weapon and hit the attacker onto the chest, then turn the weapon out of its grip before moving backwards and put the weapon on it.</seg>
<seg id="10">Sounds difficult?</seg>

<seg id="2">A British traveller underwent his immune system and worms of a serious test by leaking some of the dirtiest and most detest places in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="3">The moderator and travel author Ian Wright, 51, from Suffolk cut off his course on a Euro-Schein, a railing at Piccadilly Circus, a rinsing knob of a train toilet and a public telephone in Russia to demonstrate the resistance of his immune system.</seg>
<seg id="4">In front of the leakage of each object he used a Luminometer to show himself and us on what he is going to get involved.</seg>
<seg id="5">"" "but the experiment that was filmed under the title" "" "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength" "" "brought some surprising results to the daylight." ""</seg>
<seg id="6">The thought of leaching the rinsing knob of a traction toilet, which has already been used by thousands of others, may be completely repulsive, but in fact there are more bad bacteria in a kitchen sink.</seg>
<seg id="7">On his journey through Europe, Mr. Wright spoke to doctors and healthcare professionals about the promotion of intestinal bacteria as well as their own health.</seg>
<seg id="8">Fortunately, nothing left what he licked, more than a bad aftertaste in the mouth.</seg>
<seg id="9">Mr. Wright was known to test the robustness of his bowel by travelling through the world and ate peculiar and wonderful things.</seg>
<seg id="10">From public railings to train stations to sinks of toilets, the task put its immune system definitively under one sample</seg>
<seg id="11">"" "in the movie he told:" "" "already as a child I was relatively unconcerned about what my health concerns and I have put all sorts of things in my mouth, earth, worms and mud water." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="12">In the film, he was able to do justice to his reputation.</seg>
<seg id="13">The only thing he refused was a dirty public toilet in Russia.</seg>
<seg id="14">Its test layer showed a luminance of more than 4000 units.</seg>
<seg id="15">Compared to this, the Luminometer-number of newly washed hands is less than 60.</seg>
<seg id="16">But there was a Russian toilet that he refused to lick off after their luminance was over 4000 units, while freshly washed hands have one of less than 60.</seg>
<seg id="17">"" "Mr Wright and Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Valio produced the travel film" "" "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength" "", "which shows the number of bacteria in different places like the bathroom." ""</seg>
<seg id="18">"" "in the film he says," "" "It comes close to the worst that I have cleaned in a toilet." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="19">There is nothing more dirt than that!</seg>
<seg id="20">I will not dock here, because it is indelibly eclectic here.</seg>
<seg id="21">"the Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength" was produced in cooperation with the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Valio.</seg>
<seg id="22">The company equips Mr. Wright with Valio Gefilus, which includes lactic acid bacteria and vitamin C and D to support intestinal bacteria and immune system.</seg>
<seg id="23">Valios Senior Venice President for snacks, juices and new categories Niko Vuormaa says: "we wanted to offer consumers something new.</seg>
<seg id="24">Something that is fascinating to look at and at the same time explains the advantages of probiotics.</seg>
<seg id="25">We performed crazy Brainstormings that ended up saying that we told "Lass us Ian."</seg>
<seg id="26">They claim that the interest in gut health becomes a global phenomenon</seg>
<seg id="27">Instead of talking about the products we wanted to put them into a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday surroundings, the importance of gut health and how it is linked to the immune system.</seg>
<seg id="28">The growing interest in gut health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary, we were able to provide consumers with more information in an interesting way.</seg>
<seg id="29">I also think the film shows that we have a great sense of humour!</seg>
<seg id="30">Tom Hakala, who led the film director, added: "let me say so - I would have lost my respect for Ian if he had awakened some of the things I had instructed him, just like the eclectic Russian toilet that is shown in the film."</seg>
<seg id="31">Of course there were things in which it was easier to put Ian to leak them and others in which this was quite difficult.</seg>
<seg id="32">"" "I'm glad we recorded some of these dirty goodies on film." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="33">In a survey conducted by Valio in 2015 84 percent of all asked lactic acid bacteria associated with the well-being of the stomach and intestines and 58 percent said that at least occasionally they use products containing added lactic acid bacteria.</seg>

<seg id="2">An asozial family left her social housing after a delogierung with a damage of £50,000 because she had terrorized her neighbors.</seg>
<seg id="3">Tanya Skeldon and her partner Shaun Trebilcock were thrown after a long list of complaints from their property in Saltash, Cornwall.</seg>
<seg id="4">After they were aborted by force from their property, the housing association found the property in an irreparable condition.</seg>
<seg id="5">The walls pointed arround holes, wooden planks were torn, rubbish was scattered on the floor and graffiti was lubricated to the walls.</seg>
<seg id="6">The family have been moved and it is assumed that she now lives in a private accommodation</seg>
<seg id="7">Donna McEvoy, who works for the management of Cornwall Housing, said that she was afraid that the apartment was no longer repaired.</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "she said," "" "It was a nightmare for the people here and I think people don't have to live in this way." ""</seg>
<seg id="9">There are many things to consider since this estate is probably considered not as beautiful as Cornwall.</seg>
<seg id="10">The family is notorious and their reputation is also.</seg>
<seg id="11">The couple had three sons, who meanwhile lived in the apartment and the police said that the terror that the family had added, street fights with baseball bats, intimidation of residents, drug abuse, drug trafficking and excessive screaming, spreading and fluchen.</seg>
<seg id="12">In June, Skeldon, 47, whose name was on the lease, had an arrangement for antisocial behaviour in June.</seg>
<seg id="13">In some rooms of the house, which will be demolished under certain circumstances, old rubbish was found</seg>
<seg id="14">In the estate, in which drugs were traded in the past, the wooden planks were torn down</seg>
<seg id="15">Neighbours said they had to fight them on the streets and regularly invoked the police.</seg>
<seg id="16">Cornwall Housing coined her and her partner this week forcibly from the property after having given them an extended period of 11 weeks to volunteer.</seg>
<seg id="17">The Delogierung were cheered by facilitated neighbors who said that their life was made to hell.</seg>
<seg id="18">"" "one said," "" "They don't care for anyone." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="24">Adam Fitzpatrick, Neighbourhood Enforcement Manager of Cornwall Housing, said that it had been administered by the family with local authorities.</seg>
<seg id="25">The family lived in the house where the police were called at regular intervals, for 20 years</seg>
<seg id="26">Garbage and old toys were thrown down on the overgrown side of the community.</seg>
<seg id="27">"" "he added:" "" "it is a shame that the tenant sows to accept any responsibility for their behaviour and family as a delogiance is always the last step of taking account of the Cornwall Housing." ""</seg>
<seg id="28">This was a very difficult case, because the behavior was extreme and their deeds had to be looked horribly for their neighbors.</seg>
<seg id="29">I appreciate all the work my team, the police of Devon and Cornwall, as well as members of the community that have courageously moved to us and gave us the information.</seg>
<seg id="30">I hope this development will give comfort to some neighbors and the message conveys that antisocial behaviour will not be tolerated.</seg>
<seg id="31">Fitzpatrick said that all three sons had lived at different times in the house, but that they were all over 20.</seg>

<seg id="33">Workers of the house administration will now have to dig rubbish mountains surrounding the house</seg>
<seg id="34">In 2014, the police launched a raid on the house and found more than 70g cannabis as well as scales, parapheritalia and cash in the amount of £1,700.</seg>
<seg id="35">Skeldon was given a fine of money after having found guilty of the possession of a class B drug in trade-confidence.</seg>

<seg id="37">After they were without shelter, Tanya and her partner are now living in a private accommodation in Plymouth.</seg>
<seg id="38">Many rooms of the house were decorated with graffiti.</seg>
<seg id="39">The police said they will donate tenants who do not stick to the house rules</seg>

<seg id="7">This was reported to the team leadership of Kenya by the doping controllers.</seg>
<seg id="8">The IAAF World Association has asked the IOC for information on the case to exert their own investigations, sharing an IAAF spokesman.</seg>
<seg id="9">"" "" "" "depending on the results of the study and the following actions of the IOC the IAAF will make an assessment," "" "said it in an IAAF declaration." ""</seg>

<seg id="37">GÖHNER knows from other counties, where so much more generous was handled.</seg>

<seg id="1">Destination plates: who actually buys records?</seg>
<seg id="2">Lonely men middle aged love plates.</seg>
<seg id="3">Before you move to the comment section, to see him under the pseudonym of non-ssamenmen's age with rough insults, this statement is derived from current data.</seg>
<seg id="4">According to YouGov, the complex reformation of records is not due to a boom in Millennials, which want to greet the newness of physical objects, but to midlife nostalgia.</seg>
<seg id="5">Those who have recently bought a record are all foresight at the age between 45 and 54.</seg>
<seg id="6">In fact, the age group of 18-24 is the most improbable buyer group.</seg>
<seg id="7">There is also no hordes by hobby collectors - it has an emotional impact: older record buyers are keeping their feelings more likely (56% vs. 53%) and enjoy it alone time (69% vs. 66%).</seg>
<seg id="8">But do the results of YouGov agree?</seg>
<seg id="9">If this blog were a news report on TV, the camera would follow me while I run in the middle of a busy street in Soho, a modest gray suit and wildly gesture before I stop, keep my hands and something determinant like this: "so, let's take a closer look at it."</seg>
<seg id="10">So let's take a look at it.</seg>
<seg id="11">Even though the heart of Soho slowly stands in its charm - hotels, restaurants and offices now fill the buildings in which once independent sellers were resident - there is still a handful of fantastic plate specialized shops.</seg>
<seg id="12">I would probably ask the cameraman to turn off the camera for the next part in which I stand in close proximity to various men in such businesses and try to assess their age and mind by observing.</seg>
<seg id="13">Stuart from Glasgow, 55, which I of Sister Ray (number of data: two young women, three men middle aged) into Reckless Records (number of data: eight men middle age, a woman, probably around the 20), is a day long because of a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the few hours.</seg>
<seg id="14">Is he a collector, I ask?</seg>
<seg id="15">"I guess already," he says.</seg>
<seg id="16">I have about 3,000 or 4,000 plates.</seg>
<seg id="17">These records, shown above (he sent me the snapshot by email, I did not follow him home), dress the walls of his living room.</seg>
<seg id="18">The reason why he has such a considerable number of albums and singles is the result of his available income: he is now able to buy records he could not afford as they appeared and re-bought items he sold when he was young and pleite.</seg>
<seg id="19">"" "" "" "many things I buy are from the late 60s, early 70s, who appeared when I was 11 or 12. things I thought was too young to buy them," "" "he says." ""</seg>
<seg id="20">He agrees that those who buy records are more introverted and would like to spend time alone, and adds: "I don't smoke and I don't drink very much.</seg>
<seg id="21">This is my disaster.</seg>
<seg id="22">WEZ, 25, who works at Sister Ray, also believes that many customers that he meets on YouGov profile.</seg>
<seg id="23">But he also noticed a new wave of folks who are influenced by the media, people who have heard about the comeback, causing them to buy their old records again.</seg>
<seg id="24">From the conversations I have conducted, people are usually emptied with their collection in the same way around 1998 or 1999.</seg>
<seg id="25">Customers who once sold their records to buy CDs now sell their CDs to buy their records, "he says.</seg>
<seg id="26">This would explain the boom to followers of a specific age.</seg>
<seg id="27">But what about the alleged emotional importance of plates?</seg>
<seg id="28">It takes only a few seconds in a business like Phonica, to realize that record shops offer a soothing community of like-minded people.</seg>
<seg id="29">According to the WEZ some of the older customers stumbled on the contactless payment system.</seg>
<seg id="30">Some of the board fans feel overwhelmed by the digital world and want to pull back to the stability of familiar soundboards, from objects that awake happy Jugenderinnerungen.</seg>
<seg id="31">"" "" "" "I think sometimes it can be the filling of a void or possession of material possessions as a kind of comfort," "" "says WEZ." ""</seg>
<seg id="32">That's the case with me as a collector so and I think it is so with many people.</seg>
<seg id="33">It is a simple way to get involved spiritually.</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "" "" "we are like their social workers!" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="35">A survey by ICM in April revealed that almost 50% of people who bought a record last month have not yet listened to.</seg>
<seg id="36">The survey also found that 41% have a turntable that they never use, while 7% of those who buy a plate do not have turntables.</seg>
<seg id="37">At this time of the news report I would probably look very concerned, while I blätted through a pile of bossa nova compilations.</seg>
<seg id="38">Jonny, 42, who works with Sounds of the Universe (number of data: three men middle age) has noticed a "trophy of the revival."</seg>
<seg id="39">"" "" "" "someone only recently came here and said," "" "I don't own a record player, but I would like to buy a radiohead bells record so I can put them on the shelf" "", "he says." ""</seg>
<seg id="40">This is not a big percentage, but it definitely happens.</seg>
<seg id="41">More productive, less musicastic.</seg>
<seg id="42">"" "we have people who say:" "" "I don't have a turntable." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="43">These are younger people, not older ones, who only slowly enter.</seg>
<seg id="44">Opp, which has devoted to the sound records almost a whole floor, has a lower audience than I go.</seg>
<seg id="45">There are couples around the 70, tourists who make photos, teenagers and middle aged women.</seg>
<seg id="46">Even if the atmosphere is slightly less relaxed than in the aforementioned shops - wild Beasts latest Synthesizer- and sexist-packed pop instead of experimental jazz pampered from the speakers - it is good to see such diversity among the customers.</seg>
<seg id="47">None of them looks strange, but nagging psychic traumas are hard to determine if you stand next to somebody 30 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="48">Elanora, 27, has been in business for a few minutes and looks at the variety of boards sold for sale.</seg>
<seg id="49">It rather makes a window bumble rather than a big shopping.</seg>
<seg id="50">It does not deserve much, therefore collecting sheets is not a real option, says it.</seg>
<seg id="51">It costs a lot.</seg>
<seg id="52">It's easy to listen to music from a computer or another way, but the beauty of records is... "she drives away with a loving sighter.</seg>
<seg id="53">I don't know how to explain it - it's really unique.</seg>
<seg id="54">My last stop is a business that is said to have inspired a new generation of record lovers: urban Outfitters.</seg>
<seg id="55">While I release the jeans-pants, I watch a group of young teenage girls grouping for a moment to group Polaroid cameras before a father and his daughter are thinking about buying a Crosley turntable.</seg>
<seg id="56">On the left there is a staircase, a wall full of records by Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mixture of contemporary music and classics, the essential plates for an average collection.</seg>
<seg id="57">No one sees them - perhaps because they are purely decorative, some as far above that it is impossible to touch them.</seg>
<seg id="58">"" "it is pure" "" "plate art." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="59">But considering that every attraction for these items would mean more money for the industry and could send some customers into the depths of Soho for more, there is nothing to complain.</seg>
<seg id="60">It is no surprise that a population group that has more time and money than others, is also the one that is most suitable for luxury items such as plates.</seg>
<seg id="61">Even though my research has revealed that the results of YouGov agree, they leave them, at least in record stores in Soho, the large number of female collectors, which exist in reality, record stores and online forums.</seg>
<seg id="62">These people probably work hard at school or in offices.</seg>
<seg id="63">They spend their Thursday morning with security not with the bumble through plate shops of Berwick Street and the leaves through plates while they avoid the starving view of an uncanny, 30-year-old false moderator, who rises above the shoulders nothing reminiscent of middle aged.</seg>

<seg id="2">A French court rejected an offer of the authorities in Calais, dozens of provisional shops and restaurants in the jungle of Calais, where thousands of refugees live.</seg>
<seg id="3">During a trial this week the authorities argued in Calais that the state should be authorised to sell 72 provisional transactions in which persons within the camp sell goods, from cigarettes to Energydrinks, sell, hairdressing services or sell tea for 50 cents (40 pence) or simple meals for a few euros in temporary restaurants.</seg>
<seg id="4">The prefecture of Calais argued that these places were to be ripped down because they would represent a parallel economy from which no taxes would be paid and which contain a fire and security risk.</seg>
<seg id="5">Humanitarian groups shared the court that the shops and restaurants are important, as the free meals offered by the state-supported association and other groups would not provide enough food for the growing numbers in the camp.</seg>
<seg id="6">They also stated that the provisional shops and restaurants often offer accommodation and free meals for people in need.</seg>
<seg id="7">"" "a court in Lille decided that there would be no legal basis for the expulsion of people who run the 72 temporary businesses, but admitted that the concerns of the prefecture of Calais" "" "are absolutely understandable." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="9">He said that the areas offer quiet meeting points between refugees and volunteers.</seg>
<seg id="10">One of the places threatened by the ravine was the Jungle Book Kids' Café des Lagers, which is operated in non-profit and 200 meals a day, English and French classes as well as advice on asylum cases for the hundreds of vulnerable unaccompanied minors in the camp.</seg>
<seg id="11">More than 170,000 people have signed petition to preserve the Kids' Café.</seg>

<seg id="2">The impressive performance of Britain at the 7-inch rugby came to an abrupt halt at the last hurdle in the form of Fijis when they were hit here in Rio with a result of 43-7 at the Deodoro Stadium.</seg>
<seg id="3">Fiji gained a master class in handling, side-stepping, press-back, line run and rust power to win gold - its first Olympic medal of any color.</seg>
<seg id="4">The defeat was lost due to the not too bad consolation of the Silver medal - Britain's fourth on that day - and they could be proud of their efforts in this tournament in which they struck New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.</seg>
<seg id="5">The clear defeat of the Boks, 7-5 in the semi-finals on the same day could fall on it in the final.</seg>
<seg id="6">But regardless of that, Fiji could have hit a 15-man-team in this form.</seg>
<seg id="7">It could be a comfort for the UK - but it will probably not - that at least a Briton tomorrow will have a gold medal around his neck: Fijis chief trainer Ben Ryan, the former boss for England from Wimbledon.</seg>
<seg id="8">GB had a difficult path.</seg>
<seg id="9">Eight years ago, she lost every game at the Adelaide Sevens.</seg>
<seg id="10">Here they only lose one.</seg>
<seg id="11">This hatch will hurt, but progress is amazing.</seg>
<seg id="12">Fiji began to marvel and let the attacks of GBs run out of fun.</seg>
<seg id="13">It felt for Captain Tom Mitchell and Co., as if one was running in driving buses. the World Series Winner went 5-0 upwards, when Osea Kolinisau was overcrowded in the corner.</seg>
<seg id="14">With four minutes of playing, Jerry Tuwai added another attack from the right corner he turned around.</seg>
<seg id="15">12-0 and GB barely touched the ball.</seg>
<seg id="16">An evorraging Tackle of Mitchell stopped the mountain of man Leone Nakarawa a third goal, but it only stopped by Fiji.</seg>
<seg id="17">In the seventh minute, jasa Vernalua lete a touch down in the right corner and it was 0-17 for GB.</seg>
<seg id="18">Nakarawa added a new since the restart and there was still over a minute playing time... in the first half.</seg>
<seg id="19">Vatemo Ravouvou preached by further weak Tacklings of the GB teams and crashed up to the line to make a gate.</seg>
<seg id="20">The conversion brought a 29-0 to a break.</seg>
<seg id="21">It's like Fiji was born to play the 7, while GB still learns.</seg>
<seg id="22">This is how it is.</seg>
<seg id="23">GB introduced fundamental changes to half-time and closed the fiasco-gap... for all four minutes, which was good for the conditions of the first half-time until Joshua Tuisova ran through a brilliant interplay of Fiji.</seg>
<seg id="24">Dan Norton started an attempt for GB, made a touchdown in the left corner for a 36-7, but the game ran long in favor of the South African-Sullians, whose fans sang, flags swapped and danced on the grandstand.</seg>
<seg id="25">It was not difficult to admire the playful approach to Fijis.</seg>
<seg id="26">Mata Viliens put the i-dot with another try in the last few seconds.</seg>
<seg id="27">The Pfiff sounded, the Fijis hugged and GB kicked crushed out in the lawn.</seg>
<seg id="28">Earlier on the day Fiji Japan defeated Japan in the semifinals with 20-5 and Britain pushed South Africa in a tight half-finalMatch from the race - Britain's conversion of difference.</seg>
<seg id="29">Kyle Brown brought the Boks in the first half to the front, but Dan Norton broke the line with an impressive footwork and scored a gate among the posts in the second half.</seg>
<seg id="30">A brilliant, late Tackling of Marcus Watson, the brother of Anthony of the English 15-side team, secured the profit - and thus the silver medal.</seg>

<seg id="2">There will be no more emoting gold than with these games and that wants to be hot.</seg>
<seg id="3">From the first rudder to the last, 220 hard forks that go into history, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found an additional meaning in their golden moment at the Estacio de Lagoa.</seg>
<seg id="4">Even if there were only the ones who sat on the helm, there were three voices in the boat. the Echo of the Trainers Robin Williams, was all present when they ruined the second Olympic age in the two without tax-wife in a row, the first women in the history of the British Sports, who put such a benchmark.</seg>
<seg id="5">Their dominance was absolutely, at least their 39.3 unvarnished use, which is also unparalleled.</seg>
<seg id="6">What we see are two brilliant athletes who glide across the surface with the elegance of swans, which does not reflect the nature of triumph.</seg>
<seg id="7">Behind every gold in rowing is a battalion of wild helpers who make a difference to the incremental progress that make the difference and there was no one who knew the difference 30 months ago, whether he would survive this day at all when diagnosed with cancer.</seg>
<seg id="8">As he said he was risky.</seg>
<seg id="9">I had bladder cancer, which is operable and that did it.</seg>
<seg id="10">If you do not, it spreads everywhere.</seg>
<seg id="11">It would have been a rather bad situation.</seg>
<seg id="12">It changes a little the outlook.</seg>
<seg id="13">Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.</seg>
<seg id="14">The trio was lucky that he could start treatment at the beginning of 2014, out of season, which kept the break down to a minimum if that is the right term under such circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="15">I needed money, so I had to go better again soon.</seg>
<seg id="16">It was an incentive.</seg>
<seg id="17">I was in hospital and ran around on the station - 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet at a time when they said that some steps would be enough.</seg>
<seg id="18">This is how it starts.</seg>

<seg id="9">Now he was retire at the age of 65.</seg>
<seg id="10">The water-purpose association of the Veitensteingruppe, based in Kottendorf, Breitbrunn, supports around 150,000 cubic meters of water annually and supplies 32 places and hamlet with approximately 5500 inhabitants.</seg>
<seg id="11">The municipalities are church louder, Breitbrunn, Lauter, Ebelsbach and the town of Baunach.</seg>
<seg id="12">There are water distribution agreements for other cities and municipalities.</seg>
<seg id="13">The current chairman, Breitbrunnen's mayor Gertrud Bühl (FW), recalled that Rupert Göller was appointed as a Wasserwart in 1985 and was appointed managing director of the Zweckverband in 1988.</seg>
<seg id="14">"his tasks have been very diverse and they extend from water management and maintenance work on office and organization activities, budgetary planning, calculation of fees and contributions up to emergency operations at weekends," said the chairman.</seg>
<seg id="15">As an outstanding event, it called the commissioning and inauguration of the new wells (1994), purchase sale in the area of the new wells (1998) and compensation of the farmers, the renovation of the high container (1999), the acquisition of a central computer control (2004) and the ponds of water pipes.</seg>

<seg id="2">The risky and energy-intensive German steel industry remains spared from additional costs to millions of millions.</seg>
<seg id="3">Financial burdens that threatened the industry from green electricity subsidies are from the table.</seg>
<seg id="4">It remains in the liberation of the Renewable Energies Survey at the stock levels of the so-called self-mass production in the German steel industry, said Federal Minister of Agriculture Sigmar Gabriel (SPD) of the "Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung" (WAZ, Friday edition).</seg>

<seg id="1">Community, mind, health: singing does seniors well</seg>
<seg id="2">Singing has accompanied Ursel Kipp all her life: as a young girl she was in the school choir, in the teacher's office she occupied the subject of music, and today the 78-year-old sings in a seniors-choir.</seg>
<seg id="3">"singing moves me - emotional and physical," she describes.</seg>
<seg id="4">After a rehearsal, she feels balanced, cheerful and alive, she says.</seg>
<seg id="5">By the way, she does something good for her health and her mind.</seg>
<seg id="6">For singing is a great hobby for seniors from several perspectives, says Erhard Hackler from the German Seniorenliga.</seg>
<seg id="7">Most seniors sing in the choir and share with like-minded the joy of music, describes Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="8">By regular meetings, seniors can socialize and maintain social contacts.</seg>
<seg id="9">Because often social and familial structures dissolve in old age, a choir is then an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "this experience also made Ursel Kipp in her choir:" "" "to speak and organise, to be able to rely on others and to learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of being together." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="11">Singing can be exhausting in the positive sense, says Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="12">For this, seniors train a deep and controlled breathing.</seg>
<seg id="13">Those who regularly demand his lungs are not so fast from the purest in everyday life.</seg>
<seg id="14">Even when it comes to preserving the sound of the voice in old age, singing is an optimal hobby.</seg>
<seg id="15">In elderly people, Singen often has a very special effect, says Ursula Lenz from the Federal Labour Association of the Senioren-Organisations.</seg>
<seg id="16">In the older generations the common singing had a much higher significance; it was part of everyday life, both at school and in leisure time, she explains.</seg>
<seg id="17">Lenz often observes that singing or listening of songs in elderly people awakens many memories, often associated with positive feelings of their adolescent period.</seg>
<seg id="18">Through lyrics and especially melodies, dementia-sick people departs themselves to long past events.</seg>
<seg id="19">In singing, the head also requires special performance, explains Lenz.</seg>
<seg id="20">Focusing on one's own voice and a given rhythm and adapting to the other singers - this is a major cognitive challenge.</seg>
<seg id="21">Especially older people who live alone do not only practice concentrating on themselves.</seg>
<seg id="22">Another positive aspect is the recognition that one experiences through singing in the choir, says Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="23">An enthusiastic audience is a great praise.</seg>
<seg id="24">Also the self-esteem grows through singing in the choir.</seg>
<seg id="25">To show himself: if I have long for something, I become better and stronger over me - this experience strengthens.</seg>
<seg id="26">Good reasons to start singing, so there is enough.</seg>
<seg id="27">Those who want to try a new hobby should not hesitate - even if he thinks of having little talent, Lenz advises.</seg>
<seg id="28">You don't sing alone - with 50 singing people, who already hears when a sound goes to it?</seg>
<seg id="29">In search of the right offer, senior citizens have different options, says Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="30">If someone sings from the circle of acquaintances in a senior churchyard, one can easily join.</seg>
<seg id="31">Many cities also offer views of the choirs in the surrounding area.</seg>
<seg id="32">Whoever wishes to sing in a church choir can turn directly to the church or church leader.</seg>
<seg id="33">Many senior choirs can also be found on the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="34">Anyone who has no access to the Internet can ask the family, friends or neighbors for help with the internet research.</seg>
<seg id="35">Whoever wants to sing, should necessarily join a choir, advises Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="36">Singing does the soul well and has something liberating - that applies to all ages.</seg>

<seg id="6">The Ministry of Foreign Affairs is in constant contact with local authorities, such as barbarians.</seg>
<seg id="7">At about 200 kilometres south of the capital Bangkok, Hua Hin initially exploded two bombs on Thursday evening.</seg>
<seg id="8">According to the police, a Thai woman was killed and about 20 people were injured, including the Austrians, three Germans, three Dutch and three Italians.</seg>
<seg id="9">Friday afternoon, two jump nozzles went up, but a further human being was killed according to the authorities.</seg>
<seg id="10">Also from Phuket a bomb explosion was reported in the morning.</seg>
<seg id="11">During the detonation near the beach strands Patong popular among holidaymakers, a taxi driver was injured.</seg>
<seg id="12">In Surat Thani at the south-east coast of the country then another bomb exploded, which killed a municipal employee.</seg>
<seg id="13">According to the authorities in a flower bed, the explosive rate went into the air before the precinct of the coastal police.</seg>
<seg id="14">Finally, some detonations in Phang Nga and Trang on the south-west coast as well as in Chumphon on the south-east coast demanded several injured.</seg>

<seg id="18">"" "" "" "it is too early to express themselves to possible motives - probably it is about the actions of Muslim rebels." ""</seg>
<seg id="19">Thai media also wanted to see a pattern typical for the bombing of Muslim separatists in the south of the country.</seg>
<seg id="20">The Thai police, on the other hand, declared that the attacks would not be in connection with the Islamist insurgency movement or with international terrorism.</seg>
<seg id="21">"" "" "" "this is only local sabotage limited to limited areas and provinces," "" "said a spokesman in Bangkok." ""</seg>
<seg id="22">Rather, one assumes that the bombs were laid down by opponents of the ruling military junta.</seg>
<seg id="23">In the past few days, the authorities would have received secret references to forthcoming attacks in the south of the country - but they were not informed of the exact time and the places.</seg>
<seg id="24">It is still unclear which group behind the attacks stashed.</seg>
<seg id="25">The police showed their officials across the country, security around important government buildings, as well as airports, train stations, tourist attractions, restaurants and entertainment districts.</seg>
<seg id="26">In Thailand there are still smaller bomb attacks, but mostly they do not focus on tourists.</seg>
<seg id="27">In Hua Hin is a palace that was used over the years of Thailand's king Bhumibol Adulyadej.</seg>
<seg id="28">According to the well-known bomb explosions, the Austrian Foreign Ministry recommends on its homepage to follow the instructions of the Thai security authorities.</seg>

<seg id="31">Increased safety risk (security level 2) landed for the rest of the country.</seg>
<seg id="32">The attacks on Thursday and Friday took place a few days after a controversial referendum on a constitution elaborated by the junta.</seg>
<seg id="33">"" "" "" "this gives the military great influence over the coming years." ""</seg>
<seg id="34">Junta boss and prime minister Prayut Chan-o-cha said the bombs were an attempt to stiff chaos, while the country moved towards stability, improvement of economic situation and tourism.</seg>
<seg id="35">The military junta, who had seized the power in 2014 after a phase of bloody disturbances, considers himself to have led the kingdom back to stability and order.</seg>
<seg id="36">However, the military did not succeed in getting a grip on the insurgent rebellion of Muslim rebels in the extreme south of the country.</seg>
<seg id="37">More than 6500 people have already been killed in the conflict.</seg>
<seg id="38">Almost a year ago, in Bangkok, at an attack on a popular Hindu shrine, 20 people were killed, most of them foreign tourists.</seg>

<seg id="2">At the plant in Azendorf, the drainage fee will further increase once more if appropriate improvement measures are necessary.</seg>
<seg id="3">After a pertinent calculation, the sewage price in Azendorf is then at 4.37 euros per cubic meter.</seg>
<seg id="4">As Mayor Bernd Steinhäuser (CSU) reported, it was found in the authorization of the budget by the Landratsamt Kulmbach that undercovers these wastewater installations.</seg>
<seg id="5">Due to legal foundations, the market Kasendorf is obligated to operate the equipment at a cost-effective manner.</seg>
<seg id="6">From October 1, 2016, the citizens as well as the industrial and industrial enterprises from Welschenkahl, Neudorf, Reuth, Azendorf, Lopp, Lindenberg and Zultenberg will have to go deeper into the purse.</seg>
<seg id="7">The fee increases are between 48 and 67 percent.</seg>
<seg id="8">As Chairman of the Board of Directors, Herbert Schmidt presented the committee, a re-calculation of the fees for the wastewater systems of the market community was necessary.</seg>

<seg id="11">Due to the low distribution base for example expenses for necessary repairs of several thousand Euros would be engraved.</seg>
<seg id="12">In addition, the waste water in all three systems is slightly declining.</seg>
<seg id="13">Furthermore, in the past calculation period in all three systems, not least due to their age, refurbishment and repair costs have fallen to a considerable extent.</seg>
<seg id="14">The plant in Azendorf was almost 30 years old, the facilities for Welschenkahl, Neudorf and Reuth as well as Zultenberg, Lindenberg and Lopp almost 20 years.</seg>

<seg id="1">"" "Snapchat" "" "Anime" "" "effect as an Asian caricature" ""</seg>
<seg id="2">Snapchat says that this filter is Anime-inspired, but some observers say it is insensitive to breeds.</seg>
<seg id="3">With its filter tool, the Snapchat allows about 150 million daily users to change reality and play with identities in such a way that already borders the absurdity.</seg>
<seg id="4">You can turn into a pineapple, a dog or a figure that could be of a Roy Lichtenstein painting.</seg>
<seg id="5">The filters are blunt, standalone-rotating tools that generate more than 30 million selfies per day.</seg>
<seg id="6">All false appearances come to the public.</seg>
<seg id="7">Snapchat filters have drawn criticisms in the past in which they were accused of promoting blackface pumping or white skin as a beauty ideal.</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "when this week suggested some users a filter that gave them slit eyes, false teeth and awake cheeks, some critics called it a racist caricature of Asians -" "" "Yellow-faced" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="9">They asked if these repeated controversy had shown a larger problem that the company has diversity.</seg>
<seg id="10">The news and indignation were widely distributed on Wednesday, with reports from The Verge and Motherboard, one day after Snapchat shared that it had deactivated the feature.</seg>
<seg id="11">The company offered an excuse: the filter was intended as an homage to anime characters and not as caricature of Asians.</seg>
<seg id="12">But outsiders who experienced racissmus reminded the filter of injurious clichés.</seg>
<seg id="13">Others rejected the Anime comparison.</seg>
<seg id="14">In an e-mail Grace Sparapani wrote a Korean-American art student whose tweet was widespread over the photos that the filter was "vulnerable and" said unpleasant. "</seg>
<seg id="15">She added that "it is difficult to argue with the comparison of a very contradictory Asian caricature and the filter effects.</seg>
<seg id="16">It shows that the filter is not yellowish, but that the yellow-face has been pulled into the stripping extrem.</seg>
<seg id="17">Snapchat is not the only company that crosses this cultural drift.</seg>
<seg id="18">The American culture seems to be involved in an endless diversity of diversity and integration, from conference rooms to Hollywood and the devices we all hold in hand.</seg>
<seg id="19">And Snapchat's large audience of young people - who are diversed as their older opponents - could expect more to expect sensitivity.</seg>
<seg id="20">When one of Snapchat filters creates a picture that is insulting for a user, "so it is much more difficult that such things remain unnoticed when it was the case," said the 25-year-old Katie Zhu in an interview on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="21">On Thursday, Zhu decided to work as a product manager and engineer for medium to delete their Snapchat account and urged others to do the same.</seg>
<seg id="22">In an essay for Medium and in a telephone interview, she said that she believes that racial-related controversy reflects a lack of diversity among the settings practices at Snapchat.</seg>
<seg id="23">Zhu criticized the partially white, only male leadership and ended up with a hashtag: # DeleteSnapchat.</seg>
<seg id="24">"either they have no different representation of people with other skin colours in their workforce so that they can make such decisions," said the Chinese-American Zhu, "or they have people with other skin colours that work there, but not in positions in which they feel safe or comfortable to say something about it."</seg>

<seg id="1">Military leadership precipitates ISIS secret intelligence information, confronts the committee of Congress</seg>
<seg id="2">Military members of the United States Central Command set new intelligence in order to draw an optimistic picture of the war against the so-called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, when the actual conditions were allowed on site, an enquiry committee of the Congress reported in a report on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="3">The preliminary report, created by a Task Force of Republican Member of the Army Committees, Intelligence Committees, and the Defender of Defense, reports of great dissatisfaction among Central Command Intelligence analysts who reported how to change their assessments to American efforts in the fight against the Islamic state.</seg>
<seg id="4">Central Command, short Cencom, is the military headquarters in Tampa, Florida, which controls American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.</seg>

<seg id="7">The leading errors in the CentCom reach the top of the organization.</seg>
<seg id="8">The ten-page report shows detailed contingencies in the years 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of American efforts in the training of the Iraqi forces.</seg>
<seg id="9">Although there is no direct evidence that government tips under Obama have given instructions to change reports, it shows how analyst exposed the pressure from their superior laws, an optimistic picture of the threat of the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "" "" "during the first half of 2015, many Central Command press releases, statements and statements before the congress were clearly more positive than the facts," "" "stated the report." ""</seg>
<seg id="11">For example, a Centcom Angehöriger publicly announced that a military reconquest of Mossulps could already begin in April or May 2015.</seg>

<seg id="14">From the middle of 2014 until the middle of 2015, Central Command has changed the intelligence reports to play down the threat of ISIS in Iraq.</seg>
<seg id="15">The Republicans called the Task Force to live after they were admitted that analysts were worried about the manipulation of reports on the Islamic state.</seg>
<seg id="16">The report published on Thursday will be completed by more detailed insights, while the investigations will continue.</seg>
<seg id="17">In addition, further investigation of CentCom reports by the Secretary-General of the Department of Defense is underway.</seg>
<seg id="18">Democratic Members of the Intelligence Committee issued their own findings on Thursday that agree with some of the conclusions of the Republican Task Force.</seg>
<seg id="19">"" "" "" "in 2014 and 2015, CentCom also created a moderately limited process for the creation of thoughtful assessments to ISIL and the Iraqi security services," "" "the highest-ranking democrat in the committee, member of the House of Representatives, Adam B.

<seg id="21">"" "but Mr. Schiff and the Democrats gave no indication of a" "" "certain political opinion" "" "intervention in the Centcom analyst." ""</seg>
<seg id="22">The preliminary results of the investigations of the congress were published on Tuesday by "The Daily Beast."</seg>
<seg id="23">Last August, the New York Times reported an investigation by the Pentagon's Chief Inspector, who were recorded after complaints from CentCom analysts.</seg>
<seg id="24">Lt. Cmdr. Patrick Evans, a Pentagon Press spokesman, gave in a statement that the Defense Department would not comment on the Congress, while the investigations of the general inspector are still in progress.</seg>
<seg id="25">"" "but he also admitted that" "" "experts sometimes have divergent opinions on the interpretation of complex data, and that the intelligence services and the Ministry of Defense welcome a controversial discussion on these important issues of national defence." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="26">The investigations have repercussions on the question of a successful aerial campaign under American leadership in Iraq and Syria (an allegation that is now being made by a growing number of members of the Department of Defense).</seg>
<seg id="27">The allegations of last year, however, raised the question of how President Obama can rely on the Central Command for honest assessments of military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis regions.</seg>
<seg id="28">The criticism concerning the secret information about the Islamic state remind of disagreements of more than ten years ago, as a centcom analyst, Gregory Hooker, a written article about how the then government under George W. Bush expected only a small occupation force in Iraq and had little time to worry about the consequences of the invasion of 2003.</seg>
<seg id="29">Mr. Hooker also played a key role in the revolt against the current coverage of the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="30">Last year, the team headed by Mr. Hooker stated that contrary to the statements made by the government, airstrikes against the refineries held by the Islamic State would have no significant impact on the financial situation of the terrorist group, as these provisional refineries had put into operation to sell oil on the black market.</seg>
<seg id="31">However, this knowledge was not published, the Times reported in September.</seg>
<seg id="32">CentCom's former commander, Gen. Lloyd J. Austin III, was criticised by members of the legislature because of its overly positive appraisal of the war situation at a hearing before the Senate.</seg>
<seg id="33">General Austin retired in April and was replaced with the Central Command by Gen. Joseph L. Votel.</seg>

<seg id="1">Amid the Rage of the Olympic Games, the Zen of the trampoline</seg>
<seg id="2">Wherever you are, how late it is, it is the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="3">The events in Rio de Janeiro feel constantly and invariably, a rapid easel between competition and aspiration.</seg>
<seg id="4">It is as if the olympic torch itself is a burning rod, which is handed down from the bracelets to the swimmer to the triathlete.</seg>
<seg id="5">You can't turn off the TV, read a newspaper or listen to your neighbours during the queue in the coffee shop without hearing about Simone Biles, Katie Ledecky or the dispute between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos.</seg>
<seg id="6">And then there is Logan Dooley.</seg>
<seg id="7">Dooley, who is at the Olympic Games for the first time and a womb with dimples, could have been among these well-known names being sent to Prime Time, by sponsors and benevolent TV commercials, if he would be a swimmer, gymnastics or even funnel.</seg>
<seg id="8">But Dooley, 28, from Lake Forest, California, fights in the olympic trampolines around gold.</seg>
<seg id="9">The olympic flame does not illuminate any event the same.</seg>
<seg id="10">Further from the center, partially in the shade there are the sports that are not generally accepted: air pistol shooting, archery, badminton, Taekwondo.</seg>
<seg id="11">We will always have the breast swim and may it reign for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="12">But if I should show arguments for my particular favourite, let me draw attention to the discreet charm of the trampoline.</seg>
<seg id="13">Although the trampoline jumping has been an olympic event since 2000, when it had its debut in Sydney, the last 16 years it became so sparse that many of those I had asked do not know that there is actually an Olympic sport.</seg>
<seg id="14">This could also be regional ignorance.</seg>
<seg id="15">Although the US sent athletes to a competition, it has never won a medal in trampolines and until 2012 has had an athlete who made it to the final round.</seg>
<seg id="16">The Chinese and the Russians tend to share prices for the men and the Chinese and Canadians for women.</seg>
<seg id="17">Dong Dong from China and Rosie MacLennan from Canada will defend their gold medal from London this year.</seg>
<seg id="18">The trampoline jumping has a certain outsider charm, partly because it sounds suitable for the unenlightened ear for a clowic school than that sounds for the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="19">At this point, I should admit that I am not an expert, but only a bearded enthusiast.</seg>
<seg id="20">It has humorous potential - the cartoonous tremor of his never-ending upsurge - but also the Grazie of the gymnasium and the dove, the two sports that it combines in essence.</seg>
<seg id="21">"" "the word" "" "trampoline" "" "comes from the Spanish El Trampoline, which means as much as" "" "springboard" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="22">Emerging victors jump on a gigantic trampoline, shoot almost up to 30 feet in the air and have a number of falling movements (turning, pike and saltos) before they land on their feet.</seg>
<seg id="23">According to the official Olympic ogram, they are assessed according to design, level of difficulty and "flight time."</seg>
<seg id="24">Thirty-two athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women, will compete against each other in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="25">The most common olympic vector is straight.</seg>
<seg id="26">Medallists have to go on in their pursuit of gold, faster, upward and over, sometimes up to the finish, sometimes back and forth, up and down on the playground.</seg>
<seg id="27">They do not only hunt the finish line or the output wall, but also another goal in television transmission: that of the world or the Olympiar of the Olympics.</seg>
<seg id="28">The goal-oriented aspiration is nobel, admirable, even fanatic - and it is enough to stir even a spectator to tears.</seg>
<seg id="29">But it is also what I find myself tiring when watching those games.</seg>
<seg id="30">The trampoline offers an atempause.</seg>
<seg id="31">The vector of the trampoline is above.</seg>
<seg id="32">A forward movement is not the goal.</seg>
<seg id="33">He or she dies off, seemingly weightless like an astronaut, goes up, then downwards, then effortlessly back up.</seg>
<seg id="34">There is also a competition, of course, not without difficulty, but during exercise there is no hectic attack on the goal, no wolves into the distance, only the dreamy, elegant lifting of time and gravity.</seg>
<seg id="35">It's as Zen as the competition in the Olympics only can be.</seg>
<seg id="36">The qualifying and final round of women will take place on Friday afternoon, in streaming at 13.00 Eastern Time; the men on Saturday, also at 13.00.</seg>
<seg id="37">NBC will radiate the final rounds as part of a afternoon block on both days from 14.00.</seg>
<seg id="38">In the midst of the Olympics, they promise a quiet, nice moment, one that is likely to overlook in general turmoil.</seg>
<seg id="39">When the increase of consciousness can only be achieved by the attaining and the objectification of male athletes - as the male US gymnasts proposed recently - then Mr. Dooley expects his air rinse, new fan base.</seg>

<seg id="6">In the last ten years, it was one of Africa's most stable countries, a solid ally of the West with a rapidly growing economy.</seg>
<seg id="7">But in recent months protests against the government shook the country and expanded into more and more areas.</seg>
<seg id="8">Last week thousands of people stormed down the streets and demanded fundamental political changes.</seg>
<seg id="9">According to human rights organisations, the response of the government was merciful.</seg>
<seg id="10">Witnesses said that policemen shot and killed tens of unarmed demonstrators.</seg>

<seg id="14">Ethiopia is the most populous country in Africa, and its stability is estimated by the West.</seg>
<seg id="15">American military and secret services work closely with the Ethiopians to fight terror across the region, especially in Somalia. only a few countries in Africa, if at all, get so much Western aid.</seg>
<seg id="16">Ethiopia's economy expanded at a considerable pace.</seg>
<seg id="17">Its infrastructure has dramatically improved - there is a new commuter train in the capital Addis Abeba.</seg>
<seg id="18">The roads are generally quiet, safe and clean.</seg>
<seg id="19">Even though Ethiopia was anything but a model for democracy - human rights organisations have constantly led the repression by the government - the opposition in the country has been restricted, while dissidents were effectively silenced.</seg>
<seg id="20">Many were sent into exile or jail, killed or driven into the expanse of the desert.</seg>
<seg id="21">But that could change.</seg>
<seg id="22">"" "" "" "if you suppress people and have no other options except to protest, it breaks out," "" "said Seyoum Tessa, a lecturer in central Ethiopia." ""</seg>
<seg id="23">The whole youth protests.</seg>
<seg id="24">A generation protests.</seg>
<seg id="25">There are numerous complaints that cover everything from ground use to stranglehold in relation to the power of the ruling coalition.</seg>
<seg id="26">Following a preliminary vote last year, the ruling party and its allies received the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 percent of parliament.</seg>
<seg id="27">At the same time, tensions continue along the border to Eritrea; a fight for this cracky, controversial line called for hundreds of lives in June.</seg>
<seg id="28">Analysts fear that separatists like the Oromo Liberation Front, or the National Liberation Front of the Ogaden, which have been defeated more or less in recent years, exploit the turbulence and rearming itself.</seg>
<seg id="29">Several factors explain why feelings of bitterness explode after years of being intoxicated under the surface.</seg>
<seg id="30">The first seems harmless: smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="31">In recent years, many of the Ethiopians were able to communicate with social media, as cheap smartphones were becoming more and more common and the internet services improved.</seg>
<seg id="32">Even if the government blocked access to Facebook and Twitter, what they do in regular intervals, especially in protests, many people can still communicate via Internet proxies that hide where they are.</seg>
<seg id="33">Several young Ethiopia announced that they were thus gathered to protest.</seg>
<seg id="34">The second factor is that there is more solidarity between the Oromos and Amharas, the two largest ethnic groups in Ethiopia.</seg>
<seg id="35">The Oromos and Amharas are not natural enemies.</seg>
<seg id="36">For eons, the Amharas, who from Ethiopia are predominantly Christian highlands, prospered in politics and economy while they exploited the Oromos, many of whom are Muslims and live in lowland areas.</seg>
<seg id="37">But this is also changing.</seg>
<seg id="38">"" "" "" "we are here to co-ordinate under a screen," "" "said Mulatu Gemechu, a leader of the Oromos." ""</seg>
<seg id="39">The biggest protests took place in areas of Amhara and Oromos.</seg>
<seg id="40">Many Amharas and Oromos have the feeling that Ethiopia is unfair dominated by members of the ethnic group of the tigray that account about 6 percent of the population and dominant in the military, in the secret services, in trade and politics.</seg>
<seg id="41">The third reason for the unrest is the death of Meles Zenawi.</seg>
<seg id="42">Mr. Meles, a former rebel leader, was until his death on a non-publicized disease in 2012 17 years of Ethiopia's prime minister.</seg>
<seg id="43">He was regarded as tactical genius, a man who could think around corners.</seg>
<seg id="44">Analysts say that he was especially well versed in perceiving early signs of dissatisfaction and using special officers to manipulate opponents and make them harmless.</seg>
<seg id="45">"" "" "" "the current regime lacks this fundamental skill," "" "said Mr Abdi, a conflict analyst." ""</seg>
<seg id="46">Ethiopia's new Prime Minister, Hailemariam Desalegn, was selected for relatively uncautious reasons to take the position of Mr Meles.</seg>
<seg id="47">Unlike Mr Meles, who came from the Tigray region of Ethiopia, Mr. Hailemariam comes from the South.</seg>
<seg id="48">Analysts say that he does not enjoy the confidence of the security services controlled by the Tigray.</seg>
<seg id="49">Many fear that the result will be more bloodshed.</seg>
<seg id="50">The last time Ethiopia had witnessed such an upheaval in 2005, after thousands of elections protested, which, according to the analyst statements, were apparently deprecated by the government and then stolen.</seg>
<seg id="51">During the subsequent raids, many protesters were killed even if it was less than in the past few months and this time of unrest was passed relatively quickly.</seg>
<seg id="52">Development experts praised Ethiopia's leaders for their visionary infrastructure planning, such as the new commuter train, as well as for their measurable progress in poverty reduction.</seg>
<seg id="53">But apparently this did not prevent the intensification of the internal abhorment of the Ethiopian government.</seg>
<seg id="54">And it adopts a dangerous ethnic shape.</seg>
<seg id="55">Last month, protesters in Gondar, an amharic city, conducted by Tigray, and the hatred towards the Tigray is becoming more and more common in social media.</seg>
<seg id="56">Analysts say that the protests hit the US and other Western allies into a peculiar position.</seg>
<seg id="57">The American government used Ethiopia as the basis for Dronenflights over the neighboring Somalia, even though they recently announced that it closed this base.</seg>
<seg id="58">While the West clearly wants to support democracy, it does not want its ally to collapse in an already volatile region.</seg>

<seg id="1">Donald Trump declares his statement Obama has founded ISIS was "sarcasm"</seg>
<seg id="2">Donald J. Trump attempts to dispel the last controversy on Friday that surrounds his campaign by fearing that his repeatedly repeated claims, President Obama and Hillary Clinton would be the "founders" of the terrorist group Islamic State, not seriously meant.</seg>
<seg id="3">This clarification raised new questions on the communication skills of the Republican candidate, whether he would be able to communicate clearly and understandably with the American public.</seg>
<seg id="4">It also brings his fellow combatants who endeavour to take him into protection during an eventful phase, to explain the peculiar position, declarations he could not have meant.</seg>
<seg id="5">After he had made the hint at an election campaign on Wednesday evening, Mr. Trump cancelled in relation to the assertion on Thursday and insisted in interviews that he really did not intend to suggest the president and Mrs. Clinton would have created ISIS.</seg>
<seg id="6">But in an early morning tweet on Friday Mr. Trump said he was simply sarcastic.</seg>
<seg id="7">The tweet was the contrast to the previous day, where Mr. Trump said in a number of interviews, he meant the accusation completely serious.</seg>
<seg id="8">When the conservative radiomorator Hugh Hewitt wants Mr. Trump to weaken the statement by reminding him that Mr. Obama wants to destroy ISIS, the Republican candidate didn't want to know about it.</seg>
<seg id="9">The last storm of critic fires down on Mr. Trump, while trying to direct the focus of his campaign because of falling demand values to the economic situation.</seg>
<seg id="10">Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton talking about the economic situation in Michigan this week.</seg>
<seg id="11">On Friday Mr. Trump attempts to return to this subject again.</seg>
<seg id="12">Reporting on Twitter, he warned that Mrs. Clintons would lead to higher taxes and that he found her speech dull.</seg>
<seg id="13">Mr. Trump has already preached sarcasm for his defense.</seg>
<seg id="14">At the end of July he drew strong criticism when he said the Russians were supposed to hack Mrs. Clinton's emails, but he later said "Of course, I told the sarcastic."</seg>
<seg id="15">This method allows Mr. Trump to postpone the linguistic boundaries in politics and then return to demand.</seg>

<seg id="17">But I also believe he's clever enough to keep his statements vague enough so that they can be interpreted in various ways.</seg>
<seg id="18">Instead of defying the tone for the presidential elections, Mr. Trump has accepted an even more caustic tone as his readings have gone further.</seg>
<seg id="19">A new survey conducted by NBC / Wall Street Journal / Marist, which was published on Friday, showed a lead in the states North Carolina, Virginia, Colorado and a head-to-head race in Florida.</seg>
<seg id="20">While Mr. Trump in general tries to excuse himself for his provocative statements, he often accused his critics to distort his statements or misunderstand his or her humor.</seg>
<seg id="21">But while he is increasingly focusing attention in the last months of his presidential campaign, Mr. Trumps's scissors have brought his loyal competitors into the uncomfortable situation, regardless of how provocative might be his statements.</seg>
<seg id="22">Rudolph W. Giuliani, former mayor of New York and one of the most prominent intercesses, gave a great deal of effort to defend the candidate in a CNN interview from Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "" "" "I believe what he says are legitimate, political comments" "" "said Mr. Giuliani, so he was asked for the correctness of Mr. Trumps statements, whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic State." ""</seg>
<seg id="24">It is true in this sense that before Obama, ISIS was an almost unknown, small organisation, he called them back-bearer, completely wrong and therefore it happened because he pulled the troops out of Iraq.</seg>
<seg id="25">Most mainstream Republicans try to argue that the Obama administration, in which Mrs. Clinton served as a foreign minister, allowed ISIS to spread the situation in the Middle East aggressively under control.</seg>
<seg id="26">Before the election events in Pennsylvania on Friday Mr. Trump continued his attacks on the media and threw them out on each of his words and to be prejudiced against him.</seg>

<seg id="1">Grönland hai: the oldest vertebrate is nearly 400 years old</seg>
<seg id="2">Rare sight.</seg>
<seg id="3">Greenland's sharks usually come to the surface only in winter.</seg>
<seg id="4">This shark was allowed to go back to the sea after an investigation on board the ship ship Sanna.</seg>
<seg id="5">He was born in 1624 and swims well at a 1 km / h through the North Atlantic - until today.</seg>
<seg id="6">Greenland's sharks get up with 150 years of offspring.</seg>
<seg id="7">The Grönland shark usually floats along the North Atlantic Ocean, in an hour it reaches an average of just 1,220 meters.</seg>
<seg id="8">Only when it arrives, the five meter long animal accelerates to a full 2.6 km / h - and is half as fast as a seal with this top speed.</seg>
<seg id="9">This lifestyle, embossed by slowness, seems to be a patronage for a high age.</seg>
<seg id="10">Julius Nielsen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report in the journal "Science" at any rate by a Greenland-shark who could be 392 years old.</seg>
<seg id="11">"madness," Alexander Scheuerlein comments from the Max Planck Institute for demographic research in Rostock this lifespan, which means a world record for vertebrates.</seg>
<seg id="12">Although the evolutionary biologist thought long that Greenland-sharks become stone-old.</seg>
<seg id="13">Only lacked the evidence.</seg>
<seg id="14">Greenland's sharks are difficult to observe, after all, they live mainly in the polar sea in front of the sparsely populated coasts of Canada, Greenland, Norway and Svalbard.</seg>
<seg id="15">Because they prefer water temperatures around the six degrees Celsius, they usually appear on the surface only in winter.</seg>
<seg id="16">Researchers know correspondingly little about the lifestyle of Greenland's sharks.</seg>
<seg id="17">Their pentpentine is as they equip six animals with a transmitter prior to Svalbard.</seg>
<seg id="18">Prey make this shark nevertheless: in the stomach of an animal, researchers found the remains of a seal, another had swallowed the jawbone of a young polar bear.</seg>
<seg id="19">Possibly they hunt sleeping animals or patrol on the ground of the icesea and look for carcass looking from higher water layers downwards.</seg>
<seg id="20">Julius Nielsen and his colleagues now examined 28 Greenland's sharks who held fishermen from Greenland or Svalbard as a bycatch from the depth of the North Atlantic Ocean between 2010 and 2013.</seg>
<seg id="21">The smallest shark was just 81 cm long, while the greatest 502 centimeter was measured.</seg>
<seg id="22">To determine the age of the animals, they analysed the liner core of the sharks with the carbon-14 method.</seg>
<seg id="23">This centre of the eye lens arises already before the birth of the sharks, the proteins in it are later no longer renewed.</seg>
<seg id="24">The two smallest sharks had notably a lot of carbon-14 in the lenticular nucleus.</seg>
<seg id="25">Their birth should therefore lie in the atmosphere after the early 1960s, when atomic weapons try to drag greater amounts of this radioactive carbon into the atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="26">In the third-smallest animal with 220 centimeters of length, the lenticular nucleus, on the other hand, contained a small excess of carbon-14 from the atomic weapons, it is likely to have celebrated its 50th birthday during its investigation in 2012.</seg>
<seg id="27">In their lenticular nucleus all larger Greenland-sharks, on the other hand, had normal carbon-14 amounts, which result from cosmic rays in the atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="28">In fact, the carbon-14 watch for a 493 centimeter long Greenland-shark showed an age of 335 years, while the record shark could be 392 years old with 502 centimeters.</seg>
<seg id="29">That Grönland-shark females only get offspring when they are longer than four meters, was known.</seg>
<seg id="30">Now the researchers were able to assign an age to the length.</seg>
<seg id="31">Since one of the animals with 392 centimeters probably stood at the threshold to the sexually mature and its age was determined with 156 years, Greenland's sharks with the multiplication obviously allow at least one and a half centuries of time.</seg>
<seg id="32">This is also likely to be a world record for vertebrates.</seg>
<seg id="33">That such methusaleme live above all in icy waters, is no coincidence.</seg>
<seg id="34">Also the previous record holder, a 211-year old Grönland-whale, in whose bacon at the neck a 120-year-old harpoon point stuck, was caught in front of Alaska.</seg>
<seg id="35">Due to the low temperatures, the organism of the animals living there often runs on asparagus.</seg>
<seg id="36">So they mature later - and age slower.</seg>
<seg id="37">In order to keep warm in cold water, the animals are also often particularly large.</seg>
<seg id="38">Because the volume grows much faster than its surface by which the animal loses heat.</seg>
<seg id="39">The heat loss of one gram of mouse is therefore much greater than with one gram of elephant.</seg>
<seg id="40">Another advantage: they have fewer enemies.</seg>
<seg id="41">"" "" "" "a smaller animal lives therefore more dangerous and should concentrate on having as many offspring as possible as possible," "" "explains the evolutionary biologist Scheuerlein." ""</seg>
<seg id="42">A very big animal should, on the other hand, invest his resources in a long life.</seg>

<seg id="2">Scotland's Callum Skinner raste last night in the men's team Sprint at the Velodrom in Rio for fame when the British team defended the title of London 2012.</seg>
<seg id="3">The 23-year-old from Glasgow took the anchor, which his compatriot Sir Chris Hoy had made himself to Eigen. the Jung proudly made the legend as he stormed at home to invade a victory from the favourites of New Zealand.</seg>
<seg id="4">England claimed a shocking victory four years ago, while Hoy won the fifth of six Olympic medals.</seg>
<seg id="5">They repeated the trick after taking the train world championships in London in March despite the withdrawal of Hoys only a modest sixth place.</seg>
<seg id="6">The problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of Jamie Staff.</seg>
<seg id="7">They did this in time as a Hindu.</seg>
<seg id="8">Hoys retirement showed a gap that Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton attempted to close.</seg>
<seg id="9">Skinner was the man with whom they stayed when they saw potential in the shallots that unfolded.</seg>
<seg id="10">Hindes, Kenny - four years ago with Hoy won - and Skinner placed an Olympic record in the qualifying rounds, but in the standard laps the New Zealanders won in the first round.</seg>
<seg id="11">And the British trio won the duel with gold.</seg>
<seg id="12">Hindu was just behind after his lap, but Kenny got the team forward and Skinner held it.</seg>
<seg id="13">A change of strategy made a large part of the transformation in which Hindu went in a higher gear to slow it down and allow Kenny and above all Skinner to keep pace.</seg>
<seg id="14">Hoy saw from his position as BBC expert and fell on Skinner, Kenny and Hindu, when they climbed on the podium.</seg>
<seg id="15">"" "the 23-year-old Skinner from Glasgow said:" "" "it is a flattering comparison." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="16">I am only here to do my best and to make a name for me.</seg>
<seg id="17">In the final round we set up an Olympic board and the World Champion invests.</seg>
<seg id="18">It was just unbelievable.</seg>
<seg id="19">There is no better way to win this.</seg>
<seg id="20">After the triumph of 2012 at the page Kennys and Hoys, Hindes admitted that after a weak start, he deliberately fell to the railroad.</seg>
<seg id="21">He returned this statement later and there was no objection to England's rivals.</seg>
<seg id="22">With such an outstanding victory this time there was no such problem.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "said:" "" "it feels like all the GB flags on the grandstand like London." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="24">We have come together as a team over the last three months.</seg>
<seg id="25">We went so badly with so many world titles that it was unbelievable to win again at the Olympics.</seg>
<seg id="26">This is an event, a gold medal for the nation, the seven of ten titles were won both in Beijing and in London.</seg>
<seg id="27">If this is a barometer of our progress over the last five months, we expect successful five days in the Velodrom.</seg>
<seg id="28">With the form of Kennys it is in the realm of possibility that he repeated Hoys's victory of three olympic gold medals in a competition.</seg>
<seg id="29">That would mean for Kenny - who was born exactly 12 years younger than Hoy, who was born on March 23 (a seemingly holy date for British sports; on the day also Steve Redgrave, Mon Farah and Roger Bannister were born) - a yield of six gold medals and a silver medal.</seg>
<seg id="30">This is equal to that of Hoy.</seg>
<seg id="31">Kenny takes part in the sprint that starts today and will go for three days.</seg>
<seg id="32">"" "the 28-year-old Bolton said:" "" "I only enjoy this for the moment." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="33">The team event is always the best.</seg>
<seg id="34">You can win it with his colleagues.</seg>
<seg id="35">It feels something lonely to win alone.</seg>
<seg id="36">"" "he said," "" "If he wins two more gold medals, he should be beaten to the knight." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="37">It was the only medal competition of the day, but there were other good news for England.</seg>
<seg id="38">Sir Bradly Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doull qualified with the fastest performance in four-four-kilometre race.</seg>
<seg id="39">They arrived at the destination in 3: 51,942.</seg>
<seg id="40">The world record, which won gold in 2012 in London, was 3: 51,659.</seg>
<seg id="41">The first and final round (22.42) will take place on the second day of the competition, where Wiggins will focus on safety.</seg>
<seg id="42">He had fought with officials before the qualification yesterday, when functionaries cried to him to measure his height.</seg>
<seg id="43">In the corresponding women's competition, which will be continued and finished tomorrow, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald of Milngavie in world record time in 4: 13,260.</seg>
<seg id="44">The GB team relies on its strong track team to dominate the central period of the Olympic Games and to pick up a pair of medals.</seg>
<seg id="45">After a truly extraordinary representation of absolute dominance in Beijing and London the expectations for Rio were shut down.</seg>
<seg id="46">There played Dramas in the background, so the resignation of the technical director Shane Sutton in April among Sexism and Mobbinges as well as retirement of sizes such as Hoy and Victoria Pendleton.</seg>
<seg id="47">However, if one looks at the first evening of the competition in the Velodrom, it looks like the legendary reputation of GBs, which has reached its peak at the perfect moment, will be repeated again.</seg>

<seg id="1">Future of the smelting of Portland due to the abolition of energy demand</seg>
<seg id="2">The future of the aluminium melting of Portland in Victoria - as well as hundreds of workplaces of workers - are at stake, as the plant operator terminates the supply of energy and thus lifts all supply contracts, such as the supplying energy company.</seg>
<seg id="3">This step was followed by the decision of the government in Victoria at the start of this year, no further subsidies to operate the plant.</seg>
<seg id="4">A subsidy for 20 years expires in November.</seg>
<seg id="5">Up to 2000 jobs in the Alcoa site in Portland are at stake.</seg>
<seg id="6">Not less than 2,000 workplaces - direct and indirect - could be at risk of closing.</seg>
<seg id="7">In addition, it could result in domino effects since the melting process consumes around 10 percent of the total electricity generation of Victorias.</seg>
<seg id="8">In 2014 Alcoa joined the Point Henry Schmelzerei, which led last year to a closure of the Anglesea power station.</seg>
<seg id="9">The melting of Alcoa in Portland looses money and cracks a closure.</seg>
<seg id="10">This step follows the years of speculation regarding the future of the plant, originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar and lastly due to the electricity price for the plant.</seg>
<seg id="11">AGL, which supplies the large aluminium melting with its Loy Yang A power plant in Latrobe Valley, announced that three more owners will announce their contracts.</seg>
<seg id="12">The plant is owned by a joint venture of Alcoa and Alumina, of which the Chinese company CITIC and the Japanese Marubeni Corp hold smaller shares.</seg>
<seg id="13">"AGL assumes that the plant will continue to operate in Portland, which means another physical demand for electricity by the melting process," the company shared.</seg>
<seg id="14">AGL continues to say that the treaties are so-called "hedging transactions," which should be in force from November 2016.</seg>
<seg id="15">The contracts have a 12-month notice period so that they will end 2017.</seg>
<seg id="16">"" "" "" "therefore AGL expects that the contracts will contribute to the revenue in the financial year 17," "" "said the electricity supplier." ""</seg>
<seg id="17">All potential impacts on the revenues on AGL from the GJ 18 are currently limited by forecasts of strong financial markets for wholesale electricity prices.</seg>
<seg id="18">AGL announced that the value of the contracts has already been written in its annual report of $187 million in "anticipation of dismissal."</seg>
<seg id="19">"" "Alcoa said that the decision to withdraw the contracts, the" "" "Ability Alcoas... to operate the melting process" "" "or to ensure the power supply to the melting process" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="20">The U.S. company said that in 2010 it concluded a 20-year contract with Loy Yang, who would have entered into force from November this year even if it is still a declaration of why it withdrew from the contract.</seg>
<seg id="21">Analyst warn due to the poor economic conditions of the industry in front of the possible closure of the Portland melting factory in Victoria and the Tomago plant near Newcastle.</seg>
<seg id="22">Referring to analysts at the beginning of the week, Head of Operations Stephen Mikkelsen said that around 600 megawatts and Tomago consume around 900 megawatts of electricity per year.</seg>

<seg id="2">More than 160,000 of the country's relief efforts are rejected annually by the municipal councillaries, while the industry insists on the effects of further medium-cuts to already overloaded transactions.</seg>
<seg id="3">In Queensland, three out of five persons - mostly older persons, immigrants, needy workers, victims of violence and those who have no funds for unfair delogivations and similar - are rejected at their request for free legal advice and legal assistance.</seg>
<seg id="4">Legal services of the municipality, which are already covered in excess, are prepared for further cuts.</seg>
<seg id="5">From June next year, it is expected that these legal centres will lose another 30 percent of their federal funds.</seg>
<seg id="6">The director of Queesland James Farrell said that the last survey of the National Association of Municipal Authorities revealed that thousands of people will be rejected every year.</seg>
<seg id="7">Farrell said that the situation would only be worse without repealing the decision of the Federal Government.</seg>
<seg id="8">"Queensland's municipal councillaries are chronically underfinanced, meaning that thousands of people of important services that you need will be rejected," he said.</seg>
<seg id="9">People who leave violent relations, people with unmanageable and oppressive debt, families who have been dismissed by partitions - all these people have problems of legal nature and this survey shows that they cannot receive the help they need.</seg>
<seg id="10">As of June 2017, the federal government will cut the average by 30 percent, meaning that thousands of people in Queensland need to be forced to cope with their legal problems without any help.</seg>

<seg id="2">According to the projections of a new NASA climate model, Venus was probably inhabitable once.</seg>
<seg id="3">Scientists at the Goddard Institute for Space Studies in NASA developed a model to detect the past of Venus based on tools and algorithms similar to those of climate scientists.</seg>
<seg id="4">The model was designed to determine whether the Venus could have revealed similar conditions with its hot, waterless surface and CO2-tight atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="5">Scientists have previously indicated that the slow rotation of Venus could be explained by its dense atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="6">But the latest simulation suggests that the Venus could have had a thin, earth-like atmosphere and nevertheless slowly revolved.</seg>
<seg id="7">The model also illuminated the topography of the early Venus.</seg>
<seg id="8">The planet probably had more dry areas than the Earth, but once had enough water and geographic variability in order to accommodate life and protect against rapid evaporation.</seg>
<seg id="9">The early Venus also benefited from a sun that was 30 percent lighter.</seg>
<seg id="10">"in the GISS model simulation, the slow rotation of the Venus exhibits its day-side of the sun for almost two months," explained GISS Scientists Anthony Del Genio in a press release.</seg>
<seg id="11">This warms up the surface and produces rain that creates a thick layer of clouds, which acts like a umbrella to shield the surface of much of the sun heat.</seg>
<seg id="12">The result is average temperatures, which are some degrees cooler than that of the Earth today.</seg>
<seg id="13">The model produced a history of Venus that resembles evolution that was previously thought by planets researches.</seg>
<seg id="14">Although it was presumably habitable, Venus was exposed to too much heat and ultraviolet light over the course of several billions of years.</seg>
<seg id="15">Her oceans evaporated and her water vapor was burned away from ultraviolet light.</seg>
<seg id="16">As their hydrogenesis, only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide remained with a deadly greenhouse effect -- Venus, as we know it today.</seg>

<seg id="1">Olympia 2016: chen Xinyi, Silwia Danekova and Adrian Zielinski are first doping cases</seg>
<seg id="2">Caught: because of a positive doping probe, weightlifter Adrian Zielinski from Poland may not start in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="3">Rio de Janeiro - The 2016 Olympic Games will be overshadowed by the first official doping cases.</seg>
<seg id="4">A caught athlete would have gained almost a medal.</seg>
<seg id="5">Before the seventh competition day, the first official doping attacks have become the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro.</seg>
<seg id="6">The Chinese swimmers Chen Xinyi, 3000-meter obstacle course in Silwia Danekova from Bulgaria and Polish weight lifters Adrian Zielinski were positively tested and excluded - immediately before the start of the already critically treated athletics competition, these messages come to an end.</seg>
<seg id="7">Chen has already been the diuretic hydrochlorothiazide, which is used as a mask for doping substances last Sunday.</seg>
<seg id="8">On Friday afternoon, the International Sports Court CAS confirmed its exclusion from the Olympic Games on Friday afternoon.</seg>
<seg id="9">On Sunday the 18-year-old had occupied the fourth place in the final over 100 m of butterfly, only at 0.09 seconds she missed the bronze medal.</seg>
<seg id="10">On Friday, Chen should have participated in the precursors over 50 m of Freestyle.</seg>
<seg id="11">Chen applied for the opening of the B-sample and a hearing at the International Olympic Committee (IOC).</seg>
<seg id="12">"" "the national association takes the matter" "" "very seriously and demands full cooperation with the investigations," "" "quoted Xinhua from a message:" "" "we will work together with the International Sports Court CAS and will accept the judgment." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="13">For the first time in history it is no longer the IOC, but the CAS is responsible for the sanctionation of athletes with positive cases.</seg>
<seg id="14">Also during the night of Rio, the news about the positive rehearsal was by Danekova, the 33-year-old went to the offensive.</seg>
<seg id="15">"" "" "" "I had three tests, all negative, and my fourth test was positive," "" "this was" "" "an unbelievable shock" "", "she said to the Bulgarian TV channel BNT." ""</seg>
<seg id="16">"" "she is innocent," "" "the only explanation could be dietary supplements," "" "explained the athlete." ""</seg>
<seg id="17">According to the report, it is said that the banned substance is about the blood doping agent EPO.</seg>
<seg id="18">Danekova was provisionally suspended, according to BNT the B-Probe has already been positive.</seg>
<seg id="19">Bulgaria's Prime Minister Bojko Borissov reported immediately with criticism of the Bulletin.</seg>
<seg id="20">"I don't understand why sportsmen don't get the right conclusions," he said: "we are Bulgarians under observation, so many have been excluded."</seg>
<seg id="21">Thus, for example, all weightlifters from the chronic-doping nation must not take part in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="22">On Friday the case "Adrian Zielinski" was also known, the London Olympic champion in the class up to 85 kg was tested similar to his brother Tomasz three days previously on the anabolic steroid Nandrolon.</seg>
<seg id="23">Both theoretically deny taking, both may not start in class up to 94 kg.</seg>
<seg id="24">Before starting the athletes, Danekova is another serious blow for the reputation of the whole sport.</seg>
<seg id="25">The World Association IAAF had prohibited the entire Russian team except for systematic doping the start, even the nation nation Kenya produces numerous bad news in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="26">In the swimming sport, the past trials in China also had caused a sharp confrontation between the athletes.</seg>
<seg id="27">So the Frenchman Camille Lacourt attacked the Chinese Olympic champion Sun Yang harsch.</seg>
<seg id="28">"" "" "" "sun Yang pinkelt purple" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="29">"" "" "" "if I see the podium over 200 m of Freestyle, I want to hand over," "" "said Lacourt in the French radio." ""</seg>
<seg id="30">Sun was also at the heart of a confrontation with the Australian Mack Horton.</seg>
<seg id="31">"" "" "" "I have no time and no respect for doping fraud," "" "said this." ""</seg>
<seg id="32">Sun was positively tested in the Chinese championships on the stimulant's Trimetazidine, but only had to sit down a three-month lock.</seg>

<seg id="1">Data klau: so perfide blackmail hackers their ransom</seg>
<seg id="2">Programmers from blackmail malware have targeted businesses - and are successful in doing so.</seg>
<seg id="3">According to a recent survey by malware specialists Malwarebytes among 540 companies in North America, Great Britain and Germany, 40 percent of respondents surveyed over the past twelve months at least once, partially multiple victims of an attack with blackmail software.</seg>
<seg id="4">Euromonitor International has over 30 years experience of publishing market research reports, business reference books and online information systems.</seg>
<seg id="5">40 per cent of the victims paid willingly the ransom salaries demanded by the perpetrators to use the challenged systems and data again.</seg>
<seg id="6">The perpetrators specialize their blackmailing software, according to the observations of Malwarebytes, on attacks in company networks.</seg>
<seg id="7">If they are successful there, the potential for redeeming ransom is significantly higher than in private users.</seg>
<seg id="8">"we are currently watching a scary fast evolution of the malware," explains Malwarebytes boss Marcin Kleczynski in conversation with the "world."</seg>
<seg id="9">In 2008 most of the painting programmes were designed to send advertisements.</seg>
<seg id="10">Then the perpetrators discovered the blackmail software for itself.</seg>
<seg id="11">First, private users were the target, but the change to corporate attacks took place in the past few months.</seg>
<seg id="12">Ransomware works after a simple pattern: once active on the computer of a victim, it searches for recently changed files such as Word, Excel or Database files as well as archives of images and videos.</seg>
<seg id="13">These files encrypt the ransomware and deletes the originals.</seg>
<seg id="14">Subsequently, the software presents the demands of the blackpress.</seg>
<seg id="15">To get the final key code to the files, the victims must transfer money - mostly in the form of cryptocurrencies Bitcoin.</seg>
<seg id="16">However, where private users are using the personal photo database on the game, companies are concerned with sensitive customer data or project databases without which the production is shut down.</seg>
<seg id="17">Accordingly, the damage occurs when a ransomware fails.</seg>
<seg id="18">22 per cent of the affected German companies reported sales losses due to ransomware, 13 per cent had to break the business completely, in one case people were in danger of life.</seg>
<seg id="19">In Germany there were already several hospitals victims of attacks, whose patients can be threatened by the loss of medical records.</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "" "" "we always say the victims:" "" "don't pay, you only support the problem," "" "says Kleczynski." ""</seg>
<seg id="21">However, 80 to 90 percent of companies who pay, get their data again.</seg>
<seg id="22">"" "" "" "it is difficult for managers to reject the demands of the perpetrators in the face of downtime." ""</seg>
<seg id="23">The hacker again know that and try everything to build a good reputation.</seg>
<seg id="24">In a recent study, the F-Secure Security researchers examined the land-occupied areas and contact with the presses and come to the result: the perpetrators are actually trying to build a kind of customer service to get more money.</seg>
<seg id="25">They explain their sacrifices via chat on how to pay per Bitcoin, set free accessible support websites or decrypt for free example files.</seg>
<seg id="26">And will be redeemed private individuals after payments of a few hundred euros, companies have to negotiate partly hard and pay five-digit sums to retrieve their data unencrypted.</seg>
<seg id="27">In view of the potentially high and relatively risky gains from ransomware blackmail, the hackers become more and more professional and share the work, declares security expert Chester Wisniewski from the Antivirus vendor SOPHOS: "a single person can write a ransomware roughly within a week."</seg>
<seg id="28">However, it is more likely that it is about three or four people.</seg>
<seg id="29">The programmers sell their damage software then in the form of a software construction kit to the actual blackpress.</seg>
<seg id="30">The malware kits have been developed by malware, providing advice and additional tools for a single, fixed price between 1000 and 10,000 dollars.</seg>
<seg id="31">"included in delivery is an adaptation tool, so that smaller configurations, appearance and branding can be changed," says Wisniewski.</seg>
<seg id="32">The presses then look for further hackers in order to spread the freshly purchased software among the victims.</seg>
<seg id="33">We live in a service sector.</seg>
<seg id="34">Thus one logs in one of the forums in the underground, buys the set of a criminal and commissioned one more to install the software on as many PCs as possible.</seg>
<seg id="35">The payment is effected per infected computer.</seg>
<seg id="36">"" "" "" "usually the criminals then apply spammers with the spread," "" "declares Wisniewski." ""</seg>
<seg id="37">The risk of ransomware is now known by many companies that better secure their data.</seg>
<seg id="38">More than 50 percent of the companies IT leaders in the Malwarebytes survey trust to be able to avert ransomware via file-back-ups and scanner software.</seg>
<seg id="39">Accordingly, the perpetrators are already pursuing new strategies.</seg>
<seg id="40">"" "" "" "if the encryption of data alone is not a sufficient threat to successful recovery, the perpetrators are threatening to release sensitive data such as customer lists or price calculations," "" "explains Malwarebytes boss Marcin Kleczynski." ""</seg>
<seg id="41">This means that the potential for damages depends on the type of data still much higher than before.</seg>
<seg id="42">In the future, the perpetrators could have completely new goals on the internet of things in the future.</seg>
<seg id="43">On the Hackerkonferenz Defcon, safety researchers demonstrated how to control a thermostat that was connected to the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="44">In the middle of winter, the activation of such blocked heat could certainly be worth a ransom.</seg>
<seg id="45">If the offenders then block a whole production line in a factory instead of heating in the future, Ransomware could also be a topic in Industry 4.0.</seg>

<seg id="10">The trunk can be loaded easily, but the loading height of 650 mm is slightly higher than with the comparable Peugeot 2008.</seg>
<seg id="11">The tested 1.6-l diesel with 88 kW / 120 hp accelerates the HR-V thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm in wide speed ranges.</seg>

<seg id="23">But the full connectivity is only available for the top features: 7-inch touch screen, navi, app integration and more.</seg>
<seg id="24">Two USB and one HDMI socket are under the armrest and are therefore a bit awkward to achieve.</seg>
<seg id="25">The approximately 29000 euros for the well-equipped top diesel are fine.</seg>

<seg id="2">It stumps regularly on the bypass road - here's a picture of November.</seg>
<seg id="3">But this should change: the rule of law shall be prolonged.</seg>
<seg id="4">This is a good news for all car drivers who are standing in traffic on the environmental street every night in the traffic jam when they drive over the motorway exit Zubringer (A 43).</seg>

<seg id="8">The idea of the extended exit had the CDU faction in the district of Münster-West.</seg>

<seg id="1">Relaxing Night: tips for Sleeping Disorders</seg>
<seg id="2">In the evening you are rolled around forever, at night you are awake for hours, in the morning it's far from the wake of the wake of the wake of the wake.</seg>
<seg id="3">This is anything but relaxing.</seg>
<seg id="4">After all, with such problems in good company: according to the Robert Koch Institute, about a quarter of adult sleep disorders and more than ten percent feel their sleep frequently or permanently than not relaxing.</seg>
<seg id="5">How do sleeping problems or sleep disturbances?</seg>
<seg id="6">There are several forms of sleep disorders, and there can be many reasons underlying them, emphasizes Hans-Günter Weeß, Member of the German Society for Schlaffing and Sleep Medicine.</seg>
<seg id="7">What one understands, however, is the insomnia, i.e. an entry and sleep disorder.</seg>
<seg id="8">Many people feel as unsatisfactory or inadequate, says Jens Wagenknecht, member of the German Hauser Association with practice in Lower Saxony.</seg>
<seg id="9">What is behind sleep disorders?</seg>
<seg id="10">The causes of sleep disorders are complex.</seg>
<seg id="11">Behind it, organic, mental or behavioural factors, but also drugs are stuck.</seg>
<seg id="12">Infrequently, insomnia is an expression of another disease.</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "" "" "very early awakening is common in case of depression," "" "says Weeß." ""</seg>
<seg id="14">And it can be that various factors would like each other.</seg>
<seg id="15">For example, those who have a herniated disc can lie down badly, wakes up every two to three hours and probably starts to pondering about everyday problems and worries, Weeß gives an example.</seg>
<seg id="16">This leads to tension, and sleep is no longer possible.</seg>
<seg id="17">When should I contact a doctor?</seg>
<seg id="18">Anyone who does not sleep well over a period of one month or at least three nights per week should go to the doctor, advises weeß.</seg>
<seg id="19">The impairment may look quite different: one is downcast, tired, ingested, has difficulties with attention and concentration, is easily irritable, has mood swings or bodily discomfort such as stomach or headache.</seg>
<seg id="20">To alleviate sleeping disorder, it is important to find out their causes.</seg>
<seg id="21">The treatment options include behavioural changes, cognitive behavioural therapy or medicines - classical sleeping pills only in exceptional cases and at most for two weeks - inquire.</seg>
<seg id="22">Prof. Ingo Fietze, head of the Interdisciplinary Center of the Charité University Medicine Berlin, is scarcely abandoned in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="23">Therefore, in case of sleep problems one should first turn to the house doctor, advises weeß.</seg>
<seg id="24">This can be clarified with investigations whether the problems have a physical cause.</seg>
<seg id="25">Who should go to sleep laboratory, and what happens?</seg>
<seg id="26">For example, for examination in the sleep laboratory, for example in snoring with breathing apparatus, in case of mortibility, in sleeping-converters or if one does not find the cause of a breakdown disorder, Fietze explains.</seg>
<seg id="27">You don't have to prepare for the examination.</seg>
<seg id="28">You should spend the day normally.</seg>
<seg id="29">"" "" "" "please do not make a midday sleep," "" "says Fietze." ""</seg>
<seg id="30">After the tastings, one goes to bed at his usual time.</seg>
<seg id="31">In addition to the electrodes on the body, one carries a nasal mask, a chest strap and a feeler on the finger.</seg>
<seg id="32">In addition, a camera records the sleeping-end at the ceiling.</seg>
<seg id="33">How can sufferers get a grip on the problems?</seg>
<seg id="34">There are quite a lot of adjusting screws on which one can set for a better sleep.</seg>
<seg id="35">Weeß counts on: regular sleeping and recording times, not too long in bed, do not sleep on the day, do not watch TV for falling asleep, avoid alcohol and not watch the watch at night - then you start to calculate immediately, and that's all and not conducive.</seg>

<seg id="1">What the jungle camp with missing medals in swimming</seg>
<seg id="2">The former German swimmer Markus Deibler has expressed himself via Facebook to disappointing the DSV team at Olympis.</seg>
<seg id="3">In December 2014 he obtained gold for the first time in Doha for the first time in Doha, while at the same time he presented his first world record.</seg>
<seg id="4">Now the former DSV-Athlete Markus Deibler has placed himself in front of his ex-team colleagues on Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="5">"" "" "" "in a country where an Olympic champion gets 20.000 €award and a jungle king 150,000 €shouldn't be surprised about missing medals," "" "the 26-year-old wrote on his Facebook page on Friday." ""</seg>
<seg id="6">The conveyor system in swimming-sports is bad, the doping controls on the other hand are very good.</seg>
<seg id="7">"" "" "" "with this, we cannot compete with countries who promote a great deal and do not see or even operate in the subject of doping." ""</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "" "" "I don't tell you to set the controls here," "" "he continued." ""</seg>
<seg id="9">If he wanted to start a comeback, Deibler would have to be announced nine months before his first launch of the National Anti-Doping Agency (NADA).</seg>
<seg id="10">This is exactly what you should do with countries too.</seg>
<seg id="11">"who cannot control a certain time before WM / OS of independent controllers of WADA / FINA must not take part," says the choice-hamburger, who meanwhile operates an ice cream parlor.</seg>

<seg id="1">Old buildings, some lime ponds, interlaced by a rest of the cobblestone pavings: the Rīga Street in Berlin-Friedrichshain does not seem like at first sight, but the police is one of the "dangerous places" of the city.</seg>
<seg id="2">If one goes along the road from east to west, one passes on playgrounds, a newly painted kindergarten and a bioladen.</seg>
<seg id="3">"" "on the façade of a grey house someone has sprayed" "" "ugly!" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="4">Compared to a Lidl, which is to be demolished soon, a house with high windows and 133 new flats will be built here until 2017.</seg>
<seg id="5">Article about this "trendy district," as the competent real estate company Friedrichshain calls, will, however, be preferred by burning cars in recent weeks.</seg>
<seg id="6">Reason is the house with number 94: once it was occupied, meanwhile the residents have rent contracts, but on the ground floor there are still rooms occupied and are used for events.</seg>
<seg id="7">"" "since the beginning of the year, especially the Berlin Interior Minister Henkel has been calling for a tough police action against the project, the area referred to as" "" "No-Go-Zone" "" "for policemen and the 94 as the starting point of autonomous violence." ""</seg>
<seg id="8">On June 22, the rooms on the ground floor, the Kadterschmiede, had been evacuated with 300 police officers, the police advised three weeks of official statements with 30 to 40 officials and three crew trucks on site, locked parts of the road and stopped visitors from entering the house with number 94.</seg>
<seg id="9">Meanwhile, renovated building workers commissioned the premises of the unknown owners.</seg>
<seg id="10">On 13 July, a Berlin Administrative Court decided that the clearance was illegal, and a day later, police and building workers went under the cheers of sympathizers and residents.</seg>
<seg id="11">On this summer afternoon the street works peacefully: parents walk with children, people sit on the sidewalk in front of the houses in the sun, others entertain vorm Späti.</seg>
<seg id="12">In the immediate vicinity of the house projects there is a primary school and kindergartens.</seg>
<seg id="13">Left violence is not the main concern of many residents: Kerstin Neugebauer, who since 1999 lives in Kiez, and Jana *, who is raising three children here, are mainly generated by the police presence.</seg>
<seg id="14">With the inhabitants of the house projects, they share the concern for increasing rent and gentrification.</seg>
<seg id="15">It does not sound like a Kiez who wanted to make a majority of police plaster against vandalous leftists.</seg>
<seg id="16">"" "" "" "the ditch, which the Berlin inner senator and the police between house occupants and their neighbors arise, does not exist." ""</seg>
<seg id="17">"" "" "" "Friedrichshain in the east of Berlin was actually a traditional" "" "working-class" "" "district, which also today has a low average income and a high risk of poverty in comparison with the rest of the city." ""</seg>
<seg id="18">In 1990, many houses were occupied in the former GDR, including almost the entire Mainzer street close to the Riga.</seg>
<seg id="19">While the Mainzer was cleared under large police panes in a regular street battle, many of the projects were legalized in the Riga and are still inhabited by the people who had occupied it 26 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="20">At the same time, the neighborhood has become increasingly a magnet for tourists and polliners from around the world over the past few years. residents from GDR times and former domestic occupiers are now sharing their neighborhood with them.</seg>
<seg id="21">This is reflected in the rent, which has increased by nearly 60 per cent since 2009.</seg>
<seg id="22">Many of the new buildings in the Rīga are attacked as symbols for this development: one recognizes them on inserted slices or newly painted facades that were discarded with dyes.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "no other road was mentioned this year together with the words" "" "left autonomous violence" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="24">One reason why not all neighbors look at this as a problem could be that they are not necessarily affected by crime: crimes like body injury are almost exclusively directed against policemen.</seg>
<seg id="25">Most of the offences make damage to property, which tend to meet the newbuildings and newly renovated houses.</seg>
<seg id="26">For Kerstin Neugebauer, who lives in a rented house for 17 years in addition to controversial 94, uncertainty can be no talk of uncertainty.</seg>
<seg id="27">As for acts of violence, it is more important: the people in the 94 are their neighbors, who are not sure.</seg>
<seg id="28">Also the famous combustible cars are no longer in Riga anymore.</seg>
<seg id="29">For the studied architect, her street is not a criminal focus, on the contrary: "here one helps one another, lives together on the road and gets more from each other than elsewhere."</seg>
<seg id="30">Neugebauer is deliberately pulled into the Riga Road - and stayed.</seg>
<seg id="31">That is why it was so important that the residents get their road back: from the police, politics and the media, which in July all of the sudden demanded the certainty of the city.</seg>
<seg id="32">But in the eyes of residents such as Neugebauer, the road continues to be taken away: by obtrusive reconstructions in former mosquitoes that displace the old inhabitants.</seg>
<seg id="33">"" "" "" "these are actually condominiums that are not interesting for many - here are rather people who are not so well-called" "", "she says." ""</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "" "" "I absolutely cannot guise violence and destruction." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="35">But what should we do if someone never listens to someone?</seg>
<seg id="36">There is frustration on all sides, even with the police and the inhabitants.</seg>
<seg id="37">Kerstin Neugebauer has little understanding for zodized ripped over colour bombs: the skin projects and the left scene belonged to the Kiez.</seg>
<seg id="38">Who pulls, should be aware of it - just like someone who pulls into a pub quarter that can complain about noise.</seg>
<seg id="39">All persons identified only with first names are asked to not be called with their correct name</seg>

<seg id="2">Annika Deuschle is the contact person for integration and organizer.</seg>
<seg id="3">She is also a social worker on the spot.</seg>
<seg id="4">Annika Deuschle has been the Refugee Officer for Urbach since July.</seg>
<seg id="5">The social pedagogue supports the team of management by Achim Grockenberger.</seg>
<seg id="6">She sees himself as a contact partner for all actors: refugees, workgroup refugee assistance, administration, authorities and who else.</seg>
<seg id="7">Regine customer from the working group indicates that the volunteers are more than grateful that Deuschle is now there, the egg-imposed volition mildew, which above all has a problem.</seg>
<seg id="8">Thus, some - less mocking than rather focused on the variety of tasks in question - meant when administration wanted to write the job.</seg>
<seg id="9">Looking for an administrative domain with a talent for languages and people, connected with a long-standing experience in the field of social work, just an enforced volition of wool.</seg>
<seg id="10">But administrative work is not their central area, writes Annika Deuschle.</seg>
<seg id="11">Above all, it is about organization, work with local people and behind the scenes as well as network activity.</seg>
<seg id="12">The 31-year-old has been there for about six weeks.</seg>
<seg id="13">It has limited a 50 percent position for three years.</seg>
<seg id="14">"" "" "" "it was high time," "" "says Regine customer that Annika Deuschle supports honorary and full-time players." ""</seg>
<seg id="15">There are big and small problems, organizational, human and communication problems.</seg>
<seg id="16">Soon there are new containers in the Wasenstraße</seg>
<seg id="17">It has been a serious problem for some time to find apartments for the connecting refugees that have been recognized.</seg>
<seg id="18">The municipalities are responsible for the connection.</seg>
<seg id="19">"" "" "" "they need to accommodate the refugees in their own or hired premises." ""</seg>
<seg id="20">The costs of construction, rent or refurbishment of these accommodation must bear the municipalities themselves.</seg>
<seg id="21">The responsibility changes from the Landratsamt to Commune and Jobcenter.</seg>
<seg id="22">Problem: there are free objects, but not every landlord wants to offer his apartment.</seg>
<seg id="23">The search has been very difficult for some time.</seg>
<seg id="24">De facto does not find the administration of private apartments.</seg>
<seg id="25">So far, it does not work, however, one relies on private apartments, so Deuschle.</seg>
<seg id="26">Therefore, common flats must be visited as it is so beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="27">So soon new containers will be set up in the Wasenstraße.</seg>
<seg id="28">But only with dwellings it is not done.</seg>
<seg id="29">Perspective is the keyword, Regine customers and Annika Deuschle agree.</seg>
<seg id="30">In addition to a permanent place of stay, there are internships, training places, training places, one-euro jobs and training activities for refugees and migrants who need to be undone or set up.</seg>
<seg id="31">"more places would be good," reported Regine customer.</seg>
<seg id="32">Many work in the building yard or help homework, do charitable work - and that motivates and very neat as Annika Deuschle reports.</seg>
<seg id="33">She hopes that the work for the community will lead to a positive external effect.</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "this is" "" "no employment therapy." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="35">But activity does not mean only work.</seg>
<seg id="36">The day needs a solid structure, say Deuschle and customer.</seg>
<seg id="37">People would have to develop a sense of belonging.</seg>
<seg id="38">So it needs offers like sport, contacts with local people and especially language courses.</seg>
<seg id="39">Professional courses are rare.</seg>
<seg id="40">So also, administration and volunteers are also jumping here.</seg>
<seg id="41">"" "" "" "it is central that the refugees get the feeling they are welcome and welcome in Germany." ""</seg>
<seg id="42">The long duration of the procedures is a problem.</seg>
<seg id="43">They need to explain the refugees that it just takes and they can bridge the time wisely, for example with language courses.</seg>
<seg id="44">Whoever develops the feeling, he couldn't help anyone in Urbach, should not work and be unprofitable, he will never be able to integrate himself.</seg>
<seg id="45">The clear majority is motivated.</seg>
<seg id="46">But there are also problem cases, "says customer honestly," people with whom nothing goes. "therefore, the work of Deuschle and customer is always to motivate others.</seg>
<seg id="47">"" "all this is already a" "" "mammoth task" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="48">A difficult question: do the two have fear of radicalization, even in a small community like Urbach?</seg>
<seg id="49">"" "" "" "no," "" "says Regine customer quite clearly," "" "what some might call naive" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="50">But the helpers are already sensitised.</seg>
<seg id="51">These incidents are also subject to refugees.</seg>
<seg id="52">They would have the fear that the assassinations brought them completely.</seg>
<seg id="53">"" "" "" "they want to show that they have nothing to do with it," "" "says Regine customer." ""</seg>
<seg id="54">Many would like to stay in Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="55">"" "" "" "so the local and local volunteers must look out for activities in the region and in the region." ""</seg>
<seg id="56">They always have in the background that soon a new blow to refugees and migrants could come to Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="57">Does Germany need an upper limit?</seg>
<seg id="58">To answer this question clearly, politics shouted.</seg>
<seg id="59">Actually, it is unfair to place them helpers on site.</seg>
<seg id="60">"" "" "" "in Urbach we have not arrived yet where we want to go," "" "says Annika Deuschle." ""</seg>
<seg id="61">No new refugees, that would relax the situation.</seg>
<seg id="62">Regine customer also makes it clear that the Urbacher is already busy to integrate the existing people wisely.</seg>
<seg id="63">These are currently around 100 people, mostly young men.</seg>
<seg id="64">But when people are in need, they must help them, both women agree.</seg>
<seg id="65">The political world situation is so complicated, there are no simple answers.</seg>
