Obama receives Net@@ any@@ ahu
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu is not very friendly .
the two wanted to talk about the implementation of the international agreement and Te@@ hr@@ an &apos;s dest@@ ab@@ ili@@ ating measures in the Middle East .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the meeting , however , it should also be about the conflict with the Palestinians and the two @-@ state solution . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu has been ten@@ sed for years .
Washington den@@ oun@@ ces the continuing housing construction of Israel and thro@@ ws Net@@ any@@ ahu &apos;s lack of will for the peace process .
the deal between the two continues to deteri@@ or@@ ate with Obama &apos;s deal around the Iranian nuclear program .
in March Net@@ any@@ ahu at the invitation of the Re@@ public@@ ans in front of the U.S. Congress held a controversi@@ al speech , which was partially regarded as an aff@@ ront to Obama .
the speech was not talked with Obama , a meeting had rejected this election in Israel with reference to the time imm@@ in@@ ent .
in an emergency call professor to have shot his girl@@ friend
in an emergency call Professor Sh@@ ann@@ on Lamb was telling a somewhat z@@ itt@@ y voice of the police that he shot his girl@@ friend and that the officials had to come to his house .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Lamb was important to empha@@ size that his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sweet dog &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but still live and probably be excited , and he said that the family contacts of dead woman could be found on the phone . &quot; &quot; &quot;
inside the house , the officers found the cor@@ p@@ ses of Amy Pre@@ ent@@ iss and a hand@@ written note that had been put on a white block : &quot; I &apos;m sorry , I could undo it , I loved Amy and she is the only woman who ever loved me . &quot; this was signed by the authorities in the letter , and he was signed by Lamb .
there was no indication that Lamb , who was in two online courses for the Delta State University in Cle@@ vel@@ and , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , had already travelled 300 miles to the school grounds , where he was shot and killed by the police a popular historical professor , E@@ than Schmidt , at the door to his office .
Delta State University Poli@@ chn@@ ef Lyn@@ n Bu@@ ford said that university staff heard the shooting at 10 : 18 clock .
he said that Lamb has made the disast@@ rous emergency call some@@ time afterwards .
until the end of the day there was another death : Lamb took the life when the police en@@ gros@@ sed him .
one day after the shooting at the university , the students and teachers forced to hide behind closed doors , the authorities still try to get a picture of what Lamb motiv@@ ates .
the details published by the investig@@ ators at both ends of the state , as well as what students and employees who knew him , helped to draw a picture of a talented , but possibly difficult teacher .
students said they were looking forward to their lessons .
the police in G@@ auti@@ er , where Pr@@ ent@@ iss died , said , he did not have a history of violence or a criminal record .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Schmidt himself mentioned Lamb in a book written by him in which he mentioned the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wonderful people &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with whom he shared his academic life . &quot; &quot; &quot;
both are taught in the Department of Social Sciences and History , whose faculty comprises 17 members , and many students visited courses of both .
at the same time , there were some incl@@ inations on problem@@ atic behavi@@ ours .
a student , Brand@@ on Be@@ a@@ vers , the Lamb praised , said , he also seemed a little nervous and nervous , &quot; as if something was wrong with him . &quot;
another student , Mik@@ el Sy@@ kes , said that he told him that he had to deal with stress at the end of the academic year 2014 @-@ 15 .
Lamb had previously asked the Delta State University for health reasons and said he has any health problem .
this year he only taught two online courses .
recent changes in the employment policy of the university meant that the doc@@ torate , for which Lamb had worked so hard , would not give him a guarantee for an automatic route to an employment as Assistant Professor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; University president William LA@@ FOR@@ GE said he didn &apos;t know anything about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs &apos;s performance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these are questions that Lamb can no longer answer .
after the escape from the campus , the police later found Lam@@ bs lane when he came back into Miss@@ issi@@ ppi from Ar@@ kan@@ sas .
before being arrested , Lamb killed himself with a .@@ 38 cali@@ ber gun in the back@@ yard of a house about a mile south of his home on the outskirts of Green@@ ville , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , said Washington County Cor@@ oner Meth@@ el Johnson .
his car still ran in the dri@@ ve@@ way .
it was not immediately clear why lamb went to this house , but Johnson said that he knew that he knew people who lived there .
Lamb grew up in the area .
Lamb started working at the university in 2009 , which has 3,@@ 500 students in a city with about 12,@@ 000 inhabitants , and taught ge@@ ography and ped@@ agog@@ y .
he received his doc@@ torate in the spring of ped@@ agog@@ y .
one of the long @-@ standing friends lam@@ bs described him as intelligent , char@@ ism@@ atic and funny .
Car@@ la H@@ air@@ ston said she was 15 and he was 20 when they met through common friends .
she and her friends were in high school , and he was the cool old guy who tried several years to teach her the guitar playing .
he was the black man at that time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; all girls mol@@ ten away when he was there , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said H@@ air@@ ston , now 40 and in the Jackson &apos;s suburbs of Brand@@ on . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Lamb and Pr@@ ent@@ iss were obviously some time together .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Lamb &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have killed my wife , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but there was no document of a marriage . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they had a dog called Light@@ ning , who lived with them in the brick house that borders on a ba@@ you in G@@ auti@@ er .
the police said that the dog was fine .
the ex @-@ husband of Pr@@ ent@@ iss , Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , said they were divor@@ ced 15 years ago , but friends stayed and had a daughter who was 19 years old now .
&quot; she was totally destroyed on the ground , &quot; said O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en about his daughter .
she and her mother were absolutely best friends .
O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said he never met Lamb but by his daughter Ab@@ ig@@ ail he heard that Lamb was interested in music and played blues .
Lamb hit Pr@@ ent@@ iss when he and Ab@@ ig@@ ail appeared both on a summer fair three years ago .
later they played together with one or another gig .
O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said his daughter writes and sings her own music .
Pr@@ ent@@ iss was a nur@@ se who worked for different companies online .
Mike Sha@@ ffer , a bar@@ ke@@ eper and sometimes entertainment coordin@@ ator at The Ju@@ le@@ p Room , a weak lit bar close to G@@ auti@@ er , said that he was Lamb and Pr@@ ent@@ iss Night at night 5 September for the last time he finished his guitar and mouth organ finished before a spar@@ se audience .
there was no sign that something was wrong .
&quot; just a happy couple , &quot; he said .
we were in the clearing and talked with each other .
I mean they both had a good sense of jo@@ ke .
Schmidt , the dead professor , conducted the first semester program and speci@@ alizes in American native people and colonial history , said Don Allan Mit@@ ch@@ ell , an English professor at school .
he was married and had three small children .
he studied at the Emp@@ oria State University in Kan@@ sas and was president of his bro@@ therhood and student committee .
on Tuesday evening about 900 people , including teachers , employees , students and members of the community participated in a candle light memorial service on the Delta State campus in Cle@@ vel@@ and .
&quot; &quot; &quot; mid@@ ts Ms Li@@ z and his brother Jeff Schmidt also participated in the M@@ ahn@@ wei@@ che , while the university choir sang &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; B@@ right Mor@@ ning Star &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; Ama@@ zing Grace . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the lessons will be resum@@ ed on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we try to move our students to return , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said LA@@ FOR@@ GE . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the crisis is over .
this is a day of healing .
Amy and Ro@@ gel@@ io Soli@@ s reported Cle@@ vel@@ and , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi .
associated Press writers E@@ mil@@ y Wag@@ ster P@@ ett@@ us in Green@@ ville , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , and Rebecca Sant@@ ana in New Orleans contributed to this report .
this story was corrected to reflect that the police now says that Lamb made the emergency call after he had shot Schmidt , and that Lamb signed Pr@@ ent@@ iss as his wife in his emergency call , but there is no indication that the two have ever married .

Michael J. Fox tells about his &quot; Date &quot; with Princess Diana
&quot; &quot; &quot; the premiere of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Back to the Future &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was a big moment for Michael J. Fox . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was also remarkable for personal reasons .
&quot; we sat in the theater wait for the Roy@@ als , and I noticed that the seat next to me is empty , and it gradually becomes clear to me that Princess Diana will sit next to me , &quot; he said in a trailer for an upcoming documentary &quot; Back in Time . &quot;
the film begins , and it comes to mind that I am a sim@@ ulated g@@ äh@@ nen and an arm @-@ length away from being with the prin@@ cess of Wales at a date .
&quot; back in Time , &quot; a documentary about &quot; Back to the Future , &quot; presents interviews with Fox , Le@@ a Thom@@ p@@ son and Christopher Lloyd , as well as with director Robert Z@@ em@@ eck@@ is and producer Steven Spiel@@ berg .
&quot; back for the Future &quot; had pre@@ mier@@ ed 30 years ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it really is for me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Spiel@@ berg , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Un@@ str@@ it@@ tig the biggest time travel film ever fil@@ med &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; back in Time &quot; will be on VO@@ D , DVD and in selected cinem@@ as in October .
UN chief says there is no military solution in Syria
Secretary General Ban K@@ i @-@ moon says his response to Russia &apos;s enhanced military support for Syria : &quot; there is no military solution &quot; of the almost five @-@ year @-@ lasting conflict , and more weapons will only wor@@ sen violence and mis@@ ery for millions of people .
the UN Chief again calls on all parties , including the shared UN Security Council to unite and support inclusive negotiations on finding a political solution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the end of the meeting , a press conference held on Wednesday that he plans to meet the Foreign Ministers of the five permanent member nations of the Council - USA , Russia , China , Great Britain and France - at the edge of the meeting of the General Assembly in this month to discuss the situation in Syria . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he regre@@ ts that the spl@@ its in the Council and within the Syrian people and the regional powers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; make this situation dis@@ sol@@ vable . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ban has called on the five permanent members to demonstrate the same solidarity and unity in tac@@ kling the crisis in Syria , which they have demonstrated in achieving a nuclear deal with Iran . &quot; &quot; &quot;
8 Re@@ qu@@ ests showing that Donald Tr@@ ump is serious .
some have tried to brand him as a flo@@ p .
others have dism@@ is@@ sed him as a jo@@ ke .
and some wait for a collapse .
but no matter how some re@@ public@@ ans try to draw Donald Tr@@ ump from the upper ranks when asking down , it has ( yet ) not working .
ten of the last eleven national surveys show Donald Tr@@ ump in the double @-@ digit area , and some begin to seriously wonder what it means for the chances of winning the real estate Mog@@ ula .
of course it is still too early in the election period .
nobody claims that Tr@@ ump will probably win the Republi@@ can nom@@ ination .
experts empha@@ size that at this time Rick Per@@ ry &apos;s leadership was handed over to the rising her@@ man C@@ ain , none of which won only one state in the nom@@ ination process .
and there are many reasons why he would have to fight in a general election .
but out@@ si@@ ders such as Je@@ b B@@ ush@@ s Super P@@ AC and the conservative economy group Club for Growth recognise TR@@ umps staying power and begin to let their dollars flow to overthrow him .
here are some current survey values that indicate that the real estate mo@@ gu@@ l is not only a temporary phase :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sn@@ ake popularity &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; values have turned 180 degrees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
just before Donald Tr@@ ump announced his can@@ did@@ acy mid @-@ June , a survey conducted by Mon@@ mouth University revealed that only two out of ten re@@ public@@ ans saw the real estate mo@@ gu@@ l in a positive way .
until mid @-@ July it was 40 percent .
in early August , it was 52 percent .
now six out of 10 re@@ public@@ ans have a positive view of Donald Tr@@ ump .
about three out of ten say they have a negative opinion .
and these figures are held in early states .
a Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac vote in I@@ owa concluded last week that 60 percent of the Republi@@ can have a good opinion of Tr@@ ump .
two thirds of GO@@ P vot@@ ers would be happy with Tr@@ ump as candidates .
in a CN@@ N / OR@@ C survey last week 67 percent of Re@@ public@@ ans said they were either &quot; thr@@ illed &quot; or &quot; satisfied &quot; when Tr@@ ump was nominated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; only two out of 10 , they would be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; angry &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if he were the candidate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
only Ben Car@@ son manages about the same enthusiasm as Tr@@ ump ( 43 percent say they were &quot; enthusiastic &quot; vs. 40 percent who say the same about dump ) .
the next one in terms of enthusiasm ?
Marco Ru@@ bio with only 21 percent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on the other hand , 47 per cent of the re@@ publi@@ can vot@@ ers say they &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dis@@ satisfied &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; anno@@ yed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if Je@@ b Bush , the favorite of the establishment , would be the candidate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a majority of the Re@@ public@@ ans do not see the g@@ umps temper@@ ament as a problem .
while Donald Tr@@ ump is widely critic@@ ised for his bom@@ b@@ astic and offensive statements , 52 percent of the Irish vot@@ ers ten@@ ding Irish vot@@ ers believe that the Real Estate Mo@@ gu@@ l has the right temper@@ ament to a president , such as ABC News / Washington Post on Monday .
the same number is valid in the first elec@@ toral state of the nation , the state of I@@ owa , where the same 52 percent of the re@@ public@@ ans think that he has the personality for a commander @-@ in @-@ chief , according to Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac last week .
nevertheless 44 percent think that he does not have the personality to effectively carry out his office , and almost six of ten in@@ depen@@ dents say that his temper@@ ament does not p@@ asse in the White House , so ABC / Post .
re@@ publi@@ can vot@@ ers get used to the idea .
if they set up their scholars , Republi@@ can vot@@ ers hold Tr@@ ump to real .
if they are asked who most likely wins the GO@@ P nom@@ ination , after a survey by CN@@ N / OR@@ C last week , four out of ten that Tr@@ ump was the best bet .
this is a change from the time when four out of ten out of July put their money on Je@@ b Bush .
complete disclosure : in the past GO@@ P vot@@ ers did not have the clear@@ est crystal ball .
at this time in the last cycle four out of ten re@@ public@@ ans thought that Rick Per@@ ry would win the nom@@ ination against just 28 % for the final candidate Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney .
however , it shows that a large number of GO@@ P vot@@ ers look at the campaign as plau@@ sible .
even if the re@@ public@@ ans gathered around another candidate , Tr@@ ump strikes almost everybody .
some experts point out that the fragmented field is likely to contribute to the short@@ est leadership while the anti @-@ Tr@@ ump support is distributed to more than a dozen other candidates .
but a survey conducted by Mon@@ mouth University in early September shows that in a hypo@@ the@@ tical head @-@ an @-@ head race between Tr@@ ump and most other re@@ publi@@ can candidates , Tr@@ ump re@@ ap the majority support .
he has 13 points ahead of Car@@ ly Fi@@ or@@ ina , ahead of Marco Ru@@ bio 14 points , ahead of Walker 15 points , before Je@@ b Bush 19 points and finally ahead of Paul , John Ka@@ ze and Chris Christ@@ ie 33 points .
it is a head @-@ at @-@ head race with T@@ ed Cruz .
the only candidate who suggests him ?
Ben Car@@ son would over@@ take the entrepren@@ eur with 19 points in a hypo@@ the@@ tical head @-@ to @-@ head race .
a scar@@ ce majority of Donald Tr@@ ump fans said they have formed their minds .
a new survey by C@@ BS / NY@@ T on Tuesday shows that only slightly more than half of the vot@@ ers who support Tr@@ ump have said that they have for@@ given their votes .
of course , much has happened to change that , and no one can really say never change the opinion .
46 percent said they leave the door open to switch to other candidates .
yet , the strongest competition in the moment is the other out@@ sider , the neuro@@ sur@@ geon Ben Car@@ son , but vot@@ ers who say they have formed their minds are twice as common for Tr@@ ump .
six out of 10 re@@ public@@ ans say they agree with Tr@@ ump in the topic of immigration .
&quot; &quot; &quot; since Donald Tr@@ ump in his election campaign called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rap@@ ist &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in his election campaign two months ago , the immigration clearance and fishing point was in the public discourse for 2016 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some are concerned that the bom@@ b@@ astic expression of Tr@@ ump will keep away crucial H@@ isp@@ ano Americans from the Republi@@ can Party and damage the re@@ orientation efforts .
but according to the new ABC / Post @-@ survey of Monday , six of ten re@@ public@@ ans say that they match Tr@@ ump in questions of immigration .
so long as the immigration is in the spot@@ light , Donald Tr@@ ump will obviously do it .
the fru@@ stration of the government climb@@ s new high@@ s .
with Donald Tr@@ ump and Ben Car@@ son , about half the support of re@@ publi@@ can vot@@ ers , above all through their out@@ sider status .
six out of 10 re@@ public@@ ans say in the new Monday survey of ABC / Post , they prefer a political out@@ sider as someone with government experience .
and they are also angry at Washington .
a survey conducted by Des Mo@@ ines Register / Blo@@ om@@ berg in I@@ owa two weeks ago shows that three of four I@@ owa re@@ public@@ ans are fru@@ str@@ ated over the re@@ public@@ ans at the Congress , with 54 percent &quot; dis@@ satisfied &quot; and 21 per cent &quot; hell@@ ish . &quot;
Munich , Sy@@ lt and Co . : the five most exclusive residential neighbor@@ hoods of Germany
here in the Hob@@ oo@@ ken@@ weg is the most expensive residential complex - with a view of the North Sea power .
in the street a square meter of a home roof costs € 7@@ 3.@@ 300 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Sy@@ lt the range of objects is limited naturally , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says it in the study - therefore the high price . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a new study shows , in which special locations a square meter costs the most .
of course , 18,@@ 70 euros per square meter for a student bu@@ de in Munich are not really little .
in contrast to Germany &apos;s top locations , however , one of the costs comes as pe@@ an@@ uts .
the real estate service provider Engel &amp; Völ@@ kers has published a ranking of the most exclusive German locations - with square met@@ ering prizes in vibr@@ ating heights .
there are several tens of thousands of Euro nix - per square meter , well @-@ marked .
but well , who can afford it ...
by the way : Munich is not at the top .
Champions League : Bayern @-@ Traum@@ start thanks to Müller and Gö@@ tze
two @-@ fold Tor@@ sch@@ ütze in Pir@@ aeus : Bavaria @-@ Star Thomas Müller has just one run .
a happy hits from Thomas Müller made the way to a deser@@ ved 3 : 0 at Olympi@@ ak@@ os Pir@@ aeus - then it ran .
a sovereign pre@@ lu@@ de to the Champions League season .
the world champion Thomas Müller and Mario Gö@@ tze have described the FC Bayern in the Hex@@ enk@@ es@@ sel of Pir@@ aeus a dream start into the &quot; Mission Milan . &quot;
the team of Trainer P@@ ep Gu@@ ardi@@ ola won her kick @-@ off in the Champions League at the Greek record master Olympi@@ ak@@ os in hot atmosphere thanks to Müll@@ ers Doppel@@ pack ( 5@@ 2. / 90@@ . + 2 ) and Gö@@ tz@@ es hits ( 89 . ) earned at 3 : 0 ( 0 : 0 ) .
the twel@@ fth starting success in series is to be the first step in the direction of Finale on 28 May 2016 in Italy , where Gu@@ ardi@@ ola finally wants to pick up the h@@ enk@@ el@@ pot@@ t to Munich in the third run .
Müller received his 28th hit in the Champions League at the Champions League for Bavaria leadership mun@@ er@@ ously donated by Olympi@@ ak@@ os @-@ Tor@@ wart Roberto , who caused a shot of the world champion as a flan@@ k .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will not under@@ estimate them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bavaria Captain Philipp Lah@@ m promised before the play in the Kar@@ ais@@ k@@ ak@@ is Stadium against 31.@@ 688 hot@@ ly fans - and the Munich word stopped . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they showed a concentrated and dedicated idea without shining .
Pir@@ aeus had won his youngest six home games in the Royal Class , among them well @-@ known clubs like Manchester United , At@@ l@@ é@@ tico Madrid or Ju@@ vent@@ us Turin .
in 2011 Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund also stum@@ bled here ( 1 : 3 ) .
but Bavaria , un@@ defeated in seven European ac@@ up du@@ els with Greek teams , did not want to be the next victim .
they went cour@@ age@@ ously , but often too resour@@ ce@@ ful to their offensive efforts .
the attacks were often introduced on the left outside of Douglas Costa , which was rare against the former Braunschwei@@ ger O@@ mar El@@ ab@@ d@@ ell@@ a@@ ou@@ i .
Müller had more luck from the right , when his flan@@ k was hit out of the right half @-@ field in the left upper corner of To@@ re@@ ck .
in the 67@@ th minute the World Master gave the possible 2 : 0 .
the best opportunities in half one had Robert Le@@ wand@@ owski .
at first , when Olympi@@ ak@@ os @-@ St@@ ür@@ mer ide@@ ye Brown proposed the head ball of Poland from the line ( 26 ) .
then by direct pick @-@ up , the go@@ al@@ ke@@ eper Roberto with the knee had par@@ ked ( 35@@ th ) .
although Bavaria with@@ drew its usual domin@@ antly game , Pir@@ aeus could set con@@ i@@ fers need@@ les .
but on door@@ ke@@ epers Manuel Neu@@ er , he was reli@@ eved .
so about when he drew a shot of Ide@@ ye about the Lat@@ te lenk@@ te ( 56@@ th ) .
before Neu@@ er Gu@@ ardi@@ ola ordered a four @-@ erk@@ ette with David Al@@ aba in the centre next to Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng which made it well .
Mario Gö@@ tze , after mus@@ cular problems back in the cad@@ re , first sat outside .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the World Cup hero gave the green light only after the final training , said sport@@ s@@ man Matthias Sam@@ mer at &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sky &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whoever wants to make something different from it is already mal@@ ign@@ ant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
also during the first change Gu@@ ardi@@ ola decided against him when he brought King@@ sle@@ y Com@@ an to the beaten Le@@ wand@@ owski ( 59@@ th ) .
Gö@@ tze arrived late for Ar@@ tur@@ o Vi@@ dal ( 76@@ th ) and made it clear 13 minutes later , by El@@ f@@ meter Müller still had one .
before the game it was in the stadium of Kra@@ w@@ allen .
after a smaller group of partially covered Bavaria fans apparently prov@@ oked the supporters of host Pir@@ aeus with words and gest@@ ures , the security forces attacked and went with bat@@ ons against the Munich trailer .
at least one Bayern @-@ Fan was viol@@ ated from the stadium .
who smo@@ kes , has a higher risk of losing teeth
who smo@@ kes , does not only harm the lung , but also the teeth - that puts a Pots@@ dam@@ er long @-@ term study .
the good news : at ren@@ unci@@ ation , the risk decreases quickly .
smo@@ kers have a significantly increased risk of losing their teeth early .
this emerg@@ es from the long @-@ term study of an international research team , including several employees of the German Institute for Nutrition Research ( DI@@ f@@ E ) in Potsdam .
compared to non @-@ smo@@ kers , smo@@ kers had the risk of losing their teeth pre@@ mat@@ urely to increase the 2,5@@ - to 3.6 fa@@ ders .
the scientists had watched over 23,@@ 300 participants .
the main causes of tooth loss are c@@ aries and inflamm@@ ations of the g@@ um , empha@@ sizes the DI@@ f@@ E .
for these peri@@ od@@ ont@@ itis smoking is a risk factor , empha@@ size the authors .
the connection between smoking and tooth loss is therefore reduced to frequent gin@@ gi@@ val infections in smo@@ kers .
it is not clar@@ ified whether smoking also increases the risk of c@@ aries .
&quot; &quot; &quot; people who stopped smoking could reduce their risk but within a short time , the researchers are in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Journal of Dental Research &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , it could take over ten years until the endanger@@ ing falls back to the level of non @-@ smo@@ kers , first author Thomas Dietrich explained by the English University Birmingham .
&quot; &quot; &quot; people must persu@@ ade people to be non @-@ smo@@ kers , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said study manager H@@ einer Bo@@ eing from DI@@ f@@ E : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; smoking reduces the lifetime of life . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
smoking is good for lungs and vessels and , according to our findings , leads to good dental health through to old age .
in Germany , more than 20 percent of the population at the age of 65 to 74 years of too@@ th@@ lessness have been affected by the DI@@ f@@ E .
earlier studies have already pointed out that smoking increases the risk of early tooth loss .
the new long @-@ term study under@@ lining the findings .

to shar@@ pen the dispute over the planned trans@@ atlan@@ tic free trade agreement T@@ TIP , the European Commission has proposed a comprehensive reform of the current arbit@@ ration system .
the controversi@@ al private sphere of arbit@@ ration for disputes between companies and states should therefore be replaced by a more transparent system , which in its function corresponds to more traditional dishes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to set up a system that citizens trust , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the responsible EU commission@@ er Ceci@@ lia Malm@@ ström in the performance . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Swe@@ de propos@@ es introducing the proposal as a European negoti@@ ating position in the free trade talks with the US .
the German government announced support .
T@@ TIP aims to create the largest free trade area in the world with 800 million people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the plans to reform the current arbit@@ ration proceedings suggests that the EU states and the US have jointly selected independent judges for a new investment plan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they should come from the EU , the US and from third countries . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the first time a second instance is planned .
it would allow it to be appe@@ aled against jud@@ gments .
so far , the parties involved agreed with each other to arbit@@ rators ; there was no obj@@ ection to their jud@@ gments against their jud@@ gments .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the discussion of recent months it has become clear that citizens don &apos;t trust the old IS@@ DS system in matters of fair@@ ness and justice , commented Malm@@ ström . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the long term , it wants to work on an International Investment Court according to its own specifications .
there might also be clar@@ i@@ fications between Chinese companies and EU countries , for example .
the Investor @-@ Sta@@ ats @-@ Sett@@ lement ( IS@@ DS ) called for large corporations above all apply as one of the main reasons for the great resistance in Europe against T@@ TIP .
the traditional arbit@@ ration courts are crit@@ ici@@ zed by opponents as a kind of parallel justice , enabling companies to ro@@ b damage to tax@@ pay@@ ers , lev@@ y national laws , or to cut down consumer and environmental standards .
in the first statements , anti @-@ T@@ TIP organizations like Camp@@ act identified the proposals of the European Commission as in@@ adequate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; above all , it is crit@@ ici@@ zed that they are not to apply to the already negoti@@ ated free trade agreement with Canada ( C@@ eta ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the other hand , the German economic state Secretary Matthias Mach@@ nig ( SPD ) , on the other hand , described the plans as a great advance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Commission takes into account the reform of essential points , which Mr Sig@@ mar Gabriel worked out in spring with other EU trade ministers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the old system of private arbit@@ ration is from the table .
the French government also welcomed Malm@@ ström &apos;s plans .
the European company BUS@@ IN@@ ES@@ S@@ EURO@@ PE warned against limit@@ ing the opportunities of the economy by too many new rules .
in this way , particularly small and medium @-@ sized enterprises could be dis@@ advant@@ aged .
when the talks on the T@@ TIP free trade agreement ( Tran@@ sat@@ lan@@ tic Trade and Investment Partnership ) can be concluded , un@@ clear remained un@@ clear on Wednesday .
the negotiations have been running since mid @-@ 2013 .
however , the topic of investor protection has not been discussed with the United States .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; originally a framework for the agreement should be at the end of this year . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this date is deemed to be no longer durable .
del@@ ik@@ ater Folk from Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens in Hamburg
eleven years ago Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens sits on stage at the Cologne Prime Club ( today : Lux@@ or ) .
next to him is a fli@@ p@@ chart , on which the timi@@ d acting folk singer has recorded the picturesque US state of Michigan with felt pen .
the entire audience , about 40 persons , is almost gr@@ asp@@ ed by St@@ ev@@ ens &apos;s lecture .
he tells of different places he always records on the map , about his min@@ u@@ ci@@ ously and tender arranged songs .
where they were born and how it looks , in his homeland .
since then , St@@ ev@@ ens proves to be a wonderful creative trav@@ eller .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with the 2003 and third album &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gre@@ etings from Michigan : the Great Lake State &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; clever composed songs seem harmon@@ ically very close to American folk of the late six@@ ties , but can always drift into great op@@ ul@@ ent tones . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the rum@@ our , &quot; Michigan , &quot; would be the first part of a delayed series : each of the 50 U.S. states would be con@@ sp@@ ic@@ uous .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but already in 2004 and near the Rhine , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Seven Sw@@ ans &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has already appeared and has positive expectations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
then , St@@ ev@@ ens will be reduced here .
live with him guitar and ban@@ jo .
one year later , the musician living in New York returns to the series .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Illinois &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens Inv@@ ites You To : come on Fe@@ el The Hits Franç@@ oise &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) , a nation@@ wide celebrated master@@ piece is published in 2005 . &quot; &quot; &quot;

the album climb@@ s up into the American b@@ ill@@ board charts and is missing in any annual record of the influ@@ ential music media .
after extremely productive experiments St@@ ev@@ ens then relies on &quot; The Age of AD@@ Z &quot; ( 2010 ) extensively electronic Vers@@ ets .
this sixth regular studio album is still orchest@@ rated , but supported by programmed sequences or beats and plays with all sorts of effect and rever@@ b .
long ago the smaller clubs rose , the stage shows are here to the colorful spect@@ acle of ne@@ on brow@@ bands and large fluores@@ cent stage de@@ ko .
currently Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens is currently touring as part of a five @-@ member band through Germany .
in the dark @-@ held Hamburg More !
&quot; &quot; &quot; he mainly presents the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Car@@ rie &amp; Lo@@ well &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; available since March . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although here now nearly 2000 guests are ban@@ ished in their chairs , the clearly advert@@ ised St@@ ev@@ ens returns to in@@ tim@@ acy and to folk .
without direc@@ ting a word to the audience , the group of excellent musicians is playing through the broad @-@ enriched album .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one list@@ ens to the audience : the talk is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; op@@ ul@@ enter &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and you can therefore disc@@ ard the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; record &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ ns debut at the Prime Minister &apos;s questionn@@ aire
since his election , Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s debut will be eag@@ erly a@@ waiting the prime minister &apos;s questionn@@ aire
the new Labour leader Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n was to give his debut in the prime minister &apos;s questionn@@ aire and set up for the first time with David Cameron .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will rise to provide the first of his six af@@ ore@@ mentioned issues shortly after lunch , where his performance is likely to be examined by the media and the Labour MPs .
he called for &quot; less theatre and more facts &quot; at this weekly event .
he also said he could ski@@ p some sessions to leave her colleagues .
the meeting will be the first parliamentary sc@@ rut@@ iny for Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s leadership , as it comes after his appointment as a member of the shadow cabinet and after his speech at the TU@@ C annual meeting on Tuesday .
in the meantime , the decision of the Labour Party , on Tuesday during the national hy@@ m@@ ne &apos;s singing at a commemor@@ ative ceremony to commemor@@ ate the 75@@ th anniversary of the Battle of Britain in silence , has prov@@ oked criticism of a number of T@@ ory MPs and is at the center of several front pages @-@ stories in the newspapers .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s decision not to sing the national an@@ them has attracted attention
&quot; &quot; &quot; a spokes@@ man by Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said he &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stood in resp@@ ect@@ ful silence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and he recognized the &quot; hero@@ ism of the Royal Air Force in the Battle of England &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but a member of Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns Schatten@@ kab@@ in@@ ett , O@@ wen Smith , told the Labour chairman to sing the national an@@ them , &quot; independent &quot; of his belief that the mon@@ archy should be abol@@ ished .
almost a dozen of shadow ministers have refused to serve in Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s top team , and they refer to differences in economics , defence and foreign policy , while less than a sixth of the Par@@ li@@ ament@@ ary Party supported him as a leader .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Polit@@ ische Cor@@ respon@@ dent of BBC Robin Bran@@ t says that political differences are also &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; st@@ acked &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; within the Labour &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and according to Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s statement on the position of the European Union and the limit of profits . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said the TU@@ C Conference that Labour changes set out to remove the whole idea of del@@ im@@ itation altogether .
hours later Mr Smith , the shadow work and pensions minister said that the party was &quot; very clear &quot; that it was only against the government plans to reduce the limit of 26,@@ 000 £ to 23,@@ 000 £ .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will be the fifth Labour leader David Cameron ever since he is T@@ ory boss , over the Disp@@ atch @-@ Box in parliament last decade .
the Labour leader , who promised another polit@@ ician , says he has &quot; Crow@@ d @-@ sour@@ ced &quot; ideas for questions to Mr Cameron and gave him more than 30,000 suggestions .
the Canary North MP has said that the prime minister &apos;s question@@ ing is too con@@ front , and that he will have both &quot; per@@ sever@@ ance &quot; and the dispute with contradictions , and has instead made a focus on serious issues such as poverty , ine@@ quality and the challenges for young people .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said Angela Eagle , the shadow of economic minister , will represent him if he is not participating - for example when Mr Cameron is travelling abroad .
he also brought the idea that other colleagues sometimes spoke the word , and that he spoke to John Ber@@ cow , the spokes@@ man of the House , to discuss the problem .
when he became a leader in 2005 , Mr Cameron said that he wanted to remove himself from politics in the style of a &quot; Kas@@ per@@ le theatre , &quot; which is often linked to the prime minister &apos;s questionn@@ aire . but a few years later he admitted that he failed in it .
since it was first broadcast on television in 1990 , the survey with the Prime Minister was regarded as the most important bar@@ ometer of the judgment of a leader and his leadership in the lower house and his position among his parliament@@ arians , although critics argue that it has become a car@@ ic@@ ature and needs far @-@ reaching reforms .

pounds are increased by accelerated growth in the United Kingdom
the pound jump@@ ed diag@@ onally to data , which show a rise in the growth in the United Kingdom &apos;s wage growth . parallel to this , FT@@ SE 100 was increased by the SA@@ BM@@ iller building goal .
between May and July , the result without any bonuses in the UK grew by 2.9 % over the same period of the previous year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this percentage has been the quick@@ est since 2009 and has issued assess@@ ments at the time of an increase in interest . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the pound increased by more than 1 % against the dollar to $ 1,@@ 55@@ 05 and was climb@@ ed up to 0.@@ 84 % compared to the euro to 1,@@ 37@@ 30 euros .
the FT@@ SE 100 Index included an increase of 1.49 % to 6,@@ 2@@ 29,@@ 21 .
SA@@ BM@@ iller was the outstanding share in the market and made a 20 % leap after taking over @-@ offer of the ri@@ val AB In@@ Be@@ v .
a transaction would combine the two biggest bre@@ wer@@ ies of the world and bring brands such as Bud@@ weiser , Stella Ar@@ to@@ is , Per@@ oni and Gro@@ l@@ sch .
Bur@@ berry shares were higher after encouraging news from the competition group for luxury goods Ri@@ chem@@ ont .
Ri@@ chem@@ on@@ ts latest sales figures propose all expectations and also showed that sales in China - a key market for Bur@@ berry - reported growth again .
the shares of Gl@@ enc@@ ore climb@@ ed by 5 % after the mining giant said that it took 2.5 billion US $ through a stock selling as part of its debt reduction strategy .
the shares of the packaging and paper group of Mon@@ di were the biggest los@@ ers on the index , with a decrease of 4.3 % after Gold@@ man Sach@@ s had sold his assessment for the company Rating .
JD Sports rose by 3.1 % after the sports clothing company reported a pre @-@ tax result of 46.@@ 6 million for the half @-@ year .
the boss of JD Sports says that higher wages end@@ anger the expansion .
the managing director of JD Sports Peter C@@ ow@@ g@@ ill says that a higher minimum wage for UK workers could mean more purchasing power in the pockets of potential customers . &quot;
but it is unlikely that this purchasing power would compens@@ ate for the higher labour costs with his company , he says .
the cost could meet the expansion plans of JD Sports , he added , and that could mean that there are less additional jobs .
Just@@ in Bie@@ ber in the capital : on the Bie@@ ber expedition in Berlin

not bad .
hundreds of fans accompanied Just@@ in yesterday .
among them E@@ wa and Vik@@ toria from Poland .
since 7 o &apos;clock in the morning , however , the Pol@@ in sits on the cold stone s@@ labs in Berlin &apos;s luxury hotel at Pots@@ dam@@ er Platz .

if at all .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; actually my Vik@@ toria should sit in the tenth class in the gymn@@ asi@@ um . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I fulfill her a dream . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
to make a mistake ?
whom is it@@ ching ?
the fans do not .
also Bie@@ ber himself does not .
this has already taken care of .
for the advertisement in the advertising break of the super@@ bow@@ ls he sco@@ red three million , a two @-@ year deal with an anti @-@ p@@ im@@ ple company , many dollars on the Bie@@ ber account .
and with each d@@ oll that looks like it and goes over the counter , Bie@@ ber also assi@@ sts .
when Just@@ in Bie@@ ber drinks a coffee , one will be amazed at the window .
he is said to have exploited more than 100 million .
some say the hyp@@ e g@@ inge too far .
&quot; &quot; &quot; others stress that Bie@@ ber is in the USA and the UK with his new single &quot; What do you mean ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on 1st place . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bie@@ ber himself , whose fourth album should follow in November , will not be interested in the many zer@@ os .
at least he does so .
PE@@ GI@@ DA poster brings Leb@@ anese to m@@ ashed potato idea
potato or D@@ öner ?
both are both in the potato @-@ range , which the Ol@@ den@@ burger I@@ mb@@ iss@@ owner Han@@ i Al@@ h@@ ay has developed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; inspired by the phrase &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pot@@ ato of D@@ öner &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on a Pe@@ gi@@ da movement , Al@@ h@@ ay potato and meat put together on a sk@@ e@@ wer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the idea brought him a poster at a Pe@@ gi@@ da demonstration with the in@@ scription &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; potatoes instead of D@@ öner &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which he saw by chance on TV . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since then , there is a barbecue sk@@ e@@ wer in his shop , which is equipped with meat and potatoes .
&quot; this is mul@@ ticul@@ tural for the stomach , &quot; says Al@@ h@@ ay .
the idea has now allowed the Leb@@ anese to register with the Patent Office in Munich .
it has recently been protected as utility model , according to the authority .
as much meat and how much potatoes of the sk@@ e@@ wer contains , Al@@ h@@ ay doesn &apos;t want to betra@@ y it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; only so much : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it tastes better together , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he finds . &quot; &quot; &quot;
also with its customers , the culinary understanding of international cuisine goes well .
met@@ cash launches Con@@ soli@@ dation campaign to combat Al@@ di@@ - in@@ fest@@ ation
met@@ cash tries to protect the I@@ GA branches before an Al@@ di @-@ rise in South Australia and Western Australia .
food wholes@@ aler Met@@ cash has launched a land@@ mark campaign to defend the market share of the I@@ GA ret@@ ailer in South Australia and Western Australia in advance of a 700 million $ Al@@ di invasion .
while Al@@ di prepared the opening of two distribution centers and the first 120 shops in South Australia and Western Australia at the beginning of next year , Met@@ cash and I@@ GA supermarkets strengthen their relationship with local food suppliers and build the I@@ GA brand through mainst@@ ream marketing and marketing over the social media , as well as events such as Adel@@ aide @-@ Show .
Ig@@ A dealers and suppliers jump on board , with brands like ice manufacturers S@@ immo from D@@ uns@@ bor@@ ough , who distri@@ butes samples in I@@ GA @-@ stores samples and store owners who sell approved tickets for the South Australian Football League to loyal customers .
it is expected that Met@@ cash will publish further details of its def@@ ensive strategy on September 29 , when the wholes@@ aler for food , alcohol and equipment runs its annual investors strategy day .
there is much on the game , since South Australia and Western Australia almost 30 percent of Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s I@@ GA stores make up and generate higher profits than Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s I@@ GA network in eastern states .
purch@@ as@@ ers in South Australia and Western Australia are not@@ orious provincial and I@@ GA retailers have a much stronger market share than in New South Wales , Victoria and Que@@ ens@@ land - more than 30 percent in South Australia and 24 percent in Western Australia compared to about 14 percent in eastern states .
however , analysts like Morgan Stan@@ ley believe that Al@@ di will take around five percent of the food market in these two countries twelve months after opening its first markets and will take away all existing actors , but mainly independent retailers .
according to a report published this week , the analysts Tom K@@ ier@@ ath of Morgan Stan@@ ley appreciated that I@@ GA ret@@ ailer could lose $ 360 million per year and Met@@ cash 250 million $ by the end of 2016 .
this forecast is based on the assumption that Al@@ di will open 25 branches in SA and 30 in WA next year and generate revenue of $ 500 million and $ 600 million in each market .
the loss in food and food business , and in quantities on Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s high fixed cost basis , could cost about 13 million $ profit before interest and taxes , Mr K@@ ier@@ ath said .
at the same time , Met@@ cash loses market shares in eastern states , mainly Al@@ di and Col@@ es , although a recent survey conducted by Roy Morgan found that I@@ GA purch@@ as@@ ers are the most loyal .
Morgan Stan@@ ley assumes that Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s sales in the food and food business rose by 3.8 percent in 2016 , by 4.1 percent in 2017 and 2.1 percent in 2018 and the market share of 14 percent in 2015 will be reduced to 10.3 percent by 2020 .
last week , the leading fund manager Ham@@ ish Dou@@ glass , the founder of the Mag@@ ell@@ an Financial Group , told a business in Melbourne that Met@@ cash would probably disappear within a decade .
Met@@ cash declined to publicly respond to the comments of Mr Dou@@ glass .
but it is assumed that a board member of Met@@ cash has contacted Mr Dou@@ glass last week .
i@@ Gas market share has decreased from 18 percent to 14 percent since 2010 , and revenues from Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s food and food trading , which has approximately 1,@@ 200 I@@ GA ret@@ ailer , has fallen by 43 percent since 2012 , which reflects the operating debt reduction in the same @-@ time pressure on sales and mar@@ gins .
the wholes@@ aler resi@@ des , however , and inv@@ ests more than $ 150 million in order to increase sales prices with Col@@ es and Wo@@ ol@@ wor@@ ths for hundreds of products each week and to improve I@@ GA retailers in improving their stores by fast growing fresh foods and delivering a better selection of private label foods .
met@@ c@@ ash@@ s Managing Director Ian Mor@@ rice says that the price adjustments and shop @-@ refurb@@ ishment programs are to gain momentum and hopes that the wholesale mer@@ chant in 2017 will return to a profit growth for the first time in the year 2017 .
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is is supported by the president of the Australian tennis association Steve He@@ aly
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is deserves praise for his behaviour rather than criticism .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was one of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; col@@ lateral damage &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the recent storm around his friend Nick Cy@@ ril and ear@@ ns rather praise for his own behaviour according to the President of the Australian tennis association Steve He@@ aly . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is , the younger of the talented duo , which is repeatedly called &quot; Special Ks , &quot; got into the spot@@ light by the in@@ famous confront@@ ation of Kyr@@ gy@@ z with St@@ an Wa@@ wr@@ inka at the Montreal Masters .
in a fier@@ y qualifying game in C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati soon afterwards , Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is and his opponent Ryan Har@@ rison had to be separated twice by the arbit@@ er , saying &quot; Wa@@ wr@@ inka would have had to sla@@ p Kyr@@ gy@@ z and I should strike the child . &quot;
while he was recently seen how he sm@@ ashed a tennis r@@ ack@@ et after a Kr@@ amp@@ f th@@ wart@@ ed a potential US Open victory by Richard Gas@@ quet , Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is von He@@ aly was def@@ ended ste@@ ad@@ ly .
the teen@@ ager is currently in Glas@@ go@@ w , competing with Sam Gr@@ oth for the second place in the individual behind Bernard Tom@@ ic in the Davis Cup semi @-@ final against the UK .
&quot; one thing I &apos;m really shy about is the fact that after my view , Th@@ an@@ asi was a bit drawn into the dispute , &quot; He@@ aly said .
he has broken a r@@ ack@@ et when he lost due to a fight in the US Open , but he is not the first player who broke a m@@ ack@@ et from fru@@ stration with himself , and I know Th@@ an@@ asi well enough to know that he is not proud of it .
but , really , he has beha@@ ved extremely well in the US Open , even among the pretty pro@@ voc@@ ative circumstances with Har@@ rison and so on , and I think he deserves a lot of recognition .
he has a great team around him , he has a great family around him and I think he was treated a little too strictly .
he is a very mature 19 @-@ year @-@ old , he works very hard , and he fits into the team and so on , he has never had a problem with the other players , he is well trained in the dressing area , he is good in shape , he is a very stable and mature young guy , and I think he deserves to be judged by his own mer@@ its .
&quot; &quot; &quot; He@@ aly also supported the decision not to take into account Cy@@ cling in the important decision that begins on Friday , and he describes the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; joint decision &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as the right one for everyone , but he sec@@ ures the man from Can@@ ber@@ ra as a long @-@ term solid component to return to the team . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first , we want the team to be completely focused on the competition and not on all the contro@@ vers@@ y around &#91; Kyr@@ gy@@ z &#93; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said He@@ aly . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I believe Nick has quickly made the rise to what people like Feder@@ er and Mur@@ ray have made , and he has made some bad mistakes and deserves all the criticism he gets , but we try to make him understand the consequences of his actions . some time outside the r@@ amp , in which he can only think about it , I think appropriate , and it &apos;s best for the team and it &apos;s the best for him .
Europe &apos;s refugee crisis : Hungary declares emergency , closes the border , keeps refugees back
Hungary declared the emergency and bol@@ ted the southern border with Serbia on Tuesday and held all those who tried to come illeg@@ ally in the country . all with the aim of stopping the influ@@ x of migrants .
chaos followed the border , when hundreds of migrants were accum@@ ulating in a land of Ni@@ em@@ and@@ s@@ land and acted Ser@@ b officials with indi@@ gn@@ ation .
the people who fled from violence stuck for an unknown time in a land strip along the road between the two control points of the countries fixed and built tents and settled down there .
but fru@@ str@@ ations increased .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when a police helicop@@ ter we@@ pt over them , the migrants &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Op@@ ens the border ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and sm@@ ash ins@@ ults against the Hungarian government police . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some were returned from protest foods and water .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Serbia &apos;s Foreign Minister stated that it was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ acceptable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that migrants from Hungary would be returned while more and more from Macedonia and Greece arrive . &quot; &quot; &quot;
( Serbia ) wants to be part of the solution and not a col@@ lateral damage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the coming days , discussions with Brussels and other countries must take place , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said I@@ vica D@@ ac@@ ic in Prague . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the turbul@@ ence at the Hungarian @-@ Serbian border reached a day after the 28 @-@ nations block at a controversi@@ al meeting in Brussels no common immigration policy could be agreed .
the ministers agreed , however , to share the responsibility for 4@@ 0,000 people in over@@ coming Italy and Greece . they expressed their hope that eventually - next month or by the end of the year - an agreement would be reached that the EU countries would receive further 120@@ ,000 refugees , including some from Hungary .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria demanded a special summit of the European Union on Tuesday to discuss the migration crisis of the continent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , Hungary did not put its hopes on a spe@@ edy action from Brussels or its neigh@@ bors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the emergency room that was launched on Tuesday in two southern regions gave authority more powers to cope with the crisis so that they could block roads and accelerate asylum procedures .
the Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to said his country also plans to build a bar@@ bed wire along its border with Romania , in order to stop the influ@@ x of migrants through the country - after it has ended a fence at the Serbian border .
C@@ BS News correspon@@ dent Charlie D &apos;@@ Ag@@ ata reported that even pris@@ ons used to create bar@@ bed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in recent months Hungary has become a substantial bott@@ len@@ eck for many war refugees from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , Prime Minister Viktor Or@@ ban insist@@ ed that most forth@@ coming economic refugees are looking for a better life , not war refugees who are entitled to protection - a view that is strongly opposed to other EU states , including Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the new laws , which came into effect at midnight in Hungary , make the crossing of the border or damage the 4 @-@ metre ( 13 feet ) high fence to build the government along the southern border with Serbia , to a crime . these laws also impose higher adher@@ ence to convi@@ cted traff@@ ick@@ ers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the situation created by the mass migration , the Hungarian government declares the emergency situation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said spokes@@ person Z@@ ol@@ tan Kov@@ acs re@@ por@@ ters in the southern town of Sz@@ eg@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we say it is very clear : illegal border crossing is a crime .
the Parliament must still appro@@ ve the application of the military , which is expected next week , but re@@ por@@ ters from Associ@@ ated Press have already met heavily armed soldiers with vehicles and dogs for days .
Gy@@ or@@ gy Bak@@ on@@ di , country security advis@@ er for Or@@ ban , said that authorities 45 people were trying to cross the border , 15 others had already penet@@ rated deeper into the country .
they come over by dam@@ aging the fence , they are now in police cust@@ ody and are accused of off@@ ences against the new laws .
authorities are there to repair the fence quickly .
Hungarian officials closed two of the seven border cross@@ ings with Serbia on Tuesday morning after a train wagon with bar@@ bed wire to close the borders had arrived .
chaos surrounded the most important border crossing near Ros@@ z@@ ke , Hungary , when Hungary opened a small office in a metal container to process people &apos;s data and press a crowd to press there .
about 20 managed to come in , but thousands remain outside .
another group of migrants blocked the most important motorway connection between Serbia and Hungary and said they would refuse food and water until they are allowed to travel to Hungary .
election @-@ 2016 : H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s lead ahead of Ber@@ nie S@@ anders in a national survey hal@@ ved
the former Secretary of State H@@ illary Clinton continues to hold a double @-@ digit advance in the democratic race for nom@@ ination at national level , but Sen@@ ator Ber@@ nie S@@ anders wins her towards the ground .
Clinton now has the support of 47 percent of democratic elec@@ tors in pre @-@ elections ( 58 percent before ) , while S@@ anders is second , with 27 percent ( increase by 17 percent ) .
vice President Joe Bi@@ den , who has not yet proclaimed whether he is chann@@ elling for the presi@@ dency , receives support of 15 percent of the democratic elec@@ torate of the election elections .
more than five months before the start of the election , most democratic vot@@ ers say it is too early to say that their opinion is determined by which candidate they will support them .
but Clinton &apos;s supporters are more consistent in their election than that of the other candidates .
since the C@@ BS news survey Clinton has lost a number of demo@@ graphic groups while S@@ anders earned some profits .
Clinton has a huge advantage in women and moder@@ ates , but these j@@ umps have dimin@@ ished .
your support in the men has dropped significantly , and S@@ anders will only return with 5 points here .
Clin@@ tons &apos;s advantage for democratic vot@@ ers under 50 years has ev@@ apor@@ ated , and they and S@@ anders are now on the same level .
Clinton has yet a great advantage over the elderly vot@@ ers .
last month , Clinton was in front of S@@ anders with a double @-@ digit jump on the liber@@ als , but S@@ anders now has a 5 @-@ point lead in this group .
about half of the democratic elec@@ torate of the pre @-@ election nation@@ wide say they would support Clinton as they were nominated by the party .
a quarter would support them with some reservations and further 15 percent would only support them because they are the candidate .
six percent would not support them .
maybe it &apos;s not surprising that Clinton &apos;s current supporters are excited especially by her .
the views are more mixed with those who are not currently supporting Clinton - only about a quarter would love them enthusi@@ ast@@ ically .
while 48 percent of the democratic elec@@ tors of the pre @-@ elections say they support Clinton with enthusiasm , less re@@ publi@@ can vot@@ ers say this about their peak candidate Donald Tr@@ ump ( 35 percent ) .
if Clin@@ tons supporters are asked in an open question why they want them to be the candidate , is the most common answer that she has the right experience ( 16 percent ) , followed by the opinion that it is time that a woman is president ( 13 percent ) and that she is the best candidate for the job ( 10 percent ) .
Clinton &apos;s supporters also mention their connection with Bill Clinton ( 9 percent ) .
consent to dealing with the problems and the elec@@ ci@@ bility are also c@@ ited .
since the Vice President thro@@ ws a potential for the presidential office in the balance pan , 57 per cent of the democratic vot@@ ers of the presidential elections would like to see him in the race - even though a third believes that he should not do it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if democratic elec@@ tors are asked of the election , who would be their second choice for the party , is Bi@@ den at the top . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Clinton &apos;s followers say more than half that Bi@@ den would be their second choice far from S@@ anders . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if Bi@@ den decides not to channel for the nom@@ ination of the Democrats , H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s lead is increased from S@@ anders , from 20 points with be@@ es in the race to 30 points without him in the race .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; five @-@ five percent of democratic vot@@ ers see Clinton as a candidate with the best chances to win the election , but this number dropped from 78 per cent last month . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Bi@@ den is by far a second in this measurement , but the percentage that sees it as the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sel@@ ectable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is increased . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , on the question of what is more important for a candidate , Democratic vot@@ ers call questions about elec@@ t@@ ability .
similarly as in the last month , no single democratic candidate or potential candidate for these vot@@ ers of pre @-@ elections is un@@ acceptable .
the Democratic candidates or potential candidates provide good results in some key features among vot@@ ers in the election of their party .
maj@@ orities take Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den as honest and trust@@ worthy and equipped with strong leadership qualities .
Bi@@ den is best suited to the three candidates in hon@@ esty , while Clin@@ tons &apos;s strength is the lead .
thirty per cent of democratic vot@@ ers do not believe Clinton is honest and trust@@ worthy , twice as many say that about S@@ anders ( 15 percent ) , but 27 % have no opinion of him .
democratic elec@@ tors in the election generally also see Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den ide@@ ologically in accordance with their views .
for all these measurements , about a quarter of democratic vot@@ ers have no opinion of S@@ anders .
since questions about H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s use of a personal e @-@ mail address and a server during the term as an out@@ sider will continue to be satisfied , most of the Democratic vot@@ ers of the preliminary elections are satisfied with their explanation of the matter and say that it did not affect their opinions in total .
but it is a different story in the American public altogether .
half of the Americans are dis@@ satisfied with their statement , while only about one third is satisfied .
the public opinion about this was split in March , just after the problem came to light .
most Americans said that the e @-@ mail contro@@ vers@@ y had no effect on their general views of Clinton , although 36 percent said that their opinion was still worse .
it is mainly Re@@ public@@ ans , more than six of those who say their views of Clinton have become worse .
although Clinton is regarded by the vot@@ ers of their party as honest and trust@@ worthy , this is still a problem for them among registered vot@@ ers : only 32 percent see them as honest and trust@@ worthy , eight percent less than last month and 15 points less since May .
62 per cent of the eligible vot@@ ers do not hold them for an honest and trust@@ worthy person .
at the same time , 55 per cent of the voting rights regard nation@@ ally also Tr@@ ump as not honest and not trust@@ worthy .
Clinton and Tr@@ ump receive however good notes on leadership .
from the six candidates , Bi@@ den , Car@@ son and Bush are best cut off with hon@@ esty .
a majority regards S@@ anders rather than hon@@ estly , but as with Car@@ son many have no opinion of him .
the error ratio for the sample of 351 Democratic vot@@ ers in the pre @-@ election amounts to 6 percentage points .
Ben Car@@ son crazy about Donald Tr@@ ump in a nation @-@ wide survey
Ben Car@@ son is located near Donald Tr@@ ump in the latest C@@ BS News / New York Times survey
Euromonitor International has over 30 years experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems .
re@@ publi@@ can vot@@ ers continue to support Tr@@ ump in large numbers . the support grows by 23 % in the last C@@ BS survey conducted before Fox News Deb@@ ate last month to 27 % in the survey of Tuesday .
but Car@@ son shot from 6 % to 23 % in the same period .
the survey also revealed that Car@@ son is well received in demo@@ graphic groups and sur@@ passes Tr@@ ump under Republi@@ can vot@@ ers with higher education .
the rest of the field , except Car@@ ly Fi@@ or@@ ina and Ohio Gover@@ nor John Ka@@ ze , is kno@@ cked down with Wis@@ con@@ sins Gover@@ nor Scott Walker , who is the deep@@ est , and from 10 % support last month to now 2 % .
former governor of Florida , J@@ b Bush , former governor of Ar@@ kan@@ sas Mike Hu@@ ck@@ abe@@ e and Florida Sen@@ ator Marco Ru@@ bio are at 6 % in third place .
the error margin in the sample of 376 people of Republi@@ can vot@@ ers in this latest survey is Plus or minus 6 % and was carried out in September .
the latest CN@@ N / OR@@ C survey , which was published last week , shows that Car@@ son rises in the surveys - with 19 % support for Re@@ public@@ ans , behind the Tr@@ ump with 32 % support .
the latest survey conducted by ABC News / Washington Post also showed Tr@@ ump clearly before Car@@ son .
with a view to a Car@@ son rising in the last week , Tr@@ ump took some post@@ ure for the former neuro@@ sur@@ geon , even after Car@@ son ap@@ ologi@@ zed to question the g@@ umps of faith .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need energy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tr@@ ump last Saturday during a campaign show in I@@ owa . &quot; &quot; &quot;
pleasant bathing temperatures : the eastern Mediterranean is currently up to 29 degrees warm .
even though peak values are measured only in the distance , there is already a trip to the Mediterranean for bathing vac@@ ation@@ ers to find even warm water .
a bath in the North or Baltic Sea should be a rather short pleasure at a maximum of 17 degrees .
some people no longer go to the sea : a maximum of 18 degrees has the water in the North and Baltic Sea this week , the German Weather Service ( D@@ WD ) shares with .
bathroom temperatures , on the other hand , continue to offer the Mediterranean : in the East , it is even up to 29 degrees .
in the Adriatic , it is at the top 25 degrees , in France 23 degrees .
the Red Sea in Egypt comes to 28 degrees .
five members of the Bro@@ therhood enc@@ um@@ ber@@ ed with the death of a Bar@@ uch College @-@ Ne@@ ul@@ ings
nearly two years after a student died in Po@@ con@@ o Mountains , Pennsylvania , during a Shi@@ va ritual , murder charges are filed against five persons .
members of the New York Bar@@ uch College P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ P@@ si bro@@ therhood attacked Ch@@ un &quot; Michael &quot; Den@@ g brut@@ ally during an introduc@@ tory ritual in September 2013 and delayed his transportation to the hospital , leading to his death , told the police .
officials said he had been bur@@ dened with a 30 pound back@@ pack full of sand , and repeatedly attacked while he tried to approach a frozen field to a goal .
Mr. Den@@ g finally compl@@ ained about head@@ aches , then he fell un@@ conscious .
the members of the P@@ i @-@ P@@ si @-@ P@@ si Bro@@ therhood did not call the emergency number 911 , after Den@@ g was power@@ less and allegedly waited an hour before they brought him to a hospital , so the police .
however , they had the time to change D@@ eng@@ s clothes , to goo@@ gling his symptoms and to contact Andy Men@@ g , the national presi@@ dents of the Bro@@ therhood to seek advice , said police chief Chris Wagner at a press conference .
&quot; at this point , the members , U@@ ten@@ si@@ lien , began to hide and set the well @-@ being of the Bro@@ therhood about that of Michael Den@@ g , &quot; said Poli@@ v@@ ef Wagner .
he could not revi@@ ve , and he died the next morning at his injuries .
after an aut@@ op@@ sy report , Den@@ g was repeatedly inf@@ licted with bl@@ unt force injuries to head , tor@@ so and th@@ igh@@ s .
&quot; too many families were destroyed by the ch@@ ic@@ ans of Bro@@ therhood . at least one student died every year since 1970 , &quot; said Douglas F@@ ier@@ berg , a lawyer who represents D@@ eng@@ s family in an explanation .
bro@@ ther@@ hoods and their members must be held ac@@ coun@@ table , and this step by authorities is very important .
a County Grand Jury of Mon@@ roe recommended an indictment for Mor@@ des third grades for the first five members .
thirty @-@ two members of the Bro@@ therhood , including Mr Men@@ g , are also charged with the attack and formation of a criminal enterprise .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t just want to blame the people involved , but if there is an organization that has sanc@@ tion@@ ed - officially or un@@ officially - we will also hold them to account , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wagner on a press conference on Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Bar@@ uch College has forbidden the Bro@@ therhood , and the national bro@@ therhood has rev@@ oked its affili@@ ation to the local community .
this will happen if the F@@ ed increases interest rates
interest income is coming , and the house se will fall into the fal@@ ter , return for bonds will rise , and the economy will gli@@ de into recession .
we know this .
what we don &apos;t know is how long it will take and how long it will last .
in particular , the history of the economy offers little guidance on how to proceed .
a recession came within just 11 months after the first rate of interest and lasted 86 months .
the aggres@@ si@@ veness of the Federal Reserve when raising interest rates is often , al@@ beit not always , a factor in how the economy and financial investments are respon@@ ding .
hence , representatives of the U.S. Central Bank have stressed so fier@@ c@@ ely that investors should not focus on when it starts to increase interest rates but rather to the period needed for norm@@ alisation .
in fact , several variables play a role .
in the end , however , market participants could notice that all the excitement was perhaps exagger@@ ated because of a interest rate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the first increase in F@@ ed since the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some as a signal for the end of the era of &quot; cheap money &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Julian Jes@@ so@@ p , chief econom@@ ist at Capital Economics , in a communication to customers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in contrast , we do not expect the grad@@ ual return of US interest to normal heights , but still at a low level to lead to the se@@ ism@@ ic shock that many seem to fear .
however , this does not mean that there will be no impact .
here is a look at historic trends based on how some areas of the economy might react :
as the market has seen last month , the anticip@@ ation of interest income can make things vol@@ at@@ ile for a while .
once the increase arrives , the influence is not so dramatic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is apparently a tendency that assets rose from 12 to 24 months after the first up@@ li@@ ft@@ ment , which perhaps reflects the delay in monetary policy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Deutsche Bank analy@@ st in a newer study to what happens to the interest rate of the F@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
more precisely , the market is usually in the upward trend in the past 35 years - about 14 percent - on the way to interest rate , rather flat in the 250 days after ( average profit of 2.6 percent ) , then back to normal state after 500 days , with an average return in the past six past cycles of 14.@@ 4 percent according to a recent analysis , which published Bob D@@ oll , chief facility strateg@@ ist at Nu@@ ve@@ en Asset Management , at Bar@@ ron &apos;s .
the Deutsche Bank said that the impact on the shares ten@@ den@@ cial later in the raising cycle and the return begins to decrease .
rec@@ essions are a fact of economic life , but interest rates often promote it .
in the current case the F@@ ed is confronted with some conditions that could not have existed before and which could accelerate a recession .
it is extremely not@@ e@@ worthy that the gross domestic product will be near its lowest point at a interest rate of the F@@ ed .
according to Deutsche Bank , the 118 interest rates since 1950 had only twice the nominal GDP below 4.5 percent .
although the second quarter of 2015 was 3.6 percent , only a few expect this to continue and expect only 1.5 percent for the third quarter according to Atlanta F@@ ed .
interest income in such a frag@@ ile economic setting could be ris@@ ky and throw the question &quot; if it is different this time , &quot; said the Deutsche Bank .
market participants have taken place all year round on a brie@@ fing of the F@@ ed , and all eyes were directed to the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee this week , which ends on Thursday .
while many strategi@@ sts and econom@@ ists believe that the FO@@ MC would appro@@ ve an increase in this meeting , the fut@@ ures trading is only a probability of 25 percent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in our study , all increases cycles from 1950 to today have taken place in a super cycle with increasing momentum during the BI@@ P and pre @-@ rec@@ essi@@ on@@ cements very quickly after the start of recovery in the shadows &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says the report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in contrast , this is a clearly slow recovery from what was the worst recession in the observed phase .
the current cycle is by far the longest maintained by the F@@ ed since the end of the last recession ; the record was 35 months , and this is 74 months before .
the fixed income was also vol@@ ati@@ l as the market anticip@@ ates interest income , and the pattern is quite similar to the capital market .
the main difference is that the effect on bonds is faster than for stocks , if they change their strategic course .
bonds seem to change direction once the initial up@@ li@@ ft@@ ment / decrease occurs in the cycle .
at the end of the raising cycle , the bond yields fall immediately , said the Deutsche Bank .
the strategi@@ sts of Charles Schw@@ ab believe that the rise in interest rates will cause returns between longer and shorter bonds and lead to a fl@@ ashing of the curve .
high @-@ interest bonds often bring better yields in such a climate , although &quot; we are still careful to expect higher yields , &quot; said Kath@@ y Jones , Fi@@ xed @-@ In@@ come Anal@@ yst@@ in bei Schw@@ ab , in an analysis .
Jones states that the markets have already adapted themselves to F@@ ed @-@ Strategy expectations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to the strength of the dollar and the decline in inflation expectations , there are some indications that the market adapted to the prospect of stric@@ ter monetary policy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
short @-@ term interest rates have risen , the yield curve is flat , l@@ ending have expanded and vol@@ at@@ ility has increased - all the characteristics of the market if the F@@ ed intensi@@ fies its strategy .
in the large and whole , companies that engage the greater part of their business operations in the US will benefit if interest rates rise and local products become more attractive .
multin@@ ational corporations with high deb@@ ts are becoming worse , as an increasing dollar is making their products more expensive on the global market , as well as financing its deb@@ ts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; history shows that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; quality &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shares tend to respond very positively three months after an initial interest rate , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gold@@ man Sach@@ s analysts in a report for the customers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
companies with a strong balance sheet have exceeded companies with weak balance after each of the interest rates in 1994 , 1999 and 2004 at an average of 5 percentage points .
companies with high capital yields and low vol@@ at@@ ility in their shares also exceeded their counter@@ parts with low quality by an average of 4 ( percentage points ) and 3 ( percentage points ) .
deb@@ ts become a big problem .
companies with a high share of flexible interest will lose most , said Gold@@ man .
outside the pure share games , consumers will also benefit from the rising dollar .
savings could see profits through higher yields , even if experts in different opinion are how fast this will take place .
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of the Classic FM , says Parliament member Andrew B@@ ingham
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Con@@ servative member of the Parliament critic@@ ised the sender because of its &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stup@@ idity &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he argu@@ ed that he is increasingly not distingu@@ ish@@ able from commercial ri@@ vals .
he also zi@@ pped the BBC Music Awards and said they only im@@ itated The Br@@ its
Parliament @-@ colleague Dami@@ en Col@@ lins grab@@ bed the broadcast The Voice and said that this was not very original .
&quot; &quot; &quot; BBC Radio 3 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; turns &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to Classic FM , asser@@ ts a leading parliament@@ arian member and raises new pressure on the transmitter to prove that he does something that does not do the private broad@@ cast@@ ers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Con@@ servative MP Andrew B@@ ingham also told the BBC @-@ Bos@@ sen that the publicly @-@ legal radio station &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sil@@ ly &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and increasingly no longer be distinguished from its commercial competitors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; radio 3 seems - I don &apos;t like the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fool@@ ish &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - but it seems to turn to Classic FM , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he also aimed at the BBC Music Awards , which started last December .
the BBC Music Awards , which started last year , seem to be just under another name .
so if you are trying to do something different - these are two spontaneous examples where you can only im@@ itate what is already on the market , &quot; Mr B@@ ingham said .
BBC @-@ General Manager rejected the accus@@ ations and argu@@ ed that BBC Radio 3 was far ahead of his commercial competitors when it comes to live music and public education .
what I learn from Radio 3 I will learn about classical music anywhere else .
and there is a commitment to live music and music that is truly uns@@ ur@@ passed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the commitment of Radio 3 to find new music and order new works , I really think it is important , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the beginning of this year , BBC Radio 3 Controller Alan Dav@@ ey argu@@ ed that tough@@ er was needed to engage the audience as it did in the past because the British were less informed of classical music .
radio 3 , however , was not the only element of BBC production that came under fire during the hearing in the committee on the choice of culture , media and sport under fire to tre@@ ad the commercial ri@@ vals .
the T@@ ory MEP Dami@@ en Col@@ lins attacked The Voice - the BBC &apos;s musical talent show , bought by Dutch producer T@@ alp@@ a Media for an estimated cost of £ 22 million .
do you see why this program is often discussed because it is not original and not particularly striking ?
Lord Hall insist@@ ed that the BBC 1 show - with Pal@@ oma Faith and Boy George as a judge - was produced in a special BBC way .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he added , he wishes that the company &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; find a hit from our own barn &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; if the next time it was an entertainment series . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , he refused to excl@@ ude the order from further ranks of The Voice in the future or to give the money of the ag@@ it@@ ators for other entertainment formats .
Internet sales rose in August the slow@@ est and the Black Friday may be responsible for it
Euromonitor International has over 30 years experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems .
last month there was the lowest score since the beginning of records in 2000
online sales increased three years ago by using mobile phones for shopping
experts believe that the Black Friday s@@ lowed down expenses in November
for over a decade the virtual shopping has been bo@@ oming and many of Britain &apos;s main shopping streets have turned into a spirit city .
but experts say there are signs that online sales st@@ agn@@ ate after new figures show only seven percent in the first three months of 2015 .
the total expenditure for August presented the lowest rise in growth since the beginning of records in 2000 with only five percent increase compared to the previous year .
experts say there are signs that online sales st@@ agn@@ ate after new figures show only seven percent growth in the first three months of 2015
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you look at the growth rates for the previous years and go back to 2000 , it has always developed over time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Andy Mul@@ c@@ ah@@ y , editor of the IM@@ RG sales index of the Guardian . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he explained that online sales increased three years ago when purch@@ as@@ ers started making purchases with their mobile phones .
it meant that more people could buy online and that people could do this in different environments , e.g. at home on the sofa .
but now this is a com@@ mut@@ ing , and we may experience that growth is dimin@@ ishing .
the Black @-@ Friday phenomenon imported from America is c@@ ited as a reason for the decl@@ ining sales .
experts believe that buyers are holding back their purchases from this event , which takes place on the last Friday in November .
last year , five times the average number of buyers turned their computers to make their bar@@ gains and some dealer websites crashed .
experts believe that Black Friday , where the purch@@ as@@ ers fought for bar@@ gains , could prevent buyers from making purchases .
a study by the British Ret@@ ail Con@@ sortium discovered that £ 5 is spending some more than 1 £ online .
for some products such as television and washing machines , more than one third of purchases are now done via web @-@ shops .
at the same time , more than a quarter of men bu@@ ys clothes and shoes online rather than in the fashion chains in the inner cities .
Muslims buried in Mec@@ ca during the crane accident - B@@ in Laden &apos;s family is sanc@@ tion@@ ed
the dead bodies of 29 dead are carried by Muslims on the streets of Mec@@ ca by the streets of Mec@@ ca .
Saudi Arabia att@@ aches to the collapse of some of the huge Saudi B@@ in Laden group
the Ministry of Health said that a total of 394 people were injured after the crane crashed .
hundreds of Muslims gathered , when 29 of the victims were carried through the streets to bury those who were killed when a crane collap@@ sed at Mek@@ ka &apos;s Groß@@ mo@@ sch@@ ee .
mour@@ ning filled , largely dressed in white , the circuit to pay tribute to their respect when the first of the dead came up their last trip to the Al @-@ Mo@@ on@@ sem c@@ em@@ etary .
the pro@@ cession went on to the Holy Place where only days before a building crane passed through the ceiling of the mos@@ que and then the praying broke .
the cor@@ p@@ ses were released for the fun@@ eral , when the Saudi King ordered a san@@ ction on the construction company of the B@@ in Laden family due to the disaster that also left the 394 injured .
the cor@@ p@@ ses of 29 operators who were killed when a crane crashed through the big central mo@@ sch@@ ee Mek@@ ka , were carried through the streets .
among the dead , Q@@ asi@@ m Ak@@ ram from Bol@@ ton , Gre@@ ater Manchester , father of four children , was on his first pilgrimage , when the crane fell down .
Mr Ac@@ ram was with his parents before the start of the annual pad@@ dle in the Grand Mos@@ que .
Saudi officials have already confirmed that the H@@ add@@ sch will continue to continue to Mec@@ ca with thousands who continue to come to the city .
today King Sal@@ man , the B@@ in Laden group , would not have allowed the arm of the crane to stop when he was not used .
an Arabic version of the decree published by the State Saudi Press Agency said that the B@@ in Laden group was responsible for the collapse .
the news agency &apos;s English service does not report this detail , but said that the management of the company abroad is prohibited .
at the beginning of this week , Sal@@ man had to reveal what caused the fall of the crane , which r@@ ushed into an inner court yard of the Groß@@ mo@@ sch@@ ee , where hundreds of thousands of Muslims were gathered in front of the H@@ add@@ sch , which later took place this month .
the B@@ in Laden group did not have any statements on the collapse of the sick , and their representatives were not available for an opinion .
the Royal Dec@@ ree also ad@@ mi@@ red the group because of non @-@ current security measures and because they did not cooperate with meteor@@ ologists .
do@@ zens of cranes surround Mek@@ ka &apos;s Groß@@ mo@@ sch@@ ee as part of the massive construction project managed by the B@@ in Laden group .
the B@@ in Laden family has been associated with Saudi Arabia for decades and takes over larger projects .
the de@@ ceased leader of Al Q@@ a@@ eda , Os@@ ama bin Laden , was a rebel@@ li@@ ous son , who was ex@@ propri@@ ated by the family in the 1990 &quot; s .
the crash of the crane came in the midst of strong winds and rain , only a few days before the arrival of millions in the kingdom for the pilgrimage , which is required at least once in the life of every healthy Muslims .
officials said that 158 people stay in the hospital .
government officials estimate that 1 million ri@@ al ( £ 17@@ 4,000 ) are to be paid to the members of the slain , and the same amount of permanently injured .
other publishers will receive half of this amount .
B &amp; Q Boss states that the time of cheap Eastern European crafts@@ men is over
British employ increasingly trad@@ es@@ people , says Ver@@ oni@@ que Lau@@ ry
the number of qualified crafts@@ men from Eastern Europe has increased
this leads to the opening of 200 other Scre@@ w@@ fix stores aimed at art@@ isans
at the same time , King@@ f@@ isher will close 60 B &amp; Q sales points nation@@ wide
von Rupert St@@ einer , City Head Cor@@ respon@@ dent der Daily Mail
it is said that the British settle their h@@ amm@@ ers and brushes in favour of the use of qualified eastern European crafts@@ men who carry out the work in their homes .
if you can handle sk@@ ill@@ fully with a hammer or brush for painting walls , you seem to belong to a minority nowadays .
for Britain increasingly employs crafts@@ men to carry out do @-@ it @-@ themselves jobs in their homes , such as the head of the company behind the B &amp; Q .
Vé@@ ron@@ ique Lau@@ ry , new Managing Director of King@@ f@@ isher who owns the DIY chain , said that a large increase in the number of skilled trad@@ es@@ men from Eastern Europe , offering services at low prices , is now out@@ dated .
therefore , King@@ f@@ isher plans to open 200 other Scre@@ w@@ fix shops that are aimed at professionals and 60 sales points from B &amp; Q .
Mrs Lau@@ ry said she wants to employ more women in B &amp; Q shops , because eight of ten purchasing decisions in the shop are being hit by women .
at the moment the men were silent .
she said it is necessary to face growing demo@@ graphic trends that show more female single households who make more renov@@ ations than in the past .
Mrs Lau@@ ry said : &quot; it still works a majority of men in our branches .
we have to shift this stronger towards a balance .
in principle , half of our clients are made from women with 80 percent of the decisions regarding the purchase of articles by women .
women play a major role in the decision @-@ making process .
Mrs Lau@@ ry , who is one of only five women at the head of a British in FT@@ SE@@ 100 Index listed companies , has also re@@ struc@@ ted her top team to reflect an equal number of men and women in leadership positions .
King@@ f@@ isher is almost the only company engaged in 50 percent of the team with women , including its management and financial support .
Mrs Lau@@ ry said : &quot; this was a conscious decision - diversity is an important issue here .
it was not difficult to find good women for our super@@ visory board .
King@@ f@@ isher reported a decline in half @-@ year profit and sales after the group owed the cost of leaving the stores .
due to the trend , King@@ f@@ isher , the Scre@@ w@@ fix and B &amp; Q , will open 200 new stores .
officials of A@@ ich / D@@ ob because of in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity in court
on Wednesday , two function@@ aries of the Austrian Vol@@ leyball Tournam@@ ent A@@ ich / D@@ ob have to answer on Wednesday two officials of the Austrian Vol@@ leyball Tournam@@ ent A@@ ich / D@@ ob because of in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity and reject interest .
the def@@ endants ple@@ aded not guilty .
one of them was also accused of abuse .
he has been acqu@@ itted in May of this accus@@ ation .
the current trial was ad@@ jour@@ ned .
according to the At@@ tor@@ ney @-@ General Robert Ri@@ ffel , the accused had cryst@@ alli@@ zed in the preliminary inquiry that the def@@ endants in the years 2006 to 2011 were the Gel@@ der of the Association &apos;s accounts of which they were allowed to disp@@ ose in their functions for private purposes .
it damages the damage to around 400@@ ,000 Euros .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sports officials are also indi@@ cted for financial crimes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this Fak@@ tum was the chairman of the Sch@@ öff@@ en@@ sen@@ ate , judge Micha@@ ela San@@ in .
it should be negoti@@ ated at a later date .
for the accus@@ ation of in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity , the defence presented that at no point an asset was created at any time .
the sports function@@ aries had only charged expenses compensation and the sports club , for which they had been active from 1982 to 2011 , and in which they had invested a lot of time and money , financed the li@@ abilities in 2001 around 60@@ 0.000 Sch@@ illing ( approx . 44.@@ 000 Euro ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at that time , we were faced with the situation : do we go on or block the club ? &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said one of the accused , in the B@@ aker &apos;s Gre@@ ater @-@ powered aud@@ itor of the financial officer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he then decided to take over this task with his colleague and co @-@ accused .
with all risks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have required money to lay down our life insurance as security for the bank , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said at the arrest . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the association has been agreed : you can manage the money freely , there may be no deb@@ ts . &quot; &quot; &quot;
furthermore , in the case of a corresponding financial success , the withdrawal of expenses compensation was decre@@ ed until 1991 .
therefore one part of the expenses compensation was paid only years later , namely , from the year 2003 , when a plus had been on the account .
therefore , l@@ ump @-@ sum and non @-@ detail entries seemed to explain the proceedings .
the accounts and savings account managed the two def@@ endants together , said the second accused .
why the pay@@ outs of the association were not disclosed in detail , the judge asked .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the association did not interest itself in detail for the financial donation , it was important only to have debt free , so the answer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when in 2011 against the one function@@ ary investigations began , an amount of 120@@ ,000 Euros was transferred to the Club &apos;s account .
that had been rep@@ ay@@ ments , the def@@ endants declared .
this securities account exp@@ ired on behalf of the second def@@ endant and was not known to the association according to his statement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the judge wanted to know . &quot; &quot; &quot;
wher@@ eu@@ pon the question@@ ed no answer for a long time .
then he finally thought , he believed that this was the best for the club .
if something had happened to him , nobody would have known anything about this money , the public prosec@@ utor in the room .
the compl@@ ain@@ ant was informed , justified himself to the function@@ ary .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this transfer was formulated as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dem@@ nity &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
why damage compensation ? , judge and prosec@@ utor wanted to know .
the first def@@ endant declared that he was not in agreement with this formulation , because the association never had any damage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but what should I do if the lawyer says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with this you are all from the tailor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; am I a legal representative ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he asked . &quot; &quot; &quot;
furthermore , the function@@ ary , he never sour@@ ced a cent content , he only charged mil@@ eage and di@@ ets .
on di@@ ets he charged EUR 1000 per month , but the actual effort was much higher , he added .
the def@@ endants were not able to demonstrate accurate records for the early years .
they were no longer kept after an audit in which everything was judged correctly .
mil@@ eage was also referred to as the second def@@ endant .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all dwell@@ ings are in cash ; therefore , he has to go to the bank of Blei@@ burg from his home country market , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he explained in his statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the main hearing continues on 23 September with the survey of witnesses .
Hewlett @-@ Packard reaches further 30,000 jobs
in addition to personnel mining that has been ongoing for three years , the computer giant will reduce further jobs during the spl@@ itting of the company .
the plots in the US computer giant Hewlett @-@ Packard ( HP ) do not end .
as part of its restructuring , the US technology group plans to break down from 25,@@ 000 to 30,000 jobs in its corporate customer segment .
as a result , costs of 2.7 billion dollars ( EUR 2.4 billion ) are to be saved , the company informed on Tuesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the step will lead to a special load of around 2.7 billion dollars which will be dropped from the fourth quarter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the reduction of 5@@ 5,000 jobs has not yet been completed for three years .
at the end of the financial year 2013 / 14 , HP focused more than 30@@ 2,000 employees .
the Hewlett @-@ Packard @-@ share gave an increase of 2.3 percent .
the large @-@ scale group of printers from Califor@@ nian Pal@@ o Alto currently spl@@ its up : the computer and printer business is to be bund@@ led in a new company , separated from the more involved areas with computer servers and data storage for companies as well as other services .
both business shares shall be listed on the stock exchange .
a again dis@@ ap@@ pointing PC sales and a weaker demand for corporate customers after its services set the world &apos;s second largest PC manufacturer to the last .
in the third quarter of the financial year at the end of July , the sales of PC and printers declined by 11.@@ 5 percent .
sales fell 8 percent to just under $ 25.@@ 4 billion .
the proceeds went back to 15 out of 16 quarters .
HP is respon@@ ding to the changes in the industry with a spl@@ itting and massive displ@@ ac@@ ement .
the 76 year old company under the leadership of Me@@ g Whit@@ man has only recently re@@ acted that customers will increasingly buy smartphones and tablets rather than traditional computers and do more and more stores online .
the restructuring plan of Whit@@ man shows a total of about 5@@ 5,000 jobs .

the Hungarian police operated on the Serbian border near R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke tear gas and water laun@@ cher against several hundred exp@@ elled refugees .
Eur@@ one@@ ws correspon@@ dent D@@ á@@ ni@@ el Bo@@ z@@ si@@ k has witnessed the out@@ break of violence at the border control point .
he reported by telephone :
a group of refugees broke through the border .
behind the police a police @-@ line had formed and a water @-@ laun@@ cher was ready behind the polic@@ emen .
40 to 50 refugees began to throw stones , sticks and plastic bottles after the officials .
the officials initially deployed pepper spray .
then the police used tear gas .
much tear gas was spra@@ yed in the direction of the refugees .
thus the group was dissolved .
the refugees have now been waiting for a while .
a pregnant and apparently injured woman was removed from the zone .
children who had breath@@ ed the tear , cried out .
other refugees laugh@@ ed together and suffered under the short@@ age of breath .
the press spokes@@ persons of the Serbian police also suffered injuries by the use of tear gas and pep@@ per@@ spray .
time of decision on interest rates for the central bank
the world is observed when the Central Bank comes together on two days , on Wednesday and Thursday , to make the important decision whether for the first time since almost a decade the interest is raised or not .
a survey conducted among 80 econom@@ ists question@@ ed by Reu@@ ters found that a little more than half , last week &apos;s view , that the F@@ ed will do this , now think that the F@@ ed will remain somewhat longer and the interest rates on the current level will last from 0 @-@ 0.25 percent .
it is a historical event because it has been seven years since the F@@ ed interest has been on N@@ ULL .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the first time , we approach a situation where a large central bank possibly leaves the zero area and launches a process of norm@@ alisation of interest rates , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Angel U@@ dine , leading staff at the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the US economy is added to a relatively good level of performance , tril@@ lion dollars are added to the balance sheet and generate only a low inflation .
however , the F@@ ed cannot ignore the less controversi@@ al outlook on global conditions .
it has warned the markets to adapt to an increase , but the indications point out that the chances of such a move are good .
the decision will be announced at 8@@ pm CET on Thursday
death Sag@@ itt@@ arius at the Delta State University leaving compensation
after shooting and killing his girl@@ friend in Miss@@ issi@@ ppi on Monday morning - and before he later killed his colleagues on the day - Sh@@ ann@@ on Lamb wrote a note to say that he was &quot; sorry &quot; at the first murder and , &quot; he couldn &apos;t do it , &quot; said authorities on Tuesday .
the police in G@@ auti@@ er , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , said that Lamb , lec@@ turer for ge@@ ography and social science education at Delta State University , called the emergency number at 10 : 00 on Monday morning
&quot; &quot; &quot; and said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; He has shot on someone and someone killed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Lamb said to the staff of the emergency center that the police had to send police officers to his home .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I shot my wife yesterday evening , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and he also mentioned that a &quot; sweet &quot; dog &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is in the house but who will &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nobody bo@@ ther &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but probably will be excited . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police asked the call@@ ers after his name , but he did not give him .
Lamb gave no explanation for his shots .
when police entered the scene , they found the body of Amy Pr@@ ent@@ iss , 41 , and a hand@@ written note from Lamb , 45 , said : &quot; I &apos;m sorry I wanted , I could undo it .
I loved Amy and she is the only woman who ever loved me . &quot;
after writing the note he drove 300 miles to the Delta State University , where he killed E@@ than Schmidt , a professor of history , before he finally took his own life on Monday evening when polic@@ emen killed him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; University president William LA@@ FOR@@ GE said he didn &apos;t know anything about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs &apos;s performance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; despite reports on Monday that Lamb believed that Pr@@ ent@@ iss also had a relationship with Schmidt , said authorities on Tuesday , there is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no information , no evidence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a &quot; triangle relationship &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Pr@@ ent@@ iss was written by Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en who said that they were married for about seven years as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; good man &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the two were divor@@ ced 15 years ago , but remained friends .
O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said he and Pr@@ ent@@ iss would have a daughter who is 19 and she was &quot; destroyed on the ground . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said that Pr@@ ent@@ iss was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; absolutely best friends &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pr@@ ent@@ iss worked online from home , according to Lin@@ s@@ day K@@ now@@ les , who was identified by Sun Her@@ ald as a close friend of Pr@@ ent@@ iss .
K@@ now@@ les said that Pr@@ ent@@ iss , who owned a dog called Light@@ ning , met for about three years with Lamb .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wanted to help other people , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ now@@ les said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the police said that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he called on Monday &apos;s relatives at a certain time on Monday to tell them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he did not go to prison . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when polic@@ emen took him on Highway 1 near Green@@ ville later on this night , Lamb drove his car to the side , fle@@ w on foot , ran into the forest and killed himself with a shot .
Lamb was awarded a doctoral degree from the Delta State University in spring 2015 , as his life lau can be found on the University &apos;s website .

Euro@@ wings : Lufthansa is expanding the Group
sorry , this entry is only available in Deutsch .
the Lufthansa Group wants to save half a billion euros a year alone with a better organization .
the Group restructuring costs 150 of the around 1,000 executives around the world .
with the pilot union , there are new negotiations .
the Lufthansa is expanding its corporate structure and evalu@@ ates Euro@@ wings .
the aim of the real@@ ign@@ ment is an earnings contribution of around 500 million euros per year from cost and income syner@@ gies , the airline announced on Wednesday .
among other things , there is no longer a management board for the passenger business in the future .
the Euro@@ wings mil@@ eage airline should be developed as independent as possible .
in the executive team headed by CEO Carsten Sp@@ oh@@ r , Karl Ulrich Gar@@ n@@ adt will be responsible for Euro@@ wings .
with the new order , Sp@@ oh@@ r under@@ scores the importance of Euro@@ wings , with which the Group wants to compete against Ry@@ an@@ air and Easy@@ jet in the future .
until now , the organization of the 120 000 employees was complex .
the airlines operate under the umbrella of the Passage Airline Group , which represents three quarters of the annual turnover of EUR 30 billion .
new negotiations with the pil@@ ots
in the tari@@ ff conflict with the pilot association cock@@ pit ( VC ) the negotiations will be resum@@ ed on this Thursday following the scheduled strike on this Thursday .
that shared the union with .
the topic of the talks should be the retirement provisions for pil@@ ots .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a year with a prog@@ no@@ stic record result , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ash wool &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; will result in viable results as quickly as possible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the conflict between trade union and airline led to various strikes in the past few months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to the trans@@ itional provision of the pil@@ ots , the background is the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wings &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concept . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it seems that Lufthansa has depos@@ ited flights to the Group &apos;s own Euro@@ wings &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Euro@@ wings &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; group in the fight against competitors . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Luke Sha@@ w of Manchester United can not play for months due to double frac@@ ture
Luke Sha@@ w suffered a double frac@@ ture of his right leg at the Manchester City defeat at PSV Ein@@ d@@ hoven .
while this brought the left outer def@@ ender to cry and excl@@ ude it for at least six months from playing , Louis van Ga@@ al gives hope not that Sha@@ w can play again this season .
the injury was caused by a reck@@ less attack of Hé@@ c@@ tor Mor@@ eno in the 15th minute after the 20 @-@ year @-@ old Sha@@ w had fallen in the PSV area .
he was treated nine minutes on the playing field and needed oxygen before being taken to hospital .
&quot; &quot; &quot; van Ga@@ al said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has a double leg and is located in the hospital . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he will be displ@@ aced tomorrow or perhaps a day later and then operated in Manchester .
it &apos;s terrible - a boy who comes with 18 to Manchester United , it is very difficult and then fantast@@ ically playing , and then this happens .
in the locker room he had an oxygen mask .
he cried .
I am not a doctor , but if you have a double frac@@ ture , it takes six months , and it will not play in the group phase .
I hope that he can play this season again .
Mor@@ eno seemed happy to have escaped a red card and the aff@@ ection@@ ate of an El@@ f@@ meter .
Nic@@ ola Ri@@ zz@@ oli , the arbit@@ er , did not pun@@ ish the Mex@@ ic@@ ans .
van Ga@@ al presum@@ ed that the Italian arbit@@ er had wander@@ ed .
you can judge for yourself if I say that an el@@ ap@@ ron and a red card were due .
it was a very bad attack with both legs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a twe@@ et on Sha@@ ws &apos;s account was : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I thank you all for your messages . words cannot describe how broken I am , my way to recovery begins now , I come back more strongly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
based on this : Manchester United suff@@ ers the loss of Luke Sha@@ w in the defeat of the PSV
with the European Championship in France , the UK def@@ ender has an additional incenti@@ ve to recover until the coming June .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Phil@@ lip Coc@@ u , the PSV @-@ Trainer , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s a very bad injury . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when a player leaves the place with this type of injury all are very sad about it .
it is never the intention of our players to viol@@ ate an opponent .
Mor@@ eno suffered a leg break when Mexico played against Van Ga@@ al &apos;s Holland team at the 2014 World Cup .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is very difficult because it was not his intention to hurt the opponent , and if you hear that it &apos;s a very bad violation , this is not good , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Coc@@ o . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for me it was not possible to see the moment .
the only thing I could see was the ball rolling in a different direction , so it looked like he had touched him , but I couldn &apos;t see the attack on Luke .
in conversation with S@@ BS@@ 6 , Mor@@ eno said : &quot; I know how it feels , I know how hard this can be .
I feel very bad about it . I &apos;m so sorry .
the PSV player Andr@@ és Guar@@ dado is also brought to the hospital - after a f@@ oul@@ ding by Chris Sm@@ alling .
surely David Cameron has better known The Lor@@ ax ?
it is one thing that all parents will soon learn : if your child loves a book , it will not take long until you know it almost in@@ war@@ dly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unless you are David Cameron ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
when he was asked by a provider of child care systems to name his favorite children &apos;s book , the Prime Minister for The Lor@@ ax , which was published in 1971 , decided by Dr. Se@@ uss .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was a difficult choice , Cameron writes in a message on the website of the company Super@@ camp , and continues : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; funny , moving , creative and with a powerful message , it &apos;s a book that I like to read my children because it seems to always have a picture or a message that we have missed so far . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
everything nice and good except that the following paragraph , in which Cameron is supposed to describe the story of the book , re@@ produces a summary of the 2012 movie version , adding new characters and details to expand the pretty short original text .
&quot; in the midst of the w@@ alled city of Th@@ urg@@ y , where all nature is gone and even the air is a commodity , a boy named T@@ ed hopes to win the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , the girl of his dreams , &quot; he reads . a love interest was Dr. Se@@ uss , whose real name Theodor Z@@ uss takes ho@@ stage and died in 1991 , but completely unknown .
as if this were not suspic@@ ious enough : the text presented by Cameron can partly read as the summary of the Lor@@ ax movie , which is presented on the website of Internet Movie Database and so begins : &quot; in the w@@ alled city of Th@@ urg@@ y , where everything is arti@@ f@@ ici@@ ally and even the air is a commodity , a boy named T@@ ed hopes to win the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , the girl of his dreams . &quot;
although he adm@@ its to be a prag@@ matic father , it seems unlikely that Cameron is so little familiar with the story of the book . here , an un@@ named boy h@@ ears , like the local environment through the gre@@ edy , trees fal@@ si@@ fying , Th@@ urg@@ atory kn@@ itting On@@ ce @-@ ler , in spite of the protests of the name @-@ giving Lor@@ ax , a ho@@ ck@@ ering , car@@ eless creature that speaks in the name of the trees . &quot;
most likely , such a relatively low PR task was deleg@@ ated to a hel@@ per who did not read The Lor@@ ax 20 times in a row for a child .
a Dow@@ ning Street spokes@@ woman said that the text was probably come from Cam@@ er@@ ons &apos;s elec@@ toral office .
Super@@ Camp@@ s confirmed that the text was delivered by Cam@@ er@@ ons staff , but there were no further immediate comments .
Adam Ly@@ th was clearly threatened by exclusion from England &apos;s team , but it is still hard
driving to Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task , but if one sees the cad@@ res that England has chosen for the tour , a repet@@ ition of the 3 @-@ 0 test series defeat is not on my card .
I would not excl@@ ude a down@@ si@@ eg .
the Al@@ ast@@ air C@@ ooks site may be less experienced than the three years ago , but there are good spin @-@ players in the bat@@ ting setting , and the community spirit is strong ; they will not bear sc@@ ars from 2012 , just a you@@ thful @-@ positive attitude .
with the ball , Mo@@ een Ali as Spin Bow@@ ler and Adi@@ l Ras@@ hid , even if it represents an unknown size on test level , is an option for the attack .
in this news : Adam Ly@@ th divor@@ ces from the UK @-@ Test @-@ K@@ ader and is replaced by Alex H@@ ales .
the decision to leave Adam Ly@@ th is of course hard to analyze for me as his boss in Yor@@ k@@ shire .
in his seven tests , there were two good attacks under difficult conditions , and the simple but hard reality is that Cri@@ ck@@ et@@ opponents are ge@@ ared towards results .
there were no question marks at Joe R@@ oot , for example , and that led to the nom@@ ination , there - and I told that - players are their own best selection .
a long time ago he had extended the course of Ly@@ th , but he had control of his own fate .
if he hopefully turns out more purchases for Yor@@ k@@ shire , another chance comes .
the England trainer Tre@@ vor Bay@@ l@@ iss praised his attitude , even if he did not get such good performances , and I don &apos;t surprise me ; he is above all a team man .
the question of how much time a test person gets to put his mark is difficult .
Ly@@ th got seven chances - like Sam Rob@@ son before him - while Nick Comp@@ ton got nine .
only Comp@@ ton got the chance to play home and back@@ wards .
the only repro@@ ach that can be raised was that England first deployed Jonathan Trot@@ t in the Caribbean - as Ly@@ th was in top form - but this lost chance is now in the past .
alex H@@ ales comes in , and he is a head@@ man I guess .
he is an X @-@ factor Cri@@ ck@@ et@@ player , what we saw in Yor@@ k@@ shire early in this season when he achieved 236 against us on a Tr@@ ent Bridge place , which made us very close .
he must have at least the same opportunities as those before him , but this depends naturally on the team position in the United Arab Emirates .
the idea to suggest Mo@@ een next to C@@ ook , which would provide an extra spin @-@ bowl and get four Qu@@ icks , de@@ af , and I have nothing against it .
I don &apos;t see why a man can &apos;t beat there , and this left @-@ handed has already shown that he is a devil player from cri@@ cket players .
he might not have done his job for his County Wor@@ c@@ ester@@ shire , but he is number 3 for her , and there is no big difference .
my former te@@ amm@@ ate Just@@ in Lan@@ ger played his first 38 tests at the first drop , before he appeared as op@@ ener in 2001 .
he has made three hundred of us immediately and did not look back .
Z@@ af@@ ar Ans@@ ari comes into the cad@@ re as a back @-@ up sp@@ inner , and in my limited interaction with him he has impressed me as a young man .
people may see their stat@@ s - on average 31 with the r@@ ack@@ et and 35 with the ball - and think it &apos;s a p@@ unt , but there is no big number of backup sp@@ inners who raise their hands and the trainers have chosen for youth .
he will learn a lot on this tour .
apart from the team , England has made some clever additions to the trainer .
the appointment of Mah@@ ela Jay@@ awar@@ es , the B@@ ats@@ man from Sri Lanka , as advis@@ or to the test games could be a master coup .
he is one of the nic@@ est guys in the game that will bring a wealth of experiences , as he has played under all conditions and against all attacks .
Paul Coll@@ ing@@ wood comes for the white ball stage of the tour and brings energy and powerful use into the setup .
I always felt he was created for the international Cri@@ cket competition , as a player or as a coach , and like Mah@@ ela he has insights from which we can benefit .
sometimes new voices can bring fresh wind in the locker room , even if the messages are in tune with the previously said .
Coll@@ ys team @-@ mate at Dur@@ ham , Ben St@@ okes , won &apos;t be used with the One @-@ Day@@ ers , R@@ oot received a similar break from Australia and I have no problem with it for my part .
some will not agree , but co@@ aches and team @-@ makers do not determine the schedule .
and you must remember that as with players , their jobs depend on the results .
such decisions are not made easy in heart .
the Bre@@ x@@ it camp ( Bre@@ x@@ it = UK &apos;s exit from the EU ) could gain gains if the economy falls into a built @-@ in unit by 2017 .
David Cameron &apos;s un@@ balanced new negoti@@ ation strategy to keep Britain in the EU will get into trouble with every day , even without the election of the brilliant Jerem@@ y &quot; Is it yes or no ? &quot; Cor@@ by@@ n to the leader of Labour or TU@@ C , who fell as@@ le@@ ep because of Europe on Tuesday .
foreigners have also their Cor@@ by@@ ns and Nig@@ el Far@@ ages .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a European diplom@@ at friend said recently that some member states , so deeply ent@@ an@@ gled in various crises , as the EU is now and not always out of their own debt , Britain &apos;s own agenda with split conc@@ essions and dis@@ rup@@ tive treaty changes that they mostly don &apos;t want to be satisfied . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in Bri@@ gh@@ ton , TU@@ C decided on its annual meeting that it does not like it if they end@@ anger social protection .
we could also call it Dave and Georges Self@@ ie @-@ agenda .
Prime Minister and finance ministers climb on summit or bilateral meetings in foreign capit@@ als , take a picture of themselves in front of a famous local monument , with or without local sizes , come home and say that they win allies for reforms .
it is always about me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my European friend , who wants an outside Britain outside the EU tent - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Let &apos;s not alone with France , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Berlin - and lets see that more and more short @-@ si@@ ghted ministers and officials have come to the point where it doesn &apos;t matter whether we remain or go . &quot; &quot; &quot;
German chan@@ cell@@ or Angela Merkel is an ally , but she has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave the office before it looks bad for her , as happened in the exagger@@ ated long @-@ outs such as Th@@ at@@ cher ( 11 years ) , Mit@@ terr@@ and ( 14 ) and Koh@@ l ( 16 ) .
France &apos;s François Hollande has a look at his re @-@ election , or his replacement in 2017 .
he is also a f@@ ading force .
Poland may soon have a nation@@ alist right government , Spain a left .
it is difficult to imagine that they will tear a leg to help the sel@@ f@@ ie Brit@@ ons whose energy should be better used to prevent Scotland &apos;s withdrawal from the UK - something they don &apos;t want , because most similar separ@@ at@@ ist tendencies have .
so perhaps some such ministers may even deliberately not even deliberately write helpful comments , entirely in the SN@@ P style , while Great Britain &apos;s reference campaign in 2017 to speed up the Bre@@ x@@ it process , my boy@@ friend susp@@ ects .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation was a bank@@ rup@@ t@@ cy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Britain has won nothing from the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Europeans know how clean the Fle@@ et Street can be at their expense and which EU sc@@ ep@@ tics is the oli@@ gar@@ chy of the press bar@@ ons , as they were not supported during the 1975 referendum inspired by Tony Ben@@ n , which supported our entry in 1973 with a ratio of 2 : 1 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they can get weak to Boris Johnson , the z @-@ Euro opportun@@ ists who made a name as an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; EU @-@ Stra@@ it Ban@@ anas &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Brussels correspon@@ dent in the early 90 &apos;s . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with all his cra@@ zin@@ ess , Ed Mili@@ band knew who his enemies were .
this included the Med@@ ley of tax @-@ fear@@ ing barriers , telephone @-@ h@@ acking foreigners and the pseu@@ do non @-@ national who have most of our major newspapers .
actually Tony Bl@@ air thought about her , but determined that if you sit with a hot gor@@ illa in a cage , you better spread the ban@@ anas to di@@ stract him instead of being at his lunch and dinner .
in fact , Mili@@ band was more Bl@@ air than Bl@@ air himself when he opposed Cameron &apos;s referendum , because Bl@@ air had opposed the principle of the non @-@ approved EU constitution , which was then rejected by French and Dutch vot@@ ers in 2005 , which opened up a back@@ door .
the press never betra@@ yed him .
but the nice Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n who gave me a friendly g@@ aps on the back of Westminster - I told him that he didn &apos;t need time for me to waste - seems to repeat N@@ eil Kin@@ no@@ cks boy@@ cot@@ t Mur@@ doch strategy of the eigh@@ ties , an error back then and now .
it may take , but he must develop a coher@@ ent strategy to win the media , not with me but certainly with Andrew Mar@@ r , whose BBC @-@ settee he left on Sunday .
Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s official position on Europe is - I just press it friendly - in development .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says that we should stay in a re@@ formed EU . &quot; &quot; &quot;
well , most people outside of U@@ ki@@ p &apos;s traditional Bl@@ auf@@ ar@@ b@@ stoff @-@ tendency and wild poems of Tor@@ ys Klein @-@ Engl@@ ish@@ ism can say yes to everyone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is what Hil@@ ary &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A Ben@@ n , but no B@@ enn@@ ite &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said in radio and television this week , when the boy sc@@ outs fought in him , not to admit that Cor@@ by@@ ns was dism@@ is@@ sing the provo@@ king John Mc@@ Donn@@ ell as a shadow @-@ chan@@ cell@@ or . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it reminded me of the sevent@@ y @-@ five years when his old father was on TV to be loyal to his labour cabinet colleagues , without going too far and losing his cabinet job .
Hil@@ ar@@ ys &apos;s fight was even more attractive .
but to fight to &quot; stay under all circumstances &quot; - B@@ enn@@ s &apos;s expression - was not what Mc@@ Donn@@ ell said , what J@@ C told his fellow soldier and dep@@ u@@ ties after all reports on their l@@ ump convention on Monday evening .
whatever the touching bottom @-@ up image of Cor@@ by@@ n wants to convey - remember that he even touched me - News @-@ discipline remains important in the age of TV around the clock , and above all in the wh@@ irlpool of social media , a breeding ground of Par@@ ano@@ ia and betra@@ yal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is true that Cameron does not give free map for Europe which allows him to hold the support of Lab@@ ours in the reference campaign for a matter of course , as Mc@@ Donn@@ ell said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Simon J@@ enk@@ ins certainly thinks that way .
but Mc@@ Donn@@ ell and Cor@@ by@@ ns basic am@@ big@@ u@@ ities on EU membership - in line with their B@@ enn@@ ite si@@ ege @-@ economy , their anti @-@ capitalist past - is no longer just a matter of es@@ ot@@ eric discussion among the left dis@@ si@@ dents , for which the nar@@ c@@ iss@@ ism of the small difference is a central principle of dog@@ matic differences .
as with its am@@ big@@ u@@ ities at N@@ ato - Tom Wat@@ son is firmly convinced that J@@ C does not launch a campaign to exit - foreign diplom@@ ats will be required to try to find a sense of their su@@ peri@@ ors at home .
why should Paris or Berlin waste political capital - they also have suspic@@ ious elec@@ tors - to make conc@@ essions to the British , if all this can be meaning@@ less ?
the US is already quite disappointed by the weak military power in Iraq , Libya and Syria , even with a cost reduction of the T@@ ory government in power , which I was reminded of something at the start on Monday what British In@@ flu@@ ence Security Forum called .
experts crit@@ ici@@ ze report from Public Health England via e @-@ cigar@@ ettes
claims of a state @-@ funded agency that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are less harmful than smoking originated from a meeting of 12 people , partly with links to tobacco industry , said researchers .
experts who write in the British Medical Journal ( BM@@ J ) included Lanc@@ et by crit@@ ici@@ zing the evidence used by Public Health England ( PH@@ E ) in her report on e @-@ cigar@@ ettes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he published the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fund@@ amental Review &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last month and describes it as a &quot; comprehensive review of evidence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , some researchers have question@@ ed the resi@@ li@@ ence of the data and pointed to the connections between some experts and the tobacco industry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a editorial in the medical journal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Lanc@@ et last month &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; attacked the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; extremely win@@ dy basis &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; based on PH@@ E his most important conclusion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; two further researchers are writing in BM@@ J and asked if the claims &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; build on stone or sand . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Martin Mc@@ K@@ ee , Professor of European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Trop@@ ical Medicine and Simon Cap@@ e@@ well , Professor of Clin@@ ical Ep@@ ide@@ mi@@ ology at the University of Liverpool , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a basic principle of public health is that strategies should be based on the proof of effectiveness . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; they said that the public expects that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the present best estimate is that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are about 95 % less harmful than smoking &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; based on a detailed review of evidence and modeling . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in fact , this statement comes from a single session of 12 people who were sum@@ mon@@ ed to develop a model for multiple criteria decision analysis ( Multi @-@ Crit@@ eria Dec@@ ision Analysis - MC@@ DA ) in order to lead their opinions on the damage of different nic@@ ot@@ ine containing products to a synthesis ; the results of the meeting were summar@@ ised in a research report .
Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that a sponsor of the meeting was a company called Euro@@ Swiss Health , whose managing directors have previously been awarded by British American Tob@@ ac@@ co means ( BA@@ T ) for an independent study .
he also under@@ wrote the references from BA@@ T to public health in a sustainability report , they said .
one of the 12 participants at the meeting declared to receive funds from an e @-@ cigar@@ ettes manufacturer , but not the financing he was supposed to have after reports before by the tobacco company Philip Mor@@ ris International , added them .
the reasons for the selection of the members of the committee are not delivered , but these include several well @-@ known e @-@ cigar@@ ettes champ@@ ions , some of which include an industry financing in paper .
some other participants at this meeting are not known for their know @-@ how in tobacco control .
at the meeting also the Tob@@ ac@@ co line of PH@@ E took part .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the group &apos;s research work &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; conf@@ is@@ cated &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that there is a lack of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hard evidence for the damage of most products in most criteria , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , none of these links or restrictions is discussed in the PH@@ E report .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was no evidence that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was no evidence that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes were used as a way to smoking for children or non @-@ smo@@ kers &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pro@@ f Kevin F@@ ent@@ on , Director of Health and Well@@ being at PH@@ E , said that the BM@@ J claims have already been re@@ acted before .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are much less harmful than smoking . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
every second life @-@ long smo@@ ker dies at his ad@@ diction .
all evidence suggests that the health risks of e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are low compared to that , but that we continue to study the long @-@ term effects .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has the clear duty to inform the public about what the evidence proves and what is not , especially if there is so much public confusion about the relative dangers compared to the tobacco . &quot; &quot; &quot;
nearly 8@@ 0,000 people annually die on a disease with regards to smoking , and smoking costs the National Health System two billion pounds per year .
by clear evidence of current evidence that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are not without risk , but only a fraction of the damage caused by smoking , we comply with our national jurisdiction .
BBC should give up East@@ end , says former head of Channel 4
the former leader of Channel 4 , Luke Johnson , said that the BBC should stop sending programs like East@@ end and The Voice . he said that commercial ri@@ vals would &quot; give their right arm &quot; for hit shows like the Albert Square So@@ ap .
Johnson said that the radio fee should only be used to make the type of programs that are not sent by other UK channels .
he crit@@ ici@@ zed the BBC for public @-@ legal programs that are likely to be seen by a smaller audience in a controversi@@ al time window against the most popular shows of their ri@@ vals and broad@@ cast@@ ers such as BB@@ C4 .
after the BBC @-@ General@@ direktor , Tony Hall , said the company wanted to do more in partnership with other organizations , Johnson said that he was trying to get in touch with the BBC for six years in his time at Channel 4 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have problems with the idea that BBC programs are commissioned or send , which would also clearly be shown by non @-@ subsi@@ dised ri@@ vals , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Johnson to the Ober@@ haus communication committee as part of his investigation on the future of BBC . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you want to keep the broadcasting fee , which I do not consider medium or long term for a good idea , one should at least put its production on programs that others do not make or order .
they send The Voice in a first @-@ class time window because they want to achieve the wid@@ est possible support for their future .
the idea that otherwise no one would show this is a jo@@ ke , it is ridi@@ cul@@ ous , it is natural non@@ sense .
Johnson said : &quot; I don &apos;t see why a reg@@ res@@ sive tax funded programs that could also be financed without subsidies .
the Voice is such a program , East@@ end is another , ad@@ mitt@@ edly both of its own productions .
to be honest , other channels would give their right arm for it .
I am trying to see how this is supposed to be public @-@ legal television .
I don &apos;t think that this would reduce the BBC even at all .
Johnson , an entrepren@@ eur for series , conducted in Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010 , said that the BBC ow@@ d the hunt for reviews &quot; because of the amb@@ itions of the people who work there , and because they believe this is the best way to secure long @-@ term support . &quot;
his comments on the BBC &apos;s most popular broad@@ casts are what the former head of Sky , Tony Ball , presented in his Mac@@ Tag@@ gart phone in Edinburgh in 2003 that the BBC shows like East@@ end should sell .
Johnson said that the rather public @-@ legal niche programs were supposed to go to BB@@ C4 , but they do not measure their tasks , and they can argue if they go to their apparent missions to justify 4 billion £ Broad@@ casting , &quot; Well , of course , we have created all these ob@@ sc@@ ure programs that no one has seen . &quot;
they put them in a time window in which no one ever wanted to see them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Johnson said to the committee : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I urge you to find a rather reg@@ res@@ sive system in terms of conditions who can get the best value from this . &quot; &quot; &quot;
of course , all of you think that one gets a great value for £ 150 per year , but for people who are a lot of money for the 150 £ a year ask me whether this is true , because they don &apos;t consume much of the BBC .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the former Sky@@ - and Channel 5 chief David El@@ stein , who also proclaimed the committee on Tuesday called for the BBC to check their Rei@@ th@@ ian mission to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; educ@@ ate , educ@@ ate and enter@@ tain &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he said that only a few of the BBC productions were officially classified as education - he said that there were 1 % of their TV production and 0.1 % on the radio - and they should take an example of the public broad@@ cast@@ ers in Australia and Canada .
on the question of partnerships , El@@ stein said that BBC should do more in areas such as that of the Pro@@ ms , of which he said that only a hand@@ ful on TV will be shown , and with the commercial broadcasting alli@@ ances enter to make everything available online .
&apos; Son@@ o@@ genetics &apos; can control brain cells by sound waves
the video shows how the ne@@ mat@@ odes are changing the direction at the moment they are ir@@ radi@@ ated with sound impulses .
scientists have bred wor@@ ms with gene@@ tically modified nerve systems which can be controlled by out@@ breaks of sound waves .
the tiny ne@@ mat@@ odes are changing the direction in the moment they reson@@ ate with sound impulses that have high frequencies for human hearing to be heard .
the impulses work through the switching of Mot@@ on@@ eur@@ one cells that are gene@@ tically modified to carry the membrane channels , which react to ultr@@ asonic waves .
further information on this topic : researchers read and write brain activity with light
the researchers said the wor@@ ms showed the power of a new procedure called Son@@ o@@ genetics , where ultr@@ as@@ ound can be used to activate a range of brain , heart and muscle cells outside the body .
S@@ re@@ ek@@ an@@ th Chal@@ as@@ ani , researcher at the Sal@@ k Institute in La J@@ olla , California , told the Guardian that one day the procedure could replace the depths of brain , a invasive procedure that gives electric impulses to the brain of people to treat the symptoms of Park@@ inson &apos;s disease .
thread wor@@ ms generally do not react to ultr@@ as@@ ound , but Chal@@ as@@ ani noticed that they did when they were surrounded by a liquid with micro@@ scop@@ ic bub@@ bles .
the bub@@ bles , he found out , ampli@@ fy the ultr@@ asonic waves , which penet@@ rate into the wor@@ ms .
the ampli@@ fied ultr@@ as@@ ound waves work on structures that are called TR@@ P @-@ 4 ion channels and found in the membran@@ es of some of the season@@ ing cells .
the sound waves indu@@ ce the opening of these ion@@ ic channels and activate the cells they are assigned to , such a report Nature Communications .
in order to create ultr@@ as@@ ound @-@ controlled Nem@@ ato@@ des , Chal@@ as@@ ani gene@@ tically modified the wor@@ ms in such a way that some of their mot@@ on@@ eur@@ ons carry TR@@ P 4 ion channels .
if it applies ultr@@ as@@ ound to the changed creatures , the sound waves are ampli@@ fied by the micro@@ bub@@ bles and transferred into the wor@@ ms where they turn on the changed mot@@ on@@ eur@@ ons .
the procedure has some simil@@ arities with Op@@ to@@ genetics , a ground@@ breaking tool that allows scientists to turn on and off neur@@ ons with impulses of the light .
but Chal@@ as@@ ani said that Son@@ o@@ genetics could have some advantages over this technique .
in contrast to light that must be sent down to the desired position in the brain , low frequency ultr@@ as@@ ound waves can pass un@@ hin@@ dered and can be sent to the brain from above on the skull .
&quot; we believe with gene therapy and a therapeutic virus it is possible to temporarily make the targeted human neur@@ ons sus@@ cep@@ tible to the ultr@@ as@@ ound signal in a clinical setting for certain neurolog@@ ical treatments , &quot; said Chal@@ as@@ ani .
other applications could focus on muscle cells and ins@@ ulin @-@ producing cells , he added .

they played with the invention of a more realistic z@@ wi@@ eli@@ ke company advertising , but &quot; through the f@@ uss with bright colours and animation it remains stronger . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they did a fantastic job by helping us to raise awareness about the sale of illegal torture devices at the fair , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Tom Davi@@ es of Am@@ nest@@ y . &quot; &quot; &quot;
what we need now is a progression of the British government and the guarantee that torture devices are not trad@@ ed illeg@@ ally before our door@@ step .
perhaps the most creative art around the arms trade fair comes from the area within Ex@@ Ce@@ L , where exhibitors f@@ use fantast@@ ically eu@@ ph@@ em@@ istic products .

eight Golden Rules for Life in Student Residences
eleven years ago , as a self @-@ for@@ get@@ ful 19 @-@ year @-@ old I moved into a student residence , still in faith in Ber@@ ets and moral rel@@ ati@@ vis@@ m , but only now I recall the ten@@ se sm@@ iles of those I have anno@@ yed - and to the numerous , long @-@ lasting dis@@ comforts of others .
most of what I have learned can be dist@@ illed in eight simple rules .
the train in student resi@@ dences is ranging from slightly nerve @-@ in@@ descri@@ b@@ able up to absolutely fri@@ ghtening .
it is temp@@ ting to sh@@ orten : people tell where you get , whether and where you have taken the Sabbath year , where you stand in terms of Cor@@ by@@ n and why you &quot; sincer@@ ely said Mar@@ m@@ ite neither love nor hate because in the Ernst , guys , it &apos;s just a yeast extract HA@@ HA@@ HA , I &apos;m in my room . &quot;
breathe through .
and help others to do the same - ask questions and show interest .
it guides the conversation and helps you to find out the people you like as opposed to those with whom you would not speak , even if your las@@ hes were on fire and these fire ext@@ ingu@@ ishers would be .
let people leave .
people &apos;s rooms are often transformed into beverage recep@@ tions , film night venues and municipal meeting points , but they are also places where people attract and maintain their under@@ wear .
related to this : do not remember to start with a relationship at the university
intro@@ ver@@ ted receive a rough treatment at the university .
your room should be a refuge , but many student resi@@ dences form a room @-@ to @-@ room stroll @-@ culture that is friendly and social and can lead to life @-@ long friendship .
this can be hell for someone who tries to recover .
nothing in culture allows you to say : &quot; I like you and I want our friendship to go on , but you have to go away so that I get the energy I spent for interaction with you . &quot;
try to feel when a fellow is exhausted from soci@@ alizing - and send it a text message instead of p@@ apping it .
apro@@ pos t@@ aps : do it .
a guy in my student resi@@ dences had the idea that a locked door was an invitation .
he saw some things .
friendship closed by baking .
since you start the university at the peak of the back mania , the kno@@ cking at the doors of people to imagine yourself with a dish full of brow@@ ni@@ es is less wei@@ rd than the welcome of the 1950 &apos;s &quot; Welcome to the neighborhood , I &apos;ve been giving you something . so , and now please smile when I give you some personal questions . &quot;
offering home @-@ made treats is a good way to make friends .
your room@@ mates feel obliged to enter@@ tain and eventually associate your face with a delicious surprise .
of course , this depends on whether you are a decent b@@ aker .
po@@ or@@ ly mixed l@@ umps of flour , sugar and fat make people face as@@ le@@ ep when you kno@@ ck .
ste@@ aling food is a common crime in student resi@@ dences .
of course , the cl@@ aw of chicken is a the@@ ft , but is it taking a drop of milk for your tea too ?
check this with the milk owner .
the od@@ ds are good that they say to use themselves , even when cooking inside .
if someone ste@@ als your stuff , it &apos;s anno@@ ying , and you have my compassion - but try to deal more balanced than my room@@ mate who added a washing up to her milk to pun@@ ish th@@ ie@@ ves .
she is now in prison .
they should not make noise , the people from sleep or from work .
it is not just about being a decent person , but that you belong in the tru@@ est sense of the pro@@ verb to the people sitting in the gl@@ assy .
a girl on my cor@@ ridor asked her neigh@@ bors whether it makes them a bit qui@@ eter , drum &amp; bass somewhat qui@@ eter , because it was three o &apos;clock in the morning , and she had a test in the morning .
they re@@ acted to it with still more loud music .
when they finally stopped at 5 o &apos;clock , she kindly left her neigh@@ bors two hours to sleep before she pl@@ agu@@ ed her own music , shut her door and gi@@ fted herself to her three @-@ hour examination .
would it not be romantic if your future spouse would acci@@ dentally move into the same residence hall ?
on the other hand , it wouldn &apos;t be very embarrass@@ ing if you hold a room@@ mate for your future marriage partner , turn to them , separate yourself and see them every day and perhaps witness how they attract all common friends ?
of course , the heart goes his own way - but if a hot fellow @-@ mate is not your future spouse , try at least to talk to your under@@ body a bit of reason .
in the exciting moment you notice someone has its keys in his un@@ locked room , the border between an el@@ k and bul@@ lying is fine when it seems .
a good stroke is fun , but it only takes moments until it becomes a bo@@ omer@@ ang .
by hiding a valuable and am@@ using lesson about security - but never cut someone &apos;s room with too@@ th@@ paste and sh@@ ampoo .
close your door and place your keys in a glass of water , which you then put in the freezer , but do not t@@ ack@@ down your poss@@ essions on the ceiling no more than twice .
town@@ houses for refugees , single @-@ educ@@ ators , Ger@@ ing@@ thick@@ ener
the real estate entrepren@@ eur Markus Gil@@ dner expands in the mid @-@ Frank@@ ish corner valley terrac@@ ed houses for people who don &apos;t have much money .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for example , for refugees - but also as a signal : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not only refugees need living space , but also the mother and the less deser@@ ved &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I show how to build a cheap and good build @-@ up today , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 44 @-@ year @-@ old in an interview . &quot; &quot; &quot;
thousands of refugees are displ@@ aced to the housing market .
the entrepren@@ eur Markus Gil@@ dner believes to know how quickly affordable housing can be created : he builds in a project terrac@@ ed houses for refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr Gil@@ dner , many refugees will push for the housing market . &quot; &quot; &quot;
which solution do you offer ?
Markus Gil@@ dner : the mass accommodation in containers or gymn@@ ast@@ ics has no sustainability .
for people remain here for a large part .
in view of the refugee flow we need sufficient living space in the coming decades .
a very ban@@ al , three @-@ storey terrac@@ ed house is the solution .
Gil@@ bert : a row house needs the least space .
it facilitates integration .
this is different when people are teaching people in blocks of blocks .
each of the six houses that are currently being built in the pilot project consists of three housing units for four asylum seek@@ ers each .
each unit has two bedrooms , a bathroom , a kitchen and a common room .
it can be that many refugees say it is peace again , I go back .
then the houses can be easily re@@ arranged according to the specific needs .
what are the costs ?
guil@@ d : the price for 160 square meters of living space per house is 184 000 euros , without plot .
this is man@@ age@@ able .
the construction took six months .
this is appropriate .
have the building regulations complicated their plans ?
Gil@@ dner : construc@@ ting my project correctly .
in particular , it always makes the imp@@ ending D@@ amo@@ kl@@ es@@ hah &apos;s special construction and the pitch regulation .
gr@@ us@@ el@@ ig .
it is still accommod@@ ated , who creates three apartments in a terrac@@ ed house , needs at least three pitches .
only in the cities there is a lack of space .
and refugees and asylum seek@@ ers do not have cars .
how did the residents react to their terrac@@ ed house project ?
Gil@@ dner : there were those who accused me of creating luxury buildings for asylum seek@@ ers .
what definitely isn &apos;t right .
but do you not ag@@ grav@@ ate the competition for affordable housing ?
Gil@@ bert : it &apos;s true : in the last five years we had a building boom in Germany , but built in luxury apartments , which can hardly afford any more .
my project has the message , also the normal people need living space .
not only refugees , but also the mother or the less deser@@ ved .
I &apos;ll show you how to build and build well today .
that is what it is about .

iOS 9 : how to get the new iPhone operating system when Apple update is released
&quot; &quot; &quot; the new operating system can be requested by going to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; General &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to the setup app and then select &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Software Update &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if it is ready , the phone gives you the option to download and then install .
some have encountered problems after installation because they get an error message telling that the &quot; software update failed . &quot;
to avoid the problem , users are advised to either wait until the rush is back or trying to update over iTunes .
the telephone will guide you through the rest of the process .
this may mean del@@ eting apps to create space - but Apple has made it more impro@@ b@@ able because of the sli@@ mming up of the updates . likewise , it will be easier to do so if you use a special tool to delete apps and then re@@ install them as soon as the process is complete .
it is worth to ensure that your mobile phone is charged during the update or is located near a charger , so that the battery is charged .
if the load is too low , Apple does not allow the update to continue since the phone may be off hal@@ f@@ way and this could lead to a demol@@ ition of the update .

this makes it possible to record chess players not able to raise the membership fee .
youth work and talent search are also to be promoted .
Gau@@ sel@@ mann wishes that the membership in the chess club and also friendly contact to the tennis club &quot; Red @-@ White &quot; is seen as an expression of his connection with the spa town .
Qu@@ arti@@ ers@@ büro seeks direct contact
&quot; &quot; &quot; Sal@@ udi@@ s and the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Alten@@ zentrum Anton@@ ist@@ ift &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; have joined the Social Foundation &apos;s man@@ tle and opened a new stop at the Graf @-@ St@@ auff@@ enberg Square . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition to consult@@ ations , you can also participate in courses .
the social foundation pul@@ ls it down from the mountain into the inner city .
more precisely at the Graf @-@ St@@ auff@@ enberg @-@ Platz .
a new district office was recently opened there .
here , directly next to the shopping market , we immediately receive elderly and coun@@ sel@@ ing information on issues such as the care insurance , or for the services of the health and care centres .
for years we have been established with our ambul@@ ant care service that often care@@ gi@@ vers are left alone .
there are infin@@ itely many questions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even though the complexity of the insur@@ ances is hardly understood , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained the new owner Jutta W@@ eig@@ and , who is responsible for the Anton@@ ist@@ ift and the Bürger@@ sp@@ ital as well as for the out@@ patient service &quot; Amadeus &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition to the consult@@ ations , the new district office also offers prevention , health courses and wellness .
for this purpose , the Sal@@ udi@@ s was taken into the boat .
it is therefore possible to use additional offers such as assault prevention , memory workouts or physi@@ otherapy treatment .
the offers from the Senior Centre and Sal@@ udi@@ s complement each other ideally .
Sal@@ udi@@ s stands for prevention , prevention and rehabilitation .
&quot; the senior Centre for Care and Care , &quot; Heike Rie@@ del , Managing Director of Sal@@ udi@@ s .
the reason for the opening of the new district office in the city centre will see both business leaders particularly in demo@@ graphic change .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this will make a good de@@ centralized infrastructure in the individual parts of Bamberg in the future . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , the mayor of Wolfgang Metz@@ ner ( SPD ) under@@ lined the inaugur@@ ation ceremony , the Qu@@ arti@@ ers@@ büro also dedic@@ ates itself to the association between the ages : &quot; there are numerous events and offers on the programme and they invite you to a regular soci@@ able be@@ is@@ am@@ ble . &quot;
this makes the social foundation a big contribution to the fact that sen@@ iors can live as independent and well in their familiar surroundings .
the Qu@@ arti@@ ers@@ büro is open Monday , Wednesday and Friday from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m. , Tuesday and Thursday from 4 p.m. to 6 p.m. and on Satur@@ days from 10 a.m. to noon .

men pru@@ dent on 17 @-@ year @-@ old Afgh@@ ans
witnesses seeks the police for an incident in Bad So@@ den @-@ Sal@@ mün@@ ster : on Friday evening , around 23.@@ 45 o &apos;clock , three young men were on foot from Bad So@@ den towards Sal@@ mün@@ ster .
one of the group , a 17 @-@ year @-@ old Afgh@@ an , followed the police to his two friends at a distance of about five meters and called them to wait for him .
at that time the group was at the level of the b@@ ft gas station .
there were also three persons on the site of the petrol station .
one of these men now sh@@ ou@@ ted the yo@@ ung@@ sters and hit the face with the f@@ ist .
the victim had suffered a nose and ble@@ eding strongly from the nose .
when his two friends hur@@ ried and compl@@ ained on the r@@ ack@@ et , he first let off his victim .
from his friends , the injured young man was brought home .
the perpet@@ r@@ ator followed the group with a car up to their home and drove there demonstr@@ atively several times .
when one did not see the vehicle any more , the injured went ahead of the building to smoke a cigar@@ ette .
there he was once again attacked by the r@@ ack@@ et and another male person .
using a head@@ stock , you checked on the face and the th@@ igh@@ s of the victim .
the injured person had to be hospit@@ alized to a hospital for the purpose of medical care .
to date , only a v@@ ague table description is available .
one of the men was about 1.80 meters in size .
the second bat would have been approximately 1.@@ 65 feet tall and was clo@@ thed with a je@@ ans and a brown @-@ white shirt .

Dr. Frank Müller ac@@ qui@@ res office breaks and inv@@ ests 3@@ 10000 Euro
Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll and Frank Müller ( from left ) take over the practice of Karl @-@ Heinrich and Ur@@ sel Fel@@ gen@@ ausen .
furthermore , the mayor Bernd Bor@@ mann , Wirtschafts@@ förder@@ in U@@ ta Sei@@ m @-@ Schw@@ art@@ z und As@@ endor@@ fs Bürgermeister Hein@@ sberg Kab@@ bert are also pleased about this .
in many places in the country doctors - As@@ endorf , on the other hand , has luck : there , Dr. Frank Müller takes over the practice field breaks on October 1st .
during Ur@@ sel Fel@@ is@@ ausen goes into retirement , her husband Karl @-@ Heinrich is still standing at the side of his successor in the next few months .
after a renovation phase , Müller opened the practice on 12 October , until then he invested 3@@ 10000 Euro in the premises at the St@@ .-@@ Mar@@ cell@@ us@@ strasse 6 .
it was sympathy at first glance , when the rock formation came to know Frank Müller and his wife Dr. Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll , who currently under@@ went her apprentices@@ hip in the Ver@@ dener Hospital and also wants to enter the practice this year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we always had in mind that the gar@@ bage would fit well into this practice , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Dr. Ur@@ sel Fel@@ ste@@ jn and laugh@@ s . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when it was so far , I simply called her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the couple Müller liked the idea to run their own practice in As@@ endorf in the future .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; proximity and constant contact with patients are very attractive to us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 39 @-@ year @-@ old Müller . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to get to know and accompany families over the years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as an advantage , he also sees his own boss .
and so it was agreed that the Müll@@ ers bought the house with practice .
they will continue to live in Bruch@@ hausen @-@ Vil@@ sen .
the tw@@ o@@ fold family father Frank Müller was also grown up there , his medical studies in Hanover followed stations in several medical practices as well as in hospitals in Sul@@ ingen , Ni@@ enburg and Rot@@ enburg .
he is currently working as a general practition@@ er in Sul@@ ingen , and he was appointed Chief Emer@@ gency in 2009 in Die@@ ph@@ olz County and is involved voluntarily in the DRC @-@ read@@ iness of Bruch@@ hausen @-@ Vil@@ sen .
from the 19th of September , the practice will be prepared for the new boss .
while the sur@@ geon Dr. Karl @-@ Heinrich Fel@@ is@@ ausen works as a Haus@@ practition@@ er , his wife Ur@@ sel ( Inter@@ ni@@ st@@ in ) speci@@ alises in gast@@ ro@@ enter@@ ology .
the gar@@ bage , both inter@@ ni@@ sts , want to settle down as a house@@ holder .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the end@@ os@@ copy comes out , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 38 @-@ year @-@ old Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the reconstruction , the rooms will look more modern .
we will offer more ultr@@ as@@ ound examinations as well as long @-@ term and resi@@ li@@ ent EK@@ Gs and need a speaking room more .
in addition , the ED@@ V is completely renewed .
the Müll@@ ers receive a grant from a total of 50,000 euros as part of a funding program from the district ( 25@@ 000 Euro ) as well as from the joint municipality ( 12@@ 500 Euro ) and the municipality ( 12@@ 500 Euro ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this shows how proud and glad we are that the practice is continued , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stres@@ ses the Lord Mayor Bernd Bor@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll , about 2000 patients come into practice in the field of field breaks , in which North German average practice is about 500 .
in As@@ endorf there is another doctor &apos;s practice .
a positive side effect of the practical tak@@ eover by Frank Müller : the pharmacy remains according to Ur@@ sel Fel@@ gen@@ ausen in As@@ endorf .
if no successor had been found , she would have gone .
who visits Müll@@ ers &apos;s talk @-@ hour , inci@@ dentally also looks in familiar faces : takes over the seven medical staff and the cleaning power from the rock formation .
with their f@@ are@@ well , an era ends in As@@ endorf , after all , the medical profession has practic@@ ed for 30 years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the beginning we had only two rooms , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ur@@ sel Fel@@ is@@ ville re@@ members . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a little melan@@ chol@@ y they already feel after the long time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we continue to live in Hohen@@ lo@@ or and will surely see many patients &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says the Inter@@ ni@@ st@@ in . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; her husband adds : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have a 6,@@ 000 square meter plot . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so far I always pressed myself in front of gardening , now that could be different . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , the pair has two grand@@ children and likes to travel .
Croatia : &quot; we leave the refugees through &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now border controls are also elevated to our southern border , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Minister @-@ Minister Johanna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the border controls at the Hungarian border remain parallel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; still , it is clear that everyone who wants to put an asylum request can do so &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the care and safety of people is in the fore@@ ground .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but it is clear , however , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that it needs clear signals , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Minister . &quot; &quot; &quot;
people need to know that we do not accept limit@@ less migration flows , not via the Austrian @-@ Sloven@@ ian border .
it needs a controlled approach .
Croatia sa@@ ws &quot; cor@@ ridor &quot; - Slovenia ref@@ uses
the Croatian government had previously announced that Slovenia wanted to continue travelling to Austria and Germany in the direction of Austria and Germany and , under certain circumstances , establish cor@@ rid@@ ors for the refugees .
this is how this interior minister Ves@@ na Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar in Lai@@ bach did not see .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the idea of cor@@ rid@@ ors is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; absolutely un@@ acceptable &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Slovenia would rather intensi@@ fy the monitoring of the border - especially in Hungary . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the other hand , the border with Croatia is already strongly controlled as the border of the Schengen area . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as the Minister stressed , in this way Slo@@ veni@@ ans wants to stone its borders for refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; each EU member must fulfil its obligations , otherwise the system cannot function , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as the Croatian government r@@ ushed , the first refugees had already tried to arrive in Eastern Croatia at the border crossing T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik / Si@@ d in order to avoid registration .
the Croatian police were able to attack them in the nearby ma@@ ize fields .
according to local media ever since , the Croatian T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik constantly meets police vehicles with new refugees .
it is mainly about Syri@@ ans and Afgh@@ ans , including numerous women and children .
rescue services and Red Cross are already in use .
in the days to come , his country has more than 4000 refugees , said Minister of Interior , R@@ ank@@ o O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic .
in addition , buses from Pre@@ se@@ vo on the Mac@@ ed@@ onian Serbian border , which have hi@@ ther@@ to brought migrants to the Hungarian border , diver@@ ted towards Croatia , reported Croatian and Serbian media in accordance with Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , the government in Belgrade denied that it was to suggest the people to propose definite routes : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; neither can we , nor do we want to do that , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the media reports , in the morning , a first bus with around 50 refugees arrived in the Serbian border town of Si@@ d , in the course of the day further buses would be expected .
about Croatia , Slovenia and Austria to Germany
the in@@ mates were traveling throughout the night of the Mac@@ ed@@ onian border around 500 kilometers away from Serbia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have heard that Hungary has made us , so the police said that we are to go here , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said one of the refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they wanted to travel further to Germany through Croatia , Slovenia and Austria .
this could now actually come to a slightly further west @-@ west part of the previous post@@ pon@@ ement of the former Balkan Route Turkey @-@ Greece @-@ Macedonia @-@ Serbia @-@ Hungary to a somewhat further west @-@ west route .
Croatia : &quot; comprehensive possibilities for border control &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Croatia &apos;s interior minister O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic stressed earlier that his country has prepared adequate plans for potential withdrawal conditions in the fall of a strong influ@@ x of refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he did not call details , but pointed out that Croatia as a non @-@ Schengen member has &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comprehensive possibilities for border control &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you perform rig@@ orous checks to qualify for membership in the Schengen area .
Slovenia has been part of this since 2007 , the EU partners set up a good testimony to the country since then , as regards the standard of border controls .
on the Serbian side , about 300 refugees are stuck behind the Hungarian border fence .
according to Belgrade &apos;s media reports , they had spent the past night at the Grenz@@ über@@ gang Hor@@ gos , which leads to R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
according to the Hungarian authorities , the two border cross@@ ings Hor@@ gos and Back@@ i Bre@@ g continue to remain completely closed .
whether the remaining refugees are now wanting to go on to the Croatian border is still un@@ clear .
the Serbian Interior Minister N@@ ebo@@ j@@ sa Stef@@ ano@@ vic was trying to calm down on Wednesday morning at a local ophthalm@@ ologist : he kept the debates about alternative routes of refugees after the Hungarian border is now closed for premature ejaculation .
it would not be dealing with very high numbers of refugees at the moment .
one cannot yet say whether they would continue their journey through Hungary , Croatia or another country .
hel@@ pers advise Mig@@ rants - dangerous - alternative routes
however , private Hungarian refugees have already begun to distribute maps on which alternative routes are drawn through Croatia .
however , the border crossing between Serbia and Croatia is not dangerous : in parts of the border area there are still 20 years after the end of the Croatian war still not cleared min@@ e@@ fields .
on Wednesday afternoon , the Croatian police announced that a team of mine clearance was sent in the border region .
stock exchanges : Ukra@@ inians pay 30 million dollars
Su@@ pran@@ on@@ ok is said to have heard a ring of cy@@ ber crimin@@ als accused of having provided insight into yet un@@ published financial reports and press releases on websites such as Business Wire , Market@@ wi@@ red and PR News@@ wire since 2010 .
with the information captured , in@@ sider trading in the financial markets should have been made .
in this way , the investig@@ ators had a total of more than 100 million dollars .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today &apos;s comparison shows that even those outside our borders will ultimately be caught , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the S@@ EC announcement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the proceedings against 32 further accused in the case lasted .
most of the def@@ endants come from Ukraine and Georgia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the perpet@@ rators are to have acted both in the US and Eastern Europe . &quot; &quot; &quot;
ec@@ umen@@ ical Hosp@@ ice Mannheim has existed for 20 years
around the Mannheim Par@@ ade@@ platz re@@ igns supreme .
the people do their concern , partly quick steps , partly cosy .
they control the two stations of the Mannheim car park at the Par@@ ade@@ platz .
keep track of the city .
&quot; &quot; &quot; pul@@ s@@ ating , spr@@ inkl@@ ing life with glorious autumn sunlight and in the midst of four big boards each with the heading &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Before I die I want to die .... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical hosp@@ ice helped with this action at its 20 @-@ year anniversary and is quite confronted with mixed reactions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s about life , so we went with the action in the middle of the city and among people , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Jos@@ ef@@ ine Lam@@ mer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the head of the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical Hosp@@ ice Help is available to the pass@@ ers as well for questions and conversations as volunteers .
while some passengers spont@@ ane@@ ously interv@@ ene in the chal@@ k and affir@@ m the sentence &quot; my life affir@@ ming , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; can read &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the camper through the USA , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stop the war &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not suffer long &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; others stay short , read , say pro@@ positions as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so far I am not yet &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and go on . &quot; &quot; &quot;
again and again there are little discussions about the action in itself , about life , dealing with dying .
Peter H@@ üb@@ inger is also on the spot .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only if I make clear that for me some@@ time the end of this world comes , I can live responsi@@ bly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the director of the Di@@ ak@@ onic work Mannheim , which is together with the Car@@ it@@ as@@ verband bear@@ er of the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical Hospital . &quot; &quot; &quot;
that is why this public @-@ effective promotion is good for 20 @-@ year @-@ olds .
the fact that not everyone wants to share in the tables publicly , is understand@@ able , after all , it is a very personal thing .
the subject of death and death is still aff@@ licted with tab@@ oos , so the experience of Jos@@ ef@@ ine Lam@@ mer , although the hosp@@ ice movement has helped a lot in recent years that people open themselves .
an estim@@ ation divi@@ ding Angel@@ ika Go@@ def@@ ro@@ id .
the dying and fun@@ eral accompan@@ ist is one of the hon@@ orary members of the first hour .
through personal experience confronted with the subject , she read a lot of literature and decided to become involved in eu@@ than@@ asia .
when the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical Hosp@@ ice A@@ id sought an hon@@ orary official , she immediately reported and had been with the foundation in 1995 .
Go@@ def@@ ro@@ id belongs to a team of 45 volunteers - 43 women and two men - those affected and relatives in private households , hospitals , nursing homes and in hosp@@ ice Saint Vincent .
all of them are carefully trained .
Angel@@ ika Go@@ def@@ ro@@ id can handle her duties and experiences and experiences .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I see the life of another warning , it &apos;s precious and desirable for the moment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the offer of the ec@@ umen@@ ical ec@@ umen@@ ical care service is free of charge and non @-@ religious .
the financial support of the health insurance funds and donations of relatives and associations allows the training as well as further training and super@@ visions of the mort@@ al and fun@@ eral directors .
every two years training is offered for new employees .
the tables described on Saturday are now exhibited in the house of the protest@@ ant church ( M1 , 1@@ a ) and in the House of the Catholic Church ( F2 , 6 ) .
further personal wishes on post@@ cards can also be noted there .
F@@ ed@@ Ex result mixed , financial outlook for 2016 lo@@ wered
F@@ ed@@ Ex reports dis@@ ap@@ pointing results for the last quarter , and the Lie@@ fer @-@ Gig@@ ant sen@@ sed his earnings outlook for a whole year because of the weaker demand for cargo services and higher costs in his soil transport service .
the company also said that it plans to hire some 5@@ 5,000 seasonal workers for the holiday .
at this time in the past year F@@ ed@@ Ex announced that 50,000 seasonal workers would like to set up 50,000 seasonal workers .
the share fell over 2.5 percent in the market trading 45 minutes before the opening on Wednesday .
F@@ ed@@ Ex Corp. said , earning a profit between 10,40 € and 10,90 $ in the financial year that ends in May , 20 c@@ ents less than in previous forecast .
analysts expected according to a survey of Fac@@ t@@ Set 10.@@ 84 $ .
the lower prospect will be in spite of the price increases , which will be 4.9 percent on average and will be effective on January 4 , and despite higher sur@@ charges for ground transportation of heavy and large par@@ c@@ els , which will be collected from November .
the company said it still expect the result to be increased compared to the previous year due to cost reduction , higher revenue and growth in online retail .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said that the company provides &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; solid yields &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when considering weaker than expected economic conditions , especially in manufacturing and global trade . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the plans for vac@@ ations were announced one day later than that of the ri@@ val U@@ PS , which plans to employ 9@@ 0,000 to 9@@ 5,000 additional labour , for example the same number as last year .
in the quarter ended on 31 August , F@@ ed@@ Ex included $ 692 million , 6 percent more than in the previous year .
the earnings per share stood at 2,42 US $ per share , just behind the 2.@@ 44 $ per share , the twelve analysts predicted by Z@@ acks Investment Research .
sales rose by 5 percent to 12.@@ 3 billion euros .
six of Z@@ acks asked Anal@@ ysts expected $ 12.@@ 23 billion .
F@@ ed@@ Ex has a decline in international priority shipping in recent years , which brought sales in its unit express shipping to the stag@@ nat@@ ing .
but the boom in online shopping has increased the results at F@@ ed@@ Ex Ground .
in the last quarter , ship@@ ments increased by 29 per cent , but the operating result was basically flat due to higher costs for larger packages and self @-@ insurance .
the Express unit recorded higher income attri@@ but@@ able to higher prices , while the result fell due to higher labour costs in freight business .
in the market trading , approximately one hour before the opening , the F@@ ed@@ Ex shares declined by $ 3.@@ 85 , or 2.5 percent , to 15@@ 0.15 $ .
on Tuesday they included 11 percent loss for the year and 17 percent below a record high on June 11 .
on their most anticipated conference in the year Federal Reserve Str@@ ate@@ gen spend two days a week sitting around a 27 @-@ foot Hondur@@ an Mah@@ ag@@ oni table to decide whether it is time for the first time for almost a decade to raise the Leit@@ z@@ ins .
above them at one end of the decorated two @-@ story sitting hall there is a m@@ ural of the United States .
the card is a reminder that the F@@ ed President Jan@@ et L. Y@@ ellen and her colleagues shall put the economic interests of the nation before all other things .
the central bank has a two @-@ fold mandate from the congress : maxim@@ ising US employment and prices here stable .
but since the Great Rec@@ ession , the F@@ ed leaders acknowledged that there is an un@@ written third mandate : financial stability .
and this third mandate could be the X @-@ factor in a decision that is too tight to predi@@ ct it . it will be announced on Thursday that the US economy is ready to be reconc@@ iled by the un@@ parall@@ eled incenti@@ ve given by the near @-@ zero short term interest rate since the end of 2008 .
although most of the data in the economy show that it is growing solid , the recent turbul@@ ence on the global financial markets can fri@@ gh@@ ten the already c@@ auti@@ ous F@@ ed representatives to strengthen this vol@@ at@@ ility by raising the interest rate for federal debt - and it is also just a quarter percentage point .
&quot; obviously , the labour market and inflation in the first place will be the most important thing they observe , &quot; said Lind@@ sey M. Pi@@ eg@@ za , chief econom@@ ist at the Mak@@ ler@@ company Sti@@ fel Nicol@@ aus &amp; Co .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I think if they were looking for a pre@@ text to not raise interest rate , the increased uncertainty surrounding the global market is enough just@@ ification to continue to wait , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is no con@@ sensus on what the F@@ ed will do , which un@@ sec@@ ures in itself the financial market .
about half of the econom@@ ists who have recently been question@@ ed by Blo@@ om@@ berg have predicted an interest rate this week .
the financial markets , however , expect to wait for the F@@ ed , with a key indicator , which shows only a 30 % chance of an increase .
this indicates a decline in the stock market if the F@@ ed increases the sentence , unless the strategi@@ sts mit@@ ig@@ ate the blow , promising another increase is far away .
on Tuesday the D@@ ow Jones Industrial average score by 2@@ 28,@@ 89 points or by 1.4 % to 16,@@ 59@@ 9,@@ 85 .
the action was triggered by expectations that the F@@ ed policy maintains the sentence this week , said John Lon@@ ski , Chief Econom@@ ist at Moo@@ dy &apos;s Capital Markets Research Group .
it would be a surprise if the F@@ ed would lift the sentences at that point , &quot; he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if she does it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she would have to go very far in her statement to calm the financial markets so she doesn &apos;t get into pan@@ ic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
other experts argu@@ ed that a interest rate would calm the financial markets because they would eliminate uncertainty about when the F@@ ed would act .
another month ago the F@@ ed seemed to increase the set by 0.25 percentage points this month , the first small step in a slow shar@@ pen@@ ing of monetary conditions that would test the strength of recovery in the US .
Y@@ ellen had said in spring and early summer that this year , despite the complaints of liber@@ als , that more economic advance would be required , an increase in the pro@@ position would be expected .
although job creation s@@ lowed down in August , the improvement in the labour market was solid this year .
the unemployment rate dropped to 5.1 % last month , the lowest for over seven years and near the level that the F@@ ed sees as full employment .
wage increases have shown signs of recovery .
and although inflation was constantly below the target of 2 % of the central bank , the F@@ ed representatives said that the main reason was the temporary impact of significantly lower oil prices .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the economy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; can cope with higher interest rates and needs it because of tension on the labour market , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ian Sh@@ ep@@ her@@ dson , chief econom@@ ist at Pan@@ the@@ on Macro@@ economics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the financial markets around the world gathered together at the end of last month , after China de@@ valu@@ ated its currency .
the D@@ ow Jones Industrial average value fell by more than 16 % in May , when investors were afraid that the slow@@ down of the Chinese economy would boost global growth .
the market has recovered slightly this month , the D@@ ow is now at almost 10 % below the high @-@ end of May .
for the F@@ ed representatives , market turbul@@ ences affect complex calculations , when to increase interest rates .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the events on the financial markets and the news on the weakness of the Chinese economy had not occurred in the past few weeks , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Stephen D. O@@ liner , Senior Research Fel@@ low on U@@ C@@ LA Zim@@ an Center for Real Estate and a former employee of the U.S. staff . &quot; &quot; &quot;
now he predi@@ cts that they will wait at least one month to get the effect better .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is a lot of uncertainty about what will be the impact on the US economy and there are almost no reliable data describing the developments in China , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said O@@ liner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the health of the world economy is none of the main concerns of the F@@ ed , so it should not be included in the decision @-@ making process technically .
but in the end , the F@@ ed Monetary Fund has become the world .
the influence of the central bank has been enormous in recent years .
the mere hint of the former director Ben S. Bern@@ anke in 2013 , that the F@@ ed could &quot; narrow &quot; their monetary expansion , &quot; del@@ eting confusion around the globe .
in a world where markets and economies are increasingly inter@@ tw@@ ined , F@@ ed representatives can be expected to not only monitor developments elsewhere , but also consult other central banks and experts to gain a better understanding of the global economy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; their decision @-@ making is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more art than science &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Z@@ ach@@ ary Kar@@ ab@@ ell , head of the global strategy for asset management of the company &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; En@@ vest@@ net Inc . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Jeff@@ rey L@@ acker , President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Rich@@ mond , VA . , re@@ marked this month that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the F@@ ed has a history of transactions on financial market movements , which seem to be linked with the economic fundament@@ als . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
L@@ acker , Member of the Federal Open Market Committee , who advoc@@ ates interest in interest , c@@ ited decisions in the years 1998 / 1999 as an example .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a financial crisis in Asia led the F@@ ed to cut its Leit@@ z@@ ins by 0.75 percent@@ ages in three sessions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; despite limited recognis@@ able effects on growth in the US , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said L@@ acker . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a year later the F@@ ed Represent@@ atives refused these cuts .
the F@@ ed should only place aspects of financial stability in the first place during a severe crisis such as market re@@ unification in 2008 , said Adam S. Pos@@ en , former member of the Board of Inter@@ est in the Bank of England .
the recent turbul@@ ences do not come close to that level , he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she certainly does not want to get into the situation in which she is afraid of a interest in interest , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Pos@@ en , President of the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Federal Reserve Act always includes the double mandate and does not mention financial stability , and until this is changed , I don &apos;t think it should rush ahead of time .

Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da : small Leben@@ sh@@ ilfe für refugees
more and more refugees arrive in Germany these days .
to give you a warm welcome , not without the commitment of countless volunteer hel@@ pers .
also in Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da there are a number of people who support un@@ sel@@ fish asylum seek@@ ers in the city .
they belong to them Petra and Klaus H@@ eine .
Petra H@@ eine is a teacher of body and soul .
she still loves to teach her 74 lessons .
every Thursday she is doing it in the asylum seek@@ ers at D@@ ill@@ inger Straße .
it helps refugees from Syria , Kur@@ dist@@ an , Kosovo and Pakistan to learn German .
of course , the very different teaching is at a right school .
Brasi@@ li@@ ens pa@@ edi@@ at@@ ric society Rio Grande promotes nutrition for healthy breast@@ feeding
the Brazilian pa@@ edi@@ at@@ ric organization SP@@ RS tries to educ@@ ate women in a sho@@ cking way how important good nutrition during breast@@ feeding is . it does this with the presentation of pictures of babies who su@@ ck in breasts which are painted with depic@@ tions of un@@ healthy foods .
breast milk consists of a variety of proteins , fats , vitamins and carbohydrates that give babies all the nutrients they need to build a strong immune system .
due to the additional energy requirements pregnant and young mothers advised to increase their daily cal@@ orie intake by about 500 calories per day .
however , new research results indicate that higher cal@@ orie intake is not the only dietary modification that mothers should make .
a recent study conducted by Robert Water@@ land , Professor at the Bay@@ lor College of Medicine in Texas , showed that healthy eating pregnant women actually affects the genes of their babies and protects them from the development of tum@@ ours .
unfortunately , an un@@ healthy diet of the child can neg@@ atively affect the immune system .
exceptions for the new ber@@ n@@ rie@@ der Sp@@ orth@@ alle
the municipal council Bern@@ ried granted the construction application for the 2.3 million euros costly sports hall .
and he made an exception .
the roof can be flat for solar installation .
the planning for the long @-@ awa@@ ited turn@@ out of the sports grounds move forward step by step : in the recent meeting session , the elabor@@ ated building application was approved un@@ anim@@ ously without major discussions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; previously the committee had decided , among other things , an application for an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; resp@@ ectable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exemp@@ tion from the valid development plan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exception &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was the permission for a special form regarding the roof construction . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; accordingly , a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; saddle roof with non @-@ centre first and roof over@@ hang &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; should be erected . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the planned use of the roof surface for solar installations is the background of the planning : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we get a wonder@@ fully large southern roof together , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; declared Mayor Josef St@@ eigen@@ berger at the meeting . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the &quot; liberation &quot; again , it was about the ti@@ lt that was prescribed for energetic reasons - differently from the development plan - under ten degrees .
this considerably reduces the volume of the hall .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; liberation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was therefore necessary because the cultivation plan has no &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exceptions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with regard to the roof ti@@ lt - whereby the ber@@ n@@ rie@@ der Gemein@@ der@@ at usually de@@ votes more restri@@ ctive in the case of fre@@ eing employment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not create preced@@ ents , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says St@@ eigen@@ berger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the gymn@@ asi@@ um building at the Sports Centre is a joint project of the municipality and SV Bern@@ ried .
around 2.3 million euros are calculated at cost .
subsidies are expected from school and public transport .
in the next step of the procedure , the building application for the 18 x 36 meter hall will now be submitted to the Land@@ rat@@ samt .
Klinik P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg moves to Sch@@ ong@@ au
the P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg hospital is expected to be closed earlier than planned - namely 2016 .
at the same time , Dr. Wilhelm Fischer ( 66 ) becomes the new medical director at the Sch@@ ong@@ au Hospital .
the station and the majority of employees move from P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
this shows the surprising plans of the hospital GmbH of the county , confirmed by the Coun@@ c@@ ill@@ or Andrea Jo@@ chner @-@ Weiß .
however , a decision on this is the super@@ visory board , and the next Wednesday , September 23 .
if plans are implemented , all of the 50 employees would go on to the hospital in P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg .
the vast majority should move with fishermen and the existing inner station to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
the rooms are available .
the employees who cannot go to Sch@@ ong@@ au should be offered a workplace in Wei@@ l@@ heim , so Jo@@ chner @-@ Weiß .
the employees are informed of the plans .
the change has spar@@ ked the dism@@ iss@@ al of Dr. Andreas E@@ der , who has only been a medical director of the Sch@@ ong@@ au clinic since the beginning of the year , and now changes to a private practice in close proximity of the hospital .
the question of who is to follow the follow @-@ up came to Jo@@ chner @-@ Weiß , the name &quot; Fischer , &quot; who agreed to take the lead on October 1 and to switch with his team to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for the house in Sch@@ ong@@ au , this in each case signi@@ fies a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; appreciation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and a broad@@ ening of the offer in the field of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Internal Medicine &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; meaning Jo@@ chner @-@ White . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Fischer is a specialist for p@@ ac@@ em@@ akers and de@@ fi@@ brill@@ ators .
Sch@@ ong@@ au ( 180 beds ) is specialized inside station on gast@@ ro@@ enter@@ ological diseases .
for the next two years , Fischer talks to his team , if the Supervisory Board agre@@ es to agree to both houses until next year the former hospital of the Kn@@ app@@ ort , which has more than 35 beds , is to be finally concluded in P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg after almost 140 years .
until now , the district had planned this for 2018 if the currently running refurb@@ ishment at the Wei@@ l@@ heim hospital has been completed .
Coun@@ t@@ ess Jo@@ chner @-@ Weiß , who is also Chairman of the Supervisory Board , met rum@@ ors that the house , which is in possession of the Bundes@@ kn@@ app@@ schaft , will in future be used as housing for asylum seek@@ ers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this I excl@@ ude . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as it continues with the property , Jo@@ chner @-@ White could not say , there are several considerations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
currently there are a short term care of Car@@ itas and a day@@ care psychiat@@ ry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what better could not happen to us , such an opportunity does not come again , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fischer about the quasi @-@ moving to the Le@@ ch , which was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; positive and very understanding &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by the staff . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have not given a real perspective for the house where fisher@@ man has worked as chief physician for more than 30 years .
he was asked by Sch@@ ong@@ auer colleagues to take over the position of the medical director .
in recent decades , the P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg hospital ( once 100 beds ) has always been threatened by closure , departments have been closed , for example surgery and obst@@ et@@ rics .
the hand@@ b@@ aller of the Rhine @-@ Neck@@ ar lions are demanded ton@@ ight ( 8.@@ 15 p.m. ) at the Berg@@ ischen HC .
the leader of the Bundes@@ liga is indeed the clear favourite in Wuppertal , but there is no reason for arrogan@@ ce .
in the past season , the b@@ athers made a painful defeat at the B@@ HC and made a bit dirty there .
hunting ev@@ ap@@ oration with two wounded at Pr@@ at@@ au
two tractor drivers were severely injured during their ma@@ ize harvest on Tuesday afternoon .
during the ab@@ st@@ ition on a corn field near Pr@@ at@@ au ( district of Witt@@ enberg ) several h@@ unters were in use , as the police shared .
after a shot , a 63@@ - and a 22 @-@ year @-@ old man suffered severe injuries and were brought to hospitals .
how exactly it could happen to the accident was un@@ clear at first .
the Krimin@@ al@@ po@@ liz@@ ei is determined .

a susp@@ ect has led the police to the cor@@ p@@ se of 16 @-@ year @-@ olds from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ in@@ ate .
in inter@@ ro@@ g@@ ation the 20 @-@ year @-@ old gave birth to the yo@@ ung@@ sters and threw their bodies into a channel in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen .
a 16 year old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ in@@ ate , who has been missing since Saturday , has fallen victim to a violent crime .
the body of the young woman was found on Tuesday evening in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen near Kais@@ ers@@ lau@@ tern , as public prosec@@ utor and police secre@@ ted on Wednesday .
as an active susp@@ ect , a 20 @-@ year @-@ old , also arrested on Tuesday evening , is , according to the fact , st@@ amped and the investig@@ ators led to the discovery site of the dead .
the 16 @-@ year @-@ old was reported missing on Sunday morning after having arrived at home on the eve after a visit of a autumn festival in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen .
when searching for the young woman , the investig@@ ators first met personal bel@@ ong@@ ings of the victim .
in the case of inter@@ ro@@ g@@ ations in the circle of friends and acquain@@ t@@ ances , a crime against the 20 @-@ year @-@ old finally sur@@ rendered .
the alleged perpet@@ r@@ ator then led the police to a channel in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen , where the cor@@ p@@ se was found .
the arrested was reported to the authorities in police inter@@ ro@@ g@@ ation , killed the 16 @-@ year @-@ old and put the cor@@ p@@ ses into the canal .
the 20 @-@ year @-@ old was to be led on Wednesday to the fun@@ nel , the investig@@ ators put the load to the load .
the further investigation should bring about the near@@ er circumstances of action .
refugees need accommodation : study cau@@ tions about vulner@@ ability
the location on the German housing market is ten@@ se .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more and more refugees are seeking a paid stay . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the pressure on the housing market is growing .
social housing is facing a challenge .
the distribution of distribution on the German housing market has long since begun .
with the coming refugees and job@@ seek@@ ers from the EU , more and more people push for a market that is already over@@ bur@@ dened in many cities .
they compete with low @-@ income citizens around the last affordable apartments .
in order to meet the demand for affordable housing , 400@@ ,000 new units would have to be built by 2020 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this results in a study commissioned by the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Social Housing Construction &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; federation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for comparison : in Germany 26@@ 0,000 units will be completed this year .
that means 14@@ 0,000 dwell@@ ings are missing .
after the first three months of their stay , refugees are no longer oblig@@ ated to live as asylum seek@@ ers in an initial adoption .
many then come across the housing market and enter the long queu@@ es in front of the apartments .
according to the Federal Stati@@ stical Office , however , less than half of all asylum seek@@ ers lived for rent last year .
however , the negative development of the housing market is not only due to the rising number of refugees .
the study also makes significant om@@ issions in the housing construction policy of recent years .
Germany imposed a housing defic@@ it in front of itself , which will grow from year to year .
currently , around 77@@ 0,000 units were missing in the metro@@ politan areas , Matthias Günther , author of the study .
many professionals therefore lived in large cities not@@ e@@ worthy in WG @-@ rooms .
young adults stayed longer in &quot; Hotel Mama &quot; because of the built in the housing market .
in the big cities , the number of square meters per cap@@ ita has decreased once again in recent years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in order to solve the problem , the alliance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Social Housing Construction &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; propos@@ es a re@@ boot . &quot; &quot; &quot;
new incenti@@ ves will boost the social housing construction again .
thus , the property tax might be w@@ ai@@ ved and the basic tax for subsidi@@ zed apartments will be suspended .
moreover , according to the alliance , attractive tax de@@ preci@@ ation possibilities are necessary .
the funding program for Refu@@ ge@@ es of the State Bank Kf@@ W is already well received in cities and municipalities .
a good week after the start , with 184 million euros on the Monday night , more than half of the available around 300 million euros have been rec@@ alled .
now the project could even be st@@ acked .
refugees have free money : Croatia and Slovenia address cor@@ ridor
there is practically no escape to Hungary , as more and more refugees choose the way to travel across Croatia .
Zagreb announces passing through Slovenia to the north without hur@@ d@@ les .
but the route is dangerous .
Croatia wants to communicate with the neighbouring country of Slovenia via the establishment of a cor@@ ridor for refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I spoke with the Sloven@@ ian Minister of Interior and if necessary we will organise a cor@@ ridor &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said the Croatian Interior Minister R@@ ank@@ o O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Slovenia is situated between Croatia and Austria and is already part of the Schengen area .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the EU country of Croatia is not yet a Schengen country . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the exter@@ mination of the Serbian @-@ Hungarian border , hundreds of refugees came to Croatia to get to Western Europe from there .
500 people came across the border at T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik , reported the Croatian TV station RT@@ L .
on the eve of Hungary Hungary had sealed off its border for refugees .
new laws , which came into force on the same day , virtually elimin@@ ating ordinary asylum procedures in Hungary .
Croatia wants to let the refugees happen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Croatian Prime Minister Zor@@ an Mil@@ ano@@ vic said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they can travel through and we prepare ourselves for this possibility . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these people are there , there are women , children and men who want to live and achieve something .
however , people who did not want to live in Croatia were people who did not want to live in Croatia .
the Croatian police had taken up the first refugees at the border of Serbia in the morning to the EU neighbouring country of Croatia .
according to most of the media reports , from Syria , Iran and Afghanistan .
they came by bus and tax@@ is to the Serbian border town of Si@@ d .
immediately after their arrival they would have tried to walk across the green border to Croatia .
at the Croatian @-@ Serbian border , the refugees are not at border f@@ ences .
there are other dangers for this : there are still sharp mines from the Yugosla@@ vian civil war in the 1990s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mine clean@@ ers are now to quickly create a safe passage . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after Hungary , there are hardly any more refugees after the closing of the border .
on Tuesday the police en@@ vis@@ aged 366 .
shortly before the closure on Monday there had been 9@@ 380 .
the new Hungarian laws were over@@ coming and dam@@ aging the border fence as a criminal offen@@ se .
therefore 35 criminal proceedings were initiated in the south @-@ Hungarian border town Sz@@ eg@@ ed .
sentenced to five years and deport@@ ation from the country .
according to the immigration authority , a total of 94 asylum applications have been established on Tuesday in the newly established &quot; transit zones &quot; on Tuesday , of which nearly all - 93 - the most important transition in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
among the exhibitors are 13 families with small children and two older people .
on Wednesday morning 40 refugees had stopped there .
practically no one has a prospect of getting asylum in Hungary .
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to Hungarian opinion , Serbia is a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; safe third country &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the rejected asylum seek@@ ers should be deport@@ ed there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; just a few hundred refugees were gathered in front of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; transit one &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke workers began to clean up with it .
they gathered the rub@@ b@@ ish that tens of thousands of people left by the road@@ side over the past few weeks .
lock lat@@ ches were dismant@@ led and one of the record stores in the bor@@ der@@ land was rebuilt .
no one wanted to express itself to the goal of this conversion .
after the closure of the border between Serbia and Hungary , Austria only reaches a few refugees .
the country has also strengthened its border controls .
around 20,000 migrants were still in the country , but still in the country .
around 1400 people are waiting for the trip to Germany in Salzburg .
the train traffic from there to Germany was stopped at the instruction of German authorities in the morning .
in Freil@@ assing we regularly met small groups of refugees on foot .
Mayor drove &quot; str@@ and@@ ete &quot; over the border
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we were busy after the Br@@ ücken@@ set on Sunday with the clearing , when there were suddenly ten people with travel agents at the entrance of the tent , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wern@@ stein mayor Alo@@ is Stad@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot;
tourists , they wanted by train to Pass@@ au .
because Germany had surprisingly shut down the rail traffic with Austria on Sunday because of the refugee flow , he was at the end of Wern@@ stein , &quot; says Stad@@ ler , who immediately offered his help and worked with two other hel@@ pers and their cars across the border into the Nah@@ e Pass@@ au .
before we had tast@@ ed the un@@ expect@@ edly guests only once , with snack and drinks .
we said , we bring it by car to Pass@@ au .
&quot; that was a matter of course for us , &quot; says Stad@@ ler in the O@@ Ö@@ N conversation .
they were very grateful .
a man refused to hand over a generous donation - 100 Euro for the fire bri@@ g@@ ade .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this made us very happy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Stad@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Sunday evening in Wels , the str@@ anded train passengers had switched from a ICE to Pass@@ au in a regional train , so that the railway traffic to Germany was stopped at short notice , but still trying to cross the border .
the regional train was put off at the Inn in front of the border in Wern@@ stein .
in Wern@@ stein the border crossing is generally high in the course .
the bridge @-@ party connected with the Bavarian neigh@@ bors on Sunday soci@@ ably , day before a two @-@ bridge @-@ run sporty - organized by the Union of Wern@@ stein and Bavaria from Neu@@ kirchen .
that Viktor Or@@ b@@ án has now sent further z@@ ig@@ thousands to us is a logical result of a hypo@@ critical policy :
instead of helping in the camp of R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke immediately at the establishment of structures that guarantee humanity , our Chancellor has officially moved the position of the Hungarian government into the m@@ ist of National Soci@@ alism .
the mour@@ ning of this policy is not only those Austri@@ ans who are now confronted in the border regions with cha@@ otic conditions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; even the refugees will have to realize that the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yellow country &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which they invited and welcomed , nothing but another refugee camp . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will be a big challenge , in view of the ongoing refugee streams and the approaching winter , with us to produce decent conditions for protection @-@ seek@@ ers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and it will be an even greater - to maintain peace , security and stability in Austria .
Konrad in search of 35,@@ 000 winter@@ proof neighbor@@ hoods
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Con@@ rad has fully committed all hands with the refugee movement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Christian Konrad is used to his word weight .
the government has used the former powerful Rai@@ ff@@ eisen bank@@ ers to provide lod@@ g@@ ings for thousands of refugees .
the chaos in the first recording centre Tra@@ is@@ kirchen has already taken hold of Konrad .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have no hom@@ eless more in Tra@@ is@@ kirchen , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he reported about his first success . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the placing of the 20,000 refugees , who came to Austria on Monday , was without great confusion , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Con@@ rad and praised the organisational &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; master@@ y &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Ministry of the Interior , on the other hand , spoke of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; crisis @-@ like situation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in total , Konrad accounts for a demand of 8@@ 5,000 Qu@@ arti@@ s in the he@@ ur@@ ly year .
in order to meet the number , 35,@@ 000 accommodation must still be found in the next few weeks - 20,000 the countries should provide 15,@@ 000 of the federal government .
if there are more refugees , we can do it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but there is no barrel without ground , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Konrad . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he has already held talks with the country@@ men .
they would have secured him to create lod@@ g@@ ings for the refugees to come .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Upper Austria it is good , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ferry Mai@@ er . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the former VP @-@ Mand@@ atar supports Konrad .
tomorrow , there will be a meeting with Car@@ dinal Christoph Schön@@ born , to clarify how the Church will help .
&quot; &quot; &quot; great expectations put the asylum coordin@@ ator into the OR@@ F action &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hel@@ fen wie wir &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the platform , private individuals can offer un@@ complicated accommodations .
in addition , one hopes for hotels that are empty in the winter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; yesterday Konrad and Mai@@ er critic@@ ised the standards for accommodation as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very high &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in times of emergency , it cannot be that lod@@ g@@ ings must have a certain height of the towel holders or the size of the tor@@ rent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for a temporary time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; emergency standards &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would have to apply . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in contrast to the Ministry of the Interior , that he is more successful in placing housing , Konrad with his experience .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am an elderly gentle@@ man , whom one does not say the truth without further . &quot; &quot; &quot;
persu@@ asi@@ ve power is his most important weapon .
Con@@ rad and Mai@@ er do not cause the republic costs as they explained themselves .
their number of employees want to increase them to three to four .
until now , the search for lod@@ g@@ ings has not been successful .
Konrad wanted to place a container on the Steph@@ an@@ splatz as an office .
but there are obviously problems with the permission .
Linz requires a better distribution
first no opening of municipal sports halls and other buildings such as Tips @-@ Arena and Design Centre for housing refugees is planning the city of Linz .
this is not necessary at the moment , as one can presently supp@@ ress those affected without these measures , says Mayor Klaus Lu@@ ger ( SP ) .
for emer@@ gen@@ cies , however , further locations should be checked for their suit@@ ability .
critic@@ isms of the city chief on the allocation of refugees within the federal state .
other districts have to contribute to this .
Seeh@@ of@@ er : &quot; boundaries are not sealed &quot;
in a longer telephone conversation with the Bavarian prime minister Horst Seeh@@ of@@ er ( CS@@ U ) , the Gover@@ nor Josef P@@ ühr@@ inger ( VP ) on Monday cor@@ ded the further procedure in the refugee problem .
Seeh@@ of@@ er has assured me that the German borders are not sealed off .
the return of refugees to the Federal Republic of Germany is still possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , there are now the corresponding border controls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
special trains with refugees to Germany will not give it any more .
however , the search @-@ seek@@ ers would be brought to Germany with regular trains .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from other EU member states , P@@ ühr@@ inger once again called for greater solidarity in the refugee issue . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; that now also Austria carries out controls on its borders , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a logical consequence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a logical consequence for P@@ ühr@@ inger &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the action of the Germans . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the next Run@@ t@@ astic is a matter of time
&quot; &quot; &quot; the general san@@ itation of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; New wer@@ ft &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the Lin@@ zer industrial line is officially completed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in four of the six floors of the office and production building , the listed IT group S &amp; T is moved , the rest ( 2700 square meters ) is to be rented to young , innovative companies from the technology sector .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in IT the smart heads are our raw material - and we must try to work for us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says S &amp; T boss Hannes Nieder@@ haus@@ er . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he could imagine investing in startup companies of the New Wer@@ ft and later to acquire them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; from the very beginning S &amp; T wants to cooperate with the new neighbours - of which Nieder@@ haus@@ er promises a lot : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the next Run@@ t@@ astic is just a matter of time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Euro 1.7 million were invested in the location of S &amp; T , 3.3 million euros from Tech@@ Center , one third of the city of Linz , the Land of Upper Austria and the Federation ( FF@@ G ) .
the building is le@@ ased by the Linz AG for 60 years at S &amp; T and Tech@@ Center .
30 percent of the 2700 square meters remaining area in the building are already rented , for another 40 percent there are requests .
Li@@ a @-@ Per@@ oni @-@ In@@ hab@@ erin The second business in the arc@@ ade
the new shop focuses on the Fur@@ la hand@@ bags .
in fact , Jutta Bre@@ it wanted to get a dog .
this project had to push the 49 @-@ year @-@ old propriet@@ or of Li@@ a Per@@ oni in the Tau@@ ben@@ markt @-@ Ark@@ ade : after all , she has now acquired increase in the form of another business location .
in the Fur@@ la Shop , compared to the business in which they sell bags , suit@@ cases , shoes and clothing from different manufacturers , all about Dam@@ en@@ hand@@ bags of the brand Fur@@ la , wall@@ ets are starting at 75 euros .
larger bags and accessories can cost up to 500 Euros .
the new shop has been in operation since yesterday .
previously it was rebuilt several weeks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I have long thought about whether I want to open a shop , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Bre@@ it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
decisive for the decision was , among other things , that also the Fur@@ la producers who are at home in Bologna , from the idea of an own location where only their hand@@ bags were sold .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are the only ones in the greater Linz , who sell this brand , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the mother of two daughters who even have Italian roots . &quot; &quot; &quot;
their fashion interest has given Bre@@ it from her mother to the cr@@ adle .
I de@@ fle@@ ct the most when something develops and I can show new trends at affordable prices .
why so many woman in sight of a beautiful hand@@ bag in rap@@ ture is also unable to answer the professional woman with last security .
maybe it is because a beautiful bag is enhanced by every out@@ fit .
the custom @-@ jes@@ macher from K@@ all@@ stadt
the Pf@@ äl@@ zer ancestors of Donald Tr@@ ump came from a place whose inhabitants are called &quot; am@@ ers . &quot;
this property also connects some with the bil@@ li@@ on@@ aire who wants to become the US president .
Donald Tr@@ ump ( 69 ) is always good for excitement .
whether he expresses himself x@@ en@@ opho@@ bic , re@@ viewing journalists or reve@@ aling knowledge g@@ aps in the international crisis policy - the candidate for the U.S. presidential office bu@@ sts the election campaign vig@@ or@@ ously .
and cuts off well .
this is also registered in the pf@@ äl@@ z@@ ischen K@@ all@@ stadt , where the grand@@ parents of the real estate bil@@ li@@ ard origin@@ ate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the New Yorker with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; F@@ oster fr@@ is@@ ur &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a term for many in Win@@ zer@@ dorf on the wine road . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some in the 1200 inhabitants @-@ place is about -@@ zig corners with it is related .
his grand@@ father came from K@@ all@@ stadt in the Pal@@ at@@ in@@ ate : Donald Tr@@ ump , here in Wahl@@ kamp@@ f@@ modus .
the K@@ all@@ städ@@ t Simone Wen@@ del turned a film about Tr@@ ump .
and what do the vill@@ agers think about being the most powerful man in the world ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think they find it exciting , but they are not so deeply impressed in their K@@ all@@ stad@@ ter way , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Simone Wen@@ del . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the native K@@ all@@ städ@@ ter has fil@@ med an am@@ using documentary about the place and its famous sho@@ ots , to which besides Tr@@ ump the Ket@@ ch@@ up @-@ family Heinz is counting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Tr@@ ump , who is not known for mo@@ dest@@ y , comes in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kings of K@@ all@@ stadt &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( 2014 ) too , so with the statement that he would certainly be successful if he would live in K@@ all@@ stadt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he did not bring it to the King of the Hear@@ ts there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there is respect for the performance of the family , but also tends to think that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tr@@ ump &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a bit a big mouth , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Wen@@ del . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; acci@@ dentally , the nick@@ name , which K@@ all@@ stadt had within the circle , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Br@@ ull@@ jes@@ macher &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - to High German : the legisl@@ ature , says it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tr@@ ump comes from the village of the am@@ us@@ ement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Tr@@ ump &apos;s success story began in 1885 when the later grand@@ father emig@@ rated and opened a restaurant for gold dig@@ gers in the USA .
the foundation stone of the real estate group were first land acquis@@ itions in New York .
but the life of the grand@@ parents was not free of trag@@ edy : their desire to return to their homeland in the long run failed in the Bavarian state , in which the Pal@@ at@@ in@@ ate belonged to it at that time .
he did not record Tr@@ ump because he was once forbidden without permission , the Director of the Institut für pf@@ äl@@ z@@ ische Geschichte und Volk@@ sk@@ unde , Roland Paul , declared the start of the film .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Tr@@ ump is the grand@@ son of an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; illegal mig@@ rant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this contr@@ asts with the sometimes marked statements of the descendants .
he had repeatedly talked about Mexican immigrants in the US and demanded the construction of a border wall to deter illegal immigrants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; just as the pol@@ lin@@ ter , it is not so sy@@ mp@@ a@@ thetic , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Hans @-@ Joachim B@@ ender , a distant relative r@@ ump ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Grand@@ ma was a born disaster , the Op@@ a was born Heinz &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the win@@ eg@@ ro@@ wer in retirement sees the American more dist@@ anced , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is always so generous . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
does he believe that Tr@@ ump is coming ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can &apos;t imagine this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 72 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he never cared about K@@ all@@ stadt . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the pension econom@@ ist Ver@@ on@@ ika Sch@@ ramm men@@ tions how many K@@ all@@ stad@@ ters thought that a desc@@ endant of the Heinz family did something for the church organ at a visit , which was generally well fu@@ elled .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can &apos;t imagine this by the Donald , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 68 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; they find it better if he does not win the election because &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has such radical views , I don &apos;t know if it is good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; if those who , at the time of his grand@@ father in the United States , had been like he , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he would never have arrived there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; there are more interesting topics than him , &quot; says Win@@ zer@@ to@@ chter Sarah Büh@@ ler .
and as president ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my president is not , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the grapes are ripe , even without the president of Tr@@ ump . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Wend@@ els &apos;s film , for which Tr@@ ump has been inter@@ viewed for a long time , have seen 12 000 young people , also in the USA the interest awak@@ ens .

seven &apos;s Sun@@ rise domin@@ ates the reviews despite attempts of N@@ ine to take over the loss of leadership during the Today Show
Karl Stef@@ ano@@ vic and Lisa Wil@@ k@@ inson hur@@ ried to Can@@ ber@@ ra to report to the loss of the leadership of the Liber@@ als , but there has been no major shifts in the Today &apos;s reviews .
the breakfast show of N@@ ine was broadcast by the Federal Capital , when Mal@@ col@@ m Turn@@ bull managed the overthrow of Tony Ab@@ bot@@ t .
the Riv@@ ale Sun@@ rise , with the moder@@ ators David Koch and Sam@@ an@@ tha Ar@@ my@@ tage , was in London as part of a one @-@ week series of international television broad@@ casts , including Dubai , New York , Ni@@ ag@@ ara Falls and Canc@@ un .
this dis@@ advantage of the resistance seemed to play no role for Australian TV viewers , as Sun@@ rise achieved average of 39@@ 7,@@ 000 spectators at the five capit@@ als , compared to today 33@@ 9.@@ 000 .
today achieved a slight increase in ratings for Monday ( 3@@ 17,@@ 000 ) and last Tuesday ( 28@@ 3,000 ) but its number remained behind the last Thursday ( 34@@ 3,000 ) .
today , over the past few months , today has closed the gap to Sun@@ rise .
in August today , today , today amounted to 3@@ 18,@@ 000 compared to the 33@@ 0,000 of Sun@@ rise .
at the beginning of the year , the distance was between 4@@ 0,000 and 50,000 .
until now in September Sun@@ rise has an average of 34@@ 9,@@ 000 spectators at 3@@ 14,@@ 000 in today .
this is the most interesting thing happening every morning .
the winds of change affect those morning people more than the parliament !
Karl and Lisa are fine , thank you for checking !

the great news for Seven was the impressive debut of 800 words with the former Seri@@ enst@@ ar von Pack@@ ed to the Raf@@ ters Erik Thom@@ son .

the last three agree : Bachelor Sam Wood is the perfect man - but whom will he choose ?
secret revealed ? ...
Lana &apos;s J@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows , Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki probably have unk@@ now@@ ingly apparently , who wins The Bachelor .
the woman , at which Sam Wood finally lands in The Bachelor , was envel@@ op@@ ed in greatest sec@@ rec@@ y .
and none of the three remaining girl will certainly not show if she is the one who received the last rose .
but when we arrived with Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay , S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki and Lana &apos;s Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows a day before coming out of three two , you may acci@@ dentally have given a hint on who will be the winner .
sam Wood keeps his lips sealed until the final on Thursday
all three women have settled in a ly@@ rical way why Wood is the perfect man and thereby called his sense of hum@@ our , amb@@ ition , family values and positive attitude as reasons why they would like to be his partner .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , if the question is asked , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If not you , who should get the last rose ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; their answers could become spo@@ ilt for who won the heart of the Bachel@@ ors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows and Mark@@ os@@ ki called both fast - except themselves - M@@ ack@@ ay as the best partner for Wood .
from the first day , Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and Sam Wood have had a simple relationship with each other .
&quot; from the moment I went into the house and observed ( Sarah &apos;s ) and Sam@@ s energies , I felt that they were quite compatible , and I thought that throughout the show , &quot; said Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows .
&quot; Sarah is standing on the ground with both feet , making it so much fun to be with her , &quot; Mark@@ os@@ ki added .
I have seen them together , and they have the right chemistry .
they feel comfortable and comfortable with each other .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay thinks she and Sam Wood are well suited as a couple .
&quot; &quot; &quot; from her point of view , M@@ ack@@ ay said that the visit to the house last week made her clear that Wood &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; could be one . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as soon as I saw him with my friends and family , I realized that this is obviously not just a game - I am now un@@ conditi@@ onally tuned to him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and when she was asked who Wood would choose if not she , she was pu@@ zz@@ ling .
&quot; I don &apos;t know if I can say that , &quot; she said .
I love the left @-@ overs in the same way - it is a draw between S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana and Lana .
the Bachelor is broad@@ cast@@ ed on 10 : 30 p.m. on Wednesday .

Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne had several options to start his NF@@ L career .
Det@@ ro@@ it and Seattle showed great interest after moving to the United States - and there were many other teams who sent en@@ quiries after his impressive open day of training at the end of last year .
but Hay@@ ne chose the San Francisco 49@@ ers and trainer Jim Tom@@ s@@ ula and it looks like a wise decision .
some trainers would have bann@@ ed Hay@@ ne for the rest of the game to the bank when he lost a short@@ age as he did the Aus@@ sie @-@ rug@@ by le@@ ague table in his first p@@ unt return on Tuesday at the 20 @-@ 3 victory against Minn@@ es@@ ota .
but Tom@@ s@@ ula trusted his husband and gave Hay@@ ne the next opportunity to a p@@ unt return and also to the running game after a violation of Reg@@ gie Bush .
Tom@@ s@@ ula continues to show his true face in the locker room after the game .
instead of gr@@ ind his ro@@ ok@@ ies in front of the rest of the team by the mill , he encouraged them .
Tom@@ s@@ ula also publicly strengthened Hay@@ ne publicly in his press conference after the game .
the 49@@ ers Sport re@@ porter Cam In@@ man reported that Hay@@ ne was also encouraged by special team coordin@@ ator Thomas Mc@@ Gau@@ gh@@ ey who advised him to forget his scrat@@ ched catch and to take care of the next game .
Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne p@@ atz@@ t at a p@@ unt playing in the first match of Minn@@ es@@ ota Vik@@ ings
it was certainly not the start , the Hay@@ ne and his massive Australian followers had hoped for his NF@@ L debut .
Hay@@ ne left the field after the f@@ um@@ ble and later told the Australian Radio Duo Ham@@ ish &amp; Andy on 2@@ Day@@ FM 10@@ 4.1 that he couldn &apos;t imagine any worse start into his NF@@ L career ,
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was a thing that happens now , you just take care of the next game , and that &apos;s it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hay@@ ne . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hay@@ ne compared the Schn@@ itzer with his Orig@@ in debut in 2007 , when a pass at his own in @-@ Go@@ al area led to a tro@@ y for Que@@ ens@@ land .
overall , it was a great experience for the 27 @-@ year @-@ old .

the Free vot@@ ers are calling for the recru@@ itment of 1000 new teachers in Bavaria for the high number of refugees .
party and faction leader Hubert Ai@@ w@@ anger warned at the beginning of the FW @-@ Herbst@@ kl@@ au@@ sur in Groß@@ wall@@ stadt before a serious crisis at Bavarian schools , if there are no new teachers for the many new students : &quot; we need at least 1000 additional teachers to save the schools before collapse , &quot; said Ai@@ w@@ anger .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; otherwise we will get aud@@ its in the Bavarian education system . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the rural re@@ fraction of the free vot@@ ers is in the Frank@@ ish Commun@@ e until Friday .
actually quite different main topics were planned .
but the record number of refugees is now dominated by the free vot@@ er meeting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , the issue of asylum will over@@ lay the clo@@ ister , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ai@@ w@@ anger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
A@@ w@@ anger ur@@ ged the establishment of UN @-@ Prot@@ ected Are@@ as for Refu@@ ge@@ es in Syria , just as it was during the Yugoslavia &apos;s wars in the 1990s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so it is not going further , we have to go to the causes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Independent vot@@ er boss . &quot; &quot; &quot;
rejected asylum seek@@ ers want to post@@ p@@ one the free vot@@ ers as soon as possible .
therefore Ai@@ wh@@ anger demanded more staff for administrative courts responsible for asylum seek@@ ers : &quot; we also need at least 50 new asylum judges , &quot; said Ai@@ w@@ anger .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the FW chief critic@@ ised that several federal states are not consistent : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need uniform standards of federal states . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Bavaria moves away , others don &apos;t move . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need to become more efficient . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the country politics in Groß@@ wall@@ stadt should not fall under the table .
a long @-@ standing endurance tor@@ ch remains the order of the day : the education policy .
for the new school year , K@@ ult@@ us@@ Minister Ludwig Sp@@ a@@ en@@ le ( CS@@ U ) started the pilot attempt &quot; Medium @-@ level plus &quot; at 47 high schools in which an extension of the gymn@@ asi@@ um intermediate level will be tested from three to four years .
but Ai@@ w@@ anger does not go far enough .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the topic G@@ 9 needs to be accelerated , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the FW @-@ boss . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we call for freedom of choice for all gymn@@ asi@@ es who want this . &quot; &quot; &quot;

4 people killed after polic@@ emen shoot rubber bul@@ lets on demonstr@@ ators in Nepal
four people , including a 4 year old boy , were killed in southern Nepal after the police shot rubber sho@@ ots into a crowd that demonstrated against the proposed new constitution , an official said on Wednesday .
the violence broke out on Tuesday evening in the district Rup@@ an@@ deh@@ i , about 175 miles west of the capital Kath@@ mand@@ u .
B@@ ish@@ nu Pr@@ as@@ ad Dh@@ ak@@ al , chief district civil servant , said that more than 1,000 demonstr@@ ators had gathered outside a police station , some of them threw stones and fire bom@@ bs .
Mr Dh@@ ak@@ al said the police put Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as and then poured into the air before returning to Gum@@ mig@@ sk@@ asse .
20 polic@@ emen and five civilians were injured , he said .
it was not immediately clear why the rubber bul@@ bs used , which are known to kill them , but which are traditionally used as less dead@@ ly alternatives , apparently produced such a high rate of death .
the debate was the last in weeks of violent protests in Nepal , where members of the ethnic group of the Mad@@ r@@ hes@@ i say that new provinces being formed within the proposed new constitution would reduce their political influence .
there were also protests in the western Nepal of the ethnic group of the Th@@ arus , who want their own state .
at least 40 people , including 11 police officers , were forced into violent confront@@ ations since the 10th .
August killed when the four major political parties signed an agreement to divide the country into provinces - an important step towards a new constitution , but a very controversi@@ al issue in Nepal , which has been governed centrally for centuries .
the work on a new constitution has been on its way since 2008 , but the legisl@@ ature accelerated the process after the devast@@ ating earthquake that killed thousands of people in April .
the legisl@@ ature has agreed on certain cl@@ auses in the draft constitution in Kath@@ mand@@ u this week , and officials said that the new constitution could enter into force on Sunday .
construction area planned in the city

Em@@ den - The city of Em@@ den wants to market an area of about 4000 square meters in direct vicinity to the Youth Centre Alte Post .
the preparations for this are underway .
it is planned to use the premises for a mixture of trade , commerce and living .

which investor interest is not yet clear .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no contracts have been concluded accordingly either . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the town of Em@@ den had a part of the property , which is located on the Ring@@ straße / corner Great Road , already a few months ago and the building can be torn down .
project H@@ ie@@ ve : details are on the table

monthly was negoti@@ ated behind closed doors , p@@ onder@@ ed , deb@@ ated and drawn .
now there are plans for a new holiday resort at the little sea near Em@@ den on the table .
the prospective , the medium @-@ sized company &quot; System @-@ Bau , &quot; presented its plans for the first time on Monday evening in the City Development Committee of the Em@@ den Council .
originally this point had stood on the non @-@ public part of the agenda .
under pressure from the project cr@@ itic and the F@@ DP faction that war@@ ns the investor and the administration of sec@@ rec@@ y , Ralf Behr@@ ends went to the offensive by the system construction management board : &quot; we have not yet answered all questions , &quot; he said before the coun@@ c@@ ill@@ ors and more than 50 visitors .
but it is good to be able to meet all rum@@ ours now .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some ten to twelve million euros have been involved in the discussion for months . &quot; &quot; &quot;
violent reactions from marine owners who arrived at the meeting drew the pictures and new details to the desired hotel building .
Roberto Schulz , the owner and a board member of the An@@ li@@ eger , Pro H@@ ie@@ ve advoc@@ acy , compl@@ ains : &quot; this is a giant cl@@ ot@@ z that over@@ looks all the other buildings . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he also fears like many other project critics that traffic would greatly increase due to the intended size of the system : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there must be whole bus@@ loads to join that &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Schulz . &quot; &quot; &quot;
what exactly on the good one hect@@ are of the former inn is happening is still open .
there is no operator yet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first we need to have a concl@@ usive concept , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ralf Behr@@ ends . &quot; &quot; &quot;
because this still lack@@ ed the development plans are still variable .

Google launches campaign funding campaign to raise $ 11 million for refugees
Google Inc ( Goo@@ gl . O ) announced a double donation campaign that aims to raise $ 11 million for humanitarian organizations to help thousands of refugees who have rolled over the European nations as they flee from the war torn and im@@ pover@@ ished countries .
Google has an un@@ usually personal approach to the disclosure of the fund call on its blog .
instead of letting a manager make the announcement , Rita Mas@@ oud wrote a Google collabor@@ ator who fled with her family from Kab@@ ul when she was seven years old , about her personal experiences .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our journey included many dark train and bus trips , as well as hunger , thir@@ st , cold and fear , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I was lucky .
but since the refugee and migrants crisis has grown in Europe , many people like my family are des@@ per@@ ately looking for help .
donations go to four non @-@ profit organizations that provide assistance to refugees and migrants : doctors Without Bor@@ ders , International Res@@ cue Committee , Save the Children and UN High Commissioner for Refu@@ ge@@ es .
Google said that the first global funds raised up to a value of 5.5 million on Goo@@ g@@ le.com / rang to $ 11 million .
Europe is faced with its worst refugee crisis since World War II , largely caused by the four @-@ year civil war in Syria , which has exp@@ elled more than 4 million people this year .

weight loss surgery can be helpful for easily over@@ weight di@@ abe@@ tics .
the benefits of weight loss surgery for easily over@@ weight people with type 2 diabetes can last for at least five years after a new study .
it is still too early to say if easily over@@ weight people with diabetes after weight loss surgery live longer than those who receive non @-@ surgical treatments .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mort@@ ality dates need a long time to show something , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Dr. Robin Black@@ stone , an expert in weight loss surgery , who wrote a leading article about the new study in J@@ AMA Sur@@ gery . &quot; &quot; &quot;
weight loss surgery or obes@@ ity surgery , use various methods to reduce the magn@@ itude of the stomach .
they reduce hunger and limit the body &apos;s ability to absorb food .
over the years , obes@@ ity operations have turned out to be efficient for type 2 diabetes , but most of the studies have been performed in people who are disease @-@ ob@@ ese with a Body @-@ Mass Index ( BM@@ I ) of 35 or higher .
BM@@ I , a certain amount of weight in terms of size , is regarded as normal between 18,@@ 5 and 24,@@ 9 .
a BM@@ I of 25 or more indicates that someone is over@@ weight and people with BM@@ I over 30 are considered ob@@ ese .
you can calculate your BM@@ I here : 1.@@ us@@ a.@@ go@@ v / 1@@ D@@ 0@@ Z@@ q@@ D@@ v .
for the new study , the researchers from Tai@@ wan@@ ese Min @-@ Sh@@ eng General Hospital used data that they have collected in a study since 2007 and compare two types of obes@@ ity surgery - gast@@ ric b@@ ypass and gast@@ ric tu@@ b@@ bing - to medical treatments for type 2 diabetes in people who were easily over@@ weight .
the average BM@@ I among those who undergo this operation decreased from 31 to 24,@@ 5 to the end of the fifth year in this study .
meanwhile , the BM@@ I stayed with those who received non @-@ surgical treatment regim@@ ens approximately equally at 29 .
among those who undergo a surgical procedure , 36 % of the diabetes disorder is completely and in 28 % partial .
in the medical @-@ treated group , the diabetes was completely lost only by one percent , and in some cases only about two percent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , the results in the control of blood pressure , tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; bad &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; L@@ DL cholesterol were generally better in the &apos; surgical &apos; group , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the authors found out . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the researchers also monitored the patient blood level of ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c , which reflects the blood glu@@ cose levels over time .
hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c is best kept under 7 percent , write the researchers .
after the operation , the average ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c fell from around 9 percent to around 6 percent .
however , in the medical therapy group , however , it remained stable at around 8 percent .
but this better &quot; gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control &quot; - as reflected in the improved hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c level - did not dimin@@ ish mort@@ ality in five years , such as the leading researcher Dr. Chi@@ h @-@ Ch@@ eng H@@ su and his colleagues .
the research team also compar@@ es average results in the two types of surgery .
in the fifth year , the b@@ ypass surgery group lost more weight compared to the Gast@@ re@@ kt@@ om@@ ie Group ( 18,@@ 7 vs. 14,@@ 2 kg ) , achieved greater decl@@ ines in BM@@ I ( 7.4 vs. 5.1 ) and hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c ( 3.1 % vs. 2.1 % ) and recorded a complete over@@ coming of the diabetes ( 46.@@ 9 % vs. 16,@@ 7 % ) .
while the new study does not show survival benefit of the surgery after five years , there are evidence from a study of he@@ avier people in Sweden that operation leads to a longer life , says Black@@ stone from the University of Arizona , College of Medicine Phoenix .
in the Swedish study it was for ob@@ ese people who undergo an obes@@ ity operation , about 29 percent less likely to die over the course of 15 years - compared to a group trying conventional methods .
although the new study showed no advantage for survival in the surgery patients , Black@@ stone said it was so@@ o@@ thing for persons with a BM@@ I under 35 , who are interested in the procedure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the critical point of this study because it says that this operation is lower in this lower BM@@ I group , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; without increased risk of death or kidney disease , she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Black@@ stone added that people and their doctors should start taking weight seriously once the patient is with his BM@@ I between 27 and 30 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we wait too long until we get people to take this seriously , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I think that once they have accumulated these genetic changes that have soli@@ di@@ fied their bodies with obes@@ ity and diabetes , a revers@@ al is really difficult . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
love story plays in the H@@ uns@@ r@@ ück
it is an issue that is increasingly attrac@@ ting attention in Bell@@ et@@ rist@@ ik : a young woman , un@@ popular at school times and un@@ si@@ ghtly , meets the flock of her youth after years , and he falls in love with her .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so also in the recently published novel &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ac@@ tu@@ ally we are not so &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by Lu@@ isa Bin@@ der . &quot; &quot; &quot;
beyond the love story , the novel might be interesting especially for H@@ uns@@ r@@ ück readers , because he plays in Lang@@ weiler and the surrounding villages .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is impossible that anyone can come to Europe &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - Dalai Lama - RT @-@ News &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Europe cannot absorb all the refugees , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Dalai Lama and added that the real solution to the refugee crisis in the Middle East . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tibetan Buddh@@ ist leaders ur@@ ged to stop violence in the home countries of the refugees .
the Dalai Lama spoke about the problem of the ongoing refugee crisis at the beginning of his ten @-@ day visit to the United Kingdom in his speech on the occasion of the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Comp@@ assion in Oxford , devoted to ethics studies .
he demanded that under the given circumstances , the interests of humanity should be put before the interests of the individual nations or even continents .
he also stressed that the reaction of Western European countries to the refugee crisis is ad@@ mi@@ red , but the situation is not appropriate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is impossible that anyone can come to Europe , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in his speech . &quot; &quot; &quot;
despite the Dalai Lama in Germany and Austria &apos;s efforts to tackle the crisis , he stressed that it was just a temporary solution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to take care of several thousand refugees is wonderful , but in the meantime , you need to think about long @-@ term solutions , such as real peace and genuine development , mainly through education , for these Muslim countries &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he stressed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the end , we need to think about how the killing is dimin@@ ished in their countries .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need to reduce the use of violence . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the use of violence has never solved these problems , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Dalai Lama spoke to the problem of violence and commented George Bush &apos;s action after the terrorist attack of September 11 , and stated that the US &apos;s violent response was a chain of un@@ controll@@ able events .
after September 11 , I expressed my con@@ dol@@ ences in a letter to President Bush , and I told him the way to resolve this issue lies in non@@ violence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know his motives were good , but he used violence , and that caused unexpected consequences , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Dalai Lama . &quot; &quot; &quot;
four@@ fold increase of dis@@ infection of hands dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ant by children over the last 4 years
po@@ ison control centres in the US report about an almost 400 percent increase in the number of children under 12 years , which swal@@ low strong alcoholic dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants , such as Georgia &apos;s Po@@ ison Center .
according to Dr. Gay@@ lord Lop@@ ez , Director of Georgia Po@@ ison Center , the cases of income from hand dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants rose in children under 12 years , reporting the po@@ ison control centres , from 3,@@ 266 in 2010 to 16,@@ 117 in 2014 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; children are increasingly coming to these products , and unfortunately a percentage of them go in emergency room , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lop@@ ez CN@@ N . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he said that some children dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants det@@ ach inten@@ tionally while some do it to im@@ press their friends or because of a mut@@ ation among social media .
videos on YouTube show how young dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants drink only because of a cheap experience .
yo@@ ung@@ sters have supp@@ os@@ edly mixed dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ant with alcohol @-@ containing mou@@ th@@ wash to get a harder drink .
younger children can be attracted by attractive sc@@ ents of dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants .
&quot; a child does not think that this is bad for it , &quot; Lop@@ ez said .
many of the most attractive ( hand dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants ) are the ones that are perf@@ um@@ ed .
there are dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants with stra@@ w@@ berry , grape and orange scent that are very attractive for children .
hands dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ant contain somewhere between 45 and 95 percent alcohol .
especially in small children , a few sp@@ las@@ hes can lead to alcohol in@@ tox@@ ic@@ ation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is highly concentrated alcohol , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; told Dr. Stephen Thor@@ n@@ ton , medical director of the emergency call center at the University of Kan@@ sas , the Fox 4 in kan@@ sa City . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so you wouldn &apos;t put a si@@ p of whis@@ ky around , but people leave this hand dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ant in reach of children , and when children come to it , then it &apos;s a quick way to consume lots of alcohol .
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah Rus@@ sell , a six @-@ year @-@ old girl who recently took four sy@@ ring@@ es of stra@@ w@@ berry du@@ f@@ ten@@ dem hands dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ant in school , was put into an emergency room for treatment .
her blood alcohol concentration was 179 , twice higher than the threshold , which is considered dr@@ unk by an adult , said Dr. Chris Rit@@ ch@@ ey , an emergency doctor who treated her at the clinic medical center outside Atlanta .
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah ble@@ w her words and was not able to go when she arrived in the emergency room .
doctors monitored them overnight in a separate children &apos;s hospital at the sign of brain trau@@ ma , as the girl had fallen by the alcohol and pushed the head , Rit@@ ch@@ ey said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was very fri@@ ghtening , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Or@@ toria Scott , N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah@@ s &apos;s mother , CN@@ N . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it could have been fatal for my child .
Lop@@ ez has recommended parents and teachers to use alcoholic products or dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants and store dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants outside of the reach of the child .
over alcohol in@@ tox@@ ic@@ ation , some dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants were associated with deaths .
in 2013 , two women died in Ontario women after the swal@@ lowing of dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants that contained a toxic , un@@ declared ingredient .
employees of health authorities susp@@ ect that the product contained meth@@ anol , a dead@@ ly solution , rather than eth@@ yl alcohol , which was listed as active ingredient .
in January , three students of the fourth grade in the State of New York planned to po@@ ison their &quot; common &quot; teacher by putting anti@@ bacterial products around the classroom , &quot; says a police report .
the teacher is highly allergic to dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ant dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants and hi@@ des them from their room .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the police regarded the failed plan as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; s@@ add@@ ling &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and referred to disciplinary measures to the school authority . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Vill@@ ingen @-@ Schwen@@ n@@ ingen : three vehicles damaged

rum@@ or sm@@ ells : no di@@ shar@@ mon@@ y at Celtic
Griff@@ i@@ ths is playing the talk of di@@ shar@@ mon@@ y at Celtic Glas@@ go@@ w , Dei@@ la adm@@ its that the Ho@@ ops are on a bad place , but that he will turn it again .
HE@@ AR@@ TS will fight S@@ FA due to the exc@@ use of N@@ eil@@ son and war@@ bur@@ ton must be c@@ auti@@ ous in January new commitments which could destroy the unity of the Ka@@ ders
D@@ ons increase guidance via Celtic to five points
Adam Ro@@ on@@ ey &apos;s el@@ m in the first half gave Aber@@ de@@ en a scar@@ ce win over Hamilton in Pit@@ to@@ dri@@ e , so that the D@@ ons create a five @-@ point gap between himself and Celtic .
Griff@@ i@@ ths playing talk about D@@ ish@@ ar@@ mon@@ ie down
rum@@ ours about D@@ ish@@ ar@@ mon@@ ie with Celtic Glas@@ go@@ w , which was rejected by Griff@@ i@@ ths spont@@ ane@@ ously , insist@@ ed that he and his team mates are not under elevated control as they prepare for confront@@ ation with the Dutch Tab@@ ellen@@ leader .
I don &apos;t think we feel pressu@@ red , I think players are looking forward to it .
the lack of title competition in Scot@@ t@@ ish soccer bo@@ red Dutch - de Bo@@ er
the former Rang@@ ers @-@ mid@@ fiel@@ der and former national player of the Netherlands Ronal@@ d de Bo@@ er said that Dutch football fans have lost interest in Celtic because there is no title ri@@ val@@ ry with the Rang@@ ers .
de Bo@@ er , currently an ambassador for Aj@@ ax , said : &quot; in Holland they do not show highlights of the Celtic games anymore and why ? &quot;
it is because the Rang@@ ers are not there .
people here talk not only about the return of the Rang@@ ers .
they talk about the Old Firm .
they talk about both teams and that &apos;s what they are interested in .
there is a lot of tension in the Old @-@ Firm games , and there are not only the people in Scotland who want to see these games .
I will turn things around , swe@@ ars Dei@@ la .
R@@ onn@@ y Dei@@ la has accepted that Celtic has to fight , but the Norwegian boss s@@ wor@@ e to turn things around .
after the defeat against Malm@@ ö and the subsequent departure from the Champions League the defeat against 10 @-@ man from Aber@@ de@@ en , which is now with five points lead clearly at the top of the table .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Dei@@ la said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Celtic had bad times before , and we will come back . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
now we want to come out as soon as possible .
I know it &apos;s very fru@@ str@@ ating and a lot of people are very , very angry or sad about what happens .
we feel this exactly like that - but we have to go on .
we really need the support of Celtic because that makes the player better .
standing together is so important .
war@@ bur@@ ton careful with January @-@ transfers
despite his comments only a few weeks ago , pointing out that he hast@@ ened some January transfers , Rang@@ ers @-@ Boss Mark War@@ bur@@ ton is careful when signing new things and insi@@ sts that he does not want to inter@@ fere with the unity of the I@@ bro@@ x @-@ Ka@@ ders .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the ex @-@ boss of Br@@ ent@@ ford said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the January @-@ Transfer window is very different from the summer window . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the players who come in the summer have this pre @-@ season time to integrate what you &apos;ve seen with our own group in this season .
the team is really good .
sometimes more damage is done by adding unnecessary players to what you really need .
cel@@ tic target person Mich@@ u with retreat
Sw@@ an@@ sea @-@ St@@ ür@@ mer Mich@@ u , with Celtic during the transfer period in conversation , indicated that he could withdraw when his contract exp@@ ires with the sw@@ ans .
the 29 @-@ year @-@ old has been pl@@ agu@@ ed with a n@@ asty k@@ nu@@ ck@@ le for two years and did not manage the departure from Wales this summer .
HE@@ AR@@ TS to S@@ FA @-@ Battle set for N@@ eil@@ sons comments
the Hear@@ ts led 2 : 1 when Pat@@ er@@ son was sent from the field and lost 3 : 2 , but the Red Card of the Def@@ ender was later abol@@ ished - the third Red Card of Coll@@ um that was rev@@ oked in eight months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; N@@ eil@@ son remains what he said and insist@@ ed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have no integrity in question , I have not commented on any performance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Griff@@ i@@ ths Swe@@ ars , Ty@@ ne@@ castle to A@@ void
the imm@@ eas@@ urable Hi@@ bee was assigned after he admitted to have sung a song with offensive texts about ex @-@ Hear@@ ts player Ru@@ di Sk@@ ac@@ el .
the incident occurred in a pub in the area of Ros@@ eb@@ urn from Edinburgh in front of a Edinburgh Der@@ by in Ty@@ ne@@ castle in March 2014 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was a Der@@ by , and it was the heat of the moment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the St@@ ür@@ mer , and added , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It is certain to say that I don &apos;t return to Ty@@ ne@@ castle if it doesn &apos;t play for Celtic Glas@@ go@@ w . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tann@@ adi@@ ce Supervisory Board has confidence in Dun@@ dee @-@ United @-@ Management
Simon Donn@@ el@@ ly insi@@ sts that the board of Dun@@ dee United still has confidence in the management team to turn things - but conf@@ is@@ cated that the decline in the field has to end .
I think Stephen Thom@@ p@@ son has confidence in us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we will bring the boys back to tro@@ t , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Donn@@ el@@ ly said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ Inn@@ es glad to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; win &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; against Hamilton &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Der@@ ek Mc@@ Inn@@ es admitted that his crew of Aber@@ de@@ en des@@ per@@ ately strug@@ gled against Hamilton Ac@@ cies to see a seventh consecutive le@@ ague victory that brought them a le@@ dge of five points ahead of Celtic at the top of the table thanks to Adam Ro@@ on@@ ey El@@ f@@ meters in the first half .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ Inn@@ es said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no team who won everything , in poker games or le@@ agues that have not won games of this sort . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unemployment in Scotland will remain unchanged , while in the UK it is increasing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
unemployment in Scotland remained unchanged at 16@@ 4,000 in the period May to July , while the number of people without work for the UK as a whole rose by 10,000 to 1.@@ 82 million in the same period .
Scotland &apos;s unemployment rate of 5.9 percent was over that of the U@@ Ks of 5.5 percent , as the figures of the Bureau of National Statistics ( ON@@ S ) showed .
in the meantime employment in Scotland fell by 12,@@ 000 for the three months , with the number of employees now at 2,@@ 6@@ 12,@@ 000 .
in the course of the quarter , the employment rate for Scotland fell to 7@@ 4.0 percent - a figure above the UK average of 7@@ 3.5 percent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the State Secretary for Scotland David Mund@@ ell commented on the latest figures and said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government &apos;s long @-@ term plan laid the foundation for a stronger economy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is almost exactly one year ago that Scotland has made the historic decision to remain part of the United Kingdom .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in these 12 months we have experienced further improvements on the Scot@@ t@@ ish labour market with an increase in employment and a decline in unemployment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
dr@@ unk bo@@ ther@@ ed the process
since the security personnel were unable to satisfy the situation , the staff called the police .
only with the use of pepper spray , the officials could take the stor@@ ks into cust@@ ody .
an at@@ emal@@ ex@@ ual test resulted in a 16 @-@ year @-@ old 0.89 Pro@@ mil@@ le .
the adolesc@@ ents were picked up by his mother .
a 28 @-@ year @-@ old had 2.@@ 15 Pro@@ mil@@ le and stayed initially in cust@@ ody .
why I will be a witness to an execution in O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma
somewhat later today , except in a late legal intervention , I will see how a man is brought to death .
if it happens and I hope that it does not happen , I will sit in an audience @-@ gallery in the death chamber at the O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma State Pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary , when Richard Gl@@ ossi@@ p is executed by the po@@ ison sp@@ las@@ hes .
he asked me to be one of the four official witnesses at his death .
the invitation was for the first time in January about his best friend , and although I was sho@@ cked I agreed .
when the day near@@ ed , I began to fear .
so why should I do it ?
I agreed because I thought it would be a good way to tell the whole story about the death penalty .
it would offer a unique perspective .
it is true that journalists are allowed to see exec@@ utions in the US , and there are often more applications available than places to decide who is elected .
O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma has reduced the number of media slots from 12 to five .
who is chosen will be able to observe it emotion@@ less .
I cannot do that .
I will sit next to Richard Gl@@ ossi@@ p &apos;s close friend , with whom I have developed my own relationship over the months with phone calls and a two and a half hours visit .
I like the guy .
we often laugh a lot when we speak .
the prison authorities say that I cannot be a witness and a journalist , so I will not be allowed to take a not@@ ebook and pencil to record what I see .
I just have to try to remember all the details .
a journalist from O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma accused me on Twitter , to give up my im@@ parti@@ ality .
here is the lesson .
tell the history of pris@@ oner how he wants it and you get access .
I will compl@@ ain with her .
she adm@@ its that &quot; it could have been better phr@@ ased , &quot; but she still thinks it &apos;s wrong what I do .
Richard Gl@@ ossi@@ p had problem with some of the things I said and wrote .
he doesn &apos;t tell me what I have to write and I wouldn &apos;t do it even if he would do it .
I told him that he can remove me from his list of witnesses at any time .
but he wants an international re@@ porter to be present to write there .
if he dies , he thinks that the public relations work will help the movement against the death penalty .
Kim Bell@@ ware , a representative of the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post , will sit next to me .
if you want to know more about the case , please listen to the series of pod@@ casts that I have made .
I don &apos;t want to go down here again .
I cannot say with certainty that Richard Gl@@ ossi@@ p is innocent .
his actions after the assass@@ ination of Bar@@ ry Van Tre@@ ese would be guilty of being a benef@@ ici@@ ary of action .
but I believe that there is a strong probability that he is not guilty of murder .
I &apos;m sure there is not enough evidence to justify a death sentence .
I think its execution is wrong .
and from this perspective I will see him dying .
I cannot claim to be really objective .
there will be other re@@ por@@ ters to whom you can contact .
what you will get from me is what it means to see a man die of unnecessary death .
man after dam@@ p police ch@@ ase persu@@ aded to come out of the Cann@@ ing River
the Cann@@ ing V@@ ale eman remained dry when he spoke to the man of the Cann@@ ing River .
an attempt by a man of Per@@ th to hang down the police was un@@ successful when he was in shallow and sw@@ amp@@ y water , just a few meters from a police officer who tried to &quot; gently persu@@ ade him to return to the shore . &quot;
the police of Cann@@ ing V@@ ale was launched on Tuesday for a house peace break @-@ up in Pel@@ ham .
when they discovered the susp@@ ect , he tried to escape them towards the Cann@@ ing River .
but he did not come too far .
&quot; he stood in the water and said &apos; I &apos;m not coming out , come and ho@@ l me , &quot; said senior Serge@@ ant S@@ hand@@ ell Cast@@ le@@ dine .
Con@@ stable Lach@@ lan Per@@ ha@@ ve@@ c was not too enthusiastic about making his uniform wet , so he turned away a more reliable tac@@ tic - &quot; A good police officer negoti@@ ates . &quot;
&quot; sometimes people do funny things to try to escape , &quot; said senior Serge@@ ant Cast@@ le@@ dine .
championship football player Ben Cou@@ sins offers an unforgettable example .
in 2006 , cou@@ sins drove his car in the dit@@ ch to escape alcohol control and then tried to swim over the S@@ wan River .
his efforts were un@@ successful , but inspired locals to the hum@@ orous planning of a Ben Cou@@ sins Bi@@ athlon .
Peter Moo@@ dy claims that ste@@ wards tried to sp@@ y him out and threat@@ ens to end the racing sport
Peter Moo@@ dy claims that ste@@ wards from Racing Victoria tried to install a sp@@ y in his st@@ ables last year and threatened to finish the race immediately .
he aimed at the ste@@ wards and the Racing Victoria &apos;s integrity department and claimed that they launched a personal campaign against him with the L@@ ate Scr@@ at@@ ching of Lady Tat@@ ai because of a race day treatment , the last stra@@ w on Wednesday .
Moo@@ dy said Fair@@ fax Media that he always tried to do what was best for racing and he found himself under difficult conditions when it was about the positive cob@@ alt t@@ amp@@ on rehear@@ sal in Li@@ dar@@ is , which he cannot explain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he had kept back 18 months because of the es@@ pi@@ on@@ age repro@@ aches and did not want it to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; look like too high dro@@ op@@ ing grapes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have nothing to say about it , and I have waited for a long time , but sometimes you are so fru@@ str@@ ated that everything comes out at once , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Moo@@ dy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they know that it is expanding .
sometimes you react and you have to live with the consequences , and I have to live with what I said .
ton@@ ight I will go home ton@@ ight and sleep well .
I want to deal with raised main issues and I want my owners to think that I try my best for them .
when they start thinking , I do not do that , then I should not be a trainer .
I have to consider what I do with my license .
before Moo@@ dy had the bom@@ b to go up in an interview with rac@@ ing@@ .com that the Integr@@ ity Department tried to sp@@ y out his stall .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; eighte@@ en months ago Ter@@ ry Bail@@ ey , Day@@ le Brown and Dr. Brian Ste@@ wart were sitting in a room with a man - whom I am called - and offered him an employment in my st@@ ables to provide information on what I do within my st@@ ables , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Moo@@ dy on Rac@@ ing@@ .com . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they seem to believe that I am a fraud .
if that is the case , they should definitely believe in their n@@ oses because they have failed in trying to hold me .
Robert Rou@@ l@@ ston , former CEO of RV@@ L , David Moo@@ die , current CEO of RV@@ L and Bernard Sa@@ undry , current CEO of RV@@ L , were aware of this and are still today .
should this bring me to the point that it becomes personal ?
has the RV@@ L conduct itself and perhaps makes people outside of trainers responsible for what is going on in the industry ?
am I bad for the industry ?
am I so bad for the industry ?
maybe the people out there that I am .
perhaps they have to take my license and viol@@ ate me , and I have no doubt that what I say they are now thinking about it .
but I am now at the point where it doesn &apos;t matter , and that makes me sad .
this makes me really sad .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will ex@@ ert pressure on them and push them to make a decision . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have the support of my family and I can go .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the trainer &apos;s fru@@ stration levels have developed with Li@@ dar@@ i &apos;s long @-@ lasting cob@@ alt @-@ investigation , and the L@@ ate Scr@@ at@@ ching explained that he &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; could throw his license on the table . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Moo@@ dy , best known by his preparation of the un@@ varn@@ ished Master Black Caviar , described the race tags treatment rule &quot; ridi@@ cul@@ ous , &quot; after a pack of mud or clay had been applied to the horse deb@@ ts , which pushed against the rules .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is against the rules of racing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I must take full responsibility for it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of my staff mistakenly put mud on the leg . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it could have been so last night .
it could have been the whole day yesterday , which was so .
but it had also been on the race day .
Moo@@ dy could be confronted with a three @-@ month dis@@ qualification for the treatment with the pack on the race day . an investigation of this matter was opened .
it is a jo@@ ke .
people who set up these rules know nothing about the horse .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we all see that we need rules , but here one has gone too far , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Moo@@ dy . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Cra@@ ig Bell@@ amy propos@@ es against ri@@ vals for alle@@ g@@ ations of ring fighting
Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Cra@@ ig Bell@@ amy has described a cr@@ iti@@ que of the tac@@ kling of its players as &quot; Agenda @-@ Set@@ ting &quot; from two Premier League &apos;s favorites by the N@@ RL .
Sydney Roo@@ sters Trainer Tr@@ ent Robinson said that the Ar@@ bit@@ rators allowed the Storm players &quot; Ring@@ war@@ fs &quot; with his team during the high @-@ storm victory in Sydney on Friday evening .
Bris@@ ban@@ e Bron@@ cos trainer Wayne B@@ enn@@ ett made a sc@@ arc@@ ely conce@@ aled note to the Storm team after his team reached the Final victory against North Que@@ ens@@ land C@@ ow@@ boys on Saturday evening . he called the game a &quot; model example &quot; of the rug@@ by League and said that the two from Que@@ ens@@ land were not &quot; too good &quot; in the rings .
Bell@@ amy def@@ ended the T@@ ack@@ li@@ m of his team and said that they were only focused on their &quot; contact &quot; during the tac@@ kling .
Bell@@ amy added that the criticism of two leading trainers in his team was confident that they were worried that they were worried about being beaten out of the Storm team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that &apos;s up again and again - I haven &apos;t heard that Tr@@ ent Robinson spoke about ring competitions when they struck us 24 : 2 &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Bell@@ amy said on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the last six weeks we have made our contact with Tac@@ kl@@ es a real focus and this has provided us with the trend turn@@ around .
Tr@@ ent has been there for three years and he obviously has a great team to train . he is probably not ac@@ custom@@ ed to losing , so it was a bit a shock for him .
it is funny how this is always appearing at this time of the year .
Bell@@ amy has attacked B@@ enn@@ ett &apos;s idea of &quot; exciting football &quot; and reminds his ment@@ or that B@@ enn@@ etts St George Il@@ la@@ war@@ ra Dragons won the Premier League in 2010 with &quot; boring &quot; football .
Wayne speaks of exciting football .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he compared his game on Saturday evening with our Friday evening and how exciting their game was , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bell@@ amy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I remember that in 2010 St George was critic@@ ised as a te@@ di@@ ous team and Wayne said that he will take care of a divor@@ ce .
but now he has a team that can play and which we watch as exciting , especially his young players at their speed .
this is the ball game you want to play when you have this kind of players .
he made this statement in 2010 , now he wants everyone to play his kind of soccer - not every team has two players like Anthony Mil@@ ford and Ben H@@ unt , so they can play as they play .
I build stronger trust because they say these things because they are a bit worried about playing against us .
six weeks ago they didn &apos;t think of us when it was about the big games .
Bell@@ amy also pointed out that the game Storm against Roo@@ sters achieved a higher result than the game Bron@@ cos against co@@ w@@ boys .
the game of the Bron@@ cos was probably a good game , I haven &apos;t seen it yet , but what was the result ? 16 : 12 ?
our game was 20 : 18 , there were two further attempts in our game , but is this an exciting game ?
or are breaks and do not score a little more exciting ?
for me it is the game plans .
when they mention us , it means that we are going to meet them in one phase .
the Storm @-@ Team is free at this weekend because they have won the right to receive either North Que@@ ens@@ land C@@ ow@@ boys or the C@@ ron@@ ul@@ la Shar@@ ks on the next Saturday evening in the A@@ AMI Park . ticket sales begin next Tuesday morning .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ser@@ bier &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with 200@@ ,000 $ deposit for drug ad@@ diction &quot; &quot; &quot;
a man who possibly threat@@ ens a li@@ fel@@ ong punishment due to his attempt to get into possession of 40 kilo@@ grams of co@@ ca@@ ine sm@@ ug@@ gled to Que@@ ens@@ land was released against a deposit of $ 200@@ ,000 .
Mark@@ o Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c , 29 , was one of the five men who were arrested last month after the Bundes@@ po@@ liz@@ ei found 100 kg of the drug on the Yacht Sol@@ ay , who came from South America via Van@@ u@@ atu and placed in Co@@ om@@ era in August .
Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c was observed , as he met his co @-@ accused at the marina in the morning and later at the Café Co@@ om@@ era Road@@ house , where the police found 40 kilo@@ grams of the drug in a Toyota Echo .
despite a potentially li@@ fel@@ ong penalty for attemp@@ ting to possess a commercial amount of co@@ ca@@ ine , the attor@@ ney of Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c argu@@ ed that he tried to own the whole lot and that in the café could have been out of a harm@@ less reason .
the judge of the Supreme Court , Peter Flan@@ ag@@ an , was concerned about the danger of escape with Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c .
he has clear relations with Serbia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he often travels to Serbia , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said to the court on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in case of a criminal off@@ ence , he lied to the police about his where@@ ab@@ outs .
Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ cs &apos;s mother and st@@ ep@@ father had a deposit of 200@@ ,000 dollars as security in common to reach his release .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after reading the aff@@ id@@ av@@ ous declar@@ ations of the two people it is clear that the circulation of a security of 200@@ ,000 dollars represents a real financial burden , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Richter Flan@@ ag@@ an . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but that alone will not suff@@ ice to prevent him from appearing , he warned .
Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c was released against deposit , under the conditions that he gives off his Australian and Serbian passport , noti@@ fies himself in the police daily and stops at an initial lock from 18 : 00 @-@ 06 : 00 .

St@@ ev@@ an H@@ og@@ g used phone of girls to l@@ ure ped@@ oph@@ ile to send pictures
a ped@@ op@@ hil@@ ator used the phone of a 11 @-@ year @-@ old girl to request images of child abuse .
St@@ ev@@ an H@@ og@@ g took the girl &apos;s phone when he slept , logged into an online mess@@ aging service , from which he received a series of in@@ consistent pictures of children that were sent to him by another user .
the girl later wo@@ ke up and discovered that the phone was missing and found it in the hand of the sleeping h@@ og@@ g .
she saw it through , found the bew@@ il@@ dering news and immediately aler@@ ted her mother .
the police took care of it and saw the five images , then analyzed computers found under the address and discovered &quot; Web searches &quot; that used terms for searching for un@@ decent pictures of children .
&quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ og@@ g then said to the officials that he did it because it would lead to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ped@@ oph@@ ile on the internet &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; and he then &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pret@@ ended to be a polic@@ eman to fri@@ gh@@ ten her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the prosec@@ utor Ei@@ li@@ d@@ h Rober@@ t@@ son told the Dun@@ dee Sh@@ eri@@ ff Court : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said it would be an ad@@ diction - that he is ad@@ dic@@ tive to fri@@ gh@@ ten people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he admitted that the searches on the computer were carried out by him , but said it was done because he wanted to be a polic@@ eman to fri@@ gh@@ ten ped@@ oph@@ ile .
he was asked for his conversations with the unknown person who sent him the pictures and which he asked to send more photos .
he said he did it to l@@ ure her .
he said he was sick in his head when he drinks , and said he wanted to see pictures of rape and murder .
MS Rober@@ t@@ son added : &quot; when the girl found the news on the phone , she called her mother and was at tre@@ mb@@ ling and we@@ eping .
she then saw the un@@ decent pictures on the phone and confronted the accused with it .
the girl was inter@@ viewed and said that the def@@ endant used computer and Play@@ station to talk to girls who looked a lot younger than him .
H@@ og@@ g , 23 , W@@ ard Road , Dun@@ dee , ple@@ aded guilty to the indictment to have un@@ interrupted pictures of children on 14 June last year , to have viol@@ ated the conditions on 25 January of this year and not appear before court at a hearing held on March 24 this year .
advoc@@ ate attor@@ ney Gregor S@@ im asked that H@@ og@@ g was not appearing in the Registry of sexual offen@@ ders , as one could argue that &quot; no significant sexual element &quot; could be found in his trial .
Sh@@ eri@@ ff A@@ list@@ air Car@@ mi@@ ch@@ ael mi@@ xes the verdi@@ ct until October , to receive background reports on social work .
H@@ og@@ g was given a security deposit in this case , but was held in cust@@ ody for hear@@ ings to other still p@@ ending cases .
he was still admitted before the date of judgment into the list of sexual offen@@ ders .
Schle@@ user switches to Germany on small border cross@@ ings
more and more refugees are taken up apart from the major control points at the German @-@ Austrian border .
many floo@@ d@@ gates were caused by fear of discovery and arrest , the people re@@ acted to smaller border cross@@ ings .
on the Austrian side , a spokes@@ man of the Federal Police ( Bundes@@ po@@ liz@@ ei ) said .
since Tuesday more than 1000 refugees have been picked up along the river border river Inn in the districts of Pass@@ au and Rot@@ tal @-@ Inn .
they were on the German side by foot over bridges and shr@@ ubs .
there they are received by Bundes@@ po@@ liz@@ isten and forwar@@ ded to registration .
at the Munich Central Station , following Federal Police figures , more refugees met again on Wednesday at the start of the week .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; alone until 8 am , about 700 people have arrived in the capital capital , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a spokes@@ man in the morning . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the re@@ introduction of controls on the German @-@ Austrian border on Tuesday 17@@ 59 refugees had reached the city .

on Friday the sun can be seen again for a long time .
the mass makes it : every two years the motor@@ ways at the I@@ AA show their novel@@ ties .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 2015 is mainly attri@@ but@@ able to the compact cars that are currently selling very well . &quot; &quot; &quot;
cars from the compact class are currently in demand : around 28.@@ 1 percent of new registrations ac@@ counted for this segment alone in August .
this is also reflected in the I@@ AA ( public stage 17 to 27 September ) .
between all the fut@@ ur@@ istic concept vehicles and new premium and luxury cars , many new compact models will be introduced this year .
one of the biggest pre@@ mier@@ es for the German car industry is the Opel Astra , which will stand by the dealers in the autumn .
&quot; the Astra is an extremely important model for us , &quot; said Opel CEO Karl @-@ Thomas Neumann at the fair .
it belongs to the core of the brand .
so that the volume model is also sold well , the new Astra should not be much more expensive .
Opel represents an entry below the largest competitors VW Golf in view , starting at 17 650 euros .
the current Astra is about 16 990 euro .
the Astra is equipped with a new 1.4 @-@ liter engine with 74 kW / 100 hp .
in addition , the H@@ esse offers additional diesel and gasoline engines from 70 kW / 95 hp to 147 kW / / 200 hp , which include three @-@ cylinder gasoline engines for the first time .
in contrast to the most important competitors VW Golf and Ford Focus , the Opel Astra is initially only five @-@ door .
the second variant will follow in the spring of the Com@@ bi , which is already visible at the I@@ AA .
and what will happen next to the Astra at the I@@ AA in new compact cars ?
Renault Mé@@ gan@@ e : Renault sends the fourth generation of his Astra @-@ competitors Mé@@ gan@@ e into the race .
at the fair , the Mé@@ gan@@ e is exclusively available as a five @-@ door @-@ door in a conventional and a stres@@ ses sporty GT @-@ version .
in the trade it comes in the beginning of next year , then also as a comb@@ i .
Infin@@ iti : brand new in the segment is Infin@@ iti Q@@ 30 .
the Nissan unit wants to find its position in the strongly growing segment with the new model .
the compact Infin@@ iti fits in with its curved lines fully into the design line of the brand .
the basic model will get a gasoline engine with an output of at least 90 kW / 122 HP .
the offer is also a diesel with 80 kW / 109 hp or 125 kW / 170 hp .
Suzuki Bal@@ eno : new in the segment is also the Suzuki Bal@@ eno who celebrates its world premiere in Frankfurt .
the model is offered with gasoline engines , including a newly developed 1.0 @-@ liter tur@@ bo engine and an output of 82 kW / 111 hp .
the maximum torque is according to manufacturer &apos;s declar@@ ations at 170 New@@ ton@@ meters ( Nm ) .
the launch of the Bal@@ eno in Europe is in spring 2016 .
DS 4 : not completely new , but completely renewed is the compact DS 4 compact class that can be seen at the I@@ AA .
outside the designers of the noble Citro@@ ë@@ n @-@ Ab@@ leg@@ ers put a hand on the front part : here , the radiator gr@@ ille was re@@ drawn and the changed head@@ lights with LED technology were equipped .
in the interior , the inf@@ ot@@ ain@@ ment system was moderni@@ zed , reducing the number of buttons by a touch screen and integrated for the first time Ap@@ ples Car@@ Play .
in addition , at the I@@ AA in the compact class , there are a number of re@@ visions and new variants such as the refresh@@ ed Mercedes A @-@ Class or the Peugeot 308 G@@ TI .
J@@ VA Berlin @-@ Te@@ gel : five square metres of cell are deser@@ ted
the Federal Constitutional Court ordered an ex @-@ pris@@ oner of the judicial enforcement agency Te@@ gel , which was lod@@ ged in a small cell for months .
because of the violation of their human dignity , prisoners are entitled to financial compensation if they are accommod@@ ated in too small cells .
this decision was made by the Federal Constitutional Court in a decision issued on Wednesday .
according to the judges , those affected can even hope for money if they were im@@ pris@@ oned only a few days in the confin@@ es of narrow spaces ( A@@ z . : 1 BvR 112@@ 7 / 14 ) .
thus an ex in@@ mate with his constitutional complaint was successful in Karlsruhe : he was placed in a single cell with around five square meters of floor space between June and November 2009 ; the toilet was spati@@ ally not separated .
after that , the man who , according to his lawyer , was now on the open foot , was transferred to a larger cell .
his term of office because of the un@@ worthy conditions of det@@ ention against the country of Berlin failed .
but the Constitutional judges raised the judgment of the Berlin Chamber Court and rejected the case for the re @-@ trial .
they see the man &apos;s dignity hurt .
chamber court decides on the amount of compensation
even if for legal reasons only a few days of prison days are author@@ itative for compensation , there was an equivalent of compensation , it was called .
&quot; &quot; &quot; otherwise , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a cur@@ v@@ ature of the legal protection of the personality would be to fear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Court of App@@ eal must now clarify the amount of money .
in the past , the Constitutional Court has often strengthened the rights of prisoners of law .
so they first said in April a pris@@ oner of damage , because he was locked in a prison in a prison cell .
according to people un@@ worthy , a decision of 2011 is also the multiple assignment of a cell without a separate toilet .
in addition , on Wednesday , Karlsruhe also confirmed the Berlin Constitutional Court , who had agreed on a decent housing for a pris@@ oner in a parallel fall in November 2009 .
the then pl@@ ain@@ ti@@ ff was accommod@@ ated daily between 15 and 21 hours daily in a similar cell like in the Car@@ ls@@ ru@@ her case .
in recent weeks , the Berlin pris@@ ons have also hit the head@@ lines for lack of personnel .
prisoners are therefore always included 23 hours , the aggres@@ si@@ veness increases , even at Schl@@ ä@@ ger@@ eien , it should have arrived because of the ten@@ se situation .
according to information from the Just@@ iz@@ pres@@ se@@ stelle , 21 jobs in Te@@ gel are not st@@ aff@@ ed because of the lack of offspring , 19 should fall away in 2016 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Angela Merkel and the refugee policy : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are creating this &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the immigration of refugees is an enormous challenge - the Chancellor is determined to accept her .
what comes to Germany ?
according to the Federal Interior Ministry , some 800 000 asylum seek@@ ers will come to Germany this year , according to vice @-@ Chancellor Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) , Germany is even able to record a million refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; German Chancellor Angela Merkel ( C@@ DU ) demonstrated determination in the face of the unusual challenge : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I say again and again : &quot; &quot; &quot;
what comes to Germany gives the following overview .
according to different predi@@ ctions between 35@@ 0000 ( estimate of the German Federal Ministry of Economics ) and 400@@ ,000 ( estimate of the Pest@@ el Institute ) dwell@@ ings annually - and for the next five years .
this is almost twice as much as it has been built up to now ( 25@@ 0000 apartments ) .
the lack of living space is dramatic , but especially in affordable rental properties : every year 600@@ 00 to 800@@ 00 social housing falls out of the rental price and in order to apply these particularly favourable apartments , refugees will also apply .
Federal Minister Barbara Hend@@ ri@@ cks ( SPD ) therefore wants to double the funding , from currently 518 million to one billion euros .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; too little is that from the Pest@@ el Institute &apos;s perspective : 80 000 social housing annually would have to arise and therefore the federal government would have to invest in the amount of 6.4 billion per year . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the same time , scientists and Federal construc@@ tors agree that there must also be more tax benefits for investment in residential construction .
according to estimates by the Institute for Employment Research , it is assumed that 55 per cent of the refugees in Germany can be employed in the long term .
however , refugees in Germany would not be asked systematically for their qualification in order to help them get started , critic@@ ised Claudia Walter , project manager for integration and education in the Ber@@ tel@@ smann Foundation .
but for the integration of refugees it is crucial whether they find jobs in Germany .
work is the key to social contacts , for the appreciation in the recording company , but also for the self @-@ este@@ em of migrants , says Mig@@ r@@ ations@@ for@@ scher Dietrich Thr@@ än@@ hardt .
according to Thr@@ ust@@ hardt , there has been a political change in Germany : from the prohibition of labour for refugees to the recognition of labour .
while there was previously a ban on asylum seek@@ ers of up to five years , this was reduced to three months in November 2014 , just as the Residen@@ z@@ pf@@ licht , the asylum seek@@ ers limited to a place of residence .
the situation in society has - also because of the short@@ age of skilled labour - has prev@@ ailed in a majority of ways that refugees should be allowed to access the labour market more quickly .
a large barrier for access to the labour market is a lack of German knowledge .
until now there is no sufficient supply of general and professional language courses .
research also shows that jobs most often are medi@@ ated by personal contact .
therefore , the creation of networks is , according to the opinion of Thr@@ än@@ hardt der Königs@@ weg on the integration of labour .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the school administration has found that only a few refugees give their children to Kit@@ as , estimated 10 to 15 percent : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important to keep the family together , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Il@@ ja Ko@@ schem@@ bar , spokes@@ person for youth and family in the Berlin Senate administration . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in order to convince the family of the advantages of the K@@ ita , the administration gives hand@@ outs in different languages .
if the demand for educ@@ ators increase strongly due to the large number of refugees , the Berlin Senate would try to increase training capacities - for instance by allowing more specialist schools .
in the countries students are prepared for lessons without knowledge of German in welcome classes .
but they are not always taught by fully trained teachers , but as in Berlin , also by teachers who only have a qualification in German as a second language .
there is no short@@ age of them , says Be@@ ate &apos;s offers from the Berlin School of School .
the German student movement estimates that about 20 percent of the refugees in Germany want to study .
in principle no Bundes@@ land says asylum seek@@ ers or toler@@ ate the study - the only exception so far was Berlin , the internal sen@@ ator Frank H@@ enkel ( C@@ DU ) has now abandoned his position .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; studying refugees could be facilit@@ ated by admission to the university . &quot; &quot; &quot;
because refugees with a residence permit or cancellation do not receive any services according to the asylum seek@@ ers &apos; law more if they begin a study .
the latter generally do not get a B@@ af@@ ö@@ g , since they do not fall under the circle of persons who are eligible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pati@@ ently refugees had to have lived in Germany for four years to be entitled B@@ af@@ ö@@ g to be entitled , from 1 January 2016 , this span will be short@@ ened to 15 months . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but this financing gap must be closed , Steffen Kra@@ ch , Berlin &apos;s State Secretary for Science , and the German Student Union .
students should immediately get B@@ af@@ ö@@ g .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Islam will play an important role in the future , as many refugees are Muslims , and for many , religion is an important part of their identity . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the state should succ@@ essi@@ vely set up the same rights to Islam as they have the churches , and to develop the existing state @-@ of @-@ church law to a new state of religion .
the establishment of an Islamic community of welfare would also be important , taking care of the new arri@@ vals in a professional manner .
duties are also part of the rights .
in this way , the representatives of Islam must agree on clear contact persons and be prepared to work with the state in many areas and to give him certain control possibilities .
in addition , the willingness to host religious fundament@@ alism is also part of this .
the Chairman of the Central Council of Muslims , A@@ im@@ an Maz@@ ye@@ k , expressed concern on Thursday that religious conflicts could also be entered into Germany .
those who wanted to exit such conflicts in Germany &quot; immediately have their right to stay here , in Germany , &quot; he said in Bay@@ er@@ ischer Rundfunk .
he proposed to translate the Basic Law in Arabic .
integration will in future be much more than today a theme of the whole society .
this will also need to change the majority society , the reduction of discrimination and rac@@ ism becomes more urgent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Germany has - as a result of European decisions - since the last decade an anti @-@ discrimination agency and a general equality law . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it lear@@ ns very slowly how the NS@@ U @-@ series showed , in the police and authorities the rac@@ ist motive was systematically ignored .
equal opportunities for all : what mig@@ rant organizations and the stakeholders of non @-@ white German have long demanded and what international agreements like the Anti @-@ r@@ acial Convention in Germany commit , must become reality in the coming years if the country remains peaceful and its new citizens should use their possibilities - for the benefit of all .
in general , Germany is able to provide medical care to the previously expected refugees , says Dr. Frank Ulrich Mont@@ gom@@ ery .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as for MAN@@ - Power and capacities , we create that , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said to the Tages@@ spiegel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , additional money must flow into the system .
to avoid bott@@ len@@ ecks , Mont@@ gom@@ ery requests to susp@@ end all arri@@ vals immediately during the registration of health cards .
services rendered could subsequently be cred@@ ited with the federal states .
and in the long term , it is highly question@@ able , as many people use the limited power catalog to see the asylum seek@@ ers act .
otherwise , the doctors mainly make the language barriers possible .
as far as before , the Berlin health schol@@ ar The@@ a Bor@@ de has demonstrated that migrants are worse than their diseases than other patients .
not only in clinics , even in medical practices , interpre@@ ting costs would have to be taken over , it demands .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , many refugees have been helped with more general medical centres in emergency ambul@@ ances . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and with another diagnostic view .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; among refugee children , there are clearly more un@@ traff@@ ick@@ ed disabilities , and among young people it is about HIV education . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with the partially other disease pictures , German doctors came from their training but clear , says Mont@@ gom@@ ery .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; paras@@ ite in@@ fest@@ ation or tu@@ ber@@ cu@@ lo@@ sis are not so difficult to recognize . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and as for the health angel , perhaps even relief in sight of the refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Syri@@ ans would have had a highly developed education system , several refugees even have doctors .
in order to be able to prac@@ tise , however , they would have to prove their qualifications and submit again ex@@ ams .
at least half of the refugees coming in Germany are psych@@ ically ill according to estimates by the Federal GO@@ D Psycho@@ therap@@ ist ( B@@ P@@ t@@ K ) : most suffer from a post trau@@ matic stress disorder or depression .
refugee children are particularly vulnerable , says Dietrich Mun@@ z , President of the B@@ P@@ t@@ K .
a recently published study by TU Munich proves that every fifth Syrian refugee node is traum@@ ati@@ zed in Germany .
those who suffer from a post trau@@ matic stress disorder suff@@ ers from so @-@ called flash@@ backs with breath , di@@ zz@@ iness , heart rate and death .
other symptoms include sleep and concentration distur@@ ban@@ ces , strong anxi@@ ousness and emotional num@@ b@@ ness .
to prevent the symptoms being chronic , an early treatment is necessary , declared am@@ mun@@ ition .
up to now , however , only four percent of the psych@@ ologically ill refugees get a psycho@@ therapy .
ad@@ mitt@@ edly , psych@@ ologically ill seek@@ ers can submit a motion for psycho@@ therapy in the social offices , but the processing usually takes several months .
in addition , in the social offices , mostly non @-@ workers or doctors , who are not trained for mental illnesses , decide whether a therapy is necessary or not .
this often leads to mis@@ calculations , says Mun@@ z .
Man@@ ege invites you to dream
with the new production &quot; Passion , &quot; Cir@@ cus Pro@@ bst looks back on the traditions of cir@@ cus arts .
the goal is to attract each age group into the spell of fascinating ac@@ rob@@ atics , animal dres@@ sings and unique entertainment .
now the Cir@@ cus Pro@@ bst inv@@ ests in the arena on the brick producing v@@ ases to dream .
&quot; our passion is cir@@ cus . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can &apos;t imagine living without my family , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Steph@@ anie Pro@@ bst , animal teacher and junior program . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; passion &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - under this motto is the current stage of the Man@@ e@@ gen@@ stages . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the cir@@ cus has been in the hands of the Pro@@ bst family for more than 33 years .
the gift to the service , therefore , is the family in the blood .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important for us to get people away from their everyday life and take them into a completely different world for two hours , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; empha@@ sizes the 27 @-@ year @-@ old juni@@ or@@ ch@@ ef@@ in . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Man@@ e@@ gen@@ cocktail with world city flair &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; so Director Reinhard Pro@@ bst call his concept . &quot; &quot; &quot;
50 cities on the almost 3 000 km long tour can now experience this flair .
the cir@@ cus programme impres@@ ses with talented artists from all over the world .
awarded at the international cir@@ cus festival in Monte Carlo , the Russian Sto@@ li@@ ar@@ ov Clo@@ wn Family draws the audience with w@@ it and charm in their spell .
the Castillo Brothers also understand their craft .
with the heroes of the silent movies , the Cub@@ an duo will easily pick up .
light@@ ness and ag@@ ility - with these words they identify themselves .
her hum@@ orous art on the mast shall conquer women &apos;s hearts in the storm .
except through numerous sal@@ mon sal@@ v@@ ae the ac@@ rob@@ atics of Cir@@ cus Pro@@ bst too fascin@@ ates with finger@@ spitz@@ en@@ gefühl and swi@@ vel .

&quot; the animals belong to our family , &quot; emphas@@ ises Steph@@ an@@ ies mother , Brigitte Pro@@ bst .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gri@@ ev@@ ances in the attitude of cir@@ cus animals are only too often subject to various animal welfare organizations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Steph@@ anie Pro@@ bst also takes a position : &quot; if our animals are not good , we are not doing well . &quot;
approximately 80 animals from five different continents enjoy each pet@@ ting unit .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; four @-@ leg@@ ged artists &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as they are lov@@ ingly called will be read by the eyes every wish . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we want to work with the animals and have fun with them .
if the animal does not feel comfortable , it does not want to be in the arena .
the highest bid is : good for the animals .
especially on her zeb@@ ro@@ id jum@@ bo , a blend of a Sh@@ et@@ land Pon@@ y@@ h@@ eng@@ st and a zeb@@ ra mare , the Pro@@ bst family is proud .
the two animals lived in one enclosure for eight years and nothing happened .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but then suddenly , our little jum@@ bo was there , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Brigitte Pro@@ bst . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the zeb@@ ro@@ id is not yet ready for the arena , but it is the unique mas@@ cot of Cir@@ cus Pro@@ bst .
there should be something for every visitor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one thing is sure , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Steph@@ anie Pro@@ bst : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no matter if five or 1 200 viewers , we always give our best and are with all our hearts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Cir@@ cus Pro@@ bst inv@@ ests from 17 to 20 September every day at 5 p.m. and 8 p.m. to his performances .

Zimbabwe Robert Mug@@ abe leads wrong speech in parliament
Mr Mug@@ abe , Africa &apos;s el@@ dest leader , desc@@ ended from a podium to the beginning of the year .
he remained un@@ har@@ med , but the video of the fall quickly spread over the social media .
the Parliament &apos;s opening was also clou@@ ded by the opposition members of the opposition that they had received anonymous death threats and were warned of accompanying the speech given by Mr Mug@@ abe .
in the past month , they had booked him and interrupted him during his speech in the State of the Nation in parliament - this is the speech he repeated on Tuesday .
the spokes@@ man of the Movement for Democratic Change ( Movement for Democratic Change - M@@ DC ) In@@ no@@ cent Gon@@ ese said that seven opposition politicians received SMS messages on their phones they warned of interfer@@ ing with Mr. Mug@@ abe &apos;s speech .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the news comes from a number that is not shown , but it has the title &apos; death &apos; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said journalists to Mug@@ abe &apos;s speech . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it war@@ ns the members of Parliament that the imm@@ unity in parliament ends , and as soon as they leave the Parliament , their parliamentary imm@@ unity is no longer effective . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the chief speaker said that the party led by Morgan T@@ sv@@ ang@@ ir@@ ai was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concerned &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; about the dangers for politicians . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hewlett @-@ Packard will build up to 30,000 jobs
Hewlett @-@ Packard is expected to expand 25,@@ 000 to 30,000 jobs during re@@ struc@@ tur@@ ings and savings efforts in the company &apos;s services .
HP will later split into two listed companies this year and separate the computer and printer business from its fast @-@ growing enterprise hardware and service business activities .
the expected job reduction will result in a burden of over 2.7 billion dollars from the fourth quarter , HP said in an explanation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these restructuring measures will enable a more competitive , more sustainable cost structure for the new Hewlett @-@ Packard Enterprise , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Me@@ g Whit@@ man , HP @-@ Chairman and Chief Executive , who is to lead the unit after separation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be smaller and stronger than HP is today and we have a broad and deep@@ ened portfolio of businesses that help companies transition to a new style of business , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Whit@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as a stand@@ alone company , we are better positioned than ever to satisfy the changing needs of our customers all over the world .
Hewlett Packard Enterprise has annual revenues of more than $ 50 billion and will be focused on delivering un@@ att@@ ain@@ able , integrated technology solutions for businesses , &quot; explains the company &apos;s statement .
it divi@@ des a company that was founded by the graduates from Stan@@ ford University Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard in the 19@@ 30s to manufacture electrical systems and whose Pal@@ o Alto Garage you have called &quot; the birth@@ place of Si@@ licon Valley . &quot;
HP has a massive restructuring to handle the turn from traditional PCs to mobile devices .
the measure of HP , the world &apos;s second largest PC manufacturer and one of the largest US tech companies , is the latest in this area that is based on the belief that eng focused companies perform better performance .
FC Arsen@@ al captain Mik@@ el Art@@ eta says that te@@ amm@@ ers must stand behind the game against Dynam@@ o Zagreb behind the injured Jack Wil@@ sh@@ ere
Wen@@ ger stressed to Wil@@ sh@@ ere that it is only September , and if his rehabilitation is according to plan , there is no reason why he can &apos;t play again before Christmas .
this optim@@ istic scenario already means that Wil@@ sh@@ ere will certainly miss at least the next four matches for England , and in view of its history , his involvement in the European Championship will certainly be un@@ certain in the next summer .
the great shame about this current problem is that Wil@@ sh@@ ere had ended the last season after a separate ank@@ le injury and then returned to his old momentum during the pre@@ season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this kind of injury does not thre@@ aten the career , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is a bone which did not heal well .
this is not a big matter .
this was just an accident .
it was not in connection with his Knuck@@ les or with the injuries he had before .
this may be true from a purely medical point of view , but as Wen@@ ger also recognized , there is the associated danger of further injuries , whenever a player tries to return in the middle of the season .
it also develops an unpleasant pattern .
the investigation of Prime Minister In@@ j@@ uries Ltd has recorded 23 different diseases of Wil@@ sh@@ ere since his debut six years ago .
he also played in just 65 of ar@@ sen@@ als 157 Lig@@ atter@@ iel@@ en in the last five seasons .
the broader picture for ar@@ sen@@ al is that they were in six of eight playing times since 2007 / 08 one of the two Premier League clubs that have had most vulner@@ ability days .
Wen@@ ger accepts the potential of a vi@@ cious circle , but Arsen@@ al believes that an improvement in the vulner@@ ability rate will last during the last season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sometimes , if you come back from a injury , you have a vulnerable time period , a time when you need to strengthen your body and win combat strength , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jack is young enough to overcome this .
I hope his body stabili@@ zes , I am confident that he will do it and he will go through a career of the way he deserves .
Arsen@@ al begins his Champions League season on Wednesday evening against Din@@ amo Zagreb in front of the games against Chelsea on Saturday and against Tot@@ ten@@ ham Hot@@ spur the next Wednesday , and Wen@@ ger introduces itself to a rotation within the team .
Hé@@ c@@ tor Bell@@ er@@ ín and Aaron Ram@@ sey have not travelled to Croatia , meaning that Math@@ ie@@ u Deb@@ u@@ chy and Art@@ eta are likely to start .
Wen@@ ger can also begin with K@@ ier@@ an Gib@@ bs and Olivier Gi@@ ro@@ ud instead of Nach@@ o Mon@@ real and The@@ o Wal@@ cot@@ t .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I try to keep the balance and give the players who need it to take a little break off , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although Arsen@@ al &apos;s Clear Favorites are to go on by group F , Mak@@ si@@ mir Stadium in Zagreb is one of the play@@ grounds with the biggest inti@@ mid@@ ation effect in Europe .
dynam@@ o is also unbe@@ aten after 41 games after the &quot; inv@@ inci@@ ble &quot; campaign started in the last season .
the stadium was sh@@ aken by an earthquake on Tuesday evening , with 3.2 measured on the Richter scale .
this year it was the 10th in Zagreb .
Wen@@ ger believes that ar@@ sen@@ al has pulled the lesson from the previous season with the Champions League capit@@ ulation against Monaco and is driven by the distant hope , with his management to lead the association to his first European Cup triumph .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this drive is immense , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it has never worked at ar@@ sen@@ al .
we were very close to it in 2006 but on the other hand I &apos;m long enough in business to be realistic .
we are ambitious but we are not dre@@ am@@ ers .
Fri@@ end@@ s@@ Fest : the com@@ edy show that gave us serious lessons on men &apos;s friend@@ ships
the lack of similar depic@@ tions in shows is obvious , especially with regard to how the need for men to open oneself , now even more des@@ perate than ever before , how su@@ icide rates among young men prove on a 15 @-@ year @-@ high .
in 2013 , it was the most important cause of death in men between 20 and 45 in the UK , and it is three times more common among men than women .
in an effort to tackle the problem , Camp@@ a@@ ign Ag@@ ainst Living Mis@@ er@@ ably ( Cal@@ m - campaign against a mis@@ erable life ) announced the year of the man with the aim of asking the culture to ask the men to seek help if they need them .
friendship is the cent@@ rep@@ iece of the fight to tackle this challenge .
a recent study at more than 2,000 high school students with depres@@ sive symptoms noticed that if the suff@@ erer had a sufficiently high percentage of friends with &quot; healthy mood , &quot; his chances of recovery were doubled .
for those who are not de@@ pressed , a circle of mentally healthy friends hal@@ ves the risks of mental problems .
but of course you have to have friends , so that a friendship can work .
in the age of communication led by social media , with its main focus on substance , the immedi@@ acy of the answer is often more important than a meaningful contact .
our digital life has doubled the need to appear strong , li@@ fel@@ ong and successful , even if in reality the isolation domin@@ ates .
this superf@@ icial success is dominated by what psych@@ ologists say extr@@ in@@ sic values ; money , image , social status , all at the expense of intr@@ in@@ sic values - our inner desire for personal development and friendship that affects our mental health much more deeply .
and like a video game invent@@ or and bil@@ li@@ on@@ aire recently declared money can really not buy luck .
the beauty of friends was that this focus was placed on the head .
every character was not defined by his work , but by his personality , which sh@@ ines through interaction as a friend .
the hum@@ our of Jo@@ ey and Ch@@ and@@ ler &apos;s frequent h@@ ug@@ s , moments in football bells in comfortable arm@@ chairs and the lon@@ ging of Ros@@ s to Rachel - all this came from knowing that men can definitely refer to it , even though they often hold back to explore their feelings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; like an employee of telephone past@@ oral care I explained : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my list@@ ener role for people who feel de@@ pressed and su@@ icide at risk has really clearly shown me how even the smallest inter@@ actions of friends can make a difference . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the men who contact us often feel unable to talk to friends .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the old phrase &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I come to cope with it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has an enormous effect , as the feeling that it is perceived as a weakness when talking about problems openly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
friends is one of the shows that comes to mind when I try to offer long @-@ term cop@@ ing mechanisms .
it clearly presents the small moments of men &apos;s friend@@ ships .
so much my objective external se@@ iter status about the phone to help people in moments of des@@ per@@ ation may also help , the long @-@ term support comes from a personal network of family and friends .
and so , if you visit Com@@ edy Central Fri@@ end@@ s@@ Fest this weekend with the celebrations of the day completely re@@ designed backdrop , why not take your friends to a drink in Central Per@@ k .
or even better , if you see someone alone in Star@@ bu@@ cks , give him a smile and say Hello .
you never know what difference your friendship could do .
friends will be sent to com@@ edy Central from the beginning to the end - the entire 236 ep@@ iso@@ des - for # Fri@@ end@@ s@@ Fest
di Maria meets to help PSG to cr@@ ush Malm@@ ö
angel Di Maria is celebrating with Bla@@ ise M@@ atu@@ i@@ di and Edin@@ son Cav@@ ani after his hit against Malm@@ ö .
di Maria meets at his debut in the Champions League on Tuesday and helps to advance in Malm@@ ö .
here are the game report and the reaction to the game .
angel Di Maria and Edin@@ son Cav@@ ani held course when Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main launched his Champions League season with an extremely comfortable 2 @-@ 0 victory against Malm@@ ö in the Prin@@ zen@@ park@@ stadium on Tuesday .
di Maria met less than four minutes after the start of his Champions League Deb@@ ü@@ ts as a PSG player who brought the French master to the way , but afterwards she missed a number of opportunities before she finally raised her lead when Cav@@ ani reached a head@@ set in the 6@@ 1st minute .
with Real Madrid and Sch@@ acht@@ j@@ or Don@@ ets@@ k also in group A , Paris needs a strong start against the Swedish champion , since they are not only striving to qualify for the kno@@ ck@@ out rounds , but an improvement on the way to the quarter fin@@ als in each of the last three campaigns .
but while they got the points , there was no classic game by Laurent Blan@@ cs team with Zlat@@ an I@@ bra@@ him@@ ovi@@ cs missed opportunities ahead of the gate . he was later replaced in the game against his home town team and against the club , with which he began his illustr@@ ative career in 1999 .
&quot; it &apos;s not easy to win at home or out in the Champions League . therefore , it &apos;s a good start to win 2 : 0 to cause problems to our opponents , even if there are certain things that we have to perf@@ ected in the course of the season , &quot; said Blanc .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a good sign . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we wanted to win and we won , although I regret that we did not have one or two more goals . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I@@ bra@@ him@@ ovic returned after his injury in one of three changes to the Paris team , which could last a 2 : 2 draw on his own court against Bordeaux in the first League , but he was stab@@ bed by Di Maria in the fourth minute .
the Argent@@ inian wing storm was referred to as the man who was taken over to the next level in Europe when he was taken over in the last month of Manchester United and he pointed out why , when he ran into Marco Ver@@ rat@@ tis Pass behind the Malm@@ ö defense , before he completed Johan Wil@@ and to the long corner of the network .
but if someone believed that he would achieve a great victory , he was disappointed .
Malm@@ ö , the Celtic in a play @-@ off hit to reach this level , joined An@@ pi@@ ff with nine national players in the field and was a great opponent with a five @-@ man defense and two deep in the middle field .
but besides a shot by Nik@@ ola D@@ jur@@ dj@@ ic , who passed far to Kevin Tr@@ app &apos;s posts in the 34@@ th minute , they offered little in the attack .
instead , the town itself sometimes abandoned itself , with some f@@ laws and bad degrees , not least from I@@ bra@@ him@@ ovic , who had no less than five trials in the first half and then abandoned after Cav@@ ani had used him after re@@ bo@@ oting .
nevertheless he proved a lot more skill when he brought his fellow players into play , and it was a passport by I@@ bra@@ him@@ ovic , which turned Di Maria into a shot , which was passed by Wil@@ and in the 5@@ 2nd minute at the pole ...
the second gate finally fell short after the hours stamp thanks to Cav@@ ani . thus the Urugu@@ ay@@ an sco@@ red his sixth sa@@ is@@ ont@@ or after I@@ bra@@ him@@ ovic had found a left flan@@ k of Max@@ well .
this ended up with all the thought that Malm@@ ö can return to the game , and only an excellent intervention from Wil@@ and from the short@@ est distance to stop David Lu@@ iz was able to keep the end result down before substitute player E@@ z@@ equi@@ el Lav@@ e@@ zzi completed a gate at the end .
the coach of Malm@@ ö , Age Har@@ ei@@ de , later admitted that PSG a class was playing over his team and the Norwe@@ gi@@ ans said : &quot; our last Champions League game was in December last year .
since then we have only played in the Swedish le@@ ague , which has not the same level .
the qualification games do not suff@@ ice . &quot;
hat@@ s off in front of Paris !
it was a great game of them !
gl@@ enc@@ ore colle@@ cts 2.5 billion $ through share sales
the mining giant Gl@@ enc@@ ore , based in Switzerland , which is affected by falling commodity prices , collected $ 2.5 billion on Wednesday through a stock selling as part of its huge redemption plan .
the company Gl@@ enc@@ ore registered in London said in a statement that it sold new shares worth about 1.6 billion £ in order to pay its own deb@@ ts .
the company , which has lost 57 percent of its market value this year , is struggling with falling raw materials prices , as China &apos;s economic down@@ turn expresses demand and has a devast@@ ating effect on markets .
the issue of reference rights brought a rapid rise to the head of the London Stock Exchange at retail at the early Wednesday morning .
the share jump@@ ed by 2.@@ 77 percent to 13@@ 1,60 p@@ ence on the FT@@ SE 100 Index , which opened 0.69 percent higher .
Gl@@ enc@@ ore last week had announced the 2.5 billion $ share sale as part of the more extensive plans to destroy roughly one @-@ third of its $ 30 billion deb@@ ts .
the company sold the new shar@@ ehol@@ dings to 125 P@@ ence per share , which meant a 2.4 percent discount on the closing price on Tuesday .
there were 1.3 billion shares worth up to 9.99 per cent of the Group .
concerns regarding long @-@ term growth in China have reduced iron ore prices by about half , coal , copper and other commodity prices declined by 20 to 40 percent .
refugees arrive in Weimar
on Tuesday , 49 people achieve the city administration in Weimar after a usually long run .

the White House confirms Xi Jin@@ p@@ ings &apos;s visit to Washington
Chinese president Xi Jin@@ ping will make a state visit to the US at the end of the month , confirmed the White House in an explanation on Tuesday .
the visit , the first official in Washington , takes place on 25 September and ref@@ utes President Barack Obama &apos;s trip to Beijing last November , said the statement .
the US President and First Lady Michelle Obama will also host the host of Xi and his wife Pen@@ g Li@@ yuan in a Sta@@ ats @-@ Dinner after the two leaders have bilateral discussions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; President xis Visit will be the opportunity to expand the American @-@ Chinese cooperation in a number of global , regional and bilateral issues of joint interest , but at the same time President Obama and President Xi provide the opportunity to construc@@ tively join areas of dis@@ agreements , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; adds the statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
XI , whose attendance was initially announced in February , is expected to meet several US technology leaders on its way to Washington before travelling to the United Nations General Assembly in September .
it is expected that Obama and Xi have addressed a number of controversi@@ al issues , including Washington &apos;s concerns regarding alleged Cyber@@ spi@@ on@@ age in China and its increasing self @-@ confidence in the controversi@@ al waters of the South China Sea .

X@@ avi : PE@@ P Gu@@ ardi@@ ola prevented a change from the FC Bayern
world and European champion X@@ avi has been playing for the al @-@ S@@ add Sport Club in Qatar since summer 2015
the FC Bayern were obviously shortly before the commitment of Spain &apos;s Super@@ star X@@ avi , who then played for FC Barcelona .
eight times Spanish champion , three times winner &apos;s champion , four times Champions League vic@@ tors , two times champion world champion , two times Europ@@ am@@ ei@@ ster , one time world champion - the title list of X@@ avi is stunning .
in the summer the 35 @-@ year @-@ old left FC Barcelona for 24 years and changed to Qatar for the al @-@ S@@ add Sport Club .
but in an interview with the Mar@@ ca X@@ avi now reveals that he stood before the European Championship before the departure from Barcelona .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you told me that Bar@@ ça wanted to sell me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Madrid won anything back then , we don &apos;t know anything , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he tells . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and that was the case of the FC Bayern .
X@@ avi : &quot; there was an offer from Bavaria . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rum@@ men@@ ig@@ ge wanted me to have me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in memory : in the summer of 2008 Jürgen Klin@@ smann took over the FC Bayern .
Gu@@ ardi@@ ola was the reason that X@@ avi did not change
but the change did not come about .
and the crucial man for this is now working for the German record master : PE@@ P Gu@@ ardi@@ ola .
X@@ avi explains why : &quot; Bar@@ ça has signed Gu@@ ardi@@ ola and I have played a great EM . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; PE@@ P told me that I wouldn &apos;t change that he couldn &apos;t imagine the team without me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with this he has led me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
who knows how Bay@@ erns playing time 2008 / 2009 would have been running X@@ avi .
X@@ avi was standing for Bar@@ ca in the quarter @-@ final of the Champions League against Bavaria about the entire distance on the lawn , the reds made out ( 4 : 0 , 1 : 1 ) and at the end celebrated the supreme triumph .
matt Dam@@ on plays variety in the film @-@ creating
matt Dam@@ on con@@ fron@@ ts the African @-@ American filmm@@ aker Eff@@ ie Brown while discussing the diversity and said she is not needed behind the scenes .
during a series of Sunday night of H@@ B@@ OS Project Green@@ light , the experienced actor Brown interrupted the need for alternative perspectives in terms of a black protagon@@ ist in the chosen screen@@ play of the project .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we talk about diversity , do it in the occupation of the film and not in the occupation of the show , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Dam@@ on . &quot; &quot; &quot;
brown re@@ acted sho@@ cked , with bel@@ ei@@ ved un@@ belief and called &quot; Ho@@ o ! w@@ ow . okay , &quot; when the comments of the actor of The Mar@@ tian strengthened himself .
Dam@@ on and Brown joined the producer colleagues Ben Aff@@ le@@ ck and the Far@@ rel@@ ly brothers to discuss the show fin@@ alists .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to encourage people to think about it - whoever will always be the director - how they treat the figure of Harmon@@ y , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Brown told her first . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the only black person , and she is a sp@@ line beaten by her white hal@@ ves .
the producer of De@@ ar White People campa@@ ign@@ ed for the fin@@ alists Leo Angel@@ os and K@@ risten Bran@@ c@@ accio for direc@@ ting direc@@ ting rights to the film ; Dam@@ on rep@@ lied that her direc@@ ting &quot; at the end could give us something we don &apos;t want . &quot;
after the discussion was broadcast , the social media explo@@ ded before dis@@ approval about Dam@@ on &apos;s comments .
twitter user Mr Po@@ oni expressed his anger over the clip , saying &quot; Matt Dam@@ on talks about the only black person in the room so he can explain their diversity - that &apos;s SO NO@@ WS that it hur@@ ts . &quot;
the twe@@ et deser@@ ved more than 5,000 ret@@ we@@ ets and 4,000 likes since its release .
women &apos;s comments arrive at a time when accurate r@@ acial representation in the media is at the head of the social discussion .
after the teen@@ age Michael Brown was killed in 2014 by a white police officer , the Movement Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter achieved nation@@ wide impact and ur@@ ged leg@@ is@@ lators and authorities to apply discrimin@@ atory practices against colour co@@ hesi@@ on .
in February , the singer Prince made a reference to the movement during the introduction of the nominated albums of the year at the Gram@@ my Awards .
&quot; albums still matter , &quot; ( albums still have their meaning ) he said .
like books and black life , albums still have their meaning .
in recent times leaders of the Movement Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter published an explanation and responded to the question of the Fox News Person@@ ality Elisabeth Has@@ sel@@ beck , whether the group should be considered as a hate group .
&quot; the Network Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter is a love group , &quot; said the leaders .
recently it was announced that Dam@@ on was on a list of enter@@ tain@@ ers , producers and media friends who are invited to visit the Pope to discuss the representation of the Catholic Church in the West .
whether he accepted the invitation or already met the Pope is un@@ clear .
&apos;@@ American Nin@@ ja War@@ rior &apos; crow@@ ned the first champion
professional Sport@@ kl@@ etter@@ er and operating help Isaac Cal@@ di@@ ero became the first ath@@ l@@ ete who won the American Nin@@ ja War@@ rior on Monday night and took home the Grand Prix of $ 1 million .
the competition show , which just completed their 7th season , had never experienced a competition participant who could complete all stages of his obstacle course .
during the season finale there were two men , Cal@@ di@@ ero and cam@@ er@@ aman Ge@@ off Br@@ itten , until the final .
at the last task the climbing was part of a 75 @-@ foot climbing rope in 30 seconds .
Br@@ itten finished the task at the time when he was the first ath@@ l@@ ete to complete the stren@@ uous Phase 4 of American Nin@@ ja War@@ rior . however Cal@@ di@@ ero completed this challenge at full three seconds faster , making him the winner .
Cal@@ di@@ ero spoke to E ! News after the hard @-@ fought victory , still under shock over the winning of the Grand Prix of $ 1 million .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I mean it &apos;s amazing to think about it , I have never earned more than 10,000 dollars or had life , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Isaac E ! about his bunch of money . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so all of a sudden .. as I can &apos;t even imagine how this is ... the future is unknown .
the leading producer K@@ ent We@@ ed sat down with The Hollywood Re@@ porter to discuss the Fin@@ als and why Br@@ itten , although he was the first ever finished the course , won &apos;t receive any prize money .
according to the rules , the money goes to the fastest person .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if there is more than one fin@@ alist , it gets the one with the fastest time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said We@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
how much money is a wonderful price and life changes , he gets the great ati@@ fication .
I don &apos;t think he had any gru@@ dge about it .
he is just so happy to have done what he did .
he received the masses of awards from fans .
he is such a great guy and a family father .
he is a hero for his children and his wife .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ge@@ off said to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If I should be sm@@ itten by anyone , then I am glad that Isaac is Isaac . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I think Isaac felt just as if they had changed the roles .
America Nin@@ ja War@@ rior was extended for an eighth season , the fil@@ ming will begin in spring 2016 .
Det@@ ro@@ it Tig@@ ers past Minn@@ es@@ ota Twin@@ s
MIN@@ NE@@ AP@@ OL@@ IS@@ --@@ the second half of the season was not especially funny for the Det@@ ro@@ it Tig@@ ers .
in the past , they were once one of the best teams in bas@@ eb@@ all , today the Tig@@ ers are at the last place in the American League Central .
the tig@@ ers are reduced to their role as spo@@ ilers , but played this part on Tuesday perfectly against the Minn@@ es@@ ota Twin@@ s with 5 @-@ 4 in the target field .
the Twin@@ s turned up a chance to climb within one half of the Houston branch of the Houston branch for the second American League game of wild@@ card .
for Det@@ ro@@ it , even if only for one evening , it was a return of the three letter F @-@ word that was so difficult to grasp over a large part of the second half of the season .
&quot; all vic@@ tories are fun , no matter how it comes , &quot; said Tig@@ ers Manager Brad E@@ mus .
tiger @-@ Pit@@ cher Al@@ fre@@ do Simon kept his early offensive support , when Det@@ ro@@ it sco@@ red three times in the first two inn@@ ings , then once in the sixth and then again in the ninth .
Simon ( 13 @-@ 9 ) hit 6 times in the 1 / 3 inn@@ ings and made three laps possible .
it was only his third successful start in his last nine games .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to end this year strongly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Simon . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it &apos;s hard to throw in the bul@@ l@@ pen of any game , and so I want to concentrate completely in the game .
the design@@ ate Tiger @-@ Hit@@ ter Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z had three hits and was in two runs , his first round since mid @-@ August .
it was the first three @-@ year hit by Mart@@ ine@@ z since he had four hits against the Seattle marin@@ ers on July 6th .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has curved the punch wood , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Em@@ mus . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he looked good at ( punch training ) , saw clearly better from the bul@@ l@@ pen , and he brought it straight into the game .
with three R@@ uns in the rear @-@ meeting at the end of the seventh interior , the Twin@@ s had their best chance to get back into play again .
center FI@@ EL@@ DER B@@ yr@@ on Bu@@ x@@ ton finished the inning with a double on the left field line .
right FI@@ EL@@ DER Aaron H@@ icks reached a b@@ unt , and Simon completed his second eman Brian Do@@ zier on the Stri@@ ke@@ out before he was replaced by the left @-@ handed Bla@@ ine Har@@ dy .
Har@@ dy passed down wall , the only man faced with whom he was confronted , before the design@@ ate R@@ ook@@ ie @-@ Schlag@@ mann Miguel S@@ ano , who has a Two @-@ Run escape to the right @-@ handed Dre@@ w Ver@@ hagen .
with a pair of runners and the closing run on the second , Ver@@ hagen launched the third Bas@@ eman Tre@@ vor pl@@ ou@@ ffe for a double play .
it was the 27th edition of the Major League for the 27th time in this season that Pl@@ ou@@ ffe beat a double play
after Det@@ ro@@ it added a Insurance @-@ Run at the end of the ninth intern , wall made a R@@ BI double against the C@@ loser of the Tig@@ ers Bruce Ron@@ don and achieved the stand of 5 @-@ 4 .
however , the right @-@ handed man stab@@ bed S@@ ano in three Pit@@ ches for his fifth place .
Det@@ ro@@ it benef@@ ited from the opening of the game by an even non @-@ moving Phil Hu@@ gh@@ es .
the tig@@ ers achieved three races in the first two inn@@ ings against the right @-@ handed veter@@ an , who had been painted before the game by the jury of injuries , after being ste@@ aling more than a month because of a spinal cord .
&quot; obviously not the beginning I desired , &quot; said Hu@@ gh@@ es , &quot; but I felt better when I started and sen@@ sed that I would create some pretty good Pit@@ ches in the third inning . &quot;
after receiving the Le@@ ad@@ off Bat@@ ter in the first , H@@ ushes made a single second to Second Bas@@ eman Ian Mc@@ Kin@@ s@@ ler .
a Two @-@ Out Walk for J@@ .D. Mart@@ ine@@ z brought Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z to play a single &quot; up the middle &quot; at the first run of the game .
Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z finished his 0 @-@ 21 Suc@@ cess series with the runner in the scor@@ ing position .
the third Bas@@ eman Nick Castell@@ anos followed a single on the right , creating another run , but Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z was thrown out of the game when he tried to get to the third , which ended the threat .
the tig@@ ers placed in the second , achieved a one @-@ out double by Cat@@ cher James Mc@@ C@@ ann and a Two @-@ Out Single from Center @-@ FI@@ EL@@ DER Anthony Mount to 3 @-@ 0 .
&quot; that was a great blow , &quot; said Twin@@ s Manager Paul Mol@@ itor .
he did not kno@@ ck very well , but he caught the right place .
Hu@@ gh@@ es was in a Pit@@ ch @-@ Count , sco@@ red no points in the third inning before he was replaced by A.@@ J.@@ A@@ chter by the Rel@@ ie@@ ver right @-@ handed .
at Hu@@ gh@@ es it came to three races with six hits and a walk with four stro@@ ke@@ outs .

Isch@@ inger : German military measures in Syria an option
the head of the Munich Security Conference , Wolfgang Isch@@ inger , holds military measures with German participation in Syria for an opportunity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think the f@@ are@@ well thinking about military action options must not take place without Germany , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he accused the European states &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Collec@@ tive Ide@@ as &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
four years ago , one was happy that the ch@@ ali@@ ce had passed by a military involvement in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now the conflict lands in front of our door@@ step , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in Deut@@ schland@@ funk . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the former German ambassador in Washington also called for a massive increase of international aid on site for refugees .
Austria controls southern and eastern borders
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after Germany , Austria has again introduced controls on its southern and eastern borders . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Austrian Ministry of Interior , Johanna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner , declared OR@@ F on Tuesday evening , and no one will be sent back to Hungary .
sorry , this entry is only available in Deutsch .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , it is so agreed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she declared . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the question of an agreement , after which Germany could accommodate a certain number of refugees from Austria per day , Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner said that there have already been discussions between the Director General for Public Security and representatives of Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concrete figures did not call it and referred to talks on Wednesday in Berlin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
over the past few days tens of thousands of refugees from Hungary came to Austria via the so @-@ called Balkan route .
your destination is usually Germany .
Chancellor Angela Merkel ( C@@ DU ) and her Austrian colleague Werner F@@ ay@@ mann applied for a special summit next week with several other EU heads of state and government .
Germany had begun on Sunday with temporary border controls .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the EU states have so far not been able to agree on a common approach in the crisis . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the EU interior ministers want to take a new start to a binding distribution of another 120 000 refugees at a special meeting on Tuesday ( 22 September ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in view of the strong refugee sent in Germany , the federal government wants to support the countries in the initial up@@ take and distribution of people more strongly .
the Cov@@ en@@ ant will manage this together with the countries , Merkel announced on the late Tuesday evening after nearly four hour consult@@ ations with the Prime Minister in the Chancell@@ ery in Berlin .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Merkel under@@ lined , those people who needed protection came to him . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but those who don &apos;t have a lead perspective could not stay in Germany either .
this view was dealt with in the round .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the chan@@ cell@@ or stressed that the state as a whole must now master a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; huge effort &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thousands of des@@ perate refugees are now stuck on the Balkans .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hungary had closed its 175 km long border with Serbia on the night of Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a few hours later the government announced in Budapest to seal the border with Romania with a fence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this neighboring country is different from Serbia to the EU . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hungary wants to prevent tu@@ g@@ boats depar@@ ting from Romania , Hungary &apos;s Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to said to the planned new border fence .
the Romanian government immediately condemned the plan .
there were first ar@@ rests of people who had cut the fence .
in Turkey , according to e@@ ye@@ witnesses , thousands more migrants were on their way to the Greek border .
space probe &quot; Cass@@ ini &quot; takes place ocean on Satur@@ n@@ mond En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us
unter dem E@@ isp@@ an@@ zer des Satur@@ n@@ mon@@ ds En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us is a global ocean .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this includes researchers from observ@@ ations of the spac@@ ecraft &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cass@@ ini &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
accordingly the moon is easily stag@@ gering on its or@@ bit around the ring planet .
this de@@ af movement is only small , but still too big for a continuous solid heavenly body , it is said in a message from Corn@@ ell University in I@@ th@@ aca ( US state New York ) of Tuesday .
the researchers present their analyses in the &quot; I@@ car@@ us . &quot;
even longer was known that there must be liquid water under the ice @-@ ceiling of En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cass@@ ini &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; had already discovered in 2006 Ice Vul@@ cans at the South Pole of the Satur@@ n@@ moon , sp@@ itting the steam and ice particles and thus fed the so @-@ called E @-@ ring of Saturn . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at least at the south pole there must be an underground sea , the astronom@@ ers closed at that time .
however , the expansion of the hidden ocean was not clar@@ ified .
R@@ ama l@@ acks 1860 München several weeks
the 1860 München must ab@@ stain from around one month to the editor Val@@ det R@@ ama .
an investigation had an ad@@ duction injury during the 27 @-@ year @-@ old , the association reported .
R@@ ama had already compl@@ ained about pain at the beginning of the week .
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to the Munich lion , the diagnosis means &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; expected four weeks break . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is difficult for us , R@@ ama is a her@@ ber loss . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , we need to think now , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said sports director Nec@@ at Ay@@ gü@@ n of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bild &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; newspaper with a view to the possible commitment of a seamless professional . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as a training guest , however , the Six@@ ties initially presented a def@@ ensive man .
the 30 @-@ year @-@ old Hr@@ vo@@ je C@@ ale was active in Belgium and was already under contract already at the V@@ f@@ L Wolfs@@ burg .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Cro@@ at is currently &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ability to prove his ability . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after his conc@@ ussion , Tor@@ j@@ äger Rub@@ in Ok@@ ot@@ ie will return to the team training next week .
already on Thursday the Austrian national player is supposed to start running .
Ok@@ ot@@ ie had injured in the game at Fort@@ una Düsseldorf ( 0 : 3 ) at a violent cl@@ ash on the head .
contrary to the first fears he remained without a serious blow .
no diet fruit - man@@ goes contain a lot of sugar
man@@ goes are exotic and ju@@ icy @-@ sweet .
but he who wants to pay attention to his slender line is often rather dis@@ cour@@ aged by them .
man@@ goes contain relatively much sugar - especially suc@@ rose .
the exotic fruits are still healthy : in them are the B vitamins , as well as vitamins E and C. In particular , man@@ goes contain a lot of vitamin A and its prec@@ urs@@ or beta car@@ ot@@ ene .
whoever e@@ ats the fruits , thus helps tend@@ on , immune system and met@@ abolic processes in the body .
when buying man@@ gos should not be too soft or firm and sm@@ ells pleasant .
the colour of the shell alone tells nothing about how ripe the fruit is - so also green man@@ goes can taste very tasty .
you should store it at room temperature and be consumed within a few days .
then they taste pure or in sweet foods .
a man@@ go also gives hear@@ ty dishes a special note .
it sof@@ tens the slightly bitter taste of some leaf sal@@ ads such as Chic@@ ore@@ e and Radi@@ c@@ cio .

first F@@ öhn@@ sturm , then striking cold front
in the coming night falls in the valleys of the alpine side of the F@@ öh@@ n , as Met@@ e@@ o@@ Schweiz hur@@ ried on Tuesday .
on Wednesday and in the night to Thursday the F@@ öh@@ n blo@@ ws partly with storm strength through the p@@ amper@@ ing valleys .
after F@@ öhn@@ ende on Thursday morning we cross a striking cold front , which brings heavy ra@@ inf@@ alls , wind gu@@ sts and a temperature decline .
as Met@@ e@@ o@@ News writes in a message , Switzerland is currently on the front of an extensive deep @-@ pressure region across the British Is@@ les in a strong south@@ western flow .
on the side of the Alps it breaks through the valleys in the night to the Wednesday of the F@@ öh@@ n .
in the wake of the F@@ öh@@ n until Thursday morning in the foo@@ th@@ ills with Bö@@ en from 60 to 100 km / h , isolated and especially in the Ur@@ i land partly also with over 100 km / h .
the f@@ öh@@ n can penet@@ rate up to the adjacent centre and on the mountains even or@@ can @-@ bu@@ cks of more than 120 km / h are possible .
while in the north on Wednesday mixer f@@ öh@@ n leaves for summer temperatures of 23 to 27 degrees , the humidity begins to st@@ ow on the mountain hill@@ side .
here the rain sets up , which lasts until Thursday evening .
in total , in the south of the Alps in the next 48 hours with partially more than 100 litres of rain per square meter , this is expected after already large amounts of rain have already fallen during the last few days .
on Thursday morning the F@@ öh@@ n leaves the air , as a result , a cold front rolls with powerful , partly we@@ ather@@ ed rain from west to east via Switzerland .
along with the cold front the wind is strong to stor@@ my and the temperatures are going back considerably .
the following days present in the north autumn with 15 to 20 degrees , in the south , on the other hand , it will be sunny and warmer at weekends with up to 25 degrees .
Rome now has a Martin @-@ Luther @-@ Platz
almost 500 years after the Reformation , there is now a Martin Luther place in Rome .
in the presence of city president Ign@@ azi@@ o Marino , a previously nam@@ eless place in the park on the Opp@@ io Hill was baptized in the name of the German Re@@ former .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Piazza Martin Lu@@ ter@@ o &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he is now hon@@ oured as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; German the@@ ologi@@ an of the Reformation &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the park is located in the middle of the old Rome next to the Col@@ os@@ se@@ um .
the nam@@ ing was filed for by the working community of the Protest@@ ant churches in Rome .
Jens @-@ Martin Kr@@ use , the past@@ or of the Evangel@@ ical Lutheran congregation in Rome , rec@@ alled the fact that the Protest@@ ants in the City of Pop@@ es have often lived as a minority in the bor@@ ro@@ wings over the centuries as a minority .
with the plaz@@ a I become visible in a symbolic way that their tradition of Christian faith is welcome in Rome .
Martin Luther ( 14@@ 83 @-@ 15@@ 46 ) was a young August@@ inian mon@@ k around the year 15@@ 10 / 11 a few months in Rome .
he felt the city then as a dep@@ rec@@ ated sin ba@@ bel .
his negative impressions were encouraged by histori@@ ans in his later struggle against Rome .
Luther then initiated the division of the Western Church with his th@@ eses against the off @-@ the @-@ face trade .
Hammer artists invested three years in the personal interpretation of the Bible
Jesus with the ( gold plated ) crown is one of the Haupt@@ werk that Ot@@ mar Alt has painted for his Bible .
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost wrote the introduction and refresh@@ ed Bible texts .
in the beginning was the Word ?
no , not at the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Bible , which now has been published with gorgeous pictures .
in the beginning was the image for Ot@@ mar Alt , who formulated his very personal interpret@@ ations of biblical stories on paper and canvas in 150 motifs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; language &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with colorful colours and imagin@@ ative forms has preserved the 75 @-@ year @-@ old - but which is by no means syn@@ onymous with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; funny &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pictures . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the contrary : adapted to the respective topics , this can be quite dark .
Ot@@ mar Alt has worked on his bi@@ ble project for about three years , for which he has made a subjective and artistic selection from the many topics of the book of all books .
these are cycles that focus on topics such as the Way of the Cross , Pl@@ agues , commandments or Fa@@ ther@@ land .
he immediately fascinated several partners : this holds for the Luther @-@ Verlag with his the@@ ological orientation as well as for the Kettler @-@ Verlag with his main focus on art books .
and there is , above all , the author Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost , who , on the basis of painting , dealt with the respective Bible passages .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he interpreted the scrip@@ tures chosen by Ot@@ mar Alt and thus translated into current context . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these texts are like verb@@ al mirrors of Al@@ ts &apos;s painting .
they are embedded between the original Bible study of Martin Luther and one sentence of the artist , who formulated his very personal thoughts on the situation .
the jewelry cord has golden letters .
thus the 75 @-@ year @-@ old gives twice a deep insight into his soul , his emotions .
this is a high level of in@@ tim@@ acy .
emotions were ultimately trigger for the Bible project : Ot@@ mar Alt , born in 1940 in Wern@@ ig@@ ero@@ de and grew up in Berlin , comes from a family who belonged to the strict Protest@@ ant Mor@@ avian Order .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then the up@@ bringing took place with the cane , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ot@@ mar Alt re@@ members . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have tried to re@@ work that , perhaps to bring me back to my father &apos;s father . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his second concern is to increase the importance of art in a fast @-@ moving time : &quot; the perception of picture worlds is marked today by advertising , and that is no@@ isy .
symbol@@ ism is ur@@ ged there .
artists have a different pleasure and pleasure to show things .
pictures always have something mysterious and are not decorative .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this respect I am a din@@ osau@@ r . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ot@@ mar Alt wants the viewers to &quot; trap &quot; into the images , let them work , discover and sense what power they have : &quot; the image is looking for its opposite . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost was on Tuesday at the presentation of the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Bible in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Stiftung , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; always been a lover of Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts art : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I like how he understands life with his pictures . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
old did not pay attention to the Bible fully , but the most important , also mysterious subjects chosen for him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was no collaboration at eye level , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Alt@@ ep@@ ost : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here it is about the pictures , the text only explains . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; arose a picture Bible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; for Hans Mö@@ h@@ ler from Luther @-@ Verlag , this work is an invitation to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; deep@@ en his life and find freedom . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts paintings speak for Mö@@ h@@ ler both the ( biblical ) language of love and responsibility .
a part of the origin@@ als - paper and canvas pictures - is presented for the first time in an exhibition opened on November 15 in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Stiftung .
beginning of construction for BM@@ X @-@ Bahn
plans made , place found , companies tas@@ ked to model Earth gu@@ ardi@@ ans for a circuit : one year later almost everything was finished - but before the official opening of the BM@@ X railway it was already finished .
om@@ issions in politics and administration ensured se@@ dition , especially among the residents who did not toler@@ ate the rail@@ ways .
so hill sh@@ iel@@ ded , new place wanted - now with formal planning and application for building permit .
the approval will be received in October , the first joint site Sabine Mos@@ eb@@ ach @-@ Bo@@ ck has now been informed of the Children &apos;s and Youth Committee .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I hope this year is still visible , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it should then be started without a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; further memorial break &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the work at the former indoor swimming pool . &quot; &quot; &quot;
DF@@ B intensi@@ fies commitment to refugees
the DF@@ B extends its commitment to refugees until 2019 , the Bundes@@ liga sets a clear sign on the weekend .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; football respon@@ ds to the escal@@ ating situation in Germany and sec@@ ures its help in tac@@ kling the upcoming problems . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think this is the biggest challenge in our country since the re@@ unification . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there can no one say in principle , that doesn &apos;t go on me , I have nothing to do with it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this must interest each individual to get a grip on this issue , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said DF@@ B chief Wolfgang Nier@@ sbach . &quot; &quot; &quot;
during the annual meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel on 23 September in Berlin , he will discuss the refugee situation in Germany intensively .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am in the Chancell@@ ery next Wednesday and meet the Minister of State Mrs. Ö@@ zo@@ ğ@@ u@@ z and the chan@@ cell@@ or . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the topic will surely play a central role , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he announced . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the football can and wants to help .
but the decisive turn@@ outs must put the policy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the German Football Association has therefore extended its &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for four years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; through the E@@ gi@@ di@@ us @-@ Braun Stiftung , we ensured that this program continues until 2019 , &quot; said Nier@@ sbach on the br@@ ink of the UEF@@ A meeting in St. Julian &apos;s / Malta .
also some federal li@@ gi@@ sts support this program .
&quot; &quot; &quot; already on this weekend , the 36 professional clubs set a clear sign if they will take the im@@ print &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; We help - # Refu@@ ge@@ es@@ Welcome &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; instead of the usual sponsor logo ( Her@@ mes ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to make it clear that everyone should help wherever and how they can , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Le@@ verk@@ usen &apos;s sports manager Ru@@ di Völ@@ ler of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bild &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; newspaper ( Tuesday ) and described the project as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; self @-@ evident &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the refugee drama goes to everyone , nobody must be able to see . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can use soccer @-@ federal li@@ gi@@ sts , no , we have to use our radi@@ ance , our influence and our possibilities to help the many refugees who have suffered so incredibly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hertha @-@ manager Michael Pre@@ etz . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ offen@@ heim CEO Peter Ret@@ tig spoke of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prominent sign of the le@@ ague &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the European Championships against Hungary this Friday , the national team of the women invites 100 refugees to Halle / Sa@@ ale .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Nier@@ sbach was awarded the support of refugees as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a big community of German football . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that all 36 license agreements have started their own projects in their own locations , be great .
just as great is that small and smallest associations are active there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the message &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we spent is lived in football . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is of enormous importance , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this year and next year , the association will join the DF@@ B selection and the Federal Government 300 000 euros for the integration of refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the clubs have already retri@@ eved the whole sum for 2015 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Nier@@ sbach . &quot; &quot; &quot;

the Board of Management of Europe &apos;s largest software group , Bill Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t , report@@ edly lost the left eye due to a fall in early July .
&quot; &quot; &quot; after midnight on the staircase in the house of his brother in the USA he was dropped to a glass of water , which he carried in the left hand , reports the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wirtschafts@@ Woche &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; he almost ble@@ eds , was power@@ less , then drag@@ ged out to the street - that &apos;s what he told us last week , &quot; quoted the &quot; W@@ IW@@ O &quot; SAP co @-@ founder Has@@ so Platt@@ ner .
but Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t could do his job .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the beginning of October we meet before the Supervisory Board meeting in Wall@@ dorf , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Platt@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 54 year old manager should be at the meeting and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fully working &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t announced an interview with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Thursday edition ) , he will come back to Germany in October and run further to the software group . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am full for SAP , full in my job . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; of course I was in regular contact with the Supervisory Board and its chairman Has@@ so Platt@@ ner , &quot; said Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t of the &quot; SZ . &quot;
Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t tends to commu@@ te between Germany and the US , but since the summer he was no longer in the German SAP headquarters in Wall@@ dorf .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is important to him to go to the public with such a personal story , the Manager of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; SZ &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everyone can happen something like that . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important to stop up once you have fallen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

football : Bv@@ B without Re@@ us vs. Kr@@ as@@ no@@ dar : Weis@@ sen@@ f@@ eller im Tor
at Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund all hopes for a com@@ eback of Marco Re@@ us have finally crum@@ bled in the first group play of the Europa League .
the national player will also be ab@@ sent to the leader of the Bundes@@ liga in Du@@ ell with the F@@ K Kr@@ as@@ no@@ dar on Thursday ( 7 : 00 p.m. / Sky ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unfortunately we cannot rely on him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Thomas Tu@@ chel on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; if Re@@ us will be back on Sunday in the Bundes@@ liga @-@ Top@@ spiel against Le@@ verk@@ usen , the BV@@ B coach leaves open : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we expect a return from him to the training on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in view of the high load of its pro@@ s , Tu@@ chel will not only change its stem cell position on the re@@ us position .
so he announced a change on the door holding position .
therefore Roman Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller takes the place of Stamm@@ ke@@ eper Roman Bür@@ ki .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he trains at an absolute top level , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the football @-@ teacher praised the world champion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , whether the course of the course is in the future in all Europe le@@ ague games , but Tu@@ chel has left open .
with a high probability he will also deny the second game .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the for@@ ged statement by fellow player Re@@ us that the final entry for the BV@@ B in the Europa League must be the goal , holds the mid@@ fiel@@ der Julian W@@ eig@@ l for comprehen@@ sible : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that &apos;s why Marco is not so wrong . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we have a good chance to access the title . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Robot@@ er@@ au@@ tos : government wants a pione@@ ering role in Germany
according to the Federal Government &apos;s will , Germany should be a technological pioneer in the change of the car .
on Wednesday , the Federal Cab@@ inet decided on Wednesday a strategy paper from the house of transport ministers Alexander Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t ( CS@@ U ) , which includes investments in the expansion of digital infrastructure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t spoke of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; new mobility era &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Wednesday in Frankfurt on the edge of the I@@ AA car fair . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the automated and connected driving will increase road safety and ensure less traffic , Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t said .
he wants to discuss the topic with his counter@@ parts from the G@@ 7 States , who come together with industry representatives at the I@@ AA .
the strategy paper of the Ministry of Transport emphas@@ ises , among other things , the importance of mobile broad@@ band expansion and rapid increase on digital radio communications .
testing of new technology is currently being built on the highway 9 in Bavaria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in order to allow the driver to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no additional liability risks &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the federal government wants to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; check the legal framework &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and , where necessary , adapt to the new developments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for example , Germany wants to employ around internationally that the maximum speed for self @-@ prop@@ elled cars from 10 to 130 km / h is raised .
the Federal Government also wants to apply for a change in the Vienna Convention , which so far only sees people as drivers .
with automated driving , the car increasingly takes the lead , the driver becomes more and more passenger .
the technology is mainly based on sensors and cameras that capture the environment and process data in seconds .
according to a study presented by the Ministry of Economy , highly automated driving will be technically possible on motor@@ ways until 2020 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , drive @-@ free cars on public roads &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; will not be expected far after 2020 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
value creation in the field of driver assistance systems and the highly automated driving functions in Germany is estim@@ ating the authors of the study by 2025 to around 8.4 billion euros .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the digital networking of the passenger can lead to greater safety and efficiency in road traffic , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said S@@ ör@@ en Bar@@ to@@ l . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the question of liability in cases of accidents and the security of the personal data of the drivers must be clearly clar@@ ified .
but the German self @-@ prop@@ elled cars still look sk@@ ep@@ tical - much more than French or Americans .
a survey by the For@@ sa Institute presented on Wednesday at the AA conducted by the For@@ sa Institute on behalf of the Prü@@ for@@ gan@@ ization Dec@@ ra comes to the conclusion that only eight percent of Germans believe that autonomous driving cars will be en@@ forced in the next ten years , 32 percent count on it for 20 years now , 31 per cent believe not at all .
in France , 21 percent of respon@@ dents reck@@ on by 2025 with autonomous driving cars , in the USA 33 percent .
in any case , drivers in Germany are not yet ready to rely completely on a self @-@ prop@@ elled vehicle .
after a survey of the digital ban Bit@@ kom , only seven percent would agree to give the control during the whole trip on all roads .
on the motorway , the traffic in flowing traffic could at least imagine 15 percent , in the traffic jam 45 percent .
good every fourth would leave the car under no circumstances .
B@@ oll says team and double start at table tennis - EM
according to current status , the Düsseldorf Congress will only want to hit the title on the title fight from September 25 to October 4 .
the final decision is to be made at the latest on September 22 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a huge loss for our team . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the boys experienced it in the morning . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we are strong enough to win the title without Timo , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bundest@@ ra@@ iner Jörg Ro@@ ß@@ kopf during the European course in Düsseldorf . &quot; &quot; &quot;
B@@ oll was at this time on the flight to a long @-@ term agreed upon sponsor@@ ship in China .
the 34 year old German champion is expected to return on Friday .
&quot; without Timo , the dis@@ advantage , we are no longer such a clear favourite , &quot; stated single European champion Dimit@@ ri@@ j Ov@@ char@@ ov .
the Ham@@ el@@ ner , who leads the S@@ etz@@ ler in Y@@ ek@@ ater@@ in@@ burg , also rec@@ alled the European Championship in Sch@@ wech@@ at .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at that time Timo was also missing , and we have become european champion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we should orient@@ ate ourselves to it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained the world @-@ d@@ rank @-@ list Fi@@ fth . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Gaul@@ tier feels too old for an en@@ f@@ ant
it is a mixture of very big fashion show and a wax figur@@ ines : the designer Jean Paul Gaul@@ tier ( 63 ) presented an exhibition about his work on Wednesday in Munich .
highlights : man@@ ne@@ qu@@ ins that look horri@@ fying human due to video proj@@ ections .
they wear the spectacular creations of the French designer , who , among other things , became the big star of the fashion scene with Mad@@ onn@@ as stage out@@ fits - and that he put men in skirts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can no longer say today that I am the en@@ f@@ ant terrible of Haute Cou@@ ture because I have white hair . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in former times it was ble@@ ached , meanwhile it &apos;s real , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gaul@@ tier said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the visitors of the exhibition &quot; From The Side@@ walk To The Cat@@ walk &quot; ( From the side@@ walk to the cat@@ walk ) , which is to be seen from 18th September at the Kunsth@@ alle der Hyp@@ o @-@ Kultur@@ stiftung , it is a good fortune that the fashion designer has changed his initially rejected attitude towards a show of his person .
&quot; &quot; &quot; actually he was on the other hand , because : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an exhibition so@@ unded a bit after death , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when you die , you come to the museum .
the impressive collection had already been made in the Canadian Montreal and Paris station .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s about so much more than just beautiful clothes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Director of the Kunsth@@ alle , Roger D@@ ieder@@ en . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is about tolerance , acceptance and the vision of an open society .
the exhibits give an insight into what is hardly an over@@ looked work of the man who wrote fashion history without ever having completed an education .
chron@@ ologically , the show is not built , but it is an excell@@ ently chore@@ ograph@@ ed Gesamt@@ kunst@@ werk , which has been run for a great deal of effort : to dev@@ ise the dolls , for example , a sty@@ list was engaged .
14 tons of material have drawn the makers according to the cur@@ ator Thierry @-@ Maxim@@ e L@@ ori@@ ot to Munich .
shortly before the start of the Oktober@@ fest there was still a special delic@@ acy : a leather trousers out@@ fit with cor@@ set .
Hei@@ di meets Madonna .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he is always interested in strong women ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; women are smar@@ ter than men &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) and for people who are a little different , Gaul@@ tier said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gaul@@ ti@@ ers &apos;s old Teddy can be seen in the exhibition .
he stands for the first , delicate fashi@@ oned attempts of the designer .
as a child ( he was not a good student and bad in football ) he put on his Teddy B@@ H@@ s and dresses , Gaul@@ tier said .
playing with a d@@ oll , his parents would not have allowed him .
he later taught the designing of fashion .
he st@@ ole fashion magazines and saw the dra@@ fts of other designers , as Gaul@@ tier reported in Munich .
later I bought it , but of course .
for his first own fashion show he did not have to pay the models .
they got nothing , but were allowed to keep the clothes .
jewellery instead of curtain - Pl@@ au@@ ener tip as fashion ni@@ ches
in the past , the long embroi@@ der@@ y machines in and around Pl@@ auen were about to make meters .
the embroi@@ dered materials and sp@@ ik@@ es were created in large quantities for customers , for example for blan@@ kets and she@@ ers .
this alone does not work anymore , explains Andreas Rein@@ hardt , Managing Director of the Mo@@ desp@@ itze Pl@@ auen .
instead , the fashion is important again .
in the early times of the Pl@@ au@@ ener Spitze fashion played a major role , was then displ@@ aced by the Heim@@ tex@@ ti@@ lindustrie - and is now re@@ discovered as a niche .
Rein@@ hardt calls some examples : lace in jewelry , in accessories such as bags and with regional costumes .
at all , the so @-@ called vintage fashion , which le@@ aning on past sty@@ listic periods , is an increasing job potential .
those who do not use ni@@ ches in the textile industry in Germany are no longer on the market .
with us , they already make up half of all orders .
fashion SHO@@ WS , together with nine other companies , is a member of the industry association Pl@@ au@@ ener Spitze and embroi@@ der@@ ies .
only they are allowed to wear the protected label .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the past 15 years , some 80 percent of the turnover has been broken . &quot; &quot; &quot;
private specialty shops and wholesale are almost no longer available .
our products hardly reach the customer on this path .
nowadays , the mass @-@ commodity is much cheaper manufactured in the Asian region and is sold almost exclusively via chains .
export , currently export@@ ing to Russia and the United States .
there are enough reasons for new ways .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the industry association also seeks to score points , such as Cor@@ d@@ ula Bauer by the Stick@@ per@@ le in Fal@@ k@@ enstein : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since this year we run a quality seal , which shows that we produce environmentally and socially responsible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Rein@@ hardt adds : &quot; this refers to the materials used . &quot;
diploma architect U@@ te Schmidt teaches at the Schnee@@ berger Auß@@ enst@@ elle der West@@ s@@ ächs@@ ische Hochschule Z@@ wick@@ au - at the Faculty of Applied Arts - speci@@ alizing in embroi@@ der@@ ies and sp@@ ik@@ es .
to counter@@ act the competition from the Asian region , you have to find high quality and innovative products .
it takes time and courage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it creates a tension between the fresh@@ est ideas of the designers and the companies that must think above all economically , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Schmidt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
therefore an existing design is often only slightly modified to keep a customer base .
a few years ago , textile designer Kat@@ i Re@@ uter rebuilt the historic snow@@ ball tip .
in doing so , the machine sends small kitchens at some places .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Pl@@ au@@ ener gold@@ smith &apos;s championship in Bianca H@@ alle@@ bach @-@ Kr@@ au@@ ße was inspired by this : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I could not start with traditional Pl@@ au@@ ener Spitze . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
now she uses the snow ball tip for her jewellery .
in an elaborate method , she shapes the pattern in silver .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many people in the region identify with the topic Pl@@ au@@ ener Spitze - young and old , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Re@@ uter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it also supplies to the United States , Australia and Finland - mainly to customers whose ancestors lived in Pl@@ auen and its surroundings and who would like to take a memor@@ ative piece of memory .
with this I see my jewelry as a modern ambassador of the Pl@@ au@@ ener tip .
Disney plans new &quot; Mary P@@ opp@@ ins &quot; movie
legends should not be touched , but Disney doesn &apos;t dare to mention a new movie of his classic &quot; Mary P@@ opp@@ ins . &quot;
according to &quot; Entertainment Week@@ ly &quot; it is not a re @-@ film , but a kind of continuation which plays 20 years after the first film with the magical children &apos;s girl .
it is about the experiences of the N@@ anny with the B@@ anks family in times of the world economic crisis in England .
anyone who plays P@@ opp@@ ins more than 50 years after Ju@@ lie Andre@@ ws is still un@@ clear .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but the director already stands firm : Rob Marshall , last with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; In@@ to the Woods &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the cinema . &quot; &quot; &quot;
XI ur@@ ges to open the economy broad@@ ly for the world
the economy needs to open wide out@@ ward to foster growth , said President Xi Jin@@ ping on Tuesday of a group that was tas@@ ked with the reform of the reform .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; China should stand up to attract foreign investment and know @-@ how and improve strategies for business start @-@ ups , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in a speech at the 16th session of the Central Command Group for the deep@@ ening of a comprehensive reform . &quot; &quot; &quot;
to promote new start @-@ ups and promote reforms will bring about new momentum and vitality and offer new place for economic growth , said Xi .
the management group has adopted a series of guidelines , including a list of neg@@ atives for regul@@ ating market access , relaxation of border controls policies , promotion of state enterprises ( SO@@ E ) , private capital , and over@@ hau@@ l of the population @-@ reporting system .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the statement , a negative list is created , identifying sectors and companies that are not eligible for investment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the system is tested and tested by testing programs .
the initiative is of importance as it as@@ signs to the market a greater role in the allocation of resources , ensuring a legal office environment and designed the market more openly , said the statement .
the government will also ex@@ ert control over the powers that are transferred to the company and make sure that companies decide how to conduct their business .
the statement also said that China will allow border regions to explore new models of cross @-@ border economic co @-@ operation and new mechanisms to promote regional growth .
in the context of an offer to open state @-@ controlled sectors , further areas for private investment will be opened .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government will not change its policy towards foreign investments and will protect the legitimate interests of foreign @-@ funded businesses and provide better services for them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , it is easier for foreigners to apply for a permanent residence permit or the &quot; Green Card &quot; by optim@@ ising the requirements and facilit@@ ating the application process .
the right of attor@@ neys to guarantee their activity , and deplo@@ y professional judges and prosec@@ ut@@ ors , was also discussed at a meeting .
the meeting also included Prime Minister Li Ke@@ qi@@ ang and important leaders such as Li@@ u Yun@@ shan and Z@@ hang Ga@@ oli , as reported in a declaration published after the meeting .
EU wants to double mercury mar@@ ginal value in pre@@ dat@@ ory fish
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the European Commission wants to double the limit values of mercury in large pre@@ dat@@ ory fish and thus allow consumers to take a significantly higher dose of the nerve . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the consumer organisation F@@ ood@@ watch , which is a corresponding working paper of the EU , crit@@ ici@@ zed the plans sharp@@ ly : &quot; risks and side effects of the failed industrial and environmental policy are passed on with full force of pregnant and inf@@ ants , &quot; said Matthias Wolf@@ sch@@ midt of F@@ ood@@ watch .
according to Wolf@@ sch@@ midt , the limit values of the nerve po@@ ison for large fish are to be raised from one to two milli@@ grams of mercury per kil@@ ogram of fish at the end of the food chain , such as shar@@ ks or s@@ wor@@ d@@ fish .
big pre@@ dat@@ ors , however , are already so heavily bur@@ dened with mercury , that around 50 per cent of the cat@@ ches are not allowed to be sold based on the still valid limit values .
after dou@@ bling the limit values , only 14.5 percent would be irre@@ voc@@ able .
according to F@@ ood@@ watch , the EU wants to tigh@@ ten the limit values for other fish from currently 0.5 milli@@ grams to 0.1 milli@@ grams of mercury per kil@@ ogram according to F@@ ood@@ watch .
but F@@ ood@@ watch described this as a &quot; trick &quot; because smaller c@@ emet@@ eries , such as car@@ p , are usually so low , that they already hold the planned maximum values already today .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the subsi@@ dence at Kl@@ einf@@ isch is therefore &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a per@@ fi@@ dy distr@@ action man@@ oeu@@ vre &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which helps the economy alone , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained Wolf@@ sch@@ midt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
mercury is a heavy metal that is highly toxic for humans , which is particularly rich in pre@@ dat@@ ory fish over the food chain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Federal Government therefore war@@ ns that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; small amounts can already cause particularly in the un@@ born damage of the nervous system . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Federal Environment Ministry states on its homepage with regard to the current maximum values , however , that a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; health haz@@ ard of the general population &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is not to be expected . &quot; &quot; &quot;
mercury finds its way through coal combustion into the environment .
according to a written information from the Federal Environment Ministry , the German coal @-@ fired power plants b@@ out more than six tons of mercury per year , two thirds of the total quantity of Germany em@@ itted in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the concentration of mercury in fish such as the Elbe , Rhine and Danube is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; permanently and nation@@ wide exceeded , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Spiegel &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; had c@@ ited from paper in March . &quot; &quot; &quot;
last year Europe @-@ wide war@@ nings against mercury in fish have already been among the most common health risks in the EU warning system RA@@ S@@ FF .
