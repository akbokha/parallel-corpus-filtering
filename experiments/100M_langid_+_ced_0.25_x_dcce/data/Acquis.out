&quot; a ) In the implementation of securing measures according to this agreement , the technological development in the field of securing measures is fully charged and all efforts are made to ensure the optimum cost effectiveness and the application of the principle of effective securing monitoring of the flow of core material , which after this agreement is subject to certain strategic points , as far as the current or future technology is enabled . &quot;
&quot; B ) To ensure optimum cost effectiveness , for example , the following procedures are applied : I ) spatial f@@ ing@@ ering as a means for determining the material balance zones for accounting purposes ; &quot;
&quot; III ) Con@@ centr@@ ation of the verification procedure to the phases of the fuel cycle , which may affect the production , processing , use and storage of core material , from which without further nuclear weapons and other core explo@@ sives might be produced , and that this does not interfere with the implementation of this convention . &quot;
&quot; a ) To effectively carry out the security measures in accordance with this Convention , the Community of the Organization appro@@ ves information on core material that is subject to securing measures , and on the characteristics of the equipment necessary for carrying out hed@@ ging measures regarding this material of Bel@@ ang . &quot;
B ) i ) The organisation requires only the minimum of information and data which is compatible with the implementation of its tasks according to the agreement .
&quot; II ) Information on equipment shall be limited to the minimum , which is necessary for the use of hed@@ ging measures in relation to core material that is subject to the securing measures under this agreement . &quot;
&quot; C ) In the search of the community , the organization is ready to evaluate investment data , which considers the community as particularly vulnerable to check in the premises of the community . &quot;
&quot; this data does not need to be transferred materi@@ ally to the organization , provided that they remain accessible for further examination by the organization in the premises of the community . &quot;
a ) i ) The organisation pic@@ ks up the approval of the Community and states to the nam@@ ing of inspec@@ tors for the states .
&quot; II ) To raise the community either against a proposed designation , or at any time against a given designation , the organisation of the Community and the states suggests one or more alternative names . &quot;
&quot; in accordance with the repeated refusal of the Community to agree to the appointment of inspec@@ tors of the organization , which is imp@@ eded by this convention , the Council will discuss the refusal to discuss the appropriate measure with the aim of making appropriate measures . &quot;
&quot; B ) The Community and the countries concerned do take the necessary steps to ensure that the inspec@@ tors of the organisation , which can actually carry out the tasks according to their agreement , are in fact compl@@ ained . &quot;
( C ) The visits and activities of the inspec@@ tors of the organization are set in such a way that i ) the possible har@@ ass@@ ment and distur@@ b@@ ance for the community and the states and for the peaceful nuclear activities underlying peaceful nuclear activities are as low as possible ;
II ) the protection of industrial secrets and other inspec@@ tors of the organization for knowledge of familiar confidential information is ensured .
&quot; every state applies to the organization , including its assets , funds and assets , as well as to their inspec@@ tors and other officials , the tasks according to this agreement , the corresponding provisions of the agreement on the prer@@ og@@ atives and liber@@ ations of the International Atom@@ ic Energy Organisation . &quot;
&quot; the securing measures in accordance with this agreement are termin@@ ated with regard to core material when the community and the organization realize that the material is consumed or dil@@ uted in a way that it is no longer use@@ able , or practically non @-@ re@@ cover@@ able . &quot;
&quot; according to this Convention , the Community noti@@ fies the disclosure of core material from the states that is subject to the securing measures under this agreement . &quot;
&quot; the securing measures according to this agreement will be termin@@ ated with regard to core material as soon as the recipient state , as planned in this agreement , has taken over responsibility . &quot;
&quot; the organization performs documentation , from which every passing on and if necessary , the re@@ use of the backup measures on the given core material . &quot;
&quot; core material , which is subject to the securing measures according to this agreement , should be used in non @-@ nuclear activities , such as the manufacture of alloys or ceramics , thus agre@@ es to the organization of such use of the material under which circumstances the securing measures can be termin@@ ated in relation to this material . &quot;
II ) that the material used during the duration of the non @-@ application of the hed@@ ging measures in accordance with this agreement is not used for the production of nuclear weapons and other core explo@@ sives .
&quot; B ) The organisation and the community shall ensure that the hed@@ ging measures fores@@ een in this Convention will not be applied for so long , when the core material is used in such activity . &quot;
&quot; as far as possible , the regulation will be defined as long and under what circumstances these security measures are not applied . &quot;
&quot; in any case , the backup measures en@@ vis@@ aged in this Convention will once again be applied once the core material is returned to a peaceful nuclear activity . &quot;
the organization is held on the ongoing basis of the total amount and the composition of the material contained in the respective state or the states concerned and on any transmission of such material from this state or these states .
&quot; this explains its consent as quickly as possible ; it only covers matters such as temporary and proced@@ ural rules and agreements for reporting , but does not include a endor@@ sement or under secret security , and does not involve the following use of the core material . &quot;
&quot; the organization , the community and the states bear the costs that each of them grow in the implementation of their respective obligations under this agreement . &quot;
&quot; the association , the states or persons who are subject to their sovereignty , however ex@@ propri@@ ated extraordinary costs as a result of a special effort of the organization , the organisation ref@@ unded this cost , provided that it has settled in advance in advance . &quot;
&quot; in any case , the organisation contributes to the costs of all additional measurements and samples required by the inspec@@ tors of the organization . &quot;
&quot; the Community and the States ensure that liability for nuclear damages , including insurance or other financial security , may be used in accordance with their laws and other regulations , to the organization and their officials for the purposes of carrying out this convention in the same way as to the nation@@ als of the states . &quot;
any claim to asser@@ t the community or state vis @-@ à @-@ vis the organization or the organization against the Community or the State for damages - except for damages arising from a nuclear incident which arose from the implementation of the hed@@ ging measures under this agreement will be governed in accordance with international law .
&quot; after examining the relevant information submitted by the General Manager , the Council shall ensure that no nuclear material , which must be subject to security measures for nuclear weapons or other core explosive devices , can be reimbur@@ sed in Article X@@ II Par@@ agra@@ ph C of the Stat@@ utes and possibly take the other measures provided there . &quot;
&quot; such steps take into account the Council , in which mass was acquired by the applied safety measures , and offers the community or the state - as far as each one of the two parties is concerned - every reasonable opportunity to give the Council the necessary security . &quot;
&quot; on request of the organization , the community or of a state , consult@@ ations on questions arise that arise from the interpretation or application of this convention . &quot;
&quot; the Community and the States are entitled to seek out that any questions arising from the interpretation or application of this convention , must be examined by the Council . &quot;
the Council invites the community and the affected state to participate in the discussion of such questions through the Council .
&quot; with the exception of any dispute referred to pursuant to Article 19 or any of the measures adopted by the Council , there are disputes arising from the interpretation or application of this convention , which shall not be submitted in the negotiation process or by a different from the organization , the community and the states , which consists of five arbitr@@ ators . &quot;
&quot; the community and the states design@@ ate two arbitr@@ ators , the organisation also identifies two arbitr@@ ators , and the four arbitr@@ ators choose a fifth , which leads the pres@@ idency . &quot;
&quot; if the Community and the States or the Organization are not entitled to an arbitr@@ ary two arbitr@@ ators , the Community or the Organization may request the President of the International Court of Justice to ap@@ point these arbitr@@ ators . &quot;
&quot; the same procedure applies , if within thirty days after the appointment or appointment of the fourth arbitr@@ ator , the fifth arbitr@@ ator has not yet been selected . &quot;
&quot; a majority of the members of the Ar@@ bit@@ ral Tribunal shall be competent , and all decisions require the approval of at least three arbitr@@ ators . &quot;
&quot; the decisions of the arbit@@ ration court are binding for the organization , the community and the countries concerned . &quot;
&quot; ( a ) This Convention applies to non @-@ nuclear weapons , the contracting party of the contract and become members of the Community ( in force , i ) if the relevant state of the organisation notes that its procedures are concluded for the entry into force of this convention . &quot;
( II ) if the Community of the Organization noti@@ fies that it is able to apply their security measures in relation to this state for the purposes of this convention .
&quot; a ) The organisation , the community and the states consult each other on request of one of the contracting parties about a change of this agreement . &quot;
&quot; B ) All changes require the consent of the Organization , the Community and the States . &quot;
&quot; C ) The Director General inform@@ s all Member States of the organization , regardless of any change of this agreement . &quot;
&quot; a ) This Convention applies to the day in force , in which the organisation of the Community and the States receives the written notification , that its procedures are concluded for entry into force . &quot;
B ) This agreement remains in force as long as the States are contracting parties .
&quot; the term &quot; &quot; Convention &quot; &quot; used in this agreement means the agreement and the protocol . &quot;
the purpose of this part of the Convention is to determine the procedures necessary to carry out the provisions of part I on securing measures as required .
the aim of the procedures laid out in this Convention is the timely discovery of the turno@@ ff significant amounts of core material of peaceful nuclear activities for the manufacture of nuclear weapons and other core explosive devices for unknown purposes as well as det@@ err@@ ence from such a track through the risk of early discovery .
&quot; for submission of the target specified in article 28 , the material accounting is used as a securing measure of fundamental importance , verb@@ ati@@ m with the spatial intervention and observation as important supplementary measures . &quot;
&quot; the technical termin@@ ology of the inspec@@ tions by the organization is carried out by an explanation , in which the material quantity for each material balance is not specified for a certain period of time , indicating the accuracy of accuracy for the specified locations . &quot;
&quot; in carrying out their inspec@@ tions , the organisation continues after article 3 full use of the securing system of the community . &quot;
the accounting and control system of the Community for Nuclear Material in accordance with this agreement is based on a breakdown in material balance zones .
&quot; in the application of their security measures , the community of de procedures and measures will make use of the following manner and they , as far as necessary , will see how they are defined in the supplementary agreements and are useful : &quot;
&quot; a ) a measurement system for the determination of the quantities of preserved , produced , lost , lost , lost , or in any other way from the stock of the core material and stocks ; &quot;
B ) the assessment of re@@ produ@@ ci@@ bility and accuracy of measurements and assessment of uncertainty ;
&quot; C ) procedures for determining , testing and evaluating differences in the measurements of sender and recipient ; &quot;
e ) Proced@@ ure to evaluate accumulation of non @-@ measured invent@@ ories and not measured losses ;
&quot; F ) a protocol and reporting system , which has the core material for each material balance and the changes in this inventory , including the inputs and outputs of the material balance zone ; &quot;
precau@@ tions to ensure that the booking procedures and agreements are done correctly ;
h ) Proced@@ ures for the reimbur@@ sement of reports to the organization in accordance with the articles 59 to 65 and 67 to 69 .
the securing measures according to this agreement do not extend to material in mining or ore processing .
&quot; B ) becomes ur@@ an - or th@@ ori@@ um@@ ented material , which the phase of the nucle@@ us cycle described under the letter c ) has not yet reached the states , so the organization of the organisation shares the quantity and composition of the material , unless it is introduced to specific non @-@ nuclear purposes ; &quot;
&quot; C ) relies on core material , which is suitable for the composition and purity of fuel production or the is@@ ot@@ ope enrich@@ ment , the plant or the process phase in which it is produced or is imported into the states in a later phase of the core flame cycle , so it is subject to the other hed@@ ging measures mentioned in this agreement . &quot;
&quot; a ) The security measures fores@@ een in this Convention shall be concluded for core material under the conditions mentioned in Article 11 . if the conditions mentioned in Article 11 are not subject to this agreement , the organisation and the community consult each other via the use of appropriate security measures . &quot;
&quot; B ) The securing measures fores@@ een in this Convention shall be termin@@ ated for core material under the conditions mentioned in Article 13 , insofar as the organization and the community establish that this core material is practically non @-@ re@@ cover@@ able . &quot;
&quot; in the search of the community , the organization fre@@ es the following core material from the securing measures according to this agreement : &quot;
a ) special fis@@ sile material when it is used in gram@@ mes or smaller amounts as a sensor in instruments ;
&quot; ( B ) Nuclear Material , if it is used in non @-@ nuclear activities after article 13 , if such core material is re@@ cover@@ able , and &quot;
&quot; C ) Pl@@ ut@@ oni@@ um with an Is@@ ot@@ ope concentration of pl@@ ut@@ oni@@ um @-@ 238 , which is above 80 % . &quot;
&quot; on request of the community , the Organisation fre@@ es the core material that would otherwise be subject to securing measures under this agreement , provided that the total amount of material liber@@ ated in the states amounts to no more time than the whole , due to this article in the states . &quot;
a ) a total of one kil@@ ogram of special p@@ alt@@ able material that can consist of one or more of the following materials :
&quot; II ) ur@@ anium with an enrich@@ ment of 0.2 ( 20 % ) and above , calculated by multip@@ lication of its weight with enrich@@ ment , &quot;
III ) Ur@@ an with an enrich@@ ment that lies under 0.2 ( 20 % ) and above the natural ur@@ anium calcul@@ ates due to multip@@ lication of its weight with the five @-@ fold square of enrich@@ ment ;
&quot; a total of ten metric tons of natural ur@@ anium and de@@ pl@@ eted ur@@ anium with enrich@@ ment of more than 0,@@ 005 ( 0.5 % ) ; &quot;
&quot; C ) twenty metric tons of de@@ pl@@ eted ur@@ anium with an enrich@@ ment of 0,@@ 005 ( 0.5 % ) or below ; &quot;
&quot; the liber@@ ated core material together with core material , which is subject to the securing measures under this agreement , shall be processed or stored , so precau@@ tions for the re@@ use of the securing measures on that material are met . &quot;
&quot; the community meets with the organization supplementary agreements , which is required in the scope , which is necessary for the successful and effective implementation of the tasks of the organization according to this agreement , in particular how the procedures specified in the Convention are applicable . &quot;
supplementary agreements can be extended or changed without modification of this agreement in agreement between the organization and the community .
&quot; the supplementary agreements occur simultaneously with or as soon as possible after the entry into force of this convention . the organisation , the community and the states undertake all efforts to force these agreements within nin@@ ety days after the entry into force of this Convention ; an extension of this period requires the agreement between the organization , the community and the states . &quot;
&quot; on the basis of the initial report published in Article 62 , the organization provides a summar@@ ized inventory list of the entire core material underlying this Convention , regardless of its origin , and continues to carry on this inventory list based on the subsequent reports and the results of their investigations . &quot;
&quot; between the European Economic Community ( E@@ EC ) and its Member States Belgium , Denmark , Federal Republic of Germany , France , Ireland , Italy , Luxembourg , Netherlands , United Kingdom ( Member States ) on the one hand and the International Development Organisation ( Organization ) &quot;
&quot; the E@@ EC has decided to contribute to the special action programme specified at the Conference for International Economic Cooperation in order to help meet the immediate needs of individual countries with low income , whose development is ham@@ pered by general rehabilitation problems . &quot;
&quot; C ) It is the objective of the E@@ EC and Member States that the entire contribution is bound by the Member States within six months after the entry into force of the agreement , and as far as possible within two years after entry into force in the form of loans , and the organization will do its utmost to achieve this goal . &quot;
D ) The E@@ EC and the Organisation have consul@@ ted each other about the proposed implementation and management of this agreement and the middle bonds to ensure a broad and balanced geographical distribution within the framework of this agreement .
&quot; to this end , the E@@ EC Organization has presented a table that is evident in what way it intends to apply the criteria specified in this agreement - &quot;
&quot; the organization establishes a special discount under the name &quot; &quot; special transaction account &quot; , &quot; which consists of the funds provided by the Member States in accordance with this Agreement on the Special Action Account ; this account is referred to as &quot; &quot; ste@@ ward &quot; &quot; by the organization ( in this property ) , and in accordance with the provisions of this agreement . &quot;
the special transaction account is listed separately and separated from all other accounts and assets of the organization .
&quot; the contributions must be paid as follows : a ) The payment shall be made in the form of cash or in@@ trin@@ sic debt of the member state , which must pay upon request in the currency of the respective state to order the organization as the administrator of the special transaction , and to deposit at the rear @-@ place of the organization in the country concerned . &quot;
B ) The payment is made in two install@@ ments ( i ) the first in the amount of at least 45 v . h . the order within 30 days after entry into force of this agreement or another between the E@@ EC and the administrative appointed time ;
&quot; II ) the second in the amount of the fee to 1 January 1979 , or at another time agreed between the E@@ EC and the administrator , taking into account the dead@@ lines required for parliamentary approval of the annual budget . &quot;
C ) E@@ ach Member State may wish to make payments before the above @-@ mentioned dates .
&quot; according to the usual procedures of the organization , the car@@ et@@ aker takes about proportional draw on the cash or the school dsch@@ one to cover the expenses for the off@@ ender and to compens@@ ate the special transaction account in an appropriate manner . &quot;
&quot; in terms of gran@@ ting these loans , the car@@ et@@ aker can be guided by the following factors in accordance with the conditions of the E@@ EC : &quot;
III ) the extent to which international economic factors contributed to the current and fores@@ ee@@ able economic problems of the country ;
( VI ) the composition and the tendency of the debt service of the country and its subsequent credit absorption capacity without compensation ; and
VII ) the extent to which the problems of the concerned countries can be regulated by contributions from other sources .
&quot; each special transaction serves to finance a clearly defined and rapidly pay@@ able development programme or project ( including a sec@@ toral project ) , regardless of whether it belongs to the organisation &apos;s loan program or not , according to the procedures and practices which are intended for the purpose of the organization financed by the organization , with the objective of this agreement to take into account . &quot;
&quot; the means of the special transaction may not be used in place of the International Bank for Rec@@ on@@ struction and Development ( Bank ) or the Organization , which have already been approved by the Bank or the Organization on the day of the entry into force of this agreement . &quot;
&quot; apart from Section 4 , special transactions are subject to the same return policy applicable to the organization granted by the organization ; they are thus ref@@ und@@ able in ten years of age in 50 years . &quot;
&quot; special transactions are granted in one or more currencies of the Member States , and are ref@@ und@@ able in these currencies . &quot;
amounts to pay for this watch are directly to the organization that re@@ tains it .
&quot; each special transaction is determined by a separate loan agreement between the recipient country and the administrator , in which the origin of the funds is stated in particular . &quot;
&quot; the income from each special transaction can be used for expenses in the currency of the recipient country , or for goods or services that are established or provided . &quot;
&quot; capital rep@@ ay@@ ments of special transactions take place on the special transaction account , and the amount with@@ drawn in the currency of a member state shall be transferred back to the Member State after his receipt as soon as possible . &quot;
the bai@@ li@@ ff instruc@@ ts the E@@ EC on the plans and programmes approved by the directors in preparation for the complete surrender of all special transactions .
&quot; during the time of the withdrawal of the Special Operations loan , the car@@ et@@ aker instruc@@ ts the EE@@ A quar@@ terly on the development of the special transactions loans and the expenses paid for this . &quot;
the car@@ et@@ aker transm@@ its the E@@ EC as soon as possible after the financial year of the organisation an extensive b@@ illing of the special transaction account with an opinion of the external audi@@ tor of the organization to this account conclusion .
&quot; after full withdrawal of the Special Operations loan , the E@@ EC ste@@ wards as soon as possible a detailed report on the plans and programs financed by the special transaction account . &quot;
&quot; the administrator creates and exec@@ utes suitable records and invo@@ ices , from which the contributions to the special transaction account , which account for the account received from the account and the amounts paid out of the account and the payments to the Member States are evident . &quot;
the E@@ EC and the car@@ et@@ aker work closely together to achieve the objectives of this agreement .
&quot; to this end , the E@@ EC ( represented by the Commission of the European Communities ) and the car@@ et@@ aker up to the full edition of the special action account from time to time , carry out an exchange of ideas about the state of the special transaction , the progress of programmes financed by special transactions , and on all other questions concerning the provisions of this agreement . &quot;
&quot; this agreement on 31 December 1978 , or at a later date , which the E@@ EC and the organisation possibly agree , did not enter into force , the agreement and all the resulting obligations of the parties with immediate effect are due . &quot;
&quot; in accordance with Article II Section 8 of this agreement , the total amount of capital paid by the recipients in accordance with Article II paragraph 8 of this Agreement shall be returned to the Member States , so this agreement and all the resulting obligations of the parties shall be termin@@ ated with immediate effect . &quot;
this agreement requires approval by the Member States and the E@@ EC in accordance with the proced@@ ural rules of each party .
the governments of the Member States noti@@ fies the General Sec@@ retariat of the Council of the European Communities the conclusion of the proceedings concerned .
the Secretary General manages these noti@@ fications together with a Noti@@ fication on the proper approval of this agreement by the E@@ EC to the Organisation .
&quot; this agreement is effective and effective on the first day of the month , which follows the day of receipt of the mentioned noti@@ fications in the organisation . &quot;
&quot; this agreement is written in two scrip@@ tions in Danish , German , English , French , Italian and Dutch , whereby each word is equally binding . &quot;
considering that the agreement in the form of a change to change the Anne@@ x A of the Protocol No. 1 to the agreement between the European Economic Community and the Swiss Con@@ federation ( 1 ) is to be concluded - H@@ AT F@@ OL@@ GEN@@ DE VER@@ OR@@ DER issued :
between the European Atom@@ ic Energy Community and the Swiss Con@@ federation in the field of controlled nuclear fusion and plas@@ map@@ hy@@ si@@ k
&quot; the EURO@@ PE@@ AN Atom@@ ic Energy Community , herein@@ after called &quot; Eur@@ atom , &quot; represented by the Commission of the European Communities , herein@@ after referred to as &quot; Commission , &quot; &quot;
&quot; and DIE SCH@@ WEI@@ Z@@ ER@@ IS@@ CHE Eid@@ genossen@@ schaft , herein@@ after referred to as &quot; Switzerland , &quot; represented by the Swiss Federal Council , herein@@ after referred to as the Federal Council , &quot;
&quot; this program includes the creation of a large experimental plant , the project J@@ ET ( Joint European Tor@@ us ) , whose construction and operation of a common company named after Chapter V of the Eur@@ atom treaty - herein@@ after called &quot; &quot; Common Enterprise J@@ ET &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; for several years , Switzerland has been concerned with research in the area of controlled nuclear fusion and plasma hy@@ si@@ cs and is well acquainted with the area concerned . &quot;
&quot; as up to the practical use of the controlled nuclear fusion still carry out extensive work , it is in the interests of the contract parties of the present agreement to summar@@ ize their respective efforts to avoid unnecessary over@@ laps and to accelerate their respective research , which have attained a higher priority level due to the energy crisis . &quot;
&quot; this agreement will enable each contracting party to be able to benefit from a consolidation of their research efforts in the field of controlled nuclear fusion and plasma hy@@ si@@ cs from the funds provided for mutual research work , to avoid unnecessary over@@ laps and consequently the joint objective of this research work , i.e. the cost @-@ moder@@ ately competitive power generation by using the controlled nuclear fusion reaction . &quot;
&quot; to achieve the objective of this agreement , the contractual parties associate their respective research programmes defined in Anne@@ x I and II of this agreement , herein@@ after called &quot; Eur@@ atom program &quot; and &quot; Schweizer Programm . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in order to ensure effective cooperation , the Swiss programme takes over long @-@ term goals and forms of cooperation between the Eur@@ atom programme ; it will be extended or amended by the executive bodies mentioned in Article 5 to 10 and Article 16 of the present Agreement , which may include new activities relevant to the Eur@@ atom programme . &quot;
&quot; each time the parties accept a new program , it occurs in the place of the programs mentioned in Anne@@ x I and II to the present Agreement . &quot;
the association en@@ vis@@ aged in paragraph 1 is realized by : - appropriate participation of each of the contracting parties during preparation and execution of the programs of the other party ;
&quot; - Exchange of personnel under the relevant laboratories in the Eur@@ atom member states , in Switzerland and in third countries with which Eur@@ atom concluded a similar agreement as the present agreement , herein@@ after called &quot; associated third states , &quot; as well as the laboratories that work on the Eur@@ atom programme ; &quot;
- Right to access to the scientific and technical results of the respective programs .
&quot; as part of the objective of the current agreement , Switzerland is participating in the J@@ ET project . &quot;
&quot; with regard to the implementation of the association en@@ vis@@ aged in Article 2 , 1 of this agreement , the parties conclude an association agreement , herein@@ after called &quot; Association Agreement , &quot; which is as far as possible to those established between the Commission and the States and companies or persons , herein@@ after referred to as &quot; Associ@@ ated organs , &quot; with regard to the implementation of the Eur@@ atom programme . &quot;
&quot; with the same objective , Eur@@ atom is concerned that Switzerland is involved with the time of the entry into force of the present agreement on the promotion of human resource exchange , which is concluded between the Commission and the Associ@@ ated Organ@@ s , herein@@ after called &quot; Agreement on Human Resources . &quot; &quot;
&quot; with regard to the participation in the J@@ ET project , Switzerland belongs to the Common Market J@@ ET with the date of the entry into force of the present Agreement . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Eur@@ atom is concerned that Switzerland may become a contractual partner of any contract whose purpose is to be concluded within the framework of the present agreement , except associations agreements or other similar contracts concluded by Eur@@ atom during the validity period of the present agreement . &quot;
&quot; the organs , which are commissioned with the implementation of the association en@@ vis@@ aged in Article 2 of the present Agreement , are described in Article 5 to 10 of this agreement and in the association agreement . &quot;
&quot; the association agreement , in particular , involves setting up a steering committee , which includes the competent representative of the Commission and the Bundes@@ rat . &quot;
&quot; - to monitor and guide the development of the research work , to ensure that the best possible results will be achieved in accordance with the objectives of this agreement . &quot;
&quot; Switzerland is represented by a maximum of two delegates in the connection group used within the framework of the Eur@@ atom programme - in the following &quot; &quot; VG &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the VG , which has to guarantee the exchange of information and cooperation in all questions related to ongoing or planned programmes and activities in the area of the Eur@@ atom programme , is responsible for all research and development activities on which this agreement relates . &quot;
&quot; in particular , it promotes cooperation and coordination between the affiliated bodies and direc@@ ts its T * activity in the interests of the two contractual parties to the common objective specified in the Eur@@ atom programme and in Article 1 of the present agreement , taking into account the scientific and technological developments in the world . &quot;
&quot; according to its Rules of Proced@@ ure , the VG will ap@@ point one or more Swiss representatives in the advisory groups created within the framework of the Eur@@ atom programme whenever the relevant Swiss authorities are seeking . &quot;
&quot; the couns@@ elling groups , which grant the VG research proposals for the best possible scientific results for the Eur@@ atom programme , take this task with regard to all research and development work , which is referred to in this agreement . &quot;
&quot; in the course of the Eur@@ atom programme , Switzerland is represented by the director of one of the participating laboratories . &quot;
&quot; the committee of directors to monitor the implementation of the Eur@@ atom programme and which is responsible for making optimal use of the capacities of the laboratories carried out at the work carried out within the program , will develop this task with regard to all research and development work , which fall under the present agreement . &quot;
&quot; in particular , it provides for the best possible use of the personnel and for the exchange between the laboratories involved in the implementation of the Eur@@ atom programme and the Swiss program . &quot;
a Swiss representative shall be entitled to participate in the meetings of all coordin@@ ating committees as part of the Eur@@ atom programme .
&quot; the coordination committees , which are appropriate to the committee of directors for the best possible use of the means , personnel , and knowledge and skills , on which the laboratories involved in the implementation of the Eur@@ atom programme are subject to the respective field of research and development work , which fall under the present agreement . &quot;
&quot; the BA@@ F includes a responsible representative of each Member State of Eur@@ atom , Switzerland and any associated third @-@ country member state . &quot;
&quot; on request of the Commission , the BA@@ F advis@@ es the Commission with regard to the implementation of the programme and the possible changes in the exec@@ utions as well as in preparing future programmes and defining its overall scope , coordination and integration of national activities at the joint level in the field of merger . &quot;
&quot; the statements of the BA@@ F , the VG , the Gover@@ ning Committee , the Advisory Groups and the Co@@ ordination Committ@@ ees have an advisory character . &quot;
the statement by the VG to the urgent actions is compulsory ; the same applies to the committee of directors in the field of personnel exchange .
the representatives of the two parties act on the work of all technical advisory committees or all administrative bodies created for the purposes of the present agreement .
&quot; according to this agreement , Switzerland &apos;s financial contribution to the Eur@@ atom programme is determined annually on an amount determined by Eur@@ atom &apos;s gross domestic product in the same proportion as the gross domestic product of Eur@@ atom and Switzerland last year . &quot;
&quot; regarding the J@@ ET project , this financial contribution refers to the participation of Eur@@ atom at the Common Market as soon as this is established . &quot;
&quot; moreover , Switzerland over@@ comes the Common Market J@@ ET , which is determined according to the financial provisions of the stat@@ ute of this Common Market . &quot;
&quot; the financial contribution to the Eur@@ atom to finance the work within the association agreement and the agreement on personnel exchange is calculated on the same basis , which is normally used to calculate the Eur@@ atom contributions to finance the work carried out based on the corresponding contracts . &quot;
&quot; the Commission shares the Federal Council at the beginning of the year , which amount to cover expenses within the framework of the Eur@@ atom programme for the year concerned . &quot;

&quot; the agreement could be concluded up to the total amount of fee paid by the credi@@ tor country , within a total limit of 2,7@@ 25 billion b@@ illing units ; this corresponds to 50 % of all future delivery units of the member countries . &quot;
&quot; now , however , some conditions are mentioned below , to which the BI@@ Z would be ready . &quot;
&quot; in every stand@@ by credit , the BI@@ Z would initially take over an obligation for two years , with the possibility of extensions continu@@ ances without a total of five years . &quot;
&quot; in the opening of the loans , as well as with their respective extension , the BIS would charge a loan opening . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it would be agreed that the first draw will not be made before the end of a month after the stand@@ by agreement , so that the Bank can make the necessary adjustments for its own liqui@@ dity . &quot;
&quot; the bre@@ aches would take place in the currencies available by the BI@@ Z , most likely in US dollars ; they would extend to periods which would be taking into account the funds of the Bank , presum@@ ably three or six months . &quot;

&quot; in view of this , that Article 27 of the Convention concerning changes has not yet entered into force - I &quot;
1 . agree to cancel the provision of Article 1 ( 2 b ) i@@ v ) of the Convention ;
2 . recognize that the postpon@@ ement of application of this Convention will be inadequate for developing countries by five years under Article 21 paragraph 1 in practice for some developing countries .
&quot; in such cases , a developing country , the contracting party , may apply for an extension of this period before the exp@@ ir@@ ation of the deadline stated in Article 21 ( paragraph 1 ) that the parties may submit such a request in cases where the development land can offer good reasons , ben@@ evol@@ ent . &quot;

in the form of a change between the European Economic Community and the Argent@@ inian Republic on trade with H@@ amm@@ el and lamb
&quot; I honor the recent negotiations between our deleg@@ ations to define provisions on imports of H@@ amm@@ el - , lamb and goat meat from Argentina into the European Economic Community in connection with the application of the common market organisation for sheep and goat meat through the community . &quot;
&quot; - fresh or cooled H@@ amm@@ el - , lamb - and goat meat ( 02.0@@ 1 A IV a ) ) ; &quot;
&quot; as part of this agreement , the export possibilities for H@@ amm@@ el - , lamb and goat meat from Argentina will be set to the following annual amount : 20 000 tons , expressed in s@@ laugh@@ ter@@ weight ( 1 ) . &quot;
&quot; in order to ensure imp@@ ec@@ cable functioning of the agreement , Argentina is obliged to ensure that the annual quantity does not exceed the agreed amount and executed in accordance with conventional offer ( frozen or ch@@ illed ) . &quot;
&quot; should a change in the form of offer be possible as a result of changes in the technology and trade , the two parties of this Agreement shall consult each other before the introduction of such a change in the committee mentioned under number 10 to find an appropriate solution . &quot;
&quot; in the event that the Community demands protection clause , it is obliged to bear in mind that the access to Argentina &apos;s access to the community market is not affected . &quot;
&quot; in the event that the imports from Argentina exceed the agreed quantities in one year , the Community reserves the right to susp@@ end imports from Argentina for the remain@@ der of the year concerned . &quot;
the community comm@@ its itself to limit the exhaus@@ tion on imports of goods collected by this agreement to a court set of 10 BC . ad val@@ or@@ em .
&quot; when entering new Member States , the Community in consultation with Argentina changes the amount of the Argent@@ ine@@ an trade with each new Member State . &quot;
&quot; in accordance with the provisions of the Treaty of Acc@@ ession , the import charges for these new Member States shall be taken into account in accordance with the provisions of the Treaty of Acc@@ ession ; here@@ under shall be invo@@ iced under the number 5 &quot; &quot; Ho@@ ech@@ st@@ erium of Ex@@ haus@@ tion &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the total amount mentioned under number 2 is fixed on the day of the accession of Greece to the Community , to 23 000 tons of batt@@ le@@ weight . &quot;
&quot; the community under@@ takes everything to avoid market development , which could affect the marketing of Argent@@ ine@@ an H@@ amm@@ el - and lamb di@@ ligence on the common market within the agreed quantities . &quot;
&quot; in particular , the community meets precau@@ tions in order to prevent the sales of frozen meat from frozen meat due to the implementation of the regulation the paragraph of argent@@ inian h@@ amm@@ el - and lamb meat . &quot;
&quot; taking into account the objectives and provisions of this agreement , the Community agre@@ es that any actual application of funds or other subsidies for the export of H@@ amm@@ el - and lamb meat , as well as the slaughter of certain living sheep and lam@@ bs will be carried out only at prices and conditions that comply with the existing international obligations and take into account the traditional share of the community in world trade with these products . &quot;

&quot; with an agreement between the European Economic Community and New Zealand about trade with H@@ amm@@ el - , lamb and goat meat &quot;
&quot; I honor the negotiations between our two deleg@@ ations to define provisions on imports of H@@ amm@@ el - , lamb and goat meat from New Zealand to the Community in conjunction with the application of the regulation on a common market organisation for H@@ amm@@ el - , lamb and goat meat . &quot;
&quot; in recognition of the fact that the sheep @-@ economy and the export of H@@ amm@@ el - and lamb meat according to the world market and especially after the community for the New Zealand economy is exist@@ ential and that it is not necessary to ensure that the normal sales of New Zealand h@@ amm@@ el - and lamb meat are not affected in these markets , I honour the following agreement : &quot;
&quot; the agreement applies to : - fresh or cooled H@@ amm@@ el - , lamb and goat meat ( 02.0@@ 1 A IV a ) ) ; &quot;
&quot; according to this agreement , New Zealand is assured for H@@ amm@@ el - , lamb and goat meat of access to the market of the community in the altitude specified in the agreement . &quot;
new Zealand ob@@ tains the assurance that the normal sales of its H@@ amm@@ el - and lamb di@@ ligence is not affected by the application of the regulation .
&quot; in order to ensure imp@@ ec@@ cable functioning of the agreement , New Zealand is obliged to ensure that the quantity demanded in fact exceeds the set amount . &quot;
the pre @-@ established quantities are carried out in common forms ( frozen or ch@@ illed ) .
the community ass@@ ures that New Zealand should not be prevented with this agreement to use new technological developments or to maintain its competitive position on the market of the community .
&quot; should a change in the form form be made possible as a result of changes in technology and trade , the two parties consult each other before the introduction of such a change in the committee mentioned in clause 10 to find an appropriate solution . &quot;
&quot; in the event that the Community demands protection clause , it is obliged to protect the interests of New Zealand &apos;s interests arising from this agreement . &quot;
&quot; in the event that imports from New Zealand are exceeding the agreed quantities , the Community reserves the right to susp@@ end imports from that country . &quot;
the community comm@@ its itself to limit the exhaus@@ tion of imports of goods collected by this agreement to a court set of 10 BC . ad val@@ or@@ em .
&quot; during the accession of new Member States , the Community in consultation with New Zealand changes the quantities determined in clause 2 according to the extent of New Zealand trade with each new Member State . &quot;
&quot; in accordance with the provisions of the Treaty of Acc@@ ession , the import charges for these new Member States shall be taken into account in accordance with the provisions of the Treaty of Acc@@ ession ; in this case , the sum @-@ mentioned exchange rate of exhaus@@ tion is taken into account . &quot;
&quot; the total amount mentioned in clause 2 will be fixed on the day of Greece &apos;s accession to the Community , to 245 500 tons of batt@@ le@@ weight . &quot;
&quot; the community under@@ takes everything to avoid a market development , which could affect the normal sales of New Zealand H@@ amm@@ el - and lamb di@@ ligence on the common market within the agreed quantities . &quot;
&quot; in particular , the community meets provisions so that the paragraph of intervention stocks of frozen meat is not under@@ min@@ ed due to the implementation of the regulation of this objective . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the two contracting parties undertake everything to promote the consumption of creative workers in the community without danger for market stability . &quot;
&quot; taking into account the objectives and provisions of this agreement , the Community agre@@ es that any actual application of funds or other subsidies for the export of H@@ amm@@ el - and lamb meat and for slaughter given certain living sheep and lam@@ bs will be carried out only at prices and conditions that comply with the existing international obligations and take into account the traditional share of the community in world trade with these products . &quot;
&quot; new Zealand guarantees compliance with the quantities mentioned in clause 2 in particular , so that there are no export licenses beyond these quantities . &quot;
&quot; in turn , the Community is obliged to make all necessary arrangements for the issu@@ ance of import lic@@ ences for the a@@ forem@@ en@@ tioned products with origin in New Zealand , depending on the submission of a export license , given by the competent authorities designated by the New Zealand Government . &quot;
the details for the application of this system are determined in such a way that the position of a deposit for the issu@@ ance of import licence for the products of question@@ able goods can be avoided .
&quot; in terms of enforcement , the responsible office of the competent authorities of the competent authorities of the Community in regular intervals amounts the quantities for export licenses ; these details may be dec@@ ryp@@ ted to the destination country . &quot;
&quot; the committee is responsible for ensuring that the agreement will be properly applied , and will work smoothly . &quot;

&quot; the Committee shall ensure that the proper application of the agreement is not affected by the fact that products made of H@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat under the agreement will not be carried out under the agreement of the above mentioned tari@@ ff numbers . &quot;
&quot; the Committee shall discuss all questions arising from the implementation of the agreement , which are presented to him by a contracting party , and recommends appropriate solutions to the competent authorities . &quot;

&quot; this agreement will take effect on October 20 , 1980 . it is valid until 31 March 1984 . after that date , it remains in force , subject to the right of any contracting party to termin@@ ate it with a period of one year . in any case , the provisions of this Agreement shall be reviewed by two parties before the 1 . April 1984 with regard to changes that they consider necessary . &quot;

the contracting parties of the European Convention on 15 December 1958 on the exchange of therapeutic substances of human origin ( herein@@ after referred to as &quot; Convention &quot; ) -
&quot; based on article 5 ( 1 ) of the Convention , &quot; The Parties shall take all necessary measures , &quot; in order to free the therapeutic substances provided by the other parties at the disposal of all input sab@@ ot@@ ages ; &quot;
&quot; in consideration that for the Member States of the European Economic Community , the obligation to grant this release falls into the competence of the community , which has been established by the Treaty by which it has been established , which has the requ@@ is@@ ite powers to do so ; &quot;
&quot; considering that it is necessary for the implementation of Article 5 ( 1 ) of the Convention , that the European Economic Community can become a contracting party of the Convention - &quot;
the Convention will enter into force for the community on the first day of the month following the signature .
&quot; it occurs on the first day of the month in force , which follows the day when the last of the parties has depos@@ ited its acceptance certificate at the Secretary @-@ General of the Council of Europe . &quot;
&quot; ( 2 ) This supplementary protocol , however , occurs after two years after the date in force to which it was placed on the assumption , unless one of the contracting parties has notified a obj@@ ection to his entry into force . &quot;
&quot; from that point onwards , a state cannot become a contracting party of the Convention without becoming a contracting party of the Additional Protocol . &quot;
&quot; the Secretary @-@ General of the Council of Europe noti@@ fies the Member States of the Council of Europe , all States and the European Economic Community any assumption or obj@@ ection to Article 2 as well as the time of entry into force of this additional protocol according to Article 2 . &quot;
&quot; the Secretary @-@ General noti@@ fies the European Economic Community any action , notification or communication relating to this Convention . &quot;
&quot; considering that it is highly desirable , if the Member States should support each other in the spirit of European solidarity in the supply of re@@ agents to blood group determination , &quot;
&quot; whereas mutual support is only possible if the conditions and use of these re@@ agents to blood group identification are submitted jointly by the Member States , and the necessary arrangements and exceptions for their import are granted . &quot;
&quot; in the sense of this convention , the term &quot; re@@ agents for blood group determination &quot; means re@@ agents of human , animal , plant and other origin for blood type determination and determination of blood intoler@@ ances . &quot;
&quot; any contracting party may restrict the application of this convention on re@@ agents of human origin to blood group identification at the signing of this Convention , or in the back of its rati@@ fication , approval or membership certificate . &quot;
the declaration can be with@@ drawn at any time by an Noti@@ fication directed to the Secretary @-@ General of the Council of Europe .
&quot; the parties undertake to transfer re@@ agents to blood group determination against reimbur@@ sement of the costs of their extraction , preparation and transport as well as if necessary the purchase price of other contractual parties , which are urgently needed , provided that they themselves have sufficient supplies for their own need . &quot;
&quot; re@@ agents to blood group identification are provided by other contracting parties only under the condition that they are not linked to any profit , that they are only used for medical purposes and only be supplied by the governments involved . &quot;
each sending of re@@ agents to blood group determination is to be accompanied by a certificate that they were produced in accordance with the provisions of the protocol .
&quot; the protocol and its system represent an administrative agreement , which may be amended or supple@@ mented by the governments of the contracting parties . &quot;
the Parties shall take all necessary measures to free the re@@ agents available to them from other contracting parties to blood group identification from all input obligations .
they also meet all the necessary measures to ensure that these substances quickly and in the short@@ est way to obtain the recipients designated in Article 3 .
the contracting parties submit to each other via the Secretary @-@ General of the Council of Europe a list of positions provided for the exhibition of the Certi@@ fication en@@ vis@@ aged in Article 4 .
these positions should be identical with the positions designated in Article 6 of the European Convention on the exchange of therapeutic substances of human origin .
&quot; this Convention is for the members of the Council of Europe for signature ; they may become a contracting party by signing it ( a ) without reservation of rati@@ fication or approval , or &quot;
&quot; this agreement enters into force one month after the day , at which three members of the Council have signed it according to Article 7 without reservation of rati@@ fication or approval or have rati@@ fied or approved . &quot;
&quot; for any member , which is later signed or approved by the rati@@ fication or approval of this agreement , or rati@@ fied or approved , it will enter into force one month after its signature or cancellation of the rati@@ fication or approval certificate . &quot;
&quot; upon entry into force of this Convention , the minist@@ erial committee of the Council of Europe can invite any non @-@ member state to join the Convention . &quot;
the Secretary @-@ General of the Council of Europe noti@@ fies the members of the Council and the accompanying states ( a ) the time of entry into force of this Convention and the names of members that have signed or approved without reservation of rati@@ fication or approval ;
any contracting party may termin@@ ate this agreement with respect to a period of one year by advertisement to the Secretary @-@ General of the Council of Europe .
&quot; a re@@ agent for blood type determination must react with all tested blood samples which contain the an@@ tigen , which is hom@@ olog@@ ous to the antibody or another on the label . &quot;
&quot; if a re@@ agent is used in the manner recommended by the manufacturer , the following factors or phenomena do not occur : a ) hem@@ oly@@ tic properties ; &quot;
the ti@@ ter is measured by repeatedly th@@ inner di@@ lution of the re@@ agent on double in a suitable medium .
the ti@@ ter is the reci@@ pro@@ cal value of the number of the strongest ser@@ um di@@ lution in which a reaction occurs ; the di@@ lution is calculated exclusively to the volume of the blood cells in@@ let in the overall volume .
&quot; for anti @-@ A , anti @-@ B or other re@@ agents that are to be used on object carriers , activity is expressed by the time required for ag@@ glut@@ ination on an object carrier . &quot;
&quot; the World Health Organization has established International Standards for Anti @-@ A and Anti @-@ B as well as incomplete anti @-@ D re@@ agents , and for re@@ agents of other specific@@ ity are elabor@@ ated at the time standards . &quot;
&quot; according to the definition , an international standard preparation contains a certain number of international units per mg or ml , and this definition is independent of the ti@@ ters that are observed in single preparations of red blood cells ( 1 ) . &quot;
&quot; ( 1 ) The effectiveness of re@@ agents to blood group determination of most specific@@ ities is expressed as ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ation@@ sti@@ cker , which is observed in a series of di@@ lu@@ tions in a er@@ y@@ thro@@ cy@@ te sedi@@ ment . &quot;
the ti@@ ter gives the di@@ lution of the re@@ agent in the final mixture within a series where a micro@@ sc@@ opic visible ag@@ glut@@ ination occurs .
&quot; the effectiveness of re@@ agents for blood group determination , for the International Standard Prepar@@ ations ( currently anti @-@ A and anti @-@ B as well as a complete anti @-@ D ) , can be expressed on the basis of the ti@@ tr@@ ation of unknown agent in international units ( see Bulletin WHO O@@ MS 1954 , 10 , 9@@ 37 , 9@@ 41 - 1950 , 3 , 301 . ) . &quot;
&quot; if you bring them back to a volume of 1 ml , the Anti @-@ A and Anti @-@ B S@@ eren contain according to definition 256 International units per ml . &quot;
&quot; the preparations are available free of charge from the International Laboratory for biological norms of the World Health Organization , Stat@@ ens Ser@@ um Institute , Copenhagen . &quot;
the following table shows an example of a comparative study of the International Standard ser@@ um Anti @-@ A ( S ) and an &quot; unknown &quot; anti @-@ A re@@ agent ( U ) against red blood cells A1 and red blood cells A@@ 2B . &gt; PI@@ C FI@@ LE = &quot; T@@ 00@@ 450@@ 83 &quot; &gt;
&quot; if a re@@ agent is stored under the conditions recommended by the manufacturer , its required properties should be retained for at least one year . &quot;
&quot; the exp@@ iry date of a re@@ agent in a flu@@ x form , according to the label , is at most one year after the last satis@@ factory efficacy test . &quot;
the exp@@ iry date for dry re@@ agents depends on the results of the durability tests ; it is appro@@ ve by the state supervisory authorities .
&quot; dry re@@ agents are stored in an atmosphere of in@@ ert gas or in a vacuum , in the glass container in which it has been dried and which is so closed that no humidity can penet@@ rate . &quot;
&quot; a dry re@@ agent may lose no more than 0.5 B.C. of its weight , if it is tested by further drying via phosph@@ or@@ pent@@ ine at a pressure of no more than 0.0@@ 2 mm Hg in 24 hours . &quot;
&quot; to avoid bacterial growth , the competent state authority may determine that the re@@ agent ( or the solvent delivered with the dry re@@ agents ) is an anti@@ sep@@ tic and / or antibiotic , as long as the re@@ agent with the added substance remains fu@@ elled to specific@@ ity and efficacy . &quot;
sera human origin for blood type determination must contain at least 2.5 mg of protein @-@ nitrogen per ml of flu@@ x or re@@ dissolved ser@@ um .
&quot; re@@ agents , regardless of whether in a flu@@ x form or after the re@@ activation , must be transparent and may contain neither sedi@@ ments nor gels or visible particles . &quot;
&quot; the re@@ agents intended for the international exchange of blood group identification should not be arti@@ fici@@ ally colored , at least until an international agreement has come about with a uniform system . &quot;
&quot; re@@ agents to blood group determination are to be distributed in such a way and in such quantities , that the re@@ agent being present in a container is not only sufficient to carry out tests with the unknown blood cells , but also to perform tests with positive and negative control blood cells . &quot;
the quantity currently contained in a container must be so large that the content may be used to carry out the efficacy tests described in this protocol .
the manufacturer &apos;s laboratory has to carry out written records on all levels of production and controls of re@@ agents .
&quot; adequate samples of all re@@ agents entered are to be stored in the laboratory for so long , until some lik@@ el@@ ihood can be assumed that the batch is no longer used . &quot;
&quot; re@@ agents used for blood group identification can contain substances of human , animal , plant ( or mineral ) of origin ; some of these represent the effective part , the others are the necessary tools to strengthen the effectiveness and maintain the stability of the re@@ agent . &quot;
&quot; for technical reasons , these re@@ agents are divided into three groups according to their effective part . &quot;
&quot; this does not mean that the re@@ agents of human origin contain solely substances of human origin , or that animal or herbal re@@ agents cannot contain any substances of human origin . &quot;
&quot; on each single container , a printed label is printed in white printed label in English and French , containing the following information : 1 . name and address of the manufacturer , &quot;

un@@ dil@@ uted anti @-@ A + anti @-@ B ( group 0 ) blood ser@@ um must also cause an easily recogni@@ zable ag@@ glut@@ ination of the blood cells of the group A@@ x ( A@@ y or A@@ o ) .
&quot; an anti @-@ A + anti @-@ B ( group 0 ) ser@@ um is mixed on an object carrier with equal amounts of 5- to 10@@ percent@@ ages of A1 and A2 blood cells , so the ag@@ glut@@ ination must occur within the double time required , but un@@ dil@@ uted international standard preparation of the anti @-@ A blood group ser@@ ums or with a standard preparation of equal activity . &quot;
&quot; anti @-@ A + Anti @-@ B ( group 0 ) Ser@@ um is mixed on a property carrier with a same amount of 5- to 10 % in@@ let of B @-@ blood cells , which is necessary if the same attempt is performed with the re@@ dissolved , but un@@ dil@@ uted international standard preparation of the anti @-@ B blood group ser@@ um or a standard preparation of same avi@@ dity . &quot;
&quot; if an anti @-@ A + an anti @-@ B ( group 0 ) ser@@ um is mixed with the same amount of 5 to 10 % in@@ let by A@@ x ( A@@ y or A@@ o ) blood cells , the ag@@ glut@@ ination must occur within 5 minutes at a temperature of 18 to 25 ° C. &quot;
&quot; anti @-@ R@@ h blood group sera of each specific@@ ity can belong to one of two types , which differ by the conditions under which a ag@@ glut@@ ination of hom@@ olog@@ ous blood cells is achieved . &quot;
&quot; with others referred to as &quot; in@@ completely , &quot; ag@@ glut@@ ination can only be achieved by presence of certain col@@ lo@@ ids such as beef alb@@ um@@ in or with other special methods . &quot;
&quot; some &quot; &quot; in@@ complete &quot; &quot; ser@@ a ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ate on object carriers also hom@@ olog@@ ous red blood cells , which are sw@@ elled in their own ser@@ um or plasma . &quot;
the following requirements for the effectiveness of Ser@@ a for determination of the R@@ h group may be changed if international standard prepar@@ ations@@ . i ) anti @-@ D ( anti @-@ Rh@@ o ) blood group ser@@ um ( human )
anti @-@ D Ser@@ um is obtained from the blood of one or more persons being immune to the an@@ tigen D of the R@@ h system .
&quot; it re@@ acts with human red blood cells that contain the an@@ tigen D , but not with human red blood cells that do not contain the an@@ tigen D . &quot;
&quot; complete &quot; &quot; anti @-@ D Ser@@ a &quot; &quot; must have a ti@@ ter of at least 1 : 32 versus C@@ c@@ De@@ e blood cells in a 0.9 % cooking sal@@ ine solution . &quot;
&quot; a &quot; in@@ complete &quot; anti @-@ D ser@@ um is parallel to the dissolved , but un@@ dil@@ uted international standard preparation of the in@@ complete Anti @-@ D ( Anti @-@ Rh@@ o ) Ser@@ um or a corresponding comparison par@@ ate against C@@ c@@ De@@ e blood cells . &quot;
&quot; in addition to a reaction with all red blood cells containing the an@@ tigen D , the ser@@ um should react with blood cells , the Do @-@ An@@ tigen . &quot;
&quot; anti @-@ D Ser@@ a , which are intended to use object carriers according to Diamond and Ab@@ el@@ son test , must have a visible ag@@ glut@@ ination within 30 seconds , and the ag@@ glut@@ ination must be complete within 120 seconds . &quot;
anti @-@ C Ser@@ um is obtained from the blood of one or more persons being immune to the ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ogen C of the R@@ h system .
&quot; it re@@ acts with floo@@ ds of human red blood cells that contain the an@@ tigen C , but not with human red blood cells that do not contain the C @-@ tigen . &quot;
this is why these Ser@@ a are only specific for the C @-@ tigen only if the tested blood cells are infl@@ amed in a 0.@@ 9@@ percent sal@@ ine solution .
the ti@@ ters of the anti @-@ C Ser@@ a ( &quot; complete &quot; or &quot; incomplete &quot; ) must be at least 1 : 8 compared to c@@ cd@@ dee blood cells .
&quot; anti @-@ C Ser@@ a , which are intended for use on objects carriers according to Diamond and Ab@@ el@@ son test ( and not contain any form of anti @-@ D ) , must have an invisible ag@@ glut@@ ination within 30 seconds , and the ag@@ glut@@ ination must be complete within 120 seconds . &quot;
anti @-@ E ser@@ um is obtained from the blood of one or more persons being immune to the an@@ tigen E of the R@@ h system .
anti @-@ E Ser@@ a ( &quot; complete &quot; or &quot; incomplete &quot; ) should have a ti@@ ter of at least 1 : 8 versus C@@ c@@ dd@@ E@@ e blood cells .
&quot; anti @-@ E Ser@@ a , which are intended for use on objects carriers according to Diamond and Ab@@ el@@ son ( and may not contain anti @-@ D deficiency ) , if they are mixed with an equal amount of a 40@@ - to 50@@ percent in@@ let by C@@ c@@ dd@@ E@@ e blood cells at about 40 ° C , and the ag@@ glut@@ ination must be completed within 120 seconds . &quot;
sera the specific@@ ity of anti @-@ D + -@@ C and specific@@ ity anti @-@ D + -@@ E can be obtained directly from the blood of immun@@ ised persons or can be produced by mixing of anti @-@ D with anti @-@ C or anti @-@ E ser@@ um .
&quot; in a given ser@@ um , both antibodies need to be effective at the same time under the reaction conditions specified by the manufacturer . &quot;
&quot; if a ser@@ um is intended for use on object carriers according to the test according to Diamond and Ab@@ el@@ son , the ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ation time in all types of red blood cells , which show a reaction , should not be lower than with the ant@@ y antibodies . &quot;
anti @-@ A ser@@ um is obtained from the blood of animals that can be immun@@ ised by blood cells or specific substances of the group A .
&quot; anti @-@ A ser@@ um ag@@ glut@@ inated human red blood cells that contain A @-@ tigen , i.e. those of blood groups A and AB , including sub @-@ groups A1 , A2 , A@@ 1@@ b and A@@ 2B ; it does not ag@@ glut@@ inated any human red blood cells that do not contain a A @-@ tigen , that means those of blood groups 0 and B . &quot;
&quot; an anti @-@ A ser@@ um is parallel to the re@@ dissolved , but un@@ dil@@ uted international standard preparation of the anti @-@ A blood group ser@@ ums or a corresponding comparative advantage , separated with floo@@ ds of A1 , A2 and A@@ 2B red blood cells ( 1 ) . &quot;
&quot; anti @-@ A ser@@ um is mixed on an object carrier with equal amounts of 5 to 10 % in@@ let of A@@ 1- , A@@ 2- and A@@ 2B blood cells , which is necessary if the same attempt is performed with the re@@ dissolved , but un@@ dil@@ uted international standard preparation of anti @-@ A blood group ser@@ ums or a standard preparation of same avi@@ dity . &quot;
anti @-@ B Ser@@ um is obtained from the blood of animals that can be immun@@ ised by red blood cells or specific substances of the blood group B .
&quot; anti @-@ B ser@@ um ag@@ glut@@ inated human red blood cells that contain B @-@ an@@ tigen , i.e. those of blood groups B and AB ; it does not ag@@ glut@@ inated any human red blood cells that do not contain a B @-@ tigen , i.e. those of blood groups 0 and A . &quot;
&quot; an anti @-@ B ser@@ um is , parallel to the re@@ dissolved , but un@@ dil@@ uted international standard preparation of the anti @-@ B blood group ser@@ ums or a corresponding comparative advantage , with a floo@@ ding of blood cells of the group B ( 1 ) . &quot;
&quot; anti @-@ B Ser@@ um is mixed on an object carrier with the same amount of 5 to 10 % in@@ let of B @-@ blood cells , so the ag@@ glut@@ ination must occur within the double time required , if the same attempt is performed with the re@@ dissolved , but un@@ dil@@ uted international standard preparation of the anti @-@ B blood group ser@@ um or with a standard preparation of same avi@@ dity . &quot;
anti @-@ human glob@@ ulin ser@@ um for use in blood group ser@@ ology must contain ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ating antibodies against Ig@@ G Glob@@ ulin and ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ating antibodies against complementary factors .
it is obtained from the blood of animals which are immun@@ ised by inj@@ ecting human ser@@ um proteins .

the parties DI@@ ES@@ ES Convention that has been worked out under the pat@@ ron@@ age of the Council for the cooperation in the territory of the customs industry -
&quot; in DE@@ M W@@ UN@@ SCH , to facilitate comp@@ iling , comparing and evaluating statistical data , especially those of international trade , &quot;
&quot; in DE@@ M W@@ UN@@ SCH , to reduce the costs resulting from the fact that in international trade transport goods must be new , new , new and new , and to facilitate the standar@@ dis@@ ation of trade documents and the transmission of data , &quot;
the development of the technology and structures of international trade necess@@ it@@ ates significant changes in the Brussels agreement of 15 December 1950 on the tari@@ ff tari@@ ff for the import of commodities into customs tari@@ ffs .
&quot; furthermore , the measure that the measure demanded by governments and the economy for tari@@ ff and statistical purposes is currently far beyond that which is contained in the system to the a@@ forem@@ en@@ tioned agreement , &quot;
&quot; in DER exhaus@@ tion , that it is important to disp@@ ose of accurate and comparable data in international trade negotiations , &quot;
&quot; in DER allowance , that the harmon@@ ised system should be used for freight rates and traffic statistics of different modes of transport ; &quot;
&quot; in DER allowance , the harmon@@ ised system is intended to be included as far as possible into the systems used in the Trading System for the designation and enco@@ ding of the goods , &quot;
&quot; on the one hand , the harmon@@ ised system aims to bring about a close relationship between import and export statistics on the one hand and the production statistics on the one hand and the production statistics on the other hand , that a close relationship between the harmon@@ ised system and the International War@@ ehouse for the Foreign Trade ( S@@ IT@@ C ) of the United Nations should be maintained , &quot;
&quot; in DER allowance , that it is desirable to comply with the requirements listed above by a combined customs tari@@ ff and statisti@@ cian clause , which is suitable for use by the international trade involved , &quot;
&quot; in DER Review , that it is important to ensure adaptation of the harmon@@ ised system to the development of technology and the structures of international trade , &quot;
&quot; taking into account the work carried out by the Council for the cooperation in the field of customs , for the harmon@@ ised system in this field , &quot;
&quot; in THE W@@ hole , that although the a@@ forem@@ en@@ tioned agreement has proved to be an effective instrument to achieve some of these goals - the conclusion of a new international convention is the most suitable way to achieve the desired result . &quot;
&quot; in the sense of this agreement means a ) &quot; harmon@@ ised system for the name and enco@@ ding of the goods , &quot; in the following &quot; harmon@@ ised system , &quot; consisting of positions and sub @-@ positions with the corresponding co@@ den@@ um@@ mers , from notes on sections . chapters and sub @-@ positions as well as the general rules for the interpretation of the harmon@@ ised system ; &quot;
