&quot; this document is a summary of the European Public Assessment Report ( EP@@ AR ) , which explains how the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) assessed the studies carried out in order to make recommendations regarding the use of the medicine . &quot;
&quot; if you need further information about your illness or treatment , please read the package template ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) or contact your doctor or pharmac@@ ist . &quot;
&quot; if you would like more information on the basis of CH@@ MP recommendations , please read the scientific discussion ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) . &quot;
&quot; it is available as 5 mg , 10 mg , 15 mg and 30 mg tablets , as 10 mg , 15 mg and 30 mg of processed tablets ( tablets that dis@@ solve in the mouth ) , as a solution to intake ( 1 mg / ml ) and as injection solution ( 7.5 mg / ml ) . &quot;
&quot; B. s@@ wir@@ l thinking and speaking , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations ( hearing or seeing things that are not present ) , di@@ str@@ ust and del@@ u@@ sions ; • Bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , a mental illness , in which patients have man@@ ic episodes ( periods of an@@ or@@ mal up@@ set ) altern@@ ately with periods of normal mood . &quot;
A@@ bili@@ fy is used to treat moderate to severe man@@ ic episodes and to prevent man@@ ic episodes in patients who have responded to the medicine in the past .
injection solution is used for quick control of increased un@@ rest or behavi@@ our@@ al disorders if the oral intake of the medicine is not possible .
&quot; in both diseases , the solution can be applied to the intake or the melting tablets in patients who have difficulty swal@@ lowing tablets . &quot;
&quot; patients who also take other medicines at the same time , like A@@ bili@@ fy , should be adjusted to A@@ bili@@ fy dose . &quot;
&quot; this imp@@ airs the signal transmission between brain cells by &quot; neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ smit@@ ters , &quot; i.e. chemical substances that allow the communication of nerve cells to one another . &quot;
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l probably works mainly as a &quot; partial agon@@ ist &quot; for the recept@@ ors for neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ sm@@ itter dop@@ amine and 5 hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin ( also called ser@@ oton@@ in ) .
&quot; this means that Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l like 5 hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin and dop@@ amine , but in less than the neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ sm@@ itter works to activate the recept@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; since dop@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amine play a role in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l contributes to norm@@ alize the activity of the brain , causing psych@@ otic or man@@ ic symptoms to be reduced and their re@@ occurring will be prevented . &quot;
&quot; the efficacy of A@@ bili@@ fy , to prevent recur@@ rence of symptoms , was investigated in three studies over to one year . &quot;
&quot; the effectiveness of the injection solution was compared to two studies in 8@@ 05 patients with schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia or similar diseases , which suffered from increased un@@ rest , compared to a plac@@ ebo over a period of two hours . &quot;
&quot; in another study , A@@ bili@@ fy was compared to 347 patients with Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol , in another study the efficacy of A@@ bili@@ fy and plac@@ ebo to prevent recur@@ rence of 160 patients in which the man@@ ic symptoms were already stabil@@ ised with A@@ bili@@ fy . &quot;
&quot; the efficacy of A@@ bili@@ fy injection solution was compared to 301 patients with bi@@ polar disorder , which suffered from increased un@@ rest , compared with Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( another anti@@ psych@@ otic medication ) and plac@@ ebo over a period of two hours . &quot;
&quot; in all studies , the change in the patient &apos;s symptoms was examined using a standard scale for bi@@ polar disorder or the number of patients responded to treatment . &quot;
the company also conducted studies to investigate how the body lowers the enam@@ el tablets and the solution to intake .
&quot; in the two studies with the injection solution showed patients receiving A@@ bili@@ fy in doses of 5.@@ 25 mg , 9.@@ 75 mg or 15 mg , a significantly stronger decrease in symptoms of increased un@@ rest than the patients receiving plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in the treatment of bi@@ polar disorder , A@@ bili@@ fy decreased in four of the five short @-@ term studies man@@ ic symptoms more effective than plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in addition to plac@@ ebo , A@@ bili@@ fy prevented a recur@@ rence of multiple episodes in previously treated patients as plac@@ ebo and if it was additionally administered to an existing treatment . &quot;
A@@ bili@@ fy inj@@ ections in 10@@ - or 15 @-@ mg doses also reduced more effective than plac@@ ebo the symptoms of increased un@@ rest and were similarly effective as Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am .
&quot; the most common side effects of A@@ bili@@ fy to take ( observed with 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are extra@@ pyram@@ idal dis@@ rup@@ tions ( un@@ controll@@ able ) , sed@@ ation ( drow@@ sin@@ ess ) , fatigue , nau@@ sea ( drow@@ sin@@ ess ) , fatigue and exhaus@@ tion , rest@@ lessness , in@@ som@@ nia ( sleep disorders ) and anxiety . &quot;
&quot; the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of A@@ bili@@ fy in the treatment of schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and from moderate to severe man@@ ic episodes in cases of bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , as well as in the prevention of a new man@@ ic episode in patients who had predominantly experienced episodes of treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l , weigh@@ ed over the risks . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the committee came to the conclusion that the advantages of the injection solution in quick control of increased anxiety and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders in patients with schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia or in patients with man@@ ic episodes in bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder if oral therapy is not suitable to out@@ weigh the risks . &quot;
&quot; in June 2004 , the European Commission granted the company Ot@@ su@@ ka Pharmaceu@@ tical Europe Ltd . &quot;
A@@ bili@@ fy is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe man@@ ic episodes of bi@@ polar disorder and for the prevention of a new man@@ ic episode in patients that had predominantly man@@ ic episodes and whose man@@ ic episodes were addressed to the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l ( see section 5.1 ) .
the recommended starting dose for A@@ bili@@ fy is 10 or 15 mg / day with a maintenance dosage of 15 mg / day once daily regardless of meals .
&quot; increased effectiveness in dos@@ ages over a daily dose of 15 mg was not proven , although individual patients can benefit from a higher dose . &quot;
&quot; the recommended starting dose for A@@ bili@@ fy is 15 mg once daily , regardless of meals as mon@@ otherapy or combination therapy ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
the efficacy of A@@ bili@@ fy in the treatment of schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar disorder in patients ≥ 65 years has not been proven .
&quot; with regard to the greater sensitivity of this patient group , a lower initial dose should be considered when clinical factors justify this ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; if the C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 induc@@ tor is removed from combination therapy , the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l dose should be reduced to the recommended dose ( see Section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; the occurrence of su@@ ici@@ dal behavior belongs to psych@@ otic diseases and aff@@ ective disorders , and was reported in some cases after the beginning or after an anti@@ psych@@ otic therapy , including treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l ( see section 4.8 ) . &quot;
results of an epide@@ mi@@ ological study showed that in patients with bi@@ polar disorder there was no higher suicide risk with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l compared to other anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics .
&quot; Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l should be used with caution in patients with known cardiovascular diseases ( M@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction or isch@@ em@@ ic heart disease , con@@ ges@@ tion disorders ) , cer@@ eb@@ rov@@ ascular diseases , conditions that pre@@ disp@@ ose for hyp@@ ot@@ ony ( de@@ hydr@@ ation , hypo@@ vol@@ emia , treatment with blood @-@ lowering drugs ) or hyper@@ tension ( including ac@@ oc@@ el@@ ated and mal@@ ign@@ ant form ) . &quot;
&quot; 3 Sp@@ ät@@ dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical trials , which lasted a year or less , there were occasional reports of dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esis occurring during treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l . &quot;
&quot; if patients treated with A@@ bili@@ fy showed signs and symptoms of late dy@@ nasty , consider to reduce the dose or ab@@ ort the treatment . &quot;
&quot; if a patient develops signs and symptoms that suggest a m@@ ns , or un@@ clear high fever without an additional clinical manifestation of m@@ ns , all anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , including A@@ bili@@ fy , must be removed . &quot;
&quot; therefore , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l in patients with sei@@ zur@@ es in the an@@ am@@ nes@@ is or at states associated with sei@@ zur@@ es should be applied with caution . &quot;
&quot; 56 - 99 years ) with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l in patients with psycho@@ sis associated with Alzheimer &apos;s disease , patients who were treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l had an increased risk of ster@@ ber@@ is@@ iko compared to the plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; however , there were in one of these studies , a study with fixed dosage , a significant relation between dosage and response to undes@@ irable cer@@ eb@@ rov@@ ascular events in patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l . &quot;
&quot; hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia , in some cases extremely and associated with k@@ eto@@ aci@@ dosis or hyper@@ os@@ mol@@ ar@@ em coma or death , was reported in patients treated with at@@ yp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic agents , including A@@ bili@@ fy . &quot;
there are no precise risk estimates for hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia @-@ related adverse events in patients treated with A@@ bili@@ fy and other at@@ yp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic drugs to allow direct compar@@ isons .
&quot; poly@@ di@@ p@@ sia , poly@@ ph@@ ag@@ ia , poly@@ ph@@ ag@@ ia and weakness ) are observed and patients with diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or with risk factors for diabetes M@@ ell@@ itus should be monitored regularly with regard to wor@@ sen@@ ing the glucose levels . &quot;
&quot; weight gain is generally observed in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ic patients and in patients with bi@@ polar man@@ ia due to com@@ or@@ bi@@ di@@ ties , the use of anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , where weight gain is known as side effect , and could lead to severe complications . &quot;
&quot; due to the primary effect of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l on the central nervous system , caution is advisable when Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l is taken in combination with alcohol or other central effective medicines with over@@ lying side effects such as sed@@ ation ( see section 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; the H2 antagon@@ ist Fam@@ oti@@ din , a gast@@ ric acid blo@@ cker , reduces the res@@ or@@ ption rate of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l , but this effect is considered clin@@ ically not relevant . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical study with healthy volunteers , a highly effective C@@ YP@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ or ( Ch@@ ini@@ dine ) increased the AU@@ C by Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l by 107 % while the C@@ MA@@ x remained unchanged . &quot;
&quot; it is expected that other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ YP@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 , such as flu@@ ox@@ et@@ ine and par@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , have similar effects and therefore similar dose @-@ reductions should be carried out . &quot;
&quot; with C@@ YP@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 &apos; bad &apos; ( = &quot; poor &quot; ) metabolism , the common application with highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 can result in higher plasma concentrations of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l compared to C@@ YP@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 exten@@ sive metabol@@ is@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; considering the common administration of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole or other highly effective C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors with A@@ bili@@ fy , potential benefits should out@@ weigh the potential risks for the patient . &quot;
&quot; other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 , such as i@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole and HIV prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , have similar effects and therefore similar dose @-@ reductions should be carried out . &quot;
&quot; after setting the C@@ YP@@ 2@@ D@@ 6- or 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors , the dosage of A@@ bili@@ fy should be lifted to the dose height before the start of the accompanying therapy . &quot;
&quot; dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em or esc@@ ital@@ op@@ ram ) or C@@ YP@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 are administered together with A@@ bili@@ fy , can be calculated with a moderate increase in ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - concentrations . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials , doses of 10 @-@ 30 mg Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l per day showed no significant effect on metabolism of the sub@@ str@@ ates of C@@ YP@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 ( D@@ ex@@ tro@@ meth@@ ion@@ an / 3 @-@ Metho@@ xy@@ morph@@ in@@ an ratio ) , 2@@ C@@ 9 ( O@@ me@@ pra@@ zo@@ l ) and 3@@ A4 ( D@@ ex@@ tro@@ meth@@ ion@@ an ) . &quot;
patients should be advised to notify their doctor if they are pregnant or plan pregnancy during treatment with ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l .
&quot; due to the insufficient data base for safety in humans and due to the concerns raised in animal reproductive studies , this drug may not be used in pregnancy unless the possible benefit justi@@ fies the potential risk of the fet@@ us . &quot;
&quot; however , as with other anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , patients should be warned against dangerous machines , including motor vehicles , until they are certain that Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l has no negative impact on them . &quot;
the following side effects occurred more frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than under plac@@ ebo or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects ( * ) :
&quot; the frequency of side effects listed below is defined according to the following criteria : frequently ( &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( &gt; 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) . &quot;
&quot; schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia - in a controlled long @-@ term study over 52 weeks occurred in patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l , a total lower incidence ( 25.@@ 8 % ) of EPS including Par@@ kin@@ son@@ ism , Ak@@ ath@@ isie , dy@@ nasty , dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esis , compared to patients treated with Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol ( 57.@@ 3 % ) . &quot;
in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled long @-@ term study over 26 weeks the incidence of EPS was 19 % in patients with ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l treatment and 13.@@ 1 % in patients under plac@@ ebo .
&quot; in another controlled long @-@ term study over 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS was 14.@@ 8 % in patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l and 15.@@ 1 % in patients under O@@ lan@@ z@@ ap@@ in therapy . &quot;
&quot; in a controlled study over 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS was 23.@@ 5 % in patients with ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 5@@ 3.3 % in patients with Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol treatment . &quot;
&quot; in another study over 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS was 26.@@ 6 % in patients with ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l treatment and 17.@@ 6 % for those under lithium @-@ treatment . &quot;
in the long @-@ term maintenance phase over 26 weeks in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study the incidence of EPS 18.@@ 2 % for patients with ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 15.@@ 7 % for patients treated with plac@@ ebo .
&quot; a comparison between the patient groups under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l and plac@@ ebo , where potentially clin@@ ically significant changes in rout@@ inely controlled laboratory parameters occurred , did not result in medi@@ cally significant differences . &quot;
&quot; the CP@@ K ( cre@@ atine @-@ ph@@ osp@@ ho@@ kin@@ ase ) , generally temporary and asy@@ mpt@@ om@@ atic , were observed in 3.5 % of patients treated with ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l , compared to 2.0 % of patients treated with plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; the side effects that may occur in connection with an anti@@ psych@@ otic therapy , and also reported in the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l include mal@@ ign@@ ant neuro@@ le@@ p@@ tic syndrome , late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia and conv@@ ul@@ sions , undes@@ irable cer@@ eb@@ rov@@ ascular events and increased mort@@ ality in older demen@@ tia patients , hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and diabetes M@@ ell@@ itus ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials and since the launch , un@@ inten@@ tional or inten@@ tional over@@ dos@@ ages with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l were observed alone in adult patients with estimated doses of up to 12@@ 60 mg and without death . &quot;
&quot; although there is no information about the efficacy of a hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis in the treatment of an over@@ dose with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l , it is unlikely that hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis in the treatment of an over@@ dose is of benefit because Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l has a high plasma network connection . &quot;
it is assumed that the effectiveness of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l is medi@@ ated in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder via the combination of a partially agon@@ istic effect on dop@@ amine dop@@ amine and ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1 recept@@ ors and an antagon@@ istic effect on ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 75 recept@@ ors .
&quot; Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l showed in vitro a high aff@@ inity to dop@@ amine D@@ 2- and D3 recep@@ tor and a ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ a- and 5@@ HT@@ 2a recep@@ tor as well as an even aff@@ inity to dop@@ amine D@@ 4 , the ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2@@ c@@ - and 5@@ HT@@ 7@@ - , for alpha @-@ 1 @-@ adren@@ ergi@@ c and to the hist@@ amine H@@ 1@@ recep@@ tor . &quot;
&quot; when offering Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l in dos@@ ages of 0.5 to 30 mg once daily over 2 weeks of healthy volunteers , the posit@@ ron emission tom@@ ography showed a dose @-@ dependent reduction of the binding of 11@@ c @-@ Rac@@ lo@@ pri@@ d , a D2 / D3 recep@@ tor lig@@ ands , at the nucle@@ us cau@@ dat@@ us and at put@@ amen . &quot;
in three plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled short @-@ term studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) on 1.@@ 228 schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ic patients with positive or negative symptoms Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l showed a statisti@@ cally significant improvement of the psych@@ otic symptoms compared to plac@@ ebo .
&quot; in a Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol @-@ controlled trial , 52 % of respon@@ dents accoun@@ ted for a response to study medicine in both groups ( Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l 77 % and Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol 73 % ) . &quot;
&quot; current values from measurement scales defined as secondary study goals , including PAN@@ SS and Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery As@@ berg@@ - Dep@@ res@@ sions Scale , showed a significantly stronger improvement than at Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol . &quot;
&quot; in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study over 26 weeks of stabili@@ zed patients with chronic schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l showed a significantly higher reduction in the return rate , which was at 34 % in the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l group and 57 % below plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in an O@@ lan@@ z@@ ap@@ in controlled , multinational double blind study in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia over 26 weeks , which included 314 patients and in which the primary study objective &apos; weight gain &apos; was , a weight gain of at least 7 % compared to the initial value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.6 kg at an average weight of ca . &quot;
in two plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy studies with flexible dosage over 3 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of Bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l showed a superior efficacy in reducing man@@ ic symptoms over 3 weeks .
in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy study over 3 weeks with a fixed dosage with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of the bi@@ polar I disorder Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l showed no superior efficacy against plac@@ ebo .
&quot; in two plac@@ ebo@@ - and actively controlled mon@@ otherapy studies over 12 weeks in patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , with or without psych@@ otic symptoms , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l showed a efficacy in week 3 and a maintenance effect comparable to that of lithium or Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol in week 12 . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l also showed a comparable proportion of patients with sy@@ mpt@@ om@@ atic re@@ mission of the man@@ ia , such as lithium or hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol . &quot;
&quot; in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study over 6 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , with or without psych@@ otic symptoms , which in some cases did not respond to lithium or val@@ pro@@ at mon@@ otherapy in therapeutic ser@@ um @-@ mirrors , the accompanying therapy with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l showed superior efficacy in reducing man@@ ic symptoms compared to mon@@ otherapy with lithium or val@@ pro@@ at . &quot;
&quot; in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study over 26 weeks followed by a long @-@ term expansion phase over 74 weeks in man@@ ic patients who had achieved a re@@ mission with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l over a stabil@@ isation phase , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l demonstrated in regard to the prevention of a bi@@ polar back@@ fall , mainly in the prevention of a rel@@ apse into the man@@ ia . &quot;
&quot; based on in vitro studies , the enzymes C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 and C@@ YP@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 are responsible for de@@ hydr@@ ation and hydro@@ xy@@ ation of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l , the N @-@ De@@ al@@ ky@@ ung is cataly@@ sed by C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 . &quot;
the mean time of elimination is approximately 75 hours for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l with extensive met@@ abol@@ is@@ ers via C@@ YP@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and nearly 146 hours in &apos; poor &apos; ( = &quot; poor &quot; ) met@@ abol@@ is@@ ers via C@@ YP@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 .
&quot; in Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l , there are no differences in pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics between male and female healthy volunteers , as well as a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic examination of schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia patients showed no gender @-@ dependent effects . &quot;
a Pop@@ ulations @-@ specific evaluation to pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics showed no indication of clin@@ ically significant differences with regard to ethnic origin or the impact of smoking on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l and Deh@@ ydr@@ o @-@ Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l were similar in patients with severe kidney failure compared to young healthy volunteers .
&quot; a single dose study of subjects with varying liver cir@@ rho@@ sis ( Child @-@ Pu@@ gh Class A , B and C ) showed no significant effect concerning the imp@@ airment of the liver function on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l and Deh@@ ydr@@ o @-@ Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l , but the study included only 3 patients with cir@@ rho@@ sis of the class C , which is not enough to draw conclusions on their metabolic capacity . &quot;
&quot; based on conventional studies on safety har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated administration , reproduction sto@@ x@@ ic@@ ity , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and the car@@ cin@@ ogenic potential , the prec@@ lin@@ ical data could not detect any particular haz@@ ards for human beings . &quot;
&quot; toxic@@ ologically significant effects were only observed when dos@@ ages or ex@@ positions which have significantly exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure to humans , so they have limited or no meaning for clinical application . &quot;
the effects included a dose @-@ dependent adren@@ al rin@@ se toxic@@ ity ( Li@@ po@@ f@@ us@@ cin @-@ Pig@@ ment @-@ accumulation and / or par@@ ench@@ y@@ mal cell loss ) in rats after 104 weeks at the recommended maximum dose in humans ) and an increase of adren@@ al rin@@ ds / car@@ cin@@ omas / car@@ cin@@ omas in female rats at 60 mg / kg / day ( the 10 times the mean steady state exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended maximum dose in humans ) .
&quot; in addition , a chol@@ eli@@ thi@@ asis was determined as a result of the precip@@ itation of sul@@ fate con@@ ju@@ gates of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l in the G@@ alle of monkeys after repeated or@@ mal gift from 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( the 1- to 3@@ fold of the recommended maximum dose in humans based on mg / m2 ) . &quot;
&quot; however , the concentrations of the sulph@@ ate con@@ ju@@ gate of Hydro@@ xy@@ - Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l of the highest recommended daily dose of 30 mg , which were found in the study over 39 weeks in the G@@ alle by monkeys , are far below the limit values ( 6 % ) of in vitro sol@@ ub@@ ility . &quot;
&quot; in rab@@ bits these effects were observed after dos@@ ages , which led to ex@@ positions of the 3- and 11@@ am of the mean steady @-@ state AU@@ C at the recommended clinical maximum dose . &quot;
&quot; perfor@@ ated bli@@ ster packs to deliver single boxes made of aluminium in folding cart@@ ons with 14 x 1 , 28 x 1 , 49 x 1 , 56 x 1 , 98 x 1 tablet . &quot;
&quot; 15 Sp@@ ät@@ dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical trials , which lasted a year or less , there were occasional reports of dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esis occurring during treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l . &quot;
it is assumed that the effectiveness of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l is medi@@ ated in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder via the combination of a partially agon@@ istic effect on dop@@ amine dop@@ amine and ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1 recept@@ ors and an antagon@@ istic effect on ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 75 recept@@ ors .
&quot; 22 In a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study over 26 weeks followed by a long @-@ term expansion phase over 74 weeks in man@@ ic patients who had achieved a re@@ mission with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l over a stabili@@ zation period before Rand@@ om@@ ization , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l demonstrated in regard to the prevention of a bi@@ polar disorder , mainly in the prevention of a rel@@ apse into the man@@ ia . &quot;
&quot; 27 Sp@@ ät@@ dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical trials , which lasted a year or less , there were occasional reports of dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esis occurring during treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l . &quot;

the recommended starting dose for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l is 10 or 15 mg / day with a maintenance dosage of 15 mg / day once daily regardless of meals .
patients who have difficulty swal@@ lowing A@@ bili@@ fy tablets may alternatively take the enam@@ el tablets as an alternative to A@@ bili@@ fy tablets ( see section 5.2 ) .
&quot; the occurrence of su@@ ici@@ dal behavior belongs to psych@@ otic diseases and aff@@ ective disorder has been reported in some cases after the beginning or after an anti@@ psych@@ otic therapy , including treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l ( see section 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; late @-@ dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical trials , which lasted a year or less , there were occasional reports of dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esis occurring during the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l . &quot;
&quot; clinical manifest@@ ations of a m@@ ns are high fever , muscle rigi@@ dity , varying levels of consciousness and signs of autonomous inst@@ ability ( irregular pulse or blood pressure , t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia , swe@@ ating and heart rhyth@@ ms ) . &quot;

the following side effects occurred more frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than under plac@@ ebo or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects of the drug ( * ) :
in two plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy studies with flexible dosage over 3 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of Bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l showed a superior efficacy in reducing man@@ ic symptoms over 3 weeks .

&quot; the recommended starting dose for A@@ bili@@ fy is 15 mg once daily , regardless of meals as mon@@ otherapy or combination therapy ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
&quot; for the prevention of recur@@ rent episodes in patients who have already received Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l , the treatment should be continued with the same dose . &quot;

there are no precise risk estimates for hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia @-@ related adverse events in patients treated with A@@ bili@@ fy and other at@@ yp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic drugs to allow direct compar@@ isons .
&quot; 92 In a clinical study with healthy volunteers , a highly effective C@@ YP@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ or ( Ch@@ ini@@ dine ) increased the AU@@ C of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l by 107 % while the C@@ MA@@ x remained unchanged . &quot;

&quot; in a controlled study over 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS was 23.@@ 5 % in patients with ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - &quot;
it is assumed that the effectiveness of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l is medi@@ ated in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder via the combination of a partially agon@@ istic effect on dop@@ amine dop@@ amine and ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1 recept@@ ors and an antagon@@ istic effect on ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 75 recept@@ ors .
&quot; in an O@@ lan@@ z@@ ap@@ in controlled , multinational double blind study in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia over 26 weeks , which included 314 patients and in which the primary study objective &apos; weight gain &apos; was , a weight gain of at least 7 % compared to the initial value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.6 kg at an average weight of ca . &quot;

&quot; in addition , a chol@@ eli@@ thi@@ asis was determined as a result of the precip@@ itation of sulph@@ ate con@@ ju@@ gates of the hydro@@ xy@@ - metabol@@ ites of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l in the G@@ alle of monkeys after repeated oral dose of 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( 1 to 3 times of the recommended maximum dose in humans based on mg / m2 ) . &quot;
&quot; in rab@@ bits these effects were observed after dos@@ ages , which led to ex@@ positions of the 3- and 11@@ am of the mean steady @-@ state AU@@ C at the recommended clinical maximum dose . &quot;
A@@ bili@@ fy In@@ j@@ ection solution is used for quick control of Agi@@ ot@@ ics and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders in patients with schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia or in patients with man@@ ic episodes of bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder if oral therapy is not appropriate .
&quot; once it is clin@@ ically appropriate , the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l injection solution should be termin@@ ated and started using the oral application of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l . &quot;
&quot; in order to increase res@@ or@@ ption and minimize vari@@ ability , an injection into the M. del@@ to@@ ide@@ us or deep into the glut@@ eus maxim@@ us muscle is recommended under circum@@ fence of adi@@ p@@ ous regions . &quot;
a lower dose of 5.@@ 25 mg ( 0.7 ml ) may be given depending on the individual clinical status taking account of the medicines used for maintenance or acute treatment ( see section 4.5 ) .
&quot; if an oral treatment is indicated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l , see the summary of the characteristics of the drug with A@@ bili@@ fy tablets , A@@ bili@@ fy Mel@@ ting tablets or A@@ bili@@ fy solution . &quot;
&quot; there are no studies on the efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l injection solution in patients with ab@@ norm@@ alities and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders , which were otherwise caused by schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and man@@ ic episodes of bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder . &quot;
&quot; if a par@@ enter@@ al therapy with ben@@ zo@@ di@@ az@@ ep@@ ins is considered necessary in addition to the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l injection solution , patients should be observed with regard to extreme sed@@ ation or blood pressure ( see Section 4.5 ) . &quot;
investigations on the safety and efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l injection solution are not available for patients with alcohol or drug poison@@ ing ( prescribed by prescription or illegal drugs ) .
&quot; Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l should be used with caution in patients with known cardiovascular diseases ( M@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction or isch@@ em@@ ic heart disease , con@@ ges@@ tion disorders ) , cer@@ eb@@ rov@@ ascular diseases , conditions that pre@@ disp@@ ose for hyp@@ ot@@ ony ( de@@ hydr@@ ation , hypo@@ vol@@ emia , treatment with blood @-@ lowering drugs ) or hyper@@ tension ( including ac@@ oc@@ el@@ ated and mal@@ ign@@ ant form ) . &quot;
&quot; late @-@ dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical trials , which lasted a year or less , there were occasional reports of dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esis occurring during the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l . &quot;
&quot; clinical manifest@@ ations of a m@@ ns are high fever , muscle sti@@ ff@@ ness , varying levels of consciousness and signs of autonomous inst@@ ability ( irregular pulse or blood pressure , t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia , swe@@ ating and heart rhyth@@ ms ) . &quot;
&quot; poly@@ di@@ p@@ sie , poly@@ ur@@ ie , poly@@ ph@@ ag@@ ia and weakness ) are observed and patients with diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or with risk factors for diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus should be regularly monitored with regard to wor@@ sen@@ ing the glucose levels . &quot;
&quot; weight gain is generally observed in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ic patients and patients with bi@@ polar man@@ ia due to com@@ or@@ bi@@ di@@ ties , the use of anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics where weight gain is known as a side effect and could lead to severe complications . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , the intensity of the sed@@ ation was larger compared to that after the sole gift of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l , in a study in which healthy subjects Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l ( 15 mg dose ) was in@@ tram@@ us@@ cul@@ arly applied and which at the same time received Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( 2 mg dose ) in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular . &quot;
&quot; the H2 @-@ antagon@@ ist Fam@@ oti@@ din , a gast@@ ric acid blo@@ cker , reduces the res@@ or@@ ption rate of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l , but this effect is considered clin@@ ically not relevant . &quot;
&quot; in comparison with C@@ YP@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 &apos; poor &apos; ( = &quot; poor &quot; ) Met@@ abol@@ is@@ ers , the common application with highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 can result in higher plasma concentrations of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l . &quot;
&quot; other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 , such as I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole and H@@ IV@@ - prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , have similar effects and therefore similar dose @-@ reductions should be carried out . &quot;
&quot; after setting the C@@ YP@@ 2@@ D@@ 6- or 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors , the dosage of A@@ bili@@ fy should be lifted to the dose height before the start of the accompanying therapy . &quot;

the following side effects occurred in clinical trials with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l injection solution more frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than under plac@@ ebo or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects ( * ) :
&quot; the frequency of side effects listed below is defined according to the following criteria : frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) . &quot;
107 The following adverse events occurred more frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than under plac@@ ebo or were classified in clinical trials with or@@ ally relevant ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l as possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects ( * ) :
in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled long @-@ term study over 26 weeks the incidence of EPS was 19 % in patients with ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole treatment and 13.@@ 1 % in patients under plac@@ ebo .
&quot; in another study over 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS was 26.@@ 6 % in patients with ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole treatment and 17.@@ 6 % for those under lithium @-@ treatment . &quot;
in the long @-@ term maintenance phase over 26 weeks in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study the incidence of EPS 18.@@ 2 % for patients with ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l treatment and 15.@@ 7 % for patients treated with plac@@ ebo .
&quot; a comparison between the patient groups under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l and plac@@ ebo , where potentially clin@@ ically significant changes in rout@@ inely controlled laboratory parameters occurred , did not result in medi@@ cally significant differences . &quot;
&quot; increases of CP@@ K ( Cre@@ at@@ in@@ ph@@ osp@@ ho@@ kin@@ ase ) , generally temporary and asy@@ mpt@@ om@@ atic , were observed at 3.5 % of patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l , compared to 2.0 % of patients treated with plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; the side effects that may occur in connection with an anti@@ psych@@ otic therapy , and also reported in the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l include mal@@ ign@@ ant neuro@@ le@@ p@@ tic syndrome , late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia and conv@@ ul@@ sions , undes@@ irable cer@@ eb@@ rov@@ ascular events and increased mort@@ ality in older demen@@ tia patients , hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
110 and behavi@@ our@@ al distur@@ bances was the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l injection solution associated with statisti@@ cally significant improvements of Agi@@ oy@@ ancy / behavi@@ our@@ al disorders compared with plac@@ ebo and was similar to Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol .
&quot; in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled short @-@ time study ( 24 h ) with 291 patients with bi@@ polar disorder as well as Agi@@ or@@ iness and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders , the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l injection solution was associated with a statisti@@ cally significant improvement in symptoms regarding the Agi@@ ari@@ dity and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders compared to plac@@ ebo and similar to the Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am@@ - reference arm . &quot;
&quot; the mean improvement of the bas@@ eline at the PAN@@ SS Ex@@ cit@@ ement Compon@@ ent score in the primary 2 @-@ hour end@@ point was 5,@@ 8 for plac@@ ebo , 9.@@ 6 for Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am and 8,@@ 7 for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l . &quot;
&quot; in analyses of sub@@ groups in patients with mixed episodes or patients with severe Agi@@ on , a similar efficacy was observed in relation to the overall population , but a statistical significance could be determined because of a reduced number of patients . &quot;
&quot; in three plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled short @-@ term studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) at 1,@@ 228 schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ic patients with positive or negative symptoms , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l ( oral ) showed a statisti@@ cally significant improvement of the psych@@ otic symptoms compared to plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in a Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol @-@ controlled trial , 52 % of respon@@ der patients had a response to study medicine in both groups ( Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l 77 % ( oral ) and Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol 73 % ) . &quot;
&quot; current values from measurement scales defined as secondary study goals , including PAN@@ SS and Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery As@@ berg Dep@@ res@@ sions Scale , showed a significantly stronger improvement than at Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol . &quot;
&quot; in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study over 26 weeks of stabili@@ zed patients with chronic schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l ( oral ) showed a significantly higher reduction in the return rate , which was at 34 % in the ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - ( oral ) group and at 57 % below plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in an O@@ lan@@ z@@ ap@@ in @-@ controlled , multinational double blind study in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia over 26 weeks , which included 314 patients and in which the primary study objective &apos; weight gain &apos; was , a weight gain of at least 7 % compared to the initial value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.6 kg at an average weight of ca . &quot;
&quot; 111 In a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study over 6 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , with or without psych@@ otic symptoms , which in some cases did not respond to lithium or val@@ pro@@ at mon@@ otherapy in therapeutic ser@@ um @-@ mirrors , the accompanying therapy with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l showed superior efficacy in reducing man@@ ic symptoms compared to mon@@ otherapy with lithium or val@@ pro@@ at . &quot;
&quot; in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study over 26 weeks followed by a 74 @-@ week study extension in many patients who had achieved a re@@ mission with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l during a stabil@@ isation phase , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l demonstrated in regard to the prevention of a bi@@ polar back@@ fall , mainly in the prevention of a rel@@ apse into the man@@ ia . &quot;
&quot; in the first 2 hours after in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular injection , the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l AU@@ C is 90 % larger than the AU@@ C after offering the same dose as a tablet ; the system@@ ic exposition was similar between the two form@@ ulations . &quot;
&quot; in 2 trials involving healthy subjects , the mean time until reaching the maximum plasma level is 1 to 3 hours after application . &quot;
&quot; the gift of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l injection solution was well toler@@ ated by rats and monkeys and resulted in no direct toxic@@ ity of a target organ after repeated administration in a system@@ ic exposition ( AU@@ C ) , which in 15@@ - and 5 times above the maximum human therapeutic exposure of 30 mg in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular . &quot;
&quot; in studies on reproductive @-@ sto@@ x@@ ic@@ ity after intra@@ ven@@ ous application , no safety @-@ related concerns occurred after mat@@ ernal exposure , which was 15@@ - ( rats ) and 29 @-@ mal ( rab@@ bits ) over the maximum human therapeutic exposure of 30 mg . &quot;
&quot; based on conventional studies with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l ( oral ) for safety har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated administration , reproductive @-@ toxic@@ ity , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and the car@@ cin@@ ogenic potential , the prec@@ lin@@ ical data could not detect any particular haz@@ ards for human beings . &quot;
&quot; toxic@@ ologically significant effects were only observed when dos@@ ages or ex@@ positions which have significantly exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure to humans , so they have limited or no meaning for clinical application . &quot;
the effects included a dose @-@ dependent adren@@ al rin@@ se toxic@@ ity ( li@@ po@@ f@@ us@@ cin @-@ pig@@ ment accumulation and / or par@@ ench@@ y@@ mal cell loss ) in rats after 104 weeks with 20 to 60 mg / kg / day ( corresponds to the 3- to 10 times the middle steady @-@ state exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended maximum dose in humans ) .
&quot; in addition , a chol@@ eli@@ thi@@ asis was determined as a result of the precip@@ itation of sul@@ fate con@@ ju@@ gates of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l in the G@@ alle of monkeys after repeated or@@ mal gift from 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( the 1- to 3 times of the recommended maximum dose in humans based on mg / m2 ) . &quot;
&quot; in rab@@ bits these effects were observed after dos@@ ages , which led to ex@@ positions of the 3- and 11 @-@ times of the middle steady @-@ state AU@@ C at the recommended clinical maximum dose . &quot;

&quot; the effectiveness of Abra@@ x@@ ane was studied in a main study involving 460 women with metastatic breast cancer , of which approximately three quarters previously had an anth@@ rac@@ y@@ cl@@ ine . &quot;
the effect of Abra@@ x@@ ane ( in sole offering or as mon@@ otherapy ) was compared with the drug containing a conventional pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el ( given in combination with other medicines to reduce side effects ) .
&quot; in total , in the main study 72 ( 31 % ) , the 229 patients treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane were treated to the treatment , compared to 37 ( 16 % ) of 225 patients receiving conventional pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el drugs . &quot;
&quot; considering only patients treated for the first time because of metastatic breast cancer , there was no difference between the efficacy indicators such as time to deteri@@ oration of the disease and survival . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , patients who previously had other treatments of their metastatic breast cancer showed that Abra@@ x@@ ane was more effective than conventional pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el drugs . &quot;
&quot; it may also not be used in patients who are breast@@ feeding , or before the treatment , low neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ils in the blood . &quot;
&quot; the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) noted that the treatment of Abra@@ x@@ ane in patients was more effective than conventional pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el drugs , and that it should not be given with other medicines in contrast to other pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el drugs to reduce side effects . &quot;
&quot; in January 2008 , the European Commission issued a permit to the company Abra@@ xis Bio@@ Science Limited for the transport of Abra@@ x@@ ane throughout the European Union . &quot;
&quot; Abra@@ x@@ ane mon@@ otherapy is indicated for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer in patients , where the first @-@ line treatment for metastatic disease is missing and for which a standard anth@@ rac@@ y@@ cl@@ ine @-@ containing therapy is not shown ( see also section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients with severe neut@@ rop@@ enia ( neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ils &lt; 0,50 x 109 / l over a period of one week or longer ) or severe sensory neu@@ rop@@ athy during the Abra@@ x@@ ane therapy , the dose should be reduced to 220 mg / m2 in subsequent series . &quot;
&quot; in sensory neu@@ rop@@ athy level 3 , the treatment is to be interrupted until an improvement is reached to grade 1 or 2 , and in all subsequent cycles the dose must be reduced . &quot;
there are currently no adequate data for the recommendation of dose adap@@ tations in patients with mild to moderate imp@@ airment of the liver function ( see section 4.@@ 4. and 5.2 ) .
no studies have been carried out with patients with imp@@ aired kidney function and there are currently no adequate data on the recommendation of dose adjustment in patients with imp@@ airment of kidney function ( see section 5.2 ) .
abra@@ x@@ ane is not recommended for use in children under 18 years due to insufficient data for harm@@ lessness and efficacy .
&quot; Abra@@ x@@ ane is an Alb@@ um@@ in @-@ bound nano @-@ artic@@ ulation of pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el , which could have substantially different pharmac@@ ological features than other form@@ ulations of pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el ( see Section 5.1 and 5.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; if an allergic reaction occurs , the medicine should be removed immediately and a sy@@ mpt@@ om@@ atic treatment is initiated and the patient may not be treated with pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el again . &quot;
&quot; in patients , no renewed abra@@ x@@ ane treatment cycles should be initiated until the neut@@ ro@@ phi@@ al number increased to &gt; 1.5 x 109 / l and the th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ tes increased again &gt; 100 x 109 / l . &quot;
patients with severe liver dysfunction ( bili@@ ru@@ bin &gt; 5 x UL@@ N or AS@@ L / AL@@ T &gt; 10 x UL@@ N ) should not be treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane .
&quot; while a clearly associated cardi@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity has not been detected , cardi@@ al incidents in the inde@@ xed patient body are not unusual , especially in patients with earlier anth@@ rac@@ y@@ cl@@ ine treatment or underlying heart or lung disease . &quot;
&quot; in case of patients after the gift of Abra@@ x@@ ane nau@@ sea , v@@ om@@ iting and di@@ arr@@ ho@@ ea , they can be treated with the usual anti @-@ em@@ etic and con@@ sti@@ p@@ ant remedies . &quot;
&quot; abra@@ x@@ ane should not be applied in pregnant women or women in chil@@ d@@ bearing age , which do not practice effective contra@@ ception , except the treatment of the mother with pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is unavoid@@ able . &quot;
women in chil@@ d@@ bearing age should apply a reliable contra@@ ception method during and up to 1 month after the treatment with Abra@@ x@@ ane .
&quot; males who are treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane will be advised , during and up to six months after the treatment is not a child . &quot;
&quot; in the treatment of Abra@@ x@@ ane , male patients should consult with Abra@@ x@@ ane the possibility of ir@@ reversible in@@ fertility . &quot;
&quot; abra@@ x@@ ane can cause side effects like ti@@ red@@ ness ( very common ) and di@@ zz@@ iness ( common ) , which can affect the transport and ability to serve machines . &quot;
&quot; below are the most common and most important incidents of side @-@ effects that occurred in 229 patients with metastatic breast cancer , which were treated once every three weeks with 260 mg / m2 of Abra@@ x@@ ane in the pi@@ vot@@ al phase III trial . &quot;
neut@@ rop@@ enia was the most con@@ spic@@ uous important hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity ( in 79 % of the patients reported ) and was quickly reversible and dose @-@ dependent ; leu@@ kop@@ enia was reported in 71 % of the patients .
an@@ emia ( H@@ b &lt; 10 g / dl ) was observed in 46 % of patients treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane and was severe in three cases ( H@@ b &lt; 8 g / dl ) .
table 1 shows the side effects associated with the gift of Abra@@ x@@ ane as mon@@ otherapy for each dose and indication in studies ( N = 7@@ 89 ) .
&quot; very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) ; common ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) ; very rare ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) ; very rare ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) . &quot;

pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is an anti@@ mi@@ kr@@ ot@@ ub@@ uli @-@ active ingredient that promotes the rel@@ ocation of mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules from the tub@@ ular indi@@ ces and stabili@@ zes the mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules due to in@@ hibition of their de@@ col@@ ori@@ zation .
&quot; this stabili@@ zation results in in@@ hibition of the normal dynamic re@@ organization of the mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ular network , which is essential for the vital inter@@ phase and the mit@@ otic cell functions . &quot;
it is known that Alb@@ um@@ in convey@@ s the trans@@ cy@@ t@@ sis of plasma components into the end@@ othel@@ ial cells and in the frame of in @-@ vitro studies it has been proven that the presence of Alb@@ um@@ in promotes the transport of pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el through the end@@ othel@@ ial cells .
it is assumed that this improved tran@@ sen@@ dot@@ hel@@ i@@ ale transport is convey@@ ed by the g@@ p @-@ 60 @-@ alb@@ umin@@ um@@ recep@@ tor and occurs due to the alb@@ umin@@ ous protein SP@@ ARC ( e@@ ye@@ et protein aci@@ dic rich in cy@@ steine ) a pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el accumulation in the area of the tumour .
the application of Abra@@ x@@ ane for metastatic breast cancer is supported by data of 106 patients in two single @-@ armed and 454 patients treated in a random@@ ized Phase III study study .
&quot; in a study , 43 patients with metastatic breast cancer were treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane , which was given in the form of an in@@ fusion of over 30 minutes with a dose of 175 mg / m2 . &quot;
in the second study a dose of 300 mg / m2 was used as in@@ fusion for about 30 minutes to 63 patients with metastatic breast cancer .
&quot; this multi@@ centr@@ alised study was performed in patients with metastatic breast cancer , which received a mon@@ otherapy with pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el every 3 weeks , either in form of solvent containing pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el 175 mg / m2 as a 3 @-@ hour in@@ fusion with prevention of an allergic reaction ( N = 225 ) or in the form of Abra@@ x@@ ane 260 mg / m2 as a 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion without pre@@ medit@@ ating ( N = 229 ) . &quot;
&quot; in the study , 64 % of patients had a negative general condition ( ECO@@ G 1 or 2 ) , 79 % had vis@@ cer@@ al metast@@ ases and 76 % had more than 3 metast@@ ases . &quot;
&quot; 14 % of patients had previously not received chemotherapy , 27 % had only a adju@@ v@@ ant chemotherapy , 40 % only because of metast@@ as@@ ation and 19 % due to metast@@ as@@ ation and adju@@ v@@ ant treatment . &quot;
&quot; 9 Results for general response rate and time to progression of disease , as well as progression @-@ free survival and survival for patients receiving first @-@ line treatment are below . &quot;
neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity compared to pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el was evaluated by the improvement of a degree for patients who experienced a periph@@ eral neu@@ rop@@ athy level 3 at a time during the therapy .
the natural course of periph@@ eral neu@@ rop@@ athy for b@@ illing on bas@@ eline due to the cum@@ ulative toxic@@ ity of Abra@@ x@@ ane after &gt; 6 treatment courses was not evaluated and remains unknown .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of the overall pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el after 30@@ - and 180 minutes in@@ fu@@ sions of Abra@@ x@@ ane with a dose of 80 to 375 mg / m2 was determined in clinical trials .
the substance exposition ( AU@@ C ) increased lin@@ early from 26@@ 53 to 16@@ 7@@ 36 n@@ g.@@ h / ml analog@@ ous to a dose of 80 to 300 mg / m2 .
10 After intra@@ ven@@ ous dose of Abra@@ x@@ ane in patients with metastatic breast cancer in the recommended clinical dose of 260 mg / m2 the pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el plasma concentration took off in a multi @-@ phase manner .
the average distribution volume was 6@@ 32 l / m2 ; the high distribution volume indicates a far @-@ reaching extra@@ v@@ ascular distribution and / or soft binding of pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
in a study with patients with advanced solid tum@@ ours the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el were compared with intra@@ ven@@ ous 30 minutes in@@ fusion of 260 mg / m2 of Abra@@ x@@ ane with the values after a 3 @-@ hour injection of 175 mg / m2 solution @-@ containing pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
&quot; the clearance of pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el was higher ( 43 % ) after the abra@@ x@@ ane level ( 43 % ) than after a solvent containing pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el injection , and the distribution volume was higher at Abra@@ x@@ ane ( 53 % ) . &quot;
&quot; in the published literature on in @-@ vitro studies of human liver micro@@ some and tissues , pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is primarily met@@ ab@@ oli@@ zed to 6@@ α -@@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el and two smaller metabol@@ ites ( 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el and 6@@ α -3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ D@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el ) . &quot;
&quot; after a 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion of 260 mg / m2 of Abra@@ x@@ ane in patients with metastatic breast cancer , the mean value for cum@@ ulative ure@@ a was 4 % of the given total dose with less than 1 % of metabol@@ ites 6@@ α -@@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el and 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el , indicating a far @-@ reaching non @-@ ren@@ al clearance . &quot;
&quot; however , only a few data are available about patients at the age of more than 75 years , as only 3 patients of this age group participated in pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic analysis . &quot;
the chemical and physical stability was detected at 2 ° C - 8 ° C in the original box and in front of light light over 8 hours .
pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is a cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic an@@ tic@@ ar@@ cin@@ ogenic medicine and as with other potentially toxic substances should be handled with caution when dealing with Abra@@ x@@ ane .
using a sterile sy@@ ringe is inj@@ ected slowly over a period of at least 1 minute 20 ml of a 9 mg / ml ( 0.9 % ) sodium chlori@@ de in@@ fusion solution into a Abra@@ x@@ ane hydr@@ o bottle .
&quot; after complete enc@@ ore of the solution , the feed @-@ in bottle should rest at least 5 minutes to ensure a good use of the solid material . &quot;

&quot; this means that Ab@@ se@@ amed is similar to a biological drug , which is already approved in the European Union ( EU ) and contains the same substance ( also called &quot; &quot; reference doctors &quot; &quot; ) . &quot;
&quot; it is used in patients with normal blood @-@ iron values , which may occur in connection with blood trans@@ fusion complications , if a blood trans@@ fusion is not possible , and in which a blood loss of 900 to 1 800 ml is expected . &quot;
the treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed must be initiated under the supervision of a doctor who has experience in treating patients with diseases that the medicine is indicated .
&quot; in patients with kidney problems and in patients who want to make their own blood donation , Ab@@ se@@ amed is inj@@ ected into a v@@ ein . &quot;
&quot; the injection may also be carried out by the patient or his super@@ visor , provided that they have received appropriate instructions . &quot;
&quot; in patients with chronic ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency and in patients receiving chemotherapy , the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in values should always be in the recommended range ( between 10 and 12 grams per dec@@ il@@ iter for adults or between 9.5 and 11 g / dl in children ) . &quot;
iron values of all patients are to be controlled prior to treatment to ensure that no iron deficiency exists and iron supplements should be administered throughout the treatment .
&quot; in patients receiving chemotherapy , or in patients with kidney problems , an@@ a@@ emia may be caused by an er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ i@@ etal deficiency or that the body does not adequately respond to the body &apos;s er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin . &quot;
er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin is also applied before surgery to increase the number of red blood cells and reduce the consequences of blood loss .
&quot; it is produced by a cell , into which a gene ( DNA ) has been brought to the formation of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa . &quot;
Ab@@ se@@ amed was compared with an injection into a v@@ ein as part of a main study involving 479 patients suffering from an@@ emia caused by kidney problems .
all patients participating in this study had been inj@@ ected at least eight weeks before using either Ab@@ se@@ amed or continued to receive E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
the main indicator for the efficacy was the change in the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in values between the beginning of the study and the evaluation period in weeks 25 to 29 .
the company also submitted the results of a study where the effects of hem@@ med Ab@@ se@@ amed with those of E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o were examined in 114 cancer patients receiving chemotherapy .
&quot; in the study with patients suffering from an@@ emia caused by kidney problems , the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in values of patients who were converted to Ab@@ sen@@ amed were maintained in the same degree as with those patients who continued to receive E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o . &quot;
&quot; in comparison , patients who continued to receive E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o showed an increase of 0.0@@ 63 g / dl of the initial value of 12.@@ 0 g / dl . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effect of Ab@@ se@@ amed is an increase in blood pressure , which can occasionally lead to symptoms of encephal@@ opathy ( brain problems ) such as sudden , sm@@ elling mig@@ raine head@@ aches and confusion . &quot;
Ab@@ se@@ amed should not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa or any of the other ingredients .
se@@ amed as an injection under the skin is not recommended to treat kidney problems as further studies are required to ensure that this does not trigger allergic reactions .
&quot; the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that for Ab@@ se@@ amed according to the provisions of the European Union , evidence was provided that the medicine has a comparable quality , safety and efficacy profile , such as E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o . &quot;
&quot; the company that produces Ab@@ se@@ amed will provide information packages for medical professionals in all Member States , including information on the safety of the drug . &quot;
&quot; in August 2007 , the European Commission informed the company Medi@@ ce Arzneimittel P@@ üt@@ ter GmbH &amp; Co KG with a permit for the placing of Ab@@ se@@ amed in the entire European Union . &quot;
&quot; treatment of an@@ a@@ emia and reduction of trans@@ fusion requirements in adults with solid tum@@ ours , mal@@ ign@@ ant lymph@@ oma or multi@@ ple@@ m my@@ el@@ oma who receive chemotherapy and where the risk of trans@@ fusion is due to the general condition ( for example cardiovascular status , pre @-@ existing an@@ a@@ emia in the beginning of chemotherapy ) . &quot;
&quot; the treatment should only be performed in patients with moderate an@@ a@@ emia ( hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in &#91; H@@ b &#93; 10 - 13 g / dl &#91; 6,@@ 2 - 8,@@ 1 m@@ mo@@ l / l &#93; , if blood @-@ saving measures are not available or inadequate , in case of planned larger surgical procedures that require large blood volume replacement ( 4 or more units of blood in men ) . &quot;
&quot; to reduce foreign blood , Ab@@ se@@ amed can be applied before a large elec@@ tive orthop@@ a@@ edic surgery in adults without iron deficiency , in which a high risk of trans@@ fusion complications can be expected . &quot;
&quot; HB 10 @-@ 13 g / dl ) and an expected blood loss of 900 @-@ 1800 ml , which cannot participate in an aut@@ olog@@ ous blood donation program . &quot;
the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration lies between 10 and 12 g / dl ( 6.2 - 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) except for pedi@@ atric patients in which the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in concentration should lie between 9.5 and 11 g / dl ( 5.@@ 9 - 6.8 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
&quot; symptoms and symptoms may vary depending on age , gender and overall disease ; therefore , the assessment of the individual clinical course and disease condition is required by the doctor . &quot;
an increase in hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in by more than 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) over a period of four weeks should be avoided .
&quot; due to the vari@@ ability between patients , individual hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in values can be observed on or below the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target . &quot;
&quot; given this hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in vari@@ ability , a corresponding dose management should be attempted to achieve the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration of 10 g / dl ( 6.2 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) up to 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) . &quot;
&quot; if the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value is increased by more than 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month , or if the permanent hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value reaches 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , the epo@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa dose is reduced by 25 % . &quot;
&quot; patients should be closely monitored to ensure that epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is applied in the lowest approved dose , which is required for the control of an@@ a@@ emia and angi@@ ogenic symptoms . &quot;
the present clinical results suggest that patients with initially very low H@@ b value ( &lt; 6 g / dl or &lt; 3.@@ 75 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) may require higher maintenance doses than patients where initial an@@ a@@ emia is less difficult ( H@@ b &gt; 8 g / dl or &gt; 5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
&quot; the present clinical results suggest that patients with initially very low H@@ b value ( &lt; 6,@@ 8 g / dl or &lt; 4,@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) may need higher maintenance doses than patients where initial an@@ a@@ emia is less difficult ( H@@ b &gt; 6,@@ 8 g / dl or &gt; 4,@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) . &quot;
starting dose 50 I.@@ U. / kg three times a week by means of intra@@ ven@@ ous application if necessary with a dose increase of 25 I.@@ U. / kg ( three times per week ) until the desired target value is reached ( this should be done in steps of at least 4 weeks ) .
&quot; additional symptoms may vary depending on age , gender and overall disease ; therefore , the assessment of the individual clinical course and disease condition is required by the doctor . &quot;
&quot; given this hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in vari@@ ability , a corresponding dose management should be attempted to achieve the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration of 10 g / dl ( 6.2 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) up to 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) . &quot;
&quot; patients should be closely monitored to ensure that epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is applied in the lowest approved dose , which is required for control of the angi@@ ogenic symptoms . &quot;
&quot; if after 4 treatment weeks of the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value increased by at least 1 g / dl ( 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) or the re@@ tic@@ u@@ lo@@ cy@@ te number increased by ≥ 40.000 cells / µ@@ l compared to the initial value , the dose should be maintained three times a week or 450 I.@@ E. / kg once a week . &quot;
&quot; if the ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in rose &lt; 1 g / dl ( &lt; 0,@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and the re@@ tic@@ u@@ lo@@ cy@@ te number &lt; 4@@ 0,000 cells / µ@@ l have risen to the initial value , the dose should be raised to 300 I.@@ E. / kg three times a week . &quot;
&quot; if after another 4 weeks of treatment with 300 I.@@ E. / kg three times a week of the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value of ≥ 1 g / dl ( ≥ 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) or the re@@ tic@@ u@@ lo@@ cy@@ te number increased by ≥ 40.000 cells / µ@@ l , the dose should be maintained three times a week . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , the ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ al value of &lt; 1 g / dl ( &lt; 0,@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) or the re@@ tic@@ u@@ loid number increased by &lt; 4@@ 0,000 cells / µ@@ l compared to the initial value , is a response to epo@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa @-@ therapy unlikely and the treatment should be ab@@ orted . &quot;
patients with mild an@@ a@@ emia ( ha@@ em@@ ato@@ cri@@ t 33 - 39 % ) in which the precau@@ tionary storage of ≥ 4 blood c@@ anned foods is required should receive Ab@@ se@@ amed in a dose of 600 I.@@ E. / kg body weight twice a week for 3 weeks before surgical procedure .
iron sub@@ stitution should be started as early as possible - for example several weeks before the start of aut@@ olog@@ ous blood donation programme - to enable large iron reserves before the outbreak of the Ab@@ se@@ amed therapy .
&quot; 6 The recommended dosage is 600 I.@@ E. / kg epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa , which should be given once a week for three weeks ( day 21 , 14 and 7 ) before the surgery and on the day of the surgery ( day 0 ) . &quot;
&quot; epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa should be pre@@ oper@@ atively 300 I.@@ E. / kg every 10 consecutive days , on the day of the surgery and 4 days immediately afterwards . &quot;
&quot; alternatively , the injection at the end of di@@ aly@@ sis can be given over the hose of a fi@@ st@@ ula , followed by 10 ml is@@ ot@@ onic sal@@ ine solution to rin@@ se the hose and ensure an adequate injection of the medicine in the circulation . &quot;
&quot; patients suffering from the treatment with some er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ tin ( Pure Red Cell A@@ pl@@ asia , PR@@ CA ) should not receive Ab@@ se@@ amed or other er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ tin ( see section 4.4 - er@@ y@@ thro@@ bla@@ stom@@ en@@ ie ) . &quot;
&quot; heart attack or stroke within one month before the treatment , un@@ stable ang@@ ina pec@@ tor@@ is , increased risk of deep ven@@ ous cl@@ ams ( e.g. an@@ am@@ nes@@ tic known ven@@ ous th@@ rom@@ bo@@ em@@ bo@@ lia ) . &quot;
&quot; the application of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is contra@@ indicated in the following pre@@ - , con@@ du@@ ci@@ ve or cer@@ eb@@ rov@@ ascular disease in patients suffering from an aut@@ olog@@ ous blood donation programme : severe cor@@ on@@ ary heart disease , periph@@ eral arter@@ ial occ@@ uring disease , v@@ ascular disease of car@@ ot@@ ics or cer@@ eb@@ rov@@ ascular event . &quot;
er@@ y@@ thro@@ bla@@ stop@@ en@@ ie ( PR@@ CA ) Very rarely has been reported about the occurrence of an antibody medi@@ ated PR@@ CA after months of treatment with sub@@ cut@@ aneous er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ tin .
&quot; in patients with sudden re@@ active loss , defined as reduction of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in values ( 1 - 2 g / dl per month ) with increased need for trans@@ fu@@ sions , the re@@ tic@@ u@@ loid is determined and the usual causes for a non @-@ contact ( iron , fo@@ lic acid or vitamin B@@ 12 deficiency , aluminum chlori@@ de , infections or inflammation , blood loss and ha@@ em@@ oly@@ sis ) are examined . &quot;
&quot; if the re@@ tic@@ ule value , taking into account the an@@ a@@ emia ( i.e. the re@@ tic@@ u@@ lo@@ cy@@ te index ) , is degra@@ ded ( &lt; 20,000 / mm@@ 3 or &lt; 0,5 % ) , the anti @-@ er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ tin antibodies should be determined and an investigation of bone mar@@ row should be weigh@@ ed for diagnosis of a PR@@ CA . &quot;
the data for immun@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity in sub@@ cut@@ aneous use of Ab@@ se@@ amed in patients with a risk of an antibody @-@ induced PR@@ CA ( patients with ren@@ al an@@ emia ) are not sufficient .
&quot; 8 In patients with chronic ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency , the upper limit of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration should not be exceeded in section 4.2 . &quot;
in clinical trials an increased risk of mort@@ ality and risk of severe cardiovascular events were observed when er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ esis stimul@@ ates active substances ( ESA ) were given with a hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration of over 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
controlled clinical studies have shown no significant benefit to be attributed to the gift of epo@@ et@@ ins when the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in concentration is elevated above the concentration required for control of angi@@ ogenic symptoms and the avo@@ idance of blood trans@@ fu@@ sions .
the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in intake should amount to about 1 g / dl ( 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month and should not exceed 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month to minimize the risk of an increase in hyper@@ tension .
&quot; in patients with chronic ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency and clin@@ ically evi@@ denti@@ fied cor@@ on@@ ary heart disease or con@@ ges@@ tion in@@ suffici@@ ency , the upper limit of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration should not be exceeded in section 4.2 . &quot;
&quot; according to the present findings , treatment of an@@ a@@ emia with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa in adults with ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency , which are not even di@@ aly@@ sis , will not accelerate the progression of ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency . &quot;
patients with chemotherapy should be considered a 2 - 3 @-@ week delay between epo@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa @-@ gift and er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ tin response ( patients who need to be trans@@ fun@@ ci@@ ated ) .
&quot; if the H@@ b increase is exceeded 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month or a h@@ b value of 13 g / dl ( 8,@@ 1 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , the dose must be adjusted in accordance with Section 4.2 in order to minimize the risk of possible th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic events ( see section 4.2 Treatment of patients with chemotherapy @-@ related an@@ emia - dosage adjustment with the goal of keeping the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value between 10 g / dl and 12 g / dl ) . &quot;
&quot; the decision for the application of re@@ combin@@ ant er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ et@@ ine should be based on a benefit @-@ risk assessment , taking into account the specific clinical context . &quot;
&quot; in patients en@@ vis@@ aged for a larger elec@@ tive orthop@@ edic surgery , if possible , before the beginning of epo@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa treatment , the cause of an@@ a@@ emia is examined and treated accordingly . &quot;
&quot; patients who undergo a larger elec@@ tive orthop@@ edic surgery should receive appropriate th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis proph@@ yla@@ xis , as they have an increased risk of th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic and v@@ ascular diseases , particularly with a underlying cardiovascular disease . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it cannot be ruled out that treatment with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa for patients with an initial example of &gt; 13 g / dl may be an increased risk of post@@ operative th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic / v@@ ascular events . &quot;
&quot; in several controlled studies , epo@@ et@@ ins did not prove that patients with sy@@ mpt@@ om@@ atic an@@ emia can improve overall survival or reduce the risk of tumor progression . &quot;
4 months in patients with metastatic breast cancer receiving chemotherapy when a hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration of 12 - 14 g / dl ( 7.5 - 8.7 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) was targeted
&quot; if epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is used together with c@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in , the blood levels of C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in should be controlled and the c@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in dose should be adjusted to the increasing hem@@ at@@ oc@@ yst . &quot;
&quot; in vitro studies on tumor tissues , there is no indication of an interaction between epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa and G @-@ C@@ SF or GM @-@ C@@ SF regarding hem@@ at@@ ological differentiation or prolifer@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; on th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic , v@@ ascular events like m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al emia , m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ cts , cer@@ eb@@ rov@@ ascular events ( brain ha@@ em@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ sis , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ oses , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ oses , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ oses , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ oses , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ oses , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ oses , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ oses , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ oses , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ oses , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ oses , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ oses , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ oses , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ oses , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ oses , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ oses , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ oses , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ oses , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ oses , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ oses , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ oses , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ oses , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ oses , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ oses , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ oses , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ oses , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ oses , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ oses , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ oses , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ oses , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ oses , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ oses , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ oses , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ oses , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ oses , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ oses , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ oses , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ oses , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ oses , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ oses , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ oses , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ oses , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ oses , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ oses , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ oses , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ oses , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ oses , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ oses , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ oses , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ oses , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ oses , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ oses , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ oses ,
the most common side effect during treatment with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is a dose @-@ dependent increase in blood pressure or the deteri@@ oration of an existing hyper@@ tension .
increased incidence of th@@ rom@@ bo@@ v@@ ascular events ( see section 4.4 and section 4.8 - General ) was observed in patients under treatment with er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ et@@ ines .
&quot; regardless of er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ tin treatment , surgical patients with cardiovascular atro@@ phy after repeated blood donations will come to th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic and v@@ ascular complications . &quot;
&quot; the gene@@ tically obtained epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is gly@@ co@@ si@@ sted and is identical to the endo@@ genous human er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ tin , which was isolated from the urine of an@@ a@@ stral patients . &quot;
it could be shown using cultures of human bone mar@@ row cells that epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa specifically stimul@@ ates er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ esis and does not affect leu@@ kop@@ o@@ esis .
&quot; 389 patients with ha@@ em@@ bla@@ stom@@ a ( 221 multiple my@@ el@@ omes , 144 non @-@ Ho@@ dg@@ kin &apos;s lymph@@ omas and 24 other ha@@ em@@ bla@@ stom@@ osis ) and 332 patients with solid tum@@ ours ( 172 mam@@ ma@@ car@@ cin@@ omas , 23 prostate car@@ cin@@ omas , 22 prostate car@@ cin@@ omas , 21 g@@ astro@@ intestinal car@@ cin@@ omas and 30 more ) . &quot;
&quot; 1895 patients with solid tum@@ ours ( 683 Mam@@ ma@@ car@@ cin@@ omas , 260 bron@@ chi@@ al car@@ cin@@ omas , 174 gy@@ na@@ ecological tum@@ ours , 300 g@@ astro@@ intestinal tum@@ ors and 478 others ) and 8@@ 02 patients with hem@@ o@@ blast . &quot;
survival and tumor progression were examined in five large controlled trials with 28@@ 33 patients ; four of these studies were double @-@ blind plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled studies and
in the open study there was no difference in overall survival among patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ tin patients and the control patients .
&quot; in these studies , patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ tin were consistent with an@@ a@@ emia due to various common mal@@ ign@@ ancies consistent , statisti@@ cally significant higher mort@@ ality than in controls . &quot;
overall survival in the studies could not be explained by differences in the incidence of thro@@ mb@@ oses and related complications in patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ tin patients .
&quot; there is an increased risk of th@@ rom@@ bo@@ lic events in tumor patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ tin , and a negative effect on overall survival cannot be ruled out . &quot;
&quot; it is not clear how far these results are applied to the application of re@@ combin@@ ant human er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ tin in tumour patients receiving chemotherapy with the aim of achieving a hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value below 13 g / dl , since too few patients with these characteristics were included in the reviewed data . &quot;
epo@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa regulations after repeated intra@@ ven@@ ous application showed a half @-@ life of about 4 hours in healthy volunteers and a slightly prolonged half @-@ life of about 5 hours in patients with kidney failure .
&quot; after sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection , epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa ser@@ um levels are much lower than the ser@@ um levels that are achieved after intra@@ ven@@ ous injection . &quot;
&quot; there is no cum@@ ulation : the ser@@ um levels remain the same , regardless of whether they are determined 24 hours after the first gift or 24 hours after the last gift . &quot;
bone mar@@ row fibro@@ sis is a well known comp@@ lication of chronic ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency in humans and could be due to a secondary hyper@@ par@@ ath@@ y@@ re@@ o@@ idi@@ sm or unknown factors .
&quot; in a study of hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis patients who were treated with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa in three years , the incidence of bone mar@@ row fibro@@ sis was not increased compared to the control group with di@@ aly@@ sis patients , which were not treated with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa . &quot;
&quot; 14 In animal experiments with nearly the 20@@ fold of the weekly dose , epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa led to dimin@@ ished federal body weight , to a delay of the Os@@ si@@ fication and an increase in federal mort@@ ality . &quot;
&quot; these reports are based on in vitro diagnostics with cells from human tumor tissues , which are of uncertain significance for the clinical situation . &quot;
&quot; as part of the out@@ patient application , the patient can store Ab@@ se@@ amed for a period of a maximum of 3 days outside the refrigerator and not above 25 ° C. &quot;
&quot; sy@@ ring@@ es are provided with gradu@@ ation rings and the filling volume is indicated by a glu@@ ed label , so if necessary , the measurement of particles is possible . &quot;
the treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed must be initiated under the supervision of doctors who have experience in treating patients with the indications listed above .
&quot; 21 The recommended dosage is 600 I.@@ E. / kg epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa , which should be given once a week for three weeks ( day 21 , 14 and 7 ) before the surgery and on the day of the surgery ( day 0 ) . &quot;
&quot; 23 In patients with chronic ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency , the upper limit of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration should not be exceeded in section 4.2 . &quot;
the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in intake should amount to about 1 g / dl ( 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month and should not exceed 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month to minimize the risk of an increase in hyper@@ tension .

&quot; in addition , an updated R@@ MP should be submitted : • in receiving new information , the influence on the current safety specifications ( Safety Speci@@ fication ) , the pharmac@@ ovi@@ gil@@ ance plan or the risk reduction measures concerned , within 60 days after reaching an important ( pharmac@@ ovi@@ gil@@ ance or risk reduction ) . &quot;
&quot; • suffered a cardiac inf@@ ar@@ ction or stroke during one month before your treatment • If you suffer from un@@ stable ang@@ ina pec@@ tor@@ is ( for the first time or intensi@@ fied breast pain ) , there is a risk of a drop of blood in the veins ( deep ven@@ ous thro@@ mb@@ oses ) , for example , in the past , such a drop of blood has occurred . &quot;
&quot; you suffer from severe blood circulation disorders ( cor@@ on@@ ary heart disease ) , arter@@ ies of legs or arms ( periph@@ eral arter@@ ial occ@@ lu@@ sion ) , the sore throat ( v@@ ascular disease of the car@@ oti@@ des ) or brain ( cer@@ eb@@ rov@@ ascular disease ) have recently suffered a heart attack or stroke . &quot;
&quot; during the treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed , it may occur within the normal range to a slight dose @-@ dependent rise in the number of plat@@ el@@ ets , which re@@ acts with further treatment . &quot;
your doctor will possibly perform regular blood tests to regularly check the number of plat@@ el@@ ets during the first 8 weeks of treatment .
&quot; iron deficiency , dis@@ solution of red blood cells ( hem@@ oly@@ sis ) , blood loss , vitamin B@@ 12 or acid deficiency , should be taken into account and treated before the treatment begins with Ab@@ se@@ amed . &quot;
very rare was reported about the occurrence of an an@@ tic@@ ated er@@ y@@ thro@@ bla@@ stom@@ p@@ ie after months to years of treatment with sub@@ cut@@ aneous ( skin moul@@ ded ) er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ tin .
&quot; if you suffer from er@@ y@@ thro@@ bla@@ stop@@ en@@ ie , it will ab@@ ort your therapy with Ab@@ sen@@ amed and determine how your an@@ a@@ emia is best handled . &quot;
&quot; therefore , Ab@@ se@@ amed must be given by injection into a v@@ ein ( intra@@ ven@@ ous ) if you are treated for an@@ a@@ emia due to a kidney disease . &quot;
a high ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ bi makes the risk of problems with the heart or blood vessels and the risk of dying could be increased .
&quot; for increased or increasing pot@@ assium , your doctor may consider an inter@@ ruption of treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed until the pot@@ assium levels lie in the normal range . &quot;
&quot; if you suffer from chronic kidney disease and clin@@ ically obvious cor@@ on@@ ary heart disease or dust mark by inadequate heart rate , your doctor will ensure that your hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in level does not exceed a certain value . &quot;
&quot; according to the present findings , the treatment of blood poverty with Ab@@ se@@ amed in adults with chronic kidney failure ( ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency ) , which are not even di@@ aly@@ sis , will not accelerate the progression of ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency . &quot;
a 2 - 3 @-@ week delay between epo@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa @-@ gift and desired effect should be considered for ass@@ essing the effectiveness of Ab@@ se@@ amed .
200 your doctor will regularly determine your values of the red blood dy@@ e ( hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in ) and adapt your offspring dose accordingly to minimize the risk of blood gra@@ fting ( th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic event ) as low as possible .
&quot; this risk should be weigh@@ ed very carefully over the advantages derived from the treatment with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa , especially if you are an increased risk of th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic v@@ ascular events , e.g. if you have an increased risk of th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic v@@ ascular events ( e.g. a deep ven@@ eer or lung em@@ bol@@ ism ) . &quot;
&quot; if you are cancer patients , consider that Ab@@ se@@ amed is like a growth factor for blood cells and under certain circumstances can neg@@ atively affect the tumor . &quot;
&quot; if a major orthop@@ edic operation lies ahead , the cause of your an@@ a@@ emia should be examined before the treatment starts and treated accordingly . &quot;
&quot; if your values of red blood dy@@ e ( ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in ) are too high , you should not receive Ab@@ se@@ amed as an increased risk of blood gra@@ fting after surgery . &quot;
&quot; please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you are taking other medicines or used recently , even if it is not prescription medicine . &quot;
&quot; if you take C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( means of supp@@ ression of the immune system ) during your therapy with Ab@@ sen@@ amed , your doctor may arrange certain blood tests to measure the blood levels of C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in . &quot;
&quot; laboratory tests have shown no interaction between epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa and G @-@ C@@ SF or GM @-@ C@@ SF ( G @-@ C@@ SF and GM @-@ C@@ SF are means to build up the immune system , e.g. in onc@@ ology or HIV ) . &quot;
&quot; depending on how your an@@ emia is concerned , the dose can be adjusted for approximately every four weeks until your condition is under control . &quot;
your doctor will arrange regular blood tests to check the success and ensure that the drug works properly and your hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value does not exceed a certain value .
&quot; once you are well adjusted , you will receive regular doses of se@@ amed between 25 and 50 I.@@ U. / kg twice a week , distributed on two equally large inj@@ ections . &quot;
&quot; your doctor will arrange regular blood tests if necessary , to check the success and ensure that your hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value does not exceed a certain value . &quot;
&quot; depending on how an@@ a@@ emia refers to treatment , the dose can be adjusted for approximately every four weeks until the condition is under control . &quot;
&quot; to ensure this and ensure that the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value does not exceed a certain value , the doctor will conduct regular blood tests . &quot;
&quot; if it is necessary to sh@@ orten treatment time before surgery , a dose of 300 I.@@ E. / kg may be given at 10 consecutive days before surgery , on the day of surgery and another 4 days after surgery . &quot;
&quot; however , if your doctor thinks this is appropriate , you can also learn how to spray Ab@@ se@@ amed yourself under the skin . &quot;

ac@@ la@@ sta is used to treat the following illnesses : oste@@ opor@@ osis ( a disease that makes bone br@@ ittle ) both in women after men@@ op@@ ause and in men .
&quot; it is applied in patients with a high fra@@ cture risk ( frac@@ tures ) , including in patients who recently suffered a minor hip fra@@ cture such as the H@@ inf@@ all ; • Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the bone , a disease that changes the normal course of bone growth . &quot;
&quot; in addition , patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get should take at least 500 mg of calcium twice daily for at least 10 days after the treatment ; patients with hip frac@@ tures should receive a large dose of vitamin D ( 50 000 to 125 000 IE ) oral or administered by injection into a muscle . &quot;
&quot; the administration of acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ( means of inflammation ) shortly after the application of Ac@@ la@@ sta can reduce the symptoms occurring in the three days following the in@@ fusion , such as fever , muscle pain , flu @-@ like symptoms , joint pain and head@@ aches . &quot;
&quot; to treat Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , Ac@@ la@@ sta can only be prescribed by doctors who have experience in treating this disease . &quot;
&quot; as the active ingredient in Ac@@ la@@ sta is the same as in Z@@ omet@@ a , a part of the data material for Z@@ omet@@ a was used to evaluate Ac@@ la@@ sta . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; the second study included 2 127 men and women with oste@@ opor@@ osis over 50 years , who recently suffered a hip fra@@ cture ; the number of frac@@ tures was examined over a period of up to five years . &quot;
&quot; at Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , Ac@@ la@@ sta was tested in two studies involving 357 patients and compared six months with ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate ( a different bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate ) . &quot;
&quot; the main indicator of the efficacy was , if the content of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase in the ser@@ um ( an enzyme that de@@ construc@@ ts bone substance ) in the blood again norm@@ alized or decreased by at least 75 % compared to the bas@@ eline value . &quot;
&quot; in the study with older women , the risk of spinal frac@@ tures in patients with Ac@@ la@@ sta ( without other oste@@ opor@@ os@@ em@@ edi@@ cine ) was reduced by 70 % over a period of three years versus plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; compared to all patients under Ac@@ la@@ sta ( with or without other oste@@ opor@@ osis treatment ) , the risk of hip frac@@ tures was reduced by 41 % . &quot;
&quot; in the study with men and women with hip fra@@ cture , 9 % of patients under Ac@@ la@@ sta had a Fra@@ ktur ( 92 of 1 0@@ 65 ) compared to 13 % of the patients with plac@@ ebo ( 139 of 1 0@@ 62 ) . &quot;
most of the side effects of Ac@@ la@@ sta occur within the first three days after in@@ fusion and are less frequent in repeated in@@ fu@@ sions .
ac@@ la@@ sta may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid or other bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate or any of the other ingredients .
&quot; as with all bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates , patients with Ac@@ la@@ sta are subject to the risk of kidney disease , reactions to the in@@ fusion and oste@@ o@@ arthritis ( death of bone tissue ) in the jaw . &quot;
&quot; the manufacturer of Ac@@ la@@ sta provides information for physicians who prescri@@ be Ac@@ la@@ sta for the treatment of oste@@ opor@@ osis , as well as similar material for patients in which the side effects of the drug are explained and pointed out when they should contact the doctor . &quot;
&quot; in April 2005 , the European Commission issued a permit to the company Nov@@ arti@@ s Euro@@ ph@@ arm Limited for the launch of Ac@@ la@@ sta in the entire European Union . &quot;

&quot; treatment of oste@@ opor@@ osis in post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women and in men with increased risk of frac@@ tures , including patients with a recently suffered low @-@ traumatic les@@ hip fra@@ cture . &quot;
&quot; the patient information package should be provided and the following core messages include : • In@@ contr@@ ation in pregnancy and breast@@ feeding women • Re@@ quired of adequate intake of calcium and vitamin D , appropriate physical activity , non @-@ smoking and a healthy diet • Import@@ ant signs and symptoms for serious side effects • When to resort to medical or nursing care &quot;
&quot; treatment of oste@@ opor@@ osis • for post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women • in men with increased risk of frac@@ tures , including patients with a recently suffered low @-@ traumatic les@@ hip fra@@ cture . &quot;
intra@@ ven@@ ous in@@ fusion of 5 mg Ac@@ la@@ sta is recommended once a year for the treatment of post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis and oste@@ opor@@ osis in men .
&quot; in patients with a low @-@ traumatic stress fra@@ cture , the administration of the in@@ fusion of Ac@@ la@@ sta is recommended two or more weeks after the operative supply of the hip frac@@ tures ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
&quot; for the treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , Ac@@ la@@ sta should only be prescribed by doctors who have experience in the treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get . &quot;
&quot; after treatment of the Pa@@ get treatment with Ac@@ la@@ sta , a long period of re@@ mission was observed in patients who responded to therapy ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it is very advisable to ensure sufficient supply of calcium in patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , according to twice daily at least 500 mg of elementary calcium , for at least 10 days after the gift of Ac@@ la@@ sta ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients with a low @-@ traumatic stress fra@@ cture , an initial dose of 50,000 to 12@@ 5,000 I.@@ E. or@@ ally or in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular vitamin D is recommended before the first ac@@ la@@ sta in@@ fusion . &quot;
&quot; the frequency of symptoms that occur within the first three days after the administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta can be reduced by using acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen , shortly after the application of Ac@@ la@@ sta . &quot;
patients with kidney function disorder ( see section 4.4 ) In patients with a Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min Ac@@ la@@ sta is not recommended because limited clinical experience exists for this patient group .
&quot; older patients ( ≥ 65 years ) A dose adjustment is not necessary because the bio@@ availability , distribution and elimination of older patients is similar to younger patients . &quot;
children and young people Ac@@ la@@ sta are not recommended for children and adolescents under 18 years of age as data are missing for harm@@ lessness and efficacy .
&quot; Ac@@ la@@ sta is not recommended in patients with severe kidney failure ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min ) , because only limited clinical experiences are available for this patient population . &quot;
an existing hypo@@ kal@@ z@@ a@@ emia is to be treated before the beginning of the therapy with Ac@@ la@@ sta with sufficient intake of calcium and vitamin D ( see section 4.3 ) .
&quot; due to the rapid inser@@ tion of the effect of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ lic acid on bone structure , a temporary , sometimes sy@@ mpt@@ om@@ atic hypo@@ kal@@ emia can develop , whose maximum occurs usually within the first 10 days following the in@@ fusion of Ac@@ la@@ sta ( see section 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it is very advisable to ensure sufficient supply of calcium in patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , according to twice daily at least 500 mg of elementary calcium , for at least 10 days after the gift of Ac@@ la@@ sta ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; cancer disease , chemotherapy , treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , poor oral hygiene ) should be weigh@@ ed before an application of bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates with appropriate preventive dental treatment . &quot;
&quot; for patients who require dental gri@@ ps , no data is available whether the inter@@ ruption of treatment with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates reduces the risk of oste@@ o@@ arthritis in the jaw area . &quot;
the clinical assessment by the attending physician should be the basis for the treatment plan of each patient and based on an individual benefit risk assessment .
&quot; the frequency of symptoms that occur within the first three days after the administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta can be reduced by using acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen , shortly after the application of Ac@@ la@@ sta ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; the incidence of severe side effects reported by atri@@ al fibr@@ ill@@ ation was increased ( 1.3 % ) ( 51 of 3,@@ 8@@ 62 ) compared to patients receiving plac@@ ebo ( 0,6 % ) ( 22 of 3,@@ 8@@ 52 ) . &quot;
&quot; oste@@ opor@@ osis studies ( PFT , HOR@@ I@@ Z@@ ON - Recur@@ rent Fra@@ cture Trial &#91; R@@ FT &#93; ) was the overall incidence of atri@@ al fibr@@ ill@@ ation between Ac@@ la@@ sta ( 2.6 % ) and plac@@ ebo ( 2.1 % ) . &quot;
&quot; frequent ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , frequent ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasional ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) adverse drug interactions are listed in table 1 . &quot;
kidney dysfunction Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ lic acid was associated with kidney dysfunction ( i.e. an increase in ser@@ um cre@@ atine ) and in rare cases referred to as acute kidney failure .
the change in the Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance ( measured every year before the administration ) and the occurrence of kidney failure as well as a limited ren@@ al function were in a clinical study for oste@@ opor@@ osis over three years comparable between the plac@@ ebo group and the plac@@ ebo group .
a temporary increase in the Ser@@ um Kre@@ at@@ in@@ ine was observed at 1.8 % of patients treated with ac@@ la@@ sta to 0.8 % of patients treated with plac@@ ebo .
&quot; based on the evaluation of the laboratory findings , the temporary asy@@ mpt@@ om@@ atic calcium values , which were below the normal fluctu@@ ation range ( less than 2,@@ 10 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) showed patients treated with Ac@@ la@@ sta in a large clinical study compared to 21 % of patients treated with Ac@@ la@@ sta in the patients treated with Ac@@ la@@ sta . &quot;
&quot; all patients received sufficient amounts of vitamin D and calcium in the study for post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis , in the study to avoid clinical frac@@ tures following a hip fra@@ cture and in the disease Pa@@ get studies ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; in the study to avoid clinical frac@@ tures after a recent inc@@ ision , the vitamin D mirror was not rout@@ inely measured , but the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D before the administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; local reactions after the administration of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ lic acid in a large clinical trial was reported by local reactions to the in@@ fusion site , such as red@@ ness , swelling and / or pain , reported ( 0.7 % ) . &quot;
&quot; oste@@ o@@ arthritis in the or@@ tho@@ don@@ tic area , especially in cancer patients , about oste@@ o@@ ec@@ ro@@ ses ( primary in the jaw area ) reported that they were treated with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates , including Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid . &quot;
&quot; many of these patients had signs of local infections including oste@@ omyel@@ itis , and most of the reports refer to cancer patients after tooth extraction or other dental attacks . &quot;
&quot; 7 A study with 7,@@ 7@@ 36 patients showed oste@@ o@@ arthritis in the jaw area in a patient treated with Ac@@ la@@ sta and in a patient treated with plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in the case of over@@ dosing , which leads to a clin@@ ically relevant hypo@@ kal@@ z@@ a@@ emia , a compensation can be obtained by using oral calcium and / or an intra@@ ven@@ ous in@@ fusion of calcium glu@@ con@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; clinical efficacy in post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis ( PFT ) The efficacy and safety of Ac@@ la@@ sta 5 mg once a year for 3 consecutive years was shown in post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women ( 7,@@ 7@@ 36 women aged between 65 and 89 years ) with either a bone density , ≤ -@@ 2.5 with or without signs of an existing vert@@ ebral fra@@ cture . &quot;
effects on morph@@ ometric fluid frac@@ tures prev@@ ailed significantly over a period of three years and after one year the incidence of one or more new vert@@ ebral frac@@ tures ( see table 2 ) .
Ac@@ la@@ sta @-@ treated patients aged 75 years and older had a 60 % reduced risk of vert@@ ebral frac@@ tures compared with plac@@ ebo @-@ patients ( p &lt; 0.0@@ 001 ) .
&quot; effects on the Ac@@ la@@ sta hip frac@@ tures showed a consistent effect over three years , resulting in a reduced 41 % ( 95 % CI , 17 % to 58 % ) reduced risk of hip frac@@ tures . &quot;
&quot; effect on bone density ( BM@@ D ) Ac@@ la@@ sta raised bone density on lum@@ bar vert@@ eb@@ ra , hip , and the dist@@ al radius compared with plac@@ ebo treatment significantly at all times ( 6 , 12 , 24 and 36 months ) . &quot;
&quot; 9 increase of bone density of the lum@@ bar spine by 6.7 % , the entire hip by 6.0 % , of the thig@@ h by 5.1 % and the dist@@ al radius by 3.2 % . &quot;
bone hist@@ ology At 152 post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ otic patients treated with ac@@ la@@ sta ( N = 82 ) or plac@@ ebo ( N = 70 ) were taken one year after the third annual dose of bone bi@@ op@@ si@@ es from the pel@@ vis .
a micro@@ computer tom@@ ography ( µ@@ CT ) analysis showed patients treated with Ac@@ la@@ sta in comparison to plac@@ ebo an increase in trab@@ ecular bon@@ ing and the preservation of trab@@ ec@@ ul@@ ous bone architecture .
bone replacement mark@@ ers The bone @-@ specific alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase ( B@@ SAP ) - the N @-@ terminal Pro@@ pep@@ tide of the type I@@ - col@@ lagen ( P@@ 1@@ NP ) in ser@@ um and the beta @-@ C tel@@ op@@ ep@@ ti@@ d ( b @-@ CT@@ x ) in ser@@ um were determined in sub @-@ groups of 517 to 1.@@ 246 patients in peri@@ odic intervals during the study period .
&quot; after 12 months , the treatment with an annual 5 mg dose Ac@@ la@@ sta was significantly reduced by 30 % compared to the initial value and was held at 28 % below the initial value to 36 months . &quot;
P@@ 1@@ NP was significantly reduced by 61 % below the initial value after 12 months and was kept at 52 % below the initial value up to 36 months .
B @-@ CT@@ x was significantly reduced by 61 % below the bas@@ eline after 12 months and was kept at 55 % below the initial value up to 36 months .
&quot; the vitamin D levels were not rout@@ inely measured , but the majority of patients received an initial dosage of vitamin D ( 50,000 to 12@@ 5,000 I.@@ E. or@@ ally or in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular ) 2 weeks before in@@ fusion . &quot;
&quot; total mort@@ ality was 10 % ( 101 patients ) in the group treated with Ac@@ la@@ sta , compared with 13 % ( 141 patients ) in the plac@@ ebo group . &quot;
effect on bone mineral density ( BM@@ D ) In the HOR@@ I@@ Z@@ ON @-@ R@@ FT study increased the Ac@@ la@@ sta treatment compared to plac@@ ebo treatment compared to plac@@ ebo treatment by BM@@ D at all times .
&quot; over 24 months in comparison with plac@@ ebo treatment , the Ac@@ la@@ sta treatment resulted in an increase of the BM@@ D by 5.4 % in total and 4.3 % higher than the plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; clinical efficacy in men In the HOR@@ I@@ Z@@ ON R@@ FT study , 508 men were random@@ ised and in 185 patients the BM@@ D was assessed after 24 months . &quot;
the study was not designed to show a reduction in clinical frac@@ tures in men ; the incidence of clinical frac@@ tures was 7.5 % compared to 8.7 % in plac@@ ebo .
&quot; in another study in men ( trial CZ@@ OL@@ 4@@ 46@@ M@@ 230@@ 8 ) , the yearly administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta was not inferior to the percentage change in the lum@@ bar vert@@ eb@@ ra@@ e BM@@ D after 24 months compared to the initial value . &quot;
&quot; clinical efficacy of treatment at Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the bone Ac@@ la@@ sta has been studied with radi@@ ologically confirmed patients at the age of 30 with radi@@ ologically confirmed , particularly light to moder@@ ately severe Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the bone ( medium ser@@ um mirror of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase according to the 2.6 to 3.0@@ fold @-@ specific upper normal value when recording in the study ) . &quot;
11 The efficacy of an in@@ fusion of 5 mg of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid in comparison to intake of 30 mg of ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate once daily during 2 months was detected in two six months comparative studies .
&quot; in combination with combined results , a similar decrease in pain strength and pain control was observed in comparison to the initial value for Ac@@ la@@ sta and Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at . &quot;
patients who were classified as Respon@@ der at the end of the six @-@ month main study could be included in a follow @-@ up phase .
&quot; from the 143 with Ac@@ la@@ sta and the 107 with Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate treated patients who participated in the follow @-@ up study , the therapeutic response at 141 of the patients treated with ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate could be maintained at a mean time of the follow @-@ up period of 18 months after the application . &quot;
&quot; 4 and 15 minutes lasting in@@ fu@@ sions of 2 , 4 , 8 and 16 mg of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ lic acid in 64 patients showed the following pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data , which proved to be dos@@ is@@ regardless . &quot;
&quot; after that , the plasma cutting quickly decreased to &lt; 10 % of the peak after 4 h and &lt; 1 % after 24 h , followed by a long lasting phase very low concentration , not more than 0.1 % of the highest value . &quot;
&quot; rapid bi@@ pha@@ sic dis@@ appearance of the large cycle with half @-@ life cycle t ½ α 0,@@ 24 and t ½ β 1.@@ 87 hours , followed by a long Eli@@ min@@ ation phase with termin@@ ally Eli@@ min@@ ation time t ½ γ 146 hours . &quot;
&quot; the early stages of distribution ( α and β , with the above t ½ -@@ values ) probably represent rapid res@@ or@@ ption in the bones and ex@@ cre@@ tion over the kid@@ neys . &quot;
&quot; in the first 24 h , 39 ± 16 % of the administered dose is found in urine while the rest is mainly tied to bone tissue . &quot;
&quot; the total body clearance is 5,@@ 04 ± 2.5 l / h regardless of the dose and remains un@@ affected by gender , age , race or body weight . &quot;
&quot; an extension of the in@@ fusion time of 5 to 15 minutes led to the decrease in the Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid concentration by 30 % at the end of the in@@ fusion , but had no effect on the area below the curve ( plasma concentration around time ) . &quot;
&quot; a dimin@@ ished clearance of met@@ ab@@ oli@@ zed substances from cy@@ to@@ chrome @-@ P@@ 450 enzymes is unlikely , because Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ lic acid is not met@@ ab@@ oli@@ zed in humans and because it is a weak or even not direct and / or ir@@ reversible , metabolism @-@ dependent inhibit@@ or of the P@@ 450@@ - &quot;
&quot; special patient groups ( see section 4.2 ) The ren@@ al clearing of the Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ lic acid cor@@ related with the Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance , namely 75 ± 33 % of the Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance , and in the 64 tested patients mean 84 ± 29 ml / min ( range 22 to 143 ml / min ) . &quot;
this results in an easy ( cl@@ c@@ r = 50@@ - 80 ml / min ) and a moderate kidney function disorder down to a cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ clearing up to 35 ml / min does not require dosage adjustment of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ lic acid .
&quot; because for severe kidney function disorder ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ - Clear@@ ance &lt; 30 ml / min ) only limited data is available , no statements are possible for this population . &quot;
acute toxic@@ ity The highest non @-@ let@@ ally effective intra@@ ven@@ ous single dose was 10 mg / kg body weight and in rats 0.6 mg / kg body weight .
&quot; in studies in dogs , single doses of 1,0 mg / kg ( based on AU@@ C the 6@@ fold of the recommended human @-@ therapeutic exposure ) were administered over a period of 15 minutes , good and without a ren@@ al influence . &quot;
&quot; chronic and chronic toxic@@ ity In studies with intra@@ ven@@ ous application , the ren@@ al toler@@ ability of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ lic acid was measured in rats by administered doses of 0.6 mg / kg as 15 minutes in@@ fusion in 3 @-@ day intervals , administered in intervals of 2- 3 weeks ( a cum@@ ulative dose , which corresponds to the number of human @-@ therapeutic exposure to the AU@@ C , corresponds to the AU@@ C ) . &quot;
&quot; long @-@ term studies with repeated application of cum@@ ulated expos@@ ures exceeding the maximum of the intended human exposure , toxic@@ ological effects occurred in other organs , including the g@@ astro@@ intestinal tract and the liver , as well as at intra@@ ven@@ ous injection . &quot;
&quot; the most common findings in trials with repeated use was an aug@@ mented primary spon@@ gi@@ osa in the met@@ aphy@@ sis of the long bones in animals in the growth phase with almost all dos@@ ages , a result , which reflects the pharmac@@ ological , anti @-@ res@@ or@@ tive effect of the substance . &quot;
rats observed a ter@@ at@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity in dos@@ ages from 0.2 mg / kg as external and inner ( vis@@ cer@@ al ) ab@@ norm@@ alities and such a skel@@ eton .
&quot; no ter@@ at@@ ogenic effects or embryo @-@ fet@@ al effects were observed in rab@@ bits although the mat@@ ernal toxic@@ ity was 0,1 mg / kg , due to the reduced ser@@ um @-@ calcium @-@ mirror . &quot;
&quot; if the medicine is not directly used , the user is responsible for the storage time according to preparation and conditions before the application ; normally 24 h should not be exceeded at 2 ° C to 8 ° C . &quot;
&quot; Ac@@ la@@ sta is delivered as a package with a bottle as a packing unit or as a bund@@ le package consisting of 5 packs , each containing one bottle . &quot;

&quot; the patient information package should be provided and the following core messages include : • In@@ contr@@ ation in pregnancy and breast@@ feeding women • Re@@ quired of adequate intake of calcium and vitamin D , appropriate physical activity , non @-@ smoking and a healthy diet 17 • Import@@ ant signs and symptoms for serious side effects • When to resort to medical or nursing care &quot;
&quot; in July 2007 , completed on 29 September 2006 , the Pharma@@ ko@@ vig@@ il@@ anz system described in module 1.@@ 8.1 of the application application is in force and works before and while the product is marketed . &quot;
&quot; Ris@@ ko Management Plan The holder of the authorisation for the in@@ tranet is required to carry out the studies and additional activities for the pharmac@@ ovi@@ gil@@ ance , which are explained in the pharmac@@ ovi@@ gil@@ ance plan of the approved version 004 of the risk management plan ( R@@ MP ) in module 1.@@ 8.2 of the authorisation application and all subsequent versions of the CH@@ MP approved versions of the R@@ MP . &quot;
&quot; according to the CH@@ MP Directive for Risk Management Systems for Medic@@ inal Products , the revised R@@ MP should be submitted together with the next &quot; Peri@@ odic Safety Update Report ( P@@ SUR ) . &quot; &quot;
&quot; a revised R@@ MP should be submitted • If new information is disclosed that could affect the current statements on safety , pharmac@@ ovi@@ gil@@ ance plan or activities to minim@@ ise the risk . • On request of the E@@ MEA . &quot;
&quot; Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ lic acid is a representative of a substance called bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate , and is used to treat oste@@ opor@@ osis in post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women , oste@@ opor@@ osis in men and the disease &apos;s disease . &quot;
&quot; decre@@ asing blood levels of sex hormones , especially est@@ ro@@ gens , made of and@@ ro@@ gens , play a role in the rather gradual loss of bone mass observed in men . &quot;
&quot; at Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , bone reconstruction is done too fast , and new bone material is constructed un@@ ordered , which makes the bone material weaker than normal . &quot;
&quot; Ac@@ la@@ sta works by norm@@ alising the bone structure , ensuring normal bone formation and thus gives strength to the bone . &quot;
&quot; if you are in dental treatment or undergo a dental surgery , inform your doctor that you will be treated with Ac@@ la@@ sta . &quot;
&quot; if you use Ac@@ la@@ sta with other medicines , tell your doctor , pharmac@@ ist or nursing staff if you are taking other medicines or used recently , even if it is not prescription medicine . &quot;
&quot; for your doctor , it is especially important to know if you are taking drugs that is known to damage the kid@@ neys . &quot;
&quot; when using Ac@@ la@@ sta in combination with food and drinks , you will be concerned that in accordance with your doctor &apos;s instructions , you will be able to take sufficient liquid before and after the treatment with Ac@@ la@@ sta . &quot;
oste@@ opor@@ osis The usual dose is 5 mg once a year that is administered to you by your doctor or nursing staff as in@@ fusion into a v@@ ein .
&quot; if you have recently broken the hips , it is recommended to carry out the administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta two or more weeks after the operative supply of the hip . &quot;
&quot; Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get The usual dose is 5 mg , which is administered to you by your doctor or nursing staff as in@@ fusion into a v@@ ein . &quot;
&quot; since Ac@@ la@@ sta works for a long time , you may need another dose after one year or longer . &quot;
it is important to follow these instructions carefully so that calcium levels in your blood will not be too low in time after in@@ fusion .
&quot; with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , Ac@@ la@@ sta can work more than one year and your doctor will inform you if you need a renewed treatment . &quot;
&quot; if the administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta has been missed , contact your doctor or hospital immediately to arrange a new appointment . &quot;
&quot; before ending the treatment with Ac@@ la@@ sta If you consider termination of treatment with Ac@@ la@@ sta , please take your next doctor &apos;s date and discuss this with your doctor . &quot;
&quot; side effects related to the first in@@ fusion often occur ( with more than 30 % of patients ) , but are less common after the subsequent in@@ fu@@ sions . &quot;
&quot; fever and ch@@ ills , muscle or joint pain and head@@ aches , occur within the first three days after the administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta . &quot;
&quot; currently it is un@@ clear whether Ac@@ la@@ sta has caused this irregular heart@@ beat , but you should report it to your doctor if you notice such symptoms when you get Ac@@ la@@ sta . &quot;

&quot; allergic reactions , including rare cases of respiratory problems , hi@@ ves and angi@@ o@@ ede@@ ma ( such as swelling in the face , tongue or throat ) , has been reported . &quot;
&quot; please inform your doctor , pharmac@@ ist or nursing staff if any of the listed side effects will significantly affect you or you notice side effects that are not listed in this information . &quot;
&quot; if the drug is not used immediately , the user is responsible for the storage time and conditions up to the application ; normally 24 h should not be exceeded at 2 ° C to 8 ° C . &quot;
&quot; in patients with a low @-@ traumatic stress fra@@ cture , the in@@ fusion of Ac@@ la@@ sta is recommended to perform two or more weeks after the operative care of the hip frac@@ tures . &quot;
&quot; before and after the administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta , patients must be sufficiently supplied with fluid ; this is particularly important in patients receiving di@@ ure@@ tic treatment . &quot;
&quot; due to the rapid inser@@ tion of the effect of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ lic acid on bone structure , a temporary , sometimes sy@@ mpt@@ om@@ atic , hypo@@ kal@@ z@@ emia can develop , whose maximum occurs usually within the first 10 days following the in@@ fusion of Ac@@ la@@ sta . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it is very advisable to ensure an adequate intake of calcium in patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , according to at least twice daily 500 mg of elementary calcium , for at least 10 days after the gift of Ac@@ la@@ sta . &quot;
&quot; in patients with a low @-@ traumatic intra@@ ocular hip fra@@ cture , an initial dose of 50,000 to 12@@ 5,000 I.@@ E. or@@ ally or in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular vitamin D is recommended before in@@ fusion of Ac@@ la@@ sta . &quot;

A@@ comp@@ lia is additionally applied to a diet and exercise for the treatment of adult patients who suffer from obesity ( body mass index - BM@@ I ) of 30 kg / m ² or above or • which are over@@ weight ( BM@@ I of 27 kg / m ² or above ) and in addition one or more I
&quot; in addition , there were four trials conducted in more than 7 000 patients in which A@@ comp@@ lia was used as a suppor@@ tive tool for setting the smoking area compared to a plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , the studies on the setting of smoking showed no uniform results , so that the effect of A@@ comp@@ lia was difficult to assess in this field of application . &quot;
&quot; what risk is associated with A@@ comp@@ lia ? it The most common side effects of A@@ comp@@ lia , which were observed during the studies ( observed with more than 1 of 10 patients ) were nau@@ sea ( nau@@ sea ) and infections of the upper respiratory tissues . &quot;
&quot; it may also be used in patients suffering from an existing severe depression or treated with anti @-@ de@@ press@@ ants , as it can strengthen the risk of depression and , among other things , may provo@@ ke a small minority of patient su@@ ici@@ dal thoughts . &quot;
&quot; caution is advisable while using A@@ comp@@ lia with medicines such as k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole or I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole ( medicines for fung@@ al infections ) , k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( a remedy for use with H@@ IV@@ - infection ) , tel@@ i@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or clari@@ thro@@ my@@ cin ( antibiotics ) . &quot;
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that A@@ comp@@ lia &apos;s effectiveness in terms of weight reduction in patients with obesity or over@@ weight
&quot; medicines used in patients who need it from health and not for cosmetic reasons ( by providing treatment packages for patients and doctors ) , and around the ar@@ z &quot;
&quot; additionally to diet and exercise for the treatment of an obesity ( BM@@ I ≥ 30 kg / m ² ) or over@@ weight patients ( BM@@ I &gt; 27 kg / m ² ) , which also show one or more risk factors , such as type 2 diabetes or dy@@ sli@@ pi@@ d@@ emia ( see Section 5.1 ) . &quot;
A@@ comp@@ lia is not recommended for use in children and adolescents under the age of 18 due to the lack of data on efficacy and harm@@ lessness .
&quot; La Dep@@ res@@ sive disorders or mood changes with depres@@ sive symptoms were reported in up to 10 % , su@@ ici@@ dal thoughts of up to 1 % of patients receiving Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant ( see section 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant may not be used in depres@@ sive disorders , unless the benefit of treatment in the individual case out@@ weighs the risk ( see section 4.3 and 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; also in patients who , besides obesity , are no recogni@@ zable risks , de@@ pressed reactions can occur . &quot;
&quot; relatives or other nearby people are to point out that it is necessary to monitor the new occurrence of such symptoms and immediately seek medical advice , if these symptoms occur . &quot;
• El@@ der patients The efficacy and harm@@ lessness of Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant in the treatment of patients over 75 years have not been sufficiently shown .
patients with a cardiovascular event ( m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction or stroke etc . ) less than 6 months ago were excluded from trials with Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant .
&quot; ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , car@@ b@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , car@@ b@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , car@@ b@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , Johannis@@ k@@ raut ) is not investigated , is assumed that the simultaneous offering of potent C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 induc@@ tors die plasma concentration of Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant &quot;
&quot; patients with over@@ weight patients as well as in patients with obesity have examined , and in addition to 38@@ 00 patients in further indications . &quot;
the following table ( table 1 ) shows the undes@@ irable effects in plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled trials in patients treated for weight reduction and related metabolic diseases .
it if the incidence statisti@@ cally significantly higher than the corresponding plac@@ eb@@ or@@ ate ( for undes@@ irable effects ≥ 1 % ) or if they were clin@@ ically relevant ( for undes@@ irable effects &lt; 1 % ) . NG In the evaluation of side effects the following frequencies are put into effect :
&quot; very common ( ≥ 10 % ) ; common ( ≥ 1 , &lt; 10 % ) ; occasionally ( ≥ 0.1 , &lt; 1 % ) ; rare ( ≥ 0.01 , &lt; 0.1 % ) ; very t l@@ ä &quot;
&quot; in a toler@@ able study , in which a limited number of persons were administered up to 300 mg , only slight symptoms were observed . &quot;
the patients had a BM@@ I ≥ 30 kg / m ² or BM@@ I &gt; 27 kg / m ² and an simultaneously existing hyper@@ tension and / or dy@@ sli@@ pi@@ d@@ emia .
&quot; weight reduction after one year was for A@@ comp@@ lia 20 mg 6.5 kg , relative to the initial value , compared to 1.6 kg for the plac@@ ebo group ( difference -@@ 4.9 kg CI@@ 95 % -@@ 5,@@ 3 ; -@@ 4.4 , p &lt; 0.0@@ 01 ) . &quot;
patients treated with A@@ comp@@ lia 20 mg and 1.2 kg in the plac@@ ebo group ( difference -@@ 3.8 kg ; CI@@ 95 % -@@ 4.4 ; -@@ 3.3 ; p &lt; 0.0@@ 01 ) .
&quot; after 2 years , the difference in total weight reduction was between A@@ comp@@ lia and plac@@ ebo -@@ 4.2 kg ( CI@@ 95 % -@@ 5.0 % ; -@@ 3.4 , p &lt; 0.0@@ 01 ) . &quot;
&quot; 9 Weight reduction and further risk factors In the studies in patients with no diabetes , in which a mixed population of patients with &quot;
Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant 20 mg was seen an average decrease in tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de from 6.9 % ( initial tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de 1.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) compared to an increase of 5.8 %
&quot; in a second study in patients with an obesity and with previously untreated type 2 diabetes ( SER@@ EN@@ A@@ DE ) , the absolute change in the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c value ( with an initial value of 7.9 % for both groups ) after 6 months -@@ 0.8 for Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant 20 mg and -@@ 0,3 under plac@@ ebo &quot;
the percentage of patients receiving a H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c@@ - value of &lt; 7 % was 51 % in the Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant group and 35 % in the plac@@ ebo group .
&quot; the middle @-@ weight difference between the 20 M@@ g@@ - and the plac@@ ebo group was 3.8 kg ( CI@@ 95 % -@@ 5.0 , -@@ 2.6 p &lt; 0.0@@ 01 ) . &quot;
&quot; improvement of the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c value in patients who had taken Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant 20 mg were about 50 % due to direct effects of Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant , and about 50 % explained by weight reduction . n eim Ar@@ z &quot;
&quot; after 13 days , the steady state plasma was reached ( C@@ MA@@ x = 196 ± 28,@@ 1 ng / ml ; C@@ t@@ rough = 9@@ 1.6 ± 14,@@ 1 ng / ml ; AU@@ C@@ 0 @-@ 24 = 29@@ 60 ± 268 n@@ g.@@ h / ml ) . &quot;
&quot; the influence of food : he subjects who received the Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant either in the not@@ orious condition or after a fat @-@ rich meal , reported in the case of food intake a 67 % increased C@@ MA@@ x resp@@ . by 48 % increased ng AU@@ C . &quot;
patients with black skin color can lower up to 31 % lower C@@ MA@@ x and a 43 % lower AU@@ C than patients from other ethnic populations .
popul@@ ation@@ sp@@ har@@ mac@@ eu@@ tical analyses ( age range 18@@ - 81 years ) is estimated that a 75 @-@ year @-@ old patient has a 21 % higher C@@ MA@@ x and a 27 % higher AU@@ C than a 40 @-@ year @-@ old
&quot; 5.3 Pre@@ clinical data on safety of the following adverse effects , which were not observed in clinical trials , which occurred in animals after exposure in the human@@ istic area , were considered possibly relevant to the clinical application : &quot;
&quot; in some , however , not in all cases , the beginning of conv@@ ul@@ sions seems to be associated with proced@@ ural stress such as dealing with animals . &quot;
&quot; Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant was given over a longer period before the mat@@ ing ( 9 weeks ) , which allowed a recovery from the initi@@ als effects of Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant , thus no unwanted effects were observed on fertility or cycl@@ amen . &quot;
the influence of Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant on pre@@ - and post@@ nat@@ al development was investigated by rats in doses of up to 10 mg / kg / day .
&quot; in a study at rats for pre@@ - and post@@ nat@@ al development , an exposition with Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant in uter@@ o and by lac@@ tation caused no changes in learning behavior or memory . &quot;

&quot; summary of the EP@@ AR for the public This document is a summary of the European Public Assessment Report ( EP@@ AR ) , which explains how the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) assessed the studies carried out in order to get recommendations regarding the use of the medicine . &quot;
account is used to treat type 2 diabetes ( also known as non @-@ insulin @-@ dependent diabetes ) . • It can be used alone ( mon@@ otherapy ) in patients ( in particular over@@ weight patients ) . • It can be used together with another di@@ ab@@ et@@ es@@ medication ( dual therapy ) .
&quot; it can be applied in addition to met@@ form@@ in in patients ( especially over@@ weight patients ) , which cannot be satis@@ factory with Met@@ form@@ in alone in the highest toler@@ able dose . &quot;
&quot; in combination with a sul@@ fon@@ yl@@ resin or insulin , the current dose of sul@@ fon@@ yl@@ urine or insulin can be maintained with the beginning of the account treatment , except in patients with hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia ( low blood sugar ) ; here , the dose of sul@@ fon@@ yl resin or insulin should be reduced . &quot;
&quot; this means that the body &apos;s insulin can be better utilized and the blood sugar level sin@@ ks , so type 2 diabetes can be adjusted better . &quot;
&quot; in more than 1 400 patients the efficacy of acet@@ ylene was studied in tri@@ ple@@ therapy ; in doing so , patients received a combination of met@@ form@@ in with a sul@@ fon@@ yl resin , in addition they received either Ac@@ tos or plac@@ ebo for up to 3.5 years . &quot;
&quot; in studies , the concentration of a substance in the blood ( gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in , H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) was measured , indicating how well the blood sugar is adjusted . &quot;
&quot; account led to a lowering of the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c value , which suggests that blood sugar levels have been reduced when applying the dos@@ ages of 15 mg , 30 mg and 45 mg . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the tri@@ ple@@ therapy study , the effect of the additional administration of acet@@ ylene was reduced by 0.@@ 94 % , while the additional administration of plac@@ ebo resulted in a reduction of 0.@@ 35 % . &quot;
&quot; in a small study , in which the combination of acet@@ one and insulin was studied in 289 patients , patients who took Ac@@ tos in addition to insulin had to decrease the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c values of 0.@@ 69 % after 6 months , compared to 0.@@ 14 % in the patients who additionally took plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; the most common adverse events associated with Ac@@ tos were visual distur@@ bances , infections of the upper respiratory tract ( col@@ ds ) , weight gain and hypo@@ ge@@ thesia ( reduced sensitivity to irrit@@ ation ) . &quot;
&quot; account may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one or any of the other ingredients , nor in patients with liver problems , heart failure or di@@ ab@@ etic k@@ eto@@ aci@@ dosis ( high ket@@ one level - acid level - in the blood ) . &quot;
it has been decided that Ac@@ tos should serve as an alternative to standard treatment with Met@@ form@@ in in patients with which Met@@ form@@ in is not shown .
&quot; in October 2000 , the European Commission granted Tak@@ eda Europe R &amp; D Centre Limited to appro@@ ve account of Ac@@ tos in the European Union . &quot;
&quot; the tablets are white to whi@@ tish , round , curved and carry on one side the marking &quot; 15 &quot; and on the other hand the inscription &quot; Ac@@ tos . &quot; &quot;
pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one is also indicated for the combination with insulin in patients with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus whose blood sugar is inadequate with insulin and is un@@ suitable for met@@ form@@ in due to contra@@ indications or intoler@@ ance ( see section 4.4 ) .
&quot; no data is available for the use of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one in patients under 18 years of age , so the application in this age group is not recommended . &quot;
&quot; in patients who are at least risk a risk factor ( e.g. past heart attack or sy@@ mpt@@ om@@ atic cor@@ on@@ ary heart disease ) , the doctor should start treatment with the lowest available dose and increase the dose . &quot;
&quot; patients should be observed on signs and symptoms of heart failure , weight gain or o@@ ede@@ ma , especially those with reduced cardiac reserve . &quot;
&quot; patients should be observed on signs and symptoms of heart failure , weight gain and o@@ ede@@ ma , when Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on is used in combination with insulin . &quot;
a cardiovascular outcome study with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one in patients under 75 years with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and pre@@ valence of advanced mac@@ rov@@ ascular disease has been carried out .
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; in patients with increased output of liver enzyme values ( AL@@ T &gt; 2.5 x upper limit of the normal range ) , or with other signs of liver disease , Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one should not be used . &quot;
&quot; if the AL@@ T mirrors are increased by up to 3 times the upper limit of the normal range , the liver enzymes are to be checked again as soon as possible . &quot;
&quot; if a patient develops symptoms that point to a h@@ ep@@ atic dysfunction , such as un@@ explained nau@@ sea , v@@ om@@ iting , super@@ structure , fatigue , appetite and / or dark urine , the liver enzymes are to be checked . &quot;
the decision whether the treatment of the patient with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one should be continued until the laboratory parameters should be carried out by the clinical assessment .
&quot; in clinical trials with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one , dos@@ o @-@ dependent weight gain has been detected , which can come from fatty deposits and in some cases is connected to a liquid retention . &quot;
&quot; as a result of hem@@ odi@@ lution under therapy with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one , a minor reduction of the mean hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in values ( relative reduction by 4 % ) and hem@@ at@@ oc@@ r@@ its ( relative reduction by 4.1 % ) occurred . &quot;
similar changes were observed in comparative controlled trials with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one in patients under Met@@ form@@ in ( relative reduction of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in by 3 @-@ 4 % and the hem@@ at@@ oc@@ r@@ its by 1 @-@ 2 % and the hem@@ at@@ oc@@ r@@ its by 1 @-@ 2 % and the hem@@ at@@ oc@@ r@@ its by 1 @-@ 2 % ) .
&quot; as a result of increased insulin sensitivity , patients who receive Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one as oral double or triple combination therapy with insulin , receive the risk of dose @-@ dependent hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia . &quot;
&quot; after the market introduction , treatment with thi@@ az@@ oli@@ d@@ indi@@ ans , including Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one , was reported on an appearance or wor@@ sen@@ ing of a di@@ ab@@ etic mac@@ ular ede@@ ma with a reduction in visual acu@@ ity . &quot;
&quot; it is un@@ clear whether there is a direct connection between taking pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one and the occurrence of mac@@ ular ede@@ ma , but prescribed doctors should be aware of the possibility of mac@@ ular ede@@ ma if patients should report on distur@@ bances of visual acu@@ ity ; a suitable ophthalm@@ ological examination should be taken into consideration . &quot;
&quot; in a summary analysis of reports of adverse events regarding bone frac@@ tures from random@@ ised controlled , double @-@ blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients treated with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one &quot;
the calculated Fra@@ ktur was 1.9 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years with the females treated with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one and 1.1 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in women treated with a comparative medi@@ ation .
&quot; in the Pro@@ Active study , a study over 3.5 years for the study of cardiovascular events , frac@@ tures performed at 44 / 870 ( 5.1 % ; 1,0 fra@@ cture per 100 patient years ) , compared with 23 / 905 ( 2.5 % ; 0.5 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) in patients treated with a comparative medi@@ ation . &quot;
patients should be aware of the possibility of pregnancy and if a patient wishes a pregnancy or this occurs the treatment is canc@@ eled ( see section 4.6 ) .
&quot; studies on the study of interactions have shown that Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one has no relevant effects on pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics or pharmac@@ o@@ dynamics of di@@ ox@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , phen@@ proc@@ ou@@ mon and met@@ form@@ in . &quot;
&quot; drug interactions that are met@@ ab@@ oli@@ zed by these enzymes , e.g. oral contra@@ cep@@ tives , Cy@@ clos@@ por@@ in , calcium channel blo@@ cker and H@@ M@@ G@@ Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ inhibit@@ ors are not expected . &quot;
simultaneous application of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one with gem@@ fibro@@ zi@@ l ( a Cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8@@ - In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or ) resulted in an increase in the AU@@ C of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one around 3 times .
the simultaneous use of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one with Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a Cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C8 induc@@ tor ) resulted in lowering the AU@@ C of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on by 54 % .
this is due to the fact that in the treatment with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on the hyper@@ insul@@ in@@ emia and increased insulin resistance of the mother @-@ animal decreased and thereby reduced the availability of the metabolic sub@@ str@@ ates for the fet@@ al growth .
&quot; very common &gt; 1 / 10 ; frequently &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ; occasionally &gt; 1 / 1000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ; rare &gt; 1 / 10000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ; very rare &lt; 1 / 10000 , isolated cases : unknown ( from present data not estimated ) . &quot;
&quot; these lead to a temporary change in the turbine and the refra@@ ction index of the lens , as observed in other hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ic agents . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one , AL@@ T An@@ sti@@ ege on the tri@@ ples of the upper limit of the normal range also frequently occurred as under plac@@ ebo , but more rarely than in comparison groups under Met@@ form@@ in or Sul@@ fon@@ yl resin . &quot;
&quot; in an Out@@ come study in patients with advanced mac@@ rov@@ ascular disease , the incidence of severe heart failure in Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one was 1.6 % higher than in plac@@ ebo , when Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on res@@ p . &quot;
&quot; since the launch it has rarely been reported about heart failure in Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one , but more often when Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one has been used in combination with insulin or in patients with heart failure in an@@ am@@ nes@@ is . &quot;
&quot; a summary analysis of reports of adverse events regarding bone frac@@ tures from random@@ ised controlled , double @-@ blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients treated in patients treated with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one treated groups and over 7,@@ 400 patients treated in the groups treated with comparative medi@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; in the Pro@@ Active study over a period of 3.5 years , frac@@ tures performed at 44 / 870 ( 5.1 % ) of patients treated with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one compared to 23 / 905 ( 2.5 % ) in patients treated with a comparative medi@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; when taking the recommended maximum dose of 120 mg / day for four days , then 180 mg / day over seven days did not appear any symptoms . &quot;
&quot; Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on seems to have an activation of specific core recept@@ ors ( Per@@ ox@@ is@@ ome Pro@@ lifer@@ ator ) activated Rec@@ ep@@ tor @-@ γ ( PP@@ AR @-@ γ ) ) , which leads to an increased insulin sensitivity of liver , fat and skel@@ etal muscle cells . &quot;
it could be shown that Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on reduces glu@@ cos@@ e@@ production in the liver and increases periph@@ eral glucose utilis@@ ation in the event of insulin resistance .
a clinical trial with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one versus G@@ lic@@ la@@ zi@@ d as mon@@ otherapy was continued over two years to investigate the time until the therapeutic effect ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ≥ 8.0 % after the first 6 months of treatment ) .
&quot; at the time after two years after the therapy started , a blood glucose control ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c &lt; 8,0 % ) could be maintained by pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one at 69 % of patients treated ( compared to 50 % of patients under G@@ lic@@ la@@ zi@@ d ) . &quot;
&quot; in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study over 12 months , patients whose blood sugar was inadequate in spite of three months of optimization with insulin , were random@@ ized to pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one or plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in patients with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one , the mean H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c reduced by 0.@@ 45 % compared to the patients who continued to receive insulin ; a reduction in insulin dosage in the group treated with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one was observed . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials over a year , under Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one , a statisti@@ cally significant decrease in the Alb@@ um@@ in / Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in quot@@ i@@ ents was statisti@@ cally significant compared to the initial values . &quot;
&quot; the effect of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one ( mon@@ otherapy with 45 mg versus plac@@ ebo ) was tested in a small , 18 weeks study on type 2 di@@ abe@@ tics . &quot;
&quot; in most clinical studies , compared to plac@@ ebo , a reduction in total plasma tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des and free fatty acids and an increase in HD@@ L cholesterol levels as well as slightly , but clin@@ ically not significantly increased L@@ DL cholesterol levels . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials over a period of up to two years , Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one reduced overall plasma gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de and free fatty acids and increased HD@@ L cholesterol . &quot;
&quot; compared to plac@@ ebo , no statisti@@ cally significant increase in L@@ DL cholesterol was observed under Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on while under Met@@ form@@ in and G@@ lic@@ la@@ zi@@ d , values were observed . &quot;
&quot; in a study over 20 weeks , Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on reduced not only the gro@@ cer tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de , but also improved the post@@ pran@@ dial increased tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de levels , which has an effect on tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de absorption as well as on the h@@ ep@@ atic tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de synthesis . &quot;
&quot; in the Pro@@ Active study , a cardiovascular outcome study , 5@@ 238 patients with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and pre @-@ existing metastatic mac@@ rov@@ ascular disease were random@@ ised to receive either Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one or plac@@ ebo for over a period of up to 3.5 years . &quot;
&quot; after oral application , Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one is quickly res@@ or@@ bed , whereby the top concentrations of un@@ modified pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one can usually be reached 2 hours after application . &quot;
&quot; on this basis , M @-@ IV &apos;s contribution to effectiveness is equivalent to the triple of the effectiveness of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one , whereas the relative effectiveness of M @-@ II is minimal . &quot;
&quot; in interaction studies , it has been proven that Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one has no relevant effect on pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics or pharmac@@ o@@ dynamics of di@@ ox@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , phen@@ proc@@ ou@@ mon and met@@ form@@ in . &quot;
simultaneous application of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on with Gem@@ fibro@@ zi@@ l ( a Cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8@@ - In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or ) or with Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a Cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C8 induc@@ tor ) increases or lowers the plasma concentration of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on ( see section 4.5 ) .
&quot; after oral application of radio@@ activity marked Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on in humans , mark@@ ers were found mainly in the rot ( 55 % ) and to a lesser extent in the urine ( 45 % ) . &quot;
&quot; the mean plasma elimination time of unchanged pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one is 5 @-@ 6 hours in humans , and the total active metabolism is 16 - 23 hours . &quot;
&quot; the plasma concentrations of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one and its metabol@@ ites are lower in patients with reduced kidney function than in healthy subjects , but the rates of the oral Clear@@ ance of the parent substance are similar . &quot;
&quot; toxic@@ ological studies appeared in mice , rats , dogs and monkeys after repeated administration plasma volume enlar@@ ging with hem@@ odi@@ lution , an@@ emia and reversible ec@@ centric cardiac hyper@@ tro@@ phy . &quot;
this is due to the fact that in treatment with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on the hyper@@ insul@@ in@@ emia and increased insulin resistance of the mother @-@ animal decreased and thereby reduced the availability of the metabolic sub@@ str@@ ates for the fet@@ al growth .
&quot; in long @-@ term studies ( up to 2 years ) , increased incidence of hyper@@ pl@@ asia ( in male and female rats ) and tum@@ ours ( in male rats ) of the ur@@ inary bladder was induced . &quot;
in a animal model of the family aden@@ omat@@ ous poly@@ posi@@ s ( FA@@ P ) treatment with two other thi@@ az@@ oli@@ d@@ indi@@ ans led to increased incidence of col@@ ont@@ ologists .
&quot; the tablets are white to whi@@ tish , round , flat and carry on one side the marking &quot; 30 &quot; and on the other hand the inscription &quot; Ac@@ tos . &quot; &quot;
the calculated Fra@@ ktur was 1.9 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years with the females treated with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one and 1.1 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in women treated with a comparative medi@@ ation .
&quot; in the Pro@@ Active study , a study over 3.5 years for the study of cardiovascular events , frac@@ tures performed at 44 / 870 ( 5.1 % ; 1,0 fra@@ cture per 100 patient years ) , compared with 23 / 905 ( 2.5 % ; 0.5 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) in patients treated with a comparative medi@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; in another study over two years , the effects of a combination therapy of met@@ form@@ in with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one or g@@ lic@@ la@@ zi@@ d were investigated . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials over 1 year , under Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one , a statisti@@ cally significant decrease in the Alb@@ um@@ in / Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in quot@@ i@@ ents was statisti@@ cally significant compared to the initial values . &quot;
&quot; in a study over 20 weeks , Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on did not only reduce the tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de , but also improved the post@@ pran@@ dial increased tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de levels , which has an effect on the tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de absorption as well as on the h@@ ep@@ atic tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de synthesis . &quot;
&quot; although the study failed in terms of its primary end@@ point , which a combination of the total mort@@ ality , non @-@ fatal m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction , stroke , acute cor@@ on@@ ary syndrome , leg amp@@ utation above the ank@@ le , cor@@ on@@ ary vas@@ cul@@ ar@@ isation and re@@ vas@@ cul@@ ar@@ isation of the leg arter@@ ies presented , the results suggest that no cardiovascular risks associated with the intake of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one . &quot;

&quot; in total 294 patients with type 1 diabetes , in which the pancre@@ as cannot produce insulin , and type 2 diabetes in which the body is unable to use insulin effectively . &quot;
&quot; after 12 weeks , the concentration of a substance ( gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) was measured , indicating how well the blood sugar is adjusted . &quot;
&quot; Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane led to a decrease in the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c mirror , suggest@@ ing that blood sugar levels have been lowered similarly to other human insulin . &quot;
ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane should not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to human insulin ( r@@ DNA ) or any of the other ingredients .
&quot; in addition , the doses of ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane may be adjusted if it is administered together with a number of other medicines that can affect blood sugar ( the complete list is included in the package insert ) . &quot;
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of acet@@ one in the treatment of diabetes are out@@ weigh the risks .
&quot; in October 2002 , the European Commission issued a permit to the company Nov@@ o Nor@@ disk A / S for placing Ac@@ tri@@ ph@@ ane in the entire European Union . &quot;
pre @-@ mixed insulin products are usually applied once or twice daily when a quick initial action is desired along with a longer lasting effect .
the injection needle must be left under the skin at least 6 seconds to ensure that the entire dose was inj@@ ected .
&quot; for example , patients whose blood sugar adjustment has improved significantly by an intensi@@ fied insulin therapy , the hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia warning symptoms can be altered and should be consul@@ ted accordingly . &quot;
&quot; any change with regard to starch , brand ( manufacturers ) , insulin type ( fast acting , bi@@ pha@@ sic , long acting insulin , etc . ) , type of insulin ( animal insulin , insulin or insulin analog ) and / or manufacturing method ( by re@@ combin@@ ant DNA to insulin @-@ animal origin ) may cause a change in dosage . &quot;
&quot; if a dose adjustment is required when switching to Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane in the patient , it may be necessary for the first dose or in the first weeks or months after the conversion . &quot;
&quot; some patients reported hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ic reactions after a change of animal on human insulin , reported that early warning symptoms of hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia were less pronounced or different than in their previous insulin . &quot;
&quot; before travelling , which go over several time zones , the patient should be advised to take the advice of his doctor as such journeys may cause insulin and meals to be applied or taken at other times . &quot;
&quot; therefore , the doctor must consider possible interactions during therapy and always ask his patients after other medicines taken by them . &quot;
&quot; 4 B@@ oth hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia as well as hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia , which may occur in a not sufficiently controlled di@@ ab@@ et@@ es@@ therapy , increase the risk of ab@@ norm@@ alities and fertility in uter@@ o . &quot;
severe hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ias can lead to un@@ consciousness and / or sei@@ zur@@ es and end with temporary or permanent distur@@ bances of the brain function and even death .
&quot; diseases of the nervous system occasional - periph@@ eral neu@@ rop@@ athy A rapid improvement of blood sugar control can be associated with dis@@ comfort , which are known as acute painful neu@@ rop@@ athy and are usually reversible . &quot;
5 An intensi@@ fication of insulin therapy with an ab@@ rupt improvement in blood sugar adjustment may be associated with a temporary deteri@@ oration of di@@ ab@@ etic retin@@ opathy .
&quot; diseases of the skin and the lower body tissue , occasional - Li@@ po@@ dy@@ stro@@ phy At the injection point , a li@@ po@@ dy@@ stro@@ phy can occur when failed to change the adjusting points within the injection range . &quot;
&quot; common diseases and dis@@ comfort at the administration of occasional - Local hyper@@ sensitivity reactions at the injection point during insulin therapy can occur local hyper@@ sensitivity reactions ( red@@ ness , swelling , it@@ ching , pain and ha@@ em@@ at@@ oma at the injection office ) . &quot;
&quot; diseases of the immune system occasional - Ur@@ tic@@ aria , Ex@@ an@@ them Very rare - an@@ aphy@@ lac@@ tic reactions Symptoms gener@@ alized hyper@@ sensitivity , including gener@@ alized skin r@@ ash , it@@ ching , swe@@ ating , g@@ astro@@ intestinal disorders , angi@@ on@@ eur@@ ot@@ ic oil , breathing problems , heart pal@@ pit@@ ations , low blood pressure and impot@@ ence / un@@ consciousness . &quot;
&quot; however , hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia can develop gradually : • Easy hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ias can be treated by the oral supply of glucose and sug@@ ary foods . &quot;
&quot; di@@ abe@@ tics should therefore always have grape @-@ inf@@ lic@@ ts , sweets , bis@@ cuits or sugar @-@ containing fruit juice . • Gra@@ vity hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ias with in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of glu@@ c@@ agon ( 0.5 to 1.0 mg ) are treated by a proven help person or by glucose that is given intra@@ ven@@ ously by the doctor . &quot;
&quot; the effect begins within half an hour , the working maximum is reached within 2 to 8 hours and the duration of the active duration amounts to up to 24 hours . &quot;
res@@ or@@ ption Profile is based on the fact that the product is a mixture of insulin products with fast or delayed res@@ or@@ ption .
a number of spl@@ itting ( hydro@@ ly@@ sis ) places on the human insulin molecule were considered ; none of the metabol@@ ites formed by the split is active .
&quot; based on conventional studies on safety har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated offering , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity , car@@ cin@@ ogenic potential and reproductive @-@ toxic@@ ity , the prec@@ lin@@ ical data do not allow any particular haz@@ ards to humans . &quot;
&quot; it is recommended , after removal of the ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane hydr@@ o bottle from the fridge , to increase the temperature of the insulin to room temperature ( not above 25 ° C ) before it is res@@ us@@ pen@@ ded according to the manual for the first use . &quot;
&quot; some patients reported hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ic reactions after a change of animal on human insulin , reported that early warning symptoms of hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia were less pronounced or different than in their previous insulin . &quot;
&quot; therefore , the doctor must consider possible interactions during therapy and always ask his patients after other medicines taken by them . &quot;
&quot; 12 B@@ oth hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia as well as hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia , which may occur in a not sufficiently controlled di@@ ab@@ et@@ es@@ therapy , increase the risk of ab@@ norm@@ alities and fertility in uter@@ o . &quot;

ac@@ tra@@ pi@@ d should not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive to insulin in human ( r@@ DNA ) or any of the other ingredients .
&quot; in addition , the doses of acet@@ tra@@ pi@@ d may be adjusted if it is administered together with a number of other medicines that can affect blood sugar . &quot;
&quot; in October 2002 , the European Commission issued a permit for the company Nov@@ o Nor@@ disk A / S for Ac@@ tra@@ pi@@ d in@@ transport across the European Union . &quot;
&quot; when two types of insulin are mixed , the amount of insulin @-@ acting insulin has to be re@@ ared first , then the amount of insulin @-@ active insulin . &quot;
&quot; 3 If a dose adjustment is required when switching to Ac@@ tra@@ pi@@ d , it may be necessary for the first dose or in the first weeks or months after the conversion . &quot;
&quot; before travelling , which go over several time zones , the patient should be advised to take the advice of his doctor as such journeys may cause insulin and meals to be applied or taken at other times . &quot;
&quot; 5 General diseases and dis@@ comfort at the administration of occasional - Local hyper@@ sensitivity reactions at the injection point during insulin therapy can occur local hyper@@ sensitivity reactions ( red@@ ness , swelling , it@@ ching , pain and ha@@ em@@ at@@ oma at the injection office ) . &quot;

&quot; in the first study at which 1 0@@ 72 patients participated , the efficacy of three different A@@ den@@ ur@@ ic dos@@ ages ( once daily 80 , 120 and 240 mg ) was compared with the plac@@ ebo ( false medi@@ cam@@ ents ) and Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( another drug for the treatment of hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ a@@ emia ) . &quot;
&quot; in the second study , two doses of A@@ den@@ ur@@ ic ( once daily 80 and 120 mg ) were compared to 7@@ 62 patients each day with Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol . &quot;
in both studies Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol was applied in a dose of once daily 300 mg ; patients with kidney problems received only 100 mg per day .
the main indicator for the efficacy was the number of patients whose ure@@ a @-@ acid levels in the blood were below 6 mg / dl in the last three measurements .
&quot; in the first study , 48 % ( 126 of 262 ) of patients who took A@@ den@@ ur@@ ic in a dose of 80 mg once a day , and 65 % ( 175 of 269 ) of patients who received 120 m@@ g. a day in the blood of less than 6 mg / dl in the last three measurements . &quot;
&quot; compared to this , this was 22 % ( 60 of 268 ) of the patients under Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol and none of the 134 patients under plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of A@@ den@@ ur@@ ic ( observed from 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are head@@ aches , di@@ arr@@ he@@ a , nau@@ sea ( nau@@ sea ) , r@@ ash and ab@@ normal liver values . &quot;
&quot; in particular in patients with heart complaints in the pre@@ history , there may be an increased risk of certain side effects that affect the heart and blood vessels . &quot;
&quot; the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that A@@ den@@ ur@@ ic was more effective in lowering the ur@@ ic acid level in the blood as Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol , but also a higher risk of side effects associated with the heart and blood vessels . &quot;
treatment of chronic hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ a@@ emia in diseases that have already led to urine deposits ( including one from the patient &apos;s history known or currently available tox@@ ins and / or a arthritis ) .
&quot; if the ser@@ um har@@ row is still after 2 @-@ 4 weeks still &gt; 6 mg / dl ( 357 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) , a dose of dose to A@@ DEN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 120 mg 1 x daily may be considered . &quot;
&quot; in patients with severe kidney function , effectiveness and safety have not been fully investigated yet ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ - Clear@@ ance &lt; 30 ml / min , see section 5.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; children and adolescents There are no experiences in children and adolescents , the use of Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at is not recommended in this patient group . &quot;
&quot; organ transplan@@ t recipients Since there are no experiences in organ transplan@@ t recipients , the use of Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at is not recommended in this patient group ( see Section 5.1 ) . &quot;
cardiovascular diseases In patients with isch@@ em@@ ic heart disease or de@@ compens@@ ated heart failure treatment with Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at is not recommended ( see section 4.8 ) .
&quot; as with other herbal medicines , it can occur during the treatment start to an acute g@@ ill @-@ attack , because by lowering the Ser@@ um har@@ row acid pi@@ eg@@ els first resin deposits can be mobil@@ ised in the tissues . &quot;
&quot; B. with mal@@ ign@@ ant diseases and their treatment , Les@@ ch@@ - Ny@@ han &apos;s syndrome ) the absolute concentration of X@@ an@@ thin in the urine in rare cases so far increases that it occurs to a storage in the ur@@ inary tract . &quot;
&quot; liver disease Dur@@ ing the phase 3 clinical studies , slight ab@@ norm@@ alities of the liver function were observed in patients treated with Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at ( 3.5 % ) . &quot;
&quot; therefore , it is recommended to perform a liver function test before the beginning of the Feb@@ u@@ ary period and in the course of the clinical trial ( see Section 5.1 ) . &quot;
&quot; The@@ ophy@@ ll@@ in Z@@ ist did not conduct any interaction studies on Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at , but it is known that the X@@ O inhibit@@ or can lead to an increase in the@@ ophy@@ l@@ line level ( a blocking of the@@ ophy@@ l@@ line of the@@ ophy@@ ll@@ in was also reported for other X@@ O inhibit@@ ors ) . &quot;
&quot; in subjects , simultaneous offering of Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at and nap@@ ro@@ xen 250 mg 2 x daily was associated with an increase in Feb@@ ux@@ o@@ sta exposure ( C@@ MA@@ x 28 % , AU@@ C 41 % and t@@ 1 / 2 26 % ) . &quot;
in clinical trials the use of nap@@ ro@@ xen or other N@@ SA@@ R / Co@@ x @-@ 2 inhibit@@ ors was not associated with a clin@@ ically significant increase in adverse events .
Col@@ chic@@ ine / In@@ dom@@ et@@ ac@@ in / Hydro@@ chlor@@ thi@@ azi@@ de / War@@ far@@ in Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at can be used together with Col@@ chic@@ ine or In@@ dom@@ et@@ ac@@ in without a dose adjustment for Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at or the concur@@ rent other active ingredient is required .
&quot; in a study with test subjects 120 mg A@@ DEN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 1 x daily an average 22 % increase in the AU@@ C of Des@@ i@@ pr@@ amine , a C@@ YP@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 sub@@ strate , which indicates a possible weak inhibit@@ ory effect of Feb@@ ur@@ ost@@ at to the C@@ YP@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 enzyme in vi@@ vo . &quot;
&quot; An@@ ta@@ zi@@ da It could be shown that the simultaneous intake of an ant@@ acids containing magnesium hydro@@ xi@@ de and aluminum hydro@@ xi@@ de , the intake of Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at ( about 1 hour ) delayed and a decrease in the C@@ MA@@ x by 32 % , but no significant change in the AU@@ C causes . &quot;
pregnancy data over a very limited number of exposed pregnant women do not include side effects of Feb@@ ur@@ ost@@ at on pregnancy or the health of fo@@ etus / new@@ bor@@ ns .
&quot; experimental studies do not include direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development or birth ( see Section 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; patients should be careful when controlling a vehicle , serving of machines or during the exercise of hazardous activities until they can reasonably be certain that A@@ DEN@@ U@@ RI@@ C does not adver@@ sely affect their performance . &quot;
a numer@@ ically higher incidence of cardiovascular events reported by the investig@@ ator was observed in the total f@@ ebu@@ x@@ o@@ stat@@ group in the pi@@ vot@@ al study of phase 3 ( 1.3 versus 0.3 events per 100 patient years ) and in long @-@ term extension studies ( 1.4 versus 0.7 events per 100 patient years ) although no statisti@@ cally significant differences were found and no caus@@ al connection with Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at could be detected .
the risk factors identified in these patients were an arter@@ ios@@ cl@@ erotic disease and / or a m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction or a compens@@ ated con@@ ges@@ tive heart failure in the medical history .
&quot; frequent ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasional ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 to &lt; 1 / 100 ) and rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 to &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) side effects which could be found in the treatment groups with 80 mg / 120 mg of Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at and which were reported in all Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at treatment groups altogether more than once , are listed below . &quot;
&quot; di@@ arr@@ ho@@ ea , nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting are more common in patients who are treated with Col@@ chic@@ ine at the same time . * * In the clinical trials , no severe skin r@@ ashes or severe hyper@@ sensitivity reactions were observed . &quot;
&quot; 7 Open long @-@ term extension studies In the open long @-@ term extension studies were treated 906 patients up to 1 year long , 322 patients up to 2 years long , 57 patients up to 4 years with Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at 80 mg / 120 mg . &quot;
treatment @-@ related events reported during the long @-@ term extension studies were similar to those reported in the Phase 3 studies ( see table 1 ) .
&quot; the following treatment @-@ related events were reported in all Feb@@ ux@@ o@@ sta treatment groups altogether more than once , and were diagnosed in patients who received Feb@@ ur@@ ost@@ at 80 mg / 120 mg in long @-@ term extension studies ( up to 4 years with an exposure time of &gt; 1,@@ 900 patient years ) , according to the indications . &quot;
the following treatment @-@ related events were either not reported in the pi@@ vot@@ al studies of phase 3 for these doses or with reduced incidence :
&quot; diabetes , hyper@@ li@@ pi@@ de@@ mia , sle@@ e@@ pl@@ ess@@ ness , hyp@@ es@@ thesia , con@@ spic@@ uous EC@@ G , cou@@ gh , short@@ ness , skin disc@@ ol@@ oration , skin les@@ ion , bur@@ si@@ tis , protein ur@@ ie , ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency in the blood , decrease in lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes , decrease in the number of white blood cells . &quot;
&quot; active mechanism of ur@@ ic acid is the end product of Pur@@ in@@ metabol@@ ism in humans , and arises as part of the reaction process Hy@@ po@@ x@@ an@@ thin → X@@ an@@ thin → ur@@ ic acid . &quot;
&quot; Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at is a powerful , non pur@@ pos@@ able inhibit@@ or of X@@ O ( NP @-@ SI@@ x@@ O ) with a K@@ i @-@ value for the in vitro in@@ hibition that is below the nan@@ om@@ ol@@ ar range . &quot;
&quot; clinical study Results The efficacy of A@@ DEN@@ U@@ RI@@ C was shown in two pi@@ vot@@ al studies of Phase 3 ( AP@@ EX trial and F@@ ACT study as described below ) , which were performed with 1.8@@ 32 patients with hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ a@@ emia and g@@ out . &quot;
the primary efficacy end@@ point was in each study the proportion of patients with which the last three month specific Ser@@ um har@@ n@@ acid levels &lt; 6.0 mg / dl ( 357 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) were .
&quot; plac@@ ebo ( n = 134 ) , A@@ DEN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 80 mg 1 x daily ( n = 267 ) , A@@ DEN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 120 mg 1 x daily ( n = 134 ) or Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg 1 x daily ( n = 10 ) for patients with a ser@@ um incre@@ ment value at the start of study of &gt; 1.5 mg / dl and ≤ 2,0 mg / dl . &quot;
the AP@@ EX trial showed a statisti@@ cally significant superi@@ ority of the treatment with A@@ DEN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 80 mg 1 x daily compared with A@@ DEN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 120 mg 1 x daily compared with conventional used cans of allo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg ( n = 258 ) / 100 mg ( n = 10 ) .
the F@@ ACT study showed a statisti@@ cally significant superi@@ ority in treatment with A@@ DEN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 80 mg 1 x daily compared with A@@ DEN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 120 mg 1 x daily compared with the conventional dose Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg .
&quot; patients with ser@@ um car@@ cin@@ oma ( 1.5 and ≤ 2,0 mg / dl ) or 300 mg 1 x daily ( n = 509 ) were summar@@ ized for analysis . * p &lt; 0,@@ 001 versus al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol , # p &lt; 0.0@@ 01 versus 80 mg &quot;
&quot; in the doctor visit during the doctor visit in week 2 , the reduction of the ser@@ um har@@ row acid pi@@ eg@@ le to &lt; 6,0 mg / dl ( 357 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) has been observed throughout the entire treatment . &quot;
&quot; 509 patients received Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg 1 x daily , 10 patients with ser@@ um incre@@ ments &gt; 1.5 and &lt; 2,0 mg / dl received 100 mg 1 x daily . &quot;
primary end@@ point in the sub@@ group of patients with kidney function restriction The AP@@ EX trial evaluated the efficacy of 40 patients with kidney function restriction ( i.e. h ) .
&quot; with A@@ DEN@@ U@@ RI@@ C , the primary efficacy end@@ point was 44 % ( 80 mg 1 x daily ) , 45 % ( 120 mg 1 x daily ) and 60 % ( 240 mg 1 x daily ) of the patient . &quot;
&quot; there was no clin@@ ically significant difference in the percentage revers@@ al of the ser@@ um resin concentrations in subjects , regardless of their ren@@ al function ( 58 % in the group with normal kidney function and 55 % in the group with severe kidney function ) . &quot;
primary end@@ point in the sub@@ group of patients with ser@@ um resin concentrations ≥ 10 mg / dl E@@ tw@@ a 40 % of the patients ( bas@@ eline ) had a ser@@ um resin concentration of ≥ 10 mg / dl .
&quot; the data collected in the open extension study of Phase 3 showed that the permanent reduction of the ser@@ um har@@ dening acid levels to &lt; 6 mg / dl ( &lt; 357 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) showed that less than 3 % of patients needed in the months 16 @-@ 24 ( i.e. more than 97 % of patients needed no treatment against a tray ) . &quot;
&quot; this was associated with a reduction of the peak node size , which resulted in 54 % of patients a complete dis@@ appearance of the g@@ no@@ des until month 24 . &quot;
&quot; increased T@@ SH@@ - values ( &gt; 5.5 µ@@ IE / ml ) were observed in patients receiving long @-@ term treatment with Feb@@ ur@@ ost@@ at ( 5.0 % ) , and also in patients receiving Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( 5.8 % ) in the long @-@ term extension studies ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; in healthy subjects , the maximum plasma concentrations ( C@@ MA@@ x ) and the area below the plasma concentration time curve ( AU@@ C ) increased from Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at after administration of simple and multiple doses of 10 mg to 120 mg dos@@ is@@ proportional . &quot;
&quot; for doses of 120 mg and 300 mg , an increase in AU@@ C is observed for Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at , which is larger than the dos@@ is@@ proportional increase . &quot;
&quot; after taking simple or multiple oral doses of 80 and 120 mg 1 x daily , the C@@ MA@@ x is about 2.8 @-@ 3,2 µ@@ g / ml and 5,0 @-@ 5,@@ 3 µ@@ g / ml . &quot;
&quot; however , no clin@@ ically significant change was observed in the percentage decrease in the ser@@ um dioxide concentration , provided that this has been tested ( multiple doses of 80 mg ) . &quot;
distribution The apparent Ste@@ ady @-@ state distribution volume ( V@@ ss / F ) of Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at is between 29 and 75 l after taking doses of 10 @-@ 300 mg .
&quot; the plasma recording of Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at is about 99.@@ 2 % ( primary binding to alb@@ um@@ in ) and is constant over the concentration width , which is achieved with doses of 80 and 120 mg . &quot;
&quot; in vitro studies in human liver micro@@ som@@ es , these oxid@@ ative metabol@@ ites are mainly formed by C@@ YP@@ 1@@ A1 , C@@ YP@@ 2@@ C8 or C@@ YP@@ 2@@ C@@ 9 , and that Feb@@ ux@@ o@@ stat@@ glu@@ cur@@ on@@ id is mainly created by U@@ GT 1@@ A1 , 1@@ A@@ 8 and 1@@ A@@ 9 . &quot;
&quot; after taking a 80 mg dose of 14@@ C @-@ marked Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at , approximately 49 % of the dose was found in the urine as unchanged Feb@@ ur@@ ost@@ at ( 3 % ) , A@@ cy@@ l@@ glu@@ kur@@ on@@ id of the active substance ( 30 % ) , its known oxid@@ ative metabol@@ ites and their con@@ ju@@ gate ( 13 % ) and as other unknown metabol@@ ites ( 3 % ) . &quot;
&quot; in addition to ex@@ cre@@ tion over the urine , approximately 45 % of the dose in the chair appeared as unchanged Feb@@ ur@@ ost@@ at ( 12 % ) , A@@ cy@@ l@@ glu@@ kur@@ on@@ id of the active substance ( 1 % ) , whose known oxid@@ ative metabol@@ ites and their con@@ ju@@ gate ( 25 % ) and as other unknown metabol@@ ites ( 7 % ) . &quot;
&quot; special Patient Groups ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency After taking multiple doses of 80 mg A@@ DEN@@ U@@ RI@@ C in patients with mild , moderate or severe ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency , the C@@ MA@@ x of Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at did not change in relation to subjects with normal ren@@ al function . &quot;
the mean total AU@@ C of Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at increased by about 1.8 times of 7.5 μ g / ml in the group with normal ren@@ al function to 13.@@ 2 μ g / ml in the group with severe kidney function .
12 Li@@ ver dysfunction After taking multiple doses of 80 mg A@@ DEN@@ U@@ RI@@ C in patients with mild ( Chil@@ d- Pu@@ gh @-@ Classi@@ fication A ) or moderate ( Child @-@ Pu@@ gh @-@ Classi@@ fication B ) Li@@ ver dysfunction changed significantly compared to subjects with normal liver function .
age There were no significant changes in regard to the AU@@ C of Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at or its metabol@@ ites after taking multiple oral doses of A@@ DEN@@ U@@ RI@@ C in older patients compared to younger subjects .
&quot; car@@ cin@@ ogen@@ esis , mut@@ agen@@ esis , imp@@ airment of fertility In male rats was found a statisti@@ cally significant increase in ur@@ inary bladder tum@@ ours ( transi@@ tional cell pap@@ ill@@ omes and car@@ cin@@ omas ) only in connection with X@@ an@@ thin stones in the highly dos@@ ed treated group , with approximately the 11 times of exposure to humans . &quot;
these findings are seen as a result of a specific pur@@ in@@ metabolism and urine composition and considered not relevant for clinical use .
it was found that Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at has no effect on fertility and reproductive performance of male and female rats .
&quot; with high doses , which were about the 4 @-@ times of human therapeutic exposure , mat@@ ernal toxic@@ ity occurred , the mat@@ ernal toxic@@ ity associated with a decrease in the performance and a develop@@ mental delay in the descendants of rats . &quot;
&quot; ter@@ at@@ ological studies in carrying rats with ex@@ positions , which are about 4.3 times and in carrying rab@@ bits with ex@@ positions , which have about 13 times of human therapeutic exposure , have no ter@@ at@@ ogenic effects . &quot;
Col@@ chic@@ ine / In@@ dom@@ et@@ ac@@ in / Hydro@@ chlor@@ thi@@ azi@@ de / War@@ far@@ in Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at can be used together with Col@@ chic@@ ine or In@@ dom@@ et@@ ac@@ in without a dose adjustment for Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at or the concur@@ rent other active ingredient is required .
&quot; di@@ arr@@ ho@@ ea , nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting are more common in patients who are treated with Col@@ chic@@ ine at the same time . * * In the clinical trials , no severe skin r@@ ashes or severe hyper@@ sensitivity reactions were observed . &quot;
&quot; 21 Open long @-@ term extension studies In the open long @-@ term extension studies were treated 906 patients up to 1 year long , 322 patients up to 2 years long , 57 patients up to 4 years with Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at 80 mg / 120 mg . &quot;

&quot; after taking multiple doses of 80 mg A@@ DEN@@ U@@ RI@@ C in patients with mild ( Chil@@ d- Pu@@ gh @-@ Classi@@ fication A ) or moderate ( Child @-@ Pu@@ gh @-@ Classi@@ fication B ) , the C@@ MA@@ x and AU@@ C of Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at and its metabol@@ ites did not significantly change compared to subjects with normal liver function . &quot;

&quot; the owner of the authorization for the market has made sure that a pharmac@@ ovi@@ gil@@ ance system is described as in version 2.0 module 1.@@ 8.1 of the authorisation application , before the medicine is brought into the traffic , and as long as the medicine is brought into the traffic . &quot;
&quot; according to CH@@ MP Gui@@ del@@ ine , an updated R@@ MP is to be presented with the next Peri@@ odic Safety Update Report ( P@@ SUR ) according to CH@@ MP Gui@@ del@@ ine . &quot;
&quot; in addition , an update of the R@@ MP is required • if new information is available , which have an impact on the safety data , the pharmac@@ ovi@@ gil@@ ance plan or activities for risk management , within 60 days after reaching important mil@@ estones ( pharmac@@ ovi@@ gil@@ ance or risk minim@@ ization ) • on request of the E@@ MEA &quot;
in some people the ur@@ ic acid accum@@ ulates in the blood and can reach concentrations that are so high that ur@@ ic acid is in@@ soluble .
&quot; if you hold the acid concentration through the 1 x daily intake of A@@ DEN@@ U@@ RI@@ C , the formation of cryst@@ alli@@ zation prevents the formation of cryst@@ alli@@ zation . &quot;
A@@ DEN@@ U@@ RI@@ C must not be taken if you are hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to the active ingredient Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at or any of the ingredients of A@@ DEN@@ U@@ RI@@ C .
&quot; inform your doctor before taking this medicine if you have a heart weakness , or suffer from any other heart problem . • If you suffer from a high acid concentration in a result of a cancer disease or the Les@@ ch @-@ Ny@@ han syn@@ dro@@ mes ( a rare con@@ genital disease in which too much ur@@ ic acid is in the blood ) . &quot;
&quot; if you have an attack at the moment ( sudden appearance of severe pain , sensitivity , red@@ ness , warmth and joint swelling ) , wait until the peak of the peak before you begin with the treatment with A@@ DEN@@ U@@ RI@@ C . &quot;
&quot; this does not have to be with everyone , but may also occur with you , especially during the first treatment weeks or - months , if you are taking A@@ DEN@@ U@@ RI@@ C . &quot;
&quot; your doctor will prescri@@ be other medicines if necessary , to prevent an attack or to treat the symptoms associated with it ( such as pain and joint swelling ) . &quot;
&quot; please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you are taking other medicines or used recently , even if it is not prescription medicine . &quot;
it is particularly important to inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you are taking medicines that may appear one of the following substances as interactions with A@@ DEN@@ U@@ RI@@ C may appear and your doctor may consider necessary measures . • The@@ ophy@@ ll@@ in ( for treating as@@ thma ) • War@@ far@@ in ( for blood di@@ lution in cardiac disease )
no studies have been carried out on the effects of A@@ DEN@@ U@@ RI@@ C on transport and the ability to serve machines .

&quot; AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is used to treat oste@@ opor@@ osis ( one disease in which the bones are br@@ ittle ) in women after men@@ op@@ ause , in which there is a risk of a small vitamin D mirror . &quot;
&quot; the patient must take the tablet with a full glass of water ( no mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before eating , drinking or taking other medicines ( including ant@@ acids , calcium and vitamin supplements ) . &quot;
&quot; in order to avoid irrit@@ ation of the o@@ es@@ oph@@ agus , the patient may not lie down until after the first dietary intake of the day , which should take place at the earliest 30 minutes after taking the tablet . &quot;
&quot; since Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at and vitamin D3 can already be used separately from each other in pharmaceuticals that are approved in the European Union , the company submitted data from previous studies and published literature . &quot;
the company also conducted a study of 35 men and 68@@ 2 post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women with oste@@ opor@@ osis in order to prove the effectiveness of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE in terms of increasing the vitamin D mirror .
&quot; after a 15 week treatment , the proportion of patients with low vitamin D levels in patients treated with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE was lower ( 11 % ) than those who only recorded Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate ( 32 % ) . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the company presented data that stipul@@ ate that the Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at dose contained in AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is exactly the dose required for preventing bone loss . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects ( observed from 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are head@@ aches , pain of the mus@@ cul@@ os@@ kel@@ etal system ( muscles , bones or joints ) and symptoms of the diges@@ tive system such as abdominal pain , dy@@ sp@@ ep@@ sia ( di@@ arr@@ ho@@ ea ) , ul@@ cer ( ul@@ fed ) , dy@@ sph@@ ag@@ ia ( swal@@ lowing ) , infl@@ ated abdom@@ en ( b@@ lower abdom@@ en ) , as well as aci@@ dic tum@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; in patients with any hyper@@ sensitivity ( allergy ) against algae dr@@ on@@ ate , vitamin D3 or any of the other components , AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE may not be applied . &quot;
&quot; it may not be applied in case of diseases of the o@@ es@@ oph@@ agus , in patients with hypo@@ cal@@ c@@ emia ( low calcium levels ) or in patients who cannot stand or sit for at least 30 minutes . &quot;
&quot; in January 2007 , the European Commission issued a permit for the company Mer@@ ck Shar@@ p &amp; Doh@@ me Ltd . &quot;
&quot; capsule @-@ shaped , white to broken white tablets , marked with the outline of a bone on one side and &quot; 710 &quot; on the other side . &quot;
&quot; AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is only available with water ( not mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before the first food , drink or intake of medicines ( including ant@@ acids , calcium and vitamin supplements ) for the day . &quot;
follow these instructions carefully to reduce the risk of mal@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irrit@@ ation and related side effects ( see section 4.4 ) :
&quot; • AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE should only be swal@@ lowed with a full glass of water ( at least 200 ml ) after the day , as there is a risk of or@@ op@@ har@@ yn@@ ge@@ al ul@@ cer@@ a . • Patients should not be taken before the first dietary intake of the day , which should take place at the earliest 30 minutes after taking the tablet . &quot;
&quot; e.g. pep@@ tic ul@@ cer , active g@@ astro@@ intestinal bleeding or surgical procedures in the upper Gast@@ ro@@ intestinal tract besides P@@ yl@@ or@@ op@@ last@@ y , be given only under special care ( see section 4.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al reactions , such as es@@ oph@@ agi@@ tis , mal@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al ul@@ cer@@ a and mal@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al ero@@ sions , were reported in patients under the intake of Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate ( partially these were severe and required a hospital assignment ) . &quot;
&quot; therefore , the doctor should draw attention to all signs and symptoms that respond to possible mal@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al reactions and patients should be advised to susp@@ end symptoms of mal@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irrit@@ ation like dy@@ sph@@ ag@@ ia , pain during swal@@ lowing or retro@@ stern@@ al pain or new or wor@@ sen@@ ing heart@@ burn , and seek medical advice ( see section 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; 3 The risk of severe mal@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al side effects seems to be increased in patients who don &apos;t take the medicine correctly and / or , after the occurrence of symptoms , which indicate a mal@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irrit@@ ation . &quot;
it is very important that all dosage instructions are passed on to the patient and understood by the patient ( see section 4.2 ) .
&quot; while in large @-@ scale clinical studies with Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at no higher risk was observed , stomach and du@@ oden@@ al ul@@ cer@@ es were rarely reported ( see section 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; oste@@ o@@ arthritis of the jaw , usually associated with tooth extraction and / or a local infection ( including oste@@ omyel@@ itis ) , was reported in cancer patients whose therapy regime mainly administered intra@@ ven@@ ously administered bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; there are no data available , indicating whether the treatment of a bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate therapy in patients who require or@@ tho@@ don@@ tic surgery , reduces the risk of oste@@ o@@ arthritis of the jaw . &quot;
the clinical assessment by the attending physician is author@@ it@@ ative for the treatment planning in each patient based on an individual benefit @-@ risk assessment .
patients should be instruc@@ ted that they should take the dose AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE the next morning during the removal of a dose AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE after they have noticed their failure .
&quot; you should not take two tablets the same day , but take the intake of one tablet per week as originally planned on the scheduled day of the week . &quot;
other diseases affecting mineral metabolism ( such as vitamin D deficiency and hyp@@ op@@ ar@@ ath@@ y@@ re@@ o@@ idi@@ sm ) should also be treated adequately before the treatment with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE .
&quot; al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate foods and beverages ( including mineral water ) , calcium supplements , ant@@ acids and some oral medicines can affect the absorption of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate if they are taken at the same time . &quot;
&quot; therefore , after taking Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at , patients must wait at least 30 minutes before taking other drugs ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 5.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; although specific interaction studies were not conducted , Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate was taken in clinical trials together with a variety of commonly prescribed medicines without clin@@ ically relevant interactions . &quot;
AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is intended for use only for post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women and is therefore neither used during pregnancy or breast @-@ feeding women .
&quot; animal studies with al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate do not indicate directly harmful effects with regard to pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al or post@@ nat@@ al development . &quot;
oste@@ o@@ arthritis of the jaw was reported in patients with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates ; most reports stem from cancer patients but was also reported in oste@@ opor@@ osis patients .
&quot; however , the Ser@@ um Cal@@ cium received up to &lt; 8,0 mg / dl ( 2,0 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and the Ser@@ um @-@ phosph@@ ate up to ≤ 2,0 mg / dl ( 0.@@ 65 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) in both treatment groups with similar frequency . &quot;
&quot; Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate In@@ take of an oral over@@ dose can occur hypo@@ cal@@ c@@ emia , hyp@@ oph@@ osph@@ ate and side effects in the upper Gast@@ ro@@ intestinal tract such as stomach up@@ set , heart@@ burn , ec@@ oph@@ agi@@ tis , gast@@ ri@@ tis or Ul@@ zer@@ a . &quot;

after 15 @-@ week treatment the middle ser@@ um levels of 25 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ vitamin D were significantly higher ( 26 % ) in the group under AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE ( 70 mg / 2.@@ 800 I.@@ E. ) ( 56 n@@ mo@@ l / l &#91; 23 ng / ml &#93; ) than in the group under Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at alone ( 46 n@@ mo@@ l / l &#91; 18.@@ 2 ng / ml &#93; ) .
&quot; after 15 weeks , AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE ( 70 mg / 2.@@ 800 I.@@ E. ) lowered the proportion of patients with vitamin D in@@ suffici@@ ency ( ser@@ um value of 25 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ vitamin D &lt; 37,@@ 5 n@@ mo@@ l / l &#91; &lt; 15 ng / ml &#93; ) by 6@@ 2.5 % compared to al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate alone ( 12 % vs . &quot;

the effects of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate on bone mass and frac@@ tures in post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women were examined in two phase III studies of identical design ( n = 9@@ 44 ) as well as in the Fra@@ ktur @-@ Inter@@ ven@@ tions@@ - Study ( F@@ IT : n = 6.@@ 459 ) .
&quot; in phase III studies , the middle asc@@ ents of the BM@@ D with Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at 10 mg / day in relation to plac@@ ebo after 3 years 8.3 % at the spinal column , 5.@@ 9 % at the fem@@ ur neck and 7.8 % at the con@@ sol@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; in the group treated with Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate , a reduction of 48 % ( al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate 3.2 % compared to plac@@ ebo 6.6 % ) was achieved in the proportion of patients who suffered one or more spinal frac@@ tures . &quot;
&quot; in the two @-@ year extension of these studies , the asc@@ ents of the BM@@ D of spine and con@@ sol@@ ation continued to maintain ; also the BM@@ D of the fem@@ ur neck and the whole body was maintained . &quot;
&quot; fit consisted of two plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled studies where Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate was taken daily ( 5 m@@ g. daily over 2 years and afterwards 10 mg daily , either over 1 or 2 years ) : &quot;
&quot; in this study , the daily gift of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate reduced the incidence of at least one new vert@@ ebral fra@@ cture by 47 % ( Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at 7.9 % compared to plac@@ ebo 15.@@ 0 % ) . &quot;
res@@ or@@ ption Be@@ ading on an intra@@ ven@@ ous reference dose was the mean oral bio@@ availability of Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at in women 0.@@ 64 % for doses between 5 and 70 m@@ g. after ni@@ ghtly fasting and two hours before taking a standardized breakfast .
bio@@ availability decreased accordingly to about 0.@@ 46 % and 0.@@ 39 % when Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at was taken one or half an hour before a standardized breakfast .
&quot; in oste@@ opor@@ os@@ estu@@ dia , Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate was effective if it was taken at least 30 minutes before the first food or drink of the day . &quot;
&quot; in healthy subjects , the gift of oral pre@@ d@@ nis@@ one ( 20 mg three times daily over five days ) led to no clin@@ ically significant change in the oral bio@@ availability of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate ( increase in the range from 20 % to 44 % ) . &quot;
&quot; 9 distribution studies on rats have shown that Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at is temporarily distributed in soft tissue after intra@@ ven@@ ous gift of 1 mg / kg , but then quickly circul@@ ates into the bones or ex@@ cre@@ ted with the urine . &quot;
&quot; ex@@ cre@@ tion After intra@@ ven@@ ous administration of a single dose of 14@@ C @-@ al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate , approximately 50 % of radio@@ active substances were ex@@ cre@@ ted within 72 hours with urine and little or no radio@@ activity was found in the waste . &quot;
&quot; after an intra@@ ven@@ ous dose of 10 mg , the ren@@ al clearing of Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at was 71 ml / min and the system@@ ic clear@@ ance was not 200 ml / min . &quot;
&quot; Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at is not ex@@ cre@@ ted by the kid@@ neys via the acid or alkal@@ ine transport system , and therefore it is not assumed that it affects the ex@@ cre@@ tion of other drugs by these transport systems . &quot;

&quot; in case of radio@@ activity marked vitamin D3 , the mean ex@@ cre@@ tion of radio@@ activity in the urine after 48 hours was 2.4 % , in the subjects after 4 days 4.9 % . &quot;
&quot; characteristics in patients pre@@ clinical studies have shown that the proportion of algae growth , which is not depos@@ ited in the bone , is quickly ex@@ cre@@ ted via urine . &quot;
&quot; although no clinical data is available , it is nevertheless expected that the ren@@ al elimination of algae dr@@ on@@ at as in animal experiments will also be reduced in patients with reduced kidney function . &quot;
&quot; therefore , in patients with reduced ren@@ al function , a slightly increased cum@@ ulation of algae growth in bone can be expected ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot;

&quot; due to clin@@ ically relevant differences in system@@ ic exposure of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , this can lead to gra@@ ft rejection or an increased incidence of side effects , including under@@ - or immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression . &quot;
patients should always maintain the same tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus formulation and the appropriate daily dose ; changes in the formulation or regime should only be carried out under close @-@ mes@@ hed control of a physician experienced in transplan@@ tation ( see Sec@@ tions 4.4 and 4.8 ) .
&quot; following a transition to an alternative formulation , a therapeutic drug control and appropriate dose adjustment must be performed to ensure that the system@@ ic exposure of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus remains intact . &quot;
the dosage of Adv@@ ant@@ f should primarily be based on the clinical assessment of rejection and toler@@ ability in the individual case and on blood level measurements ( see below &quot; Recommen@@ dations
&quot; after switching from Pro@@ gra@@ f to Adv@@ agra@@ ph , the tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus panels should be checked before the conversion and over two weeks after conversion . &quot;
&quot; on Day 4 , system@@ ic exposure , measured as tal@@ low level , was comparable to both ni@@ er@@ a- and liver transplan@@ ted patients . &quot;
careful and repeated checks of the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus level mirrors are recommended during the first two weeks after transplan@@ tation below Adv@@ agra@@ ph to ensure proper substance exposure in immediate post@@ transplan@@ t phase .
&quot; since Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus is a substance with low clearance , an adjustment of the Adv@@ section can take several days until the Ste@@ ady State is reached . &quot;
&quot; if the patient &apos;s condition is not permitted in the first post@@ operative phase , the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus treatment can be treated intra@@ ven@@ ously ( Pro@@ gra@@ f 5 mg / ml of concentrate to produce an in@@ fusion solution ) with a dose of approx . &quot;
&quot; duration of the application For supp@@ ression of the gra@@ ft rejection , immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression must be maintained ; consequently , a maximum duration of oral therapy cannot be specified . &quot;
dosage recommendation - kidney transplan@@ tation proph@@ yla@@ xis of transplan@@ t rejection The oral Adv@@ ant@@ al Treatment should begin with 0.@@ 20 - 0.@@ 30 mg / kg / day as a daily gift in the morning .
further dose adap@@ tations can be needed later as the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can change in the course of stabil@@ isation of the patient after transplan@@ tation .
dosage recommendation - Li@@ ver transplan@@ tation proph@@ yla@@ xis of transplan@@ t rejection The oral Adv@@ ant@@ al Treatment should begin with 0.@@ 10 - 0.@@ 20 mg / kg / day as a daily gift in the morning .
&quot; dosage recommendation - Pro@@ gra@@ f conversion from Pro@@ gra@@ f to Adv@@ agra@@ ph must be converted to a daily intake of Pro@@ gra@@ f capsules on a daily intake of Adv@@ agra@@ ph 1 : 1 ( mg : mg ) , related to the whole daily dose . &quot;
kidney and liver transplan@@ tation After a conversion from other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants to Adv@@ agra@@ ph once daily treatment with the oral initi@@ al@@ dose recommended for kidney and liver transplan@@ tation should begin for the proph@@ yla@@ xis of transplan@@ t rejection .
&quot; heart transplan@@ tation In adult patients who are converted to Adv@@ agra@@ ph , an oral initi@@ al@@ dose of 0,15 mg / kg / day is taken daily once in the morning . &quot;
&quot; other transplan@@ t recipients , although there is no clinical experience with adv@@ agra@@ ph@@ ous , pancre@@ atic and intestinal transplan@@ ted patients , occurred in an oral initi@@ al@@ dose of 0.2 mg / kg / day and on intestinal transplan@@ t recipients in an oral initi@@ al@@ dose of 0.3 mg / kg / day . &quot;
dose adap@@ tations in special patient groups patients with reduced liver function In order to maintain blood tal@@ low in the targeted area can be required in patients with severe liver dys@@ functions .
&quot; patients with reduced ren@@ al function Since the ren@@ al function does not affect the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , it can be assumed that a dose adjustment is not required . &quot;
&quot; however , due to the ne@@ phr@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic potential of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , careful monitoring of the ren@@ al function ( including a regular determination of the ser@@ um kre@@ at@@ in@@ insp@@ iegel , a calculation of the cre@@ atine level and a monitoring of the ur@@ inary volume ) is recommended . &quot;
change@@ over from C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in to Adv@@ ant@@ f When switching from a C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in to a Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus @-@ based therapy is advised ( see Sec@@ tions 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
recommendations on the blood level in full blood The dose should primarily be based on the clinical assessment of rejection and toler@@ ability in the individual case using the aid of thorou@@ gh@@ bred tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus tal@@ low @-@ level controls .
&quot; it is recommended to perform frequent checks of the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus test mirror during the first two weeks after transplan@@ tation , followed by peri@@ odic checks during maintenance therapy . &quot;
&quot; blood tal@@ low levels of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus should also be checked after switching from Pro@@ gra@@ f to Adv@@ agra@@ ph , Dos@@ age adjustment , alter@@ ations of immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy , or with the simultaneous use of substances that could alter the tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus whole blood concentration ( see Section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; since Adv@@ agra@@ ph is a medicine with a low clearance , the dose may require several days until the Ste@@ ady State has entered . &quot;
clinical studies indicate that successful treatment is possible in most cases when the blood levels in blood 20 ng / ml are not exceeded .
&quot; in clinical practice , the body level of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus in the whole blood in the first time after liver transplan@@ tation is usually in the range of 5 - 20 ng / ml , and with heart transplan@@ ted patients 10 - 20 ng / ml . &quot;
&quot; during the subsequent maintenance therapy of liver , ren@@ al and heart transplan@@ t recipients , blood concentrations were generally used in the range of 5 - 15 ng / ml . &quot;
&quot; this has resulted in serious adverse events , including gra@@ ft rejection or other side effects , which may occur in a sequence of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus sub@@ - or over@@ exposure . &quot;
patients should always maintain the same tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus formulation and the appropriate daily dose ; changes in the formulation or regime should only be carried out under close @-@ mes@@ hed control of a physician experienced in transplan@@ tation ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 4.8 ) .
&quot; 5 To the treatment of adult patients with gra@@ ft rejection , which proved to be treated against other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants , no clinical data are still available for the re@@ tar@@ ded formulation . &quot;
&quot; for the proph@@ yla@@ xis of gra@@ ft rejection in adult heart transplan@@ t recep@@ tions and transplan@@ t recipients in childhood , no clinical data are still available for the re@@ tar@@ ded formulation . &quot;
&quot; due to possible interactions which can lead to a degra@@ dation of the tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus levels in the blood and a weak@@ ening of the clinical effect of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , the intake of herbal supplements , the Johannis@@ k@@ raut ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) , or other herbal remedies should be avoided during treatment with Adv@@ ant@@ al ( see Section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients with di@@ arr@@ ho@@ ea , a particularly careful monitoring of the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus@@ - concentrations in the blood is provided , as the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus blood levels may be subject to considerable fluctu@@ ations in such circumstances . &quot;
&quot; in rare cases , a chamber or sep@@ tum hyper@@ tro@@ phy described as cardi@@ om@@ y@@ opathy was observed under Pro@@ gra@@ f , which can therefore also occur under Adv@@ ant@@ f . &quot;
&quot; other factors that increase the risk of such clinical disorders are an existing heart disease , a treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , hyper@@ tension , ren@@ al or liver dysfunction , infections , fluid over@@ loading and oil . &quot;
&quot; as with other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants , exposure to sunlight or UV light should be restricted because of the possible risk of mal@@ ign@@ ant skin les@@ ions due to suitable clothing or use of a s@@ uns@@ creen with a high protection factor . &quot;
&quot; if patients who take tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , symptoms for PRE@@ S such as head@@ aches , altered state of consciousness , cr@@ amps and vision disorders , there should be a radi@@ ological examination ( e.g. . &quot;
&quot; there are special caution in patients with rare her@@ edit@@ ary gal@@ act@@ ose intoler@@ ance , l@@ act@@ ase deficiency or glucose @-@ gal@@ act@@ ose mal@@ absorption . &quot;
&quot; the simultaneous use of medicines or herbal remedies known as inhibit@@ ors or induc@@ tors of C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 can affect the metabolism of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , and consequently increase or decrease blood levels of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus . &quot;
&quot; it is recommended therefore to monitor the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus@@ - blood level while offering substances that can change the C@@ YP@@ 3A metabolism , and adjust the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus dosage accordingly ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; with anti @-@ angi@@ ot@@ ics such as k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole , flu@@ con@@ az@@ ole , I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole and V@@ ori@@ con@@ az@@ ole and with the Macro@@ eyel@@ id antibiotic er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin and HIV prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors ( z . &quot;
&quot; pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic studies showed that the rise in blood levels mainly resulted from the increased oral bio@@ availability of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , caused by inhibit@@ ing the g@@ astro@@ intestinal metabolism . &quot;
&quot; highly dos@@ ed pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ one or meth@@ yl@@ pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ on , as used in acute rejection reactions , can increase or decrease the concentration of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus in the blood . &quot;
&quot; action of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus on the metabolism of other drugs tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus is known as C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ or ; therefore , the simultaneous application of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus with medicines that can be met@@ ab@@ oli@@ zed by C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 can affect their metabolism . &quot;
&quot; as tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can reduce the clear@@ ance of ster@@ oid contra@@ cep@@ tives , so that the hormone exposure can increase , decisions are particularly cau@@ tious in decisions on prevention @-@ prevention measures . &quot;
the results of animal testing showed that Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus could potentially l@@ essen the clearance of Pent@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al and Phen@@ az@@ on and extend its half @-@ life time .
the results of a small number of transplan@@ t patients have no indication that under tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus compared to other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants there is an increased risk of adverse events with regard to the course and outcome of pregnancy .
&quot; in uter@@ o exposure , a monitoring of the new@@ born is recommended for det@@ ri@@ mental effects of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus ( especially regarding its effect on the kid@@ neys ) . &quot;
&quot; there is the risk of premature birth ( &lt; week 37 ) and hyper@@ emia of the new@@ born ( incidence of 8 of 111 new@@ bor@@ ns , i.e. : &quot;
the support profile of immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ si@@ va is often not possible because of the under@@ nouris@@ hment of the patient and the simultaneous treatment with a variety of other medicines .

cases of BK @-@ Virus @-@ associated N@@ eph@@ rop@@ athy and J@@ C @-@ Virus @-@ associated progressive multi@@ focal leu@@ ko@@ encephal@@ opathy ( P@@ ML ) were reported in patients with immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy including therapy with adv@@ agra@@ f .
it was reported about ben@@ ign or mal@@ ign@@ ant ne@@ oplas@@ ms including EB@@ V@@ - associated lymp@@ ho@@ prolifer@@ ative diseases and skin tum@@ ors associated with the treatment with tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus .
&quot; due to its high molecular weight , its low water sol@@ ub@@ ility and the high binding of er@@ y@@ thro@@ cy@@ tes and plasma proteins , tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus cannot be di@@ aly@@ zed . &quot;
action mechanism and pharmac@@ o@@ dynamic effects on the molecular level should be convey@@ ed the effects of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus due to its binding to a cy@@ tos@@ ol protein ( F@@ KB@@ P@@ 12 ) which is responsible for the enrich@@ ment of the connection in the cell inner .
this leads to a cal@@ ci@@ um@@ dependent in@@ hibition of signal trans@@ duction units in the T cell and thus prevents tran@@ scription of a certain number of lymp@@ ho@@ kin genes .
&quot; tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus inhi@@ bits the activation of T cells and the prolifer@@ ation of the B cells dependent on T @-@ Hel@@ fer@@ cells ( such as inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 2 , inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 3 and γ @-@ interfer@@ on ) as well as the expression of the inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 2 recep@@ tor . &quot;
&quot; in the first 24 weeks , 12 approved acute imp@@ urities amounted to 32.@@ 6 % within the first 24 weeks ( N = 237 ) , 32.@@ 6 % and in the Pro@@ gra@@ f Group ( N = 234 ) 29.@@ 3 % . &quot;
&quot; patients @-@ survival rates after 12 months were up to 8@@ 9.3 % for Pro@@ gra@@ f ; in the previous arm 25 ( 14 women , 11 men ) and in Pro@@ gra@@ f arm 24 ( 5 women , 19 men ) died . &quot;

&quot; incidence of therapy failure after 12 months ( defined as death , transplan@@ t loss , bi@@ op@@ sy @-@ confirmed acute rejection or lack of follow @-@ up data ) was 14.@@ 0 % in the Pro@@ gra@@ f Group ( N = 212 ) and 17.@@ 0 % in the group ( N = 212 ) . &quot;

&quot; published results of primary immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression with Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus in the form of twice daily Pro@@ gra@@ f capsules after other primary organ transplan@@ tations Pro@@ gra@@ f has developed into a recognized primary immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ant after pancre@@ atic , lung and intestinal transplan@@ tation . &quot;
&quot; 175 patients transplan@@ ted , with 475 patients who had under@@ gone a pancre@@ atic transplan@@ tation , and in 630 cases after an intestinal transplan@@ t was used as a primary immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive . &quot;
&quot; overall , the safety profile of oral Pro@@ gra@@ f in these published studies correspon@@ ded to observations in the large studies where Pro@@ gra@@ f was used in liver , kidney and heart transplan@@ t recipients into primary immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression . &quot;
&quot; lung Transplan@@ t In an interim analysis about a recently conducted , multi @-@ centric study with oral pro@@ gra@@ f was reported over 110 patients receiving either tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus or c@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in within 1 : 1 random@@ ization . &quot;
&quot; chronic gra@@ ft rejection , bron@@ chi@@ oli@@ tis ob@@ liter@@ ans@@ - syndrome , was less common in the first year after transplan@@ tation ( 2.@@ 86 % versus 8.@@ 57 % ) . &quot;
&quot; survival after a year was 8@@ 0.8 % in the tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus@@ - and 83 % in the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in group ( Tre@@ ede et al . , 3rd IC@@ I San Diego , USA , 2004 ; abstract 22 ) . &quot;
&quot; in the patients treated with tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , in 21.@@ 7 % of cases the incidence of a bron@@ chi@@ oli@@ tis ob@@ liter@@ ans was compared to 38.@@ 0 % below C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( p = 0.0@@ 25 ) . &quot;
&quot; the number of cases where C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in had to be converted to tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus ( n = 13 ) was significantly bigger ( p = 0,@@ 02 ) than the number of patients who were killed by tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus on C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( n = 2 ) ( Ke@@ en@@ an et al . , Ann Thor@@ ac@@ ic Sur@@ g 1995 ; 60 : 580 ) . &quot;
&quot; the number of cases in which there was no acute transplan@@ t impact , was after 6 months ( 57,@@ 7 % versus 45.@@ 8 % ) and after 1 year ( 50 % versus 33.@@ 3 % ) in the transplan@@ ted patients of the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus Group ( Tre@@ ede et al . , J Heart L@@ ung Transplan@@ t 2001 ; 20 : 511 ) . &quot;
in one study the incidence of the birth of a bron@@ chi@@ oli@@ tis ob@@ liter@@ ans@@ - syn@@ dro@@ mes in patients treated with tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus was significantly lower .
a multi @-@ centr@@ alised study with oral pro@@ gra@@ f was performed on 205 patients who were treated at the same time as a pancre@@ atic and kidney transplan@@ tation which random@@ ized Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus ( n = 103 ) or C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( n = 102 ) .
the oral initi@@ al@@ dose ( per protocol ) of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus was 0.2 mg / kg / day and was then used to achieve the desired level levels of 8 to 15 ng / ml at 5 .
&quot; the published clinical results of a mono@@ cl@@ eric study with oral Pro@@ gra@@ f as primary immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ant after intestinal transplan@@ ts showed up to 155 patients ( 65 only intest@@ ines , 75 liver and intest@@ ines and 25 mul@@ tiv@@ is@@ cer@@ al transplan@@ ts ) under Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus and Pre@@ d@@ nis@@ on an updated survival rate of 75 % after 1 year , 5 % after 5 years and 42 % after 10 years . &quot;
&quot; methods for early detection of Ep@@ stein @-@ Bar@@ r ( EB@@ V ) and CM@@ V infection , bone mar@@ row enlargement , additional administration of the inter@@ leu@@ kin 2 antagon@@ ist Dac@@ li@@ zumab , lower initial doses of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , which lead to talent between 10 and 15 ng / ml and latest transplan@@ t radiation ( Abu @-@ El@@ mag@@ d et al . , Ann Sur@@ g 2001 ; 234 : 404 ) . &quot;
&quot; factors such as low hem@@ at@@ rit@@ es and low protein concentrations , which lead to an increase in the un@@ bound fraction of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , or a rein@@ forcement of metabolism induced by treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , should be responsible for the higher clearing rates observed after transplan@@ tation . &quot;
&quot; this can be concluded that tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus is almost completely met@@ ab@@ oli@@ zed before ex@@ cre@@ tion , whereby ex@@ cre@@ tion is mainly done via the bil@@ e . &quot;
&quot; in stable patients treated by Pro@@ gra@@ f ( twice daily ) in the ratio of 1 : 1 ( mg : mg ) in relation to the total daily dose , system@@ ic exposure of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus ( AU@@ C@@ 0 @-@ 24 ) was approximately 10 % lower than under Pro@@ gra@@ f . &quot;
&quot; it is recommended to perform frequent checks of the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus test mirror during the first two weeks after transplan@@ tation , followed by peri@@ odic checks during maintenance therapy . &quot;

&quot; adv@@ ent is used to treat and prevent bleeding in patients with hem@@ op@@ hi@@ lia A ( a blood cl@@ ot@@ ting disorder caused by the lack of factor VIII , con@@ genital blood co@@ ag@@ ulation disorder ) . &quot;
the dosage and frequency of the application depend on whether Adv@@ oc@@ ate is applied for the treatment of bleeding or preventing bleeding from surgical procedures .
&quot; patients with hem@@ op@@ hi@@ lia A suffer from a factor VIII deficiency , causing blood cl@@ ot@@ ting problems such as bleeding in joints , muscles or inner organs . &quot;
&quot; Oc@@ to@@ co@@ g al@@ fa is not extracted from human plasma but is produced by a method called &quot; &quot; re@@ combin@@ ant DNA technology &quot; &quot; : &quot;
&quot; it is produced by a cell , into which a gene ( DNA ) has been brought into the formation of the human cl@@ ot@@ ting factor VIII . &quot;
&quot; Adv@@ ate is similar to another drug called Rec@@ om@@ bin@@ ate , but is made differently , so that the medicine does not contain human or animal origin proteins . &quot;
&quot; in three additional studies of patients with severe to moderate hem@@ op@@ hi@@ lia A , including a study with 53 children under six years , the treatment of the medicine was examined for preventing bleeding and surgical procedures . &quot;
&quot; in the main study , the effectiveness of adv@@ ent in the prevention of bleeding in 86 % of 510 new blood sep@@ is@@ odes was &quot; &quot; excellent &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; good &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of advoc@@ ate ( observed with 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are di@@ zz@@ iness , head@@ ache , py@@ re@@ x@@ ie ( fever ) and the formation of antibodies against factor VIII . &quot;
&quot; advoc@@ ates may not be applied to patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to the human inst@@ ability factor VIII , mouse or hamster protein or any of the other ingredients . &quot;
&quot; in March 2004 , the European Commission issued a permit for the company B@@ ax@@ ter AG to establish advoc@@ ates in the entire European Union . &quot;
&quot; dosage The dosage and duration of the sub@@ stitution therapy depend on the sever@@ ity of the factor VIII deficiency , according to the location and the extent of bleeding and the patient &apos;s clinical condition . &quot;
&quot; in the following hem@@ or@@ rh@@ ag@@ ic events , the factor VIII activity in the corresponding period is not to fall under the specified plas@@ m@@ asp@@ iegel ( in % of the standard or in I.@@ E. / dl ) . &quot;
&quot; injection every 12 @-@ 24 hours ( 8 @-@ 24 hours in patients under 6 years ) for 3 @-@ 4 days or longer , until the pain and acute imp@@ airment are eliminated . &quot;
repeat every 8 @-@ 24 hours ( 6 @-@ 12 hours in patients under 6 years ) until the risk is passed for the patient .
&quot; during the course of the treatment , the dosage and frequency of inj@@ ections are recommended to determine the factor VIII . &quot;
&quot; individual patients may differ in their response to factor VIII , different in vi@@ vo recovery and exhibit different half @-@ value times . &quot;
3 proph@@ yla@@ xis for long @-@ term proph@@ yla@@ xis of bleeding in patients with severe hem@@ op@@ hi@@ lia A should be given doses between 20 and 40 I.@@ U. of factor VIII per kg body weight in a distance of 2 @-@ 3 days .
&quot; if the expected Factor VIII can not be achieved or if the bleeding has not been controlled with a reasonable dose , a test must be performed to detect an inhibit@@ or . &quot;
&quot; in patients with high inhibit@@ ors , it is possible that the factor VIII therapy is not effective , so that other therapeutic measures have to be wo@@ ken . &quot;
&quot; the dosage speed should depend on the patient &apos;s condition , whereby a maximum injection rate of 10 ml / min should not be exceeded . &quot;
the formation of neutr@@ alizing antibodies ( inhibit@@ ors ) against factor VIII is a well known comp@@ lication in the treatment of patients with hem@@ op@@ hi@@ lia A .
these inhibit@@ ors are always against the pro@@ ko@@ ag@@ ul@@ atory activity of factor VIII @-@ oriented Ig@@ G immun@@ og@@ lob@@ ul@@ ins that are quanti@@ fied in Be@@ thes@@ da units ( B.@@ E. ) per ml plasma by modi@@ fic@@ ated Be@@ thes@@ da As@@ say .
&quot; the risk of developing inhibit@@ ors is related to the extent of exposure to the factor VIII , whereby the risk inside the first 20 exposure days is the greatest and depends on genetic and other factors . &quot;
&quot; in pre @-@ treated patients ( PT@@ Ps ) with more than 100 exposure days and an@@ am@@ nes@@ tic known inhibit@@ or development , after switching from a re@@ combin@@ ant factor VIII product to another , the re @-@ occurrence of ( low @-@ tri@@ gen ) inhibit@@ ors was observed . &quot;
&quot; due to the rare occurrence of H@@ äm@@ op@@ hi@@ lia A in women , there are no experiences regarding the application of factor VIII during pregnancy and lac@@ tation . &quot;
&quot; the A@@ DR@@ s performed in the largest number of patients were inhibit@@ ors against factor VIII ( 5 patients ) , which all showed previously untreated patients who have a higher risk of formation of inhibit@@ ors , head@@ aches ( 5 patients ) , fever and di@@ zz@@ iness ( 3 patients each ) . &quot;
&quot; very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , common ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 to &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) , very rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 to &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) , very rare ( frequency based on available data is not estimated ) . &quot;
a ) The percentage of patients was calculated according to the sum of the individual patients ( 234 ) . b ) The unexpected drop of the blood co@@ ag@@ ulation factor VIII @-@ Spi@@ eg@@ els occurred post@@ oper@@ atively ( 10 - 14 post@@ operative day ) in a patient under continuous A@@ DV@@ ATE In@@ fusion .
the blood cl@@ ot@@ ting was maintained throughout the period and both the factor VI@@ II@@ - mirror in plasma as well as the clearance rate showed sufficient values on the 15 post@@ operative day .
&quot; in clinical trials with A@@ DV@@ ATE of 145 children and adults 2 with diagnosed he@@ avier to moderate hem@@ op@@ hi@@ lia A ( F@@ VIII ≤ 2 % ) and previous exposure to factor VI@@ II@@ - concentr@@ ates ( ≥ 150 days ) , only one patient showed a low inhibit@@ or ( 2,4 B.@@ E. in modified Be@@ thes@@ da approach ) . &quot;
&quot; in addition , none of the 53 pedi@@ atric patients with an age of less than 6 years and diagnosed he@@ avier to moderate hem@@ op@@ hi@@ lia A ( F@@ VIII ≤ 2 % ) was found under previous exposure to factor VI@@ II@@ - concentr@@ ates ( ≥ 50 days ) a F@@ VIII inhibit@@ or . &quot;
&quot; in previously untreated patients of an ongoing clinical study , 5 of 25 ( 20 % ) treated patients with A@@ DV@@ ATE were inhibit@@ ors against factor VIII . &quot;
&quot; the immune response of patients on traces of contaminated proteins was analysed by examining the antibodies against these proteins , laboratory parameters , and reported side @-@ effects . &quot;
&quot; a patient showed both a statisti@@ cally significant upward trend as well as a persistent peak of antibody levels against anti @-@ CH@@ O cell protein , but otherwise no signs or symptoms indicated on an allergic reaction or hyper@@ sensitivity . &quot;
&quot; four patients were reported about the occurrence of ur@@ tic@@ aria , pr@@ ur@@ itus , r@@ ash r@@ ash and increased number of e@@ os@@ in@@ op@@ hil@@ es gran@@ u@@ lo@@ cy@@ tes in several repeated product positions within the study . &quot;
&quot; 7 As with other intra@@ ven@@ ous products , A@@ DV@@ ATE reported about hyper@@ sensitivity reactions of the allergic type , including an@@ aphy@@ lac@@ tic / an@@ aphy@@ lac@@ to@@ i@@ der reactions ( frequency unknown ) . &quot;
the activated factor VIII acts as a co@@ factor for the activated factor IX and acceler@@ ates the formation of activated factor X of factor X .
all pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics studies with A@@ DV@@ ATE were performed on pre@@ treated patients with severe or moderate hem@@ op@@ hi@@ lia A ( basic value of the factor VIII @-@ activity ≤ 2 % ) .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic parameters stem from a cross @-@ over study with A@@ DV@@ ATE in 100 previously treated patients equal to or &gt; 10 years and are listed in table 3 below .

&quot; based on the data available since the release date , the CH@@ MP has continued to evaluate the benefits risk assessment , but considered that the safety profile must be closely monitored for the following reasons : &quot;
&quot; therefore , the CH@@ MP on the basis of the security profile of A@@ DV@@ ATE , which necess@@ it@@ ates a submission of PS@@ UR@@ s every 6 months , decided that the admission holder should apply for another extension in 5 years . &quot;
&quot; in December 2008 , Gen@@ du@@ x Molecular Limited dealt with the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) that the Company accepts his application for the approval of Adv@@ ex@@ in for the treatment of Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer . &quot;
&quot; normally , however , the chest , the brain , the bones or the soft tissues ( tissue that connects other structures within the body , surro@@ unds and supports ) are affected . &quot;
this is a type of virus that has been gene@@ tically modified that it can carry a gene into the cells of the body .
&quot; the virus in Adv@@ ex@@ in is a &quot; A@@ den@@ o@@ virus , &quot; which has been modified in such a way that it cannot produce copies of itself and therefore cannot trigger infections in humans . &quot;
Adv@@ ex@@ in could have been inj@@ ected directly into the tum@@ ors so that the cancer cells should enable the normal p@@ 53 protein again to form .
&quot; the p@@ 53 protein , which is formed by the p@@ 53 gene from which is not defective in the human body , normally contributes to the recovery of damaged DNA and to kill the cells if the DNA cannot be recovered . &quot;
&quot; at Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer , where the p@@ 53 gene is defective , the p@@ 53 protein does not work properly , and the cancer cells can continue to grow and share . &quot;
&quot; the company presented data from a study with a patient , at the Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer in the area of under@@ belly , in the bones and in the brain . &quot;
&quot; after the CH@@ MP checked the answers of the company to the questions asked , there were still some questions un@@ answered . &quot;
&quot; based on the examination of the initial submitted documents , the CH@@ MP created a list of questions sent to the company on Day 120 . &quot;
&quot; according to CH@@ MP , the inj@@ ections of Adv@@ ex@@ in in Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i tum@@ ours were beneficial for patients . &quot;
&quot; the committee also had concerns regarding the processing of the medicine in the body , the type of administration , as well as the safety of the medicine . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the company had not proven sufficiently that Adv@@ ec@@ in can be manufactured in a reliable way and that it is harmful neither for the environment nor for people who come in close contact with the patient . &quot;
&quot; the company did not notice the CH@@ MP whether the withdrawal consequences for patients who are currently participating in clinical trials or &quot; &quot; Comp@@ as@@ sion@@ ate Use &quot; &quot; programs with Adv@@ ex@@ in . &quot;
&quot; changed drug release &quot; means that the tablets are put together in such a way that one of the effective ingredients is immediately released and the other is released slowly over a few hours .
&quot; aer@@ ina@@ ze is used to treat the symptoms of seasonal allergic rhin@@ itis ( ha@@ y fever , caused by an allergy to pol@@ len caused inflammation of the nas@@ al path@@ ways ) in patients with nas@@ al swelling ( c@@ logged nose ) . &quot;
&quot; for adults and young people aged 12 , the recommended dose of aer@@ ina@@ ze is twice daily a tablet which is to be taken with a glass of water with or without food . &quot;
&quot; the duration of the treatment should be as short as possible and termin@@ ate as soon as the symptoms , especially the swelling of the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a ( blocked nose ) , are cl@@ apped . &quot;
treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended because the effects of the medicine can be found on the con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose .
the main efficacy measurements were the changes in the sever@@ ity of the ha@@ y fever symptoms reported by the patients before the treatment and during the 15 @-@ day treatment .
&quot; during the study , patients carried out their symptoms every 12 hours in a journal and assessed with a standard scale how difficult the symptoms were over the last 12 hours . &quot;
&quot; when considering all ha@@ y fever sy@@ mpt@@ omes , except for the con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose , patients who took Aer@@ ina@@ ze reported a decrease in symptoms of 46.@@ 0 % compared to 35.@@ 9 % in the patients receiving pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine alone . &quot;
&quot; when only the swelling of the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a was considered , the patients under aer@@ ina@@ ze showed a relief of the symptoms by 37.@@ 4 % versus 26.@@ 7 % in patients receiving Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin alone . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of aer@@ ina@@ ze ( observed with 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia ( heart ch@@ asing ) , mouth @-@ dr@@ y@@ ness , di@@ zz@@ iness , psych@@ omot@@ or hyper@@ activity ( rest@@ lessness ) , an@@ or@@ ex@@ ia ( lack of appetite ) , som@@ n@@ ol@@ ence ( sleep@@ iness ) , sleep disorders and nerv@@ ousness . &quot;
&quot; may not be applied to patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin , pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine or one of the other ingredients , against adren@@ ergi@@ c agents or Lor@@ at@@ adin ( another medicine for the treatment of allergi@@ es ) . &quot;
&quot; aer@@ ina@@ ze should also not be used in patients who suffer from a narrow glaucoma ( increased intra@@ ocular pressure ) , heart or v@@ ascular disease , hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ sis ( hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ sis ) , hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ sis ( hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ sis ) or have a risk of a hem@@ or@@ rh@@ ag@@ ic stroke . &quot;
&quot; on 30 July 2007 , the European Commission issued a permit for the European Union to transport Aer@@ ina@@ ze throughout the European Union . &quot;
&quot; the tablet can be taken with a glass of water , but it can be swal@@ lowed whole ( i.e. without dis@@ rup@@ ting or ch@@ ew@@ ing it ) . &quot;
&quot; due to lack of data for harm@@ lessness and efficacy , aer@@ ina@@ ze should not be used in children under 12 years of age . &quot;
the duration of the application is as short as possible and should not be continued after loos@@ ing the symptoms .
&quot; it is recommended to limit the duration of the application to 10 days , as long @-@ term use may decrease the activity of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine with time . &quot;
&quot; after the swelling of the mu@@ c@@ ous membran@@ es in the upper respiratory tract , treatment can be continued with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine as mon@@ otherapy . &quot;
&quot; as Aer@@ ina@@ ze pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine contains , the medicine is also contra@@ indicated in patients treated with mono@@ amine oxid@@ ase ( MA@@ O ) inhibit@@ ors , or within 2 weeks after finishing such treatment . &quot;
&quot; this is due to al@@ ph@@ am@@ im@@ etic activity in combined application of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine with other vas@@ o@@ con@@ stric@@ tors , such as bro@@ o@@ cri@@ pi@@ tin , per@@ go@@ lid , Lis@@ ur@@ id , lin@@ erg@@ oline , erg@@ y@@ dro@@ erg@@ ot@@ amine or other de@@ on@@ ges@@ tiva , phen@@ y@@ le@@ phr@@ ine , eph@@ edr@@ ine , phen@@ y@@ met@@ az@@ olin , nap@@ haz@@ olin , etc . ) . &quot;
the safety and efficacy of this combination therapy were not checked for this patient &apos;s body and the data do not suff@@ ice to pron@@ ounce appropriate dosage recommendations .
&quot; the safety and efficacy of aer@@ ina@@ ze were not checked in patients with kidney or liver dysfunction , and the data do not suff@@ ice to pron@@ ounce appropriate dosage recommendations . &quot;
&quot; patients need to be informed that treatment in case of a hyper@@ tension or a t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia or of pal@@ pit@@ ations , heart rhyth@@ ms , nau@@ sea or any other neurolog@@ ical symptoms ( such as head@@ aches or a rein@@ forcement of head@@ aches ) must be removed . &quot;
&quot; patients with hyper@@ tension • Patients with hyper@@ tension • Patients with hyper@@ tension • Patients with a m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction in an@@ am@@ nes@@ ia , diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , bladder neck stru@@ ktion or bron@@ ch@@ os@@ pas@@ mus in an@@ am@@ nes@@ is . &quot;
&quot; aer@@ ina@@ ze is at least 48 hours before performing der@@ mat@@ ological tests , since anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ini@@ ka can otherwise prevent positive reactions on indicators of skin reactions or reduce them to their extent . &quot;
&quot; as part of clinical trials with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin , where er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were additionally administered , no clin@@ ically relevant interactions or alter@@ ations of the plasma concentration of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin were observed . &quot;
&quot; the results of the psych@@ omot@@ oric tests showed no significant differences between the patients treated with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin and those treated with plac@@ ebo , regardless of whether Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin was alone or with alcohol . &quot;
&quot; the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin has not yet been identified , so that interactions with other drugs cannot be excluded completely . &quot;
&quot; Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin not inhi@@ bits in @-@ vi@@ vo C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 , and in vitro studies have shown that the drug C@@ YP@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 does not inhi@@ bit and neither a sub@@ strate nor an inhibit@@ or of the P @-@ gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ ein is . &quot;
&quot; the harm@@ lessness of the use of aer@@ ina@@ ze during pregnancy is not assured , experience from a large number of affected pregn@@ ancies showed no increase in the frequency of ab@@ norm@@ alities compared to the frequency of the normal population . &quot;
&quot; since reproductive studies on animals are not always applied to humans , and due to the vas@@ o@@ con@@ stri@@ ctive properties of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine , aer@@ ina@@ ze should not be applied during pregnancy . &quot;
&quot; however , patients should be informed that in very rare cases it can lead to an imp@@ airment of traffic or the ability to serve machines . &quot;
&quot; symptoms may vary between a CN@@ S depression ( sed@@ ation , ap@@ nea , decreased mental aler@@ tness , cy@@ an@@ sis , coma , cardiovascular collapse ) and a CN@@ S stimulation ( sle@@ e@@ pl@@ ess@@ ness , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations , tre@@ mor , conv@@ ul@@ sions ) with possible sequ@@ al processes . &quot;
&quot; head@@ aches , anxiety , difficult mi@@ stress , muscle weakness and increased muscle tension , eu@@ ph@@ oria , arous@@ al , respiratory in@@ suffici@@ ency , cardiac ar@@ rhyth@@ mi@@ as , nau@@ sea , tran@@ spir@@ ation , nau@@ sea , v@@ ascular , t@@ innitus , at@@ ax@@ ia , visual imp@@ airment and hyper@@ tension or hyp@@ ot@@ ony . &quot;
&quot; CN@@ S stimulation is particularly prob@@ able in children , as well as at@@ rop@@ ine typical symptoms ( mouth @-@ drying , pup@@ illary ar@@ re and - di@@ lation , skin drainage , hyper@@ ther@@ mia and g@@ astro@@ intestinal symptoms ) . &quot;
&quot; these include both the in@@ hibition of the release of pro @-@ inflammatory cy@@ tok@@ ines like IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human mast cells / bas@@ op@@ hil@@ es as well as the in@@ hibition of the expression of the adhes@@ ion molecule P @-@ Sel@@ ek@@ tin on end@@ othel@@ ial cells . &quot;
&quot; in case of an adult dose study with adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin 5 mg has no influence on standard measurement sizes of the alignment , including rein@@ forcement of subjective sleep@@ iness or the tasks associated with flying . &quot;
&quot; in controlled clinical studies , the recommended dosage of 5 m@@ g. daily was not determined by increased frequency of drow@@ sin@@ ess in comparison to plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; the oral application of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine in the recommended dosage can cause further li@@ ke@@ able effects , such as an increase in blood pressure , a t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia or manifestation of a CN@@ S arous@@ al . &quot;
&quot; there were 1,@@ 248 patients aged between 12 and 78 years with seasonal allergic rhin@@ itis , with 414 patients receiving Aer@@ ina@@ ze tablets . &quot;
&quot; in both studies , the hist@@ amine antagon@@ istic efficacy of aer@@ ina@@ ze tablets was significantly higher compared to symptoms ( except nas@@ al swelling ) , significantly higher than under a mon@@ otherapy with pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine over the 2 @-@ week treatment period . &quot;
&quot; the efficacy of aer@@ ina@@ ze tablets with regard to the swelling effect , determined by the nas@@ al swelling , was significantly higher than under a mon@@ otherapy with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin over the 2 @-@ week treatment period . &quot;
&quot; efficacy of aer@@ ina@@ ze tablets showed no significant differences in regard to gender , age or eth@@ ni@@ cal affili@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; as part of a single dose study for the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of aer@@ ina@@ ze , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin is det@@ ectable within 30 minutes after the treatment in plasma . &quot;
&quot; after the per@@ oral application of aer@@ ina@@ ze in healthy volunteers over 14 days , the flow balance of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin , 3 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin and pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine was reached in day 10 . &quot;
&quot; in the context of a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic multi @-@ dose study , which was performed with the formulation as a tablet of healthy adult subjects , it was found that four subjects Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin were badly metabol@@ ised . &quot;
a component interaction study shows that exposure ( C@@ MA@@ x and AU@@ C ) of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine after the sole offering of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine bio@@ equivalent was used to exposure to an aer@@ ina@@ ze tablet .
&quot; based on conventional studies on safety har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity with repeated administration , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and reproductive @-@ toxic@@ ity , the prec@@ lin@@ ical data with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin cannot detect any particular haz@@ ards for human beings . &quot;
&quot; the combination had no greater toxic@@ ity than its individual components , and the observed effects were generally related to the ingredient pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine . &quot;
in reproductive @-@ sto@@ x@@ ic@@ ological studies the combination of Lor@@ at@@ adin / Pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine was not ter@@ at@@ ogenic in rats in a dose of up to 150 mg / kg / day and in rab@@ bits in a dosage of up to 120 mg / kg / day .
&quot; in March 2007 and in module 1.@@ 8.1 of the authorisation application , pharmac@@ ovi@@ gil@@ ance system is established and works before and while the product is on the market . &quot;

&quot; if you forgot to take a dose in time , if you forgot to take a dose in time , take the application as soon as possible and apply the next dose at the scheduled time . &quot;
please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if any of the listed side effects will significantly affect you or you notice side effects that are not specified in this information .
&quot; heart ch@@ ase , rest@@ lessness with increased physical activity , mouth dr@@ y@@ ness , di@@ zz@@ iness , sore throat , loss of blood sugar , thirst , fatigue , head@@ ache , sleep disorders , nerv@@ ousness and ligh@@ the@@ ade@@ dness . &quot;

&quot; after the launch of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin , very rare cases were reported in cases of severe allergic reactions ( breathing not , whi@@ stling breathing , it@@ ching , n@@ ettle r@@ ash and swelling ) or r@@ ashes . &quot;
&quot; cases of pal@@ pit@@ ations , heart ch@@ ase , abdominal pain , nau@@ sea , v@@ om@@ iting , stomach pains , di@@ arr@@ he@@ a , drow@@ sin@@ ess , drow@@ sin@@ ess , drow@@ sin@@ ess , drow@@ sin@@ ess with increased physical activity , about cases of liver inflammation and about cases of con@@ spic@@ uous liver values was also reported very rarely . &quot;
&quot; it is available as a 5 mg tablet , 5 M@@ g@@ - Ly@@ op@@ hil@@ is@@ ate for intake ( soluble tablet ) , 2.5 mg / ml sy@@ rup and 0.5 mg / ml si@@ r@@ up and as 0.5 mg / ml solution . &quot;
&quot; for children aged one to five years , the dose is 1.@@ 25 mg once daily , which in the form of 2.5 ml sy@@ rup . &quot;
&quot; for children between six and eleven years , the dose is 2.5 mg once daily , either in the form of 5 ml sy@@ rup or . &quot;
A@@ eri@@ us has been studied in eight studies with about 4 800 adults and adolescents with allergic rhin@@ itis ( including four trials of seasonal allergic rhin@@ itis and two studies of patients who also had as@@ thma ) .
&quot; efficacy was measured by changing the symptoms ( it@@ ching , number and size , imp@@ airment of sleep and performance on the day ) before and after six weeks treatment . &quot;
&quot; further studies have been submitted to demonstrate that the body uses the sy@@ rup , the solution to intake and the enam@@ el tablets in the same way as the tablets and the application in children is harmless . &quot;
&quot; in case of allergic rhin@@ itis , when the results of all studies were taken together , the two @-@ week treatment with 5 mg A@@ eri@@ us resulted in an average decrease in symptom scores ( points of symptoms ) by 25 to 32 % , compared to the decrease of 12 to 26 % in patients receiving plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in the two studies in Ur@@ tic@@ aria , the decrease of the symptom was measured after six weeks of treatment with A@@ eri@@ us 58 and 67 % , compared to 40 and 33 % in patients treated with plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; A@@ eri@@ us may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin , Lor@@ at@@ adin , or any of the other ingredients . &quot;
&quot; in January 2001 , the European Commission issued a permit for the company SP Europe to launch A@@ eri@@ us in the entire European Union . &quot;
&quot; one tablet once daily , with one or without a meal , to alle@@ vi@@ ate the symptoms of allergic rhin@@ itis ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent allergic rhin@@ itis ) and ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
there is limited experience from clinical trials to efficacy in the application of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin in adolescents from 12 to 17 years ( see Sec@@ tions 4.8 and 5.1 ) .
the treatment of the inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rhin@@ itis ( occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days per week or less than 4 weeks ) should be carried out according to the previous disease progression and may be termin@@ ated after the symptoms of the symptoms and res@@ um@@ ed at their re@@ occurring .
&quot; in the per@@ si@@ sting allergic rhin@@ itis ( incidence of symptoms in 4 or more days per week and more than 4 weeks ) , patients may be recommended during the allergy period . &quot;
clin@@ ically relevant interactions were not found in clinical trials with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin tablets in which er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were additionally administered ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , the effective effect of alcohol was not increased while taking A@@ eri@@ us and alcohol ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
&quot; however , patients should be informed that in very rare cases it can lead to drow@@ sin@@ ess that can result in imp@@ airment of traffic or the ability to serve machines . &quot;
&quot; clinical trials in various indications , including allergic rhin@@ itis and chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , reported 3 % more side effects in patients with A@@ eri@@ us every day than in patients treated with plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; the most frequent side @-@ effects reported more frequently than in plac@@ ebo were fatigue ( 1,2 % ) , mouth @-@ dr@@ y@@ ness ( 0.8 % ) and head@@ ache ( 0,6 % ) . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical study with 57@@ 8 y@@ outh@@ ful patients from 12 to 17 years , the most common side effect was head@@ ache , this occurred at 5.@@ 9 % of the patients treated with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin and at 6.9 % of the patients treated with plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in a multi @-@ dose study , which was administered up to 45 mg of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin ( nine times clinical dose ) , no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed . &quot;
&quot; this includes both the in@@ hibition of the release of pro @-@ inflammatory cy@@ tok@@ ines like IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human mast cells / bas@@ op@@ hil@@ es as well as the in@@ hibition of the expression of the adhes@@ ion molecule P @-@ Sel@@ ek@@ tin on end@@ othel@@ ial cells . &quot;
&quot; as part of a clinical trial with multiple doses , administered in the des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin in a dose of up to 20 mg daily over 14 days , no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , in which des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin was administered in a dose of 45 mg a day ( the nine @-@ fold of the clinical dose ) was administered over ten days , there was no extension of the Q@@ t@@ c interval . &quot;
&quot; with an adult dose study with adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurement parameters of the alignment , including rein@@ forcement of subjective sleep@@ iness or the tasks associated with flying . &quot;
&quot; in patients with allergic rhin@@ itis , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in alle@@ vi@@ ating the symptoms such as sne@@ e@@ zing , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , lac@@ ri@@ mal drainage and red@@ ness of the eyes as well as it@@ ching on the pal@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the established classification in seasonal and per@@ ennial , allergic rhin@@ itis can be divided into inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rhin@@ itis and persistent allergic rhin@@ itis . &quot;
inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rhin@@ itis is defined as occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days per week or less than 4 weeks .
persistent allergic rhin@@ itis is defined as occurrence of symptoms at 4 or more days per week and more than 4 weeks .
&quot; as shown on the basis of the total quality of life for Rhin@@ o @-@ con@@ jun@@ c@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us effectively reduces the strain caused by seasonal allergic rhin@@ itis . &quot;
&quot; the chron@@ ically idi@@ opathic Ur@@ tic@@ aria was investigated for further forms of ur@@ tic@@ aria , since the underlying path@@ ophysi@@ ology is similar to the different forms and chronic patients can be easily pro@@ spec@@ tiv . &quot;
&quot; as the Hist@@ am@@ infection is a caus@@ ative factor in all ur@@ tical diseases , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin is also expected to improve the symptoms in other forms of the Ur@@ tic@@ aria , except in the case of chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria ; this is confirmed by the recommendations of clinical guidelines . &quot;
in two plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled studies over 6 weeks in patients with chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria A@@ eri@@ us was effective in improving Pr@@ ur@@ itus and the reduction of size and number of yo@@ d@@ les at the end of the first dose interval .
&quot; as in other studies with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ini@@ ka in chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , the minority of patients who did not react to anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ini@@ ka were excluded from the study . &quot;
an improvement of the itch by more than 50 % was observed at 55 % of patients treated with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin compared to 19 % of patients treated with plac@@ ebo .
&quot; the treatment with A@@ eri@@ us reduced the disorder of sleep and awareness , as measured by a 4 @-@ point scale to evaluate these variables . &quot;
&quot; in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics study , in which patients @-@ Dem@@ ographies were comparable to the general seasonal allergic rhin@@ itis -@@ population , a higher concentration of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin was achieved in 4 % of the patients . &quot;
there are no indications for clin@@ ically relevant cum@@ ulation after once daily application of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin ( 5- 20 mg ) over 14 days .
&quot; the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin , however , has not yet been identified so that interactions with other drugs are not completely excluded . &quot;
Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin inhi@@ bits in @-@ vi@@ vo not C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 and in @-@ vitro studies have shown that the medicine C@@ YP@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 does not inhi@@ bit and neither a sub@@ strate nor an inhibit@@ or of the P @-@ gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ ein is .
&quot; in a single dose study with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin in a dosage of 7.5 mg , meals ( fatty , low @-@ cal@@ orie breakfast ) did not affect the availability of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin . &quot;
&quot; the prec@@ lin@@ ical studies carried out with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin and Lor@@ at@@ adin showed a comparable degree of exposure to Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin , not qualitative or quantitative differences regarding the toxic@@ ity profile of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin and from Lor@@ at@@ adin . &quot;
&quot; based on conventional studies on safety har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity with repeated administration , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and re@@ produc@@ tion@@ sto@@ x@@ ic@@ ity , the prec@@ lin@@ ical data with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin cannot detect any particular haz@@ ards for human beings . &quot;
&quot; color Film ( contains l@@ act@@ ose @-@ mon@@ oh@@ ydr@@ ate , Hy@@ pro@@ m@@ ell@@ osis , titanium dioxide , Macro@@ go@@ l 400 , Indi@@ go@@ car@@ min ( E 132 ) ) , color@@ less film ( contains hy@@ pro@@ m@@ ell@@ ose , Macro@@ go@@ l 400 ) , car@@ nau@@ ba wax , ble@@ ached wax . &quot;
A@@ eri@@ us can be taken independently of meals to alle@@ vi@@ ate symptoms of allergic rhin@@ itis ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent allergic rhin@@ itis ) and ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) .
prescri@@ bing doctor should be aware that most cases of rhin@@ itis in children under 2 years are caused by infection ( see section 4.4 ) and that no data is available to support a treatment of an inf@@ ectious rhin@@ itis with A@@ eri@@ us .
&quot; in addition to exclusion of upper respiratory infections or anatom@@ ical an@@ om@@ ali@@ es , the an@@ am@@ nes@@ is , physical examinations and appropriate laboratory and skin examinations should play a role in the diagnosis . &quot;
about 6 % of adults and children between 2 and 11 years of age metabol@@ ise Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin and experience higher subsi@@ st@@ ence exposure ( see section 5.2 ) .
&quot; the safety of A@@ eri@@ us sy@@ rup in children between 2 and 11 years , which is fully met@@ ab@@ oli@@ zed , is identical to those in children that are normally met@@ ab@@ oli@@ zed . &quot;
&quot; this medicine contains su@@ c@@ rose and sor@@ bit@@ ol ; therefore , patients with her@@ edit@@ ary problems of fru@@ ct@@ ose intoler@@ ance , glucose @-@ gal@@ act@@ ose absorption or a sac@@ char@@ ase is@@ om@@ alt@@ as@@ e- in@@ suffici@@ ency of this medicine should not take . &quot;
clin@@ ically relevant interactions were not found in clinical trials with A@@ eri@@ us tablets in which er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were additionally administered ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , taking A@@ eri@@ us tablets and alcohol did not increase the performance of alcohol ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
the overall incidence of adverse events in children between 2 and 11 years was similar to the A@@ eri@@ us sy@@ rup group similar to the plac@@ ebo group .
&quot; clinical trials with adults and adolescents in different indications , including allergic rhin@@ itis and chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , were reported at the recommended dose 3 % more side effects in patients with A@@ eri@@ us than in patients treated with plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed in a multi @-@ dose study of adults and adolescents , in which up to 45 mg of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin ( nine times clinical dose ) were administered . &quot;
children aged between 1 and 11 years who were asked for anti@@ hist@@ amine were given a daily di@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine dose of 1.@@ 25 mg ( aged between 1 and 5 years ) or 2.5 mg ( aged between 6 and 11 years ) .
&quot; because the course of allergic rhin@@ itis / chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria and the profile of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin in adults and children are similar , the efficacy data of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin in adults can be extra@@ pol@@ ated to the children &apos;s population . &quot;
&quot; as part of a clinical trial with multiple doses of adults and adolescents , in the des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin in a dosage of up to 20 m@@ g. a day was applied daily over 14 days , no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study in adults and adolescents , in the des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin in a dose of 45 m@@ g. a day ( the nine @-@ fold of the clinical dose ) was applied more than ten days in adults , there was no extension of the Q@@ t@@ c interval . &quot;
&quot; in controlled clinical studies , the recommended dosage of 5 m@@ g. daily for adults and adolescents was not determined by increased frequency of drow@@ sin@@ ess in comparison to plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in case of a single daily dose of 7.5 mg , A@@ eri@@ us tablets in adults and adolescents in clinical studies did not affect psych@@ omot@@ or . &quot;
&quot; in clinical pharmac@@ ological studies in adults , alcohol @-@ induced performance imp@@ airment was neither increased nor increased by drow@@ sin@@ ess . &quot;
&quot; in adult and adol@@ escent patients with allergic rhin@@ itis , A@@ eri@@ us tablets were effective in alle@@ vi@@ ating symptoms such as sne@@ e@@ zing , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , lac@@ ri@@ mal drainage and red@@ ness of the eyes as well as it@@ ching on the pal@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; as shown on the basis of the total quality of life for Rhin@@ o @-@ con@@ jun@@ c@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us tablets effectively reduce the caused by seasonal allergic rhin@@ itis . &quot;
in two plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled studies over 6 weeks in patients with chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria A@@ eri@@ us was effective in improving Pr@@ ur@@ itus and the reduction of size and number of yo@@ d@@ les at the end of the first dose interval .
&quot; the prolifer@@ ation of this limited metabolic phen@@ otype was comparable to adults ( 6 % ) and children between 2 and 11 years ( 6 % ) and in both populations larger at black ( 18 % adults , 16 % children ) than in Cau@@ c@@ asi@@ ans ( 2 % adults , 3 % children ) . &quot;
similar pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic parameters were observed in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic multi @-@ dose study with sy@@ rup form@@ ulations to children between 2 and 11 years with allergic rhin@@ itis which are limited to metabol@@ ise .
the load ( AU@@ C ) by Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin was about 6 times higher after 3 to 6 hours and the C@@ MA@@ x was about 3 to 4@@ times higher with a terminal half time of about 120 hours .
there are no indications for clin@@ ically relevant active ingredient cum@@ ulation after once daily application of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin ( 5- 20 mg ) over 14 days in adults and adolescents .
&quot; 12 In several single dose studies , AU@@ C@@ - and C@@ MA@@ x values of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin were comparable with the recommended doses with those of adults who received the des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin sy@@ rup in a dose of 5 mg . &quot;
&quot; the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin , however , has not yet been identified so that interactions with other drugs cannot be excluded completely . &quot;
&quot; A@@ eri@@ us sy@@ rup is offered in type III brown bottles with chil@@ d@@ proof poly@@ propylene sealing cap with 30 , 50 , 60 , 100 , 120 , 150 , 225 and 300 ml . &quot;
&quot; equipped with a rigid , transparent poly@@ styrene measuring spo@@ on , calibr@@ ated with 2.5 ml and 5 ml or with an application sy@@ ringe for preparations for recording with sc@@ aling from 2.5 ml and 5 ml ( only for the 150 ml bottle ) . &quot;

&quot; immediately prior to application , the bli@@ ster must be opened carefully and the dose of the Ly@@ op@@ hil@@ is@@ ats can be taken from the intake without dam@@ aging it . &quot;
clin@@ ically relevant interactions were not found in clinical trials with A@@ eri@@ us tablets in which er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were additionally used ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; clinical trials in various indications , including allergic rhin@@ itis and chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , reported 3 % more side effects in patients with A@@ eri@@ us tablets a day than in patients treated with plac@@ ebo . &quot;
no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed in a multi @-@ dose study where up to 45 mg of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin ( nine times clinical dose ) were observed .
&quot; A@@ eri@@ us Ly@@ op@@ hil@@ is@@ at was well toler@@ ated in two single dose trials ; this was documented by clinical laboratory results , medical examinations , vital signs and EC@@ G interval data . &quot;
&quot; as part of a clinical trial with multiple doses , in which des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin was applied in a dose of up to 20 mg daily over 14 days , no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , in the des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin in a dose of 45 mg daily ( the nine @-@ fold of the clinical dose ) was applied more than ten days , there was no extension of the Q@@ t@@ c interval . &quot;
&quot; in controlled clinical studies , the recommended dosage of 5 m@@ g. daily was not determined by increased frequency of drow@@ sin@@ ess in comparison to plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; with a 17 single dose study with adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin 5 mg has no influence on standard measurement parameters of the alignment , including rein@@ forcement of subjective drow@@ sin@@ ess or the tasks associated with flying . &quot;
&quot; in patients with allergic rhin@@ itis , A@@ eri@@ us tablets were effective in alle@@ vi@@ ating symptoms such as sne@@ e@@ zing , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , lac@@ ri@@ mal drainage and red@@ ness of the eyes as well as it@@ ching on the pal@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; as shown on the basis of the total quality of life for Rhin@@ o @-@ con@@ jun@@ c@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us effectively reduces the strain caused by seasonal allergic rhin@@ itis . &quot;
&quot; 18 In a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics study , in which patients @-@ Dem@@ ographies were comparable to the general seasonal allergic rhin@@ itis -@@ population , a higher concentration of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin was achieved in 4 % of the patients . &quot;

there is limited experience from clinical trials to efficacy in the application of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin in adolescents from 12 to 17 years ( see Sec@@ tions 4.8 and 5.1 )
&quot; immediately before application , the bli@@ ster must be opened carefully and the dose of the enam@@ el tablet is taken from without dam@@ aging it . &quot;
efficacy and harm@@ lessness of A@@ eri@@ us 2.5 mg processed tablets have not been proven in the treatment of children under 6 years of age .
the overall frequency of the side effects between the Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine Sir@@ up@@ - and the plac@@ ebo group was equal and did not differ significantly from the safety profile specified in adult patients .
&quot; at the recommended dose , A@@ eri@@ us Mel@@ zer P@@ ills proved to be a bio@@ equivalent to the A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg conventional tablets formulation and the A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg Ly@@ op@@ hil@@ is@@ ate for the formulation of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin . &quot;
&quot; in the context of a clinical trial with multiple doses , in the des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin in a dosage of up to 20 m@@ g. a day was applied daily over 14 days , no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically &quot;
&quot; in case of an adult dose study with adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin 5 mg has no influence on standard measurement parameters of the alignment , including rein@@ forcement of subjective sleep@@ iness or the tasks associated with flying . &quot;
&quot; the spread of this badly met@@ ab@@ oli@@ zing phen@@ otype was comparable to adult ( 6 % ) and pedi@@ atric patients between 2 and 11 years ( 6 % ) , and under bl@@ acks ( adults 18 % , children 16 % ) larger than in Cau@@ c@@ asi@@ ans ( adults 2 % , children 3 % ) , however , the safety profile of these patients was not different from that of the general population . &quot;
&quot; in single dose @-@ crossover studies by A@@ eri@@ us Mel@@ zer tablet with A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg conventional tablets or A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg Ly@@ op@@ hil@@ is@@ at , the form@@ ulations were bio@@ equivalent . &quot;
&quot; A@@ eri@@ us 2,5 mg tablets have not been studied in pedi@@ atric patients , but in combination with dose @-@ resistant studies in children , however , pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data for A@@ eri@@ us Mel@@ zer tablets support the use of the 2.5 mg dosage in children from 6 to 11 years . &quot;

&quot; in patients with allergic rhin@@ itis , A@@ eri@@ us tablets were effective in alle@@ vi@@ ating symptoms such as sne@@ e@@ zing , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , lac@@ ri@@ mal drainage and red@@ ness of the eyes as well as it@@ ching on the pal@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; in single dose @-@ crossover studies of A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg Mel@@ zer tablet with A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg conventional tablets or A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg Ly@@ op@@ hil@@ is@@ at , the form@@ ulations were bio@@ equivalent . &quot;
the overall analysis of prec@@ lin@@ ical and clinical Ir@@ rit@@ ation tests for the enam@@ el tablet revealed that this formulation represents an unlikely risk for local irrit@@ ation in clinical use .
&quot; the safety of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin in children between 2 and 11 years , which is fully met@@ ab@@ oli@@ zed , is identical to those in children that are normally met@@ ab@@ oli@@ zed . &quot;
&quot; this medicine contains sor@@ bit@@ ol ; therefore , patients with her@@ edit@@ ary problems of a fru@@ ct@@ ose intoler@@ ance , glucose @-@ gal@@ act@@ ose absorption or a sac@@ char@@ ase is@@ om@@ alt@@ ase in@@ suffici@@ ency should not take this medicine . &quot;
the overall incidence of adverse events in children between 2 and 11 years was similar to the plac@@ ebo group in the des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin group .
&quot; small children between 6 and 23 months were the most frequent side effects reported more frequently than in plac@@ ebo , di@@ arr@@ ho@@ e ( 3.7 % ) , fever ( 2.3 % ) and sle@@ e@@ pl@@ ess@@ ness ( 2,3 % ) . &quot;
an additional study was observed at a single dose of 2.5 mg des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin solution for taking no side effects in patients aged between 6 and 11 years .
&quot; at the recommended doses , the plasma concentrations of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin ( see section 5.2 ) were comparable in the children &apos;s and adult population . &quot;
&quot; in controlled clinical studies , the recommended dosage of 5 m@@ g. daily for adults and adolescents was not determined by increased frequency of drow@@ sin@@ ess in comparison to plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the established classification in seasonal and per@@ ennial , allergic rhin@@ itis can be dependent on the duration of the symptoms alternatively also in inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rhin@@ itis and &quot;
&quot; as shown on the basis of the total quality of life for Rhin@@ o @-@ con@@ jun@@ c@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us tablets effectively reduce the strain caused by seasonal allergic rhin@@ itis . &quot;
&quot; the prolifer@@ ation of this limited metabolic phen@@ otype was comparable to adults ( 6 % ) and children between 2 and 11 years ( 6 % ) and in both populations larger at black ( 18 % adults , 16 % children ) than in Cau@@ c@@ asi@@ ans ( 2 % adults , 3 % children ) . &quot;
&quot; as A@@ eri@@ us solution to intake the same concentration on des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin , no bio @-@ equi@@ valence study was required and it is expected that it meets the sy@@ rup and the tablets . &quot;
&quot; in several single dose studies , AU@@ C@@ - and C@@ MA@@ x values of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin were comparable to the recommended doses with those of adults who received the des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin sy@@ rup in a dose of 5 mg . &quot;

&quot; in June 2008 , Nov@@ arti@@ s V@@ acc@@ ines and Diagnostics S.@@ r.@@ l. officially announced the approval of the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) to prevent the up@@ take of the avi@@ ary H@@ 5@@ N@@ 1 influ@@ enza in adults and elderly people . &quot;
A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov should be applied in adults and elderly people to protect against flu caused by the strain ( type ) H@@ 5@@ N@@ 1 of the influ@@ enza A virus .
this is a special type of vacc@@ ine that should protect against a trunk of the flu virus that might cause a future pan@@ de@@ mic .
&quot; flu pan@@ de@@ mic breaks out when a new stem of the flu virus appears , which can easily spread from man to man because humans have no immun@@ ity ( no protection ) . &quot;
&quot; after administration of the vacc@@ ine , the immune system recognis@@ es the parts of the flu virus contained in the vacc@@ ine and forms antibodies against it . &quot;
&quot; as a result , the immune system will later be able to form antibodies against this stem with a flu virus in contact with a flu virus . &quot;
&quot; afterwards , the virus was dis@@ connected with the &quot; surface anti@@ gens &quot; ( proteins on the membrane surface that the human body recognizes as a foreign body ) , puri@@ fied and used as a component of the vacc@@ ine . &quot;
inspection of some of the study sites showed that the study was not conducted in accordance with the &quot; good clinical practice &quot; ( G@@ CP ) .
&quot; as a result , the scope of the clinical data base for evaluating the safety of the vacc@@ ine was not sufficient to meet the requirements of the E@@ MEA guidelines for pre@@ pan@@ de@@ mic vacc@@ ines . &quot;
&quot; should you take part in a clinical trial and need more information about your treatment , please contact your doctor . &quot;
&quot; if you would like more information on the basis of CH@@ MP recommendations , please read the scientific discussion ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) . &quot;
&quot; it is used in combination with other anti @-@ viral medicines to treat adults and children over four years , which are infected with the human immun@@ o@@ deficiency virus type 1 ( HIV @-@ 1 ) , which causes the acquired immun@@ o@@ deficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) . &quot;
&quot; for patients who cannot swal@@ low the capsules , A@@ gener@@ a is available as a solution , but this cannot be taken together with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r as the safety of this combination has not been studied . &quot;
&quot; generic A@@ gener@@ ase should only be prescribed if the doctor has examined which anti@@ viral medicines the patient has previously taken , and the lik@@ el@@ ihood of ass@@ essing the virus will respond to the drug . &quot;
&quot; the recommended dose for patients over 12 years is 600 mg twice daily , which together with twice daily 100 mg k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and with other anti @-@ viral medicines are taken . &quot;
&quot; in children between four and twelve years and in patients with a body weight of less than 50 kg , the recommended dose of as@@ gener@@ a depends on the body weight . &quot;
&quot; in combination with other anti @-@ viral drugs , A@@ gener@@ a decreases the HIV quantity in the blood and keeps them at a low level . &quot;
&quot; AIDS is not cure , however , the immune system &apos;s damage can also delay the development of infections and diseases associated with AIDS . &quot;
&quot; A@@ gener@@ a was studied in combination with other anti @-@ viral drugs , but without k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , in two main studies involving 7@@ 36 HIV @-@ infected adults who had previously not been treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; this drug , with low dos@@ ed k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , was compared to 206 adults who had previously taken prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , compared with other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors . &quot;
the main indicator of the efficacy was the proportion of patients with non @-@ det@@ ectable concentrations of HIV in the blood ( viral load ) or the change in the viral load after treatment .
&quot; in the studies with patients who had previously not taken prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , more patients had a viral load below 400 copies / ml than under plac@@ ebo , but A@@ gener@@ ase was less effective than in@@ din@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; in children , A@@ gener@@ ase also reduced the viral load , but with the children previously treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , only very few were addressed to the treatment . &quot;
&quot; in the study with adults , previously treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , the drug A@@ gener@@ ase increased the viral load after 16 @-@ week treatment as effective as other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors : &quot;
&quot; the patients with HIV , which were resistant to four other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , came under A@@ gener@@ a together with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r for a stronger waste of the viral load after four weeks than with the patients who continued their previous prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors : &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of A@@ gener@@ ase ( observed with more than 1 of 10 patients ) are head@@ aches , di@@ arr@@ ho@@ ea ( di@@ arr@@ he@@ a ) , flat@@ ul@@ ence ( flat@@ ul@@ ence ) , nau@@ sea ( nau@@ sea ) , v@@ om@@ iting , r@@ ash and F@@ atigue ( fatigue ) . &quot;
2 / 3 A@@ gener@@ ase may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r or any of the other ingredients .
&quot; A@@ gener@@ a may also not be used in patients , the Johannis@@ k@@ raut ( a herbal supplement to treat depression ) or medicines that are also degra@@ ded as well as as@@ gener@@ a and are harmful to health in high concentrations in the blood . &quot;
&quot; as with other medicines against HIV , there is a risk of li@@ po@@ dy@@ stro@@ phy ( changes in the distribution of body fat ) , oste@@ o@@ arthritis ( death of bone tissue ) or an immun@@ o activation syn@@ dro@@ mes ( symptoms of infection caused by the recovered immune system ) . &quot;
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of A@@ gener@@ a in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs used to treat prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors to treat HIV @-@ 1 infected adults and children over four years over the risks .
&quot; generic A@@ gener@@ a is usually taken together with the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic amplifier Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , but the committee stated that the benefit of A@@ gener@@ a in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients who had previously not taken prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; A@@ gener@@ ase was originally admitted under &quot; exceptional circumstances , &quot; since only limited information was given at the time of approval for scientific reasons . &quot;
&quot; in October 2000 , the European Commission issued a permit to the company Gla@@ x@@ o Group Limited for issu@@ ing A@@ gener@@ ase in the entire European Union . &quot;
&quot; A@@ gener@@ a is indicated in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines to treat HIV @-@ 1 infected , prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors ( PI ) and children from 4 years onwards . &quot;
&quot; usually , A@@ gener@@ ase capsules are to be administered for pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic boo@@ ster@@ ung by Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r along with low doses of k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 4.5 ) . &quot;
the use of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r should take place taking into account the individual viral resistance pattern and pre @-@ treatment of the patient ( see section 5.1 ) .
the bio@@ availability of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r as a solution to intake is 14 % lower than by Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r as capsule ; therefore A@@ gener@@ ase capsules and solution are not replac@@ eable on a milli@@ gram per milli@@ gram basis ( see section 5.2 ) .
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase capsules is 600 mg Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r twice daily together with 100 mg k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
&quot; 2 If A@@ gener@@ ase capsules are applied without the intensi@@ fying addition of k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( boo@@ ster@@ ung ) , higher doses of A@@ gener@@ ase ( 1200 mg twice daily ) must be applied . &quot;
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase capsules amounts to 20 mg Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs up to a daily dose of 2400 mg Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r which should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics , efficacy and safety of ag@@ glomer@@ ate in combination with low doses of k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors were not examined in children . &quot;
&quot; A@@ gener@@ ase is not recommended for use in children under 4 years , due to lack of data for harm@@ lessness and efficacy ( see section 5.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; based on pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data , the dose of A@@ gener@@ ase capsules in adult patients with moderate liver dysfunction should be reduced to 450 mg twice daily and in patients with severe liver dysfunction at 300 mg twice daily . &quot;
&quot; simultaneous application should be carried out with caution in patients with mild or moderate liver dysfunction , in patients with severe liver function disorder it is contra@@ indicated ( see section 4.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; A@@ gener@@ ase may not be given at the same time with medicines that have a low therapeutic width , and also represent sub@@ str@@ ates of the Cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 @-@ I@@ so@@ enzy@@ m 3@@ A4 ( C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 ) . &quot;
&quot; herbal preparations , which contain Johannis@@ k@@ raut ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) , may not be used due to the risk of reduced plasma concentrations and a dimin@@ ished therapeutic effect of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r while taking Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
patients should be advised that A@@ gener@@ a or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy does not lead to a cure of HIV infection and that they can continue to develop opportun@@ istic infections or other complications of HIV infection .
the current anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including treatment with as@@ gener@@ a does not prevent the risk of transmission of HIV to other through sexual contact or contamination with blood .
&quot; usually , A@@ gener@@ ase capsules should be used together with low doses of k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot;
patients suffering from chronic hepatitis B or C and treated with anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy have increased risk of severe liver failure .
for the case of simultaneous anti@@ viral treatment of hepatitis B or C please read the relevant specialist information of this medicine .
&quot; patients with pre @-@ existing liver function , including chronic hepatitis , show an increased incidence of liver dysfunction under anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy and should be monitored according to clinical practice . &quot;
&quot; simultaneous use of A@@ gener@@ ase and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r with Flu@@ tic@@ as@@ one or other glu@@ co@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , which are metabol@@ ised by C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 , is not recommended unless the possible benefit of a treatment predomin@@ ates the risk of system@@ ic cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid effects including Cus@@ hing and Supp@@ ression of the adren@@ al function ( see Section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; since the metabolism of H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ A @-@ reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin is strongly dependent on C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 , simultaneous administration of as@@ gener@@ a with Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin is not recommended due to the increased risk of my@@ opath@@ ies including R@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ oly@@ sis . &quot;
&quot; for some medicines that can cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects such as car@@ b@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cy@@ c@@ lic anti@@ de@@ press@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under supervision of the International Norm@@ alised R@@ atio ) , methods are available for determining the drug concentration . &quot;
patients who take this medicine at the same time can be less effective because of reduced plasma cutting of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( see section 4.5 ) .
&quot; due to the possibility of metabolic interactions with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , the effectiveness of hormon@@ al contra@@ cep@@ tives may be altered , but the information is not sufficient to estimate the type of interactions . &quot;
&quot; when meth@@ ad@@ on is given concur@@ r@@ ently with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , patients should therefore be monitored for breath @-@ taking sy@@ mpt@@ omes , especially if low doses of k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r are administered . &quot;
&quot; due to the possible risk of a toxic@@ ity due to the high Prop@@ ylene gly@@ col in the A@@ gener@@ ase solution , this dosage form is contra@@ indicated in children under a age of four years and should be applied with caution in certain other patient groups . &quot;
A@@ gener@@ ase should be canc@@ eled in duration 5 if a r@@ ash of system@@ ic or allergic symptoms is accompanied or the mu@@ c@@ ous membran@@ es are involved ( see section 4.8 ) .
&quot; patients receiving anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy , including prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , was reported about the occurrence of diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia , or an exac@@ erb@@ ation of an existing diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus . &quot;
many of the patients had other diseases that were needed for treatment medications to be associated with the development of diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia .
&quot; B . higher ages , and with drug @-@ dependent factors , such as a longer lasting anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and related metabolic disorders . &quot;
&quot; hem@@ op@@ hil@@ es patients ( type A and B ) treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , reports of an increase of bleeding including spontaneous cut@@ aneous hem@@ at@@ omas and ha@@ zel@@ nuts . &quot;
&quot; in the event of an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) , HIV @-@ infected patients with severe immune defect can develop an inflammatory response to asy@@ mpt@@ om@@ atic or residual opportun@@ istic infections which lead to severe clinical conditions or deteri@@ oration of symptoms . &quot;
&quot; although a multi@@ fac@@ torial eti@@ ology is adopted ( including applying cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , alcohol consumption , severe immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression , higher body mass index ) , cases of oste@@ o@@ arthritis in particular were reported in patients with advanced HIV disease and / or long @-@ term application of anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) . &quot;
C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 sub@@ str@@ ates with low therapeutic latitude are not allowed at the same time with medicines that have a low therapeutic width and also represent sub@@ str@@ ates of the Cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 @-@ I@@ so@@ enzy@@ m 3@@ A4 ( C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 ) .
&quot; C@@ YP@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 sub@@ str@@ ates with low therapeutic width A@@ gener@@ ase with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r may not be given together with medicines , whose active ingredients are mainly metabol@@ ised through C@@ YP@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and are associated with severe and / or life @-@ threatening side effects . &quot;
&quot; it has been shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes a 82 % reduction in the AU@@ C of Am@@ pri@@ avi@@ r , which can lead to a vi@@ rolog@@ ical failure and a resistance development . &quot;
&quot; in attempting to compens@@ ate the reduced plasma levels by a dose of other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , undes@@ irable effects on the liver have been observed . &quot;
Johannis@@ k@@ raut ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) The ser@@ um levels of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r can be humili@@ ated by the simultaneous use of plant preparations with St. John &apos;s wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) .
&quot; if a patient already adop@@ ts St. John &apos;s wort , the am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r@@ mirror and , if possible , to check the viral load and abol@@ ish the St. John &apos;s wort . &quot;
dosage adjustment for one of the medicines is not required when nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r is administered together with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( see also E@@ f@@ avi@@ ren@@ z below ) .
&quot; 508 % increase , on the other hand , reduced by 30 % when Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 m@@ g. twice daily ) is administered in combination with Am@@ pri@@ avi@@ r capsule ( 600 mg twice daily ) . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials , doses of 600 mg Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r were used twice daily and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice daily , which prove the efficacy and harm@@ lessness of this treatment regim@@ en . &quot;
52 % reduced when Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 750 mg twice daily ) is administered in combination with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) .
&quot; the C@@ min values of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in plasma that were reached twice daily with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) , are approximately 40 to 50 % lower than when Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) is administered twice daily in combination with 100 mg ritual avi@@ r twice daily . &quot;
&quot; dosage recommendation for simultaneous administration of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Kal@@ et@@ ra cannot be given , but it is recommended to closely monitor the effectiveness and harm@@ lessness of this combination . &quot;
&quot; no pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study was carried out in combination with di@@ dan@@ o in combination with di@@ dan@@ os@@ ine , but due to the statistical component of Di@@ dan@@ os@@ in it is recommended that the revenues of Di@@ dan@@ os@@ in and A@@ gener@@ a lie at least one hour ( see An@@ ta@@ zi@@ da below ) . &quot;
therefore in combination with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 m@@ g. twice daily ) no dose adjustment is required .
treatment with E@@ f@@ avi@@ ren@@ z in combination with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r is not recommended as the exposure of both prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors would be low .
Ne@@ vi@@ ra@@ pin &apos;s effects on other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors and existing limited data suggest that Ne@@ vi@@ ra@@ pin may sink the ser@@ um concentration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
&quot; if these drugs should be used at the same time , caution is advised as Del@@ avi@@ r@@ din could be less effective because of the reduced or possibly sub@@ therapeutic plasma . &quot;
&quot; if these drugs are used together , caution is advised ; a thorough clinical and vi@@ rolog@@ ical monitoring should be carried out since a precise pre@@ diction of the effect of the combination of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r to Del@@ avi@@ r@@ din is difficult . &quot;
the simultaneous offering of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin led to an increase in plasma concentration ( AU@@ C ) of ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin by 193 % and thus to an increase in the side effects associated with ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin .
&quot; if it is necessary for clinical reasons , to admini@@ ster ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin along with as@@ gener@@ a , a reduction of the dosage of ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin to at least half of the recommended dose is recommended although no clinical data is available . &quot;
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic studies with gen@@ ase in combination with er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin were not carried out but could increase the plasma cutting of both drugs in the case of simultaneous administration .
simultaneous application of twice daily 700 mg Fos@@ am@@ ren@@ avi@@ r and 100 mg k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole daily led to an increase in the C@@ MA@@ x of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole in plasma by 25 % and AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ τ ) once daily without simultaneous use of Fos@@ am@@ ren@@ avi@@ r with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
&quot; other medicines that are listed below , including sub@@ str@@ ates , inhibit@@ ors or induc@@ tors of C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 can , if used together with as@@ gener@@ a , may lead to interactions . &quot;
patients should therefore be monitored on toxic reactions associated with these drugs if they are used in combination with as@@ gener@@ a .
&quot; based on the data of other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , it is advisable that An@@ ta@@ zi@@ da cannot be taken at the same time as as@@ gener@@ a as it can come to res@@ or@@ ption disorders . &quot;
&quot; simultaneous application of anti@@ conv@@ ul@@ s@@ ants known as enzymes ( phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , car@@ b@@ amaz@@ ep@@ in ) , with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r can lead to a degra@@ dation of the plasma cutting of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; ser@@ um concentrations of calcium channel block@@ ers like am@@ lo@@ di@@ pine , dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em , Fel@@ odi@@ pin , Isra@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine
&quot; the simultaneous intake with A@@ gener@@ ase can significantly increase the plasma concentrations and intensi@@ fy with P@@ DE@@ 5 inhibit@@ ors related side effects including hyp@@ ot@@ en@@ sion , visual imp@@ airment and pri@@ ap@@ ism ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical study in which Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg capsules were given twice daily with 50 µ@@ g Flu@@ tic@@ as@@ on@@ pro@@ pion@@ ate in@@ tran@@ as@@ al ( 4 times daily ) over 7 days of subjects , the endo@@ genous cor@@ ti@@ sol decreased by about 86 % ( 90 % -@@ mean frequency 82 to 89 % ) . &quot;
&quot; as a result , the simultaneous offering of A@@ gener@@ ase with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r together with these glu@@ co@@ cor@@ ro@@ ids is not recommended unless the possible benefit of a treatment out@@ weighs the risk of system@@ ic cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid effects ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; with H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ A @-@ reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors such as Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin , whose metabol@@ isation is strongly dependent on C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 , there are distinct enh@@ ancements of the plasma cutting with simultaneous administration of as@@ gener@@ a . &quot;
&quot; as plasma levels of these H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors can lead to my@@ opathy , including a rh@@ ub@@ dom@@ y@@ oly@@ sis , the combined application of these drugs is not recommended with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; a more frequent monitoring of therapeutic concentrations until stabil@@ isation of the mirrors is recommended , as the plasma concentrations of Cy@@ clos@@ por@@ in , Rap@@ am@@ y@@ cin and Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can be increased by Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r at the same time ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; therefore , A@@ gener@@ ase should not be used in conjunction with or@@ ally recorded mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am ( see section 4.3 ) , while with simultaneous use of as@@ gener@@ a with par@@ enter@@ al Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am caution is advisable . &quot;
data for simultaneous use of par@@ enter@@ al Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am with other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors indicate a possible rise in plasma cutting from Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am around 3 to 4 @-@ fold .
&quot; when meth@@ ad@@ on is administered together with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , patients should therefore be monitored for breath @-@ taking sy@@ mpt@@ omes , especially if low doses of k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r are administered . &quot;
&quot; because of the low perme@@ ability of historical compar@@ isons , no recommendation can be given at the moment , as Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is administered simultaneously with meth@@ ad@@ one . &quot;
&quot; in the case of simultaneous offering of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants along with as@@ gener@@ a , increased control of the IN@@ R ( International Norm@@ alised R@@ atio ) is recommended due to the possibility of weak@@ ening or strengthening the anti@@ th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic effect ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; the effect of an additional dose of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r to hormon@@ al contra@@ cep@@ tives is not predic@@ table , so alternative methods are recommended for contra@@ ception . &quot;
careful monitoring of the therapeutic effects and side effects of tri@@ cy@@ c@@ lic anti@@ de@@ press@@ ants ( for example Des@@ i@@ pr@@ amine and Nor@@ tr@@ yp@@ ti@@ lin ) is recommended while offering A@@ gener@@ a ( see section 4.4 ) .
&quot; during pregnancy , this medicine may be applied only after careful weighing of possible benefits for the mother compared to possible risks for the fet@@ us . &quot;
&quot; in the milk of l@@ act@@ ating rats , am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r @-@ related substances have been detected , but it is not known whether Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r enters the mother &apos;s milk . &quot;
&quot; a reproductive study of pregnant rats , which was administered by the penetration into the uter@@ us until the end of the breast@@ feeding time , showed a dimin@@ ished increase in the 12 body@@ weight in the seed . &quot;
&quot; the further development of the seed , including fertility and reproductive capacity , was not affected by the administration of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r to the mother animal . &quot;
the harm@@ lessness of A@@ gener@@ a was studied in adults and children from 4 years in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
&quot; most of the side effects associated with the A@@ gener@@ ase treatment were mild to moderate , observed early and rarely led to the treatment of treatment . &quot;
&quot; in many of these events , it is not clear whether they are related to the intake of A@@ gener@@ a or another medicines applied to HIV , or whether they are a result of the underlying disease . &quot;
&quot; most of the side effects mentioned below are from two clinical trials ( PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 1 , PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 6 ) , in which patients with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors have not been treated twice daily with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; events ( grade 2 to 4 ) , which were evaluated by the investig@@ ators as related to the study medi@@ ation and performed at more than 1 % of the patients , as well as under the treatment of occurring laboratory changes ( grade 3 to 4 ) are listed . &quot;
&quot; anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy was associated with re@@ distribution of body fat ( li@@ po@@ dy@@ stro@@ phy ) in HIV patients , including a loss of periph@@ eral and differential sub@@ cut@@ aneous fatty tissue , increased intra@@ abdominal and vis@@ cer@@ al fat tissue , hyper@@ tro@@ phy of breasts and dor@@ so@@ zer@@ vi@@ cal fat accumulation . &quot;
&quot; under 113 anti@@ retro@@ viral not previously treated persons treated with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in combination with lam@@ iv@@ ud@@ ine / zi@@ do@@ v@@ u@@ din about an average length of 36 weeks , only one case ( sti@@ ckers ) was observed ( &lt; 1 % ) . &quot;
&quot; in the study PRO@@ AB 300@@ 6 performed in 245 N@@ R@@ TI@@ - pre@@ treated patients with Am@@ pri@@ avi@@ r 7 cases ( 3 % ) in 241 patients with in@@ din@@ avi@@ r , in combination with different N@@ R@@ TI@@ s over a medium duration of 56 weeks ( p &lt; 0.0@@ 01 ) . &quot;
&quot; r@@ ashes were usually mild to moderate , er@@ y@@ them@@ at@@ ous or ma@@ ku@@ lo@@ pap@@ ul@@ ous nature , with or without it@@ ching and spontane@@ ously appeared during the second week of treatment and disappeared spontane@@ ously within two weeks without the treatment with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r had to be ab@@ orted . &quot;
&quot; oste@@ o@@ arthritis cases were reported in particular in patients with commonly known risk factors , advanced HIV disease or long @-@ term use of anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) . &quot;
&quot; in the event of an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) , HIV @-@ infected patients with severe immune defect can develop an inflammatory response to asy@@ mpt@@ om@@ atic or residual opportun@@ istic infections ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; with PI pre@@ treated patients receiving 600 mg of A@@ gener@@ a twice daily with low dos@@ ed k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 m@@ g. twice daily ) , the type and frequency of adverse events ( Grade 3 and 4 ) were comparable ; an exception formed elev@@ ations of tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de and CP@@ K values , which were received in patients who received ag@@ glomer@@ ation along with low dos@@ ed k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; in case of over@@ dosing , the patient is observed on signs of in@@ toxic@@ ation ( see section 4.8 ) , if necessary , to initiate necessary suppor@@ tive measures . &quot;
Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r bin@@ ds to the active centre of the HIV @-@ 1 prot@@ ease and thereby prevents the processing of viral g@@ ag@@ - and g@@ ag @-@ pol@@ - poly@@ prot@@ ein@@ stages with the consequence of a formation of un@@ ripe , non inf@@ ectious viral particles . &quot;
&quot; the anti@@ viral activity of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in vitro against HIV @-@ 1 II@@ IB was examined both in acute and chronic lymp@@ ho@@ blas@@ tic cell lines ( MT @-@ 4 , CE@@ M @-@ C@@ CR@@ F , H@@ 9 ) and periph@@ eral blood lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes . &quot;
the 50 % Hem@@ m@@ Con@@ centr@@ ation ( IC@@ 50 ) by Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is in the range of 0.0@@ 12 to 0.0@@ 08 µ@@ M in acute infected cells and is 0.@@ 41 µ@@ M with chronic infected cells .
the connection between the activity of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r against HIV @-@ 1 in vitro and the in@@ hibition of HIV @-@ 1 rep@@ lication in humans is not yet defined .
&quot; in the treatment of anti@@ retro@@ viral not previously treated patients with the currently approved Fos@@ am@@ ren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r dos@@ ages , as with other k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r baked treatment schem@@ as with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors - the mut@@ ations described are rarely observed . &quot;
&quot; in six@@ teen of 434 anti@@ retro@@ viral not treated patients receiving 700@@ mg Fos@@ am@@ ren@@ avi@@ r with 100mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily in the study ES@@ S@@ 100@@ 7@@ 32 , a vi@@ rolog@@ ical failure until week 48 occurred , whereby 14 isol@@ ates were gen@@ otyp@@ ically examined . &quot;
&quot; a gen@@ otyp@@ ic analysis of the isol@@ ates of 13 of 14 children , with which a vi@@ rolog@@ ical failure occurred within the 59 , with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors not previously treated patients showed resistance patterns , similar to those in adults . &quot;
&quot; L@@ 10@@ F / I / V , V@@ 11@@ I , I@@ 13@@ V , K@@ 20@@ R , V@@ 32@@ I , L@@ 33@@ F , E@@ 34@@ Q , M@@ 36@@ I , I@@ 62@@ V , I@@ 50@@ V , I@@ 62@@ V , V@@ 82@@ A / I , I@@ 84@@ V , I@@ 85@@ V , L@@ 90@@ M and I@@ 93@@ L / M . &quot;
&quot; in the AP@@ V@@ 300@@ 03 study and its extension AP@@ V@@ 300@@ 05 ( 700 mg Fos@@ am@@ ren@@ avi@@ r / 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily : n = 107 ) , patients treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors occurred over 96 weeks , the following prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors : &quot;
&quot; based on gen@@ otyp@@ ic resistance tests , gen@@ otyp@@ ic interpre@@ tations can be used to estimate the activity of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or Fos@@ am@@ ren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; the current ( July 2006 ) AN@@ RS @-@ AC @-@ 11 algorithm for Fos@@ am@@ ren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r defined resistance than the presence of mut@@ ations V@@ 32@@ I + 147@@ A / V , or at least 4 of the following mut@@ ations L@@ 10@@ F / I , I@@ 62@@ V , V@@ 82@@ A / C / F / G , I@@ 84@@ V and L@@ 90@@ M combined with an increased risk of a vi@@ rolog@@ ical response ( resistance ) . &quot;
&quot; the conclusions regarding the relevance of certain mut@@ ations or mut@@ ation patterns may be subject to changes by additional data , and it is recommended to always draw up the current interpretation systems to analyze the results of resistance tests . &quot;
phen@@ otyp@@ ic detection systems based on phen@@ otyp@@ ic resistance tests can be used in conjunction with gen@@ otyp@@ ic data to estimate the activity of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or Fos@@ am@@ ren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors .
companies that sell diagnostic resistance tests have developed clin@@ ically @-@ phen@@ otyp@@ ic cut @-@ off@@ s ( separation points ) for F@@ PV / R@@ TV which can be used to interpret the results of a resistance testing .
&quot; each of these four gene patterns associated with a reduced sensitivity to am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r associated genetic patterns creates a certain cross @-@ resistance to Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , the sensitivity to in@@ din@@ avi@@ r , nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r and sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r remains generally preserved . &quot;
&quot; there are currently data on the cross @-@ resistance between Am@@ ph@@ avi@@ r and other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors for all 4 Fos@@ am@@ ren@@ avi@@ r resist@@ ence paths , either alone or in combination with other mut@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; on the basis of twenty @-@ five anti@@ retro@@ viral not pre@@ treated patients , with which an Fos@@ am@@ ren@@ avi@@ r and Sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r ( one of 25 isol@@ ates ) , Dar@@ in@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 25 isol@@ ates ) , in@@ din@@ avi@@ r / rite avi@@ r ( three of 24 isol@@ ates ) , sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 isol@@ ates ) and Ti@@ vol@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( four of 24 isol@@ ates ) appear . &quot;
&quot; conver@@ sely , Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r re@@ tains its activity against some other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors ; the preservation of this activity appears to be dependent on the number and type of resistance mut@@ ations in the isol@@ ates . &quot;
early departure of a different therapy is recommended to keep the accumulation of a variety of mut@@ ations within limits which may affect the subsequent treatment .
&quot; the evidence of the efficacy of A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice daily is based on the study PRO@@ 300@@ 17 , a random@@ ized open study , in which PI pre@@ treated with PI ( 600 mg twice daily ) and Nu@@ kle@@ osi@@ dan@@ alog@@ a ( N@@ RT@@ I ) or a standard therapy ( standard of care , SO@@ C ) with a PI , mainly with low @-@ dos@@ ed Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; one hundred and sixty ( n = 163 ) patients with proven virus sensitivity to A@@ gener@@ ase , at least another PI and at least one N@@ RT@@ I were included in the Part Study A of PRO@@ 300@@ 17 . &quot;
&quot; the primary analysis revealed the non @-@ inf@@ eri@@ ority of AP@@ V / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r compared to the SO@@ C @-@ PI group in the viral load ( A@@ AU@@ C@@ MB ) in the vir@@ us@@ last ( HIV @-@ 1 RNA ) in the plasma after 16 weeks , with a non @-@ slip threshold of 0.4 log@@ 10 copies / ml . &quot;
the evidence of the effectiveness of untreated A@@ gener@@ a is based on two un@@ controlled trials involving 288 HIV infected children aged 2 to 18 years of which 152 were treated with PI .
&quot; in the studies , A@@ gener@@ a solution to intake and capsules of 15 mg / kg three times daily , 20 mg / kg three times daily , 20 mg / kg twice daily and 2@@ 2.5 mg / kg twice daily , with the majority of patients receiving 20 mg / kg twice daily . &quot;
there was no low dos@@ ed k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r at the same time ; the majority of the patients treated with PI had at least one ( 78 % ) or two ( 42 % ) of the N@@ R@@ TI@@ s administered together .
&quot; after 48 weeks , approximately 25 % of the patients included a plasma @-@ HIV @-@ 1 RNA concentration &lt; 10,000 copies / ml and 9 % &lt; 400 copies / ml in a medi@@ an increase in CD@@ 4 cell count of 26 cells / mm ³ ( n = 74 ) compared to the initial value . &quot;
&quot; 19 Based on these data , treatment optimisation with PI pre@@ treated children should be considered as expected benefits of &quot; un@@ ble@@ mis@@ ed &quot; gen@@ ase . &quot;
&quot; after oral dosing , the average duration ( T@@ max ) amounts to the maximum ser@@ um concentration of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r approximately 1 to 2 hours for the capsule and approximately 0.5 to 1 hour for the solution . &quot;
&quot; 508 % increase , on the other hand , by 30 % , when Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 m@@ g. twice daily ) was administered together with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) . &quot;
&quot; the administration of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r with a meal leads to a 25 % decrease in the AU@@ C , but has no effect on the concentration of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r 12 hours after dosage ( C@@ 12 ) . &quot;
&quot; therefore , the minimum concentration in the steady state ( C@@ min , ss ) remained un@@ affected by the intake of food , although the simultaneous intake of food influences the extent and rate of res@@ or@@ ption . &quot;
the apparent distribution volume is approximately 430 l ( 6 l / kg at a body weight of 70 kg ) and can be closed to a large distribution volume as well as an un@@ imp@@ eded penetration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r from the blood@@ stream into the tissue .
&quot; this change leads to a decrease in the overall concentration of the active substance in plasma , whereby the amount of un@@ bound am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , which represents the active part , probably remains unchanged . &quot;
&quot; while the absolute concentration of un@@ bound am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r remains constant , the percentage of free active ingredients fluctu@@ ates during dosing intervals in the steady state via the range of C@@ MA@@ x , ss to C@@ min , ss . &quot;
&quot; therefore , medicines that in@@ duce C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 or inhi@@ bit or sub@@ strate a sub@@ strate of C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 must be administered with caution when given at the same time with A@@ gener@@ ase ( see Sec@@ tions 4.3 , 4.4 and 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; the gift of A@@ gener@@ ase capsules , either 20 mg / kg twice or 15 mg / kg three times daily , leads to a similar daily Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r exposure as in adults with a dose of 1200 mg twice daily . &quot;
&quot; Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is a solution 14 % less bio@@ availability than the capsules ; therefore , A@@ gener@@ ase solution and A@@ gener@@ ase capsules are not inter@@ changeable on a multi @-@ milli@@ gram basis . &quot;
&quot; the ren@@ al clearance of k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is also neg@@ li@@ gible , hence the impact of a kidney function disorder on the elimination of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is likely to be low . &quot;
these regim@@ ens lead to Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r plas@@ mas@@ pi@@ ps comparable to those obtained from healthy volunteers after a dose of 1200 mg Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r twice daily without the simultaneous administration of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
&quot; in long @-@ term studies on pul@@ pit disease with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r mice and rats , h@@ ep@@ at@@ oc@@ ular aden@@ omas of male animals occurred in dos@@ ages , which were compared to the 2,0 @-@ fold ( mice ) or 3,@@ 8@@ - times ( rat ) of exposure to humans , after twice daily gift of 1200 mg Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
the 21 underlying mechanism for the gen@@ esis of h@@ ep@@ at@@ oc@@ ular veins and car@@ cin@@ omas has not yet been solved and the relevance of these observed effects for humans is un@@ clear .
&quot; however , the present exposure data on the human being , both from clinical studies and the therapeutic application , showed little evidence of the adoption of a clinical relevance of these findings . &quot;
&quot; in a standard battery of in @-@ vi@@ vo@@ - and in @-@ vitro gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity tests , the bacterial reverse mut@@ ation tests ( Am@@ es test ) , mice lymp@@ ho@@ m test , micro@@ core test on rats and chromos@@ om@@ al ab@@ err@@ ation test on human periph@@ eral lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes , Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r was neither mut@@ agen@@ ic nor gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic . &quot;
&quot; this liver toxic@@ ity can be monitored and proven in clinical routine by measuring AST , AL@@ T and the activity of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase . &quot;
&quot; until now , no significant liver toxic@@ ity in patients was observed in clinical trials , neither during the administration of A@@ gener@@ a nor after the end of the treatment . &quot;
&quot; studies on the toxic@@ ity of young animals treated at a age of 4 days showed a high mort@@ ality , both during the inspection and with the animals treated with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; in a system@@ ic plasma exposure , which was significantly below ( rab@@ bits ) or not significantly higher ( rats ) than the expected exposure to the human being was observed , however , a number of minor changes including thy@@ mus jug@@ ation and mar@@ ginal skel@@ etal changes were observed , which indicate a delayed development . &quot;
&quot; 24 If A@@ gener@@ ase capsules are applied without the intensi@@ fying addition of k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( boo@@ ster@@ ung ) , higher doses of A@@ gener@@ ase ( 1200 mg twice daily ) must be applied . &quot;
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase capsules amounts to 20 mg Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs up to a daily dose of 2400 mg Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r which should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; simultaneous application is to be treated with caution in patients with weak or mild liver dysfunction , in patients with severe liver dysfunction treatment it is contra@@ indicated ( see section 4.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; 26 For some medicines that can cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects such as car@@ b@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cy@@ c@@ lic anti@@ de@@ press@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under supervision of the International Norm@@ alised R@@ atio ) , methods are available for determining the active ingredients . &quot;
&quot; A@@ gener@@ ase should be canc@@ eled for duration 27 , if a r@@ ash of system@@ ic or allergic symptoms is accompanied or the mu@@ c@@ ous membran@@ es are involved ( see section 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; increased risk of li@@ po@@ dy@@ stro@@ phy was associated with individual factors such as higher age , and with drug @-@ dependent factors , such as a prolonged anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and the associated metabolic disorders . &quot;
&quot; it has been shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes a 82 % reduction in the AU@@ C of Am@@ pri@@ avi@@ r , which can lead to a vi@@ rolog@@ ical failure and a resistance development . &quot;
&quot; 508 % increase , on the other hand , reduced by 30 % when Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 m@@ g. twice daily ) is administered in combination with Am@@ pri@@ avi@@ r capsule ( 600 mg twice daily ) . &quot;
&quot; the C@@ min values of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in plasma that were reached twice daily with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) , are approximately 40 to 50 % lower than when Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) is administered twice daily in combination with 100 mg ritual avi@@ r twice daily . &quot;
&quot; dosage recommendation for simultaneous administration of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Kal@@ et@@ ra cannot be given , but it is recommended to closely monitor the effectiveness and harm@@ lessness of this combination . &quot;
treatment with E@@ f@@ avi@@ ren@@ z in combination with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r is not recommended as the exposure of both prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors would be low .
&quot; if these drugs are used together , caution is advised ; a thorough clinical and vi@@ rolog@@ ical monitoring should be carried out since a precise pre@@ diction of the effect of the combination of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r to Del@@ avi@@ r@@ din is difficult . &quot;
&quot; if it is necessary for clinical reasons , to admini@@ ster ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin along with as@@ gener@@ a , a reduction of the dosage of ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin to at least half of the recommended dose is 31 , although no clinical data is available . &quot;

&quot; in the case of simultaneous offering of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants along with as@@ gener@@ a , increased control of the IN@@ R ( International Norm@@ alised R@@ atio ) is recommended due to the possibility of weak@@ ening or strengthening the anti@@ th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic effect ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
the simultaneous administration of Orth@@ o @-@ Nov@@ um 1 / 35 ( 0.0@@ 35 mg of eth@@ in@@ yl est@@ radi@@ ol plus 1.0 mg Nor@@ eth@@ in@@ dr@@ on ) resulted in a decrease in the AU@@ C and C@@ min by Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r by 22 % res@@ p .
&quot; during pregnancy , this medicine may be applied only after careful weighing of possible benefits for the mother compared to possible risks for the fet@@ us . &quot;
&quot; a reproductive study of pregnant rats , which was administered by the penetration into the uter@@ us until the end of the breast@@ feeding time , showed a dimin@@ ished increase in body weight in the seed . &quot;
the harm@@ lessness of A@@ gener@@ a was studied in adults and children from 4 years in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
&quot; in case of over@@ dosing , the patient is observed on signs of in@@ toxic@@ ation ( see section 4.8 ) , if necessary , to initiate necessary suppor@@ tive measures . &quot;
&quot; the anti@@ viral activity of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in vitro against HIV @-@ 1 II@@ IB was examined both in acute and chronic lymp@@ ho@@ blas@@ tic cell lines ( MT @-@ 4 , CE@@ M @-@ C@@ CR@@ F , H@@ 9 ) and periph@@ eral blood lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes . &quot;
the 50 % Hem@@ m@@ Con@@ centr@@ ation ( IC@@ 50 ) by Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is in the range of 0.0@@ 12 to 0.0@@ 08 µ@@ M in acute infected cells and is 0.@@ 41 µ@@ M with chronic infected cells ( 1 µ@@ M = 0.@@ 50 µ@@ g / ml ) .
&quot; conver@@ sely , Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r re@@ tains its activity against some other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors ; the preservation of this activity appears to be dependent on the number and type of resistance mut@@ ations in the isol@@ ates . &quot;
&quot; based on these data , treatment optimisation with PI pre@@ treated children should be considered as expected benefits of &quot; un@@ geb@@ oo@@ ster@@ tem &quot; gen@@ ase . &quot;
&quot; while the absolute concentration of un@@ bound am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r remains constant , the percentage of free active ingredients fluctu@@ ates during dosing intervals in the steady state via the range of C@@ MA@@ x , ss to C@@ min , ss .. &quot;
&quot; therefore , medicines that in@@ duce C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 or inhi@@ bit or sub@@ strate a sub@@ strate of C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 must be administered with caution when given at the same time with A@@ gener@@ ase ( see Sec@@ tions 4.3 , 4.4 and 4.5 ) . &quot;
the ren@@ al clearance of k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is also neg@@ li@@ gible ; hence the impact of a kidney function disorder on the elimination of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is likely to be low .
&quot; in long @-@ term studies on pul@@ pit disease with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r mice and rats , h@@ ep@@ at@@ oc@@ ular aden@@ omas of male animals occurred with dos@@ ages , which correspon@@ ded to the 2,0 @-@ fold ( mice ) or 3,@@ 8@@ - times ( rat ) of exposure to humans according to twice daily gift of 1200 mg Am@@ ph@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
the underlying mechanism for the gen@@ esis of h@@ ep@@ at@@ oc@@ ele cellular aden@@ omas and car@@ cin@@ omas has not yet been solved and the relevance of these observed effects for humans is un@@ clear .

&quot; studies on the toxic@@ ity of young animals treated at a age of 4 days showed a high mort@@ ality , both during the inspection and with the animals treated with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; these results suggest that the metabol@@ isation routes are not fully mature , so Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r or other critical components of the formulation ( z . &quot;
&quot; A@@ gener@@ ase solution to intake is indicated in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines to treat HIV @-@ 1 infected , prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors ( PI ) and children from 4 years onwards . &quot;
the benefit of using Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r &quot; A@@ gener@@ ase solution to intake was not covered with PI pre @-@ treated patients nor with PI .
the bio@@ availability of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r as a solution to intake is 14 % lower than by Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r as capsule ; therefore A@@ gener@@ ase capsules and solution are not replac@@ eable on a milli@@ gram per milli@@ gram basis ( see section 5.2 ) .
&quot; patients should , once they are able to swal@@ low the capsules , stop taking the solution to intake ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase is 17 mg ( 1.1 ml ) Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight three times daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs up to a daily dose of 28@@ 00 mg Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r which should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; additionally , since no dosage recommendation can be given for the simultaneous use of A@@ gener@@ ase solution to intake and low dos@@ ed k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , this combination should be avoided in these patient groups . &quot;
&quot; although a dose adjustment for Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is not deemed necessary , an application of A@@ gener@@ ase solution to intake in patients with kidney failure is contra@@ indicated ( see section 4.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; due to the potential risk of a toxic reaction as a result of the high Prop@@ ylene gly@@ col@@ ge@@ hal@@ ts , A@@ gener@@ ase is contra@@ indicated for inclusion in small children and children under 4 years , with pregnant women , in patients with limited liver function or liver failure and in patients with kidney failure . &quot;
simultaneous administration can lead to a competitive in@@ hibition of the metabolism of these drugs and potentially provo@@ ke serious and / or life @-@ threatening side effects such as cardiac ar@@ rhyth@@ mia ( z ) .
patients should be advised that A@@ gener@@ a or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy does not lead to a cure of HIV infection and that they continue to develop opportun@@ istic infections or other complications of HIV infection .
the current anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including treatment with as@@ gener@@ a does not prevent the risk of transm@@ itting HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood .
&quot; for some medicines that can cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects such as car@@ b@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cy@@ c@@ lic anti@@ de@@ press@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under supervision of the International Norm@@ alised R@@ atio ) , methods are available for determining the drug concentration . &quot;
&quot; A@@ gener@@ ase should be prescribed for duration if a skin r@@ ash is accompanied by system@@ ic or allergic symptoms , or the mu@@ c@@ ous membran@@ es are involved ( see section 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; increased risk of li@@ po@@ dy@@ stro@@ phy was associated with individual factors such as higher age , and with drug 49 dependent factors , such as a prolonged anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and related metabolic disorders . &quot;

&quot; 508 % increase , on the other hand , reduced by 30 % when Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 m@@ g. twice daily ) is administered in combination with Am@@ pri@@ avi@@ r capsule ( 600 mg twice daily ) . &quot;
&quot; concur@@ rent intake with A@@ gener@@ ase can significantly increase their plasma concentrations and lead with P@@ DE@@ 5 inhibit@@ ors related side effects including hyp@@ ot@@ en@@ sion , visual imp@@ airment and pri@@ ap@@ ism ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; based on data on 54 other C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors , Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am significantly higher plasma concentrations are expected to be obtained by Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am . &quot;
the potential risk for humans is not known . A@@ gener@@ ase solution to intake may not be used during pregnancy due to possible toxic reactions of the fet@@ us to the pre@@ determined propylene gly@@ col ( see section 4.3 ) .
&quot; in the milk of l@@ act@@ ating rats , am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r @-@ related substances have been detected , but it is not known whether Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r enters the mother &apos;s milk . &quot;

&quot; the application frequency and duration of treatment with Al@@ dar@@ a depend on the disease to be treated : • In case of case war@@ ts in the genital area , the cream is up to a maximum of 16 weeks . • In case of small bas@@ al cell car@@ cin@@ omas , it is during one or two four @-@ week treatment cycles , with four weeks of break between the cycles of treatment , three times a week . &quot;
&quot; before bed@@ time , the cream is th@@ inn@@ y to apply to the affected skin areas so that it remains sufficiently long ( about eight hours ) on the skin before they are washed off . &quot;
&quot; in all studies Al@@ dar@@ a was compared with a plac@@ ebo ( same cream , but without the active ingredient ) . • Al@@ dar@@ a was tested in four main studies of 9@@ 23 patients with war@@ ts in the genital area for 16 weeks . &quot;
&quot; • Al@@ dar@@ a was also examined in 7@@ 24 patients with small bas@@ al cell car@@ cin@@ omas in two studies , in which patients were treated for six weeks and Al@@ dar@@ a or the plac@@ ebo applied either daily or five times a week . &quot;
the main indicator for the efficacy was the number of patients with complete healing of tum@@ ours after twelve weeks . • Al@@ dar@@ a was also tested in two studies on 505 patients with acute ker@@ at@@ oses .
&quot; • In all studies Al@@ dar@@ a was more effective than the plac@@ ebo . • In the treatment of war@@ ts in the genital area , the complete healing rate was 15 % to 52 % in patients treated with plac@@ ebo , but only 3 % to 18 % in the patients treated with Al@@ dar@@ a compared to 0 % to 3 % in the plac@@ ebo group . &quot;
the most common side effects of Al@@ dar@@ a ( observed with more than 1 of 10 patients ) are reactions to the application body of the cream ( pain or it@@ ching ) .
&quot; clin@@ ically typical , non @-@ hyper@@ trop@@ hic , non @-@ hyper@@ trop@@ hic ker@@ at@@ oses ( AK@@ s ) in the face or on the scal@@ p in immun@@ o@@ competent adults if the size or number of les@@ ions limit the efficacy and / or the acceptance of a cr@@ y@@ otherapy and other top@@ ical treatment options are contra@@ indicated or less suitable . &quot;
&quot; Monday , Wednesday and Friday or Tuesday , Thursday and Saturday ) to apply before bed@@ time and leave for 6 to 10 hours on the skin . &quot;
&quot; the treatment with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ i@@ od@@ ine cream is to continue until all visible co@@ war@@ ts have disappeared in the genital or per@@ ic@@ um areas , or up to a maximum of 16 weeks per treatment period . &quot;
an inter@@ ruption in the procedure described above should be wo@@ ken when intensive local inflammatory reactions occur ( see section 4.4 ) or if an infection is observed in the treatment area .
&quot; if follow @-@ up examination 4 to 8 weeks after the second treatment period the treated les@@ ions are completely healed , another therapy should be started ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; if a dose has been om@@ itted , the patient must apply the cream as soon as he / she not@@ ices this and then continue with the usual therapeutic plan . &quot;
&quot; I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream is to apply in a thin layer and spread in the cleaned , with inc@@ line infected skin area until the cream complet@@ es completely . &quot;
&quot; in these patients , it should take place between the benefits of treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ i@@ od@@ ine and the risk associated with a possible exac@@ erb@@ ation of their auto@@ immune disease . &quot;
&quot; in these patients , it should take place between the benefits of treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ i@@ od@@ ine and the risk associated with a possible organ rejection or gra@@ ft @-@ versus @-@ host reaction . &quot;
&quot; in other studies , in which no daily pre @-@ h@@ olog@@ y@@ gi@@ ene was performed , two cases of severe phi@@ mo@@ sis and one case were observed with a circum@@ cis@@ sion of leading stri@@ ctions . &quot;
&quot; when applying I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream in higher than recommended doses , there is an increased risk of severe local skin irrit@@ ation ( see section 4.2 . ) in rare cases , severe local skin irrit@@ ation was observed , which made a treatment and / or have caused a temporary physical imp@@ airment . &quot;
&quot; in cases where such reactions occurred at the outcome of the ureth@@ ra , some women had difficulty passing urine which necess@@ it@@ ated emergency cath@@ et@@ isation and treatment of the affected area . &quot;
&quot; to use I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream immediately following a treatment with other cut@@ aneous apped resources to treat external in@@ ward war@@ ts in the genital and per@@ ic@@ um areas , no clinical experiences have yet occurred . &quot;
&quot; limited data points to an increased rate of inc@@ lin@@ ation reductions in HIV positive patients , I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ i@@ od@@ ine cr@@ è@@ me has shown a lower effectiveness in this group of patients with regard to the removal of the inc@@ lin@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; the treatment of the bas@@ al cell car@@ cin@@ oma with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ i@@ od@@ ine within 1 cm around the eyel@@ ids , nose , lips , or hair attachment was not investigated . &quot;
local skin reactions are frequent but the intensity of these reactions decreases in general during therapy or the reactions form after completion of the treatment with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ i@@ od@@ ine cream .
&quot; if it is necessary due to the dis@@ comfort of the patient or due to the sever@@ ity of local skin reactions , a treatment break may be made several days . &quot;
the clinical outcome of the therapy can be assessed after regeneration of the treated skin approximately 12 weeks after the end of the treatment .
&quot; as currently , no data on long @-@ term healing rates of more than 36 months after treatment are available , other appropriate forms of therapy should be considered in super@@ ficial bas@@ al cell car@@ cin@@ omas . &quot;
&quot; in patients with recur@@ rent and pre @-@ treated B@@ CC@@ s no clinical experience is present , so the application is not recommended in pre @-@ treated tum@@ ours . &quot;
data from an open clinical study point out that in large tum@@ ours ( &gt; 7.@@ 25 c@@ m2 ) a lower probability of response to I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od therapy consists .
&quot; I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od was not examined for the treatment of acute ker@@ at@@ oses on eyel@@ ids , inside the nose or ears or on the lip area inside the lip area . &quot;
there are only very limited data about the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od for the treatment of acute ker@@ at@@ oses on anatom@@ ical bodies outside the face and the scal@@ p .
&quot; the available data on the ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ ose on the for@@ ear@@ ms and hands do not support the effectiveness of this application , therefore such an application is not recommended . &quot;
local skin reactions occur frequently but these reactions usually take off in the course of therapy in intensity or go back after setting the therapy with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ i@@ od@@ ine cream .
&quot; if the local skin reactions are causing great dis@@ comfort to the patient or are very strong , the treatment may be suspended for a few days . &quot;
&quot; from the data of an open clinical study , patients with more than 8 active les@@ ions showed a lower healing rate than patients with fewer than 8 les@@ ions . &quot;
&quot; due to the immun@@ os@@ tim@@ ul@@ atory properties , I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream should be applied with caution in patients receiving an immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive treatment ( see 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; animal studies do not produce direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy , the embry@@ onic / feder@@ ate development , the binding or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; although no quanti@@ fiable Ser@@ um levels ( &gt; 5@@ ng / ml ) have been achieved , no recommendation can be given during breast@@ feeding . &quot;
the most frequent contribut@@ ors and as likely or possibly with the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ Cream in the studies with three times weekly treatment were local reactions in the place of treatment of co@@ war@@ ts ( 33.@@ 7 % of patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od treated patients ) .
&quot; among the most commonly reported and probably or possibly with the application of the I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream related side effects include complaints at the application location , with a frequency of 28.@@ 1 % . &quot;
the side effects reported by 185 with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cr@@ è@@ me from a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled clinical study of Phase III are shown below .
the most common as likely or possibly with the application of the I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ Cream related side effects were in these studies a reaction to the application location ( 22 % of patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od treated patients ) .
&quot; the side effects noted by 252 in plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled clinical studies of Phase III with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream treated patients with acute ker@@ at@@ ose , are listed below . &quot;
&quot; according to the review plan , the assessment of clinical signs shows that in these plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled clinical trials with three times weekly treatment with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream frequently came to local skin reactions including Er@@ y@@ thema ( 61 % ) , ero@@ sion ( 30 % ) and ede@@ ma ( 23 % ) and ede@@ ma ( 14 % ) ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; according to the review plan fores@@ een the assessment of clinical signs shows that in these trials with five times weekly treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cr@@ è@@ me , severe ero@@ sions ( 13 % ) , and severe scar@@ ring formation ( 19 % ) occurred . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials for the investigation of the use of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od for the treatment of the acute ker@@ at@@ osis , al@@ op@@ eci@@ a was diagnosed with a frequency of 0.4 % ( 5 / 12@@ 14 ) at the treatment centre or in the surrounding area . &quot;
&quot; the acci@@ dental unique oral intake of 200 mg I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od , which corresponds to the content of about 16 bags , could lead to nau@@ sea , v@@ om@@ iting , head@@ aches , my@@ al@@ gia and fever . &quot;
&quot; the clin@@ ically severe side effect , which occurred after several oral doses of &gt; 200 mg , consisted of hyp@@ ot@@ onia which norm@@ alized after oral or intra@@ ven@@ ous fluid . &quot;
&quot; in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic examination , system@@ ic concentrations of alpha @-@ interfer@@ ons and other cy@@ tok@@ ines were detected after the top@@ ical application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od . &quot;
in 3 phase @-@ relevant phase 3 efficacy studies could be shown that the efficacy in relation to a complete healing of the inc@@ lin@@ ation during an I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od treatment is clearly superior to a plac@@ ebo treatment .
60 % of the patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ ine treated patients completely ; this was at 20 % of 105 patients with plac@@ ebo ( 95 % CI ) :
&quot; a complete healing could be reached at 23 % of 157 with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ ine treated male patients , compared to 5 % of 161 with plac@@ ebo @-@ treated male patients ( 95 % CI ) : &quot;
&quot; the efficacy of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od with five @-@ time application per week for 6 weeks was examined in two double @-@ blind , plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled clinical trials . &quot;
the target tum@@ ors were hist@@ ologically confirmed single primary super@@ fi@@ zi@@ al bas@@ al cell car@@ cin@@ omas with a minimum size of 0.5 c@@ m2 and a maximum diameter of 2 cm .
&quot; the data from an open , un@@ controlled long @-@ term study after four years showed that approximately 7@@ 9.3 % &#91; 95 % CI ( 7@@ 3.7 % , 8@@ 4.9 % ) &#93; of all treated patients were clin@@ ically healed and this remained for 48 months . &quot;
&quot; the efficacy of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od with three times weekly use in one or two treatment periods of 4 weeks , interrupted by a four @-@ week , treatment @-@ free period , was investigated in two double @-@ blind , plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled clinical studies . &quot;
&quot; patients had clin@@ ically typical , visible , dis@@ crete , non @-@ hyper@@ trop@@ hic , non @-@ hyper@@ trop@@ hic active les@@ ions within a coher@@ ent 25 c@@ m2 treatment area on un@@ ha@@ iry scal@@ p or face . &quot;
the nine @-@ year data from two combined observation studies indicate a recur@@ rence rate of 27 % for patients with clinical retri@@ eval after one or two treatment periods ( 35 / 128 patients ) .
&quot; the approved indications exterior co@@ war@@ ts , ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ osis and super @-@ fi@@ zi@@ al cell car@@ cin@@ oma usually do not occur in pa@@ edi@@ atric patients and were therefore not investigated . &quot;
&quot; Al@@ dar@@ a Cream was studied in four random@@ ised , double @-@ blind plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled studies of children aged 2 to 15 with M@@ oll@@ us@@ cum cont@@ agi@@ os@@ um ( I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od n = 576 , plac@@ ebo n = 313 ) . &quot;
the effectiveness of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od could not be shown in these studies with the dos@@ ages investigated ( 3x / week for a period of ≤ 16 weeks or respectively .
a minimal system@@ ic intake of the 5 % I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cr@@ è@@ me by the skin of 58 patients with acute ker@@ at@@ osis was observed during the three times weekly application during 16 weeks .
&quot; the highest concentrations of drugs in ser@@ um at the end of the week 16 were observed between 9 and 12 hours and bet@@ s 0,1 , 0.2 and 1.6 ng / ml in the face ( 25 mg , 2 bags ) and on the hands / arms ( 75 mg , 6 bags ) . &quot;
the calculated half @-@ life time was about 10 times higher than the 2 @-@ hour half @-@ time after the sub@@ cut@@ aneous use in a previous study ; this indicates an extended retention of the medicine in the skin .
the data on system@@ ic exposure showed that the res@@ or@@ ption of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine after top@@ ical application was low in patients aged 6 to 12 years and comparable to that of healthy adults and adults with ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ ose or super @-@ fi@@ zi@@ al cell car@@ cin@@ oma .
&quot; in a four @-@ month study for der@@ mal toxic@@ ity in rats , doses of 0.5 and 2.5 mg / kg may result in significantly reduced body weight and increased mil@@ z weight ; a study conducted for four months resulted in the mouse no similar effects . &quot;
a two @-@ year study of car@@ cin@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity in mice on oral dosing on three days per week induced no tum@@ ors at the application place .
&quot; the corresponding mechanism is not known , but since I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine has only a low system@@ ic absorption of the human skin and is not mut@@ ed , there is a risk for human beings due to system@@ ic exposure to be very low . &quot;
&quot; the tum@@ ours occurred in the group of mice treated with the active @-@ free cream , earlier and in larger numbers than in the control group with low UV@@ R . &quot;

&quot; a reduced number of blood cells can make you more sus@@ cep@@ tible to infections ; it can cause you to create a blue stain , or they can cause de@@ position . &quot;
tell your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if any of the listed side effects will significantly affect you or you notice side effects that are not specified in this information .
&quot; in addition , you can feel it@@ ching ( 32 % of patients ) , burning ( 26 % of patients ) or pain in the areas you applied Al@@ dar@@ a cream ( 8 % of the patient ) . &quot;
&quot; most of the cases are lighter skin reactions , which may sound again within approximately 2 weeks after the treatment . &quot;
&quot; occasionally , some patients notice changes in the application place ( wound secre@@ tion , inflammation , swelling , scar@@ ring , skin destruction , bli@@ sters , der@@ mati@@ tis ) or irrit@@ ability , nau@@ sea , dry mouth , flu @-@ like symptoms and ti@@ red@@ ness . &quot;

Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me is used for enzyme replacement therapy in patients with assured diagnosis of Mu@@ cop@@ ol@@ ys@@ ac@@ chari@@ dosis I ( M@@ PS I ; α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase deficiency ) to treat the not neurolog@@ ical manifest@@ ations of the disease ( the symptoms that are not associated with brain or nerves ) .
&quot; this means that certain substances ( gly@@ cos@@ amin@@ og@@ ly@@ cans , g@@ ags ) are not degra@@ ded and thus accum@@ ulate in most organs in the body and damage it . &quot;
&quot; the following non @-@ neurolog@@ ical symptoms of the M@@ PS I can occur : enlarged liver , sti@@ ff joints , the movements harder , decreased lung volume , heart and eye diseases . &quot;
the treatment with al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should be monitored by a doctor who has experience in treating patients with M@@ PS I or other her@@ edit@@ ary metabolic disorders .
&quot; the administration of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should take place in a hospital or a clinic with re@@ vit@@ alisation devices , and patients may need drugs to prevent allergic reaction . &quot;

&quot; the study mainly investigated the safety of the drug , but it has also measured its effectiveness ( by examining the effect of reducing G@@ AG concentrations in the urine and in relation to the size of the liver ) . &quot;
&quot; in children under the age of five , Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me reduced G@@ AG concentrations in the urine by about 60 % , and half of the treated children showed a normal large liver at the end of the study . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in patients aged over five years ( observed with more than 1 of 10 patients ) are head@@ aches , nau@@ sea , abdominal pain , skin r@@ ash , ar@@ th@@ rop@@ athy ( joint pain ) , back pain , pain in limbs ( in hands and feet ) , heat sensation , fever and reactions at the in@@ fusion station . &quot;
&quot; frequent side @-@ effects in patients under five years are elevated blood pressure , decreased oxygen satur@@ ation ( a measurement size of lung function ) , t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia ( accelerated heart rate ) , fever and ch@@ ills . &quot;
&quot; al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me may not be used in patients who may be highly hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase or any of the other ingredients ( an@@ aphy@@ lac@@ tic reaction ) , not to be used . &quot;

the manufacturer of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me will observe patients who receive al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me regarding the reactions to the in@@ fusion and the development of antibodies .
&quot; in June 2003 , the European Commission issued a permit to the company Gen@@ zy@@ me Europe B.@@ V. for the launch of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me throughout the European Union . &quot;
&quot; Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is a re@@ combin@@ ant form of the human α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase and is produced using re@@ combin@@ ant DNA technology using CH@@ O mamm@@ alian cell cultures ( Chinese hamster O@@ vary , ov@@ arian of Chinese hamster ) . &quot;

the treatment with al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should be done by a doctor who has experience in treating patients with M@@ PS I or other inherited metabolic diseases .
the initial in@@ fusion rate of 2 E / kg / h can be increased if the patient carries out this every 15 minutes in single steps to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h .
&quot; the safety and efficacy of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in adults over 65 years has not been determined , and for these patients no dosing schedule can be recommended . &quot;
&quot; the safety and efficacy of al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in patients with kidney or liver failure has not been determined , and no dosing schedule can be recommended for these patients . &quot;
&quot; with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me patients , in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions can develop , which are defined as any side effect that occurs during in@@ fusion or until the end of the in@@ fusion @-@ day ( see section 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , especially these patients should continue to be closely monitored and the in@@ fusion of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should only be carried out in an appropriate clinical setting , in which re@@ vit@@ alisation facilities for medical emer@@ gen@@ cies are immediately available . &quot;
&quot; due to the clinical phase 3 study , it is expected that virtually all patients form Ig@@ G antibodies against lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase , usually within 3 months from the start of treatment . &quot;
&quot; patients who develop antibodies or symptoms of in@@ fu@@ sions , must be treated with caution when using Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me ( see Sec@@ tions 4.3 and 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; due to the theore@@ tically increased risk of a hyper@@ sensitivity reaction after an inter@@ ruption of the treatment , there is little experience regarding the recovery of the treatment . &quot;
&quot; 60 minutes before the start of in@@ fusion with medications ( anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ini@@ ka and / or anti@@ py@@ re@@ tics ) , to minimize the potential occurrence of in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions . &quot;
&quot; in the event of light or moderate in@@ fu@@ sions , treatment with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ini@@ ka and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen should be wo@@ ken up and / or a reduction in the in@@ fusion rate to half of the in@@ fusion rate at which the reaction has occurred . &quot;
&quot; in the event of a single , severe in@@ fusion @-@ related reaction , in@@ fusion must be stopped until the symptoms are reduced , a treatment with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ini@@ ka and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen is to be considered . &quot;
in@@ fusion can be res@@ um@@ ed again with a reduction in in@@ fusion rate on 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the in@@ fusion rate in which the reaction occurred .
3 ( anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ini@@ ka and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen and / or cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids ) as well as a reduction of in@@ fusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the in@@ fusion rate at which the pre@@ pending reaction has occurred .
&quot; Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should not be used concur@@ r@@ ently with chlor@@ o@@ qu@@ ine or proc@@ aine , because there is a potential risk of interfer@@ enz with the intra@@ cellular intake of lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase . &quot;
&quot; experimental studies do not allow direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth and post@@ nat@@ al development ( see Section 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; since no data on new@@ bor@@ ns , which were exposed to lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase over the mother &apos;s milk , it is recommended to not satisfy during the treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me . &quot;
side effects in clinical trials were mainly classified as in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions which were observed in 53 % of patients in phase 3 study ( treatment duration up to 4 years ) and at 35 % of patients in the study with participants under 5 years ( treatment duration up to 1 year ) .
adverse drug reactions in connection with al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me that were observed during the Phase 3 study and their leng@@ th@@ ening in a total of 45 patients at the age of 5 years or older at a treatment duration of up to 4 years are listed in the following table : very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) .
&quot; in some patients with severe M@@ PS @-@ I @-@ conditional participation of the upper respiratory tract and lungs in the pre@@ history , severe reactions occurred , including bron@@ ch@@ os@@ pas@@ mus , breathing l@@ act@@ ness and facial ede@@ ma ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; children Un@@ desirable drug interactions in connection with al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , which were reported in a phase 2 study with a total of 20 patients at the age of 5 , with a predominantly severe follow @-@ up form and treatment duration up to 12 months , are listed in the table . &quot;
&quot; 100 E / kg intra@@ ven@@ ously once a week ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intra@@ ven@@ ously once a week , 200 E / kg intra@@ ven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intra@@ ven@@ ously every 2 weeks . &quot;
&quot; in most patients , it occurred within 3 months after the treatment was treated with a ser@@ o@@ con@@ version ( average after 26 days versus 45 days in patients aged 5 years and older ) . &quot;
&quot; until the end of the Phase 3 study ( or up to a premature departure from the study ) , no antibodies were detected in 13 / 45 patients ( RI@@ P ) ass@@ ay , including 3 patients , where it never came to Ser@@ o@@ Con@@ version . &quot;
&quot; patients with low to low antibody levels showed a robust reduction in the urine level in the urine , while in patients with high antibody ti@@ ters a variable reduction of G@@ AG in the urine was determined . &quot;
four patients ( three in phase 3 study and one in phase 2 study ) showed a mar@@ ginal to low @-@ neutr@@ alizing inhibit@@ ory effect on enzy@@ matic lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase activity in vitro which did not affect clinical efficacy and / or reduction of G@@ AG in urine .
&quot; the presence of antibodies did not appear to be associated with the incidence of adverse drug reactions , although the occurrence of adverse drug reactions typically coinci@@ ded with the formation of Ig@@ G antibodies . &quot;
the reason for enzyme replacement therapy is one of the hydr@@ o @-@ ly@@ sis of the accum@@ ulative sub@@ strate and the prevention of a further accumulation of sufficient recovery of enzyme activity .
&quot; after intra@@ ven@@ ous in@@ fusion , lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is quickly removed from the circulation and absorbed by cells into the ly@@ s@@ os@@ omes , most likely via Mann@@ ose @-@ 6 @-@ Phosph@@ ate recept@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; the safety and efficacy of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me were examined in a random@@ ized , double @-@ blind , plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled phase 3 study at 45 patients aged 6 to 43 . &quot;
&quot; although patients were recru@@ ited to study the entire disease spectrum , the majority of patients were from the middle phen@@ otype and only one patient showed the heavy phen@@ otype . &quot;
&quot; patients were recru@@ ited if they had a forced exp@@ ir@@ atory volume ( FE@@ V ) of less than 80 % of expected value , and they had to be able to stand for 6 minutes and walk 5 meters . &quot;
the primary end@@ points for the efficacy were the percentage change in the expected FE@@ V and the absolute distance in the 6 @-@ minute test test .
all patients were subsequently recru@@ ited for an open @-@ label extension study where they received another 3.5 years ( 182 weeks ) each week 100 E / kg Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me .
&quot; after 26 weeks of therapy , the patients treated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me showed an improvement in lung function and the ability to respond in the following table . &quot;
the open extension study showed an improvement and / or maintenance of these effects of up to 208 weeks in the Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group and from 182 weeks in the plac@@ ebo / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group as follows from the following table .
the decrease in the expected percentage FE@@ V is clin@@ ically not significantly over this period and the absolute lung volumes increased propor@@ tionally to the height of growing children .
the 26 patients with a h@@ ep@@ atom@@ eg@@ aly before treatment reached 22 ( 85 % ) until the end of the study a normal liver size .
&quot; within the first 4 weeks , a significant decrease in the G@@ AG mirror was found in the urine ( µ@@ g / mg Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in ) , which remained constant until the end of the study . &quot;
&quot; with regard to the hetero@@ geneous disease manifest@@ ations between the patients that were taken into account by using a combined end@@ point , the clin@@ ically significant changes across the efficacy variable ( expected percentage normal FE@@ V , distance in 6 @-@ minute test , range of movement of the shoulder joint AH@@ I and visual acu@@ ity ) , was generally an improvement in 10 patients ( 22 % ) and a deteri@@ oration in 9 patients ( 20 % ) . &quot;
a one @-@ year @-@ old open phase 2 study was conducted in which the safety and pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me were examined in 20 patients who were at the time of their inclusion in the study under 5 years old ( 16 patients with the severe spread form and 4 with mean circulation form ) .
&quot; in four patients , the dosage was increased to 200 E / kg because of increased G@@ ag@@ - mirror in the urine in week 22 . &quot;
&quot; in several patients , a magnitude of magnitude ( n = 7 ) and weight gain ( n = 3 ) were observed after the Z @-@ Score for this age group The younger patients with the severe spread form ( &lt; 2.5 years ) and all 4 patients with the mean stroke rate indicated a normal mental development speed , whereas in older patients with severe distor@@ tion shape only limited or no progress could be determined in cognitive development . &quot;
&quot; in a phase @-@ 4 study , studies on pharmac@@ o@@ dynamic effects of different al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me dosage schem@@ ata were performed on the G@@ AG mirror in the urine , the liver volume and the 6 @-@ minute test test . &quot;
&quot; 100 E / kg intra@@ ven@@ ously once a week ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intra@@ ven@@ ously once a week , 200 E / kg intra@@ ven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intra@@ ven@@ ously every 2 weeks . &quot;
&quot; the dosing regim@@ en with 200 E / kg intra@@ ven@@ ously every 2 weeks can represent a representative alternative in patients who have difficulties with weekly in@@ fu@@ sions ; however , it is not proven that the long @-@ term clinical effectiveness of these two dosage schem@@ as is equivalent . &quot;
&quot; the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( E@@ MEA ) will evaluate any new information available annually , and if necessary , the summary of the characteristics of the medicine will be updated . &quot;
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic profile in patients at the age of 5 was similar to patients with older and less affected patients .
&quot; based on conventional studies on safety har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in one @-@ time gift , toxic@@ ity with repeated offering and reproductive consistency , prec@@ lin@@ ical data do not allow any particular haz@@ ards to humans . &quot;

&quot; within the given time , the holder of the authorisation for placing on the market has completed the following program of study , whose results are the basis for the annual assessment report on the benefit @-@ risk ratio . &quot;
&quot; this register will provide long @-@ term safety and efficacy information to patients treated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , as well as data on the natural progression of the disease in patients without this treatment . &quot;
&quot; in patients suffering from M@@ PS I , there is an enzyme called α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase , which out@@ lines certain substances in the body ( gly@@ cos@@ amin@@ og@@ ly@@ cans ) , either in a small amount or this enzyme is missing completely . &quot;
if you are allergic ( hyper@@ sensitive ) to one of the ingredients of al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me or if you have an allergic reaction to lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase .
an in@@ fusion @-@ related reaction is any side effect that occurs during in@@ fusion or until the end of the in@@ fusion @-@ day ( see section 4 &quot; What side effects are possible &quot; ) .
&quot; when using Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me with other medicines Please inform your doctor if you are taking drugs that contain chlor@@ o@@ qu@@ ine or proc@@ aine , because there is a possible risk of a dimin@@ ished effect of al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me . &quot;
&quot; please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you take other medicines or have recently taken , including non @-@ prescription drugs . &quot;
information for handling - Th@@ inner and application The Con@@ centr@@ ate for the production of an in@@ fusion solution must be dil@@ uted prior to application and is intended for intra@@ ven@@ ous use ( see information for doctors and medical professionals ) .
the initial in@@ fusion rate of 2 E / kg / h can be increased if the patient toler@@ ates this every 15 minutes gradually to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h .
&quot; in some patients with severe M@@ PS @-@ I@@ - conditional participation of the upper respiratory tract and lungs in the pre@@ history , however , severe reactions occurred , including bron@@ ch@@ os@@ pas@@ mus , breathing still@@ s and facial oils . &quot;
&quot; very common ( occurrence in more than 1 of 10 patients ) : • head@@ aches • nau@@ sea • stomach pain • Joint disorders , joint pain , back pain , pain in arms and legs • Er@@ red@@ ness • hyper@@ tension • less oxygen in the blood • reaction at the in@@ fusion station &quot;

preparation of the al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in@@ fusion ( using as@@ ep@@ tic technique ) • to determine the number of di@@ lution fl@@ aps in accordance with the body weight of each patient .
&quot; A@@ lim@@ ta is used together with cis@@ pl@@ atin ( another medicine against cancer ) in patients who have not yet received chemotherapy ( drugs against cancer ) and &quot; mal@@ ign@@ ne &quot; ( mal@@ ign@@ ant - cancer has already spread to other parts of the body ) and is likely to spread easily to other parts of the body . • advanced or metastatic &quot; &quot; non @-@ small &quot; &quot; lung cancer that does not attack the squ@@ am@@ ous epithel@@ ial cells . &quot;
&quot; A@@ lim@@ ta is used in patients who have not been treated before , in combination with cis@@ pl@@ atin and in patients who previously had previously received other chemotherapy regim@@ ens . &quot;
&quot; to reduce side effects , patients should take a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid and fo@@ lic acid ( a vitamin ) during treatment with A@@ lim@@ ta and receive inj@@ ections of vitamin B@@ 12 . &quot;
&quot; if A@@ lim@@ ta is given along with cis@@ pl@@ atin , before or after the gift of cis@@ pl@@ atin , an &quot; anti @-@ em@@ etic &quot; ( medicine against v@@ om@@ iting ) and liquids ( to prevent fluid deficiency ) should be given . &quot;
&quot; in patients whose blood is changed or when certain other side effects occur , the treatment should be postpon@@ ed , removed or reduced the dose . &quot;
the active form of P@@ emet@@ ry s@@ lows down the formation of DNA and RNA and prevents the cells sharing .
&quot; the transformation of P@@ emet@@ ric into its active form is easier to equi@@ p in cancer cells than in healthy cells , resulting in higher concentrations of the active form of the drug and a longer active duration in cancer cells . &quot;
&quot; for the treatment of the mal@@ ign@@ ant ple@@ ur@@ am@@ es@@ othel@@ i@@ oma , A@@ lim@@ ta was examined in a main study of 456 patients who had previously not received chemotherapy against their disease . &quot;
&quot; in the treatment of non @-@ small cell lung cancer , A@@ lim@@ ta &apos;s effects were compared to 571 patients with local advanced or metastatic disease previously treated with chemotherapy , with the effects of doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el ( another drug against cancer ) . &quot;
&quot; A@@ lim@@ ta was also compared to gem@@ cit@@ ab@@ ine ( another medicine against cancer ) , both in combination with cis@@ pl@@ atin in one study at 1 7@@ 25 patients who had previously not received chemotherapy for lung cancer . &quot;
&quot; patients treated with A@@ lim@@ ta and cis@@ pl@@ atin survived an average of 12.@@ 1 months , compared to 9.3 months in the sole administration of cis@@ pl@@ atin . &quot;
&quot; in patients who had previously received chemotherapy , the average survival time with A@@ lim@@ ta was 8.3 months , compared to 7.9 months at doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el . &quot;
&quot; in both studies , however , patients in which cancer did not attack the squ@@ am@@ ous epithel@@ ial cells during the administration of A@@ lim@@ ta for longer survival than with the comparative drug . &quot;
&quot; in September 2004 , the European Commission issued a permit to the company Eli Lil@@ ly Neder@@ land B.@@ V. appro@@ ving the transport of A@@ lim@@ ta throughout the European Union . &quot;
&quot; each drinking bottle must be dissolved with 4.2 ml of 0.9 % sodium chlori@@ de injection solution ( 9 mg / ml ) , which results in a solution of 25 mg / ml . &quot;
the corresponding volume of the necessary dosage is taken from the feed @-@ in bottle and dil@@ uted with 0.9 % sodium chlori@@ de injection solution ( 9 mg / ml ) to 100 ml further ( see section 6.6 ) .
AL@@ IM@@ TA is indicated in combination with cis@@ pl@@ atin for first @-@ line therapy of patients with locally advanced or metastatic non @-@ small bron@@ chi@@ al car@@ cin@@ oma except for overwhelming plate epithel@@ ial hist@@ ology ( see section 5.1 ) .
AL@@ IM@@ TA in mon@@ otherapy is indicated for treatment in second @-@ line treatment of patients with lo@@ - ally advanced or metastatic non @-@ small bron@@ chi@@ al cancer ( see section 5.1 ) .
the recommended dose of AL@@ IM@@ TA 500 mg / m ² of body surface ( KO@@ F ) administered as intra@@ ven@@ ous in@@ fusion over a period of 10 minutes on the first day of every 21 day treatment cycle .
the recommended dose of cis@@ pl@@ atin is 75 mg / m ² KO@@ F as in@@ fusion over a period of 2 hours about 30 minutes after conclusion of the P@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed@@ - In@@ fusion on the first day of every 21 day treatment cycle .
&quot; in patients with non @-@ small bron@@ chi@@ al car@@ cin@@ oma following chemotherapy , the recommended dose of AL@@ IM@@ TA 500 mg / m ² KO@@ F is administered as intra@@ ven@@ ous in@@ fusion over a period of 10 minutes on the first day of every 21 day treatment cycle . &quot;
&quot; to reduce the frequency and sever@@ ity of skin reactions , a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid should be given on the day before and on the day of the P@@ emet@@ ry gift as well as on the day after treatment . &quot;
&quot; during the seven days before the first dose of P@@ emet@@ ry , a minimum of 5 doses of fo@@ lic acid must be taken and intake must be continued during the whole treatment period as well as for another 21 days after the last P@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed@@ - dose . &quot;
patients also need to receive in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular injection of vitamin B@@ 12 ( 1000 mc@@ g ) during the week before the first P@@ emet@@ ric dose and after each third operating cycle .
&quot; in patients receiving P@@ emet@@ ry , a complete blood image should be created before every gift , including a differentiation of leu@@ ko@@ cy@@ tes and a th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ te counting . &quot;
&quot; alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase ( AP ) , as@@ part@@ ate trans@@ amin@@ ase ( AST or S@@ GO@@ T ) and al@@ anine trans@@ amin@@ ase ( AL@@ T or S@@ GP@@ T ) should be ≤ 3 times the upper limit value . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of a new treatment cycle , a dose examination must take place under consideration of the N@@ adi@@ r of the blood image or the maximum non @-@ ha@@ em@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity of pre@@ - h@@ itting therapy cycles . &quot;
&quot; after recovery , patients need to be treated according to the indications in tables 1 , 2 and 3 which apply to AL@@ IM@@ TA as mon@@ otherapy or in combination with cis@@ pl@@ atin . &quot;
these criteria correspond to the definition of the National Cancer Institute Common Tox@@ ic@@ ity C@@ rit@@ eria ( CT@@ C v@@ 2.0 ; N@@ CI 1998 ) ≥ CT@@ C grade 2 blood .
&quot; should patients develop non @-@ ha@@ em@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity ≥ degree 3 ( except neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity ) , treatment with AL@@ IM@@ TA must be interrupted until the patient has the value before treatment . &quot;
the treatment with AL@@ IM@@ TA must be canc@@ eled if in patients after 2 dose reduc@@ ers a hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity or non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity level 3 or 4 occurs or so@@ - on the incidence of grade 3 or 4 neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity .
clinical trials showed no indication that in patients at the age of 65 years or above all patients at the age of 65 a higher in@@ effective risk exists .
AL@@ IM@@ TA is not recommended for use in children under 18 years due to insufficient data on harm@@ lessness and efficacy .
&quot; in clinical trials , patients with a Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance of ≥ 45 ml / min were no dosage adap@@ tations that go beyond the dose adap@@ tations recommended for all patients . &quot;
the data base in patients with a Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance of less than 45 ml / min was not sufficient ; therefore the application is not recommended ( see section 4.4 ) .
&quot; however , patients with liver dysfunction of &gt; the 1.5 @-@ times of the upper bili@@ ru@@ bin limit and / or trans@@ am@@ inian values of &gt; the 3.0 times of the upper limit ( in the presence of liver metast@@ ases ) or &gt; 5.0 @-@ times of the upper limit ( for presence of liver metast@@ ases ) are not investigated specifically in the studies . &quot;
&quot; patients must be monitored with regard to bone mar@@ row supp@@ ression and P@@ emet@@ ry may not be given to patients before their absolute neut@@ ro@@ phi@@ al number has reached a value of ≥ 1500 cells / mm ³ and the th@@ rom@@ bo@@ - number of cells again has reached a value of ≥ 100 cells / mm ³ . &quot;
&quot; dose @-@ reduction for further cycles is based on the N@@ adi@@ r of absolute neutr@@ ality numbers , th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ tes and maximum non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity , as observed in previous cycles ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; a lower toxic@@ ity and a reduction of grade 3 / 4 hem@@ at@@ ological and non @-@ smoking toxic@@ ity like neut@@ rop@@ enia , f@@ eb@@ r@@ ile neut@@ rop@@ enia and infection with grade 3 / 4 neut@@ rop@@ enia were observed when a pre @-@ treatment with fo@@ lic acid and vitamin B@@ 12 had taken place . &quot;
&quot; therefore , all patients treated with emet@@ ric @-@ mixed patients need to use fo@@ lic acid and vitamin B@@ 12 as a proph@@ yl@@ actic measure for the reduction of treatment @-@ related toxic@@ ity ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot;
patients with mild to moderate ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance 45 to 79 m@@ L / min ) must avoid simultaneous intake of non@@ ster@@ o@@ idal anti @-@ ph@@ log@@ is@@ tika ( N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds ) for at least 2 days prior to therapy .
&quot; all patients , intended for treatment with emet@@ ry , must avoid taking N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds with long half @-@ life for at least 5 days prior to therapy , day of therapy and at least 2 days after the therapy with P@@ emet@@ ry ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; many patients in which these events occurred had appropriate risk factors for the occurrence of ren@@ al events , including de@@ hydr@@ ation , pre @-@ existing hyper@@ tension or diabetes . &quot;
&quot; therefore , in patients with clin@@ ically significant liquid accumulation in the transc@@ ell@@ ular space , a drainage of the eff@@ ec@@ tivity before the P@@ emet@@ ric treatment should be weigh@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; 5 heavy cardiovascular events , including m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction , and cer@@ eb@@ rov@@ ascular events were reported in clinical trials involving P@@ emet@@ ry occasionally , when this drug was usually administered in combination with another cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic substance . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , simultaneous application of s@@ lat@@ ted liver vacc@@ ines ( except yellow fever , this vacc@@ ination is contra@@ indicated ) is not recommended ( see section 4.3 and 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; since the possibility of an ir@@ reversible skull of reproductive capacity is made by P@@ emet@@ ry , men should be pointed out before the treatment - G@@ inn insi@@ sting on providing advice regarding the sper@@ mat@@ o@@ zo@@ ology . &quot;
&quot; in patients with normal ren@@ al function ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance ≥ 80 ml / min ) high doses of non@@ ster@@ o@@ idal anti @-@ ph@@ log@@ is@@ tika ( N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds , such as i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen &gt; 1600 mg / day ) and acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid in high dosage ( ≥ 1,3 g daily ) lead to a reduced incidence of side effects . &quot;
therefore caution is advised if in patients with normal kidney function ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance ≥ 80 ml / min ) high doses of N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds or A@@ ce@@ - t@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid are applied in high dosage .
&quot; i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ) or acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ yl@@ - acid in high dosage for at least 2 days before the therapy , on the day of therapy and minim@@ ization , should be avoided 2 days after the therapy with P@@ emet@@ ry ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; since no data is available with regard to the interaction potential with N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds with long half @-@ time as pi@@ ro@@ - x@@ ic@@ am or ro@@ fec@@ oxi@@ b , simultaneous application must be avoided at least 5 days prior to therapy , day of therapy and at least 2 days after the therapy with P@@ emet@@ re@@ - xed . &quot;
the great in@@ tra @-@ individual vari@@ ability of the co@@ ag@@ ulation status during the disease and the possibility of interactions between oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants and ant@@ ine@@ oplas@@ tic chemotherapy requires an increased monitoring frequency of the IN@@ R ( International Norm@@ alised R@@ atio ) when the decision was made to treat the patient with oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants .
&quot; there are no data for the use of P@@ emet@@ ry in pregnant women , but as with an@@ de@@ - and anti @-@ fung@@ al paras@@ ites , severe birth defects are expected during pregnancy . &quot;
&quot; P@@ emet@@ ry can not be used during pregnancy , except if necessary and after careful weighing of the benefits for the mother and the risk for the fet@@ us ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; since the possibility of an ir@@ reversible damage to the reproductive capacity is made by P@@ emet@@ ry , men should be advised before the beginning of the treatment to obtain advice regarding the locking of the sperm . &quot;
it is not known whether P@@ emet@@ re@@ mixed leaves to the mother &apos;s milk and unwanted effects on the embroi@@ dered inf@@ ant cannot be ruled out .
the following table shows the frequency and sever@@ ity of adverse effects reported in &gt; 5 % of 168 patients with mes@@ othel@@ i@@ oma and were random@@ ised cis@@ pl@@ atin and P@@ emet@@ ric and were random@@ ised to receive cis@@ pl@@ atin as mon@@ otherapy .

&quot; AL@@ IM@@ TA ( P@@ emet@@ ry ) is an ant@@ ine@@ oplas@@ tic anti@@ fol@@ ate , which exercises its effect by inter@@ rup@@ ting important metabolic processes necessary for cell rep@@ lication . &quot;
&quot; in vitro studies showed that P@@ emet@@ re@@ mixed acts as an anti@@ fol@@ ate with several attack points by blocking the thy@@ me dy@@ lat@@ syn@@ th@@ ase ( TS ) , D@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ fol@@ at@@ reduc@@ t@@ ase ( D@@ H@@ FR ) and gly@@ cin@@ am@@ i@@ dri@@ bon@@ u@@ cle@@ ot@@ id@@ for@@ - my@@ l@@ transfer@@ ase ( GAR@@ FT ) , which are fol@@ ate @-@ dependent key enzymes of the de nov@@ o bi@@ os@@ yn@@ thesis of thy@@ mid@@ - and Pur@@ inn@@ u@@ cle@@ oti@@ des . &quot;
&quot; EMP@@ H@@ AC@@ IS , a multi @-@ centr@@ alised , random@@ ised , simple @-@ blind phase 3 study by AL@@ IM@@ TA plus cis@@ pl@@ atin against cis@@ pl@@ atin for chem@@ on@@ ai@@ ven patients with mal@@ ign@@ ant Ple@@ ur@@ am@@ es@@ othel@@ i@@ oma showed that with AL@@ IM@@ TA and cis@@ pl@@ atin patients treated a clin@@ ically significant advantage of a survival of a medi@@ an 2.8 @-@ month survival compared to those patients , which were just d@@ elt with cis@@ pl@@ atin . &quot;
the primary analysis of this study was carried out in the population of all patients receiving test medication in the treatment arm ( random@@ ised and treated ) .
a statisti@@ cally significant improvement of clin@@ ically relevant symptoms ( pain and dy@@ sp@@ nea ) in connection with the mal@@ ign@@ ant ple@@ ur@@ am@@ es@@ othel@@ i@@ om was shown in the AL@@ IM@@ TA / cis@@ pl@@ atin arm ( 212 patients ) compared to the sole Cis@@ pl@@ a tin arm ( 218 patients ) .
the differences between the two arms showed an improvement in the lung function parameters in AL@@ IM@@ TA / Cis@@ pl@@ atin arm and a deteri@@ oration of lung function over time in the control room .
&quot; a multi @-@ centr@@ alised , random@@ ised , open Phase III study with AL@@ IM@@ TA against doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el in patients with locally advanced or metastatic N@@ SC@@ LC in patients treated with AL@@ IM@@ TA treated patients ( Int@@ ent to treat population n = 283 ) and from 7,@@ 9 months with doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el treated patients ( IT@@ T n = 288 ) . &quot;

&quot; limited data of a separately random@@ ized , controlled Phase 3 study shows that efficacy data ( survival and progression @-@ free survival ) for emet@@ ry between patients with ( n = 41 ) and without ( n = 540 ) pre@@ treatment are similar to doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el . &quot;
the efficacy analyses of the P@@ Q population are consistent with the analyses of the IT@@ T Population and support the non @-@ inf@@ eri@@ ority of the AL@@ IM@@ TA Cis@@ pl@@ atin combination versus gem@@ cit@@ ab@@ ine cis@@ pl@@ atin combination .

the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of P@@ emet@@ ry after having been diagnosed as a mono@@ cl@@ ine were examined in 426 cancer patients with various solid tum@@ ours in doses of 0.2 to 8@@ 38 mg / m ² in in@@ fu@@ si@@ - zones over a period of 10 minutes .
&quot; P@@ emet@@ ry is mainly ex@@ cre@@ ted in the urine , and 70 % to 90 % of the administered dose will be found again within 24 hours of the application in the urine . &quot;
&quot; P@@ emet@@ ry mixed has a total of 9@@ 1.8 ml / min and the half @-@ life time in plasma is 3,5 hours in patients with normal kidney function ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance 90 ml / min ) . &quot;

it is applied in case of over@@ weight adults with a body mass index ( Body Mass Index - BM@@ I ) of ≥ 28 kg per square meter in combination with a low @-@ cal@@ orie low @-@ fat diet .
patients who take All@@ i take no weight after 12 weeks should contact their doctor or pharmac@@ ist .
&quot; these enzymes are inhi@@ bited , they can &apos;t remove some fats in the food , thus causing about a quarter of the fats fed with food in@@ gest@@ ed the intest@@ ines . &quot;
&quot; in a third study , All@@ i was compared to plac@@ ebo in 391 survi@@ ving patients with a BM@@ I between 25 and 28 kg / m2 . &quot;
&quot; in the two studies of patients with a BM@@ I of ≥ 28 kg / m2 , patients who received an average weight loss of 4.8 kg after one year had an average weight loss of 4.8 kg , compared to 2.3 kg while taking plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in the study with All@@ i in patients with a BM@@ I between 25 and 28 kg / m2 , none could be observed for patients of relevant weight loss . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of All@@ i ( observed with more than 1 out of 10 patients ) are o@@ ily spots on after , flat@@ us ( win@@ ch ) with stu@@ h@@ lab@@ y , stu@@ h@@ ld@@ rang , o@@ ily / o@@ ily chair , finish o@@ ily secre@@ tion ( rot ) , flat ul@@ enz ( win@@ ch ) and soft chairs . &quot;
it must not be used in patients treated with C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( to prevent organ rejection of transplan@@ t patients ) or with medicines such as war@@ far@@ in to prevent blood cl@@ ots .
&quot; it may also not be used in patients suffering from a long @-@ term mal@@ absorption syndrome ( not enough nutrients from the diges@@ tive tract ) or chol@@ est@@ ase ( liver disease ) , and in pregnant or breast@@ feeding mothers . &quot;
&quot; in July 2007 , the European Commission issued a permit to the company Gla@@ x@@ o Group Limited for placing or@@ list@@ at G@@ SK throughout the European Union . &quot;
&quot; all@@ i is indicated for weight reduction of adults with over@@ weight ( Body @-@ Mass @-@ Index BM@@ I ≥ 28 kg / m2 ) and should be used in conjunction with a slightly hypo@@ kal@@ oric , low @-@ fat diet . &quot;
&quot; all@@ i must not be used by children and adolescents under 18 , as insufficient data is available for efficacy and safety . &quot;
&quot; however , as or@@ list@@ at is only minim@@ ized , in elderly and in patients with reduced liver and / or kidney function no adjustment of the dosage is necessary . &quot;
• hyper@@ sensitivity to the active ingredient or any of the other ingredients • Pre@@ mature treatment with C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( see section 4.5 ) • Sti@@ ll time ( see section 4.6 ) • Nur@@ sing time ( see section 4.6 ) • Pre@@ mature treatment with war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants ( see Sec@@ tions 4.5 and 4.8 )
the lik@@ el@@ ihood of occurrence of g@@ astro@@ intestinal symptoms ( see section 4.8 ) may increase if all@@ i is taken together with a fat @-@ rich single meal or fat @-@ rich diet .
&quot; as the weight reduction in diabetes can be accompanied by an improved metabolic control , patients who take a medicine against diabetes should consult a doctor or pharmac@@ ist before the beginning of a therapy with all@@ i , because the dosage of the anti@@ di@@ ab@@ etic should be adjusted if necessary . &quot;
patients who take all@@ i as well as medicines for high blood pressure or elevated cholesterol should consult their doctor or pharmac@@ ist if the dosage of these drugs needs to be adjusted .
&quot; it is recommended to take additional thres@@ holds @-@ prevention measures , in order to prevent the possible failure of the oral contra@@ ception in the case of severe di@@ arr@@ ho@@ ea ( see Section 4.5 ) . &quot;
both in a study on the interaction of drugs as well as in several cases with simultaneous use of or@@ list@@ at and C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in a reduction of the c@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in plasma was observed .
&quot; in the use of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants in combination with or@@ list@@ at , the Quick @-@ Values ( international norm@@ alised ratio , IN@@ R ) could be affected ( see section 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; most patients who were treated with or@@ list@@ at in clinical trials up to 4 full years remained the concentrations of vitamins A , D , E and K as well as beta car@@ ot@@ ins in the normal range . &quot;
&quot; however , patients should be advised to take a complementary mul@@ tiv@@ it@@ amin supplement before bed@@ time to ensure sufficient vitamin consumption ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; after receiving a single dose A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ on , a limited number of healthy volunteers , which at the same time received or@@ list@@ at , was observed a minor decrease in the A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ on plasma concentration . &quot;
&quot; studies showed no direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see Section 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; the side effects of or@@ list@@ at are mainly g@@ astro@@ intestinal nature and are related to pharmac@@ ological effects of the drug , as absorption of recorded fat is prevented . &quot;
the g@@ astro@@ intestinal side effects were determined from clinical trials with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg for a duration of 18 months to 2 years and were generally mild and temporary .
&quot; the frequency are defined as follows : very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , common ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ) and very rare ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) , not known ( frequency based on available data is not estimated ) . &quot;
&quot; the incidence of known side effects identified after the market launch of or@@ list@@ at is not known , as these events were voluntarily reported by a population of un@@ certain size . &quot;
† It is plau@@ sible that treatment with allergy can lead to possible or actual g@@ astro@@ intestinal side effects .
&quot; single doses of 800 mg of or@@ list@@ at and multiple doses of up to 400 mg three times a day were administered to norm@@ al@@ ge@@ al and over@@ weight subjects , without significant clinical findings . &quot;
&quot; in the majority of cases reported after the market introduction , either side effects or similar side effects were reported as reported at the recommended dose of or@@ list@@ at . &quot;
&quot; based on research on humans and animals , it can be assumed from a fast rep@@ lication of any system@@ ic effects caused by the li@@ abilities of or@@ list@@ at . &quot;
the therapeutic effect places in the l@@ umen of the stomach and the upper small intest@@ ine by co@@ valent bond to the active ser@@ um rest of ga@@ str@@ ic and p@@ ank@@ re@@ atic li@@ abilities .
&quot; clinical studies have been derived that 60 mg of or@@ list@@ at , taken three times a day , blocks the absorption of about 25 % of the food fat . &quot;
&quot; two double @-@ blind , random@@ ised , plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled studies in adults with a BM@@ I ≥ 28 kg / m2 demonstrate the efficacy of 60 mg of or@@ list@@ at , which was taken three times a day in combination with a hypo@@ kal@@ oric , fatty acid diet . &quot;
&quot; the primary parameter , the change of body weight compared to the initial value ( at the time of random@@ isation ) , has been evaluated as follows : as a change in body weight in the course of study ( table 1 ) and as part of the study participants who have lost more than 5 % or more than 10 % of their initial weight ( Table 2 ) . &quot;
&quot; although in both studies the weight reduction was observed over 12 months , the greatest weight loss occurred in the first 6 months . &quot;
the average change in Gesamt@@ cholester@@ in was with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg -@@ 2.4 % ( initial value 5,@@ 20 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and with plac@@ ebo + 2.8 % ( initial value 5,@@ 26 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) . &quot;
the average change in L@@ DL cholesterol was with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg -@@ 3.5 % ( initial value 3.@@ 30 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and with plac@@ ebo + 3.8 % ( initial value 3.@@ 41 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
&quot; during wa@@ ist circum@@ ference , the average change -@@ 4.5 cm with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg ( starting value 10@@ 3.7 cm ) and with plac@@ ebo -@@ 3.6 cm ( output value 10@@ 3.5 cm ) . &quot;
plasma concentrations of non met@@ ab@@ oli@@ zed or@@ list@@ at were not meas@@ urable 8 hours after the oral gift of 360 mg or@@ list@@ at ( &lt; 5 ng / ml ) .
&quot; 7 In general , with therapeutic doses not met@@ ab@@ oli@@ zed or@@ list@@ at in plasma could be detected only spor@@ adi@@ cally and in extremely low concentrations ( &lt; 10 ng / ml or 0.0@@ 2 µ@@ mo@@ l ) and without signs of cum@@ ulation . &quot;
&quot; in a study with adi@@ p@@ ous patients , which administered the minimal system@@ ically res@@ or@@ inated dosage , two main metabol@@ ites could be identified , namely M1 ( in position 4 hydro@@ ly@@ sed Lac@@ ton@@ ring ) and M3 ( M1 after spl@@ itting the N @-@ For@@ my@@ l @-@ leu@@ cine group ) , which exhibited approximately 42 % of total plastic concentration . &quot;
&quot; based on conventional studies on safety har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated offering , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity , car@@ cin@@ ogen@@ ous potential and reproductive @-@ sto@@ ic@@ ity , the prec@@ lin@@ ical data are no special threat to human beings . &quot;

the most common side effects are associated with the mode of action of the capsules and thereby develop that more fat is ex@@ cre@@ ted out of the body .
&quot; these side effects usually occur within the first few weeks after the beginning of the treatment , since at this time you may not have reduced the fat content in your diet . &quot;
&quot; with the following basic rules you can learn to minimize nutritional issues : • Beg@@ inning a few days , or better a week before the first intake of capsules with a fat du@@ ed diet . • Learn more about the usual fat content of your favorite foods and about the size of portions that you normally take . &quot;
&quot; if you know exactly how much you eat , the lik@@ el@@ ihood that you exceed your fat limit decreases . • Share your recommended fat amount ev@@ enly on daily meals . &quot;
&quot; save the amount of calories and fat that you are allowed to take per meal , not to take them in the form of a fat @-@ rich main court or a lasting afternoon , as you may have done with other programs for weight reduction . &quot;
• The bottle contains two white sealed containers with si@@ lica gel that serve to keep the capsules dry .
do not swal@@ low it in any case . • You can carry your daily dose all@@ i in the blue transport box ( shuttle ) which is enclosed in this pack .

&quot; a permanent weight loss , for example by improving diet and more exercise , can prevent the emergence of serious diseases and has a positive impact on your health . &quot;
&quot; choose meals that contain a wide range of nutrients , and gradually learn to feed yourself healthy . &quot;
&quot; energy is also measured in kil@@ o@@ j@@ ou@@ les , which you can also find as an indication of the packaging of foods . • The recommended cal@@ orie intake indicates how many calories you should take maximum per day . &quot;
note the tables below . • The recommended fat intake in grams is the maximum amount of fat you should take with each meal .
&quot; if the amount of calories is suitable for you , please refer to the information below that indicates the number of calories that is suitable for you . &quot;
&quot; if you take the same amount of fat as before , this can mean that your body can &apos;t handle this amount of fat . &quot;
&quot; by keeping the recommended fat supply you can maxim@@ ize your weight loss while reducing the lik@@ el@@ ihood of diet @-@ related companion symptoms . • You should try , step @-@ by @-@ step and continuously . &quot;
&quot; 34 This decreased cal@@ orie intake should allow you to lose weight gradually and continuously approximately 0.5 kg per week , without frustr@@ ations and dis@@ appointments . &quot;
&quot; the more active you are , the higher your recommended cal@@ orie intake . • &quot; &quot; Low physical activity &quot; &quot; means that you can work only little or at all , work in the garden or perform other physical activities . • &quot; Middle physical activity &quot; means that by moving daily 150 k@@ cal , i.e. by 3 km walking , 30@@ - to 45 @-@ minute gardening or 2 km running in 15 minutes . &quot;
&quot; • For a permanent weight loss , it is necessary to set up realistic cal@@ orie and fat targets and to keep it in . • If you are looking to move more before you start taking all@@ i . &quot;
&quot; the all@@ i program to support weight loss combines the capsules with a nutritional plan and a large number of other information materials that can help you to feed cal@@ orie and gre@@ asy , and give guidelines to become physically active . &quot;
&quot; in combination with a program tailored to your type , you can help you develop health@@ ier lifestyle and achieve your target weight . &quot;
&quot; Alo@@ xi is used in chem@@ otherap@@ ies , the strong trigger for nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting ( like cis@@ pl@@ atin ) , as well as in chem@@ otherap@@ ies , which are regular trig@@ gers for nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting ( like cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide , do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in or car@@ b@@ op@@ l@@ atin ) . &quot;
the effectiveness of Alo@@ xi can be increased by the additional administration of a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids ( a drug that can be used as an anti @-@ em@@ etic medication ) .
the use in patients under 18 years of age is not recommended as to the effects in this age group do not have enough information .
&quot; this means that the active ingredient prevents the binding of a chemical substance in the body , 5 hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin ( 5@@ HT , also known as ser@@ oton@@ in ) , to the recept@@ ors in the intest@@ ines . &quot;
&quot; Alo@@ xi was studied in three main studies at 1 842 adults who received chemotherapy regim@@ ens , which are strong or moderate trigger for nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting . &quot;
&quot; chem@@ otherap@@ ies , the strong trigger for nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting , showed 59 % of patients treated with Alo@@ xi in 24 hours after chemotherapy ( 132 of 223 ) , compared to 57 % of patients treated with on@@ dan@@ set@@ ron ( 126 of 221 ) . &quot;
&quot; chem@@ otherap@@ ies , the moderate trigger for nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting , showed 81 % of patients treated with Alo@@ xi in 24 hours after chemotherapy ( 153 of 189 ) , compared to 69 % of patients treated with on@@ dan@@ set@@ ron ( 127 of 185 ) . &quot;
in a comparison with Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron these values were 63 % for Alo@@ xi ( 119 of 189 patients ) and 53 % for Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron ( 101 out of 191 patients ) .
&quot; in March 2005 , the European Commission issued a permit to the company Helsinki Bi@@ rex Pharmaceuticals Ltd . approval for the transport of Alo@@ xi throughout the European Union . &quot;
&quot; Alo@@ xi is indicated : for prevention of acute nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting with highly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy , due to a cancer disease and for prevention of nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting in moder@@ ately em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy based on cancer . &quot;
&quot; the efficacy of Alo@@ xi to prevent nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting , induced by a strongly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy , can be ampli@@ fied by adding a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids given before chemotherapy . &quot;
&quot; since Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can pro@@ long the col@@ on massage , patients should be closely monitored with an@@ am@@ nes@@ ian ob@@ sti@@ p@@ ation or signs of a sub@@ acute I@@ le@@ us after injection . &quot;
&quot; however , as with other 5@@ HT@@ 3 antagon@@ ists , caution is advised in simultaneous offering of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron with medicines that extend the Q@@ T interval or in patients with which the Q@@ t interval is extended or that tend to such an extension . &quot;
&quot; in addition to a further chemotherapy regim@@ en , Alo@@ xi is not intended to be used in the days after chemotherapy or to treat nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting . &quot;
&quot; in prec@@ lin@@ ical studies Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron inhi@@ bited the activity of the five chem@@ otherap@@ ists investigated against tum@@ ours ( cis@@ pl@@ atin , cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide , cy@@ tar@@ ab@@ ine , do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in and mit@@ om@@ y@@ cin C ) . &quot;
&quot; a clinical trial showed no significant pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic interactions between a unique intra@@ ven@@ ous dose of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron and a steady @-@ stat@@ e- concentration of oral met@@ oc@@ lo@@ pr@@ am@@ ids , a C@@ YP@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ or . &quot;
&quot; in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic analysis based on a population , the simultaneous offering of C@@ YP@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 induc@@ tors ( dex@@ am@@ eth@@ as@@ one and ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ) and C@@ YP@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ ors ( A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ on , chlor@@ pro@@ ma@@ z@@ ine , hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol , par@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol , par@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , Ser@@ tr@@ alin and Ter@@ bin@@ af@@ in ) had no significant effect on the Clear@@ ance of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron . &quot;
&quot; experience of using Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in human pregn@@ ancies are not present , so Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron should not be applied in pregnant women unless it is deemed necessary by the doctor to be treated . &quot;
&quot; clinical trials were the most common adverse events with a dose of 250 micro@@ grams ( a total of 6@@ 33 patients ) , which at least possibly with Alo@@ xi were related to head@@ aches ( 9 % ) and ob@@ sti@@ p@@ ation ( 5 % ) . &quot;
&quot; very rare cases ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) of hyper@@ sensitivity reactions and reactions at the meeting place ( burning , har@@ dening , dis@@ comfort and pain ) were stated in post @-@ marketing experiences . &quot;
in the group with the highest dosage there were similar pre@@ valence of adverse events as in the other dos@@ ages ; there were no correlation of drugs to be observed .
&quot; no di@@ aly@@ sis studies have been carried out , however , due to the large distribution volume , a di@@ aly@@ sis is probably not effective therapy with an Alo@@ xi@@ - over@@ dosage . &quot;
&quot; in two random@@ ised double @-@ blind studies , a total of 1,@@ 132 patients receiving moder@@ ately em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy with ≤ 50 mg / m2 cyclo@@ pl@@ atin , ≤ 1,500 mg / m2 Cy@@ clo@@ phosph@@ amide and &gt; 25 mg / m2 do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in and 250 micro@@ grams or 100 mg Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron ( half @-@ value 7.3 hours ) were given intra@@ ven@@ ously in day 1 without D@@ exam@@ eth@@ as@@ one . &quot;
&quot; in a random@@ ized double @-@ blind study , 667 patients who received a highly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy with ≥ 60 mg / m2@@ cis@@ pl@@ atin , &gt; 1,500 mg / m2 cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide and Dac@@ ar@@ b@@ az@@ in and 250 or 750 micro@@ gram Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron were compared to patients receiving 32 mg on@@ dan@@ set@@ ron , which were given intra@@ ven@@ ously every day . &quot;
results of studies with moder@@ ately em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy and the study with highly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy are summar@@ ized in the following tables .
&quot; in clinical trials for indication chemotherapy @-@ induced nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting ( C@@ IN@@ V ) , the effects of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron on blood pressure , heart rate and EC@@ G parameters , including the Q@@ t@@ c interval , were comparable with the corresponding effects of On@@ dan@@ set@@ ron and Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron . &quot;
&quot; according to clinical studies , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron has the ability to block the ion channels involved in the v@@ entri@@ cular de@@ - and rep@@ ol@@ ar@@ isation and extend the duration of the action potential . &quot;
&quot; the aim of the study conducted at 221 healthy volunteers was the assessment of the EC@@ G effects of i.@@ v. administered Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in single doses of 0,25 , 0.@@ 75 and 2.@@ 25 mg . &quot;
res@@ or@@ ption After intra@@ ven@@ ous gift follows an initial decrease in plasma concentrations a slow elimination of the body with an average terminal half of about 40 hours .
the average maximum plasma concentration ( C@@ MA@@ x ) and the area below the concentration @-@ time curve ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) are generally proportional to the entire dose range of 0.@@ 3- 90 μ g / kg for healthy and cancer patients dos@@ is@@ proportional .
&quot; after intra@@ ven@@ ous administration of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron 0,25 mg every second day for a total of 3 doses , the mean mean ( ± SD ) was measured at 11 tes@@ tic@@ ular car@@ cin@@ oma patients between day 1 and day 5 ± 34 % . &quot;
&quot; pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic simul@@ ations indicate that at once daily intra@@ ven@@ ous administration of 0.25 mg pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron reached 3 consecutive days , total tex@@ tual position ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) was comparable with the value measured after one @-@ time intra@@ ven@@ ous administration of 0.@@ 75 mg . however , the C@@ MA@@ x was higher after the one @-@ off of 0.@@ 75 mg higher . &quot;
&quot; about 40 % are eliminated through the kid@@ neys , and approximately another 50 % are converted into two primary metabol@@ ites , which in comparison to Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron have less than 1 % of the antagon@@ istic effect on the 5@@ HT@@ 3 recep@@ tor . &quot;
&quot; in vitro studies on metabol@@ isation have shown that C@@ YP@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and , in lesser degree , are involved in Met@@ abol@@ ism by Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron . &quot;
&quot; elimination After an intra@@ ven@@ ous single dose of 10 micro@@ grams / kg &#91; 14@@ C &#93; -@@ pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron , approximately 80 % of the dose was found within 144 hours in urine , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron as unchanged ingredient made about 40 % of the given dose . &quot;
&quot; after a unique intra@@ ven@@ ous stu@@ d injection , the total body @-@ length was 173 ± 73 ml / min and the ren@@ al clearing 53 ± 29 ml / min . &quot;
&quot; although in patients with severe liver dysfunction , the terminal elimination of elimination and the average system@@ ic exposure to Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron are increased , but a reduction in the dose is therefore not justified . &quot;
&quot; in prec@@ lin@@ ical studies , effects were observed only after expos@@ ures , which are considered sufficient over the maximum human therapeutic exposure , suggest@@ ing a low relevance for clinical use . &quot;
&quot; 10 out of prec@@ lin@@ ical studies , indications were that Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can only block I@@ on@@ ary channels in very high concentrations , which are involved in the v@@ entri@@ cular de@@ - and rep@@ ol@@ ar@@ isation and pro@@ long the term of action . &quot;
&quot; doses of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron ( each dose correspon@@ ded in about the 30 @-@ fold of therapeutic exposure to humans ) , which were given daily over two years , led to an increased incidence of liver tum@@ ours , en@@ doc@@ rine ne@@ oplas@@ ms ( in thy@@ roid gland , p@@ itu@@ itary , pancre@@ as , adren@@ al mark ) and skin tum@@ ors in rats , but not mice . &quot;
&quot; the underlying mechanisms are not completely known , but due to the high dos@@ ages used and since Alo@@ xi is intended for a unique application , the relevance of these results is estimated to be low for humans . &quot;
the owner of this permit for placing on the market must inform the European Commission on the plans for the transport of the drug approved as part of this decision .

&quot; in June 2006 , the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) adopted a negative opinion in which the approval of the drug prescribed for the treatment of hepatitis C was recommended by Al@@ ph@@ eon 6 million IE / ml injection solution . &quot;
&quot; this means that Al@@ ph@@ eon should resem@@ ble a biological medicine called Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A with the same drug effective component , which is already approved in the EU ( also called &quot; &quot; reference doctors &quot; &quot; ) . &quot;
Al@@ ph@@ eon should be used to treat adult patients with chronic ( long @-@ lasting ) hepatitis C ( a liver disease caused by viral infection ) .
&quot; in micro@@ sc@@ opic analysis , liver tissue damage causes damage , and the values of the liver enzymes Alan@@ ine Amin@@ ot@@ ran@@ s@@ fer@@ ase ( AL@@ T ) are increased in the blood ab@@ normal . &quot;
&quot; it is produced by a yeast in which a gene ( DNA ) was introduced , which stimul@@ ates it to the formation of the active substance . &quot;
&quot; the manufacturer of Al@@ ph@@ eon presented data that demonstrate the comparison of Al@@ ph@@ eon with Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A ( substance structure , composition and purity of the drug , mode of action , safety and efficacy in hepatitis C ) . &quot;
&quot; in the study of hepatitis C patients , the efficacy of Al@@ ph@@ eon was compared with the effectiveness of the reference doctor to 455 patients . &quot;
the study measured how many patients after 12 of a total of 48 weeks of treatment and 6 months after the treatment had been treated to the medicine ( i.e. no signs of virus found in the blood ) .

&quot; in addition , concerns were expressed that the data on the stability of the drug and the drug to be marketed will not suff@@ ice . &quot;
the number of patients with hepatitis C that responded to treatment with Al@@ ph@@ eon and Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A was similar in clinical trial .
&quot; after adjusting the treatment with Al@@ ph@@ eon , the disease ret@@ ard@@ ated with more patients than the reference doctor ; in addition , Al@@ ph@@ eon had more side effects . &quot;
&quot; apart from this , the test used in the study to investigate the question , to what extent the drug forms an immune response ( i.e. the body forms antibodies - special proteins - against the drug ) , not sufficiently vali@@ dated . &quot;
&quot; it can be used to treat Im@@ pe@@ tig@@ o ( a skin infection associated with cr@@ ust formation ) and small infected Laz@@ er@@ ations ( crack or cutting wounds ) , abra@@ sions and stit@@ ched wounds . &quot;
Al@@ tar@@ go should not be used to treat infections which have been proven or presum@@ ably caused by meth@@ ic@@ il@@ lin@@ Resistance Stap@@ hy@@ lo@@ co@@ cc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) because Al@@ ar@@ go could not counter@@ act this type of infections .
&quot; Al@@ tar@@ go can be applied in patients from the age of nine months , but patients under 18 years of age may not be more than 2 % of the body surface . &quot;
&quot; if the patient does not respond to treatment after two or three days , the doctor should examine the patient again and consider alternative treatments . &quot;
blocking the bacterial ri@@ bos@@ omes ( the parts of the bacterial cell where proteins are produced ) and thereby inhi@@ bits the growth of the bacteria .
the main indicator of efficacy was in all five studies the proportion of patients whose infection was clari@@ fied after the end of the treatment .
119 ( 8@@ 5.6 % ) of 139 patients under Al@@ tar@@ go and 37 ( 5@@ 2.1 % ) of 71 patients under plac@@ ebo responded to treatment .
&quot; in the treatment of infected skin @-@ eyes , Al@@ tar@@ go and C@@ ef@@ al@@ ex@@ in showed similar response rates : when the results of both studies were taken together at Hau@@ tw@@ ound , approximately 90 % of the patients of both groups responded to treatment . &quot;
&quot; however , in these two studies , however , Al@@ tar@@ go was not effective in the treatment of ab@@ sc@@ esses ( egg @-@ filled c@@ avi@@ ties in the body tissues ) or of infections caused by MR@@ SA . &quot;
the most common side effect with Al@@ tar@@ go ( which was observed from 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) is a irrit@@ ation to the Con@@ tractor .
&quot; the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of Al@@ tar@@ go weigh the following super@@ ficial skin infections over the risks : • Im@@ pe@@ tig@@ o , • infected little la@@ fir@@ s , abra@@ sions , or se@@ wn wounds . &quot;
&quot; in May 2007 , the European Commission issued a permit for the company Gla@@ x@@ o Group Ltd . approval for the launch of Al@@ tar@@ go throughout the European Union . &quot;
patients with no improvement within two or three days should be examined and an alternative therapy should be considered ( see section 4.4 ) .
&quot; in the event of sensi@@ tiz@@ ing or serious local irrit@@ ation by applying Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be , treatment is ab@@ orted , the o@@ int@@ ment must be carefully wi@@ ped out and an appropriate alternative therapy of the infection will commen@@ ce . &quot;
retin@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin should not be used to treat infections in which MR@@ SA is known as a path@@ ogen or is suspected ( see section 5.1 ) .
the efficacy of retin@@ os@@ ulin in patients with infections caused by a meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in @-@ resistant Stap@@ hy@@ lo@@ co@@ cc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) was insufficient .
an alternative therapy should be considered if after a 2- or 3 @-@ day treatment no improvement or deteri@@ oration of the infected area occurs .
the effect of simultaneous use of retin@@ os@@ ulin and other top@@ ical remedies on the same skin surface is not examined and the simultaneous use of other top@@ ical drugs is not recommended .
&quot; due to the low plas@@ ticity concentrations , which were achieved by people after top@@ ical application on scrat@@ ched skin or infected surface wounds , a clin@@ ically relevant in@@ hibition in vi@@ vo is not expected ( see section 5.2 ) . &quot;
3 After concur@@ rent oral gift of 2 times a day 200 mg k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole increased the mean Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) and C@@ MA@@ x after top@@ ical application of 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be on S@@ cra@@ cked skin of healthy adult men by 81 % .
&quot; due to the low system@@ ic exposure to the top@@ ical application in patients dose adap@@ tations are not considered necessary , when top@@ ical ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ines are used during system@@ ic treatment with C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors . &quot;
animal studies have shown a reproductive @-@ sto@@ ic@@ ity after oral intake and are insufficient in regards to a statement regarding the birth and the associated / post@@ nat@@ al development ( see Section 5.3 ) .
retin@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be should only be applied during pregnancy if a top@@ ical anti@@ bacterial therapy is clearly indicated and the application of retin@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is prefer@@ able to the gift of a system@@ ic antibiotic .
&quot; in deciding whether breast@@ feeding continues / termin@@ ate or the therapy with Al@@ tar@@ go should be continued / termin@@ ated , the benefits of breast@@ feeding for the inf@@ ant and the benefit of the Al@@ tar@@ go therapy should be weak@@ ened for the woman . &quot;
&quot; clinical trials involving 2@@ 150 patients with super@@ ficial skin infections , which Al@@ tar@@ go used , was the most common adverse side effect Ir@@ rit@@ ation at the appointment ort , which concerned about 1 % of the patients . &quot;
&quot; mode of action retin@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is a semi @-@ synthetic deri@@ v@@ ative of P@@ leu@@ ro@@ mu@@ ti@@ lin , a substance produced by fermentation from C@@ lit@@ op@@ il@@ us pass@@ eck@@ eri@@ anus ( formerly Ple@@ ur@@ ot@@ us pass@@ eck@@ eri@@ anus ) . &quot;
&quot; the active mechanism of retin@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is based on selective inhibit@@ ing of bacterial protein synthesis by interaction with a certain binding site of the 50@@ S sub@@ unit of the bacterial ri@@ bos@@ ome , which differs from the binding places of other ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al inter@@ acting anti@@ bacterial substances . &quot;
data suggest that the Bin@@ der@@ stelle ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al Protein L@@ 3 is involved and lies in the region of the ri@@ bos@@ om P @-@ Bin@@ dungs@@ stelle and the Pep@@ ti@@ dy@@ l@@ transfer@@ ase centre .
&quot; by joining this binding site , P@@ leu@@ ro@@ mu@@ ti@@ line inhi@@ bits the Pep@@ ti@@ dy@@ l@@ transfer , block partial P @-@ binding interactions and prevent normal formation of active 50@@ S ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al sub@@ units . &quot;
&quot; due to the local pre@@ valence of resistance , the use of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ines in at least some infection forms should be considered , a consultation should be sought by experts . &quot;
&quot; no differences in the in @-@ vitro activity of retin@@ os@@ ulin opposite S.@@ au@@ re@@ us were detected , regardless of whether the isol@@ ates were sensitive or resistant to meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in . &quot;
in case of failure to treat S.@@ au@@ re@@ us the presence of trun@@ ks with additional vir@@ ul@@ ence factors ( such as PV@@ L = Pant@@ on @-@ Valent@@ ine Leu@@ co@@ ci@@ din ) should be considered .
res@@ or@@ ption In a study with healthy adults 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be was applied daily under occ@@ lu@@ sion on intact and s@@ wollen skin for up to 7 days .
&quot; of 516 patients ( adults and children ) , who received 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be twice daily for 5 days for the top@@ ical treatment of secondary infected traumatic wounds , single plas@@ map@@ ro@@ bes were obtained . &quot;
the sampling occurred on days 3 or 4 in the adult patients before medi@@ ation and in children between 0 @-@ 12 hours after the last application .
&quot; however , the maximum individual system@@ ic intake of people after top@@ ical application of 1 % o@@ int@@ ment to 200 c@@ m2 was reduced to 200 c@@ m2 ( C@@ MA@@ x = 22 ng / ml ; AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) = 238 ng · h / ml ) 660 times lower than the ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin IC@@ 50 for P@@ GP in@@ hibition . &quot;
metabolism The in vitro oxid@@ ative metabol@@ ism of retin@@ os@@ ulin in human liver micro@@ som@@ es was primarily medi@@ ated by C@@ YP@@ 2@@ C8 and C@@ YP@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 ( see section 4.5 ) .
&quot; in studies on the oral toxic@@ ity of rats ( 50 , 150 or 450 mg / kg ) , which were carried out over 14 days , there were signs of adap@@ tive liver and thy@@ roid changes . &quot;
in @-@ vitro testing on gene mut@@ ation and / or chromos@@ om@@ al effects in the mouse @-@ lymph@@ oma test or in cultures of human periph@@ eral blood lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes as well as in rats micro @-@ core test for in @-@ vi@@ vo analysis chromos@@ om@@ al effects .
&quot; there was neither male nor female rats signs of reduced fertility in oral doses of 50 , 150 or 450 mg / kg / day , whereby a up to 5 times higher exposure was achieved than the highest estimated exposure to humans ( top@@ ical application on 200 c@@ m2 ) : &quot;
&quot; in an embry@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity study at rats were observed in oral doses of ≥ 150 mg / kg / day ( according to ≥ 3 times the estimated human exposure ( see above ) ) , development sto@@ x@@ ic@@ ity ( reduced body weight of the fet@@ us and delayed os@@ si@@ fication ) and mat@@ ernal toxic@@ ity . &quot;
&quot; the owner of the authorisation for placing on the market must ensure that a pharmac@@ ovi@@ gil@@ ance system , as in the module 1.@@ 8.1 of the application , is present and works before the product is marketed and as long as the product is marketed . &quot;
&quot; the holder of the authorisation for the in@@ tranet is required to carry out detailed studies and additional pharmac@@ o@@ vig@@ il@@ ance activities in the pharmac@@ ovi@@ gil@@ ance plan , as described in version 1 of Risk Management Plan ( R@@ MP ) and all additional updates of the R@@ MP agreed with the CH@@ MP . &quot;
&quot; as described in CH@@ MP &quot; Gui@@ del@@ ine on Risk Management Systems for the products for human use , &quot; the updated R@@ MP is to be submitted simultaneously with the next Peri@@ odic Safety Update Report . &quot;
&quot; if irrit@@ ation or other signs and symptoms show at the treated area , you should quit the application of Al@@ tar@@ go and talk to your doctor . &quot;
&quot; do not use other o@@ int@@ ments , cre@@ ams or lot@@ ions on the surface that will be treated with Al@@ tar@@ go if it was not expressly ordered by your doctor . &quot;
&quot; it may not be applied in the eyes , in the mouth or on the lips , in the nose or in the female genital area . &quot;
&quot; if the o@@ int@@ ment is made from sight on one of these surfaces , wash the place with water and ask your doctor for advice if symptoms occur . &quot;
&quot; after applying the o@@ int@@ ment , you can cover the affected area with a sterile association or a gaz@@ ever@@ band unless your doctor has advised you to not cover the surface . &quot;
&quot; it is offered in an aluminium tube with a plastic closure that contains 5 , 10 or 15 grams of o@@ int@@ ment , or in an aluminium bag containing 0.5 g o@@ int@@ ment . &quot;
&quot; Ambi@@ rix is used to protect hepatitis A and hepatitis B ( diseases affecting the liver ) in children aged between 1 and 15 years , which are not immune to these two diseases . &quot;
&quot; Ambi@@ rix is used as part of a vacc@@ ination program consisting of two doses , whereby a protection against hepatitis B may be achieved only after the second dose is administered . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , Ambi@@ rix can only be used if there is a low risk of hepatitis B infection during imm@@ uni@@ zation and that the vacc@@ ination that consists of two cans can be brought to an end . &quot;
&quot; if a refres@@ her dose is desired against hepatitis A or B , Ambi@@ rix can be given or another hepatitis A or B vacc@@ ine . &quot;
&quot; vacc@@ ines act by contributing to the immune system ( the natural defense of the body ) , &quot; &quot; as it can defend against a disease . &quot;
&quot; after a child has received the vacc@@ ine , the immune system recognis@@ es viruses and surface anti@@ gens as &quot; alien &quot; and produces antibodies against it . &quot;
Ambi@@ rix contains the same constitu@@ ents as the vacc@@ ine Twin@@ rix grown since 1996 and the vacc@@ ine Twin@@ rix children since 1997 .
&quot; the three vacc@@ ines are used to protect against the same diseases , however , Twin@@ rix adults and Twin@@ rix children are administered as part of a vacc@@ ination that consists of three doses . &quot;
&quot; because Ambi@@ rix and Twin@@ rix adults contain identical ingredients , some of the data that support the application of Twin@@ rix adults were also used as evidence of the application of Ambi@@ rix . &quot;
the main indicator of the effectiveness was the portion of the vacc@@ inated children who had developed a protective antibody concentrations a month after the last injection .
&quot; in an additional study with 208 children , the efficacy of the vacc@@ ine was compared to six months and a 12 @-@ month gap between the two inj@@ ections . &quot;
&quot; in between 98 and 100 % of vacc@@ inated children , Ambi@@ rix resulted in a month after the last injection to develop protective antibodies against hepatitis A and B. &quot;
the additional study showed that the degree of protection of Ambi@@ rix was similar in a six @-@ month and a 12 @-@ month interval between the inj@@ ections .
&quot; the most common side effects of Ambi@@ rix ( observed with more than 1 of 10 vacc@@ ine doses ) are head@@ ache , appetite , pain at the injection point , red@@ ness , mat@@ ty ( ti@@ red@@ ness ) and irrit@@ ability . &quot;
&quot; Ambi@@ rix may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to the active ingredients , one of the other ingredients or ne@@ om@@ y@@ cin ( antibiotic ) . &quot;
August 2002 granted the European Commission to the company Gla@@ x@@ o@@ S@@ mith@@ K@@ line Biolog@@ icals s.@@ a. a permit for the placing of Ambi@@ rix in the whole
&quot; the standard vacc@@ ination for pri@@ ming with Ambi@@ rix consists of two vacc@@ ines , whereby the first dose is administered at the date of the choice and the second dose between six and twelve months after the first dose . &quot;
&quot; if vacc@@ ination vacc@@ ination is desired for both hepatitis A and hepatitis B , vacc@@ ines can be vacc@@ inated with the corresponding mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ent vacc@@ ines or with a combination vacc@@ ine . &quot;
the anti @-@ hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen ( anti @-@ H@@ B@@ s@@ A@@ g ) and anti @-@ hepatitis A virus ( anti @-@ H@@ AV ) antibodies are in the same size as after vacc@@ ination with the respective mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ent vacc@@ ines .
&quot; it is not yet fully assured , whether immun@@ o@@ competent individuals who have responded to hepatitis A vacc@@ ination may require a refres@@ her vacc@@ ination as they may also be protected with immun@@ ological memory even in no more det@@ ectable antibodies . &quot;
&quot; 3 As with all injection vacc@@ ines , adequate possibilities of medical treatment and monitoring should always be available for the rare case of an an@@ aphy@@ lac@@ tic reaction after the gift of the vacc@@ ine . &quot;
&quot; if a fast protection against hepatitis B is required , the standardi@@ zation scheme is recommended with the combination vacc@@ ine that contains 360 ELISA units form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated hepatitis A virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen . &quot;
&quot; in case of hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis patients and persons with dis@@ rup@@ tions of the immune system , under certain circumstances no sufficient anti @-@ HAV@@ - and anti @-@ H@@ b antibody level is achieved , so that in these cases the gift of additional vacc@@ ines may be required . &quot;
&quot; as an intra@@ der@@ mal injection or in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular administration in the glut@@ eal muscle could lead to a sub@@ optimal impact , these inj@@ ections should be avoided . &quot;
&quot; in case of th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ enia or blood cl@@ ot@@ ting disorders , however , Ambi@@ rix can be inj@@ ected exceptionally sub@@ cut@@ aneous , since in these cases it can occur after in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular gift to bleeding . &quot;
&quot; if Ambi@@ rix is given in the second year of life in the form of a separate injection , tet@@ an@@ us@@ - , az@@ ell@@ ular per@@ t@@ uss@@ i , ac@@ ell@@ ular per@@ t@@ uss@@ i , in@@ activated poli@@ omyel@@ i@@ tis@@ - and Ha@@ em@@ op@@ hil@@ us influ@@ enz@@ ae type b vacc@@ ine ( DT@@ PA @-@ IP@@ V / HI@@ B ) or with a combined ground m@@ umps @-@ rub@@ ella vacc@@ ine , the immune response to all anti@@ gens was sufficient ( see Section 5.1 ) . &quot;
patients with immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy or in patients with immune defects must be assumed that there may be no adequate immune response .
&quot; in a clinical study conducted with 3 vacc@@ ines of this formulation in adults , the incidence of pain , red@@ ness , swelling , mat@@ ty , g@@ astro@@ ent@@ eri@@ tis , head@@ aches and fever is comparable to the incidence observed in earlier thi@@ om@@ omer@@ sal@@ es- and preser@@ v@@ ative @-@ containing vacc@@ ine formulation . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials , 20@@ 29 vacc@@ ines Ambi@@ rix were administered to a total of 10@@ 27 vacc@@ ines at the age of 1 to including 15 years . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; only exceptions were the higher frequencies of pain and mat@@ ty on a calculation basis per vacc@@ ine Ambi@@ rix , but not on a basis of calculation per person . &quot;
&quot; pain was observed after the gift of Ambi@@ rix at 50.@@ 7 % of the subjects , compared with 39.@@ 1 % in subjects after the gift of a dose of 3 @-@ dose combination vacc@@ ine . &quot;
&quot; after the complete ino@@ cul@@ ation cycle , 6@@ 6,@@ 4 % of the subjects were given , over pain , compared to 6@@ 3.8 % among the subjects that had been vacc@@ inated with the 3 @-@ dose combination vacc@@ ine . &quot;
&quot; however , the frequency of mat@@ ty was comparable to per pro@@ band ( i.e. across the entire vacc@@ ine cycle at 39.@@ 6 % of the subjects who received Ambi@@ rix compared to 36.@@ 2 % in subjects who received the 3 @-@ dose combination vacc@@ ine ) . &quot;
the incidence of pronounced pain and mat@@ ernity was low and comparable to that observed after administration of the combination vacc@@ ine with the 3 @-@ dose vacc@@ ination scheme .
&quot; in a comparative study of 1- and 11 year old vacc@@ ines , the incidence of local reactions and general reactions in the Ambi@@ ri@@ x@@ Group was comparable to the hepatitis A virus and 10 µ@@ g of re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen . &quot;
&quot; however , in the 6- to 11 @-@ year @-@ olds , however , after vacc@@ ination with Ambi@@ rix a more frequent occurrence of pain ( at the injection rate ) per dose , not per pro@@ band , was reported . &quot;
&quot; the proportion of vacc@@ ines caused by severe side effects during the 2 @-@ dose vacc@@ ine with Ambi@@ rix , or during the 3 @-@ dose vacc@@ ine with the combination vacc@@ ine with 360 EL@@ IS@@ A- units of form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated hepatitis B viruses and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen was not statisti@@ cally different . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials conducted with vacc@@ ination at the age of 1 to including 15 years , the ser@@ o@@ conversion rates for anti @-@ H@@ AV were 99.@@ 1 % month after the first dose and 100 % one month after the second , for month 6 administered dose ( i.e. in month 7 ) . &quot;
&quot; ser@@ o@@ conversion rates for anti @-@ H@@ Bs were 7@@ 4.2 % one month after the first dose and 100 % one month after the second , for month 6 administered dose ( i.e. in month 7 ) . &quot;
&quot; 7 In a comparative study conducted at 12@@ - to including 15 @-@ year @-@ olds , 142 two cans of Ambi@@ rix and 147 received the standard combination vacc@@ ine with three doses . &quot;
&quot; in the 289 people whose immun@@ ity was evaluated , the ser@@ op@@ rot@@ ection rates ( SP in the table below ) were significantly higher compared to hepatitis B in the month 2 and 6 after giving the 3 @-@ dose vacc@@ ine significantly higher than with Ambi@@ rix . &quot;
&quot; the immune response , which was achieved in a clinical comparative study at 1- until 11 @-@ year @-@ olds one month after completion of the full ino@@ cul@@ ation series ( i.e. in month 7 ) , are listed in the following table . &quot;
&quot; in both studies , the vacc@@ ines received either a 2 @-@ dose vacc@@ ine with Ambi@@ rix or a 3 @-@ dose vacc@@ ination scheme with a combination vacc@@ ine with 360 ELISA units form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated hepatitis A virus and 10@@ µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen . &quot;
the persist@@ ence of anti @-@ HAV@@ - and anti @-@ H@@ Bs could be detected over at least 24 months after imm@@ uni@@ zation with Ambi@@ rix in 0 @-@ 6 month vacc@@ ination .
&quot; the immune reaction observed in this study was comparable to those observed after vacc@@ ination of 3 doses with a combination vacc@@ ine consisting of 360 ELISA units form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated h@@ ep@@ ati@@ tis@@ - A virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen in a dose of 0,5 ml . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical study at 12@@ - to including 15 @-@ year @-@ olds , the persist@@ ence of anti @-@ HAV@@ - and anti @-@ H@@ Bs antibodies could be compared 24 months after imm@@ uni@@ zation in the 0 @-@ 6 month vacc@@ ination scheme compared to the 0 @-@ 12 @-@ month vacc@@ ination scheme . &quot;
&quot; if the first dose of Ambi@@ rix in the second year of life is administered at the same time with the refres@@ her vacc@@ ination of a combined di@@ ph@@ th@@ eri@@ e- , tet@@ an@@ us@@ - , az@@ ell@@ ular per@@ t@@ uss@@ i , in@@ activated poli@@ omyel@@ i@@ tis@@ - and 8 Ha@@ em@@ op@@ hil@@ us influ@@ enz@@ ae type b vacc@@ ine ( DT@@ PA @-@ IP@@ V / HI@@ B ) or with the first dose of a combined mas@@ king @-@ m@@ umps @-@ rub@@ ella vacc@@ ine , the immune response to all anti@@ gens was sufficient . &quot;
a clinical study conducted with 3 doses of current formulation in adults showed similar ser@@ op@@ rot@@ ection and ser@@ o@@ conversion rates as for previous formulation .
the vacc@@ ine is examined both before and after res@@ us@@ pen@@ ing on any foreign particles and / or physical visible changes .

&quot; the hepatitis A virus is usually transmitted by virus @-@ containing foods and beverages , but can also be transmitted through other ways such as bathing in waters contaminated by sewage . &quot;
&quot; you can feel very tired , have a dark urine , a pale face , yellow skin and / or eyes ( j@@ aun@@ dice ) and other symptoms that may possibly make a stationary treatment necessary . &quot;
&quot; as with all vacc@@ ines , Ambi@@ rix can not be completely protected from infection with hepatitis A or Hepatitis B viruses , even if the complete ino@@ cul@@ ation series has been completed with 2 doses . &quot;
if you / your child are already infected with Hepatitis A or Hepatitis B virus prior to the administration of both vacc@@ ines Ambi@@ rix ( although you / your child will not feel uncomfortable or ill at the time of vacc@@ ination ) a vacc@@ ination may not prevent a disease .
&quot; a protection against other infections , which cause the liver damage or cause symptoms similar to those after hepatitis A or Hepatitis B infection , cannot be medi@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; • If your child has already demonstrated an allergic reaction to Ambi@@ rix , or any component of this vacc@@ ine , including Ne@@ om@@ y@@ cin ( antibiotic ) . &quot;
&quot; allergic reaction can manifest through it@@ chy r@@ ashes , breathing or swelling of the face or tongue . • If you already have an allergic reaction to an earlier vacc@@ ination against hepatitis A or Hepatitis B . • If you / your child have a severe infection with fever / has . &quot;
• If you want to quickly protect against hepatitis B ( i.e. within 6 months and before the prescribed dose of the second vacc@@ ine dose ) .
&quot; at a possible risk of infection with hepatitis B between the first and second vacc@@ ination , the doctor will advise you / her child from vacc@@ ination with Ambi@@ rix . &quot;
&quot; instead , it will recommend 3 inj@@ ections of a combined hepatitis A / Hepatitis B vacc@@ ine with a reduced content of effective ingredients per vacc@@ ine dose ( 360 ELISA units of a form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated hepatitis A virus and 10 micro@@ grams of a re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface . &quot;
the second vacc@@ ine dose of this vacc@@ ine with reduced content of effective ingredients is usually administered one month after the first dose and should give you / your child a vacc@@ ination before ending the vacc@@ ine series .
sometimes Ambi@@ rix will be inj@@ ected in people suffering from severe blood cl@@ ot@@ ting disorders under the skin and not in the muscle . • If you / your child are weak@@ ened due to illness or treatment in your body &apos;s own immune system or if you / your child undergo a hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis .
&quot; Ambi@@ rix can be given in these cases , but the immune response of these persons on vacc@@ ination cannot be sufficient so that a blood test may be necessary to see how strongly the reaction to vacc@@ ination is . &quot;
21 Tell your doctor if you / your child take more medicines ( including those who have been vacc@@ inated without en@@ rol@@ ment ) or if you have been vacc@@ inated or have been given immun@@ og@@ lob@@ ul@@ ins ( antibodies ) or is planned in the near future .
&quot; however , it may be that in this case the immune response to the vacc@@ ine is insufficient and the person is therefore not protected against one or both hepatitis A and B viruses . &quot;
&quot; if another vacc@@ ine has to be given at the same time with Ambi@@ rix , it should be vacc@@ inated in separate places and as different limbs . &quot;
&quot; if Ambi@@ rix is to be administered at the same time or shortly before or after an injection of immun@@ og@@ lob@@ ul@@ ins , it is likely that the reaction to the vacc@@ ine will still be sufficient . &quot;
&quot; usually , Ambi@@ rix will not be given pregnant or breast@@ feeding women unless it is urgently needed to be vacc@@ inated against hepatitis A as well as hepatitis B . &quot;
important information about certain other components of Ambi@@ rix Please inform your doctor if your child has already shown an allergic reaction to ne@@ om@@ y@@ cin ( antibiotic ) .
&quot; if you miss the agreed deadline for the second vacc@@ ination , talk to your doctor and arrange a new appointment as soon as possible . &quot;

Ambi@@ rix is available in packs of 1 and 10 with or without need@@ les and in packs of 50 without need@@ les .
&quot; on the basis of the data , which have become known since issu@@ ance of the first permit for placing on the market , the CH@@ MP saw that the benefit @-@ risk ratio for Ambi@@ rix remains positive . &quot;
&quot; however , since Ambi@@ rix was only introduced in a Member State ( in the Netherlands since May 2003 ) , the available security data for this drug is limited due to the low patient exposure . &quot;
form@@ ul@@ as can also be used in patients at the age of more than one month with in@@ complete enzyme defect or with hyper@@ ammon@@ i@@ tic encephal@@ opathy ( brain damage due to high ammon@@ ia concentrations ) in pre @-@ history .
&quot; - split by several individual doses at meals - swal@@ lowed , bl@@ ended under the food or administered via a Gast@@ ro@@ stom@@ i@@ esch@@ l@@ auch ( through the stomach in the stomach of the leading tube ) or a nas@@ al son@@ de ( through the nose into the stomach of the leading tube ) . &quot;
&quot; it was not a comparative study , as ammon@@ ia could not be compared with another treatment or with plac@@ ebo ( a pseu@@ do @-@ medicine , i.e. without drug ) . &quot;
&quot; ammon@@ ia may also result in loss of appetite , a ab@@ normal acid content in the blood , depression , irrit@@ ability , head@@ aches , f@@ ainting , nau@@ sea , sti@@ p@@ ation , skin r@@ ash , un@@ pleas@@ urable body od@@ or or weight gain . &quot;
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that ammon@@ ia in patients with distur@@ bances of the ure@@ a cycle to high ammon@@ ia values effectively prevented .
&quot; Ammon@@ ium was approved under &quot; exceptional circumstances , &quot; because due to the rar@@ ity of the disease , limited information on this drug was available at the time of approval . &quot;
&quot; the use is indicated in all patients , in which a complete enzyme shortage is already manifest@@ ed in new@@ bor@@ ns ( within the first 28 days of life ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients with a late @-@ manifest form ( incomplete enzy@@ matic defect , which is manifest@@ ed after the first months of life ) , there is an indication for use when a hyper@@ ammon@@ ia encephal@@ opathy exists in the an@@ am@@ nes@@ is . &quot;
&quot; for inf@@ ants , for children who are not able to swal@@ low tablets or for patients with swal@@ lowing disorders AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS is also available in gran@@ ules form . &quot;
the daily dose is calculated individually using the protein tolerance and the daily protein intake needed for growth and development .
&quot; after previous clinical experience , the normal daily dose of sodium phen@@ yl but@@ y@@ rat : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9,@@ 9 - 13,@@ 0 g / m ² / day in children with a body weight over 20 kg and in adolescents and adults . &quot;
the sub@@ stitution of cit@@ rul@@ line or ar@@ gin@@ ine in a dose of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day is required for patients suffering from an early @-@ manifest lack of car@@ bam@@ yl@@ phosph@@ ate syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase or or@@ ni@@ thin@@ pot@@ scar@@ bam@@ y@@ las@@ e .
&quot; patients with ar@@ gin@@ ine os@@ u@@ cc@@ in@@ ate syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase deficiency must receive ar@@ gin@@ ine in a dose of 0,4 - 0,7 g / kg / day or 8,@@ 8 - 15,@@ 4 g / m ² / day . &quot;
&quot; AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS tablets are not allowed to admini@@ ster patients with swal@@ lowing disorders , as there is a risk of the emergence of O@@ soph@@ ag@@ us@@ ul@@ cer@@ a if the tablets are not absorbed immediately into the stomach . &quot;
&quot; each tablet AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS contains 62 mg ( 2.7 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium , equivalent to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per 20 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat , which corresponds to the maximum daily dose . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS should be applied with caution in patients with con@@ ges@@ tive heart failure or severe kidney failure as well as with associated clinical conditions with caution . &quot;
&quot; since metabolism and ex@@ cre@@ tion of sodium phen@@ yl but@@ y@@ rate over the liver and kid@@ neys is done , AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS should be applied only with extreme caution in patients with liver or kidney failure . &quot;
the importance of these results regarding pregnant women is not known ; the use of AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS during pregnancy is therefore contra@@ indicated ( see 4.3 ) .
&quot; in sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate to young rats in high doses ( 190 - 474 mg / kg ) , there was a slow@@ ing of neur@@ onal multip@@ lication and an increased loss of neur@@ ons . &quot;
there was also a delayed matur@@ ation of cer@@ ebral syn@@ ap@@ ses and a reduced number of functioning nerve injuries in the brain and thus a disability of the brain growth .
&quot; it could not be determined whether phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is ex@@ cre@@ ted in the mother &apos;s milk , and for this reason the use of AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS is contra@@ indicated during lac@@ tation ( see 4.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials with AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS , 56 % of patients had at least one undes@@ irable event ( AE ) and 78 % of these adverse events were assumed that they were not associated with AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS . &quot;
&quot; the frequency is defined as follows : very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) and occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) . &quot;
&quot; a prob@@ able toxic reaction to AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by a 18 year old an@@ or@@ ec@@ tic patient , which developed a metabolic encephal@@ opathy in conjunction with lac@@ to@@ azi@@ dosis , severe hypo@@ kal@@ emia , ar@@ thro@@ cy@@ top@@ enia , periph@@ eral neu@@ rop@@ athy and pancre@@ atitis . &quot;
a case of over@@ dosing occurred in a 5 month old inf@@ ant with an acci@@ dental single dose of 10 g ( 13@@ 70 mg / kg ) .
&quot; these symptoms go with the accumulation of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate , which showed an intra@@ ven@@ ous administration of doses up to 400 mg / kg / day a dose @-@ limiting neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity . &quot;
&quot; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is an active compound that is con@@ jug@@ ated with glut@@ amine to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine , which is ex@@ cre@@ ted over the kid@@ neys . &quot;
phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is comparable to a ure@@ a ( both compounds contain 2 nitrogen atoms ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore suitable as an alternative carrier for ex@@ cre@@ tion of excess nitrogen .
&quot; 5 patients with disorders of the ure@@ a cycle can be assumed that for each gram , sodium phen@@ yl but@@ y@@ rate between 0.@@ 12 and 0.@@ 15 g phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine nitrogen can be produced . &quot;
it is important that the diagnosis is set early and the treatment will commen@@ ce immediately to improve survival chances and clinical outcome .
&quot; the pre@@ diction of the early manifest form of the disease with incidence of the first symptoms in new@@ bor@@ ns was almost always inf@@ used , and the disease itself led to death in treatment with per@@ it@@ one@@ al di@@ aly@@ sis and essential amino acids or with their nitrogen @-@ free analog@@ ues within the first year of life . &quot;
&quot; hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis , the utilization of alternative ways of nitrogen ex@@ cre@@ tion ( sodium poly@@ phen@@ yl but@@ y@@ rate , sodium ben@@ zo@@ ate and sodium poly@@ phen@@ yl acet@@ ate ) , prot@@ ein@@ ated diet and possibly sub@@ stitution of essential amino acids , it was possible to increase the survival rate new@@ born in post@@ part@@ al ( but within the first months of life ) to increase to 80 % . &quot;
&quot; in patients whose disease was diagnosed during the course of pregnancy and which were already treated before the first appearance of a hyper@@ ammon@@ ium encephal@@ opathy , the survival rate was 100 % , but even with these patients it was time for many mental disabilities or other neurolog@@ ical defic@@ its . &quot;
&quot; in patients with a late @-@ manifest form of the disease ( including female patients with the hetero@@ zy@@ got@@ ic form of the or@@ ni@@ thin@@ tran@@ scar@@ bam@@ y@@ las@@ e deficiency ) , which were recovered from a hyper@@ ammon@@ ium encephal@@ opathy and then permanently treated with sodium phen@@ yl but@@ y@@ rat and a protein @-@ reduced diet , the survival rate was 98 % . &quot;
already existing neurolog@@ ical defic@@ its are hardly reversible in the treatment and in some patients a further deteri@@ oration of the neurolog@@ ical condition may occur .
&quot; it is known that phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat is oxi@@ di@@ zed to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate , which is jug@@ ated in liver and kidney enzy@@ mati@@ cally with glut@@ amine , with phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine . &quot;
&quot; concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat and its metabol@@ ites in plasma and urine were measured after a single dose of 5 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat in so@@ ber healthy adults and in patients with disorders of the ure@@ a cycle , hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in metabolism and with cir@@ rho@@ sis of oral doses of up to 20 g / day ( un@@ controlled studies ) . &quot;
the behaviour of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat and its metabol@@ ites was also investigated in cancer patients after intra@@ ven@@ ous use of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat ( up to 2 g / m ² ) or phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate .
&quot; after an oral single dose of 5 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat in tablet form , 15 minutes after taking meas@@ urable plas@@ mac@@ concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat were detected . &quot;
&quot; in the majority of patients with ure@@ a @-@ cycl@@ ones or hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in opath@@ ies , phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate ( 300 @-@ 650 mg / kg / day up to 20 g / day ) showed no phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate in plasma the next morning after ni@@ ghtly fast . &quot;
&quot; in three out of six patients with cir@@ rho@@ sis of the liver , which were treated repeatedly with sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat ( 20 g / day or@@ ally in three single doses ) , the mean phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate concentrations in the plasma mirror on the third day were five times higher than after the first gifts . &quot;
ex@@ cre@@ tion The medication is ex@@ cre@@ ted over the kid@@ neys within 24 hours of about 80 @-@ 100 % in the form of the con@@ jug@@ ated product phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine .
&quot; according to the results of the Mic@@ ron@@ u@@ cle@@ us test , sodium phen@@ yl but@@ y@@ rat was not treated with toxic and non @-@ toxic doses ( investigation 24 and 48 h after oral dosing of an individual dose of 8@@ 78 to 28@@ 00 mg / kg ) . &quot;
&quot; AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS gran@@ ules are either taken or@@ ally ( inf@@ ants and children , which can not swal@@ low any tablets , or patients with lo@@ oping disorders ) or via a Gast@@ ro@@ stom@@ i@@ esch@@ l@@ auch or a nas@@ al probe . &quot;
&quot; after previous clinical experience , the normal daily dose of sodium phen@@ yl but@@ y@@ rat : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day for new@@ bor@@ ns , inf@@ ants and children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9,@@ 9 - 13,@@ 0 g / m ² / day in children with a body@@ weight over 20 kg and in adolescents and adults . &quot;
&quot; the concentration of ammon@@ ia , ar@@ gin@@ ine , essential amino acids ( especially bran@@ ched @-@ chain amino acids ) , car@@ nit@@ ine and ser@@ um proteins in plasma should be held within the normal range . &quot;
the sub@@ stitution of cit@@ rul@@ line or ar@@ gin@@ ine in a dose of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day is required for patients suffering from an early @-@ manifest lack of car@@ bam@@ yl@@ phosph@@ ate syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase or or@@ ni@@ thin@@ pot@@ scar@@ bam@@ y@@ las@@ e .
&quot; AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS Gran@@ ules contains 124 mg ( 5,@@ 4 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per gram of sodium phen@@ yl but@@ y@@ rate , corresponding 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per 20 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat , which corresponds to the maximum daily dose . &quot;
&quot; if rat fl@@ utes were exposed before the birth phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate ( active metabol@@ ite of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat ) , it came to les@@ ions in the pyram@@ idal cells of the cer@@ ebral c@@ ort@@ ex . &quot;
&quot; a prob@@ able toxic reaction to AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by a 18 year old an@@ or@@ ec@@ tic patient , which developed a metabolic encephal@@ opathy in conjunction with lac@@ to@@ azi@@ dosis , severe hypo@@ kal@@ emia , ar@@ thro@@ cy@@ top@@ enia , periph@@ eral neu@@ rop@@ athy and pancre@@ atitis . &quot;
phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine with ure@@ a is comparable ( both compounds contain 2 nitrogen atoms ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore suitable as an alternative carrier for ex@@ cre@@ tion of excess
&quot; based on research on the ex@@ cre@@ tion of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine in patients with disorders of the ure@@ a cycle , it can be assumed that a sodium poly@@ phen@@ yl but@@ y@@ rate used for each gram is produced between 0.@@ 12 and 0.@@ 15 g phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine nitrogen . &quot;
&quot; existing neurolog@@ ical defic@@ its are hardly reversible , and in some patients a further deteri@@ oration of the neurolog@@ ical condition may occur . &quot;
&quot; after an oral single dose of 5 grams of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat in gran@@ ul@@ at@@ ape , 15 minutes after taking meas@@ urable plas@@ mac@@ concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat were detected . &quot;
&quot; during the duration of durability , the patient can store the finished product for a period of 3 months at a temperature of not above 25 ° C. &quot;
&quot; this procedure includes the small measuring spo@@ on 0,@@ 95 g , the medium measuring spo@@ on 2.9 g and the large measuring sco@@ op 8.6 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat . &quot;
&quot; if a patient has to obtain the medication over a probe , AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS can also be dissolved in water before use ( the sol@@ ub@@ ility of sodium phen@@ yl but@@ y@@ rat amounts to 5 g in 10 ml of water ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients with these rare diseases , certain liver enzymes are missing , so they cannot be eliminated after consumption of proteins in the body . &quot;
&quot; if laboratory tests are carried out , you must notify the doctor that you are taking AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS as sodium phen@@ yl but@@ y@@ rat may affect the results of certain laboratory tests . &quot;
&quot; when taking AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS with other medicines Please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you take other medicines or have recently taken , even if it is not prescription medicine . &quot;
&quot; during breast@@ feeding , you may not take AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS as the medicine can sur@@ pass the mother &apos;s milk and harm your baby . &quot;
&quot; in rare cases , confusion , head@@ ache , taste distur@@ bances , dis@@ rup@@ tions of the ear , dis@@ orientation , memory distur@@ bances and a deteri@@ oration of existing neurolog@@ ical conditions were observed . &quot;
&quot; if you notice any of these symptoms , contact your doctor or emergency room for an appropriate treatment . &quot;
if you forgot the intake of AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS take the appropriate dose as soon as possible with the next meal .
&quot; changes in the blood image ( red blood cells , white blood cells , th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ tes ) , dimin@@ ished appetite , depression , irrit@@ ability , head@@ aches , f@@ ainting , nau@@ sea , sti@@ p@@ pling , uncomfortable skin od@@ or , skin r@@ ash , kidney function , weight gain and an@@ om@@ al laboratory values . &quot;
please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if any of the listed side effects will significantly affect you or you notice side effects that are not specified in this information .
you may not use AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS after the exp@@ ir@@ ation date on the cart@@ on and the container .
&quot; like AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS looks and contents of the pack AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS tablets are of whi@@ tish color and oval shape , and they are provided with the em@@ bos@@ sing &quot; U@@ CY 500 . &quot; &quot;
&quot; 30 If laboratory tests are carried out , you must notify the doctor that you are taking AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS as sodium phen@@ yl but@@ y@@ rat may affect the results of certain laboratory tests . &quot;
&quot; when taking AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS with other medicines Please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you take other medicines or have recently taken , even if it is not prescription medicine . &quot;
&quot; you should take AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS to the same single doses or via a stomach fi@@ st@@ ula ( tube , which runs directly into the stomach by the abdominal wall ) or a nas@@ al probe ( tube , which is fed through the nose into the stomach ) . &quot;
&quot; 31 • Get out of the container a he@@ aped measuring spo@@ on gran@@ ules . • Deli@@ ver a straight edge , e.g. a knife back over the upper edge of the measuring spo@@ on to remove excess gran@@ ules . • Take the recommended number of spo@@ ons gran@@ ules out of the container . &quot;
&quot; An@@ gi@@ ox is used to treat adult patients with acute cor@@ on@@ ary syndrome ( AC@@ S , reduced blood supply to the heart ) , for example in un@@ stable Ang@@ ina ( a form of pain in the chest with different starch ) or m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction ( heart attack ) without &quot; &quot; stem &quot; &quot; ( an an@@ om@@ al measurement value of the electro@@ cardi@@ ogram or EC@@ G ) . &quot;
&quot; An@@ gi@@ ox is used to prevent blood cl@@ ots in patients who undergo a PCI , a higher dose is administered and the in@@ fusion can continue up to four hours after the procedure . &quot;
this can contribute in patients with anxiety or heart attack to maintain blood flow to heart and increase the effectiveness of a PCI .
&quot; approximately 14 000 patients participated in the main study on the treatment of AC@@ S , in which the effect of An@@ gi@@ ox was compared to chemotherapy alone or in combination with a gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ ein II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or ( GP@@ I , another medicine for preventing blood cl@@ ots ) and a GP@@ I . &quot;
&quot; during the PCI , patients often have a st@@ ent ( a short tube which remains in the ar@@ tery to prevent a closure ) and they also received other medicines to prevent blood cl@@ ots , such as ab@@ ci@@ x@@ ima@@ b and aspir@@ in . &quot;
&quot; in the treatment of AC@@ S , An@@ gi@@ ox - with or without a gift from GP@@ I - was as effective in preventing new events ( deaths , heart attacks or re@@ vas@@ cul@@ ar@@ isation ) after 30 days or a year altogether as effective as conventional treatment . &quot;
&quot; in patients receiving a PCI , An@@ gi@@ ox was just as effective as He@@ par@@ in , except for severe bleeding in which it was significantly more effective than he@@ par@@ in . &quot;
&quot; An@@ gi@@ ox must not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ ine , other mil@@ de@@ ud@@ ine or one of the other ingredients . &quot;
&quot; it may also not be used in patients who recently had bleeding , as well as in people with severe hyper@@ tension or severe kidney problems or heart infection . &quot;
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that An@@ gi@@ ox is an acceptable replacement for He@@ par@@ in during the treatment of AC@@ S and during a PCI .
&quot; in September 2004 , the European Commission granted the Company The Medic@@ ines Company UK Ltd permission to launch An@@ gi@@ ox in the entire European Union . &quot;
&quot; for the treatment of adult patients with acute cor@@ on@@ ary syndrome ( inst@@ ab@@ ile ang@@ ina / non @-@ ST @-@ lift inf@@ ar@@ ction ( IA / N@@ STE@@ MI ) ) , or when an early intervention is provided . &quot;
&quot; the recommended starting dose of An@@ gi@@ ox in patients with AC@@ S is an intra@@ ven@@ ous bolt of 0,1 mg / kg followed by an in@@ fusion of 0.25 mg / kg / h . &quot;
&quot; if a PCI is carried out in a further row , an additional bolt of 0.5 mg / kg should be increased and the in@@ fusion can be increased to 1.@@ 75 mg / kg / h . &quot;
&quot; according to the PCI , the reduced in@@ fusion dose of 0.25 mg / kg / h can be recorded for 4 to 12 hours after clinical requirements . &quot;
&quot; prior to the procedure , a bolt of 0.5 mg / kg should be administered , followed by an in@@ fusion of 1.@@ 75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the procedure . &quot;
the recommended dosage of An@@ gi@@ ox in patients with a PCI consists of an initial intra@@ ven@@ ous bolt of 0.@@ 75 mg / kg body weight and a subsequent intra@@ ven@@ ous in@@ fusion with a dose of 1.@@ 75 mg / kg body weight / h at least for the duration of the surgery .
the safety and efficacy of an all@@ ot@@ ted Bol@@ us administration of An@@ gi@@ ox has not been studied and is not recommended even if a short PCI intervention is planned .
&quot; if this value ( ACT after 5 minutes ) short@@ ened to less than 225 seconds , a second bolt of 0.3 mg / kg / body weight should take place . &quot;
&quot; in order to reduce the occurrence of lower ACT values , the re @-@ stit@@ uting and dil@@ uted medicines should be me@@ tic@@ ul@@ ously mixed before application and the dose of Bol@@ us@@ tin can be administered quickly intra@@ ven@@ ously . &quot;
&quot; once the ACT value is more than 225 seconds , another monitoring is no longer required , provided that the 1.@@ 75 mg / kg in@@ fusion dose is administered correctly . &quot;
&quot; in patients with moderate kidney function restriction ( G@@ FR 30 @-@ 59 ml / min ) , which are subject to one PCI ( whether treated with Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din against AC@@ S or not ) , a lower in@@ fusion rate of 1.4 mg / kg / h should be used . &quot;
&quot; if the ACT value is below 225 seconds , a second bolt dose of 0.3 mg / kg is to be administered and the ACT 5 minutes after the second bolt dose is checked again . &quot;
&quot; in patients with moderate ren@@ al damage , which were included in the Phase II PCI study ( RE@@ PLA@@ CE @-@ 2 ) , the ACT value was 5 minutes after application of the Bi@@ val@@ er@@ u@@ din @-@ Bol@@ us without dose adjustment with an average of 366 ± 89 seconds . &quot;
3 In patients with severe kidney damage ( G@@ FR &lt; 30 ml / min ) and also in di@@ aly@@ sis patients An@@ gi@@ ox is contra@@ indicated ( see section 4.3 ) .
the treatment with An@@ gi@@ ox can be initiated 30 minutes after the intra@@ ven@@ ous administration of un@@ frac@@ tion@@ ated he@@ par@@ in or 8 hours after the sub@@ cut@@ aneous formulation of low molecular pi@@ par@@ in .
• a well known hyper@@ sensitivity to the active ingredient or any other component or against Hir@@ ud@@ ine • active bleeding or increased risk of bleeding due to a distur@@ b@@ ance of hem@@ ost@@ asis system and / or ir@@ reversible noise disorders . • severe kidney damage ( G@@ FR &lt; 30 ml / min ) and in di@@ aly@@ sis patients
patients are carefully monitored during treatment with regard to symptoms and signs of bleeding especially when Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din is administered in combination with another anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant ( see Section 4.5 ) .
&quot; even though the majority of PCI @-@ patients suffer from arter@@ ial points in the case of PCI @-@ patients , patients who undergo a perc@@ ut@@ aneous cor@@ on@@ ary intervention ( PCI ) can occur during the treatment in principle throughout bleeding . &quot;
&quot; in patients who take war@@ far@@ in and treated with Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ ine , a monitoring of the IN@@ R value ( International Norm@@ alised R@@ atio ) should be considered to ensure that the value after setting the treatment with Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din will be achieved again before the treatment . &quot;
&quot; based on the knowledge of the mechanism of anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants ( he@@ par@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , thro@@ mb@@ oly@@ tica or th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ te aggregate ) , these agents can increase the risk of blood . &quot;
&quot; in the combination of bic@@ ol@@ u@@ id@@ ine with th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ te aggreg@@ ates or anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants , the clinical and biological hem@@ ost@@ ase@@ ase@@ parameters are regularly monitored regularly . &quot;
&quot; the animal experiments are insufficient in relation to pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , dis@@ connection or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; 46@@ 12 were random@@ ised to Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din alone , 46@@ 04 were random@@ ised to Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din plus G@@ PI@@ I@@ b / II@@ I@@ a In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or and 46@@ 03 were random@@ ized to either un@@ frac@@ tion@@ ated he@@ par@@ in or E@@ no@@ x@@ apar@@ in plus G@@ PI@@ I@@ b / II@@ I@@ a In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or . &quot;
&quot; in both the Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din group and in the comparison groups treated with He@@ par@@ in , women and patients over 65 years of age were more common in adverse events than in male or younger patients . &quot;
severe bleeding were defined according to A@@ cu@@ ity and Tim@@ i scales for severe bleeding as defined in table 2 foot@@ notes .
both light and severe bleeding occurred significantly less often than in the groups with He@@ par@@ in plus G@@ PI@@ I@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or plus G@@ PI@@ I@@ b / II@@ I@@ a- In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or ( see table 2 ) .
&quot; A@@ cu@@ ity severe bleeding has been defined as one of the following events : intra@@ cran@@ ial , retro@@ per@@ it@@ one@@ al , intra@@ ocular blood flow or bleeding in the point area , which required a radi@@ ological or surgical intervention , reduction of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in level of ≥ 3 g / dl with a known blood supply , re@@ operation due to bleeding , application of blood products for trans@@ fusion . &quot;
&quot; further , less frequently observed blood @-@ loc@@ aliz@@ ations that occurred with more than 0.1 % ( occasionally ) were &quot; mis@@ c &quot; points , retro@@ per@@ it@@ one@@ al , g@@ astro@@ intestinal , ear , nose or neck . &quot;
&quot; the following information about side effects are based on the data of a clinical trial with Bi@@ val@@ er@@ ine at 6000 patients , which under@@ went one PCI . &quot;
&quot; in both the Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din group and in the comparison groups treated with He@@ par@@ in , women and patients over 65 years of age were more common in adverse events than in male or younger patients . &quot;
both light and severe bleeding occurred significantly less often than in the comparison group under He@@ par@@ in plus G@@ PI@@ I@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or .
&quot; the following side effects , which are not listed above , were reported after extensive application in practice and are group@@ ed according to system organ classes in table 6 . &quot;
&quot; in the case of over@@ dosing , the treatment with Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din is immediately canc@@ eled and the patient is closely mes@@ hed with regard to signs of bleeding . &quot;
&quot; An@@ gi@@ ox contains Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din , a direct and specific th@@ rom@@ bin@@ inhibit@@ or , which bin@@ ds both at the cataly@@ tic center and in the an@@ ion binding region of Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in , irrespective of whether the thro@@ mb@@ in is bound in the liquid phase or in cl@@ ot@@ ting . &quot;
&quot; the binding of Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din to Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in , and therefore its effect , is reversible , because Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in turn slowly spl@@ its the binding of Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din @-@ AR@@ G3 @-@ Pro@@ 4 , thereby re@@ generating the function of the active center of Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in . &quot;

&quot; A@@ pi@@ dra is used to treat adults , adolescents and children from six years with diabetes who need treatment with insulin . &quot;
&quot; A@@ pi@@ dra is inj@@ ected sub@@ cut@@ aneous ( under the skin ) into the abdominal wall , the thi@@ ghs or the upper arm or administered as continuous in@@ fusion with an insulin pump . &quot;
diabetes is a disease in which the body does not produce enough insulin to regulate the glucose level ( sugar ) in the blood or unable to process insulin effectively .
insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in differs very slightly from Human@@ acting and the change means that it works faster and has a shorter duration as a short @-@ acting human insulin .
A@@ pi@@ dra was used in combination with a long @-@ effective insulin in patients with type 1 diabetes in which the body cannot produce insulin in two studies with a total of 1 549 adults and in a study with 572 children aged between four and 17 years .
&quot; in case of type 2 diabetes , where insulin is not processed effectively , A@@ pi@@ dra was studied in a study of 8@@ 78 adults . &quot;
the main indicator for the efficacy was the change in the concentration of the substance gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) in the blood which indicates how well the blood sugar is adjusted .
&quot; in the first study with adults with type 1 diabetes , a reduction of 0.@@ 14 % ( from 7.@@ 60 % to 7.@@ 46 % ) was determined in comparison to a reduction of 0.@@ 14 % in insulin delivery . &quot;
&quot; in adults with type 2 diabetes , lowering of H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c concentration was 0.@@ 46 % after six months with A@@ pi@@ dra compared to 0.@@ 30 % in human normal insulin . &quot;
&quot; A@@ pi@@ dra may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in or any of the other ingredients , or in patients who are already suffering from hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia . &quot;
&quot; the doses of A@@ pi@@ dra may be adjusted , if it is administered together with a number of other medicines that can affect blood glucose levels . &quot;
&quot; in September 2004 , the European Commission granted San@@ of@@ i @-@ Av@@ entis Germany GmbH a permit for the transport of A@@ pi@@ dra across the European Union . &quot;
&quot; as a sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection , A@@ pi@@ dra can be applied either in the area of the abdominal wall , the thig@@ h or the del@@ ta muscle or to apply sub@@ cut@@ aneous by continuous in@@ fusion into the area of the abdom@@ en . &quot;
&quot; due to the reduced glucose capacity and the reduced insulin metabolism , insulin need to be reduced in patients with a limitation of liver function . &quot;
&quot; any change of the activity , the brand ( regul@@ ator ) , the insulin type ( normal , N@@ PH , zinc @-@ delayed etc . ) , the type of insulin ( animal insulin ) and / or the manufacturing method can change a change in the insulin requirement . &quot;
&quot; 3 An insufficient dosage or ab@@ ruption of treatment , especially in patients with insulin @-@ related diabetes , can lead to hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and a di@@ ab@@ etic k@@ eto@@ aci@@ dosis ; these conditions are potentially life threatening . &quot;
the conversion of a patient to another insulin type or insulin in another manufacturer should take place under strict medical supervision and may require a change of dosage .
the time of occurrence of hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia depends on the active profile of the insulin @-@ used insulin and can therefore change in the switch of the treatment schem@@ as .
&quot; the substances that increase blood sugar @-@ lowering activity and increase the prop@@ ens@@ ity to hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ias include oral anti@@ di@@ abe@@ tics , angi@@ ot@@ ens@@ in converting enzyme ( ACE ) inhibit@@ ors , phen@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , mon@@ o@@ amine oxid@@ ase , mon@@ o@@ amine oxid@@ ase , pro@@ po@@ xy@@ ph@@ yl@@ ate , and sul@@ fon@@ amide antibiotics . &quot;
&quot; in addition , under the effect of sympath@@ e@@ tics such as beta block@@ ers , cl@@ oni@@ din , gu@@ an@@ eth@@ i@@ din and reserve the symptoms of adren@@ ergi@@ c counter@@ regulation can be weak@@ ened or missing . &quot;
&quot; in relation to pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see Section 5.3 ) showed no difference between in@@ su@@ - ling@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in and human insulin . &quot;
&quot; it is not known whether insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in occurs in human breast milk , but generally insulin does not occur in the mother &apos;s milk , nor is it res@@ or@@ bed after oral application . &quot;
&quot; listed below are listed clinical trials which are known from clinical trials , group@@ ed according to system organ classes and ordered according to decre@@ asing frequency of their occurrence ( very common : ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 100 ; rare : ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ; very rare : &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) ; not known ( frequency based on the available data cannot be estimated ) . &quot;
&quot; cold sweat , cool and pale skin , fatigue , nerv@@ ousness or tre@@ mor , anxiety , unusual creation or weakness , confusion , distur@@ bances , ligh@@ the@@ ade@@ dness , excessive hun@@ - , head@@ aches , nau@@ sea , and pal@@ pit@@ ations . &quot;
Li@@ po@@ dy@@ stro@@ phy Is fo@@ amed to continuously switch the injection point within the injection range can occur in the wake of a li@@ po@@ dy@@ stro@@ phy at the injection point .
severe hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ias with un@@ consciousness can be treated by means of an in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of glu@@ c@@ agon ( 0.5 to 1 mg ) which is given by a correspon@@ d@@ ingly trained person or treated by a doctor by an intra@@ ven@@ ous gift of glucose .
&quot; after a glucose injection , the patient should be monitored in a hospital to determine the cause for the severe hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and to avoid similar episodes . &quot;
insulin lowers blood sugar levels by stimulating the periph@@ eral glucose absorption ( especially through skel@@ etal muscles and fat ) as well as through the in@@ hibition of glucose production in the liver .
studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes showed that in sub@@ cut@@ aneous ga@@ - be of insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in the efficiency occurs faster and the active duration is shorter than with hu@@ - man@@ em normal insulin .
&quot; in a study with 18 male persons at the age of 21 to 50 years with type 1 diabetes , insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in showed a dose of proportional glu@@ cos@@ es@@ healing effect , and at 0.3 E / kg or more , a sub@@ propor@@ tion@@ ate increase in glu@@ cos@@ ity effect , just like Human@@ acting . &quot;
insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in has twice as fast response as normal human insulin and achieves the complete glu@@ cos@@ ity effect about 2 hours earlier than human insulin .
from the data it was clear that insulin @-@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in is reached 2 minutes before meal a comparable post @-@ pran@@ ic gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control as with a human normal insulin which is given 30 minutes before the meal .
&quot; insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in was taken 2 minutes before the meal , a better post@@ pran@@ dial control was achieved than with a human normal insulin , which was given 2 minutes before the meal . &quot;
&quot; insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in is applied 15 minutes after the beginning of the meal , a comparable gly@@ cem@@ ic control , such as in human normal insulin , which is given 2 Mi@@ - nu@@ des before the meal ( see Figure 1 ) . &quot;
insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in in gift 2 minutes ( G@@ LU@@ L@@ IS@@ IN - before ) before the meal was given in comparison to human normal insulin which was given 30 minutes ( NOR@@ MA@@ L - 30 min . ) before the beginning of the meal ( figure 1A ) and compared to human normal insulin which was given 2 minutes ( NOR@@ MA@@ L - before ) before a meal ( figure 1@@ B ) .
insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in in gift 15 minutes ( G@@ LU@@ L@@ IS@@ IN - afterwards ) after the meal starts in comparison to human Nor@@ - mal@@ insulin which was given 2 minutes ( NOR@@ MA@@ L - before ) before the beginning of the meal ( figure 1@@ C ) .
