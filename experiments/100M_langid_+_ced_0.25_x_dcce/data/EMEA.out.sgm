<seg id="4">"it is available as 5 mg, 10 mg, 15 mg and 30 mg tablets, as 10 mg, 15 mg and 30 mg of processed tablets (tablets that dissolve in the mouth), as a solution to intake (1 mg / ml) and as injection solution (7.5 mg / ml)."</seg>
<seg id="5">"B. swirl thinking and speaking, hallucinations (hearing or seeing things that are not present), distrust and delusions; • Bipolar-I disorder, a mental illness, in which patients have manic episodes (periods of anormal upset) alternately with periods of normal mood."</seg>
<seg id="6">Abilify is used to treat moderate to severe manic episodes and to prevent manic episodes in patients who have responded to the medicine in the past.</seg>
<seg id="7">Injection solution is used for quick control of increased unrest or behavioural disorders if the oral intake of the medicine is not possible.</seg>
<seg id="8">"in both diseases, the solution can be applied to the intake or the melting tablets in patients who have difficulty swallowing tablets."</seg>
<seg id="9">"patients who also take other medicines at the same time, like Abilify, should be adjusted to Abilify dose."</seg>
<seg id="10">"this impairs the signal transmission between brain cells by" neurotransmitters, "i.e. chemical substances that allow the communication of nerve cells to one another."</seg>
<seg id="11">Aripiprazol probably works mainly as a "partial agonist" for the receptors for neurotransmitter dopamine and 5 hydroxytryptamin (also called serotonin).</seg>
<seg id="12">"this means that Aripiprazol like 5 hydroxytryptamin and dopamine, but in less than the neurotransmitter works to activate the receptors."</seg>
<seg id="13">"since dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamine play a role in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, Aripiprazol contributes to normalize the activity of the brain, causing psychotic or manic symptoms to be reduced and their reoccurring will be prevented."</seg>
<seg id="14">"the efficacy of Abilify, to prevent recurrence of symptoms, was investigated in three studies over to one year."</seg>
<seg id="15">"the effectiveness of the injection solution was compared to two studies in 805 patients with schizophrenia or similar diseases, which suffered from increased unrest, compared to a placebo over a period of two hours."</seg>
<seg id="16">"in another study, Abilify was compared to 347 patients with Haloperidol, in another study the efficacy of Abilify and placebo to prevent recurrence of 160 patients in which the manic symptoms were already stabilised with Abilify."</seg>
<seg id="17">"the efficacy of Abilify injection solution was compared to 301 patients with bipolar disorder, which suffered from increased unrest, compared with Lorazepam (another antipsychotic medication) and placebo over a period of two hours."</seg>
<seg id="18">"in all studies, the change in the patient's symptoms was examined using a standard scale for bipolar disorder or the number of patients responded to treatment."</seg>
<seg id="19">The company also conducted studies to investigate how the body lowers the enamel tablets and the solution to intake.</seg>
<seg id="20">"in the two studies with the injection solution showed patients receiving Abilify in doses of 5.25 mg, 9.75 mg or 15 mg, a significantly stronger decrease in symptoms of increased unrest than the patients receiving placebo."</seg>
<seg id="21">"in the treatment of bipolar disorder, Abilify decreased in four of the five short-term studies manic symptoms more effective than placebo."</seg>
<seg id="22">"in addition to placebo, Abilify prevented a recurrence of multiple episodes in previously treated patients as placebo and if it was additionally administered to an existing treatment."</seg>
<seg id="23">Abilify injections in 10- or 15-mg doses also reduced more effective than placebo the symptoms of increased unrest and were similarly effective as Lorazepam.</seg>
<seg id="24">"the most common side effects of Abilify to take (observed with 1 to 10 of 100 patients) are extrapyramidal disruptions (uncontrollable), sedation (drowsiness), fatigue, nausea (drowsiness), fatigue and exhaustion, restlessness, insomnia (sleep disorders) and anxiety."</seg>
<seg id="25">"the Committee for Medicinal Products (CHMP) concluded that the benefits of Abilify in the treatment of schizophrenia and from moderate to severe manic episodes in cases of bipolar-I disorder, as well as in the prevention of a new manic episode in patients who had predominantly experienced episodes of treatment with Aripiprazol, weighed over the risks."</seg>
<seg id="26">"in addition, the committee came to the conclusion that the advantages of the injection solution in quick control of increased anxiety and behavioural disorders in patients with schizophrenia or in patients with manic episodes in bipolar-I disorder if oral therapy is not suitable to outweigh the risks."</seg>
<seg id="27">"in June 2004, the European Commission granted the company Otsuka Pharmaceutical Europe Ltd."</seg>
<seg id="28">Abilify is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe manic episodes of bipolar disorder and for the prevention of a new manic episode in patients that had predominantly manic episodes and whose manic episodes were addressed to the treatment with Aripiprazol (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="29">The recommended starting dose for Abilify is 10 or 15 mg / day with a maintenance dosage of 15 mg / day once daily regardless of meals.</seg>
<seg id="30">"increased effectiveness in dosages over a daily dose of 15 mg was not proven, although individual patients can benefit from a higher dose."</seg>
<seg id="31">"the recommended starting dose for Abilify is 15 mg once daily, regardless of meals as monotherapy or combination therapy (see section 5.1)."</seg>
<seg id="32">The efficacy of Abilify in the treatment of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder in patients ≥ 65 years has not been proven.</seg>
<seg id="33">"with regard to the greater sensitivity of this patient group, a lower initial dose should be considered when clinical factors justify this (see section 4.4)."</seg>
<seg id="34">"if the CYP3A4 inductor is removed from combination therapy, the Aripiprazol dose should be reduced to the recommended dose (see Section 4.5)."</seg>
<seg id="35">"the occurrence of suicidal behavior belongs to psychotic diseases and affective disorders, and was reported in some cases after the beginning or after an antipsychotic therapy, including treatment with Aripiprazol (see section 4.8)."</seg>
<seg id="36">Results of an epidemiological study showed that in patients with bipolar disorder there was no higher suicide risk with Aripiprazol compared to other antipsychotics.</seg>
<seg id="37">"Aripiprazol should be used with caution in patients with known cardiovascular diseases (Myocardial infarction or ischemic heart disease, congestion disorders), cerebrovascular diseases, conditions that predispose for hypotony (dehydration, hypovolemia, treatment with blood-lowering drugs) or hypertension (including acocelated and malignant form)."</seg>
<seg id="38">"3 Spätdyskinesia: in clinical trials, which lasted a year or less, there were occasional reports of dyskinesis occurring during treatment with Aripiprazol."</seg>
<seg id="39">"if patients treated with Abilify showed signs and symptoms of late dynasty, consider to reduce the dose or abort the treatment."</seg>
<seg id="40">"if a patient develops signs and symptoms that suggest a mns, or unclear high fever without an additional clinical manifestation of mns, all antipsychotics, including Abilify, must be removed."</seg>
<seg id="41">"therefore, Aripiprazol in patients with seizures in the anamnesis or at states associated with seizures should be applied with caution."</seg>
<seg id="42">"56 - 99 years) with Aripiprazol in patients with psychosis associated with Alzheimer's disease, patients who were treated with Aripiprazol had an increased risk of sterberisiko compared to the placebo."</seg>
<seg id="43">"however, there were in one of these studies, a study with fixed dosage, a significant relation between dosage and response to undesirable cerebrovascular events in patients treated with Aripiprazol."</seg>
<seg id="44">"hyperglycemia, in some cases extremely and associated with ketoacidosis or hyperosmolarem coma or death, was reported in patients treated with atypical antipsychotic agents, including Abilify."</seg>
<seg id="45">There are no precise risk estimates for hyperglycaemia-related adverse events in patients treated with Abilify and other atypical antipsychotic drugs to allow direct comparisons.</seg>
<seg id="46">"polydipsia, polyphagia, polyphagia and weakness) are observed and patients with diabetes mellitus or with risk factors for diabetes Mellitus should be monitored regularly with regard to worsening the glucose levels."</seg>
<seg id="47">"weight gain is generally observed in schizophrenic patients and in patients with bipolar mania due to comorbidities, the use of antipsychotics, where weight gain is known as side effect, and could lead to severe complications."</seg>
<seg id="48">"due to the primary effect of Aripiprazol on the central nervous system, caution is advisable when Aripiprazol is taken in combination with alcohol or other central effective medicines with overlying side effects such as sedation (see section 4.8)."</seg>
<seg id="49">"the H2 antagonist Famotidin, a gastric acid blocker, reduces the resorption rate of Aripiprazol, but this effect is considered clinically not relevant."</seg>
<seg id="50">"in a clinical study with healthy volunteers, a highly effective CYP2D6 inhibitor (Chinidine) increased the AUC by Aripiprazol by 107% while the CMAx remained unchanged."</seg>
<seg id="51">"it is expected that other highly effective inhibitors of CYP2D6, such as fluoxetine and paroxetine, have similar effects and therefore similar dose-reductions should be carried out."</seg>
<seg id="52">"with CYP2D6 'bad' (=" poor ") metabolism, the common application with highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4 can result in higher plasma concentrations of Aripiprazol compared to CYP2D6 extensive metabolisers."</seg>
<seg id="53">"considering the common administration of ketoconazole or other highly effective CYP3A4 inhibitors with Abilify, potential benefits should outweigh the potential risks for the patient."</seg>
<seg id="54">"other highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4, such as itraconazole and HIV protease inhibitors, have similar effects and therefore similar dose-reductions should be carried out."</seg>
<seg id="55">"after setting the CYP2D6- or 3A4 inhibitors, the dosage of Abilify should be lifted to the dose height before the start of the accompanying therapy."</seg>
<seg id="56">"diltiazem or escitalopram) or CYP2D6 are administered together with Abilify, can be calculated with a moderate increase in aripiprazol- concentrations."</seg>
<seg id="57">"in clinical trials, doses of 10-30 mg Aripiprazol per day showed no significant effect on metabolism of the substrates of CYP2D6 (Dextromethionan / 3-Methoxymorphinan ratio), 2C9 (Omeprazol) and 3A4 (Dextromethionan)."</seg>
<seg id="58">Patients should be advised to notify their doctor if they are pregnant or plan pregnancy during treatment with aripiprazol.</seg>
<seg id="59">"due to the insufficient data base for safety in humans and due to the concerns raised in animal reproductive studies, this drug may not be used in pregnancy unless the possible benefit justifies the potential risk of the fetus."</seg>
<seg id="60">"however, as with other antipsychotics, patients should be warned against dangerous machines, including motor vehicles, until they are certain that Aripiprazol has no negative impact on them."</seg>

<seg id="71">"the side effects that may occur in connection with an antipsychotic therapy, and also reported in the treatment with Aripiprazol include malignant neuroleptic syndrome, late dyskinesia and convulsions, undesirable cerebrovascular events and increased mortality in older dementia patients, hyperglycemia and diabetes Mellitus (see section 4.4)."</seg>
<seg id="72">"in clinical trials and since the launch, unintentional or intentional overdosages with Aripiprazol were observed alone in adult patients with estimated doses of up to 1260 mg and without death."</seg>
<seg id="73">"although there is no information about the efficacy of a hemodialysis in the treatment of an overdose with Aripiprazol, it is unlikely that hemodialysis in the treatment of an overdose is of benefit because Aripiprazol has a high plasma network connection."</seg>
<seg id="74">It is assumed that the effectiveness of Aripiprazol is mediated in schizophrenia and bipolar-I disorder via the combination of a partially agonistic effect on dopamine dopamine and serotonin 5HT1 receptors and an antagonistic effect on serotonin 5HT75 receptors.</seg>
<seg id="75">"Aripiprazol showed in vitro a high affinity to dopamine D2- and D3 receptor and a serotonin 5HT1a- and 5HT2a receptor as well as an even affinity to dopamine D4, the serotonin 5HT2c- and 5HT7-, for alpha-1-adrenergic and to the histamine H1receptor."</seg>

<seg id="82">In two placebo-controlled monotherapy studies with flexible dosage over 3 weeks with patients with a manic or mixed episode of Bipolar-I disorder Aripiprazol showed a superior efficacy in reducing manic symptoms over 3 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="83">In a placebo-controlled monotherapy study over 3 weeks with a fixed dosage with patients with a manic or mixed episode of the bipolar I disorder Aripiprazol showed no superior efficacy against placebo.</seg>
<seg id="84">"in two placebo- and actively controlled monotherapy studies over 12 weeks in patients with a manic or mixed episode of a bipolar-I disorder, with or without psychotic symptoms, Aripiprazol showed a efficacy in week 3 and a maintenance effect comparable to that of lithium or Haloperidol in week 12."</seg>

<seg id="2880">"Angiox is used to prevent blood clots in patients who undergo a PCI, a higher dose is administered and the infusion can continue up to four hours after the procedure."</seg>
<seg id="2881">This can contribute in patients with anxiety or heart attack to maintain blood flow to heart and increase the effectiveness of a PCI.</seg>
<seg id="2882">"approximately 14 000 patients participated in the main study on the treatment of ACS, in which the effect of Angiox was compared to chemotherapy alone or in combination with a glycoprotein IIb / IIIa inhibitor (GPI, another medicine for preventing blood clots) and a GPI."</seg>
<seg id="2883">"during the PCI, patients often have a stent (a short tube which remains in the artery to prevent a closure) and they also received other medicines to prevent blood clots, such as abciximab and aspirin."</seg>
<seg id="2884">"in the treatment of ACS, Angiox - with or without a gift from GPI - was as effective in preventing new events (deaths, heart attacks or revascularisation) after 30 days or a year altogether as effective as conventional treatment."</seg>
<seg id="2885">"in patients receiving a PCI, Angiox was just as effective as Heparin, except for severe bleeding in which it was significantly more effective than heparin."</seg>

<seg id="2887">"it may also not be used in patients who recently had bleeding, as well as in people with severe hypertension or severe kidney problems or heart infection."</seg>
<seg id="2888">The Committee for Medicinal Products (CHMP) concluded that Angiox is an acceptable replacement for Heparin during the treatment of ACS and during a PCI.</seg>

<seg id="2899">"once the ACT value is more than 225 seconds, another monitoring is no longer required, provided that the 1.75 mg / kg infusion dose is administered correctly."</seg>
<seg id="2900">"in patients with moderate kidney function restriction (GFR 30-59 ml / min), which are subject to one PCI (whether treated with Bivalirudin against ACS or not), a lower infusion rate of 1.4 mg / kg / h should be used."</seg>

<seg id="2968">Insulin lulisin differs very slightly from Humanacting and the change means that it works faster and has a shorter duration as a short-acting human insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2969">Apidra was used in combination with a long-effective insulin in patients with type 1 diabetes in which the body cannot produce insulin in two studies with a total of 1 549 adults and in a study with 572 children aged between four and 17 years.</seg>
<seg id="2970">"in case of type 2 diabetes, where insulin is not processed effectively, Apidra was studied in a study of 878 adults."</seg>
<seg id="2971">The main indicator for the efficacy was the change in the concentration of the substance glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) in the blood which indicates how well the blood sugar is adjusted.</seg>
