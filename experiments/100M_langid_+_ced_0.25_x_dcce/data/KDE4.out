&quot; package &amp; package ; contains different modules for &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; despite its small size , they offer some additional functions and simplify the use of some functions of &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; by making this easier available . &quot;
further information about the use of &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; and the built @-@ in functions can be found in the manual to &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; .
&quot; to load these modules in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or , select Settings Exten@@ sions Setup ... Open the Map Card Tools and select the modules you want . &quot;
this is a list of standard setup modules from the package k@@ de ; add@@ ons . please note that any more modules are installed on your system if you have additional software installed .
&quot; you should install the k@@ de@@ base package , the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or , before comp@@ iling this package . &quot;
&quot; to use the crash module , click in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; on ex@@ tras exit . then you can view the page , the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; to crash , or the list of crashes if present . &quot;
the module viewing filter ( also called Fol@@ der filter ) can be reached in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; menu bar under Extras Viewer . with the module you can filter &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; &apos;s up @-@ to @-@ date working directory on different ways .
&quot; to use the DO@@ M tree view in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or , select Extras DO@@ M tree view ... and open a new window with the DO@@ M of the currently displayed website . as default the display starts with the root node of the document , for example : the element , all other no@@ des are sub @-@ elements of this root node . &quot;
the module &amp; FS@@ View ; for &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; represents a further view of objects with MI@@ ME type in@@ ode / directory at local files . it can be used as an alternative for the various symbol and text views so as to view the contents of your local files@@ ystem .
&quot; the peculi@@ arity of &amp; FS@@ View ; consists in representing ne@@ sted folder hierarch@@ ies with the help of a so @-@ called Tree @-@ Map graphi@@ cally . tree maps allow the representation of the size of objects in ne@@ sted structures . each object must have the property that the sum of the sizes of the subordin@@ ate objects of an object is smaller or equal to the size of the object . &quot;
&quot; with &amp; FS@@ View ; size is the size of a file or folder , whereby the size of a folder is defined as the sum of the size of the entries in it . thus , large files can be easily recognized even if it is far below in the folder hierarchy . therefore , &amp; FS@@ View ; as a graphical and interactive version of the &amp; UNIX ; command you are considered . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; FS@@ View , an entry in the Tre@@ em@@ ask representation is a rect@@ angle representing a file or folder in your files@@ ystem . for easier navigation , the rect@@ angles have meaningful color and labelling settings . &quot;
&quot; the color of a rect@@ angle , which is switched over color mode , can either display depth for easy detection of the ne@@ sting depth or the representation of another file property such as name , owner , group or MI@@ ME type . &quot;
&quot; a rect@@ angle can be lab@@ eled with the different properties of the corresponding file or folder . for each property , you can specify whether it is displayed at all or whether the area of subordin@@ ate rect@@ angles is present or whether the area of subordin@@ ate rect@@ angles can be used ( whereby the relative position of the label may appear in the rect@@ angle ) . &quot;
&quot; when setting algorithms for Tre@@ em@@ aps , the rule should be observed that the area is proportional to the size of the entry . &quot;
&quot; as divi@@ ding the area of an entry for the subordin@@ ate entries is done , the implementation will be left up . here it is advantageous for the trimm@@ ing and to prevent space losses through frames always advantageous to create rect@@ angles that are possible as quad@@ r@@ atic . the best methods in this regard are rows , columns or recur@@ sive branches . &quot;
&quot; you can specify the minimum displayed area for an entry on the view on the view on the surface . instead , a diamond pattern is drawn into the area of the higher @-@ level entry to indicate that this area is actually occupied by a subordin@@ ate entry . &quot;
&quot; originally , &amp; FS@@ View ; designed as a small test application and introduction to the use of the Tre@@ e@@ Map wid@@ gets developed for the application of K@@ C@@ ach@@ egr@@ ind . &quot;
the module gallery can be found in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; menu in the Extras gallery ... or with C@@ trl ; I .
&quot; when you visit the module gallery , you will open a dialog with which you can specify the appearance of the gallery . &quot;
the option title of the page allows you to adjust the title of the gallery page in a text input field .
the option images per line has a slider and a rot@@ ational field to set the number of mini@@ atures of each line in the gallery .

&quot; an easy @-@ to @-@ use camera interface is provided to enable you to connect to your digital camera and get your photos directly into &amp; digi@@ 2 ; more than 1000 digital cameras are supported by the library g@@ photo@@ 2 . of course , every medium and every card reader that is supported by your operating system will work with &amp; digi@@ 2 . &quot;
&quot; it comes with a fast image processing with basic training tools . you can use them to view , comment , evaluate and correct your photos . the processing capabilities can be easily extended with K@@ DE Image plug @-@ in interface ( manual ) modules . &quot;
&quot; although &amp; digi@@ kam , it is easy to use , it provides dozens of professional skills . it works completely in 16 @-@ bit color space and all available modules support the raw conversion using li@@ bra@@ w , DNG and ICC color management workflow . &quot;
&quot; improved database with much more metadata , such as &amp; eg ; via the camera or lens to be searched . &quot;
&quot; as all &amp; k@@ de ; programs are also &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; an open source project . that means , it is dependent on the support of the end user . therefore , you should report problems and improvements . &quot;
&quot; if you are in the program , the Help menu will report a page in the error reporting system . if you use these links , your web browser will open a page in the error reporting system . all required information is already registered here . just follow the instructions to send your report . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s a project supported by a community . that is , the user and developer will help each other . if you are a regular user of &amp; digi@@ kam , then we would like to answer your questions to other users of &amp; digi@@ kam . in this mailing list English is spoken , you should therefore be powerful . &quot;
you can also visit the digi@@ k ; homepage to find news about shared versions and other information about &amp; digi@@ kam .
&quot; the best start to participate in &amp; digi@@ kam , is the registration in the developer mailing list . instructions for logging in the developer mailing list by &amp; digi@@ kam . &quot;
&quot; for the first time , you &apos;ll be asked where you want to save your images and your database . simply enter a local , remote or removable folder . simply enter a name or click the Fol@@ der icon folder to select a folder . &quot;
&quot; in the second field , you must specify a local folder on your computer . here , the data ab@@ n@@ k is stored . this path remains the same for all image folders . &quot;
&quot; later , you can add as many folders as you wish . &quot;
&quot; if you already have a picture collection on your hard drive , you can specify the top folder , which contains images , as a base folder . &quot;
&quot; you can not exclu@@ de any sub@@ folders unless it i@@ ste into hidden folders . this allows you to include extra@@ cting &amp; digi@@ kam , by inser@@ ting a point in front of the name of the sub@@ folder . &quot;
&quot; if you take an existing folder with photos as a base folder , you will notice that the albums in My Al@@ ame list do not have photos as symbols . you can change them by using any photo from the album and use it on the folder icon . more details can be found in the albums section . &quot;
&quot; once you have configured the base folder , you can be able to set up your digital camera . afterwards , you should learn how to use My albums and my keyword list to manage your photos in the albums . &quot;
&quot; the support is based on the li@@ bra@@ w library . if you want to find out if a special camera is supported , you will find a list of supported shell cameras in the Help Menu Help menu . &quot;
how to set up this and work with raw files is described in the sections Ro@@ h Dec@@ oder@@ Settings and Ro@@ h workflow .
&quot; an easy @-@ to @-@ use camera interface is provided to enable you to connect to your digital camera and get your photos directly into &amp; digi@@ 2 ; more than 1000 digital cameras are supported by the library g@@ photo@@ 2 . of course , every medium and every card reader that is supported by your operating system will work with &amp; digi@@ 2 . &quot;
modern digital cameras are characterized by the use of Compact &amp; Flash ; Memory Cards and USB or Fire@@ Wire ( IEE@@ E @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) for data transmission .
&quot; g@@ Photo@@ 2 uses the Picture Transfer Protocol , a widely distributed protocol developed by the International Imaging Industry Association . it allows transferring images from digital cameras to computers and other periph@@ er@@ als without the need of additional drivers . &quot;
&quot; many old digital cameras use the serial interface for their communication with the computer . since pictures are generally large files and transm@@ issions above the serial port are slow , this connection is now dep@@ rec@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 has to be created with li@@ be@@ x@@ if support to reliably read the preview images from digi@@ K@@ am . if the Exif support is not present in lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 , you may see thumb@@ nails or the creation could be very slow . &quot;
one of the most beautiful things to &amp; digi@@ k came ; is how easy its functionality can be extended by modules :
&quot; K@@ IP@@ I modules : the K@@ DE Image plugins Interface Project ( manual ) is an approach to develop a common module structure for &amp; digi@@ kam , K@@ Photo@@ Album , Sho@@ kil@@ mg and G@@ wen@@ view . the goal is to provide the modules to all graphic programs . the settings for the K@@ IP@@ I modules are described in this section . &quot;
&quot; modules can manipul@@ ate images in virtually any way , as a user can . their advantage is that it is much simpler , &amp; digi@@ kam , by writing a small module to add a function when the changes in &amp; digi@@ kam . &quot;
&quot; to simplify the window , you can either remove the side@@ bars with &amp; L@@ MB ; remove or switch to full@@ screen mode with F@@ 11 or C@@ trl + Shift + F . &quot;
&quot; drag and drop images everywhere : you can place an image in another part of the Al@@ ben@@ bau@@ m , over the horizontal divi@@ ding line or to another application window . the only restriction is that a picture can not be stored in keywords , date list or search . &quot;
&quot; - a file type selection allows you to extract the most common : JPEG , PNG , TIFF , Ro@@ h , Movi@@ es and Audio &quot;
&quot; the text filter is only used for the fields currently displayed in the tool@@ bar . thus , the filters work on the file name only if they are displayed in the tool@@ bar . which fields can be displayed in the Al@@ ben@@ Settings dialog . &quot;
&quot; the view &amp; quot ; My Al@@ ben@@ li@@ ste@@ quot ; provides a organized view on your photo albums . all photos managed by &amp; digi@@ kam , are stored in a single Alb@@ um@@ tree . these albums can be sorted by the folders in which they were created on the hard disk , after the name of their collection in the Al@@ ame Properties or after the date on which the album was first created . the date can be changed in the properties of the album . &quot;
&quot; if you have created a scanner , you can also scan a photo directly into an album . select Album Imp@@ or@@ ate images . you can also add a screen@@ shot straight to an album . &quot;
&quot; in order to copy or move an image from one album to another , you can move the photo with the mouse to the target album and drop it there . in the then appearing menu you have to select whether the image is moved by moving or copying . simply select all the photos and move it to the target album . &quot;
&quot; an album contains a collection of photos and the album properties allow you to enter information about this collection . to access the album properties , you must click on the album right @-@ click on the album and select the Alb@@ um@@ Properties menu . &quot;
&quot; Alb@@ um@@ - Collection : are a method to mark your albums , so that you can be group@@ ed under a common name . you can select the collection from the tool@@ bar or view albums by collection . if you want to add or delete new collections , you can make it in the settings for collections . &quot;
the Album Date : will be used when you sort your albums by date with view albums by date .
&quot; buttons Ol@@ der , average , New Year : these place the date on that of the oldest , the latest image or that of the average of the album . this will first try to calculate the average of the images from their EX@@ IF information . if this fails , the date of last modification of each file is used in this folder . &quot;
&quot; if you first open an album in &amp; digi@@ k , the first image in the album is selected as a symbol for the &amp; quot ; My Al@@ ben@@ li@@ ste@@ quot ; this will help you to remember the photos on the album . sometimes the first photo in the album is not representative and you want to select another photo as a symbol . &quot;
&quot; to select another photo as an album icon , you need to click the picture with the right mouse button and select in the context menu &amp; quot ; When an album preview , select . additionally you can drag the photo to the album in the list to set it as a symbol . &quot;
an album can always be included in a collection and collections cannot be swal@@ lowed .
&quot; the collection includes all photos of the album . you can , of course , use both methods to organize your photos . &quot;
&quot; the image window provides you with the main view of your photos . if you select an album , all images are displayed in this album in the picture window . each photo will be shown in a preview , you can customize the size of this preview with the two magni@@ fiers in the tool@@ bar . &quot;
&quot; when you open an album the first time , you need to wait for short while the thumb@@ nails are generated . you can avoid this in which you can re@@ generate all thumb@@ nails in the Tools menu . &quot;
&quot; information about each image is displayed below the preview . which information is , you can change settings digit@@ ally ; set up the albums page and adjust the area thumb@@ nails to your wishes . &quot;
&quot; the thumb@@ nails have help window , which appear . if you let the mouse cur@@ sor rest at a moment over an image . the help shows the most important features including all the keywords of a photo . the screen@@ shot at the top of the introduction to the main window shows such an auxiliary window . &quot;
&quot; photos and tags allow you to organize your pictures as it suits you . editing photos shows your photos and allows you to get a number of improvements to them . you can choose between the viewing of pictures , slide show or editing of pictures . &quot;
you can open the image editing with a photo by clicking either F@@ 4 Picture Edi@@ ting ... or the context menu of the image with the right mouse button and edit ... select a manual how to edit your photos .
&quot; you can open a photo in another program by opening the context menu with the right mouse button and select the program from the File Type sub @-@ menu . for this , and how to adjust them to your needs , find info in &amp; k@@ de ; Handbuch . &quot;
&quot; some programs save this information from the EX@@ IF@@ - and IP@@ TC data , such as orientation , aper@@ ture , etc . &quot;
&quot; &amp; digi@@ kam , provides two options for rotation . the simpl@@ est thing is to click on the thumb@@ nail to preview and select turning . in the sub@@ menu you can specify the degree of rotation . &quot;
&quot; to change the filename of a photo , you can click the right mouse button on the preview and select F2 Ren@@ ame from the context menu . keep in mind that you keep the extension ( .jpg , .@@ tif , &amp; etc ; ) . &quot;
&quot; if you delete a photo from &amp; digi@@ kam , it will be moved into the tr@@ ash bin of &amp; k@@ de ; moved . F@@ 8 Photo Del@@ ete or Del if you prefer to really delete , you can use this by using Shift ; Del . &quot;
&quot; the view &amp; quot ; My Dat@@ um@@ sli@@ ste@@ quot ; organize your photos based on the data . &amp; digi@@ kam , use either the EX@@ IF date or if it is not available , the date of last modification of the file . &quot;
&quot; if you select a month from the list , all photos of this month will be shown in the image view . you can select days or weeks in the date sheet below in the date view , so that only the photos of the selected days will be shown . &quot;
&quot; keywords are sti@@ ckers that can be assigned to individual photos or entire groups . once a keyword has been assigned to a photo , the photo can be found by selecting this keyword or search again . &quot;
&quot; when a keyword is selected , all the photos marked with this keyword will be displayed . &quot;
&quot; tags can be sorted in a hierarch@@ ical tree . by doing so , you can log@@ ically organize your keywords . you can also easily find parts of the tree &amp; quot ; My keywords , so that you can easily find the keywords you are looking for . &quot;
&quot; tags are stored in a database for quick access and assigned keyword in the IP@@ TC data fields of the image , at least for JPEG , so you can also use your keywords in other programs . &quot;
&quot; you can add new keywords by using the right mouse button either on &amp; quot ; my keyword , or click on an existing keyword and then select new keyword . if you have cli@@ cked on an existing keyword , this keyword will be the sub@@ stit@@ ch@@ word of this keyword . &quot;
&quot; you can delete a keyword by clicking on the keyword with the right mouse button and select Del@@ ete . if you delete a keyword , the photo itself will not be deleted . only the keyword will be removed from this photo . &quot;
you can change the position of a keyword by drag@@ ging it to the desired position in the tree and place it there . then a menu that gives you the possibility to post@@ p@@ one the keyword . a keyword can only be in the tree at a time .
you can change the properties of a keyword by clicking on the right mouse button and edit keyword keyword . you can change the name of the keyword and the symbol in the tree &amp; quot ;
&quot; to select another photo as an album icon , select the picture with the right mouse button and select in the context menu as an album preview . in addition , you can drag the photo to the album in the list to set it as a symbol . &quot;
&quot; it can be done in two ways : as soon as you select the photos that you want to use with a keyword , you can drag them to the respective keyword in the tree &amp; quot ; &quot;
&quot; you can select a photo with any number of tags . the photo will be displayed as soon as you choose one of the keywords to it assigned tags . in this way , you can use a keyword for each person on a photo , one for the place where the photo was made , one for the event , where it was made , etc . &quot;
&quot; once you have provided a photo with keywords , this will be shown below the preview of the image in the main window . &quot;
&quot; you can remove a keyword , in which you can open the context menu of the photo with the right mouse button and select from the pop @-@ up menu . the menu only shows the tags that have been assigned to the photo . &quot;
&quot; the tim@@ eline view displays a chron@@ ogram of the number of images per time unit . a selection frame can be moved over this hist@@ ogram . to select a time frame , you only have to click on the bottom rect@@ angle of the selection frame that indicates the time unit . thus all related images are displayed in the main window . &quot;
in the field below you can enter a title and save your selection . it then appears in the list below .
&quot; all elements of the database include names , ratings , keywords , keywords , albums , collections , date stamps and in the future even more . &quot;
&quot; next to the search box , a small lamp is the green when the search hits . if you click here the filtering will be deleted and all pictures are displayed again . if the search has nothing found , then the lamp will rot . &quot;
&quot; the more advanced search tool is hidden in the tab in the left side@@ bar with the bin@@ o@@ cul@@ ars . if you open this , you can save this search here as a live search , which always filters what you have entered as a search crit@@ erion . &quot;
&quot; if you are satisfied with your choice , press OK and the search is done . the results are displayed in my search list in the main window . if you want to change your selection after searching , you just have to select the corresponding entry in my search list and select an option in its context menu . &quot;
&quot; if you select search , the form to enter the search will appear again with the search information entered . if you choose to edit an advanced search , the search will appear for the Advanced Search to change your previous search . here you can find more information in the Advanced Search section . &quot;
&quot; if you want to delete an existing search from the list , select Search in the context menu . &quot;
&quot; the Advanced Search will provide you with an extended search form with many search parameters , with which you can search in certain fields of &amp; digi@@ kam , s database . &quot;
&quot; the list of search rules is used to set the options for a search query in the Al@@ ame database . any option can be added to this list with search group / search group . any option can be added with others using the logical operations All ... , One ... , No ... or At least ... you can create searches of the type &amp; quot ; AND NI@@ CH@@ T@@ quot ; &quot;
&quot; this allows images to compare by comparing these sig@@ natures . the smaller the difference between two sig@@ natures , the more they correspond to themselves . this technique is applied in three areas . &quot;
&quot; similar entries : this is an area where you can drop any picture to find a similar . if you push a picture from anywhere via the icon of the un@@ exact search in the left side@@ bar , then it will open and you can let it fall there . &quot;
sket@@ ch : hand @-@ hand paint sket@@ ch : draw a fast sket@@ ch and &amp; digi@@ kam ; finds the right images . also here a sw@@ ell@@ factor can be set .
this tab provides an intuitive map search tool based on the Mar@@ ble mini program . you can use the mouse wheel or zoom out it and move it . move it while you click on the left mouse button . all images within these coordinates are filtered and displayed . of course this pres@@ upp@@ oses your images ge@@ o @-@ data .
in the field below you can specify a name for your ge@@ o filter . it is then added for later use of the list below . it works like a live Geo@@ Fol@@ der .
&quot; it works with all supported image data formats , also raw files , together with all supported image data formats . &quot;
&quot; select one or more pictures from any view in the main window and then use C@@ trl ; L D@@ em lamps add from the context menu . the selection will be added to the lumin@@ aire and open its window . if you are back in &amp; digi@@ k ; main windows are , you can open the lumin@@ aire quickly with L Extras Tube . &quot;
&quot; from the preview bar , you can drag the images you want to compare in the left or right pane of the window and place it there . a small arrow will show you which copy in which window area to be seen . if you preview you can preview images from the tool@@ bar and perform the shooting operations on one of the pictures , then you can compare the same area of the two pictures . &quot;
&quot; another mode is better suited to quickly select from a picture series . if you use pairs to navigate from the tool@@ bar , then the two first images will be automatically displayed to the same page . &quot;
&quot; of course , the normal sol@@ dering actions work directly from the light@@ bulb , e.g. F@@ 4 file editing .... &quot;
all image information from the right side@@ bar of the main window are available for both thumb@@ nails . this makes it easy to link visual differences with exposure data .
&quot; in the lower end of each area you will find a built @-@ in swi@@ vel function , which you can see on the crossed arrows . in order to pi@@ voting the visible area of the picture , you need to click it and hold the &amp; L@@ MB ; then both images will show the same image area . &quot;
the zo@@ oming works just like in other views . just use the zoom kno@@ b under the pictures or C@@ trl ; mouse wheel to zoom into the picture and zoom out . this happens in both pictures if you are in the mode preview .
&quot; what is a digital inventory management - apart from the fashion word ? digital inventory management considers every part of the process as follows after the image has been taken , sc@@ anned or storing digital photos performs a form of digital inventory management . most of us do not make this in a systematic and efficient way . &quot;
&quot; we give you a tool , a plan and practical tips how to back up , find , protect and use your pictures . we &apos;ll focus on the procedures for digital photographers who came and use ; use . we consider downloading , ren@@ aming , storing , evaluating , re@@ group@@ ing , archiving , optimi@@ zing , waiting and exp@@ orting image files . &quot;
&quot; &amp; quot ; Digital inventory management takes on , inde@@ xed , categ@@ orized , sec@@ ret@@ ari@@ zed , sec@@ ret@@ ari@@ zed , assembled , assembled and exported contents that have a monetary or cultural value . quot ; &quot;
metadata is defined as data about data . metadata is based on your definition data to provide information about or documentation of other data that are managed by an application or environment .
&quot; if you don &apos;t even know how many photos you have , then you don &apos;t need to know how many photos you have , then you will certainly not use &amp; digi@@ kam . the approach to store metadata in a database as well as in the image files guarantees very fast searches and secure archiving that you can freely access with other programs , platforms and formats . &quot;
&quot; your image files have to be organized on your computer . you must decide to have other access to your photos , whether you want to save them to a reserved drive , or on a network drive , etc . make sure you need to switch to a larger drive some@@ time . &quot;
&quot; vacation pictures can be quickly found on your location unless you were in one year several times in the same place . if you have enough photos , then you will use sub@@ folders such as &amp; eg ; 2008 @-@ 01 , 2008 @-@ 02 &amp; etc . export is then a folder for pictures you can print or publish on a website . &quot;
&quot; professional photographers have different requirements , e.g. version@@ ing of photos , archiving , work@@ flows , constant supply of images to different themes and a large number of everything . within 10 years , 95 % archives and 5 % work files will have and you will not want to re@@ organize your structure for this content . &quot;
what types of files fit together ? the separation of file types makes batch processing easier . separate new from old files .
the separation of original and working files makes a backup strategy and migration easier . you will always know if you are looking for an original or a deri@@ v@@ ative image .
&quot; we also recommend the metadata to save metadata from the metadata in &amp; digi@@ kam . this ensures that EX@@ IF@@ - and IP@@ TC data are written in the file . if you forget this , you can subsequently save the metadata from the database into the files by selecting the corresponding item in the menu . &quot;
&quot; now you have a lot of information in your database , but what happens if you want to change what ? to do this , &amp; digi@@ kam , provided them with a metadata editor for a number of selected attributes . of course , these are the most important . &quot;
&quot; now the real work starts , as you can now assign keywords , cap@@ tions and an assessment . of course , you can select all the images that you need the same attribute and then set the value . this makes sense , since you can concentrate on the best photos at the next work . &quot;
&quot; now let &apos;s go with keywords , keywords as you often call to other programs , or continue the categories . all three are syn@@ ony@@ ms for the same thing . &quot;
&quot; if you import catalog@@ u@@ ed images from another source with embedded keywords , then &amp; digi@@ kam , automatically build the tree for you and paste the images to the right place . &quot;
&quot; the graphic shows how different metadata can over@@ lap . this is a very rough representation , since each block of metadata consists of many sections . file names and calendar data are properties of all images . &quot;
&quot; enough of the keywords - the next section refers to labelling or comments , the third key tool to catalog@@ u@@ ing your metadata . &quot;
&quot; you don &apos;t want to let anyone see your photos simply , you want to share them with your friends , family , other photographers and agencies . &quot;
&quot; look at this panorama . from the distance there is not even a beautiful beach panorama . if you look at it closer , then you start to see some details , people , the place . &quot;
&quot; wow ! you start dre@@ aming to have associations , memories , the historic period of time is again present , you might even hear the silence . so the cap@@ tion has changed your perception of this panorama completely . &quot;
&quot; for others who look at your photos , the title may be more important than the picture itself to create an interest . if you show pictures you should tell a story . remember , the key is it the meaning to transmit the viewer to help Him about the motif that you are moving has to understand what you understand . &quot;
it is al@@ right if a picture is not perfect if it is the strength only to work with a let@@ tering for oneself alone .
&quot; with &amp; digi@@ kam , you can save as much text , in an internation@@ alised alphab@@ et ( UT@@ F @-@ 8 ) , as inscription . K@@ DE even provides you with a spell ch@@ ecker . &quot;
&quot; remember the times before GPS ? when you had to find yourself in a different city without navigation system ? wasn &apos;t it Earth a boring planet in front of Goo@@ gle@@ Earth ? well , because with pictures the train of spatial presentation now starts with light speed . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m sure that one day , in the near future , you can virtually repeat your journeys through images with geographic data . &amp; digi@@ kam , can also export k@@ ml files that you can open to Goo@@ gle@@ Earth . you can also export the images to Galler@@ y@@ 2 , Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web , Fli@@ ck@@ r &amp; etc . &quot;
&quot; Cop@@ y@@ left is a word game with copyright and design@@ ates the practice of using copy@@ rights to remove restrictions on the distribution and change of copies . the same fre@@ edoms also apply in all changed versions , so also for the work of others . &quot;
the following description tells you what information in the furniture page of &amp; digi@@ k came ; as information should be stored :
&quot; the author ( syn@@ onym for creator and author ) : this field should contain your name , or the name of the person who created the photo . if it is not desired to protect the name of the photographer , then the name of a company or organization can be used . this field does not support comm@@ as or sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ ons as separ@@ ators . &quot;
&quot; author Title ( syn@@ onym for author line ) : associated with the author . this field contains the work name of the photographer . examples for this can be titles like : employee photographer , freel@@ ance photographer or independent commercial photographer . &quot;
&quot; publisher ( syn@@ onym for providers ) : use the provider &apos;s field to identify who offers the photo . this does not necessarily have to be the author . if the photographer is a news agency such as Reuters or Associ@@ ated Press , then these organisations can be listed here . if the image is a repository , then here the group / agency that offers the picture here . &quot;
&quot; it is very important to fill the author and copyright sections , even though they do not offer protection against abuse . anyone who has a little more than basic knowledge in working with computers can delete or alter them in the image . for individuals , this is very important for most of your photos . for professionals and semi @-@ pro@@ s , this protection is very important . &quot;
the digital water@@ mark is unique per picture . &amp; digi@@ once ; will provide such a module for batch processing in the near future .
&quot; topics : plate errors , plate loss , power plugs , EC@@ C , transmission errors , aging of storage media , recovery , redund@@ ancy , disaster prevention , lifetime , temperature , data size , widespread super@@ sti@@ tions &quot;
&quot; of course , we don &apos;t talk about CDs that were lost on the street or on a fire . this type of losses are the same that can happen to you in traditional paper pictures or neg@@ atives . in this section it is about problems with the so @-@ called New Media . &quot;
&quot; K@@ roll on@@ Track , the world &apos;s largest data recovery company , has some interesting statistics which causes data loss . &quot;
&quot; to combat the problem with CDs / DVDs , you need to be treated more cau@@ tious and you can &apos;t trust any longer than a few years . of course you can also buy CDs and DVDs in archive quality which are more difficult to get and much more expensive . there are offers over Gold coated DVDs , &amp; Dollars ; 2 the piece that requires a lifetime of 100 years . &quot;
&quot; CD / DVD discs can be un@@ readable , but you can reduce this risk in which you use good discs and good recording devices and store them in the right way . so , the best DVD capture devices are not much more expensive than the cheapest , but you write a lot more reliable . &quot;
&quot; they use a control sum mechanism to protect themselves . 75 % of the data are only effective data , the rest we need for format@@ ting and check@@ sums . despite this massive protection , they are used by chemical aging , ultra@@ violet light , scrat@@ ches , dust &amp; etc . &quot;
&quot; for defective CDs and DVDs , there is a cheap program called I@@ so@@ Bu@@ ster that seems to cause wonder in CDs and DVDs . it runs under Windows and &amp; Linux ; it is not yet available for Mac@@ s . there are also similar applications to read the damaged data from damaged disks , hard disks , flash drives , USB drives , etc . &quot;
&quot; optical media : Blu @-@ ray discs seem to capture the format war against HD DVD . a dual @-@ layer Blu @-@ ray disc can save 50 GB , and thus almost six times the capacity of a dual @-@ layer DVD with 8.5 GB . &quot;
&quot; do not forget to copy the data to the next generation of media before reading the latest piece of hardware or software that can read these media . &quot;
&quot; disc@@ othe@@ ers retain their stats for themselves . their manufacturer &apos;s antioxid@@ ants include a new disk , but not the data . Google will provide a large field study on the error mechanisms of hard drives : flo@@ ppy Study &quot;
&quot; in brief : dis@@ cos hold the longest if you are operated in temperature range from 35 ° C to 45 ° C . at lower temperature procedures , the error rate increases dramatically . electronic parts of the controller are the most common error cause , SMAR@@ T can fail to notice these errors . &quot;
&quot; this is only the complete loss due to over@@ voltage . of course , you can also recover data loss due to a power failure before you have backed the files , but these losses can usually be restored without major problems . &quot;
&quot; while most electrical devices don &apos;t make a lot of power , it looks different on devices with computer chips and high @-@ speed processors . these can cause heavy damage . therefore , these an@@ om@@ ali@@ es can cause serious damage , hardware aging , destroyed mother@@ boards and other defects . &quot;
&quot; the most common protection against stro@@ kes is an over@@ voltage protection . this is a device that absor@@ bs a part of the energy slots and gro@@ unded the rest . however , remember that not every connector bar also contains an over@@ voltage protection . &quot;
&quot; if you are looking for an over@@ voltage protection , you should make sure that it meets the UL 14@@ 49 standard . this guarantees a certain minimum of protection . you should also make sure that it offers protection against lightning strikes , thereby protecting the properly connected devices . &quot;
&quot; since there is an over@@ voltage of each cable to your computer , you should make sure that all periph@@ er@@ als connected to your system can also be protected . some manufacturers provide over@@ voltage distribution , which also includes a telephone connection for your modem . others offer connectivity options for the co@@ axial cable of the cable mode@@ ms and the television card . &quot;
&quot; if you have a not@@ ebook , you will need a portable over@@ voltage protection . a variety of these devices are designed specifically for not@@ ebooks , and therefore very small and they also contain the protection for the modem . &quot;
&quot; while an over@@ voltage protection protects your system from minor fluctu@@ ations in the power lines , it will not really help you with a complete failure . even a failure of a few seconds can lead to the loss of irre@@ plac@@ eable data . it can therefore be useful to invest in an inter@@ ruption @-@ free power supply . &quot;
&quot; apart from over@@ voltage protection , these devices can automatically provide battery power when a power out@@ age occurs . this gives you the opportunity to save your data and keep the system ordered . if you purchase a US@@ V , you should be sure that they meet the same quality requirements as an over@@ voltage protection . furthermore , the lifetime of the battery and the accompanying software is interesting . &quot;
&quot; consider the potential risk that your computer system is exposed and compare your security with the cost of avoiding this . a high @-@ quality over@@ voltage protection can get you up to &amp; euro ; 20 cost , A 500@@ W US@@ V can be used for less than &amp; euro ; 40 . &quot;
&quot; the Amazon Web @-@ Service includes S3 - Simp@@ le Storage Service - a simple storage service . with the right configuration , you can use it as a drive under &amp; Linux ; , Mac , and Windows . this allows you to use it as backup destination for your software . Google Shar@@ ed Storage is another popular offer to store any amount of data . &quot;
&quot; you are however very expensive compared to the hard drives at home , however very expensive - 40 GB costs &amp; dollars ; 75 per year and 400 GB cost &amp; dollars ; 500 . in addition , you have to send the data over the compar@@ atively slow internet . &quot;
&quot; the solutions are therefore only suitable as a solution against a local data loss of the most important images . it is not a bad solution , but it is not a general backup solution . &quot;
&quot; Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web ( Google ) , Fli@@ ck@@ r ( Yahoo ) and the photo community 23@@ h@@ q@@ .com provide online storage services available to photos . your free storage is limited to 1 GB and you will not want to have your images in full resolution Online . for 25 $ a year you get unlimited storage , which should be checked in reality . &quot;
&quot; from the perspective of data backup , the web @-@ solutions are very safe . transmission errors are automatically cleaned thanks to the TCP protocol and are included in the offer a backup and a distributed buffer . &quot;
&quot; the diagram illustrates the elements of the transmission chain in the machine . all transfers are sus@@ cep@@ tible to transmission errors . the file system z@@ fs and B@@ tr@@ fs , at least , ensure data integrity between operating system and hard disk . &quot;
&quot; the worst thing about it is that no one says if a transmission error occurred , not when it happened in your hardware . all these faul@@ ts remain un@@ discovered until one day is open to your surprise . no one seems to have thought about it . no one seems to have thought about it . the Internet using its TCP protocol is a much safer data way than that in your computer . &quot;
un@@ reliable power supplies are another source of transmission losses as they generate inter@@ ferences within the data streams . in normal file systems these errors remain un@@ noticed .
&quot; even if you are not particularly affected by the transmission problems , you should look into the future . already 2010 you will see thousands of errors per year . &quot;
&quot; Z@@ FS of Sun Micro@@ systems seems to be one of two candidates who are able to handle and highly scal@@ able with record errors . it is open source , with many patents and is available under a GP@@ L in@@ compatible license for Solaris and Leopard . we can only hope that it will be available for &amp; Linux ; and Windows . read this article in English . &quot;
Oracle has launched its own initiative with its B@@ tr@@ fs files@@ ystem . this is still in alpha status . it uses the same protection mechanisms the z@@ fs uses and is also available for &amp; Linux ; it is not yet part of the kernel .
&quot; do not under@@ estimate this ! these two factors are responsible for 86 % of data loss in the not@@ ebook and 46 % in the workplace systems . in not@@ ebooks , the share of theft is already 50 % . &quot;
&quot; data loss due to viruses is less common than most people think . it is currently limited to Microsoft systems ; Apple users know very few viruses and under &amp; Linux , and no longer has been si@@ ghted . &quot;
&quot; open source file systems are less sus@@ cep@@ tible to data loss as proprietary systems : wrong , NT@@ FS is minimal better than ext@@ 3 , Reiser@@ FS , J@@ FS and X@@ FS to name the most common file systems . &quot;
&quot; journ@@ aling file systems prevent corrupt data and data loss : wrong , only the speed of the investigation process during an operation is higher and an un@@ defined status will be avoided . if a file has not been completely saved before the problem occurred , it is lost . &quot;
viruses are the biggest threat to digital data : false , theft and human error are the main causes for data loss . &quot;
sensors from digital cameras are 1 @-@ 2 f @-@ stops from fundamental physical limits . this means that while the technology continues to develop there is a natural limit for this progress . sensitivity and noise characteristics for all types of light sensors are no longer distant from this limit .
&quot; today &apos;s cameras go in the direction of 10 meg@@ api@@ xel sensors . even if this resolution is too high for compact cameras and the end result , the optimum for compact cameras . even DSLR cameras have your limit at 10 @-@ 12 meg@@ api@@ x@@ els . for higher resolutions , you need a full @-@ format sensor ( 24x@@ 36@@ mm ) or larger formats . &quot;
&quot; you get a 750@@ GB hard disk today for 100 &amp; euro ; so don &apos;t make anybody else responsible for data loss . 6 % of all PCs are affected by a data loss in every year . so , backup your data frequently according to a plan and test this backup before you make any more dangerous such as re@@ installing your operating system , replacing plates or the res@@ izing of disks . &quot;
&quot; suppose you make your f@@ uses on an external SATA drive every day . if , then one day , a flash hits you lucky if the drive was not connected at the moment . &quot;
&quot; a disaster strikes local and destro@@ ys a lot . forget air@@ planes : fire , water , electricity , children and theft are dangerous enough for your data . they usually affect a whole space or the entire house . &quot;
&quot; therefore , disaster prevention means always a non @-@ local storage . bring your back@@ ups up the stairs , into the neighboring house , into your office or similar . &quot;
&quot; there is another advantage of physical separation : as mentioned above is a common reason for a data loss despite securing the panic . if you have a backup that is not immediately available , then you can save that one day . &quot;
complete backup : a complete backup of all files to be saved . it is a snap@@ shot without history and represents a complete copy at a time .
differenti@@ ating : a backup of the files that have been changed since the last complete backup . creates a complete snap@@ shot at two times : the complete backup and the final differentiation .
&quot; incre@@ mental backup : a backup of the files that have been changed since the last backup . generate multiple snap@@ shots . you can restore the original status at any time when such a backup has been made . this backup comes to an version@@ ing system closest , except that it is only checked and not ongoing . &quot;
&quot; r@@ sync is a wonderful small tool that lets you easily set up on your machines . unlike script @-@ controlled FTP meetings or other types of file transfer scripts , r@@ sync only copies the difference of files that have really been changed . this happens and if you want to increase security over ss@@ h . &quot;
save important images directly after you have stored them on your computer on a DVD or a different visual medium .
&quot; at the end , you have a complete daily version of the last 7 @-@ 14 days , a weekly snap@@ shot for at least one month and a snap@@ shot for each month . &quot;
&quot; metadata , stored in the image file , stored IP@@ TC information , associated X@@ MP files , original keeping , memory , scal@@ ability , media , re@@ viewing images and metadata , copying images to the next generation of media , applications , operating systems , virtualization , visual devices ... , use of the Internet . &quot;
&quot; so that valuable images survive the next 40 years , that is about the time span in which you really are interested in you because they remind you of your childhood or youth , there are two strategies that should be considered : &quot;
&quot; as the future is un@@ predic@@ table due to your nature , you need to look at all that is said today with caution and re@@ evaluate while time passes . unfortunately , there is no other way to wal@@ low as a certain vig@@ il@@ ance . the less variants you have used in the past , the easier it is to evaluate the questions of the future . &quot;
this question should actually be answered by the explanations in this document . use or switch to open standards that are supported by many applications .
virtualization is available today for everyone . so if you have an old system that is important to read your images then keep it up and install it in a virtual machine for later use .
&quot; on the other hand , the Council is quite simple : every time you change your computer architecture , storage and backup technology , or change your file format , you should check your library and if necessary to convert to a newer standard . stay with open standards . &quot;
scal@@ ability is the print provider for the possibility to change a system in its size .
let &apos;s assume that you have entered the scal@@ ability with you and you want to enlarge the area you want to have on a dedicated disk or partition .
&quot; check with the command d@@ mes@@ g , whether your new disk was detected by the system , but do not hang it . &quot;
&quot; dd if = / dev / s@@ db &#91; # &#93; of = / dev / sd@@ c # source is / dev / s@@ db , the new record is / dev / sd@@ c &amp; Dollar ; Part@@ ed res@@ ize / dev / sd@@ c@@ 1 0 &amp; lt ; Size of disk in MB@@ s ; # works with ext@@ 2.3 , F@@ AT@@ 16 , 32 and rei@@ ser@@ fs &amp; dollars ; res@@ iz@@ e@@ 2@@ fs / dev / sad@@ c@@ 1 # to change the size of rei@@ ser@@ fs if necessary &quot;
&quot; open source standards have the great advantage of an open specification . even if one day there is no more software that can read , then you can create it yourself . this task is easier from year to year . &quot;
&quot; GIF is a proprietary , patented format that slowly dis@@ appears from the market . therefore , you should not use it anymore . &quot;
&quot; it is loss@@ less , supports X@@ MP , Ex@@ in@@ f and IP@@ TC metadata , 16 @-@ bit per colour channel and full transparency . &quot;
&quot; TIFF was widely used as picture format . TIFF can be stored in un@@ compressed form or in a container with a loss@@ less compression algorithm ( DE@@ FL@@ ATE ) . it manages images in high quality , but requires very large files . &quot;
DNG The Digital Neg@@ ative File Format is a roy@@ alty @-@ free and open raw image format developed by Adobe Systems . DNG was developed on the TIFF / EP format and is committed to use metadata .
&quot; this is possibly one of the reasons why , in 2001 , Adobe has introduced its XML @-@ based X@@ MP technology to replace the &amp; quot ; Exten@@ sible Metad@@ ata Plat@@ form@@ quot ; a mixture of XML and R@@ DF . it is a label technology that allows users to em@@ bed their data into a file itself . &quot;
&quot; many photographers prefer to archive a original of your recording , mostly in the raw format , as it stores metadata separately from the image file . however , it can cause problems when linking between the metadata file and the image file . therefore , you should consider whether you use DNG as a container and put it together there . &quot;
&quot; the Dublin Core Metad@@ ata Initiative is an open organisation dedicated to fully compatible online metadata standards that support a wide range of applications and business models . D@@ CM@@ I &apos;s activities include the work on the D@@ CM@@ I communities and the D@@ CM@@ I working groups , annual conferences and educational efforts to achieve far @-@ reaching acceptance of metadata standards and practices . &quot;
&quot; import images from the camera , the card reader or the scanner . as long as the images are on the camera amedi@@ um , you can use this as a temporary backup . &quot;
convert shell files to DNG and save it in your shell archive . this function is not yet implemented .
&quot; for fine editing , you can use external programs . if you re @-@ edit the images with &amp; digi@@ kam , then you should add the metadata again . &quot;
&quot; use the processed images for copyright with a digital water@@ mark . export them first to web galleries , code in MPEG , use in contact sheets , print &amp; etc ; &quot;
&quot; the camera interface is not the only way to get your photos in &amp; digi@@ kam . in the Ad@@ ding a Photo to an album , you can add a description of how you can add photos that you have already on your hard drive . however , the camera interface provides you with many advanced settings to import images to your disk database . &quot;
&quot; to use your digital camera with &amp; digi@@ kam , connect them to the computer , turn the camera to the display mode and turn it on . another description of this can be found in the manual of your camera . &quot;
&quot; some cameras do not display thumb@@ nails . if this is the case , the fil@@ en@@ ames and a symbol for file association settings for each file , photos , movies , music etc. are displayed on the camera . &quot;
&quot; before you download the photos on your computer , you may need the camera information for each entry . with the side bars properties and metadata from the camera interface , you can see the properties of an entry or its metadata . &quot;
this dialog displays file properties and the photo information that is stored internally by the camera . a symbol indicates that the image has not yet been downloaded to your computer . note that some digital cameras do not have all the information available .
&quot; metadata indicates the internal metadata such as Exif , manufacturer &apos;s note , GPS and so on . this information is the same as the metadata side bar from the main window of &amp; digi@@ kam , or editing . note that these metadata is not available for some digital cameras . &quot;
&quot; the easiest way to download photos on your computer is the click to download and then download the selection of All . this loads all photos from your camera to a single album in &amp; digi@@ k ; . when downloading , the photos will not be deleted and we recommend you to check if the pictures are securely downloaded into an album before you delete the photos from the camera . &quot;
&quot; if you don &apos;t want to download all photos , you can only select the desired with the default select methods from &amp; k@@ de ; once you have selected the photos , use the button download and then download S@@ elected . the S@@ elected download is th@@ aw@@ ed as long as you have selected some photos . &quot;
&quot; if your camera supports this , a New Download option is available . these images have been downloaded not yet from &amp; digi@@ . in this case the new pictures are displayed with a star in the preview window . if you choose this option , of course only the new pictures are downloaded . &quot;
&quot; the list of existing albums is displayed , how normal folders are sorted , displayed . the list of existing albums is sorted , how normal folders are sorted , displayed . the list of the existing albums can be read in section My albums . then select the target album from the list and press OK . &quot;
&quot; after you selected the target album , press OK , and &amp; digi@@ kam , invites the photos from the camera to the album . &quot;
&quot; once you have downloaded the desired photos , you can delete them from the camera . you can all delete them by using the Del@@ ete Clear button . if you want to delete only some , you have to select it first and then delete S@@ elected S@@ elected . &quot;
&quot; please note that there is no way to restore photos that you have deleted from the camera . so you should carefully check if the photos were successfully deleted from the camera . if you want to delete the camera finder completely , you should do it over the camera , as this is much faster . &quot;
&quot; the fil@@ en@@ ames are usually re@@ used once the photos from the camera are deleted . this can lead to double file names , if you upload photos of different recording mini@@ stries into the same album . therefore it can be useful , the date and the time when the picture was made to integrate into the file name . &quot;
&quot; in the next section you will find options for turning and mirrors of the image and for file @-@ based sub@@ mit@@ ories . if you use this latter option , you will automatically create a folder per day . &quot;
&quot; the options Dur@@ ing the transfer will open three more options to be performed before the photos are stored on the disk . the first two are the data about the author in the default Aut@@ ori@@ denti@@ ty section . if you select this , the corresponding entries will be copied from the Exif information into the IP@@ TC fields . with the last option you can correct date &amp; time for all downloaded images . &quot;
&quot; for example , if you want to use another date format than the default format , you can use the pre@@ fix phot@@ o- % y@@ - % d % H : % M : % M : % M : % S . for more adjustments , you should read the help of the str@@ f@@ time command . &quot;
&quot; if you use the option Camera fil@@ en@@ ames , you have the option to change the file names in lower case letters . or in upper@@ case letters , if you prefer this . &quot;
&quot; the new filename , the &amp; digi@@ k ; used for a photo , is displayed below the name that the camera provides in the preview . your settings to ren@@ ame will be saved and automatically used when you open the camera window next time . &quot;
&quot; not all cameras provide this information . in the Metad@@ ata section , you can read more details about the information that your camera embedded in the photo . &quot;
&quot; automatic rotation is normally switched on , and if your camera does not deliver this information , the photo in the original orientation . if you want to turn off automatic rotation , use the Advanced tab and choose the automatic rotation at the bottom of the window . &quot;
&quot; if your camera provides information about the date on which the photo was made available , &amp; digi@@ kam , use it to automatically upload sub @-@ albums in the target album . all pictures with the same date are available in the same sub@@ album . in the section page header Meta data , you can read what information your camera could have embedded in the photos . &quot;
&quot; this option is usually off @-@ off , and in this case it stores &amp; digi@@ once ; the photos directly in the target album . if you want to change this , you need to switch this option . use the Advanced and select the option Date based sub@@ mit@@ es at the bottom of the window . &quot;
the easiest way to load photos from your computer to your camera is the download button . then select Up@@ load . the file selection dialog &amp; k@@ de ; appears where you can select the files that should be uploaded . you can also select more than one file with the default &amp; k@@ de ; methods .
&quot; after the selection is done , asks &amp; digi@@ kam , you where the images are to be uploaded . a folder sel@@ ector dialog appears for the camera . select the folder you want and press OK to start the upload . the images will not be deleted from your computer . &quot;
&quot; GPS ( Global Posi@@ tioning System ) is used as a general term in this document . this means a position that can be displayed in long@@ itude and latitude , and can be displayed on a map . identification of the data can be performed by the American GPS , the Russian GL@@ ON@@ AS , the European G@@ ALI@@ LE@@ O or any other system . &quot;
&quot; not only for professional photographers it can be interesting to link a picture with a precise geographic location . not everyone uses an air@@ plane to navigate an area by automatic recording of GPS data . environmental plann@@ ers , military , police , architectural offices and real estate agents can use this ability . &quot;
&quot; if you forgot about where exactly the photo was made , you can open a browser with a click that indicates the area . if you want to send a postcard to another , or just want to document the location of the photo , or just want to document this aspect , it is good to save the position data of a photo . &quot;
&quot; the question is how to get the GPS data in the picture ? first , you should know that ex@@ iv@@ 2 supports many GPS data fields such as the direction , se@@ at@@ posts and map references . there are at least three ways to achieve this . &quot;
&quot; as far as we know , there is currently no camera that has integrated a GPS unit . but there are a few who work with GPS recei@@ vers . either as a card module or by transm@@ itting the data with a cable or Bluetooth . &quot;
cameras with GPS interface : Co@@ y@@ ot@@ e@@ Eye i@@ PA@@ Q I@@ ke Ko@@ da@@ k D@@ CS Pro Nikon DSLR Ric@@ oh Pro G3 Sony
&quot; downloading the GPS data from one device can be done with g@@ ps@@ man or g@@ ps@@ b@@ abel . however , you need to save these data in g@@ p@@ x format as this is the only format supported by the module for geographic mapping . &quot;
there are various programs for &amp; Windows ; and Mac OS that can extract and cor@@ relate the data from images and GPS . on the following page you can do the same under &amp; Linux ; make : g@@ ps@@ Cor@@ r or g@@ ps@@ Photo
&quot; if you know the long@@ itude and latitude or other data , you can use this script that works with the Ex@@ if@@ Tool by Phil Har@@ vey . it uses the em@@ odi@@ ous coordinates , which are created e.g. by map@@ s.@@ google . &quot;
&quot; map@@ s.@@ google.com does not show any European road maps . here are some European pages , at least in French , German and Spanish , which show all navigation details for Europe . &quot;
&quot; the settings dialog box is divided into eight pages . you can switch between them by clicking on the icons of the left side . &quot;
&quot; action can be selected for previ@@ ew@@ ed previ@@ ew@@ ing or editing image editing , so you set the default behavior from &amp; digi@@ kam , if you click on an entry in the main view . &quot;
&quot; this page contains , as shown below , the standardi@@ zation and copyright data . these data are automatically written in the corresponding IP@@ TC data fields if the option was selected when downloading from the camera interface . even in case of a database synchron@@ ization , these data are written in the IP@@ TC fields . &quot;
&quot; author Title is a syn@@ onym for the author line : this field should contain the profession of the photographer . this can be desig@@ nations such as a photographer , freel@@ ance photographer or independent , commercial photographer . since this is a more detailed description of the car field , it must be filled . &quot;
&quot; publisher is a syn@@ onym for providers : use this field to give the photo to the photo . this does not have to be the author , if this is available for a news agency such as Reuters or Associ@@ ated Press , then these organizations should be registered here , then the group and agency that provides the image will be enum@@ er@@ ated here . &quot;
the IP@@ TC actions store the data in the corresponding IP@@ TC field@@ s. this allows metadata to be permanently included in the image and not only in the database of &amp; digi@@ kam . these metadata also includes other programs and can be imported into &amp; digi@@ k ; imported without lost .
&quot; save images as embedded in@@ scrip@@ tions ( J@@ FI@@ F ) in JPEG images : this synchron@@ izes the comments you add to your photos , with the cap@@ tions embedded in the pictures . &quot;
&quot; the Settings page contains all the options for the information appearing when the mouse poin@@ ter is in the main window over a file . depending on the selected option , this information is displayed or not . &quot;
&quot; &amp; # 160 ; digi@@ kam , supports a number of different image formats and some video and audio formats . to specify which file types &amp; digi@@ kam , you can add and remove file extensions of this list . &quot;
you can reset the default settings again by pressing the button Update at the right of each category .
&quot; some images have different sizes and the synchron@@ ous mode is then not available . however , some images have different sizes and the synchron@@ ous mode is then not available . the option &amp; quot ; In the whole picture size lad@@ en@@ quot ; if you have one , then you can get better reviews . &quot;
&quot; by default , the image processing uses a black background behind the displayed photos . if you prefer a different color , you can select it here . you can turn off the tool@@ bar when you use the image processing in full screen mode . &quot;
&quot; over@@ - and under@@ exposed areas of an image can be marked with dark or bright color in the image . these colors are specified here . in the image processing , this view mode can be switched on and off with F@@ 10 and F@@ 11 . &quot;
&quot; with Chro@@ ma sub@@ sampling , this means that the images are enco@@ ded in higher resolution than in color formations . please read this article in Wikipedia for closer explanation . &quot;
&quot; with the PNG compression setting , you can reduce the size of PNG files . this operation does not reduce image quality since PNG uses a loss@@ less algorithm . if you have a quick calcul@@ ator , you can set this value to high compression . this means 1 : a low and 9 high compression . &quot;
&quot; to comp@@ ress TIFF files , you can turn the DE@@ FL@@ ATE compression algorithm for TIFF photos . this reduces the size of the TIFF photos . it does not affect the image quality because the DE@@ FL@@ ATE algorithm works without loss . &quot;
&quot; with the loss @-@ free JPEG 2000 files you can save loss@@ less . even if you select loss @-@ ha@@ iry settings , the ratio between quality loss and file size is far better than normal JPEG . when this paragraph is written , metadata has not yet been supported , but was in the planning . &quot;
&quot; in previous versions of &amp; digi@@ kam , image editing was only a picture viewer for photos . currently , it develops very quickly to a tool to manipul@@ ate your photos . with this dialog you can change the settings of the image editing . &quot;
&quot; standard acceptance is that all green pixels are equal . if the straight @-@ line green pixels of the CCD sensor react more sensitive to ultra@@ violet light than the pixels with odd lines , this difference is a little soft , elimin@@ ates the 2x@@ 2 grid pattern with the V@@ N@@ G@@ - or the A@@ HD quality method . &quot;
&quot; if this option is set , the white balance is used . otherwise , if set , the automatic colour balance is used . &quot;
&quot; this setting is used only if the white balance is not set . standard is to use a fixed color balance , based on a white card that was photograph@@ ed in the sunlight . &quot;
this setting is only supported for Fu@@ ji Super CCD SL@@ R cameras . using the second sensors has the effect that under@@ exposed images will get more details in four steps . for other cameras this option will be ignored .
&quot; the default is the spot@@ lights , so the parts of your images are the ones that are burned due to the in@@ ability of your camera to view the more advanced white in the settings . finally , you can try to re@@ construct some parts of the missing information from the top lights . &quot;
&quot; this is possible because blue pixels are generally not as fast as green and red . &amp; digi@@ kam , and d@@ cra@@ w therefore try to re@@ construct the missing green and red portions from the still uns@@ atur@@ ated blue pixels . of course this is a question of how much color or white you want . &quot;
&quot; if you select the option re@@ construct the option , you get the option to set a level . here is a value of three a compromise and can / should therefore be customized for each image individually . &quot;
&quot; set the lumin@@ ance value to your taste . you probably have to set it slightly higher than the default 1 . however , this can be done later in the image options of the &amp; digi@@ k ; to keep the time for the Dem@@ os@@ a@@ icing small , you should proceed conserv@@ atively . &quot;
&quot; a Dem@@ os@@ a@@ icing algorithm is a digital image process to calculate a complete image from the partial raw data , which come from the color @-@ filtered image sensor that many cameras have and which provides a matrix of colored pixels . this algorithm is also known as C@@ FA inter@@ pol@@ ation or color construction . &quot;
&quot; and D@@ cra@@ w gives you three alternatives : bil@@ ine@@ ar , V@@ NG inter@@ pol@@ ation and A@@ HD inter@@ pol@@ ation . after some tests it looks like this . V@@ NG inter@@ pol@@ ation ( for Adap@@ tive Hom@@ ogen@@ ei@@ ty @-@ Direc@@ ted ) was the first algorithm used by D@@ cra@@ w . bil@@ ine@@ ar is interesting if you are looking for a quick solution with an acceptable result . &quot;
&quot; if you know the color devi@@ ation of your lenses , you can set the red and blue correction values here . this is certainly the best method for a color sof@@ ten@@ ing correction , as you are carried out during the trial . &quot;
&quot; a profile translat@@ es the color information and gives instructions how to be given again . there are also L@@ CMS and &amp; digi@@ kam , information such as colour information from a colour space to translate to the other so that the colors are as accurate as possible . &quot;
&quot; questions , when an image is opened in the image processing / color management module with raw files . &quot;
&quot; set here the folder , such as / usr / share / color / ICC or / home / user / .@@ color / ICC , where you all save your profiles . &quot;
settings of the ICC profiles You have here the option &amp; quot ; standard squ@@ ot ; to deposit for your profiles . everything can be changed when opening the shell file .
the color management view is an alternative to X@@ cali@@ b or Ar@@ gy@@ ll . here are only your pictures color @-@ managed not the entire screen .
&quot; the input profiles should match to the camera manufacturer and model you use . not all profiles are created in the same way . there are some , like e.g. Canon , which do not have color tones mapping or g@@ amma correction . this means that you have to perform the color setting yourself . &quot;
&quot; there are other options such as the Soft Pro@@ of profile , which you can em@@ ulate as your image would be given back from one device . this is very useful before you print the picture , as your printer has a smaller color range than your camera and some colors therefore can be very saturated , rather than rely on the blind algorithm of your printer . &quot;
&quot; for most cameras , it is quite obvious which colour profile is intended for . unfortunately not with the models of Canon . therefore , here is a table of cameras and profiles that fit together . of course this answer is un@@ official : &quot;
&quot; the Canon profile extension leaves the style for the target : F for an exact style , L for landscapes , N for neutral , P for portrait and S for standard style . &quot;
&quot; K@@ IP@@ I is the &amp; k@@ de ; image plugin interface . it is an interface supported by a number of &amp; k@@ de ; image viewers and image editing . by providing this interface , &amp; digi@@ kam , many modules support that were written to work together with any program that the K@@ IP@@ I interface supports . &quot;
&quot; if your distribution has installed the K@@ IP@@ I modules , you will see a list of the available modules . &quot;
&quot; sub@@ commands for tasks executed by modules can be set in the menu , under Settings Short@@ cuts . &quot;
more information ( in English ) about K@@ IP@@ I modules can be obtained from the K@@ IP@@ I project at http : / / www.@@ ki@@ pi @-@ plug@@ ins@@ .org or in the manuals of the K@@ IP@@ I modules .
&quot; the settings of the slide show should be easy to understand . the upper regul@@ ator adjusting the time between the image transi@@ tions , usually 4 @-@ 5 seconds . the other check boxes turn on the metadata and / or that are displayed at the bottom of the images during the display . &quot;
&quot; the camera features display a list of all the currently supported cameras on the left side . on the right side there is a button Automatic Det@@ ection , which tries to identify a camera connected to the computer . below are the port settings . currently , serial , USB and USB / Fire@@ Wire storage is supported . &quot;
&quot; at the bottom end , you can set the path for USB and Fire@@ Wi@@ re@@ - ( IEE@@ E @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) mass storage cameras . you have to specify the path , / m@@ nt / camera or / m@@ nt / Rem@@ ov@@ able , where you mount your camera . &quot;
&quot; to use your digital camera with &amp; digi@@ kam , you need to connect the camera to your computer , bring them into the display mode and switch on . &quot;
&quot; try ob &amp; digi@@ once ; the camera automatically det@@ ects . if not , you can manually set camera model and port manually . after you set up your camera , your camera will appear in the camera . &quot;
&quot; you can select any name for your camera . if you have more than one camera , you can paste it here . &quot;
&quot; with the confirmation dialog for moving images in the sleeve heads , you can view the conversation of &amp; digi@@ kam , while del@@ eting a photo in an album . in the sections del@@ eting a photo and delete an album , you will find more details . &quot;
&quot; editorial changes through the right side bar can be tac@@ itly supported by &amp; digi@@ kam , if you use the option to apply changes to the right side@@ bar without any feedback . otherwise you need to save the changes with the button changes . &quot;
you can also display the welcome screen from &amp; digi@@ kam . this speeds up the starting process from &amp; digi@@ kam .
&quot; if something from the base folder has been deleted , asks &amp; digi@@ kam , whether it should delete it from the database . &quot;
different color schemes can be used in &amp; digi@@ k ; you can choose to customize the main window to your taste . these settings can be selected under Settings Design from the tool@@ bar . preview of the available designs is listed below :
&quot; these designs have been defined in simple text files . if you are interested in creating a new design for &amp; digi@@ kam , you will find more information about this in this tutorial . &quot;
you can use them to view your photos and to correct and improve . editing can be started by clicking with the left mouse button on the preview of an image or through the pop @-@ up menu of the entry / edit item .
&quot; the image processing contains a number of tools to improve your images . some of them are available as modules in &amp; digi@@ kam , so you may not be part of your distribution . you can find more information about the K@@ IP@@ I modules in the editing section . &quot;
&quot; status bar at the bottom of the window , the filename , current file number , magni@@ fication factor and the current image size . &quot;
a menu bar at the top edge and below the tool@@ bar for quick access to the most frequently required functions .
&quot; editing functions will change your photos . however , none of the functions will change the original photo before you have used the save or the save from the tool@@ bar . note that you can &apos;t restore the original photo anymore once you have saved the image . &quot;
&quot; so , you should create a copy of your image before you change it . this can be done with File Save as . &quot;
&quot; as long as you have not saved the photo , you can restore the original image by using the File Rest@@ ore or the button The button re@@ producing image editing in the tool@@ bar . you will then lose any change that you have done in the photo since the last store . &quot;
&quot; virtually any action of the image processing can be revers@@ ed or restored . the last action can be revers@@ ed by selecting either undo / restore , using the Edit Rec@@ over from the menu . &quot;
&quot; if you use this often , you should reset the keyboard short@@ cut , C@@ trl ; -@@ Z for return and restore C@@ trl ; -@@ Shift @-@ Z to restore . &quot;
&quot; if you press the &amp; L@@ MB ; press a moment longer via the Return or Rest@@ ore button in the tool@@ bar , you will receive a contex@@ tual menu . if you select one of the menu entries , all actions in between will also be revers@@ ed or restored in between . &quot;
&quot; once you have started editing , you can move between the photos in the same album or keyword by using the navigation buttons in the tool@@ bar , image high , image down or the entries in the File menu . if you have made changes to the current photo , you &apos;ll be asked if you want to save them . &quot;
you can enter the photo and zoom in the c@@ trl ; mouse wheel or the icons in the tool@@ bar or the entries in the tutorial menu .
&quot; to customize a photo to the window size , you can use this button in the tool@@ bar : magni@@ fying factor automatically &quot;
&quot; view full screen mode displays the photo in full screen mode . you come into the normal view in which you use the Es@@ c key . if you do not want it , you can use it in the Settings dialog by &amp; digi@@ kam . see the section for setting the image editing . &quot;
&quot; if you want to print the current image , you can select the image in the File menu and get the default &amp; k@@ de ; print dialog . you can adjust the settings here before you print your photo . &quot;
&quot; from the main menu , you can print single pictures or whole sets . all image templates can be printed out of your choice . you only have to select the images with the standard methods and select from the menu Album Export Com@@ pression Wiz@@ ard . if you follow the wiz@@ ard , you just need to make your choice . &quot;
&quot; the main window has a side@@ bar at the right edge , which provides important information and actions for the selected images . the same page bar , without navigation arrows , is also available in editing . it is displayed when one of the five riders is cli@@ cked : &quot;
multiple clicking on the same tab allows the page bar to appear or disappear again into the edge .
&quot; in the labelling view , you can enter or insert cap@@ tions with unlimited size . the text is UT@@ F @-@ 8 compatible . this means that all special characters are allowed . the cap@@ tions are copied to the EX@@ IF@@ - and IP@@ TC fields so that you can be used by other programs . &quot;
the IP@@ TC data only support ASCII characters and are limited to 2000 characters . all comments are cut to 2000 characters and special characters are changed . if you want to use the IP@@ TC labelling box in other applications you should consider these limitations .
&quot; after you have commented on it , use either the user button or simply switch to the next image , the cap@@ tions are then stored . &quot;
&quot; besides the user kno@@ b , there is a button More . with this you can read more metadata from the selected file or the database . however , you can also write the metadata into the files . this is always done when you choose a metadata setting that is always written in the images . &quot;
&quot; the review section displays a rating scheme from 0 to 5 stars and can be used in search and sorting . it can be applied either with a single mouse click on the 5 stars into the page bar or using the short@@ cut C@@ trl + 0 ... 5 . to evaluate multiple images simultaneously , select it and use the context menu . &quot;
the evaluation is written in the IP@@ TC field of ur@@ gency . the code follows the scheme in the following table :
&quot; the keyword index shows a search box for filtering the keywords , the keyword tree and a selection box with the keywords used previously in this &amp; digi@@ k ; -@@ Session . &quot;
the keyword tree is dynam@@ ically adjusted to the entered keyword . you can thus quickly restrict the number of options when searching for a keyword . this ability is particularly useful when you have many keywords .
&quot; the input field at the bottom end is a further simpli@@ fication with the input of keywords in a picture series . if you have entered various keywords , they are saved for quick access . &quot;
keywords can also be set by marking the corresponding check boxes in the tree . all keywords of an image are stored in the IP@@ TC field keyword .
&quot; if several images are selected in the main view and select a keyword in the keyword tree , this is only applied to the highlighted image and not to the entire selection , if you want to add a selection with a keyword , please refer to the keyword filter section . &quot;
&quot; the side@@ bar keyword filter is used to change the selection of images displayed in the main window . usually , the left side bar is used with their album , - date , keyword and search views . if in addition one or more keyword filters are used from the right side , only the intersection of these two are displayed . &quot;
&quot; you can also drag and drop keywords . suppose you have selected several images in the main view to provide you with keywords . if the keyword already exists , you can simply drag it out of the right side@@ bar and put it on the selection . then a dialog appears asking if you want to set the keyword . &quot;
&quot; in the top example , the main window shows the images in a calendar tag . the keyword filter refers to no keywords , which reduces the amount to three images . &quot;
this search for changes takes place at any start of the program . it can also be switched off in Settings Mis@@ cellaneous .
&quot; if you have a rule with and created and find that it would have to be one or more , you can easily change this with double @-@ clicking on the text and in the control panel . &quot;
&quot; ( 1 ) : the entry in which the database is searched . this can be an album , name , keyword , image , keyword , etc . &quot;
&quot; ( 3 ) : the argument for the operator , which is a name or string , which is already set in the database . &quot;
&quot; for example , you can specify an extended search for all elements of the database using the following options : &quot;
&quot; if you want to group options , you just need to use the check box at the end of the rule and then use the button group@@ ing . &quot;

this article / tutorial was written mainly by El@@ le Stone . special thanks to El@@ le for this work . I mainly adapted it to &amp; digi@@ kam ; s concrete implementation .
&quot; the reason why you use a color @-@ managed workflow is that the colors that are from your camera or scanner will have a predic@@ table devi@@ ation from the actually photograph@@ ed or sc@@ anned colors . with a color @-@ managed workflow , you can achieve that the colors on your monitor resem@@ ble those of your camera or scanner and which correspond to the colors you print or publish on the web from your digital dark@@ room . &quot;
&quot; the purpose of this tutorial is to provide you with sufficient background information about color management . the purpose of this tutorial is to provide you with sufficient background information about color management . additionally , links with deeper information enable you to make your own informed decisions so that you can obtain the desired result . &quot;
&quot; if your image workflow meets all six criteria listed below , you don &apos;t have to worry about color management . &quot;
you are working on a monitor that is calibr@@ ated to the s@@ RGB colour space . ( see below )
&quot; your only other image editions are via e @-@ mail or web , where s@@ RGB is the de @-@ facto standard . &quot;
&quot; if so s@@ RGB works so well and makes life easier for everyone , why should one use another colour space and need to worry about color management ? &quot;
&quot; a visual example of the limitation of s@@ RGB compared to the colors we can really see is presented below . it shows a 2 @-@ dimensional representation of all colors that we can see , the hor@@ ses@@ ho@@ e region , and the colours in the s@@ RGB colour space , the tri@@ angular region . &quot;
&quot; if you want to compare the 2 @-@ Dimen@@ sion@@ al representation of s@@ RGB with some larger color spaces , visit Bruce Lind@@ blo@@ oms excellent site and click Info and then on Information About RGB working spaces . &quot;
do I need to cal@@ li@@ ze my monitor if I decided to work only in s@@ RGB colour space ?
&quot; yes ! whether you are working in a s@@ RGB colour space or not , you need to cal@@ li@@ ate your monitor as s@@ RGB outputs the circle . if you work as a color space of s@@ RGB , you must either calibr@@ ate your monitor to the s@@ RGB standard , use a matching monitor profile or both . &quot;

&quot; this tool provides five automatic correc@@ tions , which can improve a picture in most cases . therefore , use it before attempting any manual editing . &quot;
&quot; the functions norm@@ alize , settle , automatic balances and contrast extend from the menu Cor@@ rig@@ ation Automatic correction attempt to make the best from your colors . you will need to experiment with these effects to see which works best at your photo . &quot;
norm@@ alize : this method sc@@ aled the lumin@@ ance values over the entire image so that the dark@@ est point is black and the bright@@ est point is as bright as possible without changing its colour shade . this function is often a gast@@ ric correction for pictures that are dark or washed .
&quot; this method adju@@ sts the lumin@@ osity threshold of the color of the selected image so that the hist@@ ogram of the intensity channel is as flat as possible . sometimes the compar@@ isons usually produce very good results in improving the contrast of an image , sometimes it also produces tr@@ ash . it is a very powerful operation that either causes miracles in an image or destro@@ ys it . &quot;
&quot; automatic Comp@@ are : this method maxim@@ izes the colour range in the red , green and blue channel . it determines the dark and bright border @-@ tones and adjust the red , green and blue channels to the complete hist@@ ogram range . &quot;
contrast : this method improves the contrast and lumin@@ osity of the RGB values of an image by moving the lowest and highest values to the greatest possible area and a new ji@@ us@@ p@@ ation of all values in between . this is only visible in full @-@ washed pictures and can be a good correction for bad photos .
&quot; the white balance from &amp; digi@@ kam , is a semi @-@ automatic tool to perform the white balance of a photo . &quot;
&quot; the whit@@ eness adjustment is slightly restricted because of a colour space with 8 @-@ bit per colour . if you can do so too far from the original image , areas with over@@ exposure can occur . if you can perform the white balance in the blank mode , which works in 16 @-@ bit mode , your chances of correc@@ ting will be better . &quot;
this tool is based on a white balance algorithm protected by the copyright by Pa@@ wel T. J@@ och@@ ny@@ . they start using the menu entry shades of white balance of image processing .
&quot; the preview window can be adjusted in size . on the left side you can see both the original image and preview of the target image . the preview will be dynam@@ ically adjusted to the tool &apos;s settings . if you want to see the original white balance again , it is enough to click on the window . &quot;
the preview of the target photos has a red marker . the lumin@@ ance of the pixel under this marker is shown as a vertical line in the hist@@ ogram .
&quot; at the top , a hist@@ ogram is shown that dynamic changes will change as soon as you change a parameter . this hist@@ ogram is very helpful , even in well lit images , most pixels are rendered very small lumin@@ ance values . with a button you can decide whether one of the three colors or your sum is displayed . the sum is called L@@ umin@@ ance . &quot;
&quot; the contrast of your result depends on shadow , satur@@ ation and g@@ amma . shadow adjustment lets you improve or dim the shadow details of your photos . &quot;
&quot; to play an@@ stat with the above controls , you should use the color temperature pi@@ p@@ ette . press this button and then somewhere on the picture preview to use the selected color to calculate the color temperature of the white balance . in this way , the temperature and green values are set automatically . &quot;
&quot; in addition , you can set the white balance with the list of pres@@ ets . the following settings are available : &quot;
the over@@ exposure indicator increases the colors when more than one channel of the pixel is over@@ exposed .. you will get the combined result in white balance . this is shown in the preview as a pure indicator and has no effect on the final image .
&quot; buttons save as and load exactly this . each setting of the white balance you have set , you can save with a text file and load it later . &quot;
the Pre@@ ferences button re@@ stores all filter values to its default values and neutral white balance . note that also neutral settings will result in another photo as your original . if you save it will change your original image .
&quot; you can set the coding depth per colour channel of the edited image . 8 @-@ bit enco@@ ding is the widely used JPEG format , 16 bit enco@@ ding is better for high @-@ quality images . this coding requires more disk space , computing time and is only available for formats PNG , PN@@ M , TIFF and DNG . &quot;
this tool opens the same dialog as the editing of raw images . it uses the change and assignment of color profiles . color setting can be done by the sub@@ window for the brightness . a detailed guide for using color profiles allows you to rate the chapter color management .
&quot; another important tool is available in the menu under colors tone correc@@ tions . this tool provides an integrated way to adjust multiple color channels simultaneously , allowing you to use it for multiple photos . this is helpful if your camera or scanner always need the same error and you will always need the same correction . &quot;
&quot; a very powerful option to correct exposure problems is the tool for gra@@ dation , that you can find under colors gra@@ dation in the menu . &quot;
&quot; tool colour effects provides four colour effects , a solar simulation effect , a Vel@@ via filter , a ne@@ on effect and a edge filter . &quot;
&quot; in times of chemical processing , solar cell , also called Sab@@ ati@@ er , was an effect that emerged when one replaced a partially developed pressure with a short flash light and subsequently inver@@ ted the development of the image . the result was a partial neg@@ ativity of the image . this tool allows you to adjust this interesting effect finely . &quot;
&quot; intensity controls the solar cell . at approx . 50 % intensity , the image shows what is chem@@ ically possible . &quot;
this is an example of the solar simulation effect . the original image is the ( 1 ) and that processes the ( 2 ) . the applied intensity is 30 % .
&quot; the Vi@@ vid @-@ Filter simul@@ ates the so @-@ called &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vi@@ aqu@@ ot ; effect . it differs from satur@@ ation by making it a stronger contrast effect that makes the colors brilliant and g@@ lowing . try it , it beauti@@ fies many photos . &quot;
Vel@@ via is a composition of &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vet Medi@@ aqu@@ ot . the name is a composition of &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vet Medi@@ aqu@@ ot ; and there@@ with a reference for its smooth picture structure . Vel@@ via offers very saturated color in daylight and high contra@@ sts . Vel@@ via offers very saturated color in daylight and high contra@@ sts .
the parameter level controls the brightness of the result and the slider re@@ peti@@ tions the strength of the ne@@ on light . in large images the filter can rel@@ ieve the entire CPU for a moment .
digital cameras often have problems with lighting conditions and it is therefore not unusual to change the color contrast and lumin@@ osity of the photo . you can preview the different color aspects of your photos with the tools in the menu under colors . all your adjustment can be viewed in the preview . once you are satisfied with the result you use the button O@@ k and you will be applied .
&quot; if you can make a photo in poor lighting conditions , you can get the reverse problem : one too great satur@@ ation . also in this case , the tool for brightness / satur@@ ation is a good choice to reduce satur@@ ation instead of it . if you like the result you can confirm the changes with O@@ k . &quot;
&quot; between the complex tool gra@@ dation and the simple lumin@@ ous intensity / contrast / g@@ amma , the tool is set to improve exposure . even if the dialogue with this tool works very complicated , you will need only the area of the slide . concrete the three sli@@ ders below the hist@@ ogram . &quot;
&quot; the window contains a graph of the intensity values , a hist@@ ogram , the active channel or the selected area . under the graph three sli@@ ders are cli@@ cked in and that can be moved to change the intensity values of the image . the left side represents the dark and the right side the bright areas . &quot;
the easiest way to learn the operation is to shift the controls and watch the image changes .
&quot; on the right hand side , the original and preview of the picture can be viewed . the preview will be dynam@@ ically updated based on the settings of the image . on the left hand side the following options are available . &quot;
sc@@ aling : with this selection box you can set whether the hist@@ ogram is displayed with a linear or log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic Y axis . for images of a constant color the linear hist@@ ogram is dominated by a single pillar . in this case the log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic division is more useful .
&quot; three kno@@ bs : the top for the dark tones , the middle for the bright tones and the bottom for the middle sounds , often called gam@@ ma@@ ids . &quot;
&quot; the three color pin@@ tes can be used in previ@@ ew@@ ing the original image to automatically adjust the input values of the shadows , medium and bright tones . in addition , there is a button for a fully automatic adjustment . &quot;
&quot; output values : the output values allow the selection of manual values for each range . there are also two controllers that can be used to change the output values , for example , to create a ble@@ mis@@ ed image as background while seeing something else in the foreg@@ round . &quot;
&quot; automatic : with this button , the image values are automatically set depending on the intensity values of the image . &quot;
&quot; save as and load : with these buttons , the set values can be stored in the file system and loaded later . for this purpose the Gim@@ p Levels Format is used . &quot;
&quot; when you use this mode and the three colour pi@@ p@@ ette , the input values will be automatically read@@ ju@@ sted for all shades , means and sun tones . enable the color pi@@ p@@ ette you want to use and click on the preview of the original image to set the input values of the hist@@ ogram for red , green , blue and lumin@@ ance channels . &quot;
&quot; the over@@ exposure indicator controls all color channels to view over@@ exposed pixels and display the combined result of all channels . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only in the preview and there is no effect on the final result . &quot;
&quot; below you see an example of the adjustment of the input values applied to the red , green and blue channel of a photo . intensity and alpha channel , as well as the output values are unchanged . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and the corrected picture with ( 2 ) . &quot;
&quot; on the left side , half of the original and the target image will be displayed . the preview will be dynam@@ ically updated depending on your settings . on the right hand side the following options are available : &quot;
modified channel : this selection box allows to specify the channel that is modified by the module :
&quot; in addition to this box , there are two icons to switch between a linear and a log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic view . for images that were recorded with a digital camera , linear mode usually generates a wide beam . in this case the log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic mode is used . &quot;
&quot; for example , if you move a curve part to the right , e.g. the bright sounds , then you can see that these bright tones correspond with dar@@ ker output blocks and that the associated image pixels become dar@@ ker . &quot;
&quot; on the preview of the original photos is a red mark@@ ings to see . if you want to move this marker on the area you want to change , a suitable line is displayed on the curve that is the original value . create a point on this line and move it up and down until the value is adjusted to your taste . &quot;
save as and load : with these buttons you can do exactly this . each curve you have created can be saved in the file system and later loaded . the file format for this is the Gim@@ p curve format .
&quot; activate the color pi@@ p@@ ette you want to use and click on the original image to set the control points for the red , green , blue and lumin@@ ance curve . &quot;
&quot; the over@@ exposure indicator controls all color channels to display over@@ exposed pixels . if stored in more than one channel , you get the combined result . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only in the preview and there is no effect on the final result . &quot;
below you can see a black @-@ white photo that was corrected in the L@@ umin@@ ant channel . shadow and sun tones were set with the color pi@@ p@@ ette and applied to the curves . the original image is ( 1 ) and the corrected ( 2 ) .
the channel bl@@ ender of &amp; digi@@ came ; editing is a tool to improve the color channels or change the colour shades of the photo .
the channel bl@@ ender is another highly developed tool to blend the color tones of the images . you can edit it from the menu colors channel bl@@ ender of image processing .
&quot; using the channel selection box , you can select the color for the hist@@ ogram : this gives you a first indication of how to correct the channels by viewing the relative distribution and r@@ ash . the left area of the window shows you a preview . the original can be viewed for comparison with your own rider . &quot;
&quot; the preview of the Target has a red marker . if you position it in the picture , a vertical line in the hist@@ ogram will show you the corresponding color value . &quot;
&quot; controls for the module are right down : controls for red , green and construction allow you to mix these channels . &quot;
&quot; sometimes , especially when you mix Mon@@ och@@ rome , the reduction of a color leads to a visible noise that comes from the far@@ my@@ ard . &quot;
save as and loading buttons are used precisely for this purpose . any Mixer settings can save you for later and then load . the file format used is the Gim@@ p channel mixer format .
&quot; the over@@ exposure indicator controls all color channels to view over@@ exposed pixels and display the combined result of all channels . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only in the preview and there is no effect on the final result . &quot;
below you can see a photo in which the blue channel has been re @-@ adjusted . the L@@ umin@@ ance option is enabled . the original image is shown below ( 1 ) and the edited image below ( 2 ) .
&quot; black / white photography has always been fascinating because of its abstra@@ ction . with the development of digital photography , black / white is a work step , as color images can easily be converted to the machine . also with a set of film roll profiles . &quot;
&quot; Il@@ ford Delta 100 , Il@@ ford Delta 400 , Il@@ ford Delta 400 Pro 3200 , Il@@ ford FP@@ 4 Plus , Il@@ ford HP@@ 5 Plus , Il@@ ford Pan@@ F Plus , Il@@ ford XP@@ 2 Super &quot;
&quot; green filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with a green lens filter . this looks good , with all the scene images and fits especially well to portraits against the sky . so , similar to the 004 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) green filter . &quot;
&quot; orange filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with an orange lens filter . this improves landscapes , maritime scenes and aerial photos . so similar to the 002 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) orange filter . &quot;
Rot@@ filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with a red lens filter . this creates dramatic cel@@ esti@@ al effects and can simul@@ ate lun@@ ar cul@@ ts at day@@ time . so similar to the 003 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) Rot@@ ary filter .
yellow filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with a yellow lens filter . this is the most natural color tone correction and improves the contrast . it is ideal for landscapes and thus similar to 001 c@@ ok@@ ine ( t@@ m ) yellow filter .
Sep@@ i@@ aton : produces warm light and medium tones as it adds a bit cold in the sh@@ ading desert . this is very similar to the process of le@@ aking a pressure and the re@@ development in a sep@@ ia . this is typical for the photos of your grand@@ mother and there@@ with similar to the 005 c@@ ok@@ ine ( t@@ m ) Sep@@ i@@ af@@ il@@ ter .
use the &amp; digi@@ once ; apply tool texture you can apply decorative tex@@ tures to an image .
&quot; adding a texture to your image , regardless of whether it &apos;s a color image or not , you can look like an oil painting on a canvas , the stit@@ ch of an old master , a pop art portrait of enlarged points or like a m@@ ural on a wall . the menu entry image texture applying the image processing can be used for it . &quot;
relief : post@@ p@@ one this parameter to the right increases the appearance of the depth or the three @-@ dimension@@ ality of the texture on the picture .
a paper texture effect has been applied on the photo below . the original image is ( 1 ) and the modified one ( 2 ) to be seen . the parameter relief has been set to 200 .
add the tool box ; add a decorative frame to add a picture .
keeping the eye of a viewer in the limits of a photo is not an easy task . one way to keep his attention is to set the picture a decorative frame . this is a psychological barrier for the sc@@ atter@@ ing eye . under the frame add frame the module can be started from the image processing .
&quot; type : with this parameter you set the desired frame type for your image . through the image with a colored line , Ni@@ ep@@ ce bor@@ dered it with a thin line and a wide frame ( ideal for black and white images ) , sh@@ ed@@ ding it with a nice three @-@ dimensional frame of the ideal for a button effect and decorative add a decorative frame with patterns . &quot;
width : indicates the width of the frame in percent . the value range for width is limited from 1 % to 50 % .
&quot; the target image decorated with the frame will be larger than the original but the same aspect ratio . this is important for printing the images , especially if you cut the tool after aspect ratio before . &quot;
&quot; with this handy tool , you can easily insert a form@@ atted text into a picture at any location . this also goes to several places if you need it . &quot;
&quot; this tool is very intuitive to use . simply enter the text and place it with the mouse . use text execution , orientation , color from the color space and the character set with its properties as you need . &quot;
&quot; each setting you selected for your text can be changed until you press the &quot; &quot; OK &quot; &quot; button . once the image has been saved , the text is part of the image . it can no longer be changed . &quot;
to apply a template using a template you can lay a template over an image .
the menu image template uses in image editing can be used to place templates over an image .
&quot; for the template there are no restrictions regarding the size and orientation . however , you need to take the PNG file format and should work with maximum compression ( 9 ) to reduce the file size of the template . &quot;
&quot; if you use this tool for the first time , you need to set your template folder with the button base folder in the dialog . select the folder in which you have copied the template files . these settings will be marked for the next start . &quot;
&quot; once the root folder has been set for templates a tree view appears , which reflects the folder structure of the sten@@ cil folder . selecting a folder updates the template of templates automatically . &quot;
under the preview there are three buttons with which you can change the magni@@ fication factor and the position of your image .
enlarge : this button enlar@@ ges the image below . it is centered around the position of the mouse . check it with the left mouse button .
&quot; in case you want to apply the template to the whole picture , you need to shr@@ ink the image accordingly . check it with the left mouse button . &quot;
move : use this button to move the picture below the template . take the picture and place it at the desired position .
&quot; if you want to apply the template to your image , the image will then be adjusted automatically to the thumb@@ nail size . &quot;
&amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; provides three different tools for shar@@ pen@@ ing . each of you has advantages in other areas .
&quot; shar@@ pen@@ ing is a traditional tool for shar@@ pen@@ ing . it is very fast and easy , but produces , especially in dark areas , gra@@ iny images . &quot;
the algorithm was taken from Gim@@ p and it is copy@@ ri@@ ghted by Win@@ ston Ch@@ ang .
re@@ focus is probably the best of the three because it really improves the sharp@@ ness . it is a little more complicated in its application and has different parameters to adjust .
&quot; photos without focus , as well as most digi@@ ti@@ zed images require a correction of sharp@@ ness . &quot;
&quot; in JPEG images , a camera is often used for internal sharp@@ ness . in contrast , images in the raw format must always be shar@@ pen@@ ed while processing . &quot;
&quot; some scanner addresses a field of sharp@@ ness already during the reading of the image . if you disable it , you will get control of your image . &quot;
&quot; in some situations you can get useful results by shar@@ pen@@ ing a photo with the sharp@@ ness value , which allows you to run shar@@ pen@@ ing with the menu item . &quot;
&quot; but you should circum@@ vent this , as the results do not seem very natural : the sharp@@ ness raises the sharp@@ ness of the edges , but also ampli@@ fies the noise . in general , the most useful technique is focusing on shar@@ pen@@ ing the tool . you can find further information and a comparison of all techniques to focus . &quot;
sometimes you have the opposite problem : a picture is too cr@@ un@@ chy . the solution to draw the picture a little soft is much easier than it to shar@@ pen . use the tool to mark sof@@ ten@@ ing with the menu item Cor@@ rig@@ ation sof@@ ten@@ ing and experiment with some with settings . the preview window on the right side of the dialog shows you the effect on your photo .
the filter un@@ sharp masks is a very good tool to remove vei@@ ls from your photos . a demonstration can be seen here .
the original image and preview help to edit the image . the preview window shows the output of the filter with the current settings .
&quot; there are two important parameters , the radius and the amount . &quot;
the radius represents how many pixels are affected by the filter on each side . high @-@ resolution images allow larger radi@@ i . you should therefore shar@@ pen pictures best in their final resolution .
&quot; the amount represents the percentage between the original and the bl@@ urred image , which is added to the original . thus , the strength of the sharp@@ ness is set . &quot;
&quot; the threshold value is a fraction of the maximum RGB value and the difference @-@ amount . thus , it is possible to define a minimum difference between the sounds of the sharp@@ ness and therefore avoid beauty errors in faces , sk@@ ies and water surfaces . &quot;
&quot; this is an example of the fu@@ zzy mas@@ king filter . the original image is the ( 1 ) and the edited image the ( 2 ) . fu@@ zzy mas@@ king was applied with radius = 6.0 , amount = 0.5 and a threshold value = 0.0 . &quot;
the &amp; digi@@ kam tool re@@ focuses on an image by improving the sharp@@ ness . it used the copy@@ ri@@ ghted un@@ folding filter algorithm of Ernst Li@@ ppe .
this is a technique called FI@@ R Vi@@ enn@@ ese filtering . this is better approach than trying to shar@@ pen the photo . it uses a technique called FI@@ R Vi@@ enn@@ ese filtering . the traditional technique for shar@@ pen@@ ing images is the use of a bl@@ ur mask .
&quot; in practice , the circular folding is much better than the auss &apos;s fold . the pal@@ ate &apos;s fold has a very long tail , which causes the mathematical result also from the source pixel , which is far from the original pixel , which causes undes@@ irable results . &quot;
&quot; circular sharp@@ ness : this is the radius of circular cle@@ av@@ age . it is the most important parameter for using this module . for most pictures , the default value should result in good results . &quot;
correlation : an increase in correlation may help reduce arti@@ facts . the correlation can be chosen from 0 @-@ 1 . useful values are 0.5 and the values near 1 ; &amp; eg ; 0.@@ 95 and 0.@@ 99 . a high value for the correlation reduces the shar@@ pen@@ ing effect of the module .
&quot; noise filter : an increase in the noise filter can help you reduce arti@@ facts . the filter can take values of 0 @-@ 1 . however , values higher than 0.1 are rarely helpful . if the noise filter is too low , &amp; eg ; 0 the image quality is very bad . a useful value is 0.0@@ 3 . a high value will still further pol@@ lu@@ te the image . &quot;
&quot; use this parameter if your sharp@@ ness is &apos; gauge &apos; . in most cases , you should set this value to 0 to avoid anno@@ ying arti@@ facts . if you use a value un@@ equal zero , you may need to increase the correlation and / or the noise filter . &quot;
&quot; matrix size : this value determines the size of the transformation matrix . an increase in the matri@@ ces size can produce good results , especially if you select large values for the circle @-@ shaped sharp@@ ness or the gauge of the sharp@@ ness . in most cases , you should choose a value in the range of 3 @-@ 10 . &quot;
saving as and loading buttons are used precisely for this purpose . any re@@ focus parameter you have set will be saved for later and can then be loaded .
&quot; try to perform all the trimm@@ ing , color and intensity correc@@ tions on the image before using the module . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , you should use the module before you change the image otherwise . the reason for this is that much operations changes that are not immediately visible , but they later leave un@@ pleas@@ urable art@@ ef@@ acts . &quot;
&quot; if you read and comp@@ ress images , &amp; eg ; as JPEG , you should apply the module to the un@@ compressed image . &quot;
&quot; generally , fu@@ zzy mas@@ king produces better results than sharp@@ ness . this could be caused by the fu@@ zzy mas@@ king to use a larger neighborhood as shar@@ pen@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; in theory , fu@@ zzy mas@@ king must always produce art@@ ef@@ acts . even under optimal conditions , it can never remove the effect of the sharp@@ ness . for the Vi@@ enn@@ ese filter it is always at least as good as the sharp@@ ness mask . the FI@@ R Vi@@ enn@@ ese filter is often better when processing small details . &quot;
&quot; below you can see a comparison between different filters , applied on a small un@@ focused picture : &quot;
this image has to be corrected with an analog camera . the un@@ focused result is due to insufficient light for the auto focus lens .
&quot; for more information on the field correction methods in digital images , you can read a technical comparison in English at this address . &quot;
the regul@@ ator smooth@@ s the sharp@@ ness of the area that has been dark@@ ened so as to create a more natural pup@@ il .
&quot; if you want blue eyes instead of dark ones , you can set it here . &quot;
the tool image error correction is one of the most developed tools to remove unwanted art@@ ef@@ acts with unprecedented speed .
the In@@ Design algorithm was developed by I@@ MAGE team of the Gre@@ c CN@@ RS laboratory in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
this tool includes various pres@@ ets as starting points to simplify the restoration . the default pres@@ ets are listed below :
&quot; if you want to adjust the filter settings , you can use the tab smoothing and advanced settings . &quot;
&quot; detail maintenance p &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this controls the preservation of the details . a small value leads to an even smooth@@ ness over the image . a small value leads to an even smooth@@ ness over the image . a value of 0.9 should obtain details so that no shar@@ pen@@ ing should always be subordin@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; direction dependen@@ cy alpha &#91; 0.@@ 100 &#93; : a small value smooth@@ es ev@@ enly in all directions , while a value close to 1 is just one direction . if you have a film gran@@ ulation or CCD noise will create a high value wave @-@ like pattern . JPEG art@@ ef@@ acts are best removed at a value near 1 . &quot;
&quot; smooth &#91; 0 , 500 &#93; : this sets the maximum smoothing factor above all@@ y. p then defines the relative smooth@@ ness . therefore , set this value appropriate to the degree of noise in your image . &quot;
&quot; regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter affects larger structures . the higher this value is set , the more it is smo@@ othed , as it is then difficult to estimate the geometry of the image . even if you want to create a &apos; van Gog@@ h &apos; Tur@@ bul@@ ence effect it must be set higher than 3 . &quot;
re@@ peti@@ tions : indicates how often the algorithm is passed through . usually one or two is enough .
&quot; angle Step Since &#91; 5 , 90 &#93; : angle @-@ dependent integration of an@@ is@@ otrop@@ ic alpha . if Alpha is selected small , it should also be chosen small . make sure that small angles create a long run@@ time . thus , you should choose this value as greatest and acceptable to your needs . &quot;
&quot; integral stri@@ de width &#91; 0,1 , 10 &#93; : integral stri@@ de width in pixels . you should set the value smaller 1 to avoid sub @-@ pixel smoothing and never bigger than 2 . &quot;
&quot; linear Inter@@ pol@@ ation Use : the more to quality you get by choosing this option is only small , but it dou@@ bles the run@@ time . we therefore recommend it to allow it to happen . &quot;
the save as and load buttons do exactly this . to correct any setting of image errors can be saved in a text file and loaded later .
&quot; image errors are compar@@ atively very fast at work . however , it can take a very long time and pull a high CPU load . therefore , you can cancel the calculation at any time with the button termination . &quot;
&quot; below you can see how image errors can be removed with minor art@@ ef@@ acts . the module is used on a photo that was made in Guatemala City with an analog camera . as you see , there is a strange black art@@ ef@@ act in the foreg@@ round that caused by a bad film shift during the trip . the original image is below ( 1 ) to see and the corrected picture below ( 2 ) . &quot;
die &amp; digi@@ kam ; noise reduction is a very powerful tool to reduce noise . it uses a copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorithm by Peter Heck@@ ert .
&quot; this tool provides sel@@ ectable image filters to remove spots and other art@@ ef@@ acts , e.g. from dust or hair on the lens . it can also be used to remove sensor noise from the camera or Mo@@ i@@ re@@ acute ; -@@ Effects of sc@@ anned images from books or magazines . &quot;
&quot; if you need more information about sensor noise from digital cameras , you can read them in English in this tutorial . &quot;
the screen@@ shot above shows a typical scene made with a digital camera and a high ISO sensitivity . it shows a gra@@ iny noise that can be removed successfully with this tool .
&quot; in the following , you will find a complete description of all parameters . in most cases , you only need the sub@@ window details and Advanced settings may remain with default settings . &quot;
&quot; radius controls the window size , from 1 ( 3x@@ 3 ) to 20 ( 4@@ 1x@@ 41 ) , which is used for the filter . large values increase the time the filter is used per pixel and can be bl@@ urred by the image and the color in it is flat@@ ten@@ ed and thus minor faul@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; sharp@@ ness : controls the field of sharp@@ ness . this value sets the pixel spac@@ ing . if it is increased , noise levels will be deleted . if the value is too high , the adap@@ tive filter image details cannot be preserved and noise or lubri@@ cation will occur again . &quot;
edges : controls edge accuracy for the sharp@@ ness . this value improves the frequency response of the filter . if it cannot be too strong the entire noise can be removed or noise peaks can occur . set it to a value close to the maximum if you want to remove a weak noise or JPEG art@@ ef@@ acts without losing details .
lumin@@ ance : controls the brightness tolerance of the image . we recommend either color or lumin@@ ance to change in order to improve an image . these settings do not affect the smoothing process that is controlled by the details settings .
color : controls the color tolerance of the image . we recommend either color or lumin@@ ance to change to improve a picture . these settings do not affect the smoothing process that is controlled by the details settings .
&quot; g@@ amma : controls the g@@ amma tolerance of the image . this value can be used to increase the tolerance values of the dar@@ ker areas , which are typically harder to use . however , it also poll@@ utes the shadow areas . &quot;
&quot; absorption : controls the adjustment of the ph@@ as@@ en@@ j@@ itter absorption . this value is defined as quickly the adap@@ tive filter radius respon@@ ds to variations of the lumin@@ ance . if it is increased , noise and phase j@@ itter appear at the edges . it can remove noise peaks and is the recommended method for it . &quot;
store and load : these buttons are used for exactly this purpose . all parameters for noise reduction you have set can be stored in the file system and loaded later .
this is an example of how noise reduction can change your life . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and the corrected with ( 2 ) . the noise reduction was used with default settings .
&quot; sometimes , a picture is too cr@@ un@@ chy for your purpose . fortunately , the solution to draw the picture a little soft is fortunately much easier than a picture to shar@@ pen . use tool to draw soft@@ ness with the menu item Cor@@ rig@@ ate Wis@@ dom and experiment with the smooth@@ ness . the preview window on the right side of the dialog shows the effect of this operation on your photo . &quot;
die &amp; digi@@ kam ; Photo Restau@@ ration is definitely one of the most widely developed tools to reduce photo art@@ ef@@ acts .
&quot; this filter for restoration gives you the possibility to remove a lot of unwanted art@@ ef@@ acts from your pictures . it is very well adapted to remove Gau@@ ß &apos;s noise , film gran@@ ular@@ ity , scrat@@ ches , compression art@@ ef@@ acts and local errors that are made in digital , original or subsequently digit@@ alized images . &quot;
&quot; the same algorithm can be used for color and texture . the texture of the texture is done with another tool , the image error correction . the algorithm for restoration was developed by the I@@ MAGE team of the Gre@@ c CN@@ RS labs in Ca@@ en / Fran@@ n@@ k@@ reich and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project . &quot;
&quot; reduce JPEG Art@@ ef@@ acts : compression of JPEG is not perfect , in some areas even very far away . as a lossy compression algorithm , he generates some compression &amp; quot ; art@@ ef@@ ak@@ te@@ ats ; - small standards that are in un@@ compressed picture . this attitude should correct these problems . &quot;
&quot; the save as and load buttons do exactly this . any setting of photo restor@@ ing can be saved in a text file , and later loaded . &quot;
&quot; photo restoration is compar@@ atively very fast at work . however , it can take a long time and pull a high CPU load . therefore , you can cancel the calculation at any time with the kno@@ b button . &quot;
below you can see like a photo with uniform noise . the module is applied to a black and white photo that was included with a Min@@ ol@@ ta ( t@@ m ) 700@@ Si camera on an Il@@ ford ( t@@ m ) HP @-@ 5 film with a sensitivity of 3200 ISO . you can see the not@@ orious film gran@@ ulation on the faces .
&quot; below you can see another example of the photo restoration . this time , tex@@ tures have been reduced to an old color photo that was read with a scanner . you can see the scan art@@ ef@@ acts caused by sc@@ anners lighting and phot@@ op@@ aper . the original image is below ( 1 ) to see and the corrected picture below ( 2 ) . &quot;
&quot; die &amp; digi@@ kam ; tool Hot@@ pixel allows Hot@@ pixel of photos to be removed with a CCD camera , eight have been removed . it uses algorithms from the JP@@ EG@@ Pi@@ xi project protected by Martin Dick@@ opp . &quot;
&quot; bright , dead or hot pixels are a problem especially in high @-@ quality raw mode photos as many cameras with JPEG compression have a built @-@ in supp@@ ression for hot pixels . &quot;
&quot; this tool can be used to remove &amp; quot ; hot Pix@@ el@@ quot ; and &quot; &quot; quot ; bright pix@@ el@@ quot ; on a photo with a dark image sub@@ traction method to remove . there is currently no manual method to choose the bad pixels . &quot;
download this file in the wiz@@ ard with the button dark image . the tool will automatically detect the hot and bright pixels . these are highlighted in the picture preview .
&quot; if you have an old digital camera , it is important to use the dark image directly to connect to new hot or bright pixels by CCD defects . &quot;
&quot; first , as described in the previous section , you should download the appropriate dark image to the picture to be corrected . automatic processing of the dark image will find the bad pixels . note that the wiz@@ ard will notice the last dark image and automatically re@@ charge it in the next session . &quot;
the preview pane and preview help you correct the result within the image . preview window shows the output of the filter with the current settings .
select an area to view the defective pixels on the preview and the results of the filter . then select the best filter method to inter@@ pol@@ ishing these pixel blocks . these are the available filters :
&quot; Dur@@ ing : an average of the neighbor pixel is determined . the resulting color is assigned to all faul@@ ty pixels in the block . for a 1 @-@ dimensional inter@@ pol@@ ation , this is made separately for horizontal and vertical line . &quot;
linear : all pixels that have a distance of 1 from the pixel block are drawn to the calculation of a bi @-@ linear surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of linear curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) . these are then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the defective pixels in the block .
square : this is the standard filter@@ method . all pixels with a distance of 2 or less to pixel block are drawn to calculate a bi @-@ square surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of square curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) which is then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the pixels in the block .
cubic : all pixels with a distance of 3 or less are drawn to calculate a bi @-@ cubic surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of cubic curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) which is then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the defective pixels in the block .
&quot; below you can see the Hot@@ pixel correction on a color photo , from a defective digital camera with a sensitivity of 200 ISO and long exposure . the original image was enlarged to 300 % ( 1 ) and the corrected picture is shown below ( 2 ) . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; digi@@ kam , Vig@@ net@@ ting Cor@@ rection is a tool to correct the vig@@ net@@ ting , i.e. under@@ exposed corners , of an image . &quot;
&quot; wide angle lenses , especially those in medium and large photo format , are often not able to illumin@@ ate the entire sensor range equally . instead , &amp; quot ; vig@@ net@@ tier@@ en@@ quot ; ( shad@@ ed ) they reduce the corners and edges of the image by enabling the light to achieve the sensor there . &quot;
&quot; many center filters require a factor 1.5 or 2 in the aper@@ ture filter , which means that it is impossible to hold the camera with the hand . wide angle lenses should also be used with center filters , an aper@@ ture of f / 16 or smaller because otherwise un@@ shar@@ pen@@ ing effects are caused by movement . &quot;
&quot; with the large exposure ranges of today &apos;s film and color or grey scale depth of digital cameras and film scanner , it is possible to simul@@ ate the effect of a center filter by using an equi@@ val@@ ent transformation in a raw image without this filter . the algorithm is protected by John Walker . &quot;
&quot; with three regul@@ ators , you can control the vi@@ tic@@ ular correction filter and with three further exposure of the target image . &quot;
&quot; density : this parameter controls the degree of light loss at the point of the greatest density the filter . the standard density is 2.0 , which allows an optical filter with aper@@ ture setting of 1 , or random@@ ly a lumin@@ osity of 2 , un@@ lock the density to compens@@ ate for a greater degree of vig@@ net@@ ting , reduce it by a small degree . &quot;
&quot; lumin@@ osity , contrast and g@@ amma settings : editing an image with the Vig@@ net@@ ting Cor@@ rection reduces the brightness of the pixels . you need to adjust the exposure of the target image with these options . the controls only provide positive values , as you only have to increase the settings . &quot;
&quot; if you want to fine re @-@ adjust the exposure of the target image , leave the values for brightness / contrast / g@@ amma at zero and use the gra@@ dation from the gra@@ dation menu . &quot;
this is an example of the Vig@@ net@@ ting correction applied to an image . the original image ( 1 ) shows the Vig@@ net@@ ting in the corners and ( 2 ) the corrected picture .
&quot; die &amp; digi@@ kam , lens distor@@ tion is a tool to correct the effects of sp@@ her@@ ical lenses on photos . it uses a copyright protected algorithm by David Ho@@ dson . &quot;
this tool works with geomet@@ rical distor@@ tions . colour distor@@ tions cannot be corrected with this tool .
the coefficient of the second count covers the general geomet@@ rical distor@@ tion of the lens and can correct the conc@@ ave or con@@ ve@@ x form of the image .
&quot; the coefficient of the third graph has a similar round effect , but fla@@ p on the edges . this correction is not applied in the tool . &quot;
&quot; the coefficient of fourth gra@@ ding correc@@ ts the removed corners to that of the second degree . if you combine these two , any geometric distor@@ tion can be almost eliminated . &quot;
&quot; general : this value controls the thickness of the distor@@ tion of the second count . with negative values , barrel distor@@ tions can be corrected and positive values cushion distor@@ tion . &quot;
&quot; corner : this value controls the thickness of the distor@@ tion of fourth degrees . this value is stronger at the edges than in the middle of the picture . for most lenses , the &apos; Corner parameter has the reverse hall@@ mark of the parameter . &quot;
zoom : this value re@@ stores image size and thereby results in a correction of first graph@@ s . negative values increase while positive the image dimin@@ ish .
&quot; light : this value adju@@ sts the brightness in the corners of the image . negative values decrease the brightness of the image in the corners , while positive values increase it . &quot;
&quot; to help you find the best filter settings , the dialog with a preview will illustrate the distor@@ tion correction . the values you use for your image are stored and used at the next start as default values . &quot;
the barrel or cushion @-@ shaped correction should be performed before all cutting or size changes . best perform this correction as the first one . if you cut a picture and then perform a barrel @-@ shaped correction the effect would appear obvious to the Fal@@ se .
&quot; to help you find the best correction , this tool provides you with a vertical and horizontal relief line . move the mouse poin@@ ter in the picture preview to fix the dotted lines . move it to an important place , such as the edge of the sea or a building wall , in your image and press the left mouse button to correct the line / cushion distor@@ tion with the help of the lines . &quot;
&quot; if you correct a kis@@ sing distor@@ tion , the resulting picture will have black corners . you can remove them using the cutting tool in the menu trans@@ former cutting out of image editing , or using the Zoom kno@@ b of this dialog . &quot;
&quot; the next logical step for some motives as e.g. recordings from the front , frame and paintings is to correct the perspective so that all angles in the picture have 90 degrees . keep in mind that if you hold the camera by hand you will always have a slight distor@@ tion of perspective . &quot;
this is an example of the barrel @-@ shaped correction applied to a church in Norway . the original image is shown below ( 1 ) and the corrected picture below ( 2 ) .
&quot; the algorithm is based on a method to simul@@ ate the infrared @-@ film of the G@@ imp@@ Gur@@ u@@ .org website which is accessible under this URL . the filter re@@ produces the well @-@ known Il@@ ford ( t@@ m ) SF@@ X@@ 200 I@@ Infr@@ ar@@ ot@@ film , see this URL . this film has a sensitivity range of 200 @-@ 800 ISO . &quot;
&quot; in the left side of the window , you can select the area for preview . if you move the red rect@@ angle with the mouse , you can view the effect on different parts of the picture . &quot;
below the preview you can set two parameters for film gran@@ ulation and film sensitivity ( ISO ) . add the option Add film gran@@ ulation if you want to simul@@ ate the gran@@ ular texture of a highly sensitive film . the ISO regul@@ ator changes the amount of film gran@@ ulation and the domin@@ ance of color green ( chlor@@ ophy@@ ll in nature ) in transformation . green meadows will know how snow !
&quot; since the filter mi@@ xes color channels to reproduce the infr@@ a @-@ red film , especially the green channel makes no sense to apply the effect on black / white photos , as the colour information is missing . &quot;
this is an example of the infr@@ a @-@ film effect applied to a landscape photograph from New Zealand . the original image is below ( 1 ) and the edited image below ( 2 ) . the sensitivity of the film was set to ISO 400 . higher ISO values create a kind of au@@ ra in the top lights .
&quot; it is known from classic high @-@ speed films such as the B / W Ko@@ da@@ k Tr@@ i @-@ X . to increase the sensitivity of the films , the manufacturers mix large silver bas@@ ins of the emul@@ sion . &quot;
&quot; if you want this special , gallery @-@ like , road@@ photographic , gra@@ iny vision specially in your mon@@ och@@ rome photos , you have to use this filter . &quot;
&quot; with the regul@@ ator , the ISO sensitivity can be calibr@@ ated to control the intensity and gran@@ ular@@ ity of the grains . the default is although often higher values are required to be adjusted to ISO @-@ 2400 . if you need more grains , you can apply the filter several times . &quot;
this is an example of the film inspection effect applied to a black / white image . the original image is the ( 1 ) and the edited film sensitivity corresponds to ISO @-@ 1600 .
the &amp; digi@@ k ; filter oil painting produces the appearance of an oil painting . it uses an copyright protected algorithm by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
the &amp; digi@@ k ; filter oil painting gives your digital images a nice appearance like an oil painting . natural pictures and style life are good for this effect .
&quot; there are two controls to influence this effect . the upper sel@@ ects the brush size between one and five . th@@ icker brushes are better suited for large images . flat@@ ten controls the smooth@@ ness or , viewed from the other side , the hin@@ d@@ iness . &quot;
this is an example of the oil painting effect . the original image is marked with the ( 1 ) and the machining is marked with the ( 2 ) . brush size for this 640 pixel size is 1 and smooth@@ s 17 .
&quot; the &amp; digi@@ kam , filter char@@ coal drawing uses color and intensity gra@@ dients to create a carbon sket@@ ch . the lines that change the outline in drawing are emphasized . images of their gra@@ dients themselves are not ideal for this effect . &quot;
there are two controllers with a range of 1 to 100 to control this effect . the upper regul@@ ator sel@@ ects the pin size and the lower adjust the contrast ( smooth ) .
this is an example of the carbon capture filter . the original image ( 1 ) and the modified image ( 2 ) . the default settings of 30 and 10 were used . the result can be improved by adjusting the intensity value .
the &amp; digi@@ k ; filter engra@@ ver shapes your image in 3 @-@ D as if it was st@@ amped into wax . it uses an copyright protected algorithm by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
&quot; filter En@@ gra@@ ving ; Filter engraving is a fast tool to restore your images with a 3 @-@ D effect . it works especially well with images with a simple structure , where color is not the most important content . the filter uses the differences between color and intensity to transform the image into a gray , mon@@ th@@ ful landscape . &quot;
&quot; the depth allows to adjust the contrast of filtering . a value of 30 , corresponds to 10 % , is the default setting . &quot;
this is an example of the engra@@ ver filter . the original ( 1 ) and the processed image ( 2 ) . the used depth is 10 % .
&quot; with this filter group , you can transform a normal photo into an artwork using distor@@ tion effects . it uses copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorithms from Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n . &quot;
shaft blocks 1 : divi@@ des the image into cells and makes it look as if it is considered by glass blocks .
wave blocks 2 : analog@@ ous to the wave @-@ blocks 1 the image is dist@@ orted here with another version of glass blocks .
some effects require a long time to calculate and generate a high CPU load . you can cancel these effects at any time with the button Finish .
&quot; with this filter group , you can transform a normal photo into a work of art by means of lack of sharp@@ ness effects . it uses the copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorithms of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n . &quot;
&quot; zoom In sharp@@ ness : bl@@ urs the image along star @-@ shaped lines that eman@@ ate from a central point . this simul@@ ates the sharp@@ ness of a zo@@ oming camera , creating a dynamic expression of the often in sports photography . &quot;
radi@@ al sharp@@ ness : wi@@ pes the image through rotation of the pixels . this simul@@ ates the sharp@@ ness of a rotating camera .
removing cur@@ es : wi@@ pes the image to create the effect of a non @-@ focused camera lens . the object appears to appear in the background .
&quot; motion bl@@ ur : wi@@ pes the image through horizontal movements of pixels . this simul@@ ates the sharp@@ ness of a linear moving , z : B : from a car or train to photography , camera . &quot;
&quot; this creates photos with a dre@@ amy and shiny soft focus effect ( Hamilton Effect ) . this is ideal for creating romantic portraits , gl@@ amour @-@ photos or adding a warm and subtle g@@ low . &quot;
cont@@ actor : wi@@ pes the picture through random shifting of pixels and thus simul@@ ates the un@@ shar@@ pen@@ ing of an arbitr@@ ary moving camera .
intelligent un@@ shar@@ pen@@ ing : finds the color bas@@ ins in the picture and wi@@ pes it without changing the rest .
&quot; mos@@ aic : divi@@ des the photo into rectangular cells and then creates it , through the filling with an average pixel value , new . &quot;
&quot; some effects require a long time to calculate and cause high CPU load . therefore , you can cancel this calculation at any time with the kno@@ b button . &quot;
the rain@@ drops are a nice little tool to make rain@@ drops on your picture . this gives it natural your pictures a wet appearance . it uses a protected algorithm protected by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
size changes the number and density of drops . fish eyes changes the optical effect of drops in the image .
&quot; you can select a range free of rain@@ drops ; use the choice tool to choose the area , e.g. a face that should remain free . if you then start the filter rain drops , the area will remain free of rain@@ drops . &quot;
this is an example of the rain@@ drop filter . the original image ( 1 ) shows a quiet sunset and the modified image ( 2 ) indicates a sunset after a storm . the default values were used for this example .
&quot; if the photo has the wrong orientation , you can bring it through mirrors or turning in the right direction . you can find the tools in the menu Transform@@ ieren Rot@@ ate or Transformers . &quot;
photo blowing is definitely one of the most widely developed tools to enlarge a photo with a minimal loss of image quality .
&quot; the big question is , how can you blow up an image and keep the details sharp ? how can you zoom in a picture when the limits of resolution are reached ? how can you recover the missing information ? how can you re@@ inv@@ ent or guess the missing information ? the C@@ Im@@ g algorithm used here makes it a good job . try it and you will see it yourself . &quot;
&quot; if a photo has the wrong size , you can scale it to the desired size with the tool size . choose to change size change in the menu and specify the target values . the dialog is shown below . &quot;
&quot; the tool for size change uses a linear inter@@ pol@@ ation method to approach pixels . if you want to enlarge a small picture with a better quality , then try the tool for blowing . &quot;
&quot; many image processing programs use a kind of inter@@ pol@@ ation , e.g. sp@@ line inter@@ pol@@ ation to enlarge a picture . &amp; digi@@ kam , uses a further developed approach . the underlying algorithm photo inf@@ lat@@ s was developed by the I@@ MAGE team of the Gre@@ c CN@@ RS labs in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project . &quot;
you need to tell the tool how to change the size . these settings are available in the tab New size and are listed below :
&quot; aspect ratio preserved : if this setting is enabled , the new size will retain the aspect ratio of the original image . &quot;
&quot; regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter affects larger structures . the higher this value is set , the more it is smo@@ othed , as it is then difficult to estimate the geometry of the image . even if you want to create a &apos; van Gog@@ h &apos; Tur@@ bul@@ ence effect it must be set higher than 3 . &quot;
&quot; buttons save as and load are used precisely for this purpose . each ind@@ entation for photo magni@@ fication can be saved as a text file , and later loaded . &quot;
&quot; photo inf@@ lat@@ ing is very fast with what it does , but it can take very long and pull a high CPU load . you can cancel the calculation at any time with the kno@@ b button . &quot;
you can see below an example of photo bub@@ bles by enlar@@ ging a small color image on the double size . the original is ( 1 ) and the enlarged picture ( 3 ) . the preview ( 2 ) is the result of linear standard enlargement .
&quot; cutting a photo is not only a frequently carried out operation , but also a frequently under@@ estimated tool to put together an image . in order to trim a photo you simply need to create a picture with the mouse , by pressing the mouse button and pull up the rect@@ angle , then you will see this rect@@ angle then while you move the mouse . &quot;
&quot; when you release the mouse button again , the area of the photo will be cut off . this gives you a good overview of how your photo will look after cutting . you can change the size of the area to be cut by simply drag@@ ging it with the left mouse button . &quot;
&quot; as soon as you are satisfied with the cut , use the button Der Zu@@ cch@@ de button of image editing in the tool@@ bar and the photo is cut ( C@@ trl ; + X ) . use the entries file Save or Save file under the File menu to save the newly cut photo . &quot;
&quot; in the preview area , you can change the size of the rect@@ angle by post@@ p@@ one the corners using the mouse . the aspect ratio , which you have defined in the dialog , remains intact . &quot;
&quot; in the tool To cut the aspect ratio , you can specify orientation as a portrait format or landscape format . in portrait format , the larger value of height and width is assigned to width . &quot;
&quot; this means that it is always the same regardless of whether you use centimet@@ ers , inches or any other physical size . for example , you can see below a list of traditional sizes for photo paper and their aspect ratio . &quot;
&quot; at the right end of the dialog , there are two buttons to automatically center the selection horizont@@ ally or ver@@ tically . &quot;
&quot; in the bottom of the dialog you can use the Max . ratio button to cut the area for cutting to the greatest possible , depending on the chosen ratio and orientation . &quot;
&quot; cutting the tool according to aspect ratio saves its settings depending on the orientation ( horizontal or vertical ) . if you use the cutting tool the next time , these settings are stored as default values depending on orientation . the changed image dimensions are stored in the EX@@ IF tables , so that the EX@@ IF data will reflect the cut image and not the original image . &quot;
the settings of the assem@@ bling aid allow you to show help in order to better comp@@ ose your images . these help are :
&quot; harmonious triangle : harmon@@ ic divisions are based on the principle of simil@@ arity . like the third rule , harmon@@ ic tri@@ angles are a possibility to divide a rect@@ angle in a similarly harmonious tri@@ angles on the diagonal . &quot;
&quot; golden mean : the golden center is a division that is divided into different natural growth patterns , such as the spiral of a Nau@@ tilus shell or the flower leaves of a sun@@ flower . it appears in all sorts of things that we feel beautiful . &quot;
&quot; the golden division is the ir@@ rational number 1,6@@ 18@@ 03@@ 39@@ 88 ... and you have already been used with ancient Egyptians and Greeks used to construct your temples and pyram@@ ids . artists and architects used the golden division in all times when you put together your pictures , buildings and even photos to give your creations a natural order and beauty . &quot;
&quot; the number is derived from Fi@@ bon@@ acc@@ i sequence 1 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 , 8 , 13 , 21 , 34 &amp; etc . the resulting divi@@ der is 1 : 1,6@@ 18 the golden center . a composition which follows this rule is considered visually harmonious . &quot;
the golden center provides liquid extra lines if you put together an image . these aids are listed below :
&quot; the Golden Spir@@ al will bring you good results for your photos . compared to the third rule , the golden spiral creates a liquid line that can follow the eye through the picture . this kind of composition carries the gaze of the viewer along the line of the spiral and creates a symmet@@ rical visual flow . &quot;
&quot; another rule is the rect@@ angles of the golden spir@@ als , also called golden rect@@ angles . this rect@@ angles are used to create the golden spiral . this can be a line or different objects . &quot;
&quot; the Golden Tri@@ angles also der@@ ive from the golden spir@@ als discussed above . their ver@@ tices are the mid@@ point of the sides of the golden rect@@ angles . note that in contrast to harmonious tri@@ angles , golden tri@@ angles are no equivalent tri@@ angles . diagonal to these lines can place a static object dynamic . &quot;
&quot; if you use golden tri@@ angles to break your frame , you create an effect that is called dynamic symmet@@ ry by professional photographers . try to place your image focus on one of the cutting points and other visual information in the tri@@ angles . the result is a very attractive composition that you cannot achieve differently . &quot;
the options Horiz@@ ontal mirror and mirror mirrors can be used to mirror harmon@@ ic divisions .
&quot; with the button color you can set the color of the aid lines . if you have a picture with many colors and a high contrast , the relief lines can be invisible . this way you can adjust the color of lines to your current image . &quot;
the Free Rotation is a tool to rotate an image at any angle .
&quot; if you make a photo , then it happens easily that you don &apos;t hold the camera right ver@@ tically or horizont@@ ally . this creates a picture in which things are turned around an angle . &quot;
turn your image with the slider angle . the values on this slider are specified in degrees . with the Pre@@ ferences button you can set the slider to 0 degrees . a preview of the rotation is displayed on the right side of the window . the new dimensions of the image are displayed on the right .
&quot; for your help , the Free Rotation module provides a horizontal and a vertical line . move the mouse poin@@ ter in the image preview to position the two lines . now adjust it with a pressure on the left mouse button . now adjust the angle as described in previous section . &quot;
&quot; once you have shot a picture , you will find unwanted tri@@ angular holes in the corners . one way to repair it is to use the function trans@@ former trimm@@ ing from the image processing . &quot;
an elegant way to trim the image is the Automatic Cut feature . select one of the following options :
&quot; the anti @-@ ali@@ asing option smooth@@ es the image a bit after turning . however , note the above warning . &quot;
all per@@ spec@@ tival trans@@ formations are performed around a fixed point to the so @-@ called reference point . this point is in the middle of the picture and is represented by a red circle .
&quot; to change the perspective , you need to use the red squares at the corners of your image . the preview will then be automatically re@@ comp@@ uted . on the right side of the dialog you will find some information which will help you to change the perspective : &quot;
&quot; new width : displays the width of the new image , including the empty areas created by the transformation , in pixels . &quot;
&quot; new height : displays the height of the new image , including the empty areas created by the transformation , in pixels . &quot;
angle left above : shows the current angle in degrees at the top left corner of the transformed area .
angle to the right : shows the current angle in degrees at the upper right corner of the transformed area .
angle left below : shows the current angle in degrees at the lower left corner of the transformed area .
angle right down : shows the current angle in degrees at the lower right corner of the transformed area .
&quot; after adjusting the perspective , the picture is slightly dirty . for a single adjustment this effect is small , but two adjustments generate a double so strong effect and you should avoid it if possible . &quot;
&quot; after you have adjusted the perspective , you get endless tri@@ angular holes at the corners . one way to clean it is to cut the picture with trans@@ former cutting out of the image processing . &quot;
&quot; this is no rotation , the image is dist@@ orted . in other words , a rect@@ angle is transformed into a parall@@ el@@ ogram . you can start this module by transforming sc@@ iss@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; sc@@ iss@@ ors your image by using the horizontal angle and vertical angles . if you click on pres@@ ets , the angles are reset to zero . a preview of the effect will appear to you and the new dimensions of the target image are displayed on the right of the preview pane . &quot;
&quot; move the mouse to an important point , like the lake , a wall of a building on your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines . you can now use the mould to adjust your image . &quot;
&quot; after you have carried out the she@@ ar , the picture becomes a bit bl@@ urred . for single she@@ ar this effect is usually neg@@ li@@ gible , but two deposits generate twice as much bl@@ ur@@ ring and therefore you should avoid this . &quot;
&quot; after she@@ eting , the image has un@@ beautiful tri@@ angular holes in the corners . one way to eliminate it is to cut the picture with trans@@ former cutting out of the image processing . &quot;
&quot; it requires a number of libraries and other packages to read and write image formats . the available formats therefore depend on your system and , in some cases , from the way these libraries have been compiled . in most distri@@ butions you will be able to edit a large number of image formats with &amp; digi@@ kam . &quot;
&quot; due to this dependence on other libraries it is impossible to give a list of all file formats available on their system , but you will always find JPEG and TIFF below . &quot;
&quot; this happens based on file extension and a comparison of this with a pre@@ defined list . if the extension is listed in the list , &amp; digi@@ kam , you can change this list of file extensions the &amp; digi@@ kam . in the configuration section you will find more information . &quot;
almost all digital cameras store photos in one of two formats : JPEG or TIFF . some cameras allow you even to select the format used . a more detailed description of these file formats can be found in Wikipedia . &amp; digi@@ kam ; supports both formats .
&quot; image compression is the application of data compression methods on digital images . redund@@ ant information is reduced , in order to save image data in a more efficient way . &quot;
&quot; JPEG 2000 is also supported . in general , there are better , smo@@ other results than JPEG with the same compression ratio . the 200@@ 0s version can also save loss@@ less if specified in the settings . &quot;
&quot; if you want to learn more about the raw image format , you can read by Wikipedia , The L@@ umin@@ ous Land@@ scape and Cambridge in Colour very helpful instructions in English . you can convert raw format images to JPEG or TIFF with the raw image converter from &amp; digi@@ kam . &quot;
&quot; with this , more than 200 raw data formats are supported . all support cameras can be seen below on the web page of Dave Coff@@ in . the table below shows a short list of raw formats that came from &amp; digi@@ kam , supported : &quot;
&quot; many digital cameras support recording short films . these clips are often recorded in the A@@ VI@@ - or MPEG format . &amp; digi@@ kam , but doesn &apos;t have a movie editing program and therefore does not have any built @-@ in possibilities to display or edit films . if you click on a movie file &amp; digi@@ kam , use the &amp; k@@ de settings to start playing movies to start playing . &quot;
go forward to the previous record in the Chron@@ icle . you can only go forward if you have gone back before .

&quot; if you s@@ wap the steps 4 and 5 , what you can do well if the initial contrast was already very good , then you can perform the first four adjustment with the white balance module . &quot;
many tools you need the photo editing can be found in &amp; digi@@ kam . your description will follow here .
&quot; use a uniform dialog type that displays the effect in a preview before the filter is applied to the current image . below you can see &amp; quot ; Tex@@ ture applic@@ ation@@ quot ; in this dialog : &quot;
( 1 ) : this progress bar shows the status of the filter on the current image . to the left of it allow five buttons to change the comparison mode of the preview area . these modes are :
&quot; ver@@ tically divide without dup@@ licate . the left area shows the original and the right shows the filter applied to the area right of the selected area . &quot;
horizontal parts without dup@@ licate . the upper area shows the original and the lower shows the filter applied to the area below the selected preview area .
the left panel shows the original and the right to compare the effect of the filter .
the upper area shows the original and the lower to compare the effect of the filter .
&quot; mouse over &apos; -@@ style : displays the preview when the mouse is not in the preview area , otherwise the original . &quot;
( 2 ) : there are two buttons that you can turn on to show over@@ - and under@@ exposure . the used colours can be adjusted in the general setup page .
( 3 ) : the frame to select the preview . you can drag this frame with the mouse inside the image and place it on the part of the image from which you want to see the preview . preview in the left part of the dialog will be updated immediately .
( 5 ) : in the left lower corner : here is a help and the option to reset all buttons to your default values .
the page bar features the essential information about the selected image and is largely self @-@ explan@@ atory . it is group@@ ed in the following sections :
photo features : displays a summary of the most important parameters when shooting the photo . these data are from the EX@@ IF data when they are available .
this tab provides an intuitive map search tool based on the Mar@@ ble mini program . you can use the mouse wheel or zoom out it and move it . move it while you click on the left mouse button . all images within these coordinates are filtered and displayed . of course this pres@@ upp@@ oses your images ge@@ o @-@ data .
&amp; k@@ color@@ edit ; is an editor for pall@@ ets files . the application can be used to edit color pal@@ ettes and select colors .
&quot; the Pal@@ etten files that are installed by &amp; k@@ de may apply either to the whole system or just one user . in the latter case , they are located in your Personal folder for &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Settings and hot user defined color and net@@ worked colors . &quot;
&quot; in the dialog palette , you can select from a list of installed pall@@ ets or browse the folders by files . &quot;
the cur@@ sor is shown in the p@@ allet view as a line . it can be moved by cli@@ cked on the area next to a color .
it indicates the color next to it . the color is described below the p@@ allet view . here the color name can also be changed .
&quot; to create such a selection , click the area next to a color to move the cur@@ sor to it . then move the mouse with pressed left mouse button . &quot;
&quot; if the box Bei@@ m cur@@ sor is activated under the button color , the color is inserted from the color chart at the cur@@ sor . the color is either inserted or over@@ writes another ; depending on whether the mode over@@ write is selected . this mode can be set by selecting the title Over@@ write under the cur@@ sor . &quot;
&quot; a selection that was created as described in the last section can be used together with the actions of copying , cutting and paste . &quot;
&quot; use the following format for data in the clip@@ board : for each color three values for the proportions of red , green and blue and an optional color name followed by a new@@ line , if there are three numbers in the clip@@ board , can be inserted as a color in &amp; k@@ color@@ edit ; &quot;
the colors in the palette and the output of color selection can be drag@@ ged with the mouse .
select a color somewhere on the screen and then find them in the color choos@@ er on the left side .
&quot; graph@@ vi@@ z ; programs are free layout programs . graph@@ s are used in science , especially in computer science . so far , there was no modern &amp; GUI ; program to visu@@ alize graph@@ s . &quot;
the &amp; k@@ graph@@ viewer ; -@@ Project aims to replace these programs with a modern and user @-@ friendly graphical interface with all functions of a well integrated &amp; k@@ de ; program .
&amp; k@@ studi@@ viewer ; is a K@@ DE program to view &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ dot ; -@@ graph@@ s ; programs are free layout programs . &amp; k@@ graph@@ viewer ; displays graph@@ s with all possibilities of a well integrated &amp; k@@ de ; program in a modern and user @-@ friendly &amp; GUI ; it has the following functions :
integration in &amp; k@@ ate ; and &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; ( so that a change of graph@@ ene in &amp; k@@ ate ; the graph@@ s re@@ comp@@ utes and in &amp; k@@ graph@@ viewer ; )
menu to open the graph@@ s in &amp; k@@ ate ; open or open the graph@@ s in &amp; k@@ graph@@ viewer ; in a &amp; k@@ ate ; component to open
loading of big graph@@ s ( currently there are problems starting from around 1000 knots and a h@@ ack to show more than that node )
&quot; further needed software : &amp; k@@ rep@@ viewer ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; program , which pres@@ upp@@ oses the &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; tool &amp; dot ; for representation of graph@@ s . &quot;
&quot; the main window shows the opened graph@@ s , each in its own sub@@ window . initially , if you start &amp; k@@ rep@@ viewer ; without an argument , the main window will only open the symbol file and the ( empty ) list of last opened files . click the first icon to view the dialog file . &quot;
&quot; after you have selected one or more dot files , the main window looks like in the lower screen shot : &quot;
&quot; as you can see , an overview is displayed in the corner when the graph is larger than the canvas . you can select a fixed position of this overview with the context menu or select this position automatically . &quot;
&quot; use the mouse wheel ( high and down without special buttons , left and right with pressed &amp; alt ; -@@ button ) ; &quot;
the zo@@ oming is limited in both directions by factor 10 . below you see the maximum reduction of a graph .
&quot; if the currently loaded file has been modified by another program , the following window will be displayed : &quot;
&quot; you can choose whether the graph should be re@@ charged or if you want to ignore the change . &amp; k@@ rep@@ viewer ; if you want to change your decision later . if you want to change your decision later , you can set up the menu item Settings k@@ rep@@ viewer ; set up ... use , see also . &quot;
&quot; if you open a graph@@ s outside of a running &amp; k@@ rep@@ viewer ; instance open , &amp; eg ; in the file browser or at the command line , you have the choice whether you want to open a new &amp; k@@ rep@@ viewer ; instance , or want to display the loaded graph in a sub@@ window of the current instance . &quot;
&quot; as with the last option , you can save your choice permanently , but also change it with the setup dialog . &quot;
&quot; at the program start , you can open all the graph@@ s of your last session again . once again , you can save your choice both and later . &quot;
you can also specify how the graph should be divided into several pages . the number of horizontal and vertical pages can be chosen freely .
&quot; if you use multiple pages , you can choose whether the parts of the graph that are on one side are to be adjusted to this page . if you maintain the aspect ratio , the pages may not be filled by the respective parts of the graph . &quot;
page preview with a graph@@ ene distributed on several pages without head@@ line and with another font
&quot; the Rest@@ ore shop gives the option of setting the behavior when a file has been modified on the hard drive , &amp; eg ; from another program . you can set a default behavior ( automatically rel@@ o@@ ad or ignore the changes ) or the program each time . &quot;
&quot; opening gives the possibility to specify the behavior of &amp; k@@ rep@@ viewer ; if a graph is opened outside a current session , you can set a default behavior for this case ( opening the graph in a new window or in a sub@@ window of the already running session ) or determine that each time is requested . &quot;
you can set a default behavior ( open or un@@ lock the files of the last session or not ) or decide to be asked for each start .
&quot; the context menu , which usually appears with a click in the main window with the &amp; R@@ MB@@ s , opens up further options : &quot;
&quot; here you can choose from various &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ layout algorithms . the entries , as described on the web page of &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; are : &quot;
&quot; algorithm , the standard for directed graph@@ s . it produces hierarch@@ ical or lay@@ ered graph@@ s of directed graph@@ s . the algorithm lays the edges in the same direction ( from top to bottom or from left to right ) and then tries to produce as short edges as possible as possible edges . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; ne@@ ato ; algorithm is the standard for ung@@ eri@@ zed graph@@ s . it produces presentations according to the spr@@ int spring model . thereby , the Kam@@ ada Ka@@ wa@@ i algorithm is used , which is syn@@ onymous with statistical multi@@ dimensional sc@@ aling . &quot;
the &amp; fd@@ p ; algorithm creates a spring@@ board model for ung@@ eri@@ zed graph@@ s . it uses the Fru@@ et@@ man Rein@@ gold He@@ ur@@ istics and includes a multi @-@ skel@@ eton for the treatment of large and clu@@ ster@@ ous graph@@ s .
&quot; the &amp; Cir@@ co ; algorithm arran@@ ges the no@@ des circular in accordance with the description of Six and Tol@@ lis , 1999 , and K@@ auff@@ man and Wiese , 2002 . it is useful for certain graph@@ s of multiple cy@@ c@@ lic structures . &quot;
&quot; open a dialog where you can specify a layout command , which is then executed from a shell . the command should output the graph file as parameters , and output the calculated layout of graph@@ s to st@@ d@@ out in x@@ dot format . with such a layout command you can specify &amp; eg ; modify the graph with a filter before it is drawn . &quot;

&quot; if you choose the option Modi@@ fy the size of the photos before upload , the photos are changed in front of the upload in size . the size is taken from the value registered at Maximum size . &quot;
the maximum size can be used to specify the maximum height of the images . the size is changed so that the aspect ratio remains constant .
the K@@ IP@@ I module Gallery export is a tool to export your collection collection to a gallery server
&quot; the K@@ IP@@ I module Gallery @-@ Export currently has no documentation . if you are interested in writing this , please contact the K@@ IP@@ I team at k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de.@@ or@@ g. Attention : the participants of this list speak English . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I module for geographic loc@@ alization allows to add and edit GPS coordinates in the metadata of an image . geographic data are stored in the EX@@ IF keywords of the image and loc@@ alization can be displayed in a map in an external browser .
&quot; the K@@ IP@@ I module for geographic loc@@ alization provides tools for loc@@ alizing images ge@@ ographi@@ cally in the sp@@ her@@ ical coordinate system used by GPS and Galil@@ eo . height , long@@ itudinal and latitude are used . &quot;
to cor@@ relate your images with geographic data you need a GPS track as XML file in g@@ p@@ x format . g@@ ps@@ b@@ abel and g@@ ps@@ man can download and convert the data for you from your GPS device .
image Ge@@ ographical loc@@ alization cor@@ rel@@ ator . this interface can merge a number of previously selected images with a GPS track .
&quot; select the images you want to cor@@ relate in the main window and call the menu . the dialog appears above . in order to run a possible correlation over time and loc@@ alization , you need to load a track file with GP@@ X file . this file contains of course data that were recorded at the same locations as the images of your camera . &quot;
&quot; when the file is loaded an automatic correlation , which indicates the coordinates in red . GPS lane data are recorded in GMT time and therefore the camera time must be converted to GMT . this can be done with the time zone . &quot;
the setting for the maximum time devi@@ ation gives an upper vari@@ ance for the GPS @-@ time and camera @-@ time . if the devi@@ ation below is the data merged . the maximum value for this is 2000 seconds .
&quot; if you do not have any trace data from a place for images , you can edit the g@@ p@@ x file manually and add to the images . the time difference of 2000 seconds will then cor@@ relate all images in this area . &quot;
&quot; the options Inter@@ pol@@ ishing and Differ@@ ence in minutes can be used if you do not have the appropriate data . if you know that in reality a location is located in a large time difference between camera and GPS , you can set these limits here and then press the button cor@@ related to inter@@ pol@@ ishing . &quot;
the coordinates can be set manually with this dialog . this is useful if you have made a number of photos in the same place . since the dialog box coordinates the coordinates from a call to the next one you just need to use the button OK to set the data in the current photo .
&quot; the location can also be found and set by the displayed map . select the region and enlarge it . choose the region and enlarge it . the height must always be selected manually . the card can be changed manually between card mode , satellite image and a mixed mode . &quot;
&quot; completely outside of the K@@ IP@@ I module , there are possibilities to attach the GPS data to the images . here is a small script that uses the ex@@ i@@ ft@@ ool to provide a stack of images with GPS data . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I module gallery is a tool to export a set of albums as HTML pages .
this module can export your albums to a gallery from HTML pages to version 4.0@@ 1 . you can select the albums that are exported as HTML pages and specify the parameters for the HTML pages . the character set is enco@@ ded UT@@ F @-@ 8 to enable the best internation@@ alization .
&quot; the panel has four tab@@ s in which the settings can be adjusted . the tab selection allows you to select all albums that are to be exported to HTML . you don &apos;t need to select these albums . in the area below , you can quickly select a large number of albums . in the area below will display the preview and the text that will appear in the header of the HTML page . &quot;
&quot; the rider &apos;s appearance defines the general look and layout for each page . this tab is largely self explan@@ atory . if you then click on a picture , a new page will be displayed in which the image is displayed . otherwise the image will appear directly with your standard image viewer , &amp; eg ; Ku@@ ick@@ show , displayed &quot;
the tab album defines the settings where and how the gallery is to be saved with all your related images . a sub@@ folder containing the name K@@ IP@@ I@@ HTML@@ Export that contains everything will be created there .
&quot; if you have selected the JPEG file format , the EX@@ IF information of your original images will also be saved in the new images . &quot;
&quot; with other color depth , you can change the default color depth . of course , this also influences the file size . all other settings are self explan@@ atory . &quot;
&quot; the thumb@@ nail tab allows you to adjust some of the settings from the Album tab for thumb@@ nails , these are small images that are displayed in the gallery . &quot;
a progress window shows the user how far the action is . push cancel to break the process .
&quot; if the module has created the pages , the window will not be closed automatically . you can therefore read the program messages to determine if errors occurred during the creation . the web browser will be started automatically at the end to preview the preview of the gallery . press C@@ lose to close the module . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I image viewer is a very fast and flexible Open@@ GL based tool to view images .
&quot; the K@@ IP@@ I image viewer allows you to view a selection of pictures and use basic operations such as rot@@ ations , zo@@ oming or moving . the viewer can be used with short commands and folders . it was developed for fast image display and quick access to its functions . &quot;
&quot; after the start , an image is displayed by default in full screen mode . this can be changed into a window mode . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I JPEG Los@@ s@@ free module is a tool to change images without affecting your quality .
&quot; this module allows for the actions below to save images in JPEG format , without the usual loss of quality or metadata . &quot;
&quot; the consequence of the loss @-@ free storage is that the file size rises , as there is no compression of the color formations occurring . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I module digital camera client is a tool to connect your computer to a digital camera .
&quot; the K@@ IP@@ I module digital camera client currently has no documentation . if you are interested in writing this , please contact the K@@ IP@@ I team at k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de.@@ or@@ g. Attention : the participants of this list speak English . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I module has no documentation currently . if you want to change this situation please contact the k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .org of the K@@ IP@@ I team .
&quot; with the Import function of the metadata module , you can copy data from one image to another . then select the image that you want to copy in the main program and then open the file selection dialog with which you want to copy the metadata . the data will be copied after clicking on the button OK . &quot;
&quot; this function does not work with all image formats . you can copy from anywhere , but not write in any destination format . JPEG is supported while writing . please take a look ex@@ iv@@ 2 to see which formats are supported . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I MPEG Ko@@ di@@ ver Module is a tool to convert a number of images to a MPEG video in the form of a slide show .
&quot; the MPEG Ko@@ di@@ ver module can be used to convert selected images into a MPEG video , with a defined length , to convert . this module uses the packages M@@ jp@@ eg@@ Tools and Image@@ Mag@@ ick . you can also add an audio file in the MP@@ 2 or WAV the slide show . &quot;
&quot; all images are automatically sc@@ aled to the correct size for the selected video format . in addition , you can create a background color for the slide show . with this module it is possible to create the formats DVD / X@@ V@@ CD / SV@@ CD / V@@ CD for your DVD player . to burn the medium you can finally use the K@@ 3@@ b program . &quot;
you must first select the images that are to be packed into the MPEG slide show . then you can start creating the module via Extras MPEG slides .
the images you selected are then listed under image files in the portfolio . there you can also change the images or the contents of the list .
&quot; the video format can be selected from different formats , DVD , X@@ V@@ CD , SV@@ CD and V@@ CD . if you plan to play the file on a TV , you need to select the appropriate TV standard PAL , SE@@ CAM or NT@@ SC . PAL is pres@@ et and most likely the right choice for Europe . &quot;
&quot; in the next step , you should specify the time in seconds that displays an image . the speed of the image transmission is specified below . a low value creates very sudden , a high contrast very smooth image changes . &quot;
&quot; the background color can be set next . in doubt , you should leave it black . you can set the name and path of the generated file under name of the m@@ peg output file . keep the extension mp@@ g as possible . &quot;
&quot; if you specify an audio file under name of the audio source file , then it will be integrated into the movie . after you have adjusted all settings to your preferences , you can start the production of the movie with the button code . depending on the speed of your computer you can now quickly or enjoy a coffee and enjoy the slide show when you are back . &quot;
&quot; if a note appears that co@@ dec or tools are missing , you can adjust the paths to the programs of the M@@ jp@@ eg@@ Tools and Image@@ Mag@@ ick packages via the button Settings on the right . &quot;
the print wiz@@ ard allows you to print multiple images on a sheet of paper together in standard photo sizes . the combined images can also be automatically opened using the Gim@@ p image processing .
&quot; with this K@@ IP@@ I module you can import or convert your stored images stored in RAW format in one of three formats JPEG , TIFF or P@@ PM . &quot;
&quot; the conversion is based on the command @-@ line tool d@@ cra@@ w of Dave Coff@@ in . an original proportion of Him is : do not expect it to produce the same results as the software from your camera manufacturer . sometimes , you get with d@@ cra@@ w better results ! &quot;
&quot; first , select the RAW file to be converted and start the module . the Raw image converter window then appears in mode for a single image . with the button preview you can view the effect of your current settings on the image . &quot;
&quot; you can now adjust the values to optimize the conversion process . the first option determines if the camera settings should be used for the white balance . the main parameters such as g@@ amma , brightness and red / blue ampli@@ fiers can be adjusted . if the result is not optimal , you can edit the image later . &quot;
&quot; a four @-@ colour R@@ GB@@ G conversion can be selected , so that you can use the contrast information . if your camera works in RGB mode , the R@@ GB@@ G switch has no effect . &quot;
&quot; once you are satisfied with the preview , you can choose one of the three output formats and save the conversion result . the filename stays the same , and only the extension will be adjusted accordingly . JPEG uses a loss@@ less algorithm and produces the smallest file sizes . &quot;
&quot; the Tagged image format , TIFF , re@@ tains all the information of your image and uses loss@@ less L@@ Z@@ W compression . &quot;
&quot; if you are planning to edit your images frequently or otherwise , you should not choose JPEG format since there is only a limited number of operations allowed before the image quality deteri@@ or@@ ates . TIFF and P@@ PM are better adapted to keep the original data . &quot;
&quot; if you choose JPEG as a storage format , the metadata that is included in the RAW file is stored in the JPEG file in the Exif information . &quot;
&quot; if you have adjusted your settings , you can start the conversion with the trigger button . if you want to cancel this process again , you can use ab@@ ort . &quot;
&quot; batch processing mode allows you to convert different images at one time . therefore , use this mode if you are sure , e.g. by testing on a single image , which are the best settings . &quot;
&quot; the available settings are almost identical to the version for individual images . however , you have the possibility to over@@ write existing file automatically . this is helpful if it was created in an earlier attempt . however , a preview is not available . the progress bar shows how far the conversion is advanced . &quot;
this module can be used to convert all images in an album . it uses the convert program convert from the Image@@ Mag@@ ick package . the following image formats are supported :
&quot; this module can be used to ren@@ ame all images of an album . you can set the pre@@ fix , the start number and the tim@@ est@@ amp of the album . &quot;
this module can be used to change the size of multiple images of a picture collection . it uses the convert program from the Image@@ Mag@@ ick package .
&quot; proportional ( 1 Dim . ) : normal size change in one dimension . the width or height of the image is selected automatically , depending on image orientation , selected . the aspect ratio remains unchanged . &quot;
proportional ( 2 Dim . ) : size change in two dimensions . here the aspect ratio remains unchanged . you can use this option for example to adjust your image to the screen format .
not proportional : not proportional res@@ izing in two dimensions . the aspect ratio is changed with this option .
&quot; preparation : prepare the image for the photo print . the user can adjust the print resolution and the size of the photo paper . the target image , including background size , border size and background color , will be adjusted accordingly . &quot;
with this K@@ IP@@ I module you can send selected images with your preferred e @-@ mail program . it is also possible to change the size of the images to be sent beforehand .
&quot; once you have started the module , the image window will be displayed with the images you require . you can add more images using a file selection dialog . for the last selected picture , a preview will be shown on the right side . &quot;
you can also drag images to the picture list and put it down to add you to the list of images to be sent .
with the button images remove the selected images from the list of images to be sent .
&quot; after you have selected all the images , you can open the new message window from your e @-@ mail client with the button OK . you only have to add the addresses and the subject . &quot;
don &apos;t pay too many pictures at once . most e @-@ mail accounts have limitations to the size of sending emails . it may be a good idea to send multiple mails if you want to send a lot of pictures .
the e @-@ mail window is used to change the settings for sending the images . your configuration is stored and used every@@ time until you change it .
&quot; select your e @-@ mail client from the menu . if you select Thunder@@ bird , you need to specify the correct path for your installation in the input field below . &quot;
&quot; if you use the Google Mail Service , you must first install the G@@ mail agent on your computer . you can download it here . &quot;
&quot; after selecting comments in an attached file , the comments will be added to the images in a text file and added to the mail . &quot;
&quot; the PNG format under the menu Images file format is not very suitable to reduce the size of photo files , but it is best adapted to loss@@ less formats like e.g. TIFF . you should therefore use PNG if you have a fast internet connection and the photo quality should not be changed . otherwise we recommend the JPEG format . &quot;
&quot; if you select JPEG under pictures file format and are the original files in JPEG format , then the original ex@@ if@@ data will be added to the images to be sent . &quot;
&quot; when the process is done , the window will not automatically be closed so that you can view the status messages , searching for errors . however , your e @-@ mail program will be started automatically at the end . &quot;
&quot; after starting the module Advanced Di@@ asch@@ au , a window with questions like you want to display your slide show . you can choose between the selected and all pictures of the album . &quot;
&quot; the Open@@ GL transi@@ tions option in the presentation enables very elegant image transi@@ tions using Open@@ GL . however , you must have a corresponding graphics card , otherwise the slide show will be very slow . &quot;
the file name option will show that the file name will be shown in the left lower corner during the presentation .
the loop option ensures that the presentation is displayed in a loop loop . you can then manually cancel it with Es@@ c .
the option images acci@@ dentally select ensures that the images are displayed in random order . so it does not use the order of the images in the album .
&quot; between the images , the time distance between the images can be set . 1500 mill@@ is@@ ec@@ onds correspond to 1.5 seconds and are a good default value . however , the best distance depends on your computer and the selected transition effect . &quot;
there are over a dozen transi@@ tional effects that you can choose . random at any transition between the images choos@@ es another effect .
&quot; during the slide show , you can access a tool@@ bar at the top left of the screen . move the mouse into this corner to turn on . &quot;
&quot; with this tool@@ bar , you can stop the presentation and start again , jump to the previous one and the next picture and stop the slide show . &quot;
&quot; on the left bottom of the screen you can view the current filename , the position of the current image and the total number of pictures in your presentation . &quot;

the K@@ IP@@ I module background image is a tool for setting an image as a background image for the desktop .
&quot; this module sets the currently selected image , depending on the selected sub@@ menu option , as background for your K@@ DE work surface . &quot;
&quot; as soon as you have provided your pictures and videos with notes , you can use &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; see picture . as you can see through a comparison with the image , you are now available in each group , i.e. in persons , places and in group keywords . &quot;
&quot; in the browser window , you will see the categories for which you have entered information when you look at your images and videos with ann@@ ot@@ ations . in addition , there are entries to look for EX@@ IF @-@ based information to view the folder structure on your hard drive and of course see the current preview images . &quot;
&quot; if you press persons with the mouse on the entry , the view of the browser changes . see picture . &quot;
this selection method allows you to limit the number of images displayed by a few thousand images to a few images .
&quot; if you have selected all the people , places and other settings , you can view thumb@@ nails to view the images of your field of activity . &quot;
&quot; in the picture , each person has the same icon in front of their name . &quot;
&quot; in order to view images next to the names , select the button that is located right outside on the tool@@ bar . in the appearing context menu , you can select which view you want to use for the current category . this has the advantage that you can display symbols with images of persons and at the same time a list of keywords ( if you don &apos;t have any suitable images for your keywords ) . &quot;
&quot; however , you have to specify which image is to be displayed for each individual person . to do this , you need to view the image preview window ( described in detail ) , and in the context menu you can select the image for the appropriate person . in the panel window , you can select the magni@@ fication factor to your wishes and thus select which part of the image should be displayed or cut off . &quot;
&quot; when you invo@@ ke the entry in the main window , you will see a dialog that is very similar to the dialog for determining the image properties . you can view this dialog at once . &quot;
&quot; if you enter a string in the inscription or description , the descriptions or descriptions of the pictures are searched for this text . if you want , you can also be a part of the total data , i.e. in 1971 , or the entire date . you can also use a range of two data , such as 1971 @-@ 1980 . &quot;
&quot; with the options at the bottom of the window , you can browse all the images according to certain names as you can see in the picture . here , according to images , on which Jes@@ per , but not Anne Hel@@ ene are shown . &quot;
&quot; this is the user manual for &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; . if you don &apos;t like to read manuals , but want to try out the same features , you have the following alternatives to this manual : &quot;
&quot; go to the homepage of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; and watch the quick entry , the screen@@ shots and the introduc@@ tory videos . &quot;
&quot; start &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; and in the first dialog , select the demo in case you start &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; start for the first time or select the menu entry k@@ photo@@ album ; then you can download some sample images and you can try the functions of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; try out . &quot;
&quot; if you prefer to print this manual , you can find it on the homepage of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; as a coher@@ ent HTML document to download . &quot;
&quot; at the bottom of the main window of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album , see the tim@@ eline . an image of this list shows you here : . as the name suggests , this list shows you date statistics on the images in your database . &quot;
&quot; you can switch between the units years , months , weeks , hours and 10 minutes . on the picture you can see a part of a database , showing only 10 @-@ minute sections . &quot;
&quot; the tim@@ eline can be used inter@@ actively in the following ways : you can change the displayed preview view from the database ( if you select a date , the first image of this date will be shown in the preview pane ) and the tim@@ eline always displays the current date of the currently displayed images when you navigate in the preview view . &quot;
&quot; you can also select a section of the tim@@ eline by holding the mouse button and drag@@ ging the mouse over the ruler of the tim@@ eline , i.e. the tim@@ est@@ amps . you can cancel the selection by clicking on a log of the tim@@ eline . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; provides you two ways to create HTML web pages with your images . the one is in &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; integrated and the other is available as module ( see ) . in the following part of the user manual , the in &amp; k@@ photo@@ album is described ; you can call the menu file HTML ... &quot;
&quot; before creating HTML pages , you need to make some settings . these are divided into the three areas content , layout and finish . in the following each area is described more accurately . &quot;
&quot; first , enter the title of the title and a description that will contain the HTML file later . on k@@ photo@@ album ; HTML sample pages you can see an example for these settings . &quot;
&quot; next , select whether a &amp; k@@ photo@@ album is to be created ; the export file is to be created on the overview page . for more information on export files , please refer to . &quot;
&quot; finally , you can select which information to be displayed on the HTML pages . this allows you to avoid that information displayed on the viewer can be displayed without a description . for example , all pictures of a party are exported . therefore , you cannot use this setting to hide certain images from certain viewers . &quot;
&quot; in this field , you can specify how the HTML pages should look like . most settings are unique , which is why not specifically dealt with . &quot;
&quot; at the bottom of the page you can set various resolutions for the images . this means that those who are viewing your website and have a monitor that supports the maximum resolution 800@@ x@@ 600 , do not download images , such as a resolution of 1600@@ x@@ 1200 . &quot;
&quot; the viewer of your site can change the resolution at any time you have defined . so , it can search your images with low resolution , which results in a lower transmission time , and if it wants to get a larger image , it changes to a higher resolution . &quot;
&quot; in this setting , set the different folders and the URL where your website is stored . &quot;
&quot; best choose a base folder for all your HTML files , and a new sub@@ folder for each subsequent set . &quot;
&quot; first , you need to select the main folder where all your images are stored . this folder will be saved and automatically added to the next time . this allows you to select either a folder or a K@@ DE supported protocol , for example : &quot;
&quot; after you have created your images , you can check if they are all visible to viewers . if you choose a URL for the base folder , a web browser , after the pages have been created , should be the folder . otherwise , the web browser will start in the wrong folder . &quot;
&quot; this is not the sub@@ folder of the current files , but the base folder in which all sub@@ folders are located . &quot;
&quot; the settings described above have all three to base folders and URLs . in them , a sub@@ folder is created , whose name can be specified in the output folder . &quot;
&quot; if you are coming together on a family celebration , a meeting in the company , a conference or somewhere else , with other users of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; you might want to create your images with these . however , if you have already spent a lot of time to compile the images , you have to do with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; this work will not even make you happen . &quot;
&quot; with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album , you can export a copy of your images into a .@@ k@@ im file . &quot;
&quot; there are two different types of .@@ k@@ im files , internal and external . &quot;
&quot; you can create a .@@ k@@ im file either directly from the File Export menu ... or along with HTML pages , see , create . if you create a .@@ k@@ im file together with a HTML file , this will be an external .@@ k@@ im file . &quot;
&quot; an external .@@ k@@ im file searches the images in two ways . first , it searches for the images that are located in the folder of the .@@ k@@ im file . this is of course only possible if you have created your .@@ k@@ im file using HTML @-@ Export . &quot;
&quot; in the following , the dialog will be described for exp@@ orting images that you can access to the Export menu . &quot;
the most important option of this dialog is whether it should be internal or external .@@ k@@ im files . there are three choices available to you :
&quot; if you want to copy manually to the .@@ k@@ im file , you need to copy the images to the same folder as the .@@ k@@ im file . &quot;
with the Automati@@ cally Copy to the vicinity of the .@@ k@@ im file copying &amp; photo@@ album ; the images automatically for you .
&quot; because most of the pictures have already been compressed with JPEG and the XML file itself is very small , it &apos;s usually not worth to comp@@ ress the files . if you want to do so , simply select the Export file option . &quot;
&quot; the last option of this page is maximum image size . if you send pictures to your friends , you might not want to send the images in full size as the .@@ k@@ im file would otherwise be very big . here you can limit the size by saying that each image should be at most 800 pixels high and wide . &quot;
&quot; if you import a file with the extension .@@ k@@ im from the web browser or from the File menu file ... select , &amp; k@@ Photo@@ album ; import the exported database as described in . &quot;
&quot; the wiz@@ ard to import consists of four steps . first you need to select which pictures you want to import , then , in which folder the import images are to be copied . &quot;
&quot; it may be that you person@@ alize the category persons of the file to be imported ( if you are a domain ) , while this category is named in your database . therefore , you will be asked in the third dialog box , which categories of the imported file are to be imported and what categories are in your database . &quot;
&quot; in the fourth step , you can compare the categories of the file to be imported with the categories of your present database . for example , see the image . &quot;
&quot; it has to be easy to browse pictures and view : if you look at pictures , you often want to jump inside of different picture groups &amp; m@@ d@@ ash ; if you want to see pictures of your Italy vacation and discover a picture with your friend on it , you might want to see all the images on which this friend is depicted . &quot;
&quot; in this manual , you will find the different steps of ( 1 ) Set@@ ting the information about your pictures , about ( 2 ) searching and viewing , through to ( 3 ) advanced topics and custom@@ ization options . &quot;
&quot; K@@ Photo@@ Album was started as a program to manage your pictures . however , it has been expanded and today your videos will also take care of . in many places in this manual , pictures are spoken , but often this also includes videos . &quot;
&quot; it is a simple XML file that you can backup with a program of your choice , e.g. Nor@@ mal backup tools , copy on a disk or re@@ visions in CV@@ S , where you want . &quot;
&quot; for example : k@@ photo@@ album -@@ c ~ / Company / Pictures / index@@ .@@ xml . for example : k@@ photo@@ album -@@ c ~ / Company / Pictures / index@@ .@@ xml &quot;
&quot; in the following section of the user manual , the various settings will be explained in the following section of the user manual . &quot;
&quot; on the left you see six different symbols , with which you can access settings of preview and options for the viewer . for each setting a detailed help is available , which you can access by a push button on the F1 key and a click on the desired option . &quot;
&quot; you can also define your own groups such as objects , animals or albums . &quot;
&quot; see the dialog used to process existing groups . for each existing group , you can select a cap@@ tion and a symbol . &quot;
&quot; sub@@ categories were already mentioned in the section . in the dialog Options , you can set up complete members groups , i.e. all members of a group at once in a group instead of all groups of a medi@@ ator as explained in . &quot;
&quot; in the left half of the window , you can select the category you want to configure . in the left half of the window there is a list of the current category and in the right a list of sub@@ categories . &quot;
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; spl@@ its its modular system with other graphic applications such as digi@@ K@@ am and G@@ wen@@ view . this module system is called K@@ IP@@ I and means &amp; k@@ de ; image plugin interface .
&quot; the modules can be called via the menu modules . the modules can and are not described in this manual because they are not part of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; but they are distributed separately , but most modules have a help page that you can access through the modules themselves . &quot;
&quot; since the modules of multiple applications are used together among each other , it may be that the modules with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album have been tested . therefore , you should first test new modules with the demo database first before you use it on your own images ; Demo data base can be viewed either via the command line &gt; k@@ photo@@ album -@@ Demo &lt; user@@ input \ &gt; or via the Help menu . don &apos;t say I would not have warned you ! &quot;
&quot; the applications that the modules use via K@@ IP@@ I are very different , so it can be that some modules with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album are not working . this is the dis@@ advantage when sharing features with different applications . &quot;
&quot; the biggest difference between &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; and other applications that also use K@@ IP@@ I , is that the other applications do not support their images in albums . even though &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; this sort of order is not supported , it simul@@ ates the order according to albums so that you can use the functions with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album . &quot;
&quot; it simul@@ ates &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the current album , which is just the current view , so all the images that show you the picture show at the moment . &quot;
&quot; apart from the current album , &amp; k@@ photo@@ album needs to be handed over ; the modules also have a list of albums . here , &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; as follows : &quot;
&quot; if &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; s Browser shows the content of a category , for example , all persons , then each entry of this category is an album for the module . &quot;
&quot; for example , if you would like to use the category persons , &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; so do , so if you would have chosen people to view and pass on to the module . &quot;
&quot; since some modules with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album are not compatible , you can remove them from the list of modules . &quot;
on the picture you can see an example of a start screen as soon as you &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; start with your own pictures .
&quot; as you are used by any other K@@ DE application , you will see a menu and tool@@ bar at the top . &quot;
&quot; one of the main features of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; is the possibility to display any image with ann@@ ot@@ ations . this includes information about the persons depicted on the picture , etc . you can set any image either individually or for a larger number of images at the same time . if for example on all pictures Jes@@ per is shown and all pictures taken in Copenhagen . &quot;
&quot; all these notes can be used for searching and browsing , as you can read in the section . if you want you can see these notes if you use the built @-@ in viewer . &quot;
&quot; see three lists with a text box by setting people , places and keywords . these are a very important part of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; because you will always use them again when you enter information about your pictures . &quot;
&quot; the following idea is based on shifting the images within the list : for example , if you have a family celebration and shown on all 50 pictures the same 5 @-@ 10 persons , you can , by making the names used up to the top , find the persons faster and assign them . &quot;
&quot; if you prefer to see an alphabe@@ tically sorted list , click on the symbol for sorting by date under the list . &quot;
&quot; if you have selected notes for each image individually , you may want to edit all selected images and edit these images with ann@@ ot@@ ations . in this case , simply click on the front and back buttons , which are below the preview of the picture on the right . &quot;
&quot; if you have taken several pictures , e.g. with the same person , then it can be more convenient to mark all these pictures and use the menu item Sever@@ al entries once with a note . &quot;
&quot; Las Vegas , San Francisco , Los Angeles and California are all located in the USA . in addition , San Francisco and Los Angeles are located in California . &quot;
&quot; on the picture you can see a browser window that displays the USA as an over@@ group . to show you that it is an over@@ group , a special symbol is displayed . &quot;
&quot; in the context menu of the Comment dialog , it is possible to add an entry to an existing or new over@@ - or sub@@ category . additionally , you can also drag one entry to a category and place it to sub@@ category this entry . caution , this assumes you just sort your categories alphabe@@ tically . see for it . &quot;
&quot; you can move the individual elements of the Comment dialog by clicking on the buttons that form the top edge of the frame , click and move . you can also make a separate window from a frame by drag@@ ging it out of the window area . &quot;
&quot; if you have adapted the look of the window to your needs so that you are satisfied with the settings , click on the Options ... that offers you the possibility to save the current setup and appearance of the window . &quot;
&quot; you can also completely f@@ ade a frame . if you want to display this window later , use the button Options ... and here you can hide windows . this process shows you in the picture . &quot;
&quot; if you select the entry images in the browser , you will get an overview of preview images of the currently selected pictures , or all pictures if you do not have a filter . an example for this you can see here . you can configure the size of thumb@@ nails by simply drag the mouse with the middle mouse button . &quot;
&quot; if you drop a picture on the background of your desktop , this image is set up as a background image for your desktop . &quot;
&quot; once you click on an image , it will appear in the image viewer . if you do not have a window with an image viewer , a new display window will be created . &quot;
&quot; you can also delete images in the preview . simply select the corresponding images from which you want to delete and select either the remove button , or select the Edit menu in the Edit menu . now the window will appear that you can see in the picture . &quot;
&quot; you can use &amp; k@@ photo@@ album for this problem . you can also use it with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; you can also use the images somewhere , so &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; you can see the view of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; if not all required images can be loaded from the hard drive . &quot;
&quot; images in which the right upper corner is cut off are not saved on the hard drive . however , the thumb@@ nails are present for pictures 5 @-@ 9 , so that the preview of these images can be displayed . however , you can &apos;t view these pictures with the image viewer . &quot;
&quot; as you can see , this function requires that you copy files from folders and then copy them back . so if you want to avoid anno@@ y@@ ance about how to avoid inter@@ connecting your images , please purchase a larger disk to save all images . &quot;
&quot; in the Pictures menu , you will find a sub@@ menu with the name of privacy . if you want to have a little more privacy , you can filter the images so that at the end those images that you may want to see for others and click on Current View menu item All except current view locks . &quot;
&quot; so you have defined which pictures should be hidden in the case of the case . if you give the laptop to your little sister , simply select the menu entry to block images , thus removing all the images you want to view , click on lock . &quot;
&quot; it is also possible to set a password which has to be entered for un@@ locking the images . to set up this password , simply select password in the Privacy Code . &quot;
&quot; please bear in mind that this picture protection is by no means very safe . for one , all pictures on the disk and on the other can either read or delete the password as un@@ encrypted text . this type of password protection is only used to prevent those who are using &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; not very familiar to the view of private pictures . &quot;
&quot; the reason why you want to spend all your pictures with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; manage and spend hours over hours to describe it is natural that you want them to look at them some@@ time . for this reason , it has a picture _ and video viewer . you can preview it from the preview as described in . &quot;
&quot; you can see the viewer in view . of course he shows the image , but additional all the information you have entered through the image , such as who is on the picture , when and where it was made , etc . &quot;
&quot; if the information box on the upper part of the image you want to see , you can simply drag it with the mouse and place it somewhere else . you can also configure which information is displayed and whether information is displayed at all . all these options are available after a right @-@ click on the viewer . the then appearing context menu can be seen below . &quot;
&quot; if you click on Anne Hel@@ ene , the browser will show you all the images of Anne Hel@@ ene . as if you have selected people from the browser and then Anne Hel@@ ene . &quot;
&quot; if you have multiple images loaded in the viewer , you can switch between them and jump back by using the buttons image high and bottom . you can jump to the first and last picture with Pos@@ 1 and End . these functions are also available from the context menu . &quot;
&quot; when several images are loaded in the viewer , you can run them as slide show . &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; then load a new image after a few seconds . how often it can load a new image by pressing the C@@ trl key and plus or minus . &quot;
&quot; in this mode , the viewer uses the complete space on the screen . simply use the input key to switch to full@@ screen mode and back . &quot;
&quot; if you use the viewer , you can move into the picture and zoom out . for the zoom zoom , you can simply drag a rect@@ angle with the mouse . the minus button zo@@ oms in the middle of the picture . shows how a zoom rect@@ angle is selected and displays the result of the zoom . &quot;
&quot; with the point button , you can reset your zoom , so that the image is not zo@@ omed . with the key button the zo@@ oms set , so that each pixel on the screen corresponds to a pixel of the image . &quot;
&quot; note that the only zoom operations that work for videos , that are in and out with the plus and minus key . &quot;
&quot; with the functions from the context menu , you can rotate the image . this does not work with videos . you can comment to the current image with the menu item ann@@ ot@@ ation from the context menu . &quot;
&quot; when you look at pictures it can happen that you will find a picture with a person whose name you forgot to put on the picture . at the moment you can view the preview and open the configuration dialog of the image to insert this name . however , you might prefer to preview only the image and view more images . &quot;
&quot; another situation is that you want to send a number of images to a printer to develop the images on paper . to see which photos you want , you can start the viewer with the pictures and mark them as good or poor@@ ly , while you &apos;re one after the other . &quot;
&quot; characteristics are the letters A to Z and you can set a feature by pushing the corresponding letter . in view , see a picture where the features A , B and C are set . &quot;
&quot; this is described in detail . after that , you can use a module to copy the selected images to a CD or whatever you want to do . &quot;
&quot; categories and special features can be displayed in the preview view . if you can view categories in dre preview view , then you can add features to the images by simply pressing the letter for the attribute after the image was selected . this can be seen here : &quot;
sometimes it is not clear what you want to show on a picture . in this case you allow &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; to paint on the picture .
&quot; the mixture is not saved with the image , but in the database . in the way you can undo your mind later . &quot;
&quot; in order to switch off the painting mode of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album , select On the picture , select from the context menu . to quit the painting simply press the cross in the tool@@ bar top of the window . &quot;
&quot; to work with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er , you need to have the application of the program &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; not fully control , but the documentation on &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; should you absolutely have read and understand . &quot;
in the object tree you can select individual objects . then their properties are shown in the object properties and display the object in the wi@@ re@@ mod@@ ell@@ - views yellow .
&quot; you can also select multiple objects at the same time . but not the object of an already selected object , as all the objects are already selected with the object . &quot;
&quot; to insert a new object into the object tree , select the position where you want to insert the object and click on the tool@@ bar icon or select a menu item in the menu Insert . &quot;
&quot; if there are possible positions , the following drop @-@ down menu will be displayed , so that you can choose the right position : &quot;
&quot; by del@@ eting either from the menu bar , or from the context menu of the right mouse button , you can remove selected objects from the scene previously . &quot;
&quot; if you have changed properties , click App@@ ly to App@@ ly these changes . if you have left invalid values , a message will be displayed with an error description . then you can correct the input errors and click App@@ ly and disc@@ ard the changes with cancel . &quot;
&quot; if you enter the path to &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; enter user documentation in the setup dialog , you can call the &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; -@@ Reference to the displayed object with help . &quot;
&quot; you need the &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g or 3.5 H@@ MT@@ L user documentation to use this feature . if this documentation is not included in your distribution , you can download it here . &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; 3.5 already contains the user documentation . &quot;
&quot; if you edit a texture or part of a texture , you can preview a preview in the Properties view . &quot;
&quot; preview in the property view and a small example of the scene is rendered with the selected texture . as default the entire texture is rendered , even if you want to render a part of texture ( for example a texture within a texture map and not the entire texture map ) , you cross locally . &quot;
the screen shot shows the control points of the camera . you can drag these control points with the mouse button and change the position and direction of the camera .
&quot; when a transformation is selected , the control points disappear and there will be a small cross in the wire model view . this cross marks the center for sc@@ aling and rotation as well as position for shifts . you can change the shift by drag@@ ging with the mouse inside the entire window . &quot;
&quot; each object has a Vis@@ i@@ bility level as a wire model . you can specify this value relative to the level of visibility of the higher @-@ level object , or as absolute value . &quot;
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; has a window arrangement as default . the object tree and the view of the object properties are displayed on the left and the four graphical views on the right .
&quot; if you do not like the standard window arrangement or if you need a different arrangement , you can set it as you like . you can also store multiple window orders and simply switch between different directions . &quot;
&quot; to anchor a window over or below a present view , drag the shar@@ pen@@ er to the top or bottom of a view . a rect@@ angle then shows the new position . &quot;
&quot; to create a new column , drag the link to the right or left side of a view . the new view is then anch@@ ored at the right or left side of this view and extends over the entire height . &quot;
&quot; if you want to arrange multiple views over one another , drag the right to another view . you can then switch between the views by clicking on the map of cards to the top of the views . &quot;
&quot; the last possible window arrangement are floating views : views that are not anch@@ ored in the main window . in order to solve a view from the an@@ chor@@ age , drag the shar@@ pen@@ er to the desktop or click on the small arrow pointing left pointing arrow in the bev@@ elling bar . &quot;
&quot; to close a view , click on the small cross in the bev@@ elled bar . to prevent the closing , click on the small square between the arrow and the cross . &quot;
&quot; you can insert additional views in the main window . in the View menu , you will find entries for any kind of views . new views are floating , you can anchor it at any point . &quot;
the current window view can be saved with view window order . it will display a dialog where you can save the window arrangement under an existing or new name .
&quot; if you have created a scene , you can ren@@ ew them . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; used &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g for rendering , this program must be properly installed . as this manual was written , &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; 3.5 current . this version is not supported in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; version 1.0 is not supported . &quot;
&quot; to render the current scene click the Ren@@ dering symbol ren@@ ders symbol ren@@ ders in the tool@@ bar , or select the View menu entry . &quot;
&quot; a R@@ ender mode corresponds to entries in &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; s ini files . it determines the image size and quality of rendering . if you want to render a scene in different image sizes and quality levels , you can insert as many render modes , from a quick preview up to full images of the highest quality . &quot;
&quot; if you click on the icon The render settings in the tool@@ bar or select R@@ ender Mo@@ di ... , the following dialog will be opened : &quot;
&quot; each render mode has a name . you can type any name , but a name that lets you recognize the properties of the mode . &quot;
&quot; in the map @-@ map size you can insert the width and height of the rendered image . if you want to ren@@ ders only a small area of the image , select the section section and enter the image section for rendering into the input fields . &quot;
&quot; in combination field quality , you can select the properties that &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; used for rendering . this goes from a very simple color and light model to a model with complex diff@@ user reflections lighting . a detailed description of the R@@ ender features can be found in the User &apos;s Guide to &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; &quot;
&quot; if an image is rendered with only one beam per pixel , various errors can arise . these images often have a mo@@ ir@@ è patterns or steps in curves and lines , and sometimes details are not shown when they are smaller than a pixel . this effect is called ali@@ asing . &quot;
&quot; &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; uses a technique called anti @-@ ali@@ asing to reduce the impact of these errors . generally , pictures with this feature are better . &quot;
&quot; when you switch off anti @-@ ali@@ asing , comp@@ utes and connects &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; more than one beam per pixel . this technique is super @-@ sampling . &quot;
&quot; &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; supports two methods of super @-@ sampling . as a standard is an adap@@ tive , non @-@ recur@@ sive method ; adap@@ tive because the super @-@ sampling is the adjacent pixel . the second method is adap@@ tive @-@ recur@@ sive ; recur@@ sively because each pixel is repeatedly divided and adap@@ tive because the recur@@ sion depth depends on the calculated color values . &quot;
&quot; if you choose the first method , POV @-@ Ray tracks a beam of pixels . if the difference between the color values to the adjacent pixel exceeds the given threshold , then both pixels are calculated by tracking a certain additional number of pixels with super @-@ sampling . if you set the depth value to 4 , a grid of 4x4 is calculated additional points , with a depth value of 5 then 5x@@ 5 ( 25 ) additional rays each pixel . &quot;
&quot; the difference between two pixels is calculated as follows : R 1 , g 1 and b 1 are the values for red , green and blue of the first pixel , r 2 , g 2 and b 2 are the values for red , green and blue of the second pixel . the difference is then : &quot;
di@@ ff = abs ( r 1 -@@ r 2 ) + abs ( g 1 -@@ g 2 ) + abs ( b 1 -@@ b 2 )
&quot; the recur@@ sive method starts with 4 rays each pixel . if the difference between the color values exceeds the default threshold , then the pixel is divided into 4 sub @-@ pixels , which are individually monitored and checked for further sub@@ division . the maximum depth of the recur@@ sion can be set with the depth value . &quot;
&quot; another way to reduce ali@@ asing effect is the generation of noise for the beam process called J@@ it@@ tering . when you switch J@@ it@@ tering , change &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; the rays are a tiny amount to avoid regular patterns . &quot;
the last setting for quality of ren@@ der@@ ns is diff@@ use reflection . this is an experimental feature of &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; which comp@@ utes diff@@ use light reflection . it takes a long time to calculate a scene with this property .
&quot; on this map card , you can set whether the alpha channels are to be calculated by POV @-@ Ray . a pixel is then transparent , if the associated beams have no object . &quot;
&quot; opens a new window for the display of &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; -@@ console output . if &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; un@@ expect@@ edly termin@@ ated , you can find the reason for this . &quot;
to import a &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; select the Import menu entry ... and select a file in the dialog window .
&quot; currently , &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; not yet fully supported by &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; . if error messages or war@@ nings occur when import@@ ing error messages or war@@ nings , a dialog window displays a list of all messages . &quot;
&quot; if you do not want to support source code in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er , write this source code between the two special comments / / * PM@@ Ra@@ w@@ Beg@@ in and / / * PM@@ Ra@@ w@@ End . &quot;
&quot; you can drag objects from the object tree to the editor to export the source code for &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; this adds to the source code in the editor . to import objects into the scene , simply select the source code in the editor and drag it into the object tree . &quot;
with copy and paste in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; and in your editor you can insert sourc@@ ec@@ ode for &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; also .
the POV @-@ Ray command is called when &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; a scene ren@@ ders . usually this is po@@ v@@ ray or x @-@ po@@ v@@ ray .
&quot; click on Help in the Properties view , open &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; the &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; user documentation to the displayed object . put the path to your document and the version here . the versions 3.@@ 1@@ g and 3.5 are supported . &quot;
&quot; and Po@@ v@@ ray ; searches for external files ( for example high field data ) in the paths to the &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; libraries . if you include files that are not in the folder of the scene , you must also enter the path to these files here . if a file occurs in different paths of the library , the first found file is used . &quot;
the color for the wire models . the second color is used for displaying the selected objects .
the color for the control points . the second color is used for displaying the selected control points .
the color of the rect@@ angle for the viewing area in the camera view and in the window type mark@@ ings .
&quot; you can set the object reception of the points on the grid in the context menu of the wire model views . you can set the grid separately for shifts , sc@@ aling and turning . &quot;
&quot; larger values result in a more accurate wire model and therefore a better approxim@@ ation for the displayed objects , but require more time for rendering . for some objects such as the ball , you can set the detail level separately for two directions . &quot;
&quot; if you cross high detail fi@@ del@@ ity for advanced proj@@ ections , all wire model views are further sub@@ divided if the camera uses an extended projection . advanced proj@@ ections are all proj@@ ections with exceptions of perspective and vertical proj@@ ections . this feature gives a better approach to proj@@ ections , but requires more time for rendering . &quot;
&quot; if you cross the wall , a wall is rendered behind the objects . the wall is displayed in a chess board pattern consisting of two adjustable colours . &quot;
&quot; if you cross the floor , a bottom is rendered below the objects . the bottom is displayed in a chess board pattern consisting of two adjustable colours . &quot;
&quot; if you tap edge smooth@@ ness , the non @-@ recur@@ sive anti @-@ ali@@ asing method is used for rendering the scenes . you can set the values for depth and threshold value . more exact details of parameters can be found in the R@@ ender @-@ Mo@@ di section . &quot;
&quot; on this page , you can change existing window orders or create new window orders . in the window orders section explains how to create and store window orders . &quot;
the combination field standard window arrangement : displays all existing window arrangements . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; uses the selected window arrangement when starting the program .
the list of existing window orders shows all existing window orders . a new arrangement allows you to create with the button add and delete a selected arrangement with the button Rem@@ ove .
each window arrangement is identified by the name . the name must be unique and must not be empty .
the list below shows all the views for the selected window arrangement . new views can be created with the button add and delete selected views with the button Rem@@ ove .
&quot; with new column , create a new column on the right side of the existing window , with Un@@ ten anchor the window under the existing window , with window card you get a map map view together with the previous view and floating the view not in the main window , but creates a separate window . &quot;
&quot; so you have just installed &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; and &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; installed and now you want to start without further knowledge of both programs . if you follow all steps in this guide , you should make the ultimate but simple scene , among beginners very popular : a sphere on one level . &quot;
&quot; but you should carefully consider the following war@@ nings before you compl@@ ain that as a result you only receive a black screen . if you use a 3D program for the first time , you should observe these important rules : &quot;
&quot; if you do not set a camera , no rules can be applied to rendering , as a result you get a black image . &quot;
&quot; if you do not insert any light sources , your whole scene is in the dark and you get only a black image . &quot;
&quot; if you have installed everything correctly , you will see at the first start of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; the following pre @-@ set window arrangement : &quot;
&quot; take a little time to get to know the menus and the existing symbols of the tool@@ bar . please read the documentation , so that you can get an appropriate idea of what you can expect from this program . &quot;
&quot; you will need to use these menus and symbols often , so you should remember the menus and symbols and their application . &quot;
&quot; to follow this guide , you must first remove all objects from the object tree . select the scene and then select the Edit Del@@ ete menu item . you now have a scene without objects . &quot;
this is the view of the scene from the view of the camera . this shows you the result of the rendering of the scene .
&quot; the object tree now contains a new entry with the designation camera . if you click on it , see the contents of the View Properties in which the different parameters of the camera can be found . in the user documentation on &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; see more details . &quot;
&quot; do not change the basic settings of the camera , this is reserved for later instructions , but note that the camera in view has control points with which you can change the target point of the camera . simply click on a control point with the left mouse button and drag it to the desired location . &quot;
&quot; when you press the button App@@ ly or En@@ ter , the wi@@ re@@ model views and the object tree immediately change according to these settings . as a result , they see the scene from the camera &apos;s point of view . &quot;
&quot; there are many ways to create the floor for the scene . for example , you could insert a source ( insert final body qu@@ ader ) and size to x = 100 , y = 0 and z = 100 , but this is an in@@ comprehen@@ sible way to resolve this task . &quot;
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; actually offers a simpler way . you can use an infinite plane as floor :
&quot; a good advice : select the layer in the object tree , change the name and then press the button App@@ ly or En@@ ter . in the object tree the new name will be displayed immediately . &quot;
&quot; the wi@@ re@@ model view now shows the plane , if at the moment only as a limited fin@@ ite plane . if you render the scene , the plane extends to the horizon . &quot;
&quot; in this case , you will find the different parameters of the object . in this case you will find only the default options for each new object : sc@@ aling , rotation and shift . choose one of these options , also change the possible settings in the object &apos;s view . &quot;
&quot; in this scene , you should move the floor to exercise a unit under the horizontal line , just to get to know some of these parameters . select Shift and set the values as follows : &quot;
&quot; first select the floor to adjust its material properties . there are many different materials , but choose something simple at the moment . &quot;
&quot; in both cases , a dialog box opens in which you can choose how the object should be inserted . the pig@@ ment is then displayed in the object tree . you can see the name in the property view ( name = bottom @-@ pig@@ ment ) , with a click on the button preview see how the pig@@ ment looks now . &quot;
&quot; of course , the preview of the pig@@ ment shows only a matt black material because you have to add settings for the pig@@ ment . please always remember that you can check the appearance of materials at any time with a click on preview . &quot;
&quot; if you don &apos;t see any color on a fa@@ der and ball in the preview , just click the App@@ ly button and then preview the preview . &quot;
&quot; the material for the floor is now set correctly . if you render your image now with a click on the icon , you should get the following result : &quot;
&quot; in the color list you need to enter two new attributes , called Uni@@ coloured . in the color list you need to enter two new attributes , called Uni@@ coloured . then edit this entry twice ( you can do this more often , but the chess board color list can only be used with two colors ) : &quot;
select in the object tree each time and change the colors in the view of the object properties :
&quot; you should already be able to perform this step , as you should have understood the basic mode of working of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; already understood . the ball is just as easy to create as the floor : &quot;
&quot; in the view of the object properties , you can change the settings immediately . set the value for the radius : to 1 ( don &apos;t forget to press En@@ ter or the button App@@ ly ) , so the ball has contact with the bottom . otherwise , the ball would float above the floor as you moved the floor around one unit down@@ wards . &quot;
&quot; of course , rendering now a strange result : as you can see before , the ball surface appears like a matt black material . in the following step , place a suitable material . &quot;
&quot; if you have selected the ball , you can now assign a material to it . as already at the bottom , give the ball a pig@@ ment as color : &quot;
&quot; first sub @-@ object and change the name for example in ball pig@@ ment . click on ball pig@@ ment , then choose Uni@@ coloured and set the values as follows : &quot;
&quot; but you can achieve more interesting effects , if you take the time to adjust some finish features : &quot;
then change the values as in the following screen@@ shots and click App@@ ly or press En@@ ter .
&quot; the brightness effect and reflection already result in some good visual effects , perfect for glass or chro@@ mium @-@ plated surfaces even when metallic : not yet selected : &quot;
&quot; you should now have a good impression of what possibilities you do and k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; hopefully you have learned so much that you can easily create , but beautiful scenes . &quot;
Ray@@ tra@@ y@@ cing is a rendering method to create a two @-@ dimensional picture of a three @-@ dimensional scene or a model .
&quot; if you ra@@ y@@ trac@@ er a scene , the ren@@ derer sho@@ ots hyp@@ othe@@ tical rays from the viewer &apos;s perspective ( i.e. from the camera that ren@@ ders the scenes ) through each pixel in the scene . &quot;
&quot; as you can imagine , you won &apos;t see anything without a camera , the camera is your eye with which you see the scene . without a light source you also don &apos;t see anything , the picture is simply black . obviously , any scene that should be rendered , some light sources and at least one camera . &quot;
&quot; in the usual file dialog , you can select your file . Po@@ v@@ ray files usually have the file extension * .@@ po@@ v or * .@@ inc . &quot;
opens a file . in the default file dialog you can select a file that you have previously created with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ;
&quot; whenever you open or create a new model , the file will be inserted into this sub @-@ menu and replaces the oldest entry in the list . &quot;
&quot; if you have already saved the model , it is stored under the same name . if it is a new file , you must enter a name and a storage space . &quot;
reco@@ vers the scene in the last saved version . all changes since the last storage are disc@@ ar@@ ded .
you can only select this menu item if you have not yet saved any saved changes in the scene .
repeat the last reverse order . this menu item can only be selected if you have used editing back@@ ups .
save the current window arrangement and opens a dialog where you can enter a name for a new arrangement or over@@ write an existing order .
&quot; in this menu you will find options for setting up &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; here you can change the look , the short@@ cut and the default behavior . &quot;
opens a dialog to change the keyboard short@@ cut . you can use this option pre @-@ set short commands for &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; change commands or add new ones .
opens a dialog to set up the tool@@ bars . you can add and remove tool symbols for &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; add and remove commands .
&quot; a b@@ ump @-@ map is a way to pre@@ dict rugged surfaces , without having to model any be@@ ehi@@ ves on the surface separately and without changing the geomet@@ rical shape of the object itself . &quot;
it is custom@@ ary to use the same file for a b@@ ump map as well as for a texture map .
&quot; basic bodies are simple geometric shapes that you can use as building blocks : very complex 3D models are made of dozens or even hundreds of these bas@@ ins . these models are then processed further , in order to give them a more realistic look . &quot;
texture Map is a way to give the surface of an object color to pixel basis by using an image file as a color chart .
&amp; sk@@ ill@@ Show ; is a comfortable image viewer and browser . the application has a files@@ ystem that allows you to select images for viewing .
images can be displayed either in a separate window in the size of the image or in full screen mode .
the use of &amp; sk@@ ill@@ show ; is very simple . the file browser lists files that you can view by clicking the &amp; L@@ MB@@ s ; or the Return button .
&quot; you can set if each image is to be displayed in a separate window , or if all images should always use the same window . &quot;
&quot; if you are looking for a specific file , type the first character of the filename in the browser window . then a small input field appears in the right lower corner . if a matching file name is found , the file will be highlighted . you can leave the input field by pressing Return or &amp; Es@@ c . &quot;
&quot; in the dialogue setup - &amp; sk@@ ill@@ show ; there are five cards . in three of it , General and editing and slide show , you can set the working method of &amp; sk@@ ill@@ show ; in the two other , short commands for the display window and short commands for the browser , the short@@ cut keys for the respective windows can be specified . &quot;
&quot; if the image is not large enough to fill the screen , the rest of the display area is filled with the background color , which can be set further down . default is not full@@ screen mode . &quot;
&quot; this point is activated , loads &amp; sk@@ ill@@ show ; already the next image in the folder while you still view the current image . this reduces the delay when you choose the next image , and is especially suitable for a slide show . &quot;
with this option stores &amp; sk@@ ill@@ show ; when you exit the name of the recently opened folder . next start opens &amp; sk@@ ill@@ Show ; this folder in the browser window .
&quot; click on the colored beams to select a background color . this is used in order to fill the background of the screen in full screen mode . if in window mode the window is bigger than the image , the background is filled with the selected color . &quot;
&quot; you can have &amp; sk@@ ill@@ show ; set up , that only some of the file types can be displayed , which can also display the program . &quot;
&quot; with this option , the display window will be enlarged to the full screen for large images . this option is turned on as default . &quot;
specify whether the slideshow should start with the first image in the folder or with the selected image .
&quot; to change the value , you can enter a new value in the input field or use the slider or the small arrows to the right next to the input field . the default is 3 seconds . &quot;
&quot; if this value is set to 0 , the slide show will be repeated until it is broken by the user . to change the value , you can enter a new value in the input field or use the slider or the small arrows to the right next to the input field . the default is 1 . &quot;
change the keyboard short@@ cut for the different modes of operation of &amp; sk@@ ill@@ show ; in the map cards short commands for the display window and short commands for the browser .
&quot; with this option , switch between the two @-@ part view of the files@@ ystem ( a window for the sub@@ folder and a window for the files ) and the one @-@ part view of the file system with folders and files in a window . &quot;
displays large icons for the files in the folder . this display is only possible in the short presentation .
displays small icons for the files in the folder . this display is only possible in the short presentation .
displays preview images for the files in the folder . this display is only possible in the short presentation .
the image decreases by 10 % . the factor refers to the current size of the image .
increases the image by 10 % . the factor refers to the current size of the image .
closes the display window for the images . &amp; sk@@ ill@@ Show ; is also closed when no browser window is opened .
view the image in original size . this is only useful if automatic sc@@ aling is enabled .
&quot; opens the input field for completion . enter the first characters of the filename you are looking for . if the file is found , it is selected . &quot;
&amp; show@@ foto ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; photo editing based on the &amp; digi@@ k ; image editing . &amp; show@@ foto ; is part of the &amp; digi@@ came ; project .

&quot; the best start to participate in &amp; show@@ foto ; to participate , it is the developer mailing list to join . instructions to join the developer mailing list from &amp; show@@ foto ; . &quot;
&quot; the Settings dialog is divided into eight pages . you can switch between them by clicking on the icons of the left side . &quot;
&quot; in the exposure indicators range , you can select the color that is displayed when the sub@@ - or over@@ exposure indicator is selected . dex@@ ter@@ ity should display the colors with what you want to display in contrast . under@@ exposure should display a light color and over@@ exposure to a dark color . &quot;
the main window of &amp; show@@ foto ; has a page bar at the right edge which provides you with important information and actions to the selected images . you can also view it in the image processing . you can view it in which you click on one of the five tab@@ s :
&amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; is an application for scanning images that no longer makes images to scan and save images .
&amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; is a simple application to scan images that no longer makes images to scan and save images . &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; can open a dialog for each image or store the images in a specified folder with automatically generated names and format .
you can check the status of your scanner &apos;s support on the SAN@@ E project page by entering the necessary information on this search page : http : / / www.s@@ ane @-@ proj@@ ect@@ .org / c@@ gi @-@ bin / dri@@ ver@@ .pl .
&quot; a standard scanner can be set on the command line of &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite , with the command sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite -@@ d &#91; device name &#93; in the terminal . if this scanner cannot be opened or if no standard scanner is specified , then a dialog for selecting the scanner will be opened . &quot;
the user can select the scanner to use and press OK to open the scanner . cancel &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; exit .
the other settings contain more detailed options of the driver . &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; ( lib@@ ks@@ ane ) does not treat these options .
&quot; to add a picture , the user can start a preview scanning and then look for scanning area for the final scan . the preview button will be started by the preview button . &quot;
&quot; to select the image better , the user can zoom into the picture and zoom out of the current selection . he can also adjust the zoom in such a way that the complete preview will fit into the window . &quot;
if the image is selected then the final image can be read with the scan button .
&quot; when saving a preview in the settings selected , then the image will appear in a preview window , as shown below . when saving is pressed , then the image will be saved and s@@ lie ? en leads to a demo@@ li@@ tion and you will get back to the main window . &quot;
&quot; by the Settings button , the same name dialog will be opened in front of the main window . you can change the most important settings here . &quot;
&quot; the user can view the image if desired , before saving . in this case the option must be selected before saving a preview . if this preview is not desired by the user , then the option must be picked up . &quot;
&quot; this setting allows them to select the type as &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; images save . dialog to save for each image open the dialog in front of any sc@@ anned image . if &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; to automatically save them with a generated name in a previously defined folder , then you need to choose save without asking for a filename . &quot;
&quot; this setting defines where the images are stored in the Save without asking for a file name . if the images are saved after each scan , then this folder is used as default for the dialog to save . the default value is your home directory and you can change it with the button ... &quot;
&quot; this parameter defines an image pre@@ fix for the images automatically to save images and is additionally the proposed name for the image in the dialog to save . the automatically saved image gets a numer@@ ical suff@@ ix , which is saved each time a picture is saved . the string # # # is replaced by the numbers . &quot;
&quot; the user can adjust the image quality used to save . this value also changes the compression value when saving . if choosing the image quality is not selected , then the default value of Q@@ t is used . &quot;
button Help starts the K@@ DE Help with the &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; manual . the button About starts the K@@ DE About -@@ Dialog box for &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; . the button Settings shows the dialog for the settings and closing can be used to finish &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; .

&quot; &amp; Amar@@ ok ; you can set up a list of these abbrevi@@ ations and their function . below , you can set up a list of these abbrevi@@ ations and their function . &quot;
&quot; you may set up existing multimedia buttons to work as &amp; Amar@@ ok ; -@@ Short@@ cuts work , thereby making your keyboard to &amp; Amar@@ ok ; control center . &quot;
&quot; the D@@ CO@@ P interface of Amar@@ ok has many common functions , mostly in other K@@ DE programs . this section consists of six parts and is intended to describe the D@@ CO@@ P functions of collection , context browser , player , playlist , play@@ lists browser and scripts . &quot;
Amar@@ ok supports the command line options of Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de ; additionally Amar@@ ok has some own command line options .
&quot; you should give the user a feedback if the script cannot be executed because of a lack of dependen@@ cy . please check in your script , if all required modules are present and use k@@ dialog so that the user knows why a script does not run . &quot;
begin require &apos; Kor@@ und@@ um &apos; rescue Lo@@ ad@@ Error error = &apos; Kor@@ und@@ um ( K@@ DE bin@@ dings for ruby ) from k@@ de@@ bin@@ dings V@@ 3.4 is required for this script . &apos; &apos; k@@ dialog --@@ sorry &apos; # { error } &apos; &apos; exit end
&quot; in the scripts / templates folder , you will find a lot of template scripts in many different languages . you can use them as base for your own scripts or simply extend it to the required functions . you will quickly find that writing scripts is relatively simple . &quot;
&quot; with the help of D@@ CO@@ P , you can exchange your scripts with Amar@@ ok and control Amar@@ ok . the simpl@@ est way is to use the d@@ co@@ p command ; each K@@ DE installation should be included . &quot;
&quot; most scrip@@ ting languages enable execution of external programs and commands . in this way , d@@ co@@ p &gt; can be called relatively easily . here is an example in Python : &quot;
&quot; &amp; Amar@@ ok ; sends noti@@ fications to all running scripts . therefore , strings are written to the default input of the script . for this reason , scripts should constantly monitor their default input and respond accordingly to events . of course , a script may ignore the events if there is no use . &quot;
&quot; configure Wei@@ st the script to display the setup dialog . to save and load the setup data , each script must take care of itself . if a script is started , Amar@@ ok sets the folder to the folder where all data should be stored . &quot;
track@@ Change has sign@@ aled that a new piece is played . the script could now &amp; z@@ b ; use D@@ CO@@ P functions for further information on the new piece ( for example the metadata or the piece length ) .
volume Change new@@ Volume signals a change of volume . the new volume is an integer value between 0 and 100 .
custom@@ Menu@@ Cli@@ cked : sub@@ menu it@@ em@@ Title paths Con@@ tains the path to the selected playlist files when a user @-@ defined menu entry is cli@@ cked . sub@@ menu and it@@ em@@ Title are also given to enable the script to remove the cli@@ cked entry . to remove an entry you can use d@@ co@@ p Amar@@ ok script remo@@ ve@@ Custom@@ ize Item ( sub@@ menu it@@ em@@ Title ) .
&quot; before &amp; Amar@@ ok ; end , or when the user stops a script , send &amp; Amar@@ ok ; the signal SIG@@ TER@@ M is sent to the script . this signal should be processed , e.g. storing data or configuration settings . &quot;
&quot; Amar@@ o@@ ks script management can also install script packages which the user &amp; z@@ b has downloaded from a web server . such packages are basically normal T@@ ar archives ( .t@@ ar ) , which can optionally also be compressed with b@@ zip@@ 2 ( .@@ bz@@ 2 ) , so that the user can clearly see the archive as a Amar@@ ok script package . &quot;
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; 1.3 will only accept script packages with the expan@@ sion@@ ing amar@@ ok@@ script . for this reason you should name your script packages immediately .
&quot; the main script must be exec@@ utable ( + x ) , the remaining modules should not be exec@@ utable . use the T@@ ar parameter -@@ p to get the file rights : &quot;
&quot; if your script package is ready , you can mount it on www.k@@ de @-@ app@@ s.org and attach the link to the Wik@@ i script page of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; for your entry on k@@ de @-@ apps you should use the category Amar@@ ok ; scripts use . &quot;
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is an audio player for &amp; k@@ de ; . &amp; Amar@@ ok ; has many useful and powerful features and is nevertheless surprisingly easy to use .
&quot; with &amp; Amar@@ ok , you can simply drag music into the playlist instead of having to work through endless menus . maybe you &apos;re looking for just a certain title of thousands in your collection . with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; &apos;s collection browser and quick search you will find the piece within seconds . &quot;
&quot; if you already have some play@@ lists , you can never decide which you want to hear ? then the play@@ lists browser is exactly the right thing for you . and if the decision is still difficult , the dynamic mode and smart play@@ lists will automatically select the right music according to certain criteria . &quot;
&quot; Amar@@ ok has excellent support for Apple &apos;s iPod , i@@ Ri@@ vers if@@ p and many generic USB devices . &quot;
&quot; usually , you have to enter the following folder in the root folder of Amar@@ ok sources to compile and install Amar@@ ok : &quot;
&quot; since &amp; Amar@@ ok ; auto@@ conf and autom@@ ake uses , you should have no difficulties with compile . if you encounter any problems , please report them to the &amp; k@@ de ; mailing lists . &quot;
&quot; &amp; Amar@@ ok , like most applications , has some options that can be activated or de@@ activated for compile time using the configure script . this is a list of available options . &quot;
&quot; for some of the compilation options , certain dependen@@ cies need to be met so that they can be used . for details , see the system requirements section . &quot;
&quot; enabled de@@ bug@@ ging symbols . you have the choice between yes , no and full . if you want to help in the development of &amp; Amar@@ ok , you should use full . &quot;
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; can be set up without any effort using the setup dialog . the furnis@@ hing dialog has several cards to set up the various functions of &amp; Amar@@ ok .
&quot; player window displays the player window in addition to the playlist , or if the option is disabled , only the playlist window will be displayed . &quot;
use tun@@ er bar@@ ometer : this function is only available if &amp; Amar@@ ok ; compiled with support for m@@ ood@@ cash . the option switches the experimental function of the m@@ ood@@ le.@@ The option switches off .
design : this function is only available if &amp; Amar@@ ok ; compiled with support for m@@ ood@@ cash . this will change the used color scheme for the tuning bar@@ ometer .
&quot; put mood files at the music files : this function is only available if &amp; Amar@@ ok ; compiled with support for m@@ ood@@ bar . if this setting is enabled , .@@ mood files are stored at the location of the corresponding music files . otherwise , the .@@ mood files are stored in the settings folder of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; stored ( normally ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Amar@@ ok / m@@ ood@@ bar / ) . &quot;
external browser : lets you choose which browser of &amp; Amar@@ ok should be started when a browser is needed .
&quot; other browsers use : here you can specify the path to another browser , which is not in the list above . &quot;
&quot; save playlist to save , save the current playlist automatically when you exit &amp; Amar@@ ok . enable this option if you don &apos;t want to lose the current playlist at the end . &quot;
&quot; relative paths for manually saved playlist : when you activate this setting , &amp; Amar@@ ok ; relative paths to the music files , starting from the location of the playlist , use . otherwise , the absolute position of music files will be saved . &quot;
keep up @-@ to @-@ date pieces visible when changing the piece that the play@@ lists windows open / off to keep the running piece always visible in the visible window area .
&quot; when changing the context browser , automatically changes the context browser as soon as the next piece is played . &quot;
&quot; in the App@@ ear@@ ance section , you can customize &amp; Amar@@ ok ; the section is divided into three parts . &quot;
&quot; in the fon@@ ts section , you can set the use of different fon@@ ts in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; use the otherwise gray shown section . you can select fon@@ ts for the following area : play@@ lists windows , player windows and context browsers . press Select ... , so you can choose a desired font from the selection dialog . &quot;
&quot; with the selection of Custom @-@ defined color scheme , you yourself have the source of choice and can set your own color scheme . use the color sel@@ ector activated for foreg@@ round and background color . &quot;
&quot; playback will continue on the start , that &amp; Amar@@ ok ; after program start , playback will automatically continue with the piece at the place with which it was stopped at the last ending . &quot;
&quot; the On @-@ Screen @-@ Display sub@@ window allows you to switch the O@@ SD . if on @-@ screen display is checked , a preview of the O@@ SD is displayed and you can view the effect of all settings in this preview directly . &quot;
&quot; the first option is font . click Select ... to select the font for the O@@ SD from the dialog box , which causes the text to be shad@@ ed in the O@@ SD . &quot;
&quot; using your own colors gives you the opportunity to adjust the O@@ SD colors for let@@ tering and background . clicking on the color surface opens the dialog for color selection . when sel@@ e colors do not use , the pres@@ et &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ colors are used . &quot;
&quot; the Display text input field displays the text displayed in the O@@ SD . by typ@@ ing plac@@ eholders , the O@@ SD can be adapted to your needs . below is a list of available plac@@ eholders and what they mean . &quot;
&quot; the screen is intended for X@@ iner@@ ama users , so you can specify which screen of a multi @-@ screen environment the O@@ SD should appear . &quot;
the card @-@ card audio output lets you select an audio driver from the drop @-@ down box . some drivers still activate more adjustments in this map .
the Map Card Collection is used to set up all the settings for your collection . this includes the folder and type of database for the collection .
&quot; here you can select the folder , select the &amp; Amar@@ ok and search for music files . to include a folder in the collection , mark the check box next to its name . this section also contains check boxes for setting up how to proceed with the selected folders . &quot;
search sub@@ folders recur@@ sively : this causes &amp; Amar@@ ok ; both the crossed and their sub@@ folders search for music .
&quot; monitoring changes : enables &amp; Amar@@ ok ; to monitor the selected folders on changes ( e.g. if music files are added or deleted ) . in addition , an incre@@ mental search is carried out to make the necessary changes to your collection . &quot;
&quot; import play@@ lists : causes &amp; Amar@@ ok , all found play@@ lists in your collections folder ( .@@ pl@@ - and .@@ m@@ 3@@ u files ) to your collection . the automatically added play@@ lists will appear later in the play@@ lists browser . &quot;
&quot; the part collection database is used to select a database for the collection . the drop down box driver : lets you choose between S@@ q@@ l@@ ite or My@@ S@@ q@@ l . if My@@ S@@ q@@ l is selected , another device is required in the sub @-@ window My@@ S@@ q@@ l setup . &quot;
&quot; the My@@ S@@ q@@ l setup section is used to insert the database for &amp; Amar@@ ok ; it is used on calcul@@ ator , where the My@@ S@@ q@@ l database is located . then , under port : the network port is entered , under which the database is accessible . name : is the database name , to which the connection is established . &quot;
use username : and password : to enter the data required for connection to the database .
the way@@ .@@ fm supports the support for last@@ .@@ fm . &amp; Amar@@ ok ; can provide the names of played pieces to a last@@ .@@ fm server and create music recommendations on the current unit if necessary .
&quot; here , enter your username and password for your Last@@ .@@ fm profile . if you do not have a profile , you can register one on the last@@ .@@ fm website . &quot;
send broken pieces and thus update the profile : this setting allows it &amp; Amar@@ ok ; to transmit the names of the played pieces to your last@@ .@@ fm profile .
&quot; you can view the list in the context browser . note : you do not need a last@@ .@@ fm profile , to use this feature . &quot;
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is an audio player for Unix systems ( like &amp; z@@ b ; Linux ) . further information can be found in the summary of the functions and the gallery with screen shots .
&quot; Amar@@ ok only needs the package k@@ deli@@ bs and otherwise no other K@@ DE packages . you have to have k@@ deli@@ bs installed ( including the included programs , because &amp; Amar@@ ok ; requires some of them to compile modules or scripts ) . &quot;
&quot; some functions , such as the O@@ SD , pres@@ upp@@ ose that your window manager will work out the relevant standards of fre@@ ed@@ es@@ kt@@ op@@ .org . Gn@@ ome will work for example . we try to support Amar@@ ok on all platforms , so we use k@@ deli@@ bs and Q@@ t because these provide an excellent development environment . &quot;
probably one of your files will make a mistake in the Tag@@ lib library for days . you can locate the file by clicking in ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Amar@@ ok / collection _ scan@@ .@@ log .
&quot; most of the time , this is because Tag@@ lib crashes with reading the met@@ a @-@ information from this file . please report this error to the Tag@@ lib developers under bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org . &quot;
if you use MySQL as a database then try SQ@@ Lite . support for this in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; is somewhat more mature .
&quot; make sure that all of &amp; Amar@@ ok libraries have been compiled with the same comp@@ iler version . if e.g. &amp; Amar@@ ok ; with G@@ CC 3.4 , Tag@@ lib was compiled with G@@ CC 3.@@ 3.@@ X , then this leads to crashes when editing met@@ a @-@ information . &quot;
&quot; if you use K@@ DE with art@@ s@@ d , then disable autom@@ . turn off automatically when in@@ active for ... in setting the sound system , or at least do not use a value of 1 second . &quot;
&quot; you can also send us the back@@ trace via e @-@ mail ( the e @-@ mail automatically opens at a crash ) . if it is a frequent crash and send us a good back@@ trace , the error will be corrected . &quot;
&quot; this is because many programs write data as UT@@ F @-@ 8 in met@@ a @-@ info , but don &apos;t mark them as Uni@@ code . the following Perl script resol@@ ves the problem . &quot;
# ! / usr / bin / per@@ l die &quot; The file $ AR@@ GV &#91; 0 &#93; does not exist unless -@@ f $ AR@@ GV &#91; 0 &#93; ; use MP3 : : M@@ p@@ lib ; my $ mp3 = MP3 : : M@@ p@@ lib@@ - &gt; new ( $ AR@@ GV &#91; 0 &#93; ) ; my $ v@@ 2@@ tag = $ mp@@ 3- &gt; set _ v@@ 2@@ tag ( $ v@@ 2@@ tag , amp ; UT@@ F@@ 8 ) ; &quot;
this script requires the Perl module MP3 : : M@@ p@@ lib . it can be re@@ installed using this command : Perl -@@ M@@ CP@@ AN -@@ e &apos;@@ install MP3 : : M@@ p@@ lib &apos;
&quot; &amp; Amar@@ ok ; s symbols in the status bar ( Rand@@ y mode / repeat / Dynamic Play@@ list ) see in K@@ DE 3.@@ 4.0 . this is a well @-@ known bug in K@@ DE 3.@@ 4.0 . sometimes , the symbol effects are simply forgotten . &quot;
if you get this error : amar@@ ok@@ app : icon look@@ up error : amar@@ ok@@ app : un@@ defined symbol : _ Z@@ N@@ 11@@ K@@ System@@ Tra@@ y@@ 9@@ set@@ Pix@@ map@@ ER@@ K@@ 7@@ Q@@ Pix@@ map then check if Amar@@ ok uses the correct Q@@ t library . this can be seen with ld@@ d &apos; which amar@@ ok@@ app &apos; _ BAR _ gre@@ p q@@ t .
&quot; to fix this error , you may need to remove any col@@ li@@ ding Q@@ t version or / etc / ld@@ .@@ so@@ .@@ conf so that Amar@@ ok will find the correct version first . &quot;
there are some possibilities . most installation problems are easiest by the help of an expert your Unix or Linux distribution . you can also seek help with other users or with developers . use the forum and IR@@ C under ir@@ c.@@ fre@@ en@@ o@@ de@@ .net in channel # Amar@@ ok .
&quot; bug@@ z@@ illa is not suitable for help . please enter there only one mistake , if there is something to fix an error in Amar@@ ok itself . &quot;
&quot; after the start of &amp; Amar@@ ok , only an empty playlist will appear . how do music pieces come in there ? &quot;
this is simple . use the files@@ ystem on the left and open the desired folder . then drag the files to the right part of the playlist .
&quot; to keep the surface intuitive , the Start sub@@ window was converted into the statistic window . you can find it under Extras Statistics . &quot;
&quot; the meaning of these symbols has changed with Amar@@ ok 1.4 Fast For@@ ward : stars stand for evaluation by the user , while the points are automatically calculated . &quot;
&quot; to evaluate pieces , the review column must be displayed in the playlist . click on the playlist of the playlist and select column . click anywhere in the new App@@ endi@@ x column to specify the evaluation for a piece . this also works if Amar@@ ok is in the background . &quot;
&quot; select the files you want to remove , and then press release on your keyboard . or click with the right mouse button on your selection and then select From playlist remove from the drop @-@ down menu . &quot;
&quot; drag a playlist file to the playlist and drop it there , just as you would like to do it with other files . so simple is : - ) &quot;
&quot; in the tool@@ bar of the playlist , right next to the addition button , you can save the button playlist . click on it . &quot;
&quot; probably missing the program x@@ mm@@ s @-@ config . install the x@@ mm@@ s @-@ de@@ vel package and install &amp; Amar@@ ok ; new . have a look at lib@@ visual , this package contains many very nice visu@@ aliz@@ ations . &quot;
the equ@@ ali@@ zer is located in the context menu ( via the right mouse button ) . you can also find it via the menu bar under Tools E@@ quali@@ zer ....
&quot; yes , that &apos;s true ! no ! &amp; Amar@@ ok ; use one of the back@@ end independent approach , so the actual question must support G@@ Stre@@ amer / x@@ ine / Arts / N@@ MM / MAS / K@@ DE@@ mm ? . as you can see , we support pretty much every imagin@@ able audio format . G@@ Stre@@ amer can even de@@ code text and PNG ! &quot;
&quot; it can ! possibly use Fed@@ ora / Red Hat Linux , with which no MP3 decoder are provided in the default setting ( for pat@@ ent@@ legal reasons ) . the solution : Alt @-@ F2 , gg : Red@@ Hat mp3 k@@ de , input key &quot;
start the Ya@@ ST Online Update and install the &apos; Multimedia Option Pack 1 &apos; . well ... &amp; Amar@@ ok ; plays MP3 &apos;s ab : - )
&quot; when you use the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver with the Al@@ sa sink , the device has to provide a bl@@ ender . a mixer allows several applications to use the device at the same time and simultaneously output audio . this can be achieved by a sound@@ card with hardware mix@@ ers ( e.g. SB@@ Live ) or through the d@@ mix module for al@@ sa ( software mixer ) . &quot;
&quot; the output of this command should help you in finding the problem cause and a solution . for G@@ Stre@@ amer , you may need to specify a different sink ( e.g. os@@ s@@ sink ) . &quot;
&quot; G@@ Stre@@ amer is the best choice for most people if you &apos;re looking for a decoder with little overhead . G@@ Stre@@ amer reads the file , de@@ codes them and sends the PC@@ M data to AL@@ SA . just like X@@ M@@ MS . &quot;
X@@ M@@ MS also de@@ codes the data first . G@@ Stre@@ amer can output directly to AL@@ SA as well as x@@ ine .
&quot; use the G@@ Stre@@ amer drivers ( really great ! ) or optimize the settings of Arts . open Control Centre Sound &amp; Multimedia Sound System . enable Sound@@ server to run with highest possible priority ( real @-@ time priority ) and increase the size of sound buffer ( warning , see next point of the FAQ ! ) . make sure that art@@ sw@@ ra@@ pper su@@ id is set : &quot;
K@@ DE 3.@@ 2.@@ x there are problems with K@@ DE@@ multimedia co@@ dec@@ s that can cause disturbed playback . read this bug report . the magni@@ fying of the sound buffer in your AL@@ SA setup file .@@ as@@ o@@ und@@ rc can also help .
&quot; either you do not use the Arts Driver , but instead G@@ Stre@@ amer or x@@ ine , or install K@@ DE multimedia to get the quicker Arts co@@ dec@@ s ( li@@ bar@@ ts _ mp@@ eg@@ li@@ b.@@ so &amp; etc . ) . &quot;
&quot; use another driver ( the x@@ ine driver has been greatly optimized for analy@@ zer ) , or decrease the size of the art buffer in the control center and sound &amp; multimedia , sound system . the smaller the buffer , the less iner@@ tia react the visu@@ aliz@@ ations . yes , this is a mistake , please help us to fix it . &quot;
&quot; G@@ Stre@@ amer is installed , but if I want to switch to the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver , crashes , and Amar@@ ok . why ? &quot;
&quot; after installing G@@ Stre@@ amer , you must register all the components . run g@@ st register to register all G@@ Stre@@ amer components . &quot;
read the G@@ Stre@@ amer FAQ . if that doesn &apos;t help you can also ask IR@@ C channel # G@@ Stre@@ amer .
&quot; try this ( quit Amar@@ ok before ! ) : - Download ff@@ m@@ peg , compile and install it . then run g@@ st file register , once as a system administrator and once as your normal user . &quot;
please report this to bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de.@@ or@@ g. If you have a whole list of suggestions / wishes please send them best to our mailing list : Amar@@ ok @-@ de@@ vel @ list@@ s.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is an album of the British Mike Old@@ field . I really like it and find that the name sounds good . in addition the name contains the magic K ... : )
thanks to D@@ CO@@ P this is already possible . set an alarm in your calendar program and run with the alarm command : d@@ co@@ p Amar@@ ok player play
&quot; this command lets &amp; Amar@@ ok ; start playing . make sure that &amp; Amar@@ ok runs before you go to bed , then you will have arous@@ ed by the soft tones of the music that you have stopped prior to going to bed . &quot;
how to get up @-@ to @-@ date in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; current titles when you are on another computer ?
if a working SS@@ H environment is present you can proceed as follows . this command gives you the interpre@@ ter and title of running piece : ss@@ h -@@ i ~ / .@@ ss@@ h / id _ r@@ sa ih@@ re@@ IP d@@ co@@ p --@@ user your@@ name Amar@@ ok player now@@ Pl@@ aying
replace IP address with your IP address and your username with your username . this assumes that your identification is present in ~ / .@@ ss@@ h / id _ r@@ sa file .
&quot; the visu@@ aliz@@ ations can be separated from &amp; Amar@@ ok ; click on the keyboard and the current analy@@ zer will open in an independent , in size changeable window . &quot;
the combination of C@@ trl + right mouse button puts a piece in the click sequence in the queu@@ e . pressing the input button after a search in the playlist will play the first search result and reset the search .
&quot; OK , the player window and the playlist have tri@@ cky functions , but what about the symbol in the system section of the control bar ? &quot;
&quot; on the title of a browser , click on the title of a browser . in the context menu , you can select which browser to display . &quot;
&quot; my Personal folder $ HOME is located on a NFS drive . after the start of Amar@@ ok , the collection database cannot be created and on the console many error messages appear . &quot;
the internal SQ@@ Lite database of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; does not work with NFS . either you need to link ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Amar@@ ok to a local drive or use Amar@@ o@@ ks MySQL support .
&quot; for normal read@@ ings , switch to the wa@@ v folder , select a few pieces and drag them to the desired destination folder in a Kon@@ quer@@ or window . for automatic code , take files from folders mp3 or og@@ g instead . &quot;
&quot; Q@@ Str@@ ing@@ List values = query ( Q@@ String ( &quot; SE@@ LE@@ CT play@@ counter , cre@@ at@@ ed@@ ate , Per@@ cent@@ age F@@ ROM statistics &quot; &quot; W@@ HER@@ E ur@@ l = &apos; % 1 &apos; ; &quot; ) .@@ ar@@ g ( escap@@ e@@ String ( ur@@ l ) ) ) ; &quot;
&quot; basically , this fits the previous assessment with a dimin@@ ishing value , based on how often the piece was played . the more often the piece was played , the less influence has every single rating on the overall result . &quot;
&quot; you can select the evaluation for a piece by clicking on a column heading in the play@@ lists window . there you can change the evaluation of a piece as well as all other attributes , namely by clicking the right mouse button on the piece and edit : select an evaluation or edit F2 . you can also edit the evaluation in the dialog &apos;s metadata . &quot;
developers don &apos;t want you to pre@@ dict when you want to release a stable version of Amar@@ ok . this means : K@@ DE packages have a fixed date plan that is not compatible with the short @-@ term planned plan of Amar@@ ok .
this is a new feature in Amar@@ ok which some users can also find ner@@ vi@@ g . disable the option icon when playing back in the general settings .
the Analy@@ zer is part of the tool@@ bar . select Settings tool@@ bars ... and take the desired changes there .
&quot; download a design , or create your own . install it under Amar@@ ok ... App@@ ear@@ ance context @-@ browser design , click on New Design ... &quot;
&quot; the symbol was similar to the logo of War@@ p Graphics Inc . ( el@@ f@@ qu@@ est@@ .com ) too . to avoid difficulties , it was removed . &quot;
&quot; Kon@@ quer@@ or &apos;s navigation range allows you to monitor and control &amp; Amar@@ ok ; while browsing the Kon@@ quer@@ or , click Con@@ quer@@ or and press F@@ 9 to view the navigation area . then click the Settings button ( the top ) and select in the Add Amar@@ ok drop @-@ down menu . &quot;
audi@@ os@@ c@@ rob@@ bler is a free service to the information about which pieces are played on an independent server . the service is free and you only need a free username and password . audi@@ os@@ c@@ rob@@ bler is fully supported by &amp; Amar@@ ok ;
&quot; if you want to use AL@@ SA , please use the latest available version . old AL@@ SA versions have a lot of crashes and therefore a lot of bug reports . &quot;
probably &amp; Amar@@ ok ; compiled before you have installed x@@ ine or G@@ Stre@@ amer . therefore the . / configure routine did not compile these output modules . you need to configure and install Amar@@ ok .
now I &amp; Amar@@ ok ; new installed but the output modules still do not appear . and now ?
&quot; the same goes for x@@ ine , you have to install x@@ ine @-@ de@@ vel . after that , you need to re@@ compile and install x@@ ine @-@ de@@ vel . &quot;
I receive the error G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ CR@@ IT@@ I@@ CAL * * : factory for &apos; Ad@@ der &apos; has no type .. How can I fix it ?
&quot; your version of G@@ Stre@@ amer has been compiled with P@@ rel@@ inking , which is in@@ compatible with G@@ Stre@@ amer . you need to compile G@@ Stre@@ amer without a rel@@ inking . a tip by mer@@ lin @-@ t@@ c : use no L@@ DF@@ LA@@ GS if you compile Amar@@ ok . &quot;
&quot; I get the error there is no element present to handle the file &apos;s mim@@ et@@ ype audi@@ a / mp4 , although the module G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ fa@@ ad is installed . &quot;
&quot; to play mp4 or m@@ 4@@ a files with G@@ Stre@@ amer , the G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ quick@@ time module must also be installed next to G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ fa@@ ad . &quot;
you will receive the error There is no element present to handle the stream &apos;s mim@@ et@@ ype audio / m@@ peg .
&quot; you play a MP3 stream , but the module G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ mad is not installed . install the module and then run as a system administrator g@@ st register . then restart Amar@@ ok . &quot;
I have a second sound card and use AL@@ SA . how can Amar@@ ok use the second sound card ?
&quot; set up Amar@@ ok settings ... Audio output gives you the device . typically , h@@ w : 0 for the standard sound@@ card and h@@ w : 1 for the second . &quot;
here is an example for ~ / .@@ as@@ o@@ und@@ rc on a machine with a on@@ board AC@@ 97 co@@ dec and a USB audio device :
p@@ cm@@ .@@ intel@@ 8x@@ 0 { type plug sla@@ v@@ e.@@ p@@ cm &quot; h@@ w : 0 &quot; } ct@@ l.@@ intel@@ 8x@@ 0 { type h@@ w card 0 } p@@ cm@@ .@@ us@@ b @-@ audio { type h@@ w card 1 }
&quot; in the setup dialog by x@@ ine now insert us@@ b @-@ audio , and output is done on the USB sound card . so @-@ lib takes care of converting the sample rate , channels and so on . &quot;
&quot; if you want to use a virtual d@@ mix device , de@@ activate the tick on sound@@ card supports m@@ map . &quot;
&quot; sorry , but the audio issue with Arts will not be taken care of . of course you are allowed to take this problem yourself ! if you want , you can become the new so much @-@ needed super@@ visor for arts : ) &quot;
&quot; listen to music should be quite simple ! for this reason , there is the setup wiz@@ ard that will be shown at the first start of &amp; Amar@@ ok . if you want to upgrade your collection afterwards , or simply do not like the wiz@@ ard , then this quick start guide will help you . &quot;
&quot; to create a playlist is very simple . drag some entries from the collection browser to the playlist . typ@@ ing something into the text box , you can store them in the text box , so you can save them with the button in the playlist . you will find this button in the playlist &apos;s tool@@ bar . &quot;
&quot; if you have your own play@@ lists , you can add this playlist to the playlist . if the playlist is included in the folders of your collection , and you will have the option to import play@@ lists , then you will find various ways to load the playlist . &quot;
&quot; to play an audio CD , select the audio CD in the menu bar . it opens a file browser with multiple folders and CD pieces in WAV format . simply drag the WAV files to the playlist and then press the button playback . &quot;
the audio CD function uses the protocol Audi@@ oc@@ d : / and is not compatible with all available drivers .
the burning function is also available in the playlist . just click on an entry with the right mouse button and follow the burning menu . you have here several ways to burn a CD .
&quot; &amp; Amar@@ ok ; pres@@ upp@@ oses the installation of some software packages . the required packages are listed below . besides , some additional packages are listed that make working with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; more enjoyable . &quot;
&quot; if you install these packages via a package management system ( e.g. RPM or apt ) , you also need to install the development versions of these packages ! &quot;
&quot; &amp; Amar@@ ok ; is a versatile multimedia player . it offers many different ways to keep your music collection under control . like any normal multimedia player also has &amp; Amar@@ ok , a player window with the most important functions . &quot;
&quot; this chapter explains how all the functions of &amp; Amar@@ ok are used , including creating a collection and a playlist . &quot;
&quot; the player window is your one @-@ click &amp; Amar@@ ok ; control center . at the top of the window , there is a running text display showing the currently running piece or the current stream . a click on this area changes the display of the already ex@@ pi@@ red playing time to the remaining playing time of the piece . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the player window contains a selection of audio analy@@ sers , also under the running text display . you can switch from the available analy@@ zer by clicking the left mouse button . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; Amar@@ ok ; -@@ Analy@@ zer can be separated from the player window . press d on your keyboard and the current analy@@ zer is displayed in an independent , magni@@ fying window . &quot;
&quot; the PL and E@@ Q buttons are also displayed under the running text display . the PL activ@@ ates or de@@ activ@@ ates the play@@ lists window , while the kno@@ b E@@ Q is used for equ@@ alizing equ@@ ali@@ zers . &quot;
&quot; the rest of the player window consists of playback buttons , the volume control and the piece @-@ position slider . use the slider to adjust the piece position or volume . &quot;
&quot; the use of the built @-@ in equ@@ ali@@ zer is simple and works with all audio drivers . there are 17 pres@@ ets , from classical to tech@@ no , and you can easily create your own default settings . &quot;
&quot; to display the equ@@ ali@@ zer , use Extras E@@ quali@@ zer from the main menu or click the E@@ Q button in the player window . once you select the E@@ quali@@ zer button , the E@@ quali@@ zer is in operation . &quot;
&quot; the playlist of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; is the most widely developed playlist of all for &amp; k@@ de ; available multimedia player . it has many functions that do not exist in any other player . but let &apos;s not sc@@ are away from the abundance of functions , they are all easy to use . &quot;
&quot; the playlist window can be divided into two main areas , on the left side is the navigation area . in the navigation area , you will find some of the excellent functions of the playlist , such as the context browser . &quot;
&quot; the context browser displays various information regarding the running piece . its appearance can be adapted using context browser designs . the context browser contains three sub @-@ windows : music , text and interpre@@ t . these three sub@@ windows will be more anno@@ ying later . &quot;
&quot; if you have already used earlier versions of &amp; Amar@@ ok , you might be aware that the sub@@ window will start off . the information presented there is now distributed to other parts of &amp; Amar@@ ok . furthermore , the information in the statistics window can be viewed ( Extras Statistics ) . &quot;
&quot; the sub@@ window of music shows information about the currently running piece , as well as the interpre@@ ters and the album . &quot;
&quot; the first section in this sub@@ window shows information about the piece . in the title is the name of the piece , performer and the album . below you can see the cover picture of the album and next to it a Musi@@ c@@ Bra@@ in@@ z symbol . click on this icon to track the piece in the Musi@@ c@@ Bra@@ in@@ z database . &quot;
&quot; below the Musi@@ c@@ Bra@@ in@@ z icon you can find more information about the current item . you can see here , how often and when the piece was played for the first and last time as well as its evaluation . &quot;
&quot; the images can have arbitr@@ ary names , but images with the word front in the name are preferred . the context browser will also display cover images , which are either downloaded with the cover management or embedded in ID@@ 3@@ v2 tags . &quot;
&quot; the next area , recommended pieces , lists several recommended pieces . if you click on one of these pieces , it will be played immediately . &quot;
among the recommended pieces are the favorite pieces of this interpre@@ ter . this section shows the five highest rated pieces of the current interpre@@ ter .
you can set which information to display in the music window . right @-@ click anywhere in the sub@@ window and select from the context menu .
&quot; the last section , albums of the interpre@@ ter , lists all the albums of the current interpre@@ ter you have in your collection . if you click on an album , it will be folded up and you see the contents of the album . &quot;
you can click on all the pieces in the individual areas to start playing immediately . you can also click on it and then select one of the possibilities to add the piece or album to playlist .
&quot; in the text sub@@ window , the downloaded song text is displayed for the running piece . this function is very flexible and it is possible to download text files from other web pages . once you click on the text sub@@ window , try to download the text for the piece from the Internet . if no text script is running , you can choose which to be started . &quot;
&quot; the Edit button allows you to edit the lyrics . the modified version will then be stored in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; s collection database , no running text script is required . &quot;
the search button opens a search for google.com following the song text for the running piece ( in an external browser window ) .
&quot; group@@ ing interpre@@ ters - only group the top level , each piece is displayed directly below the interpre@@ ter . albums or gen@@ res are left aside . &quot;
&quot; group Interpre@@ t / Album - First the pieces will be sorted according to the artist , and this is the best view on your collection - these albums are displayed at the beginning of the list under Vari@@ ous Artists . &quot;
&quot; group@@ ing performer / year - Album - Sor@@ ates to interpre@@ ter and then after the year of the album in descending order ( the latest first ) . if the year is unknown for an album , the default 0 - album name is related . &quot;
group@@ ing Album - All albums of your collection are sorted alphabe@@ tically among each other . the interpre@@ ter will be ignored .
group@@ ing genre / interpre@@ t - your pieces will first be sorted by genre and among them by interpre@@ ter .
&quot; group@@ ing Genre / Interpre@@ t / Album - This setting works as well as the above , but is additionally sorted according to the album below the interpre@@ ter . &quot;
&quot; with the help of the remaining buttons , you can adjust and combine group@@ ing completely . &quot;
&quot; with the last button you can change the settings to the collection . note : &amp; Amar@@ ok ; will automatically record your collection once you change something at selected folders . if you own a lot of pieces , this might take a while . &quot;
&quot; directly under the tool@@ bar , there is a search filter . it beha@@ ves in the list view as well as in the tree view . hints for using this filter can be found in the playlist section in this manual . &quot;
&quot; under the search filter there is a selection box , with which help you can filter out the last additions to your collection . you can also select your Total collection from the last 24 hours up to one year . furthermore , you can also select your total collection , whereby the filter is practically disabled . &quot;
&quot; by clicking with the right mouse button on an entry in the collection browser , you will get the following options . &quot;
load - This emp@@ s the current playlist and insert the selected pieces in the currently valid order in the playback .
attach to playlist - Ad@@ just the selected pieces of the current playlist . by double @-@ clicking on one entry you reach the same effect .
set pieces in queu@@ e - This function adds the selected pieces to the queu@@ e . this will be played next .
&quot; save as a playlist , Save the selected pieces as a playlist . you will be asked for a name under which the list should be stored . &quot;
&quot; committed to media players - Add the pieces into the queu@@ e to transfer to the media player . for more details , see the Media Player Browser section . &quot;
burn all pieces of this piece / burn / burn to CD - This option is not displayed as a CD or audio CD . if K@@ 3@@ b is not installed then this option is not shown .
edit Metad@@ ata ( for n pieces ) ... - Op@@ ens the dialog for piece information and lets you change the tags for one or more pieces .
&quot; ( n ) Move files in the tr@@ ash bin ... - Op@@ ens a confirmation dialog . if you confirm this , the selected files will be deleted from your computer . &quot;
&quot; mark the selection - marking the selected album as a compilation , and it appears among different interpre@@ ters . &quot;
&quot; the album will then no longer be displayed under different interpre@@ ters , but again under the corresponding interpre@@ ter . &quot;
&quot; the play@@ lists browsers are easy to handle many play@@ lists . among other things , it also contains Intel@@ ligent Play@@ lists . &quot;
the lower part of the play@@ lists browser contains the smart play@@ lists . these use &amp; Amar@@ ok ; s built @-@ in database to automatically create some useful play@@ lists at run@@ time . the smart play@@ lists consist of :
never played : a playlist with pieces in your collection that have never been played .
&quot; even self @-@ created Intel@@ ligent Play@@ lists are possible . click the Smart playlist to open the dialog to create a new Smart playlist , where you can enter all the necessary criteria for your new playlist . &quot;
&quot; the Media Player sub@@ window will be used for connecting &amp; Amar@@ ok ; using your portable media player ( e.g. iPod ) . for example , use your iPod with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; to be included in / m@@ nt / i@@ pod , you will find the pieces on your iPod to interpret sorted in the top list view of the Media Player browser . &quot;
&quot; to transfer pieces to your iPod , drag the desired titles from the playlist and let them fall on the list interpre@@ ter . if you &apos;re done , click App@@ ly . this way the pieces will be uploaded to your iPod . when the transmission is completed , exit &amp; Amar@@ ok ; and resolve the drive binding for your iPod . &quot;
&quot; under the tool@@ bar there is a search field , with which you can search for a file . the search is especially useful in folders with very many files , because in the file list all files are hidden that do not match your search criteria . &quot;
&quot; for example tar : / home / mi@@ ke / musik@@ .@@ tar@@ .g@@ z input and press En@@ ter , you can listen to music in the music .@@ tar@@ .g@@ z file . now you can drag the music from there to the playlist . &quot;
&quot; if the playlist is longer than in the window , the attachment of files can be difficult by simply falling down . in this case the holding of the Shift key can be helpful : this will be automatically inserted at the end of the list , and not on the mouse position . &quot;
&quot; the playlist contains all of you to play . you can change the order by simply drag@@ ging the entries with the mouse to the desired location . as soon as you enter letters , just press the pieces that the letters contain . to reset the filter , press the back button until the text box is empty again . &quot;
&quot; if you enter by spaces separated search terms , &amp; Amar@@ ok ; search for entries that contain all search terms . if you type one two three , the search will find all entries that contain one , two and three . &quot;
&quot; for example : one OR two OR three . in this example , all pieces are found that contain one or two or three ( or a combination thereof ) . &quot;
&quot; if you want to search for entries that contain whit@@ esp@@ ace , then change the search term with go@@ ose feet : Mike Old@@ field . this will be searched for entries that Mike Old@@ field contains , but not according to entries like Mike J. Old@@ field . &quot;
&quot; if you specify a specific search column , you can also look for larger or smaller ones . for example : rating : &gt; 50 . this searches for pieces that have a higher rating than 50 . &quot;
&quot; if you want to search for a piece that does not contain a specific keyword , set a minus sign in front of the search term : -@@ something looks for pieces that do not contain something . &quot;
&quot; for example , Mike Old@@ field OR scores : &gt; 50 comment : bad . this searches for all pieces that either contain Mike Old@@ field , or a higher rating than 50 and do not contain the comment bath . &quot;
&quot; you can set the sequence sequence of entries by holding down the C@@ trl key , and then with the right mouse button in the desired sequence click on the entries . the entries will then get a mark with a number . the number corresponds to the order in which the pieces are played . &quot;
&quot; the playlist of the playlist is located at the bottom of the window . it contains buttons for some of the playlist functions . on the left side , you will find the Add to which you can add to the playlist . right next , you can save playlist , empty playlist , and sus@@ cep@@ tible to mixing . &quot;
&quot; next , follow the buttons back and restore . this allows you to undo or restore changes to the playlist . &quot;
&quot; in the middle of the tool@@ bar , there is a unique , magni@@ fied Analy@@ zer . the refres@@ her rate can be set with a click of the right mouse button on the analy@@ zer . &quot;
the last button in the tool@@ bar is menu . it opens the same menu as the one you &apos;ll get in the player window over the right mouse button . over this menu you can set up &amp; Amar@@ ok ; &apos; s configuration .
&quot; there are many other buttons available for tool@@ bars , for example playback roles and volume control . you can set up the displayed buttons by clicking on the menu and set up tool@@ bars ... &quot;
&quot; the status bar gives you a quick overview of useful information about the playlist . it displays the title of the current piece , the number of pieces and the playing time of all pieces . &quot;
&quot; you can also hide the status bar , and disable the status bar option in the General Settings . &quot;
&quot; the context menu can be reached by clicking with the right mouse button in the player window , or by clicking on the playlist on the menu . &quot;
a click on this entry opens the window Visu@@ alization Plugins . there you can select the visu@@ aliz@@ ations of &amp; Amar@@ ok .
&quot; after this entry , there is a sub @-@ menu with links to this document and other information about &amp; Amar@@ ok . &quot;
the cover management is a useful tool for managing your cover pictures . you can start it by selecting actions cover management in the collection browser .
the cover management contains a list view of all albums in your collection . you can view all albums of an interpre@@ ter in your collection by selecting the interpre@@ ter on the left @-@ hand side .
&quot; with the View menu , you can choose what to display in the cover management . select from : &quot;
&quot; the queu@@ e administration received your great suit in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; 1.3 . with this feature you have even more control over the playlist . after you set a piece in the queu@@ e , the playlist will appear in the playlist : 1 is played first , 2 as second , and so on . &quot;
&quot; if you want to add a piece to the queu@@ e , select the piece in the playlist and then click + . you can also easily add the pieces with the mouse or use the context menu in the playlist . you can then change the order of the pieces in the queu@@ e administration . &quot;
&quot; there are three types of dynamic play@@ lists , two of which are already pre@@ defined ( the details to set up this later ) . &quot;
fill your playlist with random pieces from your entire collection and add more random pieces during playback .
adds pieces based on Last@@ .@@ fm recommendations ( previously : audi@@ os@@ c@@ rob@@ bler ) . this mode requires that some pieces are already in your playlist . you don &apos;t need a load .@@ fm profile to work this dynamic playlist .
&quot; double click on the playlist you want , drag them to the playlist window or click with the right mouse button on you and then select charging . thus , your current playlist will be replaced by the new playlist . so you should save the old playlist in any circumstances ! &quot;
&quot; the two pre @-@ set modes Rand@@ om Mix and Play@@ lists mix immediately fill up your playlist and you can add at least one piece from your collection . the recommended pieces will be added at least one piece from your collection , so your playlist will be filled only at the end of the first piece . &quot;
&quot; if you want to keep the current playlist , activate the last possible dynamic mode : settings Dynamic mode . this will use your existing playlist as a starting point . &quot;
&quot; the New F@@ illing button comm@@ its the current playlist and adds new pieces to the dynamic mode . edit playlist opens the dialog to edit the playlist , and you can change the settings . &quot;
&quot; by right @-@ clicking on a dynamic playlist , you have the option to click Edit . then the dialog opens to edit the playlist settings . &quot;
&quot; enter any name for the playlist , but the name should be unique to avoid confusion . &quot;
&quot; if this setting is not active , your playlist will continue to grow , the setting for coming items will be ski@@ pped and you won &apos;t hear a piece twice in this playlist . however , if the setting is active , the already played pieces will be removed while resp@@ ecting the set @-@ up pieces . &quot;
&quot; played pieces - this is the number of pieces played at the beginning of the playlist , so you can easily see which pieces were recently played . &quot;
&quot; this is the number of pieces that are to be added to each played piece to the playlist . if you set more than 1 , the playlist will continue to grow , because only one piece can be played and removed . &quot;
&quot; the settings on the right are already described in the previous section . on the left side of the dialog , you can select from already existing play@@ lists or smart play@@ lists . if you cross multiple play@@ lists , &amp; Amar@@ ok ; random pieces from each playlist will be added . &quot;
some scripts allow your own settings . you can adjust the settings by starting the script and then click on setup .
&quot; you can install new scripts by installing a script package . after you have installed the script , a new entry will appear in the list . you can also install new scripts directly from the Internet . &quot;
&quot; if you don &apos;t want to use a script longer , you can delete it . select the script to delete and then click Un@@ install . &quot;
&quot; if you are looking for information on writing your own scripts , please refer to the Scrip@@ ts section . &quot;
&quot; the dialog window Visu@@ alization Plugins is used to activate the available visu@@ aliz@@ ations in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; the window contains a list of all available plugins . to use a plugin , simply activate the box next to the name . &quot;
&quot; this Quick Start Guide will show you how to create an audio CD in four steps . to track the steps , you need to have an exec@@ utable installation of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; and have a folder with audio files . &quot;
this is a dialog box where you can choose which files you want to burn to CD .
&quot; if you want to burn an audio CD from MP3 s or other lossy formats , remember that you will receive a bad quality when you ren@@ ew to MP3 , no matter how high the bit@@ rate is . you can check if an audio CD is created from a lossy Format . use the au@@ CD@@ t@@ ect project . &quot;
&quot; in this dialog window , you can &apos;t do anything . wait until the machine has finished the burning process . &quot;
&quot; this Quick Start Guide will show you how to copy &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; copy a data CD in just four steps . to follow the steps , you need to have an exec@@ utable installation of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; and have inserted the source CD into the CD Rom drive . &quot;
&quot; to copy a data CD , please select Extras , Copy CD ... from the menu . you now see a dialog with the possible settings for burning . &quot;
&quot; after you have all &amp; k@@ 3@@ b settings , please press the button Start . you now see a dialog that looks like this : &quot;
&quot; in this dialog window , you can track the progress of the copy process . once the original reading of the original is finished into the image file , you will be asked for an empty CD medium to burn the data . &quot;
&amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; burns down the image file . you must now wait until the total progress has reached 100 % .

the Q@@ T designer tool U@@ IC can &apos;t find the wid@@ get modules . to fix this problem start q@@ t@@ config and add $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ RS / lib / k@@ de@@ 3 / plugins to the search path for libraries ( replace $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ RS by your base folder of &amp; k@@ de ; ) .
the website of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; can be found at www.k@@ 3@@ b@@ .org where you will get the latest version of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; you can also get feedback from the forums and learn new developments .
&quot; if you wish to use &amp; k@@ 3@@ b , you need at least &amp; k@@ de ; 3.1 and &amp; Q@@ t ; 3.1 . &quot;
&amp; c@@ dr@@ da@@ o ; : this program burns audio or data CD runs in a run ( also called disk @-@ at @-@ once mode or DA@@ O ) based on a tex@@ tual description of the CD content ( TO@@ C file ) .
&amp; cd@@ record ; / m@@ kis@@ ofs ; : burns all kinds of CD @-@ R@@ s . &amp; cd@@ record ; has all functions that also &amp; c@@ dr@@ da@@ o ; offers and extends these functions even . therefore sel@@ ects &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; however achieves a higher quality with burned audio CDs .
cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia : a program for reading digital audio data from a CD ( CD@@ DA - Compact Disc Digital Audio ) .
O@@ GG Vor@@ bis is a completely open and patent @-@ free and professional technology for audio @-@ coding and for dealing with audio data streams . O@@ GG Vor@@ bis benefits from Open Source and is in direct competition to MP3 . this library is used by O@@ gg Vor@@ bis Dec@@ oder and En@@ coder modules .
&quot; M@@ ad : this is a high @-@ quality MPEG @-@ Audio decoder . it currently supports MPEG @-@ 1 , MPEG @-@ 2 and MPEG 2.5 . all three audio layers layer I , Layer II , and Layer III ( e.g. MP3 ) are fully supported . this library is used by the MP3 Dec@@ oder Module . &quot;
l@@ ame : a widely developed MP3 decoder that can compete in terms of quality and speed with commercial enco@@ ders . l@@ ame is used by the MP3 enco@@ der module .
FLA@@ C : a free open source co@@ dec for loss@@ less audio compression and de@@ compression . it is used by the FLA@@ C decoder module and the external audio enco@@ der module so you can read and write FLA@@ C files .
&quot; li@@ bs@@ nd@@ file , FF@@ m@@ peg , FLA@@ C , Mus@@ ep@@ ack Dec@@ oder : other libraries for processing different audio formats . &quot;
SO@@ X : a tool that can convert and convert between different audio formats . SO@@ X is used by the So@@ X audio enco@@ der module .
Trans@@ code : a command @-@ line program for video processing . you need it if you want to read a DVD .
&quot; V@@ C@@ DI@@ ma@@ ger : a full @-@ featured author system for editing , dis@@ assem@@ bling and analyzing video CDs and super video CDs . &quot;
&quot; norm@@ alize : this tool is used to adjust the volume of music files to a standard stage . for example , this can be useful for creating mixed CD &apos;s and M@@ p@@ 3 collections ; without norm@@ alize , the different recording levels of the different albums can lead to the un@@ attractive effect that the music pieces can be played differently . &quot;
e@@ Movi@@ es : this is a very small Linux distribution . it contains the necessary software to be able to run from CD and automatically reproduce all videos in the base folder of the CD .
this is a convenient method to re@@ charge recently opened projects . the associated sub @-@ menu contains a list of these projects . one click on one entry opens the project .
&quot; save the current project . if the project has already been saved , the previously created file will be over@@ written , otherwise it will be asked for a new file name . &quot;
save the current project under a new filename . K@@ DE &apos;s Di@@ alogue Save As is displayed with which you can choose folder and file name for the project file .
saves all opened projects . this is the same as if you would call for each individual project file saving .
&quot; closes the current project . if a project has been modified and not yet saved , ask &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; after what will happen . you can then choose between saving and change . furthermore , you can also cancel the closing and keep the project open . &quot;
&quot; includes all opened projects . &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; will ask for any project that is not stored , just as if you would have called for each project file C@@ lose . &quot;
&quot; includes all opened projects and termin@@ ated &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; . for each project that is not stored , it will be asked what to do with it , as if you called a file closing . &quot;
&quot; when you call this entry , you can select files to add to the project via the appearing dialog . this has the same effect as if you are entering the files directly from the top view into the project view . if the current project is a data CD , the added files will appear in the base folder of the CD . &quot;
&quot; opens the dialogue &quot; &quot; Burn &quot; &quot; for the current project . this dialog is basically the same as the properties dialog of the project . the only difference is the additional button burning , the &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; the burning dialog can only open when the project already contains data . &quot;
&quot; open the Properties dialog for the current project . here you can make many project related settings . each project type has different possible settings , most of which are described above the What is that ? help ( accessible via the right mouse button ) . &quot;
this entry will only appear with an active data CD / DVD or video DVD project . it causes &amp; k@@ 3@@ b to import files from a previous session to the current project . this is useful when you are not using files for a multi @-@ session CD .
&quot; this entry will only appear with an active data CD / DVD or video DVD project . this function causes &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; , remove imported files from the current project . &quot;
&quot; alternatively , you can only create a copy of a CD that you can burn later on . alternatively , you can also use a copy of a CD that you want to burn later on . you should also prefer to copy cl@@ oning if you want to copy CDs with defective sectors or video CDs . &quot;
&quot; alternatively , you can only create a copy of a DVD that you can burn later on . alternatively , you can also use a copy of a DVD with the help of the copying dialog . therefore , the target medium must be big enough to record the entire video ) data of the source medium in the original form . &quot;
opens the dialog to delete a CD @-@ RW . this allows you to delete all contents or parts of a CD @-@ RW .
opens the dialog to format a DVD . with this dialog you can format a DVD ± R ( W ) so the contents will be completely deleted . &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; allows you to choose between writing mod@@ i over@@ writing and incre@@ mental .
&quot; the dialog will burn after an * .@@ iso , * .@@ cue or * .@@ to@@ c file as data source , which can then be burned instantly by pressing the burning button . ( Ner@@ os * .@@ nr@@ g files are currently not supported , but you need to use other tools such as Nr@@ g@@ 2@@ I@@ so . ) &quot;
&quot; the dialog will burn after an * .@@ iso file as a data source , which can then be burned instantly by pressing the burning button . &quot;
&quot; this dialog window usually appears after reading a DVD in the content view , but can also be used single @-@ standing . it contains information about the read @-@ out video , enco@@ ding settings , and even possibilities for changing the size and cut black edges . &quot;
&quot; displays information about the pic@@ kled medium . this information is displayed in the content view and include the features of the medium , such as size and title length of the CD or DVD . &quot;
&quot; displays a list of the tool@@ bars of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; . if an entry is crossed , the tool@@ bar is currently visible in the main window . &quot;
&quot; if this is crossed , a small bar is displayed at the bottom of the window . it contains information about the status of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; and its activities . if this is not checked , the status bar is hidden . &quot;
&quot; the folder view includes an overview of your folders and the CD / DVD drives . if the contents view is enabled , their content is displayed in the content view . CD / DVD drives also have a context menu with functions such as media information , locks and un@@ locking of the drive or ej@@ ector of the medium . &quot;
&quot; the content view is also the interface to read audio or video CDs , if a drive with a corresponding CD / DVD is selected in the folder view . &quot;
&quot; the head@@ line is a narrow@@ er area , which is only visible when the project view has open projects . the head strip has no real function , it only looks pretty and separates the project view clearly from the rest of the views . &quot;
&quot; this opens a dialog window to change the key assignments for &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; after selecting one of the available commands in the upper part , you can adjust the file association settings below . &quot;
&quot; this will start the k@@ 3@@ b ; setup wiz@@ ard . this allows the correct per@@ missions to burn CDs and DVDs . for this , system administrators need to enter the password for the system administrator ( root ) . &quot;
opens the settings of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; here you can make general program settings . almost all functions of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; should work on An@@ hi@@ eb . this dialog is intended for person@@ alizing and fine tuning of the program .
&quot; &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; is how many other &amp; k@@ de ; applications also , equipped with a &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; interface . with the help of this interface , parts of the functionality can be controlled for example via a shell script . &quot;
&quot; to use the &amp; D@@ CO@@ P functions , you can either use the command line program d@@ co@@ p , or the slightly more convenient K@@ d@@ co@@ p program . &quot;
&quot; in this chapter we assume that you use the command line program d@@ co@@ p . to use the &amp; D@@ CO@@ P functions , you must first make sure that &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; then enter something like the following on the console : &quot;
&quot; besides the general &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; functions that have all &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ program have in common , supports &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; mainly two other parts described below . &quot;
&quot; the standard D@@ CO@@ P interface of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; provides features like copy@@ CD , format@@ DVD and other functions for creating new projects . &quot;

&quot; as a result of such a cre@@ ate@@ XX@@ X@@ Project method you get a D@@ CO@@ P reference to the newly created project : D@@ CO@@ P@@ Ref ( k@@ 3@@ b , K@@ 3@@ b@@ Project @-@ 0 ) Altern@@ atively you can create a project via the command line : # k@@ 3@@ b --@@ audi@@ oc@@ d and then a reference to the project using # d@@ co@@ p k@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b@@ Interface curr@@ ent@@ Project By using this reference it is possible to change the project via K@@ 3@@ b@@ Proj@@ ect@@ Interface . &quot;
&quot; K@@ 3@@ b offers the K@@ 3@@ b@@ Proj@@ ect@@ Interface listed above and the powerful K@@ 3@@ b@@ Data@@ Proj@@ ect@@ Interface , which applies only to data projects ( CD and DVD ) : &quot;

&amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; is an audio CD ; read out for &amp; k@@ de ; . with it you can easily read audio CD ; s and other formats are possible depending on the enco@@ der that is installed on the computer .
&amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; is the user interface of cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia ( for reading &amp; CD ; -@@ data in WAV files on the hard drive ) and by many enco@@ ders that enco@@ des these WAV files ( these enco@@ der packages still need to be installed from the Linux distribution ) . more enco@@ ders can be added to the program ( if they have been installed ) .
&quot; first , the titles of the &amp; CD ; read out and stored in WAV files on the computer ( loss@@ less and compressed ) ; and then &quot;
will be compressed in a second step these WAV files ( usually one per title ) compressed into the MP@@ 3- or O@@ GG format or also in other formats like the loss @-@ free FLA@@ C .
&quot; for the first step , the reading of the &amp; CD ; , is used by &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . almost every distribution has compiled a pre @-@ compiled package ; if this is not yet installed , it has to be done now . &quot;
&quot; for the second step l@@ ame ( for MP3 ) , og@@ g@@ vor@@ bis ( for O@@ GG ) or other co@@ dec need to be installed . &quot;
&quot; which enco@@ ding / file format should be used ? the chapter Wel@@ cher Ko@@ di@@ ver gives a small introduction about enco@@ der , audio quality and compression factors . &quot;
&quot; a word for copying protected audio CD ; s : as already mentioned , used &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia to read the audio data from the &amp; CD ; this program is not intended to avoid any copy protection . &quot;
&quot; while inser@@ ting only once has to be done ( the setup dialog can be called so often until a suitable configuration is found ) , the daily handling of the reading of a &amp; CD will be explained to the hard drive . this leads ( hopefully ) to understand the slim approach of the user interface , which will often stum@@ ble at the beginning . &quot;
&quot; can convert to many formats - depending on which enco@@ der programs are installed ( MP3 , O@@ GG , FLA@@ C &amp; etc . ) &quot;
&quot; can &amp; CD ; retrieve information from the fre@@ ed@@ b from the Internet or can work completely without a network , with everything being recorded manually . &quot;
&quot; this is just a short list of the commands of the main window . on the page , for example , you will find more information about how this program is used as well as screen photos with descriptions of the tab@@ s for the configuration of the program . &quot;
&quot; ( this can be locally or online , in the latter case the connection to the Internet must first be established . ) &quot;
start reading and - when a enco@@ der has been configured in the Settings tab in the configuration directory - enco@@ ding .
&quot; opens a sub@@ menu with a list of enco@@ ders available , so that the selection with a different enco@@ der can be read as the default . note that previously the enco@@ der has been configured in the configuration tab in the setup dialog . &quot;
&quot; opens the file manager , so that an already selected file is selected for enco@@ ding instead of a full &amp; CD ; read and code . &quot;
&quot; opens the setup dialog to configure the type of noti@@ fications ( such as logging , pi@@ ep@@ sen ) for program events ( such as reading the &amp; CD ; termin@@ ated ) . &quot;
&quot; opens the main setup dialog by &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; with different card cards ( like En@@ coder , for setting up the enco@@ der ) . here you need to go before the program can be used successfully ! &quot;
&quot; this chapter describes sound quality , enco@@ der and compression rates and helps you choose the right co @-@ owner . &quot;
&quot; if no audio information is to be lost , a loss@@ less audio format is required . besides FLA@@ C there are also other like &apos; sh@@ orten &apos; or &apos; monkey &apos; , which may be available for this distribution . the dis@@ advantages are the low compression rates and hardly available commercial devices that can reproduce these files . &quot;
&quot; under the audio formats , the information by data compression depending on their psycho@@ acoustic model , MP3 and O@@ GG are the most common . O@@ GG may have a slight advantage over MP3 in the audio quality at lower bit@@ rates ( up to 128 k@@ bps ) , but the differences are less important since both co@@ vers produce very good audio quality . &quot;
&quot; O &apos; not so &apos; free , l@@ ame is nevertheless included with most distri@@ butions free of charge , but there are open license questions &quot;
&quot; + high to very high sound quality ( at high bit@@ rates ) , but slightly lower quality compared to O@@ GG in deeper bit@@ rates . &quot;
O@@ GG - if only music is heard from a computer or a computer based music system and / or if one of the few existing O@@ GG playback devices are available .
&quot; MP3 - if music is also included on other devices , such as standard DVD player , portable devices ( USB stick , memory card , hard disk ) or special car stereo systems . today - initially 2009 - these devices mostly support only the MP3 format . &quot;
a short list of parameters for audio quality and resulting compression rates for &apos; l@@ ame &apos; ( MP@@ 3s ) ( see &apos; l@@ ame --@@ help &apos; for further parameters ) :
&apos;@@ pres@@ et medium &apos; = This setting results in good transparency for most people and most of the music
&quot; &apos; pres@@ et standard &apos; = This setting should usually provide for most people and most music pieces acceptable transparency , and has quite high quality . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo systems with high quality . &quot;
&quot; --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; = 224 to 256 k@@ bps V@@ BR , compression rate up to 6.3 . needs up to 320 k@@ bps for complex music pieces and a little less for less complex parts of the piece . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo systems with high quality . this is the preferred choice . &quot;
&quot; --@@ pres@@ et extreme -@@ b 256 &apos; = 256 k@@ bps C@@ BR , compression rate about 5.5 . needs always 256 k@@ bps for complex and less complex pieces of a title . some older devices need C@@ BR@@ s . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo systems with high quality . &quot;
&quot; -@@ h &apos; = 128 k@@ bps C@@ BR joint stereo , compression rate about 11 . 128 k@@ bps for all pieces of a title . good enough for music from you@@ ths , portable devices and auto@@ stere@@ ograms . but not good enough for better HiFi stereo systems . &quot;
&quot; --@@ pres@@ et Ins@@ ane &apos; = 320@@ k@@ bps C@@ BR . this setting will be exagger@@ ated for most people and most environments , but if you absolutely want to have the absolute highest quality without regard to the file size , then choose this setting . &quot;
the &amp; CD ; information that is entered manually or automatically retri@@ eved from the fre@@ ed@@ b via the Internet are available in the program as a list of parameters . you can pass / use with &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; and the enco@@ ding program to create the folder and file names as well as the properties of music files .
&quot; in connection with enco@@ ding programs , there is often a combination of programs for the enco@@ der and these parameters here . the manual or the help of the enco@@ ders explain the switches for these programs . &quot;
&quot; for example , to add the &amp; CD ; title to the keywords ( English : day ) when MP@@ 3s are enco@@ ded with l@@ ame , the switch -@@ tt of l@@ ame and the title parameters of &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator must be added . the result looks like &apos; ... -@@ TT { title } ... &apos; . &quot;
this is a summary of &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; parameters that can be used ( = button name in the wiz@@ ard ) :
&quot; this is what the fre@@ ed@@ b is : a free database where people can read the audio CDs that can download / enter the information , so that all the others can download this information instead of entering the computer . it &apos;s worth not@@ ing that here is only spoken by text : &amp; CD ; Title , artist , names of pieces &amp; etc ; , not by the audio file itself . &quot;
&quot; yes , it should be legal , but I ( referring to the translator : this means the author ) am not a lawyer . however , no one can prevent you from the &amp; CD ; there is no more or less worth@@ less , so neither the artist nor the music company can be har@@ med . all information can be obtained anyway with a bum@@ ble through a &amp; CD ; business , physical or virtual . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; is active to select an address ( sending an address ) . for the use of fre@@ ed@@ b , the e @-@ mail address is not used when retri@@ eving the data from the server ( This can only know the program@@ mer that has checked the code . ) &quot;
&quot; there are copies of the main database in many countries . if &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator , to use fre@@ ed@@ b , the ge@@ ographi@@ cally closest mirror server is to be used . this saves bandwidth on the network and balances the load between the hosts . &quot;
a visit to fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org provides a current list of mir@@ r@@ oring servers for the online retri@@ eval of &amp; CD ; information during the reading of a &amp; CD ; alternatively the complete database can be downloaded or ( usually created monthly ) only the updates of the database .
which reading program is used to store pieces from CD ; in wa@@ v files on my computer ?
&quot; there are rum@@ ors that cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia is used ; anyone who wants to know it more accurately , search in source code .... This has always been the best choice for reading audio CD ; see note that the cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia package must be installed from the appropriate distribution first if this has not happened yet . &quot;
&quot; to save the selected WAV files , the enco@@ der and therefore the desired file format can be selected . during the first opening are pre @-@ defined entries for l@@ ame ( MP@@ 3s ) , og@@ gen@@ c ( O@@ g@@ gs ) and FLA@@ C ( a loss@@ less compression for audio data ) on the tab for setting the enco@@ der . other enco@@ ders can be added on this tab itself . &quot;
the Ko@@ di@@ ver package must be installed by the concerned Linux distribution before the enco@@ der can be used . this is also required for the pre@@ defined enco@@ der . more information about enco@@ ders are in the chapter Wel@@ cher Ko@@ di@@ ver .
&quot; after installing a co@@ dec , you can get more information about its switches by entering a command like l@@ ame -@@ help or l@@ ame --@@ help in a console window ( eg ; console ) . it must be replaced by the name of the installed code . &quot;
&quot; this can have many causes . check the device name of the &amp; CD ; / DVD disk , write and read real on it and whether both cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia and audio enco@@ ders of your choice ( l@@ ame for MP@@ 3s , og@@ gen@@ c for o@@ g@@ gs , fla@@ c &amp; etc ; ) are installed . &quot;
check if you don &apos;t want to read a copy protected audio CD ; check out the cover of the &amp; CD ; this will not succeed !
&quot; there is a chapter with a step by step sample . even if you use other settings , you can give tips how to proceed . &quot;
&quot; have you read the complete manual , everything understood , but are somehow still unsure what to do ? well , no problem , follow this step @-@ by @-@ step example , and you &apos;ll get enough information to set up those areas that make the program exactly what you want . &quot;
&quot; in this example , we will start the program for the first time , set up everything and read our first &amp; CD ; we will use l@@ ame &apos; --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; to generate MP@@ 3s using a V@@ BR ( variable bit rate ) from 224 to 256 k@@ bps on average and ID@@ 3@@ V1 keywords . &quot;
&quot; cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia and l@@ ame must already be installed on your computer . both programs should be found as pre @-@ compiled packages for your Linux distribution . an appropriate package for l@@ ame can be found for example using a search engine , as it is not necessary to compile the source files , which you can of course do . &quot;
please make sure that the directory / usr / share / cd consists and that you own write @-@ outs on it ( eg ; by trying to copy something into it with the con@@ quer@@ or ) .
&quot; the first section covers the basic alignment of &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; , something that is probably done once and &quot;
the second section describes how to read a &amp; CD ; what needs to be repeated for any &amp; CD ;
here we determine the enco@@ der to use the music ( l@@ ame ) as well as the audio format ( --@@ pres@@ et extreme = &gt; V@@ BR 224 to 256 k@@ bps ) .
&quot; although we can change these settings at any time , we will probably not change it with any read of a &amp; CD ; change once the appropriate settings are found . &quot;
the device name is passed to the reading program so that it can read the &amp; CD ; -@@ data / pieces .
often / dev / c@@ drom is a symbolic link to the actual device name of your drive . if this does not work or if there is more than one &amp; CD ; / DVD drive there can also be a look at the file / etc / f@@ stab and an attempt with the entries of the device desig@@ nations for the &amp; CD @-@ ROM ; and / or DVD drives .
&quot; the map map General settings . here &apos;s not much to do here . here , an additional conversion can be defined . in our example everything is as loaded / entered as shown in the screen@@ shot . &quot;
&quot; only in case of incomplete information , please select so that you will be informed if information about generating keywords ( tags ) is missing . &quot;
the card @-@ card CD ; -@@ settings . simply select both entries . we are comfortable and let the &amp; CD ; data can be downloaded automatically via the Internet from a fre@@ ed@@ b computer .
note : the computer must be connected to the fre@@ ed@@ b server while reading the &amp; CD .
&quot; the second drop @-@ down field is simpler , a &amp; CD ; entry is found , starts immediately the reading of the &amp; CD ; this is associated with low risk if you are later dis@@ satisfied with the database entry and the resulting directory names / fil@@ en@@ ames or tag entries , they can easily be changed . the directory name or filename is changed with Kon@@ quer@@ or name and the ID@@ 3 tags with K@@ id@@ 3 , dem &amp; k@@ de ; Tag@@ ger . &quot;
&quot; apart from this example , please note : if you want to manually enter everything manually , de@@ activate the selection fields and fre@@ ed@@ b will not be used . however , you can use fre@@ ed@@ b locally in offline mode , consider this twice if this is worthwhile . to fre@@ ed@@ b in offline mode , the two sel@@ ections must be selected , at least the first . the mode is set up on the following card map . &quot;
&quot; CD@@ DB is fre@@ ed@@ b for us . these are settings for the data request , for retri@@ eving the &amp; CD ; information from fre@@ ed@@ b server via the Internet . how does the system know which data to get the CD ? read the section about fre@@ ed@@ b . set everything as shown in the screen@@ shot . &quot;
&quot; mode : we did not download the database , we just want to work with the remote database on the Internet server . &quot;
&quot; CD@@ DB server : please go to fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org and look for a mirror server nearby . on this way , the load is distributed between the machines . however , this setting will work as the first attempt . &quot;
&quot; both function as far as the server is concerned , as many fire@@ walls boot the protocol 88@@ 80 by default , there may be more luck with the protocol 80 , because the protocol is usually open to surf the internet . &quot;
&quot; in this example , we do not want to send data to the fre@@ ed@@ b server . de@@ activ@@ ating the first box should suff@@ ice . &quot;
just take the settings from the screen shot . ( make sure the folder / tmp exists on your computer )
&quot; sorry , there is no translation for this news @-@ article . &quot;
&quot; CD ; after reading the last piece , check this to the &amp; CD ; to disc@@ ard at the end of the process . &quot;
&quot; custom folder for temporary files : if you cross this , then / must be specified the path / folder where the .@@ wa@@ v files are saved . this can be useful if only space on another drive is present . if the box is not checked , the files will be created in the private folder . don &apos;t forget that folder if you want to do something with the wa@@ v files . &quot;
&quot; the command is a bit long , under certain circumstances it must be blin@@ ded to the right to see everything . &quot;
&quot; --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; defines the audio quality of MP@@ 3s . as mentioned earlier , this is a setting for very good audio quality , even for very good HiFi stereo systems . the resulting compression factor is 6.3 . this is a good balance between audio quality and memory usage . &quot;
note the entry &apos; --@@ id@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 @-@ only &apos; for restri@@ cting the creation of tags to version V1 / V@@ 1.@@ 1.@@ &apos; ID@@ 3@@ v2 &apos; tags can also be deleted if necessary . K@@ id@@ 3 is an excellent &apos; id@@ 3 &apos; tag@@ ger for &amp; k@@ de ; in case of a later change of tags . % f and % o are internal variables for the name of the input file ( including the full path ) and the output file ( including the full path ) .
set the rest as in the screen@@ shot . some comments for future use outside of this example :
&quot; number of enco@@ ding WAV files at the same time : with a dual core or quad@@ core or even a multi@@ processor machine , you can try to en@@ code more than one WAV file at the same time . &quot;
&quot; this is it , we just have the basic setup of &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; finished . this configuration is used as a standard for each reading of a &amp; CD ; if you have selected the organizational structure of your music , you never need to change it again . &quot;
&quot; this section describes how the process of reading the &amp; CD ; we will create MP3 files . the folder structure , the way the music is organized on the hard drive , has been set up in the previous section , as we are comfortable and the &amp; CD ; the process of which is described in this section must be repeated for any read &amp; CD . &quot;
&quot; as we use a &amp; CD which is not yet contained in fre@@ ed@@ b , the screen@@ shots look a bit different than the data for a &amp; CD ; with successful fre@@ ed@@ b collected data . therefore , you will learn the &amp; CD ; to manually enter data instead of retri@@ eving them from the Internet . comments will point to the differences . &quot;
try not to find the &amp; CD ; this example is to be found . it is a &apos; special &apos; edition of the author of this manual .
&quot; if this has not happened yet , now the &amp; CD has to be inserted into the drive defined in the main window . &quot;
&quot; after a brief moment , the pieces and their length should be listed in the window , as shown in the screen@@ shot . &quot;
&quot; if this is not done , then look for questions and answers on the Help section or go back to the previous section regarding basic settings . &quot;
&quot; attention : if the &amp; CD could be retri@@ eved from the fre@@ ed@@ b , all titles of the songs are already filled out and the name of the artist and the album are displayed . &quot;
&quot; in the event that there is more than one entry in the database with the &apos; unique &apos; &amp; CD ; -@@ key for your &amp; CD ; there will be a window , and you can select the database entry that suits your opinion best for your &amp; CD ; fits . &quot;
&quot; if you have not selected the check box for the automatic query of fre@@ ed@@ b ( on the page &amp; CD ; -@@ settings in the dialog for the settings ) , you can also trigger this by choosing the first button in the tool@@ bar . if you do not have a local database , but retrieve the data from the Internet , you need the connection to the Internet . &quot;
e 1.2 Step 02 : the CD @-@ Editor - input of the CD @-@ data and the title of the first piece
&quot; enter the data for your &amp; CD ; according to the pattern on the next screen shot , enter the title of the piece in the first line of the input field &apos; current title &apos; , the rest of the data in the input field &apos; Album &apos; . &quot;
the artist no longer needs to be entered in the input field &apos; Current Title &apos; unless you have a compilation with different artists for each piece .
&quot; the comment field can be used for the individual comments ini@@ di@@ vidu@@ ell per piece , the commentary box of the album is used for comments that are valid for all pieces of the CD . &quot;
&quot; note : after the successful retri@@ eval of the data from the fre@@ ed@@ b the CD editor is not empty , but it already contains the data as shown in the following screen@@ shot . however , it is always a good idea to check the contents of the CD editor ( e.g. whether all words are starting with upper@@ case letters or not ... ) , but also to check if there are any unwanted comments . &quot;
&quot; note : in this example we only use ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 tags . this limits the length of fields to 30 characters for the artist , album and title of a piece and on only 28 characters for the comment field . &quot;
&quot; you can change the tag information of the generated files later with the tag editor . K@@ id@@ 3 is a good tool for MP3 files , with it you can also create ID@@ 3@@ v2 tags . &quot;
tags are not supported by all coding or file formats . see Help for the enco@@ der to get more information .
&quot; for more information go to fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org website and read the information about the categories . pop or R@@ ap , for example , can be found under Rock . &quot;
&quot; after selecting &apos; OK &apos; , return to the main window . simply click on the line with the second piece . &quot;
&quot; the CD editor window appears again and you can see that the fields for the album are already filled with the entered data , which we have recorded for the first piece . simply enter the entries for the fields of the current piece . the title of the piece definitely and other information you desire . &quot;
click on the next line in the main window and proceed in the same way until you entered all the title data of the &amp; CD ;
attention : this window doesn &apos;t appear if you have downloaded the data from the fre@@ ed@@ b . it is already sorted into one of these categories of the database .
it is the third button of the tool@@ bar . note that the artist and the album are shown above the piece list .
&quot; note that there is a check @-@ in before each line of a piece . only the titles that are selected are read out . a simple click on the line switches off the selection of the piece , or press the All pieces button on the bottom of the screen to select all the pieces at once . &quot;
&quot; by clicking on the button select select the reading process , this window will appear to confirm . click OK and then we will take a look at the window with the orders and track what happens . &quot;
&quot; click on the rider assignments to switch on the order window . it is in the left upper half of the window , directly below the buttons of the tool@@ bar . &quot;
this is the window to check the orders . the first piece is read straight to the hard drive . the status of the program is displayed in the lower part of the window in the status line .
this error message will see if you are trying to work with a code that you have not yet installed . pieces that have not been successfully coded are marked with a red &apos; X &apos; in the order list .
&quot; by the way , the folder for the T@@ MP file and the destination folder are not what we have entered here in the example . have you checked whether you have write access to the folder for the temporary files and the destination folder ? ; - ) &quot;
now it is clear why the error occurred directly after the end of the read@@ out of the first piece .
&quot; order 1 reads the first piece , it is finished . but we have a new entry : order 4 is the enco@@ ding of piece 1 into the format MP3 . &quot;
&quot; the author of the program has found no configuration setting to supp@@ ress this behavior . the only thing that seems configur@@ able is the number of parallel processes for reading and coding . with powerful machines , the result is un@@ clear . the used machine with a AM@@ D@@ 64 doesn &apos;t seem to have a problem with simultaneous reading and coding ( however two different pieces ) . &quot;
&quot; now the last title is read , while another piece is enco@@ ded and a third order in the queu@@ e of the coding stands . after the last piece is enco@@ ded , a small window will be displayed with a message for a short time in the upper left part of the window . &quot;
&quot; for the successful use of &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; , you need &amp; k@@ de ; 3.@@ x. resp@@ . 4.@@ x and cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . if you want to create compressed audio files like MP3 or O@@ GG , you need the enco@@ der of your choice . &quot;
&quot; if you are familiar with CV@@ S , you can download an anonymous copy from there . however , most distri@@ butions include a pre @-@ compiled package , as &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; most distri@@ butions include a pre @-@ compiled package , as &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator . if you read this , you probably already have done it ... &quot;
&quot; this section is aimed at people who compile from source files , and not for users who use a pre @-@ compiled package of their distribution . &quot;
&quot; if you are looking for help as the program can be adapted to your needs if it is running , then the following is correct for you : &quot;
&quot; a program that calls many different programs has many options . it &apos;s best to read the step by step , for example , to get to know the options and settings . it displays screen@@ shots of the different map cards of the settings and also contains comments for options that are not used in the example . &quot;
&quot; Hi , still to read on ? even if only the Help menu has been cli@@ cked after the initial start of the program , without any c@@ lue as it should proceed from this somehow empty screen ( especially if there is no audio CD in the drive ) , or from the un@@ usually short menu ? &quot;
&quot; who reads this , probably already started the program . it should look something like this : &quot;
&quot; a bad example : unfortunately , no e @-@ mail . the author cannot maintain this manual . it is intended as the first version for a manual to &amp; ch@@ audio@@ creator . if you read this , he has left this section and is therefore agre@@ eing with this suggestion . &quot;
&quot; strange if you succeeded in getting the source file from &amp; k@@ de ; SV@@ N , then you don &apos;t need these Inform@@ ations , but ... &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mid ; is the MI@@ DI@@ - and car@@ a@@ ok@@ esp@@ iel@@ er of &amp; k@@ de ; besides others , it also has some features with real @-@ time graphics and kar@@ aoke @-@ real @-@ time high@@ lighting of texts , the other &amp; UNIX ; -@@ MIDI players do not have . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mid ; runs under &amp; Linux ; and FreeBSD . it builds on the O@@ SS system , so it should work on all systems with O@@ SS - and &amp; k@@ de ; support also supports the &amp; Linux ; Ultr@@ as@@ ound project driver needed for G@@ US cards . Al@@ sa is involved as soon as it supports a sequ@@ encer . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mid ; displays the lyrics on the screen with changing color , making it easy to follow the piece . &quot;
graphical representation of the activity of each MIDI channel by raising the pressed keys on the ( virtual ) keyboard .
drag &amp; drop so that you can drag in &amp; k@@ de ; any MIDI file from a &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ windows can drag to k@@ mid .
supports the two existing standards to save text in MIDI files ( li@@ ars or tex@@ tures ) . k@@ mid automatically determines the procedure used .
&quot; when you finish a song , k@@ mid will start with the same song next time . &quot;
&quot; supports external MIDI synthes@@ izer , AW@@ E , FM and G@@ US cards ( for the latter you need the LU@@ P driver and g@@ us@@ d ) . &quot;
&quot; first , you can select ... from the File menu . it appears the usual file dialog , with which help you can select the desired song . &quot;
you can also drop a file from a &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; window into the &amp; k@@ mid window ; this works with several songs simultaneously .
&quot; to play a piece of music , open it and press the button Play in the tool@@ bar , select the entry from the menu piece or press the space button . &quot;
&quot; please note that &amp; k@@ mid ; one piece automatically starts , as soon as you move it to the &amp; k@@ mid ; ( for several pieces , they are added to a collection and then played after each other . ) &quot;
&quot; once &amp; k@@ mid ; play a piece , you can jump to any place by using the middle mouse button and drive with the regul@@ ator . &quot;
&quot; if you find that a song is too fast or too slow , you can click on the arrows to the left and right of the tempo gauge and change the playback speed . to get back the original tempo , double @-@ click on the Tem@@ po@@ - LCD . &quot;
&quot; the space key has two functions : when a piece is played , a pressure on the space bar acts like a pressure on the button Pause or selecting the menu entry in the menu piece , thus inter@@ rup@@ ts playback . press the space button while no piece is played , starts &amp; k@@ mid ; playback . &quot;
&quot; lyrics can be saved in two ways in a piece of music . some pieces use copy@@ ri@@ ght@@ ness , others use lyrics and others both . some pieces have no text at all : - ) &quot;
&quot; in &amp; k@@ mid , you can adjust which events are to be displayed and even better : the event type is automatically determined that a song is used , so you will automatically select the kar@@ aoke text . however , you still have the possibility to change this if you want to see the other way . &quot;
&quot; if you want to set an event type , select the entries from the Settings menu . the same function also has the keys 1 and 2 . &quot;
&quot; a collection is a list of MIDI files , which you can summar@@ ize . these are played after the series . in this section , how you can use collections efficiently . &quot;
&quot; to create a collection , first open the collection manager . you will find this in the menu collection under the item Organ@@ ize ... Click New and enter the name for the collection . &quot;
you can also copy an existing collection by clicking on Copy and then specify the name for the new collection . this collection will contain the same songs as the original one .
&quot; if you have more than one collection , you can set the selected items in the collection manager . &quot;
&quot; in the temporary collection , all the songs you don &apos;t want to add to any other collection . &quot;
&quot; when using the application , this collection is not saved . remember that if you add lots of pieces . &quot;
&quot; to add songs to a collection , it must be selected in the collection manager . &quot;
a second method to add a song depends on setting automatic adding to the collection .
&quot; when automatic adding to the collection is enabled , a piece will be added automatically to the active collection when opening ( using File Open or Dra@@ g &amp; Drop ) . &quot;
&quot; when Automati@@ cally add to the collection , the temporary collection is activated and emp@@ tied when opening a piece . this collection will then be added to the remaining pieces . &quot;
&quot; to remove a song from a collection , you need to open the collection manager , select the collection and the desired song and then click Rem@@ ove . &quot;
&quot; you can select the order in which the songs are played . if you select the sequence from the sub @-@ menu of the menus collections , the songs are played in the order as they were added to the collection . &quot;
&quot; if you add or remove songs or select random order in the menu , the order is re@@ defined . &quot;
&quot; to play a song , select it in the collection manager , or use the selection list above the kar@@ aoke text . &quot;
&quot; to ski@@ p a song further , select the Next song button , the entry next song from the menu piece , or press the arrow on the right . &quot;
&quot; to reverse a song back , select the button Previous piece , the entry Previous piece from the menu piece , or press the arrow left . &quot;
&quot; to delete a collection , open the collection manager , select the collection and click the Del@@ ete button . &quot;
&quot; the temporary collection cannot be deleted . however , this doesn &apos;t matter because it is not stored when leaving &amp; k@@ mid . &quot;
&quot; this is absolutely necessary for synthes@@ izer , which are not General MIDI @-@ capable . in this case , the MIDI @-@ Map translat@@ es general MIDI events into events that the synthes@@ izer understands . &quot;
&quot; for example , you can create a MIDI map that conver@@ ts all the events of the type Change patch to B@@ right Piano in events of the Change patch to Tr@@ ump@@ et type , and thus always lets you see a trumpet if originally a piano should play . &quot;
&quot; if you only have a sound card , you do not need MIDI @-@ Map because all sound cards GM are compatible ( incl . A@@ we - and G@@ US cards , FM units and so on ) . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , there are no programs to create MIDI maps . so you need to edit the appropriate file from hand ( with your favorite editor ) . &quot;
a MIDI map is a text file that stores all necessary replac@@ ements for playing a piece .
&quot; each section may only appear once , except the Key@@ map section , which may appear as often as desired . however , every appearance has a different tex@@ ti@@ d ( see below ) . &quot;
define PAT@@ CH@@ MAP ... EN@@ D define Key@@ map &quot; Name of Key@@ map ... &quot; EN@@ D define Key@@ map &quot; A further Key@@ map ... &quot; EN@@ D OP@@ TION@@ S ... EN@@ D
see that define is needed to show that a section begins ( except for OP@@ TION@@ S ) and EN@@ D that the end of a section is reached .
&quot; please send me your map file as an email , so that I can offer in future versions of &amp; k@@ mid ; support can provide for devices that are not General MIDI compatible . &quot;
this section describes how the patches of General MIDI are displayed on your specific keyboard . general use looks like this :
&quot; please note that the left side of the equ@@ ator is ignored . it is assumed that the GM patches are in the correct order ( from 0 to 127 ) , so you must not change the order and leave no line for one of the 128 instruments . &quot;
&quot; the optional All@@ Key@@ s@@ To M is used to place all the sounds that this instrument needs to put on the sound with the number M . if your keyboard is not supported for example ( GM Patch 127 ) , you can take a drum ( e.g. with sound 60 ) that sounds similar to a gun shot . &quot;
&quot; so if a MIDI file is supposed to play a note with Patch 127 ( bullet shot ) , it takes patch 100 ( the drum on your keyboard ) and plays the sound 60 , regardless of which sound is in the MIDI file . &quot;
&quot; please note that here is meant with the term drum patch of the patch , with which each tone represents another perc@@ us@@ sion@@ ist instrument ( drum , cy@@ mb@@ al , mar@@ ac@@ as &amp; etc ; ) and not the one with which the sound means the pitch of the always same drum ( as some key@@ boards possess ) . &quot;
the Key@@ map section is used to indicate how sounds are displayed on a particular channel or instrument . use is :
&quot; as with the PAT@@ CH@@ MAP section , the sequence of lines is very important as well as their presence . so you have to create 128 entries . &quot;
you can define several key@@ maps for each channel and instrument . you only have to use different names in the first line .
key@@ maps are mainly used to map sounds on the perc@@ ussions channel . look for example the included key@@ maps .
&quot; this section can be used to map some channels to others . for example , if you want to s@@ wap the first and second channel , simply make it in the CHAN@@ N@@ EL@@ MAP section . &quot;
&quot; however , these settings are useful for key@@ boards which have the percussion on a particular channel ( General MIDI on channel 10 , others need the channels 16 or 9 ) . &quot;
&quot; Midi devices need 16 channels , the CHAN@@ N@@ EL@@ MAP section has 16 lines , numbered from 0 to 15 , based on the following pattern : &quot;
&quot; if you use the Key@@ map option , the Key@@ map will be used with the name name for this channel . if you use the For@@ ce@@ Patch option , all events will be ignored to change the patch on this channel . in this case , patch x is always used . &quot;
&quot; for example , the For@@ ce@@ Patch option can be useful in order to always use the perc@@ ussions patch on the perc@@ ussions channel . &quot;
&quot; the value for Pit@@ ch@@ Ben@@ der@@ R@@ atio indicates in which ratio Pit@@ ch @-@ Ben@@ der events are multip@@ lied . so if a MIDI file sends a pitch @-@ benefit event with the value n , this is converted with the n * ( r / 40@@ 96 ) and then for@@ warded . the value 40@@ 96 is used to avoid dec@@ im@@ al comm@@ a in the map file . &quot;
&quot; this setting is needed because GM speci@@ fies that a keyboard , which will play a pitch @-@ benefit event with the value 40@@ 96 , to play a sound higher . unfortunately , try some key@@ boards to play two tones up to an oc@@ ta@@ ve . to find the right value on your keyboard , you need to try a bit with &amp; k@@ mid . &quot;
&quot; to use a MIDI map , just open the dialog MIDI settings . this can be found in the menu under Settings , Point MIDI settings . &quot;
&quot; the channel view is a window with a whole series of keyboard ( one for every MIDI channel ) . on these key@@ boards , you see which sounds are being played . &quot;
&quot; you can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a particular channel . for each channel , there is a selection list where you can select an instrument . if you have changed an instrument , the button sh@@ ines no longer green but red to indicate that no longer the original instrument is used . &quot;
the channel view has ( up to now ) two different views to display the played sounds . view the view in the Settings menu below the point Channel view : settings
&quot; the speed LCD shows the speed , with which a song is played . the higher the number , the greater the speed . &quot;
&quot; you can change the tempo of a song . so , for example , if you find a song too fast to follow the text , you can slow it down . to change the tempo , use the arrows to the left and right of the LCD . &quot;
&quot; a MIDI file is a file containing information about how to play a piece of music . it contains notes , rhythm , speed , &amp; etc . &quot;
&quot; well , I can &apos;t force anyone to use &amp; k@@ mid ; but a typical MIDI file needs about 50 KB , while an mp3 file needs 4 MB ( a compression ratio of 1 : 80 ) and with a good synthes@@ izer you can also change the individual instruments , the speed &amp; etc . you have control over everything . &quot;
&quot; this can happen if you have a binary distribution ( rpm , de@@ b ) from &amp; k@@ mid ; that &apos;s because &amp; k@@ mid ; compiled without AW@@ E support . to eliminate the problem you need to download and install a distribution distribution ( for example from k@@ mid ; &apos;s home page ) &quot;
&quot; I want to add a whole folder to a collection , but I don &apos;t want to add all files individually . &quot;
&quot; agree to support &amp; k@@ mid ; drag &amp; drop . just open the folder you want to add in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; , select all the files and drag them to the &amp; k@@ mid ; window . &quot;
&quot; before , enable automatic addition to the collection . otherwise , the files will be added to the temporary collection . &quot;
you can press the arrow key on the left of the Tem@@ po@@ - LCD to slow playback . to restore the default tempo you can double click on the LCD .
&quot; I have a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Desktop , a &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ windows with my MIDI folder and &amp; k@@ mid ; on this desktop ( if I want to play a MIDI file ) or I want to play a file , simply switch to the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; window and drag the required file into the window of &amp; k@@ mid ; &quot;
&quot; if you just want to listen to a file quickly without adding them to a collection , turn off automatic adding to the collection , and the new one ; file will be added to the temporary collection . open files &quot;
&quot; let &apos;s assume you have the MIDI files A.@@ mid , B.@@ mid and C.@@ mid@@ . first you just want to play the first file . so , you set the setting automatic adding to the collection and open A.@@ mid@@ . your temporary collection then contains exactly this one MIDI file . &quot;
then decide to play B.@@ mid and C.@@ mid and create a collection with all three files . how do you do that ?
&quot; these people have sent me MIDI files or post@@ cards . thank you so much ! if I listen to these songs or see the postcard , it anim@@ ates me , further to &amp; k@@ mid ; to program . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mid ; was written by &amp; Antoni@@ o.@@ Lar@@ ro@@ sa@@ .@@ Jim@@ en@@ ez ; from Ma@@ acute ; laga ( Spain ) . I am studying mathematics at the University of Ma@@ acute ; I try to take a little time for my hob@@ bies , but I try to take a bit of time . as hob@@ bies , I have programming , collecting MIDI files , making music and pro@@ positions . &quot;
&quot; if you want to know where to download MIDI / Kar@@ aoke files if you have a question , an error or an idea for an extension of &amp; k@@ mid ; or even if you want to make me happy , write an e @-@ mail : lar@@ rosa @ k@@ de@@ .org or ant@@ lar@@ r @ ar@@ rak@@ is.@@ es &quot;
&quot; if you send me a postcard from your residence or a MI@@ DI@@ - / Kar@@ aoke file from a local group . if you send me a postcard or a MIDI file , I &apos;ll get in touch with friends of &amp; k@@ mid . &quot;
I have &amp; k@@ mid ; written entirely in my spare time and I don &apos;t want to get money from anyone . I would like to emphasize that I am only interested in program@@ mi@@ ere because / when I get feedback from users ( post@@ cards or e @-@ mails ) .
Tak@@ ashi I@@ wa@@ i and Joseph H. Büh@@ ler - corrected the defect that the pitch was too high at AW@@ E cards .
&quot; thanks also to Jose L@@ us San@@ che@@ z for testing the G@@ US support , Ign@@ acio Gar@@ cia , for testing the AW@@ E support , H@@ as Pet@@ ter Bi@@ ek@@ er , Peter Gr@@ it@@ sch , Magn@@ us Pfeffer , Ur@@ ko L@@ usa , Peter @-@ Paul Witt@@ a , Thor@@ sten Wes@@ thei@@ der , Ulrich Cor@@ des and anyone who sent me a patch , an error message or even a suppor@@ tive email . &quot;
and of course my thanks also applies to all these excellent musicians on the net that give us these wonderful MI@@ DI@@ - and kar@@ aoke files .
&quot; in addition to this , &amp; k@@ mid ; also found on his homepage , which is located at http : / / www.@@ ar@@ rak@@ is.@@ es / ~ r@@ lar@@ rosa / k@@ mid@@ .html . you can also find links to pages with other kar@@ aoke songs , &amp; etc ; &quot;
a sound card . I recommend you a good sound card or an external synthes@@ izer because the sound quality depends essentially on your sound card . it &apos;s not the same whether you use a FM radio or an AW@@ E card .
&quot; if you do not have a sound@@ card , you need to compile &amp; k@@ mid ; compile with the MO@@ DE _ DE@@ MO _ ON@@ LY@@ VIS@@ U@@ AL parameter . it runs as if you would have a sound@@ card , except that you can &apos;t hear music of course . &quot;
&quot; if problems occur , contact one of the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Mail@@ ing lists or send an error message directly to me . &quot;
&quot; &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; is a simple interface for M@@ Player , Phon@@ o and ff@@ m@@ peg . the program is used to play video files supported by M@@ Player or Phon@@ on supported formats , as well as playback of DVD s , V@@ CD s , or TV and camera . &quot;
the documentation for &amp; k@@ app@@ name ; was not yet finished than &amp; k@@ de ; installed on this computer .
&quot; for additional help please check the page The K@@ DE website on new versions , or send the question to The &amp; k@@ de ; User Mail@@ ing list . &quot;
&quot; the application window is made of so @-@ called and@@ o@@ ck@@ able windows . there is always the window with the central view . optionally , there is a window with the playlist . and finally there is an information window that will only appear when information is displayed . &quot;
&quot; if you want to create a list of entries that are played after each other , you should use the category of permanent play@@ lists . &quot;
&quot; of course , you can add groups to groups to get an additional hierarch@@ ical level . if you anc@@ akes up an entry , its group and all its sub @-@ groups are copied to the current category and playback begins with the attached item . &quot;
&quot; the categories &apos; up @-@ to @-@ date pieces &apos; , television and permanent play@@ lists can also be changed by editing the XML configuration files . of course , you can only do it if &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; you can click on a name of a category , select it from the View menu and select next edit mode . by clicking on a sub@@ group only the XML content of this section is displayed . &quot;
&quot; after changing XML files , you have to choose the same playlist from the menu and select either the edit mode , or select another category . &quot;
all changes are lost when the edit mode is left or another group is selected without the same as the playlist .
&quot; as a result of the convenience of the author of &amp; K@@ M@@ Player , some functions can only be enabled by changing XML configuration files . &quot;
&quot; the animation for starting and ending can be disabled by editing ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / km@@ play@@ err@@ c and modify &#91; General Options &#93; No in@@ tro = 0 ob@@ iger option to &apos; 1 &apos; . if the option is not present , it can be inserted easily . &quot;
it is also possible to activate another animation . &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; will note the files ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / K@@ M@@ Player / intro@@ .@@ xml and ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / K@@ M@@ Player / ex@@ it@@ .@@ xml . the format must be a supported XML file .
&quot; the animation during startup doesn &apos;t need to be short , it is automatically termin@@ ated by opening another source . however , this would be anno@@ ying during the end @-@ animation , the user can therefore finish the application a second time . &quot;
a simple example of a start animation can be the display of a favorite picture : &amp; lt ; body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp;
there is a tab for configuration of M@@ Player in the &amp; K@@ M@@ Player configuration dialog ; here you can set the path from the M@@ Player and the cache size of the data stream from the network and other things .
another tool for troubleshooting is the button &apos; console &apos; in the tool@@ bar of K@@ M@@ Player . here is the output of m@@ player visible .
&quot; there is no tab@@ s for this ren@@ own in the &amp; K@@ M@@ Player configuration dialog ; everything must be configured by manual editing of ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / km@@ play@@ err@@ c , like setting the back@@ end via mim@@ et@@ ype . here &apos;s an example of how a &apos; flash &apos; is played with the sw@@ f@@ dec @-@ mo@@ z@@ illa module : &quot;
&apos;@@ Flash &apos; can be played within &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; it can even be inserted the special field em@@ bed for YouTube in the playlist XML .
&quot; in order for the &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; &apos; flash &apos; can be played in HTML pages , the &amp; K@@ M@@ Player must be specified as service provider for the M@@ ime type application / x @-@ sho@@ ck@@ wave @-@ flash in the setup dialog file assignment of K@@ DE . &quot;
&quot; the Kon@@ quer@@ or or &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; is to start in a console application and search for error messages regarding loading the browser module library . if there are no errors , the back@@ end output is within &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; ( view , console , or console from the context menu ) . &quot;
&quot; thus always a given back@@ end for a particular m@@ ime type is taken ( of course only if this is also determined ) , this must be done by manually alter@@ ing the file ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / km@@ play@@ err@@ c . for example , phon@@ on should return all og@@ g files : &quot;
&quot; &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; can play from TV cards , either using M@@ Player or X@@ Video ( this needs k@@ x@@ v@@ player ) . before TV can be st@@ owed , the device must be used to use the device and the TV channels . to do so , the scanner can be used from the configuration dialog , or the configuration file can be edited manually . &quot;
&quot; to configure the V@@ DR ( video data recorder ) settings in the K@@ M@@ Player is the dialog in the settings under - &gt; Qu@@ el@@ le@@ - &gt; V@@ DR@@ - &gt; X@@ Video port . there should be detected ports from which one is selected ( e.g. , it is PAL for West Europe ) , the correct name probably has a DV@@ B included in it . &quot;
&quot; since the V@@ DR support of K@@ M@@ Player can only use X@@ video , X@@ video should also work ( probably this type of playback of video devices under Linux is the only one that works ) . for this reason , the video@@ con@@ linux extension for the X server must be included in its configuration file ( / etc / X@@ 11 / XF@@ 86@@ Con@@ fig ) &quot;
&quot; internally , K@@ M@@ Player uses different names for the sources . at the time of creating this documentation , this is dv@@ d@@ nav@@ source , dv@@ d@@ source , ex@@ it@@ source , pi@@ p@@ es@@ our@@ ce , tv@@ scanner , TV@@ Source , ur@@ l@@ source , v@@ cd@@ source and v@@ dr@@ source . &quot;
are there any hints how to make my CD@@ ROM drive qui@@ eter when I play from it ( not from the V@@ CD : / / ) ?
&quot; yes , the command h@@ d@@ par@@ m -@@ E 8 / dev / c@@ drom can be done as user root after installing the device . it is absolutely certain to make sure that / dev / c@@ drom on the CD@@ ROM drive shows . &quot;
&quot; x@@ ine only starts up slowly , why does my CPU have to be tested for performance every time ? &quot;
&quot; note : the answer is over@@ hau@@ . k@@ x@@ ine@@ player automatically needs the last saved value , only the first time x@@ ine will check the CPU . &quot;
&quot; sort , rotate , res@@ ize images &quot;

Q@@ T ; : &amp; Q@@ t ; is a C + + library for creating graphical user interfaces and network support and is needed to compile &amp; K@@ ile .
latex ; : a professional typ@@ ing application . under Unix @-@ like systems it is likely to be used on the package &amp; tex@@ live ; or &amp; tet@@ ex ; ( for older systems ) .
most of these components can be included in the used &amp; Linux ; distribution should be included in the distribution or installation CD ; / DVD documentation .
the &amp; K@@ ile ; -@@ Project contains some pre @-@ compiled packages of &amp; K@@ ile ; for various distri@@ butions . these enable easy installation without further comp@@ iling and are included on the K@@ ile ; website .
&quot; this manual is for everyone - regardless of the experience with &amp; Lat@@ est ; , &amp; k@@ de ; , &amp; K@@ ile ; or &amp; Linux ; . &quot;
&quot; advanced users don &apos;t have to read this manual . however , all suggestions for documentation are taken into account . if the support for this project or its documentation is desired , contact via the K@@ ile ; website should be made . &quot;
&quot; if you have any questions or if you wish to compile &amp; K@@ ile ; if requested , this should be addressed to the mail mailing list K@@ ile @-@ de@@ vel @ list@@ s.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net . &quot;
&quot; &amp; K@@ ile ; is an integrated &amp; Lat@@ ex ; -@@ environment for the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Desktop . &amp; K@@ ile ; offers the possibility to use all &amp; latex ; -@@ functions in a graphical interface and within this a simple , immediate and bes@@ po@@ ke access to all &amp; latex ; -@@ programs . finally , the easy to operate assistant , the &amp; latex ; reference and powerful project management . &quot;
&quot; to learn more about &amp; k@@ ate ; and to know its possibilities , the hand@@ book should be drawn to Kate . users of &amp; K@@ ile ; can begin directly with reading the chapter &apos;s works with the editor of &amp; k@@ ate ; begin . &quot;
&quot; for &amp; Lat@@ ex ; is the right expression : L@@ ay @-@ TECH . during the original &amp; tex ; difficult to use , also an av@@ ie ( engl@@ . lay ) &amp; latex ; -@@ mac@@ ros can also be used . a less demanding but more realistic explanation is that it deri@@ ves from the sur@@ name of Les@@ lie La mp@@ ort . &quot;
&quot; for example H. Kop@@ ka / P. W. D@@ aly , A Guide to &amp; Lat@@ est ; : document Prepar@@ ation for Beg@@ inners and Advanced Users , 3rd Edition , 1999 d@@ af@@ Ã ¼ r . &quot;
&quot; the introduction contains at least the command \ \ command class , the Cologne command begins with the command \ \ begin { document } and must be closed again with the command \ \ begin { document } . &quot;
the quick entry assistant of &amp; K@@ ile ; is a useful feature for quick preparation of a document in &amp; c@@ ile ; the selection of the wiz@@ ard ( menu ) offers some options for creating the document . it can also be done some on the document related settings .
&quot; documentation classes : this explains the type of document to be created : article ( article ) , book &#91; book &#93; , letter &#91; letter &#93; , report &#91; letter &#93; , article ( DIN ) &#91; sc@@ r@@ re@@ pr@@ t &#93; , book ( DIN ) &#91; sc@@ r@@ re@@ pr@@ t &#93; , projector &#91; dot &#93; , films &#91; Prosp@@ er &#93; or custom . &quot;
coding : with this the character enco@@ ding is set . modern systems are increasingly using UT@@ F @-@ 8 enco@@ ding as standard . if UT@@ F @-@ 8@@ X should be washed ( for correct processing of &amp; latex ; -@@ Documents ) .
&quot; this list contains the most commonly used accessory packages for &amp; Lat@@ ex ; . for inclusion , they merely have to be selected in the check box . &quot;
&quot; article ( DIN ) , book ( DIN ) , report ( DIN ) , letter ( DIN ) : the documentation classes of KO@@ MA @-@ Script ( for compliance with German DIN regulations ) . &quot;
new users don &apos;t have to worry about it . it is just a short description of the functions and further information on this will be given in the section .
&quot; &amp; K@@ ile ; offers - just like other source editors - the high@@ lighting of the used commands , settings and elements ( as well as the un@@ suitable ) . &quot;
&quot; when entering a new command ( e.g. \ \ begin { command } ) by &amp; K@@ ile , an automatic command ( e.g. \ \ end { command } ) will automatically generate a blank line ( e.g. \ \ end { command } ) . this function can be set in the Batch Setup ... La@@ TeX commands are disabled . &quot;
all documents are usually divided into some elements . &amp; Lat@@ est ; allows the sub@@ division of the document into the following elements ( part is the lowest and sub@@ paragraph the bottom element ) :
&quot; in view of the document in the structure view , the individual elements can be changed and viewed by a mouse click . &quot;
&quot; when creating your own &amp; Lat@@ ex ; files can be very helpful . once a DVI file has been created , jumps &amp; c@@ ile ; by a click with the middle mouse button in the DVI ; -@@ viewer to the corresponding line in &amp; latex ; -@@ sourc@@ ec@@ ode . &quot;
&quot; a DVI file contains a description of the form@@ atted document and other information such as font and is beside PDF the usual output of &amp; tex ; or &amp; latex ; . there are many tools for viewing , converting and printing DVI ; files for various systems and devices . &quot;
&quot; when using the back search , the elements of the DVI ; file are cli@@ cked with the editor and as soon as you cli@@ cked on an element in the DVI ; file , the exact opposite of it . as soon as to a section in the &amp; latex ; -@@ source text is cli@@ cked , the corresponding position is cli@@ cked in the DVI ; -@@ viewer . &quot;
master Document : this function is used for working with multiple files . with a Master Document the work with other integr@@ at@@ .@@ tex files is simplified . when using a project a project @-@ wide master document can be set to project project settings .
quick construction : the &amp; Lat@@ est ; -@@ sourc@@ ec@@ ode is compiled and the result is automatically displayed ( if there are no errors in the source code ) .
&quot; surveillance : in this mode , the DVI @-@ file will be called &quot; &quot; open &quot; &quot; and there is no call of &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; after the quick construction . &quot;
&quot; when viewing the Edit tool bar , the three large number of sel@@ ections should be noticed . the selection fields have been developed for fast inser@@ tion of common elements into the document . the first drop @-@ down field is for quick classification of the document into parts , chapters , sections ... &quot;
&quot; the Show more is available for inser@@ ting items such as keywords , joints or references . the available options are : &quot;
&quot; name : with this command , a name for a section , a picture or other element is created . &quot;
cover : is used for reference to a specified term ( select a selection box for possible ) .
&quot; when using quotation , a drop @-@ down list is displayed with literary inser@@ ts . at &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex , this works only if the file belongs to a project . for editing &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; files are appropriate editors . the author has good experiences with &amp; k@@ bi@@ b@@ tex ; and &amp; k@@ bi@@ b ; files can also be written in &amp; c@@ ile . &quot;
&quot; the last drop @-@ down field named &quot; &quot; Gr@@ Ã ¶ Ã ¶ e &quot; &quot; is used for defining the written signature . &quot;
&quot; when calling &amp; K@@ ile , two choices are available : 1 . the wiz@@ ard for creating a new document by selecting the document type and setting the settings . 2 . the document can be written by reason on hand . &quot;
&quot; the brackets after the command \ \ document@@ class contain the settings for the command . setting &#91; 12@@ pts &#93; sets the font size . if the font size is not specified at the beginning , this can also happen later in the text . &quot;
&quot; once the above source sample has been entered , the &amp; Lat@@ est ; -@@ source code must be compiled . the simpl@@ est way to do this is the use of men@@ ue construction or button@@ ed quick construction . &quot;
the source code must be stored before comp@@ iling . &amp; K@@ ile ; automatically saves the storage .
&quot; if the comp@@ iling of the document fails , it should be searched for errors . when using quick @-@ construction should &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece should be started . if this is not the case , the logging should also be followed . &quot;
&quot; the command \ \ begin { environment } , \ \ begin { environment } , \ \ Hu@@ ge and \ \ end { environment } results in the integration of the characters within the environment &quot; &quot; Hu@@ ge &quot; &quot; ( English Hu@@ ge ) . &quot;
&quot; the changes are reserved only within the environment ( from \ \ begin { environment } up to \ \ end { environment } ) . there is no limit ( number ) for the changes in an environment . &quot;
&quot; there are many possibilities to increase the read@@ ability and us@@ ability of the document . for example , certain fon@@ ts , fat printing , intensive pressure , sub@@ missions , etc. are added . these commands end either with the command \ \ end or automatically at the end of the environment . &quot;
\ \ begin { emp@@ h } : this command is for the cur@@ sive expression and is valid until it is closed with a \ \ end { emp@@ h } or another environment . a single word in one sentence may be ital@@ ically displayed with \ \ emp@@ h { word } .
\ \ quot@@ a : creates a quote in the document . the quote starts with \ \ begin { ratio } and ends with \ \ end { ratio } .
&quot; after the background for writing the source code with the &amp; Lat@@ ex ; mark@@ up language is displayed , now follows a step @-@ by @-@ step guide for creating a document in &amp; c@@ ile . &quot;
&quot; as soon as in the wiz@@ ard a bit of text was entered , a few adjustments for the better read@@ ability of the document should be completed . &quot;
&quot; once the document has been viewed , it can be returned to the editor using the editor view or C@@ trl E ( internal viewer ) . &quot;
&quot; once the DVI file has been created , the document can be printed out or converted to a &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF file . simply try and have fun . &quot;
DVI ; is an independent file format ( D e V ice I n@@ dependent ) . these files are created by &amp; tex ; or &amp; latex ; for read@@ ability of some drivers of the computer . there are many different types of .@@ d@@ vi output such as printer , &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF -@@ converting or computer screens . &quot;
&quot; for printing a &amp; DVI file , the same steps as for the creation of the document are necessary ( see ) . at the 7th step - after clicking on DVI , the document can then be printed by printing ( in the viewer ) ( if the printer is set correctly ) . &quot;
&quot; the tool@@ bar allows the conversion of the DVI ; file to other formats . as soon as the DVI ; file from the &amp; latex ; -@@ sourc@@ ec@@ ode was created , the conversion can begin using the buttons in the tool@@ bar . &quot;
the pre @-@ selection allows the direct jump from the editor to the associated position inside the DVI ; file .
&quot; &amp; K@@ ile ; Provi@@ des a corresponding setting for all &amp; Lat@@ ex ; -@@ Bin@@ dings . to do this , merely furnis@@ h Modern under Settings K@@ ile ... Tools will be selected . &quot;
&quot; to select the preferred search , the mouse poin@@ ter must be cli@@ cked in a line of the source code and then cli@@ cked on pre @-@ select search . the jump to the appropriate place in DVI ; the viewer takes place immediately . &quot;
with this function in &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; is opened with a click of the middle mouse button in the DVI ; document the corresponding &amp; Lat@@ est ; -@@ P@@ ut document from &amp; K@@ ile ; to be defined as text editor ( setting settings ey@@ epi@@ ece ... editor )
&quot; should an error occur when using the quick construction of the &amp; DVI ; if an error is present , this is displayed in the log file or in the message window . &quot;
the log file distri@@ butes the source of errors in the source code . in the editor you can use the La@@ TeX @-@ Error and N@@ Ã ¤ ch@@ ster La@@ TeX @-@ errors for jumps between errors . to view the faul@@ ty line must be cli@@ cked on the error in logging and &amp; K@@ ile ; jumps to the faul@@ ty line .
&quot; when cli@@ cked on the corresponding button in the tool@@ bar , a window appears to select the template to be used for the document . &quot;
&quot; if you select empty document , a document can be written either from scratch or the wiz@@ ard for quick preparation of a new document . further information is included in the section . &quot;
&quot; top users of &amp; Lat@@ ex ; usually use the same introduction for almost all documents . templates can be built , saved and loaded to facilitate the creation of a new document . &quot;
&quot; to create a new template , either an existing &amp; tex ; - / latex ; file must be opened or created a new file . &amp; K@@ ile ; can create a new template by opening an existing document and selection of file template from document ... &quot;
&quot; when creating a new document from a template using File New , some strings are replaced by other data ( e.g. name or character enco@@ ding ) . these variables can be set up in Settings C@@ ile ... Settings . &quot;
&quot; when creating your own template , it is necessary to know which strings of which variables are sub@@ stituted : &quot;
&quot; $ $ DO@@ CU@@ MEN@@ T@@ LA@@ S@@ SO@@ P@@ TION@@ S $ $ : this string is replaced by typ@@ ing in documentation class . typically , it is used as follows : \ \ document@@ class &#91; $ $ DO@@ CU@@ MEN@@ TC@@ LA@@ S@@ SO@@ P@@ TION@@ S $ $ &#93; { article } . &quot;
&quot; the simpl@@ est way to create a template is the use of the wiz@@ ard and the associated input of the commands in the editor . once the document has been created in this way , the following steps have to be completed : &quot;
&quot; when creating a new document , the template can then be selected instead of default . &quot;
a template can be created from any &amp; latex ; files are created . a simple way to create a template should be searched for one on the Internet and searched for the steps described below .
&amp; K@@ ile ; used &amp; k@@ ate ; as internal editor . &amp; k@@ ate ; is a text editor for program@@ mers with the possibility of reading and reading of many different types of text files ( including &amp; Lat@@ ex ; and &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; ) . many settings for &amp; k@@ ate ; can be made in the Men@@ Ã ¼ Tool directly from &amp; K@@ ile ;
&quot; to learn more about &amp; k@@ ate ; and to experience his abilities , the hand@@ book should be drawn to Kate . users of &amp; K@@ ile ; can begin directly with reading the chapter &apos;s works with the editor of &amp; k@@ ate ; begin . &quot;
&quot; &amp; K@@ ile ; offers a very convenient &amp; latex ; -@@ command reference , which can be accessed from the La@@ TeX reference menu . it contains a detailed description of almost all commands , which can be used in &amp; latex , as well as their syntax . &quot;
double @-@ clicking with pressed C@@ trl key to select the &amp; tex ; word . this means that by clicking on \ \ par value \ \ par \ \ big@@ ski@@ p only \ \ par is selected .
&quot; when drag@@ ging the text with pressed left mouse button , the selected text is automatically copied to the clip@@ board . &quot;
when using the arrow keys with twi@@ sted Shift key you can select parts of the source code in the editing pane .
&quot; &amp; K@@ ile ; has the possibility to browse the most different types of source texts and emphasize these . for example , the &amp; Lat@@ est ; -@@ Comm@@ ands from normal text and also the mathematical form@@ ul@@ as are highlighted by a different color . &quot;
&quot; many wiz@@ ards can add additional spr@@ ints . this is a custom type of book@@ marks inside the text . the menu items are highlighted in the text , or the appropriate keyboard short@@ cuts the jump to the next or last spr@@ int mark . &quot;
&quot; editing is probably one of the main aspects when using a program such as &amp; K@@ ile ; although &amp; k@@ ate ; already excellent options , have been added in &amp; K@@ ile ; important functions for writing a &amp; Lat@@ est ; -@@ source code added ; special commands for their selection . &quot;
&quot; select a complete paragraph ( group of lines , which contain a blank line on both sides ) . with a paragraph , there is not a text with consistent lines ( like in other text editors ) . this advanced meaning is meant to create tables , &amp; latex ; commands and all other lines of the source code . &quot;
select the word below the current cur@@ sor position . this selection also has an extended meaning since this command also contains &amp; Lat@@ ex ; -@@ Comm@@ ands with a return line ( \ \ ) and an additional star ( * ) at the end .
&quot; to remove any part of the document , this can be selected first and removed by pressing the Del@@ ete key . &amp; k@@ ate ; offers the short@@ cut C@@ trl ; K with which the whole line is removed . &quot;
removes a complete paragraph . the definition for a paragraph in &amp; K@@ ile ; is contained in the description to Edit excer@@ pts paragraph .
&quot; it has already been clari@@ fied that environments play a central role in &amp; latex ; therefore , &amp; K@@ ile ; for further orders under the Edit environment for a possible simple work with &amp; latex ; . &quot;
&quot; with this command , jump to the beginning of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cur@@ sor is placed directly in front of the command to open the environment . &quot;
&quot; with this command , jump to the end of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cur@@ sor is placed directly behind the command to enter the area of the environment . &quot;
&quot; if the cur@@ sor is located before or inside the command \ \ begin { environment } , the end of the environment is spra@@ yed ( or vice versa ) . &quot;
&quot; when entering many inter@@ locking ambient commands , quickly the over@@ sight can be lost . this command prompt the last modified environment , so that the ne@@ sted environment structure will not be dissi@@ p@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; &amp; K@@ ile ; also offers special commands for the &amp; Lat@@ est ; -@@ groups , which are determined by par@@ enth@@ eses { ... } . under Edit TeX @-@ Group are some important commands that correspond to the Edit environment . &quot;
&quot; with this command , jump to the beginning of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cur@@ sor is placed directly in front of the polished clip . &quot;
&quot; with this command , jump to the end of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cur@@ sor is placed directly behind the cur@@ ly closing bracket . &quot;
&quot; if the cur@@ sor is located before or behind the cur@@ ly clip of a &amp; tex ; group # , the other end of the group is spra@@ yed ( or vice versa ) . &quot;
&quot; in the input of many ne@@ sted group@@ ed par@@ enth@@ eses , quickly the out@@ sider may be lost . this command prompt the last opened group , so that the ne@@ sted structure of the &amp; tex ; groups will not be dissi@@ p@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; Lat@@ ex ; two simple suits are used as guest use . for the purpose @-@ to @-@ use implementation is used in &amp; c@@ ile ; the sign &quot; &quot; uses &quot; &quot; two simple quotes . &quot;
this automatic inser@@ tion of double quotes can be set up under Settings K@@ ile ... La@@ TeX can be switched on and off .
you can also use len@@ tic@@ ular settings ( e.g. n@@ german or french ) and thus German or French ports . there are also many other languages available .
&quot; if the current position is located within a listen environment ( e.g. enum@@ er@@ ate or it@@ em@@ ize ) , &amp; K@@ ile ; not only a new@@ line but also the \ \ item command . &quot;
&quot; the current line with \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \
even better - &amp; K@@ ile ; is intelligent enough to support pre @-@ set &amp; latex ; - or custom environments . these can be filed under Settings K@@ ile ; set up by La@@ TeX .
&quot; some users want to arrange the columns in tables -@@ environments , and thereby all E@@ t characters ( amp ; ) to each other . while using Shift ; Alt ; amp ; seeks &amp; K@@ ile ; after the next tab@@ ulator is not the matching line , for the columns position of the current tab@@ lat@@ ator . &quot;
&quot; although &amp; k@@ ate ; already offers a good source code completion , it has been added in &amp; K@@ ile ; to add special commands ( usually for &amp; latex ; ) . three of them work on demand and the other two are for automatic adjustment . all these modes can be set up for different modes of assignment ... &quot;
&quot; when starting a new environment with the command \ \ begin { environment } , &amp; K@@ ile ; automatically add the command \ \ end { environment } after an empty line ( for the text ) . &quot;
&quot; when the return key is pressed , the last letter of the input will be removed and it is possible to increase the list . on the other hand , the list can also be reduced by entering another letter . &quot;
&quot; all commands are written with a short description of their parameters . the descriptions are naturally removed by selecting a command . alternatively , a jump to these positions is possible and the desired parameters can be desired . &quot;
under Settings K@@ ile ; set up ... K@@ ile ; you can make adjustments to these lists . it can be selected various W@@ Ã ¶ r@@ ter@@ lists for &amp; tex ; - and &amp; Lat@@ ex ; -@@ Comm@@ ands as well as W@@ Ã ¶ r@@ ter of the general language use .
&quot; command mode is not needed for the execution of environments . there are always a few letters with \ \ begin to be entered and the execution mode will result in a large open list with environmental commands . on the other hand , the environments are used so often that &amp; c@@ ile ; a special mode for completing the environments . &quot;
&quot; when calling the complete editing mode , or the Alt + Shift key space button , the command to open the environment automatically and it appears \ \ begin { . afterwards , the environment can be continued in the simpl@@ est way and by pressing the input key . &quot;
&quot; once this is completed , the environment will automatically be closed again . once &amp; K@@ ile ; realis@@ es that it is a list environment , even a first \ \ item command is filled with . &quot;
&quot; under Settings K@@ ile ; set up ... K@@ ile , you can make adjustments to these lists . this mode uses the list of full@@ screen mode for &amp; tex ; - and &amp; Lat@@ est ; -@@ Comm@@ ands . &quot;
&quot; for example , the ex@@ amp@@ le@@ .c@@ w@@ l file is used , for example , the file ex@@ amp@@ le@@ .c@@ w@@ l , in which the entry L = \ \ La@@ TeX is included . &quot;
&quot; for example , the letter L is entered and the word is completed in full @-@ scale editing or short@@ cut C@@ trl + Alt Emp@@ ty , the letter L is replaced by the string \ \ La@@ TeX . &quot;
&quot; big W@@ Ã ¶ r@@ ter@@ b@@ Ã ¼ cher are not helpful for automatic execution . however , it has been found that many W@@ Ã ¶ r@@ ters are written more than once in one document . &quot;
this mode can be set up in the Men@@ Ã ¼ Settings K@@ ile ... K@@ ile can be shut down . here you can also set the threshold value for the ad placement .
&quot; the file files can be installed in the sub@@ folder ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / K@@ ile / complete / mode / of the Per@@ s@@ Ã ¶ n@@ liche Home folder . mode is for abbrevi@@ ation ( check ) , dictionary ( W@@ Ã ¶ r@@ ter@@ buch ) or tex . &quot;
&quot; the dialog graphics are designed to create graphics as easy as possible . to view the basics of the graphics formats , the sections should be considered and considered . &quot;
&quot; PS files are not as known as PDF files , but offer an excellent basis for the changes and re@@ ordering of pages . if the PDF output is named , the pages can be re@@ arranged with a few &amp; Post@@ Script tools and then converted with ps@@ 2@@ pdf into a PDF file . &quot;
&quot; in order to be able to examine the results of the work , the source code must be compiled . all construction tools are group@@ ed group@@ ed in the menus created comp@@ iling , creating converting and creating view . &quot;
&quot; for comp@@ iling the source code for viewers like &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; or the more conversion can be used to use the short@@ cut Alt ; 2 . afterwards , the DVI ; file can be converted to a PS file via Alt ; 4 the DVI ; file can be viewed by Alt ; 5 the PS file . &quot;
&quot; when using the command fast construction , a viewer is normally called after comp@@ iling . if no in@@ bound viewer is used , a new window will open every time . &quot;
a new project will be asked about the Project New Project .... here the following information for the project will be asked :
&quot; when exec@@ uting the filename window , the relative path must be specified by the .@@ kil@@ ep@@ r project file . &quot;
the script function by &amp; K@@ ile ; allows the output of EC@@ MA@@ Script enco@@ des . the scripts can be managed through scripts in the vertical bar .
the API scripts are not yet finished and can be used in other versions of &amp; K@@ ile .
&quot; first , it must be said that the execution environment of the scripts in &amp; K@@ ile ; a system @-@ wide object ( = K@@ ile ) with the following methods has : &quot;
&quot; &amp; Lat@@ est ; is a fairly balanced system , in which the basic functions can be extended by a variety of additional packages . &amp; K@@ ile ; offers a lot of different aids to support users . &quot;
&amp; tet@@ ex ; and &amp; tex@@ live ; are supplied with many documents . it contains a documentation for the included packages and a further &amp; latex ; -@@ Reference .
&quot; this is not just a description of all programs ( but a few important pack@@ ets are described ) , but rather a full support manual for the &amp; Lat@@ est ; commands are included and is therefore ideal for searching for a specific format@@ ting . since it is a very large document , it will be divided into three important book@@ marks . &quot;
&quot; due to the amount of documents with those &amp; tet@@ ex ; / tex@@ live ; extra@@ di@@ ted , finding the right document is not always easy . as possible help offers &amp; tet@@ ex ; / tex@@ live ; the small application tex@@ doc@@ t@@ k , which contains a database with all documents and a graphical surface . &quot;
&quot; all documents are divided into categories and the biggest advantage is the search for parcel names or keywords . by &amp; K@@ ile , only the results are displayed . &quot;
double @-@ clicking with the mouse or pressing the space key will open the viewer for the document .
&quot; &amp; K@@ ile ; is a qu@@ el@@ lo@@ ff@@ ener and user @-@ friendly &amp; latex ; - / tex ; -@@ source code editor , which can be dr@@ illed on all systems with installed &amp; k@@ de ; - and Unix @-@ like systems . &amp; K@@ ile ; is also part of the Fink project , which makes &amp; K@@ ile ; also available on &amp; Mac ; with installed OS @-@ X. &quot;
&quot; many thanks to those who asp@@ ire to the continuation of the &amp; K@@ ile ; project and offer for many hours for the development of tools , which we can use all under consideration of the &amp; GNU ; license . &quot;

&quot; &amp; k@@ sig ; is a graphic editor to manage many different sig@@ natures for e @-@ mails . the sig@@ natures can be edited in the graphical user interface of &amp; k@@ sig ; . using the command line interface , you create random sig@@ natures or daily sig@@ natures from a list . this command line interface provides sig@@ natures for external email programs such as &amp; k@@ mail ; . &quot;
&quot; for random sig@@ natures , any signature from the signature file of &amp; k@@ sig ; read out . by many sig@@ natures with different quotes , styles and information , you can create your e @-@ mails varied and unique . &quot;
&quot; for daily sig@@ natures , the same signature from the signature file is read from &amp; k@@ sig ; for each day you use different sig@@ natures , as with random sig@@ natures you create unique e @-@ mails . &quot;
&quot; to create a new signature , select C@@ trl ; N file New . this gives you a lt ; empty signature ; in section Sig@@ natures , save it with C@@ trl ; S file save or click on the disk icon save . &quot;
&quot; you can create as many sig@@ natures as you like . then , you have a list of sig@@ natures for e @-@ mail programs such as &amp; k@@ mail ; whether you use e @-@ mails in private or professionally , there are always enough sig@@ natures . &quot;
&quot; to delete a signature , select it first and then remove it in the File menu or click on the icon with the red cross removal in the tool@@ bar . &quot;
&quot; open the dialog box . here you can select short commands for menu entries . to change a short command , select an action from the list . click the user button on the right and enter the new option by pressing the key or key combination . &quot;
&quot; for the use of &amp; k@@ de ; is &amp; k@@ de ; 3.5 required . to attach sig@@ natures to your e @-@ mails , you need a program such as &amp; k@@ mail ; or another program that can insert the signature text from the output of a command . &quot;
&quot; all stack items are listed here . the older the stack entry is , the lower is its frame number . see the example below . &quot;
&quot; by clicking on a call@@ stack entry in the shown list , the cur@@ sor will be placed in the main window to the corresponding line number of the corresponding file . &quot;

&quot; the version 3.2 of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; contains many new &amp; XML ; tools and functions . these tools are unique in their integration in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; all these tools are used as a surface and lib@@ x@@ ml@@ 2 and lib@@ x@@ s@@ lt as base . the combination results in fast , efficient , complete and productive tools . &quot;
&quot; everyone who has worked with the &amp; k@@ de ; documentation has done mein@@ pro@@ c and how outstanding it is . if we still need one piece , we give it a graphical interface ! no longer dependent on a terminal ; simply cli@@ cked and finished ! &quot;
&quot; this application expects an index@@ .@@ doc@@ book in the folder . if index@@ .@@ doc@@ book is in the wei@@ ghted work folder , then let the current work folder be checked . if not , then remove the selection of current work folders and enter the desired folder in the field of other folders . &quot;
output files are stored in the same folder as the source files . all previous &amp; HTML ; -@@ files are deleted every time if pro@@ c is started .
&quot; as already said , everyone who has worked on the &amp; k@@ de ; documentation has already worked , knows how helpful this application is . and with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; there is now a great graphical interface for it . &quot;
&quot; if the currently opened file index@@ .@@ doc@@ book is , then simply select the current folder . if not , then select the current folder and enter the folder where index@@ .@@ doc@@ book is to be found . &quot;
&quot; if it comes to an output on the screen , its file is er@@ ron@@ eous . please check the reported errors and try again . &quot;
&quot; if the file is already checked in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us , then the current file is simply cli@@ cked . if not , delete the tick on current file and select the file to be vali@@ dated using other file - file selection . &quot;
&quot; if you only want to know if the well @-@ formed file is well @-@ formed , click the Well @-@ formed check selection . &quot;
&quot; to use a &amp; DT@@ D ; specified in the &amp; XML ; file , select &amp; DT@@ D ; ( default ) , otherwise &amp; DT@@ D ; ( External ) and enter the place of the &amp; DT@@ D ; ( External ) and specify the location of the definition URI ; in file selection required . &quot;
yes , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; also has a &amp; X@@ SL ; processing tool ! this uses the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c tool from the lib@@ x@@ ml@@ 2 library . &quot;
&quot; should the file be selected in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; already selected , then release the current file . if not , remove the selection current file and select the file to be processed using the other file sel@@ ector file . &quot;
&quot; enter the name of the file , as the result should have named , and the file is normally stored in your home folder . &quot;
&quot; the plugins , the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; la@@ det , have with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; even possibly little to do . this makes the plug @-@ in system very powerful . &quot;
&quot; to install a plugin or a part , we start editing plugins with the Edit menu . this will open the following dialog : &quot;
this dialog allows you to manage all of the included plugins and add new ones . we describe each &amp; GUI ; element in it :
&quot; here you can enter the search path . when adding plug @-@ ins without a location , qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; this path to search the plug @-@ in . &quot;
often working on a project several people in a kind of hierarch@@ ical relationship to each other . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; supports the specification of team members and they can be configured with Shift ; F@@ 7 Project Project Properties dialog .
the name and email messages are self explan@@ atory . nick@@ name is the nick@@ name of the user and is used for unique identification .
&quot; one member may have several roles in the project , such as both team leaders and sub @-@ project leaders . &quot;
the user can choose from the list of team members who he is . this happens by searching the team member from the list and the button S@@ etze as supp@@ resses . the currently selected member ( their identity ) appears bold after you are : text .
nick@@ names and the setting of your own identity are important with regard to news and notes . see for further information on notes .
&quot; in addition to the overview of their team , there is another advantage by gathering the members of the team : it can be created an event for information on the team leaders when something specific happens . see for more information . &quot;
&quot; event actions are actions that are executed when something specific is done in the project . an example would be the recording of the opening and closing of the project so that later on , or sending a message when a file is backed up , or a script that plays a file into CV@@ S as soon as it is added to the project , etc ; &quot;
&quot; on the event configuration of the Shift ; F@@ 7 project project settings dialog , events can be created , edited and deleted . &quot;
an E@@ Mail will be sent to the add@@ res@@ sees selected in the recipient list . the address sat can be a team or sub@@ project leader .
comments are special comments in the documents . they differ from normal comments by the following things :
to input notes is simple . it can either be selected from the editor context menu or the @ ann@@ ot@@ ation keyword in a comment area followed by comment text .
&quot; notes can be sent to a certain member of the team . in this case , the syntax @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( nick@@ name ) or @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( roll ) , where nick@@ name of the introduced nick@@ name of the team member , should be given the appropriate domain or sub@@ project names as in the following examples below . &quot;
nick@@ names and roles names are independent of upper or lower case letters but spaces around the brackets and the names are invalid .
&quot; &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is a development environment for script and format@@ ting languages , which is DT@@ D agnos@@ tic and supports web @-@ based format@@ ting and script languages . &quot;
&quot; the settings are accessible via the Settings menu . here only about &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ specific settings are treated , a short description for the others can be found . &quot;
the settings can be set up by Settings Qu@@ anta ... This dialog covers some pages that are dealt with each other .
the behaviour of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; regarding tags including auto @-@ completion can be changed with it . the entries are :
&quot; large / Low @-@ definition of tags : large / Low @-@ case of automatically added tags . normal bulk / lo@@ wer@@ case means , the tags are inserted as described in the tag@@ XML files . &quot;
&quot; large / Lower case of attributes : large / lower case of automatically inserted attributes . normal bulk / lo@@ wer@@ case means , the attributes are inserted as described in the tag@@ XML files . &quot;
&quot; optional tags close : if checked , tags for which the closing tag is optional , this immediately after the &amp; gt ; inserted . &quot;
do not include optional tags : like above for all other tags with the exception of the simple tags .
&quot; automatically update the start and end tag : if enabled , the corresponding tag will be changed and vice versa . &quot;
automatic setting of acc@@ ent characters : controls the automatic conversion of acc@@ entu@@ ated characters into the corresponding enco@@ ding during ti@@ pping .
MI@@ ME types : mim@@ et@@ yp@@ es for detection of different types of files . reset button Standard can restore the default values .
&quot; standard drawing codi@@ fication : the coding of newly created or otherwise opened files ( where the enco@@ ding of the file can be ski@@ pped ) . however , this setting is ej@@ ected by the same in the project properties if a project is loaded . &quot;
&quot; standard DT@@ D : the selected DT@@ D is used for newly created files , or for files whose DT@@ D is not recognized . however , this setting is ej@@ ected by the same in the project properties if a project is loaded . &quot;
&quot; creating a backup copy : &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; creates regularly backup copies , so that in case of a power failure or crash during the next start of the program the document can be recovered from this backup . this is not the same as storing the file . &quot;
&quot; the preview and documentation can be displayed either in the editing pane or in an own view ( or documentation in a tab ) , which makes it possible to preview the documentation , preview and source code at the same time . &quot;
reset the default window settings back to the next start is useful when the user interface has passed through changing the M@@ DI Mo@@ di and and@@ o@@ cken / depend on views . it corresponds to the --@@ res@@ et@@ layout command line parameter .
the warning messages section serves the control of the possibility to un@@ check the display of war@@ nings by hooks of no more .
the place to change the behavior of &amp; V@@ PL ; it can define the display of symbols instead of scripts as well as synchron@@ izing behavior of the V@@ PL@@ - and source text view in shared mode .
&quot; here , the par@@ ser and the structure tree , which represents the representation of the par@@ ser no@@ des in the document , can be adjusted in details . &quot;
&quot; in the field of mouse click on the structure tree , the following action is possible to change the action triggered by clicking the structural tree using the mouse buttons . &quot;
&quot; in the Struc@@ tural Tree settings , the visibility of no@@ des in the tree , the update frequency of the tree to edit and how deep when changing the structure tree is to be opened automatically . empty no@@ des are empty areas in the text , while empty groups are those in which no element has been found in the current document . &quot;
&quot; abbrevi@@ ations are in groups , each can be valid for multiple &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; abbrevi@@ ations are in groups , each can be valid for several &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; this means there can be a valid group for PHP where the if@@ clause means something else than in a group valid for Javascript . &quot;
&quot; plug @-@ ins can be managed here . plug @-@ ins are part @-@ applications of third side , which can be re @-@ used by any part @-@ capable application , the most known &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; . when inser@@ ting a plug @-@ in , the following must be specified : &quot;
address : the path to the plugin if it is not at a default location like $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / lib .
&quot; input : this information is given to the plugin at startup , so it can open the current file , the associated folder ( path of the current file ) or the project folder . &quot;
&quot; in &quot; &quot; Read Only &quot; &quot; mode : check if the plugin fails to load the load . only read @-@ read @-@ parts usually refuse loading if this option is not selected . &quot;
&quot; check the plugin : if this is enabled , then test@@ et &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; , if the entered information is correct . choose the save of the entry even if the plugin is not available at the moment , but it should be installed later . &quot;
&quot; for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; from version 3.3 , troubleshooting has been completely re@@ developed . support for the no longer necessary built @-@ in &amp; PHP ; ( 3 ) Deb@@ ug@@ ger has been set , as well as support for the D@@ BG Deb@@ ug@@ ger . instead , a de@@ bu@@ gger plug @-@ in concept has been implemented that enables various implement@@ ations via plug @-@ ins . &quot;
&quot; currently , only one plugin is available , the support for the use of &amp; gu@@ bed ; inqu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; add . &quot;
the use of the de@@ bu@@ gger for a project starts with the selection of a suitable de@@ bu@@ gger plug @-@ in in the project settings . with the Options button next to the Deb@@ ug@@ ger plugin selection box the specific settings can be changed .
&quot; if a de@@ bu@@ gger is enabled for a project , some additional elements appear in the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; user interface : &quot;
a view shown in which the content of monitored variables is displayed . appears normally in the left dock .
&quot; a view in which all holding points , with line numbers and conditions are listed . usually appears in the bottom dock . &quot;
a view shown in the output ( as shown in HTML ) of the de@@ bu@@ gger . appears normally in the bottom dock .
&quot; depending on the supported functions of the de@@ bu@@ gger , everything or part of the following functionality is available . &quot;
&quot; with this action , the connection to the de@@ bu@@ gger , if necessary , is made , or it shares the plug @-@ in to listen to de@@ bug@@ ging requirements . this action is triggered by default when a project is opened , which needs a de@@ bu@@ gger , so that in normal cases it does not have to be taken care of . &quot;
the counter@@ part to Deb@@ ug@@ ging session starts the session . closes the connection to de@@ bu@@ gger or termin@@ ate listening to requirements .
sends a HTTP request to the server to initiate a de@@ bug request . this is syn@@ onymous with using a browser to view the current document . the output of this request is displayed in the Deb@@ ug@@ ger issue .
&quot; instruc@@ ts the de@@ bu@@ gger to start with the execution of the script and to send information about the monitored variables as well as the currently executed line . if this happens while the script is stopped , the execution will continue . if it is started , the script will start with the request . &quot;
&quot; instruc@@ ts the de@@ bu@@ gger to start exec@@ uting the script without sending information to monitored variables and the current line number . if this happens while a script is stopped , the execution will proceed . &quot;
the de@@ bu@@ gger performs the next instruction in the script without going into the functions or include .
&quot; the de@@ bu@@ gger performs the next instruction in the script , where possible if possible in functions and include . &quot;
&quot; instruc@@ ts the de@@ bu@@ gger to go over the instruction and go to the next one , as if there is not the current one . &quot;
opens a dialog where a variable or an expression can be entered . the monitored value appears in the variable view .
with this dialog a variable can be entered or a new value of a variable can be set .
&amp; k@@ x@@ s@@ l ; is a work of Keith Is@@ dale as well as this part of the documentation . &amp; k@@ x@@ s@@ l ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; front @-@ end and a part of x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g that can be found at http : / / x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g.@@ s@@ f@@ .net with many more works by Keith .
this chapter describes how you can adjust &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us to your needs and how you can help &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; help to get better .
&quot; document type Edi@@ ting Pack@@ ages ( D@@ TE@@ P ; s ) are used in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; to provide support for marker and scrip@@ ting languages and &amp; CSS ; they allow &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; their simplicity and flexibility makes from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; a fast , user @-@ friendly &amp; IDE ; for web developers , easy to use and productive . &quot;
&quot; tag folders contain two file types , the tag folder and the tool@@ bars . tag folders contain two file types , the tag folder and the tool@@ bars . tag folders contain two file types , the tag folder and the tool@@ bars . tag folders contain two file types , the tag folders and the tool@@ bars . tag folders contain two file types , the text and instructions faster in a document when a user could ever . &quot;
&quot; &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s can be created manually ( see below ) , downloaded or created automatically from an existing DT@@ D . see for details about conversion . &quot;
&quot; this document describes how tag@@ XML files are to be created , then the &amp; descrip@@ tion@@ rc ; and also tool@@ bars . in short , a &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; &quot;
&quot; Tag@@ XML files ( .@@ tag ) define both the specific attributes for tags and the layout and content of the Fe@@ atur@@ es@@ dialog , the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; file contains the rules and information of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; even . tool@@ bars allow a quick paste of tags in a document without any risk of writing failure . &quot;
&quot; tag folders are nothing but folders . they contain only the descrip@@ tion@@ rc ; and the Tag@@ XML files . tag folders carry the name of the descrip@@ tive language and version , so present . ( for example , html @-@ 4.0@@ 1 @-@ strict ) &quot;
&quot; the table below lists the elements of Tag@@ XML and declare whether they are necessary or not . although not all are necessary , it is advisable to use as many as possible so that other users will have a better view and more information at work with them . &quot;
the following chapter describes each element in detail . everything about possibilities and limitations will be explained in a simple manner .
&quot; this is the root element of a Tag@@ XML document . it can only occur once in a document . it can contain the definition of many tags , but contains as only element type over itself else . &quot;
the type of tags is a script function . when it is used &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; an argument of the function . ( only family 2 )
valid only for Tag@@ type class . the name of the base class for this class . ( only family 2 )
valid only for the type method . speci@@ fies the name of the class where this method belongs . ( only family 2 )
&quot; if yes , the day has a common attribute group and attributes within this tag can be added to any other day . ( only family 1 ) &quot;
sets a text into the dialog . this text is defined by the &amp; lt ; text &gt; tag . this is a only element type element .
describes an attribute of a tag . this element can only occur once for each attribute . it sets the name and type of attribute . additionally it contains other tags which describe how to display this attribute &amp; etc ; This is a only element type element .
&quot; returns the source code used to fill in the tag editing dialog , and attribute @-@ tree to the attribute &quot;
requires source = d@@ co@@ p . the d@@ co@@ p interface within &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is used to achieve the source data .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p and the name of an interface . the d@@ co@@ p method name within &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is used to achieve the data source .
&quot; requires source = d@@ co@@ p , a interface and a method name . the arguments passed to the method can be empty or % tag@@ Name % , which means the name of the current day . &quot;
a container tag that group@@ ed the elements of a list together . it can only happen once for an attribute description . it is a only element type element .
specify the position of the attribute text within a dialog . this tag can happen for each attribute in a dialog ( e.g. once for each &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; tag ) . the element is empty .
indicates the position and size of a field in the dialog . this tag should be present for each field in the dialog ( e.g. one for each &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; and &amp; lt ; label &gt; Tag ) . this item is empty .
speci@@ fies a list of elements that may occur within the tag . this element is a only element type .
returns a list of elements that end a day . this element is a only element type .
all Tag@@ XML files must start with a &amp; XML ; declaration : &amp; lt ; ? XML version = 1.0 enco@@ ding = UT@@ F @-@ 8 ? &gt; and need to be properly ch@@ ained and closed .
&quot; spaces influence nothing but pay attention to &amp; &amp; lt ; signs . these should be replaced by &amp; amp ; and &amp; lt ; , especially in elements like &amp; lt ; tool@@ tip &gt; , &amp; lt ; wh@@ ats@@ this &gt; , and &amp; lt ; wh@@ ats@@ this &gt; , and &amp; lt ; text &gt; will cause no leg change , but some pieces of work would disappear . &quot;
&quot; to check the Tag@@ XML files , the tools dialog above in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us is to start window and select Tag@@ X@@ M@@ L. . another dialog will appear to follow the simple instructions . &quot;
&quot; this function is currently not available . currently , the check is only available when loading the Tag@@ XML files in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; &quot;
in the following an example for a family 1 Tag@@ XML file . this file describes the &amp; lt ; schema &gt; element from the &amp; W3@@ C ; &amp; XML ; schema . the filename for this Tag@@ XML file should be schem@@ a.@@ tag .
&quot; in the following an example for a functioning family 2 Tag@@ XML file . in this file , a &amp; PHP ; over@@ load function is described . the filename of this Tag@@ XML file should be over@@ load@@ .@@ tag . &quot;
&amp; lt ; ? XML version = &quot; 1.0 &quot; enco@@ ding = &quot; UT@@ F @-@ 8 &quot; ? &gt; &amp; lt ; tag name = &quot; Over@@ load &quot; type = &quot; function &quot; re@@ turn@@ Type = &quot; void &quot; &gt; &amp; lt ; tag name = &quot; string &quot; status = &quot; optional &quot; / &gt; &amp; lt ; / tag &gt; &amp; lt ; / tags &gt;
&quot; the &amp; descrip@@ tion@@ rc file is just as simple and there is an editor for it , accessible via DT@@ D editing DT@@ D settings . this allows di@@ ed@@ es@@ crip@@ tion@@ rc ; for a newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; for a newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; should be created with the following entries : &quot;
&#91; general &#93; version = Use 1 for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; version &amp; lt ; = 3.@@ 1.2 and 2 for any higher version . name = DT@@ D specification . ( - / / W3@@ C ; / / DT@@ D HTML 4.0@@ 1 Transi@@ tional / / EN ) Nick@@ name = The simplified name of DT@@ D . ( HTML 4.0@@ 1 Transi@@ tional ) . if not specified the name is used as nick@@ name .
an action can be set up with settings actions ... click on New Action leads to the same dialog :
this action assigned button short@@ cuts . clicking the user &apos;s button can be assigned a short@@ cut short@@ cut ; with K@@ einer the current keyboard short@@ cut can be removed .
the simpl@@ est actions . it can be entered by a text in the settings and when exec@@ uting the action this text is inserted in the document at the current cur@@ sor position . see the example below .
&quot; this is the most powerful action type . with the help of this action , external applications ( usually scripts , but it is not limited ) that change the document or use it as input ( or parts of the document ) . examples from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; even are the Schnell@@ start -@@ Dialog or the various See in ... actions for the ( X ) HTML D@@ TE@@ Ps . &quot;
first the name of the script and the interpre@@ ter must be specified . example : SH / home / my@@ Home / my@@ Scrip@@ t.@@ sh .
&quot; although qualified paths are allowed , it is recommended to use the % scrip@@ t@@ dir variable in the command line , as sh % scrip@@ t@@ dir / my@@ Scrip@@ t.@@ sh@@ . In this way , the script tries to find : $ K@@ EN@@ HOME / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / scripts in their path : $ PAT@@ H There are other special variable that can be used in the command line : &quot;
% f : we are replaced with the URL of the current document . in case of a local document file : / from the document name is removed .
&quot; % pi@@ d : is replaced with PID of the current &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; only one instance runs , the text unique is attached to the PID number . this is useful when D@@ CO@@ P is used to control &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; it is used by the external script . &quot;
&quot; the parameters for this event , usually the filename of the current document or the path to the project file . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the methods listed above , a script input from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us can be specified in the default input . in the selection box , input can be determined , which is to be sent to the default input . &quot;
selected text : the selected part of the document is sent to the script . the % input variable is usually only useful with this setting .
&quot; according to the input , the output of the executed application can also be re@@ directed . there are two types of output : normal output , written to the standard output ; error messages , to the default output written text should be specified by setting the default text output : &quot;
&quot; if there are many tags in the Mark@@ up language , it is recommended to divide the tags into logical groups . it is necessary to create an own tool@@ bar for each group . in the given case , it is not too many , so you can create a tool@@ bar with the name of the market . &quot;
&quot; once a tool@@ bar is added , you need to add and configure actions . select Settings . &quot;
the parts of this window are pretty self explan@@ atory . press the new action button at the bottom of the window starts editing mode .
fill in all the necessary fields and add the day to the appropriate tool@@ bar .
&quot; complete everything and , if the day has attributes and you are planning their use , enable dialogue &quot; &quot; edit day &quot; , &quot; if available , so that an input is possible when using the action . &quot;
Ig@@ itt ! is this an ug@@ ly symbol . who should remember the action in connection with this symbol ? do we replace it before we have difficulty .
&quot; to create a symbol that the action represents better , we will use &amp; ki@@ con@@ edit ; choose from the &amp; K@@ Menu ; , Graphics more programs ( or where else it is located in their distribution ) . &quot;
&quot; &amp; ki@@ con@@ edit ; uses 3@@ 2x@@ 32 pixels by default , but we need 22@@ x@@ 22 . to change this , select Edit size . &quot;
&quot; please note that the created symbol does not only help you to remember what the action does , but also to all other users of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; &quot;
&quot; with a view that the day starts , I decided to create a start button as a symbol . by using green ( green is usually called off , star@@ te , further interpreted ) , or should at least be sign@@ aled a message to the user that clicking on this symbol is included ; to insert the tag in the current document . &quot;
&quot; after creating the symbol , it still needs to be connected to the action . this happens through the menu with settings actions ... ( in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; ) and selecting the desired action . next to the text box is a button , press it . &quot;
&quot; select the folder where the stored symbol is located , select it and confirm with OK . &quot;
&quot; press the user button and continue with other tags , so it still exists , or confirm with OK to complete . &quot;
&quot; suppose you want to add some usual &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; add functions to tool@@ bar , or you should adjust it to a better overview by some separ@@ ators into several groups . make sure the tool@@ bar chosen is selected . &quot;
&quot; after selecting the element which is to be added to the tool@@ bar , press the arrow key to the right . this adds the element to the tool@@ bar . &quot;
&quot; for example , I would like to have a quick way of accessing the Con@@ quer@@ or preview . I will select it and add to the tool@@ bar . &quot;
&quot; please note , how the separ@@ ators support the group@@ ing . someone who does not know my tool@@ bar could believe that the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ button is the opposite of the start button . &quot;
the new tool@@ bar must be tested by using all symbols to ensure that everything works .
&quot; after re@@ e@@ XML does not exist , it will be created in the proper folder , but your tool@@ bar ( s ) should be stored in the proper folder , so that their tool@@ bar ( s ) will be loaded ( if a file is opened by the corresponding type ) . &quot;
&quot; perhaps the most notable extension of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; for the normal user , the possibility to add documentation for scrip@@ ting language or format@@ ting language you like most . therefore , this chapter describes how I create a &amp; PHP ; documentation tree for my personal use . &quot;
&quot; before you start your own documentation , you might be able to check in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; review if someone has done it for you . &quot;
there are two parts in this process . first you need to find an existing documentation for format@@ ting / script / etc ; language . then you need to create the doc@@ x file .
# K@@ DE configuration file &#91; Tree &#93; Doc dir = path relative to this file to the documentation HTML files e.g. php@@ 42 / # elements in the main index top element = your description for these documentation e.g. &amp; PHP ; 4.2 Docum@@ entation Section 1 = Sec@@ tion@@ 1.@@ html Sec@@ 2.3 = Sec@@ 2.@@ 3.@@ html Sec@@ 2.3 = Sec@@ 2.@@ 3.@@ html Options
&quot; the tree section defines the visible part of the documentation in the documentation tree . for example , you can now see in the &amp; PHP ; documentation so : &quot;
&quot; # K@@ DE Con@@ fig File &#91; Tree &#93; Doc dir = php@@ 42 / # top level element element = PHP 4.2 documentation PHP 4.2 documentation = Table of Contents , # Get@@ ting Start@@ ed = Introduction , ... Introduction = introduc@@ tion@@ .html ... Language Reference = Basic syntax , ... Basic syntax = langu@@ age@@ .@@ basic @-@ syn@@ ture@@ .html ... &quot;
note the # before Get@@ ting Start@@ ed and Language Reference . this indicates that it is a sub@@ folder in the tree with its own contents . there is no known boundary for the depth of chess ( except by reason ) m@@ d@@ ash ; but try it yourself .
note that the contents directory is refer@@ enced directly to a file ( and consequently at the top of the tree view &amp; m@@ d@@ ash ; folder is displayed ! ) .
&quot; spaces influence nothing , but pay attention to &amp; &amp; lt ; characters . these should be replaced by &amp; amp ; and &amp; lt ; in all &amp; XML ; -@@ based &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; resources are replaced . &quot;
&quot; for example , when writing a &amp; PHP ; script should display the documentation for the my@@ sql _ fetch _ array function . by selecting the function name and pressing C@@ trl ; H for context help , the documentation would appear directly . there are only two types of entries here : the context list ( Cont@@ ext@@ List ) and the file connection lines . &quot;
&quot; a simple list of separate context elements that should be available ( for &amp; PHP ; , these are the functions of &amp; PHP ; ) . &quot;
&quot; now you can save your file doc@@ rc and go to $ HOME / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / doc for local or global use . then create a folder ( as you specified in your file doc@@ rc ) in the same folder as doc@@ rc and copy your HTML documentation there . &quot;
&quot; if you are sure that these are good and worth sharing , send your doc@@ rc files with a description of important information , e.g. which documentation was used to &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ Rep@@ osit@@ ory for use by the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; community . you will not be rich , but proud to have worked with the best web development platform . &quot;
&quot; with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; you are not alone . it is possible to share the distributed resources ( D@@ TE@@ P packages , tool@@ bars with actions , scripts , templates ) with others . there are two ways to do this : &quot;
&quot; the resources can be sent by email to friends , partners , or else to whom . in different places , you can send an e @-@ mail menu entry , such as DT@@ D DT@@ D package ( D@@ TE@@ P ) with email , in the context menu of files and folders in the templates and in the script tree . &quot;
&quot; the resources can be uploaded into our main archive , from where all the other &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; users can download them and only available if our team is considered correct and useful for publishing . in order to make a financial contribution , we recommend the origin of the resources , both for our team and for the later users . &quot;
&quot; when up@@ loading , you are asked for their pas@@ sp@@ hr@@ ase for their private GP@@ G key ( the pas@@ sp@@ hr@@ ase is not stored ) , or in the event you have several keys , you can select one . in the dialog new resource you need to fill in the input fields ( URL preview can be empty ) and with clicking OK the upload will be started . &quot;
&quot; up@@ loading can be uploaded by the DT@@ D DT@@ D @-@ Package ( D@@ TE@@ P ) , load tool@@ bar tool@@ bar , and started in the context menu of files and folders in the templates and scripts tree . &quot;
&quot; after downloading a resource , before installation , examined &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the integrity of the resource by checking the integrity and signi@@ fication . in case of problems it war@@ ns and it can be broken down . if the integrity is given and the resource correctly signed , a message appears stating the origin@@ ator of the resource . &quot;
&quot; it is possible to work on XML languages that are currently not yet supported by &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; however , the creation can be time @-@ consuming because hundreds of tag files could be needed in tag@@ XML format . there is the simpler way to convert a DT@@ D automatically into a D@@ TE@@ P package . &quot;
the conversion can be started from the DT@@ D Menu and converting a DT@@ D . select the .@@ dt@@ d file with the DT@@ D description that should be used . then the following dialog appears :
target directory name : the newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; is written with this name in the $ K@@ DE@@ HOME / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / d@@ te@@ p folder .
! Doc@@ type Defin@@ i@@ tions@@ Menu : the string that is in ! Doc@@ type Tag , like HTML PU@@ B@@ LI@@ C - / / W3@@ C / / DT@@ D HTML 4.0@@ 1 Transi@@ tional / / EN http : / / www.w@@ 3.@@ org / TR / HTML@@ 4 / loos@@ e.@@ dt@@ d &quot;
&quot; fine adjustment of D@@ TE@@ P after conversion : if enabled , brings &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; after conversion the &amp; descrip@@ tion@@ rc ; editor , with the details of the newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; it is recommended to use this option . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us , there are some key concepts . in order to understand these and full benefits from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us , one must first famili@@ ari@@ ze oneself with these fundamental concepts . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the working area is divided into three areas : global , local and project @-@ related . this distinction concerns a number of components in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; &quot;
&quot; global elements are stored for everyone , the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; using , available . from tool@@ bars about actions is all that is marked as global , in the common folder structure of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; saved . this enables the group of administrators to secure various tool@@ bars , actions and patterns in the global tree , which are then available to everyone in a multi @-@ user environment at the system . &quot;
local elements represent a personal collection of web developers for a single user . these are user @-@ specific patterns and tool@@ bars . local elements are stored in the user directory so that they can only use this user personally .
&quot; project @-@ related elements are available only within a specific project . this can be anything from &amp; CSS ; -@@ patterns to tool@@ bars with special actions specifically for the files of a particular project . simply said , this is the most constra@@ ined size . all elements are stored in the folder tree of the project , which is the common use of special tools and patterns from all employees within the project . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ M@@ DI ; consists of several main areas : the Edi@@ tor@@ pane , the construction man@@ sions , the map guides with information and the tool@@ bars . please check in and for further information on these areas . &quot;
&quot; you can click on the right mouse button to get a context menu with the current document matching entries , such as close the current , un@@ loaded , delete or up@@ loading of the document , jump to a book@@ marks or execution of CV@@ S commands for the current document . &quot;
&quot; right @-@ click on the editing pane will lead to a further contex@@ tual menu regarding the edited document contents , such as editing / copy / paste , editing the tags on the mouse poin@@ ter or opening the file , if the string below the mouse @-@ cur@@ sor is called a file . &quot;
&quot; at present , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; &amp; HTML ; 4.0@@ 1 Transi@@ tional as standard , for which a set of tool@@ bars is shown . in the course of the further expansion of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us , the tool@@ bars will be adapted to the new functions and related user requirements . &quot;
&quot; the use of tool@@ bars is really easy . if you want to insert a single tag , e.g. &amp; lt ; insert into your document , then click the symbol that represents the tag . now you can insert the data for this just added tag . if you want to insert a tag that has multiple attributes ( such as anch@@ ors ) , you can fill in a dialog with different fields . &quot;
&quot; the building man@@ sions ( Q@@ IT ; ) allow to navigate to the information about &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; to navigate , open and trans@@ p them . in the display with cardboard cut@@ ters are available for files , project , sample templates , document structure , scripts , attributes and documentation tree views . &quot;
&quot; project management is a powerful tool that provides &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; this view displays all files in the project and allows managing the files in the project by means of right mouse click . actions such as adding , removing , up@@ loading or del@@ eting files from the storage medium can be performed using the then displayed context menu . &quot;
&quot; a further possibility of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is the use of templates . almost everything can be a template : images , program parts , a whole website , etc . all possibilities are open to you . &quot;
&quot; templates can be divided into three categories depending on which context they are used . global templates are always available , local templates only for the appropriate users and templates in projects are only usable in the project . &quot;
&quot; here you can find information about the available scripts . the concept of breakdown in Global , Local and Project also works here . by clicking the left mouse button , you can access the available information to a script . &quot;
&quot; with this view , one shows the internal structure of the active document . by clicking on an element , the cur@@ sor in the document is set to the position of the element . by clicking on an element , a list of commands opens in terms of navigation and refres@@ hment of the tree . &quot;
&quot; this tree appears among the other tree views . with it , man@@ age@@ able attributes and nam@@ esp@@ aces can change . the entry system oriented to the contents allows the change of all available attributes with a few mouse clicks . &quot;
&quot; here is the complete documentation on the web @-@ technology for your development . it can be downloaded pre @-@ packed documentation for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; from the qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; &apos; documentation site , you can create your own documentation , and by adding a folder to a project can be edited , edited and viewed . &quot;
&quot; by default , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; two cartridges at the bottom of the window , can be reached via the useful information : the message window and the problem window . &quot;
&quot; this tab shows information about each script running in Qu@@ anta , for example , the currently used DT@@ D of the current document and all changes to DT@@ D are displayed . &quot;
this tab shows all errors in the mark@@ up of the current document . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; scripts that are executed give all error messages ( as there are ) in this window .
the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; tool@@ bars are extensively expanded and easy to understand . show them on a symbol and they get the corresponding command . the cho@@ col@@ ates page of the tool@@ bars is the option of defining your own commands as symbols in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ;
&quot; another function of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is the ability to send a tool@@ bar with E@@ Mail . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; sends the tool@@ bar as compressed tel@@ e archive about &amp; k@@ mail ; . if you get a tool@@ bar in an E@@ Mail , you can save them in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; like any other save and load ! &quot;
&quot; it is reasonable if you want to customize the location of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ files on your system . for this , auto@@ conf has a number of options that can be passed to the configure script . to get a complete list of all options , type . / configure --@@ help . &quot;
&quot; if you have problems with starting &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us , you should check if your path contains the &amp; k@@ de ; 3 bin folder . also , you should make sure that no older version of &amp; k@@ de ; 3 in PAT@@ H before their bin folder lies . the same applies to &amp; Q@@ t ; . &quot;
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is a web development tool for the K@@ DE surface . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; has been optimized for a fast web development and combines a sophisticated development environment with a variety of powerful functions .
&quot; while trying to create the best &amp; HTML ; editor , the developers of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us began to deal with a close idea : what if &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; an independent , exp@@ and@@ able Mark@@ up Language Editor would be ? well , this would make it to the absolutely great web development tool for &amp; k@@ de ; so it was done . &quot;
&quot; no longer limited to pure &amp; HTML ; limited , is &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; now well on the way to a general and comprehensive web development tool . summar@@ ized : if you can define it in &amp; XML , then should &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; to be the appropriate &amp; IDE . &quot;
&quot; now , to the above claim must be recorded that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; as a product based on the outstanding efforts of the entire &amp; k@@ de ; development community is based . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; follows , in good application of free software , the idea of Why developing what someone else has developed ? thanks to the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ framework is not only possible for users and developers , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; to expand as they need it for their needs . &quot;
&quot; &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; enables web developers to use an intuitive and powerful multi @-@ document surface ( M@@ DI ; ) . this can dramatically increase productivity . by means of self @-@ kn@@ itted actions , scripts and tool@@ bars , automation is possible almost every task . &quot;
&amp; Qu@@ anta ; Plus ; is a web development environment for HTML and related languages . it was designed for fast web development and was quickly expanded to an advanced editor with many powerful functions .
&amp; Qu@@ anta ; plus is in no way connected with commercial versions of &amp; Qu@@ anta ; the original developers left the GP@@ L licensed version and produced a commercial program .
&quot; more detailed documentation is available with help : / Qu@@ anta ( either this URL in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; enter , or execute a help@@ center help : / Qu@@ anta ) . &quot;
&amp; Qu@@ anta ; is currently being developed and supervised by Eric L@@ aff@@ oon Sequ@@ it@@ ur @ k@@ de@@ .org and Andr@@ as Man@@ tia am@@ anti@@ a @ k@@ de@@ .org .
&quot; a quick access list of files that you have opened . this list changes every time you open a file that is not located , with the oldest entry . &quot;
&quot; this allows you to save code parts and whole files as templates for later use . if you are trying to save the selected file / text outside of the local / project template folder , only one error is reported . &quot;
&quot; conver@@ ts when inser@@ ting from the clip@@ board there special characters to &amp; HTML ; -@@ Writ@@ ing , so that they are correctly displayed and not mis@@ understood by the browser as a format@@ ting reference . &quot;
&quot; convert the text from the clip@@ board in &amp; URL ; -@@ Writ@@ ing , which is the correct way to insert special characters and spaces in &amp; URL ; s . primarily used to insert &amp; URL ; s used in the anchor tag . &quot;
&quot; switches or off the block selection , which allows you to select text blocks with the help of the Shift ; key . &quot;
go directly to a line number . this is very helpful if your &amp; PHP ; script gives error messages !
search a string or regular expression in the selected directory . a type gre@@ p or sed with GUI and pre@@ defined expressions to help you .
displays the message window or not . this is the window where you see the display of scripts and the de@@ bu@@ gger .
switching and switching of the problem rep@@ orter at the bottom of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; main window . the problem rep@@ orter is activated as soon as you switch to the structure tree .
&quot; displays the tool@@ bars on the left of the main window . this column allows you to set book@@ marks with a mouse click . &quot;
&quot; if there is book@@ marks in the current file , they will appear in the menu together with the entries Previous or Next , depending on the position of the cur@@ sors in the document . &quot;
book@@ marks from other opened documents appear in the menu group@@ ed according to the file name of the other documents .
opens an existing project from the hard drive . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ Projects are saved with the file extension .@@ web@@ pr@@ j .
presents a dialogue to insert files into the current project . the selected files will then be copied into the project directory .
&quot; searches the project directory for new files that could be there . that allows , for example , to copy graphics files to your project folder or sub@@ folder and then add them to the project . &quot;
loads the files in your project on the server . the list of available transport methods depends on your version of &amp; k@@ de ; and whether you have downloaded further input / output modules ( K@@ IO slaves ) .
settings like &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the project is managed . in Chapter &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ Projects you will find the details explained .
this will be stored in project you / Tool@@ bars and are only in this menu if you have assigned it to this project .
a dialog to save your tool@@ bars . allows you to select the type of tool@@ bar : local or project .
&quot; opens a dialog to add a new tool@@ bar . this only creates the name . actions must be saved by settings actions ... to save tool@@ bars , or you will be asked if you want to save the tool@@ bars . &quot;
&quot; removes a tool@@ bar from the field of view . it does not delete them from the disk . if you haven &apos;t saved the tool@@ bar yet , you &apos;ll be asked if you want to do that . &quot;
&quot; this allows you to send your own tool@@ bar to someone ( maybe to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; team , so that the tool@@ bar is present in the next release ) . the menu item opens a new email message with the tool@@ bar as attachment . &quot;
&quot; enables up@@ loading of tool@@ bars to the main server , where everyone can access it . see in . &quot;
&quot; download a &amp; DT@@ D ; , which you or anyone else has made and convert to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; own description format . &quot;
&quot; load / refres@@ h the entities from the &amp; DT@@ D ; it makes sense if the entities from the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P are to be refres@@ hed without renew@@ ing the entire &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; if this is global and is not present in the global K@@ DE folder , the store fails . &quot;
&quot; this menu contains a list of tags that are present in the currently loaded tool@@ bars . if the default ( HTML ; ) tool@@ bar is loaded , there is a sub @-@ menu default in the tags menu that contains the list of tags / actions on this tool@@ bar . &quot;
&quot; this entry is always available in the Tags menu , followed by &amp; DT@@ D ; -@@ specific sub@@ menus . &quot;
&quot; activ@@ ates or de@@ activ@@ ates the intelligent inser@@ tion of tags . currently , this only works with ( X ) HTML DT@@ Ds . intelligent inser@@ tion means that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the inser@@ tion using tool bar ref@@ uses when this day contra@@ di@@ cts the rules . &quot;
&quot; in the plug @-@ in menu , the available plug @-@ ins are listed under the menu items mentioned above . click on it activ@@ ating . clicking on an activated plug @-@ in is disabled . &quot;
sel@@ ects the syntax highlight mode for the current file . the list of available origin schem@@ ata depends on der@@ k@@ ate ; version .
&quot; very useful when you know people who use other OS platforms to develop . choose Unix , Windows / DOS or Mac@@ intosh . &quot;
checks the syntax of the current document using the selected &amp; DT@@ D ; using the external application ti@@ dy .
&quot; instant switching between the different types of user interface . due to some limitations in the K@@ DE libraries , the change@@ over sometimes might need time or cause un@@ beautiful graphics . recommended is the map card mode , which is also the default setting , or the sub @-@ window mode , which corresponds to the representation in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; 3.2 and earlier . &quot;
&quot; in addition , this menu has an entry for each open sub@@ window . selecting a entry will activate the corresponding sub@@ window . &quot;
switches the display of the status bar at the bottom of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; main window on or off .
&quot; the changes in this dialog affect any application that uses the k@@ html @-@ part , including the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ Web browser . &quot;
direc@@ ts the behavior of the editor window . in the documentation of &amp; k@@ ate ; you will find details .
&quot; a dialog appears in which you delete entries from the tool@@ bars , or which you can add and change sequences . &quot;
&quot; this should create a help according to the environment of the mouse poin@@ ter , but is not implemented yet . &quot;
&quot; &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is a high quality product that is freely available and licensed , but as with any open source project the developers can always use help . if they want to support the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; development in financial form , they find here the way . &quot;
&quot; the fields are self @-@ explan@@ atory and should be completed best from top to bottom , as e.g. after completing the project name the whole directory structure will be completed automatically for the rest of the project . all these paths and author information fields can later be set with Shift ; F@@ 7 project project features . &quot;
&quot; here is the name for the project , for example fo@@ o . when entering the name , file is filled automatically . &quot;
this is the name of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us project file . by default it has the name of the project in lo@@ wer@@ case letters and without spaces with the extension web@@ pr@@ j ( e.g. f@@ oo@@ .@@ web@@ pr@@ j ) . this file is stored in the project directory .
&quot; here you can find the server address of the machine you want to access , unless you edit local data . either a name ( host@@ nam@@ e.@@ ex@@ amp@@ le.com ) or an IP address ( 12@@ 7.0@@ .0@@ .1 ) are possible . &quot;
&quot; if you leave this field empty , the default settings of the chosen protocol will be used . depending on the setting of the remote host , an adjustment might be necessary . &quot;
&quot; this is the folder where templates for the project are stored . it is a relative path to the project and by default templates . if a common collection of files is used for different projects , this folder should be set instead of the standard . &quot;
&quot; this is the folder where the tool@@ bars are saved for the project . it is a relative path to the project and by default Tool@@ bars . if a common collection of files is used for different projects , this folder should be set instead of the standard . &quot;
this allows to insert files from the local files@@ ystem to the project . several files or folders can be selected .
&quot; this setting is great if you have static web@@ in@@ ars you want to download and change . for server @-@ fail@@ ing scripts ( e.g. &amp; PHP ; , Python , &amp; etc ; ) you have to move differently . &quot;
&quot; if files that are located somewhere in the main folder of the project should be attached . if a project is started from scratch , not hook . &quot;
&quot; with this option , all the files and folders are displayed within the main folder and you can make an exact selection of good th@@ inner . &quot;
&quot; this displays a list of files in the main folder . you can select the desired files by hook or , by removing the tick , clips from the project . &quot;
the last screen of the new project wiz@@ ard contains three settings that simplify your work . these settings can be up@@ loading in the menu with Project Properties in the sub@@ window profile or Shift ; F@@ 7 .
some settings correspond to those in the project wiz@@ ard and are described in detail . the additional entries are explained below .
&quot; a list of file names ( plac@@ eholders possible ) , which are ignored in project @-@ related operations such as project folders . &quot;
&quot; additional option to the above , also files listed in .c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore , are excluded from the project . &quot;
&quot; the project view , which is loaded when opening the project , can be read more about project views . &quot;
&quot; thus , the desired de@@ bu@@ gger can be selected . currently only G@@ ub@@ ed is supported . more information about G@@ ub@@ ed can be found in . the Deb@@ ug@@ ger plugin can be set using the Options button . in this way , troubleshooting is described . &quot;
&quot; in the sub@@ window profile , high @-@ load profiles ( see in ) can be set , as well as the display of a tree view for the content of the server for each profile by showing an own tree view for each profile . &quot;
&quot; in the sub@@ window team configuration , project members can be added , edited or deleted as well as a mailing list . see the details . &quot;
&quot; in the Event configuration window , you can turn event actions and add , change or delete event actions . event actions are executed when a previously specified event occurs , such as the backup of a file . see the details . &quot;
&quot; by default , open &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the last project that was opened . this behavior cannot be influenced at the moment . &quot;
&quot; to open a different project , select Project ... from the menu project or the symbol project open from the tool@@ bar . the dialog project will open and allows the selection of a project . projects have .@@ web@@ pr@@ j as extension . &quot;
&quot; if &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; closed , the project file will be saved automatically . you will be asked if you want to save changes before leaving , if &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; changed files will be . same happens when you load a new project . &quot;
project management gives free access to the files in the project . there you can manage the files in the current project .
&quot; folders also behave as well , but the entries are missing and opening with ... in the context menu with the right mouse button : &quot;
&quot; here , different profiles can be selected . the profile contains information about the location of the uploaded files . &quot;
&quot; allows removal of the current profile . if only a profile is present , the button will be blin@@ ded to prevent removal . &quot;
&quot; the password will be retained in the core memory and will be forgotten when it comes to programming . this option is useful if frequent up@@ loading of files is necessary , and the rather uns@@ af@@ e password on the disk will not get into question . &quot;
this will stop the transmission or simply leave the dialog if you change your opinion before up@@ loading .
&quot; in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us , many high @-@ load profiles can be created and the project ( or parts of the project ) can be uploaded to different servers . when editing or creating a profile , this dialog is displayed : &quot;
this is the server name on which the files are to be copied . either a fully qualified domain name or an IP address will work .
&quot; the transfer protocol for up@@ loading . the list depends on the version of &amp; k@@ de ; and the installed ki@@ o slaves . at least you should select from &amp; FTP ; , file ( locally ) and n@@ fs . &quot;
&quot; the port for transfer . normally , this does not have to be changed , except the network administrator does not operate a service on the usual port . &quot;
&quot; depending on your anxiety wave , this is either a time @-@ saving function or a danger . &quot;
&quot; a project view is only a set of files and tool@@ bars . there can be many views in one project , i.e. by simply changing the view , various files and tool@@ bars can be loaded and replace the currently opened files and tool@@ bars . &quot;
&quot; views can be saved , opened or deleted from the tool@@ bar project or project tool@@ bar . &quot;
&quot; this chapter describes the parts of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us , with which one has the most to do . this helps not only increase productivity , but also allows adjustment of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; to the own working method . &quot;
as mentioned above are tool@@ bars in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; preferably st@@ acked on the tool@@ bar menu . use and Add differ . adding tool@@ bars is handled at the bottom in the section adding tool@@ bars .
&quot; tool@@ bars and symbols can be set either using context menu ( right @-@ click on the tool@@ bar ) , in which new action , a new tool@@ bar can be created , which can be used to ren@@ ame or set tool@@ bars , which can be displayed in the dialog where you can see which actions on this or other tool@@ bars are to be visible . &quot;
&quot; by calling the context menu to an action ( icon ) on a tool@@ bar , additional entries will be removed and action edited , which are self @-@ explan@@ atory . &quot;
the tool@@ bars and the actions on them can set up in the menu with Settings tool@@ bars ... and set settings actions .. set .
&quot; templates are essentially the document skel@@ et@@ ons , code cut@@ lets and files to link . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; templates are basically used as a usual file system with extended organization and interfaces . you can copy , move , or link any existing directory to the template tree . templates have in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; in roughly the restrictions you imagine for the files@@ ystem . &quot;
some with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; provided templates have conditions for their use . please read the conditions specified at the beginning of each template before use .
binary templates are usually inserted in documents by links ( e.g. pictures with img src = / src / ur@@ l ) . some examples can be found in the template tree under global templates .
&quot; documents can be edited by any text document type . on the basis of these templates , new documents can be created . typically , special documents are placed in appropriate sub@@ folders . some examples can be found in the template tree under global templates . see for more information on the templates tree . &quot;
&quot; this type of templates is useful if not a new document is to be inserted into the documents based on a template , but the same text area . &quot;
&quot; as the name says , these templates serve as templates for whole websites . they are a collection of various documents that can be organized in a folder structure , in a compressed tar archive . currently , there are no examples in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us . &quot;
&quot; create a document structure according to you ( XML ; , &amp; HTML ; , Doc@@ Book &amp; etc . ) and choose file as template save as local template . &quot;
&quot; once this is done , you notice that ( even if it was saved as a project template ) the template is not visible in the project tree . look in the template tree under project templates . &quot;
&quot; select text in your document and click &quot; &quot; Save as a local / project template &quot; &quot; as template . alternatively , the selection can be easily drag@@ ged with drag and drop to the tree view templates . &quot;
&quot; creating binary templates is simple : the file can only be copied to a template folder . it can be used for all file management functions , such as drag and drop or paste over the file tree of Kon@@ quer@@ or . &quot;
&quot; you can click on a folder in the file tree or in the project files and create site template , enter a name for the template and backup . by default , it is saved in the project folder , but of course it can be stored as a local or global template . &quot;
&quot; project templates allow a very target @-@ oriented approach . you can pre@@ fix head@@ lines and foot@@ ers or dynam@@ ically connect to &amp; PHP ; design , insert files or link them with them . additionally , you can keep some things in mind when using templates in projects . &quot;
the Template structure in the sub@@ window templates is based on the files placed in $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / templates and $ HOME / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / templates .
&quot; to specify the behavior of a folder , click the Fol@@ der Overview with the right mouse button on the folder and select properties in the context menu . the following dialog appears : &quot;
&quot; a drop @-@ down field with the three types described above ; files , text or templates . this selection is f@@ aded away as soon as the attribute is inherited . &quot;
&quot; in case of a normal folder , the bla@@ h would be explicitly enabled . in case of a normal folder , the bla@@ h would appear with something like text building . if nothing appears , it is likely to be found in a root folder . &quot;
this could be general header or foot@@ er for all templates for a specific project and allows to equi@@ p all templates for a specific project by copying contents templates in a folder with special head@@ lines / foot@@ ers a whole presentation already with the matching head@@ lines / foot@@ er lines .
&quot; in addition , you have the context menu ( show right mouse button ) via a complete command collection for adding folders or copy and paste templates from one place to another . &quot;
&quot; &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; offers two modes : V@@ PL ; editor and V@@ PL ; &amp; source text editor , which can be accessed via the View menu . the first mode replaces the source text editor by the V@@ PL ; editor and second , the Edi@@ ting Pan@@ e sub@@ divi@@ des the source text editor and the V@@ PL ; editor . &quot;
the V@@ PL ; editor works as follows : it loads a document like a normal &amp; HTML ; - or &amp; XHTML ; -@@ page and a cur@@ sor appears .
&quot; when working with the V@@ PL ; editor on a document that contains &amp; PHP , a small green symbol shows the default of &amp; PHP ; source code . it is not possible to edit this directly to the V@@ PL ; to edit &amp; PHP ; there is no plans to change this behavior . &quot;
&quot; second mode works exactly like the first one except that at the same time the changes are visible in the source code editor and in the V@@ PL ; editor and the cur@@ sor in the source text editor and in the V@@ PL ; editor is active , this mode is already active , when the button is activated by the active cur@@ sor from one window to the other , while maintaining the position in the document . &quot;
the synchron@@ isation distance between the V@@ PL ; editor and the source code editor can be set up via Settings Qu@@ anta . after choosing V@@ PL ; View can be set between synchron@@ ization after one click or automatically . in principle the recommendation : a small chip for fast calcul@@ ator and a large chip for slow .
&quot; the document properties -@@ Dialog is also called when a new document with the V@@ PL ; editor is created , so you can change the following : &quot;
met@@ a tags allow the storage of information on the document itself e.g. keywords for internet search engines . met@@ a elements can be added or removed by pressing the two buttons down or removed . one click into the list allows the change of the content , e.g. keywords on the column name and keyword keyword 2 on the content column . &quot;
CSS rules are the new way to design the appearance of pages in the browser . you can add or delete CSS rules using the buttons below the list . editing CSS rules is currently not supported .
&quot; it is possible to include an external CSS style template by pressing the file opening button , selecting the appropriate file . &quot;
&quot; using the cur@@ sor is possible , as in a text processing , by moving with arrows , possible . under rare circumstances the cur@@ sor beha@@ ves strange . the marking works as usual . text can be inserted by typ@@ ing and deleted using call@@ back or Rem@@ ove button . &quot;
&quot; inser@@ ting tags is done in the same way via the tool@@ bars , such as in the source code editor . it is worth not@@ ing that inser@@ ting tags previously already existing identical tags are not removed , e.g. when an anchor tag , surrounded by text , must be removed any other given anchor tag . &quot;
&quot; some tool@@ bars like the tables wiz@@ ard or the lists assistant are disabled . they will work later in &amp; V@@ PL ; in this release , the tables or lists tool@@ bars must be used . &quot;
&quot; &amp; x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g ; is a tool for investigation of style sheets . unlike other styles for style sheets , the search for certain elements is possible and the execution of the style template can be followed . &quot;
&quot; &amp; x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g ; to be able to compile , need except &amp; k@@ de ; still libraries lib@@ x@@ s@@ lt , li@@ be@@ x@@ s@@ lt and Lib@@ XML , which are already present at a typical installation of &amp; k@@ de ; already available . &quot;
&quot; new to x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g 3.@@ 1.4 : in g@@ db compatibility mode , any holding points can be set in a specific file and line number and later enabled . &quot;
&quot; x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g determines the full path from a filename without path . file names in the same folder as the top loaded style file filename with relative path to the working folder con x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g Is , for example , a style template file .. / en / x@@ sl@@ doc@@ .@@ x@@ s@@ l , the following entry is possible : &quot;
&quot; in this command , a partial or complete agreement with a feature called my@@ QNA@@ ME or a specified name name is checked . &amp; eg ; template matches any QNAP that contains the string template . &quot;
&quot; each nam@@ esp@@ ace in the specified &quot; &quot; QNA@@ ME &quot; &quot; will be expanded according to the rules defined by the nam@@ esp@@ ace defined in the X@@ SL source file : test@@ 1 is &amp; eg ; extended to http : / / www.w@@ 3.@@ org / 199 / X@@ SL / Trans@@ form : test@@ 1 &quot;
a sought @-@ after stop must be resolved for the associated URI and line number . this will be automatically executed when loading the first template by x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g . re@@ taining points will be checked again shortly after the start of each run .

there are many graphical tools to compare . so why &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ? let me briefly explain why I wrote .
&quot; the merge was very complicated , because one of the contribut@@ ors had made many changes and at the same time corrected the ind@@ entation at many places . another program@@ mer had changed a lot of text in the same file . &quot;
&quot; the program used by me only showed me the changed lines , but I couldn &apos;t see what changed exactly within these lines . and there was no indication of the places where perhaps only the ind@@ entation had changed . the mer@@ ging of these changes was a small night@@ mare . &quot;
this was the beginning . the first version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; could display differences within a line and changes to white characters . later a lot of other useful features were added .
&quot; for example , if you want to quickly compare text , simply copy it to the clip@@ board and insert it in one of the comparison windows . &quot;
&quot; a function that made a lot of work , was the same and mer@@ ging of folders . this function transformed &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; almost in a full file browser . &quot;
&quot; this is useful when two people work independently of each other on a piece of code and make changes . the original file ( the base ) helps resolve conflicts and simultaneously displays the result . in this editor , you can even edit the result directly . in this editor you can even edit the result directly . the screen@@ shot shows three source files when assem@@ bling : &quot;
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; also helps you compare and merge with complete folder . this screen@@ shot shows &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; in the folder @-@ merge :
&quot; &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; shows the exact differences and den@@ otes the possibilities of today &apos;s color monitors . if you frequently have to check codes , you will like this feature . &quot;
&quot; differences in white characters and tab@@ s are displayed visible . if lines only differ in a certain number of white characters , one can see it at a glance at the summary in the column on the left side . ( no more trouble if someone changes the ind@@ entation . ) &quot;
&quot; if a file is equal and the other differs in one line , the color indicates which file is different . red color means that both files differ . &quot;
&quot; if all files have the same name but are in different folders , then you can make the typ@@ ing work easier by simply writing the file name of the first file . example : &quot;
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31
&quot; opening dialog allows manual typ@@ ing of file names , the selection via the file browser ( file ... ) or selecting a last opened file from the drop @-@ down list . &quot;
&quot; via the button folder ... you can also select a folder . if you choose a folder , the compar@@ isons and mer@@ ging of folders will be initiated . if a file is selected , for B and C , however , a folder , then uses &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the file name from A in the two other folders . &quot;
&quot; if mer@@ ging is crossed , the input field is active and can be processed . however , it is not necessarily required to immediately set a output file . you can do this step later while saving . &quot;
the set @-@ up button opens a dialog with settings . here you can specify options before starting with the same / merge operation .
&quot; sometimes you don &apos;t want to compare a whole file , but only parts of a text . &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; allows you to select text parts from the clip@@ board into the active comparison window . &quot;
you can also use drag and drop : simply drag a file from a file manager or selected text from an editor and drop it over a comparison window .
&quot; sometimes a file contains several similar functions . if you want to find out how similar these functions are , it would be a relatively big effort . you &apos;d need to create two corresponding files , load them in &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then you can simply copy , paste and then compare the relevant sections . &quot;
note : currently you can &apos;t get out of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; only the drop @-@ down text in a comparison window is supported .
warning : some editors interpret the drag and drop text into another program than cut and paste ( instead of copying and past@@ ing ) . in such a case your original data could be lost .
&quot; in the upper part of each text window , the Info Line contains the characters A , B or C , the filename and the line number of the first visible line in the window . ( note that window is optional . ) E@@ ach Info Line has a different color . ( if the path is too long for a file , then a small window will display the full name . ) &quot;
&quot; the three spring windows are the letters A , B and C . a has the color blue , B the color green and C is mag@@ enta . ( these pres@@ ets can be changed via the settings menu . ) &quot;
&quot; when a difference is detected , one can see the color which file differs . if both files differ , the default color is red . ( color for conflicts in the settings ) . the color scheme is particularly useful when comparing three files . that &apos;s good in the next section ( merge ) well . &quot;
&quot; in some programming languages where white characters are not so important , it is useful to see only the relevant changes . ( C / C + + for example , white characters are only relevant in strings and comments , for pre@@ processor and in few , rare individual cases . ) &quot;
&quot; the vertical line that separates the summary column from the text is interrupted at the places where the respective source file has no lines . if the line break is activated , the line will be shown in a frac@@ tional line . &quot;
&quot; the result window ( among the compar@@ isons windows ) also has a info line with the wor@@ ding output : , the filename and &#91; change &#93; when you edit the result . usually it contains text , but often it also contains conflicts . &quot;
! ! ! until all conflicts are resolved the Save de@@ activated ! ! ! ( use the buttons for next dissolved / un@@ resolved conflict to find the remaining conflicts . )
&quot; if only two compar@@ isons are used , each difference must also be resolved manually at the same time . &quot;
&quot; by clicking with the left mouse button in the summary column in one of the windows , the group belonging to the group will be highlighted in all windows and the first line of the group will be displayed . &quot;
&quot; this text does not appear in the final saved file , nor in a marking that you may copy and paste elsewhere . &quot;
&quot; the text &amp; lt ; merge conflict ; however , appears in the clip@@ board , if you copy this text from the result window . go carefully with this function . &quot;
&quot; note : when selecting the sources the options ignore numbers or ignore Ign@@ ori@@ ere C / C + + comments , changes in numbers or comments will also be treated like white characters . &quot;
&quot; when you click on one of the windows , you can use the arrow keys to the left , right , high , down , side up , beginning , end , C@@ trl @-@ start and C@@ trl @-@ End , Si@@ w as you are also used by other programs . &quot;
&quot; in the Show window , you can also use the other buttons to edit . use the Insert button to switch between inser@@ tion and over@@ write mode . ( default is the inser@@ tion mode . ) &quot;
a click with the left mouse button in one of the summar@@ izing columns synchron@@ izes the view of all windows to the beginning of the respective group ( as already mentioned in the section and explained the edi@@ table output window ) .
&quot; the tool@@ bar contains seven buttons for navigation with which you can jump to the current / first / last difference , to the next / previous conflict ( C@@ trl @-@ down / Str@@ g @-@ picture down ) or to the next / previous un@@ solved conflict . therefore , distinction must be drawn between solved and un@@ solved conflicts . &quot;
&quot; to copy the marker to the clip@@ board , you need to copy the Copy button ( C@@ trl @-@ C or C@@ trl @-@ Inser@@ tion ) . however , if it is enabled , whatever you mark is automatically copied to the clip@@ board and copying the manual copying . be careful with this option , because you might acci@@ dentally over@@ write the contents of the clip@@ board . &quot;
&quot; line ends are stored according to the underlying operating system . Unix flavors use a new@@ line @-@ feed @-@ character \ , and Win32 @-@ based systems use car return + line feed \ \ r \ . K@@ diff@@ 3 re@@ tains the line @-@ ends of the source files , therefore you should not use it with bin@@ aries . &quot;
the options and the list of last used files will be saved automatically at the end and restored at the next start . ( setting menu settings - &gt; K@@ diff@@ 3 ... )
&quot; choose a font with fixed width . ( on some systems , the dialog also provides fon@@ ts with variable width to choose from , but you should not use it . ) &quot;
&quot; when you activate this option , differences in ital@@ ics are displayed . if the selected script does not support this display , nothing happens . &quot;
&quot; on systems with only 16 or 256 colors , some colors may not be available in their pure form but would be sc@@ anned . on these systems , the button pres@@ ets automatically create an un@@ just color . &quot;
&quot; if this option is enabled , the corresponding number of spaces will be inserted when pressing the tab key . otherwise a tab@@ ulator will be inserted . &quot;
&quot; when you enter input or return , the return of the previous line will automatically be used for the next line . &quot;
&quot; if this option is enabled , any selection will be automatically copied to the clip@@ board . then copy the manual to the clip@@ board . &quot;
you can choose which line @-@ end type you prefer to save . the default value is the commonly used selection on the operating system used .
&quot; when comparing files , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; first to find all identical lines in the source files . only during this first step , white characters can be ignored . &quot;
&quot; some editors ( on some systems ) store a carriage return label &apos; \ \ r &apos; and a line feed &apos; \ &apos; at the end of a line , others only save a line feed &apos; \ &apos; . &quot;
&quot; in the first part of the analysis , numbers and associated characters ( &apos; 0 &apos; - &apos; 9 &apos; , &apos; . &apos; , &apos; - &apos; ) are ignored . &quot;
&quot; in default , this option is disabled . changes in comments are treated like changes in white characters . &quot;
&quot; the option is enabled in the default setting . it is effective for complicated and large files , but slowly with very large files . &quot;
&quot; in auto @-@ jumping mode , this setting determines how long the result of the selection is displayed before the next un@@ resolved conflict will continue . &quot;
&quot; automatically dis@@ sol@@ ves all conflicts in white characters by using the selected file as source . ( default is manual selection . ) This is useful if white characters are less important in many files . if you need this only from time to time , then use the option to ignore conflicts in numbers or comments if the options ignore numbers or ignore Ign@@ ori@@ ere C / C + + comments . &quot;
&quot; these options are discussed in the chapter on scanning of folders and exec@@ uting a merge . see for details , see documentation on the directory comparison and merge . &quot;
&quot; if a file is saved and already exists an older version , then the original version will be attached to the suff@@ ix .@@ orig@@ an@@ . if such a backup file exists with the suff@@ ix .@@ orig , it will be deleted without further backup . &quot;
&quot; this option does not affect the current program . you must &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; exit and restart , so that the change is active . ( this option is available in the K@@ DE version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; not available because the language is set global through the control center . ) &quot;
&quot; the following enco@@ ding settings can be set separately for each entry . if you activate this option , the top setting will be used for all entries . &quot;
&quot; over the selection fields for coding appears a short notice , which is the local coding . ( this cannot be changed here and has a purely informal character . ) &quot;
&quot; adjust the file coding for source files . this influences how special characters are treated and interpreted . as the enco@@ ding for each file is individually adjustable , even files can be compared and merged with different enco@@ ding . &quot;
&quot; if you have edited a file , you can specify which enco@@ ding to be used for saving . &quot;
&quot; if you define pre @-@ processing commands , you may not work with your co@@ dec . ( for example , your files may be 16 bit Uni@@ code , but the pre @-@ processing command can only handle 8 @-@ bit ASCII . ) With this option you can set the enco@@ ding of the output command commands . &quot;
&quot; ( note : this also applies to changes in numbers or comments , if the options ignore numbers or ignore Ign@@ ori@@ ere C / C + + comments . ) &quot;
&quot; this selection is only available if you compare 3 files . in normal mode , all differences are displayed in a color coded transition column . but sometimes you may want to see only the differences between two of three files . after selection of A &amp; lt ; -@@ gt ; C or B &amp; lt ; -@@ gt ; C or B &amp; lt ; -@@ gt ; C will be displayed next to the normal yet another transition column with the required information . &quot;
sometimes you prefer to use the available space on the screen for long lines . simply exit the less important windows . ( this option is located in the window menu . )
arran@@ ges the comparison windows side by side or side by side . this can also be useful for displaying long lines . ( this option is located in the window menu . )
&quot; sometimes consider the differences and then decide to merge the files together . the current file will merge together in the merge menu . a simple click will start the merge and use the filename of the last source file as default name for the output file . ( if this function is used to restart the merge operation , then the name of the last used output file is retained . ) &quot;
&quot; when reading a file , it will first be handed over to this external command . in &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then the output of the command will be visible , and not the file itself . you can write your own pre@@ processor that exactly suits your needs . you can use this function e.g. for cutting anno@@ ying parts or correc@@ ting the ind@@ entation . &quot;
&quot; when reading a file , it will first hand over to this external command ( see above ) , then the output of the command is the input of this command command . you can write your own pre@@ processor which exactly meets your requirements . each input line must have a corresponding output line . &quot;
&quot; the idea behind it is to give the user more flexibility in setting up the Di@@ ff results . however , an external program is required , and most users do not want to program it themselves . however , the good news is that in most cases sed or per@@ l are sufficient . &quot;
use this pre @-@ processing command for new@@ lines to convert the input into upper@@ case letters : SE@@ D &apos;s / \ \ ( . * \ \ ) / \ \ U \ \ 1 / &apos; This . * is a regular expression of the found text in the first clause . the \ \ U conver@@ ts the found text in upper@@ case .
CV@@ S and other version control systems use some keywords to add automatically generated strings ( info : / c@@ vs / keyword sub@@ stitution ) .
&quot; while you experiment with sed , you might start to understand it and maybe you may even like these regular expressions even . they are very useful because there are many programs that support very similar things . &quot;
ignor@@ ing numbers is actually an already built @-@ in function in K@@ diff@@ 3 . but it is good as an example for another pre@@ processor command for new@@ lines . sed &apos; s / &#91; 0@@ 123@@ 45@@ 67@@ 89.@@ - &#93; / / g &apos; E@@ ach character between &apos; &#91; &apos; and &apos; &#93; &apos; is a hit and each hit is replaced by nothing so practically deleted .
sometimes you might want to perform several replac@@ ements at once . then you can use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on &apos; ; &apos; to separate the replac@@ ements from each other . example :
&quot; instead of sed you can also use something else , e.g. per@@ l -@@ p -@@ e &apos;s / RE@@ GE@@ XP / replacement / SCH@@ AL@@ TER &apos; How@@ ever , per@@ l needs some details different . where sed \ \ ( and \ \ ) needs , per@@ l needs only ( and ) without the previous &apos; \ \ &apos; . example : &quot;
the data after the normal pre@@ processor will be retained for the display and mer@@ ging . the further operations only change the data that the line @-@ up algorithm sees .
&quot; note : in rare cases , if you use a normal pre@@ processor , the new@@ line pre@@ processor will display the output of the normal pre@@ processor . &quot;
&quot; pre@@ processor commands are very useful , but as with any function that changes text or hide differences , you may not acci@@ dentally notice certain differences and destroy important data in the worst case . &quot;
&quot; often program@@ mers need to process many files in a folder . for this reason , you can compare and merge with &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; complete folders . &quot;
... makes a proposal for each object to merge ; you can adjust the proposal before the start .
... can simul@@ ate mer@@ ging and shows the simul@@ ated changes without actually performing it
... performs selected actions either with all ( F@@ 7 key ) or only with selected objects ( F@@ 6 key )
this is very similar to comparing and mer@@ ging individual files . you just need to open folders on the command line or in the dialog file .
&quot; if three folders are merged , folder 1 is used as base . if no destination folder has been specified , use &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; folder 3 as a destination folder . &quot;
&quot; note that only the comparison of folders automatically starts , not the mer@@ ging . to start the merge , you must select the corresponding menu entry or press the F@@ 7 key . ( more details will follow . ) &quot;
&quot; while reading the folder , you will inform a small message window about the current progress . if you cancel the scan of the folder , only the files are listed that have been compared . &quot;
&quot; when the scan of the folder is completed , shows &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; a list window with the results on the left side , ... &quot;
&quot; each file and each folder that has been found during the scan , is shown here in a tree . you can select an object with a simple mouse click . &quot;
&quot; the folder structure is usually folded together . you can open a folder by clicking on the + / - , or double click on the object or by double @-@ clicking the arrow keys for left / right . &quot;
&quot; if you double click on a file , the file comparison will be started and a comparison window appears . &quot;
the symbol in the column name reflects the file type in the first folder ( A ) again . these types are possible :
&quot; if the file type is different in the other folders , this is visible in the columns A / B / C and in the details pane to the selected object . in such a case , the assem@@ bling action cannot be automatically selected . if the merge operation is started , you will be informed about problems of this kind . &quot;
&quot; as seen in the above picture , the colors red , green , yellow and black are used in columns A / B / C . &quot;
&quot; in identical entries , the color is also identical , even if the age of the entries is different . &quot;
folders are considered identical if their entire content is identical . then also folders have the same color . with folders the age is ir@@ relevant for its color .
&quot; the idea of this color scheme is based on dir@@ di@@ ff . the colors reflect the colors of a leaf again , which is only green , then yellow and later when it is old , red becomes red . &quot;
... &quot; A and C are identical , but not B : copy B ( or if B does not exist , delete the target if it exists ) &quot;
... &quot; A and B are identical , but not C : copy C ( or if C does not exist , delete the target if it exists ) &quot;
... &quot; B and C are identical , but not A : copy A ( or if A does not exist , delete the target if it exists ) &quot;
... &quot; A , B and C do not have the same file type ( e.g. if A is a folder and B file ) : error : conflic@@ ting file types . as long as such faul@@ ty objects exist , the mer@@ ging can not be started . &quot;
... &quot; A and B do not have the same file type ( e.g. if A is a folder and B file ) : error : conflic@@ ting file types . as long as such faul@@ ty objects exist , the mer@@ ging can not be started . &quot;
&quot; the synchron@@ ization mode is active if only two folders and no explicit target folder have been specified and if the option is synchron@@ ized , then select &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the necessary action , so that both folders are identical . if for an entry ... &quot;
... A and B exist but are not identical : merge and save the result in both folders . ( the user sees as visible file names for output file only B ; directly after the merge copy &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; B to A. )
&quot; if two folders are merged and the option to select new file instead of merge ( uns@@ af@@ e ) is enabled , then examined &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the date of the files and hits the same date , then an error message appears : files are different , but the date is identical .. if such errors are not eliminated , the merge operation cannot be started . &quot;
&quot; during mer@@ ging , a file is executed after the other . it status column shows skill when the mer@@ ging is successful , and correspon@@ d@@ ingly other messages when something unexpected arises . if the mer@@ ging is completed , you should make a final check and see if the status is all right . &quot;
&quot; if the file comparison method is selected in the setup dialog , K@@ diff@@ 3 will display other columns . these contain the number of un@@ solved , sol@@ dered , not white and white conflicts . ( the column for resolved conflicts will only appear if three folders are compared or merged . ) &quot;
&quot; you can either merge the currently selected entry ( file or odds ) , or all entries at once . if you have selected all the merge actions ( even in all sub@@ folders ) , you can start the merge operation . &quot;
&quot; please note : if you do not specified a destination folder , then the three folder merge mode C is used as a target , when the two folder merge is chosen B as target and when synchron@@ izing A and / or B is used as a target . &quot;
&quot; if you have selected a destination folder , please check if all entries in the destination folder should be displayed in the folder structure . there are some options to be ski@@ pped in the folder structure . check these options to avoid unpleasant surprises : &quot;
to merge all entries : select directory merge / continue in the list menu or press F@@ 7 ( the short@@ cut ) . to select only the current entry : select Action of the current element or press F@@ 6 .
&quot; if by conflic@@ ting file types still invalid merge actions , a message appears that indicates the faul@@ ty elements . you can then select a valid action for them . &quot;
&quot; when you merge all entries , a dialog box will appear with the options Browse , simul@@ ate and break . &quot;
&quot; select Sim@@ ulations if you want to see what would happen , without really making changes . you will then receive a detailed list of all actions . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then perform certain actions with all entries . if a manual intervention is necessary ( merge a single file ) , then a merge window opens ( note the screen@@ shot ) . &quot;
&quot; if you &apos;re done with a file , select again / continue or press F@@ 7 . if you haven &apos;t saved yet , a corresponding dialog appears . then , it will lead to the next entry . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the list , you will see some error messages that will help you to choose the cause of the problem . if you select the mer@@ ging proceeding ( F@@ 7 key ) , you can choose to choose another action for the entry or solve the problem in any other way before you continue with the merge . &quot;
&quot; if some entries were merged individually , you notice &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; these entries ( in the current session ) will not re@@ join them again . even if the mer@@ ging has been ski@@ pped or not saved , these entries are considered as completed . only if you change the mer@@ ging action , these entries will be merged again . &quot;
the Settings menu of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ( Set@@ ting Settings - &gt; K@@ diff@@ 3 ... ) now has a section called directory merge with these options :
only files that match the specified pattern are displayed in the element tree . separate patterns can be entered with a sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; . valid plac@@ eholders : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . ( e.g. * .c@@ pp ; * .@@ h ) . the default is * . folder must not match this pattern .
&quot; files and folders that match this pattern are not displayed in the element tree . it can be entered more than one pattern , use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as separ@@ ator . valid plac@@ eholder : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ orig@@ ; * .@@ o . &quot;
&quot; files and folders that match this pattern are not displayed in the element tree . it can be entered more than one pattern , use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as separ@@ ator . valid plac@@ eholder : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ orig@@ ; * .@@ o . &quot;
ignored files that would also be ignored by CV@@ S . many self @-@ generated files are ignored by CV@@ S . the big advantage is that this folder can be configured with a .c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore file . ( see info : / c@@ vs / c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore . )
&quot; in some file systems , files have a hiding attribute . in other file systems , a prec@@ eded spot marks a file as hidden . this option lets you decide whether to display these files in the element tree or not . this option is enabled in default . &quot;
&quot; if the option is switched off , symbolic links are compared . if the option is enabled , the files will be compared to which the links are displayed . this is disabled in default . &quot;
&quot; if the option is switched off , the symbolic links will be compared . if the option is enabled , the links will be treated and recur@@ sively searched . &quot;
&quot; complete analysis is slower than a simple binary analysis , and much slower when applied to files that contain no text . ( enter a corresponding anti @-@ pattern . ) &quot;
&quot; if you compare a large folder over a slow network , it may be faster to compare only the change date and file size . however , this speed advantage will cost you a certain amount of security . please use caution . this option is switched off in default . &quot;
&quot; it is not a real comparison . the files are considered identical if they are equal to size . it can be useful , for example , when copying the alter@@ ation date . please use caution . this option is switched off in default . &quot;
&quot; activ@@ ating the synchron@@ ization mode when two folders are compared and no destination folder has been specified . in this mode , the proposals for mer@@ ging are selected so that afterwards both folders are identical . also the results of mer@@ ging files are stored in both folders . this option is dep@@ rec@@ ated in the default setting . &quot;
&quot; if there are differences , instead of mer@@ ging the newer file is suggested as action instead of mer@@ ging the newer file as an action . ( this is considered uns@@ af@@ e , because it is assumed that the other file has not been modified . ) This option is dep@@ rec@@ ated in the default setting . &quot;
&quot; if a file or folder is replaced or deleted by another file , then the original version is ren@@ amed and the extension .@@ orig@@ . if an old backup file exists with the .@@ orig@@ . extension already exists , this will also affect the normal merge operation of individual files , not only the mer@@ ging of entire folders . this option is enabled in default . &quot;
&quot; normally , the folder merge display remains visible to the merge of individual files ; you can switch the window divi@@ der with the mouse . if you do not want , you can switch the main window in the window menu and switch between the two views by switching between directory &amp; text windows . &quot;
&quot; you can also merge a single file directly , without having to start the folder merge . as soon as you save the result , the status will be set up and the file will not be merged again if you start the folder merge . &quot;
&quot; however , this status will be lost if you re @-@ read the directory again : directory -@@ Menu : re @-@ read &quot;
K@@ DE supports network transparency with the help of K@@ IO slaves . K@@ diff@@ 3 uses this to read files and folders . this way you can specify files and folders to open files located on local or remote hosts .
the first command line compar@@ es a local file to an FTP server . the second command line compar@@ es a folder inside a compressed archive with a local folder .
a URL has a different syntax as local files and folders . you should consider a few things :
&quot; a path can be relatively und@@ . or .. contain . this is not possible with URLs , these are always absolute . &quot;
&quot; special characters must be mas@@ ked . ( # - &gt; % 23 , whit@@ esp@@ ace &gt; % 20 , etc . ) . for example , a file named / # fo@@ o # has the URL file : / % 23@@ fo@@ o % 23 . &quot;
&quot; sometimes due to the files@@ ystem on the server , sometimes by the protocol used . it follows a short list of restrictions : &quot;
&quot; or it cannot be distinguished whether a link to a file or folder shows . then , a file is accepted as a link target . ( FTP : , s@@ ft@@ p : ) . &quot;
&quot; there is no possibility to edit permission or change date . therefore , the per@@ missions or change date from the original . ( note the option of Con@@ fi@@ dence of size . ) ( This is possible only with local files . ) &quot;
&quot; the main purpose is currently the difference viewer in K@@ DE@@ VEL@@ OP . K@@ DE@@ VEL@@ OP first starts the built @-@ in differences viewer . to start K@@ diff@@ 3 , press the right mouse button on the difference viewer and then select In K@@ diff@@ 3@@ Part from the context menu . &quot;
&quot; normally you need &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; two full input files . however , if it is used as a part , it takes &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the name of the original files from the patch file . at least one of the two files must exist . then , the patch starts to restore the missing file . &quot;
&quot; in Kon@@ quer@@ or , you can click on a patch file and select from the context menu Preview in - K@@ Diff@@ 3@@ Part . furthermore , this is un@@ reliable when the original files have changed since the creation of the patch file . &quot;
&quot; if &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; as part is executed , it supports only the same of two files , a very small tool@@ bar and menu . &quot;
tools with the name K@@ Di@@ ff and K@@ diff@@ 2 ( now there are Comp@@ are ) already exist . in addition the name K@@ diff@@ 3 already points out that it can merge like the program diff@@ 3 from the Di@@ ff Tool collection .
I &apos;ve been using GP@@ L programs very long and learned a lot by listening to the sources of other programs . this is my thanks to all program@@ mers who have gone this way or go to this way .
&quot; you have compiled the program from the sources and probably not given the configure script to K@@ DE . in default , configure is installed in / usr / local , but then K@@ DE can &apos;t find the resources for the user interfaces ( e.g. k@@ diff@@ 3@@ u@@ i.@@ rc ) . in the RE@@ A@@ DM@@ E file you will find more information on this topic . &quot;
&quot; if only the number of white characters is different , these lines will be treated as identical ; however , if only one non @-@ white character is different , the line is not treated as identical . if similar lines are next to each other , this is the close of the case . &quot;
&quot; the editor is aware of any difference in the files where it starts and where it ends . however , this is necessary to resolve a conflict simply by clicking in the source code and selecting the button A / B / C . this important information is lost if the result is simply saved as text file and it is too much effort to create an own file format that could store this information . &quot;
the effort for this was so far too big . you can always restore a particular version by selecting a Source A / B / C . to edit larger amounts of text should be used another editor .
&quot; after removing text , suddenly , no src has been released ; no src has been released , and the text cannot be deleted . what does that mean and how can it be removed ? &quot;
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; uses already many colors to highlight differences . even more high@@ lighting would be conf@@ using and missing the purpose . please use another editor .
many good ideas and reports came from colleagues and many people from Wild Wild Web . thank you !
&quot; to use all functions of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 , you need &amp; k@@ de ; 3.1 or newer . &quot;
information on how to use K@@ diff@@ 3 on other platforms without K@@ DE can be found on the homepage .
a list of the last changes can be found at http : / / k@@ diff@@ 3.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net / Ch@@ ange@@ Log or in the Ch@@ ange@@ Log file in the source package .
&quot; to compile and install on a system with &amp; k@@ de ; use the following command in the base folder of the &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; -@@ Distribution : &quot;
&quot; K@@ DE @-@ dir speci@@ fies the folder in your system where K@@ DE is installed . if you are unsure , find more details in the RE@@ A@@ DM@@ E file . &quot;
&quot; since &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; auto@@ conf and autom@@ ake uses , you should have no problems with comp@@ iling . if difficulties pers@@ ist , please report on the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Mail@@ ing lists of it . &quot;
cut out ( C@@ trl @-@ X or Shift @-@ Rem@@ ove ) into the clip@@ board and delet@@ es the selected text . insert the text from the clip@@ board at the current cur@@ sor position or replace the current selection .
&quot; only show differences : files that are identical in all folders do not appear in the folder structure , and therefore not in the destination folder . &quot;
&quot; ( in the current version of the program , you will need to re @-@ read the folder with the function refres@@ h after changes to these options . ) &quot;
&quot; this also means that identical files will not be copied to the destination folder . if the destination folder doesn &apos;t already contain these files , they are missing after the merge operation . ( the behavior is probably modified in a later program version . ) This option is dep@@ rec@@ ated in default . &quot;
&quot; when you click on one of the buttons , the rows from the corresponding window will be attached to the end of the selected group in the result window ( if they are not already present ) . if the lines are already present , they will be removed by clicking on the button . &quot;
&quot; in default , this option is disabled . differences in individual characters ( such as &apos; A &apos; and &apos; a &apos; ) are treated like differences in white characters . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; displays a miniature display of all virtual des@@ kt@@ ops . it is quite convenient to see the running programs on the desktop , change its size , alter it or move it . this works both within a working area and for several . &quot;
the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; can display all virtual work@@ spaces as well as the applications running in it . applications can be selected and even moved on the desktop and to the other .
&quot; with the middle mouse button , windows can be moved within &amp; p@@ ager ; the movement is possible both inside a working area and on other work@@ spaces . &quot;
&quot; the context menu depends on where the right mouse button is cli@@ cked : when cli@@ cked on the empty background of &amp; K@@ p@@ ager , the context menu has only to set up the two entries P@@ ager ... and exit . if however , click on an application inside of &amp; p@@ ager , then the symbol and the name of the application as well as the entries are minim@@ izing , maxim@@ ize , on desktop and finish . &quot;
maxim@@ izes the application window to the full size of the desktop . appears only when cli@@ cked on an application .
send the application to the selected virtual desktop . appears only when cli@@ cked on an application .
&quot; if this check box is selected , windows can be moved within the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; s with the middle mouse button on the desktop and also moved to other work@@ spaces . &quot;
&quot; if this field is crossed , in &amp; K@@ p@@ ager , the names of the virtual des@@ kt@@ ops are displayed . &quot;
&quot; cross this field lets the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; display the numbers of virtual des@@ kt@@ ops . if it is displayed together with name , the names are marked with ordin@@ al@@ numbers , &amp; eg ; 1st Desktop . &quot;
&quot; if this field is crossed , the background of each desktop is also displayed as background in the &amp; p@@ ager . &quot;
&quot; if this field is crossed , the current programs are displayed as small windows in the &amp; p@@ ager ; otherwise only the empty work@@ spaces are displayed to allow their selection . &quot;
here the view of the program window is selected . simple rect@@ angles with the proportions of the program window . icon displays the window with its default symbol and Pix@@ map shows a small view of the real program window . note : Pix@@ map is only recommended for very fast systems .
&quot; here the arrangement of the &amp; p@@ ager ; main window can be determined : classi@@ cally let &amp; p@@ ager ; in a 2x@@ n @-@ grid appear , as from P@@ ager applications appear in some other window managers ; horizont@@ ally displays all virtual work@@ spaces in a horizontal row , which is very good for displaying on the desktop . &quot;
the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; can be used as an alternative to the P@@ ager mini program in the control bar . it has the advantage that it can be changed in size that can display and move windows as symbols or with their content . it also runs out of the control bar .
right @-@ click within &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; and subsequent selection of switches set up ... lets the dialog appear .
&quot; at the moment , this cannot be changed in the dialog settings . but you can do this manually : &quot;
&quot; open the file $ K@@ DE@@ HOME / share / config / k@@ pag@@ err@@ c with any text editor like e.g. &amp; ke@@ dit , or vi@@ . if you do not have any write permission for the file , you must log in as user root or apply to your system administrator . &quot;
&quot; as &amp; K@@ p@@ ager , part of the package k@@ de@@ base , you will need a working installation of the K@@ DE basic packages . &quot;

&quot; this application is interesting for different users : this includes artists , web designers and people with visual imp@@ airment . this documentation should be a complete manual for the use of &amp; k@@ mag . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mag ; is a very powerful application , which is constantly expanded to include new functions . it is optimized for use on high @-@ performance machines . &quot;
&quot; when you go &amp; k@@ mag ; a window appears as shown above . the main window of &amp; k@@ mag ; displays the enlarged area of the screen . in the following , this window appears as a magni@@ fying window and is described below as a selection window . &quot;
&quot; in the default setting , &amp; k@@ mag ; the area around the mouse poin@@ ter like a mo@@ vable lou@@ pe . alternatively , you can &amp; k@@ mag ; to display a selected screen area in the magni@@ fying window ( sel@@ ector mode ) or the surroundings of the mouse poin@@ ter at the screen ( eg ; on the left side of the screen ) . &quot;
&quot; if you want to avoid that the mouse poin@@ ter is displayed in the enlarged window , select the mouse poin@@ ter . please note that the mouse poin@@ ter is not able to recognize the shape of the mouse poin@@ ter . this is always the default k@@ de ; / Q@@ t ; -@@ Mouse poin@@ ter . &quot;
in the drop @-@ down mode you can adjust the selection window to your own needs . you can move it with the arrow and mouse buttons and change its size . this can be done in the following way :
&quot; move the mouse poin@@ ter in the magni@@ fying window and hold the left mouse button pressed , so you can capture and move the contents of the magni@@ fying window . this also goes with the arrow keys . &quot;
&quot; if you additionally hold the Shift + Shift + Shift , or use the &amp; M@@ MB ; you can move the selection window . &quot;
&quot; with this combination , you can change the size of the selection window . note that the upper left corner of the selection window remains firmly fixed and only the lower right corner is to move . &quot;
&quot; you can send the enlarged picture directly to the printer , save it into a file , copy it into the clip@@ board ( to insert it later to other applications ) , rotate the image and much more . &quot;
start or stop the update of the display . stopping the update causes the required CPU time to go against 0 .

&quot; &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; em@@ ulates a mouse click , as soon as the cur@@ sor goes for a while at the same place . it is meant to help people suffering from R@@ SI &apos;s syndrome ( Rep@@ eti@@ tive Stra@@ in In@@ jury Syndrome ) and who each mouse @-@ click pain prepar@@ es . &quot;
&quot; &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; em@@ ulates a mouse click , as soon as the mouse cur@@ sor goes for a while at the same place . it is meant to help people who suffer from the Rep@@ eti@@ tive Stra@@ in In@@ jury ( R@@ SI ) syndrome and to whom any mouse @-@ click pain prepar@@ es . however , this requires a little exercise . &quot;
&quot; &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; can handle the pain caused by clicking the mouse and helps so many people to use the computer without pain . unfortunately , you may also consult a doctor if this has not happened yet . &quot;
&quot; to clarify it again : even if &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; avoid pain caused by clicking with the mouse , it is useless against pain caused by the mouse because of the mouse . and as with all ergonomic aids , the result can be different for everyone . &quot;
the use of &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; is simple : &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; monitors your mouse movements and performs a mouse click once you break the movement briefly .
&quot; move the mouse , wait until the end of the movement before releasing the mouse button . &quot;
&quot; this delay time must be stored after the end of the mouse movement , before &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; a mouse click . &quot;
&quot; if Intel@@ lig@@ ently Move is enabled , the shift time ( 1 / 10 s ) is active . here , the time is set , the &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; after supp@@ ressing the mouse button wait before it takes the mouse button again , if there is no exit of the mouse . &quot;
&quot; this function activ@@ ates , generates a slow moving to the right and back , followed by a pause , a click with the right mouse button . a slow moving to the left and back leads a double click . this moves will be saved in the file $ K@@ DE@@ HOME / share / config / km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool _ stro@@ k@@ es.@@ txt , but they can be changed later . &quot;
&quot; if the sound is delayed , you can &amp; k@@ de ; move the response time to sh@@ orten the response time . &quot;
&quot; this setting is selected , &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; at any start of &amp; k@@ de ; at the moment , this function is only available under &amp; k@@ de ; this function is currently only available under &amp; k@@ de ; please consult the respective documentation to find out how to start a program automatically . &quot;
&quot; if you already press the button App@@ ly , the settings will be reset to the last pressing of users . &quot;
&quot; best use &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; first with the default settings . in particular , the smart move should be switched off first . if you get used to the automatic mouse click , you can later take the smart move . &quot;
&quot; if you use the audi@@ ble click , it is necessary to reduce the response times of &amp; k@@ de ; reduce sounds . &quot;
&quot; first , you should be aware of which places a mouse click will remain without effect : clicking on the neutral components of windows or in the browser window , which does not represent a link , does not lead to unwanted reactions . you can therefore park the mouse at such places until you want to use them again . &quot;
&quot; when your mouse bu@@ cks , you should clean your mouse . it &apos;s usually pretty simple . the trick is that you don &apos;t just clean the mouse ball , but also the roles that come into contact with the mouse ball . &quot;
&quot; first you have to remove the mouse ball . as this happens , mouse to mouse is different . however , it should be clear if you look at the under@@ side of the mouse . &quot;
&quot; if you have removed the ball , you would have to see the rolls . these are located on the sides of the hole in which the ball was used . you can easily scra@@ pe it with a flat blade or f@@ ing@@ ern@@ ail . &quot;
&quot; in very rare situations , the operating system inter@@ rup@@ ts the execution of &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; if you use an im@@ position in this case , it means that &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; the operation is no longer termin@@ ated by letting the mouse button end . &quot;
this happens if you use &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; use under another window manager and move a window .
&quot; the solution for this problem is that you can execute a mouse click yourself . by doing so , the status of &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; reset and you can continue to work as usual . &quot;
&quot; problem : if you enter text , try &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; continue to execute mouse clicks and set the cur@@ sor to another place . &quot;
&quot; solution : use the mouse to place the cur@@ sor to place where you want to have it . however , you can use the mouse on a neutral zone of the desktop when you want to make a key feature . secure zones for the mouse poin@@ ter are &amp; eg ; the grey areas around the tool@@ bars and menus and the head@@ lines of windows . &quot;
&quot; I try to work with the intelligent shift , but I don &apos;t manage to edit text . &quot;
&quot; the intelligent shift is an advanced feature of &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; and it takes its time before you can handle it . it is very likely to use text to copy it to the clip@@ board , or to execute any other action in which you want to move the mouse with pressed mouse button . here are some advice : &quot;
&quot; do not use the smart move if you just start using it &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; instead , select text instead : run a mouse click at one end of the text area and hold the Shift key , while you move the mouse poin@@ ter to the other end of the text and press the mouse button again . &quot;
&quot; use the audi@@ ble mouse click . this way , whenever &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; the mouse button expresses a sound like a mouse click . &quot;
&quot; to use &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; to use , the X@@ Test extension has to be installed for &amp; X Window ; this should already be the case on most systems . &quot;
the functionality of the audi@@ ble mouse click is only available when the system has a sound card and speakers and are set up correctly .
&amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; activ@@ ates the mouse button as soon as the mouse cur@@ sor goes short . this program has been developed for people who suffer from R@@ SI &apos;s syndrome and which the an@@ tigen of the mu@@ sta@@ sten pain prepar@@ es .
&quot; &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; can also be configured to make it a particular time waiting for a drag process starts before the mouse button is released . in this way , the drag and drop can be performed using the mouse . &quot;

&amp; k@@ mouth ; is a program that can let the dum@@ b user talk to their computers for themselves .
&quot; with the program &amp; k@@ mouth , dum@@ b users can let the computer speak for themselves . the user can choose from a list of the conversation course phrases that are to be spoken again . &quot;
&quot; on the first page of the wiz@@ ard ( left screen@@ shot ) , enter the command that will be used later for the voice output of text . further details can be found in the description of the setup dialog . &quot;
&quot; on the second page , select the default text pass@@ age@@ text@@ book . from the text passages , you can often select used text passages without having to type them . the passages can of course be edited . &quot;
&quot; on the third side ( right screen@@ shot ) you determine the dictionary for the Wor@@ ter@@ gän@@ ger . &amp; k@@ mouth ; reads the K@@ DE documentation of the chosen language to determine the frequency of the individual words . in addition , you can compare the word@@ lists with an Open@@ Offic@@ e.org dictionary , so that only properly letter words can be recorded in the word of words . &quot;
the main window of &amp; k@@ mouth ; is clear and contains essentially an input field for the keyboard input of your sentences ( the lower white field in the screen@@ shot ) and a circul@@ ating memory of the already spoken sentences ( the upper white field in the screen@@ shot ) .
&quot; if you have k@@ mouth ; correctly set up , you can enter the sets that you want to hear in the input field . every spoken sentence is attached to the default memory . you can select from these phrases that are to be spoken again . &quot;
&quot; with the menu entry Settings k@@ mouth ; set up ... open the Settings dialog from &amp; k@@ mouth ; this dialog contains two card cards , voice output and settings , the side of Wor@@ th and the page K@@ TT@@ SD language service . &quot;
&quot; in the input field of the card @-@ card voice output , enter the command to call the language generator . in the drop @-@ down field below the input field , specify the character enco@@ ding , with the text passed on to the voice generator . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mouth ; knows two ways to pass on the text . select the check box , if the text is to be passed on to the language generator as default . &quot;
&quot; if the check box is not selected , the text is passed as parameter . you can use the following plac@@ eholders : &quot;
&quot; of course , the command for voice output depends on your language generator . this command can be found in the documentation for your language generator . &quot;
&quot; if this is successful , the further settings on this page will be ignored . the kt@@ s@@ d language service is a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ D@@ äm@@ on , the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ applications are a standardized interface for voice output and which is currently being developed in SV@@ N . the choice of this option is useful even if K@@ TT@@ SD is not installed . &quot;
&quot; with the first selective field of action after selecting a text passage , you determine which action is triggered by the short@@ cut short@@ cut or by choosing a text passage in the text@@ book menu or in the list for text pass@@ code books . &quot;
&quot; with the choice of instant pron@@ unciation , the selected text passage is directly spoken and additionally inserted into the circulation buffer . with the selection of In the input field , the selected text passage will initially only be entered into the input field . &quot;
&quot; with the second selection box closing the editing window for text password manual , you can determine whether the text password will be saved automatically when closing the edit window . &quot;
&quot; when you choose to save a text password , the book is stored . if you choose to disc@@ ard changes , the text@@ book password will not be saved . select Before saving , becomes &amp; k@@ mouth ; ask if the text password is to be saved . &quot;
&quot; the Wor@@ ter@@ gän@@ ger page contains a list of dic@@ tion@@ aries for the word translation . in the main window next to the input field shows &amp; k@@ mouth ; a selection box , if this list contains more than one dictionary . with this selection box , you can choose the currently used dictionary for word translation . &quot;
&quot; with buttons on the right side of the page you can delete or add dic@@ tion@@ aries , change the order of the books or export them to a file . below the list , you can select the language for the dictionary in the input field . &quot;
&quot; select the language you want for this source ; &amp; k@@ mouth ; then reads the &amp; k@@ mouth ; documentation . the frequency of the individual words is simply retri@@ eved by counting the occurrence . additionally , you can compare the word@@ list with an Open@@ Offic@@ e.org dictionary to insert only correctly written words into the new dictionary . &quot;
&quot; with this option you can merge the available dic@@ tion@@ aries . &amp; k@@ mouth ; then ask which dic@@ tion@@ aries are merged , and how they should be wei@@ ghted . &quot;
&quot; this option allows you to create a new , empty dictionary with no entries . as &amp; k@@ mouth ; newly typ@@ ed words automatically add into the dictionary , you can create a dictionary with your vocabulary over time . &quot;
&quot; the main area of the window for editing of text passages is divided into two . in the upper part , the text@@ books are represented as tree structure . &quot;
&quot; in the bottom part you can edit a selected item . if you have selected a text passage , you can change the text passage or the associated short@@ cut . if you have selected a text password , you can only change its name . &quot;
&quot; add actions like new text passages or books or delete selected text passages and books , either via the selection in the menu bar , in the tool@@ bar or via a drop @-@ down menu . &quot;
&quot; you can change the order of text passages or text passages by drag@@ ging the mouse to the new location , or with the arrow keys and the &amp; Alt ; button . &quot;
&quot; the selected text is cut out and copied to the clip@@ board . if a text section is selected in the input field , it is used , otherwise the selected ranges of the circulation buffer . &quot;
&quot; the selected text is copied to the clip@@ board . if a text section is selected in the input field , it is used , otherwise the selected portions of the circulation buffer . &quot;
&quot; the currently active movement is spoken . if the text is in the input field , it is used otherwise , otherwise the selected pro@@ positions of the outlet memory . &quot;
&quot; if this menu entry is crossed , a sli@@ dable tool@@ bar is displayed with buttons for frequently used commands . the tool@@ bar is set by default via the editing window directly under the menu bar . by clicking on the hat@@ ched left side and drag@@ ging the tool@@ bar can be moved to another place . &quot;
&quot; if this menu entry is crossed , a narrow strip is displayed in the lower part of the main window with hints about the state of &amp; k@@ mouth ; displayed if not crossed , this status bar is hidden . &quot;
&quot; if this menu entry is crossed , a sli@@ dable list for text pass@@ code books is displayed with entries . by default , the tool@@ bar is placed directly under the tool@@ bar . by clicking on the hat@@ ched left side and drag@@ ging the tool@@ bar can be moved to another place . &quot;
&quot; you probably have not entered the command for voice output properly or not completely . open Settings k@@ mouth ; set up Settings ... , open the page General Settings and enter the command for voice output on the map map . ( see Settings dialog for voice synthes@@ iz@@ ers for further details . ) &quot;
&quot; the festival is a language edition of the University of Edinburgh . currently only English , Spanish and Wel@@ sh are supported . &quot;
&quot; to show an example of the command line for setting the voice output , it is assumed that the festival is installed in / usr / local / festival . &quot;
Free@@ T@@ TS is a written language generator . currently he only supports the English pron@@ unciation .
&quot; to show an example of the command line for setting up the voice output , it is assumed that Free@@ T@@ TS is installed in / usr / local / fre@@ aks . the voice output is then possible with one of the three following command examples : &quot;
&quot; for the third example , the option must be turned on as default input . ( this is the recommended example of Free@@ T@@ TS application . ) &quot;
&quot; MB@@ RO@@ LA is a language generator for many languages . it conver@@ ts a list of phon@@ em@@ es into a Wav@@ ed@@ at@@ ei , so you need an additional program to break the text in phon@@ em@@ es . the license allows MB@@ RO@@ LA to use free for non @-@ commercial and non @-@ military applications . &quot;
&quot; in our example , H@@ adi@@ fax is used to convert the German text into phon@@ em@@ es for MB@@ RO@@ LA , assuming that H@@ adi@@ fax and MB@@ RO@@ LA are installed in / usr / local / hadi@@ fax and / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately H@@ adi@@ fax is happy to send the last character of the text , so an additional character must be added . the full command is more complex than in the other examples : &quot;
( cat - ; echo quot ; &amp; quot ; ) _ BAR _ / usr / local / hadi@@ fax / t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o -@@ f _ BAR _ / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA / de@@ 1 / de@@ 1 - / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v ; r@@ m / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v
all parts of the command must be written in a row . the option to send data as default input must be enabled .
&quot; the voice output da@@ emon of &amp; k@@ de ; ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) is a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ further voice service , which provides all &amp; k@@ de ; applications are currently being developed in SV@@ N . it uses modules to support different voice output systems . &quot;
&quot; since the setting of the language generator is only done in the K@@ TT@@ SD , you only have to use possible t@@ ts@@ d as language service in &amp; k@@ mouth ; set . &quot;
&quot; to setup , use the K@@ TT@@ SD language service page , which appears in the Settings dialog by &amp; k@@ mouth ; appears when K@@ TT@@ SD is installed . &quot;
&quot; to use &amp; k@@ mouth ; you need a language generator ( and of course &amp; k@@ de ; 3.@@ x ) . &amp; k@@ mouth ; requires about 15 MB memory ( and additionally memory for the language generator ) , but that depends on the individual from your computer and its configuration . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an application , with the people who cannot speak , print text by the computer . there will be a list of already spoken sentences , which the user can always leave again . &quot;
note that &amp; k@@ mouth ; no voice synthes@@ izer does . on the computer a voice synthes@@ izer must be installed .

&amp; kt@@ ts ; - the voice output system of &amp; k@@ de ; - is a module consisting of modules that allows every application to read text about the &amp; D ; interface .
&quot; &amp; kt@@ ts ; is a sub @-@ system in &amp; k@@ de ; for voice output ( T@@ TS ) . it provides a common application interface for &amp; k@@ de ; program@@ mers , with which their applications can be equipped with T@@ TS capabilities . &quot;
&quot; reading texts ( or parts of them ) in the text editor &amp; k@@ ate ; , even if &amp; k@@ ate ; embedded in other &amp; k@@ de ; applications . &quot;
&quot; the speech output takes place via the speech Dis@@ pat@@ cher program , which uses different background programs such as e@@ Spe@@ ak , festival , &amp; etc . &quot;
allows the creation of language editions on the command line ( or with shell scripts ) via the &amp; q@@ d@@ bus ; utility program .
&quot; in ZU@@ K@@ UN@@ FT : support for voice mark@@ up languages like Vo@@ ic@@ e@@ XML , S@@ able , &amp; Java ; Speech Mark@@ up Language ( J@@ S@@ ML ) , and Speech mark@@ up met@@ a language ( SM@@ ML ) . &quot;
&quot; the voice output service of &amp; k@@ de ; , an application without visible windows , the T@@ TS services via &amp; D@@ Bus ; offers . &quot;
an application with &amp; GUI ; for configuration and installation of kt@@ ts@@ d via kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr in the system section .
a module for the web browser &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; for reading the texts of a website or parts thereof .
a module for the text editor &amp; k@@ ate ; with which a text file can be read completely or partially .
&quot; in addition to the Bug@@ z@@ illa database of &amp; k@@ de ; ( http : / / bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org / ) , you will find discussions about &amp; tre@@ ach ; in the k@@ de @-@ accessibility mail@@ ing@@ list . subscribe to the list at https : / / mail@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org / mail@@ man / list@@ info / k@@ de @-@ accessibility . &quot;
&quot; before marriage can be used , you need to install program speech Dis@@ pat@@ cher and set correctly . see also &quot;
&quot; on the first start of kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr or as long as no speakers are set up , the card reader is displayed . see also . if you have at least one speaker set up , the card card is displayed . &quot;
&quot; most of the T@@ TS synthes@@ iz@@ ers offer different languages and voices , as well as different male or female , or those that differ in volume or speed . &quot;
different speakers for the same synthes@@ izer are comparable to several printers for the same printer .
&quot; if you click on the map @-@ board spokes@@ man in kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr , the card reader is displayed . this will automatically appear when you start kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr and no speaker is set up . &quot;
all already established speakers appear in this list . the preferred speakers will appear in the list above . the top speaker is used for voice output when an application does not give any speaker .
&quot; with a mouse click , select a speaker from the list and click on this button to remove the speaker from the list . &quot;
&quot; with a mouse click , select a speaker from the list and click on this button to change the settings . see below . &quot;
&quot; with a mouse click , select a speaker from the list and click on this button to push the speaker in the list a line further down . the order of the speakers in the list determines also their priority . &quot;
click on one of these buttons to apply your changes to the current &amp; nbsp ; system .
&quot; choose a tuning type here , there are three male and three female voices as well as a boys and girl &apos;s voice . &quot;
&quot; click Edit . to change the settings of this speaker , click Edit . &quot;
&quot; now you can use &amp; kt@@ ts ; already almost use . go back to the card map General and check if language output is enabled ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) , so that the T@@ TS Service of &amp; k@@ de starts . click on the map map orders to create and manage text orders . see . &quot;
&quot; if you have at least one speaker set up , you can start the language output system from &amp; k@@ de ; click on the card player General to open this map map . here you can set some general options . &quot;
&quot; select this check box to activate the product ; this starts the K@@ DE T@@ TS @-@ Service ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) . if this start is successful , the map map will display orders and you can create and read text orders . see . remove the marking , K@@ TT@@ SD is stopped and the T@@ TS system of &amp; k@@ de ; disabled . &quot;
&quot; if kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr is termin@@ ated , exp@@ ires &amp; kt@@ ts ; further , if the field is checked ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) is checked . &quot;
&quot; if this check box is selected and kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr appears automatically in the system area of the control bar , it dis@@ appears once the pre @-@ reading is complete . &quot;
&quot; with the buttons in this row you can start , stop , stop , stop and res@@ ume text orders . &quot;
&quot; with buttons in this row , you can read the current text in the &amp; k@@ de ; clip@@ board or open a text file for preview . you can also change the speaker for an order . &quot;
&quot; click App@@ ly or OK , then all changed settings will be taken on all pages . &quot;
&quot; the card card orders will only appear when K@@ TT@@ SD is started . to launch K@@ TT@@ SD , click the General tab and tick language output ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; , the web browser of &amp; k@@ de ; , you can read the text of the displayed page . then check the text that is to be read , and select Tools Text in the main menu . after a short time , the voice output should start . &quot;
&quot; it is almost always useful to mark the desired text of a website . you can also ski@@ p this step , but then many &amp; HTML ; pre @-@ head@@ lines and other invisible marks are also read . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; k@@ ate ; the extended text editor of &amp; k@@ de ; , you can read the text displayed . then check the text that is to be read , and select Tools Text in the main menu . then the voice output should start . &quot;
&quot; this also works if &amp; k@@ ate ; embedded in other applications , such as &amp; eg ; in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; or in &amp; Qu@@ anta ; &quot;
&quot; K@@ Noti@@ fy is the news system of &amp; k@@ de ; , which noti@@ fies you about events defined by you . you can also read the text of these messages also from &amp; kt@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; Con@@ vers@@ ation ; , the IR@@ C program of &amp; k@@ de ; you can set up various types of messages . you can , for example , set up a message when your nick@@ name appears in an IR@@ C channel . you can then read the IR@@ C news text . &quot;
&quot; support a &amp; k@@ de ; program K@@ Noti@@ fy , appears a menu entry noti@@ fications in the menu settings of this program . the possible settings for K@@ Noti@@ fy differ depending on the application . &quot;
&quot; the file k@@ mail@@ .@@ xml , which belongs to the delivery of &amp; kt@@ ts ; is a good example . it removes the tags br and b from the messages sent by e @-@ mail , and also the expression / local / in@@ box , as it can be assumed in most cases as provided . &quot;
filters are one of the advanced capabilities of the product ; filters are not required for normal work .
&quot; filters are edited text before it is sent to the speech Dis@@ pat@@ cher program . they are useful for improving the pron@@ unciation , to substitute wron@@ g@@ ly spoken words or abbrevi@@ ations , to choose a suitable language and speaker , or to circum@@ vent certain defici@@ encies of language synthes@@ iz@@ ers and their voices . &quot;
&quot; to understand the functioning of filters , it is important to know how the program &apos; speech Dis@@ pat@@ cher &apos; works with a text . &amp; kt@@ ts ; differenti@@ ates four types of texts . &quot;
&quot; the output of screen readers has the highest priority . it is preferred to all other entries and stops these orders . if the output of the screen reader is read , the continued orders will be continued . &quot;
war@@ nings have the next priority . this level is important messages such as &amp; eg ; processor is too hot . a warning has priority and keeps the output of messages and normal text . these orders will be continued after the issue of the warning .
&quot; a message inter@@ rup@@ ts normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example of an application that uses messages . while you &amp; eg ; a long text on a website can be read , you can be with &amp; k@@ mouth ; messages are also messages . read about it . &quot;
&quot; the rest are simple text orders . every order you accept from the map card is a text@@ book . K@@ Say@@ it is an example of a applications that uses text orders . text orders are intended for the edition of longer texts , which do not have any special ur@@ gency . &quot;
&quot; all four order types are processed in queu@@ es , except the output of screen readers . if an application sends the output of a screen reader , while reading ; just one such pre@@ reads , this output will be stopped and finished . &quot;
&quot; first you need to know that filters will never be applied to the output of screen reactions . they are applied to normal war@@ nings , messages and text orders as well as on &amp; k@@ de ; messages . &quot;
filters edit the text and pass it on to the next filter . currently there are three types of filters .
filters are designed as modules . in the future there can be further types of filters .
&quot; string replace parts replace parts of a text by other text . you can supply the parts to be replaced , either as words or as regular expressions . &amp; kt@@ ts ; will be provided with pre@@ defined strings of strings such as : - ) by text or for format@@ ting messages from &amp; conversation ; or &amp; k@@ mail ; in a better understandable form . &quot;
&quot; &amp; XML ; -@@ re@@ formers use X@@ SL@@ T file ( XML ; style Language - Trans@@ forms ) to convert &amp; XML , from a format to another format . included in the scope of delivery ; are some X@@ SL@@ T files to translate &amp; XHTML ; included in SS@@ ML . &quot;
&quot; with spre@@ ader selection filters , you can send orders depending on the content of the text or depending on the program that sent the text to &amp; kt@@ ts ; sent to a speaker for example on the map map speaker , you can read text from K@@ DE messages about it . &quot;
&quot; each of these different filters has adjustable rules , after which it is applied to a voice output . if the filter determines that its rules fail to apply , he will continue the text unchanged to the next filter . &quot;
&quot; if a text order , a message , warning or a &amp; k@@ de ; notification is sent , it is processed by all activated filters that were set up on the bottom . the processing by the filter is done in the order in the list from top to bottom . &quot;
&quot; this shows the list of the set @-@ up normal filters . if a filter is not checked , it is not activated and is not used . &quot;
&quot; click here to insert a new filter . select the type of filter , and you will see the following setup dialog@@ s below . &quot;
&quot; for setting up string composition filters , you must enter a list of words or regular expressions as comparison patterns . if these patterns are found in the text , then the text is exchanged for the corresponding substitute text . &quot;
&quot; enter a name for your filter . you can choose this name as you like , it must only differ from the names of the other filters . &quot;
&quot; this is the list of words and regular expressions . the filter compar@@ es the text with the strings in the column , and replaces it in accordance with the string from the column . the list is processed from top to bottom . &quot;
click here to move the selected word or regular expression in the list .
&quot; with these buttons , you can load a list of words or regular expressions from a file to save or delete the current list . load a list from a file , the entries from the file are attached to the existing list . &quot;
&quot; if a language is entered here , the filter is only applied if the speaker speaks one of the languages mentioned here . click the button to display a list of languages . you can also select multiple languages if you click the &amp; C@@ trl key . &quot;
&quot; if a value is entered here , the filter is only applied if the text comes from one of the specified applications . you can enter multiple programs separated by comm@@ a . example : conversation , k@@ mail &quot;
&quot; the application ID running programs will be provided with the program q@@ d@@ bus ; . the &amp; D@@ Bus ; numbers must be om@@ itted . if for example &amp; q@@ d@@ bus ; the application ID kop@@ ete @-@ 34@@ 32 indicates , you may only be copied . &quot;
&quot; the string replace filter is only applied to the text if all conditions apply in the box Di@@ esen Filter if all the input fields are empty , the filter is applied to all texts . &quot;
&quot; when comparing words , the string substitute filter uses regular expressions in the form \ \ s word \ \ s . words must therefore be limited by separ@@ ators ( spaces ) on both sides . &quot;
&quot; in this manual , you will find no instructions for writing regular expressions . if you have the &amp; k@@ de ; editor &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; expressions can be found in the package k@@ deu@@ ti@@ ls . &quot;
X@@ SL@@ T ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) is a W3@@ C standard for such re@@ forming . it can only be applied to shap@@ ely XML . the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c utility must be installed on your system .
enter the path for the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c . if x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is accessible via the environment variable PAT@@ H also goes x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c .
&quot; for example , you can define texts by k@@ mail from a female voice . see . &quot;
&quot; the speaker is selected by the speaker features that the program prepar@@ es the text to &amp; kt@@ ts ; send , and the properties of the speaker set on the card board speaker . with the speaker selection filter , you can over@@ write the chosen speaker . &quot;
&quot; if a value is entered here , the filter is applied if the text contains the entered regular expression . is installed on your system of the &amp; k@@ de ; editor &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; expressions installed , you can call it by clicking on the button to get help with the input . &quot;
&quot; to achieve faster processing , you should try to anchor the regular expression at the beginning of the string , i.e. , begin the regular expression with &lt; ! &#91; CD@@ ATA &#91; ^ &#93; &#93; &gt; . &quot;
&quot; here you specify the properties of the speaker you want . if the text meets the filter conditions shown above , the speaker is selected , which matches the desired requirements . click the button on the right to show the dialog . &quot;
use these buttons to save or load your voice settings or delete all settings .
the selection filter is only applied to the text when all conditions apply with an entry in the box Di@@ esen filter if applicable . you must apply at least one condition .
&quot; the language edition API , from &amp; k@@ de ; , with the program@@ mer can give their applications T@@ TS capabilities . applications communicate with K@@ TT@@ SD via &amp; D@@ Bus ; . &quot;
&quot; the K@@ TT@@ SD module API , with the voice synthes@@ izer to be added to K@@ TT@@ SD , so that we can use this synthes@@ izer . &quot;
the following section contains a short description of the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ D@@ Bus ; interface of the language edition API of &amp; k@@ de ; . the complete documentation for both AP@@ Is can be found on the k@@ de ; Acces@@ sibility website ( http : / / acc@@ essi@@ bil@@ ity.@@ k@@ de@@ .org ) .

&quot; text of text to read and select a language code as &amp; eg ; en , de &amp; etc ; &quot;
there are even more commands you can use . for a list of all commands you give
&quot; open two &amp; console ; -@@ windows . start t@@ ts@@ d in one window , then kt@@ m@@ gr in the other . &quot;
none of the mentioned speech synthes@@ iz@@ ers support my language . where can I get a synthes@@ izer for my language ?
&quot; I have set up the &amp; HTML ; -@@ XML ; -@@ Re@@ form@@ er@@ filter , but when using the module for festival websites are not read . &quot;
&quot; due to an error in Festival 1.@@ 95 beta , you have to install the ( male British ) voice ra@@ b _ di@@ phone to use SA@@ BLE at all . you also have to do that if you do not use this voice to read web pages . furthermore , make sure that the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is installed and the environment variable PAT@@ H can be found . &quot;
&quot; certain signs or pun@@ ctu@@ ation marks seem to cause bugs in the synthes@@ izer , so that whole sets are ski@@ pped or only ch@@ ew@@ ing cat@@ fish . what can I do against it ? &quot;
&quot; first of all , make sure the option code enco@@ ding is set to the correct value for the corresponding language . if there are problems with certain characters or words , they may be fixed by a string replace filter . see . &quot;

&quot; the language synthes@@ iz@@ ers used by &amp; kt@@ ts have their own license , which you will find in the corresponding documentation or on the websites concerned . there are also voices that have their own license . &quot;
&quot; if you have access to the K@@ DE source code archive , you can select the package with &amp; kt@@ ts ; you can download it in the folder : / / ft@@ p.@@ k@@ de@@ .org / pub / k@@ de / . &quot;
&quot; contains many languages , a list of all currently supported languages on the project site http : / / es@@ pe@@ ak@@ .@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net / langu@@ ag@@ es@@ .html . &quot;
&quot; English , British , Spanish , German , Finnish , Czech , Polish , Russian , Italian , French , Canadian French , Kis@@ w@@ ah@@ ili , Zul@@ u and Ibi@@ z@@ bio . &quot;
KT@@ TS also works with any voice synthes@@ izer that can be launched on the command line in a console .
&quot; the list of languages mentioned above can be incomplete or out@@ dated . therefore , drag the synthes@@ izer description to the supported languages . look also on the website of kt@@ ts ; , for information that are not yet included in this manual . &quot;
&quot; the program &quot; speech Dis@@ pat@@ cher &quot; uses an adap@@ table module architecture for voice synthes@@ iz@@ ers . if you would like to expand it for the use of any other synthes@@ izer , contact the developer team . &quot;
the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c program is used for the support of SS@@ ML and for the &amp; XML ; but it is not mandatory . Debian users can install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c with the apt @-@ get install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c command .
&quot; to compile , you need a current development environment of K@@ DE ( version 3.4 or newer ) including packages k@@ deli@@ bs and the development files for the program &quot; speech Dis@@ pat@@ cher . &quot; &quot;
&quot; if you have downloaded the source code from &amp; kt@@ ts ; you can use the source code archive for you , or downloaded the tar@@ ball every night , compile and install the program with the following commands : &quot;
&quot; before you start working , check whether speech Dis@@ pat@@ cher is working properly with your language synthes@@ izer . to do so , you can use the shell script sp@@ d @-@ conf . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; k@@ de ; 4.4 is the first version of the program , which uses the speech Dis@@ pat@@ cher program . the program kt@@ t@@ ms@@ gr should be developed in such a way that the setup of speech Dis@@ pat@@ cher is possible and the script sp@@ d @-@ conf is no longer needed . &quot;
&quot; a long text is broken down into individual sentences . the user can rep@@ ay pun@@ ctu@@ ation or devi@@ ation , repeat the output or cancel the output . &quot;
&quot; for example , if you have set up a speaker whose language is English and whose gender is female , it will be used , otherwise the best matching speaker is chosen . if you want to learn more about how it is , you will see in . &quot;
&quot; when you click on the map button , click Add to add a speaker to the list or click Edit , the card Card is displayed . as an example , the setup of the module for Festival Interactive is shown below . for details of the modules you will find below . &quot;
&quot; enter the path to the exec@@ utable festival program . if the path to festival in PAT@@ H is included , you only have to enter festival . &quot;
&quot; select the character enco@@ ding for text that is handed over to the festival . in case of quotes , the &amp; kt@@ ts are known , this setting will be made automatically . generally , Western languages use ISO 8859 @-@ 1 , Eastern languages such as Czech or Slovak using ISO 8859 @-@ 2 . &quot;
&quot; this slider allows you to adjust volume , speaking speed and pitch of the synthetic language . if you can &apos;t select some regul@@ ators and display this grey , the voice you choose does not allow you to adjust these settings . &quot;
&quot; some voices like Multi@@ Sy@@ n voices need to be loaded several seconds due to their size . if you mark this check box , these voices are already loaded at the start of K@@ TT@@ SD so that ( with greater memory consumption ) the first set is synthes@@ ized faster . &quot;
&quot; if this check box cannot be selected , you have not yet set up a speaker ( or to click on users ) . &quot;
&quot; if this check box is selected , the program window kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr will be displayed at the start of kt@@ s@@ m@@ gr . otherwise , after starting , only the symbol kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr will appear in the system section , but not the program window . click on the icon in the system section to view the program window . &quot;
&quot; if this check box is selected and kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr does not run , it appears in the system area once K@@ TT@@ SD is reading a text . this allows you to ad@@ here to read or otherwise control the read . &quot;
&quot; here all orders are listed in queu@@ e , along with the application that has set the job , the current status of the order , the number of sets and the currently processed set . the spokes@@ person ID corresponds to the column ID on the card card spokes@@ person . &quot;
&quot; with the buttons in this row , you can proceed from or back in the order that is selected in the list below . ( but not every order consists of several sets ) . &quot;
&quot; with a click on OK , all changes in the settings ( also on the other card cards ) are taken over and kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr is reduced to the symbol in the system section . then click on this icon to display the program window . &quot;
&quot; if the Sound@@ system &amp; arts ; not installed , but instead AL@@ SA , G@@ Stre@@ amer or a@@ Ko@@ de , click on the card card audio . see also . &quot;
&quot; here , only text orders are listed and managed . screen readers , war@@ nings and messages are not displayed . &quot;
&quot; select the type of audio output here . if a component cannot be selected , it has been compiled and compiled ; either without support for the appropriate audio module , or if it does not load the necessary libraries . &quot;
&quot; if you want to use G@@ Stre@@ amer or a@@ Ko@@ de for the audio output , select the audio output . if no output modules are displayed in the list , you need to install at least one module . have you selected AL@@ SA , select the PC@@ M device here . &quot;
&quot; in order to implement these settings , the so@@ x program must be installed . &quot;
click App@@ ly to take over the new settings for the running &amp; running system .
the list of AL@@ SA equipment includes all PC@@ M devices and modules that are set up in your system . most of them will not work . you will need to find out which device works with you . in doubt choose the standard .
&quot; on this map map you can set up special promotions , which are always executed when the text order is interrupted by a message with a higher priority . &quot;
&quot; the output of screen readers has the highest priority . it is preferred to all other entries and stops these orders . after the output of the screen reader has been read , the continued orders will be res@@ um@@ ed . &quot;
war@@ nings have the next priority . this level is important messages such as &amp; eg ; processor is too hot . a warning keeps the output of messages and normal text . these orders will be continued after the warning of the warning .
&quot; News have the next priority . a message inter@@ rup@@ ts normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example of an application that speaks out messages . if you let &amp; eg ; just send a long text on a website , you can with &amp; k@@ mouth ; nevertheless welcome someone who just enters the room . &quot;
&quot; a text order is interrupted by a message , warning or the output of a screen reader , adds &amp; kt@@ ts ; audio output to the queu@@ e . &quot;
&quot; this audio file is always played when a normal text order is interrupted . if both introduc@@ tory sounds as well as introduc@@ tory news are active , the introduc@@ tory sound is played before the introduc@@ tory note . &quot;
&quot; the settings on this map are only valid for normal text orders . for messages , war@@ nings and the issues of screen readers , there are no special actions if they are interrupted by a message with a higher priority . &quot;
&quot; to read with &amp; kt@@ ts ; to read K@@ Noti@@ fy messages , start kt@@ s@@ m@@ gr and click noti@@ fications . the card card will be aler@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; select this check box to disable &amp; k@@ de ; disable noti@@ fications . if this setting is not selected , the other settings are disabled and &amp; kt@@ ts ; do not read noti@@ fications . &quot;
&quot; this setting is selected , noti@@ fications in which a sound is played , from &amp; kt@@ ts ; not read . &quot;
&quot; use these buttons to add events to the list or delete from it . if you click on the Add button , a dialog appears in which you can select the application and the event you want to add to the list . &quot;
&quot; this event reads the message , the &amp; Con@@ vers@@ ation ; sent when someone men@@ tions your nick@@ name in an IR@@ C message . &quot;
&quot; all occur@@ ren@@ ces , for which in the list is nothing else specified , are ignored by &amp; kt@@ ts ; ignored . &quot;
&quot; use this drop @-@ down sel@@ ector to specify what , if an event arrives , you have the following choices : &quot;
&quot; if you have selected user @-@ defined text , type the text you want . you can use the following plac@@ eholders : &quot;
&quot; you can enter the properties of the desired speaker here . default sel@@ ects the speaker , which is displayed on the list on the map map speaker as the top entry . see also . &quot;
&quot; note that there are three levels for events . if there is an action for a specific event , the action will be executed . otherwise , the action will be executed for all other events of the particular application . &quot;
the event All noti@@ fications for the Application Standard ( all other events may not be deleted from the list ) . for this you can specify the default noti@@ fications as follows :
&quot; use the Save button to save the settings for noti@@ fications in a file . the loaded events are merged with the events in the list . if you want to start with an empty list , click Del@@ ete . all entries except all noti@@ fications are deleted . &quot;
&quot; the Speech Syn@@ thesis Mark@@ up Language ( SS@@ ML ) is a W3@@ C standard to mark text for voice output , speaking speed , volume , gender , voice and pitch . &quot;
currently being supported &amp; kt@@ ts ; SS@@ ML only partly and only in basic functions . the following restrictions exist :
&quot; you have to install the ra@@ b _ di@@ phone voice ( UK male ) , since this is the standard voice to use the festival in the output of SS@@ ML . &quot;
&quot; if the settings for speed or pitch in the festival configuration dialog are not set to 100@@ nbsp ; % , SS@@ ML text is usually spoken very mon@@ oton@@ ously . &quot;

&quot; there are two types of filters - normal filters and set limit recognition filters ( SD@@ B filters ) . SB@@ Ds do not contain text into single sets . thus , you can also start or stop orders starting from the first set , even if the voice synthes@@ izer does not support this directly . &quot;
&quot; here you can see the set limit recognition filter . at the first start of &amp; kt@@ ts ; a set @-@ of @-@ line recognition filter is set up automatically . you can change its settings or add more set limits , but beginners will get away from it . &quot;
&quot; the simpl@@ est way to learn the device selection by trying . switch off the selection selection and specify text to read . switch off the speaker selection , change some features and check how the speaker &apos;s choice is set up . you must naturally have more than one speaker , otherwise the filter is in@@ effective . &quot;
&quot; if you want to start reading this article , you &apos;ll be asked if you want to send us an email . &quot;
&quot; you can then stop or cancel text orders on the map map , even if the language synthes@@ izer does not support this function . &quot;
&quot; for these reasons , the normal rate limit recognition filter is automatically set up if you start kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr for the first time . it can not be switched off , only removed . do not change anything in this filter unless you know what you are doing . &quot;
stat@@ ute recognition filters compare text with a regular expression for pun@@ ctu@@ ation and add a tab@@ lat@@ ator character ( dec@@ im@@ al code 8 ) at the pun@@ ctu@@ ation limits ( tab@@ ul@@ ators are automatically removed from the text ) . note that the standard set limit recognition filter re@@ tains the character set .
&quot; S@@ BD filters are never used on &amp; k@@ de ; messages ( k@@ ert ) , war@@ nings , messages or the output of screen reactions . &quot;
&quot; if you have removed from compare the normal rate recognition filter , you can insert it again by loading the standard _ sb@@ dr@@ c file contained in &amp; kt@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; on the card selection menu , you can over@@ write the Spe@@ aker Settings for the application . &quot;
use of the standard speaker ( the top on the card card spokes@@ person ) . in other words : there will be no talk properties .
&quot; if you do not delete or edit the settings of the speaker , select the speaker . otherwise , select the speaker , closest to the originally set @-@ up features . &quot;
select the method to enter the desired voice characteristics by clicking on one of the selection buttons .
&quot; select the properties of the desired speaker here . if this feature does not play a role , do not enter anything . &quot;
select this check box if the property should have priority over other properties . you can also set several mark@@ ings here .
&quot; since the language is a critical factor in the output of the output , it is always considered as prime property . you will rarely use this feature . the only case you might want to specify the attribute language is before you know that a particular application text is sent in another language than the one in the working environment . &quot;
&quot; to use all the properties in the field of or@@ ator , the most likely to delete the following , click on the standard spokes@@ person button and then use the speaker that is most likely to follow the following . &quot;
in this case 0 is for the last text order in the queu@@ e . you can also specify a order number . ( without order number the input is 0 required ) .
&quot; kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr crashes immediately when it is started . I have compiled Deb@@ ug support , but I do not get back tracking . &quot;
&quot; G@@ Stre@@ amer is crash and &amp; kt@@ ts ; you probably have to register G@@ Stre@@ amer . at G@@ Stre@@ amer 0.@@ 8.@@ x is the command g@@ st @-@ register @-@ 0.8 . if the problem is not solved , a non @-@ compatible version of G@@ Stre@@ amer is probably installed . you can try to update or uninstall G@@ Stre@@ amer . &quot;
&quot; the audio output via AL@@ SA does not work if I listen to music simultaneously with another application . when I hold a text order , a message appears , that says : Un@@ able to open PC@@ M . &quot;
&quot; on your system , the problem is that conflicts occur at AL@@ SA , which prevent simultaneous opening of several PC@@ M devices . for possible solutions , please visit the website of the AL@@ SA project ( d@@ mix ) at www.@@ al@@ sa @-@ proj@@ ect@@ .org . &quot;
I downloaded an additional voice for the festival from the internet . I installed it and can use it in the festival but kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr does not show this voice .
&quot; in the file $ K@@ DE@@ HOME / share / apps / kt@@ ts@@ d / fes@@ tival@@ int / voices , add the new voice . &quot;
&quot; on the card card audio there is a setting speed . in order for this , the program has to be installed so@@ x and can be found above the environment variable PAT@@ H . some synthes@@ iz@@ er@@ mod@@ ul@@ s such as Festival Interactive offer themselves on the map card for speaker setting a setting for speed . depending on the chosen voice , this is active or in@@ active . &quot;
&quot; settings for speaking speed are ignored if &amp; kt@@ ts ; &amp; HTML ; pre@@ reads . ( this is because HTML is converted to SS@@ ML . ) De@@ activate either the filter for converting &amp; HTML ; to &amp; XML ; ( see ) or , if you are quite cour@@ age@@ ous , change the .@@ x@@ s@@ l file of &amp; HTML ; -@@ after SS@@ ML re@@ form@@ er@@ filter , and set up the microphone speed . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t manage to read web pages with a female voice . I set up a female festival speaker , but &amp; kt@@ ts ; reads the web pages with a male voice . &quot;
&quot; at Festival 1.@@ 95 beta , the day SA@@ BLE GEN@@ DER does not seem to work . so that Festival does not produce errors , the x@@ s@@ l file th@@ rows down SS@@ ML to S@@ aber die GEN@@ DER tags . the same also applies to the VO@@ ICE tags . &quot;
&quot; I have added an own string replace filter and now I can move in &amp; kt@@ ts ; no longer set up or go back . on the tab , orders will be shown , the order consist only of one sentence . what do I do wrong ? &quot;
&quot; you may not filter pun@@ ctu@@ ation marks ( point , question mark , call@@ sign , comm@@ a and sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ) . use a filter for these signs instead . &quot;
al@@ sa ( Advanced &amp; Linux ; Sound Architecture ) . al@@ sa is on most systems with &amp; Linux ; already installed . ( www.@@ al@@ sa @-@ proj@@ ect@@ .org )
G@@ Stre@@ amer in version 0.@@ 8.7 or later . note : make sure the modules are registered for G@@ Stre@@ amer by calling the command g@@ st regi@@ sters before using G@@ Stre@@ amer . ( http : / / g@@ stream@@ er.@@ fre@@ ed@@ es@@ kt@@ op@@ .org )
&quot; some users experience in connection with AL@@ SA conflicts in the audio edition . if your system also counts , you can not simultaneously play music and let a text read . &amp; kt@@ ts ; you will also fre@@ eze a text order and then start another . possible solutions for this problem can be found on the website of AL@@ SA ( d@@ mix ) . &quot;
&quot; sorry , this entry is only available in Deutsch . &quot;
&quot; the audio program so@@ x is used for general setting of the microphone speed , but is otherwise not mandatory . Debian users can install so@@ x using the apt @-@ get install so@@ x command . the program is included on most &amp; Linux ; -@@ CDs already included . &quot;
&quot; have you downloaded as tar@@ ball ( with tar s@@ packed archive ) , sign up as a normal user and un@@ zip the tar@@ ball into a suitable folder . switch to this folder and enter the following commands : &quot;

&quot; the following modules for voice synthes@@ iz@@ ers are created by default , some of them have a run@@ time dependen@@ cy of non @-@ free software . ( non @-@ free according to the Debian distribution directives ) . &quot;
&quot; in / opt / k@@ de@@ 3 . if this folder is not listed in the environment variable $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ RS , you must specify --@@ pre@@ fix = target . for example &quot;

&quot; before you &apos;re working , check first if your voice synthes@@ izer works properly . follow the instructions you have received with the synthes@@ izer . &quot;
&quot; Festival is one of the best free T@@ TS synthes@@ izer whose source code is open . the quality of the voices is generally good , and several voices and languages are supported . &quot;
&quot; you have to install at least one language . to do so , you will find in the instructions provided with the festival . if you want to read web pages , you need to install the ( male British ) voice ra@@ b _ di@@ phone . &quot;
&quot; for these voices , you need to compile an additional module , so you need the source code of the festival . the German voices are subject to limitations when passing on . &quot;
&quot; the voice is still in an early stage of development . un@@ zip the software in festival / lib / voices / rus@@ sian / . if you set up the Russian voices , you need to enter the voices MS@@ U _ ru _ N@@ SH _ di@@ phone . select a Cy@@ ril@@ lic ( 8 bit ) enco@@ ding as for example KO@@ I@@ 8 @-@ R . &quot;
&quot; Festival is usually included in the &amp; Linux distri@@ butions . therefore , look for the festival first on the CDs of your distribution . &quot;
&quot; if you want to use the Polish , Hungarian or Czech languages , the enco@@ ding option must be set to ISO 8859 @-@ 2 . &quot;
&quot; if you want to use the Russian voice , the option code must be set to an 8 @-@ bit Cy@@ ril@@ lic such as KO@@ I@@ 8 @-@ R . &quot;
Festival can be used together with the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA and synthes@@ izer . then Festival takes over the lex@@ ical analysis and &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; it generates the audio output . the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; -@@ voices can be downloaded from
note that &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; no complete voice output system is . &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; generates language from Di@@ phone files .
&quot; in this procedure , additional wra@@ pper code is added to the festival to use &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; -@@ voices to voice synthesis . note that the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; -@@ voice files are not installed in the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; folder , but in the festival / lib / . instructions can be found under &quot;
I@@ MS German Festival is a modified version of the German &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA festival ; it is required either Festival version 1.@@ 4.1 or Festival 2.0 ( 1.@@ 95@@ beta ) . first install Festival and &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; then download MS German Festival of
&quot; instructions can be found in the RE@@ A@@ DM@@ E file in the package you have downloaded . ( for use with Festival 2.0 , you will not need to re@@ compile the error correction file , you just need to re @-@ translate the festival ) . then add the following lines to the file festival / lib / sit@@ ein@@ it@@ .@@ sc@@ m . &quot;
&quot; voice location &quot; german _ de@@ 1 _ os &quot; &quot; / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA / de@@ 1 &quot; &quot; German Male , I@@ MS Festival de@@ 1 &quot; &quot; / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA / de@@ 2 &quot; &quot; German Male , I@@ MS Festival de@@ 1 &quot; &quot; / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA / de@@ 3 &quot; &quot; German Female , I@@ MS Festival de@@ 3 &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; on some systems you need to edit / etc / fes@@ tiv@@ al.@@ sc@@ m . just add the lines for your installed German voices . replace the correct path in / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA / . at the time of creating this manual , the German de@@ 4 , de@@ 5 , or de@@ 6 voices do not work with I@@ MS German Festival . &quot;
this procedure uses special code to give the language about festival with a Czech &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; first and install first Festival and &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; and make sure that both work . then download Festival @-@ Czech from
un@@ zip the program with tar to a suitable folder and create the lex@@ icon . the exec@@ utable file must be in your PAT@@ H .

&quot; Festival Lite is a free , qu@@ il@@ ted voice synthes@@ izer that currently supports a limited number of voices and languages . it is a simple voice synthes@@ izer with even sufficient voice quality . &quot;
Fl@@ ite is usually included in the &amp; Linux distri@@ butions . therefore look at the CDs of your distribution as first on the CDs of your distribution .
&quot; the program t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o translat@@ es text into Di@@ phone and the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; language quality is good , but the support is currently limited to a few languages . you can set voice , pitch , speaking speed and volume via kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr . &quot;
download at least one German language file from the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; page and un@@ zip it with un@@ zip to the / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA file .
&quot; copy t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ or@@ c to ~ / .t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ or@@ c or after / etc / t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o , here the rc must be removed at the end of the filename . &quot;
&quot; on the card device selection selection , select a voice and place the paths to &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; and t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o correct . &quot;
&quot; epo@@ s is a free , qu@@ il@@ ted voice synthes@@ izer for the Czech and Slovak language . it is a simple voice synthes@@ izer with even sufficient voice quality . &quot;
&quot; start kt@@ t@@ ms@@ gr . on the map sheet speaker , click Add . select the Czech or Slovak language and epo@@ s T@@ TS language synthes@@ izer . if the epo@@ s do not stand in your PAT@@ H , enter the path to the programs on the map sheet . enter in a box ; epo@@ s -@@ h or say -@@ h to get more information . &quot;
&quot; Free@@ T@@ TS is a free , qu@@ il@@ ted voice synthes@@ izer written in &amp; Java ; i.e. you must install the &amp; Java ; Virtual Machine on your system . with &amp; Java ; can neither pitch pitch , volume nor talk speed . &quot;
&quot; the command module allows you to use &amp; kt@@ ts ; any language synthes@@ izer , which can be controlled in a console , on the command line . &quot;
&quot; preferably , use a command that writes the voice output into a temporary audio file ( wa@@ v ) instead of sending the output directly to the audio device &quot;
&quot; this manual explains the installation and use of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; , a module for the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; to manage network interfaces , routing , and DNS settings . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; allows the user to manage a number of system and desktop settings via a uniform , integrated surface . the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; can be called by selecting K Menu k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; &quot;
&quot; the &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; package was developed to allow users to manage the TCP / IP network settings in the same way , as other settings from the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; create a simple interface for the user : &quot;
&quot; after installation , a new module network settings will be displayed in the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; the module network settings ( k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; ) can be started by selecting k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; Internet &amp; Network network settings in the &amp; K@@ Menu ; &quot;
&quot; it is important to understand that &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; network hardware cannot be installed . physical devices and their drivers need to be installed and configured , so &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; the device at all shows and allows setting of network properties . &quot;
&quot; in most cases , drivers for network hardware and other devices are installed and installed using &amp; Linux ; installed and set up . if network devices are added later , the drivers need to be loaded by adap@@ ting the following files , according to the kernel version : &quot;
&quot; the network settings module will be loaded when the option of network settings in the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; -@@ Index is selected . when starting the module network settings , this attempts to automatically detect the used platform at the system . &quot;
&quot; if the platform cannot be recognized , the choice is offered . it is the platform from the list to choose which is best suited to distribution and release . by selecting the option No @-@ again requests , the definition can be taken permanently . the next start of the network settings will then be set automatically . &quot;
&quot; changing the network settings is only possible in system administration mode . previously , all options are displayed gray , which means that settings can be viewed only , the change is not possible . in system administration mode , you will proceed by clicking the button system administration mode at the right lower end of the module . it is required to enter the password . &quot;
&quot; in the system administration mode , the entire functionality of the module is available . this is divided into three tab@@ s : &quot;
&quot; the network interfaces are used to manage the system &apos;s network devices . all available network devices are displayed . from the network interfaces , the following tasks can be performed : &quot;
&quot; the settings of the network interfaces can be set up by selecting the desired unit in the list and clicking on the button , set up in the dialog box . &quot;
&quot; by default , only basic TCP / IP settings are available . clicking on the button Advanced Settings shows the dialog with further possibilities . &quot;
&quot; with the automatic mode , TCP / IP settings are taken from a D@@ H@@ CP server or BO@@ O@@ TP server . in automatic mode , the TCP / IP settings for the system sends all required TCP / IP information at any system start , so no further setting is required . in the drop @-@ down list , either D@@ H@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP can be selected according to the system . &quot;
&quot; with the selection of manuals , TCP / IP configuration can be made without D@@ H@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP . in the input field IP address , the desired TCP / IP address must be specified . &quot;
&quot; if this setting is selected , the system initi@@ alizes the network interface at boot . if the initi@@ alization is not desired , this option should not be activated . &quot;
the values entered in this dialog are displayed as characteristics of the device in the device list .
&quot; it should be ensured that the IP address in the network is not already used . the input of an existing IP address would lead to a TCP / IP conflict . with ping in the console , you can determine if the requested address is already in use . in doubt , the network administrator should be asked . &quot;
&quot; network devices can be activated or switched off , depending on the need . switch on a switched network device can be activated by selecting from the list and clicking interface . &quot;
&quot; network devices can be activated or switched off , depending on the need . disable a enabled network device can be de@@ activated by selecting from the list and clicking on the interface .... &quot;
&quot; defines the IP address of the host in the local sub@@ net , which convey@@ s the physical connection to remote networks and is used by default to TCP / IP communication with computers in other sub@@ nets . &quot;
&quot; if there is more than one network interface on the computer , the interface must be selected to the network in which the gateway computer is located . &quot;
&quot; a machine with DNS support replaces a full domain name by the appropriate IP address . this is necessary because computer requires only IP addresses . if the computer asks for http : / / www.@@ ein@@ ed@@ om@@ ain@@ .org , DNS replaces this name into an IP address such as 12@@ 3.@@ 45.@@ 67@@ 8.@@ 90 . &quot;
the calcul@@ ator part of the name resolution part of the name resolution allows easy administration of this list . entries can be added , removed or changed . DNS records can be re @-@ arranged by selecting a entry and up or down@@ gra@@ ding in the list with the buttons up or down in priority . &quot;
clicking the button Add ... from the group host to name resolution can be added to a DNS server . it will be added to the New nam@@ eser@@ ver dialog .
first you must enter the IP address of the DNS server and then click the Add button . the entry will then be added to the list .
&quot; from the host machine to the name resolution , select an entry and then click the Edit button . &quot;
&quot; the list of known calcul@@ ators describes machine name @-@ to @-@ IP address references for the TCP / IP sub@@ system . it is primarily used for bo@@ oting , if no DNS servers are available . in small , closed networks it can replace DNS servers . &quot;
&quot; normally , the list of known hosts contains some entries , the &amp; ap@@ os ; loc@@ al@@ host@@ ap@@ os ; and some special IP@@ v@@ 6 addresses . &quot;
enter the IP address of the familiar computer and click Add .... The New Ali@@ as dialog will be displayed .
&quot; enter the name of the well known host and click the Add button . if the known host has several alias names , press the button add several times and enter the other alias name . &quot;
select an entry of a named machine from the list and select Edit ... the dialog Edit machines will be displayed .
&quot; it can be executed one of the following tasks , then by clicking OK the list of static hosts will be updated . &quot;
&quot; the settings made in the module setup are not immediately effective in the system . in order to activate the changes , the following command must be removed . &quot;
the homepage of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; is http : / / k@@ net@@ work@@ conf@@ .@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net from which you can download the latest version of the source code .
for installation of binary distri@@ butions ( usually rpm packages ) it is enough if &amp; k@@ de ; and Q@@ t are installed .
the installation of the ready @-@ compiled version is recommended for less experienced users . it &apos;s easy to download the rpm package and install it in one and console ; with rpm as follows :
&quot; alternatively , a tool can be used with graphical interface such as k@@ package or the installation tool of their distribution . &quot;
&quot; for this case , the installation of Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de ; not , but additionally , the development packages with libraries and other things are needed . &quot;
&quot; this is recommended only to experienced users . however , it is not difficult to compile &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; the following commands should do this . &quot;
&quot; in the first section of this chapter , important information about basic network technology is given ; in the second , all configuration files will be discussed . &quot;
&quot; in this app@@ endi@@ x , only basic information about the integration of the PC into a small ( home ) network will be given . &quot;
IP networks with TCP / IP Version 4 ( IP@@ v@@ 4 ) are currently being operated . IP@@ v@@ 5 has never found great dis@@ sem@@ ination .
&quot; one of the most important information is the knowledge of which IP address is assigned to a network interface . in external networks , on &amp; eg ; the network administrator is the contact point where a valid IP address is given or if available , D@@ H@@ CP can be used . &quot;
&quot; when setting your own small ( home ) network , IP address should be selected from a specific area reserved for this purpose in order to avoid IP address conflicts with the global ( Internet ) network . the addresses from the table below are not for@@ warded on the Internet , therefore any use is possible . &quot;
&quot; of course , access to the Internet can be enabled for such machines by setting up a gat@@ ew@@ ays . &quot;
&quot; for smaller networks , addresses are mostly used in the range from 19@@ 2.@@ 16@@ 8.@@ 1.1 to 19@@ 2.@@ 16@@ 8.@@ 1.@@ 254 . the area is large enough for networks up to 250 computers . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the net@@ mask is usually set to 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.0 , so that all hosts are in the same sub@@ net . &quot;
&quot; some addresses are reserved for special things , 0.0@@ eg ; .0@@ .0 and 12@@ 7.0@@ .0@@ .1 . the first is the so @-@ called standard route , the second is the lo@@ op@@ back address ( loc@@ al@@ host = the own machine ) . the default route is required for the IP @-@ for@@ warding . &quot;
&quot; the 12@@ 7.0@@ .0@@ .1 network address is reserved for IP traffic in the local machine . normally , the address 12@@ 7.0@@ .0@@ .1 is assigned to its own so @-@ called lo@@ op@@ back interface , which works like a closed circle . &quot;
&quot; in this part , the configuration files are affected by &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; and where they are stored in the various distri@@ butions . &quot;
&quot; this file is sometimes changed by DSL connections dynam@@ ically , so that it is not surprising if there is another content as defined in the case of active DSL connections . &quot;
for &amp; Su@@ SE ; it is known that this file is modified by the scripts in Su@@ SE@@ config . another stand than expected can therefore occur .

&quot; &amp; k@@ cr@@ on ; is an application , with which you can let other programs run according to a schedule in the background . it is a graphical interface for the &amp; UNIX ; system program cr@@ on . &quot;
&quot; when starting &amp; k@@ cr@@ on , see a list of already set tasks and associated environment variables . if you use &amp; k@@ cr@@ on ; as root , this will appear both for all users of the system and for system @-@ internal tasks . each folder can be opened and closed . &quot;
&quot; in case of a de@@ activated task , program name and parameter are not displayed and the description appears down@@ lighted . &quot;
&quot; the environment variables appearing here set the otherwise existing environment variables for all tasks specified , except for force . with a de@@ activated variable , the description is de@@ activated . &quot;
&quot; to create a new task , first select the tasks folder . then go to Edit New . alternatively , you can click on the tasks folder with the right mouse button and then select New ... or C@@ trl ; N press . &quot;
&quot; enter the name of the program to be started here . you can either specify a relative or an absolute path name . if you want to search the program first , press select .... &quot;
select the minute ( s ) to which the task should be executed . with &amp; k@@ cr@@ on ; you can specify the minutes in five steps .
&quot; for example , when you select Mon@@ thly Day ( e ) as well as weekday ( s ) , the task will be executed on the 1st and 15th and Sunday , the program will be executed on the 1st and 15th of the selected months independently of the day of the week , and also on every Sunday of the months , no matter what date they fall . &quot;
&quot; as with the creation of new tasks , changes are only active when the c@@ ron@@ tab is stored . &quot;
&quot; to cut out a task , first select the task to remove . then go to edit . &quot;
&quot; alternatively , you can click the right mouse button on the task and select cut out , or press C@@ trl ; X . &quot;
&quot; to copy a task , first select the task to be copied . then go to Edit Copy . &quot;
&quot; alternatively , you can click the right mouse button on the task and select Copy or press C@@ trl ; C . &quot;
&quot; to insert a task , first it must be cut out or copied to the clip@@ board . only then inser@@ tion is available at all . then select the tasks folder . then go to Edit Inser@@ tion . &quot;
&quot; alternatively , you can click with the right mouse button on the tasks folder and select Insert , or you press C@@ trl ; V . &quot;
&quot; to make changes to a job , first select one . then go to the Edit Change menu item .... &quot;
&quot; alternatively , you can click the right mouse button on the task and change ... select , or you press C@@ trl ; O. It will then edit the dialog box where you , as described above , can edit the selected task . &quot;
&quot; to delete a task , select the task you want to delete . then go to Edit Del@@ ete . &quot;
&quot; to enable or disable a task , select it and specify the state with the Edit Activ@@ ation menu item . in@@ active tasks are marked with in@@ active in their description . &quot;
&quot; alternatively , you can click the right mouse button on the task and select En@@ abled . make sure that program name , parameter and description are displayed correctly . &quot;
&quot; to perform a task immediately , select it and then go to Edit Now . &quot;
&quot; to create a new environment variable , first select the variable folder . then go to the Edit New menu item . &quot;
&quot; alternatively , you can click on the variable folder with the right mouse button and select New ... or you press C@@ trl ; N . &quot;
enter the name of the variables . you can also select one from the list of the most commonly used environment variables ; click the arrow next to the field for variable names . these are :
to send e @-@ mails from the exp@@ orting program to another as the normal address
&quot; as with the creation of new variables , changes will only be made when the c@@ ron@@ tab is stored . &quot;
&quot; to cut out a variable , select the variable first . then go to edit . &quot;
&quot; to copy an environment variable , first select the variable to copy . then go to Edit Copy . &quot;
&quot; alternatively , you can click the right mouse button on the variable and select Copy or press C@@ trl ; C . &quot;

&quot; to change a variable , select the variable first . then go to Edit Change .... alternatively you can click with the right mouse button on the variable and change ... select , or you press C@@ trl ; O .@@ It then appears to edit the dialog box , in which you can edit the variable as described above . &quot;
&quot; to delete an environment variable , first select the variable . then go to Edit Del@@ ete . &quot;
&quot; to enable or de@@ activate an environment variable , select it and specify the state with the Edit Activ@@ ation menu item . &quot;
&quot; alternatively , you can use the right mouse button on the variable and select En@@ abled . make sure that name and value of the variables are displayed correctly . &quot;
&quot; if all tasks and environment variables have been entered or changed , you still have to save the c@@ ron@@ tab . &quot;
&quot; alternatively , you can press C@@ trl ; S . changes or supplements to tasks or variables are only active . &quot;
&quot; it appears the default k@@ de ; -@@ print dialog . if you choose out@@ fold , you can see that there are two additional &amp; k@@ cr@@ on ; -@@ specific options in the print dialog . &quot;
prints the c@@ ron@@ tab of all users on the system . this option is only accessible to users who own extended per@@ missions .
&quot; cr@@ on , for example , Vi@@ x@@ ie @-@ cr@@ on . &amp; k@@ cr@@ on ; uses the command c@@ ron@@ tab to change the timet@@ ables of the users . &quot;
&quot; a PO@@ SIX compliant &amp; UNIX ; , for example with gli@@ b@@ c . &amp; k@@ cr@@ on ; uses standard commands of &amp; UNIX ; to experience time and date . &quot;
&quot; the second goal was to answer a question that my wife posed : how much longer does it take , if one sec@@ ures ? &quot;
&quot; before a band can be used , it must be included by &amp; k@@ dat ; this can happen in three ways : &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ dat ; trains the band back and reads the pre @-@ ten@@ se information of the band . recognizes &amp; k@@ dat ; the band does not , you will be asked if the band is to be form@@ atted . &quot;
&quot; recognizes &amp; k@@ dat ; the pre @-@ sp@@ ann , searches for the right index on your disk . if it cannot be found , you &apos;ll be asked if the band index is to be recre@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; everything went smoothly , the symbol for the tape drive changes to indicate that the tape was included . in the status bar , a corresponding message appears . the volume of the tape can now be searched for the tape by fl@@ aps of the entry . &quot;
&quot; before ej@@ ecting the belt , the integration must first be solved . there are three methods to accomplish this : &quot;
the band can now be disc@@ ar@@ ded without any danger .
&quot; before a band of &amp; k@@ dat can be used , it must be form@@ atted by &amp; k@@ dat . &quot;
&quot; tape types need to be form@@ atted before you can be used to save data . this process does not comp@@ ose to the format@@ ting at &amp; k@@ dat ; this process does not match the format before you can be form@@ atted before using the tape . flo@@ ppy disks usually do not require format@@ ting of tape , DAT drives , on the other hand . &quot;
&quot; after entering the band name and the capacity , &amp; k@@ dat ; with the format@@ ting of the strap continues . all data on the tape are lost ! after completion of the format@@ ting process , the tape is automatically integrated and is ready to use . &quot;
&quot; before you start the backup process , you need to select the files to be secured . this can happen in three ways : &quot;
select a file or folder in the local file tree . only this file or folder is saved .
select a backup profile in the tree . only the files specified in the profile are saved .
select files in the local file tree with a tick . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders are saved .
right @-@ click on the local file tree and select in the menu Save ...
&quot; once the backup is initiated , the dialog opens up settings for backup . in this dialog , you can check the selected files and change the settings for backup . &quot;
&quot; if you have confirmed the settings , the dialog appears . the dialog displays the progress of the backup process including data rate and the remaining time . &quot;
select a file or folder in one of the archives in the entry for the drive . it will only be checked the selected file or folder .
select the files in one of the archives in the entry for the tape with a tick . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders are checked .
right @-@ click in one of the archives and select the menu entry ...
&quot; once the test procedure has been started , the dialog appears for verification . in this dialog , you can check your selection and change the work folder for checking . &quot;
&quot; if you have confirmed the settings for the review , the dialog appears to be checked . this dialog shows the progress of the examination process as well as the data throughput and the remaining time . &quot;
&quot; before you can re@@ connect the restore , the files that are to be recovered must be selected . this can be done in two ways : &quot;
select a file or folder in one of the archives that belong to the tape drive entry . only the selected file or sub@@ folder will be restored .
select the files you want from one of the archives with a tick . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders will be restored .
right click on a file or folder in one of the archives and select Rep@@ eat in the menu .
&quot; once the recovery process has been started , the dialog box will appear for recovery . in this dialog , you can once again check your selection and change the work folder for recovery . &quot;
&quot; if you have confirmed the settings for recovery , the dialog will appear again . this dialog shows the progress of the recovery process as well as the data throughput and the remaining time . &quot;
sometimes it turns out to be necessary to recre@@ ate the band index file using the tape content . this process delet@@ es all existing index files for this band . you can create the index on two types of the band :
this creates a backup profile with the currently selected files and the default settings . you can make the following settings for a backup profile :
the current folder where the backup should take place . the list of files to be secured will be automatically updated according to the selected work folder .
&quot; for all folders listed under backup files , only those files are stored that are located on the same file system , such as the folder . folders that are on other file systems can be stored separately under backup files . each entry is viewed by tar regardless of the others . &quot;
&quot; to determine which files have changed since the last incre@@ mental backup , a snap@@ shot file is used . only the files that have changed since then . &quot;
the name of the file used to determine the changes since the last incre@@ mental backup is used .
delete the snap@@ shot file before calling tar . this causes all files to be backed up and a new snap@@ shot file for the next backup is created .
the functionality of buttons files &amp; gt ; lt ; lt ; files were not fully implemented at the time of creating this documentation .
the settings can be set up using the K@@ D@@ at menu item ... in the Settings menu . the following settings can be done :
the complete path to the device file for the tape drive ( normally / dev / tape ) . this path must refer to the non @-@ re@@ winding version of the tape device .
&quot; this setting is active , transmitted &amp; k@@ dat ; before the tape is included , the command is uploaded to the drive . in some drives , this is necessary before reading or writing operations can be performed . &quot;
&quot; the option turned on , try &amp; k@@ dat ; to lock the ej@@ ector at the tape drive . possibly this setting does not work with all tape drives . &quot;
&quot; if the option is enabled , the release will automatically be disc@@ ar@@ ded . do not use this option for flo@@ ppy disks . &quot;
&quot; not all drives support variable block sizes . not all drives support variable block sizes . no matter whether this setting is active or not , you need to share the block size for your tape drive . &quot;
&quot; if &amp; k@@ dat , a tape is form@@ atted , it writes a file to the beginning of the tape . this file should only show a memory block on the tape . the content of the file is composed as follows : &quot;
&quot; ( n Byte ) The band ID . the format of this string is host@@ name : seconds , where host@@ name is the full name of the system on which the tape has been form@@ atted . seconds is the number of seconds that have passed since the epoch in which the tape was form@@ atted . &quot;
the band ID will be used to find a file with the same name in the $ HOME / .@@ k@@ dat file .
&quot; the remaining files on the tape are pure tar archive , which can be directly associated with &amp; GNU ; - tar can run . even other tar versions should function as long as they are not incre@@ mental back@@ ups . &quot;
check the contents of a backup tape . this symbol is only active when a band is involved .
&quot; the program is suitable for inexperienced users who do not know where to get information about your system , or where the system provides the different protocol files . moreover , the system allows for quick access to information about problems that occur on your server . &quot;
&quot; the task of &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; is a simplified representation of the protocol files of your own system . the program is suitable for inexperienced users who do not know where to get information about your system , or where the system puts the different protocol files . &quot;
&quot; in addition , &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; experienced users can provide quick access to information about problems that occur on their server . &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; therefore attempts to provide some advanced functions that allow the protocol files to be filtered and evaluated by certain programs . &quot;
&quot; in the current version 0.@@ 4.1 has &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; a number of useful functions , including : &quot;
&quot; support for many different types of log files , for the format of the Sy@@ slo@@ g server and for Sam@@ ba &quot;
many other functions are also included and are explained in the other chapters of this manual .
&quot; as you see in the following screen@@ shots , &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; functions are available to easily filter and sort the individual protocol lines of a protocol file . the individual options for sorting and filtering are shown in the next chapter of this manual . &quot;
&quot; after the start , it tries to open and k@@ system@@ log ; first the most important protocol file of the system - the system protocol - will open up to you , and it opens instead of a small message window , so you have &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; most likely not with system administrator rights . the protocol files are usually not available in the / var / log file , for the normal user usually no justi@@ fication for reading . &quot;
&quot; you can also use the filter strip to filter according to a selected crit@@ erion , or after input strings . the list of the log lines will now automatically be displayed , so that only log lines will appear next to the filter . in the default setting , a log line will only appear if the string of the filter search engine is contained in one of the columns . &quot;
&quot; you can also select a different entry at this point . the string of the filter search engine will then only be matched with the entries in the corresponding column . for example , in the log file System Protocol , select the column process , so you see &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; all log lines that were sent or created by this process . &quot;
&quot; this option is enabled in the default setting , and helps you to recognize the important protocol lines . &quot;
&quot; if you want to show only a certain process ( for example , in the system protocol or the C@@ ron protocol ) , you can hide the process identification ( PID ) in the process column . this can , for example , be useful if you want to examine the output of a specific command such as the start of the sam@@ ba server . in this case , use filter strip . &quot;
&quot; in addition , you can enable the option to jump to new lines in the main window pop @-@ up menu to display all the new log lines . &quot;
&quot; to use this feature , use the entries in the menu window to open and manage additional sub@@ windows . once you have selected a sub@@ window , select a protocol to display . &quot;
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; has its own website at http : / / k@@ system@@ log@@ .@@ forum @-@ softwar@@ e.@@ or@@ g. D@@ ort you will find further information about the sources of &amp; k@@ system@@ log .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; also find in the following folder des &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Subversion Archives : k@@ system@@ log ; in &amp; k@@ de ; archive
&quot; welcome to the &amp; k@@ de ; System V In@@ it Editor , rather known ( and in the following also named ) as &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; . this section introduces a few concepts and describes what you can do with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v . &quot;
&quot; the V In@@ it system is rapidly becoming a standard for controlling the program starting at startup of the system in the &amp; Linux world . therefore , because it is easier to use , more powerful , and more flexible than the traditional BSD @-@ In@@ it . &quot;
I will not go into historical aspects here ( e.g. because I know nothing about it : - ) .
&quot; the in@@ it binary file is located under / s@@ bin and not under / etc . this is therefore important because maybe someone might try to install a machine on System V In@@ it , without re@@ installing and re @-@ format . that &apos;s why you need to make sure the old In@@ it was removed from there if there was one . &quot;
the Sy@@ s@@ V In@@ it also differs from the BSD In@@ it that the configuration files are located in a sub@@ folder of / etc . this folder is called r@@ c.@@ sy@@ sin@@ it and the following additional folders :
&quot; init@@ .@@ d contains a lot of scripts . basically you need a script for every system service you want to boot from the system or when switching to another run@@ level . system services do not include such things such as set@@ serial , which only once started . such calls may include r@@ c.@@ local . &quot;
&quot; you can also create a r@@ c.@@ serial in / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you want to run a r@@ c.@@ serial in / etc / r@@ c.@@ d , if you want to run a r@@ c.@@ serial in / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you want to do something with the serial port . &quot;
the kernel is searching for different places after the program in@@ it and starts the first one he finds .
the standard run@@ level is entered in / etc / init@@ tab . you should see a line like the following :
&quot; at this point , you can take a look at the second column and probably find that the default run@@ level 3 is . if you want to change it , then you can edit / etc / init@@ tab by hand and change the 3 . &quot;
&quot; but how does it start all the correct scripts ? if you enter ls -@@ l in r@@ c@@ 3.@@ d , then you probably see something like the following : &quot;
&quot; you will notice that there are no real files in this folder . instead , each entry here is a link to one of the scripts in the init@@ .@@ d directory . &quot;
&quot; how to start and stop in@@ it actually system services ? quite simply , each of the scripts is written in such a way that it accepts an argument like start and stop . you can actually start these scripts by hand on the command line : &quot;
&quot; this would stop the htt@@ pd server . in@@ it reads the name , and if a K contains , the script will be called stop . if it contains an S , the script will be called with the start of the argument . &quot;
&quot; some people want to set up a simple way of setting up machines for many purposes . I could have a server run@@ level that lets only htt@@ pd , &amp; sen@@ d@@ mail ; , network &amp; etc ; running . in addition , I could have a user -@@ running level , the &amp; eg ; &amp; k@@ dm ; , network &amp; etc . &quot;
here you learn how to use &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; it should not be very difficult because the program was designed as user @-@ friendly as possible .
using &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; using a mouse or another device is simple to not say tri@@ vial : simply drag an entry from the range of available system services to one of the six run@@ level to start it at this level ( or stop ) .
&quot; you can also move scripts between Run@@ le@@ vel@@ n , or change the position within a level by removing it somewhere else . &quot;
&quot; note : entries are moved if you move them into a new range . in order to just copy them to a new run@@ level , you must explicitly select copying from the Edit menu or from the context menu and enter the target area -- even if the same entry has already existed in the target area of the action . &quot;
&quot; the sorting number of an item can sometimes not be calculated . in such a case , you must edit the sorting numbers of the surrounding entries before you can again try to insert the system service . &quot;
&quot; note : currently , there is no way to restore entries thrown into the recy@@ cle bin . so be careful . &quot;
&quot; you can use the Tab key to enable the different work@@ spaces ( available system services , run@@ level 1 start , run@@ level 1 stop &amp; etc ; ) as well as the cur@@ sor keys to make a selection above or below the previous one . &quot;
&quot; to move an entry to another run@@ level , move it with cutting into the clip@@ board ( you can also use C@@ trl ; X ) and add it to the desired run@@ level with insert ( with C@@ trl ; V ) . &quot;
&quot; to manually change the sorting number or the name of an entry manually , press the input button to switch between different fields . close the dialog by pressing the input button to accept the changes , or press Es@@ c to disc@@ ard the changes . &quot;
&quot; because of the risk of data loss , all entries in the File menu require a confirmation before they are executed . &quot;
&quot; all settings are saved in $ K@@ DE@@ HOME / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ rc . preferences are taken from the global file ( $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ rc ) if it is available . otherwise , they will be restored by &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; otherwise they will be saved in a local k@@ sy@@ sv@@ rc . &quot;
I have experim@@ ented with the standard run@@ le@@ vel@@ n and now the machine is rest@@ art@@ ing constantly . what can I do ?
enter the LI@@ LO -@@ Pro@@ mp@@ t linux single and press the input button to start in single user mode . then edit the file / etc / init@@ tab and change the default run@@ level to a reasonable value ( 3 should normally be fine ) .
&quot; I have some system services with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; designed for running under run@@ level X , but they are not executed . &quot;
&quot; if you are using &amp; Su@@ SE ; or Del@@ ix ( DL@@ D ) , you need to edit additional files in / etc which are only available in these distri@@ butions . please read the details in the manual of the distribution . &quot;
&quot; the way system services are started in these distri@@ butions , simpli@@ fies configuration for proprietary setup programs of these distri@@ butions , but unfortunately no standard . the authors of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; plan an extension of the program for this approach . &quot;
&quot; if you are using a different distribution : please check that all configuration files are present , which are needed by the respective system service ( and whether they are in the correct directory ) . some services ( like &amp; eg ; Apache and htt@@ pd ) are just quit when their configuration files are not present or wrong . &quot;
&quot; the meaning of the &amp; Linux ; -@@ run@@ level varies from distribution to distribution , can even be different from version to version . if you use any other distribution , please send me information about the run@@ level so that this manual can be added to this manual . &quot;
this documentation refers to &amp; k@@ user ; 1.0 . with this program you can manage the users and groups of your system .
&quot; to begin with &amp; k@@ user ; to start , it is sufficient to read the chapter adaptation of &amp; k@@ user ; to read . &quot;
&quot; after you have made changes , you need to save it . either use the corresponding icon of the tool@@ bar or the file entry in the File menu . &quot;
&quot; the main window consists of two card cards , user and user group list . to edit , select the desired user or group with double @-@ click on the entry . it appears the dialog user or group properties . &quot;
&quot; some map cards are displayed only if you have advanced system settings . only if you have enabled wild@@ cards ( quot@@ a ) for users , a card card will be created where you can make individual settings . other card cards appear in the case of Shadow Pass@@ words or for example / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ wd as installed in BSD @-@ Uni@@ xes . &quot;
&quot; the card file password management appears if shadow passwords or , for example , / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ wd as in BSD -@@ Uni@@ xes are installed . &quot;
&quot; this card card only appears if for at least one entry restriction ( quot@@ a ) is enabled and initi@@ alized ( recogni@@ zable by the quot@@ a.@@ user / quot@@ a.@@ group file on the file system ) . here you can change parameters for each user , with the limited space restrictions in KB are : &quot;
these parameters can be set individually for each file system . the current file system is selected by means of the field file system with space limitation selected
&quot; the map sheet group inform@@ s about the group affili@@ ations of the selected user . the standard group to which the user belongs , can be found in the field Pri@@ mary Group . furthermore , the user can be a member in other groups by selecting them in the large field . &quot;
&quot; the Group Dialog features a list of all users . to add a user to the group , select this user in the list . &quot;
&quot; to add a user or group , select Add from the user or group menu or click the right addition button of the tool@@ bar . editing or del@@ eting the selected user or the selected group works analog . &quot;
&quot; with this module you can install the LI@@ LO Boot@@ Manager to add , remove and change the boot password , change the time to the boot of the default operating system , add , remove , change operating systems , remove , change , and more . &quot;
