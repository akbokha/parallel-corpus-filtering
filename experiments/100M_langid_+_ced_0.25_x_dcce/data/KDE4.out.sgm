<seg id="240">DNG The Digital Negative File Format is a royalty-free and open raw image format developed by Adobe Systems. DNG was developed on the TIFF / EP format and is committed to use metadata.</seg>
<seg id="241">"this is possibly one of the reasons why, in 2001, Adobe has introduced its XML-based XMP technology to replace the & quot; Extensible Metadata Platformquot; a mixture of XML and RDF. it is a label technology that allows users to embed their data into a file itself."</seg>
<seg id="242">"many photographers prefer to archive a original of your recording, mostly in the raw format, as it stores metadata separately from the image file. however, it can cause problems when linking between the metadata file and the image file. therefore, you should consider whether you use DNG as a container and put it together there."</seg>

<seg id="379">"if your image workflow meets all six criteria listed below, you don't have to worry about color management."</seg>
<seg id="380">You are working on a monitor that is calibrated to the sRGB colour space. (see below)</seg>
<seg id="381">"your only other image editions are via e-mail or web, where sRGB is the de-facto standard."</seg>
<seg id="382">"if so sRGB works so well and makes life easier for everyone, why should one use another colour space and need to worry about color management?"</seg>
<seg id="383">"a visual example of the limitation of sRGB compared to the colors we can really see is presented below. it shows a 2-dimensional representation of all colors that we can see, the horseshoe region, and the colours in the sRGB colour space, the triangular region."</seg>
<seg id="384">"if you want to compare the 2-Dimensional representation of sRGB with some larger color spaces, visit Bruce Lindblooms excellent site and click Info and then on Information About RGB working spaces."</seg>
<seg id="385">Do I need to callize my monitor if I decided to work only in sRGB colour space?</seg>
<seg id="386">"yes! whether you are working in a sRGB colour space or not, you need to calliate your monitor as sRGB outputs the circle. if you work as a color space of sRGB, you must either calibrate your monitor to the sRGB standard, use a matching monitor profile or both."</seg>

<seg id="388">"this tool provides five automatic corrections, which can improve a picture in most cases. therefore, use it before attempting any manual editing."</seg>
<seg id="389">"the functions normalize, settle, automatic balances and contrast extend from the menu Corrigation Automatic correction attempt to make the best from your colors. you will need to experiment with these effects to see which works best at your photo."</seg>
<seg id="390">Normalize: this method scaled the luminance values over the entire image so that the darkest point is black and the brightest point is as bright as possible without changing its colour shade. this function is often a gastric correction for pictures that are dark or washed.</seg>
<seg id="391">"this method adjusts the luminosity threshold of the color of the selected image so that the histogram of the intensity channel is as flat as possible. sometimes the comparisons usually produce very good results in improving the contrast of an image, sometimes it also produces trash. it is a very powerful operation that either causes miracles in an image or destroys it."</seg>
<seg id="392">"automatic Compare: this method maximizes the colour range in the red, green and blue channel. it determines the dark and bright border-tones and adjust the red, green and blue channels to the complete histogram range."</seg>
<seg id="393">Contrast: this method improves the contrast and luminosity of the RGB values of an image by moving the lowest and highest values to the greatest possible area and a new jiuspation of all values in between. this is only visible in full-washed pictures and can be a good correction for bad photos.</seg>
<seg id="394">"the white balance from & digikam, is a semi-automatic tool to perform the white balance of a photo."</seg>
<seg id="395">"the whiteness adjustment is slightly restricted because of a colour space with 8-bit per colour. if you can do so too far from the original image, areas with overexposure can occur. if you can perform the white balance in the blank mode, which works in 16-bit mode, your chances of correcting will be better."</seg>
<seg id="396">This tool is based on a white balance algorithm protected by the copyright by Pawel T. Jochny. they start using the menu entry shades of white balance of image processing.</seg>
<seg id="397">"the preview window can be adjusted in size. on the left side you can see both the original image and preview of the target image. the preview will be dynamically adjusted to the tool's settings. if you want to see the original white balance again, it is enough to click on the window."</seg>
<seg id="398">The preview of the target photos has a red marker. the luminance of the pixel under this marker is shown as a vertical line in the histogram.</seg>
<seg id="399">"at the top, a histogram is shown that dynamic changes will change as soon as you change a parameter. this histogram is very helpful, even in well lit images, most pixels are rendered very small luminance values. with a button you can decide whether one of the three colors or your sum is displayed. the sum is called Luminance."</seg>
<seg id="400">"the contrast of your result depends on shadow, saturation and gamma. shadow adjustment lets you improve or dim the shadow details of your photos."</seg>
<seg id="401">"to play anstat with the above controls, you should use the color temperature pipette. press this button and then somewhere on the picture preview to use the selected color to calculate the color temperature of the white balance. in this way, the temperature and green values are set automatically."</seg>
<seg id="402">"in addition, you can set the white balance with the list of presets. the following settings are available:"</seg>
<seg id="403">The overexposure indicator increases the colors when more than one channel of the pixel is overexposed.. you will get the combined result in white balance. this is shown in the preview as a pure indicator and has no effect on the final image.</seg>
<seg id="404">"buttons save as and load exactly this. each setting of the white balance you have set, you can save with a text file and load it later."</seg>
<seg id="405">The Preferences button restores all filter values to its default values and neutral white balance. note that also neutral settings will result in another photo as your original. if you save it will change your original image.</seg>
<seg id="406">"you can set the coding depth per colour channel of the edited image. 8-bit encoding is the widely used JPEG format, 16 bit encoding is better for high-quality images. this coding requires more disk space, computing time and is only available for formats PNG, PNM, TIFF and DNG."</seg>
<seg id="407">This tool opens the same dialog as the editing of raw images. it uses the change and assignment of color profiles. color setting can be done by the subwindow for the brightness. a detailed guide for using color profiles allows you to rate the chapter color management.</seg>
<seg id="408">"another important tool is available in the menu under colors tone corrections. this tool provides an integrated way to adjust multiple color channels simultaneously, allowing you to use it for multiple photos. this is helpful if your camera or scanner always need the same error and you will always need the same correction."</seg>
<seg id="409">"a very powerful option to correct exposure problems is the tool for gradation, that you can find under colors gradation in the menu."</seg>
<seg id="410">"tool colour effects provides four colour effects, a solar simulation effect, a Velvia filter, a neon effect and a edge filter."</seg>
<seg id="411">"in times of chemical processing, solar cell, also called Sabatier, was an effect that emerged when one replaced a partially developed pressure with a short flash light and subsequently inverted the development of the image. the result was a partial negativity of the image. this tool allows you to adjust this interesting effect finely."</seg>
<seg id="412">"intensity controls the solar cell. at approx. 50% intensity, the image shows what is chemically possible."</seg>
<seg id="413">This is an example of the solar simulation effect. the original image is the (1) and that processes the (2). the applied intensity is 30%.</seg>
<seg id="414">"the Vivid-Filter simulates the so-called & quot; Velviaquot; effect. it differs from saturation by making it a stronger contrast effect that makes the colors brilliant and glowing. try it, it beautifies many photos."</seg>
<seg id="415">Velvia is a composition of & quot; Velvet Mediaquot. the name is a composition of & quot; Velvet Mediaquot; and therewith a reference for its smooth picture structure. Velvia offers very saturated color in daylight and high contrasts. Velvia offers very saturated color in daylight and high contrasts.</seg>
<seg id="416">The parameter level controls the brightness of the result and the slider repetitions the strength of the neon light. in large images the filter can relieve the entire CPU for a moment.</seg>
<seg id="417">Digital cameras often have problems with lighting conditions and it is therefore not unusual to change the color contrast and luminosity of the photo. you can preview the different color aspects of your photos with the tools in the menu under colors. all your adjustment can be viewed in the preview. once you are satisfied with the result you use the button Ok and you will be applied.</seg>
<seg id="418">"if you can make a photo in poor lighting conditions, you can get the reverse problem: one too great saturation. also in this case, the tool for brightness / saturation is a good choice to reduce saturation instead of it. if you like the result you can confirm the changes with Ok."</seg>
<seg id="419">"between the complex tool gradation and the simple luminous intensity / contrast / gamma, the tool is set to improve exposure. even if the dialogue with this tool works very complicated, you will need only the area of the slide. concrete the three sliders below the histogram."</seg>
<seg id="420">"the window contains a graph of the intensity values, a histogram, the active channel or the selected area. under the graph three sliders are clicked in and that can be moved to change the intensity values of the image. the left side represents the dark and the right side the bright areas."</seg>
<seg id="421">The easiest way to learn the operation is to shift the controls and watch the image changes.</seg>
<seg id="422">"on the right hand side, the original and preview of the picture can be viewed. the preview will be dynamically updated based on the settings of the image. on the left hand side the following options are available."</seg>
<seg id="423">Scaling: with this selection box you can set whether the histogram is displayed with a linear or logarithmic Y axis. for images of a constant color the linear histogram is dominated by a single pillar. in this case the logarithmic division is more useful.</seg>
<seg id="424">"three knobs: the top for the dark tones, the middle for the bright tones and the bottom for the middle sounds, often called gammaids."</seg>
<seg id="425">"the three color pintes can be used in previewing the original image to automatically adjust the input values of the shadows, medium and bright tones. in addition, there is a button for a fully automatic adjustment."</seg>
<seg id="426">"output values: the output values allow the selection of manual values for each range. there are also two controllers that can be used to change the output values, for example, to create a blemised image as background while seeing something else in the foreground."</seg>
<seg id="427">"automatic: with this button, the image values are automatically set depending on the intensity values of the image."</seg>
<seg id="428">"save as and load: with these buttons, the set values can be stored in the file system and loaded later. for this purpose the Gimp Levels Format is used."</seg>
<seg id="429">"when you use this mode and the three colour pipette, the input values will be automatically readjusted for all shades, means and sun tones. enable the color pipette you want to use and click on the preview of the original image to set the input values of the histogram for red, green, blue and luminance channels."</seg>
<seg id="430">"the overexposure indicator controls all color channels to view overexposed pixels and display the combined result of all channels. this is an indicator, i.e. you get the effect only in the preview and there is no effect on the final result."</seg>
<seg id="431">"below you see an example of the adjustment of the input values applied to the red, green and blue channel of a photo. intensity and alpha channel, as well as the output values are unchanged. the original image is marked with (1) and the corrected picture with (2)."</seg>
<seg id="432">"on the left side, half of the original and the target image will be displayed. the preview will be dynamically updated depending on your settings. on the right hand side the following options are available:"</seg>
<seg id="433">Modified channel: this selection box allows to specify the channel that is modified by the module:</seg>
<seg id="434">"in addition to this box, there are two icons to switch between a linear and a logarithmic view. for images that were recorded with a digital camera, linear mode usually generates a wide beam. in this case the logarithmic mode is used."</seg>
<seg id="435">"for example, if you move a curve part to the right, e.g. the bright sounds, then you can see that these bright tones correspond with darker output blocks and that the associated image pixels become darker."</seg>
<seg id="436">"on the preview of the original photos is a red markings to see. if you want to move this marker on the area you want to change, a suitable line is displayed on the curve that is the original value. create a point on this line and move it up and down until the value is adjusted to your taste."</seg>
<seg id="437">Save as and load: with these buttons you can do exactly this. each curve you have created can be saved in the file system and later loaded. the file format for this is the Gimp curve format.</seg>

<seg id="479">& digitized; provides three different tools for sharpening. each of you has advantages in other areas.</seg>
<seg id="480">"sharpening is a traditional tool for sharpening. it is very fast and easy, but produces, especially in dark areas, grainy images."</seg>
<seg id="481">The algorithm was taken from Gimp and it is copyrighted by Winston Chang.</seg>
<seg id="482">Refocus is probably the best of the three because it really improves the sharpness. it is a little more complicated in its application and has different parameters to adjust.</seg>
<seg id="483">"photos without focus, as well as most digitized images require a correction of sharpness."</seg>
<seg id="484">"in JPEG images, a camera is often used for internal sharpness. in contrast, images in the raw format must always be sharpened while processing."</seg>
<seg id="485">"some scanner addresses a field of sharpness already during the reading of the image. if you disable it, you will get control of your image."</seg>
<seg id="486">"in some situations you can get useful results by sharpening a photo with the sharpness value, which allows you to run sharpening with the menu item."</seg>
<seg id="487">"but you should circumvent this, as the results do not seem very natural: the sharpness raises the sharpness of the edges, but also amplifies the noise. in general, the most useful technique is focusing on sharpening the tool. you can find further information and a comparison of all techniques to focus."</seg>
<seg id="488">Sometimes you have the opposite problem: a picture is too crunchy. the solution to draw the picture a little soft is much easier than it to sharpen. use the tool to mark softening with the menu item Corrigation softening and experiment with some with settings. the preview window on the right side of the dialog shows you the effect on your photo.</seg>
<seg id="489">The filter unsharp masks is a very good tool to remove veils from your photos. a demonstration can be seen here.</seg>
<seg id="490">The original image and preview help to edit the image. the preview window shows the output of the filter with the current settings.</seg>
<seg id="491">"there are two important parameters, the radius and the amount."</seg>
<seg id="492">The radius represents how many pixels are affected by the filter on each side. high-resolution images allow larger radii. you should therefore sharpen pictures best in their final resolution.</seg>
<seg id="493">"the amount represents the percentage between the original and the blurred image, which is added to the original. thus, the strength of the sharpness is set."</seg>
<seg id="494">"the threshold value is a fraction of the maximum RGB value and the difference-amount. thus, it is possible to define a minimum difference between the sounds of the sharpness and therefore avoid beauty errors in faces, skies and water surfaces."</seg>
<seg id="495">"this is an example of the fuzzy masking filter. the original image is the (1) and the edited image the (2). fuzzy masking was applied with radius = 6.0, amount = 0.5 and a threshold value = 0.0."</seg>
<seg id="496">The & digikam tool refocuses on an image by improving the sharpness. it used the copyrighted unfolding filter algorithm of Ernst Lippe.</seg>
<seg id="497">This is a technique called FIR Viennese filtering. this is better approach than trying to sharpen the photo. it uses a technique called FIR Viennese filtering. the traditional technique for sharpening images is the use of a blur mask.</seg>
<seg id="498">"in practice, the circular folding is much better than the auss's fold. the palate's fold has a very long tail, which causes the mathematical result also from the source pixel, which is far from the original pixel, which causes undesirable results."</seg>
<seg id="499">"circular sharpness: this is the radius of circular cleavage. it is the most important parameter for using this module. for most pictures, the default value should result in good results."</seg>
<seg id="500">Correlation: an increase in correlation may help reduce artifacts. the correlation can be chosen from 0-1. useful values are 0.5 and the values near 1; & eg; 0.95 and 0.99. a high value for the correlation reduces the sharpening effect of the module.</seg>
<seg id="501">"noise filter: an increase in the noise filter can help you reduce artifacts. the filter can take values of 0-1. however, values higher than 0.1 are rarely helpful. if the noise filter is too low, & eg; 0 the image quality is very bad. a useful value is 0.03. a high value will still further pollute the image."</seg>
<seg id="502">"use this parameter if your sharpness is' gauge '. in most cases, you should set this value to 0 to avoid annoying artifacts. if you use a value unequal zero, you may need to increase the correlation and / or the noise filter."</seg>
<seg id="503">"matrix size: this value determines the size of the transformation matrix. an increase in the matrices size can produce good results, especially if you select large values for the circle-shaped sharpness or the gauge of the sharpness. in most cases, you should choose a value in the range of 3-10."</seg>
<seg id="504">Saving as and loading buttons are used precisely for this purpose. any refocus parameter you have set will be saved for later and can then be loaded.</seg>
<seg id="505">"try to perform all the trimming, color and intensity corrections on the image before using the module."</seg>
<seg id="506">"otherwise, you should use the module before you change the image otherwise. the reason for this is that much operations changes that are not immediately visible, but they later leave unpleasurable artefacts."</seg>
<seg id="507">"if you read and compress images, & eg; as JPEG, you should apply the module to the uncompressed image."</seg>
<seg id="508">"generally, fuzzy masking produces better results than sharpness. this could be caused by the fuzzy masking to use a larger neighborhood as sharpening."</seg>
<seg id="509">"in theory, fuzzy masking must always produce artefacts. even under optimal conditions, it can never remove the effect of the sharpness. for the Viennese filter it is always at least as good as the sharpness mask. the FIR Viennese filter is often better when processing small details."</seg>
<seg id="510">"below you can see a comparison between different filters, applied on a small unfocused picture:"</seg>
<seg id="511">This image has to be corrected with an analog camera. the unfocused result is due to insufficient light for the auto focus lens.</seg>
<seg id="512">"for more information on the field correction methods in digital images, you can read a technical comparison in English at this address."</seg>
<seg id="513">The regulator smooths the sharpness of the area that has been darkened so as to create a more natural pupil.</seg>
<seg id="514">"if you want blue eyes instead of dark ones, you can set it here."</seg>
<seg id="515">The tool image error correction is one of the most developed tools to remove unwanted artefacts with unprecedented speed.</seg>
<seg id="516">The InDesign algorithm was developed by IMAGE team of the Grec CNRS laboratory in Caen / France and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="517">This tool includes various presets as starting points to simplify the restoration. the default presets are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="518">"if you want to adjust the filter settings, you can use the tab smoothing and advanced settings."</seg>
<seg id="519">"detail maintenance p [0, 100]: this controls the preservation of the details. a small value leads to an even smoothness over the image. a small value leads to an even smoothness over the image. a value of 0.9 should obtain details so that no sharpening should always be subordinated."</seg>
<seg id="520">"direction dependency alpha [0.100]: a small value smoothes evenly in all directions, while a value close to 1 is just one direction. if you have a film granulation or CCD noise will create a high value wave-like pattern. JPEG artefacts are best removed at a value near 1."</seg>
<seg id="521">"smooth [0, 500]: this sets the maximum smoothing factor above ally. p then defines the relative smoothness. therefore, set this value appropriate to the degree of noise in your image."</seg>
<seg id="522">"regularity: [0, 100]: this parameter affects larger structures. the higher this value is set, the more it is smoothed, as it is then difficult to estimate the geometry of the image. even if you want to create a 'van Gogh' Turbulence effect it must be set higher than 3."</seg>
<seg id="523">Repetitions: indicates how often the algorithm is passed through. usually one or two is enough.</seg>
<seg id="524">"angle Step Since [5, 90]: angle-dependent integration of anisotropic alpha. if Alpha is selected small, it should also be chosen small. make sure that small angles create a long runtime. thus, you should choose this value as greatest and acceptable to your needs."</seg>
<seg id="525">"integral stride width [0,1, 10]: integral stride width in pixels. you should set the value smaller 1 to avoid sub-pixel smoothing and never bigger than 2."</seg>
<seg id="526">"linear Interpolation Use: the more to quality you get by choosing this option is only small, but it doubles the runtime. we therefore recommend it to allow it to happen."</seg>
<seg id="527">The save as and load buttons do exactly this. to correct any setting of image errors can be saved in a text file and loaded later.</seg>
<seg id="528">"image errors are comparatively very fast at work. however, it can take a very long time and pull a high CPU load. therefore, you can cancel the calculation at any time with the button termination."</seg>
<seg id="529">"below you can see how image errors can be removed with minor artefacts. the module is used on a photo that was made in Guatemala City with an analog camera. as you see, there is a strange black artefact in the foreground that caused by a bad film shift during the trip. the original image is below (1) to see and the corrected picture below (2)."</seg>
<seg id="530">Die & digikam; noise reduction is a very powerful tool to reduce noise. it uses a copyrighted algorithm by Peter Heckert.</seg>
<seg id="531">"this tool provides selectable image filters to remove spots and other artefacts, e.g. from dust or hair on the lens. it can also be used to remove sensor noise from the camera or Moireacute; -Effects of scanned images from books or magazines."</seg>
<seg id="532">"if you need more information about sensor noise from digital cameras, you can read them in English in this tutorial."</seg>
<seg id="533">The screenshot above shows a typical scene made with a digital camera and a high ISO sensitivity. it shows a grainy noise that can be removed successfully with this tool.</seg>
<seg id="534">"in the following, you will find a complete description of all parameters. in most cases, you only need the subwindow details and Advanced settings may remain with default settings."</seg>
<seg id="535">"radius controls the window size, from 1 (3x3) to 20 (41x41), which is used for the filter. large values increase the time the filter is used per pixel and can be blurred by the image and the color in it is flattened and thus minor faults."</seg>
<seg id="536">"sharpness: controls the field of sharpness. this value sets the pixel spacing. if it is increased, noise levels will be deleted. if the value is too high, the adaptive filter image details cannot be preserved and noise or lubrication will occur again."</seg>
<seg id="537">Edges: controls edge accuracy for the sharpness. this value improves the frequency response of the filter. if it cannot be too strong the entire noise can be removed or noise peaks can occur. set it to a value close to the maximum if you want to remove a weak noise or JPEG artefacts without losing details.</seg>
<seg id="538">Luminance: controls the brightness tolerance of the image. we recommend either color or luminance to change in order to improve an image. these settings do not affect the smoothing process that is controlled by the details settings.</seg>
<seg id="539">Color: controls the color tolerance of the image. we recommend either color or luminance to change to improve a picture. these settings do not affect the smoothing process that is controlled by the details settings.</seg>
<seg id="540">"gamma: controls the gamma tolerance of the image. this value can be used to increase the tolerance values of the darker areas, which are typically harder to use. however, it also pollutes the shadow areas."</seg>
<seg id="541">"absorption: controls the adjustment of the phasenjitter absorption. this value is defined as quickly the adaptive filter radius responds to variations of the luminance. if it is increased, noise and phase jitter appear at the edges. it can remove noise peaks and is the recommended method for it."</seg>
<seg id="542">Store and load: these buttons are used for exactly this purpose. all parameters for noise reduction you have set can be stored in the file system and loaded later.</seg>
<seg id="543">This is an example of how noise reduction can change your life. the original image is marked with (1) and the corrected with (2). the noise reduction was used with default settings.</seg>
<seg id="544">"sometimes, a picture is too crunchy for your purpose. fortunately, the solution to draw the picture a little soft is fortunately much easier than a picture to sharpen. use tool to draw softness with the menu item Corrigate Wisdom and experiment with the smoothness. the preview window on the right side of the dialog shows the effect of this operation on your photo."</seg>
<seg id="545">Die & digikam; Photo Restauration is definitely one of the most widely developed tools to reduce photo artefacts.</seg>
<seg id="546">"this filter for restoration gives you the possibility to remove a lot of unwanted artefacts from your pictures. it is very well adapted to remove Gauß's noise, film granularity, scratches, compression artefacts and local errors that are made in digital, original or subsequently digitalized images."</seg>
<seg id="547">"the same algorithm can be used for color and texture. the texture of the texture is done with another tool, the image error correction. the algorithm for restoration was developed by the IMAGE team of the Grec CNRS labs in Caen / Frannkreich and is part of the CImg project."</seg>
<seg id="548">"reduce JPEG Artefacts: compression of JPEG is not perfect, in some areas even very far away. as a lossy compression algorithm, he generates some compression & quot; artefakteats; - small standards that are in uncompressed picture. this attitude should correct these problems."</seg>
<seg id="549">"the save as and load buttons do exactly this. any setting of photo restoring can be saved in a text file, and later loaded."</seg>
<seg id="550">"photo restoration is comparatively very fast at work. however, it can take a long time and pull a high CPU load. therefore, you can cancel the calculation at any time with the knob button."</seg>

<seg id="562">Linear: all pixels that have a distance of 1 from the pixel block are drawn to the calculation of a bi-linear surface (2-dim) or a group of linear curves (1-dim). these are then used to interpolate the defective pixels in the block.</seg>
<seg id="563">Square: this is the standard filtermethod. all pixels with a distance of 2 or less to pixel block are drawn to calculate a bi-square surface (2-dim) or a group of square curves (1-dim) which is then used to interpolate the pixels in the block.</seg>

<seg id="567">"wide angle lenses, especially those in medium and large photo format, are often not able to illuminate the entire sensor range equally. instead, & quot; vignettierenquot; (shaded) they reduce the corners and edges of the image by enabling the light to achieve the sensor there."</seg>
<seg id="568">"many center filters require a factor 1.5 or 2 in the aperture filter, which means that it is impossible to hold the camera with the hand. wide angle lenses should also be used with center filters, an aperture of f / 16 or smaller because otherwise unsharpening effects are caused by movement."</seg>
<seg id="569">"with the large exposure ranges of today's film and color or grey scale depth of digital cameras and film scanner, it is possible to simulate the effect of a center filter by using an equivalent transformation in a raw image without this filter. the algorithm is protected by John Walker."</seg>
<seg id="570">"with three regulators, you can control the viticular correction filter and with three further exposure of the target image."</seg>
<seg id="571">"density: this parameter controls the degree of light loss at the point of the greatest density the filter. the standard density is 2.0, which allows an optical filter with aperture setting of 1, or randomly a luminosity of 2, unlock the density to compensate for a greater degree of vignetting, reduce it by a small degree."</seg>
<seg id="572">"luminosity, contrast and gamma settings: editing an image with the Vignetting Correction reduces the brightness of the pixels. you need to adjust the exposure of the target image with these options. the controls only provide positive values, as you only have to increase the settings."</seg>

<seg id="594">This is an example of the infra-film effect applied to a landscape photograph from New Zealand. the original image is below (1) and the edited image below (2). the sensitivity of the film was set to ISO 400. higher ISO values create a kind of aura in the top lights.</seg>
<seg id="595">"it is known from classic high-speed films such as the B / W Kodak Tri-X. to increase the sensitivity of the films, the manufacturers mix large silver basins of the emulsion."</seg>
<seg id="596">"if you want this special, gallery-like, roadphotographic, grainy vision specially in your monochrome photos, you have to use this filter."</seg>
<seg id="597">"with the regulator, the ISO sensitivity can be calibrated to control the intensity and granularity of the grains. the default is although often higher values are required to be adjusted to ISO-2400. if you need more grains, you can apply the filter several times."</seg>

<seg id="600">The & digik; filter oil painting gives your digital images a nice appearance like an oil painting. natural pictures and style life are good for this effect.</seg>
<seg id="601">"there are two controls to influence this effect. the upper selects the brush size between one and five. thicker brushes are better suited for large images. flatten controls the smoothness or, viewed from the other side, the hindiness."</seg>
<seg id="602">This is an example of the oil painting effect. the original image is marked with the (1) and the machining is marked with the (2). brush size for this 640 pixel size is 1 and smooths 17.</seg>
<seg id="603">"the & digikam, filter charcoal drawing uses color and intensity gradients to create a carbon sketch. the lines that change the outline in drawing are emphasized. images of their gradients themselves are not ideal for this effect."</seg>
<seg id="604">There are two controllers with a range of 1 to 100 to control this effect. the upper regulator selects the pin size and the lower adjust the contrast (smooth).</seg>
<seg id="605">This is an example of the carbon capture filter. the original image (1) and the modified image (2). the default settings of 30 and 10 were used. the result can be improved by adjusting the intensity value.</seg>
<seg id="606">The & digik; filter engraver shapes your image in 3-D as if it was stamped into wax. it uses an copyright protected algorithm by Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="607">"filter Engraving; Filter engraving is a fast tool to restore your images with a 3-D effect. it works especially well with images with a simple structure, where color is not the most important content. the filter uses the differences between color and intensity to transform the image into a gray, monthful landscape."</seg>
<seg id="608">"the depth allows to adjust the contrast of filtering. a value of 30, corresponds to 10%, is the default setting."</seg>
<seg id="609">This is an example of the engraver filter. the original (1) and the processed image (2). the used depth is 10%.</seg>
<seg id="610">"with this filter group, you can transform a normal photo into an artwork using distortion effects. it uses copyrighted algorithms from Pieter Voloshyn."</seg>

<seg id="628">"if the photo has the wrong orientation, you can bring it through mirrors or turning in the right direction. you can find the tools in the menu Transformieren Rotate or Transformers."</seg>
<seg id="629">Photo blowing is definitely one of the most widely developed tools to enlarge a photo with a minimal loss of image quality.</seg>
<seg id="630">"the big question is, how can you blow up an image and keep the details sharp? how can you zoom in a picture when the limits of resolution are reached? how can you recover the missing information? how can you reinvent or guess the missing information? the CImg algorithm used here makes it a good job. try it and you will see it yourself."</seg>
<seg id="631">"if a photo has the wrong size, you can scale it to the desired size with the tool size. choose to change size change in the menu and specify the target values. the dialog is shown below."</seg>
<seg id="632">"the tool for size change uses a linear interpolation method to approach pixels. if you want to enlarge a small picture with a better quality, then try the tool for blowing."</seg>
<seg id="633">"many image processing programs use a kind of interpolation, e.g. spline interpolation to enlarge a picture. & digikam, uses a further developed approach. the underlying algorithm photo inflats was developed by the IMAGE team of the Grec CNRS labs in Caen / France and is part of the CImg project."</seg>
<seg id="634">You need to tell the tool how to change the size. these settings are available in the tab New size and are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="635">"aspect ratio preserved: if this setting is enabled, the new size will retain the aspect ratio of the original image."</seg>
<seg id="636">"regularity: [0, 100]: this parameter affects larger structures. the higher this value is set, the more it is smoothed, as it is then difficult to estimate the geometry of the image. even if you want to create a 'van Gogh' Turbulence effect it must be set higher than 3."</seg>
<seg id="637">"buttons save as and load are used precisely for this purpose. each indentation for photo magnification can be saved as a text file, and later loaded."</seg>
<seg id="638">"photo inflating is very fast with what it does, but it can take very long and pull a high CPU load. you can cancel the calculation at any time with the knob button."</seg>
<seg id="639">You can see below an example of photo bubbles by enlarging a small color image on the double size. the original is (1) and the enlarged picture (3). the preview (2) is the result of linear standard enlargement.</seg>
<seg id="640">"cutting a photo is not only a frequently carried out operation, but also a frequently underestimated tool to put together an image. in order to trim a photo you simply need to create a picture with the mouse, by pressing the mouse button and pull up the rectangle, then you will see this rectangle then while you move the mouse."</seg>
<seg id="641">"when you release the mouse button again, the area of the photo will be cut off. this gives you a good overview of how your photo will look after cutting. you can change the size of the area to be cut by simply dragging it with the left mouse button."</seg>
<seg id="642">"as soon as you are satisfied with the cut, use the button Der Zucchde button of image editing in the toolbar and the photo is cut (Ctrl; + X). use the entries file Save or Save file under the File menu to save the newly cut photo."</seg>
<seg id="643">"in the preview area, you can change the size of the rectangle by postpone the corners using the mouse. the aspect ratio, which you have defined in the dialog, remains intact."</seg>
<seg id="644">"in the tool To cut the aspect ratio, you can specify orientation as a portrait format or landscape format. in portrait format, the larger value of height and width is assigned to width."</seg>
<seg id="645">"this means that it is always the same regardless of whether you use centimeters, inches or any other physical size. for example, you can see below a list of traditional sizes for photo paper and their aspect ratio."</seg>
<seg id="646">"at the right end of the dialog, there are two buttons to automatically center the selection horizontally or vertically."</seg>
<seg id="647">"in the bottom of the dialog you can use the Max. ratio button to cut the area for cutting to the greatest possible, depending on the chosen ratio and orientation."</seg>
<seg id="648">"cutting the tool according to aspect ratio saves its settings depending on the orientation (horizontal or vertical). if you use the cutting tool the next time, these settings are stored as default values depending on orientation. the changed image dimensions are stored in the EXIF tables, so that the EXIF data will reflect the cut image and not the original image."</seg>
<seg id="649">The settings of the assembling aid allow you to show help in order to better compose your images. these help are:</seg>
<seg id="650">"harmonious triangle: harmonic divisions are based on the principle of similarity. like the third rule, harmonic triangles are a possibility to divide a rectangle in a similarly harmonious triangles on the diagonal."</seg>
<seg id="651">"golden mean: the golden center is a division that is divided into different natural growth patterns, such as the spiral of a Nautilus shell or the flower leaves of a sunflower. it appears in all sorts of things that we feel beautiful."</seg>
<seg id="652">"the golden division is the irrational number 1,618033988... and you have already been used with ancient Egyptians and Greeks used to construct your temples and pyramids. artists and architects used the golden division in all times when you put together your pictures, buildings and even photos to give your creations a natural order and beauty."</seg>
<seg id="653">"the number is derived from Fibonacci sequence 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34 & etc. the resulting divider is 1: 1,618 the golden center. a composition which follows this rule is considered visually harmonious."</seg>
<seg id="654">The golden center provides liquid extra lines if you put together an image. these aids are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="655">"the Golden Spiral will bring you good results for your photos. compared to the third rule, the golden spiral creates a liquid line that can follow the eye through the picture. this kind of composition carries the gaze of the viewer along the line of the spiral and creates a symmetrical visual flow."</seg>
<seg id="656">"another rule is the rectangles of the golden spirals, also called golden rectangles. this rectangles are used to create the golden spiral. this can be a line or different objects."</seg>
<seg id="657">"the Golden Triangles also derive from the golden spirals discussed above. their vertices are the midpoint of the sides of the golden rectangles. note that in contrast to harmonious triangles, golden triangles are no equivalent triangles. diagonal to these lines can place a static object dynamic."</seg>
<seg id="658">"if you use golden triangles to break your frame, you create an effect that is called dynamic symmetry by professional photographers. try to place your image focus on one of the cutting points and other visual information in the triangles. the result is a very attractive composition that you cannot achieve differently."</seg>
<seg id="659">The options Horizontal mirror and mirror mirrors can be used to mirror harmonic divisions.</seg>
<seg id="660">"with the button color you can set the color of the aid lines. if you have a picture with many colors and a high contrast, the relief lines can be invisible. this way you can adjust the color of lines to your current image."</seg>
<seg id="661">The Free Rotation is a tool to rotate an image at any angle.</seg>
<seg id="662">"if you make a photo, then it happens easily that you don't hold the camera right vertically or horizontally. this creates a picture in which things are turned around an angle."</seg>
<seg id="663">Turn your image with the slider angle. the values on this slider are specified in degrees. with the Preferences button you can set the slider to 0 degrees. a preview of the rotation is displayed on the right side of the window. the new dimensions of the image are displayed on the right.</seg>
<seg id="664">"for your help, the Free Rotation module provides a horizontal and a vertical line. move the mouse pointer in the image preview to position the two lines. now adjust it with a pressure on the left mouse button. now adjust the angle as described in previous section."</seg>
<seg id="665">"once you have shot a picture, you will find unwanted triangular holes in the corners. one way to repair it is to use the function transformer trimming from the image processing."</seg>
<seg id="666">An elegant way to trim the image is the Automatic Cut feature. select one of the following options:</seg>
<seg id="667">"the anti-aliasing option smoothes the image a bit after turning. however, note the above warning."</seg>
<seg id="668">All perspectival transformations are performed around a fixed point to the so-called reference point. this point is in the middle of the picture and is represented by a red circle.</seg>
<seg id="669">"to change the perspective, you need to use the red squares at the corners of your image. the preview will then be automatically recomputed. on the right side of the dialog you will find some information which will help you to change the perspective:"</seg>

<seg id="674">Angle left below: shows the current angle in degrees at the lower left corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="675">Angle right down: shows the current angle in degrees at the lower right corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="676">"after adjusting the perspective, the picture is slightly dirty. for a single adjustment this effect is small, but two adjustments generate a double so strong effect and you should avoid it if possible."</seg>
<seg id="677">"after you have adjusted the perspective, you get endless triangular holes at the corners. one way to clean it is to cut the picture with transformer cutting out of the image processing."</seg>
<seg id="678">"this is no rotation, the image is distorted. in other words, a rectangle is transformed into a parallelogram. you can start this module by transforming scissors."</seg>
<seg id="679">"scissors your image by using the horizontal angle and vertical angles. if you click on presets, the angles are reset to zero. a preview of the effect will appear to you and the new dimensions of the target image are displayed on the right of the preview pane."</seg>

<seg id="681">"after you have carried out the shear, the picture becomes a bit blurred. for single shear this effect is usually negligible, but two deposits generate twice as much blurring and therefore you should avoid this."</seg>
<seg id="682">"after sheeting, the image has unbeautiful triangular holes in the corners. one way to eliminate it is to cut the picture with transformer cutting out of the image processing."</seg>
<seg id="683">"it requires a number of libraries and other packages to read and write image formats. the available formats therefore depend on your system and, in some cases, from the way these libraries have been compiled. in most distributions you will be able to edit a large number of image formats with & digikam."</seg>

<seg id="919">"first, enter the title of the title and a description that will contain the HTML file later. on kphotoalbum; HTML sample pages you can see an example for these settings."</seg>
<seg id="920">"next, select whether a & kphotoalbum is to be created; the export file is to be created on the overview page. for more information on export files, please refer to."</seg>
<seg id="921">"finally, you can select which information to be displayed on the HTML pages. this allows you to avoid that information displayed on the viewer can be displayed without a description. for example, all pictures of a party are exported. therefore, you cannot use this setting to hide certain images from certain viewers."</seg>
<seg id="922">"in this field, you can specify how the HTML pages should look like. most settings are unique, which is why not specifically dealt with."</seg>
<seg id="923">"at the bottom of the page you can set various resolutions for the images. this means that those who are viewing your website and have a monitor that supports the maximum resolution 800x600, do not download images, such as a resolution of 1600x1200."</seg>
<seg id="924">"the viewer of your site can change the resolution at any time you have defined. so, it can search your images with low resolution, which results in a lower transmission time, and if it wants to get a larger image, it changes to a higher resolution."</seg>
<seg id="925">"in this setting, set the different folders and the URL where your website is stored."</seg>
<seg id="926">"best choose a base folder for all your HTML files, and a new subfolder for each subsequent set."</seg>
<seg id="927">"first, you need to select the main folder where all your images are stored. this folder will be saved and automatically added to the next time. this allows you to select either a folder or a KDE supported protocol, for example:"</seg>
<seg id="928">"after you have created your images, you can check if they are all visible to viewers. if you choose a URL for the base folder, a web browser, after the pages have been created, should be the folder. otherwise, the web browser will start in the wrong folder."</seg>
<seg id="929">"this is not the subfolder of the current files, but the base folder in which all subfolders are located."</seg>
<seg id="930">"the settings described above have all three to base folders and URLs. in them, a subfolder is created, whose name can be specified in the output folder."</seg>
<seg id="931">"if you are coming together on a family celebration, a meeting in the company, a conference or somewhere else, with other users of & kphotoalbum; you might want to create your images with these. however, if you have already spent a lot of time to compile the images, you have to do with & kphotoalbum; this work will not even make you happen."</seg>
<seg id="932">"with & kphotoalbum, you can export a copy of your images into a .kim file."</seg>
<seg id="933">"there are two different types of .kim files, internal and external."</seg>
<seg id="934">"you can create a .kim file either directly from the File Export menu... or along with HTML pages, see, create. if you create a .kim file together with a HTML file, this will be an external .kim file."</seg>
<seg id="935">"an external .kim file searches the images in two ways. first, it searches for the images that are located in the folder of the .kim file. this is of course only possible if you have created your .kim file using HTML-Export."</seg>
<seg id="936">"in the following, the dialog will be described for exporting images that you can access to the Export menu."</seg>
<seg id="937">The most important option of this dialog is whether it should be internal or external .kim files. there are three choices available to you:</seg>

<seg id="940">"because most of the pictures have already been compressed with JPEG and the XML file itself is very small, it's usually not worth to compress the files. if you want to do so, simply select the Export file option."</seg>
<seg id="941">"the last option of this page is maximum image size. if you send pictures to your friends, you might not want to send the images in full size as the .kim file would otherwise be very big. here you can limit the size by saying that each image should be at most 800 pixels high and wide."</seg>
<seg id="942">"if you import a file with the extension .kim from the web browser or from the File menu file... select, & kPhotoalbum; import the exported database as described in."</seg>
<seg id="943">"the wizard to import consists of four steps. first you need to select which pictures you want to import, then, in which folder the import images are to be copied."</seg>
<seg id="944">"it may be that you personalize the category persons of the file to be imported (if you are a domain), while this category is named in your database. therefore, you will be asked in the third dialog box, which categories of the imported file are to be imported and what categories are in your database."</seg>
<seg id="945">"in the fourth step, you can compare the categories of the file to be imported with the categories of your present database. for example, see the image."</seg>
<seg id="946">"it has to be easy to browse pictures and view: if you look at pictures, you often want to jump inside of different picture groups & mdash; if you want to see pictures of your Italy vacation and discover a picture with your friend on it, you might want to see all the images on which this friend is depicted."</seg>

<seg id="958">"the modules can be called via the menu modules. the modules can and are not described in this manual because they are not part of & kphotoalbum; but they are distributed separately, but most modules have a help page that you can access through the modules themselves."</seg>
<seg id="959">"since the modules of multiple applications are used together among each other, it may be that the modules with & kphotoalbum have been tested. therefore, you should first test new modules with the demo database first before you use it on your own images; Demo data base can be viewed either via the command line &gt; kphotoalbum -Demo &lt; userinput\ &gt; or via the Help menu. don't say I would not have warned you!"</seg>
<seg id="960">"the applications that the modules use via KIPI are very different, so it can be that some modules with & kphotoalbum are not working. this is the disadvantage when sharing features with different applications."</seg>
<seg id="961">"the biggest difference between & kphotoalbum; and other applications that also use KIPI, is that the other applications do not support their images in albums. even though & kphotoalbum; this sort of order is not supported, it simulates the order according to albums so that you can use the functions with & kphotoalbum."</seg>
<seg id="962">"it simulates & kphotoalbum; the current album, which is just the current view, so all the images that show you the picture show at the moment."</seg>

<seg id="1042">"if an image is rendered with only one beam per pixel, various errors can arise. these images often have a moirè patterns or steps in curves and lines, and sometimes details are not shown when they are smaller than a pixel. this effect is called aliasing."</seg>
<seg id="1043">"& Povray; uses a technique called anti-aliasing to reduce the impact of these errors. generally, pictures with this feature are better."</seg>
<seg id="1044">"when you switch off anti-aliasing, computes and connects & Povray; more than one beam per pixel. this technique is super-sampling."</seg>
<seg id="1045">"& Povray; supports two methods of super-sampling. as a standard is an adaptive, non-recursive method; adaptive because the super-sampling is the adjacent pixel. the second method is adaptive-recursive; recursively because each pixel is repeatedly divided and adaptive because the recursion depth depends on the calculated color values."</seg>
<seg id="1046">"if you choose the first method, POV-Ray tracks a beam of pixels. if the difference between the color values to the adjacent pixel exceeds the given threshold, then both pixels are calculated by tracking a certain additional number of pixels with super-sampling. if you set the depth value to 4, a grid of 4x4 is calculated additional points, with a depth value of 5 then 5x5 (25) additional rays each pixel."</seg>
<seg id="1047">"the difference between two pixels is calculated as follows: R 1, g 1 and b 1 are the values for red, green and blue of the first pixel, r 2, g 2 and b 2 are the values for red, green and blue of the second pixel. the difference is then:"</seg>
<seg id="1048">Diff = abs (r 1 -r 2) + abs (g 1 -g 2) + abs (b 1 -b 2)</seg>
<seg id="1049">"the recursive method starts with 4 rays each pixel. if the difference between the color values exceeds the default threshold, then the pixel is divided into 4 sub-pixels, which are individually monitored and checked for further subdivision. the maximum depth of the recursion can be set with the depth value."</seg>
<seg id="1050">"another way to reduce aliasing effect is the generation of noise for the beam process called Jittering. when you switch Jittering, change & Povray; the rays are a tiny amount to avoid regular patterns."</seg>
<seg id="1051">The last setting for quality of renderns is diffuse reflection. this is an experimental feature of & Povray; which computes diffuse light reflection. it takes a long time to calculate a scene with this property.</seg>

<seg id="1663">"the optional AllKeysTo M is used to place all the sounds that this instrument needs to put on the sound with the number M. if your keyboard is not supported for example (GM Patch 127), you can take a drum (e.g. with sound 60) that sounds similar to a gun shot."</seg>
<seg id="1664">"so if a MIDI file is supposed to play a note with Patch 127 (bullet shot), it takes patch 100 (the drum on your keyboard) and plays the sound 60, regardless of which sound is in the MIDI file."</seg>
<seg id="1665">"please note that here is meant with the term drum patch of the patch, with which each tone represents another percussionist instrument (drum, cymbal, maracas & etc;) and not the one with which the sound means the pitch of the always same drum (as some keyboards possess)."</seg>
<seg id="1666">The Keymap section is used to indicate how sounds are displayed on a particular channel or instrument. use is:</seg>
<seg id="1667">"as with the PATCHMAP section, the sequence of lines is very important as well as their presence. so you have to create 128 entries."</seg>
<seg id="1668">You can define several keymaps for each channel and instrument. you only have to use different names in the first line.</seg>
<seg id="1669">Keymaps are mainly used to map sounds on the percussions channel. look for example the included keymaps.</seg>
<seg id="1670">"this section can be used to map some channels to others. for example, if you want to swap the first and second channel, simply make it in the CHANNELMAP section."</seg>
<seg id="1671">"however, these settings are useful for keyboards which have the percussion on a particular channel (General MIDI on channel 10, others need the channels 16 or 9)."</seg>
<seg id="1672">"Midi devices need 16 channels, the CHANNELMAP section has 16 lines, numbered from 0 to 15, based on the following pattern:"</seg>
<seg id="1673">"if you use the Keymap option, the Keymap will be used with the name name for this channel. if you use the ForcePatch option, all events will be ignored to change the patch on this channel. in this case, patch x is always used."</seg>
<seg id="1674">"for example, the ForcePatch option can be useful in order to always use the percussions patch on the percussions channel."</seg>
<seg id="1675">"the value for PitchBenderRatio indicates in which ratio Pitch-Bender events are multiplied. so if a MIDI file sends a pitch-benefit event with the value n, this is converted with the n * (r / 4096) and then forwarded. the value 4096 is used to avoid decimal comma in the map file."</seg>
<seg id="1676">"this setting is needed because GM specifies that a keyboard, which will play a pitch-benefit event with the value 4096, to play a sound higher. unfortunately, try some keyboards to play two tones up to an octave. to find the right value on your keyboard, you need to try a bit with & kmid."</seg>

<seg id="1684">"well, I can't force anyone to use & kmid; but a typical MIDI file needs about 50 KB, while an mp3 file needs 4 MB (a compression ratio of 1: 80) and with a good synthesizer you can also change the individual instruments, the speed & etc. you have control over everything."</seg>

<seg id="2057">"perhaps the most notable extension of & quantaplus; for the normal user, the possibility to add documentation for scripting language or formatting language you like most. therefore, this chapter describes how I create a & PHP; documentation tree for my personal use."</seg>
<seg id="2058">"before you start your own documentation, you might be able to check in & quantaplus; review if someone has done it for you."</seg>
<seg id="2059">There are two parts in this process. first you need to find an existing documentation for formatting / script / etc; language. then you need to create the docx file.</seg>

<seg id="2064">Note that the contents directory is referenced directly to a file (and consequently at the top of the tree view & mdash; folder is displayed!).</seg>
<seg id="2065">"spaces influence nothing, but pay attention to & & lt; characters. these should be replaced by & amp; and & lt; in all & XML; -based & quantaplus; resources are replaced."</seg>

<seg id="2076">"it is possible to work on XML languages that are currently not yet supported by & quantaplus; however, the creation can be time-consuming because hundreds of tag files could be needed in tagXML format. there is the simpler way to convert a DTD automatically into a DTEP package."</seg>

<seg id="2081">"in & quantaplus, there are some key concepts. in order to understand these and full benefits from & quantaplus, one must first familiarize oneself with these fundamental concepts."</seg>
<seg id="2082">"in & quantaplus; the working area is divided into three areas: global, local and project-related. this distinction concerns a number of components in & quantaplus;"</seg>
<seg id="2083">"global elements are stored for everyone, the & quantaplus; using, available. from toolbars about actions is all that is marked as global, in the common folder structure of & quantaplus; saved. this enables the group of administrators to secure various toolbars, actions and patterns in the global tree, which are then available to everyone in a multi-user environment at the system."</seg>
<seg id="2084">Local elements represent a personal collection of web developers for a single user. these are user-specific patterns and toolbars. local elements are stored in the user directory so that they can only use this user personally.</seg>
<seg id="2085">"project-related elements are available only within a specific project. this can be anything from & CSS; -patterns to toolbars with special actions specifically for the files of a particular project. simply said, this is the most constrained size. all elements are stored in the folder tree of the project, which is the common use of special tools and patterns from all employees within the project."</seg>
<seg id="2086">"the & quantaplus; -MDI; consists of several main areas: the Editorpane, the construction mansions, the map guides with information and the toolbars. please check in and for further information on these areas."</seg>
<seg id="2087">"you can click on the right mouse button to get a context menu with the current document matching entries, such as close the current, unloaded, delete or uploading of the document, jump to a bookmarks or execution of CVS commands for the current document."</seg>
<seg id="2088">"right-click on the editing pane will lead to a further contextual menu regarding the edited document contents, such as editing / copy / paste, editing the tags on the mouse pointer or opening the file, if the string below the mouse-cursor is called a file."</seg>

<seg id="2093">"a further possibility of & quantaplus; is the use of templates. almost everything can be a template: images, program parts, a whole website, etc. all possibilities are open to you."</seg>
<seg id="2094">"templates can be divided into three categories depending on which context they are used. global templates are always available, local templates only for the appropriate users and templates in projects are only usable in the project."</seg>

<seg id="2096">"with this view, one shows the internal structure of the active document. by clicking on an element, the cursor in the document is set to the position of the element. by clicking on an element, a list of commands opens in terms of navigation and refreshment of the tree."</seg>

<seg id="2198">Some with & quantaplus; provided templates have conditions for their use. please read the conditions specified at the beginning of each template before use.</seg>

<seg id="2209">The Template structure in the subwindow templates is based on the files placed in $KDEDIR / share / apps / Quanta / templates and $HOME / .kde / share / apps / Quanta / templates.</seg>

<seg id="2216">The VPL; editor works as follows: it loads a document like a normal & HTML; - or & XHTML; -page and a cursor appears.</seg>
<seg id="2217">"when working with the VPL; editor on a document that contains & PHP, a small green symbol shows the default of & PHP; source code. it is not possible to edit this directly to the VPL; to edit & PHP; there is no plans to change this behavior."</seg>

<seg id="2219">The synchronisation distance between the VPL; editor and the source code editor can be set up via Settings Quanta. after choosing VPL; View can be set between synchronization after one click or automatically. in principle the recommendation: a small chip for fast calculator and a large chip for slow.</seg>

<seg id="2224">"using the cursor is possible, as in a text processing, by moving with arrows, possible. under rare circumstances the cursor behaves strange. the marking works as usual. text can be inserted by typing and deleted using callback or Remove button."</seg>
<seg id="2225">"inserting tags is done in the same way via the toolbars, such as in the source code editor. it is worth noting that inserting tags previously already existing identical tags are not removed, e.g. when an anchor tag, surrounded by text, must be removed any other given anchor tag."</seg>

<seg id="2300">"sometimes a file contains several similar functions. if you want to find out how similar these functions are, it would be a relatively big effort. you'd need to create two corresponding files, load them in & kdiff3; then you can simply copy, paste and then compare the relevant sections."</seg>

<seg id="2349">"when reading a file, it will first be handed over to this external command. in & kdiff3; then the output of the command will be visible, and not the file itself. you can write your own preprocessor that exactly suits your needs. you can use this function e.g. for cutting annoying parts or correcting the indentation."</seg>
<seg id="2350">"when reading a file, it will first hand over to this external command (see above), then the output of the command is the input of this command command. you can write your own preprocessor which exactly meets your requirements. each input line must have a corresponding output line."</seg>
<seg id="2351">"the idea behind it is to give the user more flexibility in setting up the Diff results. however, an external program is required, and most users do not want to program it themselves. however, the good news is that in most cases sed or perl are sufficient."</seg>
<seg id="2352">Use this pre-processing command for newlines to convert the input into uppercase letters: SED's /\\ (. *\\) /\\ U\\ 1 / 'This. * is a regular expression of the found text in the first clause. the\\ U converts the found text in uppercase.</seg>
<seg id="2353">CVS and other version control systems use some keywords to add automatically generated strings (info: / cvs / keyword substitution).</seg>
<seg id="2354">"while you experiment with sed, you might start to understand it and maybe you may even like these regular expressions even. they are very useful because there are many programs that support very similar things."</seg>
<seg id="2355">Ignoring numbers is actually an already built-in function in Kdiff3. but it is good as an example for another preprocessor command for newlines. sed 's / [0123456789.-] / / g' Each character between '[' and ']' is a hit and each hit is replaced by nothing so practically deleted.</seg>
<seg id="2356">Sometimes you might want to perform several replacements at once. then you can use the semicolon ';' to separate the replacements from each other. example:</seg>
<seg id="2357">"instead of sed you can also use something else, e.g. perl -p -e's / REGEXP / replacement / SCHALTER 'However, perl needs some details different. where sed\\ (and\\) needs, perl needs only (and) without the previous'\\ '. example:"</seg>
<seg id="2358">The data after the normal preprocessor will be retained for the display and merging. the further operations only change the data that the line-up algorithm sees.</seg>
<seg id="2359">"note: in rare cases, if you use a normal preprocessor, the newline preprocessor will display the output of the normal preprocessor."</seg>
<seg id="2360">"preprocessor commands are very useful, but as with any function that changes text or hide differences, you may not accidentally notice certain differences and destroy important data in the worst case."</seg>

<seg id="2522">"do not use the smart move if you just start using it & kmousetool; instead, select text instead: run a mouse click at one end of the text area and hold the Shift key, while you move the mouse pointer to the other end of the text and press the mouse button again."</seg>

<seg id="2626">"the rest are simple text orders. every order you accept from the map card is a textbook. KSayit is an example of a applications that uses text orders. text orders are intended for the edition of longer texts, which do not have any special urgency."</seg>

<seg id="2629">Filters edit the text and pass it on to the next filter. currently there are three types of filters.</seg>
<seg id="2630">Filters are designed as modules. in the future there can be further types of filters.</seg>

<seg id="2921">Sometimes it turns out to be necessary to recreate the band index file using the tape content. this process deletes all existing index files for this band. you can create the index on two types of the band:</seg>
<seg id="2922">This creates a backup profile with the currently selected files and the default settings. you can make the following settings for a backup profile:</seg>

<seg id="2940">"the program is suitable for inexperienced users who do not know where to get information about your system, or where the system provides the different protocol files. moreover, the system allows for quick access to information about problems that occur on your server."</seg>
<seg id="2941">"the task of & ksystemlog; is a simplified representation of the protocol files of your own system. the program is suitable for inexperienced users who do not know where to get information about your system, or where the system puts the different protocol files."</seg>
<seg id="2942">"in addition, & ksystemlog; experienced users can provide quick access to information about problems that occur on their server. & ksystemlog; therefore attempts to provide some advanced functions that allow the protocol files to be filtered and evaluated by certain programs."</seg>
<seg id="2943">"in the current version 0.4.1 has & ksystemlog; a number of useful functions, including:"</seg>
<seg id="2944">"support for many different types of log files, for the format of the Syslog server and for Samba"</seg>
<seg id="2945">Many other functions are also included and are explained in the other chapters of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2946">"as you see in the following screenshots, & ksystemlog; functions are available to easily filter and sort the individual protocol lines of a protocol file. the individual options for sorting and filtering are shown in the next chapter of this manual."</seg>
<seg id="2947">"after the start, it tries to open and ksystemlog; first the most important protocol file of the system - the system protocol - will open up to you, and it opens instead of a small message window, so you have & ksystemlog; most likely not with system administrator rights. the protocol files are usually not available in the / var / log file, for the normal user usually no justification for reading."</seg>
<seg id="2948">"you can also use the filter strip to filter according to a selected criterion, or after input strings. the list of the log lines will now automatically be displayed, so that only log lines will appear next to the filter. in the default setting, a log line will only appear if the string of the filter search engine is contained in one of the columns."</seg>
<seg id="2949">"you can also select a different entry at this point. the string of the filter search engine will then only be matched with the entries in the corresponding column. for example, in the log file System Protocol, select the column process, so you see & ksystemlog; all log lines that were sent or created by this process."</seg>
<seg id="2950">"this option is enabled in the default setting, and helps you to recognize the important protocol lines."</seg>
<seg id="2951">"if you want to show only a certain process (for example, in the system protocol or the Cron protocol), you can hide the process identification (PID) in the process column. this can, for example, be useful if you want to examine the output of a specific command such as the start of the samba server. in this case, use filter strip."</seg>
<seg id="2952">"in addition, you can enable the option to jump to new lines in the main window pop-up menu to display all the new log lines."</seg>
<seg id="2953">"to use this feature, use the entries in the menu window to open and manage additional subwindows. once you have selected a subwindow, select a protocol to display."</seg>
<seg id="2954">& ksystemlog; has its own website at http: / / ksystemlog.forum-software.org. Dort you will find further information about the sources of & ksystemlog.</seg>
<seg id="2955">& ksystemlog; also find in the following folder des & kde; -Subversion Archives: ksystemlog; in & kde; archive</seg>
<seg id="2956">"welcome to the & kde; System V Init Editor, rather known (and in the following also named) as & ksysv;. this section introduces a few concepts and describes what you can do with & ksysv."</seg>
<seg id="2957">"the V Init system is rapidly becoming a standard for controlling the program starting at startup of the system in the & Linux world. therefore, because it is easier to use, more powerful, and more flexible than the traditional BSD-Init."</seg>
<seg id="2958">I will not go into historical aspects here (e.g. because I know nothing about it: -).</seg>
<seg id="2959">"the init binary file is located under / sbin and not under / etc. this is therefore important because maybe someone might try to install a machine on System V Init, without reinstalling and re-format. that's why you need to make sure the old Init was removed from there if there was one."</seg>
<seg id="2960">The SysV Init also differs from the BSD Init that the configuration files are located in a subfolder of / etc. this folder is called rc.sysinit and the following additional folders:</seg>
<seg id="2961">"init.d contains a lot of scripts. basically you need a script for every system service you want to boot from the system or when switching to another runlevel. system services do not include such things such as setserial, which only once started. such calls may include rc.local."</seg>
<seg id="2962">"you can also create a rc.serial in / etc / rc.d if you want to run a rc.serial in / etc / rc.d, if you want to run a rc.serial in / etc / rc.d if you want to do something with the serial port."</seg>
<seg id="2963">The kernel is searching for different places after the program init and starts the first one he finds.</seg>
<seg id="2964">The standard runlevel is entered in / etc / inittab. you should see a line like the following:</seg>
<seg id="2965">"at this point, you can take a look at the second column and probably find that the default runlevel 3 is. if you want to change it, then you can edit / etc / inittab by hand and change the 3."</seg>
<seg id="2966">"but how does it start all the correct scripts? if you enter ls -l in rc3.d, then you probably see something like the following:"</seg>
<seg id="2967">"you will notice that there are no real files in this folder. instead, each entry here is a link to one of the scripts in the init.d directory."</seg>
<seg id="2968">"how to start and stop init actually system services? quite simply, each of the scripts is written in such a way that it accepts an argument like start and stop. you can actually start these scripts by hand on the command line:"</seg>
<seg id="2969">"this would stop the httpd server. init reads the name, and if a K contains, the script will be called stop. if it contains an S, the script will be called with the start of the argument."</seg>
<seg id="2970">"some people want to set up a simple way of setting up machines for many purposes. I could have a server runlevel that lets only httpd, & sendmail;, network & etc; running. in addition, I could have a user -running level, the & eg; & kdm;, network & etc."</seg>
<seg id="2971">Here you learn how to use & ksysv; it should not be very difficult because the program was designed as user-friendly as possible.</seg>
<seg id="2972">Using & ksysv; using a mouse or another device is simple to not say trivial: simply drag an entry from the range of available system services to one of the six runlevel to start it at this level (or stop).</seg>
<seg id="2973">"you can also move scripts between Runleveln, or change the position within a level by removing it somewhere else."</seg>
<seg id="2974">"note: entries are moved if you move them into a new range. in order to just copy them to a new runlevel, you must explicitly select copying from the Edit menu or from the context menu and enter the target area -- even if the same entry has already existed in the target area of the action."</seg>
<seg id="2975">"the sorting number of an item can sometimes not be calculated. in such a case, you must edit the sorting numbers of the surrounding entries before you can again try to insert the system service."</seg>
<seg id="2976">"note: currently, there is no way to restore entries thrown into the recycle bin. so be careful."</seg>
<seg id="2977">"you can use the Tab key to enable the different workspaces (available system services, runlevel 1 start, runlevel 1 stop & etc;) as well as the cursor keys to make a selection above or below the previous one."</seg>
<seg id="2978">"to move an entry to another runlevel, move it with cutting into the clipboard (you can also use Ctrl; X) and add it to the desired runlevel with insert (with Ctrl; V)."</seg>
<seg id="2979">"to manually change the sorting number or the name of an entry manually, press the input button to switch between different fields. close the dialog by pressing the input button to accept the changes, or press Esc to discard the changes."</seg>
<seg id="2980">"because of the risk of data loss, all entries in the File menu require a confirmation before they are executed."</seg>
<seg id="2981">"all settings are saved in $KDEHOME / share / config / ksysvrc. preferences are taken from the global file ($KDEDIR / share / config / ksysvrc) if it is available. otherwise, they will be restored by & ksysv; otherwise they will be saved in a local ksysvrc."</seg>
<seg id="2982">I have experimented with the standard runleveln and now the machine is restarting constantly. what can I do?</seg>
<seg id="2983">Enter the LILO -Prompt linux single and press the input button to start in single user mode. then edit the file / etc / inittab and change the default runlevel to a reasonable value (3 should normally be fine).</seg>
<seg id="2984">"I have some system services with & ksysv; designed for running under runlevel X, but they are not executed."</seg>
<seg id="2985">"if you are using & SuSE; or Delix (DLD), you need to edit additional files in / etc which are only available in these distributions. please read the details in the manual of the distribution."</seg>
<seg id="2986">"the way system services are started in these distributions, simplifies configuration for proprietary setup programs of these distributions, but unfortunately no standard. the authors of & ksysv; plan an extension of the program for this approach."</seg>
<seg id="2987">"if you are using a different distribution: please check that all configuration files are present, which are needed by the respective system service (and whether they are in the correct directory). some services (like & eg; Apache and httpd) are just quit when their configuration files are not present or wrong."</seg>
<seg id="2988">"the meaning of the & Linux; -runlevel varies from distribution to distribution, can even be different from version to version. if you use any other distribution, please send me information about the runlevel so that this manual can be added to this manual."</seg>
