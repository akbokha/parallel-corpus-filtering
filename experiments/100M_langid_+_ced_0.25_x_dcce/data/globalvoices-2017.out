&quot; although I had visited the US since 2012 at least once a year , I would live there for the first time . &quot;
and that was very exciting for me .
my love for America is extremely large .
&quot; as many of my generation I grew up with American movies , I d@@ anced to American music , read American authors and run his sport . &quot;
&quot; in fact , this country had such a profound effect on me that I became journalists mainly because of an American film journalist . &quot;
&quot; as a 14 @-@ year @-@ old , I saw the great D@@ enz@@ el Washington , as he played the Gray Gran@@ th@@ am in The Pel@@ ican letter , a fear@@ less rep@@ orter who wanted to occupy the mur@@ der@@ ous conspiracy of an oil mag@@ n@@ ate with the help of Julia Rober@@ ts as a Jura student who wanted to occupy his interest . &quot;
I was caught .
&quot; free after Method Man , &quot; I was as if that is the absolute truth , forget everything else , that &apos;s what I want to do with my life . &quot;
&quot; and the year I lived in Arizona , my admir@@ ation for the USA had only intensi@@ fied . &quot;
&quot; I always said : &quot; America is the only country in which I have ever lived , whose diversity is so inviting that you can always be the one you are and it is easy acceptance in a community of like @-@ minded people . &quot;
I even had written a very black@@ ish love letter about his size .
then Donald Tr@@ ump came .
much has been written about x@@ en@@ opho@@ bia and rac@@ ism of this man .
the most extraordinary aspect of his as@@ cen@@ sion is for me as he goes with his narrow @-@ min@@ de@@ dness .
&quot; in his opinion , he never stops behind the mountain , as you say so beautifully . &quot;
&quot; he says exactly what he thinks like a former colleague , and openly declares his cont@@ emp@@ t for Muslims , Lat@@ inos , Af@@ ro@@ amer@@ ers and women . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , the people responded to his statements and voted in pairs for him . &quot;
&quot; the 13 million votes he won in the Repub@@ lican elections , was the highest number , which was ever reached by the nomin@@ ee nomin@@ ee . &quot;
I was speech@@ less .
who are the Americans who support this big@@ ot person I asked myself ?
I could not reconc@@ ile Tr@@ ump and his voters with the people I met during my time in Phoenix .
&quot; as for example my professor , Dr. Bill Sil@@ cock , director of the journalist programme , which takes people from around the world , a deep beli@@ ever , with whom I could talk about Islam and its past . &quot;
&quot; also , Tr@@ umps Welt@@ anschau@@ ung not agreed with the present editor of the &quot; &quot; C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati In@@ quir@@ er &quot; &quot; ( C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati In@@ quir@@ er ) . &quot;
Bh@@ ati@@ a and I met our common love for basketball and we spent many hours watching the &quot; Phoenix Sun &quot; at the game .
&quot; Tr@@ umps In@@ tolerance is also in contrast to gener@@ osity I experienced with Sand@@ y B@@ ahr who fought for the environment for her life , and her husband Dave , my host family , who treated me as her son . &quot;
she still fits to the engagement of Krist@@ i Kapp@@ es who always helped me with a lot of patience and grace and my colleagues helped to get used to the complexity of American life .
&quot; then there were Andrew Bü@@ ey , Kath@@ r@@ yn Mc@@ Man@@ us and Re@@ tha Hill , my ment@@ ors , whose wis@@ er advice helped me a lot in my career . &quot;
these people and the values em@@ bodied by them deep@@ ened my love to America .
&quot; while Tr@@ ump drew his way to nom@@ inate Repub@@ lican presidential candidates , they offered me a stop and the counter@@ part to his limited vision of America . &quot;
&quot; however , it turned out that they were the exception of the rule . &quot;
&quot; on November 8 , 2016 more than 50 million Americans , mostly white , the pres@@ idency of a man , despite - or perhaps precisely because of his cont@@ emp@@ t against non @-@ white people . &quot;
&quot; the confrontation with the idea that people voted for Tr@@ ump because they either shared their rac@@ ism and fan@@ ati@@ cism , or because they were willing to over@@ look those things , almost broke my heart . &quot;
perhaps it is unfair to design@@ ate the Tr@@ ump voters as R@@ assi@@ sts .
&quot; to sort people , one of my friends said , is exactly what led us to this situation . &quot;
this is super@@ ficial and dis@@ resp@@ ect@@ ful and indicates an in@@ ability to understand those who act and think in a different way .
it shows people that their concerns and fears about the hec@@ tic changes in their communities are not taken into account .
&quot; could it be that these voters , most of whom are white , voted for Tr@@ ump because they want to reg@@ ain control over a country that has disappointed them ? &quot;
&quot; in other words , they might say they are still important in this America ? &quot;
maybe .
&quot; however , one can hardly forget the words of David Rem@@ nick , who comm@@ enting the cruel decision to lift a man who looks down with cont@@ emp@@ t for those who look different from him . &quot;
&quot; this &quot; Whit@@ el@@ ash &quot; ( m . Ü ) : as much as &quot; &quot; rebellion of the wh@@ ites against all other eth@@ ni@@ cities &quot; &quot; ; word play from white in reference to the wh@@ ites and whi@@ pl@@ ash , which means the great Van Jones , exactly what America has done so great . &quot;
&quot; millions of people around the world appreciate the American ideal - whether myth or reality , it is nevertheless a powerful idea - whatever belief or background you may have , America is welcome . &quot;
&quot; for this country chose as its president , twice the son of a Ken@@ yan , whose history as he himself says , nowhere else in the world would be possible . &quot;
&quot; however , with the election Donald Tr@@ umps there is a huge part of the white America &apos;s promise and says : to hell with diversity , freedom of religion and the whole concept of pl@@ ur@@ alism . &quot;
&quot; in America after 9 / 11 , the white man is again at the helm , they say . &quot;
&quot; I have to think of K@@ hi@@ z@@ r Khan , the father of a soldier who fell in Iraq and what he said on the eve of the election . &quot;
&quot; at a rally for Hill@@ ary Clinton , Mr. Khan had a word change with the crowd . &quot;
&quot; Donald Tr@@ ump , would my son , Captain Hu@@ may@@ un K@@ ahn , have a place in your America ? &quot; &quot; asked Mr. Khan . &quot;
the crowd replied with a loud &quot; no ! &quot;
&quot; would Muslims have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; no ! &quot; &quot; the crowd cra@@ cked . &quot;
do Lat@@ inos have a place in your America ?
&quot; no ! &quot; they answered .
do A@@ fr@@ o Americans have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; they cried , and their voices were lou@@ der . &quot;
&quot; if anyone , who is not like you , would have a place in your America ? &quot;
he received a unanim@@ ous and loud &quot; NE@@ IN &quot; !
&quot; Mr. Khan concluded with the words : &quot; &quot; thank God , Mr. Tr@@ ump , this is not your America . &quot; &quot; 36 hours later he was corrected . &quot;
&quot; the land , for which his son had fallen , sent him a message . &quot;
&quot; this is now Tr@@ umps Land , said the message . &quot;
&quot; and all the people that look like Mr. Khan , could not find a place in this new America . &quot;
and it breaks my heart .

what has the Mexican music school of Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero commun@@ e in the province of O@@ ax@@ aca with the children of the Paragu@@ ay@@ an city of Cat@@ eur@@ a together ?
&quot; the music played in both places not only changed the lives of the children , but also a very close connection with ... &quot;
music that lives with the waste
&quot; Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero is located on the edge of a large gar@@ bage dump , just 16 km south of O@@ ax@@ aca &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; an old colonial city that is very popular among tourists but worlds away from the nearby prehistoric ruins and its world @-@ famous cuisine . &quot;
&quot; for some years now La b@@ anda de M@@ ú@@ sica ( music ban@@ de ) has been playing in the congregation : a symph@@ ony orchestra consisting of children and adults , which has found a way to overcome the poverty surrounding them with their musical instruments . &quot;
a music school with 100 students has become the central interest for the commun@@ e of Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero in O@@ ax@@ aca .
the British newspaper The Guardian wrote about this project :
&quot; the municipality , located in one of the poor@@ est provinces of Mexico , is known for its drug abuse and the gangs @-@ violence . &quot;
&quot; but this changed after a coinci@@ dental encounter with a French pilot , who launched a musical project and offered the youth a rare g@@ limmer of hope . &quot;
&quot; the young band members take their commitments to the music group very seriously , writes local press Not@@ ici@@ as O@@ ax@@ aca N@@ VI : &quot;
&quot; as soon as they come from school , they run back home and immediately after lunch they run through the du@@ sty streets to pursue their great passion . &quot;
&quot; you will always laugh and play with shiny eyes and play in the bu@@ stle you learn day for day trumpet , tro@@ mb@@ one , pic@@ colo , clarinet , o@@ boe , flute , woo@@ horn , tim@@ pan@@ i , bon@@ gos and the con@@ ga . &quot;
music from gar@@ bage
&quot; more than 7,@@ 000 kilometres south of Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero play the children of Cat@@ eur@@ a - a village located practically at the top of the largest gar@@ bage dump of As@@ unci@@ ón in Paragu@@ ays capital - on instruments made of recycled waste material : &quot;
&quot; music with re@@ produced instruments , which consist of local solid waste materials , produced in a workshop for musical instruments in Cat@@ eur@@ a , where the Recycl@@ er began to turn parts of the waste into instruments . &quot;
&quot; the instruments im@@ itate viol@@ ins , viol@@ as , cel@@ los , double b@@ asses , guitars , fl@@ utes , sax@@ oph@@ ones , trump@@ ets , tro@@ mb@@ ones and drums all made of tr@@ ash . &quot;
&quot; the repertoire includes classical music , folk music , Paragu@@ ay@@ an and Latin American music as well as music of the Beat@@ les , by Frank Sin@@ atra etc . &quot;
&quot; in an article in the Los Angeles Times , F@@ avi@@ o Ch@@ á@@ vez , a local econom@@ ist and musician of the children of Cat@@ eur@@ a , rec@@ alls the initial time : &quot;
&quot; first , it was very difficult because we had no place to rehear@@ se and we had to teach at the same place where the parents did not know music and it was very difficult to contact parents because many of them did not live together with their children . &quot;
this changed as F@@ avi@@ o something that he had never seen before : a violin made from rub@@ b@@ ish .
&quot; today , there is an entire orchestra which plays on instruments from re @-@ recorded material and called The Recycl@@ ed Orchestra . &quot;
a documentary called &quot; Land@@ fill Harmon@@ ic &quot; ( harmon@@ ic gar@@ bage dump ) records the musical performance :
the world generates about one billion tons of waste every year .
&quot; those who live with him and of him are the poor@@ est - as humans in Cat@@ eur@@ a , Paraguay . &quot;
and here they turn it into something beautiful .
fill Harmon@@ ic follows the orchestra with its inspiring scenery from gar@@ bage to music around the world .
the orchestra has even played its music in front of Pope Francis :
these East African countries demonstrate how technology and team@@ work can successfully combat illegal fishing .

&quot; this post , written by Emma Br@@ yce , was originally published at En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that reports specifically about international , practiced solutions for environmental problems . &quot;
the re@@ publication takes place within the framework of an agreement with Global Vo@@ ices for sharing content .
&quot; in West Africa , at that time , it was known that this ship had already operated illegal fishing in li@@ beri@@ ans before it was seeking Africa &apos;s other coast . &quot;
the East African countries were drawn up accordingly and slightly inclined to welcome a criminal off@@ ish of this type on their shores .
&quot; Kenya , Tanzania , Mauritius , the Com@@ or@@ os , Moz@@ ambique and the Seych@@ elles are swi@@ ft@@ ly mobili@@ zed against the ship . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; suddenly the prime minister was surrounded by countries who simply refused everything , &quot; &quot; rec@@ alls Benedi@@ ct Ki@@ il@@ u , a senior employee of the Ken@@ yan F@@ ish@@ eries Authority . he is part of a team that discovered and persec@@ uted the ship at its time . &quot;
&quot; in 2013 , the ship was then driven out of the waters of the region : it was not able to catch fish there . &quot;
&quot; finally , it was also forced to pay 2 million US dollars to Liberia , because of pill@@ age of the country &apos;s fish stocks . &quot;
&quot; the core of this initiative , which protects criminal practices and protects resources , was F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa : a network of countries , 2012 founded by the NGO Stop Il@@ legal Fishing ( Il@@ legal fishing ) . &quot;
&quot; in addition to Somalia and Madagascar , the members of this network are the six countries , which at that time had driven the prime minister from their waters . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; with this we have eight countries that are like and work together . they exchange information and are mut@@ ually exclusive where it comes to illegal fishing , &quot; &quot; says Tony Long , head of the P@@ ew Char@@ itable Trust Project En@@ ding Il@@ legal Fishing . this project offers F@@ ISH @-@ i technical support . &quot;
&quot; illegal fishing is un@@ regulated by definition : what is caught is hidden , therefore it is extremely difficult to detect . thus , illegal fishing is a leading cause of over@@ fishing of regions . &quot;
&quot; by the deliber@@ ate cont@@ emp@@ t of existing laws , by which certain habitats and species are to be protected , illegal fishing can harm ecos@@ ystems that have a delicate balance . &quot;
&quot; but while actions against illegal fishing were once imp@@ eded by bureaucratic hur@@ d@@ les , and even by the sn@@ ail of information between individual countries , actions are now happening in real time , with tra@@ ce@@ able on F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s digital communication platform . &quot;
&quot; for example , the individual countries can exchange lists of existing licenses , news about suspic@@ ious activities or details that were noticed or experienced during a port inspection . &quot;
&quot; fish @-@ i pursu@@ es the activities of ships also very attentive if they move on the open sea , using satellite data . &quot;
&quot; this allows the authorities to mark ships that fish in prohibited areas . also , such suspic@@ ious routes can be discovered - such as those that suggest that a ship will load its captured fish on the road to other ships . &quot;
&quot; ideally , such investigations show whether the participating ships have a fishing license , where they were on the way and possibly whether they have a criminal . &quot;
&quot; on the basis of this information , countries that are opposed to illegal fishing may refuse to accept such vessels in their har@@ bours . what does that mean that ships cannot sell their cargo . and that they may even be forced to pay pen@@ alties , as in the case of the prime minister . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is about substantial financial losses to the owner , which means that illegal fishing is no longer worthwhile . &quot;
&quot; and that &apos;s what we want to achieve , &quot; &quot; says Per Erik Ber@@ gh , senior director of n@@ f@@ d Africa . the latter is a advis@@ er that supports the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also supports F@@ ISH @-@ i . &quot;
a closed front
&quot; the already mentioned platform was created to return an estimated 20 million USD to lost revenue , which will lose eight members of the H@@ ISH @-@ i network every year because of the illegal fis@@ hers that penet@@ rate into East African waters . &quot;
&quot; East Africa has one of the most productive t@@ una fish@@ eries , where the region attracts commercial fishing from all over the world . among these also illegal fishing . &quot;
&quot; their practices include activities such as sailing under false flag , counter@@ f@@ eit license papers , indication of Phan@@ tasi@@ es , the fish protected species and the fish in nature reserves . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; they specifically exploit the lack of international cooperation and take advantage of the weaknesses of a un@@ interrupted control system , &quot; &quot; says Long . &quot; &quot; earlier a ship could go fishing illeg@@ ally and a country could then say &quot; &quot; You must not run my harbour . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; but another country could say &apos; Come to me &apos; . &quot; &quot; and exactly this legal can@@ op@@ hole tries to close F@@ ISH @-@ i . &quot;
&quot; until now , the closed front works . &quot;
&quot; since its inc@@ eption , F@@ ISH @-@ i has participated in more than 30 studies of suspic@@ ious ships . &quot;
it has revealed criminal networks that had distributed fake licenses in Tanzania . it discovered ships that used several frau@@ dul@@ ent identi@@ ties and it has tra@@ cked and found escap@@ ing ships .
&quot; due to its cooperation with INTER@@ PO@@ L , the international authority to combat crime , F@@ ISH @-@ i can share and maintain information on illegal fishing over long distances . &quot;
&quot; &quot; some of our investigations lead us quite far into the networks of organized crime , &quot; says Ber@@ gh . &quot;
he builds a system that will help F@@ ISH @-@ i to locate suspic@@ ious ships more precisely .

&quot; fish @-@ i &apos;s satellite system , which is constantly evolving , also helps to detect illegal vessels that like to hide . &quot;
&quot; &quot; the illegal fishermen use very sophisticated techniques to hide their activities and their position . and that &apos;s what we are trying to cross , &quot; &quot; says Dun@@ can Cop@@ eland , chief analy@@ st at Tr@@ y@@ gg Mat tracking , an NGO that also deals with fish@@ eries data and F@@ ISH @-@ i technical support . &quot;
&quot; some of the ships , for example , turn off their automatic identification systems , so that they can no longer be powered by satellite . &quot;
&quot; therefore , Cop@@ eland helps build a system that combines different levels of information . F@@ ISH @-@ i will help to find crimin@@ ally active ships with greater precision . &quot;
a model program
but F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s team of African nations actually influence the un@@ question@@ ably global problem of illegal fishing ?
&quot; John A@@ mos , President of the N@@ RO Sky@@ Truth , believes that . &quot;
&quot; recently , Oce@@ ana has opened the Global Fishing Watch platform together with Google and the Marine Protection Organisation Oce@@ ana : a platform that offers satellite data and can be displayed anywhere in the world using the position of each tra@@ ce@@ able ship worldwide . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; together with the neighbours to get a better picture of who is doing - this simply makes sense , &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; here &apos;s a chance for countries to unite and bund@@ le their resources to investigate . &quot;
&quot; we should do this on a global scale . &quot; &quot; P@@ ew Char@@ itable Tru@@ sts have a similar project to run in which a global system per@@ mitting the persecution of ships . &quot;
&quot; there are indications that F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s activities not only det@@ ach crimin@@ als , but also fri@@ ghten them . &quot;
&quot; ships that have been f@@ ished earlier without a license and hardly expected to have consequences , now know that they are observed . &quot;
&quot; according to Ki@@ il@@ u , some of the countries involved in F@@ ISH @-@ i have now recorded a 33 % increase in fish@@ eries sales since fishing boats have been buying more licenses since then . &quot;
&quot; after F@@ ISH @-@ i Somalia had helped to detect Gre@@ ko 1 , the inspec@@ tors found on board tow@@ ing nets whose use is prohibited . &quot;
photo courtesy of F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa .
&quot; other countries also notice these achievements . &quot; &quot; the effect is so strong that other countries now also copy , &quot; &quot; says Ki@@ il@@ u . &quot; &quot; we are a study object . &quot; &quot; in West Africa several hundred million dollars disappear every year by illegal fishing . &quot;
&quot; there have been six countries together in 2015 , the so @-@ called West Africa Task Force . also , they now fight illegal fishing , according to the same model as F@@ ISH @-@ i@@ . &quot; &quot; With security , the aim of even more such initiatives and structures is to be created in other regions , &quot; &quot; says Cop@@ eland . &quot;
&quot; recently F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s youngest member country Somalia was able to report its first big triumph : in October , it represented Gre@@ ko 1 , a ship that was on the road under false flag . &quot;
&quot; the ship was also penet@@ rated into forbidden waters that are reserved for fishermen from Somalia . &quot; &quot; with taking measures against Gre@@ ko 1 , they set a strong sign that they fight against illegal fishing , &quot; &quot; says Ber@@ gh . &quot;
&quot; for F@@ ISH @-@ i this is another success of many . and at the same time the proof that such a special , collaborative approach to protecting the oceans is actually working in the entire oceans . Emma Br@@ yce is a freel@@ ance journalist and lives in London . there she writes on the subject of environment , technology and nutrition . &quot;
&quot; their articles appear in the Wi@@ red Magazine , TE@@ D Education , the New York Times and in the Guardian . situation in Venezuela escal@@ ates further : demonstrations in several cities with the aim of &quot; &quot; conqu@@ ering the country &quot; &quot; &quot;
the street movements in Venezuela seem to be just the beginning of a wave of violent demonstrations .
&quot; they are deemed to be a protest against the government &apos;s decision , to stop the referendum on the res@@ ign@@ ation of President Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro . &quot;

&quot; after the Venezu@@ el@@ as government had rejected opposition to a referendum on a referendum , Venezu@@ el@@ ans re@@ acted in whose eyes the negotiations on the political and economic crisis of the country ran into emp@@ tin@@ ess by assem@@ bling on the streets . &quot;
&quot; under the h@@ ash@@ tag # La@@ Tom@@ a@@ De@@ Venezuela ( about : the rep@@ ay@@ ment of Venezuela ) , both the demonstrations and arguments for and against them can be found . &quot;
&quot; the debate will also be held in other parts of the country - among others in the flat land region of Bar@@ inas , in the An@@ des regions Mé@@ ri@@ da and T@@ á@@ chir@@ a , located in the central @-@ north of the federal state of Car@@ ab@@ ob@@ o and on Isla Margar@@ ita in the Federal State of Nu@@ eva E@@ spart@@ a . &quot;
&quot; the political and economic situation of the country deteri@@ or@@ ates continuously , which is reflected in the everyday life of the Venezu@@ el@@ ans through an acute shortage of food and medicines . &quot;
&quot; many representatives of the opposition saw the chance of a fundamental change in the resolution of the current president Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro , but ultimately the post@@ ure of a re @-@ election was blocked by the official authorities . &quot;
&quot; Mari@@ anne D@@ í@@ az , co @-@ acting at Global Vo@@ ices in Venezuela , summar@@ izes the context of government decision as follows : &quot;
&quot; in the context of the social , political and economic crisis in which inflation and violence are among the highest in the world ( the rate of inflation is estimated at 500 % for the end of the year ) and in which a serious and far @-@ reaching shortage of food and medicine , the referendum was considered to be the only way to reg@@ ain its institutional structures and to conclude a new governance . &quot;
&quot; the electoral alliance Mes@@ a de la Uni@@ dad Democr@@ á@@ tica or just MU@@ D ( about : round table of the Democratic Union ) , in which the opposition parties and political groups joined together , the demonstr@@ ators decided to join the elections of 2015 for the support of the National Assembly . &quot;
the call was commented on Twitter among others as follows :
&quot; it is far from Venezuela : morning National Assembly , Friday nationwide civil strike and on 3 November all to Car@@ ac@@ as to the Mira@@ fl@@ ores Palace . &quot;

&quot; the re@@ conquest of Venezuela &quot;
&quot; the first demonstration in the course of the action programme &quot; &quot; The re@@ conquest of Venezuela &quot; &quot; took place on Wednesday , October 26 . &quot;
&quot; the pictures of the fairy tales that are published in real time testify among other things an overwhelming participation of the people in numerous areas of the country , but also confron@@ tations with polic@@ emen and supporters of the government . &quot;
&quot; one of the most frequently shared pictures shows a demonstr@@ ator calling through the shiel@@ ds , &quot; &quot; Will you kill me , because I am hungry ? &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; on Twitter , pictures that tell of confron@@ tations , as well as reports of repression and abuse . &quot;
especially large waves beat the news of police repression in the centrally located city of Mar@@ ac@@ ay .
the demonstr@@ ators went back to the local Cathedral in order to protect themselves according to their own statement from the police and armed advoc@@ ates of the government .
&quot; hours later they were able to leave the cathedral safely , but the protests continued . &quot;
&quot; in other parts of the country , some demonstr@@ ators tried to stop police forces , including this woman in the state of T@@ á@@ chir@@ a : &quot;
&quot; the women in T@@ á@@ chir@@ a do not wear skir@@ ts , because otherwise you could see something that many National Gu@@ ards did not have ! &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , an inf@@ ographi@@ cs makes the round , which forms the level of repression per day : &quot;
thus the dictatorship has oppressed the country .
many representatives of the government questioned the validity of the demand for an amp@@ utation method - this was now shown in the eyes of many people on the road through the presence of countless people .
My@@ t@@ eks Media Labs for this purpose :
Nicol@@ ás and Di@@ os@@ dado claim that 1 % of sig@@ natures are fal@@ si@@ fied .
here is your resurrection .
on the road !
&quot; others evaluate these protests as a further step in the struggle against a government , which has little to do against the devast@@ ating economic crisis , and rather than dealing with critical voices : &quot;
they have taken us so much - but also the fear !
the mar@@ ches always take more of frequency and intensity .
&quot; some Venezu@@ el@@ ans reported the media , they were too hungry to participate in a strike instead of working or buying . &quot;

&quot; this is an adapted version of an interview conducted by Ale@@ jo G@@ ó@@ me@@ z with Luis Qui@@ j@@ ano , which was written on 23 August 2016 on D@@ ía a D@@ ía , an Argent@@ ine@@ an news page . &quot;
the interview was translated into English and is published here with kind permission .
&quot; when he was 15 years old , Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was forced by his father to watch the atro@@ cities in La Per@@ la , a secret prison in the Argent@@ ine town of C@@ ór@@ doba . &quot;
&quot; as an adult man , Qui@@ j@@ ano now said in the context of the great La Per@@ la Ri@@ bera process in the province of C@@ ór@@ doba against his father . &quot;
&quot; in the trial , which ended on 24 August 2016 , crimes were investigated , which were committed during the Argent@@ inian military dictatorship . &quot;
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano has not chosen his life .
&quot; starting with the burden of carrying the same name as his father to the brutal military operations in La Per@@ la prison , which he observed at the age of 15 , he suffered enough . &quot;
for 34 years he kept secret of family secrets .
in the situation at that time I thought that was fine .
I felt like a secret agent .
&quot; as a child with 15 years of age , one does not notice that one is manipul@@ ated by his father . &quot;
&quot; at that time , I could not see that my father was a th@@ ief , tort@@ ur@@ ers and mur@@ der@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; Luis had no choice : his father Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was gendar@@ me official . during the Argent@@ ine@@ an military dictatorship from 1974 to 1983 , a time of state terrorism , his father was deputy commander of the intelligence section 141 in La Per@@ la prison . &quot;

&quot; no , this is the story of Luis Qui@@ jan@@ os &apos;s son , a man who , over the years recognized the extent of atro@@ cities he had experienced as a boy , and who testi@@ fied before a Federal Court against his own father . &quot;
his story shows how great power a parent has over his child and how this child chose a way of salvation .

&quot; when my father started taking me to the military base , I often went to the sports hall . there I had friends with a boy who made mar@@ tial arts . &quot;
all called him &quot; K@@ ent . &quot;
I told my father of him and some days later he showed me a black @-@ white photo and asked me to identify my friend .
he said :
&quot; you are an as@@ sh@@ ole , you have been friends with one of the ERP . &quot;
&quot; pass only that they will not kid@@ n@@ ap you one day , and I must save you . &quot;
&quot; the abbrevi@@ ation ERP stands for E@@ j@@ ér@@ c@@ ito Revol@@ u@@ ci@@ on@@ ario del Pu@@ eb@@ lo , - Revolutionary People &apos;s Army - the military arm of the revolutionary workers &quot; party of Argentina . &quot;
&quot; for that reason , he offered me to go back to the sports hall . a few days later he took me to work on the military base . &quot;
&quot; he told me , I would become a secret . &quot;
&quot; I was 15 years old and in the situation I thought that would be fine , for so my father had raised me . &quot;
&quot; at the base of the military base , I had to destroy papers that had heard the prisoner . &quot;
&quot; these were all possible documents : university degrees , hand@@ written notes , literature , certificates , propaganda material , books , simply everything . &quot;

&apos;@@ there the prisoners are tor@@ tured &apos;
my father took me four times to La Per@@ la with - all in 1976 .
at the first and last time he left me at the entrance in the car .
&quot; when he took me the second time , he ordered me to go out . he led me to a bar@@ racks , in the cars , furniture , television , fri@@ dges - just everything possible . &quot;
everything was stolen .
&quot; he gave me a small pack@@ et wrapped in a blan@@ ket and ordered me to wear it for a car . when I opened it , I saw that there was a big l@@ ump of silver in it . &quot;
&quot; on that day I went to the other end of the bar@@ racks , where the stolen items were shut down and kept me with a guard post . &quot;
suddenly he pointed to an open space and said :
&quot; then , the prisoners are tor@@ tured . &quot;
&quot; I sp@@ ake in , and saw a couch where men were tor@@ tured . &quot;
it looked like a field @-@ bed and metal @-@ feathers .
later I found out that they attached it to the end of a cable . the other end was attached to the body of the person who was captiv@@ ated there .
&quot; they seldom grab@@ bed a man with hand@@ cu@@ ffs on the bed , wat@@ ered him with water and ch@@ ased him a charge of 220 vol@@ ts into the gen@@ it@@ als . &quot;

the sten@@ ch there was horri@@ fic ... like a dirty di@@ aper .
&quot; years later , when my father was under house arrest , the same smell came out of his room . &quot;
I realized the smell immediately and I became clear that this is the smell of a body in need .
I could never forget this smell .
&quot; and I asked myself , &quot; &quot; How is it possible for someone to do so much harm to another ? &quot;
I knew that these people were killed &apos;
&quot; when my father took me to work for the third time , he led me to the entrance of La Cu@@ ad@@ ra - the area where the prisoners were captiv@@ ated with hand@@ cu@@ ffs . &quot;
&quot; he spoke to &quot; Ch@@ ub@@ i &quot; Lop@@ ez ( Jose L@@ ó@@ pez , a civilian , who was also indic@@ ted in the trial ) and I took the opportunity to take a look at La Cu@@ ad@@ ra . &quot;
in the background I saw a number of matt@@ resses on which naked people were lying down with the face - all were tied to hands and feet .
close to the entrance people kept quiet on the matt@@ resses .
&quot; when my father noticed that I saw the prisoners , he said , &quot; &quot; What do you gu@@ ise so , as@@ sh@@ ole ? &quot;
&quot; I replied , &quot; &quot; Why have you brought me here ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
I knew that these people were killed .
they were thrown into a pit and killed and buried by soldiers .
I know that because my father told me at home .
&quot; in addition to La Cu@@ ad@@ ra , some rooms were designated as offices . &quot;
I know that &quot; Pal@@ ito &quot; Rom@@ ero hit a man there and killed .
&quot; according to the survivors of the civil war Jorge Rom@@ ero , who was also indic@@ ted in the La Per@@ la Ri@@ bera trial , was indic@@ ted by Ra@@ ú@@ l Mat@@ eo Mol@@ ina . &quot;
&quot; in the following video Emi@@ lio Fes@@ sia , head of La Per@@ la Memorial , leads through the former torture chambers . &quot;
the way you came in here is also the way on which the kid@@ n@@ apping came here .
&quot; when you look at the map , you see that they took about this journey and then were tor@@ tured for the first time . &quot;
here their names were changed and they were assigned a number as part of the process of de@@ human@@ isation .
&quot; when they survived the torture , the prisoners were thrown into the cu@@ ad@@ ra until the arrangement from above came that they should be reloc@@ ated . &quot;
this was the lie - the eu@@ ph@@ em@@ ism - for the shooting of men and the dis@@ appearance of their bodies in most cases .
the &apos; War yield &apos;
my father brought all sorts of stolen things home .
&quot; at that time in old age I had no idea what the &quot; &quot; war yield &quot; &quot; - as they called it - was . &quot;
&quot; but when I was in the military later , - I was in the gendar@@ mer@@ ie - it became clear to me that war yield was a bay@@ on@@ et or perhaps military signs that one has fought to an enemy that one has fought . &quot;

&quot; but if one goes into a house and ste@@ aling the fridge , the record player , clothing , paintings , money ... then it is not a war yield , but v@@ and@@ alism . &quot;
this is theft .
&quot; I have always wonder@@ ed how my father , the leader of the security forces , could join this v@@ and@@ alism . &quot;
I simply don &apos;t understand it .
I was also an officer in gendar@@ mer@@ ie and I would never like to enter into a house and ste@@ al everything in it .
I don &apos;t understand how my father could do that .
&quot; once he called me a criminal , and I answered : and thou , who ste@@ ad@@ eth cars on the road ? &quot;
you are not a criminal ?
&quot; he explo@@ ded with anger , struck me and cried : &quot;
&quot; if you go so far , then I will find you and kill yourself . &quot;
we need no one else to do this !
so my father was .
I have no one good memory of him .
&quot; when I said in the process , I showed a photo of then on which I wore a jacket and a roll swe@@ ater made of wool . both had my father from La Per@@ la . &quot;
&quot; we were not poor , but he nevertheless brought clothes to home . &quot;
&quot; at that time , the defense was acc@@ u@@ stom@@ ed to being a con@@ jur@@ er in this crime . I replied , no problem , they can lay the burden on what they wanted . &quot;
I was there anyway to testify .
&apos;@@ The dis@@ appearance of the body is the last ab@@ om@@ in@@ ous act &apos;
&quot; now , where I am older , I feel re@@ mor@@ se . &quot;
&quot; I have children . once you have children , you recognize the value of a life . &quot;
it develops further and realis@@ es that it is false to kill .
I even went so far to say :
&quot; well , so you executed people in the dictatorship of the dictatorship . &quot;
why kid@@ n@@ apped children ?
&quot; one day my father brought a girl home , whose mother was killed . &quot;
&quot; she was like our pet , almost like a dog - just that this was a little girl . &quot;
&quot; I always asked the question : they were tor@@ tured , but why were they killed ? &quot;
it would have been possible to put them into prison .
&quot; I guess it was simply decided to kill these people , but why their bodies disappear ? &quot;
did these people not even have families that could be handed over to their mort@@ al remn@@ ants ?
the dis@@ appearance of the body is the last ab@@ om@@ in@@ ous act that one can do to a man .
&quot; my father told me when democracy was re@@ introduced , they took machines to eliminate the mort@@ al remn@@ ants of the prisoners . &quot;
&quot; they were crushed , and somewhere dispos@@ ed of - no idea where . &quot; &quot; one will never find anything , &quot; &quot; said my father . &quot;
but something remains of course always .
I have seen how you killed people ! &apos;
only to clarify it : I have nothing against the military .
I was even with the gendar@@ mer@@ ie .
I just said the truth about 20 crimin@@ als - including my father .
&quot; the thought to display my father was during a conversation , when he stood under house arrest . &quot;
I made him alleg@@ ations because of all the atro@@ cities I had to experience .
&quot; then he said suddenly , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know . I didn &apos;t kill anyone . &quot;
&quot; I felt in@@ war@@ dly rejected and asked me what the whole exagger@@ ated patri@@ ot@@ ism and the &quot; Western and Christian feelings , &quot; which they suppos@@ edly defended , were actually good . &quot;
then I scre@@ amed :
how can you tell me something ?
I have seen how you killed people !
&quot; you have committed a terrible crime , and you forced me as a child to take part in this . &quot;
&quot; he only rep@@ ented &quot; &quot; Well , then forgive me . &quot; &quot; &quot;
that &apos;s exactly what I did .
&quot; in 2010 , I made the first advertisement . &quot;
I finally realized that he was a criminal .
no one can repro@@ ach me that I am pre@@ occupied . I have finally spoken against my own father .
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano died under house arrest in May 2015 before the end of the trial .
&quot; he was charged with 416 crimes , including severe , un@@ lawful de@@ priv@@ ation in 158 cases , torture in 154 cases , torture followed in 98 cases , torture followed by subsequent death in five cases and a case of kid@@ n@@ apping of one under 10 year old child . &quot;

the jud@@ gments in the &quot; Meg@@ ac@@ aus@@ a &quot;
the term &quot; Meg@@ ac@@ aus@@ a &quot; refers to the magnitude of the judgment in Spanish .
&quot; after four years in which more than 581 witnesses were heard , the historic La Per@@ la Ri@@ bera process ended due to the crimes committed between March 1975 and December 1978 against 7@@ 16 victims in August . &quot;
&quot; 43 op@@ pres@@ sors were found guilty of crimes against humanity ; the judgment was sentenced in 28 cases of life imprisonment , and in nine cases sentences between 2 and 14 years . in six cases , there were obj@@ ections . &quot;
eleven of the original 54 def@@ endants died during the trial .
&quot; # La@@ Per@@ la@@ verdi@@ ct : murder , torture and rape by Am@@ t@@ sper@@ son@@ en . # Es@@ war@@ state terrorism &quot;
&quot; all def@@ endants were members of the military , including former military personnel , former police personnel and civilian staff . &quot;
Pier@@ o De Mon@@ ti was kid@@ n@@ apped with his pregnant wife in June 1976 and brought to La Per@@ la .
he addressed the following words to the silent chamber :
La Per@@ la was a killer factory designed by un@@ human heads .
&quot; the judgment is a historic milestone for all human rights organisations , who have worked for justice for the victims for years . &quot;
&quot; Claudio O@@ ros@@ z , the lawyer of the Argent@@ inian organisation H.@@ I.@@ J.@@ O.@@ S. , who represents the children of people who were murdered or disappeared during the dictatorship , said : &quot;
&quot; the process took more than three years , but the research took 39 years . &quot;
&quot; in March 2007 , the Argent@@ ine@@ an government handed over the country on which La Per@@ la was set up to build a memorial site , which is now run by human rights organisations . &quot;

&quot; a translation error makes older people in Kyoto &quot; &quot; terrible car drivers &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the sign with the translation error at a centre in Kyoto , where one can extend its driving licence . &quot;
the photo was distributed in the social media .
editing the original photos by Joshua Lev@@ ine .
&quot; in the Japanese city of Kyoto , customers of a newly opened centre where one can extend their driving licence , last month witnesses of a very special mis@@ fortune . &quot;
&quot; on a shield the Japanese word of the &quot; &quot; older auto@@ bi@@ ker &quot; , &quot; the &quot; &quot; older auto@@ bi@@ ker &quot; &quot; means wron@@ g@@ ly - perhaps but also with vi@@ cious h@@ ind @-@ thoughts &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; translated as &quot; &quot; fear@@ ful mot@@ orists &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the wrong translation was to be read on electronic ads in the entrance area and in the building itself from September 1st to 20th .
&quot; editing of the original photos by Joshua Lev@@ ine , which was often shared in the social media . &quot;
&quot; the mistake was Julian Hol@@ mes , a citizen of Ky@@ ot@@ os , who made it aware of the local newspapers . &quot;
the Kyoto Shi@@ m@@ bu@@ n daily newspaper published in Kyoto writes :
&quot; &quot; &quot; how could it come to such an English translation ? &quot;
this proves that no one has read the translation correction .
&quot; this is an ins@@ ult to older people and in an international city like Kyoto is simply un@@ acceptable , &quot; &quot; said Hol@@ mes . &quot;
&quot; the er@@ ron@@ eous English translation was first removed . the name &quot; &quot; terrible drivers &quot; &quot; was later replaced by the more appropriate , even gram@@ mati@@ cally the correct name &quot; elder drivers &quot; ( German : &quot; older drivers &quot; ) . &quot;
&quot; the Kyoto Protocol ap@@ ologi@@ zed for the translation errors . furthermore , it explained that the error was already contained in the text that they had received from the translator and that the translation was not checked for correctness before it was published . &quot;
a blo@@ gger reported as follows :
&quot; we sincer@@ ely regret that older people felt offen@@ ded by the inadequate correction ( translation ) on our part , &quot; &quot; said the police . &quot;
the Japanese online news service J @-@ Cast News got a bit more detailed with the phenomenon of the &quot; terrible &quot; elderly drivers in Japan and wrote :
&quot; the word &quot; aw@@ ful &quot; was den@@ ounced as an in@@ appropriate description of older drivers . according to the police , the share of older drivers who are involved in accidents , however , is a cause of concern . &quot;
&quot; in the Kyoto pre@@ f@@ ecture , for example , 1,9@@ 41 were caused by a total of 19,@@ 460 accidents by sen@@ iors . this corresponds to a share of 10 % . &quot;
&quot; ten years later , in 2014 , sen@@ iors created 1,8@@ 03 of total 11,@@ 850 accidents . &quot;
&quot; in this way , their share rose to 17.@@ 7 % . &quot;
&quot; while the number of accidents in total has decreased , the proportion of accidents caused by sen@@ iors increased in the same period . &quot;
&quot; in the published version of the article , the non @-@ called rep@@ orter brought comments to light in the article published on Yahoo , which show which prejudi@@ ces some Japanese were apparently against older drivers : &quot;
&quot; the article on Yahoo about translation errors , among other things , received the following comments : &quot;
&quot; - &quot; &quot; Is this ( &quot; &quot; terrible mot@@ orists &quot; &quot; ) about not the reality ? &quot;
&quot; - &quot; So faul@@ ty is the translation really not , isn &apos;t it ? &quot;
- &quot; I don &apos;t think that is a real translation error . &quot;
there are not a few such comments .
why &quot; En@@ gr@@ ish &quot; is so widespread throughout Asia
translation errors are widespread in Japan and throughout Asia .
the site En@@ gr@@ ish@@ .com is a real treasure tro@@ ve for these bizarre errors in English .
photo of Fli@@ ck@@ r @-@ User Andrew .
the reasons for the wide distribution of translation errors are manifold .
&quot; for example , you need two important skills : passive language skills to understand the initial text and active language skills to transfer it to the target language . &quot;
the latter requires active ma@@ stery of the target language - something that is the case with native speakers . in general the conviction that translat@@ ors should be in the target language - not in the language of the language - native speakers .
&quot; for example , a French native speaker should translate from English into French - not from French to English . &quot;
photo of Fli@@ ck@@ r @-@ User Karl Baron .
&quot; many Japanese companies do not employ English as a native language , which might be translated into English . this may be due to lack of understanding of translat@@ ing , cost reasons or the relatively small number of English native speakers that learn Japanese . &quot;
&quot; some companies that have no foreign employees themselves , can still manufacture translations internally . then , the Japanese employee , whose English knowledge is considered the best , is made to the translator - no matter how good or bad his language skills are really . &quot;
photo of Fli@@ ck@@ r @-@ User Karl Baron .
machine translation is also widely used - often with funny results .
&quot; the pro@@ voc@@ ative and pu@@ zz@@ ling pro@@ positions produced by machine translation , show that this technique can not replace any human translator for a long time . this is especially true for some languages . &quot;
&quot; some of the stran@@ gest English form@@ ulations in Japan , including the mysterious prints that often decor@@ ate t @-@ shirts or bags , are only used for stylis@@ tic reasons - not to be read or understood . &quot;
photo by Fli@@ ck@@ r @-@ User Joseph Br@@ ent .
&quot; translation errors may be un@@ acceptable as jewellery or at least harmless , but by large companies or by the government that have the means to ensure higher standards , you can expect more careful translations . &quot;
&quot; in the future , the city of Kyoto will hopefully use a more serious source for its translations . &quot;
Venezuela : protests and cens@@ or@@ ship measures on the internet and television
&quot; main page of the Portal &quot; &quot; Nav@@ egar con Liber@@ t@@ ad &quot; &quot; ( Free Sur@@ fing ) of the IP@@ YS ( Institu@@ to Pr@@ ens@@ a y Soci@@ ed@@ ad , Institute for Press and Society ) . &quot;
&quot; on Friday morning , 7th April , Venezu@@ el@@ an Internet users announced that they had no access to the online broad@@ c@@ aster Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay . &quot;
&quot; later , other users wrote that the internet appearances of V@@ P@@ IT@@ V and El Capit@@ oli@@ o TV were no longer available . &quot;
&quot; other online transm@@ it@@ ters carried over recordings of the protests in Car@@ ac@@ as , which were organized by opposition groups to resist the government of Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ u@@ ros . &quot;
&quot; the protests started at the beginning of April , after the Supreme Court dissolved the parliament and transferred the Parliament &apos;s duties to the executive and the Supreme Court itself . &quot;
&quot; Luis Carlos D@@ í@@ az , journalist and author of Global Vo@@ ices , published the results of a tra@@ cer@@ ou@@ tes . he pointed out that the connection was coupled , and advised the users to use VPN ( virtual private networks ) to get access to the Internet . &quot;
# Zen@@ sur : activ@@ ates your VPN .
it seems that websites Venezu@@ el@@ an Internet providers are re @-@ locked .
this is from the page of @ Vi@@ vo@@ Play@@ Net .
&quot; offers such as Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay are popular among Venezu@@ el@@ ans with Internet access , especially in times of un@@ rest . &quot;
&quot; traditional media have been rel@@ ying on protests since 2014 . at that time , the Commission for Telec@@ ommunic@@ ation threatened them with fin@@ es and closing arguments , if they continue to report on the demonstrations , as the Commission saw this as a &quot; call for violence . &quot; &quot;
&quot; without cable TV and informative national TV channels , I registered at @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net again . &quot;
&quot; surprisingly , it is still cheaper to buy two liters of le@@ mon@@ ade . &quot;
&quot; the local NGO VE@@ sin@@ fil@@ tro later confirmed that not only Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay is not accessible through a locking of the Domain Name System ( DNS ) , but also two more online channels . this also applies to the website where the National Assembly transm@@ its its meetings . &quot;
&quot; previous investigations of the Institute for Press and Society ( IP@@ YS ) , a research group for digital rights in Venezuela , had shown that the local Internet providers sometimes use DNS . this is a technique by which the DNS servers answer requests of certain domains . &quot;
&quot; if a website is blocked by the DNS , the server respon@@ ds faul@@ ty or denied the request when calling on such a website . &quot;
&quot; we confirm a DNA lock : @ el@@ capit@@ oli@@ ot@@ v , @ V@@ P@@ IT@@ V and @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net &quot;
&quot; at V@@ P@@ IT@@ V , a third se@@ perate channel , the transmission was set on Thursday , April 6 , when the V@@ P@@ IT@@ V cam@@ er@@ aman El@@ vis Flor@@ es , who carried the protests in Car@@ ac@@ as live , was det@@ ained . &quot;
&quot; Flor@@ es was beaten , while he was in police custo@@ dy . &quot;
&quot; eight hours later , he was released , and V@@ P@@ IT@@ V went on stream again . &quot;
&quot; although some channels are still accessible via YouTube , the government has also reported that the government regul@@ ates internet connections : thus , the Venezu@@ el@@ an authorities will continue to make access to multimedia reports of current events in the country . &quot;
&quot; in Paraguay , many girls become slaves to receive education . &quot;
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was a cri@@ adi@@ ta as a child . now she visits the house where she worked for years .
&quot; today , Tina is fighting for the rights of children and colle@@ cts testim@@ onies of other Cri@@ adi@@ tas , who have been victims of abuse and discrimination . &quot;

the following article is the abri@@ dged version of a tutorial published by Global Vo@@ ices with kind permission of the authors .
&quot; the article is part of a series entitled &quot; Vac@@ as que v@@ u@@ el@@ an , es@@ cu@@ el@@ as que CA@@ EN &quot; ( &quot; Flying C@@ ows , Acci@@ dents Schools &quot; ) , edited and published by Global Vo@@ ices Latin America . &quot;
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a lived eight years in a household where she was not allowed to eat together with the family who lived there .
&quot; shortly before her gradu@@ ation at the university , she returned to the house again and heard how the owner of the house proudly spoke about her . &quot; she is like a daughter for us . &quot;
&quot; the one that has become something , &quot; she said . &quot;
but Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was never treated like a daughter in this house .
&quot; when she was ten years old she started working as Cri@@ adi@@ ta for the family . as Cri@@ adi@@ tas , in Paraguay the more than 46@@ ,000 boys and girls who are forced to work to go to school . &quot;
&quot; the business is very simple : a large family with little money passes their age @-@ old son or her under@@ age daughter to another , rich family . in exchange , the child receives food , training and a roof over the head . &quot;
&quot; but what is not mentioned , however , is that the children have to work on inn@@ um@@ erable days of house@@ work that will never be paid and victims of abuse and abuse - and all this within the framework of a contract that cannot be raised . &quot;
the practice described as Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go is widespread in Paraguay due to the participation and acceptance of large parts of society and despite numerous complaints of human rights organisations .
&quot; after completing her studies , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked for a few years for an organisation that fights for the rights of the boys and girls . &quot;
&quot; she spoke with Cri@@ adi@@ tas - especially young girls are affected by the practice of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go - collected testim@@ onies , resear@@ ched and den@@ ounced . &quot;
&quot; she tried to call things in the name , because the feeling of gratitude that is inj@@ ected to the Cri@@ adi@@ tas guarantees in general silence . &quot;
&quot; the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go is based on a double dec@@ eption , &quot; explains Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a . &quot;
&quot; on the one hand , the family , which is their daughter in the belief that they conclude their education , improve their position in society and &quot; &quot; make something out of themselves &quot; &quot; can be transferred to another family . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , the family that assi@@ sts girls and whose exploitation with faith justi@@ fies that they give someone a chance that would otherwise have no education , and perhaps even star@@ ved . &quot;
the victims of the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go
&quot; when the girl is mi@@ stre@@ ated , his family will only learn about it many years later . &quot;
sometimes they never experience it .
&quot; in January 2016 the previously relatively unknown phenomenon , which takes place in the secret in Paragu@@ ay@@ an households , got a face . &quot;
&quot; when Carolina Mar@@ ín came to the hospital in Ca@@ agu@@ az@@ ú , her body showed traces of violent b@@ lows . shortly afterwards she died . &quot;
she was 14 years old .
&quot; she was Cri@@ adi@@ ta in the household of the former military member Tom@@ ás Fer@@ rei@@ ra and his wife Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo , who works as a civil servant at the Einwohn@@ er@@ mel@@ de@@ amt . &quot;
&quot; Mar@@ ín lived with them in their house in V@@ aqu@@ er@@ ía , a small village with only 3,000 inhabitants , 250 kilometers east of the capital As@@ unci@@ ón . &quot;
&quot; at the end of January 2016 , Fer@@ rei@@ ra attacked Mar@@ ín as long as she suffered le@@ thal injury . &quot;
this should be the last punishment in the life of the young girl .
&quot; a few days later , the media reported about the incident . &quot;
they stressed that the murdered child was Cri@@ adi@@ ta .
organizations such as UN@@ IC@@ EF and Call@@ es@@ cu@@ ela were deeply responsible for the death of the girl in the Paragu@@ ay@@ an society .
they called the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go as &quot; a modern form of slavery . &quot;
several dozen people came together to protest protests and demanded that there should be no other Carolina &quot; in Paraguay .
the name of the girl and photos were widespread in the social media .
&quot; in Paraguay more cows are registered as children , &quot; Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a compl@@ ained . &quot;
without papers it is much easier to viol@@ ate the rights of children .
&quot; without official documents , it is very difficult to control under which conditions boys and girls live . &quot;
the neighbors of the couple and almost 60 civil society organisations demanded a rapid examination of the case .
&quot; they want Tom@@ ás Fer@@ rei@@ ra and Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo for the murder of the girl who was her Cri@@ adi@@ ta , sentenced to 30 years in prison . &quot;
&quot; if the case occurs in court , the case of Carolina Mar@@ ín might be a landmark - if for the first time in the history of Paragu@@ ays a case of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go arrives in court . &quot;
the everyday life of a cri@@ adi@@ ta
&quot; the Cri@@ adi@@ tas are exploited not only as workers , they also live isolated from other girls at their age . &quot;
&quot; Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was ten years old when the Far@@ bi@@ k , in which her father worked , had to register , and her father lost his work . &quot;
&quot; their brothers now had to go all work , and began selling sweets on the street or on the market to make money . &quot;
but they all went further to school .
only Tina was sent to the capital As@@ unci@@ ón as Cri@@ adi@@ ta .
&quot; in the house of their employers , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked between four and six hours each day . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , she had to share the time that she was still learning to learn . &quot;
she rose up every morning at 5 o &apos;clock and prepared breakfast for her employers .
&quot; on Fri@@ days for example , she cleaned the fridge , plast@@ ered the living room , polished the furniture and dis@@ infected the floor . &quot;
&quot; when the school was finished , she went home again and had time to learn . &quot;
&quot; the more she was done with learning , the more free time she had . &quot;
but also this time was limited because they had to make dinner for their employers .
&quot; Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a says she never had to star@@ ve , but didn &apos;t get unlimited food . &quot; I was allowed to pick up more books from the house@@ keeper &apos;s library as food from the fridge , &quot; she rec@@ alls . &quot;
&quot; the library was well equipped and belonged to the landlord , a former military and sympath@@ is@@ ant of the Parti@@ do Liber@@ al , a liberal party that was in power during the dictatorship of Al@@ fre@@ do Stro@@ ess@@ ner , who was in power from 1954 to 1989 . &quot;
&quot; in some evenings the host Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a forced to stand beside him and read editorial articles from &quot; &quot; Sender@@ o &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; El Pu@@ eb@@ lo &quot; . &quot; &quot;
he tried to convince them to give no faith to the reports of the official media about the dict@@ ator &apos;s regime .
&quot; but he kept them intelligent , but did not go with her . &quot; &quot; the host had found someone who listened to while talking about politics , &quot; &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; they didn &apos;t often allow me to visit my family because they thought that I would learn &quot; bad habits again there &quot; . &quot; this meant that Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a , which belongs to the indigenous group of Guar@@ ani , would again speak to her native language Guar@@ an@@ í . &quot;
&quot; their Lord feared that they would lose their education , which they had made possible to lose again , they explain . &quot;
&quot; she was , however , completely clear that she had paid for everything she got from them with her hard work . &quot;
&quot; also at school , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was discri@@ min@@ ated against . &quot; one thing , about which almost never is spoken , are bul@@ lying and the chic@@ anes where Cri@@ adi@@ tas are exposed when they go to school . &quot;
&quot; because the other children have parents , they immediately realize that someone who has no parents , is a cri@@ adi@@ ta . &quot;
I couldn &apos;t invite anyone to my home . I had no friends in school or in the neighborhood .
&quot; in my youth , in the time when friend@@ ships arise , I feel particularly clear that I belong to no group . &quot;

the society appro@@ ves the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go
&quot; in January 2015 , a woman published the following text in a Facebook group where you can share job advertisements for cleaning personnel and child girls in Paraguay . &quot;
&quot; the administration of the group is Pep@@ a Kos@@ ti@@ an@@ ov@@ sky , a town coun@@ cill@@ or in the district of As@@ unci@@ ón . &quot;
Hello ! I am looking for a little companion for my little daughter who plays with her in the morning and in the afternoon .
learn .
please announce yourselves .
&quot; starting from Monday , if possible . &quot;
the ad got five &quot; likes &quot; and lots of comments .
a woman from the place Ñ@@ em@@ by wrote that she had a eleven year girl and gave her telephone number .
&quot; another woman , who also came from Ñ@@ em@@ by , offered her 15 @-@ year ni@@ ece . &quot; she likes little children and is very pretty , &quot; she wrote . &quot;
&quot; in the third comment , &quot; a girl from the country inside , would like to work . &quot; &quot;
then the writing in the display split once again :
&quot; dear friends , I have found one . I see if it works with it . &quot;
&quot; thanks , I write again when something is . &quot;
the business was completed .
&quot; in the pro@@ log on the report Cri@@ adi@@ tas , ¿ ha@@ sta cu@@ án@@ do ? &quot;
&quot; ( Cri@@ adi@@ tas , how long still ? ) , a collection of testim@@ onies of former Cri@@ adi@@ tas , writes Or@@ ti@@ z : &quot;
&quot; in the course of our history , we have managed to abol@@ ish systems such as slavery , Cu@@ ñ@@ ad@@ az@@ go ( a practice from the early history of Paraguay ) , in which the Spanish Con@@ qui@@ stad@@ ores ( the Spanish Con@@ qui@@ stad@@ ores , the women of Guar@@ an@@ í have had to be paid and Spanish in@@ doctr@@ ination ) , in which the Spanish conqu@@ er@@ ors had to turn into a system of slavery , in which they become light victims of abuse and exploitation . &quot;
the social ine@@ quality in Paraguay and that to show power are the key to understanding the phenomenon known as Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go .
bill writes Egypt users of social media to register with the government

published under Public Domain CC@@ 0 .
sixty Egyptian parliam@@ ent@@ arians recently approved a draft bill on &quot; Reg@@ ulations on the use and use of social networks . &quot;
&quot; if it is accepted by parliament , users and users of social media in Egypt must register with a government agency to use social media including Facebook and Twitter . &quot;
&quot; on the basis of the law , a place would be set up that is mand@@ ated to use citizens to share a permit to share social media . &quot;
* Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop . Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; if it failed to do so , it could result in a penalty of up to six months in prison or a cash bu@@ ckle . &quot;
&quot; the draft constitution consisting of six paragraph and in local media including You@@ m@@ 7 and Egypt Independent , defines social media as &quot; jed@@ we@@ de application , which is going through the Internet and is used to communicate with others using voice , vide@@ ophone and text . &quot;
&quot; it is un@@ clear how the law is en@@ forced when it is accepted , as the draft does not indicate how Egyptian authorities should impose the registration on the users and users who do not register in the face of the fact that the Egyptian government is currently unable to guarantee regulation at the level of social media companies . &quot;
&quot; Ri@@ y@@ ad Ab@@ dul Satt@@ ar , Member of Parliament and promot@@ er of the bill , told the magazine Al @-@ Monitor , registered users and users received a username and password to get through the fire@@ wall , which blocked Facebook . &quot;
&quot; this could mean that Egypt plans to er@@ ect a fire@@ wall at a national level on Facebook . because of them , it would be necessary for Egyptians to submit information on their identity to access the network . &quot;
but so far it is not known that such plans exist .
experts on site are scep@@ tical about the technical feasi@@ bility of the proposal .
&quot; Ram@@ y Ra@@ o@@ of , Senior Research Techn@@ ologist ( in German &quot; &quot; senior research techn@@ ologist &quot; &quot; ) of the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights ( E@@ IP@@ R , in German &quot; &quot; Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights &quot; &quot; ) , told Global Vo@@ ices : &quot;
I doubt the technical capacities and the understanding of any authority in Egypt concerning things that have to do with technology .
&quot; in my opinion , they imagine that just as they can be done by force on physical public and private spaces , it could also be done online . &quot;
&quot; if I take them seriously , it means they will set up a powerful surveillance system to filter citizens who seek approval or not . and that means a mad system to monitor people &apos;s activities and also to bring them to a court process . &quot;
&quot; this is technically by no means realistic , but in Egypt everything is possible . &quot;
&quot; in order to be adopted as a law , the draft must first be discussed with the legislat@@ ure of Parliament and constitutional committees before it comes to the plenary debate . &quot;
&quot; whether his acceptance and enforcement will succeed or not , the draft &quot; is in line with a pro @-@ military thought in parliament , in whose sense the control is maxim@@ ized and ensuring that no devi@@ ating nar@@ ration is present on the image surface , &quot; says Ra@@ o@@ of . &quot;
&quot; last year , the Parliament of Parliament Tam@@ er El @-@ Sha@@ haw@@ y proposed a bill against cy@@ ber crime in which a li@@ fel@@ ong sentence for those found guilty of threatening the &quot; public order &quot; and &quot; protest against protest . &quot; &quot;

&quot; high up in the mountains of Kur@@ dist@@ an in the north @-@ east of Iraq , the veter@@ in@@ ist H@@ ana Ahmed R@@ aza and her team of scientists of the non @-@ governmental organisation Nature Iraq are working to protect the gh@@ ost@@ ly Persian le@@ op@@ ard . &quot;
&quot; a sub@@ type of the larger family of le@@ op@@ ards , which fights through Africa and Asia , belong to the Persian le@@ op@@ ards ( Pan@@ ther@@ a par@@ dus sax@@ ic@@ ol@@ or ) . altogether , there are between 800 and 1,000 animals , such as the International Union for Conservation of Nature . &quot;
why is this certain type of le@@ op@@ ards so important ?
&quot; as R@@ aza appears in the video , the Persian le@@ op@@ ard is the only survi@@ ving pre@@ dat@@ or in the Kur@@ dish ecosystem . &quot;
&quot; the chance to see a Persian le@@ op@@ ard in fact is low and goes against zero . as the team in the video therefore determines that they have a shot of a big cat in the camera , R@@ aza breaks out in pure joy . &quot;
&quot; as a bi@@ ologist , R@@ aza passion@@ ately shows a different side of her country , which is not only of war and conflict . &quot;

&quot; in early March 2017 , the Daily K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o , responsible for North East Japan , has been progres@@ sing to re@@ build the lives of those affected by the &quot; triple @-@ disaster &quot; of March 2011 . a huge earthquake , a ts@@ un@@ ami and an atomic accident in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma triggered the catastrophe . &quot;
&quot; the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper has its headquarters in Sen@@ da@@ i , which is located in Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i pre@@ f@@ ecture . Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i pre@@ f@@ ecture was a great pre@@ f@@ ecture in Japan &apos;s Nor@@ theast , which had to experience both the earthquake and the ts@@ un@@ ami . &quot;
&quot; hundreds of thousands of people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and the neighbouring pre@@ fec@@ tures of Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma and I@@ w@@ ate were forced to attack , as the ts@@ un@@ ami had disappeared whole coastal cities from the map . &quot;
&quot; in addition to this , Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma pre@@ f@@ ecture has experienced a nuclear accident , already alone , 160 000 inhabitants had to leave their homes . &quot;
the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o &apos;s special report shows the progress achieved six years later in order to re@@ build the lives of local residents .
the detailed report of the newspaper includes both the statistics of the Japanese re@@ building and the survey results of the affected persons themselves .
&quot; the housing situation in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate &quot;
&quot; the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper reports that up to December 2015 , a total of 77 per cent of the planned replacement houses ( since the public , sa@@ ig@@ ai k@@ ou@@ ei ju@@ ut@@ ak@@ u ) were completed in the pre@@ fec@@ tures of Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i posted the biggest success among the three pre@@ fec@@ tures , here 80 percent of the planned replacement houses were completed . &quot;
&quot; I@@ w@@ ate has completed 75 percent of such houses , whereas Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma with 70 percent is the final light . &quot;
&quot; however , even six years after the catastrophe , the ev@@ acu@@ ated of ma@@ kes@@ hi@@ ft shel@@ ters ( of the power of power , cas@@ et@@ su ju@@ ut@@ ak@@ u ) are still trying to reloc@@ ate to final replacement houses , even six years after the catastrophe . &quot;
&quot; after the three @-@ fold catastrophe , nearly 80 000 people were forced to live in homes . &quot;
&quot; in December 2016 still 36 000 people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma and I@@ w@@ ate lived in such cases . &quot;
&quot; nearly 40 percent of the Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma ev@@ acu@@ ated in 2011 still live in emergency shel@@ ters , whereas Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was more successful on this occasion . more than 75 percent of the ev@@ ac@@ uation , which were hau@@ led after the disaster in Beh@@ el@@ fs@@ enthal , were moved into final houses . &quot;
&quot; for I@@ w@@ ate , the number is here at 34 percent . &quot;
the state of work and everyday life in the three affected pre@@ fec@@ tures
&quot; as the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper was able to determine , 10@@ 74 of 1100 schools , who were affected by the mis@@ fortune , opened their doors until December 2016 , which accounts for almost 98 percent of the schools of the three pre@@ fec@@ tures . &quot;
&quot; six years later , the industrial reconstruction in the three pre@@ fec@@ tures is far more difficult . &quot;
&quot; while nearly 100 percent of the fishing ports in I@@ w@@ ate and Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i are now in operation , only 30 percent of the fishing ports in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma have res@@ um@@ ed its operation . &quot;
the ts@@ un@@ ami and the nuclear accident occurred in the three pre@@ fec@@ tures of agr@@ arian countries .
&quot; Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i could restore 93 percent of its agricultural land , whereby only 66 percent of the agricultural land in I@@ w@@ ate and less than 50 percent destroyed land land in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma can be used again . &quot;
&quot; it is unlikely that this is just a consequence of the nuclear accident , as only 690 hectares of 5 400 hectares of destroyed land of Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , lying in the &quot; nuclear barrier zone . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in two of the three pre@@ fec@@ tures , tourism has recovered extensively and Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma lag@@ s far away . &quot;
&quot; the tourist numbers in Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate are back to 90 per cent on the same level , as before the mis@@ fortune . Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , on the other hand , can show only 75 percent . &quot;
&quot; however , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper reports that since the disaster nearly half of the coastal inhabitants , it seems harder to earn their livel@@ ihood . &quot;
is the native population prepared for the next big earthquake ?
&quot; in order to establish an overall picture , the paper conducted numerous surveys among the local population and under the ev@@ ac@@ uation . &quot;
in her introduction of the article the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o @-@ Zeitung explains :
the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o conducted a survey to learn more about the ts@@ un@@ ami consciousness among the local population .
&quot; the survey revealed that 8@@ 3.1 percent of local residents , measures have taken action to be prepared for future earthqu@@ akes and ts@@ un@@ am@@ is . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
how it is about those who had to ev@@ acu@@ ated Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma pre@@ f@@ ecture
&quot; in its issue on the anniversary of the earthquake , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper has intensi@@ fied its attention to the situation of the ev@@ ac@@ uation of Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma . &quot;
&quot; Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma did not only have to witness the tremendous earthquake and devast@@ ating ts@@ un@@ ami , no , Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma pre@@ f@@ ecture was also witness to the worst , cat@@ astrop@@ hic , nuclear accident that Japan had ever experienced . &quot;
&quot; from 160 000 ev@@ acu@@ ated from Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , nearly 63 000 people were transferred to areas outside the pre@@ f@@ ecture . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of 2016 some more than 22,@@ 000 people were moved back to Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , in permanent replacement houses . &quot;
&quot; after the 2017 stand still 40 000 inhabitants live in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , outside of their home pre@@ f@@ ecture . &quot;
&quot; in the disaster areas most of the ev@@ acu@@ ees still are older than 50 years old . they are well known because efforts to re@@ build Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , I@@ w@@ ate and Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma have to compete with massive construction projects . these are construction projects that are part of the Olympic Games that will take place in Tokyo 2020 . &quot;
the world is small : our pod@@ cast &quot; In@@ to the Deep &quot;
&quot; when you meet people from other countries speaking a different language , the differences seem to be bigger than the simil@@ arities . &quot;
&quot; after a while , however , one often realis@@ es that a more links than it seems at first sight . &quot;
&quot; these global connections are important , as they challenge our prejudi@@ ces , expand our perspectives and remind us that the world is ultimately very small . &quot;
&quot; in this episode of In@@ to the Deep , the Global Vo@@ ices Pod@@ cast , we look closely at these global connections . in our In@@ to the Deep Pod@@ cast we deal with topics that often get less attention in reporting than they deserve . &quot;
&quot; we speak to five global Vo@@ ices members , who remember a moment when they have felt very strongly connected with someone over language and country boundaries . &quot;
&quot; Ver@@ oni@@ ka Kri@@ kon@@ i talks about the simil@@ arities between Greek and Turkish , Tor@@ i E@@ gher@@ man explains how the love of music has led to the lack of common language skills during a journey in the rural China , and Jo@@ ey Ay@@ ou@@ b looks back on his experiences he has collected in a small village in Madagascar . &quot;

Brazilian activ@@ ist in the artificial coma after being beaten up by the police in nationwide demonstrations
left : the attack against Mat@@ eus Fer@@ rei@@ ra da Silva . photo : Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z . publication with permission .
right : Mat@@ eus Fer@@ rei@@ ra da Silva on a widespread photo .
a Brazilian student at the age of 33 was delivered this week to the intensive care unit : last Friday a police officer had beaten him against his head during a demonstration in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia . millions of demonstr@@ ators took part in a protest march against austerity measures .
&quot; Mat@@ eus Fer@@ rei@@ ra da Silva , studied social sciences at the Federal University of Go@@ i@@ ás , suffered a skull @-@ brain trau@@ ma and several frac@@ tures . &quot;
doctors operated on this Saturday and took him into an artificial coma .
his condition is considered critical .
the local photo journalist Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z made photos of the attack on Mat@@ eus that quickly spread in Brazil within a few days .
&quot; on the pictures is also the face of the police officer , who attacked with a stroke . the man was identified as Augu@@ sto S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o . &quot;
&quot; after the incident , the military police in the Brazilian state of Go@@ i@@ ás were known that S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o was suspended until the examination of the incident from the active ministry . &quot;
the pictures show the police officers as he suggests in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia with his head@@ stock on the face of the student Mat@@ eus Fer@@ rei@@ ra ( photos : Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z ) .
&quot; if a police officer would be beaten up by a demonstr@@ ator and landing on the intensive care station , his face would be six months long on TV and the entire supp@@ ression would be justified . &quot;
&quot; the Facebook page &quot; Des@@ neur@@ aliz@@ ador , &quot; a press channel of media activists from Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia , shared the video taken by Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z in which you can see how Mat@@ eus attacked by the police officer and several sanitary blocks shortly afterwards . &quot;
&quot; another video with the same scenes , but fil@@ med from another perspective , has also appeared in social networks . &quot;
in the clip shown below you can see the attack on Mat@@ eus from the 50@@ th second .
&quot; for the family of Mat@@ eus who lives in another federal state , Internet users now donated 10.000 Brazi@@ li@@ ans ( about 2,@@ 700 Euro ) to cover part of the cost of medical treatment and to allow his family to stay in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia while being in the hospital . &quot;
&quot; be brave , Mat@@ eus . &quot;
against police violence . &quot;
the drawing has been shared several times in social networks .

&quot; on Facebook , Professor Pablo Ort@@ ell@@ ado inv@@ okes further acts of violence against activists in Go@@ i@@ ás : &quot;
&quot; Go@@ i@@ ás has been witn@@ essing a wave of political violence : here , the activ@@ ist Gu@@ il@@ her@@ me Irish was murdered by his father because he was sab@@ ot@@ aging the Occup@@ y movement in secondary schools . and now we have the very sad case of Mat@@ eus Fer@@ rei@@ ra da Silva , who has been attacked by a police officer , who hit him with a head@@ stock . &quot;
N@@ ext@@ Last
&quot; in the last Friday , Go@@ i@@ ás was not the only state in Brazil , where last Friday was the brutal police action against demonstr@@ ators . &quot;
&quot; police officers were in protests in the centre of Rio de Janeiro , where prot@@ esters had built a stage for speakers , rubber sho@@ cks and tear gas . &quot;
&quot; the MP Fla@@ vio Ser@@ af@@ ini , Social and Peace Party ( P@@ SO@@ L ) , asked the police to refra@@ in from speaking against demonstr@@ ators via loud@@ speakers . &quot;
&quot; this also includes a report in Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo , one of the oldest newspapers throughout the country . &quot;
&quot; once again , the Brazilian media stra@@ pped road protests by focusing on another , unexpected protagon@@ ist : a window . &quot;
the Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo and Est@@ ado de S. Paulo talked specifically about a broken glass window to illustr@@ atively design their title pages with a photo .
&quot; on the other hand , the O Glob@@ o preferred a title story with a bus placed on fire . &quot;
&quot; there is no plau@@ sible journ@@ alistic reason , more about a broken window of windows than the protests of thousands of people who serve the defense of a special matter . &quot;
this must also be recognised if you are strictly against any form of damage .
&quot; here too , the term &quot; v@@ and@@ alism &quot; is absurd , disp@@ rop@@ or@@ tion@@ ate significance , and the typical violence of the military police is covered by head@@ lines with the title &quot; prot@@ esters on confrontation course with the police . &quot; &quot;
the Vill@@ ages of the Un@@ induc@@ t@@ alisation of Un@@ ch@@ art@@ ed Vill@@ ages in Cuba
&quot; with the introduction of the law of Á@@ l@@ varo Re@@ yn@@ oso , nearly hundreds of sugar cane factories in Cuba joined the doors ( Photo : Ju@@ lio B@@ ati@@ sta ) &quot;
&quot; the village Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ é Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich , located in the western Cub@@ an province of May@@ abe@@ que , is generally known as el Central - in Spanish sugar mill - not@@ with@@ standing that there is no significant sugar harvest on site . &quot;
it is two years since the activities in the sugar cane factories were paraly@@ zed .
&quot; after that the sugar cane industry stood still in the region , and the factory gradually lost its plants until only the sm@@ ells of steel and concrete remained . &quot;
approximately 272 workers had to re@@ inv@@ ent themselves .
some changed the work .
others res@@ igned and commu@@ te daily to the factories .
&quot; N@@ ene , a soldier veter@@ an who stands up every day at 4 : 00 a.m. , the crisis in the sugar cane industry does not bol@@ ster his sleep . &quot;
&quot; he heard that there are sugar cane factories in the east , which after a long in@@ active time are in operation because they were preserved . &quot;
that was something he did not expect .
&quot; N@@ ene rec@@ alls that in Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich the sugar cane factory would be preserved , but the promise was not kept . &quot;
&quot; the sugar cane industry has already resist@@ ed the pl@@ agues , the fall of socialism , low market prices , in@@ efficiency , bad management decisions and climate change . &quot;
&quot; in 2016 , production was 1.6 million tons of sugar , less than the 1910 producing quantity . &quot;
&quot; the message would have been a motive for concern for the country some decades ago , but the bad harv@@ ests are not a news anymore . &quot;
why was the Cub@@ an sugar cane industry turned off ?
the old platform of the church saw a better time .
( photo : Ju@@ lio B@@ ati@@ sta )
&quot; the reduction of the sugar cane industry was an economic necessity : the 155 sugar cane factories were technically obsol@@ ete , and hardly competitive they became unten@@ able for the country . &quot;
&quot; the initial idea was to concentrate production on the most efficient factories , the annual production objective was 4 million tonnes . &quot;
&quot; they left only factories , which can produce sugar for a maximum of 4 Cent@@ av@@ os ( 0,@@ 03 euros ) . &quot;
the solution for unemployment ?
the motives that led to such measures were the low productivity of sugar cane plant@@ ations and the sugar crisis on the world market .
&quot; nevertheless , the sugar rate rose again about a decade ago . &quot;
&quot; from 2017 to 2025 , the price of un@@ refined sugar must remain between 15 and 16 Cent@@ av@@ os per po@@ und , according to the 2016 report &quot; Land@@ economic perspectives &quot; published by the OECD and FA@@ O , the Agriculture and Food Organisation of the United Nations . &quot;
&quot; if the current production would reach the level of 2001 ( 3.6 million tonnes ) , raw sugar imports would generate around 85 million dollars for the country . &quot;
not everything went well
&quot; the present day will certainly go into history , &quot; &quot; these were the first words of the Cub@@ an President F@@ ide@@ l Castro during his speech on 21 October 2002 at the Sugar Factory in Lav@@ ander@@ o . &quot;
&quot; from then on , the process of restructuring in the sugar industry began . &quot;
&quot; in the following years , a total of 98 sugar cane factories , more than 65 million people , received their full salary for further education . &quot;
&quot; the same happened in the sugar cane factory Greg@@ orio Ar@@ l@@ ée Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich on May 14 , 2004 . &quot;
Luis Alberto Pé@@ rez worked in the factory since 1967 .
&quot; when N@@ ene , as he is known as a soldier , talks about the closure of the factory , the word he is most repeated is &quot; sc@@ am . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; in order for the place to be preserved , they formed a full @-@ time working group . &quot;
&quot; before the first year of the year , the first letters began to come . &quot;
&quot; it was officially distributed documents , which would be distinguished only with regard to the parts that would be removed , the address sat and the date . &quot;
&quot; all were signed by U@@ lis@@ es Ros@@ ales del Toro , only the minister could appro@@ ve any withdrawal . &quot;
&quot; from then on , the responsibility was taken over and the letters were getting more and more frequent . &quot;
&quot; Juan Carlos River@@ o was responsible for the tac@@ kled factory for two years and he was one who received the letters . &quot; &quot; the country had no money for the sugar cane factories in operation , &quot; he ass@@ ures . &quot;
&quot; Ed@@ dy Re@@ yes , 64 years , awaits the retirement in another plant , the Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma . &quot;
&quot; he was involved against his will in the shut@@ down of the factory , whose construction he helped . &quot;
&quot; with every part he removed , he disman@@ tled one of his 31 working years . &quot;
the most developed industrial area of Cuba and the most important work bench was wi@@ ped out .
&quot; in many cases , there were no alternatives for the work stations and services that were generated in the communities in which they were located . &quot;
&quot; we will never know whether during the Mam@@ mut &apos;s speech of 21 October 2002 , the former President saw in the eyes of the people present , when he guaranteed that for the areas whose factories were no longer in operation for five years , everything would run well . &quot;
the price of the population for the closure of the sugar cane factories
since 2004 sugar cane is extracted only highly by grinding .
( photo : Ju@@ lio B@@ ati@@ sta )
&quot; after two years , the Volks@@ gemeinde Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ é Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich learnt that many things change , but not always for the better when a factory is closed . &quot;
&quot; as the sugar cane factory closed , or better said , when they began to medit@@ ate it , they also stopped to asp@@ hal@@ ve the road , this also dis@@ advant@@ aged other farms . &quot;

first Nations young people use Hip @-@ Hop to express themselves and get their own culture
recording of a song from &quot; Home to Me &quot; - Gr@@ assy Nar@@ rows First Nation .
photo used with permission of N &apos;@@ we Jin@@ an .
&quot; young people of the First Nations communities throughout Canada are dealing with topics that are important to them . they do it through hip hop , thanks to a number of hiking workshops . &quot;
&quot; since 2014 , as part of the N &apos;@@ we Jin@@ an tour , workshops are bringing workshops directly to schools and youth centres to teach youth groups song@@ writing , recording , audio and video production and live performances . &quot;
the original workshops were led by the P@@ äd@@ ag@@ ogen David Ho@@ dges who lives in Montreal and worked in north @-@ Quebec with ten Cre@@ e communities and then worked together with the Cre@@ e Hip @-@ Hop @-@ group The North@@ Star .
&quot; the workshop assumes that young participants in conversation issues topics such as &quot; cultural identity , speech , debate , love , self @-@ acceptance , &quot; or whatever the meaning of them . &quot;
these questions are inspiration for songs and videos in which the young people are the main actors .
&quot; because the workshops were so popular , the team also worked with other First Nations communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and was invited to organise similar workshops with the tribe of Win@@ ne@@ b@@ ago in Neb@@ ras@@ ka . &quot;
&quot; this video of the school &apos; Na Ak@@ sa Gy@@ il@@ ak &apos;@@ Yo@@ o in the region of the tribe of the Kit@@ sum@@ kal@@ um First Nation in British Columbia , for example , called the history of Highway 16 , also called &quot; Highway of T@@ ears , &quot; a road section in West@@ kan@@ ada , where almost two dozen mostly indigenous young women disappeared or were murdered . &quot;
the cases were largely un@@ solved .
the next video of the Nem@@ as@@ ka Cre@@ e First Nation uses the motif of a video game to convey how important the preservation of traditional customs and customs despite the influences through globalization .
&quot; many of the songs appeared in indigenous languages , although the young people don &apos;t always dominate the languages of the First Nations . &quot;
&quot; in the following song that Wh@@ ap@@ mag@@ oo@@ stu@@ i Cre@@ e First Nation received , the refra@@ in is sung on Cre@@ e . &quot;
&quot; the young people involved here received some help from Gary J@@ olly of the North@@ star hip @-@ hop group , who gave them a rop@@ he in the dial@@ ect Eastern James Bay Cre@@ e . &quot;
&quot; on the Facebook page of N &apos;@@ we Jin@@ an , the St@@ rop@@ he is available in tran@@ script , as well a translation into English translated into German : &quot;
sometimes I feel as if nobody ever wanted to be interested in me
but I try to go on my days on earth
this is the day you will take our cry out .
because we have lost our way in life as a youth
but I believe that we will rise to one day
I don &apos;t want to see how they live a bad life
&quot; thus , they can grow and also go ahead with our youth . &quot;
so they can do what they intended for the Creator .
&quot; in the comment section , readers and supporters of the Cre@@ e language Kevin Bro@@ us@@ se@@ au also make a contribution and adds the St@@ rop@@ he to Sil@@ ben@@ schrift ( which is also published on his blog and published here with permission ) : &quot;
&quot; in Japan , plastic dishes are not only shown in the restaurant &quot;

in Japan you can see plastic dishes in front of almost any restaurant .
&quot; to show potential customers what is exactly on the menu , are located near the entrance sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin san@@ pur@@ u ( &quot; &quot; Plastic models of the dishes &quot; &quot; ) from any food served in this restaurant . &quot;
customers see these plastic dishes and then decide whether they enter the restaurant or go on .
there is a whole industry dedicated to the production of these plastic dishes .
&quot; in the to@@ ki@@ oter district of Kapp@@ ab@@ ashi , there are a variety of these small businesses that produce those plastic dishes that the German film@@ maker W@@ im Wen@@ ders documented in his film Tokyo @-@ G@@ a more than 20 years ago . &quot;
&quot; for most Japanese , these plastic dishes are so common that they do not even notice them any more . however , a new trend now turns them into show@@ y cell phone accessories and other gad@@ gets . &quot;
&quot; at Na@@ ver Mat@@ oma , the blo@@ gger it@@ ini@@ i released series of social media links and photos showing this unusual twist with the sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin san@@ pur@@ u . &quot;
now in special sale : new decorated with plastic stra@@ pped mobile phones as shown in the Ki@@ chi@@ jo@@ ji Tok@@ y@@ u department store .
&quot; many of these artificial foods have been turned into kit@@ sch collec@@ ti@@ bles , as in this case , refrigerator mag@@ nets : &quot;
here are a few Sho@@ ku@@ hin refriger@@ ators for a new exhibition in Tokyo Station .
the new boom of the Essen@@ ti@@ als is increasingly complex .
&quot; in this case , an emperor @-@ don ( a popular rice bowl with seafood ) was transformed into a mobile stand . &quot;
for this tri@@ angular bowl ( lol ) we found a good use as a mobile stand .
we also made this part for the exhibition at the Tokyo station .
and here is an apple that holds your mobile phone :
&quot; designed to look like an apple , with a not@@ ch for the cell phone , this is already a great design . &quot;
and that is just the beginning of an increasing approach into the comp@@ ass .
&quot; some mobile phones and cell phone designers allow you to make your own artwork . in this case , i@@ kur@@ a or laugh@@ ing is used , a popular t@@ opping that is served with white rice . &quot;
on Twitter some users had their doubts :
&quot; there &apos;s someone who would say : &quot; wow , cool , now I can decor@@ ate my mobile with salmon che@@ ating ? &quot;
I think I will be the only one .
&quot; this interest in plastic dishes can also take a less appe@@ tiz@@ ing form to surprise , for example , colleagues or family members unpleasant . &quot;
our latest mobile phone stand has the form of mel@@ low ice .
&quot; in addition , we also have rice balls ( O@@ ni@@ gir@@ i ) , earrings and hand@@ y@@ bands made of dried salmon . &quot;
&quot; you can watch other sk@@ ur@@ r@@ ile plastic dishes at : it@@ ini@@ i &apos;s Na@@ ver Mat@@ oma blog post . or follow the h@@ ash@@ tag # &quot;
&quot; if you want to learn more about the origin of this trend , this video gives you an insight into the neighborhood of Kapp@@ ab@@ ashi , which is devoted to the supply of the restaurant industry . for example , with the sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin san@@ pur@@ u . &quot;
the following video shows how the Japanese plastic dishes are actually produced .
a Mexican project tells stories of the survivors of the struggle against organised crime
&quot; for the victims of the fight against drug traff@@ icking . &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; in reports in domestic and foreign media about the not@@ orious &quot; &quot; fight against drug traff@@ icking &quot; &quot; in Mexico , the mis@@ fortun@@ es and killed regularly only appear in statistics . however , they do not reflect the extent of the human tragedy that ent@@ ails this struggle . &quot;
&quot; reporting on drug bos@@ ses , such as El Ch@@ apo Gu@@ z@@ m@@ án , the chief of the Sin@@ alo@@ a cart@@ el , completely pressed the stories of the victims of the conflict completely into the background . &quot;
&quot; on the day after a violent incident , hardly anyone looks at the gri@@ eving or the churches that have learned to live with the pain . &quot;
&quot; behind every body , behind every bone discovery in the hundreds of secret tom@@ bs , the stories of countless parents , sons and daughters , friends and partners whose wounds may never be healed . &quot;
&quot; this is why the Mexican News Portal Animal Pol@@ í@@ tico has launched the digital project &quot; &quot; ap@@ render a Vi@@ vir Con El Nar@@ co &quot; &quot; ( German : &quot; &quot; learning about drug traff@@ icking &quot; &quot; ) that is meant to give this sacrifice a voice and stories of people that came into the fight between law enforcement authorities and cart@@ els . &quot;
animal Pol@@ í@@ tico describes the project so :
organized crime can not only be feared by our lives .
the effects are much deeper .
&quot; for example , if shops close because they are threatened by drug dealers and whole communities need to drive many kilometers to buy something like milk . &quot;
the Pain of the Vic@@ tims
&quot; a video entitled &quot; &quot; Vi@@ e@@ que Cam@@ bian p@@ or el mi@@ edo &quot; &quot; ( German : &quot; &quot; as fear life changes &quot; &quot; ) tells exactly these stories . &quot;
&quot; a main character is Guadal@@ upe , a father who is looking for secret tom@@ bs after his son . &quot;
&quot; Emma Vel@@ eta Ro@@ dr@@ í@@ gu@@ ez , who lost her father , her four si@@ bl@@ ings only one day , lost her husband and two of her ne@@ ph@@ ews . &quot;
&quot; priests : &quot; &quot; like every Sunday , we prepare ourselves again today for the task that we have set ourselves to go and to gra@@ ves , according to the people we have loved . &quot;
Guadal@@ upe Con@@ tr@@ eras : &quot; my son is called Antonio Ivan Con@@ tr@@ eras Mat@@ a .
he was 28 when he disappeared .
he has three children .
he worked in an electric business in El Nar@@ an@@ jo .
on 13 October he left the house .
&quot; on October 15th he should be back again , but he never returned . &quot; Emma Vel@@ eta : &quot; it &apos;s very hard for me , because I am now alone with three children who need training . &quot;
&quot; there is also my mother , who is here with me too . &quot;
at the moment she has no income .
&quot; you are entitled to the insurance of my father , but they do not pay them out because they require a death certificate . &quot;
&quot; where should we get that ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
the editors of &quot; ap@@ render a vi@@ vir con el Nar@@ co &quot; explain why the project is so important :
&quot; we have to show not only the faces of those who are afraid . we have to show the international community the conflicts , frag@@ ility and government leadership . &quot;
the project is based on stories of readers and reports of journalists in high @-@ risk areas .
here are some excer@@ pts from the stories .
&quot; K@@ Y@@ HB , a reader of Animal Pol@@ í@@ tico , wrote this article from Tax@@ co , in the Federal State of Gu@@ err@@ ero in central Mexico . &quot;
&quot; their contribution reminds us that violence should never be regarded as normal , no matter what form they occur : &quot;
I have already known disease and sens@@ ational journ@@ alism for a few years now .
I am coming to newspaper ki@@ os@@ ks every day and see the title pages with pictures that can actually only come from a text@@ book for crimin@@ ology or from specialists from specialists .
it brings me out of the frame .
sometimes I feel as if I am the only one who is disgu@@ sting or sad . it works like a lack of respect towards the person who once belonged to this body .
I cannot be in@@ different or consider this as normal .
she writes on :
&quot; no , it &apos;s not normal that my 10 year old c@@ ousin thinks that he wants to become Nar@@ co ( German : drug traff@@ ick@@ ers ) when he is big . and it &apos;s not normal that people hear songs about &quot; &quot; hero@@ ism &quot; &quot; of offen@@ ders when they go through the streets . &quot;
&quot; for me , it is as if they ridi@@ cul@@ ate those who have lost someone and those who have fear that something happens to them . &quot;
I see our weakness if stories are to be mere figures in a statistic .
&quot; the in@@ som@@ nia of people is incredible for me , when the death of six people and the dis@@ appearance of 43 students in a neighboring town are justified by the fact that they were &quot; &quot; rebel@@ li@@ ous &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; I think they try to say that they are spar@@ ed by such trage@@ dies , if they are not stir@@ ring and quiet . &quot;
&quot; Mari@@ bel L. from Mexico City wrote the contribution &quot; Four months of black@@ mail in the capital district , &quot; as a family with threats was lo@@ oted . &quot; in this , it describes how armed criminal month black@@ mail@@ ed money from their business until they destroyed not only the business but also torn their family apart . &quot;
you think of everything you have lost and how many people can completely change your life in just a few days .
&quot; pain is never going on , the trau@@ ma remains , the fear comes up again when you are alone . &quot;
&quot; habits have changed , telephone numbers too . &quot;
we only contact us if it is absolutely necessary .
&quot; the more we are apart from each other , the better . &quot;
she concluded her report with the words :
&quot; we want the others to be arrested , as you don &apos;t know when they will kid@@ n@@ ap or kill you . &quot;
&quot; in those terrible days I asked if wines would dis@@ solve my deep @-@ rooted feelings , but the response is no , because I forgot how to cry . I have to learn how to live with the pain . &quot;
&quot; the journalist , Mario Gu@@ ti@@ ér@@ rez Vega , published the article &quot; The For@@ gotten Children of Ci@@ u@@ dad Ju@@ á@@ rez : a generation of violence . &quot;
in the introduction he raises questions like : who cares about the child of a missing woman and a man who was murdered by organized crime ?
how is it to grow in a settlement on the edge of the most dangerous city of Mexico ?
&quot; he is not like other boys of his age , whose parents care about them . &quot;
&quot; Br@@ yan is a orph@@ an and he tells that he had to teach himself how to cook egg , potatoes , tor@@ till@@ as and make &quot; Chi@@ chi &quot; for the babies who live with him . this is his name for the preparation of the bottles with water , sugar and milk powder . &quot;
he tells of the nine sc@@ ars on his left leg - one for every year of life .
but they are in@@ significant compared to the pain in his eyes - un@@ speak@@ ably for a boy for whom all life consists of violence and who had to learn to live .
&quot; when he was five years old , he told him that his mother was gone . &quot;
but this was not the day when his childhood ended .
&quot; his childhood had been past two years before , when he was only a few blocks away from his home , the bloody cor@@ p@@ se of his father , who had been shot by armed men from a passing car . &quot;
&quot; born in Br@@ yan , the situation in Ju@@ á@@ rez looked like this : &quot;
&quot; Br@@ yan was born in 2006 , as violence by organised crime and the fight against the already existing social problems in Ju@@ á@@ rez . &quot;
&quot; in 2008 , 2009 and 2010 , Ju@@ á@@ rez was the most dangerous city in the world because of the number of mur@@ ders for public security and government of the government of the United States . &quot;
&quot; in 2010 alone , the Public Prosec@@ utor &apos;s Office counted 3@@ 103 Mor@@ de . this corresponds to the average of 8.5 Mor@@ den per day . &quot;
these are just a few of hundreds of thousands of stories that leave the organised crime in Mexico and penet@@ rate them into the soul of the country .
&quot; only a few stories are still alive in the face of new head@@ lines . however , this project reminds us of those we must not forget . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the project &quot; &quot; ap@@ render a Vi@@ vir Con El Nar@@ co &quot; &quot; Animal Pol@@ í@@ tico launched the data journ@@ alism project Nar@@ co@@ data , whose goal is to portra@@ y the complex information behind the failed fight against drug traff@@ icking , which has tor@@ mented the country in the last four decades , in an understandable way . &quot;
when a picture is worth a thousand words
&quot; sharing is Car@@ ing , by Fli@@ ck@@ r User Ni@@ kl@@ as Wik@@ ström ( CC @-@ BY @-@ NC 2.0 ) WAR@@ N@@ ING : this post and the pages to which he links , contain pictures where violence is represented . &quot;
the fact check is important at a moment when it comes to raising a rum@@ or or expos@@ ing a fal@@ si@@ fication .
&quot; but how is the years after something happened the first time ? content in social media , whether true or un@@ true , tends to pers@@ ist . &quot;
let us take this picture of a terrible accident seven years ago in the Democratic Republic of Congo ( DR Congo ) .
&quot; since its first publication , it has been mis@@ leading to depic@@ t trage@@ dies that have actually occurred in Nigeria or Myanmar . &quot;
&quot; this false coupling of picture and event - &quot; false description &quot; or &quot; wrong context &quot; in the termin@@ ology of Global Vo@@ ices or First Dra@@ ft News - does not deny the fact that there are plenty of me@@ tic@@ ulous reporting of events in DR Congo , Myanmar and Nigeria . &quot;
but it raises questions about our desire for pictures to messages .
what happened in the Democratic Republic of Congo
&quot; in 2010 , a tank car crossed the village of S@@ ange in the east of the DR Congo , ti@@ pped around and explo@@ ded . 230 people came to life . &quot;
&quot; after the civil war , Africa &apos;s second largest country had been neglected for years and devast@@ ated it . the roads in the region have become dangerous paths full of pot@@ holes that were difficult to drive . &quot;
&quot; trag@@ ically , the tank car fell to the victim . &quot;
&quot; sales representatives described a fire@@ ball , the dozens of homes envel@@ op@@ ed including a cinema nearby which was full of people who watched the World Cup . &quot;
houses of contaminated and char@@ coal bodies were scattered in the streets .
many people were burned to ignorance .
&quot; a picture with the title &quot; Das ist Nigeria . &quot; by Im@@ g@@ ur @-@ Users My@@ sti@@ cal Mon@@ key , 12 January 201@@ 5.@@ Sever@@ al photos of the incident form the horri@@ ble scenes of this day . &quot;
above is an example of this .
it shows rows of char@@ red bodies that are ag@@ it@@ ated on the ground while individuals look at them .
but here the story does not end .
&quot; over the years the same photo was fal@@ si@@ fied several times on social media , blogs and other platforms and wron@@ g@@ ly attributed to real but not related trage@@ dies , especially events in Nigeria and Myanmar . &quot;
what did not happen in Nigeria and Myanmar
on 3 January 2015 fighters of Bo@@ ko Har@@ am attacked the remote Nig@@ eri@@ an villages of Bag@@ a and Dor@@ o G@@ ow@@ on .
&quot; eye @-@ witnesses reported dr@@ astic of atro@@ cities , before they had to flee . &quot;
houses and shops were burned down and dead bodies were in streets and bushes .
&quot; reports , according to which 150 to 2,000 people were massac@@ red . &quot;
&quot; but the numbers could not be confirmed . &quot; &quot; no one stayed behind to count the bodies , &quot; &quot; said a resident to Human Rights Watch . &quot;
&quot; many were crushed , shot or burned . &quot;
&quot; only on the basis of satellite images , the follow @-@ up period could be illustrated . &quot;
&quot; the reason for the attack was also uncertain , but the army base in Bag@@ a was a permanent conflict between the military Nig@@ eri@@ as and the attempt of Bo@@ ko Har@@ am to win the country ( examples from 2013 and 2015 ) . &quot;
and here the picture from the DR Congo appeared again when it was mistakenly presented as evidence of the fact and the possible extent of the attack :
this is Nigeria .
a massacre of 2,000 people took place two days after Paris . &quot;
they are not Charlie .
they are dead .
&quot; in fact , this impro@@ per use of the image from the DR Congo is only one in a number of abor@@ tions ; Africa Check has documented orders to Nigeria since 2014 . &quot;
in all these cases the picture was presented as a proof for mass kill@@ ings .
&quot; another step further brings personal comments , such as the picture from the DR Congo with sources of the mass media in connection to provide arguments . &quot;
the image from S@@ ange also appeared in connection with the deadly persecution of the Muslim Roh@@ ing@@ ya in Myanmar .
&quot; according to a flash message , published by the United Nations described those who were able to escape strikes , rape and several deaths , some by burning . &quot;
&quot; while others reported about the violence against Roh@@ ing@@ ya , posts like the following , which brought these descriptions together with photos from the DR Congo : &quot;
&quot; this image origin@@ ates from an Saudi Arabian news page , which mistakenly tended to be the President of Myanmar &apos;s Th@@ ein , monks and politicians would have participated in the assass@@ ination of Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . in addition , it had used the image from the DR Congo to obtain this information . &quot;
&quot; the original contribution , which was accessed most recently on 26 April 2017 , can be accessed here . &quot;
&quot; other news organisations that called AF@@ P as their source , had also mistakenly attributed this statement to Th@@ ein , but had not linked the image from the DR Congo . &quot;
the worldwide range of false information
traces of these false dec@@ ou@@ pling are back to the years 2011 and 2012 and actually come from all over the world .
&quot; using an &quot; reverse image search , &quot; you can see how far information can exceed limits . &quot;
a revers@@ ed picture search with the search engine Tin@@ Eye has found 344 pictures under 18.@@ 8 billion pictures ( as of 3 May 2017 ) 344 images that are very similar to the said image from the DR Congo .
&quot; they come from a mixed mas@@ ch of private pages , platforms social media and community as well as national publications and are available in many different languages such as English , Russian , Spanish , Arabic , Dutch , German , Greek and Portuguese . &quot;
&quot; some have for@@ warded false reports , some have tried to expose the for@@ geri@@ es . &quot;
&quot; we have bor@@ dered examples of impro@@ per use and linked them to the respective countries , based on which side they have been published . thus , we want to show the range more clearly than through the language alone . &quot;
from the countries listed below ( which in some cases have also been linked ) several examples may be used for impro@@ per use .
here are some cases which can now be fully re@@ opened ( on the map in Orange ) :

&quot; as a reminder , the source of the image is the Democratic Republic of Congo ( in blue ) . &quot;

&quot; as the picture later came into circulation in the context of the Bo@@ ko Har@@ am massacre of 2015 , the newspaper El Pa@@ is tried to refu@@ te that there were connections to Nigeria . &quot;
&quot; Turkey , 2015 . &quot; # Ni@@ jer@@ y@@ a@@ Yan@@ ı@@ y@@ or@@ Dün@@ y@@ a@@ U@@ yu@@ y &quot; ( Nigeria burns , the world sleeps ) . &quot;
&quot; the image of the DR Congo appeared , provided with this T@@ witter@@ h@@ ash@@ tag , and triggered a discussion among Muslims after the Bo@@ ko Har@@ am massacre of 2015 and the attack on Charlie Heb@@ do in Paris . &quot;
&quot; they wanted to achieve a greater attention to these events , presum@@ ably in the name of Islam . &quot;
&quot; United States , 2015 . &quot;
&quot; the picture was swe@@ at@@ ched for the Bo@@ ko Har@@ am massacre in 2015 ( and saved more than 9.@@ 300 times ) , but the messages that were associated with it were not taken up in any religious context . &quot;
&quot; instead , the aim was to attract attention to the relative number of deaths and a comparison of media reporting in comparison to Nigeria and the attack against Charlie Heb@@ do . &quot;
&quot; Vietnam@@ ese , 2014 . &quot;
&quot; after a message which was suppos@@ edly written by a &quot; father Juan Carlos Mar@@ tos &quot; about the Nig@@ eri@@ an massacre , there were discussion forums like this here on Vietnam@@ ese and declared it to be false . &quot;
&quot; from the emb@@ assy in which the image from the DR Congo was included , the Organisation of the Clar@@ ines mission@@ aries and Fr . Juan Carlos Mar@@ tos dis@@ soci@@ ated themselves . &quot;
&quot; there are further confirmed examples of a faul@@ ty use of the image from Sweden , Poland , Belgium , the Netherlands and Argentina . &quot;
&quot; Tin@@ Eye also points out other accounts , aggreg@@ ators and pages in the following countries ( on the portfolio in grey ) , but are no longer fully tra@@ ce@@ able : Czech Republic , Australia , India , Peru , Netherlands , Ethiopia , Sri Lanka , Azerbaijan , Japan and possibly China . &quot;
( data entries with URLs and time / date stamps exist on the Web@@ craw@@ ler and occasionally they have picture file names in connection with Nigeria or Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . )
&quot; in all these cases , which appeared only clearly after the original press release of 2010 , the picture finally may have a correct description , but the original contribution is not available or accessible . &quot;
frames and pictures
&quot; there are two strong subjects or frames , which go through these posts . the first frame focuses on religion . &quot;
the photo was used in relation to greater discussions about silence in connection with the assass@@ ination of Christians through Muslims or - for the defense of Muslims - the assass@@ ination of Roh@@ ing@@ ya through Budd@@ hi@@ sts .
a second fr@@ aming uses the image to discuss how an African life is under@@ rated in comparison to a European or French life .
&quot; to understand religion and the value of human life is both important . therefore , it is worth investigating how images are used in connection with these efforts . &quot;
&quot; however , a deeper question is what happens when readers can no longer believe these images . &quot;
&quot; with social media , there are a lot of people who un@@ inten@@ tionally share the water around a tragedy . &quot;
&quot; suggests this mood of mis@@ - and false information that actual atro@@ cities are un@@ true and nar@@ rows it to the actual horror of what is actually happening in the DR Congo , Nigeria and Myanmar ? &quot;
the spread of violent images has already been extensively deb@@ ated ( for example ) .
&quot; one argument is that with@@ holding images of a refusal to recognize the tragedy , sometimes these images are even demanded by the victims themselves . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , the worry that violent images readers and viewers are des@@ en@@ si@@ tiz@@ ing and taking the ability to feel emp@@ athy ( such as this study , which examined how violent media work to help others ) . &quot;
&quot; while there is a lot to discuss about violent portra@@ y@@ als in the news media , it is a fact that they are indispensable for today &apos;s news reporting . &quot;
&quot; techn@@ ologists experim@@ enting with algorithms to support the fight against &quot; fake News . &quot; they will have to think thoroughly about the situation in which an image suggests something , which can actually be used by context or completely ab@@ u@@ sive species . &quot;
&quot; however , any investigation of false subsidies should also take into account how international it can be . &quot;

the &quot; Un@@ translat@@ able &quot; Blog reveals the uniqu@@ eness of smaller languages
photo by Andy S@@ imm@@ ons uses CC BY @-@ ND 2.0 license .
&quot; a blog with the name Un@@ translat@@ able ( i.e. irre@@ plac@@ eable ) stri@@ ves to offer language enthusiasts a selection of words from around the world , which are difficult or not to translate at all . &quot;
&quot; such words exist in each language : they express certain situations or feelings , which are often very complex or specific . &quot;
some of these irre@@ plac@@ eable words are already well @-@ known today ( like the famous Portuguese sau@@ da@@ de ) and others who are deeply rooted in a special culture ( for example the Spanish so@@ bre@@ mes@@ a ) .
but everyone resist@@ ed stub@@ bor@@ n@@ ly every attempt of a simple translation .
&quot; a word or expression does not suff@@ ice , which is why a full explanation and sometimes some context are required to understand exactly what is meant by this one word . &quot;
these unique words have been collected for an entire period of time in an online list .
&quot; most of these lists deal with Japanese , German , French , Portuguese or Finnish words while the author and lingu@@ ist of &quot; Un@@ translat@@ able &quot; Steven Bird decided to focus on small languages . &quot;
&quot; for example , in the blog you can find words from the Mw@@ ot@@ lap language of Van@@ u@@ atu , such as : &quot;
&quot; v@@ ak@@ ast@@ eg@@ lo@@ k &quot; - Mus@@ cle you around your parents in recognition of how , in your younger years , have stri@@ ved . &quot;
&quot; and words in the H@@ uns@@ rik language spoken in parts of Brazil , such as : &quot;
k@@ w@@ adi &quot; - the comfort or la@@ zin@@ ess that one feels after having heated up in the sun on cold days .
in Birds own words from his blog about :
&quot; they def@@ use other cultures , reveal other thoughts and aw@@ aken our curiosity . &quot;
&quot; sometimes you influence how we analyze the world around us and classi@@ fy the lingu@@ ists on this page want to publish more of these &quot; un@@ translat@@ able &quot; words and show how different , valuable and impressive these little languages are . &quot;
&quot; speakers of the &quot; Treas@@ ure Langu@@ ages , &quot; which are appreciated by Un@@ translat@@ able , are invited to upload their favorite words here . &quot;

how Sri Lanka is dealing with the worst floo@@ ds of the decade
the island state of Sri Lanka is currently facing the worst flood and earthquake disaster in this decade .
&quot; caused by strong ra@@ inf@@ all the rivers Kal@@ u , Kel@@ ani , G@@ in , Nil@@ wal@@ a and At@@ tan@@ ag@@ al@@ u O@@ ya entered the shore in 15 districts in the south and west of the country . &quot;
&quot; according to a statement by the Sri Lanka &apos;s disaster centre of 28 May 2017 , 126 people were killed and barely hundred people are being missed because of the floo@@ ds and slu@@ dge win@@ ches . &quot;
&quot; more than 400@@ ,000 people have been affected since last Friday ( May 26 ) and approximately 100,000 people were brought to 304 safe places . &quot;
&quot; the ra@@ inf@@ alls were released on Saturday ( May 27 ) , and the water levels in some areas slowly went back . &quot;
the health and hygiene requirements of the population pose a massive challenge in the affected and still in@@ accessible areas .
the following pictures and videos convey an impression of the extent of the flood disaster :
flood in Ta@@ wal@@ ama city with water levels of up to 7.5 meters . Twitter users like A@@ zz@@ am A@@ me@@ en and Sri Lanka twe@@ et deliver regular updates to flood situations .
many use the h@@ ash@@ tag # F@@ loo@@ d@@ SL to monitor the extent of the catastrophe .
&quot; Sri Lanka &apos;s deadly floo@@ ds wor@@ sen the Den@@ gu@@ e@@ fi@@ eb@@ erk@@ rise , warn Save the Children , after further ra@@ inf@@ alls are already on the way . &quot;
&quot; today the Nel@@ u@@ wa Bus stood in the flood , water level up to 6 meters . village of Mor@@ ago@@ da near G@@ alle also floo@@ ded because of the water peg@@ els of Mor@@ og@@ o@@ da El@@ a . &quot;
&quot; the Air Force has provided five aircraft for rescue operations , and another five are made to transport emergency supplies for those who are included in their floo@@ ded villages . &quot;
various organizations and start @-@ ups are also willing to help .
Facebook sites like Help Flo@@ od Vic@@ tims in Sri Lanka and 2017 Dis@@ aster Relief - Information Des@@ k@@ - Sri Lanka provide important information on flood situations and humanitarian assistance .
&quot; if any search and rescue teams need dr@@ ones for their operations , please call 07@@ 7@@ 48@@ 4@@ 46@@ 39 . &quot;
&quot; for all , who want to don@@ ate dry food and essential goods for flood victims - &quot;
we are in the area around Kel@@ eni@@ ya and Him@@ but@@ ana .
please call + 49 77@@ 44@@ 97@@ 29 or 07@@ 77@@ 84@@ 38@@ 41 if you need help in this area .
the Tax@@ ir@@ u@@ f @-@ App Pick@@ Me ( Sri Lanka ) asked people to share their location data with the help of the app so that the Kat@@ ast@@ oph@@ Center is informed .
&quot; last year after the disaster of the tropical storm Ro@@ an@@ u , Pick@@ Me led a &quot; &quot; flood aid &quot; &quot; button that allowed users to call a vehicle for collection of assistance and donations . these were then for@@ warded to the Sri L@@ ank@@ an Red Cross for free . &quot;
&quot; they also led a &quot; SOS &quot; button , which resulted in more than a thousand en@@ quiries and 150 successful boat rescue operations for floo@@ ds and land@@ slides . &quot;
&quot; the united efforts of the government and the civilian population of Sri Lanka , in which several social media platforms are fully exploited , bring residents in need in safety and provide assistance . &quot;
&quot; this has prevented the loss of further lives , whereby the population of Sri Lanka is now the long way to restore norm@@ ality . &quot;

the Women &apos;s March on 21 January 2017 in San Francisco .
Foto by Sah@@ ar Hab@@ i@@ b G@@ haz@@ i .
in January I took part in the Women &apos;s March in San Francisco with a neighbor and love girl@@ friend .
&quot; I trust her my four years old daughter , she tru@@ sts me her children ; she is my rock in the fire . &quot;
&quot; in one minute , we still call slo@@ gans for women &apos;s rights . &quot;
&quot; in the next , we are calling for rights for trans@@ gender . &quot;
&quot; we are in a sea of umbr@@ ellas and people , some keep the icon@@ ic picture of a woman with head@@ scarf high , tied out of an American flag , others are en@@ acting slo@@ gans against anti @-@ Islam hos@@ tility . &quot;
&quot; my girl@@ friend looks at me and says , &quot; &quot; These things do not concern you , or ? &quot; &quot; why , because I am not Muslims ? &quot; &quot; I ask . &quot;
I have already managed this conversation .
&quot; people with whom I have been working or people who have known me for years , separate me - the Sah@@ ar they know - from the widespread concept of &quot; Muslims , &quot; which has built up in their imagination . &quot;
they mi@@ tig@@ ate me .
there are 1.7 billion Muslims worldwide .
we do not see all the same .
we practice our religion differently .
&quot; we identify ourselves to be a Muslim , to different kinds . but somehow we are all put into the same Muslim drawer . &quot;
&quot; this drawer is so well constructed in our collective imagination , that as soon as Muslims , who , as I do not fit , will be mi@@ tig@@ ated . &quot;
to be mus@@ li@@ zed
I don &apos;t stand alone .
that is even the poet who is most selling poetry in America : Rum@@ i .
what pictures do you think about it when you think about it ?
love ?
peace ?
&quot; when Jal@@ al@@ ud@@ din Rum@@ i was as old as I am now , he was an Orthodox Muslim pre@@ acher and schol@@ ar . &quot;
&quot; Islam , the Koran and Prophet Muhammad were up to the day when he died , the centre of his poetry . &quot;
&quot; but in the Western conception , the religion of Rum@@ is was deleted , as well as from the most popular translations of his poetry . &quot;
this del@@ e@@ tion makes a large part of the history of the 1.7 billion Muslims of this world .
another is in the reduc@@ tion@@ ist images of Muslims who have been colon@@ ised by Western books for centuries .
this entic@@ ing picture language is determined by the dark man that one should fear and the exotic woman that should be saved .
the ground@@ breaking Palestinian @-@ American scientist Edward S@@ aid broke down the story behind these images in the 1970s .
but these pictures still stand out today .
&quot; our politicians , the news industry and Hollywood continue to ste@@ al them . &quot;
&quot; I have worked for thir@@ teen years in the news industry and I have seen how these powerful , fla@@ wed nar@@ r@@ atives dominate our news@@ feeds . &quot;
&quot; this Nar@@ r@@ ative over@@ shadows the reality that nine Muslim women have led their countries over the last three decades , while the US won &apos;t even choose their first female presidential candidate . &quot;
&quot; this Nar@@ r@@ ative fails to recognise that if French , Muslim women are prevented from carrying out their head@@ scarf in public buildings and to cover Saudi Arabian , Muslim women through their government to cover all of these two sides of the same coin . &quot;
a powerful group exercises his &quot; control &quot; to the &quot; other . &quot;
&quot; this strong Nar@@ r@@ ative weak@@ ens Muslim women , which lead movements for change . &quot;
&quot; it seems that the first Muslim prayers were spoken on American ground by Afri@@ cans , who had been brought to slave ships . &quot;
it delet@@ es the existence of qu@@ eer Muslims .
&quot; this Nar@@ r@@ ative has so deep and fla@@ wed our collective imagination , that often Si@@ kh men and children are often attacked by anti @-@ Muslim attacks and har@@ ass@@ ings . &quot;
&quot; because of these stories we tell , and because of the way we relate to them , Islam@@ opho@@ bia is today not only fear of Islam , religion , but fear of the &quot; others . &quot; &quot;
to the 1.7 billion people
&quot; in the news industry , we do more than just tell stories based on facts . &quot;
or on alternative facts .
we also create Nar@@ r@@ ative who help us to understand the world .
and my industry has failed to grasp the Nar@@ r@@ ative of 1.7 billion .
&quot; and we have failed , where seven million Muslims constitute the &quot; &quot; diverse &quot; &quot; religious group in America . &quot;
more than a third of the total Muslim population are African Americans .
six out of ten American Muslims belong to the immigrants of the first generation who come from 77 countries .
the parents of the author 1976 in New York .
approved .
four decades ago my immig@@ rated parents came to New York to live their American dream .
&quot; my mother put her first jewelry design on 5th Avenue and my father worked hard in the sky@@ scra@@ pers of New York ; sky@@ scra@@ pers were made possible by the Muslim , American st@@ atics from Bangladesh with the name Faz@@ l@@ ur Rah@@ man Khan . &quot;
&quot; at that time , when Khan was re@@ thinking the sky@@ lines of the world , my parents were uns@@ killed Muslims and Americans . &quot;
but am I now troubled Muslim and American ?
&quot; sometimes , when people ask me why I don &apos;t eat pork , I say - instead of getting out of my Muslim recipes or my hand@@ some hand@@ bag that all Muslims wear with themselves - &quot; out of respect for Pep@@ pa W@@ utz . &quot;
&quot; I am jo@@ king , we don &apos;t carry all the hand@@ bags with us . &quot;
&quot; we do not have to be the@@ ological experts to be &quot; &quot; Muslim &quot; &quot; or to almost always be selected for additional security checks at the airport . &quot;
&quot; there are hundreds of outstanding Muslim scholars , Muslim activists and inter@@ religious activists seeking to fight widely spread lies over Islam . &quot;
&quot; these lies are produced on the current tape of a well @-@ lubri@@ cated Islam@@ opho@@ bic machine with len@@ ders , think tanks and experts for false information , which is our already er@@ ron@@ eous image of what a Muslim is ; or what Islam is , have manipul@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; because of the stories we tell , and because of the nature in which we relate it , Islam hos@@ tility to more than just a foreig@@ ner who h@@ ates the head towel . &quot;
&quot; or as the terri@@ fying map of attacks on mos@@ ques in the whole of the USA , see below . &quot;
screen@@ shot of the AC@@ L@@ U website .
anti @-@ Islam hos@@ tility in its ug@@ ly forms acc@@ uses our belonging .
&quot; it acc@@ uses our identity , which is so vast , so versatile and complex that it cannot fit into a drawer . &quot;
the author 1986 on a photo of her kinder@@ garten group .
approved .
I would like to explain this .
&quot; I was born as a Muslim , but being a Muslim was first born into my imagination , when I was four years old , in a provis@@ ional mos@@ que in the basement of a pres@@ by@@ ter@@ ian church in New York . &quot;
&quot; if social scientists describe religious life , they use the following terms : faith , behavior and affili@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; my Muslim belief and behaviour may not always be visible , but they are there . &quot;
&quot; perhaps my girl@@ friend , my neighbour , would see my rock in the surf that I am Muslim , if they could look through the 15 metres of concrete and air that separate our houses . &quot;
&quot; she would see the evening ritual with my daughter , when I kept her in my arms and whis@@ per her to the Arabic verses to protect the Koran and called the Q@@ ul@@ s . &quot;
every one of them I repeat three times .
&quot; I ask that it is protected from evil , the evil one can see and the evil one cannot see . &quot;
&quot; my Muslim belief is not always visible , but my Muslim affili@@ ation is always part of my shadow . &quot;
&quot; the grand@@ mother of the author , when she wins an Ik@@ eb@@ ana competition in Kar@@ achi , with her sisters at some point in the 1960s . &quot;
approved .
belonging is the picture of my grand@@ mother mat@@ ernal side with her sisters ; how to win a competition of the art of the arran@@ ger in Kar@@ achi 3 decades ago .
&quot; it is the image of her that I see at this moment when I close my eyes : Nano , surrounded by her completed and un@@ finished paintings painted Su@@ fi saint ; and a Qur &apos;an with many book@@ marks , a book with one hundred and four@@ teen chapters , which can almost be mem@@ orized . &quot;
being Muslims means to speak the prayers they told me when I have a bad day .
&quot; to be Muslim is how she taught me to refer to God : Allah Mi@@ an , what God means , my only Lord . &quot;
&quot; for a people that - over the centuries - was colon@@ ized by an &quot; Empire , &quot; which a company founded with the name Hon@@ orable British Ost@@ in@@ die Kom@@ pan@@ ie , it has a deep meaning to call God my only Lord . &quot;
the author 1987 with her grandfather .
approved .
&quot; belonging to it means to grow up and hear that men do not cry , but at the same time seeing that my immig@@ rated grandfather we@@ eps . &quot;
&quot; in between , while he writes books about modern Islam and the independence of K@@ ash@@ mir@@ s , N@@ ana Ja@@ an we@@ pt bit@@ terly about his family in India ruled K@@ ash@@ mir , family that he could not close in his arms in half a century . &quot;
&quot; affili@@ ation is to know that there are millions of Kur@@ ds and Palestinians whose families , as with my grandfather , have been torn apart by col@@ oni@@ alists who have shared the Muslim world as at risk . &quot;
&quot; to be Muslim means knowing that over the last two centuries , Europeans have col@@ oni@@ alized all to four Muslim countries . &quot;
it means knowing that the first aerial bom@@ be of history was rejected over a century ago over a Muslim country .
&quot; it means knowing that at the same time the grandfather of my grand@@ mother , an Indian , k@@ asch@@ mir subject of the British empire , was described as &quot; dangerous &quot; by the newspapers of his time as he led the first mos@@ que in England . &quot;
&quot; even before there were planes , he travelled to more parts of the world than I was ever , preaching the radical word of love , peace and social justice . &quot;
the word of Islam .

to my Muslim tribe of 1.7 billion things go deep into our unforgettable family trees ; our irre@@ conc@@ il@@ able history .
&quot; it means remember@@ ing that four@@ teen years ago , the most powerful military in the world , with troops distributed over every continent aside from the Ant@@ arc@@ tic , have gone to Iraq to pursue mass destruction weapons that did not exist . &quot;
it means knowing that more than half million Ira@@ q@@ is buried beneath the ruins of war .
to be an American Muslim means knowing that the suicide rate among veter@@ ans has increased by more than 32 per cent since 2001 .
&quot; it means knowing that if a tragedy holds the US and the susp@@ ect carries a Muslim name , the story is reported four times more than a story with a white assass@@ in . &quot;
&quot; it means knowing that four@@ teen hundred years ago the first prayer call , the Az@@ an , was called Bil@@ al by a liber@@ ated black slave . &quot;
it means knowing that two hundred years ago an African Islamic schol@@ ar named Bil@@ ali Muhammad was ens@@ la@@ ved and brought into this country .
it means calling Mal@@ col@@ m X to call an American hero .
it is the warmth that I feel when people crowded the airports to fight against Muslim Ban .
it is the hope that I feel when we stand up for our dreams and when we say black life count .
&quot; being an American woman , a Pak@@ ist@@ ani , a K@@ ash@@ mir@@ i , a Pun@@ j@@ abi , a Muslim and a journalist , means the inherent inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality of our identi@@ ties with multiple hy@@ ph@@ ens , but to fail to communicate it to others . &quot;
&quot; the Nar@@ r@@ ative of the 1.7 billion holds more possibilities than a cube cube , but it is represented in the reduced doubt &quot; we &quot; against &quot; it . &quot; &quot;
&quot; being a mother means to care for my child and all Muslim children , knowing that powerful and privileged individuals establish structural Islam@@ opho@@ bia . &quot;
structural Islam@@ opho@@ bia exists in Muslim registr@@ ations that began with President Bush and extended to President Obama .
it consists of continuous monitoring of mos@@ ques .
she is in the immigration officer who takes a five year old child in hand@@ cu@@ ffs .
it is in a country that exclu@@ des its borders from people from just countries that are bombar@@ ded .
&quot; it is a false and ne@@ bul@@ ous &quot; no @-@ fly @-@ list , &quot; which largely assumes Arabs and Muslims . &quot;
&quot; it is the wars that we lead , and the bombs that we reject in Muslim countries . &quot;
&quot; because of the stories we tell , and because of those we don &apos;t tell , we are here today . &quot;
&quot; in a study entitled A@@ scent of Man , scientists from North@@ western University showed a scienti@@ fically correct image and asked them to evaluate groups on a scale from 1 to 100 regarding evolution . &quot;
Muslims got the lowest score .
the conversations that we have to lead
we are too deep to enth@@ use the Muslim or the &quot; others . &quot;
&quot; we are back for decades to recognize the roots of our fears , and the fla@@ wed and dangerous image prints that we have in our news editorial offices . &quot;
&quot; at least there is a growing movement , led by American Muslims within the media industry , which tries to capture our many multip@@ lied identi@@ ties and forgotten history . &quot;
&quot; the pod@@ cast See Som@@ e@@ thing , S@@ ay Som@@ e@@ thing of Bu@@ zz@@ feed ; the pod@@ cast # Good@@ Mus@@ lim@@ Bad@@ Muslim ; Sap@@ elo Square about black , American Muslims ; Simon &amp; amp ; Schu@@ sters Sal@@ am Re@@ ads , an initiative to increase Muslim writers and Ms Mar@@ vel , the PA@@ KI@@ ST@@ AN@@ ISH , Muslim , American super@@ hero@@ ine - all this makes me hope . &quot;
screen@@ shots of media initiatives that want to show the complexity and inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality of Muslim American life .
col@@ lage of the author .
but I am concerned about this difficult global timing in which we are .
this moment has consequences that go beyond the 1.7 billion .
&quot; there is one reason that conspiracy the@@ orists , who existed in the dark corners of the Internet , now lead the White House . &quot;
they have grown expon@@ enti@@ ally because they have made Muslims to &quot; others . &quot;
there is another group that has grown expon@@ enti@@ ally by creating the &quot; other . &quot;
&quot; a few years earlier , it had not yet been given ; now they dominate big areas in Syria and Iraq . &quot;
&quot; I am concerned about the realities and the history that I was not aware of when I was so old , as it is now my daughter , but who today made me an innocent Muslim . &quot;
things I left here like a bread@@ cr@@ umb track in my speech .
&quot; things that may aw@@ aken memories , because in all the inter@@ sections that our humanity is doing , a history may l@@ ur@@ ish where someone is being made to another . &quot;
&quot; right now , on the other side of the bridge in Ber@@ keley , Con@@ vers@@ ations in the 8th Annual Conference of Islam@@ opho@@ bia have been held . &quot;
&quot; more than a hundred acade@@ mics talk about our problems with the &quot; other , &quot; &quot; structural rac@@ ism &quot; and &quot; American militar@@ ism . &quot; &quot;
but these are no terms with which we usually throw in our schools around us or which we read in our newspapers .

we all have to ask ourselves why ?
&quot; why do I tell this here at this TE@@ D@@ x Talk 2017 in Stan@@ ford , where Edward S@@ aid , the man who showed us how wars will be led and people through the creation of the &quot; other &quot; in the public imagination , was even scientific of Stan@@ ford . &quot;
&quot; we have to ask ourselves uncomfortable questions about the role of being conscious and un@@ conscious of the &quot; other , &quot; as it is my girl@@ friend and I in the rain during the Women &apos;s March , because the occupation that we have no president , while he already bombar@@ ded lands and &quot; other &quot; made &quot; people , goes far beyond the visible and invisible 1.7 billion . &quot;
it starts here with all of us .
initiative for narrative art wants to preserve urban variety of languages
&quot; story telling , by Fli@@ ck@@ r @-@ User Daniel@@ e Rossi , using the license CC BY @-@ NC @-@ ND 2.0 . &quot;
can there be a possibility to contact someone here and now in spite of a language barrier ?
&quot; for Steven Bird and Rob@@ yn Perry , founder of the Treas@@ ure Language Stor@@ y@@ telling initiative ( T@@ LS ) , telling stories in their original language is a possible answer to it . &quot;
&quot; global Vo@@ ices reported recently about another initiative of Steven Bird , the un@@ translat@@ able blog . &quot;
&quot; however , the focus of T@@ LS is not on the written , but on the spoken word . it is an attempt to preserve and appreciate the language diversity of large cities . &quot;
&quot; in fact , in urban areas such as Melbourne and Darwin in Australia or in O@@ ak@@ land in the United States , where T@@ LS has already held events since 2015 , the risk that small and not very small languages will not be passed on to the children born there . &quot;
for the makers of the project apply :
&quot; the mass ext@@ inction of the languages of the world can be avoided if we create cities , accept diversity - safe spaces where residents don &apos;t have to forget who they are to belong . &quot;
&quot; while listening often is associated with understanding , &quot; &quot; these events instead &quot; &quot; take the listen@@ er to appreciate , to feel , to make sense . &quot;
&quot; in this format , stor@@ yt@@ ellers will first translate their history into their own language and then explain them in English . &quot;
&quot; even if the participants are not a professional story t@@ eller , their dedication and representation will result in the audience . &quot;
they call forth laughter and emotions as if the language is no longer a barrier .

Puerto Rico calls for the United States to re @-@ establish state debt
&quot; on April 3 , 2017 , with the aim of a re @-@ check of the public debt of Puerto Rico , several religious and civil organisations participated in a mass demonstration on April 3 , 2017 . the march started at the pu@@ ert@@ ory Capit@@ ol , the government building of the capital , and went up to the Plaza de Col@@ ón in the old town of San Ju@@ an . &quot;
she was proclaimed by the group@@ ing &quot; Fren@@ te Ci@@ u@@ dad@@ ano p@@ or la Audi@@ tor@@ ía de la Deu@@ da &quot; ( Ci@@ tiz@@ ens front for the re @-@ examination of the debts ) and the com@@ edy church meeting Puerto Rico .
the advoc@@ ates of the re @-@ fixing of debt have also submitted a petition on the official website of the White House of the United States .
this is their demand :
&quot; the people of Puerto Rico demand that politicians , bank@@ ers and government agencies responsible for debts are held accoun@@ table for their corruption . &quot;
&quot; we call for a financial review and a Ste@@ ering Committee without personal interests in public debt , with a firm , our working conditions appropriate remun@@ eration , which acts in favour of the economy . &quot;
we are crushed and supp@@ ressed .
&quot; the people of Puerto Rico refuse to pay a debt , which is not thei@@ rs . &quot;
we will not choose between education and health .
our pen@@ sion@@ ers will not be able to find themselves with dec@@ lining pension payments .
we demand immediate action .
the island - not the sovereign territory of the United States - suff@@ ers from a serious financial crisis .
&quot; hence , the so @-@ called &quot; Centre for New Economy , &quot; a non @-@ profit organization without party affili@@ ation with focus on socio @-@ economic development , proposes a law on state responsibility , as an alternative to existing state supervision . &quot;
these are their reasons :
the economic and financial crisis of Puerto Rico requires a wide restructuring of the state infrastructure .
&quot; without the participation and conviction of the citizens , measures imposed from the outside will be je@@ op@@ ardi@@ zed by the people . &quot;
the demonstration carried the name &quot; night watch for light and truth . &quot;
here are some impressions :

&quot; the Syrian @-@ Palestinian web developer Bass@@ el Kh@@ art@@ ab@@ il , also known as Bass@@ el Saf@@ adi , has been missing for over a year . &quot;
but he is not forgotten .
&quot; more than five years after he was arrested by the Syrian regime , his supporters and relatives continue the campaign for his freedom and recall the contributions he made for an open network . &quot;
&quot; at this year &apos;s re : Pub@@ lica , the annual conference for digital culture , which is hosted in Berlin , devoted an event to the # Free@@ Bass@@ el campaign . &quot;
&quot; Mé@@ lan@@ ie D@@ ul@@ ong de Ros@@ n@@ ay , a scientist of the CN@@ RS Institute for Communication Sciences , and Barbara R@@ üh@@ ling , Managing Director at Book Spr@@ ints , a publisher of the book Cost of Freedom : a Collec@@ tive In@@ quiry ( The Cost of Freedom : a Collec@@ tive Research ) . &quot;
&quot; the book , which was published last year and is available here roy@@ alty @-@ free , contains a number of essays that deal with the free culture in the face of oppression . &quot;
it is a hom@@ age to Bass@@ el and his work .
in the introduction it means :
&quot; this book wants to discuss how movements are built for free knowledge , and what the real costs are , with which this is connected . &quot;
&quot; activists , artists , designers , developers , researchers and authors who are involved in the movements for free knowledge have worked on side to look over the fog that surro@@ unds our news feeds and to make some sense from our different experiences . &quot;
&quot; this book is an attempt to free Bass@@ el Kh@@ art@@ ab@@ il , the beloved and celebrated internet @-@ volunteer , who has been det@@ ained in Syria since March 15 , 2012 . &quot;
his name was removed from the directory of the A@@ dra prison in which he sat on 3 October 2015 .
&quot; since then , we have no information about its current state or location . &quot;
&quot; the introduc@@ tory part of his book entitled Collec@@ tive Rem@@ em@@ bran@@ ce gives his friends and his family a voice that insi@@ sts on his release and who want to know him back in his normal life and freedom , instantly . &quot;
&quot; seeing how Bass@@ el pays a high price for its participation in a free culture , many of us have begun to think about their own dest@@ in@@ ies , deeds and decisions . &quot;
why are we here today ?
what did we choose ?
what have we given up in this process of time @-@ wise extreme beliefs ?
the web developer for Open Source and Digital Activ@@ ist has been in custo@@ dy of Syrian government agencies since March 2012 .
&quot; in October 2015 , Bass@@ el was transferred from the A@@ dra prison , a non @-@ military institution to an unknown place . &quot;
&quot; his wife , the writer and lawyer N@@ our@@ a G@@ haz@@ i , reported that the &quot; Military Police &quot; Bass@@ el had taken from his cell in A@@ dra on the basis of a &quot; &quot; strictly secret &quot; &quot; command of the military tri@@ bunal . &quot;
&quot; G@@ haz@@ i reported that she was contacted by persons on 12 November 2015 , who presented himself as insi@@ der of Assad &apos;s government and informed them of an alleged death sentence against her husband . &quot;
&quot; however , its place of residence and condition remain unknown . &quot;
&quot; a pioneer of the creative Comm@@ ons in Syria and actively involved in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia , Bass@@ el played a crucial role in expanding access to the Internet and knowledge for the public in Syria . &quot;
&quot; Barry Thre@@ w , a designer , techn@@ ologist and currently the director of New Pal@@ my@@ ra , a project that founded Bass@@ el , writes on pages 10 and 11 of the book : &quot;
&quot; perhaps none of Bas@@ sels cultural prot@@ otypes were predic@@ table than the work , which he began with a group of archae@@ ologists and 3D artists around 2005 to virtually re@@ construct the ancient ruins of Pal@@ my@@ ras . &quot;
&quot; Pal@@ my@@ ra , one of the most important archaeological sites in the world , was the cross of numerous civi@@ liz@@ ations and here , Greek @-@ Roman architecture of architecture with local traditions and Persian influences . &quot;
&quot; at that time , Bass@@ el could not know that ten years after he began with this work , the IS would make everything possible to wi@@ pe out this architecture , which em@@ bodies not only the cultural heritage of Sy@@ s@@ ri@@ ens but the world . &quot;
this strip into the digital archae@@ ology and conservation has created a time capsule that will be in@@ valuable to the public as well as for scientists and artists in the future .
&quot; trag@@ ically , Bass@@ el could not yet complete this project . &quot;
N@@ our@@ a G@@ haz@@ i also contributed to the book and writes about the passion of her husband to share his knowledge with others even during his time in prison :
&quot; I spent my entire life , dre@@ aming of freedom , and Bass@@ el taught me to embrace it . &quot;
I am overwhel@@ med when I call his name .
&quot; Bass@@ el gave me English , even when he was in prison . &quot;
&quot; I learned to read , write and speak English well . &quot;
&quot; he always shared his knowledge with anyone who asked . he taught other prisoners to read , write and speak English . &quot;
Bass@@ el opened my door to technology . he taught me to use both computers and smartphones .
he brought me the internet .
&quot; he also taught other prisoners as they use computers , at least theore@@ tically , without actually holding one in their hands . &quot;
&quot; G@@ haz@@ i is also the author of Wa@@ iting ( waiting ) , a book that she wrote in the years 2012 to 2015 her husband when he was in custo@@ dy . &quot;
Bass@@ el and N@@ our@@ a worked together in the book for a year .
she smu@@ g@@ gl@@ ed the lyrics to him when she visited him and he translated it from Arabic to English .
the book is available roy@@ alty free .

here is an excerpt from the book of Nor@@ a entitled &quot; It is happening . &quot;
&quot; it happens at every visit , &quot;
&quot; that I sink in the world of your enchanting eyes , &quot;
&quot; that I lose the mind in the moment we embrace , &quot;
that I don &apos;t care about any of the dangers .
&quot; each of the f@@ ences , sh@@ ac@@ kles and guar@@ di@@ ans &quot;
I forget the prison of the prison

&quot; I wear my passion with me , &quot;

&quot; I quickly return to my lon@@ el@@ iness , &quot;
&quot; to bring back all the moments , &quot;

I testify myself that I will return soon ...

Bas@@ sels History is not unique in Syria .
&quot; since the beginning of the 2011 protests against Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad &apos;s regime , more than 6@@ 5,000 people have disappeared according to the Syrian Network for Human Rights ( Syrian Network for Human Rights ) . &quot;
those who were arrested or disappeared under the regime were tor@@ tured or even executed .
&quot; by 2016 , according to the international human rights organisation Am@@ nesty International has died at least 17.@@ 7@@ 23 Syri@@ ans in custo@@ dy since 2011 . &quot;
the stories of many other people remain unknown .
the Global Vo@@ ices Community has been calling for the release of b@@ ass@@ el since 2012 .
&quot; today , we reiter@@ ate our demand in the hope that we have to do for the last time . &quot;
Moz@@ ambique : conscientious obj@@ ection of corruption condemned by corruption on previous post
&quot; Moz@@ ambique re@@ acted with anger at a corruption attack , where a member of the government returned to the workplace in the state apparatus after half of his sentence . &quot;
&quot; this is Di@@ od@@ ino Cam@@ b@@ aza , who was arrested in 2008 and was sentenced to 22 years in prison with four other def@@ endants , due to de@@ priv@@ ation of 54 million Me@@ tik@@ al ( around 800 000 euros ) . &quot;
&quot; the money came from public funds from the airports of Moz@@ ambique , whose advice was Cam@@ b@@ aza between 2005 and 2008 . &quot;
Cam@@ b@@ aza was released in 2016 because of good leadership and immediately called for his re @-@ adjustment to the company what happened on the 19th of April .
&quot; in accordance with a statement issued by the General Prosec@@ utor of the Republic who submitted the application , there would be no obstacle for Cam@@ b@@ aza to return to its old post since the firm did not undertake disciplinary proceedings following his imprisonment . &quot;
&quot; however , many inhabitants are not doing the action well . &quot;
&quot; the Centre for Public Integr@@ ity ( Centro de Int@@ egri@@ da@@ de P@@ ú@@ b@@ lica , short C@@ IP ) , a local institution committed to public transparency , in an interview with Deutsche Welle den@@ ounced the decision of the company to set up the director : &quot;
&quot; represents a set@@ back in the fight against corruption and illustrates the lack of transparency and is even a step in terms of the efforts of our legal system , such as the C@@ IP . &quot;
what we are aware of is that the company should also have a disciplinary procedure against the rel@@ u@@ ct@@ ant .
&quot; the company , however , seems to be and causes no reasonable legal steps to apply the corresponding functions . &quot;
&quot; Eg@@ í@@ dio V@@ az , a significant voice in the Muslim social media , also re@@ jects this behavior and considers the case as &quot; &quot; disgu@@ sting &quot; &quot; : &quot;
&quot; if Cam@@ b@@ aza would be a competent guy , he would be advis@@ er after he was sentenced to a prison sentence , and half of which has been cut off . &quot;
&quot; he could keep paid lectures and motiv@@ ating speeches , he could advise and polish his image . &quot;
&quot; but since he is in@@ competent , he has agreed to be re@@ integrated into the company that he helped to inf@@ lict damage . &quot;
consequently it is obvious : Cam@@ b@@ aza is often paid for his silence .
* * * * * * * * * * * *
&quot; Bit@@ one Vi@@ age , young Moz@@ ambique and student of political science in Brazil said , the director does not occupy any mor@@ als : &quot;
&quot; Cam@@ b@@ aza rewards the state because he insul@@ ted him , I cannot believe that one rewards someone in such a way that has already massi@@ vely insul@@ ted the state . &quot;
&quot; Cam@@ b@@ aza l@@ acks mor@@ als to return and serve the state * he had already had a unique opportunity to serve the state , but instead only served by the state itself . &quot;
Cam@@ b@@ aza used the state as a hand@@ held it was an in@@ exhaus@@ tible source of money and the state itself has become tired of this man who was charged and finally sentenced to a long sentence .
&quot; hon@@ estly , I don &apos;t know why this man was so re@@ warding . &quot;
&quot; Fran@@ c@@ ey Ze@@ ú@@ te pre@@ fers to remember the Prime Minister of Moz@@ ambique , Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el , to remind that a th@@ ief is in prison : &quot;
&quot; thi@@ eves belong to Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el prison will not only be remembered for ever as the first independent president , but also as a sharp , sn@@ apping and - by the way , proph@@ etic speakers . &quot;
&quot; one of his most famous oral represent@@ ations was when he vigor@@ ously confirmed that &quot; an ambitious man is capable of all , even the fa@@ ther@@ land for his ambi@@ tions , his own individual interest . &quot;
&quot; Sam@@ ora also said , &quot; I don &apos;t know if an ambitious person changes , my experience shows that he is not so . he changes tactics , but he does not turn away from his ambi@@ tions . &quot;
an ambitious human being is at the same time crimin@@ ally . &quot;
&quot; in Twitter , the reactions were also rejected : &quot;
Cam@@ b@@ aza was sentenced to 22 years in prison ; he sat down 10 years and came free .
&quot; and today the company , with which he comp@@ utes mon@@ ies , is back under contract . # Assi@@ m@@ V@@ ai@@ kun@@ eu@@ Pa@@ is - UNI α@@ γ@@ ι@@ ο@@ λ@@ ι@@ κ@@ τ@@ ο ( @ az@@ mal _ Raf@@ ik ) 12 May 2017 &quot;

Facebook blocks the rac@@ ist word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; in Myanmar and cens@@ ates many users wron@@ g@@ ly
&quot; the Bur@@ m@@ ese word &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &quot; &quot; means chick@@ pe@@ as or fis@@ hers . &quot;
&quot; photo by San@@ j@@ ay A@@ char@@ ya , Wikipedia Comm@@ ons , Creative Comm@@ ons Attribution @-@ Share A@@ like 3.0 Un@@ p@@ orted &quot;
&quot; according to Facebook users in Myanmar , the well @-@ known social network took their posts from the net because they contained the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; . &quot;
&quot; although the origin of the word is still being discussed , it is usually used to refer to people of East @-@ Indian origin or generally used as an ad@@ j@@ ective &quot; Indian . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Facebook cens@@ ored the word &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; &quot; as part of an initiative to address the widespread problem of hate speech in Burma in the social network . &quot;
&quot; in recent years , the rise of radical nation@@ alist movements has given the word an extremely negative con@@ notation . &quot;
&quot; in particular , it is a word that is mostly used by ultra @-@ nation@@ alists as hate speech against Muslims who represent a minority of the population in Myanmar . &quot;
&quot; but in efforts to combat hate speech in Myanmar , the company has cens@@ ored a lot of meaningful content on its platform . &quot;
&quot; Kal@@ ar &apos;@@ may normally be associated with rac@@ ism , but the word itself does not automatically call up to hate speech . &quot;
context is important &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; many people have reported that even posts in which they discussed the use of the word or have expressed doubts about their use .
&quot; moreover , there are several bur@@ mes@@ an words with basic mean@@ ings , which have the same letter as &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; . &quot;
&quot; for example , chair is written on Bur@@ mes@@ an also &apos; Kal@@ ar h@@ ta@@ ing &apos; , which contains the same letters as well as other words like &apos; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &apos; , &apos; Kal@@ ar O@@ at &apos; ( Kam@@ el ) or &apos; kal@@ ar@@ ka@@ ar &apos; ( curtain ) . &quot;
the Facebook user A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at explained the different mean@@ ings of words with the sound of &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; :
a post of one of my friends was deleted today because he contained the word Kal@@ ar .
&quot; however , he asked his friends in a wit@@ ty way whether they knew how to alle@@ vi@@ ate his back pain by making a word play . &quot;
&quot; the set of ku la - &quot; cure &quot; ( ku ) + the question word ( la ) at Bur@@ mes@@ isch - resem@@ bles the rac@@ ist expression , but the context is completely different . &quot;
there were several responses to the Facebook initiative .
&quot; Z@@ in Win H@@ tet is the opinion that she will reduce hate speech to radical nation@@ alists , but also emphas@@ ised that Facebook needed to be analy@@ tic before it extingu@@ ishes all the posts that were suspected of spreading rac@@ ism . &quot;
Facebook does not delete the word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; manually .
it filters the word automatically .
automati@@ sm will not understand what you write to Fac@@ be@@ ook .
what it should do instead is to analyze the post carefully and control it by checking the adjacent words .
&quot; for example , &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar H@@ t@@ ine &quot; &quot; ( chair ) and &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the good is that these dirty nation@@ alists , who spread hate speech , get a fairly good lesson . &quot;
now it is time to circumc@@ ise their nation@@ alism .
&quot; while the action may send a strong signal to everyone who will spread hate speech , the efficiency of this strategy may not last long . &quot;
&quot; the experiences of social networks in China such as S@@ ina Wei@@ bo and We@@ Chat have proven that the cens@@ or@@ ship of keywords is often a cat and mouse game , whereby the users of social networks simply start using a new word or alternative writing of cens@@ ored word to express their views . &quot;
&quot; the author A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at described how Facebook began to delete his posts , when he only wanted to tell his friends that the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; was banned from the social network : &quot;
&quot; when I was aware of this new Facebook gui@@ del@@ ine , I made a post to tell my Facebook friends that the word is locked . &quot;
&quot; iron@@ ically , my post was removed from Facebook and told me that the posting , posts and sharing of content for 24 hours under@@ lines , because the post &quot; &quot; Facebook Community standards &quot; &quot; didn &apos;t meet the standards . &quot;
Facebook has a wide variety of posts from people who have no negative intentions or who simply try to show their opinions against the hate speech of radical nation@@ alists .
&quot; Patrick Mur@@ phy wrote that his post was removed , who has nothing to do with hate speech : &quot;
post without hate speech from Facebook .
&quot; in the post , the author told his opinion about why extreme nation@@ alism and religious fundament@@ alism in the country are bad . &quot;
&quot; Ch@@ an My@@ ae Kh@@ ine believes that Facebook should have done more before the start of the initiative , for example the Bur@@ m@@ ese Internet Community to ask for advice : &quot;
&quot; Facebook likes to have a ben@@ evol@@ ent intention to reduce rac@@ ism in Burma through their platform , but it does not work . &quot;
cens@@ oring such words will only bring more hatred within the various communities .
&quot; in addition , it seems that they have started this without a local context or technical support and have banned words like &quot; chair &quot; or &quot; pe@@ a cur@@ ry . &quot; &quot;
&quot; even when they found out that they made mistakes , they did not try to correct the fake posts . &quot;
&quot; if they had only slightly more respect for the 15 million benefits , which gave them a big turnover , that would be great . &quot;
fac@@ ebook automatic cens@@ or@@ ship has caused a lot of ridi@@ cu@@ le among users .
&quot; instead of taking it seriously , users now make fun of Facebook and consciously write the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; not in the context of hate speech to see if their posts are taken from the web . &quot;
&quot; here you can see some screen@@ shots of Facebook posts , which no hate speech contained , but still removed : &quot;
used with permission .
the Bur@@ m@@ ese text reads &quot; I want to sit on a chair and eat pe@@ as cur@@ ry and watch an Indian film .
&quot; just to try out if Facebook is the post that contains the word &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; screen@@ shot , used with permission . &quot;
&quot; if you are a doctor , do you heal people ? &quot;
&quot; screen@@ shot , used with permission . &quot;
&quot; over the past five years , extreme nation@@ alist ide@@ ologies and religious fundament@@ alists who have used social networks to expand their voices and influence has increased . &quot;
&quot; among other things , hate speech in social networks shall additionally heat violence in the congreg@@ ations in Myanmar , especially in the area of Rak@@ h@@ ine , where confron@@ tations between Muslims and Budd@@ hi@@ sts have forced thousands to flee . &quot;
&quot; Facebook was critic@@ ised for his failure to control , critic@@ ising hate speech on his bur@@ mes@@ an sites . &quot;
&quot; but instead of simply cens@@ oring the word &quot; Kal@@ ar , &quot; it would have looked better , rather in context than on code concentr@@ ating initiatives and learned from them . &quot;
in Trinidad &amp; # 0@@ 38 ; Tob@@ ago conclu@@ des with the children &apos;s marriage
a wedding ring in the sand .

the child marriage is now illegal in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago .
&quot; on 9 June 2017 , the country &apos;s parliament unanim@@ ously approved a law that aims to ban this practice so that the acceptable age is now 18 . &quot;
&quot; in May 2016 , Brother Har@@ ry@@ per@@ sad Mahar@@ aj , a group representing representatives of the various religious groups of the country , said that the state should not interfere as that , age not maturity . &quot;
&quot; this occurred despite the fact that Trinidad and Tob@@ ago is a contractual partner of the UN Children &apos;s Rights Convention , the min@@ ors as , &quot; &quot; every person under 18 years &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; statistics of the UN for 2002 @-@ 2012 show that the proportion of children who had already been married to 15 were 2.8 percent in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago , and with 18 were 8.1 percent . &quot;
&quot; in 2011 , the country &apos;s statistical office confirmed that more than 8@@ 400 girls and 1300 boys under 19 were married since 1997 @-@ 2007 . &quot;
&quot; online peti@@ tions and social media movements that were anxi@@ ous to abol@@ ish laws on children &apos;s marriage , followed at the foot and pleased with great support . undoubtedly , they helped bring about this outcome . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , not everything went smoothly . &quot;
&quot; for example , a Hin@@ du guide , for example , had no hes@@ itation to say the critic@@ isms of the children &apos;s marriage , they ought to take care of their own affairs . &quot;
&quot; this kind of religious opposition was anxi@@ ous for tensions in this un@@ complicated matter , and at some point doubts arise whether the opposition would agree to the bill in general . &quot;
&quot; but at the beginning of 2017 the bill was decided against the children &apos;s marriage - despite 4 Sen@@ ators ( including a woman ) of the opposition and an independent who could be discussed , so that he could be discussed in the House of Represent@@ atives , where a simple majority would make him a law . &quot;
now only the president of the country must agree and announce the law .
&quot; one of the Sen@@ ators of the country gave on Facebook a status update , which Les@@ lie @-@ Ann Bo@@ is@@ elle posted again on Inst@@ ag@@ ram : &quot;
&quot; Mr. Sen@@ ator Clar@@ ence Ram@@ b@@ har@@ at : the bill against the children &apos;s marriage was voted in the House of Represent@@ atives with 35 votes , and no one on the other . &quot;
&quot; after he had previously decided in the Senate , the draft can now become a law . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; Facebook member Lo@@ vel@@ l Francis , who cl@@ othed a minist@@ erial office in the Ministry of Education , said : &quot;
&quot; it has taken too much time and unnecessary talk , which has disgu@@ ised the core of the matter , but know what ? the child &apos;s marriage is now illegal in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago , and it is worth almost any price . &quot;
&quot; while Abel Jackson &apos;s opinion , it was definitely long enough to finish the practice , L@@ ara Qu@@ entr@@ al @-@ Thomas was over@@ jo@@ yed that the day was finally : &quot;
&quot; public status update on Facebook by L@@ ara Qu@@ entr@@ all@@ - Thomas , which states : &quot;
the Eh@@ eg@@ es@@ etz has been decided .
&quot; minimum age - 18 , voices - 35 for it - 0 on the other hand ! ! ! ! &quot;
&quot; Fol@@ ade Mut@@ ota , which belongs to the Women &apos;s Institute for Alternative Development ( WIN@@ AD ) , a civil society group that openly spoke about how important the adoption of the law was , noted : &quot;
the marriage @-@ capable age in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago is now independent of religious affili@@ ation 18 years .
&quot; the draft for the amend@@ ment of the marriage network was approved today , on 9 June 2017 . &quot;
&quot; in the House of Represent@@ atives , there are 41 de@@ pu@@ ties and 35 of them were present in the vote . &quot;
&quot; all MEPs , who were too opposed , voted for the law . &quot;
the pa@@ edi@@ atric is no longer allowed in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago .
it was a long battle ( ... ) # chil@@ d@@ marri@@ ag@@ ei@@ schil@@ dab@@ use .
many thanks to all the activists who have challenged him .
congratulations .
a Thank you to our MEPs .
&quot; but a possible hook is coming in the form of Sat Mahar@@ aj , the Secretary General of San@@ atan D@@ har@@ ma Mah@@ a Sab@@ ha , the most well @-@ known Hin@@ du organization of the country . &quot;
&quot; months ago Mahar@@ aj announced his intention to take judicial steps , the law should be passed , and he seems to be able to rede@@ em his promise . &quot;
&quot; while the General Prosec@@ utor of Paris Al @-@ ra@@ wi , a pro@@ pon@@ ent of the law , said it was quite legitimate if Mahar@@ aj wanted to act against the law , most social media users wished that the debate on the subject would be different . &quot;
Patricia Wor@@ rell suggested :
&quot; dear Sat , if we , instead of discussing the discussion as general , in a way that we invite the state into our bedroom , &quot; simply pur@@ pos@@ efully to talk about that the state , our daughters , protects them , may be ab@@ used by big , hard @-@ driven men who are opposed to them , &quot; would you then be ready to continue the discussion ? &quot;
or do you think that this is not a problem ?
&quot; however , whether it comes to a judicial action against the law or not , this legislation is an important step - however there are still places in the world where the pa@@ edi@@ atric use is legally or still the norm , although there are laws which they prohi@@ bit . &quot;

&quot; the h@@ ack@@ ers posted the YouTube video &quot; &quot; He is no Dim@@ on for you &quot; &quot; on the prosec@@ utor &apos;s website with the following comment : &quot; &quot; the Office of the Public Prosec@@ utor calls the citizens to not follow the pro@@ vocation and keep away from all non @-@ sanc@@ tioned events ! &quot;
&quot; at 11.15 , the message was removed from the page - however , it was preserved in the cache . &quot;

&quot; on Sunday , the Office of the Public Prosec@@ utor announced the local news service Yar@@ News that they were h@@ acked . &quot;
&quot; by reflecting websites , Turkish users can view Wikipedia content again &quot;
&quot; the Wikipedia page was printed on January 18 , 2012 , contrary to the SO@@ PA ( Stop Online Privacy Act ) and P@@ IP@@ A copyright legislation in the United States . &quot;
created by Wikipedia ( CC BY @-@ SA 3.0 )
&quot; for more than a month now , Turkey is blocking the popular and crow@@ d@@ sourcing principle based ency@@ clo@@ pedia Wikipedia . &quot;
day by day becomes more clear how important the platform for users is to find and share helpful information as well as reliable information .
both students and rep@@ or@@ ters and fans of TV series fight against the blocking .
&quot; although many advanced Internet users are used to using conversion tools for blocked websites ( a recent article from the New York Times reports that Turkey has the third largest VPN pre@@ valence ) , most of the usual Wikipedia users do not fall into this category . &quot;
&quot; although Turkey has been blocked by Wikipedia since 2008 , as recently published in a published report by Ber@@ k@@ man Klein Center for Internet &amp; amp ; Society at Harvard University , regular block@@ ages of the Internet have been held since 2007 , after the internet law ( No. 56@@ 51 ) was adopted . &quot;
&quot; after China , Turkey is the second most famous country in the world when it comes to the massive cens@@ or@@ ship from Wikipedia . &quot;
&quot; while the platform continues to be blocked , several mir@@ ror@@ faces ( pages that reflect the contents of Wikipedia and are often updated ) are sur@@ faced . &quot;
&quot; a solution came from IP@@ FS ( the Inter@@ planetary File System ) , when the platform depos@@ ited all Turkish Wikipedia pages on its de@@ centralized pe@@ er @-@ to @-@ pe@@ er network , which is not based on the system of domain names and thus makes a complete cens@@ or@@ ship difficult . &quot;
&quot; in spite of legal prohibition , the content is retri@@ ev@@ able . &quot;
in a blog post IP@@ FS reports about his efforts :
&quot; after we heard the news ( about the blocking of Wikipedia ) , we set everything to lay snap@@ shots from Wikipedia to the IP@@ FS platform . thus , it is possible to read the content on de@@ centralized and distributed fashion . &quot;
&quot; this can help users to see at least all Wikipedia content , even if they cannot reach the website www.@@ Wiki@@ pedi@@ a.@@ or@@ g. &quot;
&quot; IP@@ FS also admitted that this step was carried out independently of the Wik@@ im@@ edia Foundation , and it is merely screen@@ shots and no live or dynamic versions of the website . &quot;
&quot; however , Wik@@ im@@ edia was involved in other efforts to circum@@ vent the lock . &quot;
&quot; Cris@@ tian Con@@ son@@ ni of Wik@@ im@@ edia Italy has produced both tr@@ .@@ vi@@ ki@@ an@@ si@@ klo@@ pä@@ .org , a mir@@ ror@@ site from Wikipedia , as well as Wiki@@ Mirror , an open source project that everyone can use to host similar Mir@@ ror@@ sites when prohibited in the respective country Wikipedia . &quot;
Con@@ son@@ ni reported Sub@@ h@@ ash@@ ish Pan@@ ig@@ ra@@ hi - Global Vo@@ ices Member and staff at Mozilla in the Pan@@ ig@@ ra@@ hi &apos;s Open Spe@@ aks &quot; Pod@@ cast :
&quot; it is not a complete copy of a pro@@ xy address , a mirror . &quot;
you access another URL that is not the original . that what you see then is from Wikipedia .
&quot; in essence , the server further guides the request to the correct Wikipedia page , making it possible to see the contents of Wikipedia even if they are locked in Turkey . &quot;
this is done by a server that is not in Turkey .
a Nep@@ al@@ ese wildlife photographer uses his camera to draw attention to the need for conservation of nature
&quot; a succ@@ ul@@ ent rhin@@ oc@@ eros , Ch@@ it@@ wan . &quot;

&quot; Sag@@ ar Gir@@ i was never satisfied with the photos he saw around her , they were bl@@ urred with poor@@ ly positioned motifs and washed colours . &quot;
this motiv@@ ates him to carry a camera with himself and try to gra@@ ze the situation .
at that time he was still a child .
&quot; today , at the age of 28 , Sag@@ ar tries to bring Nep@@ al@@ ese wildlife to the international stage . &quot;
&quot; right next to Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , his hom@@ etown offers him the perfect opportunity to shoot photographs that draw attention to Nepal &apos;s wildlife . &quot;
&quot; on Facebook , he described this first @-@ class position in his work : &quot;
&quot; I live at the edge of Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , a world natural heritage . what could be better for a passionate wildlife photographer ! ! &quot;
I just rested at home when suddenly Navar@@ re ( the manager of Ch@@ it@@ wan G@@ aida Lodge ) called me . he had received a call from my father that on the banks of the Rap@@ ti river a le@@ op@@ ard would be .
the river dam@@ m is only a few minutes away from the tourist resort of Sau@@ ra@@ ha .
immediately I ran with my camera and was there in a few minutes .
my father watched him and showed me the place on the other river side where the le@@ op@@ ard was and I began to kne@@ el pictures immediately ! !
&quot; Sag@@ ar aims to cooperate with the authorities in order to gain worldwide recognition for Nep@@ al@@ ese nature , and would like to deep@@ en the understanding that wild animals are not as fri@@ ghtening as they look . &quot;
&quot; and he should know , for he had already stood face to face with tig@@ ers : &quot;
a tiger can not be disturbed by the opinion of the sheep in sleeping ! !
late in the evening . the light is too weak .
bed@@ time for all animals and birds .
&quot; I too was on the way home because of the darkness , when suddenly the king of the bu@@ he@@ e appeared . he immediately pus@@ hes away , we see ourselves and he star@@ es me through the S@@ al trees ! ! &quot;
&quot; to promote the protection of wild animals , Sag@@ ar placed the logo &quot; I click for conservation &quot; ( lit . : I click for environmental protection ) on his photos . &quot;
&quot; however , his passion for the promotion of Nep@@ al@@ ese nature and wildlife is not always easy . &quot;
&quot; he waited for 22 days , and mostly lived in a tent to take pictures of Ot@@ tern in the Bar@@ dia National Park . up to 12 days it took until he could photograph a tiger and live six to seven days for the perfect photo of birds , which live near the tourist accommodation . &quot;
take a look at some of these photos below .

&quot; years after the wedding , Indian women dare to pron@@ ounce the name of their hus@@ bands . &quot;

&quot; this article was written by Kay@@ on@@ a@@ az K@@ aly@@ zer@@ a and was originally published on Video Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers , an award @-@ winning international community media organization from India . &quot;
a revised version was published here as part of a content sharing agreement .
&quot; in many parts of India , women avoid with the greatest care to pron@@ ounce the name of their hus@@ bands or even from older men in the family . &quot;
&quot; instead , they use a pron@@ o@@ uns or say &quot; father of my child . &quot; &quot;
&quot; from Ch@@ hat@@ tis@@ gar@@ h to Mahar@@ ash@@ tra and U@@ tt@@ ar Pra@@ des@@ h , women admit that they should respect the husband because of social pressure , as well as fear of the consequences they should ab@@ stain from the norm . &quot;
&quot; last year , Mal@@ ati Mah@@ at@@ oto from the Indian state O@@ dish@@ a was con@@ vic@@ ted by a fake court and exp@@ elled from her family and the village community after having responded to a married family with names . &quot;
&quot; the tradition also does not name their wives by name , is also widespread among men . however , they have far less warran@@ ties to fear , if at all , they should not follow this practice . &quot;
&quot; in the small village of Wal@@ he in the district P@@ une , in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra , nine women , including health personnel as well as house@@ wives , a unique club and were thus quickly becoming the main theme of the city . &quot;
it is a place only for them alone where they can discuss and discuss the intri@@ c@@ acies of the patri@@ archy .
&quot; as one of 56 clubs , which exist in 13 Indian states , he is part of the campaign # K@@ hel@@ Bad@@ al , which is operated by the Community Video Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers and is committed to the degra@@ dation of the patri@@ archy . &quot;
&quot; Roh@@ ini Pa@@ has worked for seven years with the help of her video camera at the discovery of practices , such as children &apos;s marriage to the exile of H@@ IV@@ - and AIDS @-@ infected , and guides these clubs . &quot;
she tells about how these clubs have created a safe place for these women and at the same time have made them into amb@@ ass@@ ad@@ ors of the change .
&quot; the first video , which Roh@@ ini showed in her discussion round , was of women who did not name their hus@@ bands by name . &quot;
she chose this subject because she wanted to open the conversation about the patri@@ archy with a problem with which women can easily identify .
&quot; not to pron@@ ounce the name of their hus@@ bands lou@@ dly , it is a custom which they have du@@ ly maintained and never questioned . &quot;
= = = &gt; Sky@@ ly@@ n@@ x
this tradition testi@@ fies that a woman respects her husband and wishes him a long life .
&quot; a woman who does not respect this will be regarded as dec@@ eit@@ ful , as a woman without morality . &quot;
the tradition is so deeply rooted that we never thought about this discussion .
&quot; Roh@@ ini , who had never called her husband so far , wanted to try out at home as it runs . &quot;
she showed the video of the discussion round her husband and her mother @-@ in @-@ law .
Roh@@ ini tells :
my mother @-@ in @-@ law and my husband kept silent for a long time after the video was over .
&quot; Prak@@ ash , my husband , turned to me and said that I should call him from now on his name . &quot;
Roh@@ ini started their first discussion club with this self @-@ confidence in the luggage .
&quot; many women had never heard the word &quot; patri@@ archy &quot; never before . some believed it was a good thing , because it meant that the younger members of a family , especially girls and women , would be protected . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the round , Roh@@ ini showed a video about the problem in U@@ tt@@ ar Pra@@ des@@ h . &quot;
&quot; after the video projection , the women tried to get the discussion with an exercise . &quot;
&quot; Roh@@ ini asked each participant to tell the name of her husband with different feelings - happy , anno@@ yed , sad , loving and so on . &quot;
&quot; then she asked everyone , &quot; &quot; If we cannot say the name of our hus@@ bands , but they can call us how they want , does it mean that they don &apos;t respect us ? &quot;
&quot; should it not be equal ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day in which they brought the name of their hus@@ bands over their lips , &quot; &quot; says Roh@@ ini Pa@@ z from the village of Wal@@ he in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra over the crus@@ her of a secular tradition , in which married women can never pron@@ ounce the name of her hus@@ bands . &quot;
Roh@@ ini tells :
&quot; a woman was so shy , that during the whole exercise she was just sitting in front of herself ; another decided to let the whole st@@ ump fru@@ stration come out against him and his family by cur@@ sed him . &quot;
the expression on her faces was ec@@ static .
I think I will never forget it again .
&quot; still in the adren@@ aline rush of having broken with an old custom , women decided that they would actually attempt at home to name their hus@@ bands by name . &quot;
and they kept their word .
&quot; in the next few days , Roh@@ ini received a lot of reports . &quot;
the husband of a woman called Roh@@ ini and asked what ideas she put to her head : his wife could not stop saying his name .
another club member decided to do it during dinner before the whole family .
&quot; when her mother @-@ in @-@ law star@@ ed her , she was afraid and said it was a mistake . &quot;
&quot; another woman said , &quot; &quot; Roh@@ ini said I should do it . &quot;
a husband of a participant was less understanding and the situation came out of violence .
&quot; Roh@@ ini reports how women tried to stop other practices , such as wearing the zin@@ no@@ ber@@ red dot on the forehead that shows the sp@@ ouses : &quot;
why do women only have to show that they are married ?
&quot; I said to my husband , that I would wear the zin@@ no@@ ber@@ red point if he did it too . &quot;
he laugh@@ ed only and I stopped wearing it .
&quot; the other women have not completely stopped , but think they are now in a better position to choose themselves , not to wear it on some days . &quot;
&quot; for many women , the discussion club is a safe place where they can exchange opinions and goals . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we make a trip every time in the discussion club . &quot;
normally we pack lunch and water and go out to the field .
&quot; I don &apos;t want the women to worry about who they could hear , &quot; she says . &quot;
in the last months they celebrated their own birth@@ days with cakes for the first time ; they d@@ anced and sang about things that they had never thought before .
Roh@@ ini says :
&quot; I have been working on these problems for so many years and yet I have never talked about some things , for example as our identi@@ ties to our hus@@ bands . &quot;
&quot; it feels great to say certain things , no matter how small they occur . &quot;
&quot; in a discussion round , we talked about the concept of honor and how it is connected to the clothes . &quot;
some women in the group have only worn sar@@ is since their marriage .
&quot; for most this is okay , but some wanted to wear a Sal@@ mon @-@ Kur@@ ta , a wide shirt over a pants , they have not dar@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; after much dispute and discussion about the advantages of his own dress code , morality linked to sar@@ is and much more , Roh@@ ini made her own pair of Kur@@ tas ( Ober@@ hem@@ den ) into a round of discussion so that women could wear them . &quot;
&quot; next , they decided to plan a trip to Go@@ a where they can wear jeans and Roh@@ ini is sure they will create it . &quot;
&quot; on the question whether in the five months since its first discussion club has changed something , Roh@@ ini confirms that things are slowly coming into roles : &quot;
&quot; so far , we have only made small steps . &quot;
&quot; some women tried it a few times , but then they stopped saying the name of her husband . &quot;
&quot; some , including me , do not make it , but only if they are alone and no other family members are involved . &quot;
only one or two women continue to say the name of their hus@@ bands ; only one or two women are now wearing Zin@@ no@@ ber@@ rot on their forehead .
women in the discussion club know that the changes they want to achieve in their lives - like the F@@ eil@@ schen for more freedom of movement or the own dress code - lie at the end of a hard to navig@@ ating river .
&quot; by giving each other self @-@ confidence , they are aware that they are sitting in the same boat . &quot;
how Roh@@ ini explains :
each of us is a sacrifice of patri@@ archy .
I am it too .
but this club gives each of us the confidence that something will change .
&quot; and I know that it is not only limited to 30 families . there will be a chain reaction , when each woman goes home in the club and told other people about what we are talking about and what we do . &quot;
we all sit in the same boat .

the first Japan visit to the popular band The Beat@@ les is celebrated with a memorial day
the Beat@@ les in their landing in Japan .
screen@@ shot of the official YouTube channel of the Beat@@ les .
&quot; on the 29th of June this year , the H@@ ash@@ tag has been found in the Japanese Twitter Trend , where many fans exchanged memories and shared their appreciation for the Beat@@ les . &quot;
the visit of the Beat@@ les in 1966 in Japan is considered a revers@@ al in the Japanese culture of the post @-@ war period .
&quot; the first Japanese journalist , Hos@@ hi@@ ka Rum@@ iko , who inter@@ viewed the Beat@@ les 1964 in London , commented on the 50@@ th anniversary of the first visit : &quot;
&quot; for just barely five days , the Beat@@ les were in the country , but this was enough to let the Japanese go through . &quot;
people here really quickly became clear that they had no choice but to receive the Beat@@ les with open arms .
many well @-@ known Japanese sizes reached their zen@@ ith when the Beat@@ les came to Japan for the first time in 1966 .
&quot; the music of the cult band is &quot; more than just a universal language like English , &quot; Ry@@ ui@@ chi Is@@ aka , president of the retail giant Seven &amp; amp ; i Hol@@ dings , the online magazine Nik@@ k@@ ei Asian Review . &quot;
&quot; good morning ! &quot; &quot; Today is the Beat@@ les memorial day in Japan . &quot; &quot; after 51 years ago they were here in Tokyo . &quot;
&quot; even today , songs are sung by the Beat@@ les in Japanese kar@@ aoke bars and in English classes at Japanese middle schools . &quot;
the kit@@ sch of the Beat@@ les simply survi@@ ves everything .
today is Beat@@ les memorial day .
we all love the Beat@@ les in our house .
I don &apos;t know if this &quot; W@@ inn@@ ie the P@@ oo@@ h &quot; doll John L@@ enn@@ on is supposed to represent or not .
&quot; and as it is heard for fans , Japanese also make pilgri@@ ma@@ ges to the famous places connected with the band . &quot;
&quot; if you love the Beat@@ les , these are your 5 places you need to visit : &quot;
1 ) Abbey Road
2 ) Math@@ ew Street ( in Liverpool )
3 ) Stra@@ w@@ berry Fiel@@ ds ( Memorial in New York )
4 ) P@@ enny Lane
5 ) ( From Link ) The Beat@@ les Story ( Museum ) Liverpool
the pilgri@@ ma@@ ges can sometimes not be sc@@ ur@@ r@@ ile enough :
good morning together .
today is Beat@@ les memorial day .
&quot; exactly today in 1966 , the Beat@@ les came to Japan for the first time . &quot;
the characters from the film K @-@ On ! went on a pilgrimage to London and ran over the Abbey Road .
we did the same last year .
&quot; and of course , some companies also use the fan community , as such as this r@@ amen shop ( R@@ amen are Japanese no@@ od@@ les ) in Tokyo . &quot;
&quot; good morning , here is Mut@@ a@@ hi@@ ro Ko@@ ya R@@ amen ! &quot;
and what could it be for a day ?
&quot; today I will listen to &quot; &quot; Y@@ esterday &quot; &quot; and eat R@@ amen no@@ od@@ les at Mut@@ aro Ko@@ ya . &quot;
this is how the day is going to run today .
&quot; so , we hope you are here ! &quot;

smooth @-@ headed men are dep@@ orted and killed in Moz@@ ambique

&quot; a new system of kid@@ n@@ apping of flat @-@ headed persons for organ traff@@ icking , presum@@ ably for det@@ erg@@ ent purposes , distur@@ bs the police of Z@@ amb@@ é@@ zia , a province in Moz@@ ambique . the local government now called for a number of operations to stop the practice . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the month , three men were killed in the Mil@@ ange District , a few kilometres from the border to Malawi . &quot;
one of the victims was be@@ headed and a part of the organs had been removed .
&quot; two men were arrested , and subsequently they were admitted that the organs of sham@@ ans in Tanzania and Malawi are used . &quot;
&quot; there is the local super@@ sti@@ tion that the head of a flat @-@ headed man could have gold stays or wealth , explained the police spokes@@ man of Z@@ amb@@ é@@ zia of the BBC . &quot;
it is the first time succ@@ essive attacks on smooth @-@ headed men were registered in Moz@@ ambique .
&quot; another group , the goal of assass@@ inations for obsc@@ ure purposes , is people with al@@ bin@@ ism . &quot;
this led to the fact that the UN 2016 carried out a mission in the South African country to investigate this practice .
&quot; the persecution of people with al@@ bin@@ ism is common in other countries of Southern Africa , especially in neighbouring Tanzania , where the government developed campaigns to combat these super@@ sti@@ tions and prejudi@@ ces . &quot;
U@@ com@@ be We@@ ya lives in the city of Map@@ uto .
he warned those who are going to travel to the country :
&quot; attention to k@@ ah@@ le men who travel to Moz@@ ambique are target ritu@@ alistic att@@ acking , warned the Muslim police according to the latest assass@@ inations of three smooth @-@ headed men due to their body parts . &quot;
&quot; two susp@@ ects were arrested in the district of Mil@@ ange , where the assass@@ inations took place . &quot;
&quot; Hus@@ sene al@@ gy Adam@@ o , student and resident of the city of In@@ ham@@ bane in the south of Moz@@ ambique said that the local police had already followed the case : &quot;
PR@@ M believes that the sham@@ ans are involved in the death of the smooth @-@ headed men .
&quot; persecution and murder of smooth @-@ headed individuals for the extraction and sale of their organs in the district of Mor@@ rum@@ bal@@ a , province of Z@@ amb@@ é@@ zia , for presum@@ ed religious rituals , has commissioned cultural motives and is commissioned by the traditional sham@@ ans , which also acknow@@ le@@ dges that a faith existed , according to which the victims in the head might have power , the riches needed . &quot;
&quot; in recent days , three men have been murdered with emergency problems in this part of the country . &quot;
Angela Fer@@ rei@@ ra Sam@@ antha distributed on Facebook the chron@@ icle of the blo@@ gger Armen Sn@@ ai@@ ppa who suggested that the problem is part of the greater social difficulty in which Moz@@ ambique faces :
&quot; I would like to encourage E@@ IN MO@@ SAM@@ BI@@ K , THE SI@@ CH embarrass@@ ed A country where people would have shame to go to the street , to offer sex against good grades , and who would not hurt men or even their lives to get their bread , a country in which neither the al@@ bin@@ os nor bald or &quot; &quot; black magic &quot; &quot; are hun@@ ted to get their own wealth . &quot;
&quot; despite the seri@@ ousness of the phenomenon , some might not miss the opportunity for ma@@ kab@@ ren hum@@ our . &quot;
&quot; Zen@@ aida Mach@@ ado , scientist from Human Rights Watch for Angola and Moz@@ ambique and enthusiastic Twitter pay@@ er , twe@@ et@@ ete that both the head of the district Mor@@ rum@@ bal@@ a , Pedro Sap@@ ange , as well as the police spokes@@ man Z@@ amb@@ é@@ zi@@ as , In@@ á@@ cio D@@ ina , both smooth heads are : &quot;
the Moz@@ ambique Auth@@ orities are very worried about the kill@@ ings of smooth @-@ headed men .

&quot; the case of the det@@ ained Chinese dissi@@ dents Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o has drawn attention to the international community after his lawyer , at the end of June , announced that he was hospit@@ alized to the hospital because of liver cancer . &quot;

he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010 .
&quot; the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in China referred to the case as &quot; &quot; an internal affair &quot; &quot; and told a spokes@@ man that he considered it &quot; &quot; not necessary to discuss this matter with any other country . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , China continues to release calls from the international community , Nobel Peace Lau@@ re@@ ate and his wife , poet Li@@ u X@@ ia , or to permit him to be treated abroad . &quot;

&quot; the relationship between China and Norway came to the shock after the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to Li@@ u , although the Norwegian Government informed that this ultimately has nothing to do with the decision . &quot;
&quot; diplomatic relations were continued until December last year . only in June Norway signed an agreement to res@@ ume salmon exports to China , as exports have been largely blocked since 2010 . &quot;
&quot; after the news spread that Li@@ u was seriously ill , the Nobel Committee expressed his hope for an un@@ conditional release and invited Li@@ u to take his prize in Oslo . &quot;
&quot; due to his imprisonment , he was unable to accept his prize . &quot;
during the ceremony Li@@ u was represented by an empty chair .
European Union
&quot; on 6 July , the European Parliament adopted a decision to free Li@@ u and his wife immediately from house arrest and allow him to seek medical assistance wherever he wants . &quot;
&quot; the top diplom@@ at of the EU , Feder@@ ica Mo@@ gher@@ ini , also called for the release of Li@@ u as she reported in a statement on June 30 : &quot;
&quot; at the same time , we expect China to raise all limitations of Mr. Li@@ us &apos;s wife as well as family members . &quot;
&quot; they should meet and receive all visits they desire , and be able to communicate freely with the outside world . &quot;
United States
&quot; U.S. Ambassador Ter@@ ry Bran@@ stad announced that the Americans &quot; &quot; wish him that he has the opportunity to treat abroad , in so far as it helps him with his recovery . &quot;
&quot; a spokes@@ woman of the US Embassy in China , Mary Beth Pol@@ ley , announced the news agency AF@@ P on June 27 that the message sent the Chinese authorities to release not only Li@@ u , but also to liber@@ ate his wife Li@@ u X@@ ia from her house arrest . &quot;
&quot; the invitation of the US emb@@ assy drew a fur@@ ious response from China , with the utter@@ ance of the Foreign Ministry that &quot; no country has the right to interfere and make ir@@ responsible comments about Chinese internal affairs . &quot;
Pol@@ ley shared that China should offer the following couple :
&quot; protection and freedom , such as travel freedom and access to the medical care of its choice , which they claim according to Chinese constitution and legal system as well as international obligations . &quot;
&quot; the U.S. sen@@ ators Marco Ru@@ bio , Jeff Merk@@ ley and Ted Cruz have also adopted a resolution in Congress to push the Chinese government to liber@@ ate Li@@ u and his wife un@@ condition@@ ally . &quot;
&quot; I urge China to release Nobel lau@@ re@@ ate # Li@@ u@@ Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o un@@ condition@@ ally , so that he can go to proper medical treatment . http : / / bit.ly / 2@@ t@@ E@@ 6@@ k@@ U@@ o &quot;
United Kingdom
&quot; the German government spokes@@ person Steffen Sei@@ bert wrote on July 3 , Berlin , hoping that Li@@ u receives all the medical support he needs , and that a &quot; humanitarian solution for Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o should be the highest priority . &quot; &quot;
Chinese President Xi Jin@@ ping appeared on the G@@ 20 summit in Hamburg on 7 and 8 July .
&quot; previously reported diplomatic sources in Beijing the news agency Reuters , that China had big concerns , whether the vort@@ ex could over@@ shadow the visit to Hamburg . &quot;
Canada
&quot; on June 28 , Canadian Ambassador John Mc@@ Call@@ um called China to provide adequate medical care and give him the opportunity to take care of his family . &quot;
&quot; Li@@ us lawyer told AF@@ P previously that Li@@ u Ms , Li@@ u X@@ ia , could visit him every day , but the police always monitors the room in the hospital and that it is not allowed to speak with someone outside , including his lawyers , to speak and contact . &quot;
Mc@@ Call@@ um talks about :
&quot; Canada calls on China to uph@@ old its international human rights obligations , including freedom of expression , and fre@@ eing the rights required to exercise these rights . &quot;
France
&quot; in an Declaration on 29 June , the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs urged China to release Li@@ u for humanitarian reasons : &quot;
&quot; all necessary measures must be taken to ensure Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o receives all treatments that he , regardless of where , needs . furthermore , his wife and his family should have contact with him . &quot;
&quot; although the news channel France Info already reported that the French government would welcome Li@@ u in the country , the State Department announced that there is no further information out whether France will eventually receive it . &quot;
Taiwan
&quot; the Council of the continental affairs in Taiwan called on China on June 27 , to release Li@@ u and show a greater tolerance towards those who advoc@@ ate peaceful means to promote political reforms and democratic development . &quot;
Taiwan &apos;s Tai@@ wan@@ ese legislat@@ ure Yu M@@ ei @-@ n@@ u from the ruling Democratic Progressive Party also urged China to allow the sick intellectu@@ als Li@@ u to be treated in Taiwan .
Dalai Lama
&quot; the spiritual leader in Tibet , the Dalai Lama , showed very concern in a statement on June 28 , around Li@@ u and admitted that many asked him to pray for Li@@ u &apos;s well @-@ being . &quot;
he said about Li@@ u :
&quot; it is my belief that the initiatives he took , and for which he had been strictly punished , had led to a more harmonious , more stable and prosper@@ ous China , which in turn contributed to a more peaceful world . &quot;
&quot; I felt personally very moved and also encouraged when I saw hundreds of Chinese intellectu@@ als and affected citizens , inspired by Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o , the Charter 08 signed that stands for democracy , freedom and rule of law in China . &quot;
Singapore : city or country ?

is Singapore a city or country ?
&quot; the question may seem sil@@ ly , since Singapore is recognised as an independent state on an international level . &quot;
&quot; but according to the Minister of Justice K. Shan@@ mu@@ gam , Singapore should be considered a city . &quot;
this re@@ mark has triggered a debate in the blog@@ osphere .
&quot; during the meeting on the occasion of a meeting of the international branch of the Bar Association of the State of New York , the Minister noted that many people critici@@ zed the domin@@ ance of the only political party of Singapore because they were compared to Singapore with other countries . &quot;
he supported that Singapore should be considered a city .
... no one has questioned whether New York is a democracy ...
this is what most people commit a mistake .
I have tried to explain that we are different .
we are a city .
we are not a country .
the blog Cav@@ al@@ ier@@ io accused the Minister of Justice to &quot; twist the logic &quot; to defend the existing author@@ it@@ arian exercise of power in Singapore .
&quot; and then , after all our efforts and sacrific@@ ings to create this valuable land , we can say that ultimately we are not a country . &quot;
&quot; it so@@ unded so vul@@ gar , it had the appearance of an escape from the responsibilities , an obligation injury . &quot;
&quot; Singapore , if you are not my country , whose country is it then ? &quot;
&quot; the reasons mentioned by Shan@@ mu@@ gam were not very no@@ bel : he defended an idea according to which one could not measure the political system of Singapore with other &apos; normal countries &apos; , in the face of that , it inevitably appeared un@@ democratic . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , he defended the idea that Singapore should be compared to cities such as Chicago , San Francisco or New York , equally cities that are permanently run by a party . &quot;
these cities are democratic .
&quot; as soon as one reaches the core point of the topic , the good old ly@@ re of the author@@ it@@ arian rulers appear to be pre@@ ten@@ ding democr@@ ats , leaving the twi@@ sted logic because it fits better to their power . &quot;
&quot; in the end , the answers to his American guests in the last week were given answers to his American guests regarding our press , our it@@ dic@@ ative , our political system . &quot;
he warned him with non @-@ answers rational species .
Rachel Z@@ eng calls for Shan@@ mu@@ gam to clarify his opinions as she did not understand this conclusion .
I personally find it a bit difficult to swal@@ low .
&quot; if Singapore is not a country , but a city , so to which country is our city ... &quot;
&quot; in short , I don &apos;t understand anything . &quot;
&quot; I would be very grateful if our wer@@ ter K Shan@@ mu@@ gam would take the effort to clarify this point , if he was paid high to be part of the government of the city of Singapore . &quot;
&quot; by posting his comment on the blog , he points out the critic@@ isms that one should start reading the whole tran@@ script of the conference so that one could better understand the context of the statements made by Shan@@ mu@@ gam , according to which Singapore was a city and not a country . &quot;
read the tran@@ script .
&quot; when he said that Singapore was more of a &quot; city &quot; than a country , &quot; he explained why the Singapore elections were so un@@ even important even if we enjoy free and just choices . &quot;
he compared Singapore with cities in the US ( and how many of these cities saw a party for decades ? ) .
&quot; as he said , Singapore is not a country , &quot; he obviously does not mean it in this sense ! &quot;
&quot; Cle@@ ment T@@ an shows his dis@@ appointment about Shan@@ mu@@ gam , who as leader of a growing generation , makes such a pol@@ em@@ ical statement . &quot;
I am very embarrass@@ ed about what the Minister of Justice has said of Singapore ...
&quot; at least I knew with Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew and the members of the old Gar@@ de , what I expected - whether I agree with them or not , but that &apos;s another thing . &quot;
&quot; but with K. Shan@@ mu@@ gam , member of the new generation of the new generation of the political leaders of Singapore , I have doubts and I &apos;m not even sure if he really believes it is right and aware of what he def@@ ends . &quot;
the TE@@ MA@@ SEK Review de@@ compos@@ es the weak points of Shan@@ mu@@ g@@ ams &apos;s arguments :
&quot; did Mr. Shan@@ mu@@ gam did a mistake , or was it a Freu@@ dian spokes@@ man ? &quot;
&quot; if Singapore is not a country , we are regarded only as an independent and sovereign state ? &quot;
&quot; if not , on which country are the sovereign rights of the city of Singapore back ? &quot;
&quot; Singapore is unique , it is equally land and city . &quot;
&quot; as he plays an important role within the cabinet , the statements of Mr. Shan@@ mu@@ gam are of serious importance . &quot;
&quot; why do the people of Singapore afford their military service , they only defend their city , but not their country ? &quot;
whom must our Prime Minister have to pay invo@@ ices ?
what is the value of our pink staff ID ?
are we citizens of a country or the inhabitants of a city ?
&quot; journey Journey of a Dec@@ ade to Be@@ j@@ ah@@ ung , Singapore is and always has been a city : &quot;
I did not say what I said ...
this sentence seems to have anno@@ yed many Singap@@ urer ...
nobody ever said that Singapore is a country .
we were always a city .
we have always been a city / island state .
&quot; I can understand that we often hear statements like &quot; the defense of the country , above all , &quot; etc , but that is not quite right . &quot;
we should rather speak of the defence of the city .

&quot; her answers are published here as part of an ongoing series , with the rum@@ ours of certain parts of the world to be revealed and another fac@@ et should be shown . &quot;
&quot; the latest part of this series comes from Nev@@ in Thom@@ p@@ son , editor for Global Vo@@ ices Japan , who lives in Canada and Japan . &quot;
the question that is most asked to me in Japan is : &quot; are you Americans ? &quot;
&quot; no , I &apos;m sorry , &quot; I answered . &quot; I &apos;m from Canada . &quot; since 1994 I live and back in Japan . &quot;
&quot; depending on the situation the conversation takes place , it is considered pol@@ ite to show interest in his inter@@ loc@@ utor by asking personal questions . &quot;
&quot; my clari@@ fication then usually follows the standard answer : &quot; Oh , Rocky Mountains , ice ho@@ ckey , nature . &quot; many Canadi@@ ans cook in@@ war@@ dly with anger when they are held for Americans , but they don &apos;t b@@ other me . &quot;
&quot; for someone who doesn &apos;t know himself , there is little that distingu@@ ishes us Canadi@@ ans from Americans . &quot;
this is one of the reasons why so many Canadi@@ ans get a Canadian flag visible on their ruck@@ sack when they travel .
all dear Canadi@@ ans .
Americans on the other hand ... .
&quot; so it was already when I began to travel through the world 20 years ago - before Donald Tr@@ ump , before the invasion of Iraq and before September 11 . &quot;
Canadi@@ ans have always carried little map@@ le leaves on their baggage to distinguish themselves from their American neighbors .
we have a free healthcare system !
with us there are no weapons !
same @-@ sex marri@@ ages have been legal in Canada since 2005 !
&quot; all seem to think , Canada is so great . &quot;
we are pol@@ ite .
we obviously say very often &quot; ap@@ ologies . &quot;
Canada is also considered to be the most toler@@ ant country against ethnic groups .
we are not as these guys south of the border .
we Canadi@@ ans are nice .
I hate that .
&quot; first , I have many American friends that I admire very much . &quot;
there wouldn &apos;t be anything to me if you would switch to Johnny from Dallas for example .
with Marc from Austin .
with Adam from San Francisco .
or with Michael from Hon@@ ol@@ ulu .
but there are also some problems with the stamp &quot; nice . &quot;
&quot; first : being called &quot; &quot; nice &quot; &quot; means to be fun - just like the good @-@ nat@@ ured , gentle but trag@@ ically in@@ significant figure N@@ ed Flan@@ ders from &quot; Die Simp@@ sons &quot; ( which has its own Canadian Doppel@@ gän@@ ger ) . &quot;
&quot; if Canada really would be a nation full of people like N@@ ed Flan@@ ders , that would indeed be a step forward . but the real problem is that &quot; &quot; nice &quot; &quot; has no personality . &quot;
&quot; there are no corners and edges , nothing you can encounter . &quot;
being harmless is to be in@@ con@@ spic@@ uous and un@@ interesting and not deserve attention .
&quot; this can be a good thing if you want to stay un@@ noticed in the background , away from things that happen around one . &quot;
&quot; I would even go as far as to say that the desire to be free and alone , is a main part of Canadi@@ ans . &quot;
we tend to take care of our own affairs only .
&quot; what out@@ si@@ ders call &quot; &quot; nice &quot; &quot; is perhaps just cool courtesy . &quot;
Canadi@@ ans do not often talk about the fence with the neighbors .
&quot; we lack the warm , open friendliness that I have meanwhile joined with my American friends . &quot;
fortunately for us ( and for the rest of the world ) Jus@@ tin Tru@@ deau entered the stage to show that Canadi@@ ans are more than just &quot; nice . &quot; our prime minister has made Canada virtually sexy .
Musik@@ video of a Pop @-@ Band par@@ odi@@ ert Tha@@ il@@ ands Jun@@ ta
&quot; a pop band celebrated in Thailand has released a music video , which par@@ odi@@ zes the Jun@@ ta , which in 2014 re@@ alizes the power , and in spite of its promise to restore the civi@@ c government , continues to rule the country . &quot;
&quot; the new song &quot; Dic@@ t@@ ator Girl &quot; ( P@@ ha@@ det Girl ) of the band Tattoo Colour describes a young man who tells the instructions he makes his girl@@ friend .
&quot; although not specifically politically , the music video refers indirectly to the continuing military rule of the jun@@ ta . &quot;
the band was praised by many fans and other Internet users for their courage to describe the situation of the country .
the video to the song was a huge success .
&quot; within the first three days alone , the video uploaded to Facebook was 1.@@ 254 times and received 8,@@ 800 Li@@ kes . &quot;
&quot; last month , even the Charlie Chap@@ lin video &quot; The Dic@@ t@@ ator &quot; was blocked in Thailand after a group of activists encouraged the public to watch this video . &quot;
&quot; the video can be interpreted as a creative and entertaining introduction to Thai politics , in particular how it beha@@ ves with the situation of the country under the Jun@@ ta rule . &quot;
have a look at these recordings of the video that relate to some of the political issues that Thailand has persist@@ ently pursued over the past three years .
&quot; the &quot; 44 rules of the girls &quot; may refer to the dra@@ con@@ ian section 44 of the provis@@ ional constitution , which grants absolute decision @-@ making over important national issues . &quot;
&quot; the 11th rule : &quot; &quot; change your attitude &quot; &quot; refers to the not@@ orious program of &quot; &quot; adjustment change &quot; &quot; of journalists , students , scientists , activists , politicians and other persons considered by the Jun@@ ta as critics . &quot;
&quot; the image above reflects the introduction of the law on computer crime , whose vag@@ ue and un@@ clear rules are often exploited by the authorities to arrest activists and other critics of the state . &quot;
&quot; for this purpose , a new unit in the army has also been set up , the online content guar@@ ded and persons who are accused of having denied the monarchy is prosec@@ uted . &quot;
Thailand sets a strict term against &quot; &quot; L@@ ese Maj@@ ority &quot; &quot; ( maj@@ esty ) . &quot;
&quot; on 20 May 2014 , the war law was proclaimed in Thailand . &quot;
two days later it came to a coup of the army .
&quot; one of the problems that the Jun@@ ta continued to pursue is to buy expensive sub@@ mar@@ ines , although security experts warned that the purchase is unnecessary and a waste of tax money . &quot;
&quot; the video even shows how people are thrown into a black delivery van , before putting them into an intern@@ ment camp , another problem . &quot;
&quot; some journalists are in prison because they allegedly caused &quot; &quot; confusion &quot; &quot; in society and Internet users are threatened with long sentences , they should en@@ qu@@ ire the monarchy . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , the te@@ aser of the songs showed members of the band that im@@ it@@ ated the Sal@@ ut of &quot; The Tri@@ bute of Pan@@ em , &quot; which was already used by put@@ sch opponents during the protests in 2014 . &quot;
life goes on in the ruins of the ghost towns in eastern South @-@ East Asia

&quot; the following article , written by Dmit@@ ri Stat@@ ey@@ nov , was first published on the OC Media website and appears here with kind permission . &quot;
&quot; the post @-@ war society only reco@@ vers very slowly in East @-@ West @-@ Asia , especially in the district of T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al . &quot;
&quot; it has now passed over 20 years since the Georgi@@ an @-@ ab@@ ch@@ as@@ sic war has been officially ended , but its sc@@ ars are still visible in this part of the Republic . &quot;
the abandoned villages of the northern districts in T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al show striking images .
&quot; villages such as D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha , Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , Py@@ at@@ aya Sha@@ k@@ ht@@ a , Poly@@ ana and K@@ har@@ chil@@ ava are located in the hydro@@ massage of Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia . &quot;
&quot; various ethnic groups such as Russians , Greeks , isol@@ ation@@ aries , Georgi@@ ans and Armen@@ ians lived and worked together for Soviet times in the area . &quot;
many of them had to leave their homes during the war .
&quot; today , most of the Russians and Ab@@ ys@@ ses live in the area . &quot;
such settlements are also called ghost towns in Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia .
&quot; in the pre @-@ war era more than 10,000 people lived here , today there are only a few hundred people in these ghost towns . &quot;
this phenomenon is characteristic of T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al .
&quot; since 2011 , the total population of the district was 16@@ ,000 people , having barely risen over a decade . &quot;
&quot; in 1989 , about 43@@ .000 people lived in this district . &quot;

&quot; all this is a result of the war &quot;
&quot; the empty five @-@ storey blocks of the Soviet Union from the early &apos; 60s , called Chr@@ u@@ sch@@ t@@ schu@@ kov@@ ka , symboli@@ ze the decline and devast@@ ation of the region . &quot;
the buildings are tra@@ pped and very rare they are inhabited by more than two families .

at the entrance of the village D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha I met a local elderly man .
he begins a conversation and it is difficult for him to end this .
&quot; all this is a result of war . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; can I talk to you ? &quot; &quot; why talk ? &quot;
it is nonetheless unique . &quot;
before the war the village was full of life .
&quot; there were community centers , schools and kinder@@ gart@@ ens that served all the community . &quot;
now there is only paved road with f@@ aded spl@@ end@@ or buildings .
&quot; the people , who once lived in this place and made their contribution to the central planning economy of the Soviet Union , have now abandoned the district . &quot;
in the ghost town of D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha approximately fifty inhabitants live .
&quot; approximately 38 people live in Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , in the other villages it looks similar . &quot;
&quot; the Chr@@ u@@ sch@@ ch@@ ow@@ ka , which still houses one or two families , can be seen on the balconies , where laundry is dried . &quot;
&quot; two young girls , both seven years old , look out of the window of a destroyed house . &quot;
&quot; when they discover me in the hand with the camera , they immediately pull themselves back . &quot;
&quot; our mother has forbidden us to take pictures , &quot; &quot; says one of the girls . &quot;
&quot; why ? &quot; &quot; she just forbidden it , that &apos;s all . &quot;
the girl whis@@ pers something to her girl@@ friend and suddenly they leave the destroyed building and disappear .
many people in the area work for a small tur@@ k@@ ish mining company called T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al@@ u@@ go@@ l .
&quot; families are also involved in the subsi@@ st@@ ence economy ( cultivation of agricultural products for personal use ) such as cattle breeding , be@@ ekeeping and vegetable farming . &quot;
it is difficult to get over the rounds .
&quot; in the winter , the District Administration supplies candles and bread to the villages free of charge . &quot;

Gal@@ ina does not want to receive financial help from her daughter and insi@@ sts that she instead supports her young grand@@ children .
Gal@@ inas Mon@@ thly Rent are just nine dollars .
&quot; if you do not have a vegetable garden or a house , it is very difficult to survive , &quot; she says . &quot;

&quot; a 90 @-@ year @-@ old woman as well as a young family and I live in this building .
&quot; when vac@@ ations are , we visit us . &quot;
but we cannot constantly do this - everyone is busy with his own problems . &quot;
&quot; as she tells her story , a younger neighbor appears on the balcony . &quot;
&quot; Nat@@ ascha , &quot; T@@ ante G@@ AL@@ Y@@ A calls her to her . &quot; they said we could build zu@@ cch@@ ini . &quot;
I have already prepared the floor .
&quot; I don &apos;t know what will happen , but we will grow cour@@ get@@ tes . &quot;
&quot; you can get used to everything &quot;
G@@ aly@@ as &apos;s convers@@ ation@@ alist Nat@@ ascha lived together with her husband and the five common children in her house for some time .
Nat@@ ascha was 11 years old when the war began .
every day she rec@@ alls the village of village before the war .
&quot; despite the relatives who live in Central Russia , Os@@ se@@ tia and Georgia ( the country of Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia was simply gone ) , they did not have the opportunity to leave . &quot;

&quot; we recently bought land in Su@@ k@@ hum@@ i ( administrative capital in Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia ) .
&quot; we want to build a house there , but it will take some time , &quot; &quot; she explains . &quot;
Nat@@ ascha receives approximately $ 9 child money for each child .
her husband is working in the coal mine .
the young family has its own farm .
&quot; close to the house where Nat@@ ascha &apos;s kinder@@ garten was once , they hold pigs , cows , co@@ cks and chick@@ ens . &quot;
it tells us that it was at first a very sc@@ ary situation when many people left the village after the war .
but over time she lost her anxiety .

&quot; &quot; &quot; we are not afraid of the dark street or the few people . &quot;
you can get used to everything .
many people believe that these buildings were destroyed during the war .
&quot; in fact , it has something to do with lo@@ oting . &quot;
after the war there was little work and all lived as it was right for them .
I remember every day as the city and the war once were .
&quot; when our conversation comes to the end , a little boy runs past us . &quot;
it runs through the window of a destroyed building and is hidden .
a ball flies out of the window and another boy hun@@ ts him behind .
he plays with the ball rolling down the hill .
a group of children now pursu@@ es the ball .
&quot; while they run , some of them throw stones to the lost buildings . &quot;
&quot; these ruins are part of their childhood , which care for in@@ still@@ ness in their lives . &quot;
they don &apos;t know it differently .

&quot; on the way of migrants who cross Europe or Latin America , certain places for their hospitality are known . &quot;
I visited one of these places in the Mexican city of Tap@@ ach@@ ula and is located at the border to Guatemala .
it is a very simple hotel near the city centre .
&quot; it is led by a 59 @-@ year @-@ old Mexican woman , a small woman with a coral pink Br@@ ill@@ en@@ gestell and gold colored earrings in ted@@ dy bear form . &quot;
&quot; she is called Concep@@ ci@@ ón Gon@@ z@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez , and was born in Tap@@ ach@@ ula and grew up there . nevertheless , they know many under the name Mama Africa . &quot;
this nick@@ name is the fact that the hotel ( or rather it ) has become a target for Afri@@ cans and Hai@@ tians who are on transit .
the hotel does not have any charm .
&quot; for about 2.50 dollars , the guests sleep in simple rooms , with bare , crum@@ bling walls and beds made of metal . &quot;
in the an@@ ter@@ oom there is a par@@ rot in a cage .
there is no sign for the hotel - nevertheless hundreds of African and Hai@@ tian migrants come here .
&quot; sometimes , Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez , the people come in full mini@@ buses and from the upper part of the coast they start calling : &quot; &quot; Mama Africa ! &quot;
where are you M@@ um Africa ? .
&quot; at the moment it is rather quiet , but this year Ram@@ í@@ rez has already received 200 guests at the same time . &quot;
&quot; there are only 24 rooms , some have also slept outdoors on board . &quot;
she does not want to reject anyone .
&quot; she also helps them and brings them to the hospital when they are sick , she bu@@ ys them medication they can &apos;t pay , she mass@@ ages them with a bal@@ m that exhausted from the long journey . &quot;
&quot; Ty@@ chic@@ que Sebas@@ ti@@ ao , originally from Angola , has arrived recently . &quot;
I asked him if Mama Africa was an appropriate nick@@ name for Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez .
the family Sebas@@ ti@@ ao ( with her daughter Mer@@ ru@@ i who has a Jo@@ gh@@ ur@@ t@@ bart ) pos@@ ing with Concep@@ ci@@ ón Gon@@ z@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez .
the family came from Angola to Brazil and hopes to go to Boston .
Foto : Amy Bra@@ cken .
&quot; yes , yes , &quot; he answers with a smile . &quot; I really feel that it suits you because African women are very nice women . &quot;
very aff@@ ection@@ ate .
she has the cor@@ di@@ ality of a mother ...
we feel very comfortable here . &quot;
Sebas@@ ti@@ ao travels with his sister who hopes to get to Boston to find her husband and the three children .
&quot; they have lived in Brazil , but it is for some Afri@@ cans who are on the way to the United States to make a first stop in South America and then pull towards the north . &quot;
&quot; the family had heard of other companions of Mama Africa . &quot; &quot; Mama Africa is a well @-@ known name on the track , &quot; &quot; explains Felix Michel@@ et , a guest from Haiti . &quot;
&quot; he tells us that the Hai@@ tians and Afri@@ cans often travel the route together , and that the Afri@@ cans are already speaking on W@@ hat@@ s@@ app from Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez . &quot;
&quot; like many of his companions , Michel@@ et lived previously in Brazil and worked as a construction worker on construction sites of the Olympic Games and the Football World Cup . &quot;
&quot; when the Brazilian economy became weaker , he started his journey to the United States . &quot;
he has been guest in Mama Africa for months : he sells SIM cards to save the necessary money to buy the bus ticket to Ti@@ juana .
I wonder if he will have contact with Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez in the future .
&quot; Mama Africa is our mother and we never leave her again , &quot; he respon@@ ds smiling . &quot; we will always stay in touch . &quot;
Ram@@ í@@ rez &apos;s wife tells that her guests often send text messages if they went to greet them or to report on the course of their journey .
she explains that her Christian faith is the drive of her work .
&quot; she doesn &apos;t know much about Africa , but her guests have taught her to prepare chicken as in Ghana . &quot;
&quot; Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez is well known here , but she is not the only spar@@ king hope for migrants travelling through tap@@ ach@@ ula . &quot;
at the other end of the city a dead end leads to Jes@@ ú@@ s Valen@@ zu@@ ela .
&quot; this winter , Valen@@ zu@@ ela and his family have included migrants in their small house . &quot;
it is a polic@@ eman and has found that the bus tickets to numerous African migrants are sold too expensive .
&quot; he started to help them to get a reasonable price , then he offered them his house for a dollar the night . &quot;
&quot; at the moment there are 25 people , mainly Hai@@ tians . &quot;
&quot; some sleep on the floor , but at least they have electricity , a washing machine and a cooking place outside . &quot;
Valen@@ zu@@ ela explains that he knows what the guests are going through .
&quot; I have lived in the United States , &quot; he says . &quot; I have experienced what they experience . &quot;
I crossed the border over the desert and we suffered .
there are places where people can help and others not help . that &apos;s the reason why I give them my support .
&quot; after having lived for three years , he was exp@@ elled from the United States after a raid on his job . &quot;
&quot; the majority of migrants travelling through Tap@@ ach@@ ula comes from Central America , other residents also open the doors of their homes for them . &quot;
&quot; José Antonio Cor@@ dova Mel@@ é@@ n@@ dez tells me that he fled to Honduras with his wife and his three children , who wanted to black@@ mail him money without having a plan . &quot;
&quot; in Tap@@ ach@@ ula , he asked for accommodation and an unknown person who is alone , has offered him a roof . &quot;
&quot; a few months later , the family still lives there and she tries to decide where the next steps are to go . &quot;
back in the house of Mama Africa everything is again full of guests .
&quot; in the courses , the travellers consult quietly their phones . &quot;
&quot; a mini@@ bus arrived today and has brought 20 new guests , a large majority of Somalia . &quot;
&quot; Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez seems happy that her house is full , but she is also nostal@@ gic for those who have gone away . &quot;
like a proud grand@@ mother she flat@@ tens her in her album with numerous photos .
&quot; there is one of her daughter with African hair care , who made her an Kun@@ din , some photos of her grand@@ children and many travelers more , boy and old . &quot;
she laugh@@ s sad as she briefly presents her to me .
&quot; Ya se fu@@ er@@ on , &quot; she repeated every time . &quot; they have already gone . &quot;
China : X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang inhabitants are forced to install a surveillance app on their mobile phones .
&quot; a check @-@ point for personal communication devices in X@@ inj@@ ang of Twitter users , as well as one of the most popular &quot;
&quot; the inhabitants of X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang , an ethnic minority region in western China , are forced to install a spy@@ ware on their mobile phones . &quot;
&quot; on July 10 , the mobile user in the Ti@@ an@@ shan District of the city of Ur@@ um@@ qi received a mobile phone notification in which it instruc@@ ts the district government to install a surveillance app named J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang ( or &quot; Web Cle@@ aning &quot; ) . &quot;
&quot; in the message , it is said that the app is to prevent access to terrorist information . &quot;
&quot; however , the authorities would also use the app for more than the fight against terrorism . &quot;
&quot; according to an exclusive report by Radio Free Asia , 10 Kaz@@ ak@@ h women were arrested in the autonomous Il@@ i Kaz@@ ak@@ h pre@@ f@@ ecture because they , shortly after they had installed the app , had exchanged messages with a private chat group . &quot;
&quot; the police said that the app would determine and follow the sources and distribution channels of terrorists , along with &quot; illegal religious &quot; activities and &quot; harmful information &quot; including videos , pictures , e@@ Books and documents . &quot;
J@@ ing@@ wan@@ gs &apos;s website describes the app as follows :
&quot; J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang is a protection service with system categories for children and adults , introduced by Ji@@ angs@@ u Telec@@ om . &quot;
&quot; the main function is blocking of porno@@ graphic web pages , from online fraud , tro@@ j@@ ans and ph@@ ishing pages to alert users how much time they spend online , and remot@@ ely control their home network . &quot;
this app with filters for min@@ ors is intended to help children develop a healthy lifestyle .
&quot; of course , an app with these functions can be used in many ways . &quot;
&quot; for example , the &quot; remote control &quot; could enable state actors or even h@@ ack@@ ers to manipul@@ ate or ste@@ al the home network of a person . &quot;
this introduction is consistent with other measures to control digital activities in this region .
&quot; while messages about digital cens@@ or@@ ship in China focus mostly on the experiences of users in the larger cities in the east and south , reality is very often glo@@ omy for those who live in remote , crowded ethnic minority regions such as X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang and Tibet . &quot;
&quot; to limit un@@ rest and dis@@ content in conflict areas , authorities often arrange extreme cens@@ ors and surveillance measures as well as routine internet shut@@ dow@@ ns . &quot;
&quot; based on Twitter based Media Out@@ let images from China , the cens@@ ored news published in China showed photos of a checkpoint , at which police officers checked the inhabitants random@@ ly , whether they had installed the surveillance app . &quot;
the authorities in X@@ inj@@ ian make sure people use the official J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang app .
mobile noti@@ fications required people to install the app within 10 days .
&quot; if you are detected at a checkpoint with a device without this software , they could be det@@ ained up to 10 days . &quot;
this is a set@@ back for technological development .
they have forced people to use devices that are meant for older people .
this is a form of captivity by the imaging technology .
we are back in Ma@@ os China .
&quot; images from Auto China &quot; ( &quot; &quot; Fav@@ our@@ ites &quot; &quot; ) released a j@@ ing@@ w@@ ang product description from which the software can lift up the password requirement of a Windows operating system , thereby receiving unlimited access to the computer &apos;s hard drive . &quot;
&quot; after installing J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang , computers and mobile phones are used in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang to electronic hand@@ cu@@ ffs . &quot;
the rules in J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang may be a reaction to the instructions of the City Council to minimize the dis@@ sem@@ ination of illegal content .
&quot; all government branches , authorities and party @-@ related institutions including universities and research institutions are obliged to follow the instructions of the Cyber@@ security Office on the operation of their computers and communication devices . &quot;
&quot; a recent report from Freedom House , a US @-@ American human rights organisation , also mentioned these new monitoring methods : &quot;
&quot; in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang , on June 27 , in a district of the regional capital of Ur@@ um@@ qi , the authorities issued an ordin@@ ance to all residents and entrepreneurs to register their &quot; personal ID cards , mobile drives , external drives , portable hard drives , not@@ ebooks and media memory cards &quot; at the local police . &quot;
&quot; the intention is obviously to identify and destroy any &quot; terrorist videos . &quot; however , this action viol@@ ates the personality rights of Ur@@ um@@ qu@@ is three million inhabitants and gives them pen@@ alties for a whole range of other possible off@@ ences , including those who refer to peaceful religious or political messages . &quot;
&quot; sleep or death , part 1 : everything cri@@ es after death &quot;
a single cell in Old Dub@@ bo Ga@@ ol .

this is the first of six reports in the series &quot; Sleep or Death &quot; in which the activ@@ ist Sar@@ mad Al J@@ il@@ ane describes his experiences in a Syrian prison .
&quot; far from our blue , virtual world you look at yourself and realize that you are all alone in a place where everything is important . &quot;
everything has gradually dissolved and revealed a truth that is clearly recogni@@ zable from both inside and outside .
one that makes all the glory of their name .
one that has broken down into a list of feelings and expressions that do not allow met@@ aph@@ ors .
&quot; but when the reality reco@@ vers and you look behind the scenes - beyond the actor , the beautiful scenes and the performer - the characters transform into beings from flesh and blood , and everything cri@@ es after death . &quot;
&quot; all doubt dis@@ solve in smoke and you will be aware of your existence , even if the Earth moves on the axis of the disaster . you will realize that you are tra@@ pped between the walls that your parents , and before them your grand@@ parents , stone around stone . &quot;
&quot; they arrested me and my father three times , but that wasn &apos;t enough for me to learn &quot; &quot; my lesson &quot; , &quot; as the chief of safety servant formulated it - with the promise that the fourth time would become a pleasure . &quot;
he proved his power over us by destroying even the simpl@@ est concepts we knew .
five young people were torn from the beautiful garden of our revolution during a peaceful protest .
it was enough for the city to rent the darkness of the night with &quot; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &quot; scre@@ ams .
&quot; all the city districts sought after , only my own . &quot;
&quot; for the first time it was quiet , rest@@ less , at the wrong time , even if I didn &apos;t put any high demands on a city that is stuff@@ ed up to the arter@@ ies with state security organisms and their ac@@ compli@@ ces . &quot;
&quot; in the third night things had cal@@ med down , after the power supply in the neighborhood stopped functioning . &quot;
I broke through the silence by scre@@ aming several times &quot; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &quot; from my home roof .
I listened to my voice through the silence .
few minutes later some of my friends felt cour@@ age@@ ous enough to find together .
I was not alone .
&quot; many friends , real friends joined me ; we joined us to a gorgeous image that filled my expectations completely and completely . &quot;
&quot; in such a moment you are aware that you liber@@ ate the spirit from the lamp , but it simply doesn &apos;t interest you in the least . &quot;
&quot; I received a call from my father : &quot; &quot; get ready , we meet at the military security building . &quot;
he put up .
&quot; then I learned the following : no matter how much honey you can swal@@ low you - nothing can give you back your voice , after you read it all the way up to the office of security service from the body . &quot;
I arrived there .
&quot; the Colonel Gh@@ ass@@ an was standing there with several of his men , my father was already there , as I am now . &quot;
&quot; the Colonel Gh@@ ass@@ an begins to say : &quot; let me hear as you cry &quot; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar , &quot; or you are only brave enough to cry when we are not nearby . &quot;
his eyes @-@ filled eyes focused on me .
and you really dare to look into your eyes and not on the ground !
what I did then has nothing to do with courage .
&quot; I was 18 years old , it was the fourth time that I stood in front of this building . &quot;
&quot; perhaps it was in my fol@@ ly , van@@ ity ; perhaps at the revolution . &quot;
&quot; I was so sure of my cause when I replied , &quot; &quot; I didn &apos;t think you &apos;ve forgotten my voice again since yesterday . &quot;
&quot; and I think I have never stopped looking into your eyes , so why should I do it now ? &quot;
&quot; it was the short@@ est entertainment that could have such fatal consequences for me , and yet I regret not a word of what I said . &quot;
&quot; put him in sol@@ itary confin@@ ement , and his father just like that . &quot;
&quot; his father immediately with it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sten@@ ch of this cur@@ sed sentence is up to this day in the nose .
&quot; he became a &quot; syndrome , &quot; a mental torture that I was subjected to months . &quot;
I crossed the yard .
in the first office I leave everything I wear with myself .
&quot; then again through the courtyard and into the second office , which leads through a cor@@ ridor to the individual cells . &quot;
I ad@@ here to all the details exactly before I enter the room .
&quot; unlike anything else , this time they have assigned me a larger cell . &quot;
&quot; I have to share them with only one single prisoner , and must put me immediately without waiting for their permission . &quot;
&quot; after a few minutes that felt like a whole life , the civil servant left the cell and I grab@@ bed an old @-@ tried communication method : beat the f@@ ist against the wall . &quot;
I learned that my cell @-@ gen@@ esis was a &quot; self @-@ help . &quot;
after long hes@@ itation he finally answered me .
&quot; apparently in any of the surrounding cells there was a prominent man of middle aged , who looks like me and called &quot; the doctor . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in perfect darkness , no distinctive facial features can be recognized , and doctors don &apos;t exist here ; we are all only numbers . &quot;
&quot; maybe someone , whose voice is similar to mine ? &quot;
all the answers link his existence .
perhaps he was moved into one of the big cells .
perhaps he will be inter@@ rog@@ ated immediately .
&quot; the investig@@ ator had assured me , they would release him if I remain . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; li@@ ar &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I would like to have had a scar@@ ec@@ row , to sell all these crow@@ s , which lab@@ oured on the fruit in the garden of my head . &quot;
&quot; from the distance , I still hear them &quot; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar . &quot; &quot;
&quot; it must be around 10 o &apos;clock in the evening , always at this time the scre@@ ams sound , every day . &quot;
the door opens .
&quot; I was always convinced that black is the colour of per@@ dition , until I saw the yellow light that showed us the horror in person : the Ra@@ ad ( for example : &quot; Don@@ ner , &quot; reference to the 13th S@@ ure of the Quran ) . &quot;
they are here to be heard .
&quot; thus the secret was lifted : in order to protect the state security from us and to prevent the betra@@ yal and the terrorists in us , they speak in the al@@ a@@ wi@@ tic dial@@ ect - so they played their con@@ fes@@ sions and betra@@ yed the close field of view of their world view . &quot;
&quot; this is not a house , here is no country ; it is a curse that they call co@@ existence to transform the crimin@@ als of their clan into a hero . &quot;
&quot; I cared for the audi@@ t@@ orium and tre@@ ad on Abu Ima@@ d , a slender and sto@@ cky man ; at least he seems to me so . &quot;
&quot; he starts a &quot; pleasant &quot; conversation , in spite of the facial expression that escap@@ es him : &quot; my boy , you are still young , you can start so much more important with your life than to join this diary and protest on demonstrations that will soon find an end . &quot;
I did not answer .
I am acc@@ u@@ stom@@ ed to answering .
I can really no longer tell exactly when ins@@ ults and pun@@ ches have become an ordinary communication tool for me .
when and how this happened was un@@ important .
&quot; some voice in me said that I had to get used to being punished , even though I had done nothing to make this penalty . &quot;
punishment in all its diversity .
his command is to plu@@ ck me as much flesh as possible from the body .
he calls this lov@@ ingly &quot; con@@ fession . &quot;
it starts with a plastic tube that probably comes from the clo@@ aks .
your exec@@ ution@@ er rejo@@ ices in your cri@@ es .
&quot; give him the pleasure , you cannot measure yourself with him , and you cannot hold your cry back . &quot;
&quot; my scre@@ ams were not yet enough , why they exchanged the tube through a cable . &quot;
&quot; during my first arrest , I asked if the investig@@ ator used to work as a gar@@ bage collector , or whether it belonged to normal working equipment . &quot;
&quot; they had inter@@ tw@@ ined four cables inter@@ tw@@ ined in order to present us the , from their point of view , great invention of a huge cable . &quot;
&quot; within a single hour three of them changed , while I was still in the row . &quot;
&quot; I had lost all feeling in my body - and my voice , which is why I stopped crying . &quot;
the hang@@ man noticed the cooling and didn &apos;t find any fav@@ ors because he picked up an electri@@ cally charged staff .
&quot; electricity penet@@ rated my whole body , enough to store my whole neighborhood . &quot;
&quot; my half @-@ naked body , stretched out on the floor , was the perfect conductor . &quot;
the num@@ b@@ ness disappeared and the pain was back again .
after two terrible hours he decided that he had fulfilled his duty for this night .
this must have been around midnight .
I decided to sleep again ; let &apos;s say that was my only option .
&quot; a few hours passed , which happened to me like minutes . &quot;
then the call to the morning prayer .
&quot; the door opens and the morning light fills the room &quot; .@@ R@@ aus with you , as@@ sh@@ fic@@ ker . &quot;
&quot; I answer with the voice of an exhausted you@@ ths , &quot; &quot; My Lord , my father has to be fear@@ ful . &quot;
&quot; be quiet and leave you , you will be laid . &quot;
this was new .
otherwise they always had left me free .
where do they lead me ? !
&quot; the Jord@@ anian R@@ apper Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ d@@ ai@@ b talks about the rights of LGB@@ T@@ Q + community , freedom of expression and resistance &quot;
Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ d@@ ai@@ b smo@@ kes a cigar@@ ette in his studio .
&quot; the photo was taken by A@@ man Mad@@ an , the original author of this text . &quot;
&quot; Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ d@@ ai@@ b sp@@ ends most of his time inside ; sometimes he sli@@ ps to his screen , time to his computer , back and again to his couch . &quot;
but what one can rely on is a cigar@@ ette between his fingers or his ni@@ cot@@ ine stain@@ ed lips .
&quot; he lives on the upper floor of his family house , which belonged to them since 1967 ; the year in which Israel had completed its occupation of the West Bank and forced H@@ d@@ ai@@ bs family to flee from their village in Palestine in which they lived as fel@@ ah@@ ye@@ en ( e.g. : farmers ) . &quot;
&quot; for six years , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b has been a passionate activ@@ ist who has opposed the conservative majority and questioned their well @-@ established opinions on gender roles , sexu@@ ality and freedom of expression through art and rap@@ es@@ eed . &quot;
&quot; with his music , which often deals with topics like ori@@ ental , rac@@ ism and the situation of Palestinian refugees , he also ur@@ ges the core of the entire Arab world . all these topics are not only relevant in his home town of Am@@ man but also in cities ranging from Damascus to Syria to San@@ aa in Yemen . &quot;
&quot; with his 25 years , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b sees himself as a person who is not restricted by limits in his thinking , and can feel according to his own statement with the people who suffer from the devast@@ ating consequences of foreign interventions in countries such as Iraq , Yemen , Syria and Libya . &quot;
&quot; even if he does not openly admit it , he will have a special inc@@ line against US foreign policy . &quot;
H@@ d@@ ai@@ b regards his art in his studio in Am@@ man .
recorded by the author .
&quot; H@@ d@@ ai@@ b does not believe that his compassion for those who are trying to survive in war zones , to do anything with his identity as &quot; Palestinian Ob@@ serv@@ itude of the second generation , &quot; he calls himself even though he was born in Jordan and has never been in Palestine . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t think because of my own circumstances , &quot; H@@ d@@ ai@@ b empha@@ sizes . &quot;
&quot; then he adds : &quot; I think so , because I am a human being , &quot; while he sol@@ ves in water N@@ esc@@ af@@ é into two cups . it is the holy month of Ram@@ ad@@ an . in this time it is intended for Muslims to fast from sunrise to sunset . &quot;
the Jord@@ anian law also states that the public consumption of food during Ram@@ ad@@ an is illegal .
&quot; obviously , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b has a certain weakness for breaking with ancient traditions ; on the other hand , a cup of coffee at a scor@@ ching hot young boy has little to do with protest against Islam . &quot;
&quot; basically , the pieces of lu@@ ke@@ warm coffee and the ra@@ kes of the K@@ ent @-@ cigar@@ ette in the nose primarily speak of freedom . &quot;
&quot; sometimes Jordan feels like a prison in the open sky , especially when you look into neighbouring countries . &quot;
&quot; therefore , it is easy to do basic things - as in the public during Ram@@ ad@@ an &apos;s water to drink - not to land in prison . &quot;
&quot; recently , Jord@@ ani@@ ens Interior Ministry has announced a performance of the band M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la , already for the second time . &quot;
&quot; some MPs who support the Islamic campaign of action - the Jord@@ anian branch of the Muslim Brotherhood - argued that the sexual orientation of the hom@@ os@@ exual fron@@ tend Ham@@ ed Sinn@@ o , contra@@ di@@ cts the cultural and traditional norms of the country , and the main reason for the concert announcement . &quot;
&quot; the MP and former press spokes@@ man of the Islamic coalition Dim@@ a Tah@@ bou@@ b said in an interview with CN@@ N , that the concert had just been cancelled due to the sexual orientation of the singer . &quot;
&quot; many also claim that the engagement of the band in matters such as the Arab Spring , Human Rights and freedom of expression in the Arab world is dangerous activ@@ ism , which question the old @-@ tried legitim@@ acy of author@@ it@@ arian regimes in the entire region . &quot;
&quot; in a public statement , M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la under@@ took the Jord@@ anian people as &quot; progressive supp@@ orter of human rights , &quot; which continued to use for intellectual and cultural pl@@ ur@@ alism . &quot;
&quot; this statement should probably not be simply sil@@ ky rhet@@ oric , but in fact an increasingly clear @-@ cryst@@ all@@ ising reality in Jordan , which clearly appears in H@@ d@@ ai@@ bs &apos;s work . &quot;
&quot; in 2016 , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b returned to Lei@@ be by wearing his vision from the fate of Arab women who have sex before . &quot;
&quot; the picture shows the skel@@ eton of an apparently drow@@ ned unknown woman , whose arms and legs stretch up to the corners of the canvas . &quot;
&quot; it is surrounded by a red lake , perhaps the blood of the countless women who have lost their lives by the hands of those they really should trust . &quot;
&quot; in Jordan , the number of &quot; &quot; hon@@ orary kill@@ ings &quot; &quot; has taken place in Jordan - the un@@ official outside . &quot;
&quot; according to Human Rights Watch , the number of volunteers reached its peak in 2016 ; however , it is still difficult to find that Jordan is missing the institutional infrastructure to support the women who attempted murder or domestic violence , to support appropriate ways . &quot;
&quot; according to a law on crime against crime from 1954 , women who are exposed to the danger of family @-@ friendly violence can be held in prison for an inde@@ fin@@ ite period of time , and for their release it is often necessary for years of bureaucratic expendi@@ tures and the guarantee by the family that the woman has nothing to do . &quot;
H@@ d@@ ai@@ b &apos;s music also enjoys great popularity and is well @-@ known for not shy away from issues that long lived as tab@@ u in his country .
&quot; H@@ d@@ ai@@ b den@@ ies that his work is politically , however , that he puts his music , which is full of explicit all@@ u@@ sions to sexu@@ ality , freedom and expression , not to separate politics . &quot;
&quot; I come from the Middle East , man . &quot;
&quot; I became in@@ timi@@ dating politics , &quot; &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; in a song called &quot; &quot; Edward Sa &apos;@@ ed , &quot; H@@ d@@ ai@@ b takes up the question of the Palestinian identity . &quot;
&quot; in &quot; Law@@ la al 3@@ ai@@ b &quot; and &quot; gh@@ are@@ eb , &quot; the focus is on poverty . &quot;
the list of the songs that are political in the core can be continued .
in March 2016 H@@ d@@ ai@@ b published a song entitled &quot; Sant@@ and@@ ano . &quot;
in this song a verse is repeated often :
&quot; you are free , and everyone else is it . &quot;
&quot; in the further course of the song H@@ d@@ ai@@ b describes the world as a kind of market on which , in his words , &quot; that can get what one wants &quot; - be it faith or non @-@ belief , hetero@@ genei@@ ty or homosexu@@ ality . &quot;
he not@@ ices that hardly anyone in Jordan talks about the rights of gay people and les@@ bi@@ ans and that comments on equality of LGB@@ T@@ Q + individuals have been strongly cens@@ ored until 2014 .
&quot; in 2014 , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b conducted an interview for the popular J@@ ord@@ an online program Ro@@ ya to remember that his comments had been torn , twi@@ sted and cens@@ ored in his opinion . &quot;
&quot; on Youtube it was uploaded without inc@@ is@@ ions , but was only a revised version , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; today , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b campaigns openly for the Arab LGB@@ T@@ Q + community and believes that intoler@@ ance to homosexu@@ als does not ent@@ ail Islam . &quot;
&quot; he men@@ tions Abu Nu@@ das , a poet of the eighth century , which is still remembered today thanks to his homo@@ erotic poems . &quot;
&quot; H@@ d@@ ai@@ b asks : if Abu Nu@@ das , who was later to work on behalf of the cali@@ ph , could write openly about homosexu@@ ality in the eighth century , why can Jordan not ? &quot;
&quot; the real problem , so H@@ d@@ ai@@ b , have nothing to do with M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos; Lei@@ la or the fact that the concert was cancelled . &quot;
&quot; in the h@@ ash@@ em@@ ite kingdom there is nothing new anymore that the government sanc@@ tioned attacks on freedom of expression , and that progressive votes will be sil@@ enced . &quot;
&quot; recently , in January 2017 , the Jord@@ anian Intelligence Service held several former members of government and members of the teacher association with the reason@@ ing that they had cri@@ tically expressed criticism in social media , which are cri@@ tically related to the problems rooted in the country . &quot;
&quot; in view of this , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b &apos;s opinion is only the tip of the ic@@ eberg - the real challenge is to bring about a structural re@@ thinking in the next generation of the Jord@@ an@@ ier . &quot;
&quot; for him , progress is a constant giving and taking . Jordan has denied M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la for the second time in a row , but the path of progress - so it sees H@@ d@@ ai@@ b - consists of slow , thou@@ ghtful and internal changes . &quot;
&quot; in the end , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b , like millions of other Arabs , dreams of an Arab world without interventions from abroad . &quot;
&quot; he does not only dream of bringing his work to Bag@@ h@@ dad , Jerusalem and Damascus , but also to &quot; experience them . &quot; &quot;
&quot; perhaps the region will bring about genuine and fundamental openness by means of music , art and literature - and not by bombs , streams and arti@@ fici@@ ally induced demo@@ cra@@ cies . at least he hopes that . &quot;
&quot; until it is ready , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b will move on and therefore also resist . &quot;

Neb@@ uta in A@@ om@@ ori is one of the three biggest festivals in Japan .
&quot; these large , extravag@@ ant war dolls are so fantastic ! ! ! &quot;
there are numerous theories regarding the origin of the Neb@@ uta festival .
&quot; it is assumed that it is a variant of the Tan@@ ab@@ ata festival , which is usually celebrated in many areas of T@@ oh@@ ok@@ us in August . another theory states that the tra@@ ilers , drums and dancing have been crossed over a thousand years and come from a time in which armies from the west mar@@ ched to the north east to force the indigenous inhabitants of the region , the Emis@@ hi , into the knees . &quot;
we are at the Neb@@ uta Festival in A@@ om@@ ori .
&quot; we were able to grab some great seats , so we have a great view . &quot;
one can only imagine how large these parts are ...
&quot; a joint centre in the capital , Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en , hosted a two @-@ month exhibition to W@@ a no Ak@@ ari . &quot;
I have been looking at the Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en for a long time : two fixed cars are just to be seen .
&quot; nevertheless , for many people who take the trip to A@@ om@@ ori , the Neb@@ uta Festival is the only true - and still a stunning way to spend the summer : &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Y@@ att@@ em@@ are ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
Y@@ att@@ em@@ are ! &quot; # Summer Festival in the north of the country .
I was there and watched the # Neb@@ ut@@ a@@ Festival .
the sight of a 18 @-@ metre @-@ high festival was incredible .

&quot; outer appearance and body care rarely were as important as in this story , because they help to keep the Peru@@ vian youth away from crime and promote a legitimate profession like that of the hair@@ dres@@ ser . &quot;
&quot; El Call@@ ao , Peru &apos;s most important port , is located on the coast of the Pacific Ocean , near the historic center of Lima - a region with a very high crime rate , where road rob@@ ber@@ y and illegal drug trade are everyday . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , Peru experiences - like many other Central and South American countries - an increasing demand for aesthetic services for men . &quot;
&quot; the trend , the appearance and thus also the unusual hair@@ styles of famous athletes such as Paolo Gu@@ err@@ ero ( Peru ) , Ar@@ tur@@ o Vi@@ dal ( Chile ) , Pedro Gall@@ ese ( Peru ) , or N@@ ey@@ mar ( Brazil ) , has led that more and more norm@@ als go into the experienced hands of hair@@ dres@@ sers that can recre@@ ate these elaborate hair@@ styles . &quot;
&quot; the unprecedented demand for hair@@ styles that go to the extreme limits of imagination and creativity , has even inspired an annual event , the competition of the hair@@ dres@@ sers &quot; Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os , &quot; which has been taking place since 2014 . &quot;
&quot; there experts compete against each other to show who can create the most centric looks , as can be seen in the following video ( more videos about current competitions are available on the public Facebook profile Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os ) . &quot;
&quot; educational institutions such as the Augu@@ sto Sal@@ az@@ ar Bon@@ dy school , located in El Call@@ ao , found here an opportunity to convince young people to exchange their weapons against hair@@ dressing tools , instead of receiving an education in hair@@ dressing art , which allows them to find work . &quot;
&quot; motivated by this activity and the possibilities offered have seen dozens of young people , that they can take a job , which is currently in fashion . &quot;
the school offered special training workshops before the school year before the school year and reported some of her achievements :
&quot; in 1995 we were the only school in the municipality and the district , which we are very proud of , because out of love for the children we have built this educational community . &quot;
Colombia : letter of Love to Gu@@ err@@ illa fighters

&quot; the following article is the edited version of the contribution &quot; &quot; Love messages to gu@@ err@@ illa fighters &quot; , &quot; published by the international online magazine Tea After T@@ wel@@ ve . &quot;
the contribution will be published here as part of a partnership with Global Vo@@ ices .
why do we write only love letters to people we know ?
&quot; is it not much more important to accommodate people , who feel exp@@ elled , aff@@ ection ? &quot;
this question was exactly the question of the two young Colom@@ bian activists Leonardo P@@ ár@@ ra@@ ga from the Bog@@ ot@@ Art Foundation and Cris@@ tian Pal@@ aci@@ os from the Young Youth Foundation and inspired her to write letters to the campaign Cart@@ as p@@ or la recon@@ cili@@ aci@@ ón ( letters to reconciliation ) .
&quot; first of all , their country was the scene of a historic event and they wanted to contribute to it : after years of negotiations , the Colom@@ bian government had concluded a peace treaty with the F@@ ARC gu@@ err@@ illa war ( German : revolutionary Ar@@ med Forces of Colombia ) , which forms the closing point of the longest armed conflict in Latin America . &quot;
&quot; internationally , the signing of the peace treaty was considered as significant that the Colom@@ bian President José Manuel San@@ tos received the Nobel Peace Prize for his services . &quot;
&quot; but before the Colom@@ bian people , there is still a long way to speak of real reconciliation and peace . &quot;
&quot; Gu@@ err@@ illa fighters , who lived in illegal camps for many years , were subjected to war rhet@@ oric and carrying out their weapons around the clock , must now be integrated into life as civilians . &quot;
&quot; the Colom@@ bian society in turn , who had become acc@@ u@@ stom@@ ed to life in constant fear and in some cases of deep hatred towards gu@@ err@@ illa fighters , must now take them into their ranks and support them in the construction of a new life . &quot;
Leonardo and Cris@@ tian were convinced that the young Colom@@ bi@@ ans would join together and help in the integration process .
and that &apos;s exactly what they did : until now thousands of young people have written letters - love messages to former gu@@ err@@ illa fighters to welcome them back in society .
&quot; the goal of the campaign is 69@@ 00 letters - one for every former gu@@ err@@ illa fighter , which should then be handed over personally . &quot;
Valent@@ ine &apos;s Day as inspiration for the campaign
&quot; the idea for the reconciliation was created at the world summit of Nobel Peace Lau@@ re@@ ates , which took place in Bog@@ ot@@ á in February 2017 . there , Leonardo and Cris@@ tian had the opportunity to talk briefly to K@@ ail@@ ash Sat@@ yar@@ thi , who was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014 . &quot;
&quot; this stated that we love the people who we love to write thousands of love letters on Valent@@ ine &apos;s Day , but those who need them much more need@@ ful . &quot;
&quot; he plans to share his love with people this year , who needed the most urgent response . &quot;
&quot; so the plan was to write letters full of hope and support for former fighters of the F@@ ARC , who now have to find their place in society and to build a new life . &quot; &quot; the letters will show that the Colom@@ bian society is ready to make the discourse of a war story to a common history of peace , &quot; &quot; they say . &quot;
&quot; until now , more than 2000 letters have been collected as part of the campaign . &quot;
&quot; the initiative is represented in all major cities of Colombia such as Cal@@ i , Man@@ iz@@ ales , Med@@ ell@@ ín , Bar@@ ran@@ qu@@ illa and Bog@@ ot@@ á . &quot;
&quot; I never thought that someone would forgive me &quot; &quot; &quot;
the first 500 letters were handed over to one of the UN camps in the Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca region on March 19 .
&quot; a group of 40 students at the University of Ja@@ veri@@ ana in Cal@@ i , two members of the Municip@@ ality of Cal@@ i and Leonardo from the Bog@@ ot@@ Art Foundation travelled to the camp to personally deliver the letters . &quot;
the members of the F@@ ARC were as they had done earlier to accept the orders of their leaders .
&quot; but this time they did not receive orders , but letters full of sub@@ tl@@ ety of people from all over the country . &quot;
&quot; it was a very moving moment for all involved . &quot; it &apos;s incredible how many different feelings one can walk through in just a few hours - from fear to happiness and everything in between , &quot; the politi@@ cian student Manu@@ ela Jim@@ é@@ ne@@ z A@@ vil@@ a told later . &quot;
&quot; Sandra Par@@ ra , an employee of the Gover@@ nor of the province of Valle del Cau@@ ca , described this unforgettable experience as follows : &quot;
&quot; after we handed over the letters , a former fighter brought me through the camp of the gu@@ err@@ illa fighters . &quot;
&quot; when I saw in one of the &quot; &quot; Cam@@ bu@@ ches &quot; &quot; ( a kind of hut in which the gu@@ err@@ illa fighters live ) I saw a gu@@ err@@ illa fighter who wrote something . &quot;
&quot; I was afraid to go down , because beside him on the bed a M@@ GL Gran@@ at@@ laun@@ cher , a deadly weapon in Sle@@ eping Beauty . &quot;
&quot; he said , &quot; &quot; Hello , what are they doing ? &quot; &quot; he answered , &quot; &quot; I answer a letter that someone has written to me . &quot;
it is a very nice and hop@@ eful letter .
&quot; never before in my life someone has written something so beautiful , so I answer it . &quot; I suddenly ran the tears of the che@@ eks . &quot;
I hu@@ g@@ ged him completely and sat down beside the gar@@ net .
&quot; perhaps he was tired of the war , it was sorry to be all the years of faithful companions of this fighter , and wanted to help him write this letter . &quot;
&quot; the man told me more about his life . he never expected anything else from life than war . to join the F@@ ARC was the only way to preserve him and his six brothers before the Hung@@ er@@ to@@ d . &quot; &quot; I never thought anyone would forgive me for my mistakes . &quot;
but now I know that there is a society there waiting for us with open arms .
&quot; until now , I have only learned how to deal with weapons . &quot;
&quot; but now where peace reig@@ ns , I can learn many things and work in dignity . &quot;
new voices
&quot; for the first time , students and some leaders of the F@@ ARC were invited to a discussion round . &quot;
the students were all grown up as already war and the F@@ ARC already acted in secret .
&quot; for this reason , the leaders of the F@@ ARC announced the history of the organization , their ide@@ als and gave insight into their views on the peace process : &quot; for many years , we have experienced how social injustice has worked on the whole Colom@@ bian people . &quot;
&quot; for a purpose of this magnitude , it is worthwhile to overcome all obstacles , &quot; &quot; said one of them . &quot;
Manu@@ ela was impressed :
&quot; to hear these people who have never had hearing before and had no choice , and to recognize that people that I have often seen as monsters and even hate people with beautiful feelings that were revers@@ ed by their circumstances and their environment was very painful for me . &quot;
&quot; the reality in which the country lives , hur@@ ts me . &quot;
&quot; but it comforts me that all people - including those who have killed and so much damage , can teach us something and give a smile and a hu@@ g . &quot;
many former fighters have responded to the letters .
&quot; Gust@@ av@@ o Gon@@ z@@ á@@ lez , commander of the camp in Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca , wrote for example Dar@@ ío de Jes@@ ú@@ s Mon@@ sal@@ ve , Arch@@ bishop of the town of Cal@@ i , following letter : &quot;
the Colom@@ bian was prophes@@ ied that after dis@@ arm@@ ing peace would reign .
but this is not the case .
&quot; as long as there is ine@@ quality , hunger and lack of education , health care and employment opportunities , there will always be people who are ready to resort to the weapons , to rise and protest for their rights . and that is also fully justified ( ... ) . &quot;
&quot; we of the F@@ ARC are now putting on peace , on a policy without weapons . &quot;
&quot; that is why we call all def@@ enders of peace - no matter what race , religion or ideology they belong - to rise above all those who dream of a country in war . &quot;
&quot; we give you our word , make our contribution and bring sacrifices because we know from our own experience that nothing is simple . those of us who defend life as the basis of existence will face many difficulties . &quot;
&quot; on our way there will be many obstacles , but together we will overcome them . &quot;

the translation of an article written by our partner Ai@@ da Mir@@ mak@@ hu@@ owa and its first publication on the OC Media website took place .
&quot; homosexu@@ als and qu@@ eer people living in the Cau@@ cas@@ us region are exposed to a wide range of dangers , including discrimination , physical and sexual violence and black@@ mail . &quot;
&quot; with horror , activists have witnessed the reporting of recent months about the persecution of gay men in Ch@@ echn@@ ya . &quot;
but the threat that hangs like a Dam@@ o@@ kl@@ es@@ wert above the local LGB@@ T@@ Q community has not only been created overnight .
&quot; OC Media had the opportunity to speak with a trans@@ sexual woman from Gros@@ ny , who shared some of her experiences with us and talked with us about what is currently happening in the republic . &quot;
&quot; the LGB@@ T@@ Q law in Ch@@ echn@@ ya has conquered the international head@@ lines several months ago , after reports have been published which dealt with the deport@@ ation , torture and murder of qu@@ eer men in the Republic . &quot;
the first report was published by the journalist Elena Mil@@ asch@@ ina in the Now@@ aya Gaz@@ eta ; she threw a light on the methods of Che@@ chen authorities who captured suspic@@ ious qu@@ eer men and put them into secret pris@@ ons in ar@@ gun .
&quot; you brought a monster to the world &quot;
&quot; Sabrina , a woman , was born in Gros@@ ny and grew up there . &quot;
since her childhood she felt that she was actually a woman .
&quot; when she was grown up , she became aware that Ch@@ echn@@ ya was not a safe place for her , so she moved to Moscow . &quot;
&quot; after a group of Ch@@ ech@@ ens had experienced by the gender equality of their land@@ lady , the hunt was opened on Sabrina . &quot;
&quot; from fear of her life , she moved to the United States . &quot;
Sabrina : I was an hon@@ orary assistant in a human rights organisation .
one day I told me that someone needed my help .
&quot; it was a friend of D@@ age@@ stan , a woman who was infected with difficulty . &quot;
&quot; she had no money , so I took her without hes@@ itation . &quot;
&quot; while I tried to help her , someone from whom I thought he would be a friend , a copy of my documents and spread it all over the internet , with my phone number and a picture of mine . &quot;
&quot; after that , the photos of my documents made the lap through the whole W@@ hat@@ s@@ App . &quot;
on 10 October 2015 I was attacked .
&quot; when I was watching a few shopping bags from the back@@ seat of my car , I heard a male voice say : &quot; here is a gift for you from your un@@ cle . &quot;
&quot; when I turned around , I felt something in my body , but I didn &apos;t hurt me . &quot;
&quot; then I heard a sentence , but this time on Ch@@ echn@@ ya : &quot; &quot; how long do you want to honour the family , du Sch@@ and@@ fle@@ ck ? &quot;
I didn &apos;t know the person .
&quot; I know only that it was a young man , not 30 years old . &quot;
then I lost the consciousness and wo@@ ke up again in the hospital .
apparently some women had taken everything along and started crying .
the man was fled .
the women had called an ambul@@ ance .
&quot; in the hospital , I learned that I had two wounds in my right wing . &quot;
&quot; OC Media : in which cas@@ ings were you laid - in which of the men , or those of women ? &quot;
&quot; Sabrina : my documents are out@@ dated , there is still my male name on it ; but the doctor understood and put me to the women . &quot;
I am very grateful for this .
&quot; when I read his name for the first time on his office , I was afraid to do it ; it was a Muslim , a Cau@@ c@@ asi@@ an name . &quot;
but he turned out to be a good man .
I am thank@@ ful to him that he was resp@@ ect@@ ful with me .
I spent more than one month in the hospital .
last February I got threats .
&quot; they called me , wrote me - relatives , stran@@ gers , some completely unknown . &quot;
this was the beginning of a night@@ mare .
my family was visited by neighbors and some distant relatives .
they demanded to send me back to Ch@@ echn@@ ya to prove that it was all a lie .
&quot; they reported absurd demands : some told me that I needed to prove it by going up without going through the streets ; others wanted me to appear on the official TV in Gros@@ ny and say that I didn &apos;t change my sex , that all was just bad speech , and Photos@@ hop . &quot;
I have a cup size C - what should I have to say on television ?
OC Media : how has your family tried to deal with this pressure ?
Sabrina : it is still hard for her .
some older people once talked to my mother on the street .
&quot; they said to her , &quot; &quot; You have brought a monster to the world not only your family , but the whole republic . &quot;
&quot; we cannot touch you because you are a pi@@ ous woman , but you must disappear from here . &quot;
&quot; my mother was too much , and she put a rope around his neck . &quot;
fortunately the neighbors came and saved them .
at that time I had to change the apartment several times a day .
&quot; I moved to an apartment and a few hours later , under the window a car was covered with dark@@ ened window pan@@ es and a plate with a 95 . &quot;
after it happened for the third time it became clear to me that something was la@@ zy .
my human rights friends checked the number plates - it turned out that I was persec@@ uted .
OC Media : how did you fly ?
Sabrina : with the help of activists .
&quot; for security reasons , I don &apos;t want to give up their names , but I want to say that I remember them all ; they really helped me . &quot;
&quot; with their help , I left the country , but then something incredible happened . &quot;
I can still not understand how it could be .
shortly before my departure from Moscow I bought a new SIM card to call my mother as soon as I arrived .
&quot; I bought them without regi@@ stering me , without notice , without anything . &quot;
I broke my old SIM card and threw it into the gar@@ bage .
arrived and checked into the hotel .
the number was registered to a stranger .
I put the SIM card into my mobile phone .
&quot; at the moment when I wanted to call my mother via W@@ hat@@ s@@ App , I got a message : &quot; you don &apos;t think you &apos;re in security , just because you left the country ? &quot;
our people know at what place you put in . they even know your room number .
only to prove it to you : it is the number 115 .
can you imagine that ? !
this was actually my room number .
OC Media : are you still in contact with your family ?
Sabrina : only with my mother and my sisters .
&quot; however , we do not talk about gender equality , this is a t@@ abo@@ o topic . &quot;
some traditional Cau@@ c@@ asi@@ an elements are still wearing in me .
&quot; as I wish , I can &apos;t overcome this spiritual barrier . &quot;
&quot; I always say that as long as my mother is alive , I will do my best to avoid injury . &quot;
&quot; when we chat with camera , I really try to see how the person looks at , which she rec@@ alls from her past - so to my male form . &quot;
but that is very difficult .
OC Media : do you know something about the current situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya ?
&quot; what do your friends , those who have stayed there ? &quot;
Sabrina : I submitted a report in Washington last week .
for him I needed up @-@ to @-@ date information on the situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
&quot; I spoke to someone , who has imprisoned one and a half months in ar@@ gun . &quot;
&quot; he told that no people were arrested and tor@@ tured during Ram@@ ad@@ an , but also that all the end of Ram@@ ad@@ an could hardly wait , and he did not lock a new wave . &quot;
&quot; most likely , they will now focus on family and relatives . &quot;
&quot; I mean , they probably invite the relatives who take care of the problem with the person concerned and at the end require proof that the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; honor &quot; &quot; has experienced through blood satisfaction . &quot;
OC Media : are also still gay men held in these secret pris@@ ons ?
&quot; Sabrina : a friend of mine says , there wouldn &apos;t be very many . &quot;
&quot; if , above all , those who have no wealthy relatives or who were abandoned by their relatives to face Kad@@ y@@ rows &apos;s court . &quot;
&quot; as far as I know , they are held there so that they can be presented as terrorists later . &quot;
&quot; say : if they are murdered , they will show their bodies on television and claim that they have attacked any village or a military base . &quot;
understand ?
&quot; as if these people were not simply disappeared , but specifically sub@@ merged in order to radic@@ alise themselves . &quot;
&quot; OC Media : is this now only a guess , or do you have a source for this information ? &quot;
Sabrina : I just quote someone who was imprisoned for one and a half months in ar@@ gun .
he says that many people in this prison disappeared after their be@@ ard had grown .
there was nothing new from them since then .
they just took them along .
&quot; and this so @-@ called Lord , this person was even there when these people were taken along . &quot;
&quot; until now they have not been presented as ban@@ dits , there have been no reports so far . however , we susp@@ ect that such actions are possible . &quot;
why else would it not have allowed these people to s@@ have ?
&quot; do you know if these persec@@ utions and ab@@ duc@@ tions of people belonging to a so @-@ called &quot; &quot; non @-@ traditional &quot; &quot; orientation have already occurred in the past ? &quot;
Sabrina : I always wore my hair long .
in Ch@@ echn@@ ya I had a Bob .
&quot; I think already before 2003 I was already known in quite big , when I still lived there - and I never had any problems . &quot;
in earn@@ est !
&quot; even from 1998 to 1999 , when the Sh@@ aria was applied , I never had any problems . &quot;
&quot; on the contrary , it was much safer than now . &quot;
&quot; Russia originally intended to introduce us to &quot; &quot; civil@@ isation &quot; , &quot; but ultimately threw us back into the Stone Age . &quot;
OC Media : how is this possible under Sh@@ aria law ?
&quot; Sabrina : my eyeb@@ rows were plu@@ cked ; I had colored eyelashes , bore tub@@ ular jeans and short tops . &quot;
the security ministry of Sh@@ aria has never bent me a hair .
&quot; in front of the Russian theatre in Gros@@ ny there was a place where every evening , especially at weekends , a whole group of people like me met . &quot;
&quot; it was a small place where several banks stood , and the whole city knew about it ; they knew why men , young people , met there . &quot;
we have never been offen@@ ded .
in the Che@@ chen language there is a saying : K@@ har@@ da ma K@@ har@@ da . that means : &quot; don &apos;t worry about the mis@@ fortune of another .
they often say to children when they make fun of the sick .
&quot; OC Media : so they just closed their eyes to you , because they believed they were sick ? &quot;
Sabrina : yeah .
&quot; they have never offen@@ ded me , never hun@@ ted and never beaten . &quot;
OC Media : how long did this grace period hold ?
Sabrina : so long until Kad@@ y@@ rov entered the plan .
&quot; when he was appointed Prime Minister in 2005 , he began talking about morality on television . &quot;
&quot; he did not talk about us per se , but primarily about the behaviour of women . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , one could sense how people began to change in the city . &quot;
&quot; he who had laugh@@ ed and laugh@@ ed before , looked at you at once with suspic@@ ion . &quot;
in time I left Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
&quot; but every time I came back home , I could feel how the situation in the republic was steadily worse . &quot;
OC Media : what activity do you follow now ?
Sabrina : I work as a wa@@ it@@ ress .
I don &apos;t earn much - 700 to 800 dollars a month in the USA .
&quot; apart from that , I am still active as an activ@@ ist . &quot;
&quot; at present , I am responsible for 15 Muslim women . &quot;
I communicate with them as a kind of psych@@ ologist .
&quot; we organize te@@ et@@ re@@ ffs , gather@@ ings , I accompany them to the hospital and help them get food cards . &quot;
I have no c@@ ents for it for a long time .
I discovered these people myself when I kl@@ ap@@ per@@ te influ@@ enc@@ ers .
I am Muslim and wants to help those who need help .
OC Media : do you wear a Hid@@ sch@@ ab ?
Sabrina : that &apos;s al@@ right .
this is the nature that has nothing to do with religion .
&quot; this is exactly the same as Ch@@ ech@@ ens , who want to prophes@@ y to you with foam before the mouth that there are no ow@@ ls with them . &quot;
&quot; the dents have which , the cab@@ ard@@ ines have which , the Russians also have which ; on the whole planet there is - but &quot; not in Ch@@ echn@@ ya . &quot; &quot;
&quot; I come from there , so it is unpleasant to hear something like that . &quot;
I meet so many men from the Cau@@ cas@@ us .
many of them - practicing Muslims who go to the mos@@ que and fast during Ram@@ ad@@ an - live together with men .
&quot; you know , many think about men who love men , and they believe that one changes his sex to make more intimate experiences . but this is a tru@@ ffle . &quot;
&quot; these are two different things - two different types of sensation to be exact , different attitudes . &quot;
&quot; for me , it is the most important thing to feel in my own skin and not ashamed of my body . &quot;
do not know if I have a partner or not .
&quot; sorry , I &apos;m going to be so personal here , but my last intimate relationship is now longer than a year ago . &quot;
and I am not sad at all - I just know that I am now myself .
local groups warn against an increase in suicide bom@@ b@@ ings within the im@@ pover@@ ished Arab Ah@@ w@@ azi community in Iran
the Iranian Ah@@ v@@ z region suff@@ ers from an un@@ usually high unemployment rate and poverty rate within the native Arab population .
&quot; since the past few months , there has been a strong increase in suicide . &quot;
the photo of the Arab workers in Iran was provided by the Patri@@ otic Arab Democratic Movement in Ah@@ v@@ z .
photo : use with permission .
&quot; the inc@@ iner@@ ation of a man named J@@ assi@@ m Mor@@ amaz@@ i on August 27 was the des@@ perate situation of the Arab Ah@@ w@@ azi community in Iran , which is characterized by poverty and unemployment , in the spotlight . &quot;
Mor@@ amaz@@ i was married and had a child ; he lived in Al @-@ Tha@@ w@@ ra in Ah@@ mad region in the southwest of Iran .
&quot; he suffered from anxiety , depression , and he was ashamed of his own hel@@ pl@@ ess@@ ness that can arise in@@ ability for his family , so Ah@@ mad human rights groups working in Ah@@ v@@ z and wish to remain anonymous . &quot;
a video shared on YouTube held the moments after he had lit himself .
&quot; some people quickly managed to extingu@@ ish the fl@@ ames , and Mor@@ amaz@@ i was brought into the Tal@@ eg@@ hani @-@ Hospital in Ah@@ wa@@ z . &quot;
&quot; according to local sources , the burns were so strong that the doctors could not do anything any more . &quot;
he died a short time later .
&quot; it was not the only suicide which occurred in August within the Arab Ah@@ w@@ azi minority , and activists on the ground warn that even more men could take life . &quot;
&quot; the Ah@@ w@@ azi Centre for Human Rights reported that some others - Ham@@ id Manifest@@ o , Ali Haz@@ b@@ awi , S@@ ayed Fal@@ ah M@@ ous@@ sa@@ wi and Sha@@ hab B@@ ani Tam@@ im . &quot;
&quot; their stories have one thing in common : they were all family patri@@ ots , who felt hel@@ pless and unable to feed their families and to pursue a safe work . &quot;
&quot; Arab Ah@@ w@@ azi suffer from poverty , unemployment and discrimination &quot;
&quot; the region , located in the majority of the Arab Ah@@ w@@ azi community living in Iran , was sha@@ ken by a profound economic crisis that makes it difficult for the native Arab population to deny their livel@@ ihood . &quot;
&quot; a century ago , the Arabic ancest@@ or was a predominantly autonomous region in Iran , until the P@@ ah@@ lav@@ i monarchy assumed power and made great efforts in 1925 to end ethnic autonomy throughout Iran . &quot;
&quot; in the Ah@@ ra@@ z region , there are some of the largest oil and gas fields occurring in Iran , as well as some of the most profitable and valuable useful areas for Iranian agriculture . &quot;
&quot; despite these valuable resources , the regional economy continues to develop slowly , and the local population only gets little of this wealth . &quot;
&quot; it is often victims of untreated diseases , hunger and de@@ priv@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; the Iranian regime systematically ref@@ uses the Ah@@ w@@ azi @-@ Arabs to systematically jobs in the local oil , gas and petro@@ chemical industries . &quot;
&quot; the government has also built a variety of dam@@ s , the waters of the Arab regions to the Persian areas , where the provinces are Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Y@@ az@@ d , Ker@@ man and G@@ ho@@ m . &quot;
&quot; these dam@@ s have only led to wor@@ sen the devast@@ ation caused in the region , and destroying local agriculture as well as the fish and palm industries . &quot;
the unemployment rate among the Arab A@@ haw@@ zi young people rose to 81 % .
&quot; N@@ our Mohammed P@@ ur , the Iranian general director for co @-@ oper@@ atives , work and social welfare , reported that 5 % of Ah@@ w@@ az@@ is who are looking for a job , completed 55 % a secondary school , and 45 % have a university degree . &quot;
a &quot; systematic strategy ... aimed at destroying the spirit of national resistance &quot;
&quot; Kar@@ im Do@@ hi@@ mi , an Iranian Ah@@ w@@ azi human rights activ@@ ist living in London , told Global Vo@@ ices that the present situation , a mixture of &quot; poverty , unemployment and rac@@ ist ethnic discrimination , &quot; leads to a &quot; high rise &quot; of the number of suicide among young Ah@@ w@@ azi men . &quot;
the reason for this is a combination of a high number of new ethnic Per@@ sians and an anti @-@ Arab discrimination in the recruitment process .
&quot; since function@@ aries and institutions prefer not to employ Arab workers , the local Arab Ah@@ w@@ azi is depri@@ ved of access to work opportunities in all sectors . &quot;
&quot; this is part of a systematic policy of the ruling regime , aimed at destroying the spirit of national resistance of young Arabs and to force them to earn their livel@@ ihood outside their home ancest@@ or . &quot;
&quot; there are people who had to change their name and sur@@ name to hide their affili@@ ation to the Ah@@ w@@ azi and to be hired as even Arabic names at the workplace are not toler@@ ated , let alone the speaking of Arabic language or wearing Arab clothes . &quot;
&quot; given the given circumstances that the Arab Ah@@ w@@ azi must bear , human rights activists beat alarm before the situation becomes explosive . &quot;
it remains to be seen whether the world is w@@ aking up and taking note of it .
the main reason for suicide is untreated depression .

the following article is a revised version of the opinion published by Ay@@ om@@ ide Zur@@ i and originally published on the Af@@ ro@@ f@@ é@@ min@@ as website .
you can read in the comments below the original text .
&quot; when I say that I am not a femin@@ ist , many women - especially white women , who call themselves as inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ists - with fru@@ stration . &quot;
they wonder why I am not part of the movement .
they even put well thought @-@ out scientific and social arguments in front of me why I should be femin@@ ist and why we should all be femin@@ ist in general .
&quot; for example , women still earn less money today despite the same education than men . &quot;
women are still under strict observation when it comes to what they are allowed to do with their bodies .
that violence against women is a global epide@@ mic .
&quot; or that cultural and social norms still ensure that women sooner or later come to a glass ceiling in various areas of life , and that discrimination based on gender is still attra@@ cting themselves across the many different countries and fai@@ ths . &quot;
all this is aware and known to me .
I am convinced and I suffer twice and thre@@ ef@@ old .
I am a black woman .
&quot; yet , when I come to speak on skin color , on rac@@ ism , on black women women , on black women in the LGB@@ TI@@ Q community or on black women from the Dias@@ por@@ a ; when I mention how we have always been ab@@ used physically , spirit@@ ually and verb@@ ally , both in and out of femin@@ ist movement , many white femin@@ ists let alone remain silent . &quot;
&quot; but all agree that women - all women - should come together to &quot; &quot; lift up their voices &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; K@@ umb@@ aya , my Lord &quot; &quot; to achieve equal rights ( some ) of women . &quot;
but they don &apos;t want to talk about sexu@@ alised violence in addition to an institution@@ alised form of rac@@ ist @-@ motivated violence that we are exposed to black women in a double way .
&quot; or , that black women and women of other ethnic and origin are less worthy than white men and women . &quot;
&quot; that black girls and girls with a migration background often referred to school as white girls , due to obvious integration problems . &quot;
&quot; or that women in black spheres and women with a migration background are exposed to a higher risk of suffering domestic violence and violence in partnership , as white women . &quot;
&quot; on the one hand , I want all women , all men and all men of any skin colour have the same rights ; on the other hand , I can not join a movement in whose center the white woman stands who ref@@ uses to take into account injus@@ tices in their thinking , which relate to both the sex and the skin colour of one person . &quot;
&quot; I am exhausted and won &apos;t fight for my affili@@ ation in a white @-@ femin@@ ist @-@ oriented sphere , which always rejected me and countless other black women forever and again . &quot;
&quot; in 18@@ 51 , So@@ jour@@ ner compl@@ ained , &quot; &quot; Am I no woman ? &quot; &quot; and I also refuse to uph@@ old an ideology in which the black woman in a historical sense is an ent@@ angled and margin@@ alized being . &quot;
&quot; I refuse to join group@@ ings , which also absorb our customs and customs by cultural appropri@@ ation to advance their eg@@ oc@@ entri@@ c programme . &quot;
&quot; I will no longer try to expose white women the importance of over@@ l@@ apping skin color and gender . for some of them will continue to silence the importance of black women for the femin@@ ist movement , no matter how many black women try to teach them an improvement . &quot;
&quot; although inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ism was founded to give women of different backgrounds a home and to distinguish themselves from white femin@@ ism , the word &quot; Femin@@ ism &quot; is still in its name . &quot;
&quot; I prefer to release myself fully and completely from femin@@ ism and to join the movement of w@@ om@@ an@@ ism , which was called for my dark skin and my status as a woman , which is so persistent that inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality is celebrated as a novel phenomenon . &quot;
now it is more important than ever that we define black women according to our own ideas and go into the spheres created by us for us .
&quot; Cl@@ en@@ ora Hudson @-@ We@@ alth , author of the book Afri@@ cana wom@@ anism : rec@@ laim@@ ing ourselves ( about : Africa @-@ W@@ om@@ an@@ ism : how we can defend ourselves ) by defining ourselves in our own way . and not only that - black women can also be wor@@ shipped by the cultural , spiritual , psychological , physical and even the spiritual elements that constitute the black woman . &quot;
&quot; although some white and inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ists will immediately call separ@@ atism and exclusion after reading these lines , I ask you to inform yourself of the hypo@@ cris@@ y and the contradictions of femin@@ ist movement that the black woman is concerned . &quot;
&quot; in a wom@@ an@@ istic environment , I can lift black women and women from other cultures , because in this paradig@@ m I exist . &quot;
I will be recognized as a part of this paradig@@ m because of my dark skin and because of my existence as a woman .
&quot; I , a black woman , can blo@@ om in an environment where my life neither b@@ lows nor ignored , nor rejected . &quot;
p@@ add@@ ling against pollution : the mission of a man to protect rivers in Iraq for future generations

Nab@@ il Mus@@ a travelled again and again in the past 7 years - mostly with sur@@ f@@ board or in can@@ oe - with a special concern in Kur@@ dist@@ an region in Iraq . his mission aims to make people aware of the importance of clean waters for present and future generations .
in this documentation of Emil@@ y Kin@@ sk@@ ey we follow Mus@@ a who explains to us his relationship with the rivers of the region and the impact of pollution on his church .
&quot; I absolutely wanted to do something for the river that we lost when I was still a child , &quot; &quot; says Mus@@ a . &quot;
&quot; scientists from all over the country fear that the decades of war , the construction of dam@@ s , pollution and un@@ controlled development , will lead to an immediate water crisis in Iraq . &quot;
&quot; Mus@@ a is a member of the NGO Water@@ ke@@ epers Iraq - a subsidiary of Water@@ man Alliance - who uses and works to protect the rivers , streams and water routes in Iraq as well as to support local communities in the sustainable use of these natural resources . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the video , Mus@@ a summar@@ ises the ur@@ gency and importance of his work in a question : &quot; if we had no water , how would we survive ? &quot;
&quot; this video was fil@@ med , fil@@ med and published for En@@ sia by Emil@@ y Kin@@ sk@@ ey , a documentary film@@ maker and multimedia journalist in Er@@ bil , Iraq . &quot;
&quot; the focus of her work is based on persec@@ uted , little resp@@ ectable sub@@ cultures and is characterized by the use of co@@ operating vide@@ ography and new multimedia techniques , with whose help supp@@ ressed communities , their stories can tell their way . &quot;

the following article is the short@@ ened and edited version of the article &quot; The Wave of Violence Against Women in Paraguay . &quot; the article belongs to the series # Por@@ Ser@@ Mu@@ j@@ er ( # wei@@ lich@@ ein@@ ef@@ rau@@ bin ) that reports on the wave of violence against women in Paraguay .
most names were changed to protect the persons affected .
&quot; a police commission@@ er said A@@ da B@@ á@@ ez , that she could undertake nothing against Luis Bal@@ bu@@ ena , her spouse , who had become violent against violence . &quot;
&quot; since the end of their relationship , some time has passed and the police said that their statement would be put to the acts , but more cannot be done . &quot;
&quot; as another woman Bal@@ bu@@ ena pointed out for mal@@ treatment , the adver@@ t ad of A@@ da B@@ á@@ ez did not use anything . &quot;
&quot; a few days later , the second woman returned her ad . &quot;
breaking the vi@@ cious circle of violence against women is difficult .
&quot; if women have an ad at all , they generally do not receive any support from the state . &quot;
&quot; in many cases , the women are also financi@@ ally dependent on the men who abuse it . this also explains why only 20 % of all women admit to be victims of violence , in general report themselves to the law enforcement authorities . &quot;
&quot; content 1 Stri@@ kes and Statisti@@ ken@@ 2 Un@@ seen Mis@@ sions and a legal system , which nothing sub@@ ni@@ mm@@ 3 Paragu@@ ays Law : good approach , fla@@ wed implementation hits and statistics &quot;
&quot; it is hard to determine how many women are really mi@@ stre@@ ated , says My@@ rian Gon@@ z@@ á@@ lez , researcher for gender issues at the Centro de Docum@@ ent@@ aci@@ ón y E@@ studios , a social science research institution in Paraguay . &quot; &quot; there are various statements and reports , which , however , not even approach the extent of gender @-@ specific violence against women in Paraguay , &quot; &quot; she explains . &quot;
&quot; however , the numbers available are alarm@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 , the District At@@ tor@@ ney General contacted 9@@ 600 ads for domestic violence , 70 % of which was about violence against women . &quot;
86 % of the indicators in the police came from women .
there were more than 5000 ads for domestic violence in the peace courts . 86 % of women &apos;s ads came here too .
&quot; in the advertisements , 40 % of women said that they were physically ab@@ used , 55 % of women spoke of mental abuse . &quot;
&quot; however , these statistics do not show the true extent of violence against women in Paraguay . &quot;
&quot; according to the Paragu@@ ay@@ an women &apos;s minister Ana Bai@@ ar@@ di , only a few of these crimes are actually indicated . &quot; &quot; on every woman who is ref@@ unded in Paraguay for mental abuse , 9 women who do not do so . &quot;
&quot; on every woman who ref@@ unded because of physical abuse , two women who do not do this , &quot; stated her at the end of 2014 . &quot;
&quot; since women &apos;s suicide in Paraguay is not an own criminal record , law enforcement agencies cannot properly document how many women are murdered every year from their current or former partners . &quot;
&quot; until August 2016 , journalists counted at least 12 cases of genocide in the country . &quot;
the Co@@ ordin@@ ator for Human Rights in Paraguay documented at least 37 cases where women were murdered by their current or former partners .
&quot; according to their estimates , in Paraguay , every ten days in Paraguay dies due to violence by men . &quot;

invisible mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ations and a legal system that takes nothing
&quot; before Mari@@ ana Br@@ í@@ te@@ z became the firm friend of Carlos Vera , he insi@@ sted that she named him the name of all her former friends . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning , she didn &apos;t want it , but then gave her . &quot;
&quot; today Mari@@ ana is 28 years old and no longer together with Carlos . but for two years she bore the psych@@ ic violence on his part - one of the most common forms of violence against women , and at the same time the most recogni@@ zable : &quot;
I never thought I would become victims of abuse .
&quot; when I read about it earlier , I always thought that only women are going to be sub@@ missive , because they let themselves be dec@@ eived by violent men . &quot;
I was convinced that this would never happen .
Mari@@ ana used social media to report about the abuse of Carlos Vera .
&quot; without name , she wrote articles on Facebook where she described his ins@@ ults and various attacks during her two @-@ year relationship and told how he had isolated her . &quot;
&quot; many people responded to their contributions , including Carlos himself . he asked rhet@@ or@@ ical if he ever lifted his hand against her and refused to admit that his behaviour was also a form of abuse . &quot;
other Facebook users asked Mari@@ ana why they had dropped so long from Carlos and didn &apos;t leave him earlier .
&quot; it seemed almost as if they wanted to say that victims of abuse were at least some complic@@ ity , at least . &quot;
&quot; Victoria San@@ tos , who did not come from Paraguay , fought almost eight years with the authorities in Paraguay to prove that their former partner mi@@ stre@@ ated them . &quot;
&quot; Victoria is a member of the Y@@ o te cre@@ o network ( &quot; I believe you &quot; ) , consisting of women , all of which are victims of abuse . &quot;
&quot; in the group , they can talk to others about their experiences , listen to each other and support each other . &quot;
they do what many others do not do : they take the statements of women seriously .
in Vict@@ orian case everything started with mental abuse .
&quot; her wealthy partner , eventually , managed to convince her that she was worth@@ less . &quot;
then he began to beat them .
&quot; Victoria A@@ ds with the authorities remained without a result and also from their relatives , they did not receive any support . &quot;
&quot; it led a process against its former partner , which developed into an unden@@ i@@ able legal struggle between Paraguay and its home country , in which it was mainly about money , power and the influence of its former partner . &quot;
&quot; Paragu@@ ays Law : good approach , fla@@ wed implementation &quot;
&quot; in Paraguay there are many laws that are very good , but are not applied . &quot;
&quot; the ad of abuse is a way of resist@@ ances and a fight against corruption in the judi@@ ci@@ ary , &quot; says Victoria San@@ tos . &quot;
&quot; Carmen Ech@@ au@@ ri , a representative of the UN Organisation for Women in Paraguay , also sees great problems in applying the laws in the country . &quot;
&quot; on 10 August 2016 , a bill was discussed in the Paragu@@ ay@@ an Parliament , known as # Por@@ osh@@ as ( # for you ) . &quot;
this h@@ ash@@ tag and the movement # Ni@@ Un@@ a@@ Men@@ os ( # Non @-@ One Wen@@ iger ) are part of a campaign on Twitter which is supported by Am@@ nesty International .
the original draft of the law fores@@ ees to explain Fem@@ izi@@ d to an independent criminal record and to pun@@ ish the har@@ sh@@ er as it is already in the neighbouring countries of Argentina and Bolivia .
&quot; in this way , the legislative text was changed in a number of points in order to also win the de@@ pu@@ ties for the law , which are likely to be paved the way for de@@ crimin@@ alisation of abor@@ tions that are currently prohibited in Paraguay and will be punished with up to five years imprisonment . &quot;
&quot; the original bill proposed , the majority of the ( bureaucratic and economic ) process costs , which must bear the victims of violence at the present time , if they simply allow an ad and would like to receive a secure housing to impose the state . &quot;
ech@@ oes ar@@ gues that the law is not effective if the legislat@@ ure does not provide sufficient funds for it :
&quot; in Paraguay , ill @-@ treatment is seen as part of inter@@ personal relations . &quot;
&quot; here , a re@@ thinking must take place so that violence is no longer regarded as something normal . &quot;
anyone who is silent in the face of these facts is complic@@ it and contributes to the fact that the perpetr@@ ators will escape .
we must allow such a long indication until ill @-@ treatment is no longer considered normal .
&quot; on 10 November 2016 , the law was adopted in the Paragu@@ ay@@ an Senate . previously , parts of the law had been altered . a passage was cancelled , among other things , a passage that the partners in cases called domestic violence to reconciliation . &quot;
the opinions about the changes go apart .
&quot; the section on reconciliation was seen as an opportunity for the aggres@@ sor , to attack his victim again . &quot;
&quot; the fil@@ ing of the words &quot; gender , &quot; &quot; political violence &quot; and &quot; sexual har@@ ass@@ ment &quot; from parts of the law , however , is regarded as a great back@@ lash . &quot;

independent media in Oman a year after the ban of a newspaper continues to attack
&quot; &quot; &quot; this website was closed on the basis of a resolution of the Minister of Information &quot; &quot; can be read on the website of the prohibited newspaper Az@@ am@@ n . &quot;
&quot; more than a year ago , the om@@ anic authorities have closed the independent Arab @-@ language newspaper Az@@ am@@ n for their coverage of corruption in the Sult@@ an . &quot;
&quot; You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j , one of the editors of the newspaper , continues to be in prison , where he served a one @-@ year prison sentence . &quot;
&quot; two other editors of Az@@ am@@ n , I@@ bra@@ him Al @-@ Ma@@ amar@@ i and Zah@@ er Al @-@ Abr@@ i , were also arrested and tried in court . &quot;
&quot; Oman has been ruled by Sult@@ an Q@@ ab@@ us i@@ bn S@@ aid since 1970 , who came to power after having depos@@ ited his father , S@@ aid i@@ bn Ta@@ im@@ ur , by a coup d &apos;@@ é@@ tat . &quot;
&quot; since then , he was cl@@ othed with his role as the only Sult@@ an , the most important offices in the country : Prime Minister , Minister of Defence , Supreme Commander of the Ar@@ med Forces , Finance Minister , Foreign Minister , Chairman of the Supreme Council for the planning and president of the Central Bank . &quot;
&quot; the Sult@@ an &apos;s rule is characterized by the persistent efforts of the security forces , in particular the domestic secret service , the public freedom , including freedom of the press , to restrict and det@@ ach human rights def@@ enders , independent journalists , blog@@ gers and other activists . &quot;
&quot; the authorities restrict peaceful and legitimate activities in human rights systematically and prevent citizens , even activists , to express their views on the country &apos;s public affairs such as corruption in authorities and institutions both online and offline . &quot;
&quot; the attack on the Az@@ am@@ n newspaper , its closure and imprisonment three of its editors last year is a hard blow to press freedom in the country . &quot;
Az@@ am@@ n is an independent paper published since its foundation in 2007 on corruption in Oman ( an absolute monarchy ) until it was banned by the authorities in August 2016 .
&quot; on 28 July 2016 , security forces I@@ bra@@ him Al @-@ Ma@@ amar@@ i , editor @-@ in @-@ chief of Az@@ am@@ n , arrested an article entitled &quot; High @-@ Level Parties to bind the hands of justice . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in the report , government officials were accused of having pressur@@ ized judges of the Supreme Court in Oman to raise a judgment in an inheritance dispute . &quot;
&quot; issue of the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n , July 26 , 2016 with a report on the cover page with the title : &quot; high @-@ ranking parties bind hands of justice . &quot; &quot;

&quot; on 3 August 2016 , Zah@@ er Al @-@ Abr@@ i , Member of the Editorial Board , was invited by the ISS to the Special Department and arrested on his arrival by the security forces . &quot;
&quot; on 9 August 2016 , the ISS took the deputy chief editor You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j , who had acted as Chief Editor after Al @-@ Ma@@ amar@@ is arrest . &quot;
&quot; the newspaper was closed at an inde@@ fin@@ ite time after the Minister of Information had given the statement that &quot; the publication and dis@@ sem@@ ination of the newspaper on any way , including online , from 9 August 2016 prohibited . &quot;
&quot; on 26 September 2016 , before the trial in Mas@@ k@@ at , the first trial took place in the trial against Al @-@ Ma@@ amar@@ i , Al @-@ Ha@@ j and Al @-@ Abr@@ i . &quot;
the Court sentenced the three journalists to prison sentences and ordered the final closure of the newspaper .
&quot; al @-@ Ma@@ amar@@ i and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were con@@ vic@@ ted , among other things , due to distur@@ b@@ ance of the public order , &quot; abuse of the Internet &quot; and &quot; under@@ mining the state of the state . &quot; &quot;
&quot; moreover , al @-@ Ha@@ j was found guilty of the violation of a publication ban and s@@ lander . &quot;
al @-@ Ma@@ amar@@ i and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were sentenced to three years imprisonment and fin@@ es of 3,000 om@@ bian ri@@ al ( 7@@ 800 US dollars ) . a one @-@ year professional ban against the two journalists was imposed .
al @-@ Abr@@ i was sentenced to a year prison and a fine of 1000 Ri@@ al ( 2600 USD ) after he was found guilty of the use of &quot; an information network for the dis@@ sem@@ ination of material that could pose a threat to public order . &quot;
&quot; for Al @-@ Abr@@ i , a deposit of 5000 om@@ anic Ri@@ al ( 13 000 US dollars ) was arrested and he was released from prison on 22 August 2016 . &quot;
&quot; the App@@ eals Court acqu@@ itted Al @-@ Abr@@ i at a hearing on 26 December 2016 , but Al @-@ Ha@@ j sentenced to six months in prison for a year and Al @-@ Ma@@ amar@@ i . &quot;
&quot; al @-@ Ma@@ amar@@ i was released on 10 April 2017 following his six months prison sentence from the central prison in Mas@@ k@@ at . al @-@ Ha@@ j is still in prison , where he served his years imprisonment . &quot;
the App@@ eals Court also raised the decision of the Ministry of Information to close the paper &quot; Az@@ am@@ n . &quot;
&quot; despite the decision of the court to leave Az@@ am@@ n , the newspaper still faces attacks by the om@@ anic government . &quot;
&quot; on January 8 , the Minister of Information issued an order with which the closing of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; was extended by three months . &quot;
&quot; on 8 May 2017 , the Minister of Information received another instruction in which the closing of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; was extended by three additional months , and the Minister ordered another complaint against the decision of the Court of App@@ eal to restore the publication of the newspaper . &quot;
the continuous closing of Az@@ am@@ n and the attacks on journalists from the newspapers are not the only cases where the press freedom has been viol@@ ated in Oman in recent times .
&quot; further injuries include the closure of the website of the independent magazine M@@ ow@@ atin and the exercise of pressure on Al@@ bal@@ ad , the first independent online newspaper of the country to stop its operation . &quot;
&quot; due to the ongoing closure of Az@@ am@@ n and the imprisonment of the journalist Al @-@ Ha@@ j , the impression that the om@@ anic authorities are still not ready to end the extensive violation of the press freedom . &quot;
&quot; the Gulf Centre for Human Rights ( Gulf Centre for Human Rights , G@@ CH@@ R ) ur@@ ges the Iranian authorities to : &quot;
1 . release You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j immediately and un@@ condition@@ ally ;
&quot; 2 . create a safe environment for the Az@@ am@@ n newspaper , so that their journalists can follow their work ; &quot;
3 . protecting the freedom of the press in the country and
&quot; 4 . in all circumstances , to ensure that human rights def@@ enders and journalists in Oman have un@@ hin@@ dered their legitimate human rights work and without fear of ret@@ ali@@ ation measures , including judicial chic@@ anes . &quot;
&quot; the Gulf Center for Human Rights ( Gulf Center for Human Rights , G@@ CH@@ R ) is an independent , non @-@ profit and non @-@ governmental organization , the human rights def@@ enders ( also independent journalists , blo@@ gger , lawyers , etc . ) in the Gulf region and in neighbouring countries by promoting the freedom of opinion and association and the right to gather peace peac@@ efully . &quot;

medical research in Africa : opportunities and mis@@ understand@@ ings
Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier 2016 in Zambia
medical research in Africa is rarely mentioned or not mentioned in the media . it is a growing area that addresses one of the most urgent needs of the continent .
&quot; there are two reasons for the need for medical research , there are two reasons : there are many medicines and vacc@@ ines that are missing in the offer of the global healthcare system that cover the specific medical need on the African continent . &quot;
&quot; diseases such as AIDS , tu@@ ber@@ cu@@ lo@@ sis and mal@@ aria have far more severe effects in the poor@@ est countries than elsewhere , and lack of investment for the study of these diseases by the pharmaceutical companies are a major problem . &quot;
&quot; secondly , research carried out by African scientists is helping to build their own research capacities in Africa . a major role in science and technology can only be con@@ du@@ ci@@ ve to the economic growth of the continent . &quot;
&quot; Dr. Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier is Director of the Centre for Inf@@ ectious Disease Research in Zambia ( Centre for Inf@@ ectious Disease Research in Zambia , CI@@ DR@@ Z ) . &quot;
&quot; in the 1990s he grew up in Lus@@ aka , Zambia , especially when the AIDS epide@@ mic showed the first serious impact on national health . &quot;
&quot; he left Zambia for studying in the United States , first in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , later in Indi@@ ana . &quot;
&quot; as a post@@ doc at the University of Pennsylvania , he conducted himself on the HIV virus before he decided to go back home to support the sam@@ b@@ ish health system . &quot;
&quot; with Global Vo@@ ices , Dr. War@@ rier discussed the future of medical research in Zambia and about mis@@ concep@@ tions of the media about this research . &quot;
( Disclaimer : Dr. War@@ rier talks as a private person ) .
global Vo@@ ices ( GV ) : what is your research topic ?
Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier RW : at the moment the focus of my work is on the application of research results . I support the sam@@ b@@ c national programme for anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy ( ART ) with laboratory tests .
&quot; in addition , I am currently star@@ ing a research program for the development of molecular diagnostic tests for HIV , TB and other relevant path@@ ogens . &quot;
GM : what do you think are the important current scientific topics in your country and in general in Africa ?
how do they differ from those in Western countries ?
RW : there is no basic research here . we only use solutions that have been developed elsewhere .
&quot; this must change , otherwise we will always be recei@@ vers instead of being mut@@ acher . &quot;
&quot; the solutions we get are often not suitable in our environment , and sometimes it is even impossible to use them here . &quot;
GM : where does the financing and support come from ?
is it sufficient ?
how easy or difficult is it to find suitable scientists for the projects ?
RW : from the USA and Europe .
the projects are being funded differently .
&quot; it is difficult to find people who want to come back or go here , because financing and development opportunities are better in other countries . &quot;
GV : what is the research infrastructure ?
what obstacles are there in your routine research work that you did not have before ?
&quot; RW : the basic infrastructure does not comply with the standards in developed countries . it costs a lot of money , a continuous supply of electricity , water and internet . &quot;
&quot; laboratory equipment is expensive , and it takes months to import it from other countries . &quot;
GM : what is the opinion of the public about science and scientists in Africa ?
&quot; RW : there is already interest , but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods . &quot;
I would suggest that critical thinking and scientific methods should be taught in schools to improve the situation .
&quot; GM : how big is your opinion the potential of scientific research in Africa , what should they concentrate , and how can we support the development ? &quot;
RW : the potential is amazing .
I have seen great students of all ages .
&quot; there is need for special scientific training , starting at any age . &quot;
&quot; social sciences , computer science , big data , research of space , health care ( non @-@ transfer@@ able and cont@@ ag@@ ious diseases ) and the efficiency of traditional medicine will benefit from this . &quot;
&quot; GM : can you describe the advantages and dis@@ advantages of life as a scientist in Africa across Western countries , based on your experience ? &quot;
&quot; RW : often it is the limited speed to do things , and the difficult access to scientific expertise , which presents challenges here . &quot;
&quot; the system , that magazines can only be made available for payment ( the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; Pay@@ wall &quot; &quot; ) , also limits the amount of available information and the speed of research . &quot;
from the USA to India : how &quot; Open Source &quot; seed producers change global food production
&quot; this post by Rachel C@@ ern@@ an@@ sky was originally published on En@@ si@@ a.com website , a magazine that reports about solutions for environmental problems worldwide . &quot;
Frank Mort@@ on has been breeding in the USA since the 1980s .
&quot; its company offers 114 varieties , such as Out@@ red@@ ress , the first plant that has been cultivated and consumed by NASA a@@ stron@@ au@@ ts in space . &quot;
&quot; for almost 20 years , Mort@@ on &apos;s work was limited only by its own imagination and the question of how many sal@@ aries he can get , limits set . &quot;
but at the beginning of the 2000 he noticed that more and more salads were patented and that he could not use them further for breeding .
&quot; the patents do not only apply to individual varieties , but also for certain properties such as resistance to diseases , a special red or green tone or cri@@ mp@@ ed leaves . &quot;
&quot; over the past few years , more and more patents have been applied to more and more plants such as grain or cart@@ el varieties . due to this trend , plant bre@@ eders , environ@@ ment@@ alists and experts ensure food security for the future of food production . &quot;
&quot; as a passionate representative of a mill@@ en@@ nia of old tradition Mort@@ on is still breeding salad , but it takes longer since his work is increasingly difficult . &quot;
it is as if in a river a b@@ oul@@ der is lying around that I have to d@@ ull .
&quot; so we have to do that now , but it is a break with the breeding tradition , &quot; he says . &quot; I think that these patents go too far . &quot;
&quot; and if they stand in court , no one can breed a new kind of salad , because all of the features are already patented . &quot;
&quot; however , he is very careful and endeav@@ our@@ ing to not use any material that is protected as intellectual property . &quot;
he also joined a movement that is getting bigger in the United States and everywhere in the world : open Source Bre@@ eding ( &quot; Open Source &quot; trains ) .

it is no coinci@@ dence that this name rather sounds as if the movement is from the IT area and not from the area of plant breeding .
&quot; the Open Source Se@@ ed Initiative ( Initiative for &quot; Open Source &quot; seed ) is inspired by the movement for free &quot; open source &quot; software , which provides alternatives to copy@@ ri@@ ghted software . &quot;
&quot; it was created to ensure that some plant species and genes are not protected as intellectual property , thus permanently usable for plant bre@@ eders . &quot;
&quot; as part of the initiative , called O@@ ss@@ i , the bre@@ eders can commit themselves to the fact that others can use the seeds bred by them freely . &quot;
&quot; however , this does not mean that they do not want to continue doing business with their seeds and sell it . &quot; open source &quot; bre@@ eders only allow others who buy seeds to breed it , and it will not be sold immediately - two aspects which are prohibited or prescribed by many plant pat@@ ents . &quot;
dozens of bre@@ eders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since their start in 2014 .
glo@@ omy outlook
&quot; for the Professor at the University of Wis@@ cons@@ in @-@ Madi@@ son and O@@ ss@@ i board member Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg , control over seeds and the possibility to breed new plants , both important for food security and environmental protection . &quot;
&quot; independent bre@@ eders would try to use the latter , or only little by breeding seeds with natural resistance . &quot;
Klo@@ pp@@ enburg stresses that the &quot; open source &quot; movement does not deal with gene@@ tically modified plants .
&quot; all types of plants could be patented , whether vegetables , grains , gene@@ tically modified or not , from ecological agriculture or not . &quot;
food sovereignty without food sovereignty is not possible . &quot;
&quot; the members of the Open Source Se@@ ed Initiative agree to keep their seeds available free of charge , as opposed to patented seeds and plant features . &quot;

&quot; O@@ ss@@ i supporters argue that the future of food supply is com@@ promised , because the available gene pool due to the increasingly numerous intellectual property rights on plant material , which is thus always available , is steadily shr@@ inking . &quot;
&quot; Cla@@ ire Lu@@ by , director of the O@@ ss@@ i , has engaged in her PhD thesis with genetic variation in car@@ rots and their availability . she found out that about a third of all cart@@ el features are protected as intellectual property , making it possible for plant bre@@ eders either at all or only difficult to use . &quot;
&quot; for other plants there are still no estimates , but experts like Lu@@ by susp@@ ect that mas@@ sen@@ ically grown plants like wheat are still patented as salad or car@@ rots . &quot;
a Ques@@ tion of Vis@@ ions
&quot; plants are bred in such a way that they have specifically desired characteristics - from those through which their taste or colour improves up to those , because they thri@@ ve in certain environments and withstand threats such as p@@ ests or diseases . &quot;
&quot; opponents of patents on plant properties indicate that the available plant material for bre@@ eders is decre@@ asing by ever more patents . genetic diversity is currently more necessary than ever , as the altered conditions are much worse predic@@ table due to climate change . &quot;
&quot; in an e @-@ mail , Mon@@ san@@ to spokes@@ person Car@@ ly Sc@@ ad@@ uto acknow@@ le@@ dges that genetic diversity is generally important and also crucial for Mon@@ san@@ to &apos;s activities . &quot;
&quot; however , it contra@@ di@@ cts that intellectual property offers other bre@@ eders as patents and the protection of plant varieties promote innovation . &quot; &quot; a patent is basically a plan that everyone can follow as soon as the patent has ex@@ pi@@ red . &quot;
often these instructions help others to come with another method for the same result .
&quot; such protection does not inhi@@ bit innovation , but encourages them by providing more material and expertise to the public . &quot;
&quot; Mort@@ on sees that in a different way : 20 years to wait until a patent exp@@ ended , there will certainly be no innovations . &quot;
&quot; and if you have to wait for so long to breed on plants that are adapted to the altered environmental conditions , you have already lost the battle . &quot;
&quot; however , the main argument for Mort@@ on is that genetic resources have always been a general good and it should remain : &quot; independent plant bre@@ eders have neither the time nor money for such form@@ alities , and monetary incen@@ tives are not attractive to us . &quot;
we want farmers to make their work easier .
&quot; this is what drives us , and it is impossible for us to continue using the best and newest genetic resources . &quot;
&quot; all in all , Mort@@ on interfer@@ es with the concept of patented plant features : &quot; we do not really create the characteristics themselves . &quot;
the plants form them themselves and as a bre@@ eder we have no idea how the plants do that .
a mystery of nature . &quot;
&quot; for Car@@ ol Dep@@ pe , Plant bre@@ eder in the US state Oregon and O@@ ss@@ i board member , there is another important aspect of plant breeding : &quot; whoever breeds a variety breeds his own values into them . &quot;
those who believe in industrial agriculture with great farms and mono@@ cultures are needed for their cultivation of mass @-@ wise her@@ b@@ ici@@ des that breed into its varieties of this concept of agriculture .
my concept is very opposite . &quot;
&quot; while some medium @-@ sized companies ( such as Mon@@ san@@ to ) have patents , they create most smaller seed companies , even without patents to survive - either they reject the experiment or they hold it for too expensive and therefore not re@@ warding or both are the case . &quot;
the independent plant bre@@ eder Frank Mort@@ on looks for Sal@@ ate in his breeding garden .
photo by Karen Mort@@ on .
&quot; in addition , Mort@@ on believes that bre@@ eders by avoiding plant patents are more innovative : &quot; it looks like I am with my efforts to produce new , stronger than businesses that patented . &quot;
&quot; I always need new material for my catalog , as I know that my competitors are selling my varieties within a few years , &quot; he says . &quot; with a patent you are protected for 20 years ahead of competition , which makes it very easy for my opinion . &quot; &quot;
&quot; although the US seems to be a leader in the &quot; Open Source &quot; breeding , the concept is now spreading rapidly around the world . &quot;
&quot; in India , the centre for sustainable agriculture ( &quot; Centre for Sustainable Agriculture &quot; ) , which describes itself as a professional organisation in the field of resources , is a &quot; open source &quot; seed program . &quot;
it also supports them to come to &quot; Open Source &quot; seeds and sell their own .
&quot; the German Organization Agre@@ col is working on an open source license , which is ultimately a formal and legally binding form of the O@@ ss@@ i obligation for bre@@ eders in the European Union . &quot;
( regulations for bre@@ eders differ from country to country because the O@@ ss@@ i obligation can not easily be adopted one to one in Europe or other parts of the world . )
&quot; at the beginning of November 2016 , the Executive Committee of the European Union , the European Commission , states that conven@@ tionally bred plants should not be patented . &quot;
&quot; however , an explanation is not a law ; now it is on the governments of the Member States to bring the patent office to implement this new line . &quot;
&quot; in October 2016 , the Dutch organization Hi@@ v@@ os organized a conference on &quot; Open Source &quot; seed systems in Ethiopia where farmers , operators of seed banks and representatives from all over East Africa gathered to learn about the &quot; Open Source &quot; seed movement and the worldwide trend towards the pat@@ enting of seeds . &quot;
&quot; Willy Dou@@ ma , responsible for Hi@@ v@@ os &apos; program for &quot; Open Source &quot; seed systems explains that the organization is currently building a worldwide alliance for &quot; Open Source &quot; seed systems , for which planned next year will be the official launch . &quot;
&quot; a merger of environmental protection and development aid groups ( including Hi@@ v@@ os , the international non @-@ profit development aid organisation US@@ C Canada and the action group on ero@@ sion , technology and concentration - Action Group on E@@ rosion , Technology and Con@@ centr@@ ation ) has compiled a database on seed and biodiversity around the world to publish the Se@@ ed Map Project , a seed map . &quot;
&quot; in September , the Global Alliance for the Future of Food , the global alliance for the future of food - a network of aid organisations such as the W@@ K Kel@@ log@@ g Foundation , the Mc@@ Knight Foundation and others - has published a report . &quot;
&quot; the report also empha@@ sizes the importance of a diverse , local supply of seeds for sustainable food systems - a connection from the Lu@@ by of O@@ ss@@ i hoping to see more people soon . &quot;
&quot; the exercise for regional and ecological foods has focused especially on where and how little is grown , and seed systems have hardly played a role , &quot; says Lu@@ by . &quot; we are now trying to make people clear that there is even more behind their food . &quot;

human rights organisation and blog are the latest cens@@ or@@ ship goals in Egypt
&quot; still , the Egyptian authorities still ban contents on the Internet . &quot;
this time it met the website of a human rights organisation and the blog of a colum@@ n@@ ist .
&quot; on the weekend of the 5th August , the Egyptian government locked the website of the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information ( AN@@ HR@@ I ) , which documents human rights violations in Egypt and the Arab world and reported above . &quot;
&quot; in August , the network published a statement on Facebook in which it sharp@@ ly critici@@ zed the Egyptian authorities for this step and promised to continue the work and efforts for human rights in the region . &quot;
&quot; the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information remains , in spite of this attack and the mo@@ cking of Egyptian law and the constitution by the authorities who are supposed to uph@@ old the freedom of expression and human rights in the Arab world , so it was never as important as it is now . AN@@ HR@@ I affir@@ ms that all technical possibilities are exhausted to overcome the blocking and not to give up . we ins@@ ist on fulfilling our task further . &quot;
&quot; AN@@ HR@@ I is regarded as the first cens@@ ored website of a human rights organisation in Egypt after the authorities blocked 21 websites more than two months ago , such as the independent news page M@@ ada Mas@@ r , Arabic @-@ language edition of the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post and Qatar @-@ based network of Al J@@ az@@ e@@ era due to alleged &quot; support of terrorism . &quot; &quot;
# Egypt : 1 . human rights organisation of the wave of website blocks to victims . @ an@@ hr@@ i one of the main data sources of human rights in Arabic language https : / / t.@@ co / NI@@ Z@@ m@@ Op@@ DS@@ 5@@ K
&quot; in addition to AN@@ HR@@ I , there is no access to the blog of the colum@@ n@@ ist and human rights researcher Ahmed Gam@@ al Zi@@ ada . &quot;
Zi@@ ada used his blog for the spreading of articles and articles which he writes for in Egypt not accessible websites and media .
&quot; now the blog , which he set up to b@@ ypass the cens@@ or@@ ship of the Egyptian government , even the aim of an attack . &quot;
&quot; blo@@ gger , who is home to also Canada &apos;s blog , is further accessible . &quot;
&quot; Zi@@ ada , a former photo journalist , spent nearly 500 days in captivity after he was arrested by Egyptian security forces in December 2013 , while he talked about the student protests and recorded a video , as police exercised physical violence against two students . &quot;
his articles revol@@ ve around politics and the human rights situation in Egypt .
&quot; in a Facebook comment , Zi@@ ada referred to the blocking of the government and reflected what this means for him : &quot;
&quot; to block blogs is very old , however , in the era of Ab@@ del@@ fat@@ tah al @-@ S@@ isi &apos;s priority , and even if the blocking of blogs may not be significant for the world , it is for two reasons for me : &quot;
&quot; 1 ) It has been able to give me the feeling of a siege , an arrest , a su@@ perf@@ lu@@ ous murder , un@@ loading at the National Security Council , the blocking blogs as well as any other website for which I worked . &quot;
&quot; 2 ) They proved that I did not write for nothing in vain . in other words , my words have influence , though only to a small audience . &quot;
I would like to mention that this blog was an archive for me .
first I used it to post articles to b@@ ypass the cens@@ or@@ ship .
&quot; but now , after they have blocked him and that they are afraid of words , I can still change the link or create a second blog . &quot;
the brave go the way to the end .
&quot; according to the Association for Freedom of Th@@ ought and Expression ( AF@@ TS ) , Egyptian authorities closed from May 24 to August 6 , 133 web sites . this resulted in technical tests on networks of various Internet Service Provi@@ ders ( ISP ) , including Orange , Vod@@ af@@ one and E@@ tis@@ al@@ at . &quot;
&quot; AF@@ TE also documented the locking of providers , by transferring dor@@ mit@@ ories and private surfing , so @-@ called Virtual Private Networks ( V@@ PN@@ s ) . &quot;
AF@@ TS reported in her research :
&quot; on Monday , June 12 , we noticed how the blocking of websites that V@@ PN@@ s offer , began . &quot;
such a practice indicates the government &apos;s intention to continue blocking and filter content that Egyptian users could access .
&quot; the situation will additionally be wor@@ sen@@ ed by the fact that the decision @-@ making decisions are made behind closed doors , whereby the Egyptian population has no legal basis by means of which they can proceed to court against these acts . &quot;
now the question arises : how far is the Egyptian government ready to go to cens@@ or@@ ship and who will attack it next ?
is Rio de Janeiro in war ?
the residents argue .

&quot; day after day newspapers in all Brazil report with dark head@@ lines from Rio de Janeiro , the second largest city in the country and home of numerous postcard motives . &quot;
some of these head@@ lines are as follows :
&quot; 14 @-@ year @-@ old killed in school , &quot; &quot; In Rio de Janeiro , a police officer killed in Rio de Janeiro , &quot; &quot; Di@@ ebe smo@@ other chem@@ ist with military weapons , &quot; &quot; President Tem@@ er sends 8@@ 500 soldiers from the army , nav@@ y and air force to Rio . &quot;
&quot; in the middle of the economic crisis and in a ten@@ se financial situation , the wave of violence in Rio reached the highest level for 10 years . &quot;
the Brazilian non @-@ governmental organization Global Justice even called the United Nations to interv@@ ene .
reports like these have become everyday and this is un@@ acceptable and # 8@@ 212 ; you will find at least the managers of a local newspaper .
&quot; in this way , the magazine &quot; Extra &quot; published the editorial reporting on violence in Rio on August 16 , &quot; That is not normal , &quot; in which she announced to set up a new section called &quot; &quot; War in Rio &quot; . &quot; &quot;
all reports on violence in the city are now published there .
the newspaper has explained the motives for their decision in such a way :
&quot; it will continue to report on crimes that happen in every major city in the world like murder , rob@@ ber@@ y , sexual crimes , etc . everything , however , devi@@ ates from the civili@@ zed standard and what happens only in Rio , will be published in the &quot; War in Rio &quot; section . ( ... ) This is our way of calling : this is not normal ! &quot;
this is the only alternative so that we as journalists do not close our eyes to cru@@ el@@ ty .
&quot; in a four @-@ minute video shared on Facebook , Oc@@ t@@ á@@ vio Gu@@ edes , editor @-@ in @-@ chief of the newspaper , stated that this decision was not a reason for pride , but rather a sign of failure : &quot;
it is probably the only newspaper all over the world with a war break in a country that does not recognize the war .
&quot; in the same video , a journalist from the newspaper explains that according to the Institute for Internal Security in Rio de Janeiro , there are 8@@ 43 territories controlled by criminal organisations . &quot;
&quot; in the editorial , the newspaper writes on : &quot;
&quot; we are aware that a war discourse , if it is dist@@ orted , can also be used to disgu@@ ise atro@@ cities of the police , who only im@@ position and then ask questions . &quot;
&quot; but we defend the war based on information and the fight against corruption in the police , whose goal is not the civilian population , but the economic power of the ma@@ fia and its partners . &quot;
is the term &quot; war &quot; more than it used ?
&quot; in an article on the news portal The Inter@@ cept Brasi@@ l , the journalist Cec@@ í@@ lia Oli@@ v@@ eira ar@@ gues that violence as a &quot; war &quot; is argu@@ ing . &quot;
this is not a war .
&quot; this is the result of corruption and poor planning - as an extra has shown in the analysis of military operations in Rio itself - in combination with insufficient investments in personnel , education and a historical and self @-@ compl@@ ying neg@@ lect of public service . &quot;
&quot; as a reminder , the state of Rio de Janeiro is larger than its capital . &quot;

&quot; Rio de Janeiro as &quot; &quot; the most violent place in Brazil &quot; , &quot; according to Cec@@ í@@ lia , is wrong : &quot; 22 of the 30 violent cities in Brazil are according to statistics from 2015 in the north and northeast of the country . these are the latest available data . &quot;
none of these cities are located in the state of Rio de Janeiro .
&quot; if we look at the Mor@@ dr@@ aten per federal state , Rio is in place 16 , &quot; she writes . &quot;
&quot; extra belongs to the company Glob@@ o , the largest media company of South America , which , as Cec@@ í@@ lia stresses , has been reiter@@ ating the state &apos;s security policy for years . &quot;
&quot; this security policy measures also included the establishment of the U@@ PP ( Uni@@ da@@ de de Pol@@ í@@ cia Paci@@ fic@@ ad@@ ora ) , a police unit set up by the state of Rio in 2003 , whose aim is to conquer a fav@@ ela by employing a massive police ban and permanently station@@ ed there . &quot;
&quot; in the beginning , this actually led to a decrease of violent deaths . for some years , however , the U@@ PP has become increasingly under bombar@@ d@@ ment after several reports on terror and repression against the poor communities , which should protect the newly created police unit . &quot;
&quot; on his Facebook page , the journalist Jo@@ ão Paulo Char@@ le@@ aux cited from one of his articles from the year 2010 in which he explains why the violence in Rio does not comply with the criteria set by the Geneva Convention - criteria for the term &quot; civil war . &quot; &quot;
he writes :
&quot; in addition to legal issues , the classification of the situation in Rio as a war also draws serious consequences for people . &quot;
&quot; this requires the state to use means and ways that are typical of a war . this includes penetration into the territory of a &quot; &quot; enemy &quot; , &quot; where a civilian is an un@@ shar@@ pen@@ ed point in the landscape and becomes an object of &quot; &quot; col@@ lateral damage &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; lost balls &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; war , or her , fact is that the inhabitants of the fav@@ el@@ as continue to suffer in Rio . &quot;
one week now it is time for the police to explain the mountain with the fav@@ ela Jac@@ are@@ zin@@ ho to av@@ enge the death of a polic@@ eman .
&quot; in the midst of all this violence , this incident also made head@@ lines : a fruit buyer died as a result of shots which the police had fired from a helicop@@ ter . &quot;

&quot; since the beginning of the Syrian revolution in 2011 and in the subsequent civil war , many Syrian cities suffer from brutal siege and block@@ ages , mainly through Assad &apos;s regime towards loyal troops . &quot;
&quot; according to vic@@ tories Watch , a joint initiative of the peace organisation PA@@ X and the research institute The Syria Institute , are currently in Damascus and Um@@ land , H@@ oms , Dei@@ r E@@ zz@@ or and Id@@ lib at present about one million Syri@@ ans in a state of siege . &quot;
&quot; the East G@@ hou@@ ta region , where an attack with chemical weapons on 21 August 2013 caused the lives of hundreds of civilians . &quot;
&quot; many governments , international organisations and the Syrian opposition assume , on the basis of investigations by the United Nations and other human rights organisations , that the massacre of Assad regime was perpet@@ u@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; since 2013 , these controlled areas have been controlled by rebels outside Damascus , which led people to be locally produced or ordered through tun@@ nels and control points . &quot;
&quot; through the years of block@@ ade , traditional foods such as meat have become un@@ reachable for large parts of the population . &quot;
&quot; as a counter@@ measure , a group of Syrian humanitarian hel@@ pers and acade@@ mics will teach the inhabitants of East G@@ hou@@ tas as they can plant their own fung@@ i as a &quot; food @-@ saving food source . &quot; &quot;
they call themselves G@@ hi@@ ras Al@@ nah@@ da and conduct the project together with the NGO Al Ad@@ ala .
&quot; fung@@ i do not belong to the traditional , planted foods in Syria and are rarely part of the Syrian cuisine . however , their food makes them an attractive food source for many residents of the besieg@@ ed East G@@ hou@@ ta . &quot;
&quot; the director of the project , Ab@@ o Nab@@ il , said over the French news agency AF@@ P : &quot;
&quot; we decided to cultivate mushrooms because they have a high nutritional value similar to meat , and because they can plant them in houses and cell@@ ars . &quot;
&quot; Dr. Ahmed Lei@@ la , one of the organizers , reports Global Vo@@ ices that has been struggling for three years to make this project known and expressed his relief that there is now more and more awareness . &quot;
&quot; in order to raise funds for the initiative , you can use the humanitarian crowd funding platform Can@@ Do in consultation with the NGO G@@ hi@@ ras Al@@ nah@@ da . &quot;
&quot; it is planned to give 125 families knowledge to plant@@ ing mushrooms , such as Dr. Lei@@ la to Global Vo@@ ices . &quot;
&quot; at the time of the Constitution of this article , they have reached more than 100 % of their expected target of around 12,@@ 700 € , but will continue to collect donations to Can@@ Do until Monday , September 04 , 2017 . &quot;
the initiative depends on generators that keep the temperature stable at 25 ° C and humidity at 80 % .
&quot; because of the fuel shortage , locally produced plastic fuels are used in plastic to supply the generators with the necessary energy . &quot;
&quot; Dr. Lei@@ la said Global Vo@@ ices that they began with &quot; &quot; production from the regions of the region &quot; &quot; before they checked out their quality and whether they are suitable for consumption . &quot;
&quot; afterwards they planted a small fung@@ al farm in a tub . when this succeeded , they used a larger tub . and so on . &quot;
now they have designed a &quot; educational farm for the region . &quot;
&quot; since the beginning of the project and after another 3 months , they have distributed mushrooms everywhere in East G@@ hou@@ ta . &quot;
Dr. Lei@@ la explained that it is part of a larger movement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we want to teach people the mushroom breeding for various reasons &quot; &quot; : fraction of siege . &quot;
provision of a new food source on the market .
&quot; dis@@ sem@@ ination of a culture of self @-@ suffici@@ ency by eating food resi@@ du@@ es ( such as paper , tea , coffee grounds , cart@@ on , etc ) for the extraction of new foods . &quot;
&quot; creation of new jobs , especially for women who work at home . &quot;
creating new jobs for people with disabilities who are tied to their homes .
&quot; he said , &quot; &quot; We hope to spread this idea around the world so that our success and our fight against hunger and siege will become visible . &quot;
we want our experience to inspire people in conflict areas and we can help humanity .

Portuguese demand justice for the victims of 2017
several hundred people prot@@ ested in many districts in Portugal on 21 October and demanded justice for the victims of the fires that took place in the north of Portugal in the week before .
forty @-@ two people died and about 70 injured in the forest fires of 15 and 16 October . this resulted in the government &apos;s last week of solidarity with the victims for 3 days .
&quot; fires were also registered in the Gal@@ icia region in Spain , where there were 4 dead . &quot;
&quot; it is estimated that there were more than 500 fire out@@ breaks , spread in the northern and central regions of the country and reached some 250 million hectares of forest and numerous villages . &quot;
&quot; in June , a similar tragedy occurred in Ped@@ r@@ ó@@ g@@ ão Grande , where there were 64 deaths and more than 200 injured . &quot;
&quot; according to the European forest surveillance system , which monitors the forest areas by satellite photos , about 500,000 hectares of forest are burned in Portugal alone in 2017 - an area of the size of the Lisbon district . &quot;
so that you can make a better picture of the gravity of the situation : there is no fire only in 4 districts .

numerous videos spread across the web and show images that allow better insights into the happ@@ enings :
the fores@@ ee@@ able tragedy
the aim of the protests of Saturday was the demand for better preventive and fire fighting measures by the state .
people wonder@@ ed why civil protection was not able to cur@@ b the extent of the tragedy as far as possible .
Jo@@ ão Sover@@ al from the Con@@ federation of farmers of Portugal declared the newspaper P@@ ú@@ b@@ lic@@ o :
&quot; after Ped@@ r@@ ó@@ g@@ ão , roads and villages were ev@@ acu@@ ated for everything and nothing . &quot;
&quot; this Sunday , they did not do it anywhere : there are dozens of open roads that were surrounded by fire . &quot;
&quot; in the forest of Lei@@ ria there would have been a similar tragedy , as in June , since the streets were locked very late . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , construction permits are questioned in locations with high fire risk . &quot;
&quot; a far @-@ reaching proposal for the wh@@ ale form , which the government had brought into serious fires in 2003 and 2005 , was filed by the municipalities who saw the new rules as an obstacle to investment . &quot;
&quot; the government introduced a loos@@ ening of the law , which allowed the construction activity of the case if the applicant had funds for self @-@ protection - that was an open back@@ door , so that everything could be built , &quot; &quot; leads Jo@@ ão Sor@@ val to the same article by the newspaper P@@ ú@@ b@@ lic@@ o . &quot;
&quot; the environmental organization Quer@@ cus pointed out that large areas with eu@@ calyp@@ tus , trees made of easily combus@@ tible wood , as in a vi@@ cious circle , still spread further after fires of this kind . &quot;
&quot; in addition to these problems , the website of the civil defence of Portugal on 15 and 16 October , when people sought information or tried to contact relatives , was offline . &quot;
it was a private initiative that provided the people with information : they used their own civil protection data using the f@@ og@@ os.@@ pt application and informed the population in real time about the location and spread of fires .
&quot; the project was launched in 2015 by the developer Jo@@ ão P@@ ina in order to simplify the work of fire bri@@ g@@ ade and became so crucial in this fat@@ eful weekend in October , that the servers did not withstand the ons@@ lau@@ ght of 400@@ ,000 users who followed the fires : the website counted more than half a million hits . &quot;

&quot; in one night in the autumn of 1994 , the conquest of Afghanistan began by the Taliban . &quot;
&quot; two years before , a terrible civil war broke out between the different Mu@@ j@@ ah@@ edi@@ n groups , who had defeated the short @-@ lived pro @-@ Soviet government . thus Afghanistan became a country of terror and despair . &quot;
&quot; at that time , A@@ shar@@ af Bar@@ ati , a 13 year old boy who belongs to the ethnic group of Haz@@ ara , sat in the G@@ haz@@ ni province in Central Afghanistan for the last time with his family during dinner . &quot;
&quot; even if his mother didn &apos;t say so well at that time , she knew she would no longer see her son anymore - maybe even more . &quot;
at dawn the boy should open up .
his un@@ cle would pick him up and bring him to the tu@@ gs .
the city of G@@ haz@@ ni in Afghanistan .

&quot; Ab@@ dul Ali Maz@@ ari , the leader of the He@@ z@@ b @-@ e @-@ Wah@@ dat , dominated by Haz@@ ara , had just been murdered by the Taliban and many Haz@@ ara suddenly felt safe . &quot;
&quot; the Taliban , known for their hatred of Haz@@ ara , came closer and closer . &quot;
many Haz@@ ara left the country towards Pakistan or Iran .
&quot; a few days after his flight , A@@ shar@@ af found himself in Pakistan . &quot;
for a few years he worked in a coal mine . the work was heavy and made him sick .
&quot; then he took what was left of his low wages , and went to Iran . once again , he was in a foreign country along with other refugees and drag@@ ged s@@ acks with mort@@ ars that were he@@ avier than he himself , to earn his livel@@ ihood . &quot;
&quot; back then , as today , the life of Afgh@@ an refugees in Iran was characterized by misery and exploitation . &quot;
&quot; it was really hard , &quot; &quot; A@@ shar@@ af rec@@ alled in an interview with Global Vo@@ ices . &quot; &quot; we ( Afgh@@ an refugees ) lived in an empty building on the building site , on which we also worked . &quot;
&quot; there was no service and no heating there . we hung n@@ ylon in front of the open windows , so that we didn &apos;t get frozen at night . &quot;
&quot; after four years , A@@ shar@@ af left his life without papers in Iran and made ready for the trip to Europe . &quot;
&quot; during the dangerous crossing on the sea , he suffered ship@@ w@@ reck and str@@ anded on a small , un@@ inhabited Greek island . &quot;
&quot; after the Greek authorities rejected his asylum application , A@@ shar@@ af came to Italy in 2002 . &quot;
&quot; some time ago A@@ shar@@ af was hom@@ eless , ran alone through the streets of Rome , slept in parks and went to a church distributed twice a day food to aid need@@ y . &quot;
&quot; it is true that Italy is a second chance for ex@@ pi@@ red asylum seek@@ ers due to relatively high surveillance rates , but it is also true that the conditions for asylum seek@@ ers in the country are dis@@ astro@@ us . &quot;
&quot; the human rights organisation Civil Liber@@ ties Union for Europe writes , the system &quot; suff@@ ers from a general lack of transparency . &quot;
&quot; the vast majority of asylum seek@@ ers will be accommod@@ ated in more than 3000 &quot; &quot; special reception centres &quot; . &quot; these are impro@@ vised institutions in the hands of un@@ qualified and un@@ prepared personnel . &quot;
&quot; according to Italian law , asylum seek@@ ers can only be allocated to a reception centre if they officially submitted an application for asylum - which can go for months after the registration of the asylum application . &quot;
&quot; until then , people who have no money for accommodation either rely on the hospitality of friends or have to sleep on the street . &quot;
so there was also A@@ shar@@ af .
but his fool@@ ish li@@ fest@@ yles helped A@@ shar@@ af to soon liber@@ ate themselves from these conditions .
&quot; after spending several years working in the construction industry for several years , A@@ shar@@ af put his entire savings into the establishment of a hostel in Venice . &quot;
this was so good that after a while he opened a second hostel and a fast @-@ lim@@ eter .
A@@ shar@@ af Bar@@ atis success story is now the theme of the documentary &quot; Beh@@ ind Venice Luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ( German : &quot; behind Venetian luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ) by director Am@@ in Wa@@ hi@@ di .
&quot; in 2017 , the Venice City Award was awarded for the 24th time in 2017 . &quot;

the conditions for entrepreneurs in Italy - especially for non @-@ Itali@@ ans - are very difficult .
&quot; much bureaucracy , high taxes and conditions for loans are just a few of the obstacles . &quot;
&quot; according to in@@ official estimates , approximately 20,000 Afgh@@ ans live in Italy . &quot;
&quot; for many of them , the country is a transi@@ tional solution on the way to other European countries . &quot;
&quot; in recent years some Afgh@@ ans have emerged , including tail@@ ors , travel agencies , hotels and restaurants . &quot;
some Afgh@@ an restaurants were even praised in the Italian press for their excellent cuisine .
&quot; in Venice , Ham@@ ed Ah@@ ma@@ di had the idea of his restaurant Orient Experience , where the wa@@ iters and kitchen staff are mostly refugees from different parts of the world . &quot;
&quot; the menu of the restaurant tells the story of her trip to Italy through the various Afgh@@ an , Iraqi , Turkish and Greek courts . &quot;
the Afgh@@ an entrepren@@ eur Ali Khan Q@@ al@@ and@@ ari opened the restaurant Peace &amp; amp ; Sp@@ ice and also behind the Pizzeria Kab@@ u@@ log@@ na in Bologna and a Sus@@ hi Restaurant in Rome are also in Afghanistan .
&quot; however , A@@ shar@@ a &apos;s goals are far beyond the Italian hospitality industry and retail , and aim back to the country that he forced to leave as a teen@@ ager . &quot;
&quot; where a risk is , there are also possibilities , &quot; says A@@ shar@@ af with a smile . &quot; I want to invest in Afghanistan . &quot;
I have never forgotten my country and I can &apos;t live happily if I know my people suffer .
&quot; I plan a project for farmers from the poor@@ est provinces of the country , especially for women . &quot;
they represent half of society and have to get the same possibilities as everyone else . &quot;
&quot; A@@ shar@@ af also for@@ ges plans for the opening of a factory in Kab@@ ul , where people can learn packaging and preser@@ v@@ ative techniques . &quot; thus they can sell their harv@@ esting surplus on the market and improve their financial situation , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; the development of the successful entrepren@@ eur was a journey through uncertainty and doubt , but at the end there is stability and prosperity . &quot;
A@@ shar@@ af has made this journey himself . now he wants to help other Afgh@@ ans on this path .
&quot; gross Report : alleg@@ ations from Egypt permit switching of social networks Mah@@ m@@ oud Abu Z@@ aid , aka Sha@@ w@@ kan , for more than 900 days in prison . &quot;
&quot; he reported on the clearing of the camp Rab@@ a &apos;@@ a el Ada@@ we@@ ya in Cairo , prot@@ ested against the dism@@ iss@@ al of President Mohamed Mor@@ si . &quot;

&quot; global Vo@@ ices Adv@@ oc@@ ac@@ ys Ne@@ tizen &apos;s Report is an international snap@@ shot , showing challenges , vic@@ tories and emerging trends in global Internet rights &quot;
&quot; the Egyptian parliament reviews a draft bill , which stipul@@ ates that users can use social media such as Twitter or Facebook just after regi@@ stering with a government authority . &quot;
&quot; users would have to register to use social networks within six months of the submission of the law on the authority &apos;s website , stating their full name and ID number . &quot;
anyone who missed this step could be sentenced to six months of imprisonment or sentenced to a sentence .
&quot; the law , which was promoted by sixty MPs , is currently facing the legislative and constitutional committee of the Parliament and is to be deb@@ ated there . &quot;
&quot; in May , another member of Parliament filed a legislative proposal to be introduced in the tough@@ er punishment for the accus@@ ation of the President or of a high official . &quot;
&quot; under the legislation , such action would be punished with prison and fin@@ es , as legal experts from Tah@@ rir Institute for Middle East Policy . &quot;
&quot; if the law is passed , this can mean up to three years in prison for the condemned . &quot;
&quot; in addition , this would under@@ pin a political climate in which the right to freedom of expression and freedom of assembly already has been in danger for many years . &quot;
&quot; a striking example is the case of Mah@@ m@@ oud Ab@@ o Z@@ ID ( known as Sha@@ w@@ kan ) who was arrested on 13 August 2013 when he took photos of Egyptian polic@@ emen , demonstrating violence against demonstr@@ ators who had fought against the military coup that led to the am@@ nesty of the elected president Mohammed Mor@@ si . &quot;
&quot; Sha@@ w@@ kan waited , as more than 700 prot@@ esters arrested in the same incident , four years in prison on a date of trial . &quot;
&quot; recently , his trial was postpon@@ ed on May 20 , because the prison line , according to human rights groups , failed to bring the def@@ endants from prison to the cour@@ tro@@ om . &quot;
&quot; Sha@@ w@@ kan threat@@ ens the death penalty due to one , so many human rights groups agree , false burden of such as weapons possession , illegal gathering , murder and murder . &quot;
&quot; in another case , a Criminal Court in G@@ iza issued two journalists H@@ any Sal@@ ah @-@ el @-@ De@@ en and Mos@@ ad Al @-@ Barb@@ ary . they were indic@@ ted for their reporting on the pro @-@ Mor@@ si seat block@@ ade on Rab@@ a &apos;@@ a Al @-@ Ada@@ wi@@ ya square in Cairo . &quot;
&quot; the Court also reduced the pen@@ alties of the journalists Abdul@@ lah al @-@ Fak@@ har@@ any , Sam@@ hi Must@@ afa and Mohamed al @-@ Ad@@ ly , who were also arrested in the previously mentioned incident , from 25 years to 5 years . &quot;
inter@@ rog@@ ating Tunis@@ ian activists for sk@@ ill@@ ful documents
&quot; Tunis@@ ian authorities spent six hours with the inter@@ rog@@ ation of Sam@@ i Ben G@@ har@@ bia , which co @-@ founder of the independent media platform Na@@ wa@@ at and the Global Vo@@ ices Adv@@ oc@@ acy project . &quot;
&quot; Ben G@@ har@@ bia has mainly been inter@@ rog@@ ated to a le@@ ased action plan . said plan comes from the President of the Republic , who expressly endor@@ ses a controversial bill of law , which would warran@@ t business@@ men and during the former regime by dict@@ ator Z@@ ine el @-@ Abi@@ dine Ben Ali of corruption , if they return all un@@ law@@ fully preserved funds . &quot;
&quot; the document published on the website of Na@@ wa@@ at on April 21 , th@@ rows light on how the presidential plans for the support of the law@@ suit look like . &quot;
&quot; Ben G@@ har@@ kov rejected the nom@@ ination of his sources , indicating article 11 of the Tunis@@ ian press code , which journalists sec@@ ures the right to protect their sources . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , he joined the District Court in Tunis on 09 May as a witness . &quot;
does China want to force the users of social media to present their ID ?
&quot; according to new provisions of the National Council of People &apos;s Republic of China , the users of social media in China require permission before they write or share news in social media . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it is stated that the registration with the full real name will be required . &quot;
analysts believe that this elimin@@ ates the elimination of anonymous comment@@ aries in social networks . it is still un@@ clear how the authorities will apply these regulations .
&quot; in the social media , Chinese citizens have proposed to en@@ force these regulations only sel@@ ectively to protect citizens &apos; journ@@ alism and its independence . &quot;
do we see ourselves in &quot; We@@ Chat &quot; ?
not in Russia !
may the state cens@@ or@@ ship of Russia blocked access to the latest Chinese mess@@ aging app We@@ Chat .
&quot; according to Ros@@ kom@@ nad@@ z@@ or , We@@ Chat has failed to register as &quot; organis@@ er of the spread of information . &quot; &quot;
&quot; this designation is part of a law from 2014 , thanks to which the Russian Government imple@@ ments a list of online services that organize the publication of the information . &quot;
&quot; these websites currently include websites such as V@@ kontak@@ te and Od@@ no@@ stand@@ ni@@ ki ( Russia &apos;s two most popular social networks ) , the Image Board 2.@@ ch@@ .@@ h@@ k , the e @-@ mail service mail@@ .@@ ru and dozens of other services . &quot;
Turkish court has block Wiki@@ pedi@@ as
&quot; a Turkish court decre@@ ed Wiki@@ pedi@@ as in Turkey , after Wikipedia administrators refused to er@@ ase two English @-@ language articles , the data , Turkey support the ji@@ hadi@@ sts in Syria . &quot;
&quot; the Turkish Ministry of Transport , maritime affairs and communication had been blocked because it was &quot; &quot; a source of information , which collabor@@ ated with groups to address a political de@@ fam@@ ation campaign against Turkey . &quot;
&quot; it is the first time Turkey has completely blocked the website . it is thus , among other things , China , one of the few countries around the world where access to Wikipedia is not possible . &quot;
great Britain can not stop rolling around
&quot; following this week , the UK government is in the midst of a targeted consultation with regard to increased surveillance authorities that would force internet service providers to monitor communications in real time and install away programs that encryp@@ t data encryption . &quot;
&quot; the government has consul@@ ted telecommunications companies and intelligence services concerning the proposal , but has left other technology companies and civilian populations outside . &quot;
&quot; despite all this , consultation continues until the 19th of May . reactions and proposals by members of the public can be for@@ warded to the Ministry of Interior . &quot;
