<seg id="1">"although I had visited the US since 2012 at least once a year, I would live there for the first time."</seg>
<seg id="2">And that was very exciting for me.</seg>
<seg id="3">My love for America is extremely large.</seg>
<seg id="4">"as many of my generation I grew up with American movies, I danced to American music, read American authors and run his sport."</seg>
<seg id="5">"in fact, this country had such a profound effect on me that I became journalists mainly because of an American film journalist."</seg>
<seg id="6">"as a 14-year-old, I saw the great Denzel Washington, as he played the Gray Grantham in The Pelican letter, a fearless reporter who wanted to occupy the murderous conspiracy of an oil magnate with the help of Julia Roberts as a Jura student who wanted to occupy his interest."</seg>
<seg id="7">I was caught.</seg>
<seg id="8">"free after Method Man," I was as if that is the absolute truth, forget everything else, that's what I want to do with my life. "</seg>
<seg id="9">"and the year I lived in Arizona, my admiration for the USA had only intensified."</seg>
<seg id="10">"I always said:" America is the only country in which I have ever lived, whose diversity is so inviting that you can always be the one you are and it is easy acceptance in a community of like-minded people. "</seg>
<seg id="11">I even had written a very blackish love letter about his size.</seg>
<seg id="12">Then Donald Trump came.</seg>
<seg id="13">Much has been written about xenophobia and racism of this man.</seg>
<seg id="14">The most extraordinary aspect of his ascension is for me as he goes with his narrow-mindedness.</seg>
<seg id="15">"in his opinion, he never stops behind the mountain, as you say so beautifully."</seg>
<seg id="16">"he says exactly what he thinks like a former colleague, and openly declares his contempt for Muslims, Latinos, Afroamerers and women."</seg>
<seg id="17">"nevertheless, the people responded to his statements and voted in pairs for him."</seg>
<seg id="18">"the 13 million votes he won in the Republican elections, was the highest number, which was ever reached by the nominee nominee."</seg>
<seg id="19">I was speechless.</seg>
<seg id="20">Who are the Americans who support this bigot person I asked myself?</seg>
<seg id="21">I could not reconcile Trump and his voters with the people I met during my time in Phoenix.</seg>
<seg id="22">"as for example my professor, Dr. Bill Silcock, director of the journalist programme, which takes people from around the world, a deep believer, with whom I could talk about Islam and its past."</seg>
<seg id="23">"also, Trumps Weltanschauung not agreed with the present editor of the" "Cincinnati Inquirer" "(Cincinnati Inquirer)."</seg>
<seg id="24">Bhatia and I met our common love for basketball and we spent many hours watching the "Phoenix Sun" at the game.</seg>
<seg id="25">"Trumps Intolerance is also in contrast to generosity I experienced with Sandy Bahr who fought for the environment for her life, and her husband Dave, my host family, who treated me as her son."</seg>
<seg id="26">She still fits to the engagement of Kristi Kappes who always helped me with a lot of patience and grace and my colleagues helped to get used to the complexity of American life.</seg>
<seg id="27">"then there were Andrew Büey, Kathryn McManus and Retha Hill, my mentors, whose wiser advice helped me a lot in my career."</seg>
<seg id="28">These people and the values embodied by them deepened my love to America.</seg>
<seg id="29">"while Trump drew his way to nominate Republican presidential candidates, they offered me a stop and the counterpart to his limited vision of America."</seg>
<seg id="30">"however, it turned out that they were the exception of the rule."</seg>
<seg id="31">"on November 8, 2016 more than 50 million Americans, mostly white, the presidency of a man, despite - or perhaps precisely because of his contempt against non-white people."</seg>
<seg id="32">"the confrontation with the idea that people voted for Trump because they either shared their racism and fanaticism, or because they were willing to overlook those things, almost broke my heart."</seg>
<seg id="33">Perhaps it is unfair to designate the Trump voters as Rassists.</seg>
<seg id="34">"to sort people, one of my friends said, is exactly what led us to this situation."</seg>
<seg id="35">This is superficial and disrespectful and indicates an inability to understand those who act and think in a different way.</seg>
<seg id="36">It shows people that their concerns and fears about the hectic changes in their communities are not taken into account.</seg>
<seg id="37">"could it be that these voters, most of whom are white, voted for Trump because they want to regain control over a country that has disappointed them?"</seg>
<seg id="38">"in other words, they might say they are still important in this America?"</seg>
<seg id="39">Maybe.</seg>
<seg id="40">"however, one can hardly forget the words of David Remnick, who commenting the cruel decision to lift a man who looks down with contempt for those who look different from him."</seg>
<seg id="41">"this" Whitelash "(m. Ü): as much as" "rebellion of the whites against all other ethnicities" "; word play from white in reference to the whites and whiplash, which means the great Van Jones, exactly what America has done so great."</seg>
<seg id="42">"millions of people around the world appreciate the American ideal - whether myth or reality, it is nevertheless a powerful idea - whatever belief or background you may have, America is welcome."</seg>
<seg id="43">"for this country chose as its president, twice the son of a Kenyan, whose history as he himself says, nowhere else in the world would be possible."</seg>
<seg id="44">"however, with the election Donald Trumps there is a huge part of the white America's promise and says: to hell with diversity, freedom of religion and the whole concept of pluralism."</seg>
<seg id="45">"in America after 9 / 11, the white man is again at the helm, they say."</seg>
<seg id="46">"I have to think of Khizr Khan, the father of a soldier who fell in Iraq and what he said on the eve of the election."</seg>
<seg id="47">"at a rally for Hillary Clinton, Mr. Khan had a word change with the crowd."</seg>
<seg id="48">"Donald Trump, would my son, Captain Humayun Kahn, have a place in your America?" "asked Mr. Khan."</seg>
<seg id="49">The crowd replied with a loud "no!"</seg>
<seg id="50">"would Muslims have a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="51">"" "no!" "the crowd cracked."</seg>
<seg id="52">Do Latinos have a place in your America?</seg>
<seg id="53">"no!" they answered.</seg>
<seg id="54">Do Afro Americans have a place in your America? "</seg>
<seg id="55">"no!" they cried, and their voices were louder. "</seg>
<seg id="56">"if anyone, who is not like you, would have a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="57">He received a unanimous and loud "NEIN"!</seg>
<seg id="58">"Mr. Khan concluded with the words:" "thank God, Mr. Trump, this is not your America." "36 hours later he was corrected."</seg>
<seg id="59">"the land, for which his son had fallen, sent him a message."</seg>
<seg id="60">"this is now Trumps Land, said the message."</seg>
<seg id="61">"and all the people that look like Mr. Khan, could not find a place in this new America."</seg>

<seg id="70">"the music played in both places not only changed the lives of the children, but also a very close connection with..."</seg>
<seg id="71">Music that lives with the waste</seg>
<seg id="72">"Vicente Guerrero is located on the edge of a large garbage dump, just 16 km south of Oaxaca & # 8212; an old colonial city that is very popular among tourists but worlds away from the nearby prehistoric ruins and its world-famous cuisine."</seg>
<seg id="73">"for some years now La banda de Música (music bande) has been playing in the congregation: a symphony orchestra consisting of children and adults, which has found a way to overcome the poverty surrounding them with their musical instruments."</seg>
<seg id="74">A music school with 100 students has become the central interest for the commune of Vicente Guerrero in Oaxaca.</seg>
<seg id="75">The British newspaper The Guardian wrote about this project:</seg>
<seg id="76">"the municipality, located in one of the poorest provinces of Mexico, is known for its drug abuse and the gangs-violence."</seg>
<seg id="77">"but this changed after a coincidental encounter with a French pilot, who launched a musical project and offered the youth a rare glimmer of hope."</seg>
<seg id="78">"the young band members take their commitments to the music group very seriously, writes local press Noticias Oaxaca NVI:"</seg>
<seg id="79">"as soon as they come from school, they run back home and immediately after lunch they run through the dusty streets to pursue their great passion."</seg>
<seg id="80">"you will always laugh and play with shiny eyes and play in the bustle you learn day for day trumpet, trombone, piccolo, clarinet, oboe, flute, woohorn, timpani, bongos and the conga."</seg>
<seg id="81">Music from garbage</seg>
<seg id="82">"more than 7,000 kilometres south of Vicente Guerrero play the children of Cateura - a village located practically at the top of the largest garbage dump of Asunción in Paraguays capital - on instruments made of recycled waste material:"</seg>
<seg id="83">"music with reproduced instruments, which consist of local solid waste materials, produced in a workshop for musical instruments in Cateura, where the Recycler began to turn parts of the waste into instruments."</seg>
<seg id="84">"the instruments imitate violins, violas, cellos, double basses, guitars, flutes, saxophones, trumpets, trombones and drums all made of trash."</seg>
<seg id="85">"the repertoire includes classical music, folk music, Paraguayan and Latin American music as well as music of the Beatles, by Frank Sinatra etc."</seg>
<seg id="86">"in an article in the Los Angeles Times, Favio Chávez, a local economist and musician of the children of Cateura, recalls the initial time:"</seg>
<seg id="87">"first, it was very difficult because we had no place to rehearse and we had to teach at the same place where the parents did not know music and it was very difficult to contact parents because many of them did not live together with their children."</seg>
<seg id="88">This changed as Favio something that he had never seen before: a violin made from rubbish.</seg>
<seg id="89">"today, there is an entire orchestra which plays on instruments from re-recorded material and called The Recycled Orchestra."</seg>
<seg id="90">A documentary called "Landfill Harmonic" (harmonic garbage dump) records the musical performance:</seg>
<seg id="91">The world generates about one billion tons of waste every year.</seg>
<seg id="92">"those who live with him and of him are the poorest - as humans in Cateura, Paraguay."</seg>
<seg id="93">And here they turn it into something beautiful.</seg>

<seg id="96">These East African countries demonstrate how technology and teamwork can successfully combat illegal fishing.</seg>
<seg id="97">Photo © FISH-i Africa - a project that combats wild illegal fishing.</seg>
<seg id="98">"this post, written by Emma Bryce, was originally published at Ensia.com, a magazine that reports specifically about international, practiced solutions for environmental problems."</seg>
<seg id="99">The republication takes place within the framework of an agreement with Global Voices for sharing content.</seg>
<seg id="100">"in West Africa, at that time, it was known that this ship had already operated illegal fishing in liberians before it was seeking Africa's other coast."</seg>
<seg id="101">The East African countries were drawn up accordingly and slightly inclined to welcome a criminal offish of this type on their shores.</seg>
<seg id="102">"Kenya, Tanzania, Mauritius, the Comoros, Mozambique and the Seychelles are swiftly mobilized against the ship."</seg>
<seg id="103">"" "suddenly the prime minister was surrounded by countries who simply refused everything," "recalls Benedict Kiilu, a senior employee of the Kenyan Fisheries Authority. he is part of a team that discovered and persecuted the ship at its time."</seg>
<seg id="104">"in 2013, the ship was then driven out of the waters of the region: it was not able to catch fish there."</seg>
<seg id="105">"finally, it was also forced to pay 2 million US dollars to Liberia, because of pillage of the country's fish stocks."</seg>
<seg id="106">"the core of this initiative, which protects criminal practices and protects resources, was FISH-i Africa: a network of countries, 2012 founded by the NGO Stop Illegal Fishing (Illegal fishing)."</seg>
<seg id="107">"in addition to Somalia and Madagascar, the members of this network are the six countries, which at that time had driven the prime minister from their waters."</seg>
<seg id="108">"" "with this we have eight countries that are like and work together. they exchange information and are mutually exclusive where it comes to illegal fishing," "says Tony Long, head of the Pew Charitable Trust Project Ending Illegal Fishing. this project offers FISH-i technical support."</seg>
<seg id="109">"illegal fishing is unregulated by definition: what is caught is hidden, therefore it is extremely difficult to detect. thus, illegal fishing is a leading cause of overfishing of regions."</seg>
<seg id="110">"by the deliberate contempt of existing laws, by which certain habitats and species are to be protected, illegal fishing can harm ecosystems that have a delicate balance."</seg>
<seg id="111">"but while actions against illegal fishing were once impeded by bureaucratic hurdles, and even by the snail of information between individual countries, actions are now happening in real time, with traceable on FISH-i's digital communication platform."</seg>
<seg id="112">"for example, the individual countries can exchange lists of existing licenses, news about suspicious activities or details that were noticed or experienced during a port inspection."</seg>
<seg id="113">"fish-i pursues the activities of ships also very attentive if they move on the open sea, using satellite data."</seg>
<seg id="114">"this allows the authorities to mark ships that fish in prohibited areas. also, such suspicious routes can be discovered - such as those that suggest that a ship will load its captured fish on the road to other ships."</seg>
<seg id="115">"ideally, such investigations show whether the participating ships have a fishing license, where they were on the way and possibly whether they have a criminal."</seg>
<seg id="116">"on the basis of this information, countries that are opposed to illegal fishing may refuse to accept such vessels in their harbours. what does that mean that ships cannot sell their cargo. and that they may even be forced to pay penalties, as in the case of the prime minister."</seg>
<seg id="117">"" "it is about substantial financial losses to the owner, which means that illegal fishing is no longer worthwhile."</seg>
<seg id="118">"and that's what we want to achieve," "says Per Erik Bergh, senior director of nfd Africa. the latter is a adviser that supports the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also supports FISH-i."</seg>
<seg id="119">A closed front</seg>
<seg id="120">"the already mentioned platform was created to return an estimated 20 million USD to lost revenue, which will lose eight members of the HISH-i network every year because of the illegal fishers that penetrate into East African waters."</seg>
<seg id="121">"East Africa has one of the most productive tuna fisheries, where the region attracts commercial fishing from all over the world. among these also illegal fishing."</seg>
<seg id="122">"their practices include activities such as sailing under false flag, counterfeit license papers, indication of Phantasies, the fish protected species and the fish in nature reserves."</seg>
<seg id="123">"" "they specifically exploit the lack of international cooperation and take advantage of the weaknesses of a uninterrupted control system," "says Long." "earlier a ship could go fishing illegally and a country could then say" "You must not run my harbour." ""</seg>
<seg id="124">"but another country could say 'Come to me'." "and exactly this legal canophole tries to close FISH-i."</seg>
<seg id="125">"until now, the closed front works."</seg>
<seg id="126">"since its inception, FISH-i has participated in more than 30 studies of suspicious ships."</seg>
<seg id="127">It has revealed criminal networks that had distributed fake licenses in Tanzania. it discovered ships that used several fraudulent identities and it has tracked and found escaping ships.</seg>
<seg id="128">"due to its cooperation with INTERPOL, the international authority to combat crime, FISH-i can share and maintain information on illegal fishing over long distances."</seg>
<seg id="129">"" some of our investigations lead us quite far into the networks of organized crime, "says Bergh."</seg>
<seg id="130">He builds a system that will help FISH-i to locate suspicious ships more precisely.</seg>
<seg id="131">Photo courtesy of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="132">"fish-i's satellite system, which is constantly evolving, also helps to detect illegal vessels that like to hide."</seg>
<seg id="133">"" the illegal fishermen use very sophisticated techniques to hide their activities and their position. and that's what we are trying to cross, "" says Duncan Copeland, chief analyst at Trygg Mat tracking, an NGO that also deals with fisheries data and FISH-i technical support. "</seg>
<seg id="134">"some of the ships, for example, turn off their automatic identification systems, so that they can no longer be powered by satellite."</seg>
<seg id="135">"therefore, Copeland helps build a system that combines different levels of information. FISH-i will help to find criminally active ships with greater precision."</seg>
<seg id="136">A model program</seg>
<seg id="137">But FISH-i's team of African nations actually influence the unquestionably global problem of illegal fishing?</seg>
<seg id="138">"John Amos, President of the NRO SkyTruth, believes that."</seg>
<seg id="139">"recently, Oceana has opened the Global Fishing Watch platform together with Google and the Marine Protection Organisation Oceana: a platform that offers satellite data and can be displayed anywhere in the world using the position of each traceable ship worldwide."</seg>
<seg id="140">"" "together with the neighbours to get a better picture of who is doing - this simply makes sense," "he says." "here's a chance for countries to unite and bundle their resources to investigate."</seg>
<seg id="141">"we should do this on a global scale." "Pew Charitable Trusts have a similar project to run in which a global system permitting the persecution of ships."</seg>
<seg id="142">"there are indications that FISH-i's activities not only detach criminals, but also frighten them."</seg>
<seg id="143">"ships that have been fished earlier without a license and hardly expected to have consequences, now know that they are observed."</seg>
<seg id="144">"according to Kiilu, some of the countries involved in FISH-i have now recorded a 33% increase in fisheries sales since fishing boats have been buying more licenses since then."</seg>
<seg id="145">"after FISH-i Somalia had helped to detect Greko 1, the inspectors found on board towing nets whose use is prohibited."</seg>
<seg id="146">Photo courtesy of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="147">"other countries also notice these achievements." "the effect is so strong that other countries now also copy," "says Kiilu." "we are a study object." "in West Africa several hundred million dollars disappear every year by illegal fishing."</seg>
<seg id="148">"there have been six countries together in 2015, the so-called West Africa Task Force. also, they now fight illegal fishing, according to the same model as FISH-i." "With security, the aim of even more such initiatives and structures is to be created in other regions," "says Copeland."</seg>
<seg id="149">"recently FISH-i's youngest member country Somalia was able to report its first big triumph: in October, it represented Greko 1, a ship that was on the road under false flag."</seg>
<seg id="150">"the ship was also penetrated into forbidden waters that are reserved for fishermen from Somalia." "with taking measures against Greko 1, they set a strong sign that they fight against illegal fishing," "says Bergh."</seg>
<seg id="151">"for FISH-i this is another success of many. and at the same time the proof that such a special, collaborative approach to protecting the oceans is actually working in the entire oceans. Emma Bryce is a freelance journalist and lives in London. there she writes on the subject of environment, technology and nutrition."</seg>

<seg id="230">My father took me four times to La Perla with - all in 1976.</seg>
<seg id="231">At the first and last time he left me at the entrance in the car.</seg>
<seg id="232">"when he took me the second time, he ordered me to go out. he led me to a barracks, in the cars, furniture, television, fridges - just everything possible."</seg>
<seg id="233">Everything was stolen.</seg>
<seg id="234">"he gave me a small packet wrapped in a blanket and ordered me to wear it for a car. when I opened it, I saw that there was a big lump of silver in it."</seg>
<seg id="235">"on that day I went to the other end of the barracks, where the stolen items were shut down and kept me with a guard post."</seg>
<seg id="236">Suddenly he pointed to an open space and said:</seg>
<seg id="237">"then, the prisoners are tortured."</seg>
<seg id="238">"I spake in, and saw a couch where men were tortured."</seg>
<seg id="239">It looked like a field-bed and metal-feathers.</seg>
<seg id="240">Later I found out that they attached it to the end of a cable. the other end was attached to the body of the person who was captivated there.</seg>
<seg id="241">"they seldom grabbed a man with handcuffs on the bed, watered him with water and chased him a charge of 220 volts into the genitals."</seg>

<seg id="243">The stench there was horrific... like a dirty diaper.</seg>
<seg id="244">"years later, when my father was under house arrest, the same smell came out of his room."</seg>
<seg id="245">I realized the smell immediately and I became clear that this is the smell of a body in need.</seg>
<seg id="246">I could never forget this smell.</seg>
<seg id="247">"and I asked myself," "How is it possible for someone to do so much harm to another?"</seg>
<seg id="248">I knew that these people were killed '</seg>
<seg id="249">"when my father took me to work for the third time, he led me to the entrance of La Cuadra - the area where the prisoners were captivated with handcuffs."</seg>
<seg id="250">"he spoke to" Chubi "Lopez (Jose López, a civilian, who was also indicted in the trial) and I took the opportunity to take a look at La Cuadra."</seg>
<seg id="251">In the background I saw a number of mattresses on which naked people were lying down with the face - all were tied to hands and feet.</seg>
<seg id="252">Close to the entrance people kept quiet on the mattresses.</seg>
<seg id="253">"when my father noticed that I saw the prisoners, he said," "What do you guise so, asshole?"</seg>
<seg id="254">"I replied," "Why have you brought me here?" ""</seg>
<seg id="255">I knew that these people were killed.</seg>
<seg id="256">They were thrown into a pit and killed and buried by soldiers.</seg>
<seg id="257">I know that because my father told me at home.</seg>
<seg id="258">"in addition to La Cuadra, some rooms were designated as offices."</seg>
<seg id="259">I know that "Palito" Romero hit a man there and killed.</seg>
<seg id="260">"according to the survivors of the civil war Jorge Romero, who was also indicted in the La Perla Ribera trial, was indicted by Raúl Mateo Molina."</seg>

<seg id="262">The way you came in here is also the way on which the kidnapping came here.</seg>
<seg id="263">"when you look at the map, you see that they took about this journey and then were tortured for the first time."</seg>
<seg id="264">Here their names were changed and they were assigned a number as part of the process of dehumanisation.</seg>
<seg id="265">"when they survived the torture, the prisoners were thrown into the cuadra until the arrangement from above came that they should be relocated."</seg>
<seg id="266">This was the lie - the euphemism - for the shooting of men and the disappearance of their bodies in most cases.</seg>
<seg id="267">The 'War yield'</seg>
<seg id="268">My father brought all sorts of stolen things home.</seg>
<seg id="269">"at that time in old age I had no idea what the" "war yield" "- as they called it - was."</seg>
<seg id="270">"but when I was in the military later, - I was in the gendarmerie - it became clear to me that war yield was a bayonet or perhaps military signs that one has fought to an enemy that one has fought."</seg>

<seg id="275">"I have always wondered how my father, the leader of the security forces, could join this vandalism."</seg>
<seg id="276">I simply don't understand it.</seg>
<seg id="277">I was also an officer in gendarmerie and I would never like to enter into a house and steal everything in it.</seg>
<seg id="278">I don't understand how my father could do that.</seg>
<seg id="279">"once he called me a criminal, and I answered: and thou, who steadeth cars on the road?"</seg>
<seg id="280">You are not a criminal?</seg>
<seg id="281">"he exploded with anger, struck me and cried:"</seg>
<seg id="282">"if you go so far, then I will find you and kill yourself."</seg>
<seg id="283">We need no one else to do this!</seg>
<seg id="284">So my father was.</seg>

<seg id="286">"when I said in the process, I showed a photo of then on which I wore a jacket and a roll sweater made of wool. both had my father from La Perla."</seg>
<seg id="287">"we were not poor, but he nevertheless brought clothes to home."</seg>
<seg id="288">"at that time, the defense was accustomed to being a conjurer in this crime. I replied, no problem, they can lay the burden on what they wanted."</seg>
<seg id="289">I was there anyway to testify.</seg>

<seg id="295">"well, so you executed people in the dictatorship of the dictatorship."</seg>
<seg id="296">Why kidnapped children?</seg>
<seg id="297">"one day my father brought a girl home, whose mother was killed."</seg>
<seg id="298">"she was like our pet, almost like a dog - just that this was a little girl."</seg>
<seg id="299">"I always asked the question: they were tortured, but why were they killed?"</seg>
<seg id="300">It would have been possible to put them into prison.</seg>
<seg id="301">"I guess it was simply decided to kill these people, but why their bodies disappear?"</seg>
<seg id="302">Did these people not even have families that could be handed over to their mortal remnants?</seg>
<seg id="303">The disappearance of the body is the last abominous act that one can do to a man.</seg>
<seg id="304">"my father told me when democracy was reintroduced, they took machines to eliminate the mortal remnants of the prisoners."</seg>

<seg id="307">I have seen how you killed people! '</seg>
<seg id="308">Only to clarify it: I have nothing against the military.</seg>
<seg id="309">I was even with the gendarmerie.</seg>
<seg id="310">I just said the truth about 20 criminals - including my father.</seg>
<seg id="311">"the thought to display my father was during a conversation, when he stood under house arrest."</seg>
<seg id="312">I made him allegations because of all the atrocities I had to experience.</seg>
<seg id="313">"then he said suddenly," "I don't know. I didn't kill anyone."</seg>
<seg id="314">"I felt inwardly rejected and asked me what the whole exaggerated patriotism and the" Western and Christian feelings, "which they supposedly defended, were actually good."</seg>

<seg id="348">"on a shield the Japanese word of the" "older autobiker", "the" "older autobiker" "means wrongly - perhaps but also with vicious hind-thoughts & # 8212; translated as" "fearful motorists". ""</seg>
<seg id="349">The wrong translation was to be read on electronic ads in the entrance area and in the building itself from September 1st to 20th.</seg>
<seg id="350">"editing of the original photos by Joshua Levine, which was often shared in the social media."</seg>
<seg id="351">"the mistake was Julian Holmes, a citizen of Kyotos, who made it aware of the local newspapers."</seg>
<seg id="352">The Kyoto Shimbun daily newspaper published in Kyoto writes:</seg>
<seg id="353">"" "how could it come to such an English translation?"</seg>
<seg id="354">This proves that no one has read the translation correction.</seg>
<seg id="355">"this is an insult to older people and in an international city like Kyoto is simply unacceptable," "said Holmes."</seg>
<seg id="356">"the erroneous English translation was first removed. the name" "terrible drivers" "was later replaced by the more appropriate, even grammatically the correct name" elder drivers "(German:" older drivers ")."</seg>
<seg id="357">"the Kyoto Protocol apologized for the translation errors. furthermore, it explained that the error was already contained in the text that they had received from the translator and that the translation was not checked for correctness before it was published."</seg>
<seg id="358">A blogger reported as follows:</seg>
<seg id="359">"we sincerely regret that older people felt offended by the inadequate correction (translation) on our part," "said the police."</seg>
<seg id="360">The Japanese online news service J-Cast News got a bit more detailed with the phenomenon of the "terrible" elderly drivers in Japan and wrote:</seg>
<seg id="361">"the word" awful "was denounced as an inappropriate description of older drivers. according to the police, the share of older drivers who are involved in accidents, however, is a cause of concern."</seg>
<seg id="362">"in the Kyoto prefecture, for example, 1,941 were caused by a total of 19,460 accidents by seniors. this corresponds to a share of 10%."</seg>
<seg id="363">"ten years later, in 2014, seniors created 1,803 of total 11,850 accidents."</seg>
<seg id="364">"in this way, their share rose to 17.7%."</seg>
<seg id="365">"while the number of accidents in total has decreased, the proportion of accidents caused by seniors increased in the same period."</seg>
<seg id="366">"in the published version of the article, the non-called reporter brought comments to light in the article published on Yahoo, which show which prejudices some Japanese were apparently against older drivers:"</seg>
<seg id="367">"the article on Yahoo about translation errors, among other things, received the following comments:"</seg>
<seg id="368">"-" "Is this (" "terrible motorists" ") about not the reality?"</seg>
<seg id="369">"-" So faulty is the translation really not, isn't it? "</seg>

<seg id="376">The reasons for the wide distribution of translation errors are manifold.</seg>
<seg id="377">"for example, you need two important skills: passive language skills to understand the initial text and active language skills to transfer it to the target language."</seg>
<seg id="378">The latter requires active mastery of the target language - something that is the case with native speakers. in general the conviction that translators should be in the target language - not in the language of the language - native speakers.</seg>
<seg id="379">"for example, a French native speaker should translate from English into French - not from French to English."</seg>
<seg id="380">Photo of Flickr-User Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="381">"many Japanese companies do not employ English as a native language, which might be translated into English. this may be due to lack of understanding of translating, cost reasons or the relatively small number of English native speakers that learn Japanese."</seg>
<seg id="382">"some companies that have no foreign employees themselves, can still manufacture translations internally. then, the Japanese employee, whose English knowledge is considered the best, is made to the translator - no matter how good or bad his language skills are really."</seg>
<seg id="383">Photo of Flickr-User Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="384">Machine translation is also widely used - often with funny results.</seg>
<seg id="385">"the provocative and puzzling propositions produced by machine translation, show that this technique can not replace any human translator for a long time. this is especially true for some languages."</seg>
<seg id="386">"some of the strangest English formulations in Japan, including the mysterious prints that often decorate t-shirts or bags, are only used for stylistic reasons - not to be read or understood."</seg>
<seg id="387">Photo by Flickr-User Joseph Brent.</seg>
<seg id="388">"translation errors may be unacceptable as jewellery or at least harmless, but by large companies or by the government that have the means to ensure higher standards, you can expect more careful translations."</seg>
<seg id="389">"in the future, the city of Kyoto will hopefully use a more serious source for its translations."</seg>

<seg id="394">"other online transmitters carried over recordings of the protests in Caracas, which were organized by opposition groups to resist the government of Nicolás Maduros."</seg>
<seg id="395">"the protests started at the beginning of April, after the Supreme Court dissolved the parliament and transferred the Parliament's duties to the executive and the Supreme Court itself."</seg>
<seg id="396">"Luis Carlos Díaz, journalist and author of Global Voices, published the results of a traceroutes. he pointed out that the connection was coupled, and advised the users to use VPN (virtual private networks) to get access to the Internet."</seg>

<seg id="418">Tina Alvarenga lived eight years in a household where she was not allowed to eat together with the family who lived there.</seg>
<seg id="419">"shortly before her graduation at the university, she returned to the house again and heard how the owner of the house proudly spoke about her." she is like a daughter for us. "</seg>
<seg id="420">"the one that has become something," she said. "</seg>
<seg id="421">But Tina Alvarenga was never treated like a daughter in this house.</seg>
<seg id="422">"when she was ten years old she started working as Criadita for the family. as Criaditas, in Paraguay the more than 46,000 boys and girls who are forced to work to go to school."</seg>
<seg id="423">"the business is very simple: a large family with little money passes their age-old son or her underage daughter to another, rich family. in exchange, the child receives food, training and a roof over the head."</seg>
<seg id="424">"but what is not mentioned, however, is that the children have to work on innumerable days of housework that will never be paid and victims of abuse and abuse - and all this within the framework of a contract that cannot be raised."</seg>
<seg id="425">The practice described as Criadazgo is widespread in Paraguay due to the participation and acceptance of large parts of society and despite numerous complaints of human rights organisations.</seg>
<seg id="426">"after completing her studies, Alvarenga worked for a few years for an organisation that fights for the rights of the boys and girls."</seg>
<seg id="427">"she spoke with Criaditas - especially young girls are affected by the practice of Criadazgo - collected testimonies, researched and denounced."</seg>
<seg id="428">"she tried to call things in the name, because the feeling of gratitude that is injected to the Criaditas guarantees in general silence."</seg>
<seg id="429">"the Criadazgo is based on a double deception," explains Alvarenga. "</seg>
<seg id="430">"on the one hand, the family, which is their daughter in the belief that they conclude their education, improve their position in society and" "make something out of themselves" "can be transferred to another family."</seg>
<seg id="431">"on the other hand, the family that assists girls and whose exploitation with faith justifies that they give someone a chance that would otherwise have no education, and perhaps even starved."</seg>
<seg id="432">The victims of the Criadazgo</seg>

<seg id="435">"in January 2016 the previously relatively unknown phenomenon, which takes place in the secret in Paraguayan households, got a face."</seg>
<seg id="436">"when Carolina Marín came to the hospital in Caaguazú, her body showed traces of violent blows. shortly afterwards she died."</seg>
<seg id="437">She was 14 years old.</seg>
<seg id="438">"she was Criadita in the household of the former military member Tomás Ferreira and his wife Ramona Melgarejo, who works as a civil servant at the Einwohnermeldeamt."</seg>
<seg id="439">"Marín lived with them in their house in Vaquería, a small village with only 3,000 inhabitants, 250 kilometers east of the capital Asunción."</seg>
<seg id="440">"at the end of January 2016, Ferreira attacked Marín as long as she suffered lethal injury."</seg>
<seg id="441">This should be the last punishment in the life of the young girl.</seg>
<seg id="442">"a few days later, the media reported about the incident."</seg>
<seg id="443">They stressed that the murdered child was Criadita.</seg>
<seg id="444">Organizations such as UNICEF and Callescuela were deeply responsible for the death of the girl in the Paraguayan society.</seg>
<seg id="445">They called the Criadazgo as "a modern form of slavery."</seg>
<seg id="446">Several dozen people came together to protest protests and demanded that there should be no other Carolina "in Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="447">The name of the girl and photos were widespread in the social media.</seg>
<seg id="448">"in Paraguay more cows are registered as children," Tina Alvarenga complained. "</seg>
<seg id="449">Without papers it is much easier to violate the rights of children.</seg>
<seg id="450">"without official documents, it is very difficult to control under which conditions boys and girls live."</seg>
<seg id="451">The neighbors of the couple and almost 60 civil society organisations demanded a rapid examination of the case.</seg>
<seg id="452">"they want Tomás Ferreira and Ramona Melgarejo for the murder of the girl who was her Criadita, sentenced to 30 years in prison."</seg>
<seg id="453">"if the case occurs in court, the case of Carolina Marín might be a landmark - if for the first time in the history of Paraguays a case of Criadazgo arrives in court."</seg>
<seg id="454">The everyday life of a criadita</seg>
<seg id="455">"the Criaditas are exploited not only as workers, they also live isolated from other girls at their age."</seg>
<seg id="456">"Tina Alvarenga was ten years old when the Farbik, in which her father worked, had to register, and her father lost his work."</seg>
<seg id="457">"their brothers now had to go all work, and began selling sweets on the street or on the market to make money."</seg>
<seg id="458">But they all went further to school.</seg>
<seg id="459">Only Tina was sent to the capital Asunción as Criadita.</seg>
<seg id="460">"in the house of their employers, Alvarenga worked between four and six hours each day."</seg>
<seg id="461">"in doing so, she had to share the time that she was still learning to learn."</seg>
<seg id="462">She rose up every morning at 5 o'clock and prepared breakfast for her employers.</seg>
<seg id="463">"on Fridays for example, she cleaned the fridge, plastered the living room, polished the furniture and disinfected the floor."</seg>
<seg id="464">"when the school was finished, she went home again and had time to learn."</seg>
<seg id="465">"the more she was done with learning, the more free time she had."</seg>
<seg id="466">But also this time was limited because they had to make dinner for their employers.</seg>
<seg id="467">"Alvarenga says she never had to starve, but didn't get unlimited food." I was allowed to pick up more books from the housekeeper's library as food from the fridge, "she recalls."</seg>

<seg id="502">Sixty Egyptian parliamentarians recently approved a draft bill on "Regulations on the use and use of social networks."</seg>
<seg id="503">"if it is accepted by parliament, users and users of social media in Egypt must register with a government agency to use social media including Facebook and Twitter."</seg>
<seg id="504">"on the basis of the law, a place would be set up that is mandated to use citizens to share a permit to share social media."</seg>
<seg id="505">* Use five-year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop. Euromonitor International has over 40 years' experience of publishing market research reports, business reference books and online information systems. "</seg>
<seg id="506">"if it failed to do so, it could result in a penalty of up to six months in prison or a cash buckle."</seg>
<seg id="507">"the draft constitution consisting of six paragraph and in local media including Youm7 and Egypt Independent, defines social media as" jedwede application, which is going through the Internet and is used to communicate with others using voice, videophone and text. "</seg>
<seg id="508">"it is unclear how the law is enforced when it is accepted, as the draft does not indicate how Egyptian authorities should impose the registration on the users and users who do not register in the face of the fact that the Egyptian government is currently unable to guarantee regulation at the level of social media companies."</seg>
<seg id="509">"Riyad Abdul Sattar, Member of Parliament and promoter of the bill, told the magazine Al-Monitor, registered users and users received a username and password to get through the firewall, which blocked Facebook."</seg>
<seg id="510">"this could mean that Egypt plans to erect a firewall at a national level on Facebook. because of them, it would be necessary for Egyptians to submit information on their identity to access the network."</seg>
<seg id="511">But so far it is not known that such plans exist.</seg>
<seg id="512">Experts on site are sceptical about the technical feasibility of the proposal.</seg>
<seg id="513">"Ramy Raoof, Senior Research Technologist (in German" "senior research technologist" ") of the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights (EIPR, in German" "Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights" "), told Global Voices:"</seg>

<seg id="515">"in my opinion, they imagine that just as they can be done by force on physical public and private spaces, it could also be done online."</seg>
<seg id="516">"if I take them seriously, it means they will set up a powerful surveillance system to filter citizens who seek approval or not. and that means a mad system to monitor people's activities and also to bring them to a court process."</seg>
<seg id="517">"this is technically by no means realistic, but in Egypt everything is possible."</seg>
<seg id="518">"in order to be adopted as a law, the draft must first be discussed with the legislature of Parliament and constitutional committees before it comes to the plenary debate."</seg>

<seg id="526">"a subtype of the larger family of leopards, which fights through Africa and Asia, belong to the Persian leopards (Panthera pardus saxicolor). altogether, there are between 800 and 1,000 animals, such as the International Union for Conservation of Nature."</seg>
<seg id="527">Why is this certain type of leopards so important?</seg>
<seg id="528">"as Raza appears in the video, the Persian leopard is the only surviving predator in the Kurdish ecosystem."</seg>
<seg id="529">"the chance to see a Persian leopard in fact is low and goes against zero. as the team in the video therefore determines that they have a shot of a big cat in the camera, Raza breaks out in pure joy."</seg>

<seg id="544">"in early March 2017, the Daily Kahoku Shimpo, responsible for North East Japan, has been progressing to rebuild the lives of those affected by the" triple-disaster "of March 2011. a huge earthquake, a tsunami and an atomic accident in Fukushima triggered the catastrophe."</seg>
<seg id="545">"the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper has its headquarters in Sendai, which is located in Miyagi prefecture. Miyagi prefecture was a great prefecture in Japan's Northeast, which had to experience both the earthquake and the tsunami."</seg>
<seg id="546">"hundreds of thousands of people from Miyagi and the neighbouring prefectures of Fukushima and Iwate were forced to attack, as the tsunami had disappeared whole coastal cities from the map."</seg>
<seg id="547">"in addition to this, Fukushima prefecture has experienced a nuclear accident, already alone, 160 000 inhabitants had to leave their homes."</seg>
<seg id="548">The Kahoku Shimpo's special report shows the progress achieved six years later in order to rebuild the lives of local residents.</seg>
<seg id="549">The detailed report of the newspaper includes both the statistics of the Japanese rebuilding and the survey results of the affected persons themselves.</seg>
<seg id="550">"the housing situation in Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate"</seg>
<seg id="551">"the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper reports that up to December 2015, a total of 77 per cent of the planned replacement houses (since the public, saigai kouei juutaku) were completed in the prefectures of Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate."</seg>
<seg id="552">"Miyagi posted the biggest success among the three prefectures, here 80 percent of the planned replacement houses were completed."</seg>
<seg id="553">"Iwate has completed 75 percent of such houses, whereas Fukushima with 70 percent is the final light."</seg>
<seg id="554">"however, even six years after the catastrophe, the evacuated of makeshift shelters (of the power of power, casetsu juutaku) are still trying to relocate to final replacement houses, even six years after the catastrophe."</seg>
<seg id="555">"after the three-fold catastrophe, nearly 80 000 people were forced to live in homes."</seg>
<seg id="556">"in December 2016 still 36 000 people from Miyagi, Fukushima and Iwate lived in such cases."</seg>
<seg id="557">"nearly 40 percent of the Fukushima evacuated in 2011 still live in emergency shelters, whereas Miyagi was more successful on this occasion. more than 75 percent of the evacuation, which were hauled after the disaster in Behelfsenthal, were moved into final houses."</seg>
<seg id="558">"for Iwate, the number is here at 34 percent."</seg>
<seg id="559">The state of work and everyday life in the three affected prefectures</seg>
<seg id="560">"as the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper was able to determine, 1074 of 1100 schools, who were affected by the misfortune, opened their doors until December 2016, which accounts for almost 98 percent of the schools of the three prefectures."</seg>
<seg id="561">"six years later, the industrial reconstruction in the three prefectures is far more difficult."</seg>
<seg id="562">"while nearly 100 percent of the fishing ports in Iwate and Miyagi are now in operation, only 30 percent of the fishing ports in Fukushima have resumed its operation."</seg>
<seg id="563">The tsunami and the nuclear accident occurred in the three prefectures of agrarian countries.</seg>
<seg id="564">"Miyagi could restore 93 percent of its agricultural land, whereby only 66 percent of the agricultural land in Iwate and less than 50 percent destroyed land land in Fukushima can be used again."</seg>
<seg id="565">"it is unlikely that this is just a consequence of the nuclear accident, as only 690 hectares of 5 400 hectares of destroyed land of Fukushima, lying in the" nuclear barrier zone. ""</seg>
<seg id="566">"in two of the three prefectures, tourism has recovered extensively and Fukushima lags far away."</seg>
<seg id="567">"the tourist numbers in Miyagi and Iwate are back to 90 per cent on the same level, as before the misfortune. Fukushima, on the other hand, can show only 75 percent."</seg>
<seg id="568">"however, the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper reports that since the disaster nearly half of the coastal inhabitants, it seems harder to earn their livelihood."</seg>
<seg id="569">Is the native population prepared for the next big earthquake?</seg>
<seg id="570">"in order to establish an overall picture, the paper conducted numerous surveys among the local population and under the evacuation."</seg>
<seg id="571">In her introduction of the article the Kahoku Shimpo-Zeitung explains:</seg>
<seg id="572">The Kahoku Shimpo conducted a survey to learn more about the tsunami consciousness among the local population.</seg>
<seg id="573">"the survey revealed that 83.1 percent of local residents, measures have taken action to be prepared for future earthquakes and tsunamis."</seg>
<seg id="574">"Euromonitor International has over 40 years' experience of publishing market research reports, business reference books and online information systems."</seg>
<seg id="575">How it is about those who had to evacuated Fukushima prefecture</seg>
<seg id="576">"in its issue on the anniversary of the earthquake, the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper has intensified its attention to the situation of the evacuation of Fukushima."</seg>
<seg id="577">"Fukushima did not only have to witness the tremendous earthquake and devastating tsunami, no, Fukushima prefecture was also witness to the worst, catastrophic, nuclear accident that Japan had ever experienced."</seg>
<seg id="578">"from 160 000 evacuated from Fukushima, nearly 63 000 people were transferred to areas outside the prefecture."</seg>
<seg id="579">"at the beginning of 2016 some more than 22,000 people were moved back to Fukushima, in permanent replacement houses."</seg>
<seg id="580">"after the 2017 stand still 40 000 inhabitants live in Fukushima, outside of their home prefecture."</seg>
<seg id="581">"in the disaster areas most of the evacuees still are older than 50 years old. they are well known because efforts to rebuild Miyagi, Iwate and Fukushima have to compete with massive construction projects. these are construction projects that are part of the Olympic Games that will take place in Tokyo 2020."</seg>

<seg id="628">It is two years since the activities in the sugar cane factories were paralyzed.</seg>
<seg id="629">"after that the sugar cane industry stood still in the region, and the factory gradually lost its plants until only the smells of steel and concrete remained."</seg>
<seg id="630">Approximately 272 workers had to reinvent themselves.</seg>
<seg id="631">Some changed the work.</seg>
<seg id="632">Others resigned and commute daily to the factories.</seg>

<seg id="635">That was something he did not expect.</seg>

<seg id="640">Why was the Cuban sugar cane industry turned off?</seg>

<seg id="642">(photo: Julio Batista)</seg>
<seg id="643">"the reduction of the sugar cane industry was an economic necessity: the 155 sugar cane factories were technically obsolete, and hardly competitive they became untenable for the country."</seg>
<seg id="644">"the initial idea was to concentrate production on the most efficient factories, the annual production objective was 4 million tonnes."</seg>
<seg id="645">"they left only factories, which can produce sugar for a maximum of 4 Centavos (0,03 euros)."</seg>
<seg id="646">The solution for unemployment?</seg>
<seg id="647">The motives that led to such measures were the low productivity of sugar cane plantations and the sugar crisis on the world market.</seg>
<seg id="648">"nevertheless, the sugar rate rose again about a decade ago."</seg>
<seg id="649">"from 2017 to 2025, the price of unrefined sugar must remain between 15 and 16 Centavos per pound, according to the 2016 report" Landeconomic perspectives "published by the OECD and FAO, the Agriculture and Food Organisation of the United Nations."</seg>
<seg id="650">"if the current production would reach the level of 2001 (3.6 million tonnes), raw sugar imports would generate around 85 million dollars for the country."</seg>

<seg id="692">"young people of the First Nations communities throughout Canada are dealing with topics that are important to them. they do it through hip hop, thanks to a number of hiking workshops."</seg>
<seg id="693">"since 2014, as part of the N'we Jinan tour, workshops are bringing workshops directly to schools and youth centres to teach youth groups songwriting, recording, audio and video production and live performances."</seg>
<seg id="694">The original workshops were led by the Pädagogen David Hodges who lives in Montreal and worked in north-Quebec with ten Cree communities and then worked together with the Cree Hip-Hop-group The NorthStar.</seg>
<seg id="695">"the workshop assumes that young participants in conversation issues topics such as" cultural identity, speech, debate, love, self-acceptance, "or whatever the meaning of them."</seg>
<seg id="696">These questions are inspiration for songs and videos in which the young people are the main actors.</seg>
<seg id="697">"because the workshops were so popular, the team also worked with other First Nations communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and was invited to organise similar workshops with the tribe of Winnebago in Nebraska."</seg>
<seg id="698">"this video of the school 'Na Aksa Gyilak'Yoo in the region of the tribe of the Kitsumkalum First Nation in British Columbia, for example, called the history of Highway 16, also called" Highway of Tears, "a road section in Westkanada, where almost two dozen mostly indigenous young women disappeared or were murdered."</seg>
<seg id="699">The cases were largely unsolved.</seg>
<seg id="700">The next video of the Nemaska Cree First Nation uses the motif of a video game to convey how important the preservation of traditional customs and customs despite the influences through globalization.</seg>
<seg id="701">"many of the songs appeared in indigenous languages, although the young people don't always dominate the languages of the First Nations."</seg>
<seg id="702">"in the following song that Whapmagoostui Cree First Nation received, the refrain is sung on Cree."</seg>
<seg id="703">"the young people involved here received some help from Gary Jolly of the Northstar hip-hop group, who gave them a rophe in the dialect Eastern James Bay Cree."</seg>
<seg id="704">"on the Facebook page of N'we Jinan, the Strophe is available in transcript, as well a translation into English translated into German:"</seg>
<seg id="705">Sometimes I feel as if nobody ever wanted to be interested in me</seg>

<seg id="718">In Japan you can see plastic dishes in front of almost any restaurant.</seg>
<seg id="719">"to show potential customers what is exactly on the menu, are located near the entrance shokuhin sanpuru (" "Plastic models of the dishes" ") from any food served in this restaurant."</seg>
<seg id="720">Customers see these plastic dishes and then decide whether they enter the restaurant or go on.</seg>
<seg id="721">There is a whole industry dedicated to the production of these plastic dishes.</seg>
<seg id="722">"in the tokioter district of Kappabashi, there are a variety of these small businesses that produce those plastic dishes that the German filmmaker Wim Wenders documented in his film Tokyo-Ga more than 20 years ago."</seg>
<seg id="723">"for most Japanese, these plastic dishes are so common that they do not even notice them any more. however, a new trend now turns them into showy cell phone accessories and other gadgets."</seg>
<seg id="724">"at Naver Matoma, the blogger itinii released series of social media links and photos showing this unusual twist with the shokuhin sanpuru."</seg>
<seg id="725">Now in special sale: new decorated with plastic strapped mobile phones as shown in the Kichijoji Tokyu department store.</seg>
<seg id="726">"many of these artificial foods have been turned into kitsch collectibles, as in this case, refrigerator magnets:"</seg>
<seg id="727">Here are a few Shokuhin refrigerators for a new exhibition in Tokyo Station.</seg>
<seg id="728">The new boom of the Essentials is increasingly complex.</seg>
<seg id="729">"in this case, an emperor-don (a popular rice bowl with seafood) was transformed into a mobile stand."</seg>
<seg id="730">For this triangular bowl (lol) we found a good use as a mobile stand.</seg>
<seg id="731">We also made this part for the exhibition at the Tokyo station.</seg>
<seg id="732">And here is an apple that holds your mobile phone:</seg>
<seg id="733">"designed to look like an apple, with a notch for the cell phone, this is already a great design."</seg>
<seg id="734">And that is just the beginning of an increasing approach into the compass.</seg>
<seg id="735">"some mobile phones and cell phone designers allow you to make your own artwork. in this case, ikura or laughing is used, a popular topping that is served with white rice."</seg>
<seg id="736">On Twitter some users had their doubts:</seg>
<seg id="737">"there's someone who would say:" wow, cool, now I can decorate my mobile with salmon cheating? "</seg>
<seg id="738">I think I will be the only one.</seg>
<seg id="739">"this interest in plastic dishes can also take a less appetizing form to surprise, for example, colleagues or family members unpleasant."</seg>
<seg id="740">Our latest mobile phone stand has the form of mellow ice.</seg>
<seg id="741">"in addition, we also have rice balls (Onigiri), earrings and handybands made of dried salmon."</seg>
<seg id="742">"you can watch other skurrile plastic dishes at: itinii's Naver Matoma blog post. or follow the hashtag #"</seg>
<seg id="743">"if you want to learn more about the origin of this trend, this video gives you an insight into the neighborhood of Kappabashi, which is devoted to the supply of the restaurant industry. for example, with the shokuhin sanpuru."</seg>

<seg id="749">"in reports in domestic and foreign media about the notorious" "fight against drug trafficking" "in Mexico, the misfortunes and killed regularly only appear in statistics. however, they do not reflect the extent of the human tragedy that entails this struggle."</seg>
<seg id="750">"reporting on drug bosses, such as El Chapo Guzmán, the chief of the Sinaloa cartel, completely pressed the stories of the victims of the conflict completely into the background."</seg>
<seg id="751">"on the day after a violent incident, hardly anyone looks at the grieving or the churches that have learned to live with the pain."</seg>
<seg id="752">"behind every body, behind every bone discovery in the hundreds of secret tombs, the stories of countless parents, sons and daughters, friends and partners whose wounds may never be healed."</seg>
<seg id="753">"this is why the Mexican News Portal Animal Político has launched the digital project" "aprender a Vivir Con El Narco" "(German:" "learning about drug trafficking" ") that is meant to give this sacrifice a voice and stories of people that came into the fight between law enforcement authorities and cartels."</seg>
<seg id="754">Animal Político describes the project so:</seg>
<seg id="755">Organized crime can not only be feared by our lives.</seg>
<seg id="756">The effects are much deeper.</seg>
<seg id="757">"for example, if shops close because they are threatened by drug dealers and whole communities need to drive many kilometers to buy something like milk."</seg>
<seg id="758">The Pain of the Victims</seg>
<seg id="759">"a video entitled" "Vieque Cambian por el miedo" "(German:" "as fear life changes" ") tells exactly these stories."</seg>
<seg id="760">"a main character is Guadalupe, a father who is looking for secret tombs after his son."</seg>
<seg id="761">"Emma Veleta Rodríguez, who lost her father, her four siblings only one day, lost her husband and two of her nephews."</seg>
<seg id="762">"priests:" "like every Sunday, we prepare ourselves again today for the task that we have set ourselves to go and to graves, according to the people we have loved."</seg>
<seg id="763">Guadalupe Contreras: "my son is called Antonio Ivan Contreras Mata.</seg>
<seg id="764">He was 28 when he disappeared.</seg>

<seg id="767">On 13 October he left the house.</seg>
<seg id="768">"on October 15th he should be back again, but he never returned." Emma Veleta: "it's very hard for me, because I am now alone with three children who need training."</seg>
<seg id="769">"there is also my mother, who is here with me too."</seg>
<seg id="770">At the moment she has no income.</seg>
<seg id="771">"you are entitled to the insurance of my father, but they do not pay them out because they require a death certificate."</seg>
<seg id="772">"where should we get that?" ""</seg>
<seg id="773">The editors of "aprender a vivir con el Narco" explain why the project is so important:</seg>
<seg id="774">"we have to show not only the faces of those who are afraid. we have to show the international community the conflicts, fragility and government leadership."</seg>
<seg id="775">The project is based on stories of readers and reports of journalists in high-risk areas.</seg>
<seg id="776">Here are some excerpts from the stories.</seg>
<seg id="777">"KYHB, a reader of Animal Político, wrote this article from Taxco, in the Federal State of Guerrero in central Mexico."</seg>
<seg id="778">"their contribution reminds us that violence should never be regarded as normal, no matter what form they occur:"</seg>
<seg id="779">I have already known disease and sensational journalism for a few years now.</seg>
<seg id="780">I am coming to newspaper kiosks every day and see the title pages with pictures that can actually only come from a textbook for criminology or from specialists from specialists.</seg>
<seg id="781">It brings me out of the frame.</seg>
<seg id="782">Sometimes I feel as if I am the only one who is disgusting or sad. it works like a lack of respect towards the person who once belonged to this body.</seg>
<seg id="783">I cannot be indifferent or consider this as normal.</seg>
<seg id="784">She writes on:</seg>
<seg id="785">"no, it's not normal that my 10 year old cousin thinks that he wants to become Narco (German: drug traffickers) when he is big. and it's not normal that people hear songs about" "heroism" "of offenders when they go through the streets."</seg>
<seg id="786">"for me, it is as if they ridiculate those who have lost someone and those who have fear that something happens to them."</seg>
<seg id="787">I see our weakness if stories are to be mere figures in a statistic.</seg>
<seg id="788">"the insomnia of people is incredible for me, when the death of six people and the disappearance of 43 students in a neighboring town are justified by the fact that they were" "rebellious". ""</seg>
<seg id="789">"I think they try to say that they are spared by such tragedies, if they are not stirring and quiet."</seg>
<seg id="790">"Maribel L. from Mexico City wrote the contribution" Four months of blackmail in the capital district, "as a family with threats was looted." in this, it describes how armed criminal month blackmailed money from their business until they destroyed not only the business but also torn their family apart. "</seg>
<seg id="791">You think of everything you have lost and how many people can completely change your life in just a few days.</seg>
<seg id="792">"pain is never going on, the trauma remains, the fear comes up again when you are alone."</seg>
<seg id="793">"habits have changed, telephone numbers too."</seg>
<seg id="794">We only contact us if it is absolutely necessary.</seg>
<seg id="795">"the more we are apart from each other, the better."</seg>
<seg id="796">She concluded her report with the words:</seg>
<seg id="797">"we want the others to be arrested, as you don't know when they will kidnap or kill you."</seg>
<seg id="798">"in those terrible days I asked if wines would dissolve my deep-rooted feelings, but the response is no, because I forgot how to cry. I have to learn how to live with the pain."</seg>
<seg id="799">"the journalist, Mario Gutiérrez Vega, published the article" The Forgotten Children of Ciudad Juárez: a generation of violence. "</seg>
<seg id="800">In the introduction he raises questions like: who cares about the child of a missing woman and a man who was murdered by organized crime?</seg>
<seg id="801">How is it to grow in a settlement on the edge of the most dangerous city of Mexico?</seg>
<seg id="802">"he is not like other boys of his age, whose parents care about them."</seg>
<seg id="803">"Bryan is a orphan and he tells that he had to teach himself how to cook egg, potatoes, tortillas and make" Chichi "for the babies who live with him. this is his name for the preparation of the bottles with water, sugar and milk powder."</seg>
<seg id="804">He tells of the nine scars on his left leg - one for every year of life.</seg>
<seg id="805">But they are insignificant compared to the pain in his eyes - unspeakably for a boy for whom all life consists of violence and who had to learn to live.</seg>
<seg id="806">"when he was five years old, he told him that his mother was gone."</seg>
<seg id="807">But this was not the day when his childhood ended.</seg>
<seg id="808">"his childhood had been past two years before, when he was only a few blocks away from his home, the bloody corpse of his father, who had been shot by armed men from a passing car."</seg>
<seg id="809">"born in Bryan, the situation in Juárez looked like this:"</seg>
<seg id="810">"Bryan was born in 2006, as violence by organised crime and the fight against the already existing social problems in Juárez."</seg>
<seg id="811">"in 2008, 2009 and 2010, Juárez was the most dangerous city in the world because of the number of murders for public security and government of the government of the United States."</seg>
<seg id="812">"in 2010 alone, the Public Prosecutor's Office counted 3103 Morde. this corresponds to the average of 8.5 Morden per day."</seg>
<seg id="813">These are just a few of hundreds of thousands of stories that leave the organised crime in Mexico and penetrate them into the soul of the country.</seg>
<seg id="814">"only a few stories are still alive in the face of new headlines. however, this project reminds us of those we must not forget."</seg>
<seg id="815">"in addition to the project" "aprender a Vivir Con El Narco" "Animal Político launched the data journalism project Narcodata, whose goal is to portray the complex information behind the failed fight against drug trafficking, which has tormented the country in the last four decades, in an understandable way."</seg>

<seg id="819">"but how is the years after something happened the first time? content in social media, whether true or untrue, tends to persist."</seg>
<seg id="820">Let us take this picture of a terrible accident seven years ago in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DR Congo).</seg>
<seg id="821">"since its first publication, it has been misleading to depict tragedies that have actually occurred in Nigeria or Myanmar."</seg>
<seg id="822">"this false coupling of picture and event -" false description "or" wrong context "in the terminology of Global Voices or First Draft News - does not deny the fact that there are plenty of meticulous reporting of events in DR Congo, Myanmar and Nigeria."</seg>
<seg id="823">But it raises questions about our desire for pictures to messages.</seg>
<seg id="824">What happened in the Democratic Republic of Congo</seg>
<seg id="825">"in 2010, a tank car crossed the village of Sange in the east of the DR Congo, tipped around and exploded. 230 people came to life."</seg>
<seg id="826">"after the civil war, Africa's second largest country had been neglected for years and devastated it. the roads in the region have become dangerous paths full of potholes that were difficult to drive."</seg>
<seg id="827">"tragically, the tank car fell to the victim."</seg>
<seg id="828">"sales representatives described a fireball, the dozens of homes enveloped including a cinema nearby which was full of people who watched the World Cup."</seg>
<seg id="829">Houses of contaminated and charcoal bodies were scattered in the streets.</seg>
<seg id="830">Many people were burned to ignorance.</seg>
<seg id="831">"a picture with the title" Das ist Nigeria. "by Imgur-Users Mystical Monkey, 12 January 2015.Several photos of the incident form the horrible scenes of this day."</seg>
<seg id="832">Above is an example of this.</seg>
<seg id="833">It shows rows of charred bodies that are agitated on the ground while individuals look at them.</seg>
<seg id="834">But here the story does not end.</seg>
<seg id="835">"over the years the same photo was falsified several times on social media, blogs and other platforms and wrongly attributed to real but not related tragedies, especially events in Nigeria and Myanmar."</seg>
<seg id="836">What did not happen in Nigeria and Myanmar</seg>
<seg id="837">On 3 January 2015 fighters of Boko Haram attacked the remote Nigerian villages of Baga and Doro Gowon.</seg>
<seg id="838">"eye-witnesses reported drastic of atrocities, before they had to flee."</seg>
<seg id="839">Houses and shops were burned down and dead bodies were in streets and bushes.</seg>
<seg id="840">"reports, according to which 150 to 2,000 people were massacred."</seg>
<seg id="841">"but the numbers could not be confirmed." "no one stayed behind to count the bodies," "said a resident to Human Rights Watch."</seg>
<seg id="842">"many were crushed, shot or burned."</seg>
<seg id="843">"only on the basis of satellite images, the follow-up period could be illustrated."</seg>
<seg id="844">"the reason for the attack was also uncertain, but the army base in Baga was a permanent conflict between the military Nigerias and the attempt of Boko Haram to win the country (examples from 2013 and 2015)."</seg>
<seg id="845">And here the picture from the DR Congo appeared again when it was mistakenly presented as evidence of the fact and the possible extent of the attack:</seg>
<seg id="846">This is Nigeria.</seg>
<seg id="847">A massacre of 2,000 people took place two days after Paris. "</seg>
<seg id="848">They are not Charlie.</seg>
<seg id="849">They are dead.</seg>
<seg id="850">"in fact, this improper use of the image from the DR Congo is only one in a number of abortions; Africa Check has documented orders to Nigeria since 2014."</seg>
<seg id="851">In all these cases the picture was presented as a proof for mass killings.</seg>
<seg id="852">"another step further brings personal comments, such as the picture from the DR Congo with sources of the mass media in connection to provide arguments."</seg>
<seg id="853">The image from Sange also appeared in connection with the deadly persecution of the Muslim Rohingya in Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="854">"according to a flash message, published by the United Nations described those who were able to escape strikes, rape and several deaths, some by burning."</seg>
<seg id="855">"while others reported about the violence against Rohingya, posts like the following, which brought these descriptions together with photos from the DR Congo:"</seg>
<seg id="856">"this image originates from an Saudi Arabian news page, which mistakenly tended to be the President of Myanmar's Thein, monks and politicians would have participated in the assassination of Rohingya Muslims. in addition, it had used the image from the DR Congo to obtain this information."</seg>

<seg id="912">"this article from 2014 about students murdered by Boko Haram published by the now deleted news page Análisis Digital, has expressly declared that the picture does not originate from the killings, but it claims that it is a" similar djihadist attack. ""</seg>
<seg id="913">"as the picture later came into circulation in the context of the Boko Haram massacre of 2015, the newspaper El Pais tried to refute that there were connections to Nigeria."</seg>

<seg id="915">"the image of the DR Congo appeared, provided with this Twitterhashtag, and triggered a discussion among Muslims after the Boko Haram massacre of 2015 and the attack on Charlie Hebdo in Paris."</seg>
<seg id="916">"they wanted to achieve a greater attention to these events, presumably in the name of Islam."</seg>
<seg id="917">"United States, 2015."</seg>
<seg id="918">"the picture was sweatched for the Boko Haram massacre in 2015 (and saved more than 9.300 times), but the messages that were associated with it were not taken up in any religious context."</seg>
<seg id="919">"instead, the aim was to attract attention to the relative number of deaths and a comparison of media reporting in comparison to Nigeria and the attack against Charlie Hebdo."</seg>
<seg id="920">"Vietnamese, 2014."</seg>
<seg id="921">"after a message which was supposedly written by a" father Juan Carlos Martos "about the Nigerian massacre, there were discussion forums like this here on Vietnamese and declared it to be false."</seg>

<seg id="927">Frames and pictures</seg>
<seg id="928">"there are two strong subjects or frames, which go through these posts. the first frame focuses on religion."</seg>
<seg id="929">The photo was used in relation to greater discussions about silence in connection with the assassination of Christians through Muslims or - for the defense of Muslims - the assassination of Rohingya through Buddhists.</seg>
<seg id="930">A second framing uses the image to discuss how an African life is underrated in comparison to a European or French life.</seg>
<seg id="931">"to understand religion and the value of human life is both important. therefore, it is worth investigating how images are used in connection with these efforts."</seg>
<seg id="932">"however, a deeper question is what happens when readers can no longer believe these images."</seg>
<seg id="933">"with social media, there are a lot of people who unintentionally share the water around a tragedy."</seg>
<seg id="934">"suggests this mood of mis- and false information that actual atrocities are untrue and narrows it to the actual horror of what is actually happening in the DR Congo, Nigeria and Myanmar?"</seg>
<seg id="935">The spread of violent images has already been extensively debated (for example).</seg>
<seg id="936">"one argument is that withholding images of a refusal to recognize the tragedy, sometimes these images are even demanded by the victims themselves."</seg>
<seg id="937">"at the same time, the worry that violent images readers and viewers are desensitizing and taking the ability to feel empathy (such as this study, which examined how violent media work to help others)."</seg>

<seg id="944">"a blog with the name Untranslatable (i.e. irreplaceable) strives to offer language enthusiasts a selection of words from around the world, which are difficult or not to translate at all."</seg>
<seg id="945">"such words exist in each language: they express certain situations or feelings, which are often very complex or specific."</seg>
<seg id="946">Some of these irreplaceable words are already well-known today (like the famous Portuguese saudade) and others who are deeply rooted in a special culture (for example the Spanish sobremesa).</seg>
<seg id="947">But everyone resisted stubbornly every attempt of a simple translation.</seg>
<seg id="948">"a word or expression does not suffice, which is why a full explanation and sometimes some context are required to understand exactly what is meant by this one word."</seg>
<seg id="949">These unique words have been collected for an entire period of time in an online list.</seg>
<seg id="950">"most of these lists deal with Japanese, German, French, Portuguese or Finnish words while the author and linguist of" Untranslatable "Steven Bird decided to focus on small languages."</seg>
<seg id="951">"for example, in the blog you can find words from the Mwotlap language of Vanuatu, such as:"</seg>

<seg id="953">"and words in the Hunsrik language spoken in parts of Brazil, such as:"</seg>

<seg id="972">"according to a statement by the Sri Lanka's disaster centre of 28 May 2017, 126 people were killed and barely hundred people are being missed because of the floods and sludge winches."</seg>
<seg id="973">"more than 400,000 people have been affected since last Friday (May 26) and approximately 100,000 people were brought to 304 safe places."</seg>
<seg id="974">"the rainfalls were released on Saturday (May 27), and the water levels in some areas slowly went back."</seg>

<seg id="996">In January I took part in the Women's March in San Francisco with a neighbor and love girlfriend.</seg>

<seg id="998">"in one minute, we still call slogans for women's rights."</seg>
<seg id="999">"in the next, we are calling for rights for transgender."</seg>
<seg id="1000">"we are in a sea of umbrellas and people, some keep the iconic picture of a woman with headscarf high, tied out of an American flag, others are enacting slogans against anti-Islam hostility."</seg>
<seg id="1001">"my girlfriend looks at me and says," "These things do not concern you, or?" "why, because I am not Muslims?" "I ask."</seg>
<seg id="1002">I have already managed this conversation.</seg>
<seg id="1003">"people with whom I have been working or people who have known me for years, separate me - the Sahar they know - from the widespread concept of" Muslims, "which has built up in their imagination."</seg>
<seg id="1004">They mitigate me.</seg>
<seg id="1005">There are 1.7 billion Muslims worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="1006">We do not see all the same.</seg>
<seg id="1007">We practice our religion differently.</seg>
<seg id="1008">"we identify ourselves to be a Muslim, to different kinds. but somehow we are all put into the same Muslim drawer."</seg>
<seg id="1009">"this drawer is so well constructed in our collective imagination, that as soon as Muslims, who, as I do not fit, will be mitigated."</seg>
<seg id="1010">To be muslized</seg>
<seg id="1011">I don't stand alone.</seg>
<seg id="1012">That is even the poet who is most selling poetry in America: Rumi.</seg>

<seg id="1014">Love?</seg>
<seg id="1015">Peace?</seg>
<seg id="1016">"when Jalaluddin Rumi was as old as I am now, he was an Orthodox Muslim preacher and scholar."</seg>
<seg id="1017">"Islam, the Koran and Prophet Muhammad were up to the day when he died, the centre of his poetry."</seg>
<seg id="1018">"but in the Western conception, the religion of Rumis was deleted, as well as from the most popular translations of his poetry."</seg>
<seg id="1019">This deletion makes a large part of the history of the 1.7 billion Muslims of this world.</seg>
<seg id="1020">Another is in the reductionist images of Muslims who have been colonised by Western books for centuries.</seg>
<seg id="1021">This enticing picture language is determined by the dark man that one should fear and the exotic woman that should be saved.</seg>
<seg id="1022">The groundbreaking Palestinian-American scientist Edward Said broke down the story behind these images in the 1970s.</seg>
<seg id="1023">But these pictures still stand out today.</seg>
<seg id="1024">"our politicians, the news industry and Hollywood continue to steal them."</seg>
<seg id="1025">"I have worked for thirteen years in the news industry and I have seen how these powerful, flawed narratives dominate our newsfeeds."</seg>
<seg id="1026">"this Narrative overshadows the reality that nine Muslim women have led their countries over the last three decades, while the US won't even choose their first female presidential candidate."</seg>
<seg id="1027">"this Narrative fails to recognise that if French, Muslim women are prevented from carrying out their headscarf in public buildings and to cover Saudi Arabian, Muslim women through their government to cover all of these two sides of the same coin."</seg>
<seg id="1028">A powerful group exercises his "control" to the "other."</seg>
<seg id="1029">"this strong Narrative weakens Muslim women, which lead movements for change."</seg>
<seg id="1030">"it seems that the first Muslim prayers were spoken on American ground by Africans, who had been brought to slave ships."</seg>
<seg id="1031">It deletes the existence of queer Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="1032">"this Narrative has so deep and flawed our collective imagination, that often Sikh men and children are often attacked by anti-Muslim attacks and harassings."</seg>
<seg id="1033">"because of these stories we tell, and because of the way we relate to them, Islamophobia is today not only fear of Islam, religion, but fear of the" others. ""</seg>
<seg id="1034">To the 1.7 billion people</seg>
<seg id="1035">"in the news industry, we do more than just tell stories based on facts."</seg>
<seg id="1036">Or on alternative facts.</seg>

<seg id="1038">And my industry has failed to grasp the Narrative of 1.7 billion.</seg>
<seg id="1039">"and we have failed, where seven million Muslims constitute the" "diverse" "religious group in America."</seg>

<seg id="1050">"we do not have to be theological experts to be" "Muslim" "or to almost always be selected for additional security checks at the airport."</seg>
<seg id="1051">"there are hundreds of outstanding Muslim scholars, Muslim activists and interreligious activists seeking to fight widely spread lies over Islam."</seg>
<seg id="1052">"these lies are produced on the current tape of a well-lubricated Islamophobic machine with lenders, think tanks and experts for false information, which is our already erroneous image of what a Muslim is; or what Islam is, have manipulated."</seg>

<seg id="1062">"if social scientists describe religious life, they use the following terms: faith, behavior and affiliation."</seg>
<seg id="1063">"my Muslim belief and behaviour may not always be visible, but they are there."</seg>
<seg id="1064">"perhaps my girlfriend, my neighbour, would see my rock in the surf that I am Muslim, if they could look through the 15 metres of concrete and air that separate our houses."</seg>
<seg id="1065">"she would see the evening ritual with my daughter, when I kept her in my arms and whisper her to the Arabic verses to protect the Koran and called the Quls."</seg>

<seg id="1073">Being Muslims means to speak the prayers they told me when I have a bad day.</seg>

<seg id="1080">"affiliation is to know that there are millions of Kurds and Palestinians whose families, as with my grandfather, have been torn apart by colonialists who have shared the Muslim world as at risk."</seg>

<seg id="1090">It means knowing that more than half million Iraqis buried beneath the ruins of war.</seg>
<seg id="1091">To be an American Muslim means knowing that the suicide rate among veterans has increased by more than 32 per cent since 2001.</seg>
<seg id="1092">"it means knowing that if a tragedy holds the US and the suspect carries a Muslim name, the story is reported four times more than a story with a white assassin."</seg>

<seg id="1112">"we are back for decades to recognize the roots of our fears, and the flawed and dangerous image prints that we have in our news editorial offices."</seg>
<seg id="1113">"at least there is a growing movement, led by American Muslims within the media industry, which tries to capture our many multiplied identities and forgotten history."</seg>
<seg id="1114">"the podcast See Something, Say Something of Buzzfeed; the podcast # GoodMuslimBadMuslim; Sapelo Square about black, American Muslims; Simon & amp; Schusters Salam Reads, an initiative to increase Muslim writers and Ms Marvel, the PAKISTANISH, Muslim, American superheroine - all this makes me hope."</seg>

<seg id="1138">"global Voices reported recently about another initiative of Steven Bird, the untranslatable blog."</seg>
<seg id="1139">"however, the focus of TLS is not on the written, but on the spoken word. it is an attempt to preserve and appreciate the language diversity of large cities."</seg>
<seg id="1140">"in fact, in urban areas such as Melbourne and Darwin in Australia or in Oakland in the United States, where TLS has already held events since 2015, the risk that small and not very small languages will not be passed on to the children born there."</seg>
<seg id="1141">For the makers of the project apply:</seg>
<seg id="1142">"the mass extinction of the languages of the world can be avoided if we create cities, accept diversity - safe spaces where residents don't have to forget who they are to belong."</seg>
<seg id="1143">"while listening often is associated with understanding," "these events instead" "take the listener to appreciate, to feel, to make sense."</seg>
<seg id="1144">"in this format, storytellers will first translate their history into their own language and then explain them in English."</seg>
<seg id="1145">"even if the participants are not a professional story teller, their dedication and representation will result in the audience."</seg>
<seg id="1146">They call forth laughter and emotions as if the language is no longer a barrier.</seg>
<seg id="1147">"the following video shows a traditional story from Burkina Faso, which is told in the language Dafing. during this round, the story narrative Rassidatou conate also takes the opportunity to explain the typical customs of narration for their country."</seg>
<seg id="1148">"in another event, John Nyamusara tells the fables of hare and the baboon in the language Shona from Zimbabwe:"</seg>
<seg id="1149">"after explaining the importance of his Fable, John Nyamusara is asked:" how is this to speak to an audience that doesn't understand your language? "with a wide grin, he shares his sense of inclusiveness:"</seg>
<seg id="1150">You have listened to!</seg>
<seg id="1151">They were attentive...</seg>
<seg id="1152">They were all with me!</seg>
<seg id="1153">"so far, the events of Treasure Language Storytelling have taken place in three cities, and the organizers hope to expand this. anyone who is inspired by the project can contact TLS to organize their own story narrative tours."</seg>

<seg id="1155">"on April 3, 2017, with the aim of a re-check of the public debt of Puerto Rico, several religious and civil organisations participated in a mass demonstration on April 3, 2017. the march started at the puertory Capitol, the government building of the capital, and went up to the Plaza de Colón in the old town of San Juan."</seg>
<seg id="1156">She was proclaimed by the grouping "Frente Ciudadano por la Auditoría de la Deuda" (Citizens front for the re-examination of the debts) and the comedy church meeting Puerto Rico.</seg>
<seg id="1157">The advocates of the re-fixing of debt have also submitted a petition on the official website of the White House of the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1158">This is their demand:</seg>
<seg id="1159">"the people of Puerto Rico demand that politicians, bankers and government agencies responsible for debts are held accountable for their corruption."</seg>
<seg id="1160">"we call for a financial review and a Steering Committee without personal interests in public debt, with a firm, our working conditions appropriate remuneration, which acts in favour of the economy."</seg>
<seg id="1161">We are crushed and suppressed.</seg>
<seg id="1162">"the people of Puerto Rico refuse to pay a debt, which is not theirs."</seg>
<seg id="1163">We will not choose between education and health.</seg>
<seg id="1164">Our pensioners will not be able to find themselves with declining pension payments.</seg>
<seg id="1165">We demand immediate action.</seg>
<seg id="1166">The island - not the sovereign territory of the United States - suffers from a serious financial crisis.</seg>
<seg id="1167">"hence, the so-called" Centre for New Economy, "a non-profit organization without party affiliation with focus on socio-economic development, proposes a law on state responsibility, as an alternative to existing state supervision."</seg>
<seg id="1168">These are their reasons:</seg>
<seg id="1169">The economic and financial crisis of Puerto Rico requires a wide restructuring of the state infrastructure.</seg>
<seg id="1170">"without the participation and conviction of the citizens, measures imposed from the outside will be jeopardized by the people."</seg>
<seg id="1171">The demonstration carried the name "night watch for light and truth."</seg>

<seg id="1187">"the book, which was published last year and is available here royalty-free, contains a number of essays that deal with the free culture in the face of oppression."</seg>
<seg id="1188">It is a homage to Bassel and his work.</seg>
<seg id="1189">In the introduction it means:</seg>
<seg id="1190">"this book wants to discuss how movements are built for free knowledge, and what the real costs are, with which this is connected."</seg>
<seg id="1191">"activists, artists, designers, developers, researchers and authors who are involved in the movements for free knowledge have worked on side to look over the fog that surrounds our news feeds and to make some sense from our different experiences."</seg>
<seg id="1192">"this book is an attempt to free Bassel Khartabil, the beloved and celebrated internet-volunteer, who has been detained in Syria since March 15, 2012."</seg>
<seg id="1193">His name was removed from the directory of the Adra prison in which he sat on 3 October 2015.</seg>
<seg id="1194">"since then, we have no information about its current state or location."</seg>
<seg id="1195">"the introductory part of his book entitled Collective Remembrance gives his friends and his family a voice that insists on his release and who want to know him back in his normal life and freedom, instantly."</seg>
<seg id="1196">"seeing how Bassel pays a high price for its participation in a free culture, many of us have begun to think about their own destinies, deeds and decisions."</seg>
<seg id="1197">Why are we here today?</seg>
<seg id="1198">What did we choose?</seg>
<seg id="1199">What have we given up in this process of time-wise extreme beliefs?</seg>
<seg id="1200">The web developer for Open Source and Digital Activist has been in custody of Syrian government agencies since March 2012.</seg>
<seg id="1201">"in October 2015, Bassel was transferred from the Adra prison, a non-military institution to an unknown place."</seg>
<seg id="1202">"his wife, the writer and lawyer Noura Ghazi, reported that the" Military Police "Bassel had taken from his cell in Adra on the basis of a" "strictly secret" "command of the military tribunal."</seg>
<seg id="1203">"Ghazi reported that she was contacted by persons on 12 November 2015, who presented himself as insider of Assad's government and informed them of an alleged death sentence against her husband."</seg>
<seg id="1204">"however, its place of residence and condition remain unknown."</seg>
<seg id="1205">"a pioneer of the creative Commons in Syria and actively involved in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia, Bassel played a crucial role in expanding access to the Internet and knowledge for the public in Syria."</seg>
<seg id="1206">"Barry Threw, a designer, technologist and currently the director of New Palmyra, a project that founded Bassel, writes on pages 10 and 11 of the book:"</seg>
<seg id="1207">"perhaps none of Bassels cultural prototypes were predictable than the work, which he began with a group of archaeologists and 3D artists around 2005 to virtually reconstruct the ancient ruins of Palmyras."</seg>
<seg id="1208">"Palmyra, one of the most important archaeological sites in the world, was the cross of numerous civilizations and here, Greek-Roman architecture of architecture with local traditions and Persian influences."</seg>
<seg id="1209">"at that time, Bassel could not know that ten years after he began with this work, the IS would make everything possible to wipe out this architecture, which embodies not only the cultural heritage of Sysriens but the world."</seg>
<seg id="1210">This strip into the digital archaeology and conservation has created a time capsule that will be invaluable to the public as well as for scientists and artists in the future.</seg>
<seg id="1211">"tragically, Bassel could not yet complete this project."</seg>
<seg id="1212">Noura Ghazi also contributed to the book and writes about the passion of her husband to share his knowledge with others even during his time in prison:</seg>
<seg id="1213">"I spent my entire life, dreaming of freedom, and Bassel taught me to embrace it."</seg>
<seg id="1214">I am overwhelmed when I call his name.</seg>
<seg id="1215">"Bassel gave me English, even when he was in prison."</seg>
<seg id="1216">"I learned to read, write and speak English well."</seg>
<seg id="1217">"he always shared his knowledge with anyone who asked. he taught other prisoners to read, write and speak English."</seg>
<seg id="1218">Bassel opened my door to technology. he taught me to use both computers and smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="1219">He brought me the internet.</seg>
<seg id="1220">"he also taught other prisoners as they use computers, at least theoretically, without actually holding one in their hands."</seg>
<seg id="1221">"Ghazi is also the author of Waiting (waiting), a book that she wrote in the years 2012 to 2015 her husband when he was in custody."</seg>
<seg id="1222">Bassel and Noura worked together in the book for a year.</seg>
<seg id="1223">She smuggled the lyrics to him when she visited him and he translated it from Arabic to English.</seg>

<seg id="1255">"Mozambique reacted with anger at a corruption attack, where a member of the government returned to the workplace in the state apparatus after half of his sentence."</seg>
<seg id="1256">"this is Diodino Cambaza, who was arrested in 2008 and was sentenced to 22 years in prison with four other defendants, due to deprivation of 54 million Metikal (around 800 000 euros)."</seg>
<seg id="1257">"the money came from public funds from the airports of Mozambique, whose advice was Cambaza between 2005 and 2008."</seg>
<seg id="1258">Cambaza was released in 2016 because of good leadership and immediately called for his re-adjustment to the company what happened on the 19th of April.</seg>
<seg id="1259">"in accordance with a statement issued by the General Prosecutor of the Republic who submitted the application, there would be no obstacle for Cambaza to return to its old post since the firm did not undertake disciplinary proceedings following his imprisonment."</seg>
<seg id="1260">"however, many inhabitants are not doing the action well."</seg>
<seg id="1261">"the Centre for Public Integrity (Centro de Integridade Pública, short CIP), a local institution committed to public transparency, in an interview with Deutsche Welle denounced the decision of the company to set up the director:"</seg>
<seg id="1262">"represents a setback in the fight against corruption and illustrates the lack of transparency and is even a step in terms of the efforts of our legal system, such as the CIP."</seg>
<seg id="1263">What we are aware of is that the company should also have a disciplinary procedure against the reluctant.</seg>
<seg id="1264">"the company, however, seems to be and causes no reasonable legal steps to apply the corresponding functions."</seg>
<seg id="1265">"Egídio Vaz, a significant voice in the Muslim social media, also rejects this behavior and considers the case as" "disgusting" ":"</seg>
<seg id="1266">"if Cambaza would be a competent guy, he would be adviser after he was sentenced to a prison sentence, and half of which has been cut off."</seg>
<seg id="1267">"he could keep paid lectures and motivating speeches, he could advise and polish his image."</seg>
<seg id="1268">"but since he is incompetent, he has agreed to be reintegrated into the company that he helped to inflict damage."</seg>
<seg id="1269">Consequently it is obvious: Cambaza is often paid for his silence.</seg>

<seg id="1271">"Bitone Viage, young Mozambique and student of political science in Brazil said, the director does not occupy any morals:"</seg>

<seg id="1273">"Cambaza lacks morals to return and serve the state * he had already had a unique opportunity to serve the state, but instead only served by the state itself."</seg>
<seg id="1274">Cambaza used the state as a handheld it was an inexhaustible source of money and the state itself has become tired of this man who was charged and finally sentenced to a long sentence.</seg>
<seg id="1275">"honestly, I don't know why this man was so rewarding."</seg>

<seg id="1287">"the Burmese word" "Kalar pae" "means chickpeas or fishers."</seg>
<seg id="1288">"photo by Sanjay Acharya, Wikipedia Commons, Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 Unported"</seg>
<seg id="1289">"according to Facebook users in Myanmar, the well-known social network took their posts from the net because they contained the word 'Kalar'."</seg>
<seg id="1290">"although the origin of the word is still being discussed, it is usually used to refer to people of East-Indian origin or generally used as an adjective" Indian. ""</seg>
<seg id="1291">"Facebook censored the word" "Kalar" "or" "Kalar" "as part of an initiative to address the widespread problem of hate speech in Burma in the social network."</seg>
<seg id="1292">"in recent years, the rise of radical nationalist movements has given the word an extremely negative connotation."</seg>
<seg id="1293">"in particular, it is a word that is mostly used by ultra-nationalists as hate speech against Muslims who represent a minority of the population in Myanmar."</seg>
<seg id="1294">"but in efforts to combat hate speech in Myanmar, the company has censored a lot of meaningful content on its platform."</seg>
<seg id="1295">"Kalar'may normally be associated with racism, but the word itself does not automatically call up to hate speech."</seg>
<seg id="1296">Context is important & # 8212; many people have reported that even posts in which they discussed the use of the word or have expressed doubts about their use.</seg>
<seg id="1297">"moreover, there are several burmesan words with basic meanings, which have the same letter as' Kalar '."</seg>
<seg id="1298">"for example, chair is written on Burmesan also 'Kalar htaing', which contains the same letters as well as other words like 'Kalar pae', 'Kalar Oat' (Kamel) or 'kalarkaar' (curtain)."</seg>
<seg id="1299">The Facebook user Aung Kaung Myat explained the different meanings of words with the sound of 'Kalar':</seg>
<seg id="1300">A post of one of my friends was deleted today because he contained the word Kalar.</seg>
<seg id="1301">"however, he asked his friends in a witty way whether they knew how to alleviate his back pain by making a word play."</seg>
<seg id="1302">"the set of ku la -" cure "(ku) + the question word (la) at Burmesisch - resembles the racist expression, but the context is completely different."</seg>
<seg id="1303">There were several responses to the Facebook initiative.</seg>
<seg id="1304">"Zin Win Htet is the opinion that she will reduce hate speech to radical nationalists, but also emphasised that Facebook needed to be analytic before it extinguishes all the posts that were suspected of spreading racism."</seg>
<seg id="1305">Facebook does not delete the word "Kalar" manually.</seg>
<seg id="1306">It filters the word automatically.</seg>
<seg id="1307">Automatism will not understand what you write to Facbeook.</seg>
<seg id="1308">What it should do instead is to analyze the post carefully and control it by checking the adjacent words.</seg>
<seg id="1309">"for example," "Kalar Htine" "(chair) and" "Kalar pae". ""</seg>
<seg id="1310">"the good is that these dirty nationalists, who spread hate speech, get a fairly good lesson."</seg>
<seg id="1311">Now it is time to circumcise their nationalism.</seg>
<seg id="1312">"while the action may send a strong signal to everyone who will spread hate speech, the efficiency of this strategy may not last long."</seg>
<seg id="1313">"the experiences of social networks in China such as Sina Weibo and WeChat have proven that the censorship of keywords is often a cat and mouse game, whereby the users of social networks simply start using a new word or alternative writing of censored word to express their views."</seg>
<seg id="1314">"the author Aung Kaung Myat described how Facebook began to delete his posts, when he only wanted to tell his friends that the word 'Kalar' was banned from the social network:"</seg>
<seg id="1315">"when I was aware of this new Facebook guideline, I made a post to tell my Facebook friends that the word is locked."</seg>
<seg id="1316">"ironically, my post was removed from Facebook and told me that the posting, posts and sharing of content for 24 hours underlines, because the post" "Facebook Community standards" "didn't meet the standards."</seg>
<seg id="1317">Facebook has a wide variety of posts from people who have no negative intentions or who simply try to show their opinions against the hate speech of radical nationalists.</seg>
<seg id="1318">"Patrick Murphy wrote that his post was removed, who has nothing to do with hate speech:"</seg>
<seg id="1319">Post without hate speech from Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="1320">"in the post, the author told his opinion about why extreme nationalism and religious fundamentalism in the country are bad."</seg>
<seg id="1321">"Chan Myae Khine believes that Facebook should have done more before the start of the initiative, for example the Burmese Internet Community to ask for advice:"</seg>
<seg id="1322">"Facebook likes to have a benevolent intention to reduce racism in Burma through their platform, but it does not work."</seg>
<seg id="1323">Censoring such words will only bring more hatred within the various communities.</seg>
<seg id="1324">"in addition, it seems that they have started this without a local context or technical support and have banned words like" chair "or" pea curry. ""</seg>
<seg id="1325">"even when they found out that they made mistakes, they did not try to correct the fake posts."</seg>
<seg id="1326">"if they had only slightly more respect for the 15 million benefits, which gave them a big turnover, that would be great."</seg>
<seg id="1327">Facebook automatic censorship has caused a lot of ridicule among users.</seg>
<seg id="1328">"instead of taking it seriously, users now make fun of Facebook and consciously write the word 'Kalar' not in the context of hate speech to see if their posts are taken from the web."</seg>
<seg id="1329">"here you can see some screenshots of Facebook posts, which no hate speech contained, but still removed:"</seg>
<seg id="1330">Used with permission.</seg>
<seg id="1331">The Burmese text reads "I want to sit on a chair and eat peas curry and watch an Indian film.</seg>

<seg id="1336">"over the past five years, extreme nationalist ideologies and religious fundamentalists who have used social networks to expand their voices and influence has increased."</seg>
<seg id="1337">"among other things, hate speech in social networks shall additionally heat violence in the congregations in Myanmar, especially in the area of Rakhine, where confrontations between Muslims and Buddhists have forced thousands to flee."</seg>
<seg id="1338">"Facebook was criticised for his failure to control, criticising hate speech on his burmesan sites."</seg>

<seg id="1347">"statistics of the UN for 2002-2012 show that the proportion of children who had already been married to 15 were 2.8 percent in Trinidad and Tobago, and with 18 were 8.1 percent."</seg>
<seg id="1348">"in 2011, the country's statistical office confirmed that more than 8400 girls and 1300 boys under 19 were married since 1997-2007."</seg>
<seg id="1349">"online petitions and social media movements that were anxious to abolish laws on children's marriage, followed at the foot and pleased with great support. undoubtedly, they helped bring about this outcome."</seg>
<seg id="1350">"nevertheless, not everything went smoothly."</seg>
<seg id="1351">"for example, a Hindu guide, for example, had no hesitation to say the criticisms of the children's marriage, they ought to take care of their own affairs."</seg>
<seg id="1352">"this kind of religious opposition was anxious for tensions in this uncomplicated matter, and at some point doubts arise whether the opposition would agree to the bill in general."</seg>
<seg id="1353">"but at the beginning of 2017 the bill was decided against the children's marriage - despite 4 Senators (including a woman) of the opposition and an independent who could be discussed, so that he could be discussed in the House of Representatives, where a simple majority would make him a law."</seg>
<seg id="1354">Now only the president of the country must agree and announce the law.</seg>
<seg id="1355">"one of the Senators of the country gave on Facebook a status update, which Leslie-Ann Boiselle posted again on Instagram:"</seg>

<seg id="1394">Day by day becomes more clear how important the platform for users is to find and share helpful information as well as reliable information.</seg>
<seg id="1395">Both students and reporters and fans of TV series fight against the blocking.</seg>
<seg id="1396">"although many advanced Internet users are used to using conversion tools for blocked websites (a recent article from the New York Times reports that Turkey has the third largest VPN prevalence), most of the usual Wikipedia users do not fall into this category."</seg>
<seg id="1397">"although Turkey has been blocked by Wikipedia since 2008, as recently published in a published report by Berkman Klein Center for Internet & amp; Society at Harvard University, regular blockages of the Internet have been held since 2007, after the internet law (No. 5651) was adopted."</seg>

<seg id="1399">"while the platform continues to be blocked, several mirrorfaces (pages that reflect the contents of Wikipedia and are often updated) are surfaced."</seg>
<seg id="1400">"a solution came from IPFS (the Interplanetary File System), when the platform deposited all Turkish Wikipedia pages on its decentralized peer-to-peer network, which is not based on the system of domain names and thus makes a complete censorship difficult."</seg>
<seg id="1401">"in spite of legal prohibition, the content is retrievable."</seg>
<seg id="1402">In a blog post IPFS reports about his efforts:</seg>
<seg id="1403">"after we heard the news (about the blocking of Wikipedia), we set everything to lay snapshots from Wikipedia to the IPFS platform. thus, it is possible to read the content on decentralized and distributed fashion."</seg>

<seg id="1405">"IPFS also admitted that this step was carried out independently of the Wikimedia Foundation, and it is merely screenshots and no live or dynamic versions of the website."</seg>

<seg id="1417">"Sagar Giri was never satisfied with the photos he saw around her, they were blurred with poorly positioned motifs and washed colours."</seg>
<seg id="1418">This motivates him to carry a camera with himself and try to graze the situation.</seg>
<seg id="1419">At that time he was still a child.</seg>
<seg id="1420">"today, at the age of 28, Sagar tries to bring Nepalese wildlife to the international stage."</seg>
<seg id="1421">"right next to Chitwan National Park, his hometown offers him the perfect opportunity to shoot photographs that draw attention to Nepal's wildlife."</seg>
<seg id="1422">"on Facebook, he described this first-class position in his work:"</seg>
<seg id="1423">"I live at the edge of Chitwan National Park, a world natural heritage. what could be better for a passionate wildlife photographer!!"</seg>
<seg id="1424">I just rested at home when suddenly Navarre (the manager of Chitwan Gaida Lodge) called me. he had received a call from my father that on the banks of the Rapti river a leopard would be.</seg>
<seg id="1425">The river damm is only a few minutes away from the tourist resort of Sauraha.</seg>
<seg id="1426">Immediately I ran with my camera and was there in a few minutes.</seg>
<seg id="1427">My father watched him and showed me the place on the other river side where the leopard was and I began to kneel pictures immediately!!</seg>
<seg id="1428">"Sagar aims to cooperate with the authorities in order to gain worldwide recognition for Nepalese nature, and would like to deepen the understanding that wild animals are not as frightening as they look."</seg>
<seg id="1429">"and he should know, for he had already stood face to face with tigers:"</seg>

<seg id="1434">"to promote the protection of wild animals, Sagar placed the logo" I click for conservation "(lit.: I click for environmental protection) on his photos."</seg>
<seg id="1435">"however, his passion for the promotion of Nepalese nature and wildlife is not always easy."</seg>
<seg id="1436">"he waited for 22 days, and mostly lived in a tent to take pictures of Ottern in the Bardia National Park. up to 12 days it took until he could photograph a tiger and live six to seven days for the perfect photo of birds, which live near the tourist accommodation."</seg>

<seg id="1469">"this article was written by Kayonaaz Kalyzera and was originally published on Video Volunteers, an award-winning international community media organization from India."</seg>
<seg id="1470">A revised version was published here as part of a content sharing agreement.</seg>
<seg id="1471">"in many parts of India, women avoid with the greatest care to pronounce the name of their husbands or even from older men in the family."</seg>
<seg id="1472">"instead, they use a pronouns or say" father of my child. ""</seg>
<seg id="1473">"from Chhattisgarh to Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh, women admit that they should respect the husband because of social pressure, as well as fear of the consequences they should abstain from the norm."</seg>
<seg id="1474">"last year, Malati Mahatoto from the Indian state Odisha was convicted by a fake court and expelled from her family and the village community after having responded to a married family with names."</seg>
<seg id="1475">"the tradition also does not name their wives by name, is also widespread among men. however, they have far less warranties to fear, if at all, they should not follow this practice."</seg>
<seg id="1476">"in the small village of Walhe in the district Pune, in Maharashtra, nine women, including health personnel as well as housewives, a unique club and were thus quickly becoming the main theme of the city."</seg>
<seg id="1477">It is a place only for them alone where they can discuss and discuss the intricacies of the patriarchy.</seg>
<seg id="1478">"as one of 56 clubs, which exist in 13 Indian states, he is part of the campaign # KhelBadal, which is operated by the Community Video Volunteers and is committed to the degradation of the patriarchy."</seg>
<seg id="1479">"Rohini Pahas worked for seven years with the help of her video camera at the discovery of practices, such as children's marriage to the exile of HIV- and AIDS-infected, and guides these clubs."</seg>
<seg id="1480">She tells about how these clubs have created a safe place for these women and at the same time have made them into ambassadors of the change.</seg>
<seg id="1481">"the first video, which Rohini showed in her discussion round, was of women who did not name their husbands by name."</seg>
<seg id="1482">She chose this subject because she wanted to open the conversation about the patriarchy with a problem with which women can easily identify.</seg>
<seg id="1483">"not to pronounce the name of their husbands loudly, it is a custom which they have duly maintained and never questioned."</seg>
<seg id="1484">= = = &gt; Skylynx</seg>
<seg id="1485">This tradition testifies that a woman respects her husband and wishes him a long life.</seg>
<seg id="1486">"a woman who does not respect this will be regarded as deceitful, as a woman without morality."</seg>
<seg id="1487">The tradition is so deeply rooted that we never thought about this discussion.</seg>
<seg id="1488">"Rohini, who had never called her husband so far, wanted to try out at home as it runs."</seg>
<seg id="1489">She showed the video of the discussion round her husband and her mother-in-law.</seg>
<seg id="1490">Rohini tells:</seg>
<seg id="1491">My mother-in-law and my husband kept silent for a long time after the video was over.</seg>
<seg id="1492">"Prakash, my husband, turned to me and said that I should call him from now on his name."</seg>
<seg id="1493">Rohini started their first discussion club with this self-confidence in the luggage.</seg>
<seg id="1494">"many women had never heard the word" patriarchy "never before. some believed it was a good thing, because it meant that the younger members of a family, especially girls and women, would be protected."</seg>
<seg id="1495">"at the beginning of the round, Rohini showed a video about the problem in Uttar Pradesh."</seg>
<seg id="1496">"after the video projection, the women tried to get the discussion with an exercise."</seg>
<seg id="1497">"Rohini asked each participant to tell the name of her husband with different feelings - happy, annoyed, sad, loving and so on."</seg>
<seg id="1498">"then she asked everyone," "If we cannot say the name of our husbands, but they can call us how they want, does it mean that they don't respect us?"</seg>
<seg id="1499">"should it not be equal?" ""</seg>
<seg id="1500">"some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day in which they brought the name of their husbands over their lips," "says Rohini Paz from the village of Walhe in Maharashtra over the crusher of a secular tradition, in which married women can never pronounce the name of her husbands."</seg>
<seg id="1501">Rohini tells:</seg>
<seg id="1502">"a woman was so shy, that during the whole exercise she was just sitting in front of herself; another decided to let the whole stump frustration come out against him and his family by cursed him."</seg>
<seg id="1503">The expression on her faces was ecstatic.</seg>
<seg id="1504">I think I will never forget it again.</seg>
<seg id="1505">"still in the adrenaline rush of having broken with an old custom, women decided that they would actually attempt at home to name their husbands by name."</seg>
<seg id="1506">And they kept their word.</seg>
<seg id="1507">"in the next few days, Rohini received a lot of reports."</seg>
<seg id="1508">The husband of a woman called Rohini and asked what ideas she put to her head: his wife could not stop saying his name.</seg>
<seg id="1509">Another club member decided to do it during dinner before the whole family.</seg>
<seg id="1510">"when her mother-in-law stared her, she was afraid and said it was a mistake."</seg>
<seg id="1511">"another woman said," "Rohini said I should do it."</seg>
<seg id="1512">A husband of a participant was less understanding and the situation came out of violence.</seg>
<seg id="1513">"Rohini reports how women tried to stop other practices, such as wearing the zinnoberred dot on the forehead that shows the spouses:"</seg>
<seg id="1514">Why do women only have to show that they are married?</seg>
<seg id="1515">"I said to my husband, that I would wear the zinnoberred point if he did it too."</seg>
<seg id="1516">He laughed only and I stopped wearing it.</seg>
<seg id="1517">"the other women have not completely stopped, but think they are now in a better position to choose themselves, not to wear it on some days."</seg>
<seg id="1518">"for many women, the discussion club is a safe place where they can exchange opinions and goals."</seg>
<seg id="1519">"" "we make a trip every time in the discussion club."</seg>
<seg id="1520">Normally we pack lunch and water and go out to the field.</seg>
<seg id="1521">"I don't want the women to worry about who they could hear," she says. "</seg>
<seg id="1522">In the last months they celebrated their own birthdays with cakes for the first time; they danced and sang about things that they had never thought before.</seg>
<seg id="1523">Rohini says:</seg>
<seg id="1524">"I have been working on these problems for so many years and yet I have never talked about some things, for example as our identities to our husbands."</seg>
<seg id="1525">"it feels great to say certain things, no matter how small they occur."</seg>
<seg id="1526">"in a discussion round, we talked about the concept of honor and how it is connected to the clothes."</seg>
<seg id="1527">Some women in the group have only worn saris since their marriage.</seg>
<seg id="1528">"for most this is okay, but some wanted to wear a Salmon-Kurta, a wide shirt over a pants, they have not dared."</seg>
<seg id="1529">"after much dispute and discussion about the advantages of his own dress code, morality linked to saris and much more, Rohini made her own pair of Kurtas (Oberhemden) into a round of discussion so that women could wear them."</seg>
<seg id="1530">"next, they decided to plan a trip to Goa where they can wear jeans and Rohini is sure they will create it."</seg>
<seg id="1531">"on the question whether in the five months since its first discussion club has changed something, Rohini confirms that things are slowly coming into roles:"</seg>
<seg id="1532">"so far, we have only made small steps."</seg>
<seg id="1533">"some women tried it a few times, but then they stopped saying the name of her husband."</seg>
<seg id="1534">"some, including me, do not make it, but only if they are alone and no other family members are involved."</seg>
<seg id="1535">Only one or two women continue to say the name of their husbands; only one or two women are now wearing Zinnoberrot on their forehead.</seg>
<seg id="1536">Women in the discussion club know that the changes they want to achieve in their lives - like the Feilschen for more freedom of movement or the own dress code - lie at the end of a hard to navigating river.</seg>
<seg id="1537">"by giving each other self-confidence, they are aware that they are sitting in the same boat."</seg>
<seg id="1538">How Rohini explains:</seg>
<seg id="1539">Each of us is a sacrifice of patriarchy.</seg>
<seg id="1540">I am it too.</seg>
<seg id="1541">But this club gives each of us the confidence that something will change.</seg>
<seg id="1542">"and I know that it is not only limited to 30 families. there will be a chain reaction, when each woman goes home in the club and told other people about what we are talking about and what we do."</seg>
<seg id="1543">We all sit in the same boat.</seg>
<seg id="1544">The correspondents of the Video Volunteers Community come from marginalized groups in India and make videos about stories about which are not reported.</seg>
<seg id="1545">"these stories are" "messages from those who experience them themselves," "and offer a hyperlocal context to report global human rights and development challenges."</seg>

<seg id="1587">One of the victims was beheaded and a part of the organs had been removed.</seg>

<seg id="1590">It is the first time successive attacks on smooth-headed men were registered in Mozambique.</seg>
<seg id="1591">"another group, the goal of assassinations for obscure purposes, is people with albinism."</seg>

<seg id="1628">The following version will be published as part of a partnership agreement via Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="1629">"the case of the detained Chinese dissidents Liu Xiaobo has drawn attention to the international community after his lawyer, at the end of June, announced that he was hospitalized to the hospital because of liver cancer."</seg>
<seg id="1630">"in 2009, Liu was sentenced to eleven years in prison for" "Subversion" "because he participated in the draft of the Charter 08, a manifesto which demands democratic reforms in China."</seg>
<seg id="1631">He was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010.</seg>
<seg id="1632">"the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in China referred to the case as" "an internal affair" "and told a spokesman that he considered it" "not necessary to discuss this matter with any other country."</seg>
<seg id="1633">"nevertheless, China continues to release calls from the international community, Nobel Peace Laureate and his wife, poet Liu Xia, or to permit him to be treated abroad."</seg>
<seg id="1634">"while some countries criticized the strict treatment of the couple in Beijing, others are completely wiped out of the subject."</seg>

<seg id="1636">United Nations</seg>
<seg id="1637">"Zeid Ra-ad al-Hussein, the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, met Chinese officials at the end of June to discuss the case of Liu."</seg>

<seg id="1639">Norway</seg>
<seg id="1640">Norwegian Prime Minister Erna Solberg and Foreign Minister Børge Brende have refused to answer questions about Lius release.</seg>
<seg id="1641">"the relationship between China and Norway came to the shock after the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to Liu, although the Norwegian Government informed that this ultimately has nothing to do with the decision."</seg>
<seg id="1642">"diplomatic relations were continued until December last year. only in June Norway signed an agreement to resume salmon exports to China, as exports have been largely blocked since 2010."</seg>
<seg id="1643">"after the news spread that Liu was seriously ill, the Nobel Committee expressed his hope for an unconditional release and invited Liu to take his prize in Oslo."</seg>
<seg id="1644">"due to his imprisonment, he was unable to accept his prize."</seg>
<seg id="1645">During the ceremony Liu was represented by an empty chair.</seg>

<seg id="1654">"the invitation of the US embassy drew a furious response from China, with the utterance of the Foreign Ministry that" no country has the right to interfere and make irresponsible comments about Chinese internal affairs. "</seg>
<seg id="1655">Polley shared that China should offer the following couple:</seg>
<seg id="1656">"protection and freedom, such as travel freedom and access to the medical care of its choice, which they claim according to Chinese constitution and legal system as well as international obligations."</seg>

<seg id="1683">Is Singapore a city or country?</seg>
<seg id="1684">"the question may seem silly, since Singapore is recognised as an independent state on an international level."</seg>
<seg id="1685">"but according to the Minister of Justice K. Shanmugam, Singapore should be considered a city."</seg>
<seg id="1686">This remark has triggered a debate in the blogosphere.</seg>
<seg id="1687">"during the meeting on the occasion of a meeting of the international branch of the Bar Association of the State of New York, the Minister noted that many people criticized the dominance of the only political party of Singapore because they were compared to Singapore with other countries."</seg>
<seg id="1688">He supported that Singapore should be considered a city.</seg>
<seg id="1689">... no one has questioned whether New York is a democracy...</seg>
<seg id="1690">This is what most people commit a mistake.</seg>
<seg id="1691">I have tried to explain that we are different.</seg>
<seg id="1692">We are a city.</seg>
<seg id="1693">We are not a country.</seg>
<seg id="1694">The blog Cavalierio accused the Minister of Justice to "twist the logic" to defend the existing authoritarian exercise of power in Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="1695">"and then, after all our efforts and sacrificings to create this valuable land, we can say that ultimately we are not a country."</seg>
<seg id="1696">"it sounded so vulgar, it had the appearance of an escape from the responsibilities, an obligation injury."</seg>
<seg id="1697">"Singapore, if you are not my country, whose country is it then?"</seg>
<seg id="1698">"the reasons mentioned by Shanmugam were not very nobel: he defended an idea according to which one could not measure the political system of Singapore with other 'normal countries', in the face of that, it inevitably appeared undemocratic."</seg>
<seg id="1699">"on the other hand, he defended the idea that Singapore should be compared to cities such as Chicago, San Francisco or New York, equally cities that are permanently run by a party."</seg>
<seg id="1700">These cities are democratic.</seg>
<seg id="1701">"as soon as one reaches the core point of the topic, the good old lyre of the authoritarian rulers appear to be pretending democrats, leaving the twisted logic because it fits better to their power."</seg>
<seg id="1702">"in the end, the answers to his American guests in the last week were given answers to his American guests regarding our press, our itdicative, our political system."</seg>
<seg id="1703">He warned him with non-answers rational species.</seg>
<seg id="1704">Rachel Zeng calls for Shanmugam to clarify his opinions as she did not understand this conclusion.</seg>
<seg id="1705">I personally find it a bit difficult to swallow.</seg>
<seg id="1706">"if Singapore is not a country, but a city, so to which country is our city..."</seg>
<seg id="1707">"in short, I don't understand anything."</seg>
<seg id="1708">"I would be very grateful if our werter K Shanmugam would take the effort to clarify this point, if he was paid high to be part of the government of the city of Singapore."</seg>
<seg id="1709">"by posting his comment on the blog, he points out the criticisms that one should start reading the whole transcript of the conference so that one could better understand the context of the statements made by Shanmugam, according to which Singapore was a city and not a country."</seg>
<seg id="1710">Read the transcript.</seg>
<seg id="1711">"when he said that Singapore was more of a" city "than a country," he explained why the Singapore elections were so uneven important even if we enjoy free and just choices. "</seg>
<seg id="1712">He compared Singapore with cities in the US (and how many of these cities saw a party for decades?).</seg>
<seg id="1713">"as he said, Singapore is not a country," he obviously does not mean it in this sense! "</seg>
<seg id="1714">"Clement Tan shows his disappointment about Shanmugam, who as leader of a growing generation, makes such a polemical statement."</seg>
<seg id="1715">I am very embarrassed about what the Minister of Justice has said of Singapore...</seg>
<seg id="1716">"at least I knew with Lee Kuan Yew and the members of the old Garde, what I expected - whether I agree with them or not, but that's another thing."</seg>
<seg id="1717">"but with K. Shanmugam, member of the new generation of the new generation of the political leaders of Singapore, I have doubts and I'm not even sure if he really believes it is right and aware of what he defends."</seg>
<seg id="1718">The TEMASEK Review decomposes the weak points of Shanmugams's arguments:</seg>
<seg id="1719">"did Mr. Shanmugam did a mistake, or was it a Freudian spokesman?"</seg>
<seg id="1720">"if Singapore is not a country, we are regarded only as an independent and sovereign state?"</seg>
<seg id="1721">"if not, on which country are the sovereign rights of the city of Singapore back?"</seg>
<seg id="1722">"Singapore is unique, it is equally land and city."</seg>
<seg id="1723">"as he plays an important role within the cabinet, the statements of Mr. Shanmugam are of serious importance."</seg>
<seg id="1724">"why do the people of Singapore afford their military service, they only defend their city, but not their country?"</seg>
<seg id="1725">Whom must our Prime Minister have to pay invoices?</seg>
<seg id="1726">What is the value of our pink staff ID?</seg>
<seg id="1727">Are we citizens of a country or the inhabitants of a city?</seg>
<seg id="1728">"journey Journey of a Decade to Bejahung, Singapore is and always has been a city:"</seg>
<seg id="1729">I did not say what I said...</seg>
<seg id="1730">This sentence seems to have annoyed many Singapurer...</seg>
<seg id="1731">Nobody ever said that Singapore is a country.</seg>
<seg id="1732">We were always a city.</seg>
<seg id="1733">We have always been a city / island state.</seg>
<seg id="1734">"I can understand that we often hear statements like" the defense of the country, above all, "etc, but that is not quite right."</seg>
<seg id="1735">We should rather speak of the defence of the city.</seg>

<seg id="1741">"the latest part of this series comes from Nevin Thompson, editor for Global Voices Japan, who lives in Canada and Japan."</seg>
<seg id="1742">The question that is most asked to me in Japan is: "are you Americans?"</seg>
<seg id="1743">"no, I'm sorry," I answered. "I'm from Canada." since 1994 I live and back in Japan. "</seg>
<seg id="1744">"depending on the situation the conversation takes place, it is considered polite to show interest in his interlocutor by asking personal questions."</seg>
<seg id="1745">"my clarification then usually follows the standard answer:" Oh, Rocky Mountains, ice hockey, nature. "many Canadians cook inwardly with anger when they are held for Americans, but they don't bother me."</seg>
<seg id="1746">"for someone who doesn't know himself, there is little that distinguishes us Canadians from Americans."</seg>
<seg id="1747">This is one of the reasons why so many Canadians get a Canadian flag visible on their rucksack when they travel.</seg>
<seg id="1748">All dear Canadians.</seg>
<seg id="1749">Americans on the other hand....</seg>
<seg id="1750">"so it was already when I began to travel through the world 20 years ago - before Donald Trump, before the invasion of Iraq and before September 11."</seg>

<seg id="1756">We are polite.</seg>
<seg id="1757">We obviously say very often "apologies."</seg>
<seg id="1758">Canada is also considered to be the most tolerant country against ethnic groups.</seg>
<seg id="1759">We are not as these guys south of the border.</seg>
<seg id="1760">We Canadians are nice.</seg>
<seg id="1761">I hate that.</seg>
<seg id="1762">"first, I have many American friends that I admire very much."</seg>
<seg id="1763">There wouldn't be anything to me if you would switch to Johnny from Dallas for example.</seg>
<seg id="1764">With Marc from Austin.</seg>
<seg id="1765">With Adam from San Francisco.</seg>
<seg id="1766">Or with Michael from Honolulu.</seg>
<seg id="1767">But there are also some problems with the stamp "nice."</seg>
<seg id="1768">"first: being called" "nice" "means to be fun - just like the good-natured, gentle but tragically insignificant figure Ned Flanders from" Die Simpsons "(which has its own Canadian Doppelgänger)."</seg>
<seg id="1769">"if Canada really would be a nation full of people like Ned Flanders, that would indeed be a step forward. but the real problem is that" "nice" "has no personality."</seg>
<seg id="1770">"there are no corners and edges, nothing you can encounter."</seg>
<seg id="1771">Being harmless is to be inconspicuous and uninteresting and not deserve attention.</seg>
<seg id="1772">"this can be a good thing if you want to stay unnoticed in the background, away from things that happen around one."</seg>
<seg id="1773">"I would even go as far as to say that the desire to be free and alone, is a main part of Canadians."</seg>
<seg id="1774">We tend to take care of our own affairs only.</seg>
<seg id="1775">"what outsiders call" "nice" "is perhaps just cool courtesy."</seg>
<seg id="1776">Canadians do not often talk about the fence with the neighbors.</seg>
<seg id="1777">"we lack the warm, open friendliness that I have meanwhile joined with my American friends."</seg>

<seg id="1780">"a pop band celebrated in Thailand has released a music video, which parodizes the Junta, which in 2014 realizes the power, and in spite of its promise to restore the civic government, continues to rule the country."</seg>
<seg id="1781">"the new song" Dictator Girl "(Phadet Girl) of the band Tattoo Colour describes a young man who tells the instructions he makes his girlfriend.</seg>
<seg id="1782">"although not specifically politically, the music video refers indirectly to the continuing military rule of the junta."</seg>
<seg id="1783">The band was praised by many fans and other Internet users for their courage to describe the situation of the country.</seg>

<seg id="1786">"last month, even the Charlie Chaplin video" The Dictator "was blocked in Thailand after a group of activists encouraged the public to watch this video."</seg>
<seg id="1787">"the video can be interpreted as a creative and entertaining introduction to Thai politics, in particular how it behaves with the situation of the country under the Junta rule."</seg>
<seg id="1788">Have a look at these recordings of the video that relate to some of the political issues that Thailand has persistently pursued over the past three years.</seg>
<seg id="1789">"the" 44 rules of the girls "may refer to the draconian section 44 of the provisional constitution, which grants absolute decision-making over important national issues."</seg>
<seg id="1790">"the 11th rule:" "change your attitude" "refers to the notorious program of" "adjustment change" "of journalists, students, scientists, activists, politicians and other persons considered by the Junta as critics."</seg>
<seg id="1791">"the image above reflects the introduction of the law on computer crime, whose vague and unclear rules are often exploited by the authorities to arrest activists and other critics of the state."</seg>
<seg id="1792">"for this purpose, a new unit in the army has also been set up, the online content guarded and persons who are accused of having denied the monarchy is prosecuted."</seg>
<seg id="1793">Thailand sets a strict term against "" Lese Majority "" (majesty). "</seg>
<seg id="1794">"on 20 May 2014, the war law was proclaimed in Thailand."</seg>
<seg id="1795">Two days later it came to a coup of the army.</seg>
<seg id="1796">"one of the problems that the Junta continued to pursue is to buy expensive submarines, although security experts warned that the purchase is unnecessary and a waste of tax money."</seg>
<seg id="1797">"the video even shows how people are thrown into a black delivery van, before putting them into an internment camp, another problem."</seg>
<seg id="1798">"some journalists are in prison because they allegedly caused" "confusion" "in society and Internet users are threatened with long sentences, they should enquire the monarchy."</seg>
<seg id="1799">"meanwhile, the teaser of the songs showed members of the band that imitated the Salut of" The Tribute of Panem, "which was already used by putsch opponents during the protests in 2014."</seg>

<seg id="1898">"on the way of migrants who cross Europe or Latin America, certain places for their hospitality are known."</seg>
<seg id="1899">I visited one of these places in the Mexican city of Tapachula and is located at the border to Guatemala.</seg>
<seg id="1900">It is a very simple hotel near the city centre.</seg>
<seg id="1901">"it is led by a 59-year-old Mexican woman, a small woman with a coral pink Brillengestell and gold colored earrings in teddy bear form."</seg>
<seg id="1902">"she is called Concepción González Ramírez, and was born in Tapachula and grew up there. nevertheless, they know many under the name Mama Africa."</seg>
<seg id="1903">This nickname is the fact that the hotel (or rather it) has become a target for Africans and Haitians who are on transit.</seg>
<seg id="1904">The hotel does not have any charm.</seg>
<seg id="1905">"for about 2.50 dollars, the guests sleep in simple rooms, with bare, crumbling walls and beds made of metal."</seg>
<seg id="1906">In the anteroom there is a parrot in a cage.</seg>
<seg id="1907">There is no sign for the hotel - nevertheless hundreds of African and Haitian migrants come here.</seg>
<seg id="1908">"sometimes, Mrs. Ramírez, the people come in full minibuses and from the upper part of the coast they start calling:" "Mama Africa!"</seg>
<seg id="1909">Where are you Mum Africa?.</seg>
<seg id="1910">"at the moment it is rather quiet, but this year Ramírez has already received 200 guests at the same time."</seg>
<seg id="1911">"there are only 24 rooms, some have also slept outdoors on board."</seg>
<seg id="1912">She does not want to reject anyone.</seg>
<seg id="1913">"she also helps them and brings them to the hospital when they are sick, she buys them medication they can't pay, she massages them with a balm that exhausted from the long journey."</seg>
<seg id="1914">"Tychicque Sebastiao, originally from Angola, has arrived recently."</seg>
<seg id="1915">I asked him if Mama Africa was an appropriate nickname for Mrs. Ramírez.</seg>
<seg id="1916">The family Sebastiao (with her daughter Merrui who has a Joghurtbart) posing with Concepción González Ramírez.</seg>
<seg id="1917">The family came from Angola to Brazil and hopes to go to Boston.</seg>
<seg id="1918">Foto: Amy Bracken.</seg>
<seg id="1919">"yes, yes," he answers with a smile. "I really feel that it suits you because African women are very nice women."</seg>
<seg id="1920">Very affectionate.</seg>
<seg id="1921">She has the cordiality of a mother...</seg>
<seg id="1922">We feel very comfortable here. "</seg>
<seg id="1923">Sebastiao travels with his sister who hopes to get to Boston to find her husband and the three children.</seg>
<seg id="1924">"they have lived in Brazil, but it is for some Africans who are on the way to the United States to make a first stop in South America and then pull towards the north."</seg>
<seg id="1925">"the family had heard of other companions of Mama Africa." "Mama Africa is a well-known name on the track," "explains Felix Michelet, a guest from Haiti."</seg>
<seg id="1926">"he tells us that the Haitians and Africans often travel the route together, and that the Africans are already speaking on Whatsapp from Mrs. Ramírez."</seg>
<seg id="1927">"like many of his companions, Michelet lived previously in Brazil and worked as a construction worker on construction sites of the Olympic Games and the Football World Cup."</seg>
<seg id="1928">"when the Brazilian economy became weaker, he started his journey to the United States."</seg>
<seg id="1929">He has been guest in Mama Africa for months: he sells SIM cards to save the necessary money to buy the bus ticket to Tijuana.</seg>
<seg id="1930">I wonder if he will have contact with Mrs. Ramírez in the future.</seg>
<seg id="1931">"Mama Africa is our mother and we never leave her again," he responds smiling. "we will always stay in touch."</seg>
<seg id="1932">Ramírez's wife tells that her guests often send text messages if they went to greet them or to report on the course of their journey.</seg>
<seg id="1933">She explains that her Christian faith is the drive of her work.</seg>
<seg id="1934">"she doesn't know much about Africa, but her guests have taught her to prepare chicken as in Ghana."</seg>
<seg id="1935">"Mrs. Ramírez is well known here, but she is not the only sparking hope for migrants travelling through tapachula."</seg>
<seg id="1936">At the other end of the city a dead end leads to Jesús Valenzuela.</seg>
<seg id="1937">"this winter, Valenzuela and his family have included migrants in their small house."</seg>
<seg id="1938">It is a policeman and has found that the bus tickets to numerous African migrants are sold too expensive.</seg>
<seg id="1939">"he started to help them to get a reasonable price, then he offered them his house for a dollar the night."</seg>
<seg id="1940">"at the moment there are 25 people, mainly Haitians."</seg>
<seg id="1941">"some sleep on the floor, but at least they have electricity, a washing machine and a cooking place outside."</seg>
<seg id="1942">Valenzuela explains that he knows what the guests are going through.</seg>
<seg id="1943">"I have lived in the United States," he says. "I have experienced what they experience."</seg>
<seg id="1944">I crossed the border over the desert and we suffered.</seg>
<seg id="1945">There are places where people can help and others not help. that's the reason why I give them my support.</seg>
<seg id="1946">"after having lived for three years, he was expelled from the United States after a raid on his job."</seg>
<seg id="1947">"the majority of migrants travelling through Tapachula comes from Central America, other residents also open the doors of their homes for them."</seg>
<seg id="1948">"José Antonio Cordova Meléndez tells me that he fled to Honduras with his wife and his three children, who wanted to blackmail him money without having a plan."</seg>
<seg id="1949">"in Tapachula, he asked for accommodation and an unknown person who is alone, has offered him a roof."</seg>
<seg id="1950">"a few months later, the family still lives there and she tries to decide where the next steps are to go."</seg>
<seg id="1951">Back in the house of Mama Africa everything is again full of guests.</seg>
<seg id="1952">"in the courses, the travellers consult quietly their phones."</seg>
<seg id="1953">"a minibus arrived today and has brought 20 new guests, a large majority of Somalia."</seg>
<seg id="1954">"Mrs. Ramírez seems happy that her house is full, but she is also nostalgic for those who have gone away."</seg>
<seg id="1955">Like a proud grandmother she flattens her in her album with numerous photos.</seg>
<seg id="1956">"there is one of her daughter with African hair care, who made her an Kundin, some photos of her grandchildren and many travelers more, boy and old."</seg>
<seg id="1957">She laughs sad as she briefly presents her to me.</seg>
<seg id="1958">"Ya se fueron," she repeated every time. "they have already gone."</seg>
<seg id="1959">China: Xinjiang inhabitants are forced to install a surveillance app on their mobile phones.</seg>
<seg id="1960">"a check-point for personal communication devices in Xinjang of Twitter users, as well as one of the most popular"</seg>
<seg id="1961">"the inhabitants of Xinjiang, an ethnic minority region in western China, are forced to install a spyware on their mobile phones."</seg>
<seg id="1962">"on July 10, the mobile user in the Tianshan District of the city of Urumqi received a mobile phone notification in which it instructs the district government to install a surveillance app named Jingwang (or" Web Cleaning ")."</seg>
<seg id="1963">"in the message, it is said that the app is to prevent access to terrorist information."</seg>
<seg id="1964">"however, the authorities would also use the app for more than the fight against terrorism."</seg>
<seg id="1965">"according to an exclusive report by Radio Free Asia, 10 Kazakh women were arrested in the autonomous Ili Kazakh prefecture because they, shortly after they had installed the app, had exchanged messages with a private chat group."</seg>
<seg id="1966">"the police said that the app would determine and follow the sources and distribution channels of terrorists, along with" illegal religious "activities and" harmful information "including videos, pictures, eBooks and documents."</seg>
<seg id="1967">Jingwangs's website describes the app as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1968">"Jingwang is a protection service with system categories for children and adults, introduced by Jiangsu Telecom."</seg>
<seg id="1969">"the main function is blocking of pornographic web pages, from online fraud, trojans and phishing pages to alert users how much time they spend online, and remotely control their home network."</seg>
<seg id="1970">This app with filters for minors is intended to help children develop a healthy lifestyle.</seg>
<seg id="1971">"of course, an app with these functions can be used in many ways."</seg>
<seg id="1972">"for example, the" remote control "could enable state actors or even hackers to manipulate or steal the home network of a person."</seg>
<seg id="1973">This introduction is consistent with other measures to control digital activities in this region.</seg>
<seg id="1974">"while messages about digital censorship in China focus mostly on the experiences of users in the larger cities in the east and south, reality is very often gloomy for those who live in remote, crowded ethnic minority regions such as Xinjiang and Tibet."</seg>
<seg id="1975">"to limit unrest and discontent in conflict areas, authorities often arrange extreme censors and surveillance measures as well as routine internet shutdowns."</seg>
<seg id="1976">"based on Twitter based Media Outlet images from China, the censored news published in China showed photos of a checkpoint, at which police officers checked the inhabitants randomly, whether they had installed the surveillance app."</seg>
<seg id="1977">The authorities in Xinjian make sure people use the official Jingwang app.</seg>
<seg id="1978">Mobile notifications required people to install the app within 10 days.</seg>
<seg id="1979">"if you are detected at a checkpoint with a device without this software, they could be detained up to 10 days."</seg>
<seg id="1980">This is a setback for technological development.</seg>
<seg id="1981">They have forced people to use devices that are meant for older people.</seg>
<seg id="1982">This is a form of captivity by the imaging technology.</seg>
<seg id="1983">We are back in Maos China.</seg>
<seg id="1984">"images from Auto China" ("" Favourites "") released a jingwang product description from which the software can lift up the password requirement of a Windows operating system, thereby receiving unlimited access to the computer's hard drive. "</seg>
<seg id="1985">"after installing Jingwang, computers and mobile phones are used in Xinjiang to electronic handcuffs."</seg>
<seg id="1986">The rules in Jingwang may be a reaction to the instructions of the City Council to minimize the dissemination of illegal content.</seg>
<seg id="1987">"all government branches, authorities and party-related institutions including universities and research institutions are obliged to follow the instructions of the Cybersecurity Office on the operation of their computers and communication devices."</seg>
<seg id="1988">"a recent report from Freedom House, a US-American human rights organisation, also mentioned these new monitoring methods:"</seg>
<seg id="1989">"in Xinjiang, on June 27, in a district of the regional capital of Urumqi, the authorities issued an ordinance to all residents and entrepreneurs to register their" personal ID cards, mobile drives, external drives, portable hard drives, notebooks and media memory cards "at the local police."</seg>
<seg id="1990">"the intention is obviously to identify and destroy any" terrorist videos. "however, this action violates the personality rights of Urumquis three million inhabitants and gives them penalties for a whole range of other possible offences, including those who refer to peaceful religious or political messages."</seg>

<seg id="2090">"the Jordanian Rapper Emsallam Hdaib talks about the rights of LGBTQ + community, freedom of expression and resistance"</seg>
<seg id="2091">Emsallam Hdaib smokes a cigarette in his studio.</seg>
<seg id="2092">"the photo was taken by Aman Madan, the original author of this text."</seg>
<seg id="2093">"Emsallam Hdaib spends most of his time inside; sometimes he slips to his screen, time to his computer, back and again to his couch."</seg>
<seg id="2094">But what one can rely on is a cigarette between his fingers or his nicotine stained lips.</seg>
<seg id="2095">"he lives on the upper floor of his family house, which belonged to them since 1967; the year in which Israel had completed its occupation of the West Bank and forced Hdaibs family to flee from their village in Palestine in which they lived as felahyeen (e.g.: farmers)."</seg>
<seg id="2096">"for six years, Hdaib has been a passionate activist who has opposed the conservative majority and questioned their well-established opinions on gender roles, sexuality and freedom of expression through art and rapeseed."</seg>
<seg id="2097">"with his music, which often deals with topics like oriental, racism and the situation of Palestinian refugees, he also urges the core of the entire Arab world. all these topics are not only relevant in his home town of Amman but also in cities ranging from Damascus to Syria to Sanaa in Yemen."</seg>
<seg id="2098">"with his 25 years, Hdaib sees himself as a person who is not restricted by limits in his thinking, and can feel according to his own statement with the people who suffer from the devastating consequences of foreign interventions in countries such as Iraq, Yemen, Syria and Libya."</seg>
<seg id="2099">"even if he does not openly admit it, he will have a special incline against US foreign policy."</seg>
<seg id="2100">Hdaib regards his art in his studio in Amman.</seg>
<seg id="2101">Recorded by the author.</seg>
<seg id="2102">"Hdaib does not believe that his compassion for those who are trying to survive in war zones, to do anything with his identity as" Palestinian Observitude of the second generation, "he calls himself even though he was born in Jordan and has never been in Palestine."</seg>
<seg id="2103">"I don't think because of my own circumstances," Hdaib emphasizes. "</seg>
<seg id="2104">"then he adds:" I think so, because I am a human being, "while he solves in water Nescafé into two cups. it is the holy month of Ramadan. in this time it is intended for Muslims to fast from sunrise to sunset."</seg>
<seg id="2105">The Jordanian law also states that the public consumption of food during Ramadan is illegal.</seg>
<seg id="2106">"obviously, Hdaib has a certain weakness for breaking with ancient traditions; on the other hand, a cup of coffee at a scorching hot young boy has little to do with protest against Islam."</seg>
<seg id="2107">"basically, the pieces of lukewarm coffee and the rakes of the Kent-cigarette in the nose primarily speak of freedom."</seg>
<seg id="2108">"sometimes Jordan feels like a prison in the open sky, especially when you look into neighbouring countries."</seg>
<seg id="2109">"therefore, it is easy to do basic things - as in the public during Ramadan's water to drink - not to land in prison."</seg>
<seg id="2110">"recently, Jordaniens Interior Ministry has announced a performance of the band Mashrou'Leila, already for the second time."</seg>
<seg id="2111">"some MPs who support the Islamic campaign of action - the Jordanian branch of the Muslim Brotherhood - argued that the sexual orientation of the homosexual frontend Hamed Sinno, contradicts the cultural and traditional norms of the country, and the main reason for the concert announcement."</seg>
<seg id="2112">"the MP and former press spokesman of the Islamic coalition Dima Tahboub said in an interview with CNN, that the concert had just been cancelled due to the sexual orientation of the singer."</seg>
<seg id="2113">"many also claim that the engagement of the band in matters such as the Arab Spring, Human Rights and freedom of expression in the Arab world is dangerous activism, which question the old-tried legitimacy of authoritarian regimes in the entire region."</seg>
<seg id="2114">"in a public statement, Mashrou'Leila undertook the Jordanian people as" progressive supporter of human rights, "which continued to use for intellectual and cultural pluralism."</seg>
<seg id="2115">"this statement should probably not be simply silky rhetoric, but in fact an increasingly clear-crystallising reality in Jordan, which clearly appears in Hdaibs's work."</seg>
<seg id="2116">"in 2016, Hdaib returned to Leibe by wearing his vision from the fate of Arab women who have sex before."</seg>
<seg id="2117">"the picture shows the skeleton of an apparently drowned unknown woman, whose arms and legs stretch up to the corners of the canvas."</seg>
<seg id="2118">"it is surrounded by a red lake, perhaps the blood of the countless women who have lost their lives by the hands of those they really should trust."</seg>
<seg id="2119">"in Jordan, the number of" "honorary killings" "has taken place in Jordan - the unofficial outside."</seg>
<seg id="2120">"according to Human Rights Watch, the number of volunteers reached its peak in 2016; however, it is still difficult to find that Jordan is missing the institutional infrastructure to support the women who attempted murder or domestic violence, to support appropriate ways."</seg>
<seg id="2121">"according to a law on crime against crime from 1954, women who are exposed to the danger of family-friendly violence can be held in prison for an indefinite period of time, and for their release it is often necessary for years of bureaucratic expenditures and the guarantee by the family that the woman has nothing to do."</seg>
<seg id="2122">Hdaib's music also enjoys great popularity and is well-known for not shy away from issues that long lived as tabu in his country.</seg>
<seg id="2123">"Hdaib denies that his work is politically, however, that he puts his music, which is full of explicit allusions to sexuality, freedom and expression, not to separate politics."</seg>
<seg id="2124">"I come from the Middle East, man."</seg>
<seg id="2125">"I became intimidating politics," "he says."</seg>
<seg id="2126">"in a song called" "Edward Sa'ed," Hdaib takes up the question of the Palestinian identity. "</seg>
<seg id="2127">"in" Lawla al 3aib "and" ghareeb, "the focus is on poverty."</seg>
<seg id="2128">The list of the songs that are political in the core can be continued.</seg>
<seg id="2129">In March 2016 Hdaib published a song entitled "Santandano."</seg>
<seg id="2130">In this song a verse is repeated often:</seg>
<seg id="2131">"you are free, and everyone else is it."</seg>
<seg id="2132">"in the further course of the song Hdaib describes the world as a kind of market on which, in his words," that can get what one wants "- be it faith or non-belief, heterogeneity or homosexuality."</seg>
<seg id="2133">He notices that hardly anyone in Jordan talks about the rights of gay people and lesbians and that comments on equality of LGBTQ + individuals have been strongly censored until 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2134">"in 2014, Hdaib conducted an interview for the popular Jordan online program Roya to remember that his comments had been torn, twisted and censored in his opinion."</seg>
<seg id="2135">"on Youtube it was uploaded without incisions, but was only a revised version," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="2136">"today, Hdaib campaigns openly for the Arab LGBTQ + community and believes that intolerance to homosexuals does not entail Islam."</seg>
<seg id="2137">"he mentions Abu Nudas, a poet of the eighth century, which is still remembered today thanks to his homoerotic poems."</seg>
<seg id="2138">"Hdaib asks: if Abu Nudas, who was later to work on behalf of the caliph, could write openly about homosexuality in the eighth century, why can Jordan not?"</seg>
<seg id="2139">"the real problem, so Hdaib, have nothing to do with Mashrou 'Leila or the fact that the concert was cancelled."</seg>
<seg id="2140">"in the hashemite kingdom there is nothing new anymore that the government sanctioned attacks on freedom of expression, and that progressive votes will be silenced."</seg>
<seg id="2141">"recently, in January 2017, the Jordanian Intelligence Service held several former members of government and members of the teacher association with the reasoning that they had critically expressed criticism in social media, which are critically related to the problems rooted in the country."</seg>
<seg id="2142">"in view of this, Hdaib's opinion is only the tip of the iceberg - the real challenge is to bring about a structural rethinking in the next generation of the Jordanier."</seg>
<seg id="2143">"for him, progress is a constant giving and taking. Jordan has denied Mashrou'Leila for the second time in a row, but the path of progress - so it sees Hdaib - consists of slow, thoughtful and internal changes."</seg>
<seg id="2144">"in the end, Hdaib, like millions of other Arabs, dreams of an Arab world without interventions from abroad."</seg>
<seg id="2145">"he does not only dream of bringing his work to Baghdad, Jerusalem and Damascus, but also to" experience them. ""</seg>
<seg id="2146">"perhaps the region will bring about genuine and fundamental openness by means of music, art and literature - and not by bombs, streams and artificially induced democracies. at least he hopes that."</seg>
<seg id="2147">"until it is ready, Hdaib will move on and therefore also resist."</seg>
<seg id="2148">This report was made possible by the Pulitzer Center on Crisis reporting that Aman listened to as a student Fellow.</seg>
<seg id="2149">Nebuta in Aomori is one of the three biggest festivals in Japan.</seg>
<seg id="2150">"these large, extravagant war dolls are so fantastic!!!"</seg>
<seg id="2151">There are numerous theories regarding the origin of the Nebuta festival.</seg>
<seg id="2152">"it is assumed that it is a variant of the Tanabata festival, which is usually celebrated in many areas of Tohokus in August. another theory states that the trailers, drums and dancing have been crossed over a thousand years and come from a time in which armies from the west marched to the north east to force the indigenous inhabitants of the region, the Emishi, into the knees."</seg>
<seg id="2153">We are at the Nebuta Festival in Aomori.</seg>
<seg id="2154">"we were able to grab some great seats, so we have a great view."</seg>
<seg id="2155">One can only imagine how large these parts are...</seg>
<seg id="2156">"a joint centre in the capital, Meguro Gajoen, hosted a two-month exhibition to Wa no Akari."</seg>
<seg id="2157">I have been looking at the Meguro Gajoen for a long time: two fixed cars are just to be seen.</seg>
<seg id="2158">"nevertheless, for many people who take the trip to Aomori, the Nebuta Festival is the only true - and still a stunning way to spend the summer:"</seg>
<seg id="2159">"" "Yattemare!" ""</seg>
<seg id="2160">Yattemare! "# Summer Festival in the north of the country.</seg>
<seg id="2161">I was there and watched the # NebutaFestival.</seg>
<seg id="2162">The sight of a 18-metre-high festival was incredible.</seg>

<seg id="2168">"El Callao, Peru's most important port, is located on the coast of the Pacific Ocean, near the historic center of Lima - a region with a very high crime rate, where road robbery and illegal drug trade are everyday."</seg>
<seg id="2169">"Euromonitor International has over 40 years' experience of publishing market research reports, business reference books and online information systems."</seg>
<seg id="2170">"at the same time, Peru experiences - like many other Central and South American countries - an increasing demand for aesthetic services for men."</seg>
<seg id="2171">"the trend, the appearance and thus also the unusual hairstyles of famous athletes such as Paolo Guerrero (Peru), Arturo Vidal (Chile), Pedro Gallese (Peru), or Neymar (Brazil), has led that more and more normals go into the experienced hands of hairdressers that can recreate these elaborate hairstyles."</seg>
<seg id="2172">"the unprecedented demand for hairstyles that go to the extreme limits of imagination and creativity, has even inspired an annual event, the competition of the hairdressers" Batalla de Barberos, "which has been taking place since 2014."</seg>
<seg id="2173">"there experts compete against each other to show who can create the most centric looks, as can be seen in the following video (more videos about current competitions are available on the public Facebook profile Batalla de Barberos)."</seg>
<seg id="2174">"educational institutions such as the Augusto Salazar Bondy school, located in El Callao, found here an opportunity to convince young people to exchange their weapons against hairdressing tools, instead of receiving an education in hairdressing art, which allows them to find work."</seg>

<seg id="2178">Colombia: letter of Love to Guerrilla fighters</seg>
<seg id="2179">Foto: Valentina Monsalve.</seg>
<seg id="2180">Use with friendly permission.</seg>
<seg id="2181">"the following article is the edited version of the contribution" "Love messages to guerrilla fighters", "published by the international online magazine Tea After Twelve."</seg>
<seg id="2182">The contribution will be published here as part of a partnership with Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="2183">Why do we write only love letters to people we know?</seg>
<seg id="2184">"is it not much more important to accommodate people, who feel expelled, affection?"</seg>
<seg id="2185">This question was exactly the question of the two young Colombian activists Leonardo Párraga from the BogotArt Foundation and Cristian Palacios from the Young Youth Foundation and inspired her to write letters to the campaign Cartas por la reconciliación (letters to reconciliation).</seg>
<seg id="2186">"first of all, their country was the scene of a historic event and they wanted to contribute to it: after years of negotiations, the Colombian government had concluded a peace treaty with the FARC guerrilla war (German: revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia), which forms the closing point of the longest armed conflict in Latin America."</seg>
<seg id="2187">"internationally, the signing of the peace treaty was considered as significant that the Colombian President José Manuel Santos received the Nobel Peace Prize for his services."</seg>
<seg id="2188">"but before the Colombian people, there is still a long way to speak of real reconciliation and peace."</seg>
<seg id="2189">"Guerrilla fighters, who lived in illegal camps for many years, were subjected to war rhetoric and carrying out their weapons around the clock, must now be integrated into life as civilians."</seg>
<seg id="2190">"the Colombian society in turn, who had become accustomed to life in constant fear and in some cases of deep hatred towards guerrilla fighters, must now take them into their ranks and support them in the construction of a new life."</seg>
<seg id="2191">Leonardo and Cristian were convinced that the young Colombians would join together and help in the integration process.</seg>
<seg id="2192">And that's exactly what they did: until now thousands of young people have written letters - love messages to former guerrilla fighters to welcome them back in society.</seg>
<seg id="2193">"the goal of the campaign is 6900 letters - one for every former guerrilla fighter, which should then be handed over personally."</seg>
<seg id="2194">Valentine's Day as inspiration for the campaign</seg>
<seg id="2195">"the idea for the reconciliation was created at the world summit of Nobel Peace Laureates, which took place in Bogotá in February 2017. there, Leonardo and Cristian had the opportunity to talk briefly to Kailash Satyarthi, who was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014."</seg>
<seg id="2196">"this stated that we love the people who we love to write thousands of love letters on Valentine's Day, but those who need them much more needful."</seg>
<seg id="2197">"he plans to share his love with people this year, who needed the most urgent response."</seg>
<seg id="2198">"so the plan was to write letters full of hope and support for former fighters of the FARC, who now have to find their place in society and to build a new life." "the letters will show that the Colombian society is ready to make the discourse of a war story to a common history of peace," "they say."</seg>
<seg id="2199">"until now, more than 2000 letters have been collected as part of the campaign."</seg>
<seg id="2200">"the initiative is represented in all major cities of Colombia such as Cali, Manizales, Medellín, Barranquilla and Bogotá."</seg>
<seg id="2201">"I never thought that someone would forgive me" ""</seg>
<seg id="2202">The first 500 letters were handed over to one of the UN camps in the Caldono-Cauca region on March 19.</seg>
<seg id="2203">"a group of 40 students at the University of Javeriana in Cali, two members of the Municipality of Cali and Leonardo from the BogotArt Foundation travelled to the camp to personally deliver the letters."</seg>
<seg id="2204">The members of the FARC were as they had done earlier to accept the orders of their leaders.</seg>
<seg id="2205">"but this time they did not receive orders, but letters full of subtlety of people from all over the country."</seg>
<seg id="2206">"it was a very moving moment for all involved." it's incredible how many different feelings one can walk through in just a few hours - from fear to happiness and everything in between, "the politician student Manuela Jiménez Avila told later."</seg>
<seg id="2207">"Sandra Parra, an employee of the Governor of the province of Valle del Cauca, described this unforgettable experience as follows:"</seg>
<seg id="2208">"after we handed over the letters, a former fighter brought me through the camp of the guerrilla fighters."</seg>
<seg id="2209">"when I saw in one of the" "Cambuches" "(a kind of hut in which the guerrilla fighters live) I saw a guerrilla fighter who wrote something."</seg>
<seg id="2210">"I was afraid to go down, because beside him on the bed a MGL Granatlauncher, a deadly weapon in Sleeping Beauty."</seg>
<seg id="2211">"he said," "Hello, what are they doing?" "he answered," "I answer a letter that someone has written to me."</seg>
<seg id="2212">It is a very nice and hopeful letter.</seg>
<seg id="2213">"never before in my life someone has written something so beautiful, so I answer it." I suddenly ran the tears of the cheeks. "</seg>
<seg id="2214">I hugged him completely and sat down beside the garnet.</seg>
<seg id="2215">"perhaps he was tired of the war, it was sorry to be all the years of faithful companions of this fighter, and wanted to help him write this letter."</seg>
<seg id="2216">"the man told me more about his life. he never expected anything else from life than war. to join the FARC was the only way to preserve him and his six brothers before the Hungertod." "I never thought anyone would forgive me for my mistakes."</seg>
<seg id="2217">But now I know that there is a society there waiting for us with open arms.</seg>
<seg id="2218">"until now, I have only learned how to deal with weapons."</seg>
<seg id="2219">"but now where peace reigns, I can learn many things and work in dignity."</seg>
<seg id="2220">New voices</seg>
<seg id="2221">"for the first time, students and some leaders of the FARC were invited to a discussion round."</seg>
<seg id="2222">The students were all grown up as already war and the FARC already acted in secret.</seg>
<seg id="2223">"for this reason, the leaders of the FARC announced the history of the organization, their ideals and gave insight into their views on the peace process:" for many years, we have experienced how social injustice has worked on the whole Colombian people. "</seg>
<seg id="2224">"for a purpose of this magnitude, it is worthwhile to overcome all obstacles," "said one of them."</seg>
<seg id="2225">Manuela was impressed:</seg>
<seg id="2226">"to hear these people who have never had hearing before and had no choice, and to recognize that people that I have often seen as monsters and even hate people with beautiful feelings that were reversed by their circumstances and their environment was very painful for me."</seg>
<seg id="2227">"the reality in which the country lives, hurts me."</seg>
<seg id="2228">"but it comforts me that all people - including those who have killed and so much damage, can teach us something and give a smile and a hug."</seg>
<seg id="2229">Many former fighters have responded to the letters.</seg>
<seg id="2230">"Gustavo González, commander of the camp in Caldono-Cauca, wrote for example Darío de Jesús Monsalve, Archbishop of the town of Cali, following letter:"</seg>
<seg id="2231">The Colombian was prophesied that after disarming peace would reign.</seg>
<seg id="2232">But this is not the case.</seg>
<seg id="2233">"as long as there is inequality, hunger and lack of education, health care and employment opportunities, there will always be people who are ready to resort to the weapons, to rise and protest for their rights. and that is also fully justified (...)."</seg>
<seg id="2234">"we of the FARC are now putting on peace, on a policy without weapons."</seg>
<seg id="2235">"that is why we call all defenders of peace - no matter what race, religion or ideology they belong - to rise above all those who dream of a country in war."</seg>
<seg id="2236">"we give you our word, make our contribution and bring sacrifices because we know from our own experience that nothing is simple. those of us who defend life as the basis of existence will face many difficulties."</seg>
<seg id="2237">"on our way there will be many obstacles, but together we will overcome them."</seg>

<seg id="2243">"homosexuals and queer people living in the Caucasus region are exposed to a wide range of dangers, including discrimination, physical and sexual violence and blackmail."</seg>
<seg id="2244">"with horror, activists have witnessed the reporting of recent months about the persecution of gay men in Chechnya."</seg>
<seg id="2245">But the threat that hangs like a Damokleswert above the local LGBTQ community has not only been created overnight.</seg>
<seg id="2246">"OC Media had the opportunity to speak with a transsexual woman from Grosny, who shared some of her experiences with us and talked with us about what is currently happening in the republic."</seg>
<seg id="2247">"the LGBTQ law in Chechnya has conquered the international headlines several months ago, after reports have been published which dealt with the deportation, torture and murder of queer men in the Republic."</seg>
<seg id="2248">The first report was published by the journalist Elena Milaschina in the Nowaya Gazeta; she threw a light on the methods of Chechen authorities who captured suspicious queer men and put them into secret prisons in argun.</seg>
<seg id="2249">"you brought a monster to the world"</seg>
<seg id="2250">"Sabrina, a woman, was born in Grosny and grew up there."</seg>
<seg id="2251">Since her childhood she felt that she was actually a woman.</seg>
<seg id="2252">"when she was grown up, she became aware that Chechnya was not a safe place for her, so she moved to Moscow."</seg>
<seg id="2253">"after a group of Chechens had experienced by the gender equality of their landlady, the hunt was opened on Sabrina."</seg>
<seg id="2254">"from fear of her life, she moved to the United States."</seg>
<seg id="2255">Sabrina: I was an honorary assistant in a human rights organisation.</seg>
<seg id="2256">One day I told me that someone needed my help.</seg>
<seg id="2257">"it was a friend of Dagestan, a woman who was infected with difficulty."</seg>
<seg id="2258">"she had no money, so I took her without hesitation."</seg>
<seg id="2259">"while I tried to help her, someone from whom I thought he would be a friend, a copy of my documents and spread it all over the internet, with my phone number and a picture of mine."</seg>
<seg id="2260">"after that, the photos of my documents made the lap through the whole WhatsApp."</seg>
<seg id="2261">On 10 October 2015 I was attacked.</seg>
<seg id="2262">"when I was watching a few shopping bags from the backseat of my car, I heard a male voice say:" here is a gift for you from your uncle. "</seg>
<seg id="2263">"when I turned around, I felt something in my body, but I didn't hurt me."</seg>
<seg id="2264">"then I heard a sentence, but this time on Chechnya:" "how long do you want to honour the family, du Schandfleck?"</seg>
<seg id="2265">I didn't know the person.</seg>
<seg id="2266">"I know only that it was a young man, not 30 years old."</seg>
<seg id="2267">Then I lost the consciousness and woke up again in the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="2268">Apparently some women had taken everything along and started crying.</seg>
<seg id="2269">The man was fled.</seg>
<seg id="2270">The women had called an ambulance.</seg>
<seg id="2271">"in the hospital, I learned that I had two wounds in my right wing."</seg>
<seg id="2272">"OC Media: in which casings were you laid - in which of the men, or those of women?"</seg>
<seg id="2273">"Sabrina: my documents are outdated, there is still my male name on it; but the doctor understood and put me to the women."</seg>
<seg id="2274">I am very grateful for this.</seg>
<seg id="2275">"when I read his name for the first time on his office, I was afraid to do it; it was a Muslim, a Caucasian name."</seg>
<seg id="2276">But he turned out to be a good man.</seg>
<seg id="2277">I am thankful to him that he was respectful with me.</seg>
<seg id="2278">I spent more than one month in the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="2279">Last February I got threats.</seg>
<seg id="2280">"they called me, wrote me - relatives, strangers, some completely unknown."</seg>
<seg id="2281">This was the beginning of a nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2282">My family was visited by neighbors and some distant relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2283">They demanded to send me back to Chechnya to prove that it was all a lie.</seg>
<seg id="2284">"they reported absurd demands: some told me that I needed to prove it by going up without going through the streets; others wanted me to appear on the official TV in Grosny and say that I didn't change my sex, that all was just bad speech, and Photoshop."</seg>
<seg id="2285">I have a cup size C - what should I have to say on television?</seg>
<seg id="2286">OC Media: how has your family tried to deal with this pressure?</seg>
<seg id="2287">Sabrina: it is still hard for her.</seg>
<seg id="2288">Some older people once talked to my mother on the street.</seg>
<seg id="2289">"they said to her," "You have brought a monster to the world not only your family, but the whole republic."</seg>
<seg id="2290">"we cannot touch you because you are a pious woman, but you must disappear from here."</seg>
<seg id="2291">"my mother was too much, and she put a rope around his neck."</seg>
<seg id="2292">Fortunately the neighbors came and saved them.</seg>
<seg id="2293">At that time I had to change the apartment several times a day.</seg>
<seg id="2294">"I moved to an apartment and a few hours later, under the window a car was covered with darkened window panes and a plate with a 95."</seg>
<seg id="2295">After it happened for the third time it became clear to me that something was lazy.</seg>
<seg id="2296">My human rights friends checked the number plates - it turned out that I was persecuted.</seg>
<seg id="2297">OC Media: how did you fly?</seg>
<seg id="2298">Sabrina: with the help of activists.</seg>
<seg id="2299">"for security reasons, I don't want to give up their names, but I want to say that I remember them all; they really helped me."</seg>
<seg id="2300">"with their help, I left the country, but then something incredible happened."</seg>
<seg id="2301">I can still not understand how it could be.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Shortly before my departure from Moscow I bought a new SIM card to call my mother as soon as I arrived.</seg>
<seg id="2303">"I bought them without registering me, without notice, without anything."</seg>
<seg id="2304">I broke my old SIM card and threw it into the garbage.</seg>
<seg id="2305">Arrived and checked into the hotel.</seg>
<seg id="2306">The number was registered to a stranger.</seg>
<seg id="2307">I put the SIM card into my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="2308">"at the moment when I wanted to call my mother via WhatsApp, I got a message:" you don't think you're in security, just because you left the country? "</seg>
<seg id="2309">Our people know at what place you put in. they even know your room number.</seg>
<seg id="2310">Only to prove it to you: it is the number 115.</seg>
<seg id="2311">Can you imagine that?!</seg>
<seg id="2312">This was actually my room number.</seg>
<seg id="2313">OC Media: are you still in contact with your family?</seg>
<seg id="2314">Sabrina: only with my mother and my sisters.</seg>
<seg id="2315">"however, we do not talk about gender equality, this is a taboo topic."</seg>
<seg id="2316">Some traditional Caucasian elements are still wearing in me.</seg>
<seg id="2317">"as I wish, I can't overcome this spiritual barrier."</seg>
<seg id="2318">"I always say that as long as my mother is alive, I will do my best to avoid injury."</seg>
<seg id="2319">"when we chat with camera, I really try to see how the person looks at, which she recalls from her past - so to my male form."</seg>
<seg id="2320">But that is very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2321">OC Media: do you know something about the current situation in Chechnya?</seg>
<seg id="2322">"what do your friends, those who have stayed there?"</seg>
<seg id="2323">Sabrina: I submitted a report in Washington last week.</seg>
<seg id="2324">For him I needed up-to-date information on the situation in Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2325">"I spoke to someone, who has imprisoned one and a half months in argun."</seg>
<seg id="2326">"he told that no people were arrested and tortured during Ramadan, but also that all the end of Ramadan could hardly wait, and he did not lock a new wave."</seg>
<seg id="2327">"most likely, they will now focus on family and relatives."</seg>
<seg id="2328">"I mean, they probably invite the relatives who take care of the problem with the person concerned and at the end require proof that the so-called" "honor" "has experienced through blood satisfaction."</seg>
<seg id="2329">OC Media: are also still gay men held in these secret prisons?</seg>
<seg id="2330">"Sabrina: a friend of mine says, there wouldn't be very many."</seg>
<seg id="2331">"if, above all, those who have no wealthy relatives or who were abandoned by their relatives to face Kadyrows's court."</seg>
<seg id="2332">"as far as I know, they are held there so that they can be presented as terrorists later."</seg>
<seg id="2333">"say: if they are murdered, they will show their bodies on television and claim that they have attacked any village or a military base."</seg>
<seg id="2334">Understand?</seg>
<seg id="2335">"as if these people were not simply disappeared, but specifically submerged in order to radicalise themselves."</seg>
<seg id="2336">"OC Media: is this now only a guess, or do you have a source for this information?"</seg>
<seg id="2337">Sabrina: I just quote someone who was imprisoned for one and a half months in argun.</seg>
<seg id="2338">He says that many people in this prison disappeared after their beard had grown.</seg>
<seg id="2339">There was nothing new from them since then.</seg>
<seg id="2340">They just took them along.</seg>
<seg id="2341">"and this so-called Lord, this person was even there when these people were taken along."</seg>
<seg id="2342">"until now they have not been presented as bandits, there have been no reports so far. however, we suspect that such actions are possible."</seg>
<seg id="2343">Why else would it not have allowed these people to shave?</seg>
<seg id="2344">"do you know if these persecutions and abductions of people belonging to a so-called" "non-traditional" "orientation have already occurred in the past?"</seg>
<seg id="2345">Sabrina: I always wore my hair long.</seg>
<seg id="2346">In Chechnya I had a Bob.</seg>
<seg id="2347">"I think already before 2003 I was already known in quite big, when I still lived there - and I never had any problems."</seg>
<seg id="2348">In earnest!</seg>
<seg id="2349">"even from 1998 to 1999, when the Sharia was applied, I never had any problems."</seg>
<seg id="2350">"on the contrary, it was much safer than now."</seg>
<seg id="2351">"Russia originally intended to introduce us to" "civilisation", "but ultimately threw us back into the Stone Age."</seg>
<seg id="2352">OC Media: how is this possible under Sharia law?</seg>
<seg id="2353">"Sabrina: my eyebrows were plucked; I had colored eyelashes, bore tubular jeans and short tops."</seg>
<seg id="2354">The security ministry of Sharia has never bent me a hair.</seg>
<seg id="2355">"in front of the Russian theatre in Grosny there was a place where every evening, especially at weekends, a whole group of people like me met."</seg>
<seg id="2356">"it was a small place where several banks stood, and the whole city knew about it; they knew why men, young people, met there."</seg>
<seg id="2357">We have never been offended.</seg>
<seg id="2358">In the Chechen language there is a saying: Kharda ma Kharda. that means: "don't worry about the misfortune of another.</seg>
<seg id="2359">They often say to children when they make fun of the sick.</seg>
<seg id="2360">"OC Media: so they just closed their eyes to you, because they believed they were sick?"</seg>
<seg id="2361">Sabrina: yeah.</seg>
<seg id="2362">"they have never offended me, never hunted and never beaten."</seg>
<seg id="2363">OC Media: how long did this grace period hold?</seg>
<seg id="2364">Sabrina: so long until Kadyrov entered the plan.</seg>
<seg id="2365">"when he was appointed Prime Minister in 2005, he began talking about morality on television."</seg>
<seg id="2366">"he did not talk about us per se, but primarily about the behaviour of women."</seg>
<seg id="2367">"nevertheless, one could sense how people began to change in the city."</seg>
<seg id="2368">"he who had laughed and laughed before, looked at you at once with suspicion."</seg>
<seg id="2369">In time I left Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2370">"but every time I came back home, I could feel how the situation in the republic was steadily worse."</seg>
<seg id="2371">OC Media: what activity do you follow now?</seg>
<seg id="2372">Sabrina: I work as a waitress.</seg>
<seg id="2373">I don't earn much - 700 to 800 dollars a month in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="2374">"apart from that, I am still active as an activist."</seg>
<seg id="2375">"at present, I am responsible for 15 Muslim women."</seg>
<seg id="2376">I communicate with them as a kind of psychologist.</seg>
<seg id="2377">"we organize teetreffs, gatherings, I accompany them to the hospital and help them get food cards."</seg>
<seg id="2378">I have no cents for it for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="2379">I discovered these people myself when I klapperte influencers.</seg>
<seg id="2380">I am Muslim and wants to help those who need help.</seg>
<seg id="2381">OC Media: do you wear a Hidschab?</seg>
<seg id="2382">Sabrina: that's alright.</seg>
<seg id="2383">This is the nature that has nothing to do with religion.</seg>
<seg id="2384">"this is exactly the same as Chechens, who want to prophesy to you with foam before the mouth that there are no owls with them."</seg>
<seg id="2385">"the dents have which, the cabardines have which, the Russians also have which; on the whole planet there is - but" not in Chechnya. ""</seg>
<seg id="2386">"I come from there, so it is unpleasant to hear something like that."</seg>
<seg id="2387">I meet so many men from the Caucasus.</seg>
<seg id="2388">Many of them - practicing Muslims who go to the mosque and fast during Ramadan - live together with men.</seg>
<seg id="2389">"you know, many think about men who love men, and they believe that one changes his sex to make more intimate experiences. but this is a truffle."</seg>
<seg id="2390">"these are two different things - two different types of sensation to be exact, different attitudes."</seg>
<seg id="2391">"for me, it is the most important thing to feel in my own skin and not ashamed of my body."</seg>
<seg id="2392">Do not know if I have a partner or not.</seg>
<seg id="2393">"sorry, I'm going to be so personal here, but my last intimate relationship is now longer than a year ago."</seg>
<seg id="2394">And I am not sad at all - I just know that I am now myself.</seg>

<seg id="2406">He died a short time later.</seg>

<seg id="2408">"the Ahwazi Centre for Human Rights reported that some others - Hamid Manifesto, Ali Hazbawi, Sayed Falah Moussawi and Shahab Bani Tamim."</seg>
<seg id="2409">"their stories have one thing in common: they were all family patriots, who felt helpless and unable to feed their families and to pursue a safe work."</seg>
<seg id="2410">"Arab Ahwazi suffer from poverty, unemployment and discrimination"</seg>
<seg id="2411">"the region, located in the majority of the Arab Ahwazi community living in Iran, was shaken by a profound economic crisis that makes it difficult for the native Arab population to deny their livelihood."</seg>
<seg id="2412">"a century ago, the Arabic ancestor was a predominantly autonomous region in Iran, until the Pahlavi monarchy assumed power and made great efforts in 1925 to end ethnic autonomy throughout Iran."</seg>
<seg id="2413">"in the Ahraz region, there are some of the largest oil and gas fields occurring in Iran, as well as some of the most profitable and valuable useful areas for Iranian agriculture."</seg>
<seg id="2414">"despite these valuable resources, the regional economy continues to develop slowly, and the local population only gets little of this wealth."</seg>
<seg id="2415">"it is often victims of untreated diseases, hunger and deprivation."</seg>
<seg id="2416">"the Iranian regime systematically refuses the Ahwazi-Arabs to systematically jobs in the local oil, gas and petrochemical industries."</seg>

<seg id="2433">"why I don't identify myself with feminism, even with the intersectional"</seg>
<seg id="2434">Detail of a photo. recorded by Pixabay. published under the CC0 Creative Commons License.</seg>
<seg id="2435">The following article is a revised version of the opinion published by Ayomide Zuri and originally published on the Afroféminas website.</seg>
<seg id="2436">You can read in the comments below the original text.</seg>
<seg id="2437">"when I say that I am not a feminist, many women - especially white women, who call themselves as intersectional feminists - with frustration."</seg>
<seg id="2438">They wonder why I am not part of the movement.</seg>
<seg id="2439">They even put well thought-out scientific and social arguments in front of me why I should be feminist and why we should all be feminist in general.</seg>
<seg id="2440">"for example, women still earn less money today despite the same education than men."</seg>
<seg id="2441">Women are still under strict observation when it comes to what they are allowed to do with their bodies.</seg>
<seg id="2442">That violence against women is a global epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="2443">"or that cultural and social norms still ensure that women sooner or later come to a glass ceiling in various areas of life, and that discrimination based on gender is still attracting themselves across the many different countries and faiths."</seg>
<seg id="2444">All this is aware and known to me.</seg>
<seg id="2445">I am convinced and I suffer twice and threefold.</seg>
<seg id="2446">I am a black woman.</seg>
<seg id="2447">"yet, when I come to speak on skin color, on racism, on black women women, on black women in the LGBTIQ community or on black women from the Diaspora; when I mention how we have always been abused physically, spiritually and verbally, both in and out of feminist movement, many white feminists let alone remain silent."</seg>
<seg id="2448">"but all agree that women - all women - should come together to" "lift up their voices" "and" "Kumbaya, my Lord" "to achieve equal rights (some) of women."</seg>
<seg id="2449">But they don't want to talk about sexualised violence in addition to an institutionalised form of racist-motivated violence that we are exposed to black women in a double way.</seg>
<seg id="2450">"or, that black women and women of other ethnic and origin are less worthy than white men and women."</seg>
<seg id="2451">"that black girls and girls with a migration background often referred to school as white girls, due to obvious integration problems."</seg>
<seg id="2452">"or that women in black spheres and women with a migration background are exposed to a higher risk of suffering domestic violence and violence in partnership, as white women."</seg>
<seg id="2453">"on the one hand, I want all women, all men and all men of any skin colour have the same rights; on the other hand, I can not join a movement in whose center the white woman stands who refuses to take into account injustices in their thinking, which relate to both the sex and the skin colour of one person."</seg>
<seg id="2454">"I am exhausted and won't fight for my affiliation in a white-feminist-oriented sphere, which always rejected me and countless other black women forever and again."</seg>
<seg id="2455">"in 1851, Sojourner complained," "Am I no woman?" "and I also refuse to uphold an ideology in which the black woman in a historical sense is an entangled and marginalized being."</seg>
<seg id="2456">"I refuse to join groupings, which also absorb our customs and customs by cultural appropriation to advance their egocentric programme."</seg>
<seg id="2457">"I will no longer try to expose white women the importance of overlapping skin color and gender. for some of them will continue to silence the importance of black women for the feminist movement, no matter how many black women try to teach them an improvement."</seg>
<seg id="2458">"although intersectional feminism was founded to give women of different backgrounds a home and to distinguish themselves from white feminism, the word" Feminism "is still in its name."</seg>
<seg id="2459">"I prefer to release myself fully and completely from feminism and to join the movement of womanism, which was called for my dark skin and my status as a woman, which is so persistent that intersectionality is celebrated as a novel phenomenon."</seg>
<seg id="2460">Now it is more important than ever that we define black women according to our own ideas and go into the spheres created by us for us.</seg>
<seg id="2461">"Clenora Hudson-Wealth, author of the book Africana womanism: reclaiming ourselves (about: Africa-Womanism: how we can defend ourselves) by defining ourselves in our own way. and not only that - black women can also be worshipped by the cultural, spiritual, psychological, physical and even the spiritual elements that constitute the black woman."</seg>
<seg id="2462">"although some white and intersectional feminists will immediately call separatism and exclusion after reading these lines, I ask you to inform yourself of the hypocrisy and the contradictions of feminist movement that the black woman is concerned."</seg>
<seg id="2463">"in a womanistic environment, I can lift black women and women from other cultures, because in this paradigm I exist."</seg>
<seg id="2464">I will be recognized as a part of this paradigm because of my dark skin and because of my existence as a woman.</seg>
<seg id="2465">"I, a black woman, can bloom in an environment where my life neither blows nor ignored, nor rejected."</seg>

<seg id="2480">The following article is the shortened and edited version of the article "The Wave of Violence Against Women in Paraguay." the article belongs to the series # PorSerMujer (# weilicheinefraubin) that reports on the wave of violence against women in Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="2481">Most names were changed to protect the persons affected.</seg>
<seg id="2482">"a police commissioner said Ada Báez, that she could undertake nothing against Luis Balbuena, her spouse, who had become violent against violence."</seg>
<seg id="2483">"since the end of their relationship, some time has passed and the police said that their statement would be put to the acts, but more cannot be done."</seg>
<seg id="2484">"as another woman Balbuena pointed out for maltreatment, the advert ad of Ada Báez did not use anything."</seg>
<seg id="2485">"a few days later, the second woman returned her ad."</seg>
<seg id="2486">Breaking the vicious circle of violence against women is difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2487">"if women have an ad at all, they generally do not receive any support from the state."</seg>
<seg id="2488">"in many cases, the women are also financially dependent on the men who abuse it. this also explains why only 20% of all women admit to be victims of violence, in general report themselves to the law enforcement authorities."</seg>
<seg id="2489">"content 1 Strikes and Statistiken2 Unseen Missions and a legal system, which nothing subnimm3 Paraguays Law: good approach, flawed implementation hits and statistics"</seg>
<seg id="2490">"it is hard to determine how many women are really mistreated, says Myrian González, researcher for gender issues at the Centro de Documentación y Estudios, a social science research institution in Paraguay." "there are various statements and reports, which, however, not even approach the extent of gender-specific violence against women in Paraguay," "she explains."</seg>
<seg id="2491">"however, the numbers available are alarming."</seg>
<seg id="2492">"in 2015, the District Attorney General contacted 9600 ads for domestic violence, 70% of which was about violence against women."</seg>
<seg id="2493">86% of the indicators in the police came from women.</seg>
<seg id="2494">There were more than 5000 ads for domestic violence in the peace courts. 86% of women's ads came here too.</seg>
<seg id="2495">"in the advertisements, 40% of women said that they were physically abused, 55% of women spoke of mental abuse."</seg>
<seg id="2496">"however, these statistics do not show the true extent of violence against women in Paraguay."</seg>
<seg id="2497">"according to the Paraguayan women's minister Ana Baiardi, only a few of these crimes are actually indicated." "on every woman who is refunded in Paraguay for mental abuse, 9 women who do not do so."</seg>
<seg id="2498">"on every woman who refunded because of physical abuse, two women who do not do this," stated her at the end of 2014. "</seg>
<seg id="2499">"since women's suicide in Paraguay is not an own criminal record, law enforcement agencies cannot properly document how many women are murdered every year from their current or former partners."</seg>
<seg id="2500">"until August 2016, journalists counted at least 12 cases of genocide in the country."</seg>
<seg id="2501">The Coordinator for Human Rights in Paraguay documented at least 37 cases where women were murdered by their current or former partners.</seg>
<seg id="2502">"according to their estimates, in Paraguay, every ten days in Paraguay dies due to violence by men."</seg>

<seg id="2505">"before Mariana Brítez became the firm friend of Carlos Vera, he insisted that she named him the name of all her former friends."</seg>
<seg id="2506">"at the beginning, she didn't want it, but then gave her."</seg>
<seg id="2507">"today Mariana is 28 years old and no longer together with Carlos. but for two years she bore the psychic violence on his part - one of the most common forms of violence against women, and at the same time the most recognizable:"</seg>
<seg id="2508">I never thought I would become victims of abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2509">"when I read about it earlier, I always thought that only women are going to be submissive, because they let themselves be deceived by violent men."</seg>
<seg id="2510">I was convinced that this would never happen.</seg>
<seg id="2511">Mariana used social media to report about the abuse of Carlos Vera.</seg>
<seg id="2512">"without name, she wrote articles on Facebook where she described his insults and various attacks during her two-year relationship and told how he had isolated her."</seg>
<seg id="2513">"many people responded to their contributions, including Carlos himself. he asked rhetorical if he ever lifted his hand against her and refused to admit that his behaviour was also a form of abuse."</seg>
<seg id="2514">Other Facebook users asked Mariana why they had dropped so long from Carlos and didn't leave him earlier.</seg>
<seg id="2515">"it seemed almost as if they wanted to say that victims of abuse were at least some complicity, at least."</seg>
<seg id="2516">"Victoria Santos, who did not come from Paraguay, fought almost eight years with the authorities in Paraguay to prove that their former partner mistreated them."</seg>
<seg id="2517">"Victoria is a member of the Yo te creo network (" I believe you "), consisting of women, all of which are victims of abuse."</seg>
<seg id="2518">"in the group, they can talk to others about their experiences, listen to each other and support each other."</seg>
<seg id="2519">They do what many others do not do: they take the statements of women seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2520">In Victorian case everything started with mental abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2521">"her wealthy partner, eventually, managed to convince her that she was worthless."</seg>
<seg id="2522">Then he began to beat them.</seg>
<seg id="2523">"Victoria Ads with the authorities remained without a result and also from their relatives, they did not receive any support."</seg>
<seg id="2524">"it led a process against its former partner, which developed into an undeniable legal struggle between Paraguay and its home country, in which it was mainly about money, power and the influence of its former partner."</seg>
<seg id="2525">"Paraguays Law: good approach, flawed implementation"</seg>
<seg id="2526">"in Paraguay there are many laws that are very good, but are not applied."</seg>
<seg id="2527">"the ad of abuse is a way of resistances and a fight against corruption in the judiciary," says Victoria Santos. "</seg>
<seg id="2528">"Carmen Echauri, a representative of the UN Organisation for Women in Paraguay, also sees great problems in applying the laws in the country."</seg>
<seg id="2529">"on 10 August 2016, a bill was discussed in the Paraguayan Parliament, known as # Poroshas (# for you)."</seg>

<seg id="2587">Ranjit Warrier 2016 in Zambia</seg>
<seg id="2588">Medical research in Africa is rarely mentioned or not mentioned in the media. it is a growing area that addresses one of the most urgent needs of the continent.</seg>
<seg id="2589">"there are two reasons for the need for medical research, there are two reasons: there are many medicines and vaccines that are missing in the offer of the global healthcare system that cover the specific medical need on the African continent."</seg>
<seg id="2590">"diseases such as AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria have far more severe effects in the poorest countries than elsewhere, and lack of investment for the study of these diseases by the pharmaceutical companies are a major problem."</seg>
<seg id="2591">"secondly, research carried out by African scientists is helping to build their own research capacities in Africa. a major role in science and technology can only be conducive to the economic growth of the continent."</seg>
<seg id="2592">"Dr. Ranjit Warrier is Director of the Centre for Infectious Disease Research in Zambia (Centre for Infectious Disease Research in Zambia, CIDRZ)."</seg>
<seg id="2593">"in the 1990s he grew up in Lusaka, Zambia, especially when the AIDS epidemic showed the first serious impact on national health."</seg>
<seg id="2594">"he left Zambia for studying in the United States, first in Louisiana, later in Indiana."</seg>
<seg id="2595">"as a postdoc at the University of Pennsylvania, he conducted himself on the HIV virus before he decided to go back home to support the sambish health system."</seg>
<seg id="2596">"with Global Voices, Dr. Warrier discussed the future of medical research in Zambia and about misconceptions of the media about this research."</seg>
<seg id="2597">(Disclaimer: Dr. Warrier talks as a private person).</seg>
<seg id="2598">Global Voices (GV): what is your research topic?</seg>
<seg id="2599">Ranjit Warrier RW: at the moment the focus of my work is on the application of research results. I support the sambc national programme for antiretroviral therapy (ART) with laboratory tests.</seg>
<seg id="2600">"in addition, I am currently staring a research program for the development of molecular diagnostic tests for HIV, TB and other relevant pathogens."</seg>
<seg id="2601">GM: what do you think are the important current scientific topics in your country and in general in Africa?</seg>
<seg id="2602">How do they differ from those in Western countries?</seg>
<seg id="2603">RW: there is no basic research here. we only use solutions that have been developed elsewhere.</seg>
<seg id="2604">"this must change, otherwise we will always be receivers instead of being mutacher."</seg>
<seg id="2605">"the solutions we get are often not suitable in our environment, and sometimes it is even impossible to use them here."</seg>
<seg id="2606">GM: where does the financing and support come from?</seg>
<seg id="2607">Is it sufficient?</seg>
<seg id="2608">How easy or difficult is it to find suitable scientists for the projects?</seg>
<seg id="2609">RW: from the USA and Europe.</seg>
<seg id="2610">The projects are being funded differently.</seg>
<seg id="2611">"it is difficult to find people who want to come back or go here, because financing and development opportunities are better in other countries."</seg>
<seg id="2612">GV: what is the research infrastructure?</seg>
<seg id="2613">What obstacles are there in your routine research work that you did not have before?</seg>
<seg id="2614">"RW: the basic infrastructure does not comply with the standards in developed countries. it costs a lot of money, a continuous supply of electricity, water and internet."</seg>
<seg id="2615">"laboratory equipment is expensive, and it takes months to import it from other countries."</seg>
<seg id="2616">GM: what is the opinion of the public about science and scientists in Africa?</seg>
<seg id="2617">"RW: there is already interest, but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods."</seg>
<seg id="2618">I would suggest that critical thinking and scientific methods should be taught in schools to improve the situation.</seg>
<seg id="2619">"GM: how big is your opinion the potential of scientific research in Africa, what should they concentrate, and how can we support the development?"</seg>
<seg id="2620">RW: the potential is amazing.</seg>
<seg id="2621">I have seen great students of all ages.</seg>
<seg id="2622">"there is need for special scientific training, starting at any age."</seg>
<seg id="2623">"social sciences, computer science, big data, research of space, health care (non-transferable and contagious diseases) and the efficiency of traditional medicine will benefit from this."</seg>
<seg id="2624">"GM: can you describe the advantages and disadvantages of life as a scientist in Africa across Western countries, based on your experience?"</seg>
<seg id="2625">"RW: often it is the limited speed to do things, and the difficult access to scientific expertise, which presents challenges here."</seg>
<seg id="2626">"the system, that magazines can only be made available for payment (the so-called" "Paywall" "), also limits the amount of available information and the speed of research."</seg>
<seg id="2627">From the USA to India: how "Open Source" seed producers change global food production</seg>
<seg id="2628">"this post by Rachel Cernansky was originally published on Ensia.com website, a magazine that reports about solutions for environmental problems worldwide."</seg>
<seg id="2629">Frank Morton has been breeding in the USA since the 1980s.</seg>
<seg id="2630">"its company offers 114 varieties, such as Outredress, the first plant that has been cultivated and consumed by NASA astronauts in space."</seg>
<seg id="2631">"for almost 20 years, Morton's work was limited only by its own imagination and the question of how many salaries he can get, limits set."</seg>
<seg id="2632">But at the beginning of the 2000 he noticed that more and more salads were patented and that he could not use them further for breeding.</seg>
<seg id="2633">"the patents do not only apply to individual varieties, but also for certain properties such as resistance to diseases, a special red or green tone or crimped leaves."</seg>
<seg id="2634">"over the past few years, more and more patents have been applied to more and more plants such as grain or cartel varieties. due to this trend, plant breeders, environmentalists and experts ensure food security for the future of food production."</seg>
<seg id="2635">"as a passionate representative of a millennia of old tradition Morton is still breeding salad, but it takes longer since his work is increasingly difficult."</seg>
<seg id="2636">It is as if in a river a boulder is lying around that I have to dull.</seg>
<seg id="2637">"so we have to do that now, but it is a break with the breeding tradition," he says. "I think that these patents go too far."</seg>
<seg id="2638">"and if they stand in court, no one can breed a new kind of salad, because all of the features are already patented."</seg>
<seg id="2639">"however, he is very careful and endeavouring to not use any material that is protected as intellectual property."</seg>
<seg id="2640">He also joined a movement that is getting bigger in the United States and everywhere in the world: open Source Breeding ("Open Source" trains).</seg>
<seg id="2641">"astronauts of the International Space Station ISS have bred and eaten red Roman salat of the" "greenhouse" "of the station. there it is testing whether plants can be grown in space."</seg>
<seg id="2642">Photo: NASA</seg>
<seg id="2643">It is no coincidence that this name rather sounds as if the movement is from the IT area and not from the area of plant breeding.</seg>
<seg id="2644">"the Open Source Seed Initiative (Initiative for" Open Source "seed) is inspired by the movement for free" open source "software, which provides alternatives to copyrighted software."</seg>
<seg id="2645">"it was created to ensure that some plant species and genes are not protected as intellectual property, thus permanently usable for plant breeders."</seg>
<seg id="2646">"as part of the initiative, called Ossi, the breeders can commit themselves to the fact that others can use the seeds bred by them freely."</seg>
<seg id="2647">"however, this does not mean that they do not want to continue doing business with their seeds and sell it." open source "breeders only allow others who buy seeds to breed it, and it will not be sold immediately - two aspects which are prohibited or prescribed by many plant patents."</seg>
<seg id="2648">Dozens of breeders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since their start in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2649">Gloomy outlook</seg>
<seg id="2650">"for the Professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison and Ossi board member Jack Kloppenburg, control over seeds and the possibility to breed new plants, both important for food security and environmental protection."</seg>
<seg id="2651">"independent breeders would try to use the latter, or only little by breeding seeds with natural resistance."</seg>
<seg id="2652">Kloppenburg stresses that the "open source" movement does not deal with genetically modified plants.</seg>
<seg id="2653">"all types of plants could be patented, whether vegetables, grains, genetically modified or not, from ecological agriculture or not."</seg>
<seg id="2654">Food sovereignty without food sovereignty is not possible. "</seg>
<seg id="2655">"the members of the Open Source Seed Initiative agree to keep their seeds available free of charge, as opposed to patented seeds and plant features."</seg>
<seg id="2656">Photo by Jack Kloppenburg.</seg>
<seg id="2657">"Ossi supporters argue that the future of food supply is compromised, because the available gene pool due to the increasingly numerous intellectual property rights on plant material, which is thus always available, is steadily shrinking."</seg>
<seg id="2658">"Claire Luby, director of the Ossi, has engaged in her PhD thesis with genetic variation in carrots and their availability. she found out that about a third of all cartel features are protected as intellectual property, making it possible for plant breeders either at all or only difficult to use."</seg>
<seg id="2659">"for other plants there are still no estimates, but experts like Luby suspect that massenically grown plants like wheat are still patented as salad or carrots."</seg>
<seg id="2660">A Question of Visions</seg>
<seg id="2661">"plants are bred in such a way that they have specifically desired characteristics - from those through which their taste or colour improves up to those, because they thrive in certain environments and withstand threats such as pests or diseases."</seg>
<seg id="2662">"opponents of patents on plant properties indicate that the available plant material for breeders is decreasing by ever more patents. genetic diversity is currently more necessary than ever, as the altered conditions are much worse predictable due to climate change."</seg>
<seg id="2663">"in an e-mail, Monsanto spokesperson Carly Scaduto acknowledges that genetic diversity is generally important and also crucial for Monsanto's activities."</seg>
<seg id="2664">"however, it contradicts that intellectual property offers other breeders as patents and the protection of plant varieties promote innovation." "a patent is basically a plan that everyone can follow as soon as the patent has expired."</seg>
<seg id="2665">Often these instructions help others to come with another method for the same result.</seg>
<seg id="2666">"such protection does not inhibit innovation, but encourages them by providing more material and expertise to the public."</seg>
<seg id="2667">"Morton sees that in a different way: 20 years to wait until a patent expended, there will certainly be no innovations."</seg>
<seg id="2668">"and if you have to wait for so long to breed on plants that are adapted to the altered environmental conditions, you have already lost the battle."</seg>
<seg id="2669">"however, the main argument for Morton is that genetic resources have always been a general good and it should remain:" independent plant breeders have neither the time nor money for such formalities, and monetary incentives are not attractive to us. "</seg>
<seg id="2670">We want farmers to make their work easier.</seg>
<seg id="2671">"this is what drives us, and it is impossible for us to continue using the best and newest genetic resources."</seg>
<seg id="2672">"all in all, Morton interferes with the concept of patented plant features:" we do not really create the characteristics themselves. "</seg>
<seg id="2673">The plants form them themselves and as a breeder we have no idea how the plants do that.</seg>
<seg id="2674">A mystery of nature. "</seg>
<seg id="2675">"for Carol Deppe, Plant breeder in the US state Oregon and Ossi board member, there is another important aspect of plant breeding:" whoever breeds a variety breeds his own values into them. "</seg>
<seg id="2676">Those who believe in industrial agriculture with great farms and monocultures are needed for their cultivation of mass-wise herbicides that breed into its varieties of this concept of agriculture.</seg>
<seg id="2677">My concept is very opposite. "</seg>
<seg id="2678">"while some medium-sized companies (such as Monsanto) have patents, they create most smaller seed companies, even without patents to survive - either they reject the experiment or they hold it for too expensive and therefore not rewarding or both are the case."</seg>
<seg id="2679">The independent plant breeder Frank Morton looks for Salate in his breeding garden.</seg>
<seg id="2680">Photo by Karen Morton.</seg>
<seg id="2681">"in addition, Morton believes that breeders by avoiding plant patents are more innovative:" it looks like I am with my efforts to produce new, stronger than businesses that patented. "</seg>
<seg id="2682">"I always need new material for my catalog, as I know that my competitors are selling my varieties within a few years," he says. "with a patent you are protected for 20 years ahead of competition, which makes it very easy for my opinion." "</seg>
<seg id="2683">"although the US seems to be a leader in the" Open Source "breeding, the concept is now spreading rapidly around the world."</seg>
<seg id="2684">"in India, the centre for sustainable agriculture (" Centre for Sustainable Agriculture "), which describes itself as a professional organisation in the field of resources, is a" open source "seed program."</seg>
<seg id="2685">It also supports them to come to "Open Source" seeds and sell their own.</seg>
<seg id="2686">"the German Organization Agrecol is working on an open source license, which is ultimately a formal and legally binding form of the Ossi obligation for breeders in the European Union."</seg>
<seg id="2687">(regulations for breeders differ from country to country because the Ossi obligation can not easily be adopted one to one in Europe or other parts of the world.)</seg>
<seg id="2688">"at the beginning of November 2016, the Executive Committee of the European Union, the European Commission, states that conventionally bred plants should not be patented."</seg>
<seg id="2689">"however, an explanation is not a law; now it is on the governments of the Member States to bring the patent office to implement this new line."</seg>
<seg id="2690">"in October 2016, the Dutch organization Hivos organized a conference on" Open Source "seed systems in Ethiopia where farmers, operators of seed banks and representatives from all over East Africa gathered to learn about the" Open Source "seed movement and the worldwide trend towards the patenting of seeds."</seg>
<seg id="2691">"Willy Douma, responsible for Hivos' program for" Open Source "seed systems explains that the organization is currently building a worldwide alliance for" Open Source "seed systems, for which planned next year will be the official launch."</seg>
<seg id="2692">"a merger of environmental protection and development aid groups (including Hivos, the international non-profit development aid organisation USC Canada and the action group on erosion, technology and concentration - Action Group on Erosion, Technology and Concentration) has compiled a database on seed and biodiversity around the world to publish the Seed Map Project, a seed map."</seg>
<seg id="2693">"in September, the Global Alliance for the Future of Food, the global alliance for the future of food - a network of aid organisations such as the WK Kellogg Foundation, the McKnight Foundation and others - has published a report."</seg>
<seg id="2694">"the report also emphasizes the importance of a diverse, local supply of seeds for sustainable food systems - a connection from the Luby of Ossi hoping to see more people soon."</seg>
<seg id="2695">"the exercise for regional and ecological foods has focused especially on where and how little is grown, and seed systems have hardly played a role," says Luby. "we are now trying to make people clear that there is even more behind their food."</seg>

<seg id="2733">His articles revolve around politics and the human rights situation in Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="2734">"in a Facebook comment, Ziada referred to the blocking of the government and reflected what this means for him:"</seg>
<seg id="2735">"to block blogs is very old, however, in the era of Abdelfattah al-Sisi's priority, and even if the blocking of blogs may not be significant for the world, it is for two reasons for me:"</seg>

<seg id="2740">"but now, after they have blocked him and that they are afraid of words, I can still change the link or create a second blog."</seg>

<seg id="2745">"on Monday, June 12, we noticed how the blocking of websites that VPNs offer, began."</seg>
<seg id="2746">Such a practice indicates the government's intention to continue blocking and filter content that Egyptian users could access.</seg>
<seg id="2747">"the situation will additionally be worsened by the fact that the decision-making decisions are made behind closed doors, whereby the Egyptian population has no legal basis by means of which they can proceed to court against these acts."</seg>

<seg id="2753">"day after day newspapers in all Brazil report with dark headlines from Rio de Janeiro, the second largest city in the country and home of numerous postcard motives."</seg>
<seg id="2754">Some of these headlines are as follows:</seg>

<seg id="2756">"in the middle of the economic crisis and in a tense financial situation, the wave of violence in Rio reached the highest level for 10 years."</seg>
<seg id="2757">The Brazilian non-governmental organization Global Justice even called the United Nations to intervene.</seg>
<seg id="2758">Reports like these have become everyday and this is unacceptable and # 8212; you will find at least the managers of a local newspaper.</seg>
<seg id="2759">"in this way, the magazine" Extra "published the editorial reporting on violence in Rio on August 16," That is not normal, "in which she announced to set up a new section called" "War in Rio". ""</seg>
<seg id="2760">All reports on violence in the city are now published there.</seg>
<seg id="2761">The newspaper has explained the motives for their decision in such a way:</seg>
<seg id="2762">"it will continue to report on crimes that happen in every major city in the world like murder, robbery, sexual crimes, etc. everything, however, deviates from the civilized standard and what happens only in Rio, will be published in the" War in Rio "section.

<seg id="2763">This is the only alternative so that we as journalists do not close our eyes to cruelty.</seg>
<seg id="2764">"in a four-minute video shared on Facebook, Octávio Guedes, editor-in-chief of the newspaper, stated that this decision was not a reason for pride, but rather a sign of failure:"</seg>
<seg id="2765">It is probably the only newspaper all over the world with a war break in a country that does not recognize the war.</seg>
<seg id="2766">"in the same video, a journalist from the newspaper explains that according to the Institute for Internal Security in Rio de Janeiro, there are 843 territories controlled by criminal organisations."</seg>

<seg id="2771">"in an article on the news portal The Intercept Brasil, the journalist Cecília Oliveira argues that violence as a" war "is arguing."</seg>

<seg id="2782">"in the beginning, this actually led to a decrease of violent deaths. for some years, however, the UPP has become increasingly under bombardment after several reports on terror and repression against the poor communities, which should protect the newly created police unit."</seg>
<seg id="2783">"on his Facebook page, the journalist João Paulo Charleaux cited from one of his articles from the year 2010 in which he explains why the violence in Rio does not comply with the criteria set by the Geneva Convention - criteria for the term" civil war. ""</seg>
<seg id="2784">He writes:</seg>
<seg id="2785">"in addition to legal issues, the classification of the situation in Rio as a war also draws serious consequences for people."</seg>

<seg id="2833">Several hundred people protested in many districts in Portugal on 21 October and demanded justice for the victims of the fires that took place in the north of Portugal in the week before.</seg>
<seg id="2834">Forty-two people died and about 70 injured in the forest fires of 15 and 16 October. this resulted in the government's last week of solidarity with the victims for 3 days.</seg>
<seg id="2835">"fires were also registered in the Galicia region in Spain, where there were 4 dead."</seg>
<seg id="2836">"it is estimated that there were more than 500 fire outbreaks, spread in the northern and central regions of the country and reached some 250 million hectares of forest and numerous villages."</seg>
<seg id="2837">"in June, a similar tragedy occurred in Pedrógão Grande, where there were 64 deaths and more than 200 injured."</seg>
<seg id="2838">"according to the European forest surveillance system, which monitors the forest areas by satellite photos, about 500,000 hectares of forest are burned in Portugal alone in 2017 - an area of the size of the Lisbon district."</seg>
<seg id="2839">So that you can make a better picture of the gravity of the situation: there is no fire only in 4 districts.</seg>

<seg id="2854">"the environmental organization Quercus pointed out that large areas with eucalyptus, trees made of easily combustible wood, as in a vicious circle, still spread further after fires of this kind."</seg>
<seg id="2855">"in addition to these problems, the website of the civil defence of Portugal on 15 and 16 October, when people sought information or tried to contact relatives, was offline."</seg>
<seg id="2856">It was a private initiative that provided the people with information: they used their own civil protection data using the fogos.pt application and informed the population in real time about the location and spread of fires.</seg>
<seg id="2857">"the project was launched in 2015 by the developer João Pina in order to simplify the work of fire brigade and became so crucial in this fateful weekend in October, that the servers did not withstand the onslaught of 400,000 users who followed the fires: the website counted more than half a million hits."</seg>

<seg id="2886">Many Hazara left the country towards Pakistan or Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2887">"a few days after his flight, Asharaf found himself in Pakistan."</seg>
<seg id="2888">For a few years he worked in a coal mine. the work was heavy and made him sick.</seg>
<seg id="2889">"then he took what was left of his low wages, and went to Iran. once again, he was in a foreign country along with other refugees and dragged sacks with mortars that were heavier than he himself, to earn his livelihood."</seg>
<seg id="2890">"back then, as today, the life of Afghan refugees in Iran was characterized by misery and exploitation."</seg>
<seg id="2891">"it was really hard," "Asharaf recalled in an interview with Global Voices." "we (Afghan refugees) lived in an empty building on the building site, on which we also worked."</seg>
<seg id="2892">"there was no service and no heating there. we hung nylon in front of the open windows, so that we didn't get frozen at night."</seg>
<seg id="2893">"after four years, Asharaf left his life without papers in Iran and made ready for the trip to Europe."</seg>
<seg id="2894">"during the dangerous crossing on the sea, he suffered shipwreck and stranded on a small, uninhabited Greek island."</seg>
<seg id="2895">"after the Greek authorities rejected his asylum application, Asharaf came to Italy in 2002."</seg>
<seg id="2896">"some time ago Asharaf was homeless, ran alone through the streets of Rome, slept in parks and went to a church distributed twice a day food to aid needy."</seg>
<seg id="2897">"it is true that Italy is a second chance for expired asylum seekers due to relatively high surveillance rates, but it is also true that the conditions for asylum seekers in the country are disastrous."</seg>
<seg id="2898">"the human rights organisation Civil Liberties Union for Europe writes, the system" suffers from a general lack of transparency. "</seg>
<seg id="2899">"the vast majority of asylum seekers will be accommodated in more than 3000" "special reception centres". "these are improvised institutions in the hands of unqualified and unprepared personnel."</seg>
<seg id="2900">"according to Italian law, asylum seekers can only be allocated to a reception centre if they officially submitted an application for asylum - which can go for months after the registration of the asylum application."</seg>
<seg id="2901">"until then, people who have no money for accommodation either rely on the hospitality of friends or have to sleep on the street."</seg>
<seg id="2902">So there was also Asharaf.</seg>
<seg id="2903">But his foolish lifestyles helped Asharaf to soon liberate themselves from these conditions.</seg>
<seg id="2904">"after spending several years working in the construction industry for several years, Asharaf put his entire savings into the establishment of a hostel in Venice."</seg>

<seg id="2933">"users would have to register to use social networks within six months of the submission of the law on the authority's website, stating their full name and ID number."</seg>
<seg id="2934">Anyone who missed this step could be sentenced to six months of imprisonment or sentenced to a sentence.</seg>
<seg id="2935">"the law, which was promoted by sixty MPs, is currently facing the legislative and constitutional committee of the Parliament and is to be debated there."</seg>
<seg id="2936">"in May, another member of Parliament filed a legislative proposal to be introduced in the tougher punishment for the accusation of the President or of a high official."</seg>
<seg id="2937">"under the legislation, such action would be punished with prison and fines, as legal experts from Tahrir Institute for Middle East Policy."</seg>
<seg id="2938">"if the law is passed, this can mean up to three years in prison for the condemned."</seg>
<seg id="2939">"in addition, this would underpin a political climate in which the right to freedom of expression and freedom of assembly already has been in danger for many years."</seg>
<seg id="2940">"a striking example is the case of Mahmoud Abo ZID (known as Shawkan) who was arrested on 13 August 2013 when he took photos of Egyptian policemen, demonstrating violence against demonstrators who had fought against the military coup that led to the amnesty of the elected president Mohammed Morsi."</seg>
<seg id="2941">"Shawkan waited, as more than 700 protesters arrested in the same incident, four years in prison on a date of trial."</seg>
<seg id="2942">"recently, his trial was postponed on May 20, because the prison line, according to human rights groups, failed to bring the defendants from prison to the courtroom."</seg>
<seg id="2943">"Shawkan threatens the death penalty due to one, so many human rights groups agree, false burden of such as weapons possession, illegal gathering, murder and murder."</seg>
<seg id="2944">"in another case, a Criminal Court in Giza issued two journalists Hany Salah-el-Deen and Mosad Al-Barbary. they were indicted for their reporting on the pro-Morsi seat blockade on Raba'a Al-Adawiya square in Cairo."</seg>
<seg id="2945">"the Court also reduced the penalties of the journalists Abdullah al-Fakharany, Samhi Mustafa and Mohamed al-Adly, who were also arrested in the previously mentioned incident, from 25 years to 5 years."</seg>
<seg id="2946">Interrogating Tunisian activists for skillful documents</seg>
<seg id="2947">"Tunisian authorities spent six hours with the interrogation of Sami Ben Gharbia, which co-founder of the independent media platform Nawaat and the Global Voices Advocacy project."</seg>
<seg id="2948">"Ben Gharbia has mainly been interrogated to a leased action plan. said plan comes from the President of the Republic, who expressly endorses a controversial bill of law, which would warrant businessmen and during the former regime by dictator Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali of corruption, if they return all unlawfully preserved funds."</seg>
<seg id="2949">"the document published on the website of Nawaat on April 21, throws light on how the presidential plans for the support of the lawsuit look like."</seg>
<seg id="2950">"Ben Gharkov rejected the nomination of his sources, indicating article 11 of the Tunisian press code, which journalists secures the right to protect their sources."</seg>
<seg id="2951">"nevertheless, he joined the District Court in Tunis on 09 May as a witness."</seg>
<seg id="2952">Does China want to force the users of social media to present their ID?</seg>
<seg id="2953">"according to new provisions of the National Council of People's Republic of China, the users of social media in China require permission before they write or share news in social media."</seg>
<seg id="2954">"in addition, it is stated that the registration with the full real name will be required."</seg>
<seg id="2955">Analysts believe that this eliminates the elimination of anonymous commentaries in social networks. it is still unclear how the authorities will apply these regulations.</seg>
<seg id="2956">"in the social media, Chinese citizens have proposed to enforce these regulations only selectively to protect citizens' journalism and its independence."</seg>
