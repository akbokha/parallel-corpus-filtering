that is James Ris@@ en .
maybe you know him because he won the Pul@@ itzer Prize as a New @-@ York Times rep@@ orter .
&quot; long before anyone had heard of Edward Snow@@ den , Ris@@ en wrote a book in which he published spectac@@ ularly that the N@@ SA illeg@@ ally listened to phones from Americans . &quot;
but there is another chapter that should leave a lasting impression .
&quot; in this he describes a cat@@ astrop@@ hic US intelligence operation , in which the CIA literally translated the Iranian dra@@ fts for a nuclear bomb . &quot;
&quot; if this sounds crazy , read it . &quot;
it is an incredible story .
but do you know who the chapter did not fall ?
the US government .
&quot; for almost 10 years , the government has determined against cra@@ cks and urged him to name his alleged sources . &quot;
&quot; in this train , he became a symbol of the design of the government to condemn whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wers and to spy on journalists . &quot;
&quot; according to the First Constitutional Court , the media have the right to publish secret information . &quot;
&quot; but it is impossible to apply this right if media do not get this information , and if they cannot protect the identity of the brave they offer . &quot;
&quot; so when the government arrived at Ris@@ en , he did something that many cour@@ age@@ ous rep@@ or@@ ters did before him : he refused and said that he would rather go to jail . &quot;
&quot; from 2007 to 2015 , Ris@@ en lived with the risk of going into prison . &quot;
&quot; but then , only days before the trial , something extraordinary . &quot;
&quot; suddenly , although for years they have stated that it would be essential in their case , the demands of the government on cra@@ cks were dropped . &quot;
the reason : in the time of electronic surveillance the rep@@ or@@ ters and sources can be hidden more and more .
&quot; instead of separ@@ ating and bringing tears to the testimony , that could also do his digital foot@@ prints for him . &quot;
&quot; and so the investig@@ ators , without his consent , have kept secret of his teleph@@ ony , &quot;
&quot; as well as its e @-@ mail data , financial and bank information , its credit card , and even travel information with the list of its flights . &quot;
&quot; in the midst of this information , they found evidence they used to condemn Jeff@@ rey Ster@@ ling , a CIA whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower and Ris@@ en &apos;s supposed source . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , this is only one of many cases . &quot;
&quot; President Obama promised to protect whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wers , but instead the judi@@ ci@@ ary has more condem@@ ns than all US governments before him . &quot;
&quot; now you can imagine how this can be a problem , especially because the government has too much of its work as secret . &quot;
&quot; since September 11 , almost every article about national security was the result of a whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower went to a journalist . &quot;
&quot; so we put the press work on the game , which is to be protected by the first constitutional order , because the government has more and more possibilities to spy on everyone . &quot;
&quot; but just as the government &apos;s technology allows to b@@ ypass the rights of rep@@ or@@ ters , the press can also use technologies to better protect their sources . &quot;
&quot; and indeed , they can do that from the moment they contact , rather than in hin@@ d@@ sight , in the testimony . &quot;
&quot; today there are communication software , which has not yet existed when Ris@@ en had written his book , and it is much safer than normal emails or phone calls . &quot;
&quot; such technology is Sec@@ ure@@ Drop , an open source transmission system for whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower that was originally developed by Aaron S@@ wart@@ z , and is today developed by the Freedom of the Press Foundation in which I have been working . &quot;
&quot; instead of sending an e @-@ mail , go to a news website , just like the Washington Post . &quot;
&quot; there you can upload documents or send information , as with any usual contact form . &quot;
&quot; these are then encrypted and stored on a server , to which only the relevant news agency has access . &quot;
&quot; so the government can no longer proc@@ ure information secre@@ tly , and many of the information they would request would not be available from the outset . &quot;
&quot; however , Sec@@ ure@@ Drop is only a small part of the whole to protect the freedom of the press in the 21st century . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , governments around the world are developing new es@@ pion@@ age technologies that thre@@ aten us all . &quot;
&quot; it is important to us to ensure that not only technology denom@@ in@@ ators such as Edward Snow@@ den have a chance to apply mis@@ deeds . it &apos;s just as important that we protect the next whi@@ stle @-@ blo@@ wers , &quot;
or the next environmental lab@@ our@@ er who aler@@ ts alarm to contaminated water from F@@ lin@@ t . or a Wall Street insi@@ der that war@@ ns us from the next financial crisis .
&quot; after all , these technologies were not only made for those who want to expose the crimes , but to protect our all constitutional rights . &quot;
thanks .
&#91; on 3 April 2016 the biggest data le@@ ck of the story was published . &#93; &#91; the &quot; Panama Papers &quot; reveal that rich and mighty &#93; &#91; huge sums of money in tax ha@@ v@@ ens have hidden . &#93; &#91; what does that mean ? &#93; &#91; we b@@ ade Robert Pal@@ mer of Global Wit@@ ness for an explanation . &#93;
the publication of these documents gives a small insight into the secret world of tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
&quot; we get an impression of how customers , banks and lawyers go to companies such as Mos@@ elle Fon@@ sec@@ a and say : &quot; okay , we need an anonymous company . can you set up this ? &quot;
&quot; we actually see the e @-@ mails , the exchange of messages , as the whole system works as it works . &quot;
this has already led to very direct consequences .
Iceland &apos;s prime minister res@@ igned .
there are also reports that an ally of the brutal Syrian dict@@ ator Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad has mail@@ box offices in tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
&quot; it is alleged that a trace of US $ 2 billion leads to Russian President Vladimir Putin , about a close friend of children &apos;s days , a famous cell@@ ist . &quot;
&quot; now there will be a lot of rich people out there and others who wait for the next release , and on the next un@@ veiled documents . &quot;
now it sounds like the plot of a agency enth@@ r@@ ill@@ ers or a John Gr@@ is@@ ham &apos;s novel .
&quot; it seems crying from you , me , ordinary people . &quot;
why should we do that ?
&quot; but the truth is : if the rich and powerful are able to hide their wealth in tax ha@@ v@@ ens and not all pay their taxes , this means less money for important public services such as health care , education , roads . &quot;
and that concerns all of us .
&quot; for my organization , Global Wit@@ ness , these revel@@ ations are phenom@@ enal . &quot;
&quot; in the whole world media and leading politicians , how secret tax ha@@ v@@ ens are used by some few to hide their fortun@@ es and disgu@@ ise them -- something that we have been discussing and revealing for ten years . &quot;
&quot; I think many people seem very conf@@ using this whole world , and it &apos;s hard to understand how these tax ha@@ v@@ ens work . &quot;
I always imagine it like a mat@@ r@@ jo@@ sch@@ kap@@ u@@ ppe .
&quot; so one has a company in another company , in another company , which makes it almost impossible to really understand who is behind these bones . &quot;
&quot; it can be very difficult for prosec@@ uting and tax authorities , as well as for journalists or civil society to really understand what is happening . &quot;
I find it interesting that there are fewer reports on this matter in the USA .
&quot; presum@@ ably , because there have been no prominent Americans who occurred in these revel@@ ations , this sc@@ andal . &quot;
&quot; now , it is not that there are no rich Americans who hide their wealth in tax ha@@ v@@ ens . &quot;
&quot; but by the principle of which these tax ha@@ v@@ ens function , Mos@@ sack Fon@@ sec@@ a has less American customers . &quot;
&quot; if we had a data le@@ ak from the Cay@@ man Islands or even from Del@@ aware , Wy@@ oming or Nevada , we would see a lot more cases and examples that have connections to the USA . &quot;
&quot; in fact , there is less information in some US states to give less information to establish a company than to get a library card . &quot;
this type of in@@ transparency in the United States has allowed employees of school districts to rip school children off .
it has allowed sc@@ amm@@ ers to rip especially sus@@ cep@@ tible investors .
it is this kind of behavior that affects all of us .
&quot; here at Global Wit@@ ness , we wanted to find out how it looks like all this in practice . &quot;
how does it actually work ?
so we sent a cover@@ t investig@@ ator into the offices of 13 lawyers in Manhattan .
&quot; our investig@@ ator proved to be an African minister , who wanted to bring suspic@@ ious money to the US to buy a house , a yacht , a private jet . &quot;
we really sho@@ cked it that everyone had suggestions to our investig@@ ator as he could transfer his money .
&quot; none of these lawyers took us as a client , and of course nobody was given money to anybody . however , it shows the problem with this system . &quot;
it is also important not to consider this as an individual case .
&quot; it is not about a single lawyer , who has submitted proposals to our cover@@ t investig@@ ator . &quot;
&quot; it is not about a single leading politi@@ cian , involved in a sc@@ andal . &quot;
&quot; it is about how the system works , through corruption , tax ev@@ asion , poverty and inst@@ ability . &quot;
&quot; and in order to cope with this , we have to change the rules of the game . &quot;
we need to change the rules to make this kind of behavior harder .
&quot; this may sound very sad , as if we can &apos;t do anything about it ; as if nothing has ever changed , as if there is always the rich and powerful . &quot;
&quot; but as a secure optim@@ ist , I see quite a lot to change . &quot;
&quot; over the past few years , we have seen proj@@ ections to more transparency , which concerns the owners of companies . &quot;
the topic found political attention by British Prime Minister David Cameron on the G@@ 8 summit in 2013 in Northern Ireland .
&quot; since then , the EU has been regi@@ stering in central regi@@ sters on a national level , who really is behind companies in Europe and who controls it . &quot;
one of the unpleasant facts is that the US lag@@ ged behind .
&quot; representatives of both parties have submitted a bill in both parliam@@ ent@@ arians , but this does not make the progress we would like to see . &quot;
&quot; we would really like to see how these Panama revel@@ ations , this huge insight into the world of tax ha@@ v@@ ens , is used as a means to ensure greater transparency in the United States and globally . &quot;
&quot; for us at Global Wit@@ ness , this is a moment for changes . &quot;
we need ordinary people who will be angry when they see how other people can hide their true identity behind false companies .
we need leaders in the economy that stand up and say : &quot; transparency is not good for business . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we need leading politicians who recognize the problem and use them to end this kind of in@@ transparency through laws . &quot;
&quot; together we can finally end the In@@ transpar@@ ence , which now offers this type of tax ev@@ asion , corruption and money la@@ under@@ ing . &quot;
this is the story as I almost kid@@ n@@ apped and landed in the trunk of a red Maz@@ das .
&quot; a day after I finished my design studies , I made a back@@ yard sale . &quot;
a guy in the red Maz@@ da stopped and looked at my stuff .
he bought one of my works of art .
he was alone in the city and just made a road trip across the country . after that he would go to the peace cor@@ ps .
I invited him to a beer . he told me how he wanted to change the world .
it was late . I was tired .
&quot; while we paid the bill , I made the mistake to ask him : &quot; &quot; where do you sleep tonight ? &quot;
&quot; he made the whole thing even worse : &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know yet . &quot;
&quot; and I thought , &quot; Oh , man ! &quot;
what do I do now ? &quot;
who does not know the situation ?
do I have to offer a sleeping place now ?
&quot; but I just got to know him ! he says he would go to the Corps of Peace , but I don &apos;t know if he really plans it . I don &apos;t want to end up in the trunk of a Maz@@ das ! &quot;
this is a small trunk !
then I heard : &quot; I have an air mattress . you can sleep in my living room . &quot;
&quot; a voice in my head said , &quot; &quot; u@@ h , as please ? &quot;
&quot; at night I was lying in bed , I star@@ ed at the ceiling and thought : &quot; Oh man ! what did I rock myself ? &quot;
a wild alien sleeping in my living room .
what if he is mad ?
&quot; I got such fear that I went out of bed , sne@@ aking on to@@ es to the door , and my bedroom door closed . &quot;
but he was not crazy .
we are still in contact .
the work of art he bought from me hangs today in his classroom . he is now a teacher .
that was my first experience as a host . it has completely changed my point of view .
&quot; maybe the people who were sold to me in childhood as a stranger , actually friends who were only waiting to be discovered ? &quot;
&quot; when I moved to San Francisco , I took the air mattress . &quot;
&quot; let &apos;s make a leap , two years later ... &quot;
&quot; I am unemployed , fast , my ro@@ ommate shares and the rent is increased . &quot;
I learned that at that time there was a design conference in the city . all hotels were fully booked .
I think creativity can create it to transform fear into fun .
&quot; I wrote to my best friend and new ro@@ ommate Brian Ch@@ es@@ ky : &quot; Brian , I think about how we could make something about it . our apartment will stay at a designer bed and breakfast . young designers can stay with us , Wi @-@ Fi and a desk included , including a mattress and breakfast each morning . &quot;
ha !
we created a website and founded so &quot; air mattress and breakfast &quot; &#91; AIR@@ Bed a@@ N@@ d Breakfast = Air@@ b@@ n@@ b &#93; .
three lucky guests were allowed to sleep at us for 20 dollars on the air mattress on wooden floors .
&quot; they found it super , and we too . &quot;
&quot; I am sure that our cheese pro@@ sci@@ ut@@ to che@@ eses ta@@ sted completely different , because we made it for our guests . &quot;
&quot; we tou@@ red with them throughout the city . when we said good@@ bye to our last guest and the door was falling into the castle , Brian and I star@@ ed . &quot;
had we just discovered that we could find new friends at the same time and could pay our rent ?
things came in roles .
&quot; my former ro@@ ommate , N@@ ate Ble@@ char@@ czy@@ k , joined us as a developer . &quot;
we wanted to find out whether to make it a business concept .
&quot; we presented ourselves to investors : &quot; we want to create a website where people post public pictures of their private rooms , their bedrooms , their bathrooms -- the kind of rooms whose doors are closed when you visit . &quot;
&quot; over the Internet , they can then invite wild people to stay with them . &quot;
this will be the next big thing ! &quot;
we waited for the ro@@ cket to ign@@ ite .
&quot; indeed , they do not . &quot;
&quot; no one , who is still at Tro@@ st , would invest in a business that allows foreigners to sleep in apartments of other people . &quot;
why ?
because we all learned as children that stran@@ gers are dangerous .
&quot; if you have a problem , you get to the things that you can do well . we could design . &quot;
&quot; at the Kunst@@ akademie , we learned that design is much more than just appearance and feel -- it is the overall experience . &quot;
&quot; we had learned how to design objects , but now we wanted to create immense trust between people who never met before . &quot;
can design do something like that ?
is it possible to create trust with design ?
I would like to give you a sample of what degree of confidence we asp@@ ire to .
it is a 30 @-@ second experiment . it will force you out of your comfort zone .
th@@ um@@ bs up when you are ready .
take your mobile phone into your hand .
now I want you to un@@ lock your mobile phone .
give your un@@ locked cell phone to your left bench neighbour .
this silent flight of panic you can now feel -- -- is exactly what hosts feel when they open the door for the first time .
the only thing more personal than your mobile phone is your home .
&quot; visitors can not only read your SMS , they see your bedroom , your kitchen , your toilet . &quot;
how does it feel to hold the un@@ locked cell phone of a stranger ?
most sense the responsibility .
most guests feel like staying somewhere else .
only for this reason our company can exist .
&quot; only once , who actually has Al Gor@@ es mobile ? &quot;
could you please announce on Twitter that he will be the President of the President ?
you can now return the cell phones now .
you have now experienced what kind of trust we want to build . I want to tell you about some discoveries .
what if we had changed a little detail in this experiment ?
&quot; what if your neighbor would have imagined it once with his name , if he had told where he comes from wh@@ ence his dog or his children are ? &quot;
imagine you would have 150 evalu@@ ations that all say : &quot; he can really capture very well un@@ locked mobile phones !
how would you feel if you would have to leave your mobile phone ?
because a well thought @-@ out feedback system strengthens trust in a decisive way .
at the beginning we did some things wrong .
it was hard for the people to leave negative jud@@ gements .
&quot; in the end , we decided to wait until both hosts and guests had given their evalu@@ ations before we put them online . &quot;
last week we discovered something new .
&quot; we conducted a study with Stan@@ ford . we examined how likely it is that people trust each other , depending on how similar they are regarding age and place of residence . &quot;
&quot; not surprisingly , we trust most people who are most similar to us . &quot;
&quot; the more differences we find , the less we trust . &quot;
this is a natural social bias .
it will be exciting to add a person &apos;s reputation -- in our case by jud@@ gements .
&quot; if you have less than three ass@@ essments , nothing changes . &quot;
&quot; but if you have more than ten , everything changes . &quot;
a good reputation sti@@ ff simil@@ arities .
the right design can help us overcome some of our deep @-@ rooted preference .
&quot; in addition , we learned that trust depends on how much one is offered . &quot;
here you can see the reactions to the first message of a guest .
&quot; if you tell too little , like &quot; Hi , &quot; you don &apos;t get an answer . &quot;
&quot; you tell too much , for example : &quot; I have problems with my mother &quot; -- -- the request will not be accepted . &quot;
&quot; so there is an optimal degree of openness , e.g. &quot; &quot; Tol@@ le works of art in your apartment ! I make holiday with my family holiday . &quot;
how can you create it with design to make this degree of openness ?
we use the size of the text field to recommend the right amount of text . we also provide tips on which topics you should write something .
our whole company builds on the hope that the right design can help overcome our prejudi@@ ces towards stran@@ gers .
&quot; with what we did not expect , the great amount of people who were more than willing to lay down these prejudi@@ ces . &quot;
here you see how many people claim our offer .
you can see three things .
&quot; first , incredibly good luck . &quot;
second : the ti@@ rel@@ ess work of our team .
&quot; third : a need , which had not been met before . &quot;
&quot; for us , the business is going very well . &quot;
&quot; of course , there are times when not everything runs smoothly . &quot;
there were guests who dis@@ allowed parties to celebrate parties or have rav@@ aged apartments .
hosts have guests in the rain .
&quot; at the beginning of the project , I worked on the customer service . all calls came directly to my mobile phone . &quot;
I stood at the forefront when trust was broken .
there is nothing worse than these calls . it hur@@ ts when I only think about it .
&quot; the dis@@ appointment , which one h@@ ears in the voice of the c@@ aller , was and will always be our greatest motivation to further improve . &quot;
&quot; fortunately , the 123 million overnight stays only have a fraction of a problem . &quot;
for people trust each other rightly .
&quot; if confidence works , won@@ dro@@ us can arise . &quot;
one of our guests made a holiday in Uruguay . there he suffered a heart attack .
his host drove him to the hospital .
he even donated blood for the necessary operation !
here is his assessment :
perfect house for travelers who tend to have heart attacks due to sed@@ entary activities .
the area is beautiful and equipped with sufficient hospitals .
&quot; J@@ avier and Ale@@ j@@ andra are true guar@@ dian angels who save lives , even though they don &apos;t know it right . &quot;
&quot; you drive one in your own car to the hospital , when you die , and wait while you get a b@@ ypass . &quot;
&quot; because they don &apos;t want you to feel lonely , they bring books past . &quot;
you can even stay longer without calcul@@ ating extra nights .
I can only recommend it ! &quot;
&quot; of course , not every stay exp@@ ires . &quot;
but these relationships behind the pure money transaction are exactly what you want to achieve with the Share Economy .
&quot; when I stum@@ bled upon this term for the first time , I asked myself : &quot;
how does the idea of sharing with money transactions fit together ?
it is an economic trade .
&quot; but now just call &quot; &quot; rental industry &quot; , &quot; the thing is not justified . &quot;
share Economy describes a trade that promises human relationships .
&quot; people lay a part of themselves open , and that changes everything . &quot;
&quot; when you travel today , this is comparable to Fast Food . it is efficient and reliable , but less authentic . &quot;
what if traveling would be a rich buffet of local impressions ?
&quot; what if in any place you visited , a group there would be waiting for a group to fill a thoroughly and show you a pub craw@@ l area that you have never heard before ; &quot;
or if you could learn cooking from a five @-@ star chef ?
&quot; today , apartments are designed according to the principle of privacy . &quot;
what if we would shape apartments from the ground up to each other ?
how would this look like ?
what if cities would accept the idea of common participation ?
&quot; I imagine cities which allow us society and relationships , instead of lon@@ el@@ iness and de@@ preci@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; in South Korea &apos;s capital Seoul , this project has already begun . &quot;
students who were looking for a place to stay
&quot; were medi@@ ated to people whose children were pulled out , incub@@ ator programs were launched , &quot;
&quot; to be able to finance new startups in the Share economy . on our platform alone , 7@@ 85 000 people in 191 countries will be guest at a stranger or even a host . &quot;
so the idea does not seem to be as crazy as it was taught to us .
we did not re@@ inv@@ ent the wheel .
there were also hospitality previously .
there were similar websites in front of us .
so why did our work just work ?
&quot; apart from luck and timing , we realized that you can find the right design with the components of trust . &quot;
design can help us overcome deep @-@ rooted prejudi@@ ces .
&quot; I think this is amazing , &quot;
almost overwhelming .
every time I have to think about when a red Maz@@ da is passing by me .
&quot; we know , of course , that design cannot solve any problem . &quot;
&quot; but if it could help us if it had this great influence , I wonder why we can use design soon . &quot;
thanks .
what do you think if you watch me ?
a beli@@ ever ? an expert ?
maybe even a sister .
&quot; or supp@@ ressed , bra@@ in@@ washed , a terrorist ? &quot;
or simply a delay in the safety check at the airport .
this is indeed true .
I do not give you the blame for your negative impressions .
so the media portra@@ y people who look like me .
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
studies show that the Americans think most would not know Muslims .
probably people don &apos;t talk to their U@@ ber drivers .
&quot; for all those who have never met a Muslim , it is great to meet you . &quot;
I tell you who I am .
&quot; I am a mother , a coffee maker -- double es@@ pres@@ so , with cream extra . &quot;
&quot; I am intro@@ ver@@ ted , &quot;
a Mö@@ cht@@ eg@@ ern @-@ fitness fan@@ ati@@ ker@@ in
&quot; and I am a practicing , spiritual Muslims . &quot;
&quot; but not like Lady G@@ aga sings , because , baby , I was not born so . &quot;
I have decided to do this .
&quot; when I was 17 years old , I made the decision to ou@@ te me . &quot;
&quot; no , not as a hom@@ os@@ exual man , like some of my friends , but as Muslims . I decided to wear my head@@ gear . &quot;
&quot; my femin@@ ist girl@@ friends were horri@@ fied , &quot; Why do you supp@@ ress yourself ? &quot;
&quot; the funny thing was : at that time , it was a femin@@ ist declaration of independence , in contrast to the pressure I felt 17 @-@ year @-@ old to adapt me to a perfect and un@@ at@@ tain@@ able beauty ideal . &quot;
I have not just accepted the faith of my parents .
I have led with the Koran .
&quot; I read it , thought , questioned , doub@@ ted , and ultimately believed . &quot;
my relationship with God was not love at first sight .
it was trust and slow surrender which deep@@ ened with every reading of the Qur &apos;an .
the beauty of the rhythm sometimes brings me to cry .
I recognize myself in it . I feel that God knows me .
&quot; have you ever had the feeling that someone takes you , fully understands you , and yet somehow loves you ? &quot;
this is how it feels .
&quot; later I married and started , like all the good Egyptians , my career as an engineer . &quot;
&quot; later , after my marriage , I had a child , and basically lived the Egyptian @-@ American dream . &quot;
then came the aw@@ ful morning in September 2001 .
many of you probably remember where they were there .
&quot; I sat in my kitchen , had breakfast at the end , looked at the screen and saw the word &quot; Break@@ ing News . &quot; &quot;
&quot; there was smoke , air@@ planes flew into buildings , people ran out of the buildings . &quot;
what was that ?
an accident ?
a technical fault ?
my shock was quickly transformed into indi@@ gn@@ ation .
why should I do something like that ?
&quot; I switched to the television channel and stopped : ... &quot; Muslim terrorists ... &quot; ... &quot; in the name of Islam ... &quot; ... &quot; ... ji@@ had ... &quot; , &quot; ... &quot; bom@@ bed Mek@@ ka ! &quot;
&quot; Oh , my God . &quot;
&quot; it is not only my country attacked , but in the N@@ u the deeds of others turned me from a citizen into a susp@@ ect . &quot;
&quot; on the same day , we had to drive through the Middle East of the USA to move into a new city and start studying . &quot;
&quot; I remember as I was silent -- as we were sil@@ ently -- so deep it went up into my seat , and I was the first time to be recognized as Muslims . &quot;
&quot; we went into our apartment this night , in a new city where it felt like a completely different world . &quot;
&quot; and then I saw and read the war@@ nings of the national Islamic organisations , who said : &quot; be vig@@ il@@ ant , &quot; &quot; Be careful , &quot; &quot; Stay in well lit areas , &quot; &quot; Don &apos;t take away . &quot;
I stayed the whole week inside .
then it was Friday that week -- the day when Muslims gather to pray .
&quot; and again the war@@ nings said , &quot; &quot; Don &apos;t go on this first Friday , the mos@@ que could be a goal . &quot;
I saw a lot of coverage .
&quot; the feelings were understand@@ ably un@@ filtered , and I also heard of attacks on Muslims or by people that were held for Muslims , drag@@ ging and bang@@ ing . &quot;
there were really fire attacks on mos@@ ques .
I thought : we should stay at home .
but something really did not feel right .
because the people who attacked this country have attacked our country .
I have done the anger of the people on the terrorists .
imagine ! I was angry .
it is not easy to constantly explain itself .
&quot; I have nothing against questions , I love questions . &quot;
they are the accus@@ ations that are tough .
today we can actually say people say : &quot; there is a problem in this country -- it is Muslims .
when will we go ? &quot;
some people want to ban@@ ish Muslims and close mos@@ ques .
they speak of my church like a tumor in the US body .
only the question arises : are we mal@@ ign@@ ant or ben@@ ign ?
they know that a mal@@ ign@@ ant tumor is removed as a whole and a ben@@ ign tumour is just under observation .
the alternatives are point@@ less because the question is wrong .
&quot; Muslims are , like all other Americans , not a tumor in the US &apos;s body , but a vital organ . &quot;
thanks !
&quot; Muslims are the invent@@ ors and teachers , the hel@@ pers and the Olympic Games . &quot;
will the closure of mos@@ ques America make safer ?
&quot; there may be a few parking spaces , but not stop terror . &quot;
&quot; the regular visit of a mos@@ que leads to a more toler@@ ant view of people , and to show greater citizen participation . &quot;
&quot; and as I told me a head of the police in the Washington area , DC recently told : people are actually not radic@@ alised in mos@@ ques . &quot;
they are radic@@ alised in their basement or in bed in front of a computer .
&quot; during the radic@@ alization process , one has found that it begins online . first , the person is cut off from their church , even from their family , so that the extre@@ mi@@ sts believe that the person believes the terrorists are the true Muslims , and everyone who abh@@ ors their behavior and their ideology is a tra@@ itor or of faith . &quot;
&quot; if we want to prevent radic@@ alisation , we must stop people to go to the mos@@ que . &quot;
some will still claim that Islam is a non @-@ violent religion .
&quot; finally , a group like IS establishes its brut@@ ality with the Koran . &quot;
&quot; as a Muslim , as a human being , I believe that we must do everything to stop a group like the IS . &quot;
&quot; but we would add ourselves to their imagination , when they recognize them as representatives of 1.6 billion believers . &quot;
thanks !
the IS has so much to do with Islam as the K@@ u @-@ Klu@@ x cl@@ an with Christianity .
both groups claim their ideology on their &quot; Holy Book . &quot;
&quot; but if you throw a look at her , she does not drive what she las@@ es in her &quot; Holy Scrip@@ tures . &quot; &quot;
it is their brut@@ ality that lets them read these things into Scripture .
an outstanding Ima@@ m recently told me an amazing story :
&quot; a girl came to him , because she preferred to join the IS . &quot;
I was really surprised and asked him if she had been in contact with radical religious leaders .
&quot; he said the problem was exactly the opposite . every priest with whom she spoke , brought her to silence and told her that her anger , her sense of injustice in the world , would only bring them into trouble . &quot;
&quot; inspired by nothing , and something that would have made sense to their fur@@ y , it was a main goal for the instrument@@ alization of extre@@ mi@@ sts that you promised a solution . &quot;
this Ima@@ m returned to God and her church .
&quot; instead of acc@@ using them for their anger , he showed their constructive ways for real change in the world . &quot;
what she learned in the mos@@ que kept her to join the IS .
this was an insight into how the Islam@@ opho@@ bia belongs to me and my family .
but how does it affect ordinary Americans ?
how does it affect everyone else ?
&quot; how does the 24 @-@ hour consuming of fear affect our democracy every day , on our freedom of thought ? &quot;
&quot; a study -- actually several neuro@@ scientific studies -- show : if we fear , at least three things happen . &quot;
&quot; we rather accept an author@@ it@@ arian government system , con@@ formance and prejudi@@ ce . &quot;
&quot; a study shows : if you submit news reports in which negative about Muslims were reported , they rather agree to military attacks on Muslim countries as well as circumc@@ ision of the rights of American Muslims . &quot;
this is not just an academic problem .
&quot; if you look when the mood against Muslims was pushed up -- between 2001 and 2013 -- then this happened three times , but never in connection with terrorist attacks . &quot;
it happened in the run @-@ up of the Iraq war and during two elections .
so Islam@@ opho@@ bia is not simply the natural reaction to Muslim terror as I expected .
&quot; in fact , it can be a tool to manipul@@ ate the public to under@@ mine the foundation of a free society that has reasonable and well informed citizens . &quot;
dealing with Muslims is an early warning sign .
&quot; we may feel it as the first , but the toxic air of fear hur@@ ts us all . &quot;
&quot; with the assignment of collective debt , it is not just about to explain itself . &quot;
&quot; De@@ ah and his wife Y@@ us@@ or were a young , married couple living in Chapel Hill , North Carolina where both went to school . &quot;
De@@ ah was a sport@@ sman .
&quot; he was at the dental faculty , talented , promising ... &quot;
&quot; his sister would say to me that he was the sweet@@ est , generous person she knew . &quot;
she visited him there and he showed her his CV . she was stun@@ ned and said :
&quot; when has my brother become such a skilled young man ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; just a few weeks after the visit of Su@@ z@@ anne with her brother and his wife , her neighbor , Cra@@ ig Stephen H@@ icks , she murdered , just like the Si@@ ster of Y@@ us@@ or , Raz@@ an who had been visiting in the afternoon . he did it in her apartment , as with a execution after he had posted statements against Muslims on his Facebook page . &quot;
he was shot eight times on De@@ ah .
&quot; fan@@ ati@@ cism can be not only im@@ moral , but also fatal . &quot;
so back to the beginning .
what happened after 9 / 11 ?
did we go to the mos@@ que or stayed safe at home ?
&quot; we discussed it and it was no easy decision for us , because it was about which America we want to leave to our children : one that would control us by fear , or one in which we can freely exercise our religion . &quot;
we decided for the mos@@ que .
&quot; with our son in the children &apos;s seat , we rode silent , with high pressure to the mos@@ que . &quot;
&quot; I took him out , and drew my shoes , and went into the hall , and what I saw , let me stand . &quot;
the hall was completely filled .
&quot; then the Ima@@ m made an announcement , thank@@ ed and welcomed our guests , for half of the gathering were Christians , Jews , Budd@@ hi@@ sts , a@@ thei@@ sts , believers and non @-@ believers who came not to attack us , but to assist us . &quot;
in this moment I am collap@@ sed .
these people were there because they had had courage and compassion for panic and prejudi@@ ce .
what will you choose ?
what will you choose at the moment of fear and fan@@ ati@@ cism ?
will you be safe on number ?
or will you join those who mean : we are better than those .
thank you .
thank you very much !
&quot; Helen Wal@@ ters : so D@@ alia , you seem to have met a nerve . &quot;
&quot; but I wonder what you say to those who might say that you are holding a TE@@ D@@ Talk , a mind@@ ful with drau@@ ght , in a noble thought factory , so an exception and not the rule . &quot;
what would you say to those people ?
&quot; D@@ alia Mog@@ ah@@ ed : I would say , don &apos;t dec@@ eive me . I &apos;m completely normal . &quot;
I am no exception .
my story is not unusual .
I am as usual as it is allowed .
&quot; when you look to Muslims around the world , and I did that with the largest ever conducted study on Muslims around the world , people want normal things . &quot;
&quot; they want prosperity for the family , they want work and they want to live in peace . &quot;
so I am in no way an exception .
&quot; if people like an exception tend to appear , then often the rule has been broken , and they are not the exception to the rule . &quot;
HW : thanks . D@@ alia Mog@@ ah@@ ed .
&quot; what started as a platform for hob@@ by@@ ists , is short before becoming a billi@@ on@@ aire business . &quot;
&quot; control , environmental monitoring , photography , film and journ@@ alism : these are some of the potential applications for commercial dr@@ ones . &quot;
&quot; before air p@@ adding in our social consciousness penet@@ rated , an autonomous fleet of aircraft at the FRA@@ C Centre in France has built a six meter high tower of 1 500 bricks . several years ago , they began to fly with rop@@ es . &quot;
&quot; by connecting , flight devices reach high speed and acceleration in tight spaces . &quot;
you can also build independently turn @-@ loaded structures .
&quot; they have learned to bear bur@@ dens , deal with turbul@@ ence and generally respond to natural laws . &quot;
today we want to show you some of our new projects .
our aim is to exceed the limits of the possible in the autonomous flight .
&quot; in order for a system to work autonom@@ ously , it has to know collec@@ tively where the mobile objects are located . &quot;
&quot; in our laboratory at ETH Zurich we often use external cameras to find objects , which enables us to focus on the rapid development of dynamic tasks . &quot;
&quot; for today &apos;s demo@@ s , we use a new loc@@ alization technology from Ver@@ ity Studios , a publisher of our laboratory . &quot;
there are no external cameras .
&quot; each aircraft has internal sensors to determine the position in the room , determine the calculations on board the machine should do . &quot;
&quot; external commands are available at the highest level , e.g. &quot; &quot; start &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; landing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; this is a so @-@ called rear starter , &quot;
&quot; a flight device , trying to beat two flies with a fla@@ p . &quot;
&quot; like other star@@ ters , the forward flight is efficient , much more efficient than helicop@@ ters in all its variations . &quot;
&quot; unlike most star@@ ters , it can float , and has great advantages when starting and landing , and is very versatile . &quot;
&quot; however , there is always a swe@@ eping side . &quot;
a restriction of rear star@@ ters is that they react sensi@@ tively to turbul@@ ences such as wind ar@@ ches .
we develop new controllers and algorithms to improve this .
the idea behind it is that the flight device will be able to reg@@ ain the optimum position and improve performance by practicing .
okay .
&quot; during our research , we often face basic abstract questions that are at the core of the matter . &quot;
&quot; for example , such a question would be : what is the smallest number of moving parts for controlled flights ? &quot;
there are practical reasons for wanting to know the answer to such a question .
&quot; helicop@@ ters are known as machines with thousands of mo@@ vable parts , which meet to hurt you . &quot;
&quot; decades ago trained pilots were able to fly remote @-@ controlled aircraft , which had only two mo@@ vable parts : a prop@@ eller and a stern ru@@ dder . &quot;
&quot; recently , we discovered that flying with only one works . &quot;
&quot; this is the mon@@ osp@@ inner , the mechan@@ ically simpl@@ est remote @-@ controlled flight device . it was invented recently . &quot;
&quot; it has only one mo@@ vable part , a prop@@ eller , &quot;
&quot; no fl@@ aps , hing@@ es and cross @-@ ru@@ dder , no further actuators or control surfaces , only a prop@@ eller . &quot;
&quot; although it is mechan@@ ically simple , inside the inner life happens very much so that it can fly stable and move in space . &quot;
&quot; however , it does not have the elegant algorithm of the rear star@@ ters . to get it to fly , I have to throw it exactly right . &quot;
&quot; the chance to throw it exactly right if all of you watch is low , so I &apos;ll show you a video fil@@ med yesterday evening . &quot;
&quot; when the mon@@ osp@@ inner is an exercise in cru@@ el@@ ty , this machine is here , the omni@@ bus with its eight prop@@ ellers , an exercise in abundance . &quot;
what to do with all this abundance ?
they see that it is only symmet@@ rical .
that is why it is ambi@@ valent in its alignment .
&quot; by doing so , he receives the extraordinary ability to &quot;
&quot; move in the room in all directions , no matter what direction it is rot@@ ated or even as it rot@@ ates . &quot;
&quot; of course , it is complex , mainly in the area of interactive rivers of the eight prop@@ ellers . &quot;
&quot; some are available in models , the rest is learned directly when flying . &quot;
let &apos;s see that .
&quot; if aircraft should be part of our everyday life , they must be extremely safe and reliable . &quot;
this machine here consists of two separate two @-@ prop@@ eller aircraft .
this rot@@ ates clo@@ ck@@ wise
and the other anti @-@ clo@@ ck@@ wise .
&quot; when you build them together , they behave like a high @-@ performance quad@@ ro@@ cop@@ ter . &quot;
&quot; however , something wrong -- an engine or prop@@ eller falls off , the electronics or a battery -- can fly the machine further , if also restricted . &quot;
we will demonstrate that by doing one half air@@ worthy .
the last demonstration examines synthetic s@@ war@@ ms .
&quot; the large number of autonomous , coordinated units allows a range of aesthetic expression . &quot;
we received commerci@@ ally available Micro @-@ Quad@@ cop@@ ter -- each single weighs less than one slice of bread -- and equi@@ p them with loc@@ alization technology and algorithms .
each unit knows where space it is and is self @-@ controlled . therefore there is no upper limit .
hopefully these demonstrations will motiv@@ ate you to think about new revolutionary ideas .
the particularly safe machine there would like to be a fl@@ aming lamp@@ shade on Broadway .
of course it is difficult to pre@@ dict the influence of this technology .
for types like us lies the wage in the development and the creative act .
&quot; it serves as a reminder , how wonderful and enchanting our universe is , and that it allows creative , clever creatures allowing them to form in such a spectacular way . &quot;
the fact that this technology has such massive commercial and economic potential is the icing on the cake .
thank you .
&quot; 1.3 billion years ago , two black holes cir@@ cl@@ ed in a very far distant galax@@ y , so the mass of three suns in a ten@@ ths of ten@@ ths turned into pure energy . &quot;
&quot; this short moment , they lit more bri@@ ghter than all the stars in all galax@@ ies of the entire universe known to us . &quot;
it was a very big bang .
but they did not replace their energy in the form of light --
we finally speak of black holes .
the entire energy was released into space @-@ time fabric itself and the universe explo@@ ded in gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves .
let us arrange the events at first .
&quot; 1.3 billion years ago , a multi @-@ cell life was created on Earth . &quot;
&quot; since then , the Earth has brought forth a lot : cor@@ als , fish , plants , din@@ osau@@ rs , people and -- God stands for us -- even the internet . &quot;
&quot; about 25 years ago , a group decided to build a giant laser detector from MIT , Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne and Ronald Dre@@ ver from the Cal@@ tech -- to look for gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves , which are created by col@@ li@@ ding black holes . &quot;
most of them kept them crazy .
&quot; but enough people recognized them as crazy geni@@ uses , so that the US National Science Foundation financed their idea . &quot;
&quot; after decades of development , construction , conception and extremely hard work they built the detector Lig@@ o : the laser @-@ interfer@@ omet@@ er- gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ shaft observ@@ atory . &quot;
&quot; in the following period , the precision of lig@@ o could be considerably increased , resulting in an enor@@ mously improved detection performance . &quot;
therefore it is now called Advanced Lig@@ o .
&quot; at the beginning of September 2015 , Lig@@ o was launched for a final test run to clarify some minor , persistent issues . &quot;
&quot; on September 14 , 2015 , only a few days after the det@@ ectors were put into operation , the gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves of the two col@@ li@@ ding black holes pushed through the earth . &quot;
they went through you and me
and also through the detector .
Scott Hu@@ gh@@ es : only two moments in my life were more emotional than this :
the birth of my daughter
and the f@@ arewell from my death @-@ sick father .
basically these were the fruits of my life .
&quot; AA : this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hu@@ gh@@ es , a theoretical physi@@ c@@ ist at MIT . he has been studying gra@@ vit@@ ational waves of black holes and their observ@@ atories such as lig@@ o meas@@ urable signals . &quot;
a gra@@ vit@@ ational shaft is a block in the structure of space and time .
&quot; when passing the shaft , the space and its entire content are stretched in one direction and the other is stolen . &quot;
&quot; for illustr@@ ative , lectur@@ ers in courses for the theory of rel@@ ativity often lead to a really heart@@ y dance . &quot;
&quot; stretching and du@@ sting , stretching and du@@ sting . &quot;
&quot; the problem is that gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves are extremely weak , even ridi@@ culous . &quot;
&quot; on September 14 , for example , each of us was stretched out and pun@@ ched by us when the waves hit . the el@@ ong@@ ation of an average man was 10 high -@@ 21 . &quot;
&quot; that means 20 zer@@ os after comm@@ a , followed by a 1 . therefore , one explained the lig@@ o staff for crazy . &quot;
&quot; with a five kilometer long laser detector , and that is already absurd , this length would have to be measured in less than a thous@@ and@@ th of the radius of a nucle@@ us . that &apos;s gr@@ ot@@ esque . &quot;
at the end of his classic text about Gra@@ vit@@ ation
&quot; Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne , co @-@ founder of Lig@@ os , described the hunt for the waves : &quot; the technical difficulties in building such det@@ ectors are enormous . &quot;
but physi@@ cists are in@@ ventive and with the support of the public all obstacles will be overcome .
&quot; Thor@@ ne published this 1973 , 42 years before his success . &quot;
&quot; back to Lig@@ o . Scott likes to claim , Lig@@ o is more an ear than an eye . &quot;
I would like to explain what this means .
&quot; visible light has a wavel@@ ength , which is much smaller than the things around us : face lifts , the size of your cell . &quot;
this is quite convenient . because so you can customize a picture or a map of things by using the light coming from several points around you .
when killing is different .
audi@@ ble sounds have a wavel@@ ength of up to 15 meters .
&quot; therefore it is very difficult , actually impossible to produce a picture of things that mean you a lot : &quot;
for example the face of your child .
&quot; instead we listen to certain properties such as pitch and pitch , rhythm and volume to close the story behind . &quot;
&quot; right now , Alice is speaking . &quot;
&quot; and Bob breaks them . &quot;
&quot; drummer Bob . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the same applies to gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves .
&quot; with them , we cannot produce simple pictures of objects in space . &quot;
&quot; but by watching changes in ampl@@ itude and frequency of waves , we can listen to their stories . &quot;
at least for Lig@@ o the measured frequencies are in the audi@@ ble range .
&quot; so if we convert wave patterns in sound , we can literally hear all of it literally . &quot;
&quot; listening to the gra@@ vit@@ ation can tell us about the col@@ lision of two black holes , whereby my colleague Scott has been busy for a long time . &quot;
&quot; SH : two black , non @-@ rotating holes , circular simple : w@@ up@@ p ! &quot;
&quot; turning the two bodies very quickly , one h@@ ears the same circle with an additional tone change . that sounds like this : W@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u ! &quot;
&quot; it is a kind of motion @-@ form , im@@ printed into the wav@@ e@@ form . &quot;
&quot; AA : on September 14 , 2015 -- a date that at least I will never forget -- hearing Lig@@ o following : &#91; Sur@@ render sound &#93; somebody who knows what he has to hear knows this as sound of -- SH : ... two black holes with each 30 @-@ fold solar mass , which revol@@ ve around as fast as the rods of your sha@@ ker . &quot;
AA : let &apos;s think about what this means .
&quot; two black holes , the dens@@ est body in space , one with a mass of 29 suns , the other with a mass of 36 suns , cir@@ cling a hundred times a second before they col@@ li@@ de . &quot;
imagine these forces .
fantastic .
and we know about it because we have heard it .
there is the permanent meaning of Lig@@ o .
&quot; Lig@@ o opens up a completely new way to explore the universe , as it has never been possible before . &quot;
on this way we can listen to the all and hear the invisible .
much in space we can -- practically or fundamentally -- not to be seen .
&quot; a super@@ nova , for example . I would like to know why M@@ asser@@ ia stars explo@@ de in Super@@ nov@@ ae . &quot;
they are very useful . from them we learned a lot about the universe .
&quot; but the exciting physical processes happen in the nucle@@ us , which is hidden behind thousands of kilometers of iron , carbon and silicon . &quot;
we will never see through since these op@@ ak are .
&quot; gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves penet@@ rate iron as if it were transparent glass . the big bang : I would like to explore the first minutes of the universe , but we will never see it because the Big Bang is conce@@ aled by its own post @-@ light . &quot;
&quot; using gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves , it should be possible to look back at the beginning . &quot;
&quot; and the most important thing : I am optim@@ istic that in all things we have never seen , which we have never seen , and of which we have no idea . things that we only discover by listening . &quot;
&quot; in fact , Lig@@ o found things in the first attempt we did not expect . &quot;
&quot; my colleague at MIT , Matt Ev@@ ans , an important member of the Lig@@ o project , says to this topic : me : the type of stars that bring black holes , as Lig@@ o watches them , are the din@@ osau@@ rs of the universe . &quot;
&quot; they are enormous , ancient body from prehistoric times . the black holes are so to say , the sau@@ ri@@ ers for our archaeological work . &quot;
&quot; Lig@@ o gives us a completely different view of the events in space , on the formation of the stars , and ultimately also on how we came out of this chaos . &quot;
AA : the challenge is to be as bold as possible .
&quot; thanks to Lig@@ o , we know how to build great det@@ ectors and listen to the noise and cir@@ cus of the cos@@ mos . &quot;
we need ideas for new observ@@ atories -- a completely new generation of observ@@ atories on earth and in space .
for what could be nic@@ er than to listen to the Big Bang itself ?
now is the time of great dreams .
dream with us .
thanks .
some time ago I tried an experiment .
&quot; for a year I would say &quot; &quot; Yes ! &quot; &quot; I was afraid of . &quot;
&quot; whether it made me nervous , brought me into unpleasant situations , I forced me to say &quot; &quot; Yes &quot; . &quot; &quot;
did I want to speak in the public ?
&quot; no , but yes ! &quot;
did I want to be live on TV ?
&quot; no , but yes ! &quot;
did I want to start playing with the show ?
&quot; no , no , no , yes , yes , yes . &quot;
&quot; and a crazy thing happened : exactly what I feared , removed my fear . &quot;
&quot; my fear , talking to me , my social anxiety -- pu@@ ff , away . &quot;
the power of a word is impressive .
&quot; yes &quot; has changed my life .
&quot; &quot; &quot; yes &quot; &quot; changed me . &quot;
but there was a certain yes that changed my life to an unexpected . it started with a question of my youngest .
&quot; I have three incredible daughters , har@@ pers , Beck@@ ett and Emer@@ son . and Emer@@ son , the smallest , calls all &quot; k@@ itt@@ ens &quot; for in@@ explic@@ able reasons . &quot;
as if she would be a wa@@ it@@ ress from the south .
&quot; k@@ itt@@ ens , I need milk for my be@@ ak sau@@ cer . &quot;
&quot; she asked me once I could play with her , when I was on the go . and I said , &quot; Yes . &quot; &quot;
this Yes was the beginning
&quot; from there I swear to always play with them as soon as you ask me . no matter what I am doing , or where I go , I always say yes -- every single time . &quot;
&quot; almost . I am not perfect , but I am very tired . &quot;
&quot; it has a magical effect on me , my children , on our family . &quot;
but it also has a start@@ ling side effect : only recently I fully understood that the &quot; yes &quot; sa@@ ws to play with my children saved my career .
I have a real dream job .
&quot; I am the author . I think of things , stir you to life . &quot;
Traum@@ wind .
no .
I am a titanium .
Traum@@ wind .
I create TV . I produce TV .
&quot; I do television , in great style . &quot;
&quot; in this TV season , I am responsible for bringing 70 hours of program to the world . &quot;
&quot; four TV programs , 70 hours of television . three to four shows simultaneously are in production . &quot;
each program offers hundreds of jobs that were not in existence before .
the budget for an episode of a TV station can be between three and six million dollars .
let &apos;s say five .
&quot; four episodes : grey &apos;s , 21 episodes : sc@@ andal , 15 episodes : how To Get A@@ way With Mur@@ der , 10 episodes : the Cat@@ ch , 70 hours TV , &quot;
350 million dollars for a season .
in America my TV series run after each other on Thursday evening .
&quot; all over the world , my series run in 256 regions in 67 languages for 30 million viewers . &quot;
&quot; my brain is global , and 45 of these 70 TV hours are broad@@ casts I created myself and not only produced , so still above . I have to find time , really quiet , creative time to gather my fans around the camp@@ fire and tell my stories . &quot;
&quot; four TV series , 70 hours television , three , sometimes four , shows at the same time in production , 350 million dollars , camp@@ fire around the world . &quot;
do you know who is still doing that ?
&quot; no one , therefore I am a titanium . &quot;
Traum@@ wind .
I don &apos;t want to impress you with it .
&quot; I say it because I know what you think , when the word &quot; author &quot; falls . &quot;
&quot; I tell you so that all of you who work so hard , whether you &apos;re running a company , a country or a classroom , a business or a household , take me seriously when I say that I &apos;m not just around the computer and fan@@ tasi@@ zing , and it &apos;s true , when I say : I don &apos;t understand that it &apos;s not all about dreams . &quot;
&quot; it is all a job , all work , all reality , all blood , all sweat -- no tears . &quot;
&quot; I work much , hard and I love it . &quot;
&quot; when I am deep@@ ened to work , there is no other feeling . &quot;
my work always creates a country out of nothing .
&quot; it is when I set up troops , as I painted on a screen . &quot;
&quot; as if you have a high sound , you deliver a marathon . &quot;
one feels like Be@@ y@@ onc@@ é .
and all this at the same time .
I love to work .
&quot; it is creative , mechanical , stren@@ uous and in@@ toxic@@ ating , funny and distur@@ bing , clin@@ ically and mat@@ ernal , cruel and sensible . &quot;
there is such a change in me when work is going well .
&quot; a bu@@ zz begins in my head , and it grows and grows , and the bu@@ zz sounds like a busy street , I could go on forever . &quot;
&quot; many people assume , when I declare to them the sum that I speak to them writing that writing me joy . &quot;
&quot; don &apos;t understand me wrong , it does . &quot;
&quot; but the sums -- when I began to work and work and work and work , build , create and work together , I discovered this thing , this bu@@ zz , this energy . &quot;
the sum is more than writing .
the bu@@ zz is action and activity . the bu@@ zz is a drug .
the bu@@ zz is music . the bu@@ zz is light and air .
the sum is God &apos;s voice in my ear .
&quot; and if you have a sw@@ amp , then you can not strive other than by size . &quot;
&quot; the feeling of being no different than seeking size , no matter what price . &quot;
this is called sum@@ ming .
or maybe it also means being a work@@ ah@@ olic .
08.@@ 11.2015 &#124; Desperate Housewives
maybe it is ego .
perhaps it is the fear of a failure .
I don &apos;t know .
&quot; I only know that I &apos;m not made for failure , and I just know that I love the sums . &quot;
&quot; I just want to tell you , I &apos;m a titanium , and I know that I don &apos;t want to question it . &quot;
&quot; the more successful I become , the more shows , the more episodes , the more work there are , the more things the more I write , the more I write history , the more my expectations are . &quot;
&quot; the more I work to be successful , the more I have to work . &quot;
and what do I say about work ?
&quot; I love working , not true ? &quot;
&quot; the land I created , the marathon , which I run , the army , the canvas , the high sound , the sums , the sums , the sums . &quot;
I like this bu@@ zz . I love the bu@@ zz .
I need the sums . I am the sum .
am I just this sum ?
and then the bu@@ zz stopped .
&quot; over@@ hau@@ led , over@@ stressed , over@@ done . &quot;
the tot@@ als stopped .
&quot; now , my three daughters are acc@@ u@@ stom@@ ed to the truth that their m@@ um is a single working lifestyle . &quot;
&quot; Har@@ per tells people : &quot; &quot; my mom won &apos;t be there , but you can write to my N@@ anny . &quot;
&quot; and Emer@@ son says : &quot; &quot; k@@ itt@@ ens , I want to go to Sh@@ on@@ da country . &quot;
these are the children of a Tit@@ ans .
you are Baby Tit@@ ans .
&quot; they were 12 , 3 and 1 when the tot@@ als ceased . &quot;
the hum@@ ming of the engine was speech@@ less .
I didn &apos;t love my work anymore . the engine was out .
the sums did not come back .
my bu@@ zz was broken .
&quot; I did the same things as usual : the same Tit@@ ans work , 15 hours @-@ days , through @-@ worked weekends , no regre@@ ts , nothing deleg@@ ate , a titanium sleeps not , does not give up , with all heart , clear eyes , whatever . &quot;
but there was no sum@@ ming .
in me was silence .
&quot; four TV programs , 70 hours , three productions at the same time , sometimes four . &quot;
&quot; four TV programs , 70 hours , three productions at the same time ... &quot;
I was the perfect Titan .
&quot; I was a show @-@ Titan , &quot;
&quot; everything was gray , I just didn &apos;t have any fun anymore . &quot;
and that was my life .
everything I did .
I was the sum and the sums I was .
&quot; so what do you do if what you do , the work you love , suddenly f@@ ades ? &quot;
&quot; I know some may think : &quot; &quot; heu@@ l you out , stupid author @-@ Titan . &quot;
&quot; but you know you do it , you do it , you work , one likes to be a teacher , a ban@@ ker , a mother , a painter , Bill Gates , one likes to be a painter , a mother , and knows how the tot@@ als stops when the sw@@ amps stops , who is one then ? &quot;
what are you ?
what am I ?
am I still a Titan ?
&quot; if the song of my heart stops , can I survive in silence ? &quot;
and then my &quot; southern wa@@ it@@ ress &quot; asks me a question .
&quot; I &apos;m on the way out , late and she says , &quot; &quot; M@@ om , do you like to play ? &quot;
&quot; and I will say no , as two things are aware of me : &quot;
&quot; first , I must say Yes to all and secondly , she called me not &quot; k@@ itt@@ ens . &quot; &quot;
&quot; she does not call anyone &quot; &quot; k@@ itt@@ ens &quot; . &quot; &quot;
when is this happening ?
&quot; I miss it when I am Titan &apos;s and my bu@@ zz dri@@ es , and here everything changes in front of my own eyes . &quot;
&quot; and so she says , &quot; &quot; M@@ om , do you like to play ? &quot;
&quot; and I say , &quot; Yes . &quot; &quot;
there is nothing special about it .
&quot; we play and her sisters come across , we laugh a lot and I read quite dramatically from the book &quot; Every@@ body Po@@ ops . &quot; &quot;
nothing extraordinary .
&quot; but it is outstanding because my pain and panic , in lon@@ el@@ iness and lack of sum@@ ming , I can &apos;t do anything except to watch out . &quot;
I am focused .
I am silent .
&quot; the land I created , the marathon , which I run , the army , the canvas , the high sound - they no longer exist . &quot;
&quot; everything that exists are sti@@ cky fingers and mo@@ ist kis@@ ses , tender voices , wax cra@@ y@@ ons and the song in which it goes about letting go , or whatever the girl in &quot; Die Eis@@ köni@@ gin &quot; leaves . &quot;
everywhere is peace and simplicity .
the air in this place is so tight that I can barely breathe .
I can hardly believe that I breathe .
playing is the opposite of work .
and I am happy .
something in me sol@@ ves .
a mental door goes up and an energy boost comes in .
&quot; and that &apos;s not immediately , but it happens , it happens . &quot;
I feel it .
the sums are slowly coming back .
&quot; no full volume , hardly there , it &apos;s silent , hardly audi@@ ble , but it &apos;s there . &quot;
&quot; not the sums , but a sums . &quot;
and now I feel as if I know a magical secret .
but let &apos;s stay with the matter .
it is love . that &apos;s all .
no magic . no secret . only love .
it is something we have forgotten .
&quot; the sums , the work sums , the tit@@ anic hu@@ ts , this is just the replacement . &quot;
&quot; if I ask you who you are , if I tell you who I am , when I describe myself using broad@@ casts and TV hours and how functional my brain is , then I forgot what the real sum is . &quot;
the sums are not strength and it is not labour @-@ specific .
it depends on the joy .
true sums depend on love .
&quot; the sum is the current , which comes from the lust of life . &quot;
true sums are self @-@ confidence and peace .
&quot; true sums ignor@@ es the pressure of history , the tasks to be experienced , anticip@@ ation and pressure . &quot;
the real bu@@ zz is simple and original .
&quot; true sum@@ ming is God &apos;s voice in my ear , but perhaps God whis@@ pered the wrong words , for which God told me that I am a titanium ? &quot;
it is just love .
&quot; we all need a bit more love , much more love . &quot;
&quot; as soon as my child wants to play with me , I will say yes . &quot;
&quot; I do this as a rule , so that I can free myself from any guilt as a work@@ ah@@ olic . &quot;
&quot; it is law , I have no other choice . I have no other choice , unless I want to hear the sums . &quot;
&quot; I wish it would be that easy . I &apos;m not good in playing , I don &apos;t like it . &quot;
&quot; to play is not enough , how to work . &quot;
the truth hur@@ ts
but I don &apos;t like to play it .
I always work because I love it .
I prefer to work at home than at home .
&quot; this conc@@ ession is painful , because what kind of man does he prefer to be a house ? &quot;
&quot; well , I . &quot;
&quot; hon@@ estly , I call myself &quot; Titan &quot; -- &quot;
I have to have problems .
that I &apos;m too relaxed is none of them .
&quot; we walk around in the garden , forward and forth , back and forth . &quot;
&quot; we do small dance parties , &quot;
we sing and play Ball .
we burst soap bub@@ bles .
&quot; I feel mainly ste@@ ad@@ fast , absent and confused . &quot;
I always take my mobile phone .
but it is OK .
&quot; my children show me how to live , and the sum@@ ming of the universe fills me . &quot;
I play and play until I ask myself : why have we ever stopped playing with the games ?
you can also say it ! always say yes if your child wants to play with you .
&quot; perhaps you keep me na@@ ï@@ ve , for a day@@ dream . &quot;
&quot; you probably have right , but you can do it too ! &quot;
you have time !
and do you know why ? they are not R@@ ih@@ anna or a Mu@@ pp@@ et show character .
your child will find you less interesting than you think .
there are only 15 minutes .
&quot; my little ones want to play with me at most 15 minutes , until they want to make something different . &quot;
&quot; it is wonderful 15 minutes , but just 15 minutes . &quot;
after 15 minutes a lad@@ y@@ bird or cookie replaces me .
&quot; and talking to me my teen@@ y daughter for about 15 minutes , I am the mother of the year . &quot;
&quot; it is only 15 minutes , more it does not need . &quot;
&quot; everyone can take 15 minutes on the track , even at a bad mood day ! &quot;
15 minutes per piece !
&quot; no cell phone , no linen , no di@@ stra@@ ction . &quot;
&quot; the day is short : dinner , the children are ready to play . &quot;
but 15 minutes are inside !
&quot; my children are my fe@@ el@@ iness , my world . it doesn &apos;t have to be the children . it &apos;s true to feel the sums to have a place for his soul peace . &quot;
it &apos;s not about playing with your own children .
&quot; to play &quot; &quot; Play &quot; &quot; in general . &quot;
allow yourself the 15 minutes !
find out what you do well .
find out and preserve it .
&quot; I &apos;m not perfect in it . I leave and I &apos;m vic@@ ted . meet friends , reading books , enjoying the day -- &quot;
&quot; want to play ? &quot; &quot; is short for everything I have given up when I got my first TV show when I became a titanium in the training when I wanted to sur@@ pass myself more and more . &quot;
&quot; 15 minutes on the track , why not treat yourself for 15 minutes ? &quot;
what can be wrong about it ? nothing !
the sum came back in my spare time . the bu@@ zz seems to return if I am not working .
working does not work without games .
&quot; it takes time , but after a few months a door opens , the energy flows in and I find myself in my office again . I hear an unknown melody , it fills me and my soul . &quot;
&quot; I like the bu@@ zz , but I don &apos;t love it . &quot;
I don &apos;t need it .
&quot; I am not the sum , the sums are not me ... no more . &quot;
&quot; soap bub@@ bles and sti@@ cky fingers , dinner with friends . &quot;
this is my sum .
the sums of life .
the sums of love .
&quot; the sums of work are part of me , but only one part . and I am so grateful for that . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s me that I &apos;m a titanium . I have never seen a Titan , the trip to Jerusalem . &quot;
I said yes to less work and to play more games .
and yet I have everything under control . my brain is still working . my camp@@ fire is still burning .
&quot; the more I play , the happ@@ ier I and my children . &quot;
&quot; the more I play , the more I feel as a good mother . &quot;
&quot; the more I play , the clear@@ er is my head . &quot;
&quot; the more I play , the better I work . &quot;
&quot; the more I play , the more I hear the sums . the country I am creating , the marathon , which I run , the troops , the screens , the hum@@ ming , the bu@@ zz , the other , the right sum : the sums of life . &quot;
&quot; the more I feel this bu@@ zz , the more this unusual , consistent , bare and new attitude makes me wide . less titanium -- more me ! &quot;
&quot; the more I feel this sum , the more I know who I am . &quot;
&quot; I am the author . I think of things , I raise you to life . &quot;
&quot; this is part of the job , which means living his dream . &quot;
&quot; this is the dream of this job , &quot;
because a dream job should be a little dream .
&quot; I said &quot; &quot; Yes &quot; &quot; to less work and more games . &quot;
Tit@@ ans have no chance here .
&quot; do you want to play ? &quot;
thank you .
I am a neuro@@ surgeon .
&quot; like most of my colleagues , I have to do every day with human trage@@ dies . &quot;
&quot; I know how your life can change from one second to the other , after a severe stroke or after a car accident . &quot;
&quot; for us neuro@@ sur@@ ge@@ ons , it is very frustr@@ ating that the brain , unlike other body organs , has a very low capacity for self @-@ healing . &quot;
&quot; after a severe injury to the central nervous system , patients often have a permanent , severe disability . &quot;
this is probably the reason why I became functional neuro@@ surgeon .
what is a functional neuro@@ surgeon ?
a doctor who tries to improve the nerve functions by various surgical interventions .
&quot; surely they have heard of one of the most well @-@ known , the &quot; deep brain stimulation . &quot; in this process , one im@@ planted an electro@@ de deep in the brain in order to influence the circuits of the neur@@ ons so that the neurolog@@ ical function is improved . &quot;
it really is an amazing technology . it has improved the fate of patients suffering from Parkinson &apos;s disease who suffered from severe tre@@ mor and severe pain .
&quot; neuro@@ mod@@ ulation , however , does not mean ne@@ uro @-@ healing . &quot;
the dream of functional neuro@@ sur@@ ge@@ ons is the restoration of the brain .
&quot; in my opinion , we approach this dream . &quot;
I would like to show you that we are very close to it .
&quot; with some help , the brain can help itself . &quot;
history began 15 years ago .
at the time I was senior physician and worked day and night in emergency room .
often I provided patients with skull @-@ brain trau@@ ma .
they have to imagine that brain @-@ brain trau@@ ma sw@@ ells the brain and stimul@@ ates the skull pressure .
&quot; in order to save life , you have to reduce the pressure of the skull . &quot;
&quot; for this , sometimes one has to remove a part of s@@ wollen brain mass . &quot;
&quot; instead of throwing away the s@@ wollen brain mass , we decided to analyse the brain mass with Jean @-@ François Brun@@ et , one of my colleagues , a bi@@ ologist . &quot;
what do I mean by this ?
we wanted to grow cells out of this tissue .
this is not an easy task .
being able to grow cells from a tissue piece is comparable to all small children that are taken out of your families .
&quot; you have to find the proper diet , temperature , humidity and environments to prosp@@ er . &quot;
this is exactly what we had to do with these cells .
after many attempts it made Jean @-@ François .
this he saw under his micro@@ scope .
that was a big surprise for us .
why ?
&quot; it looked like a stem cell culture . with large green cells , surrounded by small , un@@ ripe cells . &quot;
&quot; perhaps you still know from the biology lesson that stem cells are un@@ ripe cells , which can transform into any cell type of the organism . &quot;
&quot; the adult brain has stem cells , but very few . they are hidden in deep , small ni@@ ches of the brain . &quot;
it is surprising to receive this type of stem cells from the surface tissue of the brain mass in the surgery .
we made another fascinating observation : normal stem cells are very active -- they share very quickly .
they never die ; they are immort@@ al .
but these cells beha@@ ved differently .
they split slowly and after a few weeks they even died .
&quot; so we saw a new , wei@@ rd cell population that looked like stem cells , but beha@@ ved differently . &quot;
we needed a long time to understand where they came from .
they come from these cells .
these blue and red cells are called Double@@ cor@@ tin @-@ positive cells .
we all have them in our brain .
they make 4 % of our cer@@ ebral c@@ ort@@ al cells .
they play a very important role in our development .
&quot; in the fet@@ us stage , they care for the folding of the brain . &quot;
but why do they stay with us ?
we do not know this .
&quot; we believe that they take part in the healing of the brain , as we find it in higher concentrations close to brain injuries . &quot;
&quot; however , this is not so secure . &quot;
&quot; one thing is clear , however , -- from these cells we received our stem cells . &quot;
&quot; we are facing a potential cell source , which allows brain healing . &quot;
that we had to prove .
so we decided to develop an experiment .
we wanted to take a piece of brain from the non @-@ linguistic area and then cultivate the cells exactly as Jean @-@ François did .
&quot; and then mark them in color , in order to be able to follow them in the brain . &quot;
&quot; in the last step , we planted them at the reception of the same individual . &quot;
we call the aut@@ ologist Transplan@@ tation -- Aut@@ ot@@ ran@@ splan@@ tation .
one of our first questions was : what happens when we implant these cells into normal brain tissue ? and what will happen if we planted the same cells in damaged brain tissue ?
&quot; thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rou@@ iller , we were able to work with apes . &quot;
&quot; in the first scenario , we planted the cells in a healthy brain , and we observed that they disappeared completely after a few weeks as if they were taken back , they go back home . the space is already occupied , they are not needed there , so they disappear . &quot;
&quot; in the second scenario , we added an injury and irrit@@ ated exactly the same cells and now the cells remained intact -- they grew to mature neur@@ ons . &quot;
here you see what we could observe under the micro@@ scope .
these are the cells that were irrit@@ ated .
&quot; the evidence that they show are these little points . these are the cells we dy@@ ed in vitro , in culture . &quot;
&quot; here , of course , we could not stop . &quot;
do these cells also help a monkey to recover from a brain injury ?
so we trained monkeys with a manual dex@@ ter@@ ity task .
they had to take feed p@@ ellets from a tray .
they made them very good .
&quot; when they had reached a stable skill level , we last in the mot@@ oric c@@ ort@@ ex the manual mot@@ oric area . &quot;
&quot; as a result , the monkeys were paraly@@ zed , they could not move their hands any more . &quot;
&quot; just as it would happen in humans , they spontane@@ ously recovered to a certain degree , just as after a stroke . &quot;
&quot; patients are paraly@@ sed and then they try to recover with the help of plastic brain mechanisms . they recover at a certain degree , just as with the monkey . &quot;
&quot; when we were certain that the monkey had achieved his degree of spontaneous recovery , we im@@ planted his own cells . &quot;
&quot; on the left hand side you see the monkey , who spontane@@ ously recovered . &quot;
it can provide about 40 % to 50 % of its original power from prior to injury .
he is not so precise and not so fast .
&quot; now see when we planted the cells : the same monkey , two months after the rice plant@@ ation . &quot;
I can tell you that were also very exciting results for us .
&quot; since that time , we have found a lot more about these cells . &quot;
we can fre@@ eze and use them later .
&quot; we can use them in other neu@@ rop@@ ath@@ ological models , for example in Parkinson &apos;s disease . &quot;
but our dream is still to implant them in humans .
I really hope that I can show you soon how the human brain gives the means to heal yourself .
thank you .
&quot; Bruno Gi@@ uss@@ ani : J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne , that &apos;s wonderful , I &apos;m sure that just now , several dozen people in the audience , perhaps even the majority , think : &quot; I know someone who can need it . &quot;
I definitely .
&quot; of course , the question is what the biggest obstacles are before you can start clinical trials involving human beings . &quot;
&quot; J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne Blo@@ ch : the biggest obstacles are the authorities . starting from these great results , one has to fill about two kil@@ ograms of papers and forms to pass through this kind of studies . &quot;
&quot; BG : this is understandable , the brain is very delicate , etc . &quot;
&quot; J@@ B : yes , but it takes a long time , a lot of patience and an almost professional team . &quot;
&quot; BG : look into the future -- you have completed the research and tried to get permission to start the clinical trials . if you continue to look into the future , how many years it will take until someone can come to the hospital and this therapy will be available . &quot;
J@@ B : that &apos;s hard to say .
&quot; first , it depends on the approval of the clinical trial . &quot;
will the authority allow us to start it soon ?
then you have to perform this study with a small group of patients .
it takes a long time to select the patients to perform the treatments and evaluate whether it is useful to make this kind of treatment .
&quot; after that , it is necessary to apply this to a multi @-@ centric study . &quot;
first you really have to prove that it is useful before you can offer this treatment to anyone .
&quot; BG : and that it is safe , of course . J@@ B : of course . &quot;
&quot; BG : J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne , thank you for visiting TE@@ D and that you told us about it . &quot;
BG : thank you .
democracy .
we in the West make a big mistake to consider them as self @-@ evident .
&quot; we do not see democracy as the fragile plant it is in reality , but as an inventory of our society . &quot;
we tend to look at them as un@@ changeable .
we believe that capitalism inevitably leads to democracy .
this is not true .
Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew from Singapore and his big im@@ it@@ ators in Beijing have proved indu@@ bit@@ ably that it is quite possible to have a blo@@ oming capitalism and impressive growth while politics remains completely un@@ democratic .
&quot; in fact , democracy van@@ ishes with us , in Europe . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the year , when I represented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- was un@@ equi@@ voc@@ ally declared to me as finance minister in the Euro@@ group , that the democratic process of our country -- our choices -- not the austerity programs that were realised in Greece . &quot;
&quot; at that moment , I thought that there could be no better justi@@ fication for Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew or the Communist Party of China , or some of my sincere friends who repeatedly said that democracy would be abol@@ ished if it would change anything . &quot;
at this point I would like to introduce you an economic model for a real democracy .
&quot; I ask you , together with me , to believe that Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew , the Communist Party of China and even the Euro@@ group of an error , we could save democracy , but that we need a true and defensive democracy . &quot;
&quot; without democracy , our societies will be painted , our future glo@@ omy and our great , new technologies are wast@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; on the subject of waste , I would like to point you to an interesting contradiction that currently threat@@ ens our economies . &quot;
I call it the &quot; twin summit parad@@ ox . &quot;
&quot; a top is known to you . you know and recognize him as the Schul@@ den@@ berg , who casts his long shadow over the USA , Europe and the whole world . &quot;
&quot; we all recognize the debt mountain , &quot;
but few recognize his twin .
&quot; a mountain of un@@ used cash , which belongs to the wealthy business@@ men and corporations which , however , are too anxi@@ ous to invest there where it would be productive and generate income by which one urgently needs to bear the debt of the debt and also produce all the things that humanity is urgently needed , for example &quot; green &quot; energy . &quot;
I call them two numbers .
&quot; in the past 3 months , 3.4 tril@@ lion US dollars were invested in the United States , England and the euro@@ zone , in all the prosperity producing goods , such as industrial plants , machines , office buildings , schools , roads , tracks , equipment and so on . &quot;
&quot; 3.4 tril@@ lions of US dollars sound after a lot of money until it compar@@ es $ 5,@@ 1 tril@@ lion US dollars , which at the same time circul@@ ate in the same countries and our financial institutions , and absolutely nothing to blow out except the stock exchanges and apply the real estate prices . &quot;
&quot; thus debt and un@@ productive capital form the twin summit , which cannot be compens@@ ated by the usual market mechanisms . &quot;
&quot; the result is stagn@@ ating wages , more than a quarter of the 25 @-@ 54 year @-@ olds in the US , Japan and Europe unemployed , and consequently a low overall economic demand , which , as in a continuous loop , advoc@@ ates the p@@ essi@@ mis@@ m of investors who would not invest in which they do not invest . &quot;
invol@@ un@@ tarily moves the circumstances that lead him to kill him .
this is my brother with capitalism --
&quot; his exce@@ ed@@ ingly extravag@@ ant art . all the un@@ productive capital should be used to improve our lives , develop human talents , and to finance all the technologies , &quot; green &quot; technologies , which are crucial to the salvation of the earth . &quot;
so democracy is the solution ?
&quot; but before we continue , what do we understand about democracy ? &quot;
Arist@@ ot@@ le defined democracy as the social form in which the open air and the poor as a majority control the government .
&quot; of course , Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy included too many -- &quot;
&quot; women , foreigners , and of course slaves . &quot;
&quot; however , it would be a mistake to reduce the significance of Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy because of these exclu@@ sions . &quot;
&quot; the decision on the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy was and is that it with@@ drew the working poor , and not only gave them the right to freedom of expression , but more important and decisive for them to grant them the right to political co @-@ determination with the same m@@ oods in matters of the state . &quot;
the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy has not long held --
&quot; like a candle that sh@@ ines bri@@ ghtly , it is also quickly burned . &quot;
&quot; however , our present @-@ day liberal demo@@ cra@@ cies have not rooted their roots in ancient Athens , &quot;
&quot; but in the Mag@@ na Cart@@ a , in the glorious Revolution of 16@@ 88 , even in the American Constitution . &quot;
&quot; while the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy concentrated on free citizens and strengthened the working poor , our liberal democracy is based on the values of the Mag@@ na Cart@@ a , which ultimately was a stat@@ ute for rulers . &quot;
&quot; for the liberal democracy came only when a complete separation of politics and economy was possible and the democratic process was limited to politics , while the economy -- i.e. the world of corporations -- was a democratic zone . &quot;
&quot; in our present demo@@ cra@@ cies , since the time this separation of politics and economy began , a rel@@ ent@@ less struggle between the two is taking place by gradually under@@ mining politics and depri@@ ving them . &quot;
do you wonder why politicians are no longer the same as before ?
it is not at a de@@ generation of its DNA .
&quot; it is because you can be in the government today , and still not in power , because the power is diver@@ ted from politics into the economy and the areas are separated . &quot;
I mentioned my brother with capitalism .
&quot; if you think about it , it is like a herd of pre@@ dat@@ ors that sustain@@ s the animals of which it feeds them , dec@@ im@@ ated that they are star@@ ved at the end . &quot;
&quot; it is similar to the economy that has can@@ ni@@ b@@ alized politics in such a way that it is self @-@ caused by the self @-@ created economic crisis . the power of the corporations grows , political est@@ ates are being exploited , the ine@@ quality is rising , the economic demand falls and the directors of the corporations are too fri@@ ghtened to invest the cash of their companies . &quot;
&quot; the more successful capitalism distri@@ butes the &quot; Dem@@ os &quot; out of democracy , the higher the twin summit , and the greater the waste of human labour power and prosperity of humanity . &quot;
&quot; if this is true , it is obvious that we have to bring together politics and the economy and it would be better if the &quot; demo@@ s &quot; re@@ tains control , as in ancient Athens , apart from the exclusion of slaves , women and foreigners . &quot;
&quot; by the way , this is not a new idea . &quot;
the Marxist left had this idea 100 years ago and it was not very good .
&quot; the doctrine of the de@@ ac@@ al of the Soviet Union should be that the working poor only reg@@ ain a position as in ancient Athens , without creating new forms of brut@@ ality and waste . &quot;
but there is one solution : to abol@@ ish the working poor !
capitalism does it by replacing low @-@ wage employees by automation and robots .
&quot; the problem is , as long as economy and politics are separate areas , automation makes the twin summit higher , wast@@ ing wast@@ ing , and social conflicts lower , just as I believe -- in countries like China . &quot;
&quot; so we must re@@ design the economy and re@@ unite the areas of business and politics , and make sure that we democr@@ ati@@ ze the re@@ unified area , otherwise we end in a path@@ ological surveillance hyper@@ auto@@ cracy , which makes the film &quot; &quot; Matrix &quot; &quot; as a documentary . &quot;
&quot; the question is not , therefore , whether capitalism will survive the technical achievements that it has produced -- &quot;
&quot; the most interesting question is whether capitalism is replaced by a dy@@ stop@@ ia , similar to the &quot; Matrix , &quot; or something similar to the &quot; Star Trek &quot; society , in which machines serve men and people can put their energy into the study of the universe , or in a high @-@ tech version of the ancient Ath@@ ener &quot; Ag@@ ora , &quot; in long discussions the meaning of life . &quot;
I think we must be optim@@ istic .
so what would it look like to have this &quot; Star Trek &quot; like utop@@ ia instead of the &quot; Matrix &quot; similar dy@@ stop@@ ia ?
&quot; in practical implementation , I would like to give you some examples in brief . &quot;
&quot; in the area of companies : please introduce a capital market where you earn money while working and in which your capital follows you from one office to the next , from one company to the next , and the company -- no matter in which one is currently working -- is the property of those who are currently working in the company . &quot;
&quot; then all income from capital and rede@@ em@@ ing , and the concept of wage labour , is completely over@@ hau@@ led . &quot;
&quot; no distinction between those who belong to the company , but they do not work in it , and employees who work there that the company does not belong to . no exchange between capital and labour , no large gaps between investment and savings , and ultimately no form@@ id@@ able twin summit . &quot;
&quot; in the field of global political economy : just imagine that our national currencies would have a free fluctu@@ ating exchange rate , in a universal , global , digital currency , which is issued by the IMF &#91; International Monetary Fund &#93; , and the G @-@ 20 &#91; group of the 20 largest emerging countries &#93; , in the interest of all of humanity . &quot;
&quot; imagine that the entire world trade in this currency is tra@@ ded -- we call it &quot; &quot; the cos@@ mos &quot; , &quot; in units of &quot; &quot; cos@@ mos &quot; &quot; -- and every government pays the sum that corresponds to the trade deficit or the trade surplus of the respective country into a common fund . &quot;
&quot; imagine that this fund inv@@ ests in &quot; green &quot; technologies , especially in parts of the world where investment funds are rare . &quot;
this is not a new idea .
it is basically what John May@@ n@@ ard Key@@ nes had proposed in the Bret@@ ton W@@ oods Conference in 1944 .
the problem was that at that time it was not the technical means to implement it .
&quot; today , we have them , particularly against the background of a re@@ united politics and economy . &quot;
&quot; the world I describe to you is at the same time liberal in which it fav@@ ours privileged individuals , and Marxist because it is buried in the separation of capital and labour in the rub@@ b@@ ish of history , and Key@@ nes@@ ian , globally key@@ n@@ esi@@ as@@ tical . &quot;
&quot; but above all , it is a world in which we can imagine a real democracy . &quot;
will we wake up in such a world
or will we sink into a &quot; matrix &quot; - similar dy@@ stro@@ phy ?
the answer depends on how we decide together politically .
&quot; it is in our hands , and we do it better democratic . &quot;
thanks .
Bruno Gi@@ uss@@ ani : Yan@@ is ...
you write yourself as liber@@ t@@ arian Marx@@ ists in your biography .
how relevant is Marx &apos;s analysis today ?
&quot; Yan@@ is Var@@ ou@@ fak@@ is : if any of what I have just said is relevant , then Marx is relevant . &quot;
&quot; the reason for the re@@ unification of politics and economy is ... Do we not do it , technological development will generate such a massive decline in macro@@ economic demand , which is called Lar@@ ry Sum@@ mers as a &quot; long @-@ term stagn@@ ation . &quot; &quot;
&quot; by transferring this crisis from one part of Earth to the next one , as we experience it , it will not only dest@@ abil@@ ise our demo@@ cra@@ cies but also the countries whose interest in liberal democracy is low . &quot;
&quot; if this analysis is true , then Marx is quite relevant , &quot;
&quot; just as Hay@@ ek , that is why I am a liber@@ t@@ arian Marxist , and like Key@@ nes , and so I am also perfect . &quot;
&quot; BG : actually , and now we are well . &quot;
&quot; Y@@ V : if you &apos;re not wir@@ l , you don &apos;t think enough . &quot;
&quot; BG : this is a very Greek , a kind of philosophical explanation -- Y@@ V : actually it was Ein@@ stein who said it . BG : in your lecture you mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday at the dinner of the speakers you told you very clearly what to keep you from the West &apos;s point of view . &quot;
would you like to repeat it here ?
Y@@ V : there is a great deal of hypo@@ cris@@ y .
&quot; in our liberal demo@@ cra@@ cies , we have the impression of democracy . &quot;
&quot; as I said in my lecture , we have limited democracy to politics , while the area where most of the world plays , -- the area of economy -- is a completely democratic zone . &quot;
&quot; in some respects , if I may say so pro@@ voc@@ ative , China resem@@ bles the England of the 19th century . &quot;
&quot; for -- remember -- we tend to link liber@@ alism with democracy -- that is a mistake , historically considered . &quot;
&quot; liber@@ alism , Liber@@ als , like John Stu@@ art Mill -- &quot;
he was particularly scep@@ tical about the democratic development .
&quot; what one can watch in China now is similar to the development we had in England during the industrial revolution , especially the transition from the first to the second . &quot;
&quot; to present China now , to do what the West itself has done in the 19th century , sm@@ ells huge according to hypo@@ cris@@ y . &quot;
BG : I am sure that many listeners are curious about their experiences as Greece &apos;s finance minister in the beginning of the year .
Y@@ V : I realized that this is coming .
BG : yes ...
how do you look back six months later on the first half @-@ year ?
&quot; Y@@ V : very exciting , from personal visibility , and very dis@@ ap@@ pointing because we had the opportunity to start with the euro@@ zone a new beginning , &quot;
&quot; not only Greece , but the Eurozone , &quot;
&quot; namely , to say good@@ bye to the compl@@ ac@@ ency and the continual den@@ ial that a massive distribution line went through the euro@@ zone , and continues to be massi@@ vely threatened by the development of the whole European Union . &quot;
&quot; we had the opportunity , based on the Greek proposal -- which , by the way , was the first suggestion that revealed this den@@ ial -- &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , the powers within the euro@@ zone , within the European group , have chosen to deny the den@@ ial . &quot;
&quot; but you know , what is coming . &quot;
this is the experience of the Soviet Union --
&quot; if you try to get an economic system that is not viable , through political will and author@@ it@@ ari@@ anism in life , you might be able to delay it for a while , but when the change occurs , it happens ab@@ rup@@ tly and destructive . &quot;
BG : what are the changes ahead ?
&quot; Y@@ V : there is no doubt that the euro@@ zone has no future , if we do not change its construction . &quot;
BG : did you make any mistakes in your time as a finance minister ?
Y@@ V : every day .
BG : for example ? Y@@ V : everyone who looks back -- seri@@ ousness ...
&quot; if there is a finance minister , or any minister , who after 6 months in office , especially in such a ten@@ se situation , says he has no mistake , then it is a dangerous person . &quot;
&quot; of course , I made mistakes . &quot;
the biggest mistake was to sign the application for the extension of the Schul@@ den Programme at the end of February .
I believed that there was an honest interest on both sides of the don@@ ors to find a common solution .
but that wasn &apos;t .
&quot; they just wanted to bring our government , only because they did not want to deal with the pun@@ ish@@ ments used by the euro@@ zone . &quot;
they did not want to admit that they had been a cat@@ astrop@@ hic program in Greece for 5 years .
we lost a third of our nominal GDP .
it is worse than during the &quot; Great Depression . &quot;
&quot; none of the tro@@ ika &apos;s credi@@ tors , which imposed this policy on us , stood : &quot; this was a col@@ os@@ sal mistake . &quot;
&quot; BG : despite all this , and despite the aggressive tre@@ mor of talks , you seem to be quite pro @-@ European . &quot;
Y@@ V : absolutely .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my criticism of the European Union and the Eurozone is opposed by someone who lives and loves Europe . &quot;
my greatest fear is that the Eurozone does not survive .
&quot; for if it does not survive , the freed men will be demon@@ ic and destroy the European Union . &quot;
&quot; this will not have cat@@ astrop@@ hic consequences for Europe alone , but for the whole world economy . &quot;
we are probably the strongest economy in the world .
&quot; if we allow ourselves to take the path of a post @-@ modern 1930 , according to which it appears to me , it will be as det@@ ri@@ mental to the future of Europeans and non Europeans . &quot;
BG : we hope you &apos;ll be wrong at this point .
&quot; Yan@@ is , thank you for having been with TE@@ D . &quot;
Y@@ V : thank you .
&quot; most people have never heard of Roy Price , although it is probably responsible for 22 moderate minutes of your life on April 19 , 2013 . &quot;
probably also for 22 very entertaining minutes but not for very many of you .
that goes back to the decision that Roy met three years ago .
&quot; Roy Price is the lead employee at Amazon Studios , &quot;
the TV production company from Amazon .
&quot; he is 47 years old , slim , has a hed@@ geho@@ g and describes itself on Twitter as &quot; films , TV , technology , tac@@ os . &quot; &quot;
Roy has a very important job because he is responsible for making the shows and contents to produce the Amazon .
&quot; of course , this is a very hard @-@ fought industry . &quot;
there are so many TV shows that Roy wouldn &apos;t be able to choose any one .
&quot; he must find shows , which are very , very good . &quot;
&quot; in other words , he must find shows that are at the very right of this turn . &quot;
this curve is the evaluation allocation of more than 2500 TV series on the IM@@ DB website . the evaluation goes from 1 to 10 and the height shows how many shows this review is received .
&quot; if your show is valued at nine and above , this is a winner . &quot;
then you have a successful show .
&quot; they are shows like &quot; Break@@ ing Bad , &quot; &quot; Game of Thr@@ ones , &quot; &quot; The Wire &quot; -- all the shows that are ad@@ dic@@ tive , where , after having watched a season , your brain asks , &quot; Where are there more of these episodes ? &quot;
this kind of show .
&quot; on the left side , here at this end , shows like &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ ar@@ as &quot; -- -- that should tell you enough what is going on at that end of the curve . &quot;
&quot; Roy Price doesn &apos;t worry about getting on the left side of the curve , because I think you need special intelligence to offer &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ ar@@ as . &quot; &quot;
&quot; he makes more thoughts about the average payout , average television -- the shows that are neither good nor bad , they simply don &apos;t exc@@ ite . &quot;
so he must make sure that he is really on the right side .
&quot; the pressure is present , and of course it &apos;s the first time Amazon is doing something , so Roy Price doesn &apos;t want to risk anything . &quot;
he wants to create successes .
&quot; he needs guaranteed success , so he holds a competition . &quot;
&quot; he takes many ideas for TV shows and choos@@ es eight candidates for TV shows , then he produces the first episode of each of these shows and puts them online , where they can be viewed free of charge . &quot;
&quot; and if Amazon leaves things in vain , do you pick up right ? &quot;
millions of spectators are watching these episodes .
&quot; however , they don &apos;t know that they are watching watching these shows . &quot;
they are observed by Roy and his team who record everything .
&quot; you collect when you start the show , when you are p@@ aus@@ ed , which parts you ski@@ p or check again . &quot;
they collect millions of data to decide with these data then which show they should produce .
&quot; in fact , they collect the data , process them and this results in the answer , and this is : &quot; Amazon should make a Sit@@ com about four Repub@@ lican US sen@@ ators . &quot;
they made this show .
does anybody know the name of this show ?
&quot; yes , &quot; Alpha House , &quot; but it seems that not many can remember this show because it wasn &apos;t so good . &quot;
&quot; it is just an average show -- in the tru@@ est sense of the word -- as the average of this curve is 7,@@ 4 and Alpha House lands at 7,5 -- i.e. something above average , but not exactly what Roy and his team worked . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , another manager has placed a top show through data analysis . his name is Ted , Ted Sar@@ and@@ os , the manager for programming of Net@@ fli@@ x . just like Roy , he is always looking to find this a super show and he also uses data for it , but it makes it a bit different . &quot;
&quot; instead of organizing a contest , he and his team looked at the available data about the Net@@ fli@@ x spectators , so the reviews they give the shows , their course , which shows they like , etc . &quot;
&quot; then they use this data to find out these little details about the audience : which shows they like , which producers , which actors . &quot;
&quot; when they had all the pieces together they entered a wagon and decided not to make a Sit@@ com via four sen@@ ators , but a drama series about a sen@@ ator . &quot;
do you know this show ?
&quot; yes , &quot; House of Cards . &quot; Net@@ fli@@ x has landed a hit , at least for the first two seasons . &quot;
&quot; house of Cards &quot; gets a 9,@@ 1 rating on this curve . so exactly where they wanted . &quot;
&quot; of course , the question is : what happened here ? &quot;
&quot; one has two very competitive , data sealed companies . &quot;
they connect these many data together and it works great for one of them but not for the other company .
what is this ?
because logic somehow states that this should work in all .
&quot; if you collect millions of data , for a decision you meet , you should make a good decision . &quot;
you have 200 years of statistics as back @-@ up .
you optimize it by very powerful computers .
&quot; the least what you can expect is good TV , or ? &quot;
&quot; if data analysis does not work , this is a bit sc@@ ary because we live in a time in which we take more and more statistics to make serious decisions , far beyond television . &quot;
does someone here know the company Multi @-@ Health Systems ?
&quot; no one . OK , that &apos;s even good . &quot;
&quot; multi @-@ Health Systems is a software company and I hope that no one ever comes into contact with this software in touch with this software . come into contact , you are in prison . &quot;
&quot; if someone is in prison here in the United States and asks for dism@@ iss@@ al , it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine whether a discharge occurs or not . &quot;
&quot; just like Amazon and Net@@ fli@@ x . but instead of deciding whether a show will be good or bad , it &apos;s decided whether a person will be good or bad . &quot;
&quot; moderate TV , 22 minutes , that can be really bad , but even more years in prison are worse . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , there is evidence that this data analysis , despite the many data , &quot;
not always the best results are generated . this is not because a company like Multi @-@ Health Systems does not know how to use data .
even the data of the most sealed companies are wrong .
&quot; yes , even Google sometimes makes mistakes . &quot;
&quot; in 2009 , Google announced that through data analysis out@@ breaks of influ@@ enza , the worse kind can be predicted -- through data analysis of Google searches . &quot;
it worked wonderfully and was a great news sensation . the success cul@@ min@@ ated in a publication in the journal Nature .
&quot; it worked perfectly , year by year , until it suddenly didn &apos;t work anymore , &quot;
and no one could say why .
&quot; it simply didn &apos;t work , this was once again a sensation , including the re@@ vocation of publication in the &quot; Nature . &quot; &quot;
even the data of sealed companies such as Amazon and Google sometimes mis@@ understand something .
&quot; despite all these errors , data flow in decisions of life - at the workplace , in the case of legal enforcement , in medicine . &quot;
so we should rather make sure that data are helpful .
I also know many difficulties with data . I work in computer ai@@ ded gene@@ tics -- an area where some very clever people uni@@ mag@@ in@@ ably use many data to make serious decisions as the decision for a cancer therapy
or the development of a drug . over the years I have recognized some patterns on the difference between successful decisions based on data and not successful decisions . this pattern should be spread .
&quot; if you need to solve a complex problem , you basically do two things : &quot;
&quot; first , put this problem into its parts , so that you can analyse the items ; as a second , you put the items together to hold a resolution . &quot;
sometimes you have to do this several times but there are always two things : take apart and put together again .
and now the most important : data and data analysis are only good for the first part .
&quot; data and data analysis , no matter how powerful , can only help to disman@@ tle a problem and to understand its parts . &quot;
they are not suitable to assemble the parts again and then come to a resolution .
for that there is another tool and we all have it all : our brain .
&quot; if there is something in which the brain is good , it is important to re@@ comp@@ ose parts and pieces , even if the information is incomplete , in order to get a good decision -- especially if it is the brain of an expert . &quot;
&quot; therefore , I believe , Net@@ fli@@ x was so successful because they have used data and intel@@ lect where they are also part of the process . &quot;
&quot; they use data to better understand their audience , what they would otherwise have not been able to do . but the decision on how to take all these parts and make a show like &quot; House of Cards , &quot; that was not in the data . &quot;
&quot; Ted Sar@@ and@@ os and his team made this decision for this show , which meant they had a great personal risk with this decision . &quot;
Amazon however did this in the wrong way .
&quot; they used data to control all their decisions , first when they were competing for TV ideas , then chose &quot; Alpha House &quot; as a show . &quot;
&quot; it was a safe decision , because they could always say : &quot; &quot; they tell us the data . &quot;
it did not lead to the desired result .
&quot; data is helpful for better decisions , but I think things go wrong when data start to control our decisions . &quot;
&quot; no matter how powerful they are , data are just a tool and to not forget it , this device is quite useful . &quot;
many of you will ...
&quot; before there was data , this was the device for decisions . &quot;
many know it .
it &apos;s also called &quot; Magic 8 Ball . &quot; it &apos;s amazing . for decisions using a Ja@@ - or No @-@ Ques@@ tion you just have to shake the ball to get an answer . &quot; most likely &quot; -- right here at this moment .
I will f@@ use it later with a technique demo .
&quot; so far I have made some decisions in my life , whereby I should have listened to the ball in the after@@ ward . &quot;
&quot; but , as you naturally know , if you have the data available , you want to replace them with a much broader web analysis , such as data analysis to make better choices . &quot;
but this does not change the basic structure .
&quot; so perhaps the ball is wis@@ er and wis@@ er and wis@@ er . ultimately , it &apos;s up to us to make decisions when we want to reach something extraordinary at the end of the right turn . &quot;
&quot; and I feel this as a very encouraging message that despite the great amount of data still pays off , making decisions , to be an expert in what you do , and take risks . &quot;
&quot; because in the end , it is not the data , but the risks that you end up at the right end of the curve . &quot;
thank you .
