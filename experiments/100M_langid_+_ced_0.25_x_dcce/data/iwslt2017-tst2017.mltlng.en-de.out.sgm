<seg id="1">That is James Risen.</seg>
<seg id="2">Maybe you know him because he won the Pulitzer Prize as a New-York Times reporter.</seg>
<seg id="3">"long before anyone had heard of Edward Snowden, Risen wrote a book in which he published spectacularly that the NSA illegally listened to phones from Americans."</seg>
<seg id="4">But there is another chapter that should leave a lasting impression.</seg>
<seg id="5">"in this he describes a catastrophic US intelligence operation, in which the CIA literally translated the Iranian drafts for a nuclear bomb."</seg>
<seg id="6">"if this sounds crazy, read it."</seg>
<seg id="7">It is an incredible story.</seg>
<seg id="8">But do you know who the chapter did not fall?</seg>
<seg id="9">The US government.</seg>
<seg id="10">"for almost 10 years, the government has determined against cracks and urged him to name his alleged sources."</seg>
<seg id="11">"in this train, he became a symbol of the design of the government to condemn whistleblowers and to spy on journalists."</seg>
<seg id="12">"according to the First Constitutional Court, the media have the right to publish secret information."</seg>
<seg id="13">"but it is impossible to apply this right if media do not get this information, and if they cannot protect the identity of the brave they offer."</seg>
<seg id="14">"so when the government arrived at Risen, he did something that many courageous reporters did before him: he refused and said that he would rather go to jail."</seg>
<seg id="15">"from 2007 to 2015, Risen lived with the risk of going into prison."</seg>
<seg id="16">"but then, only days before the trial, something extraordinary."</seg>
<seg id="17">"suddenly, although for years they have stated that it would be essential in their case, the demands of the government on cracks were dropped."</seg>
<seg id="18">The reason: in the time of electronic surveillance the reporters and sources can be hidden more and more.</seg>
<seg id="19">"instead of separating and bringing tears to the testimony, that could also do his digital footprints for him."</seg>
<seg id="20">"and so the investigators, without his consent, have kept secret of his telephony,"</seg>
<seg id="21">"as well as its e-mail data, financial and bank information, its credit card, and even travel information with the list of its flights."</seg>
<seg id="22">"in the midst of this information, they found evidence they used to condemn Jeffrey Sterling, a CIA whistleblower and Risen's supposed source."</seg>
<seg id="23">"unfortunately, this is only one of many cases."</seg>
<seg id="24">"President Obama promised to protect whistleblowers, but instead the judiciary has more condemns than all US governments before him."</seg>
<seg id="25">"now you can imagine how this can be a problem, especially because the government has too much of its work as secret."</seg>
<seg id="26">"since September 11, almost every article about national security was the result of a whistleblower went to a journalist."</seg>
<seg id="27">"so we put the press work on the game, which is to be protected by the first constitutional order, because the government has more and more possibilities to spy on everyone."</seg>
<seg id="28">"but just as the government's technology allows to bypass the rights of reporters, the press can also use technologies to better protect their sources."</seg>
<seg id="29">"and indeed, they can do that from the moment they contact, rather than in hindsight, in the testimony."</seg>
<seg id="30">"today there are communication software, which has not yet existed when Risen had written his book, and it is much safer than normal emails or phone calls."</seg>
<seg id="31">"such technology is SecureDrop, an open source transmission system for whistleblower that was originally developed by Aaron Swartz, and is today developed by the Freedom of the Press Foundation in which I have been working."</seg>
<seg id="32">"instead of sending an e-mail, go to a news website, just like the Washington Post."</seg>
<seg id="33">"there you can upload documents or send information, as with any usual contact form."</seg>
<seg id="34">"these are then encrypted and stored on a server, to which only the relevant news agency has access."</seg>
<seg id="35">"so the government can no longer procure information secretly, and many of the information they would request would not be available from the outset."</seg>
<seg id="36">"however, SecureDrop is only a small part of the whole to protect the freedom of the press in the 21st century."</seg>
<seg id="37">"unfortunately, governments around the world are developing new espionage technologies that threaten us all."</seg>
<seg id="38">"it is important to us to ensure that not only technology denominators such as Edward Snowden have a chance to apply misdeeds. it's just as important that we protect the next whistle-blowers,"</seg>
<seg id="39">Or the next environmental labourer who alerts alarm to contaminated water from Flint. or a Wall Street insider that warns us from the next financial crisis.</seg>
<seg id="40">"after all, these technologies were not only made for those who want to expose the crimes, but to protect our all constitutional rights."</seg>
<seg id="41">Thanks.</seg>
<seg id="42">[on 3 April 2016 the biggest data leck of the story was published.] [the "Panama Papers" reveal that rich and mighty] [huge sums of money in tax havens have hidden.] [what does that mean?] [we bade Robert Palmer of Global Witness for an explanation.]</seg>
<seg id="43">The publication of these documents gives a small insight into the secret world of tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="44">"we get an impression of how customers, banks and lawyers go to companies such as Moselle Fonseca and say:" okay, we need an anonymous company. can you set up this? "</seg>
<seg id="45">"we actually see the e-mails, the exchange of messages, as the whole system works as it works."</seg>
<seg id="46">This has already led to very direct consequences.</seg>
<seg id="47">Iceland's prime minister resigned.</seg>
<seg id="48">There are also reports that an ally of the brutal Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad has mailbox offices in tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="49">"it is alleged that a trace of US $2 billion leads to Russian President Vladimir Putin, about a close friend of children's days, a famous cellist."</seg>
<seg id="50">"now there will be a lot of rich people out there and others who wait for the next release, and on the next unveiled documents."</seg>
<seg id="51">Now it sounds like the plot of a agency enthrillers or a John Grisham's novel.</seg>
<seg id="52">"it seems crying from you, me, ordinary people."</seg>
<seg id="53">Why should we do that?</seg>
<seg id="54">"but the truth is: if the rich and powerful are able to hide their wealth in tax havens and not all pay their taxes, this means less money for important public services such as health care, education, roads."</seg>
<seg id="55">And that concerns all of us.</seg>
<seg id="56">"for my organization, Global Witness, these revelations are phenomenal."</seg>
<seg id="57">"in the whole world media and leading politicians, how secret tax havens are used by some few to hide their fortunes and disguise them -- something that we have been discussing and revealing for ten years."</seg>
<seg id="58">"I think many people seem very confusing this whole world, and it's hard to understand how these tax havens work."</seg>
<seg id="59">I always imagine it like a matrjoschkapuppe.</seg>
<seg id="60">"so one has a company in another company, in another company, which makes it almost impossible to really understand who is behind these bones."</seg>
<seg id="61">"it can be very difficult for prosecuting and tax authorities, as well as for journalists or civil society to really understand what is happening."</seg>
<seg id="62">I find it interesting that there are fewer reports on this matter in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="63">"presumably, because there have been no prominent Americans who occurred in these revelations, this scandal."</seg>
<seg id="64">"now, it is not that there are no rich Americans who hide their wealth in tax havens."</seg>
<seg id="65">"but by the principle of which these tax havens function, Mossack Fonseca has less American customers."</seg>
<seg id="66">"if we had a data leak from the Cayman Islands or even from Delaware, Wyoming or Nevada, we would see a lot more cases and examples that have connections to the USA."</seg>
<seg id="67">"in fact, there is less information in some US states to give less information to establish a company than to get a library card."</seg>
<seg id="68">This type of intransparency in the United States has allowed employees of school districts to rip school children off.</seg>
<seg id="69">It has allowed scammers to rip especially susceptible investors.</seg>
<seg id="70">It is this kind of behavior that affects all of us.</seg>
<seg id="71">"here at Global Witness, we wanted to find out how it looks like all this in practice."</seg>
<seg id="72">How does it actually work?</seg>
<seg id="73">So we sent a covert investigator into the offices of 13 lawyers in Manhattan.</seg>
<seg id="74">"our investigator proved to be an African minister, who wanted to bring suspicious money to the US to buy a house, a yacht, a private jet."</seg>
<seg id="75">We really shocked it that everyone had suggestions to our investigator as he could transfer his money.</seg>
<seg id="76">"none of these lawyers took us as a client, and of course nobody was given money to anybody. however, it shows the problem with this system."</seg>
<seg id="77">It is also important not to consider this as an individual case.</seg>
<seg id="78">"it is not about a single lawyer, who has submitted proposals to our covert investigator."</seg>
<seg id="79">"it is not about a single leading politician, involved in a scandal."</seg>
<seg id="80">"it is about how the system works, through corruption, tax evasion, poverty and instability."</seg>
<seg id="81">"and in order to cope with this, we have to change the rules of the game."</seg>
<seg id="82">We need to change the rules to make this kind of behavior harder.</seg>
<seg id="83">"this may sound very sad, as if we can't do anything about it; as if nothing has ever changed, as if there is always the rich and powerful."</seg>
<seg id="84">"but as a secure optimist, I see quite a lot to change."</seg>
<seg id="85">"over the past few years, we have seen projections to more transparency, which concerns the owners of companies."</seg>
<seg id="86">The topic found political attention by British Prime Minister David Cameron on the G8 summit in 2013 in Northern Ireland.</seg>
<seg id="87">"since then, the EU has been registering in central registers on a national level, who really is behind companies in Europe and who controls it."</seg>
<seg id="88">One of the unpleasant facts is that the US lagged behind.</seg>
<seg id="89">"representatives of both parties have submitted a bill in both parliamentarians, but this does not make the progress we would like to see."</seg>
<seg id="90">"we would really like to see how these Panama revelations, this huge insight into the world of tax havens, is used as a means to ensure greater transparency in the United States and globally."</seg>
<seg id="91">"for us at Global Witness, this is a moment for changes."</seg>
<seg id="92">We need ordinary people who will be angry when they see how other people can hide their true identity behind false companies.</seg>
<seg id="93">We need leaders in the economy that stand up and say: "transparency is not good for business."</seg>
<seg id="94">"" "we need leading politicians who recognize the problem and use them to end this kind of intransparency through laws."</seg>
<seg id="95">"together we can finally end the Intransparence, which now offers this type of tax evasion, corruption and money laundering."</seg>
<seg id="96">This is the story as I almost kidnapped and landed in the trunk of a red Mazdas.</seg>
<seg id="97">"a day after I finished my design studies, I made a backyard sale."</seg>
<seg id="98">A guy in the red Mazda stopped and looked at my stuff.</seg>
<seg id="99">He bought one of my works of art.</seg>
<seg id="100">He was alone in the city and just made a road trip across the country. after that he would go to the peace corps.</seg>
<seg id="101">I invited him to a beer. he told me how he wanted to change the world.</seg>
<seg id="102">It was late. I was tired.</seg>
<seg id="103">"while we paid the bill, I made the mistake to ask him:" "where do you sleep tonight?"</seg>
<seg id="104">"he made the whole thing even worse:" "I don't know yet."</seg>
<seg id="105">"and I thought," Oh, man! "</seg>
<seg id="106">What do I do now? "</seg>
<seg id="107">Who does not know the situation?</seg>
<seg id="108">Do I have to offer a sleeping place now?</seg>
<seg id="109">"but I just got to know him! he says he would go to the Corps of Peace, but I don't know if he really plans it. I don't want to end up in the trunk of a Mazdas!"</seg>
<seg id="110">This is a small trunk!</seg>
<seg id="111">Then I heard: "I have an air mattress. you can sleep in my living room."</seg>
<seg id="112">"a voice in my head said," "uh, as please?"</seg>
<seg id="113">"at night I was lying in bed, I stared at the ceiling and thought:" Oh man! what did I rock myself? "</seg>
<seg id="114">A wild alien sleeping in my living room.</seg>
<seg id="115">What if he is mad?</seg>
<seg id="116">"I got such fear that I went out of bed, sneaking on toes to the door, and my bedroom door closed."</seg>
<seg id="117">But he was not crazy.</seg>
<seg id="118">We are still in contact.</seg>
<seg id="119">The work of art he bought from me hangs today in his classroom. he is now a teacher.</seg>
<seg id="120">That was my first experience as a host. it has completely changed my point of view.</seg>
<seg id="121">"maybe the people who were sold to me in childhood as a stranger, actually friends who were only waiting to be discovered?"</seg>
<seg id="122">"when I moved to San Francisco, I took the air mattress."</seg>
<seg id="123">"let's make a leap, two years later..."</seg>
<seg id="124">"I am unemployed, fast, my roommate shares and the rent is increased."</seg>
<seg id="125">I learned that at that time there was a design conference in the city. all hotels were fully booked.</seg>
<seg id="126">I think creativity can create it to transform fear into fun.</seg>
<seg id="127">"I wrote to my best friend and new roommate Brian Chesky:" Brian, I think about how we could make something about it. our apartment will stay at a designer bed and breakfast. young designers can stay with us, Wi-Fi and a desk included, including a mattress and breakfast each morning. "</seg>
<seg id="128">Ha!</seg>
<seg id="129">We created a website and founded so "air mattress and breakfast" [AIRBed aNd Breakfast = Airbnb].</seg>
<seg id="130">Three lucky guests were allowed to sleep at us for 20 dollars on the air mattress on wooden floors.</seg>
<seg id="131">"they found it super, and we too."</seg>
<seg id="132">"I am sure that our cheese prosciutto cheeses tasted completely different, because we made it for our guests."</seg>
<seg id="133">"we toured with them throughout the city. when we said goodbye to our last guest and the door was falling into the castle, Brian and I stared."</seg>
<seg id="134">Had we just discovered that we could find new friends at the same time and could pay our rent?</seg>
<seg id="135">Things came in roles.</seg>
<seg id="136">"my former roommate, Nate Blecharczyk, joined us as a developer."</seg>
<seg id="137">We wanted to find out whether to make it a business concept.</seg>
<seg id="138">"we presented ourselves to investors:" we want to create a website where people post public pictures of their private rooms, their bedrooms, their bathrooms -- the kind of rooms whose doors are closed when you visit. "</seg>
<seg id="139">"over the Internet, they can then invite wild people to stay with them."</seg>
<seg id="140">This will be the next big thing! "</seg>
<seg id="141">We waited for the rocket to ignite.</seg>
<seg id="142">"indeed, they do not."</seg>
<seg id="143">"no one, who is still at Trost, would invest in a business that allows foreigners to sleep in apartments of other people."</seg>
<seg id="144">Why?</seg>
<seg id="145">Because we all learned as children that strangers are dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="146">"if you have a problem, you get to the things that you can do well. we could design."</seg>
<seg id="147">"at the Kunstakademie, we learned that design is much more than just appearance and feel -- it is the overall experience."</seg>
<seg id="148">"we had learned how to design objects, but now we wanted to create immense trust between people who never met before."</seg>
<seg id="149">Can design do something like that?</seg>
<seg id="150">Is it possible to create trust with design?</seg>
<seg id="151">I would like to give you a sample of what degree of confidence we aspire to.</seg>
<seg id="152">It is a 30-second experiment. it will force you out of your comfort zone.</seg>
<seg id="153">Thumbs up when you are ready.</seg>
<seg id="154">Take your mobile phone into your hand.</seg>
<seg id="155">Now I want you to unlock your mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="156">Give your unlocked cell phone to your left bench neighbour.</seg>
<seg id="157">This silent flight of panic you can now feel -- -- is exactly what hosts feel when they open the door for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="158">The only thing more personal than your mobile phone is your home.</seg>
<seg id="159">"visitors can not only read your SMS, they see your bedroom, your kitchen, your toilet."</seg>
<seg id="160">How does it feel to hold the unlocked cell phone of a stranger?</seg>
<seg id="161">Most sense the responsibility.</seg>
<seg id="162">Most guests feel like staying somewhere else.</seg>
<seg id="163">Only for this reason our company can exist.</seg>
<seg id="164">"only once, who actually has Al Gores mobile?"</seg>
<seg id="165">Could you please announce on Twitter that he will be the President of the President?</seg>
<seg id="166">You can now return the cell phones now.</seg>
<seg id="167">You have now experienced what kind of trust we want to build. I want to tell you about some discoveries.</seg>
<seg id="168">What if we had changed a little detail in this experiment?</seg>
<seg id="169">"what if your neighbor would have imagined it once with his name, if he had told where he comes from whence his dog or his children are?"</seg>
<seg id="170">Imagine you would have 150 evaluations that all say: "he can really capture very well unlocked mobile phones!</seg>
<seg id="171">How would you feel if you would have to leave your mobile phone?</seg>
<seg id="172">Because a well thought-out feedback system strengthens trust in a decisive way.</seg>
<seg id="173">At the beginning we did some things wrong.</seg>
<seg id="174">It was hard for the people to leave negative judgements.</seg>
<seg id="175">"in the end, we decided to wait until both hosts and guests had given their evaluations before we put them online."</seg>
<seg id="176">Last week we discovered something new.</seg>
<seg id="177">"we conducted a study with Stanford. we examined how likely it is that people trust each other, depending on how similar they are regarding age and place of residence."</seg>
<seg id="178">"not surprisingly, we trust most people who are most similar to us."</seg>
<seg id="179">"the more differences we find, the less we trust."</seg>
<seg id="180">This is a natural social bias.</seg>
<seg id="181">It will be exciting to add a person's reputation -- in our case by judgements.</seg>
<seg id="182">"if you have less than three assessments, nothing changes."</seg>
<seg id="183">"but if you have more than ten, everything changes."</seg>
<seg id="184">A good reputation stiff similarities.</seg>
<seg id="185">The right design can help us overcome some of our deep-rooted preference.</seg>
<seg id="186">"in addition, we learned that trust depends on how much one is offered."</seg>
<seg id="187">Here you can see the reactions to the first message of a guest.</seg>
<seg id="188">"if you tell too little, like" Hi, "you don't get an answer."</seg>
<seg id="189">"you tell too much, for example:" I have problems with my mother "-- -- the request will not be accepted."</seg>
<seg id="190">"so there is an optimal degree of openness, e.g." "Tolle works of art in your apartment! I make holiday with my family holiday."</seg>
<seg id="191">How can you create it with design to make this degree of openness?</seg>
<seg id="192">We use the size of the text field to recommend the right amount of text. we also provide tips on which topics you should write something.</seg>
<seg id="193">Our whole company builds on the hope that the right design can help overcome our prejudices towards strangers.</seg>
<seg id="194">"with what we did not expect, the great amount of people who were more than willing to lay down these prejudices."</seg>
<seg id="195">Here you see how many people claim our offer.</seg>
<seg id="196">You can see three things.</seg>
<seg id="197">"first, incredibly good luck."</seg>
<seg id="198">Second: the tireless work of our team.</seg>
<seg id="199">"third: a need, which had not been met before."</seg>
<seg id="200">"for us, the business is going very well."</seg>
<seg id="201">"of course, there are times when not everything runs smoothly."</seg>
<seg id="202">There were guests who disallowed parties to celebrate parties or have ravaged apartments.</seg>
<seg id="203">Hosts have guests in the rain.</seg>
<seg id="204">"at the beginning of the project, I worked on the customer service. all calls came directly to my mobile phone."</seg>
<seg id="205">I stood at the forefront when trust was broken.</seg>
<seg id="206">There is nothing worse than these calls. it hurts when I only think about it.</seg>
<seg id="207">"the disappointment, which one hears in the voice of the caller, was and will always be our greatest motivation to further improve."</seg>
<seg id="208">"fortunately, the 123 million overnight stays only have a fraction of a problem."</seg>
<seg id="209">For people trust each other rightly.</seg>
<seg id="210">"if confidence works, wondrous can arise."</seg>
<seg id="211">One of our guests made a holiday in Uruguay. there he suffered a heart attack.</seg>
<seg id="212">His host drove him to the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="213">He even donated blood for the necessary operation!</seg>
<seg id="214">Here is his assessment:</seg>
<seg id="215">Perfect house for travelers who tend to have heart attacks due to sedentary activities.</seg>
<seg id="216">The area is beautiful and equipped with sufficient hospitals.</seg>
<seg id="217">"Javier and Alejandra are true guardian angels who save lives, even though they don't know it right."</seg>
<seg id="218">"you drive one in your own car to the hospital, when you die, and wait while you get a bypass."</seg>
<seg id="219">"because they don't want you to feel lonely, they bring books past."</seg>
<seg id="220">You can even stay longer without calculating extra nights.</seg>
<seg id="221">I can only recommend it! "</seg>
<seg id="222">"of course, not every stay expires."</seg>
<seg id="223">But these relationships behind the pure money transaction are exactly what you want to achieve with the Share Economy.</seg>
<seg id="224">"when I stumbled upon this term for the first time, I asked myself:"</seg>
<seg id="225">How does the idea of sharing with money transactions fit together?</seg>
<seg id="226">It is an economic trade.</seg>
<seg id="227">"but now just call" "rental industry", "the thing is not justified."</seg>
<seg id="228">Share Economy describes a trade that promises human relationships.</seg>
<seg id="229">"people lay a part of themselves open, and that changes everything."</seg>
<seg id="230">"when you travel today, this is comparable to Fast Food. it is efficient and reliable, but less authentic."</seg>
<seg id="231">What if traveling would be a rich buffet of local impressions?</seg>
<seg id="232">"what if in any place you visited, a group there would be waiting for a group to fill a thoroughly and show you a pub crawl area that you have never heard before;"</seg>
<seg id="233">Or if you could learn cooking from a five-star chef?</seg>
<seg id="234">"today, apartments are designed according to the principle of privacy."</seg>
<seg id="235">What if we would shape apartments from the ground up to each other?</seg>
<seg id="236">How would this look like?</seg>
<seg id="237">What if cities would accept the idea of common participation?</seg>
<seg id="238">"I imagine cities which allow us society and relationships, instead of loneliness and depreciation."</seg>
<seg id="239">"in South Korea's capital Seoul, this project has already begun."</seg>
<seg id="240">Students who were looking for a place to stay</seg>
<seg id="241">"were mediated to people whose children were pulled out, incubator programs were launched,"</seg>
<seg id="242">"to be able to finance new startups in the Share economy. on our platform alone, 785 000 people in 191 countries will be guest at a stranger or even a host."</seg>
<seg id="243">So the idea does not seem to be as crazy as it was taught to us.</seg>
<seg id="244">We did not reinvent the wheel.</seg>
<seg id="245">There were also hospitality previously.</seg>
<seg id="246">There were similar websites in front of us.</seg>
<seg id="247">So why did our work just work?</seg>
<seg id="248">"apart from luck and timing, we realized that you can find the right design with the components of trust."</seg>
<seg id="249">Design can help us overcome deep-rooted prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="250">"I think this is amazing,"</seg>
<seg id="251">Almost overwhelming.</seg>
<seg id="252">Every time I have to think about when a red Mazda is passing by me.</seg>
<seg id="253">"we know, of course, that design cannot solve any problem."</seg>
<seg id="254">"but if it could help us if it had this great influence, I wonder why we can use design soon."</seg>
<seg id="255">Thanks.</seg>
<seg id="256">What do you think if you watch me?</seg>
<seg id="257">A believer? an expert?</seg>
<seg id="258">Maybe even a sister.</seg>
<seg id="259">"or suppressed, brainwashed, a terrorist?"</seg>
<seg id="260">Or simply a delay in the safety check at the airport.</seg>
<seg id="261">This is indeed true.</seg>
<seg id="262">I do not give you the blame for your negative impressions.</seg>
<seg id="263">So the media portray people who look like me.</seg>
<seg id="264">"Euromonitor International has over 40 years' experience of publishing market research reports, business reference books and online information systems."</seg>
<seg id="265">Studies show that the Americans think most would not know Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="266">Probably people don't talk to their Uber drivers.</seg>
<seg id="267">"for all those who have never met a Muslim, it is great to meet you."</seg>
<seg id="268">I tell you who I am.</seg>
<seg id="269">"I am a mother, a coffee maker -- double espresso, with cream extra."</seg>
<seg id="270">"I am introverted,"</seg>
<seg id="271">A Möchtegern-fitness fanatikerin</seg>
<seg id="272">"and I am a practicing, spiritual Muslims."</seg>
<seg id="273">"but not like Lady Gaga sings, because, baby, I was not born so."</seg>
<seg id="274">I have decided to do this.</seg>
<seg id="275">"when I was 17 years old, I made the decision to oute me."</seg>
<seg id="276">"no, not as a homosexual man, like some of my friends, but as Muslims. I decided to wear my headgear."</seg>
<seg id="277">"my feminist girlfriends were horrified," Why do you suppress yourself? "</seg>
<seg id="278">"the funny thing was: at that time, it was a feminist declaration of independence, in contrast to the pressure I felt 17-year-old to adapt me to a perfect and unattainable beauty ideal."</seg>
<seg id="279">I have not just accepted the faith of my parents.</seg>
<seg id="280">I have led with the Koran.</seg>
<seg id="281">"I read it, thought, questioned, doubted, and ultimately believed."</seg>
<seg id="282">My relationship with God was not love at first sight.</seg>
<seg id="283">It was trust and slow surrender which deepened with every reading of the Qur'an.</seg>
<seg id="284">The beauty of the rhythm sometimes brings me to cry.</seg>
<seg id="285">I recognize myself in it. I feel that God knows me.</seg>
<seg id="286">"have you ever had the feeling that someone takes you, fully understands you, and yet somehow loves you?"</seg>
<seg id="287">This is how it feels.</seg>
<seg id="288">"later I married and started, like all the good Egyptians, my career as an engineer."</seg>
<seg id="289">"later, after my marriage, I had a child, and basically lived the Egyptian-American dream."</seg>
<seg id="290">Then came the awful morning in September 2001.</seg>
<seg id="291">Many of you probably remember where they were there.</seg>
<seg id="292">"I sat in my kitchen, had breakfast at the end, looked at the screen and saw the word" Breaking News. ""</seg>
<seg id="293">"there was smoke, airplanes flew into buildings, people ran out of the buildings."</seg>
<seg id="294">What was that?</seg>
<seg id="295">An accident?</seg>
<seg id="296">A technical fault?</seg>
<seg id="297">My shock was quickly transformed into indignation.</seg>
<seg id="298">Why should I do something like that?</seg>
<seg id="299">"I switched to the television channel and stopped:..." Muslim terrorists... "..." in the name of Islam... "..."... jihad... ","... "bombed Mekka!"</seg>
<seg id="300">"Oh, my God."</seg>
<seg id="301">"it is not only my country attacked, but in the Nu the deeds of others turned me from a citizen into a suspect."</seg>
<seg id="302">"on the same day, we had to drive through the Middle East of the USA to move into a new city and start studying."</seg>
<seg id="303">"I remember as I was silent -- as we were silently -- so deep it went up into my seat, and I was the first time to be recognized as Muslims."</seg>
<seg id="304">"we went into our apartment this night, in a new city where it felt like a completely different world."</seg>
<seg id="305">"and then I saw and read the warnings of the national Islamic organisations, who said:" be vigilant, "" Be careful, "" Stay in well lit areas, "" Don't take away. "</seg>
<seg id="306">I stayed the whole week inside.</seg>
<seg id="307">Then it was Friday that week -- the day when Muslims gather to pray.</seg>
<seg id="308">"and again the warnings said," "Don't go on this first Friday, the mosque could be a goal."</seg>
<seg id="309">I saw a lot of coverage.</seg>
<seg id="310">"the feelings were understandably unfiltered, and I also heard of attacks on Muslims or by people that were held for Muslims, dragging and banging."</seg>
<seg id="311">There were really fire attacks on mosques.</seg>
<seg id="312">I thought: we should stay at home.</seg>
<seg id="313">But something really did not feel right.</seg>
<seg id="314">Because the people who attacked this country have attacked our country.</seg>
<seg id="315">I have done the anger of the people on the terrorists.</seg>
<seg id="316">Imagine! I was angry.</seg>
<seg id="317">It is not easy to constantly explain itself.</seg>
<seg id="318">"I have nothing against questions, I love questions."</seg>
<seg id="319">They are the accusations that are tough.</seg>
<seg id="320">Today we can actually say people say: "there is a problem in this country -- it is Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="321">When will we go? "</seg>
<seg id="322">Some people want to banish Muslims and close mosques.</seg>
<seg id="323">They speak of my church like a tumor in the US body.</seg>
<seg id="324">Only the question arises: are we malignant or benign?</seg>
<seg id="325">They know that a malignant tumor is removed as a whole and a benign tumour is just under observation.</seg>
<seg id="326">The alternatives are pointless because the question is wrong.</seg>
<seg id="327">"Muslims are, like all other Americans, not a tumor in the US's body, but a vital organ."</seg>
<seg id="328">Thanks!</seg>
<seg id="329">"Muslims are the inventors and teachers, the helpers and the Olympic Games."</seg>
<seg id="330">Will the closure of mosques America make safer?</seg>
<seg id="331">"there may be a few parking spaces, but not stop terror."</seg>
<seg id="332">"the regular visit of a mosque leads to a more tolerant view of people, and to show greater citizen participation."</seg>
<seg id="333">"and as I told me a head of the police in the Washington area, DC recently told: people are actually not radicalised in mosques."</seg>
<seg id="334">They are radicalised in their basement or in bed in front of a computer.</seg>
<seg id="335">"during the radicalization process, one has found that it begins online. first, the person is cut off from their church, even from their family, so that the extremists believe that the person believes the terrorists are the true Muslims, and everyone who abhors their behavior and their ideology is a traitor or of faith."</seg>
<seg id="336">"if we want to prevent radicalisation, we must stop people to go to the mosque."</seg>
<seg id="337">Some will still claim that Islam is a non-violent religion.</seg>
<seg id="338">"finally, a group like IS establishes its brutality with the Koran."</seg>
<seg id="339">"as a Muslim, as a human being, I believe that we must do everything to stop a group like the IS."</seg>
<seg id="340">"but we would add ourselves to their imagination, when they recognize them as representatives of 1.6 billion believers."</seg>
<seg id="341">Thanks!</seg>
<seg id="342">The IS has so much to do with Islam as the Ku-Klux clan with Christianity.</seg>
<seg id="343">Both groups claim their ideology on their "Holy Book."</seg>
<seg id="344">"but if you throw a look at her, she does not drive what she lases in her" Holy Scriptures. ""</seg>
<seg id="345">It is their brutality that lets them read these things into Scripture.</seg>
<seg id="346">An outstanding Imam recently told me an amazing story:</seg>
<seg id="347">"a girl came to him, because she preferred to join the IS."</seg>
<seg id="348">I was really surprised and asked him if she had been in contact with radical religious leaders.</seg>
<seg id="349">"he said the problem was exactly the opposite. every priest with whom she spoke, brought her to silence and told her that her anger, her sense of injustice in the world, would only bring them into trouble."</seg>
<seg id="350">"inspired by nothing, and something that would have made sense to their fury, it was a main goal for the instrumentalization of extremists that you promised a solution."</seg>
<seg id="351">This Imam returned to God and her church.</seg>
<seg id="352">"instead of accusing them for their anger, he showed their constructive ways for real change in the world."</seg>
<seg id="353">What she learned in the mosque kept her to join the IS.</seg>
<seg id="354">This was an insight into how the Islamophobia belongs to me and my family.</seg>
<seg id="355">But how does it affect ordinary Americans?</seg>
<seg id="356">How does it affect everyone else?</seg>
<seg id="357">"how does the 24-hour consuming of fear affect our democracy every day, on our freedom of thought?"</seg>
<seg id="358">"a study -- actually several neuroscientific studies -- show: if we fear, at least three things happen."</seg>
<seg id="359">"we rather accept an authoritarian government system, conformance and prejudice."</seg>
<seg id="360">"a study shows: if you submit news reports in which negative about Muslims were reported, they rather agree to military attacks on Muslim countries as well as circumcision of the rights of American Muslims."</seg>
<seg id="361">This is not just an academic problem.</seg>
<seg id="362">"if you look when the mood against Muslims was pushed up -- between 2001 and 2013 -- then this happened three times, but never in connection with terrorist attacks."</seg>
<seg id="363">It happened in the run-up of the Iraq war and during two elections.</seg>
<seg id="364">So Islamophobia is not simply the natural reaction to Muslim terror as I expected.</seg>
<seg id="365">"in fact, it can be a tool to manipulate the public to undermine the foundation of a free society that has reasonable and well informed citizens."</seg>
<seg id="366">Dealing with Muslims is an early warning sign.</seg>
<seg id="367">"we may feel it as the first, but the toxic air of fear hurts us all."</seg>
<seg id="368">"with the assignment of collective debt, it is not just about to explain itself."</seg>
<seg id="369">"Deah and his wife Yusor were a young, married couple living in Chapel Hill, North Carolina where both went to school."</seg>
<seg id="370">Deah was a sportsman.</seg>
<seg id="371">"he was at the dental faculty, talented, promising..."</seg>
<seg id="372">"his sister would say to me that he was the sweetest, generous person she knew."</seg>
<seg id="373">She visited him there and he showed her his CV. she was stunned and said:</seg>
<seg id="374">"when has my brother become such a skilled young man?" ""</seg>
<seg id="375">"just a few weeks after the visit of Suzanne with her brother and his wife, her neighbor, Craig Stephen Hicks, she murdered, just like the Sister of Yusor, Razan who had been visiting in the afternoon. he did it in her apartment, as with a execution after he had posted statements against Muslims on his Facebook page."</seg>
<seg id="376">He was shot eight times on Deah.</seg>
<seg id="377">"fanaticism can be not only immoral, but also fatal."</seg>
<seg id="378">So back to the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="379">What happened after 9 / 11?</seg>
<seg id="380">Did we go to the mosque or stayed safe at home?</seg>
<seg id="381">"we discussed it and it was no easy decision for us, because it was about which America we want to leave to our children: one that would control us by fear, or one in which we can freely exercise our religion."</seg>
<seg id="382">We decided for the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="383">"with our son in the children's seat, we rode silent, with high pressure to the mosque."</seg>
<seg id="384">"I took him out, and drew my shoes, and went into the hall, and what I saw, let me stand."</seg>
<seg id="385">The hall was completely filled.</seg>
<seg id="386">"then the Imam made an announcement, thanked and welcomed our guests, for half of the gathering were Christians, Jews, Buddhists, atheists, believers and non-believers who came not to attack us, but to assist us."</seg>
<seg id="387">In this moment I am collapsed.</seg>
<seg id="388">These people were there because they had had courage and compassion for panic and prejudice.</seg>
<seg id="389">What will you choose?</seg>
<seg id="390">What will you choose at the moment of fear and fanaticism?</seg>
<seg id="391">Will you be safe on number?</seg>
<seg id="392">Or will you join those who mean: we are better than those.</seg>
<seg id="393">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="394">Thank you very much!</seg>
<seg id="395">"Helen Walters: so Dalia, you seem to have met a nerve."</seg>
<seg id="396">"but I wonder what you say to those who might say that you are holding a TEDTalk, a mindful with draught, in a noble thought factory, so an exception and not the rule."</seg>

<seg id="406">HW: thanks. Dalia Mogahed.</seg>
<seg id="407">"what started as a platform for hobbyists, is short before becoming a billionaire business."</seg>
<seg id="408">"control, environmental monitoring, photography, film and journalism: these are some of the potential applications for commercial drones."</seg>
<seg id="409">"before air padding in our social consciousness penetrated, an autonomous fleet of aircraft at the FRAC Centre in France has built a six meter high tower of 1 500 bricks. several years ago, they began to fly with ropes."</seg>
<seg id="410">"by connecting, flight devices reach high speed and acceleration in tight spaces."</seg>
<seg id="411">You can also build independently turn-loaded structures.</seg>
<seg id="412">"they have learned to bear burdens, deal with turbulence and generally respond to natural laws."</seg>
<seg id="413">Today we want to show you some of our new projects.</seg>
<seg id="414">Our aim is to exceed the limits of the possible in the autonomous flight.</seg>
<seg id="415">"in order for a system to work autonomously, it has to know collectively where the mobile objects are located."</seg>
<seg id="416">"in our laboratory at ETH Zurich we often use external cameras to find objects, which enables us to focus on the rapid development of dynamic tasks."</seg>
<seg id="417">"for today's demos, we use a new localization technology from Verity Studios, a publisher of our laboratory."</seg>
<seg id="418">There are no external cameras.</seg>
<seg id="419">"each aircraft has internal sensors to determine the position in the room, determine the calculations on board the machine should do."</seg>
<seg id="420">"external commands are available at the highest level, e.g." "start" "and" "landing." ""</seg>
<seg id="421">"this is a so-called rear starter,"</seg>
<seg id="422">"a flight device, trying to beat two flies with a flap."</seg>
<seg id="423">"like other starters, the forward flight is efficient, much more efficient than helicopters in all its variations."</seg>
<seg id="424">"unlike most starters, it can float, and has great advantages when starting and landing, and is very versatile."</seg>
<seg id="425">"however, there is always a sweeping side."</seg>
<seg id="426">A restriction of rear starters is that they react sensitively to turbulences such as wind arches.</seg>
<seg id="427">We develop new controllers and algorithms to improve this.</seg>
<seg id="428">The idea behind it is that the flight device will be able to regain the optimum position and improve performance by practicing.</seg>
<seg id="429">Okay.</seg>
<seg id="430">"during our research, we often face basic abstract questions that are at the core of the matter."</seg>
<seg id="431">"for example, such a question would be: what is the smallest number of moving parts for controlled flights?"</seg>
<seg id="432">There are practical reasons for wanting to know the answer to such a question.</seg>
<seg id="433">"helicopters are known as machines with thousands of movable parts, which meet to hurt you."</seg>
<seg id="434">"decades ago trained pilots were able to fly remote-controlled aircraft, which had only two movable parts: a propeller and a stern rudder."</seg>
<seg id="435">"recently, we discovered that flying with only one works."</seg>
<seg id="436">"this is the monospinner, the mechanically simplest remote-controlled flight device. it was invented recently."</seg>
<seg id="437">"it has only one movable part, a propeller,"</seg>
<seg id="438">"no flaps, hinges and cross-rudder, no further actuators or control surfaces, only a propeller."</seg>
<seg id="439">"although it is mechanically simple, inside the inner life happens very much so that it can fly stable and move in space."</seg>
<seg id="440">"however, it does not have the elegant algorithm of the rear starters. to get it to fly, I have to throw it exactly right."</seg>
<seg id="441">"the chance to throw it exactly right if all of you watch is low, so I'll show you a video filmed yesterday evening."</seg>
<seg id="442">"when the monospinner is an exercise in cruelty, this machine is here, the omnibus with its eight propellers, an exercise in abundance."</seg>
<seg id="443">What to do with all this abundance?</seg>
<seg id="444">They see that it is only symmetrical.</seg>
<seg id="445">That is why it is ambivalent in its alignment.</seg>
<seg id="446">"by doing so, he receives the extraordinary ability to"</seg>
<seg id="447">"move in the room in all directions, no matter what direction it is rotated or even as it rotates."</seg>
<seg id="448">"of course, it is complex, mainly in the area of interactive rivers of the eight propellers."</seg>
<seg id="449">"some are available in models, the rest is learned directly when flying."</seg>
<seg id="450">Let's see that.</seg>
<seg id="451">"if aircraft should be part of our everyday life, they must be extremely safe and reliable."</seg>
<seg id="452">This machine here consists of two separate two-propeller aircraft.</seg>
<seg id="453">This rotates clockwise</seg>
<seg id="454">And the other anti-clockwise.</seg>
<seg id="455">"when you build them together, they behave like a high-performance quadrocopter."</seg>
<seg id="456">"however, something wrong -- an engine or propeller falls off, the electronics or a battery -- can fly the machine further, if also restricted."</seg>
<seg id="457">We will demonstrate that by doing one half airworthy.</seg>
<seg id="458">The last demonstration examines synthetic swarms.</seg>
<seg id="459">"the large number of autonomous, coordinated units allows a range of aesthetic expression."</seg>
<seg id="460">We received commercially available Micro-Quadcopter -- each single weighs less than one slice of bread -- and equip them with localization technology and algorithms.</seg>
<seg id="461">Each unit knows where space it is and is self-controlled. therefore there is no upper limit.</seg>
<seg id="462">Hopefully these demonstrations will motivate you to think about new revolutionary ideas.</seg>
<seg id="463">The particularly safe machine there would like to be a flaming lampshade on Broadway.</seg>
<seg id="464">Of course it is difficult to predict the influence of this technology.</seg>
<seg id="465">For types like us lies the wage in the development and the creative act.</seg>
<seg id="466">"it serves as a reminder, how wonderful and enchanting our universe is, and that it allows creative, clever creatures allowing them to form in such a spectacular way."</seg>
<seg id="467">The fact that this technology has such massive commercial and economic potential is the icing on the cake.</seg>
<seg id="468">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="469">"1.3 billion years ago, two black holes circled in a very far distant galaxy, so the mass of three suns in a tenths of tenths turned into pure energy."</seg>
<seg id="470">"this short moment, they lit more brighter than all the stars in all galaxies of the entire universe known to us."</seg>
<seg id="471">It was a very big bang.</seg>
<seg id="472">But they did not replace their energy in the form of light --</seg>
<seg id="473">We finally speak of black holes.</seg>
<seg id="474">The entire energy was released into space-time fabric itself and the universe exploded in gravitational-waves.</seg>
<seg id="475">Let us arrange the events at first.</seg>
<seg id="476">"1.3 billion years ago, a multi-cell life was created on Earth."</seg>
<seg id="477">"since then, the Earth has brought forth a lot: corals, fish, plants, dinosaurs, people and -- God stands for us -- even the internet."</seg>
<seg id="478">"about 25 years ago, a group decided to build a giant laser detector from MIT, Kip Thorne and Ronald Drever from the Caltech -- to look for gravitational-waves, which are created by colliding black holes."</seg>
<seg id="479">Most of them kept them crazy.</seg>
<seg id="480">"but enough people recognized them as crazy geniuses, so that the US National Science Foundation financed their idea."</seg>
<seg id="481">"after decades of development, construction, conception and extremely hard work they built the detector Ligo: the laser-interferometer- gravitational-shaft observatory."</seg>
<seg id="482">"in the following period, the precision of ligo could be considerably increased, resulting in an enormously improved detection performance."</seg>
<seg id="483">Therefore it is now called Advanced Ligo.</seg>
<seg id="484">"at the beginning of September 2015, Ligo was launched for a final test run to clarify some minor, persistent issues."</seg>
<seg id="485">"on September 14, 2015, only a few days after the detectors were put into operation, the gravitational-waves of the two colliding black holes pushed through the earth."</seg>
<seg id="486">They went through you and me</seg>
<seg id="487">And also through the detector.</seg>
<seg id="488">Scott Hughes: only two moments in my life were more emotional than this:</seg>
<seg id="489">The birth of my daughter</seg>
<seg id="490">And the farewell from my death-sick father.</seg>
<seg id="491">Basically these were the fruits of my life.</seg>
<seg id="492">"AA: this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hughes, a theoretical physicist at MIT. he has been studying gravitational waves of black holes and their observatories such as ligo measurable signals."</seg>
<seg id="493">A gravitational shaft is a block in the structure of space and time.</seg>
<seg id="494">"when passing the shaft, the space and its entire content are stretched in one direction and the other is stolen."</seg>
<seg id="495">"for illustrative, lecturers in courses for the theory of relativity often lead to a really hearty dance."</seg>
<seg id="496">"stretching and dusting, stretching and dusting."</seg>
<seg id="497">"the problem is that gravitational-waves are extremely weak, even ridiculous."</seg>
<seg id="498">"on September 14, for example, each of us was stretched out and punched by us when the waves hit. the elongation of an average man was 10 high -21."</seg>
<seg id="499">"that means 20 zeros after comma, followed by a 1. therefore, one explained the ligo staff for crazy."</seg>
<seg id="500">"with a five kilometer long laser detector, and that is already absurd, this length would have to be measured in less than a thousandth of the radius of a nucleus. that's grotesque."</seg>
<seg id="501">At the end of his classic text about Gravitation</seg>
<seg id="502">"Kip Thorne, co-founder of Ligos, described the hunt for the waves:" the technical difficulties in building such detectors are enormous. "</seg>
<seg id="503">But physicists are inventive and with the support of the public all obstacles will be overcome.</seg>
<seg id="504">"Thorne published this 1973, 42 years before his success."</seg>
<seg id="505">"back to Ligo. Scott likes to claim, Ligo is more an ear than an eye."</seg>
<seg id="506">I would like to explain what this means.</seg>
<seg id="507">"visible light has a wavelength, which is much smaller than the things around us: face lifts, the size of your cell."</seg>
<seg id="508">This is quite convenient. because so you can customize a picture or a map of things by using the light coming from several points around you.</seg>
<seg id="509">When killing is different.</seg>
<seg id="510">Audible sounds have a wavelength of up to 15 meters.</seg>
<seg id="511">"therefore it is very difficult, actually impossible to produce a picture of things that mean you a lot:"</seg>
<seg id="512">For example the face of your child.</seg>
<seg id="513">"instead we listen to certain properties such as pitch and pitch, rhythm and volume to close the story behind."</seg>
<seg id="514">"right now, Alice is speaking."</seg>
<seg id="515">"and Bob breaks them."</seg>
<seg id="516">"drummer Bob." ""</seg>
<seg id="517">The same applies to gravitational-waves.</seg>
<seg id="518">"with them, we cannot produce simple pictures of objects in space."</seg>
<seg id="519">"but by watching changes in amplitude and frequency of waves, we can listen to their stories."</seg>
<seg id="520">At least for Ligo the measured frequencies are in the audible range.</seg>
<seg id="521">"so if we convert wave patterns in sound, we can literally hear all of it literally."</seg>
<seg id="522">"listening to the gravitation can tell us about the collision of two black holes, whereby my colleague Scott has been busy for a long time."</seg>
<seg id="523">"SH: two black, non-rotating holes, circular simple: wupp!"</seg>
<seg id="524">"turning the two bodies very quickly, one hears the same circle with an additional tone change. that sounds like this: Wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu!"</seg>
<seg id="525">"it is a kind of motion-form, imprinted into the waveform."</seg>
<seg id="526">"AA: on September 14, 2015 -- a date that at least I will never forget -- hearing Ligo following: [Surrender sound] somebody who knows what he has to hear knows this as sound of -- SH:... two black holes with each 30-fold solar mass, which revolve around as fast as the rods of your shaker."</seg>
<seg id="527">AA: let's think about what this means.</seg>
<seg id="528">"two black holes, the densest body in space, one with a mass of 29 suns, the other with a mass of 36 suns, circling a hundred times a second before they collide."</seg>
<seg id="529">Imagine these forces.</seg>
<seg id="530">Fantastic.</seg>
<seg id="531">And we know about it because we have heard it.</seg>
<seg id="532">There is the permanent meaning of Ligo.</seg>
<seg id="533">"Ligo opens up a completely new way to explore the universe, as it has never been possible before."</seg>
<seg id="534">On this way we can listen to the all and hear the invisible.</seg>
<seg id="535">Much in space we can -- practically or fundamentally -- not to be seen.</seg>
<seg id="536">"a supernova, for example. I would like to know why Masseria stars explode in Supernovae."</seg>
<seg id="537">They are very useful. from them we learned a lot about the universe.</seg>
<seg id="538">"but the exciting physical processes happen in the nucleus, which is hidden behind thousands of kilometers of iron, carbon and silicon."</seg>
<seg id="539">We will never see through since these opak are.</seg>
<seg id="540">"gravitational-waves penetrate iron as if it were transparent glass. the big bang: I would like to explore the first minutes of the universe, but we will never see it because the Big Bang is concealed by its own post-light."</seg>
<seg id="541">"using gravitational-waves, it should be possible to look back at the beginning."</seg>
<seg id="542">"and the most important thing: I am optimistic that in all things we have never seen, which we have never seen, and of which we have no idea. things that we only discover by listening."</seg>
<seg id="543">"in fact, Ligo found things in the first attempt we did not expect."</seg>
<seg id="544">"my colleague at MIT, Matt Evans, an important member of the Ligo project, says to this topic: me: the type of stars that bring black holes, as Ligo watches them, are the dinosaurs of the universe."</seg>
<seg id="545">"they are enormous, ancient body from prehistoric times. the black holes are so to say, the sauriers for our archaeological work."</seg>
<seg id="546">"Ligo gives us a completely different view of the events in space, on the formation of the stars, and ultimately also on how we came out of this chaos."</seg>
<seg id="547">AA: the challenge is to be as bold as possible.</seg>
<seg id="548">"thanks to Ligo, we know how to build great detectors and listen to the noise and circus of the cosmos."</seg>
<seg id="549">We need ideas for new observatories -- a completely new generation of observatories on earth and in space.</seg>
<seg id="550">For what could be nicer than to listen to the Big Bang itself?</seg>
<seg id="551">Now is the time of great dreams.</seg>
<seg id="552">Dream with us.</seg>
<seg id="553">Thanks.</seg>
<seg id="554">Some time ago I tried an experiment.</seg>
<seg id="555">"for a year I would say" "Yes!" "I was afraid of."</seg>
<seg id="556">"whether it made me nervous, brought me into unpleasant situations, I forced me to say" "Yes". ""</seg>
<seg id="557">Did I want to speak in the public?</seg>
<seg id="558">"no, but yes!"</seg>
<seg id="559">Did I want to be live on TV?</seg>
<seg id="560">"no, but yes!"</seg>
<seg id="561">Did I want to start playing with the show?</seg>
<seg id="562">"no, no, no, yes, yes, yes."</seg>
<seg id="563">"and a crazy thing happened: exactly what I feared, removed my fear."</seg>
<seg id="564">"my fear, talking to me, my social anxiety -- puff, away."</seg>
<seg id="565">The power of a word is impressive.</seg>
<seg id="566">"yes" has changed my life.</seg>
<seg id="567">"" "yes" "changed me."</seg>
<seg id="568">But there was a certain yes that changed my life to an unexpected. it started with a question of my youngest.</seg>
<seg id="569">"I have three incredible daughters, harpers, Beckett and Emerson. and Emerson, the smallest, calls all" kittens "for inexplicable reasons."</seg>
<seg id="570">As if she would be a waitress from the south.</seg>
<seg id="571">"kittens, I need milk for my beak saucer."</seg>
<seg id="572">"she asked me once I could play with her, when I was on the go. and I said," Yes. ""</seg>
<seg id="573">This Yes was the beginning</seg>
<seg id="574">"from there I swear to always play with them as soon as you ask me. no matter what I am doing, or where I go, I always say yes -- every single time."</seg>
<seg id="575">"almost. I am not perfect, but I am very tired."</seg>
<seg id="576">"it has a magical effect on me, my children, on our family."</seg>
<seg id="577">But it also has a startling side effect: only recently I fully understood that the "yes" saws to play with my children saved my career.</seg>
<seg id="578">I have a real dream job.</seg>
<seg id="579">"I am the author. I think of things, stir you to life."</seg>
<seg id="580">Traumwind.</seg>
<seg id="581">No.</seg>
<seg id="582">I am a titanium.</seg>
<seg id="583">Traumwind.</seg>
<seg id="584">I create TV. I produce TV.</seg>
<seg id="585">"I do television, in great style."</seg>
<seg id="586">"in this TV season, I am responsible for bringing 70 hours of program to the world."</seg>
<seg id="587">"four TV programs, 70 hours of television. three to four shows simultaneously are in production."</seg>
<seg id="588">Each program offers hundreds of jobs that were not in existence before.</seg>
<seg id="589">The budget for an episode of a TV station can be between three and six million dollars.</seg>
<seg id="590">Let's say five.</seg>
<seg id="591">"four episodes: grey's, 21 episodes: scandal, 15 episodes: how To Get Away With Murder, 10 episodes: the Catch, 70 hours TV,"</seg>
<seg id="592">350 million dollars for a season.</seg>
<seg id="593">In America my TV series run after each other on Thursday evening.</seg>
<seg id="594">"all over the world, my series run in 256 regions in 67 languages for 30 million viewers."</seg>
<seg id="595">"my brain is global, and 45 of these 70 TV hours are broadcasts I created myself and not only produced, so still above. I have to find time, really quiet, creative time to gather my fans around the campfire and tell my stories."</seg>
<seg id="596">"four TV series, 70 hours television, three, sometimes four, shows at the same time in production, 350 million dollars, campfire around the world."</seg>
<seg id="597">Do you know who is still doing that?</seg>
<seg id="598">"no one, therefore I am a titanium."</seg>
<seg id="599">Traumwind.</seg>
<seg id="600">I don't want to impress you with it.</seg>
<seg id="601">"I say it because I know what you think, when the word" author "falls."</seg>
<seg id="602">"I tell you so that all of you who work so hard, whether you're running a company, a country or a classroom, a business or a household, take me seriously when I say that I'm not just around the computer and fantasizing, and it's true, when I say: I don't understand that it's not all about dreams."</seg>
<seg id="603">"it is all a job, all work, all reality, all blood, all sweat -- no tears."</seg>
<seg id="604">"I work much, hard and I love it."</seg>
<seg id="605">"when I am deepened to work, there is no other feeling."</seg>
<seg id="606">My work always creates a country out of nothing.</seg>
<seg id="607">"it is when I set up troops, as I painted on a screen."</seg>
<seg id="608">"as if you have a high sound, you deliver a marathon."</seg>
<seg id="609">One feels like Beyoncé.</seg>
<seg id="610">And all this at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="611">I love to work.</seg>
<seg id="612">"it is creative, mechanical, strenuous and intoxicating, funny and disturbing, clinically and maternal, cruel and sensible."</seg>
<seg id="613">There is such a change in me when work is going well.</seg>
<seg id="614">"a buzz begins in my head, and it grows and grows, and the buzz sounds like a busy street, I could go on forever."</seg>
<seg id="615">"many people assume, when I declare to them the sum that I speak to them writing that writing me joy."</seg>
<seg id="616">"don't understand me wrong, it does."</seg>
<seg id="617">"but the sums -- when I began to work and work and work and work, build, create and work together, I discovered this thing, this buzz, this energy."</seg>
<seg id="618">The sum is more than writing.</seg>
<seg id="619">The buzz is action and activity. the buzz is a drug.</seg>
<seg id="620">The buzz is music. the buzz is light and air.</seg>
<seg id="621">The sum is God's voice in my ear.</seg>
<seg id="622">"and if you have a swamp, then you can not strive other than by size."</seg>
<seg id="623">"the feeling of being no different than seeking size, no matter what price."</seg>
<seg id="624">This is called summing.</seg>
<seg id="625">Or maybe it also means being a workaholic.</seg>
<seg id="626">08.11.2015 | Desperate Housewives</seg>
<seg id="627">Maybe it is ego.</seg>
<seg id="628">Perhaps it is the fear of a failure.</seg>
<seg id="629">I don't know.</seg>
<seg id="630">"I only know that I'm not made for failure, and I just know that I love the sums."</seg>
<seg id="631">"I just want to tell you, I'm a titanium, and I know that I don't want to question it."</seg>
<seg id="632">"the more successful I become, the more shows, the more episodes, the more work there are, the more things the more I write, the more I write history, the more my expectations are."</seg>
<seg id="633">"the more I work to be successful, the more I have to work."</seg>
<seg id="634">And what do I say about work?</seg>
<seg id="635">"I love working, not true?"</seg>
<seg id="636">"the land I created, the marathon, which I run, the army, the canvas, the high sound, the sums, the sums, the sums."</seg>
<seg id="637">I like this buzz. I love the buzz.</seg>
<seg id="638">I need the sums. I am the sum.</seg>
<seg id="639">Am I just this sum?</seg>
<seg id="640">And then the buzz stopped.</seg>
<seg id="641">"overhauled, overstressed, overdone."</seg>
<seg id="642">The totals stopped.</seg>
<seg id="643">"now, my three daughters are accustomed to the truth that their mum is a single working lifestyle."</seg>
<seg id="644">"Harper tells people:" "my mom won't be there, but you can write to my Nanny."</seg>
<seg id="645">"and Emerson says:" "kittens, I want to go to Shonda country."</seg>
<seg id="646">These are the children of a Titans.</seg>
<seg id="647">You are Baby Titans.</seg>
<seg id="648">"they were 12, 3 and 1 when the totals ceased."</seg>
<seg id="649">The humming of the engine was speechless.</seg>
<seg id="650">I didn't love my work anymore. the engine was out.</seg>
<seg id="651">The sums did not come back.</seg>
<seg id="652">My buzz was broken.</seg>
<seg id="653">"I did the same things as usual: the same Titans work, 15 hours-days, through-worked weekends, no regrets, nothing delegate, a titanium sleeps not, does not give up, with all heart, clear eyes, whatever."</seg>
<seg id="654">But there was no summing.</seg>
<seg id="655">In me was silence.</seg>
<seg id="656">"four TV programs, 70 hours, three productions at the same time, sometimes four."</seg>
<seg id="657">"four TV programs, 70 hours, three productions at the same time..."</seg>
<seg id="658">I was the perfect Titan.</seg>
<seg id="659">"I was a show-Titan,"</seg>
<seg id="660">"everything was gray, I just didn't have any fun anymore."</seg>
<seg id="661">And that was my life.</seg>
<seg id="662">Everything I did.</seg>
<seg id="663">I was the sum and the sums I was.</seg>
<seg id="664">"so what do you do if what you do, the work you love, suddenly fades?"</seg>
<seg id="665">"I know some may think:" "heul you out, stupid author-Titan."</seg>
<seg id="666">"but you know you do it, you do it, you work, one likes to be a teacher, a banker, a mother, a painter, Bill Gates, one likes to be a painter, a mother, and knows how the totals stops when the swamps stops, who is one then?"</seg>
<seg id="667">What are you?</seg>
<seg id="668">What am I?</seg>
<seg id="669">Am I still a Titan?</seg>
<seg id="670">"if the song of my heart stops, can I survive in silence?"</seg>
<seg id="671">And then my "southern waitress" asks me a question.</seg>
<seg id="672">"I'm on the way out, late and she says," "Mom, do you like to play?"</seg>
<seg id="673">"and I will say no, as two things are aware of me:"</seg>
<seg id="674">"first, I must say Yes to all and secondly, she called me not" kittens. ""</seg>
<seg id="675">"she does not call anyone" "kittens". ""</seg>
<seg id="676">When is this happening?</seg>
<seg id="677">"I miss it when I am Titan's and my buzz dries, and here everything changes in front of my own eyes."</seg>
<seg id="678">"and so she says," "Mom, do you like to play?"</seg>
<seg id="679">"and I say," Yes. ""</seg>
<seg id="680">There is nothing special about it.</seg>
<seg id="681">"we play and her sisters come across, we laugh a lot and I read quite dramatically from the book" Everybody Poops. ""</seg>
<seg id="682">Nothing extraordinary.</seg>
<seg id="683">"but it is outstanding because my pain and panic, in loneliness and lack of summing, I can't do anything except to watch out."</seg>
<seg id="684">I am focused.</seg>
<seg id="685">I am silent.</seg>
<seg id="686">"the land I created, the marathon, which I run, the army, the canvas, the high sound - they no longer exist."</seg>
<seg id="687">"everything that exists are sticky fingers and moist kisses, tender voices, wax crayons and the song in which it goes about letting go, or whatever the girl in" Die Eiskönigin "leaves."</seg>
<seg id="688">Everywhere is peace and simplicity.</seg>
<seg id="689">The air in this place is so tight that I can barely breathe.</seg>
<seg id="690">I can hardly believe that I breathe.</seg>
<seg id="691">Playing is the opposite of work.</seg>
<seg id="692">And I am happy.</seg>
<seg id="693">Something in me solves.</seg>
<seg id="694">A mental door goes up and an energy boost comes in.</seg>
<seg id="695">"and that's not immediately, but it happens, it happens."</seg>
<seg id="696">I feel it.</seg>
<seg id="697">The sums are slowly coming back.</seg>
<seg id="698">"no full volume, hardly there, it's silent, hardly audible, but it's there."</seg>
<seg id="699">"not the sums, but a sums."</seg>
<seg id="700">And now I feel as if I know a magical secret.</seg>
<seg id="701">But let's stay with the matter.</seg>
<seg id="702">It is love. that's all.</seg>
<seg id="703">No magic. no secret. only love.</seg>
<seg id="704">It is something we have forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="705">"the sums, the work sums, the titanic huts, this is just the replacement."</seg>
<seg id="706">"if I ask you who you are, if I tell you who I am, when I describe myself using broadcasts and TV hours and how functional my brain is, then I forgot what the real sum is."</seg>
<seg id="707">The sums are not strength and it is not labour-specific.</seg>
<seg id="708">It depends on the joy.</seg>
<seg id="709">True sums depend on love.</seg>
<seg id="710">"the sum is the current, which comes from the lust of life."</seg>
<seg id="711">True sums are self-confidence and peace.</seg>
<seg id="712">"true sums ignores the pressure of history, the tasks to be experienced, anticipation and pressure."</seg>
<seg id="713">The real buzz is simple and original.</seg>
<seg id="714">"true summing is God's voice in my ear, but perhaps God whispered the wrong words, for which God told me that I am a titanium?"</seg>
<seg id="715">It is just love.</seg>
<seg id="716">"we all need a bit more love, much more love."</seg>
<seg id="717">"as soon as my child wants to play with me, I will say yes."</seg>
<seg id="718">"I do this as a rule, so that I can free myself from any guilt as a workaholic."</seg>
<seg id="719">"it is law, I have no other choice. I have no other choice, unless I want to hear the sums."</seg>
<seg id="720">"I wish it would be that easy. I'm not good in playing, I don't like it."</seg>
<seg id="721">"to play is not enough, how to work."</seg>
<seg id="722">The truth hurts</seg>
<seg id="723">But I don't like to play it.</seg>
<seg id="724">I always work because I love it.</seg>
<seg id="725">I prefer to work at home than at home.</seg>
<seg id="726">"this concession is painful, because what kind of man does he prefer to be a house?"</seg>
<seg id="727">"well, I."</seg>
<seg id="728">"honestly, I call myself" Titan "--"</seg>
<seg id="729">I have to have problems.</seg>
<seg id="730">That I'm too relaxed is none of them.</seg>
<seg id="731">"we walk around in the garden, forward and forth, back and forth."</seg>
<seg id="732">"we do small dance parties,"</seg>
<seg id="733">We sing and play Ball.</seg>
<seg id="734">We burst soap bubbles.</seg>
<seg id="735">"I feel mainly steadfast, absent and confused."</seg>
<seg id="736">I always take my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="737">But it is OK.</seg>
<seg id="738">"my children show me how to live, and the summing of the universe fills me."</seg>
<seg id="739">I play and play until I ask myself: why have we ever stopped playing with the games?</seg>
<seg id="740">You can also say it! always say yes if your child wants to play with you.</seg>
<seg id="741">"perhaps you keep me naïve, for a daydream."</seg>
<seg id="742">"you probably have right, but you can do it too!"</seg>
<seg id="743">You have time!</seg>
<seg id="744">And do you know why? they are not Rihanna or a Muppet show character.</seg>
<seg id="745">Your child will find you less interesting than you think.</seg>
<seg id="746">There are only 15 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="747">"my little ones want to play with me at most 15 minutes, until they want to make something different."</seg>
<seg id="748">"it is wonderful 15 minutes, but just 15 minutes."</seg>
<seg id="749">After 15 minutes a ladybird or cookie replaces me.</seg>
<seg id="750">"and talking to me my teeny daughter for about 15 minutes, I am the mother of the year."</seg>
<seg id="751">"it is only 15 minutes, more it does not need."</seg>
<seg id="752">"everyone can take 15 minutes on the track, even at a bad mood day!"</seg>
<seg id="753">15 minutes per piece!</seg>
<seg id="754">"no cell phone, no linen, no distraction."</seg>
<seg id="755">"the day is short: dinner, the children are ready to play."</seg>
<seg id="756">But 15 minutes are inside!</seg>
<seg id="757">"my children are my feeliness, my world. it doesn't have to be the children. it's true to feel the sums to have a place for his soul peace."</seg>
<seg id="758">It's not about playing with your own children.</seg>
<seg id="759">"to play" "Play" "in general."</seg>
<seg id="760">Allow yourself the 15 minutes!</seg>
<seg id="761">Find out what you do well.</seg>
<seg id="762">Find out and preserve it.</seg>
<seg id="763">"I'm not perfect in it. I leave and I'm victed. meet friends, reading books, enjoying the day --"</seg>
<seg id="764">"want to play?" "is short for everything I have given up when I got my first TV show when I became a titanium in the training when I wanted to surpass myself more and more."</seg>
<seg id="765">"15 minutes on the track, why not treat yourself for 15 minutes?"</seg>
<seg id="766">What can be wrong about it? nothing!</seg>
<seg id="767">The sum came back in my spare time. the buzz seems to return if I am not working.</seg>
<seg id="768">Working does not work without games.</seg>
<seg id="769">"it takes time, but after a few months a door opens, the energy flows in and I find myself in my office again. I hear an unknown melody, it fills me and my soul."</seg>
<seg id="770">"I like the buzz, but I don't love it."</seg>
<seg id="771">I don't need it.</seg>
<seg id="772">"I am not the sum, the sums are not me... no more."</seg>
<seg id="773">"soap bubbles and sticky fingers, dinner with friends."</seg>
<seg id="774">This is my sum.</seg>
<seg id="775">The sums of life.</seg>
<seg id="776">The sums of love.</seg>
<seg id="777">"the sums of work are part of me, but only one part. and I am so grateful for that."</seg>
<seg id="778">"it's me that I'm a titanium. I have never seen a Titan, the trip to Jerusalem."</seg>
<seg id="779">I said yes to less work and to play more games.</seg>
<seg id="780">And yet I have everything under control. my brain is still working. my campfire is still burning.</seg>
<seg id="781">"the more I play, the happier I and my children."</seg>
<seg id="782">"the more I play, the more I feel as a good mother."</seg>
<seg id="783">"the more I play, the clearer is my head."</seg>
<seg id="784">"the more I play, the better I work."</seg>
<seg id="785">"the more I play, the more I hear the sums. the country I am creating, the marathon, which I run, the troops, the screens, the humming, the buzz, the other, the right sum: the sums of life."</seg>
<seg id="786">"the more I feel this buzz, the more this unusual, consistent, bare and new attitude makes me wide. less titanium -- more me!"</seg>
<seg id="787">"the more I feel this sum, the more I know who I am."</seg>
<seg id="788">"I am the author. I think of things, I raise you to life."</seg>
<seg id="789">"this is part of the job, which means living his dream."</seg>
<seg id="790">"this is the dream of this job,"</seg>
<seg id="791">Because a dream job should be a little dream.</seg>
<seg id="792">"I said" "Yes" "to less work and more games."</seg>
<seg id="793">Titans have no chance here.</seg>
<seg id="794">"do you want to play?"</seg>
<seg id="795">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="796">I am a neurosurgeon.</seg>
<seg id="797">"like most of my colleagues, I have to do every day with human tragedies."</seg>
<seg id="798">"I know how your life can change from one second to the other, after a severe stroke or after a car accident."</seg>
<seg id="799">"for us neurosurgeons, it is very frustrating that the brain, unlike other body organs, has a very low capacity for self-healing."</seg>
<seg id="800">"after a severe injury to the central nervous system, patients often have a permanent, severe disability."</seg>
<seg id="801">This is probably the reason why I became functional neurosurgeon.</seg>
<seg id="802">What is a functional neurosurgeon?</seg>
<seg id="803">A doctor who tries to improve the nerve functions by various surgical interventions.</seg>
<seg id="804">"surely they have heard of one of the most well-known, the" deep brain stimulation. "in this process, one implanted an electrode deep in the brain in order to influence the circuits of the neurons so that the neurological function is improved."</seg>
<seg id="805">It really is an amazing technology. it has improved the fate of patients suffering from Parkinson's disease who suffered from severe tremor and severe pain.</seg>
<seg id="806">"neuromodulation, however, does not mean neuro-healing."</seg>
<seg id="807">The dream of functional neurosurgeons is the restoration of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="808">"in my opinion, we approach this dream."</seg>
<seg id="809">I would like to show you that we are very close to it.</seg>
<seg id="810">"with some help, the brain can help itself."</seg>
<seg id="811">History began 15 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="812">At the time I was senior physician and worked day and night in emergency room.</seg>
<seg id="813">Often I provided patients with skull-brain trauma.</seg>
<seg id="814">They have to imagine that brain-brain trauma swells the brain and stimulates the skull pressure.</seg>
<seg id="815">"in order to save life, you have to reduce the pressure of the skull."</seg>
<seg id="816">"for this, sometimes one has to remove a part of swollen brain mass."</seg>
<seg id="817">"instead of throwing away the swollen brain mass, we decided to analyse the brain mass with Jean-François Brunet, one of my colleagues, a biologist."</seg>
<seg id="818">What do I mean by this?</seg>
<seg id="819">We wanted to grow cells out of this tissue.</seg>
<seg id="820">This is not an easy task.</seg>
<seg id="821">Being able to grow cells from a tissue piece is comparable to all small children that are taken out of your families.</seg>
<seg id="822">"you have to find the proper diet, temperature, humidity and environments to prosper."</seg>
<seg id="823">This is exactly what we had to do with these cells.</seg>
<seg id="824">After many attempts it made Jean-François.</seg>
<seg id="825">This he saw under his microscope.</seg>
<seg id="826">That was a big surprise for us.</seg>
<seg id="827">Why?</seg>
<seg id="828">"it looked like a stem cell culture. with large green cells, surrounded by small, unripe cells."</seg>
<seg id="829">"perhaps you still know from the biology lesson that stem cells are unripe cells, which can transform into any cell type of the organism."</seg>
<seg id="830">"the adult brain has stem cells, but very few. they are hidden in deep, small niches of the brain."</seg>
<seg id="831">It is surprising to receive this type of stem cells from the surface tissue of the brain mass in the surgery.</seg>
<seg id="832">We made another fascinating observation: normal stem cells are very active -- they share very quickly.</seg>
<seg id="833">They never die; they are immortal.</seg>
<seg id="834">But these cells behaved differently.</seg>
<seg id="835">They split slowly and after a few weeks they even died.</seg>
<seg id="836">"so we saw a new, weird cell population that looked like stem cells, but behaved differently."</seg>
<seg id="837">We needed a long time to understand where they came from.</seg>
<seg id="838">They come from these cells.</seg>
<seg id="839">These blue and red cells are called Doublecortin-positive cells.</seg>
<seg id="840">We all have them in our brain.</seg>
<seg id="841">They make 4% of our cerebral cortal cells.</seg>
<seg id="842">They play a very important role in our development.</seg>
<seg id="843">"in the fetus stage, they care for the folding of the brain."</seg>
<seg id="844">But why do they stay with us?</seg>
<seg id="845">We do not know this.</seg>
<seg id="846">"we believe that they take part in the healing of the brain, as we find it in higher concentrations close to brain injuries."</seg>
<seg id="847">"however, this is not so secure."</seg>
<seg id="848">"one thing is clear, however, -- from these cells we received our stem cells."</seg>
<seg id="849">"we are facing a potential cell source, which allows brain healing."</seg>
<seg id="850">That we had to prove.</seg>
<seg id="851">So we decided to develop an experiment.</seg>
<seg id="852">We wanted to take a piece of brain from the non-linguistic area and then cultivate the cells exactly as Jean-François did.</seg>
<seg id="853">"and then mark them in color, in order to be able to follow them in the brain."</seg>
<seg id="854">"in the last step, we planted them at the reception of the same individual."</seg>
<seg id="855">We call the autologist Transplantation -- Autotransplantation.</seg>
<seg id="856">One of our first questions was: what happens when we implant these cells into normal brain tissue? and what will happen if we planted the same cells in damaged brain tissue?</seg>
<seg id="857">"thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rouiller, we were able to work with apes."</seg>
<seg id="858">"in the first scenario, we planted the cells in a healthy brain, and we observed that they disappeared completely after a few weeks as if they were taken back, they go back home. the space is already occupied, they are not needed there, so they disappear."</seg>
<seg id="859">"in the second scenario, we added an injury and irritated exactly the same cells and now the cells remained intact -- they grew to mature neurons."</seg>
<seg id="860">Here you see what we could observe under the microscope.</seg>
<seg id="861">These are the cells that were irritated.</seg>
<seg id="862">"the evidence that they show are these little points. these are the cells we dyed in vitro, in culture."</seg>
<seg id="863">"here, of course, we could not stop."</seg>
<seg id="864">Do these cells also help a monkey to recover from a brain injury?</seg>
<seg id="865">So we trained monkeys with a manual dexterity task.</seg>
<seg id="866">They had to take feed pellets from a tray.</seg>
<seg id="867">They made them very good.</seg>

<seg id="869">"as a result, the monkeys were paralyzed, they could not move their hands any more."</seg>

<seg id="872">"when we were certain that the monkey had achieved his degree of spontaneous recovery, we implanted his own cells."</seg>
<seg id="873">"on the left hand side you see the monkey, who spontaneously recovered."</seg>
<seg id="874">It can provide about 40% to 50% of its original power from prior to injury.</seg>
<seg id="875">He is not so precise and not so fast.</seg>
<seg id="876">"now see when we planted the cells: the same monkey, two months after the rice plantation."</seg>
<seg id="877">I can tell you that were also very exciting results for us.</seg>
<seg id="878">"since that time, we have found a lot more about these cells."</seg>
<seg id="879">We can freeze and use them later.</seg>
<seg id="880">"we can use them in other neuropathological models, for example in Parkinson's disease."</seg>
<seg id="881">But our dream is still to implant them in humans.</seg>

<seg id="884">"Bruno Giussani: Jocelyne, that's wonderful, I'm sure that just now, several dozen people in the audience, perhaps even the majority, think:" I know someone who can need it. "</seg>
<seg id="885">I definitely.</seg>
<seg id="886">"of course, the question is what the biggest obstacles are before you can start clinical trials involving human beings."</seg>
<seg id="887">"Jocelyne Bloch: the biggest obstacles are the authorities. starting from these great results, one has to fill about two kilograms of papers and forms to pass through this kind of studies."</seg>
<seg id="888">"BG: this is understandable, the brain is very delicate, etc."</seg>
<seg id="889">"JB: yes, but it takes a long time, a lot of patience and an almost professional team."</seg>
<seg id="890">"BG: look into the future -- you have completed the research and tried to get permission to start the clinical trials. if you continue to look into the future, how many years it will take until someone can come to the hospital and this therapy will be available."</seg>
<seg id="891">JB: that's hard to say.</seg>
<seg id="892">"first, it depends on the approval of the clinical trial."</seg>
<seg id="893">Will the authority allow us to start it soon?</seg>
<seg id="894">Then you have to perform this study with a small group of patients.</seg>
<seg id="895">It takes a long time to select the patients to perform the treatments and evaluate whether it is useful to make this kind of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="896">"after that, it is necessary to apply this to a multi-centric study."</seg>

<seg id="901">Democracy.</seg>
<seg id="902">We in the West make a big mistake to consider them as self-evident.</seg>
<seg id="903">"we do not see democracy as the fragile plant it is in reality, but as an inventory of our society."</seg>
<seg id="904">We tend to look at them as unchangeable.</seg>
<seg id="905">We believe that capitalism inevitably leads to democracy.</seg>
<seg id="906">This is not true.</seg>
<seg id="907">Lee Kuan Yew from Singapore and his big imitators in Beijing have proved indubitably that it is quite possible to have a blooming capitalism and impressive growth while politics remains completely undemocratic.</seg>
<seg id="908">"in fact, democracy vanishes with us, in Europe."</seg>
<seg id="909">"at the beginning of the year, when I represented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- was unequivocally declared to me as finance minister in the Eurogroup, that the democratic process of our country -- our choices -- not the austerity programs that were realised in Greece."</seg>
<seg id="910">"at that moment, I thought that there could be no better justification for Lee Kuan Yew or the Communist Party of China, or some of my sincere friends who repeatedly said that democracy would be abolished if it would change anything."</seg>
<seg id="911">At this point I would like to introduce you an economic model for a real democracy.</seg>
<seg id="912">"I ask you, together with me, to believe that Lee Kuan Yew, the Communist Party of China and even the Eurogroup of an error, we could save democracy, but that we need a true and defensive democracy."</seg>
<seg id="913">"without democracy, our societies will be painted, our future gloomy and our great, new technologies are wasted."</seg>
<seg id="914">"on the subject of waste, I would like to point you to an interesting contradiction that currently threatens our economies."</seg>
<seg id="915">I call it the "twin summit paradox."</seg>
<seg id="916">"a top is known to you. you know and recognize him as the Schuldenberg, who casts his long shadow over the USA, Europe and the whole world."</seg>
<seg id="917">"we all recognize the debt mountain,"</seg>
<seg id="918">But few recognize his twin.</seg>
<seg id="919">"a mountain of unused cash, which belongs to the wealthy businessmen and corporations which, however, are too anxious to invest there where it would be productive and generate income by which one urgently needs to bear the debt of the debt and also produce all the things that humanity is urgently needed, for example" green "energy."</seg>
<seg id="920">I call them two numbers.</seg>
<seg id="921">"in the past 3 months, 3.4 trillion US dollars were invested in the United States, England and the eurozone, in all the prosperity producing goods, such as industrial plants, machines, office buildings, schools, roads, tracks, equipment and so on."</seg>
<seg id="922">"3.4 trillions of US dollars sound after a lot of money until it compares $5,1 trillion US dollars, which at the same time circulate in the same countries and our financial institutions, and absolutely nothing to blow out except the stock exchanges and apply the real estate prices."</seg>
<seg id="923">"thus debt and unproductive capital form the twin summit, which cannot be compensated by the usual market mechanisms."</seg>
<seg id="924">"the result is stagnating wages, more than a quarter of the 25-54 year-olds in the US, Japan and Europe unemployed, and consequently a low overall economic demand, which, as in a continuous loop, advocates the pessimism of investors who would not invest in which they do not invest."</seg>
<seg id="925">Involuntarily moves the circumstances that lead him to kill him.</seg>
<seg id="926">This is my brother with capitalism --</seg>
<seg id="927">"his exceedingly extravagant art. all the unproductive capital should be used to improve our lives, develop human talents, and to finance all the technologies," green "technologies, which are crucial to the salvation of the earth."</seg>
<seg id="928">So democracy is the solution?</seg>
<seg id="929">"but before we continue, what do we understand about democracy?"</seg>
<seg id="930">Aristotle defined democracy as the social form in which the open air and the poor as a majority control the government.</seg>
<seg id="931">"of course, Athenian democracy included too many --"</seg>
<seg id="932">"women, foreigners, and of course slaves."</seg>
<seg id="933">"however, it would be a mistake to reduce the significance of Athenian democracy because of these exclusions."</seg>
<seg id="934">"the decision on the Athenian democracy was and is that it withdrew the working poor, and not only gave them the right to freedom of expression, but more important and decisive for them to grant them the right to political co-determination with the same moods in matters of the state."</seg>
<seg id="935">The Athenian democracy has not long held --</seg>
<seg id="936">"like a candle that shines brightly, it is also quickly burned."</seg>
<seg id="937">"however, our present-day liberal democracies have not rooted their roots in ancient Athens,"</seg>
<seg id="938">"but in the Magna Carta, in the glorious Revolution of 1688, even in the American Constitution."</seg>
<seg id="939">"while the Athenian democracy concentrated on free citizens and strengthened the working poor, our liberal democracy is based on the values of the Magna Carta, which ultimately was a statute for rulers."</seg>
<seg id="940">"for the liberal democracy came only when a complete separation of politics and economy was possible and the democratic process was limited to politics, while the economy -- i.e. the world of corporations -- was a democratic zone."</seg>
<seg id="941">"in our present democracies, since the time this separation of politics and economy began, a relentless struggle between the two is taking place by gradually undermining politics and depriving them."</seg>
<seg id="942">Do you wonder why politicians are no longer the same as before?</seg>
<seg id="943">It is not at a degeneration of its DNA.</seg>
<seg id="944">"it is because you can be in the government today, and still not in power, because the power is diverted from politics into the economy and the areas are separated."</seg>
<seg id="945">I mentioned my brother with capitalism.</seg>
<seg id="946">"if you think about it, it is like a herd of predators that sustains the animals of which it feeds them, decimated that they are starved at the end."</seg>
<seg id="947">"it is similar to the economy that has cannibalized politics in such a way that it is self-caused by the self-created economic crisis. the power of the corporations grows, political estates are being exploited, the inequality is rising, the economic demand falls and the directors of the corporations are too frightened to invest the cash of their companies."</seg>
<seg id="948">"the more successful capitalism distributes the" Demos "out of democracy, the higher the twin summit, and the greater the waste of human labour power and prosperity of humanity."</seg>
<seg id="949">"if this is true, it is obvious that we have to bring together politics and the economy and it would be better if the" demos "retains control, as in ancient Athens, apart from the exclusion of slaves, women and foreigners."</seg>
<seg id="950">"by the way, this is not a new idea."</seg>
<seg id="951">The Marxist left had this idea 100 years ago and it was not very good.</seg>
<seg id="952">"the doctrine of the deacal of the Soviet Union should be that the working poor only regain a position as in ancient Athens, without creating new forms of brutality and waste."</seg>
<seg id="953">But there is one solution: to abolish the working poor!</seg>
<seg id="954">Capitalism does it by replacing low-wage employees by automation and robots.</seg>
<seg id="955">"the problem is, as long as economy and politics are separate areas, automation makes the twin summit higher, wasting wasting, and social conflicts lower, just as I believe -- in countries like China."</seg>
<seg id="956">"so we must redesign the economy and reunite the areas of business and politics, and make sure that we democratize the reunified area, otherwise we end in a pathological surveillance hyperautocracy, which makes the film" "Matrix" "as a documentary."</seg>
<seg id="957">"the question is not, therefore, whether capitalism will survive the technical achievements that it has produced --"</seg>
<seg id="958">"the most interesting question is whether capitalism is replaced by a dystopia, similar to the" Matrix, "or something similar to the" Star Trek "society, in which machines serve men and people can put their energy into the study of the universe, or in a high-tech version of the ancient Athener" Agora, "in long discussions the meaning of life."</seg>
<seg id="959">I think we must be optimistic.</seg>
<seg id="960">So what would it look like to have this "Star Trek" like utopia instead of the "Matrix" similar dystopia?</seg>
<seg id="961">"in practical implementation, I would like to give you some examples in brief."</seg>
<seg id="962">"in the area of companies: please introduce a capital market where you earn money while working and in which your capital follows you from one office to the next, from one company to the next, and the company -- no matter in which one is currently working -- is the property of those who are currently working in the company."</seg>
<seg id="963">"then all income from capital and redeeming, and the concept of wage labour, is completely overhauled."</seg>
<seg id="964">"no distinction between those who belong to the company, but they do not work in it, and employees who work there that the company does not belong to. no exchange between capital and labour, no large gaps between investment and savings, and ultimately no formidable twin summit."</seg>
<seg id="965">"in the field of global political economy: just imagine that our national currencies would have a free fluctuating exchange rate, in a universal, global, digital currency, which is issued by the IMF [International Monetary Fund], and the G-20 [group of the 20 largest emerging countries], in the interest of all of humanity."</seg>
<seg id="966">"imagine that the entire world trade in this currency is traded -- we call it" "the cosmos", "in units of" "cosmos" "-- and every government pays the sum that corresponds to the trade deficit or the trade surplus of the respective country into a common fund."</seg>
<seg id="967">"imagine that this fund invests in" green "technologies, especially in parts of the world where investment funds are rare."</seg>
<seg id="968">This is not a new idea.</seg>
<seg id="969">It is basically what John Maynard Keynes had proposed in the Bretton Woods Conference in 1944.</seg>
<seg id="970">The problem was that at that time it was not the technical means to implement it.</seg>
<seg id="971">"today, we have them, particularly against the background of a reunited politics and economy."</seg>
<seg id="972">"the world I describe to you is at the same time liberal in which it favours privileged individuals, and Marxist because it is buried in the separation of capital and labour in the rubbish of history, and Keynesian, globally keynesiastical."</seg>
<seg id="973">"but above all, it is a world in which we can imagine a real democracy."</seg>
<seg id="974">Will we wake up in such a world</seg>
<seg id="975">Or will we sink into a "matrix" - similar dystrophy?</seg>
<seg id="976">The answer depends on how we decide together politically.</seg>
<seg id="977">"it is in our hands, and we do it better democratic."</seg>
<seg id="978">Thanks.</seg>
<seg id="979">Bruno Giussani: Yanis...</seg>
<seg id="980">You write yourself as libertarian Marxists in your biography.</seg>

<seg id="982">"Yanis Varoufakis: if any of what I have just said is relevant, then Marx is relevant."</seg>
<seg id="983">"the reason for the reunification of politics and economy is... Do we not do it, technological development will generate such a massive decline in macroeconomic demand, which is called Larry Summers as a" long-term stagnation. ""</seg>
<seg id="984">"by transferring this crisis from one part of Earth to the next one, as we experience it, it will not only destabilise our democracies but also the countries whose interest in liberal democracy is low."</seg>
<seg id="985">"if this analysis is true, then Marx is quite relevant,"</seg>
<seg id="986">"just as Hayek, that is why I am a libertarian Marxist, and like Keynes, and so I am also perfect."</seg>

BG: in your lecture you mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday at the dinner of the speakers you told you very clearly what to keep you from the West's point of view."</seg>
<seg id="990">Would you like to repeat it here?</seg>
<seg id="991">YV: there is a great deal of hypocrisy.</seg>
<seg id="992">"in our liberal democracies, we have the impression of democracy."</seg>
<seg id="993">"as I said in my lecture, we have limited democracy to politics, while the area where most of the world plays, -- the area of economy -- is a completely democratic zone."</seg>
<seg id="994">"in some respects, if I may say so provocative, China resembles the England of the 19th century."</seg>
<seg id="995">"for -- remember -- we tend to link liberalism with democracy -- that is a mistake, historically considered."</seg>
<seg id="996">"liberalism, Liberals, like John Stuart Mill --"</seg>
<seg id="997">He was particularly sceptical about the democratic development.</seg>
<seg id="998">"what one can watch in China now is similar to the development we had in England during the industrial revolution, especially the transition from the first to the second."</seg>
<seg id="999">"to present China now, to do what the West itself has done in the 19th century, smells huge according to hypocrisy."</seg>
<seg id="1000">BG: I am sure that many listeners are curious about their experiences as Greece's finance minister in the beginning of the year.</seg>
<seg id="1001">YV: I realized that this is coming.</seg>
<seg id="1002">BG: yes...</seg>
<seg id="1003">How do you look back six months later on the first half-year?</seg>
<seg id="1004">"YV: very exciting, from personal visibility, and very disappointing because we had the opportunity to start with the eurozone a new beginning,"</seg>
<seg id="1005">"not only Greece, but the Eurozone,"</seg>
<seg id="1006">"namely, to say goodbye to the complacency and the continual denial that a massive distribution line went through the eurozone, and continues to be massively threatened by the development of the whole European Union."</seg>
<seg id="1007">"we had the opportunity, based on the Greek proposal -- which, by the way, was the first suggestion that revealed this denial --"</seg>
<seg id="1008">"unfortunately, the powers within the eurozone, within the European group, have chosen to deny the denial."</seg>
<seg id="1009">"but you know, what is coming."</seg>
<seg id="1010">This is the experience of the Soviet Union --</seg>
<seg id="1011">"if you try to get an economic system that is not viable, through political will and authoritarianism in life, you might be able to delay it for a while, but when the change occurs, it happens abruptly and destructive."</seg>

<seg id="1013">"YV: there is no doubt that the eurozone has no future, if we do not change its construction."</seg>

<seg id="1016">BG: for example? YV: everyone who looks back -- seriousness...</seg>
<seg id="1017">"if there is a finance minister, or any minister, who after 6 months in office, especially in such a tense situation, says he has no mistake, then it is a dangerous person."</seg>
<seg id="1018">"of course, I made mistakes."</seg>
<seg id="1019">The biggest mistake was to sign the application for the extension of the Schulden Programme at the end of February.</seg>

<seg id="1038">"most people have never heard of Roy Price, although it is probably responsible for 22 moderate minutes of your life on April 19, 2013."</seg>
<seg id="1039">Probably also for 22 very entertaining minutes but not for very many of you.</seg>
<seg id="1040">That goes back to the decision that Roy met three years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1041">"Roy Price is the lead employee at Amazon Studios,"</seg>
<seg id="1042">The TV production company from Amazon.</seg>
<seg id="1043">"he is 47 years old, slim, has a hedgehog and describes itself on Twitter as" films, TV, technology, tacos. ""</seg>
<seg id="1044">Roy has a very important job because he is responsible for making the shows and contents to produce the Amazon.</seg>
<seg id="1045">"of course, this is a very hard-fought industry."</seg>
<seg id="1046">There are so many TV shows that Roy wouldn't be able to choose any one.</seg>
<seg id="1047">"he must find shows, which are very, very good."</seg>
<seg id="1048">"in other words, he must find shows that are at the very right of this turn."</seg>
<seg id="1049">This curve is the evaluation allocation of more than 2500 TV series on the IMDB website. the evaluation goes from 1 to 10 and the height shows how many shows this review is received.</seg>
<seg id="1050">"if your show is valued at nine and above, this is a winner."</seg>
<seg id="1051">Then you have a successful show.</seg>
<seg id="1052">"they are shows like" Breaking Bad, "" Game of Thrones, "" The Wire "-- all the shows that are addictive, where, after having watched a season, your brain asks," Where are there more of these episodes? "</seg>
<seg id="1053">This kind of show.</seg>
<seg id="1054">"on the left side, here at this end, shows like" Toddlers and Tiaras "-- -- that should tell you enough what is going on at that end of the curve."</seg>
<seg id="1055">"Roy Price doesn't worry about getting on the left side of the curve, because I think you need special intelligence to offer" Toddlers and Tiaras. ""</seg>
<seg id="1056">"he makes more thoughts about the average payout, average television -- the shows that are neither good nor bad, they simply don't excite."</seg>
<seg id="1057">So he must make sure that he is really on the right side.</seg>
<seg id="1058">"the pressure is present, and of course it's the first time Amazon is doing something, so Roy Price doesn't want to risk anything."</seg>
<seg id="1059">He wants to create successes.</seg>
<seg id="1060">"he needs guaranteed success, so he holds a competition."</seg>
<seg id="1061">"he takes many ideas for TV shows and chooses eight candidates for TV shows, then he produces the first episode of each of these shows and puts them online, where they can be viewed free of charge."</seg>
<seg id="1062">"and if Amazon leaves things in vain, do you pick up right?"</seg>
<seg id="1063">Millions of spectators are watching these episodes.</seg>
<seg id="1064">"however, they don't know that they are watching watching these shows."</seg>
<seg id="1065">They are observed by Roy and his team who record everything.</seg>
<seg id="1066">"you collect when you start the show, when you are paused, which parts you skip or check again."</seg>
<seg id="1067">They collect millions of data to decide with these data then which show they should produce.</seg>
<seg id="1068">"in fact, they collect the data, process them and this results in the answer, and this is:" Amazon should make a Sitcom about four Republican US senators. "</seg>
<seg id="1069">They made this show.</seg>
<seg id="1070">Does anybody know the name of this show?</seg>
<seg id="1071">"yes," Alpha House, "but it seems that not many can remember this show because it wasn't so good."</seg>
<seg id="1072">"it is just an average show -- in the truest sense of the word -- as the average of this curve is 7,4 and Alpha House lands at 7,5 -- i.e. something above average, but not exactly what Roy and his team worked."</seg>
<seg id="1073">"at the same time, another manager has placed a top show through data analysis. his name is Ted, Ted Sarandos, the manager for programming of Netflix. just like Roy, he is always looking to find this a super show and he also uses data for it, but it makes it a bit different."</seg>
<seg id="1074">"instead of organizing a contest, he and his team looked at the available data about the Netflix spectators, so the reviews they give the shows, their course, which shows they like, etc."</seg>
<seg id="1075">"then they use this data to find out these little details about the audience: which shows they like, which producers, which actors."</seg>
<seg id="1076">"when they had all the pieces together they entered a wagon and decided not to make a Sitcom via four senators, but a drama series about a senator."</seg>
<seg id="1077">Do you know this show?</seg>
<seg id="1078">"yes," House of Cards. "Netflix has landed a hit, at least for the first two seasons."</seg>
<seg id="1079">"house of Cards" gets a 9,1 rating on this curve. so exactly where they wanted. "</seg>
<seg id="1080">"of course, the question is: what happened here?"</seg>
<seg id="1081">"one has two very competitive, data sealed companies."</seg>
<seg id="1082">They connect these many data together and it works great for one of them but not for the other company.</seg>
<seg id="1083">What is this?</seg>
<seg id="1084">Because logic somehow states that this should work in all.</seg>
<seg id="1085">"if you collect millions of data, for a decision you meet, you should make a good decision."</seg>
<seg id="1086">You have 200 years of statistics as back-up.</seg>
<seg id="1087">You optimize it by very powerful computers.</seg>
<seg id="1088">"the least what you can expect is good TV, or?"</seg>
<seg id="1089">"if data analysis does not work, this is a bit scary because we live in a time in which we take more and more statistics to make serious decisions, far beyond television."</seg>
<seg id="1090">Does someone here know the company Multi-Health Systems?</seg>
<seg id="1091">"no one. OK, that's even good."</seg>
<seg id="1092">"multi-Health Systems is a software company and I hope that no one ever comes into contact with this software in touch with this software. come into contact, you are in prison."</seg>
<seg id="1093">"if someone is in prison here in the United States and asks for dismissal, it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine whether a discharge occurs or not."</seg>
<seg id="1094">"just like Amazon and Netflix. but instead of deciding whether a show will be good or bad, it's decided whether a person will be good or bad."</seg>
<seg id="1095">"moderate TV, 22 minutes, that can be really bad, but even more years in prison are worse."</seg>
<seg id="1096">"unfortunately, there is evidence that this data analysis, despite the many data,"</seg>
<seg id="1097">Not always the best results are generated. this is not because a company like Multi-Health Systems does not know how to use data.</seg>
<seg id="1098">Even the data of the most sealed companies are wrong.</seg>
<seg id="1099">"yes, even Google sometimes makes mistakes."</seg>
<seg id="1100">"in 2009, Google announced that through data analysis outbreaks of influenza, the worse kind can be predicted -- through data analysis of Google searches."</seg>
<seg id="1101">It worked wonderfully and was a great news sensation. the success culminated in a publication in the journal Nature.</seg>
<seg id="1102">"it worked perfectly, year by year, until it suddenly didn't work anymore,"</seg>
<seg id="1103">And no one could say why.</seg>
<seg id="1104">"it simply didn't work, this was once again a sensation, including the revocation of publication in the" Nature. ""</seg>
<seg id="1105">Even the data of sealed companies such as Amazon and Google sometimes misunderstand something.</seg>
<seg id="1106">"despite all these errors, data flow in decisions of life - at the workplace, in the case of legal enforcement, in medicine."</seg>
<seg id="1107">So we should rather make sure that data are helpful.</seg>
<seg id="1108">I also know many difficulties with data. I work in computer aided genetics -- an area where some very clever people unimaginably use many data to make serious decisions as the decision for a cancer therapy</seg>
<seg id="1109">Or the development of a drug. over the years I have recognized some patterns on the difference between successful decisions based on data and not successful decisions. this pattern should be spread.</seg>
<seg id="1110">"if you need to solve a complex problem, you basically do two things:"</seg>
<seg id="1111">"first, put this problem into its parts, so that you can analyse the items; as a second, you put the items together to hold a resolution."</seg>
<seg id="1112">Sometimes you have to do this several times but there are always two things: take apart and put together again.</seg>
<seg id="1113">And now the most important: data and data analysis are only good for the first part.</seg>
<seg id="1114">"data and data analysis, no matter how powerful, can only help to dismantle a problem and to understand its parts."</seg>
<seg id="1115">They are not suitable to assemble the parts again and then come to a resolution.</seg>
<seg id="1116">For that there is another tool and we all have it all: our brain.</seg>
<seg id="1117">"if there is something in which the brain is good, it is important to recompose parts and pieces, even if the information is incomplete, in order to get a good decision -- especially if it is the brain of an expert."</seg>
<seg id="1118">"therefore, I believe, Netflix was so successful because they have used data and intellect where they are also part of the process."</seg>
<seg id="1119">"they use data to better understand their audience, what they would otherwise have not been able to do. but the decision on how to take all these parts and make a show like" House of Cards, "that was not in the data."</seg>
<seg id="1120">"Ted Sarandos and his team made this decision for this show, which meant they had a great personal risk with this decision."</seg>
<seg id="1121">Amazon however did this in the wrong way.</seg>
<seg id="1122">"they used data to control all their decisions, first when they were competing for TV ideas, then chose" Alpha House "as a show."</seg>
<seg id="1123">"it was a safe decision, because they could always say:" "they tell us the data."</seg>
<seg id="1124">It did not lead to the desired result.</seg>
<seg id="1125">"data is helpful for better decisions, but I think things go wrong when data start to control our decisions."</seg>
<seg id="1126">"no matter how powerful they are, data are just a tool and to not forget it, this device is quite useful."</seg>
<seg id="1127">Many of you will...</seg>
<seg id="1128">"before there was data, this was the device for decisions."</seg>
<seg id="1129">Many know it.</seg>
<seg id="1130">It's also called "Magic 8 Ball." it's amazing. for decisions using a Ja- or No-Question you just have to shake the ball to get an answer. "most likely" -- right here at this moment.</seg>
<seg id="1131">I will fuse it later with a technique demo.</seg>
<seg id="1132">"so far I have made some decisions in my life, whereby I should have listened to the ball in the afterward."</seg>
<seg id="1133">"but, as you naturally know, if you have the data available, you want to replace them with a much broader web analysis, such as data analysis to make better choices."</seg>
<seg id="1134">But this does not change the basic structure.</seg>
<seg id="1135">"so perhaps the ball is wiser and wiser and wiser. ultimately, it's up to us to make decisions when we want to reach something extraordinary at the end of the right turn."</seg>
<seg id="1136">"and I feel this as a very encouraging message that despite the great amount of data still pays off, making decisions, to be an expert in what you do, and take risks."</seg>
<seg id="1137">"because in the end, it is not the data, but the risks that you end up at the right end of the curve."</seg>
<seg id="1138">Thank you.</seg>
