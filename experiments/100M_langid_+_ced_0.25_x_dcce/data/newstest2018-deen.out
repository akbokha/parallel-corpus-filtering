Munich 18@@ 56 : four maps that change your view of the city
&quot; an Ir@@ ren @-@ An@@ st@@ alt , where you@@ ths should meet today . &quot;
&quot; a cryp@@ t chapel , where it is now excav@@ ated for the S @-@ Bahn tun@@ nels . &quot;
Klein@@ g@@ är@@ tner manage the former cause of farmers .
the oldest official card of Munich supports exciting stories for days .
it gets nervous if maps are not up @-@ to @-@ date .
&quot; everybody knows everybody who had to be exciting , because the car @-@ Nav@@ i took place in a green meadow instead of a b@@ ypass road . &quot;
&quot; the historical maps of the digital Bayern @-@ Atlas , an offer of the Ge@@ op@@ ort@@ al Bavaria of the state government , are anything but up @-@ to @-@ date - but therefore very revealing . &quot;
especially if you compare them with current online maps .
then it becomes clear how cities and communities have changed in the spread @-@ area of the Munich Merk@@ ur since the 19th century .
&quot; the digital Bayern @-@ Atlas is a pat@@ ch@@ work carpet , which is not recognized as such . &quot;
&quot; in the large picture postcard , more detailed maps , so @-@ called &quot; &quot; Ur@@ posi@@ bilities &quot; , &quot; were incorporated for cities and congreg@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; according to the Bay@@ er@@ ischer junction , these were created between 18@@ 10 and 18@@ 64 and originate from Bavaria &apos;s first sur@@ veying . &quot;
your client : Napoleon .
&quot; since the spring of 1800 , the French army leader occupied Bavaria during the Second Coalition War with Austria . &quot;
Napoleon wanted an overview of the occupied country and gave a top@@ ographical survey of Bavaria within order - of course for military purposes .
&quot; even if the French troops finally departed with the peace of Lun@@ é@@ ville on February 9 , 18@@ 01 : today &apos;s neighbors , who created the idea of an area @-@ wide Bavaria card . &quot;
&quot; Elec@@ tor Max IV . Joseph drove the project forward , founded the &quot; Top@@ ographic Bureau &quot; - and thus the Bavarian Sur@@ veying Management . &quot;
the original composition for Munich dates back to 18@@ 56 and is like all other on the website of the Bavarian State Library .
the comparison of earlier / today is the most impressive example of the state capital .
the city has expanded in all directions and has grown together .
&quot; one example of this is Unter@@ sen@@ d@@ ling , which appears relatively isolated in the map of 18@@ 56 . &quot;
&quot; S@@ end@@ ling was founded 21 years after the creation of the map , so 1877 , as a Munich district . &quot;
today Unter@@ sen@@ d@@ ling is located in the middle of the city .
&quot; the houses of Unter@@ sen@@ d@@ lings focus around 18@@ 56 along the present Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser@@ strasse , which was named after George Sebastian Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser in 1878 , a leader of the insur@@ gency of the Bavarian peasants against Austria in 17@@ 05 . &quot;
&quot; where today the West@@ park is , one sees nothing but fields - at first glance : when zo@@ oming a smaller card with dozens of lines and numbers appears : hand@@ written numbered fl@@ utes from the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; ur@@ anium &quot; &quot; from which the land tax was deduc@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; small plots there are no farmers there today - but small gar@@ den@@ ers of the plant &quot; &quot; Land in Sonne &quot; . &quot; &quot;
a large green area is located north of Unter@@ sen@@ d@@ ling .
&quot; Ther@@ esi@@ en@@ wi@@ ese , since 18@@ 10 scene of the October test , was in fact a meadow in the 19th century - and no concrete desert . &quot;
on the other side of the Is@@ ar the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiat@@ ric medicine .
&quot; in the area of today &apos;s district Au @-@ Hai@@ d@@ hausen , one reads not only the street name &quot; &quot; at Gast@@ eig &quot; &quot; or from the height &quot; &quot; On the air &quot; &quot; - but also in large letters &quot; &quot; Ir@@ ren An@@ st@@ alt &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; yes , here at Au@@ er@@ feld@@ straße one once locked people with ma@@ dness . &quot;
&quot; there was 18@@ 58 / 59 the Munich circle @-@ irrig@@ ation system &quot; Auf der Au@@ er Lü@@ fte &quot; ( &quot; &quot; Au@@ er Lü@@ fte &quot; &quot; ) . &quot;
&quot; from 1872 , Dr. Bernhard von Gu@@ dden has led the establishment of the psychiat@@ rist who is brought to the death of King Ludwig II in connection with the death of King Ludwig II . &quot;
&quot; he was advanced for his time and , for example , ended the accus@@ ations of the so @-@ called Irish . &quot;
&quot; he also instruc@@ ted the staff to use force against the occup@@ ants , &quot; says Hermann Wilhelm , head of the Hai@@ d@@ hausen Museum , who occupied an exhibition with the institution . &quot;
&quot; for 280 patients was first place , later it was extended to 500 places . &quot;
&quot; at some point , this capacity was no longer sufficient - the reason for the construction of the Krei@@ si@@ r@@ ren@@ splatz in hair 1905 . &quot;
&quot; since 2006 , the Is@@ ar @-@ Amp@@ er @-@ Klin@@ ikum Munich @-@ Ost , one of Germany &apos;s largest psychiat@@ ri@@ sts . &quot;
&quot; on the area of the former Au@@ er An@@ st@@ alt , young people now meet at the Sal@@ esi@@ an@@ um in Munich . &quot;
the Order war@@ med the building complex in 1920 and converted it into a youth home with tra@@ inees .
&quot; West is the football field of the T@@ SV Munich east , east of residential buildings from the 1980s . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 the children &apos;s house &quot; &quot; Casa Don Bos@@ co &quot; &quot; was built in an architectural style reminis@@ cent of the origins of the Ir@@ ren@@ splatz , which had been destroyed during the Second World War in bom@@ bing attacks . &quot;
&quot; the Mari@@ en@@ platz was listed as &quot; &quot; main square &quot; &quot; in 18@@ 56 , the Kauf@@ ing@@ erst@@ raße was called &quot; Kauf@@ inger alley . &quot; &quot;
the Second World War also brought a decisive change in the heart of Munich .
the Al@@ lies seized many holes in the city centre in December 1944 .
a big stayed until today - at the Mari@@ enhof .
&quot; the English Institute , small business houses and a cryp@@ t from the Middle Ages were once at the Mari@@ enhof where these days were the preliminary work and on April 5 , 2017 the ground@@ breaking ceremony for the second S @-@ Bahn clan . &quot;
&quot; with the slider , the old Munich @-@ card can be compared with the aerial view of today - and fill the hole at the Mari@@ enhof . &quot;
civil rights group publishes travel warning for Mis@@ sour@@ i
the National Association for the Promotion of Col@@ ours has issued a warning for coloured people who travel to Mis@@ sour@@ i due to discri@@ min@@ atory politics and rac@@ ist attacks .
&quot; the NA@@ AC@@ P Travel Advisory for the Federal State of Mis@@ sour@@ i , which is to enter into force until 28 August 2017 , calls for af@@ ro @-@ American travelers , visitors and Mis@@ sour@@ i@@ ans to take special attention while travelling through the state , as a series of question@@ able , rapid @-@ based incidents in recent times exist throughout the state and be noted here , &quot; says it in the opinion of the group . &quot;
&quot; a recently adopted Act of Mis@@ sour@@ i that makes people more difficult to win discri@@ min@@ atory deposits , as well as the law enforcement agencies of the state that disp@@ rop@@ or@@ tion@@ ate to minorities , promp@@ ted the group to issue travel warning , said the NA@@ AC@@ P . &quot;
they have bre@@ aches of civil rights that happen to people .
&quot; they are stopped because of their skin color , they are beaten or killed , &quot; &quot; said the president of the Mis@@ sour@@ i NA@@ AC@@ P , Rod Chapel , the K@@ ans@@ as City Star . &quot;
we hear dis@@ comfort in such a frequency that we haven &apos;t heard yet .
it is the first such warning issued by the Organization for a State in the United States .
&quot; the group cited incidents such as rac@@ ist crime against black students at the University of Mis@@ sour@@ i and the death of T@@ ory S@@ anders , 28 , a black man from Tenn@@ es@@ see . &quot;
&quot; S@@ anders died under question@@ able circumstances at the beginning of the year after he had no more fuel during the trip and was taken into custo@@ dy by the police of Mis@@ sour@@ i , without being accused of a crime . &quot;
&quot; the Council also points out a recent report by the Mis@@ sour@@ i General Public Prosec@@ utor &apos;s Office , which is shown that black drivers in the state are held 75 percent more frequently than wh@@ ites . &quot;
&quot; the recommendation is that people are aware and inform their families , friends and staff about what might happen in Mis@@ sour@@ i , &quot; &quot; said Chapel . &quot;
people need to be ready to bring the money or let their relatives know that they travel through the state .
&quot; Mis@@ sour@@ i recorded 100 hate crimes in 2015 , according to the latest figures from the F@@ BI &apos;s hate crime report , which ranks the state with regard to the number of such injuries to the 16th position of the country . &quot;
the travel alert is also an answer to a new Mis@@ sour@@ i law that would make it harder to acc@@ use a company because of housing or employment discrimination .
&quot; prior to that , the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union ( AC@@ L@@ U ) had issued travel war@@ nings for Texas and Arizona , after the States forced immigration laws to arrest people for immigration violations , which will contribute to further racial profil@@ ing in view of AC@@ L@@ U . &quot;
&quot; travel war@@ nings are usually issued by the State Department for other countries , but lat@@ ely , interest groups have used the measure as a response to certain laws and trends within the United States . &quot;
fence project is elementary
the Fischer@@ bacher Wei@@ dez@@ au@@ n project is a success project and will be continued next year .
the CD@@ U Bundestag members Peter Weiß and K@@ ord@@ ula K@@ ov@@ ac got a picture on site .
&quot; at the court yard of the Schwen@@ de@@ mann family , representatives of the Fischer@@ bacher CD@@ U local association met with mayor Thomas Schneider and the two de@@ pu@@ ties . &quot;
&quot; Markus Schwen@@ de@@ mann first gave an insight into his farm in which he cultivated 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest , 40 dairy cows and as many young animals and accom@@ o@@ date in five apartments Feri@@ eng@@ es . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; &quot; Black Forest &quot; &quot; is for him the alternative marketing path for the milk of his cows , so Schwen@@ de@@ mann . &quot;
on the table of the holiday house is exclusively regional .
&quot; as he is also BL@@ HV chairman of Fischer@@ bach , he described the fence project as &quot; elementary important . &quot; &quot;
I cannot profitable on such steep faces .
&quot; the gr@@ ass@@ land area care for a lot of work , much needed to be worked with the brus@@ h@@ cutter . &quot;
&quot; we have to fight with the conditions and the top@@ ography , &quot; said Schwen@@ de@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; in 2003 , he took over the el@@ event@@ h operation and managed it without chemical plant protection and fertili@@ zer , even if it does not lead to bio@@ fuel . &quot;
&quot; for mayor Thomas Schneider , it was clear : &quot; the Commun@@ e recognized the importance of the fence project and is happy about the leader promotion . &quot;
&quot; at the cost of 3,000 to 4,000 euros per hect@@ are the farmers would have to be supported . &quot;
I hope that the re@@ for@@ estation of the areas could be drawn up for quite a while .
&quot; the greatest treasure that we have is the people who work in agriculture and make thoughts about how they continue their operations , &quot; &quot; said the mayor . &quot;
farmers are often in criticism because of the promotion
&quot; in 2013 , a total of 25 plots of eleven participants were f@@ enced . &quot;
&quot; the exhibition area covers 40 hectares , which may not be for@@ warded until at least 2023 . &quot;
&quot; half of the total cost of 71 500 euros was funded by half of the leaders , a quarter contributed to the municipality of Fischer@@ bach . &quot;
&quot; thus , the farmers remained 12 610 euros , which they had to invest in 16.@@ 2 kilometers of electric fence . &quot;
&quot; the big advantage is the lon@@ ge@@ vity of the f@@ ences , &quot; explained Schwen@@ de@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; K@@ ord@@ ula K@@ ov@@ ac stressed : &quot; you do a really good job , without farmers and land@@ lady do not go . &quot;
also for Peter White stand firm : &quot; best foods are produced here . &quot;
the Land@@ scape Directive ( L@@ PR ) Baden @-@ Württemberg allows state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ art extraction of soft @-@ f@@ ences .
the goal is the holding position of the Black Forest .
the assumption of full take @-@ up tends to exagger@@ ate the simul@@ ated increase in cas@@ elo@@ ads and fiscal costs of a social policy reform .
&quot; in addition , the f@@ enced area must not be tow@@ able ( slope of over 35 percent ) and must therefore be threatened by the for@@ estation . &quot;
&quot; for the 2018 fisher@@ man &apos;s electric fence project 2018 , the application of eight participants with 24 plots , which would like to build just under 16 kilometres of fence . &quot;
&quot; the exhibition area corresponds to 35 hectares , which are calculated at more than 112 000 euros . &quot;
is nothing holy ?
the White House of Tr@@ ump is now taking the statue of Liberty
the saf@@ est sign of a regime change is when they begin to attack statues .
the Americans appreciated this as well as any other - hence the carefully staged down@@ fall of Saddam Hussein at the Fir@@ dos square in Bag@@ h@@ dad in 2003 .
&quot; Stephen Miller , one of the key ide@@ ologists of the Tr@@ ump regime , certainly knew what he did when he took a symbolic ax@@ e in a heated quar@@ rel with Jim A@@ co@@ sta of CN@@ N on the proposals of the President for the dr@@ astic restriction of legal immigration with the Statue of Liberty . &quot;
&quot; to remain fair , Miller did not attack the statue itself . &quot;
a hor@@ de of boat owners and Liberty I@@ mit@@ ators would have landed him if he had done it .
&quot; but he took their meaning , and in particular the importance which you were attributed to when the famous poem by Emma Laz@@ arus in 1903 , 17 years after the completion of the monument , was added to his base . &quot;
&quot; as Miller A@@ co@@ sta p@@ enn@@ ed : &quot; I don &apos;t want to go into a complete thing about history here , but the Statue of Liberty is ... a symbol of American freedom that ligh@@ tens the world . &quot;
&quot; the poem , which you refer to , which was later added and is not part of the original Statue of Liberty . &quot;
&quot; Miller is properly correct , but as he formulated it , it &apos;s not really about history . &quot;
&quot; it is about the contemporary response to the vibr@@ ating words of Laz@@ arus , the only ones in which a state does not only invite any old immigrants , but the poor@@ est of the poor . &quot;
&quot; there was never a time in which the &quot; &quot; falling waste &quot; &quot; was better to see on our screens . &quot;
Miller did not engage in literary criticism - he made clear that these people are not welcome in Tr@@ umps USA .
this conflict due to the importance of a statue is part of a wider political and cultural debate : it is indeed a conflict around the importance of America .
&quot; Laz@@ arus - and her friends , who sat down to place their words after their death at the base - knew very well that they took a high political action . &quot;
&quot; the sculpture should show the ties between French and American Repub@@ lic@@ anism , portra@@ ying the female em@@ bodi@@ ment of freedom in a worn @-@ out classical portra@@ yal . &quot;
Laz@@ arus changed this meaning : in her poem the female figure is no longer abstract - she has received a voice .
and she herself gives herself a very different name : mother of Ex@@ il@@ ants .
the link of the poem with the image is a brilliant femin@@ ist cou@@ p and a devast@@ ating attack on the American N@@ ati@@ vis@@ m .
&quot; and exactly how Laz@@ arus changed the meaning of the statue , people from the right wing wanted to change it for a long time . &quot;
&quot; the big Schrei@@ er R@@ ush Lim@@ bau@@ gh , a kind of John the Bapti@@ st for the coming of Tr@@ ump , argued that the Statue of Liberty is no one drawer , but rather an early neo @-@ conserv@@ atives that bring the American flame into the converted world : &quot; Lady Liberty . &quot;
it should bear the tor@@ ch of freedom from the United States into the rest of the world .
the tor@@ ch should not en@@ ligh@@ ten the way to the United States . &quot;
&quot; quite unusual , Lim@@ bau@@ gh is st@@ ung out here . &quot;
the meaning of the statue is quite and even a question of the standpoint of perception .
&quot; the great fan@@ ciful deed of Laz@@ arus was to see them as they were seen by the exhausted , el@@ event@@ h , but hop@@ eful people after long and often horri@@ ble voy@@ ages on the de@@ cks of ships . &quot;
&quot; in the tru@@ est sense , it is about seeing the world from the perspective of people seeking refuge and a chance to improve their lives . &quot;
her statue says to them the words of hope and the welcome that they have to hear .
&quot; and this is , of course , not the perspective that Miller and Tr@@ ump would ever recognize . &quot;
&quot; her tor@@ ch should not en@@ ligh@@ ten the way , but the hatred that is her only source of power . &quot;
world Championship 2017 : N@@ eil Black pra@@ ises Scottish members of the United Kingdom team
E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Do@@ yle rec@@ alls at a time when only two Schot@@ ten belonged to the British team
&quot; the performance director of the athle@@ tics of the United Kingdom , N@@ eil Black , says that the 16 @-@ member sch@@ ot@@ tish cont@@ ingent in the world championship k@@ ader &quot; will make a massive contribution to the team . &quot;
a record number of Scottish athletes was selected for London 2017 which starts Friday .
&quot; black believes that &quot; &quot; in Scotland something special develops &quot; &quot; and the athle@@ tics of the United Kingdom have to learn something from it . &quot;
&quot; we welcome it and we try to understand it , and we will continue until we find out , &quot; &quot; said Black . &quot;
I talk to people at the Scottish Institute of Sport and they think it has something to do with what they have done .
the Scottish athletes think there is something to do with what they have done .
British athle@@ tics : it has something to do with what they have done .
and also with the type on the street corner .
&quot; whatever the combination of circumstances is , it is absolutely brilliant . &quot;
&quot; several of the Scottish athletes are medals candidates , including Laura Mu@@ ir and Andrew But@@ chart , who will compete against Sir Mo Far@@ ah on the 5,000 m track while E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Do@@ yle was elected by the team captain . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; E@@ ili@@ d@@ h is rather modest . &quot;
&quot; their captain speech was incredible , &quot; &quot; says Black . &quot;
&quot; a number of athletes , whether they were Scottish or wherever they live or train , went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motivated . &quot;
the passion and the real feeling that E@@ ili@@ d@@ h naturally introduced were great .
&quot; the Com@@ mon@@ wealth silver medal winner , who will compete in their fifth world champ@@ ionships in the 400 @-@ m @-@ hur@@ d@@ les , says that it is &quot; unbelievable &quot; that 16 Sc@@ ots are in the British team . &quot;
Scotland &apos;s best overall number of athletes in the world championship was seven that were reached in 1983 and 2015 .
the mid @-@ distance runner Mu@@ ir leads along this path and last year has set up five British and two European records .
&quot; it will take part in the 1,500 m and 5,000 m runs . &quot;
&quot; Chris O &apos;@@ H@@ are , who runs 1,500 m , is another Scot@@ sman , which one should observe after a great season that was winning the victory of the British Team Tri@@ als and the Anniversary Games . &quot;
Do@@ yle rec@@ alls her first World Championships as the only other Scot@@ sman in Team Lee Mc@@ Con@@ nell .
&quot; the team captain says that she is &quot; &quot; hu@@ gely proud &quot; &quot; to the fact that many of her comp@@ atri@@ ots are not only part of the team , but in some cases also with medals and fin@@ als . &quot;
&quot; the special thing about being team captain is that it was chosen by the other members of the team so that it was a great honor anyway , but knowing that my team mates voted for me and chose me , it makes something very special for me , &quot; she added . &quot;
obviously I am very proud of all the Sc@@ ots that belong to the team .
it only shows how far we came .
&quot; and they are here as established athletes , athletes who want to asc@@ end to po@@ di@@ ums . &quot;
what concerns my speech as a captain ?
&quot; yes , I think she went well . &quot;
I only pointed out that in this situation we are very happy as we have a home world championship .
so it is really important to put on this home support and profit from it that we are back at the Olympiast@@ adion .
I get a second chance to go out there and compete and it will simply be such a great atmosphere out there .
blocking cre@@ ators on Facebook : don &apos;t worry about a public office if you cannot toler@@ ate the voters of voters
the father of our country knew something of bad press .
&quot; the Americans loved George Washington , but it didn &apos;t last long until the newspapers hit him because of everything , from domestic politics to his political principles . &quot;
&quot; he p@@ enn@@ ed in criticism , certainly . &quot;
but he has not brought his critics to silence .
&quot; in 17@@ 83 , Washington said : &quot; freedom of speech can be taken away - and , sil@@ ly and mu@@ te we will be led like sheep to slaughter . &quot;
&quot; that brings me to Maryland to Gover@@ nor Lar@@ ry H@@ og@@ an , who has to work to be more like Washington . &quot;
Ho@@ gans employees have blocked and deleted the contributions of at least 450 people who have vo@@ iced their opinion on his official Facebook page .
and the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union accused him of the beginning of this week .
&quot; the Gover@@ nor &apos;s staff left the complaint as fri@@ vol@@ ous , and the online commentary was full of a counter @-@ reaction with &quot; Na , and ? . &quot; &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s just Facebook , &quot; &quot; said many people . &quot;
but it is important .
and it is especially important when it is a type like H@@ og@@ an .
this is a repub@@ lican Gover@@ nor in an overwhelming democratic state that is surprisingly popular .
he has the second highest consent of the 50 govern@@ ors of the nation .
H@@ og@@ an is not a reactionary head @-@ head .
he has shown a firm hand in the leadership of his state and strict compliance with the principles .
he was also very sk@@ ill@@ ful to use Facebook as primary means to connect with his voters and play his hair @-@ less head after chemotherapy on his side .
&quot; therefore , the blocking of persons who come to the Gover@@ nor &apos;s side - which is a public forum called officially and by employees who are paid with public tax dollars - unnecessary and ultimately dangerous . &quot;
in an interview with The Washington Post Ho@@ gans spokes@@ man Amel@@ ia Ch@@ asse defended the actions of Gover@@ nor and argued that blocking the comments was nothing more than a moder@@ ation .
but it is too easy to use the picture of troll@@ s or sp@@ amm@@ ers or h@@ asser@@ t people who vibr@@ ate online the whi@@ p .
the post spoke to some of the real people blocked by H@@ og@@ an .
&quot; and these are only real people speaking with their elected leaders : a teacher , an entrepren@@ eur and a priest , no troll@@ s . &quot;
&quot; they all said that their comments were resp@@ ect@@ ful , thou@@ ghtful and not profound . &quot;
the priest cited the Bible in his post and appe@@ aled to Ho@@ gans Catholic faith .
&quot; attorney Lak@@ sh@@ mi Sar@@ ma Ram@@ ani of Bo@@ wie , M@@ d . , was not water @-@ filled , but she asked for hate crimes . &quot;
&quot; I commented on pol@@ itely that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to hate crimes and other current news , &quot; she wrote in the commentary box of the news broadcast &quot; The Post . &quot; &quot;
&quot; I also don &apos;t appreciate this idea if a number of people take a position on the same topic , they are ignored by some rather than a so @-@ called collective effort and not recognized as a large group of affected citizens . &quot;
&quot; what the staff of the Gover@@ nor referred to as &quot; &quot; concentrated spam @-@ attack &quot; , &quot; others would probably call &quot; &quot; inter@@ ces@@ sion &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the Facebook era makes it easy to cut a message by simply blocking a critic , or deleted a negative comment . &quot;
&quot; it is much cleaner than in earlier times , if you have done the same that employees were sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical edit@@ orials and to arrest them or to silence them . &quot;
but this is exactly what happens digit@@ ally .
H@@ og@@ an is not the first public official to critici@@ ze Facebook and other social media .
President Tr@@ ump is acc@@ using Twitter users who have been blocked by his Twitter feed .
one of the first mil@@ estones in this question fell last week in Virginia .
&quot; the Chairman of the Board of Super@@ vis@@ ors des Lou@@ dou@@ n County conclu@@ des the First A@@ mend@@ ment , according to U.S. District Ju@@ dge James C. C@@ ach@@ er@@ is in Alexand@@ ria , when they have ban@@ ished a vot@@ er from their Facebook page . &quot;
&quot; and in K@@ entu@@ cky , Gover@@ nor Matt Bev@@ in ( R ) also received a visit to the AC@@ L@@ U because of his use of Facebook and Twitter . &quot;
this should not be so hard .
&quot; at the time of Washington , the time of affordable port@@ tos had a similar effect as the Internet . &quot;
&quot; the number of newspapers multip@@ lied between 17@@ 76 and 1800 , and anonymous letters struck him on his lead . &quot;
and even back then Washington had anonymous troll@@ s .
&quot; the people who used pseu@@ don@@ y@@ ms like &quot; Jur@@ ic@@ ola , &quot; &quot; Val@@ eri@@ us , &quot; &quot; Bel@@ is@@ arius &quot; and &quot; Por@@ tius , &quot; wrote all letters to papers that made Washington &apos;s decisions . &quot;
&quot; peti@@ tions , who critici@@ zed his position on the Treaty of Am@@ ity , trade and shipping with Britain , over@@ came his office , according to the historical documents collected by the online papers of the George Washington Project . &quot;
but he did not bring them to silence .
&quot; freedom of speech , dis@@ agreements and dis@@ courses belong to the foundation of our nation . &quot;
and true guidance means accepting this .
Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty hopes home comforts in the Renaissance club
&quot; the former European No. 1 Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty will be hoping for local comfort over the next three days , as the Renaissance club held in East Lot@@ hi@@ an &apos;s 25th edition of the Scottish Senior Open . &quot;
&quot; the Nor@@ di@@ re , who last year in the Ar@@ cher@@ field links up to the final round , before he lost Paul E@@ ales , is associated with the new venue and acts as tournament ambassador in the name of the club founder and CE@@ Os Jer@@ ry Sar@@ v@@ adi . &quot;
&quot; I saw how the Renaissance club was built , and we see how he achieved his fame with this event , &quot; said Raff@@ er@@ ty . &quot;
&quot; players will see this course from his best side , he is in a great condition . &quot;
Jer@@ ry made a great job when he fixed this place .
he is a ze@@ al@@ ous champion of this game and is proud of his performance here .
this is a great showcase for this course . &quot;
&quot; the British E@@ ales is looking forward to defending champ@@ ionships for the first time , although he won both the European Tour and the European Challenge Tour in his 32 @-@ year career . &quot;
&quot; that feels really special , &quot; said the player in South@@ port . &quot;
&quot; I cannot defend the Extre@@ ma@@ dura Open , since it was taken out of the program in the year after I gained it . &quot;
to come back to this part of the world is magical .
it is a wonderful place to play golf .
&quot; the memories of last year come back , and it was something special for me and my wife Shar@@ on to win last year here . &quot;
it was a really special time and one that we will always cher@@ ish .
&quot; Gary Or@@ r , who came to the European Senior Tour after his 50@@ th birthday this year , returns to the action on home floor . &quot;
this event will be its first Scottish performance since the Aber@@ deen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013 .
&quot; it always means a bit more when you play at home , &quot; &quot; said Or@@ r , the man from Hel@@ ens@@ burgh . &quot;
&quot; you want to do it well , but you also feel that extra pressure . &quot;
I really enjoyed playing it again and I played a solid golf .
I am happy about how it has gone .
&quot; the trio on the field are the former masters winner Ian Wo@@ os@@ nam and Senior Major Champions Paul Broad@@ hur@@ st , Roger Chap@@ man , Mark James and Mark Mc@@ N@@ ulty . &quot;
&quot; OR@@ R and the former Ry@@ der Cup captain Sam Tor@@ ran@@ ce belong to the six ball@@ ots in the field , the others are Andrew Old@@ corn , Stephen Mc@@ Alli@@ ster , Bill Long@@ mu@@ ir and Ross Dr@@ um@@ mond . &quot;
&quot; admission is free , the car park costs £ 5 per car with a passenger and £ 10 per car with two or more passengers . &quot;
all proceeds go to Pro@@ state Cancer UK .
less pul@@ mon@@ ary canc@@ ers due to passive smoking
&quot; over the past two decades , fewer people have died because of passive smoking in lung cancer . &quot;
scientists at the University Hospital Hamburg @-@ E@@ pp@@ endorf ( U@@ KE ) come to this conclusion in a study .
&quot; according to our estimates , 167 pul@@ mon@@ ary cancer cases are attri@@ but@@ able to li@@ abilities per year , &quot; said Dr. Hei@@ ko Becher . &quot;
&quot; as a comparison , he drew up his own study on this subject from 1994 . &quot;
&quot; at that time , there have been 400 lung cancer cases due to passive smoking per year in Germany . &quot;
the new research is published in the &quot; International Journal of Public Health . &quot;
domestic connections turn out to be very complex
&quot; construction works in the Vill@@ inger Straße are in full swing and &quot; are reasonably in time , &quot; as the leader of the building yard Fred Hein@@ ze . &quot;
&quot; in the area of house connections , the situation is more complicated than suspected as there is a lot of mountains in the underground , which is not noted in the plans . &quot;
&quot; traffic , which repeatedly hin@@ ders construction work , represents a major problem for the B@@ aut@@ ru@@ pp of the company St@@ ump@@ p . &quot;
&quot; the ignorance of the mot@@ orists before red lights and barriers is already enormous , &quot; &quot; says Hein@@ ze . &quot;
the road is closed and only the regular buses are eligible for passage .
&quot; Angelo Car@@ us@@ o , Mar@@ vin Ko@@ stor@@ z and Tim Ko@@ stor@@ z from St@@ ump@@ p have been working on the bridge for weeks . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the hot days have been quite exhau@@ sting . &quot;
&quot; but fortunately we were supplied by our friend Fritz Matt with cool mineral water , &quot; says Mar@@ vin Ko@@ stor@@ z . &quot;
poverty and death in the Indones@@ ian Gold@@ land
&quot; when Bar@@ dina De@@ ge@@ i coo@@ ks the dinner , she doesn &apos;t use any cooker . &quot;
it even rarely uses a pot .
&quot; in her log house in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , the capital of the Pan@@ i@@ ai Reg@@ ard@@ ship in the in@@ quiet Indones@@ ian province of Pap@@ ua , the house@@ wife usually den@@ otes a sweet potato - locally called &quot; not@@ a &quot; - directly in the chim@@ ney . &quot;
&quot; after half an hour , the char@@ red button will be removed with free@@ zing , un@@ washed hands and swal@@ lowed . &quot;
&quot; De@@ ge@@ i sits on the clay floor - she has no furniture - where she also performs her daily work , e.g. clothes with dec@@ eit@@ ful water from the nearby sw@@ amp . &quot;
a bucket in a hom@@ eless room serves as a lat@@ rine .
&quot; as the youngest of her husband &apos;s four wives , her were not assigned fields . &quot;
poly@@ gam@@ y is common here .
&quot; of course , late to work can be dangerous : most vill@@ agers are unemployed , and many drink heavily , and there are the soldiers here . &quot;
&quot; nobody dar@@ es to run around in the village after 5 pm , &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; it is a rare insight into daily life in the high@@ lands of Pap@@ ua , a former Dutch colony , which was recorded in 1969 after a controversial referendum in Indonesia , when only 1,0@@ 26 elders were to vote in front of the occup@@ ying forces . &quot;
&quot; an existing movement , which stir@@ red up for independence against Dutch rule , turned swi@@ ft@@ ly against the government of Jak@@ arta , which maintains control of the region and exclu@@ des foreign journalists or legal ob@@ servers . &quot;
&quot; in 2003 , the province was officially divided into Pap@@ ua and West Pap@@ ua , where the independent part of Pap@@ ua New Guinea included the eastern part of the island . &quot;
En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali is as seclu@@ ded as it is . the journey includes a 90 @-@ minute flight from the province capital of Jay@@ ap@@ ura to Nab@@ ire and then a morning drive with the car .
there is no public transportation .
&quot; the town with about 19@@ ,000 inhabitants is made up of wooden houses , surrounded by bam@@ boo tiles , and from corrug@@ ated roofs , which were converted into different yel@@ lo@@ wish tones by r@@ ust . &quot;
&quot; only very few Indones@@ ian have made their trip here , let journalists and practically no foreigners . &quot;
&quot; before Christian mission@@ aries arrived , Me@@ e P@@ ago Pap@@ u@@ ans honored a god named U@@ ga Tam@@ ee . &quot;
there were also other changes .
&quot; we were not acc@@ u@@ stom@@ ed to wearing these clothes , &quot; De@@ ge@@ i said and points to her lively , hand@@ woven tur@@ ban , her dark shirt and her bright skir@@ t . &quot;
&quot; in the past , we had only leaves at our bodies . &quot;
Pap@@ ua is Indonesia &apos;s poor@@ est province where 28 % of people live below the poverty line and have some of the worst children &apos;s mort@@ ality and liter@@ acy rates in Asia .
but it is also Indonesia &apos;s Gold@@ land .
&quot; the largest and most profitable gold mine in the world , Gr@@ ass@@ berg , owned by the Fre@@ ep@@ ort Mc@@ Mor@@ an from Phoenix , lies only 60 miles from Pan@@ i@@ ai , a high@@ land province in the size of New Jersey with 15@@ 3,000 inhabitants . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 alone , Fre@@ ep@@ ort produced gold and copper in the value of $ 3.1 billion . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Pap@@ ua has valued USD 78 billion worth of estimated USD 78 billion . &quot;
&quot; these riches , however , are a source of misery for the Pap@@ ua who ensure that Indonesia &apos;s powerful military has kept a sti@@ cking presence . &quot;
&quot; an investigation of 2005 in the New York Times reported that Fre@@ ep@@ ort paid almost 20 million US dollars to local military units and units between 1998 and 2004 , including up to 150,000 US dollars to a single officer . &quot;
Pap@@ uan demands for greater autonomy thre@@ aten these golden go@@ ose and are treated mer@@ cil@@ ess@@ ly .
&quot; according to activists , more than 500,000 Pap@@ ua were killed and thousands have been ra@@ ped by the Indones@@ ian military since 1969 , tor@@ tured and imprisoned . &quot;
Mass@@ ent@@ o@@ aths in Pap@@ u@@ as tribal high@@ land in the 1970 @-@ s have been genocide in accordance with the Asia @-@ Human Rights Commission .
&quot; in the region alone , Indones@@ ian police arrested more than 3,@@ 900 peaceful demonstr@@ ators in the past year . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we Bec@@ ome Every@@ thing &quot; &quot; means in a report by the Arch@@ dioc@@ ese of Bris@@ bane from 2016 , in which reports on atro@@ cities of the previous year are included , such as illegal exec@@ utions and torture - rape and electrical sur@@ charges are particularly popular after another report - and the brutal repression of peaceful demonstrations . &quot;
&quot; it is difficult to count the number of victims as each week occurs , &quot; says Andreas Har@@ son@@ o , Indonesia researcher for Human Rights Watch . &quot;
the screws have reinforced because Pap@@ uan &apos;s resources bring an influ@@ x of sett@@ lers from other parts of Indonesia .
&quot; the population of 3.5 million inhabitants of the province is 83 % Christian , but demographic developments are changing because Muslim economic migrants are coming from the most popul@@ ous islands of Java , Bor@@ neo , Sum@@ atra and Sul@@ awes@@ i . &quot;
&quot; Jav@@ an@@ ese War@@ ming @-@ Cant@@ ines sell fried chicken and g@@ ado @-@ g@@ ado , a mixed vegetables with pe@@ an@@ ut sauce . &quot;
local people struggle to keep up here .
&quot; the migrants have begun to sell chick@@ ens and vegetables on the traditional market cheaper than the local pap@@ ua , &quot; explains A@@ bet@@ h You , a 24 @-@ year @-@ old Pan@@ i@@ ai locals , who went to work in the province capital of Jay@@ ap@@ ura . &quot;
&quot; it has the native Pap@@ ua - the Mama @-@ Mama &#91; the women &#93; of Pap@@ ua , cost her market . &quot;
&quot; the Indones@@ ian president Jok@@ o Wi@@ do@@ do , known as Jok@@ ow@@ i , promised to address ine@@ qualities and violations in Pap@@ ua during his electoral campaign in 2014 . &quot;
&quot; the former carp@@ enter secured 27 of the 29 districts of Pap@@ ua , including Pan@@ i@@ ai - on the way to the presidential palace in Jak@@ arta . &quot;
&quot; but in Pap@@ ua has changed little , and today the locals feel betra@@ yed . &quot;
&quot; our hearts are broken , because we voted for Jok@@ ow@@ i in 2014 , with the expectation that he will fulfill our hopes that justice is restored , &quot; says You . &quot;
Pan@@ i@@ ai actually suffered only two months after Jok@@ ow@@ is inaugur@@ ation in October .
&quot; on 7 December 2014 , a group of 11 children was outside and sang Christmas car@@ ols in front of a camp@@ fire in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , when two Indones@@ ian soldiers broke on a motorcycle through the dark . &quot;
the fri@@ ghtened children told them that they should turn off their head@@ lights .
&quot; one of the soldiers participated in their sound , and later came back with four soldiers , so the local pastor Y@@ av@@ ed@@ t T@@ eb@@ ai . &quot;
&quot; the soldiers who had drunk , pursued and beat the group with their rif@@ le guns , said victims and witnesses . &quot;
then one of the soldiers fired into the group of children .
&quot; a child , the 16 year old Y@@ uli@@ anus Y@@ ei@@ mo , was so badly beaten that he fell into coma . &quot;
a few hours later the building of the nearby government commission was set on fire and the things escal@@ ated the next day .
&quot; about 1,000 young Pap@@ ua men , women and children gathered at a football pitch in front of the local police station and the military command center to demand justice . &quot;
they carried cerem@@ onial hunting ar@@ ches and performed the Wa@@ ita dance - in the circle of time and a bird @-@ singing im@@ it@@ ating - from Pap@@ u@@ as Me@@ e P@@ ago strain .
some prot@@ esters began to spin stones on police and military posts .
&quot; when the atmosphere was heated , the soldiers sent a command over an internal radio : &quot; if the masses do more than three times , they shoot them dead , &quot; says it in an official TIME document that was not released to the local media . &quot;
&quot; Y@@ er@@ em@@ ias Kay@@ ame , 56 , head of the ego Kot@@ o district of En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , saw the threatening danger and called for rest and urged the crowd to return home . &quot;
nobody was listening to the mood .
&quot; when I turned around , I was suddenly shot in my left wrist , &quot; &quot; he said TIME on the porch of his colorful painted wooden house . &quot;
&quot; Kay@@ ame still doesn &apos;t know who fired , but says that the ball came out of the ranks of the soldiers assembled here . &quot;
&quot; it was crowded , many shots were fired , &quot; he adds . &quot;
&quot; the native man Al@@ fi@@ us You@@ w was hit three times , so his c@@ ousin , the witness of the shooting was . &quot;
&quot; I ran to him and examined his body to make sure he was it , &quot; said Y@@ oh@@ anes , who we@@ ars a name like many Indones@@ ian , the TIME in glo@@ omy mood . &quot;
I saw that he was dead ... I knew him .
&quot; the chief inspec@@ tor of the Pap@@ ua Police , Y@@ ot@@ je Men@@ de , told rep@@ or@@ ters that his officers would only &quot; secure &quot; their station because they were attacked . &quot;
&quot; we have to defend ourselves when people thre@@ aten to kill us , &quot; said the spokes@@ man of the Pap@@ ua Police , Commissioner Pu@@ d@@ jo Sul@@ ei@@ yo , in 2015 . &quot;
&quot; it is about life and death . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; according to Human Rights Watch , five young demonstr@@ ators were killed and many others injured . &quot;
the news on the kill@@ ings came only on the following day &apos; filtered &apos; to Jak@@ arta .
&quot; three weeks , Jok@@ ow@@ i in Jay@@ ap@@ ura gave a passionate speech in which he expressed sympathy for the families of the victims , and s@@ wore to address the historical mis@@ eries in Pap@@ ua . &quot;
&quot; I want this case to be resolved immediately , so that it will no longer happen in the future , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; in October 2016 , Security Minister Wir@@ anto said that he had a extra@@ judicial mechanism to establish historical human rights violations . &quot;
but the exc@@ uses began almost immediately .
&quot; most injuries have occurred a long time ago .
some were in the 90 &apos;s and at the beginning of the 2000 @-@ he years .
&quot; the point is that we have committed ourselves to tackle these violations , but there are processes that must be passed through , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; then Wir@@ anto made a retreat when he spoke to TIME on June 5 in Jak@@ arta and said , he has no plans to set up a complaint mechanism in Pap@@ ua . &quot;
&quot; instead , everything is regulated by law , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; Wir@@ anto , who accused the UN for &quot; crimes against humanity , &quot; said that 11 cases of human rights violations in Pap@@ ua were already attached , including the Pan@@ i@@ ai incident . &quot;
families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai victims received such claims with gri@@ ev@@ ous un@@ belief .
&quot; I was inter@@ viewed four times over the last three years , but there was no progress , &quot; says Y@@ oh@@ anes . &quot;
&quot; I am tired . &quot;
he says he still lives in fear years later .
&quot; I &apos;m afraid , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m afraid to be arrested by the military , I &apos;m afraid to be shot . &quot;
his brother Y@@ ac@@ ob@@ us repeated the opinion that people in Pan@@ i@@ ai were afraid to discuss the incident .
he says he was beaten by the military after he helped to bury four of the victims .
&quot; after I had buried the bodies , the military sought after me , &quot; he says . &quot;
the found@@ ries have not ceased .
on Tuesday the Indones@@ ian police shot on vill@@ agers in Pan@@ i@@ ais neighborhood Dei@@ y@@ ai .
&quot; during a confrontation between vill@@ agers and the manager of a construction company that refused to bring a un@@ conscious man to the hospital , a person and 17 others died , including children . &quot;
&quot; the man , the 24 @-@ year @-@ old R@@ avi@@ anus Dou@@ w , who was drow@@ ned when fishing was fishing in a nearby river died on the way to the hospital . &quot;
excited vill@@ agers prot@@ ested in front of the company &apos;s office .
the police said that the vill@@ agers threw stones on officers who re@@ acted by fir@@ ing warning shots .
but locals say that the mobile Brig@@ ade ( Indones@@ ian par@@ am@@ ilit@@ ary police ) began to shoot the crowd and killed one .
&quot; we were so in panic , we are afraid that there will be ven@@ ge@@ ance , &quot; says the 29 @-@ year @-@ old Dom@@ ing@@ gu B@@ adi@@ i , who lived near the hospital and witnessed how the injured were soon arrived , so the TIME . &quot;
&quot; I hid myself two days in my house . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Dei@@ y@@ ai Parliament called to take account of the officers involved and withdraw the mobile bri@@ g@@ ade from the territory .
Pan@@ i@@ ai was always a trouble for the Indones@@ ian government .
&quot; the lack of meaningful development strengthens the dis@@ content of the family members Me@@ e , Mon@@ i , Dan@@ i and dam@@ al , who live in the green high@@ lands of Pap@@ ua . &quot;
&quot; many joined the Free Pap@@ ua movement ( O@@ PM ) , the rebel army , claim@@ ing to defend the rights of the Pap@@ ua by increasing spor@@ adi@@ c attacks and kid@@ n@@ apping of Indones@@ ian soldiers . &quot;
&quot; some of the Top O@@ PM leaders are from Pan@@ i@@ ai , among them Ta@@ di@@ us Yog@@ i and Daniel Yu@@ das Kog@@ o@@ ya . &quot;
&quot; in response to this , thousands of people were arrested in Pan@@ i@@ ai in recent years and arbit@@ rar@@ ily taken into custo@@ dy , under the pre@@ text of &quot; securing national sovereignty . &quot; &quot;
some never dive again .
&quot; among the people in Pap@@ ua , Pan@@ i@@ ai is known as &quot; a tragic , forgotten place . &quot; &quot;
poverty strengthens dis@@ content .
&quot; the little rice , sold in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , is too expensive for locals . &quot;
bread is just as out of reach .
&quot; people here build everything they eat , especially not@@ a and fruit and leaf@@ y vegetables . &quot;
&quot; agriculture is the task of women , each with four or five fields of sweet potato . &quot;
they retain most of the harvest for the family while the rest is sold on the local market .
ten pieces of Not@@ a only cost 10.000 Indones@@ ian ru@@ pe@@ es ( 75 C@@ ents ) .
&quot; over time , economic ine@@ qualities have grown between the native Pap@@ ua and the new migrants , who have arrived in greater numbers since the inaugur@@ ation of new flight routes to Nab@@ ire Airport . &quot;
the few jobs that exist in the region usually go to the better educated and prosper@@ ous migrants .
Pap@@ ua rarely have capital or the necessary skills to make their own businesses competitive .
&quot; the young people are not interested in staying in the village ... because there are no jobs or money , &quot; says John Gob@@ ai , Chairman of the Board of Chief of Pan@@ i@@ ai . &quot;
isolation holds the eyes of the world far from Pap@@ ua .
&quot; in addition , restrictions in reporting international media remain ten@@ se . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the year , French journalists Fran@@ ck Esc@@ u@@ die and Basi@@ lle Long@@ ch@@ amp were dep@@ orted to Pap@@ ua for lack of coordination , although their rare permission was given to films . &quot;
&quot; according to P@@ hel@@ im K@@ ine , the deputy @-@ Asia Director of Human Rights Watch , the promises of Jok@@ ow@@ is campaign were to highlight the limitations of reporting to promote transparency and development . &quot;
&quot; there are new dangers for foreign journalists trying to report from Indonesia &apos;s most unusual provinces of Pap@@ ua and West Pap@@ ua : visa den@@ ial and a black list , &quot; &quot; he said in an explanation . &quot;
lack of press control means that international pressure on the Indones@@ ian government is largely limited to the immediate neighbours Pap@@ u@@ as .
&quot; in March , six Pacific States - Ton@@ ga , Nau@@ ru , Palau , Tu@@ val@@ u , the Marshall Islands and the Solomon Islands - demanded the UN Human Rights Council to investigate the &quot; various and widespread injury &quot; in Pap@@ ua , including the Pan@@ i@@ ai fo@@ undry . &quot;
the same countries have historically supported the O@@ PM .
&quot; the spokes@@ man of the Indones@@ ian Ministry of Foreign Affairs Ar@@ r@@ man@@ atha N@@ asi@@ r rejected the accus@@ ations of the group and said journalists in Jak@@ arta : &quot; &quot; in Indonesia there is still a democratic system , and there are free media , so it is difficult to cover the evidence for human rights . &quot;
local people want more foreign governments to take note of this .
&quot; as an official delegation from the Netherlands , under the leadership of the Human Rights Ambassador K@@ ees Van Ba@@ ar , Jay@@ ap@@ ura visited her silence and urged him &quot; We want freedom , &quot; according to a source that also participated in the meeting , but wants to remain anonymous . &quot;
&quot; Indonesia has a further presidential election in 2019 , but the Pap@@ ua say that they will probably not vote again for Jok@@ ow@@ i . &quot;
&quot; Jok@@ ow@@ i is a man who has good intentions , but he is surrounded by the people who are involved in the Pan@@ i@@ ai shots , &quot; says Gob@@ ai , Chairman of the Board of Directors . &quot;
&quot; he wants Jok@@ ow@@ i knows that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people , apart from that it lives under the constant threat of a pre@@ dat@@ ory military , is in poor educ@@ ation@@ - and health services . &quot;
&quot; Gob@@ ai says that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people , like other Pap@@ ua , consider their voice for Jok@@ ow@@ i as a &quot; guilt &quot; which he must pay back . &quot;
&quot; they don &apos;t need money , they just want justice , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; despite the threats and inti@@ mid@@ ations , families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai @-@ shot victims resulted in a last symbolic act of de@@ fi@@ ance : the cor@@ p@@ se of a victim was buried on a site exactly opposite the police and the military station . &quot;
&quot; they know they might never come to justice , but at least they don &apos;t let those responsible forget their crimes . &quot;
&quot; a member of our family was killed , &quot; says Y@@ ac@@ ob@@ us with a lowered head . &quot;
&quot; what else can we do ? &quot;
fire capture the &apos; Tor@@ ch &apos; sky@@ scra@@ pers of Dubai for the second time
&quot; on Friday , a fire took place in one of the highest towers in the world in Dubai and forced hundreds of inhabitants to flee from the 337 @-@ meter high , 79 @-@ storey building . &quot;
&quot; it is the second fire that is swe@@ pt through the high @-@ rise in just two years , which is acci@@ dentally called the Tor@@ ch Tower ( tor@@ ch tower ) . &quot;
&quot; the building was ev@@ acu@@ ated , injuries were not reported , and there was no direct word about the cause of the flame . &quot;
we slept and we got up with the fire alarm and scre@@ aming people .
&quot; we ran down the stairs , and it took about 10 minutes to get down from the 50@@ th floor down , &quot; &quot; told a resident who called his name as George ang@@ ab , Reuters . &quot;
&quot; Dubai &apos;s civil defence authorities said that fire fighting units against 4.00 p.m. local time ( 00@@ .00 GMT ) extingu@@ ished the fire , and cooled down the building . &quot;
the government said they work on providing accommodation for those affected .
the incident may revi@@ ve questions on the safety of materials used in outdoor areas of high @-@ rise buildings all over the world .
&quot; an investigation by the management of the tor@@ ch building after its fire in 2015 revealed that the largest part of the damage from facing , outer casing for decoration or isolation came . &quot;
&quot; in Britain , the police said , they believe that the system of panels for insulation and fair@@ ing in the London Gren@@ fell Tower in June could have contributed to the rapid spread of a fire in which about 80 people died . &quot;
no Davis Cup Reform : far@@ ther Best @-@ of @-@ five
the President of the International Tennis Association ( IT@@ F ) has fallen through his big Davis Cup cou@@ p at the General Assembly .
&quot; at the Ho Chi Min@@ h City meeting , the proposal to play Davis Cup singles out for this sport was only supported by two @-@ thirds majority . &quot;
&quot; although often very long , but also therefore very much appreciated five @-@ set classics remain the traditional competition . &quot;
&quot; 6@@ 3,@@ 54 percent of member countries voted for the reform , the objective of IT@@ F president David Hag@@ ger@@ ty was therefore only margin@@ ally missed . &quot;
&quot; we respect this decision , but are disappointed that our member@@ ships have not accepted the whole reform package for the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup . &quot;
&quot; we need a change to secure the long @-@ term future of these icon@@ ic and historic cont@@ ests , &quot; &quot; said Hag@@ ger@@ ty . &quot;
you will continue to work on improving the application .
&quot; not only for the vote , after many say@@ ings , the proposal has already come to place the final in a neutral place . &quot;
&quot; new from 2018 are compar@@ atively small details : in future , the fin@@ alists will have the host right in the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup in the next year . &quot;
&quot; in order to reduce the costs for the organis@@ ers , the requirements for training places etc. are facilit@@ ated and players will have to complete less official media events before the Davis Cup . &quot;
&quot; more than 1 out of 5 US travelers brings prohibited items into the air@@ plane , finds a pol@@ l &quot;
&quot; a survey among passengers &apos; passengers concluded that more than 20 percent were consciously or un@@ consciously prohibited items from the control points of the U.S. Transportation Security Administration , including at least 6 percent who entered the aircraft while they acci@@ dentally wore forbidden kni@@ ves or other items with blades . &quot;
&quot; less than 1 percent claimed , they would have been late discovered that they were mistaken for fire@@ arms , amm@@ unition or explo@@ sives . &quot;
&quot; the survey carried out at more than 1,000 people , which was carried out by a jet charter service , the Strat@@ os Jet Char@@ ters Inc . , also noted that younger travellers are more likely to ignore the rules . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; the most common items , which were inten@@ tionally past by T@@ SA agents , were food and liquids . &quot;
&quot; more than 3 percent said to have know@@ ingly worn items with blades through security control , while 2.2 percent of the female respon@@ dents and 3.7 percent of the male respon@@ dents also confirmed that they had deliberately brought bot@@ her@@ some drugs to the aircraft . &quot;
&quot; the company said it was asking travelers all over the country to find out how many in@@ adver@@ t@@ ently taken smu@@ g@@ gling goods by airport security , and how many could have done it inten@@ tionally . &quot;
&quot; it is no surprise that people who most likely wear smu@@ g@@ gling goods - know@@ ingly or unknow@@ ingly - carry on safety , those who were most often flying . &quot;
&quot; the company , however , points out that the T@@ SA guidelines are a bit complicated and conf@@ using . &quot;
people often are unsure which liquids are allowed to take with them or how much of them .
so it is no surprise that the largest amount of liquids con@@ fis@@ cated by the T@@ SA are prohibited liquids .
&quot; for a long time , the people that T@@ SA could look at books as smu@@ g@@ gling goods . &quot;
fluids are allowed on domestic flights but not on international flights .
El@@ on Mus@@ k doesn &apos;t matter : tens of thousands of Tes@@ la customers cancel order
Elektro @-@ Taus@@ end@@ s@@ ass@@ a El@@ on Mus@@ k enjoys a huge number of pre @-@ orders for his new Tes@@ la &quot; Model 3 . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , he has hi@@ ther@@ to under@@ estimated that some of the customers have already with@@ drawn their non @-@ binding reservation . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the ever tri@@ ump@@ y figures on sales increases and even more gigantic sales targets , Tes@@ la boss El@@ on Mus@@ k showed for the first time a different , less brilliant number for the first time in the announcement of the recent quar@@ terly report : the new mass market model 3 . &quot;
&quot; in recent months , Mus@@ k frequently had more than 500,000 reservation orders for the new car , whose delivery is just starting . &quot;
&quot; now Mus@@ k has one : from the total 5@@ 18@@ ,000 pre @-@ orders , 63@@ .000 has already been with@@ drawn . &quot;
critics have repeatedly pointed out that it is merely non @-@ binding reservations .
&quot; in case of cancellation , Tes@@ la is paying the 1000 Euro ( in the US 1000 US dollars and in the UK 1000 pounds ) &quot; Reser@@ vation payment . &quot; &quot;
&quot; at the moment 45@@ 5,000 such un@@ binding reservations stand before , sp@@ ati@@ fied mus@@ k in a telephone conference with analysts . &quot;
&quot; however , the Tes@@ la boss does not believe that the cancellation of about twelve percent of all orders could become a problem . &quot;
&quot; his argument : the challenge of the ambitious growth targets is not in demand , but on the production side . &quot;
&quot; last year , Tes@@ la supplied 84@@ .000 vehicles . &quot;
&quot; in 2018 , all models will be combined - 500,000 be one million by 2020 . &quot;
the demand for this is obviously there .
&quot; according to Mus@@ k , there are 1800 reservations per day . &quot;
&quot; if you order today a model 3 , you may expect delivery at the earliest in the second half of 2018 - when Tes@@ la manages to drive its brand new , never before tested production roads with maximum capacity utilization . &quot;
many experts say that this is possible .
&quot; but if it comes to greater delays , then the in@@ consistency of reservations might become a problem for Tes@@ la . &quot;
&quot; for then , the company cannot prevent dis@@ satisfied customers from getting away in flocks . &quot;
EPA boss P@@ ru@@ itt reti@@ res from the Obama @-@ Er@@ a rules for reducing emissions
&quot; a day after having been acc@@ u@@ stom@@ ed by 15 countries , Scott P@@ ru@@ itt , head of the Environmental Protection Agency , took his earlier decision to delay the implementation of the Obama era rules in order to reduce emissions @-@ causing air poll@@ ut@@ ants . &quot;
P@@ ru@@ itt presented the change when his agency proved to be respon@@ sive to the needs of state environmental authorities as far as previous administr@@ ations .
he did not mention the complaint filed against his previous post in a Federal Court of App@@ eal .
&quot; it is about a period of time that took place on October 1 , in order to meet the 2015 standards set for ground @-@ level o@@ zone . &quot;
&quot; in June , P@@ ru@@ itt announced that he will delay compliance with one year to give his authority more time to study the plan and to avoid , &quot; interfere in local decisions or to hin@@ der economic growth . &quot;
&quot; P@@ ru@@ itt , who was before his appointment by President Donald Tr@@ ump &apos;s prosec@@ utor of O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma , had long been a reliable opponent of stric@@ ter environmental regulations . &quot;
&quot; since its arrival in Washington , P@@ ru@@ itt has repeatedly passed to block or delay regulations to which the chemical industry and the industry of fossil fuels resist . &quot;
the sudden revers@@ al of Wednesday is the most recent legal back@@ lash for the withdrawal of regulatory roll@@ back agenda .
&quot; last month , a Federal Court of App@@ eal in Washington decided that the EPA authorities over@@ stepped its authority when he tried to delay the implementation of a rule by the Obama administration , the oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce meth@@ ane le@@ aks . &quot;
&quot; in a statement published on Wednesday evening , P@@ ru@@ itt suggested that his revers@@ al of o@@ zone standards is simply the willingness of EPA to cooperate with the states through the complex process of timely fulfillment of the new standards . &quot;
&quot; under previous administr@@ ations , the EPA has often failed to comply with the dead@@ lines for carrying out and then servic@@ ed to be indic@@ ted by activ@@ ist groups and others , and in an agreement to determine the date for implementation , &quot; said P@@ ru@@ itt , who def@@ ends EPA for more than a dozen times in his previous job . &quot;
&quot; we do not believe in regulation by court proceedings , and we take dead@@ lines seriously . &quot;
we also take the law and authority we give to us seriously .
&quot; nevertheless , the EPA said that P@@ ru@@ itt will eventually use his &quot; authority to delay and all other legally available full @-@ powers &quot; to make sure the rules are based on sound policy and the best available information . &quot;
the Repub@@ lic@@ ans in Congress are pushing for a more comprehensive re@@ constitution of the o@@ zone rules .
a bill issued last month is to delay the implementation of the 2015 rules for at least eight years .
the measure was not yet set to vote in the Senate .
&quot; the New York Public Prosec@@ utor Eric Schnei@@ der@@ man , who led the Coalition of States that had lam@@ ented the EPA in this week , said the Group intended to uph@@ old the legal pressure . &quot;
&quot; the conversion of EPA - according to our complaints - is an important gain for health and safety of these 6.7 million New Yor@@ kers and the more than 115 million Americans who are directly affected by the smo@@ g , who flows into their communities , &quot; said Schnei@@ der@@ man . &quot;
&quot; in this case , New York joined California , Connec@@ tic@@ ut , Del@@ aware , Illinois , I@@ owa , Ma@@ ine , Massachusetts , Minn@@ es@@ ota , New Mexico , Oregon , Penn@@ syl@@ van@@ ies , Rho@@ de Island , Ver@@ mont and Washington and the District of Columbia . &quot;
&quot; soil o@@ zone arises when poll@@ ut@@ ants from cars , power plants , oil refin@@ eries , chemical plants , and other sources in the atmosphere react to sunlight . &quot;
&quot; the resulting smo@@ g may cause serious respiratory problems in sensitive groups of people , and each year will contribute to thousands of premature deaths . &quot;
representatives of public health care and the environ@@ ment@@ alists che@@ ered about the unexpected course of course .
&quot; it is distur@@ bing how much pressure it takes to get this reasonable step from the responsible for protecting the air that we breathe in , &quot; said Lor@@ i Ann Bur@@ d from the Center for Bi@@ ological Di@@ versity . &quot;
&quot; we must continue to fight against the ideological crus@@ ade of the Tr@@ ump @-@ government , to adapt to environmental poll@@ uting and their particular interests . &quot;
Tum@@ lingen celebrates 750 years of St. Hil@@ arius Church
&quot; 750 years St. Hil@@ arius Church : on the occasion of the anniversary of the mountain church , the old cemetery site in Tum@@ lingen on Sunday , 16 July , at 4.@@ 30 p.m. on a ser@@ en@@ ade . &quot;
&quot; whether its idyllic location and beautiful view of the village , the historic St. Hil@@ arius facility is a popular place to stay . &quot;
visitors to the sixth Ben@@ e@@ fi@@ z ser@@ en@@ ade can be ench@@ anted by this powerful place .
the rescue and conservation of the oldest building in the village have made the friends and promot@@ ers of tum@@ ours to their concern .
Walter Mart@@ ini empha@@ sizes : &quot; it is a unique d@@ ör@@ f@@ liches Klein@@ od . &quot;
&quot; in 12@@ 67 , the St. Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kap@@ elle was first mentioned in documents in the Wür@@ ttem@@ berg@@ ischen Ur@@ kunden@@ buch : count Hermann von Sul@@ z sold the mountain with the parish church to Tum@@ lingen and his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark Silver . &quot;
&quot; according to the original deed , on the Tum@@ lingen mountain apart from the former parish church , there was also a beautiful courtyard where the church or pat@@ ron@@ al law belonged to and not the other way round . &quot;
so there were also people there .
&quot; as from the description of the Ober@@ am@@ tes Freuden@@ stadt from 18@@ 58 , beside the village and the Ober@@ dorf , which are still visible in the village of Tum@@ lingen , the &quot; &quot; Berg &quot; &quot; is the third , the settlement nucle@@ us of the village . &quot;

&quot; a Lord , who built a church , occupied and occupied with a priest , remained the owner of this church and could also inher@@ it this Church . &quot;
&quot; in this way , the right to use a priest or to propose a new priest to the bishop . &quot;
there were three alt@@ ars in the church and two bells on the tower .
the elder of the two bar@@ rows at Christmas 16@@ 73 .
&quot; the newly created bell rang the first time in 16@@ 92 , but had to be released later during the Second World War in 1942 . &quot;
in the 30 @-@ year @-@ old war ( 16@@ 16 to 16@@ 48 ) the windows were carved and the bells were stolen .
the roof was le@@ aking .
in 17@@ 96 French troops enc@@ amped close to the church .
they removed the pul@@ pit and church chairs and used them as fire@@ wood .
remains of the church threatened in 18@@ 09 .
&quot; until 1869 , the Tum@@ lingen Hil@@ arius cemetery served as the last resting place for the dead from Hör@@ schwei@@ ler . &quot;
in 18@@ 23 the cemetery was extended and the Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kirche ab@@ orted .
only the Kir@@ cht@@ ur@@ m had to be stopped .
&quot; in the New Year &apos;s Night in 18@@ 34 , a storm split the church tower and half of it crashed . &quot;
&quot; to prevent mis@@ fortune , the tower was dem@@ ol@@ ished . &quot;
only the tower of today still existing tower was preserved as a witness to the 750 @-@ year @-@ old church history .
&quot; today Horst K@@ allen@@ berger and Rolf @-@ Dieter Was@@ em cultivate the Hil@@ arius @-@ plant by the &quot; &quot; Schaff@@ hausen Pension@@ ers &quot; &quot; as successor of Dieter Do@@ ck@@ horn . &quot;
&quot; the organis@@ ers invite the friends and promot@@ ers of Tum@@ lin@@ ens on Sunday , 16 July , to the sixth ser@@ en@@ ade to the old cemetery to St. Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kap@@ elle . &quot;
this is designed by the com@@ bo of the Ke@@ pler @-@ Gymnasium Freuden@@ stadt and with essays by Kurt Kü@@ bler and Rein@@ hold Mat@@ tei@@ s .

the ser@@ en@@ ade occurs only in dry weather .
the organis@@ ers hope to receive many supporters for the preservation of the historic St. Hil@@ arius facility that is of importance for Tum@@ lingen and Hör@@ schwei@@ ler .
the friends and promot@@ ers of tum@@ ours feel particularly committed to home care such as Walter Mart@@ ini &apos;s ser@@ en@@ ade organis@@ er .
association wants to verify the approval of wind turbines
&quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim def@@ ends itself &quot; &quot; does not look any legal pre@@ condition for the construction and has therefore turned to the Council . &quot;
the association &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim def@@ enses &quot; has called Land@@ rat Andreas Co@@ enen ( CD@@ U ) to withdraw its approval for the construction of planned wind turbines in the Bo@@ is@@ heimer N@@ ette .
it is illegal .
&quot; the association ar@@ gues that at the time of approval on December 30 , 2016 , no wind turbines could have been approved at the Bo@@ is@@ heimer N@@ ette , as at the time in Vier@@ sen only a wind @-@ force concentration zone existed at the border to Schwal@@ m@@ tal . &quot;
&quot; within this concentration zone , construction and operation of wind turbines are generally possible , but at the same time the concentration zone causes a exclusion of wind energy use for the rest of the city . &quot;
such zones are to prevent a &quot; spar@@ ing &quot; of the landscape .
&quot; the city of Vier@@ sen had decided a second wind power concentration zone in the Bo@@ is@@ heimer N@@ ette a few days earlier , but the district government Dus@@ sel@@ dorf did not appro@@ ve because of a format@@ ting . &quot;
&quot; due to the lack of planning legal requirements , the granted approval is still un@@ lawful and therefore rec@@ u@@ per@@ ated , &quot; &quot; said Christoph Er@@ k@@ ens , Chairman of Bo@@ is@@ heim . &quot;
current state of affairs : the city council has once again decided to re @-@ establish the wind concentration zone in the Bo@@ is@@ heimer N@@ ette before the summer break ; a permit from the district government is still pending .
&quot; Er@@ k@@ ens : &quot; &quot; at this point the issu@@ ance of a permit for the establishment of wind turbines is legally excluded . &quot;
the circle confirms the entrance of the invitation .
&quot; the corresponding letters have been entered the circle of Vier@@ sen since last week , &quot; &quot; declared a spokes@@ man . &quot;
the circle takes her on the occasion to re @-@ examine the matter again .
but they do not expect the procedure to be stopped .
&quot; with regard to ongoing proceedings at the Administr@@ ative Court , the circle on Thursday did not want to express itself in terms of the argum@@ entation of the &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim &quot; association . &quot;
&quot; the NEW Re , a subsidiary of the NEW , plans to build four 200 metres high wind turbines on an area at Bo@@ is@@ heimer N@@ ette . &quot;
&quot; last year , the company , in which the city of Vier@@ sen is indirectly involved , has closed lease agreements with the owner of the approximately 65 hectares of large terrain . &quot;
&quot; with the construction of the four wind turbines , the power requirement of around 11 400 households should be covered - this corresponds to approximately one fifth of the power requirement of all four @-@ year households . &quot;
the NEW re wants to invest some 20 million euros .
&quot; last summer , Vier@@ sen City Council gave green light for the purchase of three wind turbines at the Lin@@ ni@@ ch wind park near Aachen , as well as a participation in a wind turbine plant in Ü@@ bach @-@ Pal@@ enberg in Hein@@ sberg District . &quot;
Auto and tractor crash together : woman dies at a terrible accident
one terrible traffic accident happened on Friday morning at 10@@ am on the L 333 between Nieder@@ wall@@ men@@ ach and Bo@@ gel ( Rhine @-@ L@@ ahn @-@ Kreis ) .
a woman was killed in a deadly accident .
two more people were injured .
the state road remained closed for hours .
&quot; according to police data , a 17 @-@ year @-@ old girl from Bor@@ ni@@ ch visited the L 333 in the direction of Bo@@ gel with her passenger car as a companion . &quot;
city and dealer are planning &quot; home @-@ shopping &quot; weekend
&quot; in September , Bad Langen@@ salz@@ aer and people from the region will re@@ discover the shopping opportunities in the city centre in September . &quot;
the commercial association and municipal administration want to use the weekend on 8 and 9 September to enti@@ ce the residents to the shopping spre@@ e in the city center .
&quot; as the chairman of the trade association , Christian König , announced that the &quot; home @-@ shopping &quot; weekend will sensi@@ ti@@ ze the customers , which offers their own city away from the usual supermarket goods . &quot;
&quot; therefore , a market with regional suppliers is planned , similar to the weekly market . &quot;
&quot; in addition , local companies should present themselves with their apprentic@@ eship places . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the shops of the downtown should invite to the &quot; &quot; midnight shopping &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in doing so , the action is not only aimed at residents of the city and the nearby region . &quot;
&quot; in preparation , advertising spots on the radio , an internet video and printed bags , which point to the action weekend , says Christian König . &quot;
municipal administration and commercial association cooperate with the Chamber of Commerce and Industry .
&quot; thus , the commercial association and the city enter a further stage of the project &quot; Attra@@ ctive city center . &quot; &quot;
&quot; this includes new offers such as the first &quot; &quot; Active Day &quot; &quot; to the well @-@ held Sunday , talks with all retailers and hosts to move them to active participation . &quot;
also attractive offers for Saturday and the wai@@ ver of parking fees on this day are part of the concept .
&quot; in addition , customer potenti@@ als should be re @-@ opened or re @-@ opened . &quot;
these include spa guests and tourists .
but also many locals would have lost the city centre during shopping .
&quot; in the end , everyone would have to contribute to revi@@ ving the city centre - to land@@ lords , the factories of the whole city and clubs . &quot;
&quot; it was to overcome the le@@ th@@ ar@@ gy with a network , which took part in part , had said in the spring . &quot;
&quot; Birgit St@@ reich , Head of the Chamber of Commerce in Müh@@ l@@ hausen , reported that the third &quot; &quot; home @-@ shopping &quot; &quot; in the country was the first time to take part in five Thuring@@ ian cities for the first time . &quot;
&quot; beside Bad Langen@@ sal@@ za these are Weimar , S@@ ö@@ mmer@@ da , Heiligen@@ stadt and Blei@@ cher@@ ode . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the day should promote the appreciation of local commerce and raise its significance for the common good of our cities , &quot; &quot; says St@@ reich . &quot;
the action under the leadership of the Chamber of Commerce of the Chamber of Commerce and with many partners also makes it clear that every citizen can influence his direct environment .

Tr@@ ump translated according to le@@ ased tran@@ scription of phone calls Mexico under pressure due to the payment of the boundary wall
telephone calls between US President Donald Tr@@ ump and Le@@ aders of Mexico and Australia were published by the Washington Post .
&quot; on 27 January Tr@@ ump requested a call with Mexican President En@@ ri@@ que P@@ ena N@@ ie@@ to , to say publicly that he would not pay for a planned border wall . &quot;
&quot; the US president vacc@@ inated him , because he publicly den@@ ounced the wall . report@@ edly , he said to him , &quot; &quot; You can &apos;t tell the press . &quot;
&quot; Tr@@ ump started his presidential campaign with the promise to build a wall at the southern border of the USA , and s@@ wore to pay Mexico for the project . &quot;
tran@@ scription of his first call with Australian Prime Minister Mal@@ col@@ m Turn@@ bull were also published and revealed a ten@@ se exchange .
&quot; Mr. Tr@@ ump told Mr. Turn@@ bull that a trade for the US emig@@ rated to Australia , &quot; &quot; ridi@@ culous , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; bad &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; stupid &quot; &quot; and that the existence on the trade that was adopted by the Obama administration would make him look like a &quot; &quot; de@@ pot &quot; &quot; after he had proposed a ban on the res@@ ett@@ lement of refugees to the United States . &quot;
Mr. Tr@@ ump finished the call after he said Mr Turn@@ bull : &quot; this is the most unpleasant call for the whole day .
Mo@@ ores Ford massacre : activists run rac@@ ist Lyn@@ ch@@ act as a call for justice
&quot; a 1948 @-@ 1948 Ford Mer@@ cury passed through a group of viewers in Mon@@ roe , Georgia , shr@@ inking on the Ford Bridge by Moore . &quot;
&quot; before the car , the four black passengers and a white rider , had reached the bridge , a group of white men came out with guns to block his way . &quot;
the leader of the M@@ ob@@ s - a middle aged man in a needle stri@@ pe - took a long train at his c@@ ig@@ ar and looked at the wind@@ screen .
inside the in@@ mates floating in fear .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we want this n ---- r Roger ! &quot; &quot; the man bro@@ o@@ ds . &quot;
&quot; get him out of the car ! &quot;
&quot; scre@@ aming the silence , when a young black man was drag@@ ged from the passenger seat . &quot;
&quot; fortunately , this terrible scene , played on 22 July , is just one night . &quot;
&quot; but when a loop is thrown around the neck of &quot; &quot; Roger &quot; , &quot; almost everyone in the audience had a very real si@@ gh . &quot;
&quot; since 2005 , civi@@ c lawyers have come back to Moore &apos;s Ford Bridge to im@@ itate the night in which two black couples - Roger and Dor@@ othy Mal@@ com and George and Ma@@ e Murray Dor@@ sey - were born by K@@ u Klu@@ x Kl@@ an in 1946 . &quot;
no one was ever accused of murder .
&quot; it is really in@@ comprehen@@ sible that in all these years no single person was arrested - although we see them in our communities , although we know who they are , &quot; &quot; said Ty@@ rone Broo@@ ks , who helps in organizing the night . &quot;
&quot; it is a dirt spot on a story , but it is a burden for our souls . &quot;
Broo@@ ks is a 71 @-@ year old former gres@@ sman of Georgia and a life long civil rights lawyer .
&quot; for him , it serves as a dramatic appeal to action and represents an annual memory of the Mon@@ roe community that injustice has never been corrected . &quot;
&quot; we want to prosec@@ ute , we want to end , we want healing , we want reconciliation , but first we must obtain justice , &quot; he said . &quot;
we cannot get to heal and reconciliation until we get justice .
a court physician puts a blan@@ ket on the body of one of the victims of the Moore @-@ Ford @-@ Lyn@@ chens on 27 July 1946 .
&quot; according to F@@ BI files received by N@@ BC News , more than 50 men from Mon@@ roe and surrounding Gra@@ f@@ ties were suspected in the Lyn@@ ch@@ process . &quot;
but no one was ever accused .
&quot; although the susp@@ ects remain on the loose base for decades , citizens say that the double motivation for the Lyn@@ ch actions throughout the city was always known : politics and sex . &quot;
&quot; in April 1946 , a decision of the Supreme Court of Justice allowed the black citizens in Georgia for the first time to vote their vote in summer . &quot;
&quot; approximately at the same time as the choice st@@ ach according to the F@@ BI of black colour guards Roger Mal@@ com , a white land@@ owner , Bar@@ nett H@@ ester , settled during a fight - allegedly because of a woman . &quot;
&quot; Broo@@ ks said that rum@@ our was in the city that H@@ ester slept with Mal@@ com@@ s wife Dor@@ othy , and that the baby she wore not from her husband was . &quot;
&quot; on 25 July 1946 Lo@@ y Har@@ rison , a prominent white land@@ owner , paid 600 dollars to free Mal@@ com from prison , so the F@@ BI . &quot;
he was accompanied by Dor@@ othy and her c@@ ous@@ ins Ma@@ e Murray and George Dor@@ sey .
&quot; but when they came from prison and the Moore &apos;s Ford Bridge approached , a Lyn@@ ch@@ mo@@ b surrounded the car ring@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; as it turns out , Har@@ rison , who has prepared and arranged Mor@@ de , conclu@@ des a F@@ BI report . &quot;
&quot; it is also obvious that there was a conspiracy between the state and local prosecution , which was not only involved in the mur@@ ders , removed evi@@ den@@ ces and has tu@@ cked the identity of witnesses . &quot;
Broo@@ ks form@@ ulates it even more conc@@ ise .
&quot; it was an electoral law massacre , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; you were all killed to send a message to black people in this community : &quot; &quot; if you register and if you vote , this will happen here . &quot;
&quot; for almost a decade , Cass@@ andra Gre@@ ene conducted the annual post @-@ presentation of Moore Ford Bridge Lyn@@ ch @-@ Mor@@ de . &quot;
&quot; her portra@@ yal is clear , po@@ ign@@ ant , and is rooted in a kind of deep rac@@ ism that many want to believe that he no longer exists in America . &quot;
&quot; it is hard to watch , and even more difficult to look away , but Gre@@ ene said that that is the point . &quot;
&quot; we don &apos;t want to talk about the Lyn@@ chen because we are confronted with his ug@@ liness in all of us , &quot; she said . &quot;
but I cannot build a relationship with you if you don &apos;t want to listen to me or do not want to hear what I have done .
&quot; the rehear@@ sals for this year &apos;s production began in June , and on the first day nearly 30 actors - a dozen White and the Rest Black - pushed into a room and listened to as Gre@@ ene a well @-@ played overview over the piece started . &quot;
W@@ ade Mar@@ bau@@ gh is here Gre@@ ene Co @-@ director .
&quot; he has played the role of the chief clan member for years , but he said that the role will never be easier . &quot;
&quot; I feel dirty because I am not so , &quot; &quot; said Mar@@ bau@@ gh . &quot;
but I think it &apos;s very important to keep this story alive because we don &apos;t want to return to these times .
&quot; on the other side of the room , the actors Dar@@ rius Brad@@ sha@@ w and Nick Ras@@ cona , who play Roger Mal@@ com and Bar@@ nett H@@ ester , tried their lines . &quot;
&quot; the piece starts with Mal@@ com , who sham@@ eless@@ ly scre@@ ams and ur@@ ges him , angry that he slept with his wife Dor@@ othy . &quot;
&quot; I said , n --- he , van@@ ish from my property ! &quot;
An@@ cona res@@ ists the fire .
there is a break .
and then everyone ( at least all black actors ) breaks into laughter .
Gre@@ ene laugh@@ s at the lou@@ dest .
&quot; what ? ! , &quot; asked Ras@@ cona . &quot;
he is al@@ armed and confused .
was I too hard ?
&quot; no , &quot; Gre@@ ene said , still gig@@ gling . &quot;
I simply don &apos;t think white people back then &apos; n --- he &apos; said .
&quot; but , &quot; one of the other black actors wit@@ ches . &quot;
&quot; you just have to hit the hard &quot; &quot; R. &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; and exactly there shifts the energy in space , a sense of com@@ rade replaces the dis@@ comfort . &quot;
&quot; everyone is busy making this right , not just because of the game , but also because of the memory of the four killed people . &quot;
the scene starts again .
&quot; this time Ras@@ cona says the N @-@ word , he says it sharp@@ ly and with im@@ print . &quot;
absolutely no one laugh@@ s .
this re@@ petition ends violent and fast .
&quot; there are scre@@ ams , shots and then silence . &quot;
&quot; a woman , dressed with a gri@@ ef dress , stands above the cor@@ p@@ ses of the actors and performs Bil@@ lie Holidays &quot; &quot; St@@ range Fruit &quot; . &quot; &quot;
your voice breaks in every second word .
about a hundred meters behind it a group of about four dozen viewers wi@@ pes sweat and tears from the eyes .
the audience is divided almost equally between black and white .
&quot; a couple is from I@@ th@@ aca , New York , travelled to see the performance , many come down only the street . &quot;
they have experienced Georgi@@ as op@@ pres@@ sive moisture for nearly eight hours when Broo@@ ks leads them on a pilgrimage to the burial sites of the Mal@@ com@@ s and Dor@@ se@@ ys .
&quot; until this point , the mur@@ ders have remained an an@@ ec@@ d@@ ote , but now when you stand on the same country where the Lyn@@ ch Mor@@ de took place , the air feels sp@@ ook@@ y . &quot;
&quot; when the last notes of the song sound , Gre@@ ene invites the crowd to come closer and insp@@ ect the cor@@ p@@ se . &quot;
&quot; children can ho@@ ck on their heads , register the fake blood and the silent body and whis@@ per each other . &quot;
&quot; they are not really dead , &quot; he mur@@ m@@ urs a little boy as if he wanted to remember . &quot;
after a few minutes Gre@@ ene thanks the crowd - and suddenly it is over .
the actors throw away the Lyn@@ ch rope and wi@@ pe off their tears .
&quot; Brad@@ sha@@ w um@@ ar@@ mt Mar@@ bau@@ gh , the man in suit , who played the clan member . &quot;
&quot; Nick R@@ cona hu@@ gs two of his fellow players and then breaks down in their arms , the emotional burden of the performance finally breaks out with him . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s okay , &quot; one of the women whis@@ pers . &quot;
we know that this is not in your heart .
you have done this for one reason .
later the audience sat together with the actors for dinner .
&quot; at a table , a white pair of atlanta chat@@ ted about the night position with a black pair they just met . &quot;
Den@@ ise Du@@ pl@@ inski has strug@@ gl@@ ed to find words that has left the performance .
&quot; it is hard to hear these terrible words and deeds ... to come from people that look like you and they do that because they look like you , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; what this really does with me makes me believe that the Lyn@@ ch is still going on , &quot; she added , &quot; today it is called the only police shooting . &quot;
&quot; in the same room , Ty@@ rone Broo@@ ks holds court at his table , he e@@ ats and rec@@ alls the civil rights . &quot;
he said he started planning the performance next year .
&quot; the post is in a way inspiring because it describes the horror of what we have en@@ du@@ red , but it is also a moment of learning , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; it is like we learn nothing from it , then it can happen again . &quot;
&quot; whoever does not study his own history , who does not know his own history , is condemned to repeat it . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Göt@@ ter@@ d@@ ämmerung &quot; &quot; reconc@@ iled the W@@ agn@@ eri@@ ans in Bay@@ reuth &quot;
&quot; in the fourth part of Richard Wagner &apos;s monumental work , director Frank Cast@@ orf plays a colorful @-@ fri@@ vol@@ e st@@ aging front of a gigantic , six @-@ story backdrop . &quot;
&quot; the revol@@ ving stage ( designed by Aleks@@ and@@ ar Den@@ ic ) shows an optional street corner with a laying rest and D@@ ön@@ er@@ bu@@ de in Berlin , a &quot; &quot; Pla@@ ste and Ela@@ ste &quot; &quot; logo of G@@ DR times or the New York Stock Exchange . &quot;
&quot; prior to that , an open Mercedes classic car , in which the Rhein@@ mort@@ chter will pose as Rock@@ erg@@ ir@@ ls , or alternatively a Is@@ etta . &quot;
&quot; st@@ acked oil barrels are reminis@@ cent of Cast@@ or@@ fs Leit@@ moti@@ v - money , power and gre@@ ed - that moves through its &quot; &quot; Ring &quot; &quot; st@@ aging . &quot;
&quot; the three Rhein@@ mort@@ chter - sung by Steph@@ anie Hou@@ tz@@ e@@ el , Wi@@ eb@@ ke L@@ ehm@@ ku@@ hl and Alexandra St@@ einer - harmon@@ ize like already in &quot; Rhein@@ gold . &quot; &quot;

later also Gun@@ ther ( Markus Oak ) has to believe in it .
the audience would like to thank the ensemble with a strong appl@@ ause .
&quot; Fo@@ ster , M@@ illing , Vin@@ ke and Con@@ duc@@ tor Jan@@ owski are celebrated stor@@ my . &quot;
&quot; there are big appl@@ ause for the Festival Orchestra , which shows for the first time on stage - in view of the great heat again in casual leisure wear . &quot;
the performance was awa@@ ited by Frank Cast@@ orf and his team of directors .
&quot; in 2013 he had to leave a rolling whi@@ stle conc@@ erto on himself in 2013 , there were five years later great rejo@@ icing in which the &quot; &quot; Bu@@ h &quot; &quot; calls went underground . &quot;
Fest@@ spiel@@ ch@@ ef@@ in Katharina Wagner is likely to be pleased about this .
&quot; one not@@ ices that the audience has grown together with the &quot; &quot; Ring &quot; &quot; in a certain way , &quot; &quot; she said shortly before the performance of the dpa . &quot;
&quot; the public has not only made a form of peace with Cast@@ orf , but also an understanding of its way of view . &quot;
I draw a positive conclusion .
max quantity works as a volunteer
they work in their volunteer year right at several places .
where to go anywhere ?
&quot; quantity : normally in Stein@@ furt in the Fur@@ niture Market , once a week I will help in Gre@@ ven in the furniture bridge . &quot;
and I also worked on the school in the open whole day .
how are your experiences with it ?
&quot; a lot : it &apos;s a nice , broad spectrum that I see here . &quot;
&quot; I have to do with different people , with young people , with refugees , with young adults . &quot;
&quot; they are now 26 years , so a late @-@ time volunteer . &quot;
how does it come about ?
amount : I did Ab@@ it@@ ur .
&quot; and then a building engineer , let &apos;s say , successfully ab@@ orted . &quot;
&quot; for me , I realized that it is the fal@@ seh@@ ood for me and I want to do something else , work with people . &quot;
&quot; and then I asked myself , what do you do . &quot;
&quot; do a social year , there is an insight , there you can see how it is on site , in the burning point perhaps , really . &quot;
and was it like that ?
amount : I collected great impressions .
I will start my studies in social affairs in the winter semester .
&quot; I will study dual , probably at the Ju@@ gen@@ dam@@ t Her@@ ne , do a social worker training and study in Ham@@ m at the University of Applied Sciences . &quot;
is it not unusual to have several different locations during the volunteer service ?
&quot; quantity : yes , it is very variable . &quot;
probably it always depends on where you are going to be FS@@ J .
it is possible to make it from Alter@@ sheim to youth work - in all possible fac@@ ets of social work .
&quot; with me , it was very varied . &quot;
&quot; I was also partly in the O@@ GS , so in the afternoon care . &quot;
for me it was just the right thing that irrit@@ ated me .
I could see and see my own strengths and see how it really runs out .
different than in civil engineering studies ?
&quot; lot : well , here it is not about calcul@@ ating St@@ ati@@ tudes . &quot;
there are always other people who have a completely different story behind them .
&quot; whether a refugee , a teen@@ ager , who has been fet@@ ched out of the family - you must always go into it individually . &quot;
very interesting .
and you had no reservations ?
quantity : I am not the type .
it is an area that gives a lot .
&quot; much love , lots of kindness . &quot;
&quot; there are also negative moments , but that &apos;s how life is . &quot;
&quot; Pear@@ son short@@ ens another 3,000 jobs and short@@ ens the divi@@ dend to revi@@ ve business &quot;
&quot; the British education group Pear@@ son said on Friday , it will reduce further 3,000 jobs and reduce its divi@@ dend by 72 percent since another restructuring program will be launched to overcome the pressure that the company has to face . &quot;
&quot; in addition to its previous restructuring , the deputy director John Fall@@ on joined the deputy director , John Fall@@ on , in addition to its previous restructuring , where 4.000 jobs have already been lost . &quot;
Pear@@ son announced a plan for cost reduction by another 300 million pounds ( 394 million US dollars ) in May in a third cost reduction program to revi@@ ve a business that was hit by the fast pace to digital learning .

con@@ voy of Kab@@ ul : NATO soldier killed in suicide bom@@ bing
&quot; a suicide bom@@ ber attacked a military con@@ voy in Kab@@ ul in the Afgh@@ an capital , killed a NATO soldier and injured several others , said officials . &quot;
five soldiers and an interpre@@ ter were injured .
&quot; according to local reports , three civilians died in the incident in the Q@@ arab@@ ag@@ h district . &quot;
the bom@@ bing is the last violence that Afghanistan hit this month - on Tuesday more than 30 people were killed in a mos@@ que in Her@@ at .
on Monday a suicide bom@@ ber killed two people near the Iraqi emb@@ assy in Kab@@ ul .
&quot; in an opinion of N@@ ato , it is said that the explosion happened on Thursday evening when a joint pat@@ rol with the Afgh@@ an army was attacked by an impro@@ vised explosive . &quot;
the statement says that all injured are in a stable state and treated in the US military hospital at Bag@@ ram airport .
&quot; correspon@@ dents say that the growing strength of the Taliban and the group , known as the so @-@ called Islamic State ( IS ) in Q@@ arab@@ ag@@ h , is a great concern for NATO troops in the nearby Bag@@ ram . &quot;
&quot; according to the United Nations , there were at least 1,6@@ 62 civilian deaths in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017 , about 20 % in the capital . &quot;
at the end of July a suicide car bomb killed at least 30 people in a chi@@ i@@ tic district of Kab@@ ul .
the Taliban said they had done this attack .
&quot; on May 31 , a massive bom@@ bing in the centre of the city killed more than 150 people with the deadly milit@@ ant attack of the country , since the US @-@ led troops in 2001 pushed the Taliban out of power . &quot;
&quot; the violence under@@ lines the prec@@ ari@@ ous security situation in Afghanistan , as U.S. President Donald Tr@@ ump is considering the number of U.S. troops to support the military and police in the country . &quot;
&quot; correspon@@ dents say that the suicide bom@@ bers in Kab@@ ul have also caused a crisis of public trust in the government , their policies , and especially in the call of President Ash@@ ra@@ f Gh@@ ani . &quot;
EPA returns decision to delay the smo@@ g rule according to law@@ suits
&quot; the U.S. environmental protection authority has made a decision to delay the regulation of the government of Obama , according to which the states are obliged to cur@@ b the smo@@ g @-@ causing emissions . this happened a day after 15 States def@@ ected the Agency because of the step . &quot;
&quot; the EPA announced the decision on Wednesday late on Wednesday to advance the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; Oz@@ on@@ ciliation 2015 &quot; &quot; and show that they show the obligation of the Agency to cooperate with states . &quot;
&quot; we believe in dialogue with and that we respond to our state partners , &quot; said EPA boss Scott P@@ ru@@ itt in an explanation . &quot;
&quot; P@@ ru@@ itt had announced the EPA &apos;s intention in June , the o@@ zone regulations - in which poll@@ ut@@ ant emissions are to be measured in a part of the country to determine where cuts must be made to delay stric@@ ter air quality standards - to delay one year by October 2018 . &quot;
&quot; a group of 15 mostly democratic states , along with Colombia &apos;s district , filed suit on Tuesday and said that the effort was illegal . &quot;
&quot; the government of President Donald Tr@@ ump has tried to return a wide range of environmental conditions imposed by former President Barack Obama , as part of a broader agenda that should boost economic growth according to Tr@@ ump . &quot;
&quot; however , efforts have caused the back@@ lash of democr@@ ats and nature conservation groups concerned about the impact of major emissions on public health . &quot;
&quot; the EPA website says that inhal@@ ing air that contains o@@ zone contains &quot; &quot; reduce lung function and rein@@ force respiratory symptoms &quot; &quot; such as as@@ thma . &quot;
community council wants common room
&quot; in the end , the decision was clear : with two counter @-@ votes , the municipal council of Flu@@ orn @-@ Win@@ s decides to set up a joint venture in the future retirement community . &quot;
&quot; before the discussion , there is an important information : the purchase agreement for the missing land part is signed , reports mayor Bernhard T@@ j@@ aden . &quot;
&quot; although it is still going to last until the area of church belonging to the church is in municipal ownership , there is now no planning permission for the project stem@@ ming from a private investor . &quot;
&quot; for this , there is a discussion regarding a common space . &quot;
&quot; one of the two investors still in the boat , offered to meet the community . &quot;
&quot; on the ground floor , it would provide a living space - approximately 55 square meters - and an adjacent terrace with a total of 70 square meters for a special price . &quot;
&quot; the administration and majority of the municipal council is ho@@ ver@@ ing , such a common area just not as a meeting point for the residents of the sen@@ i@@ or@@ en@@ just living , but openly in the congregation . &quot;
&quot; as an example , the word &quot; &quot; Stri@@ ck@@ café &quot; &quot; made the round . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the decision which has been decided by the provision of funds for the current budget has already been decided last autumn by means of funding . &quot;
the construction is in the refurbis@@ hment area .
&quot; the establishment of a communal space would be , thus , T@@ j@@ aden reports , with 60 percent of 30 percent con@@ du@@ ci@@ ve . &quot;
&quot; the proposed resolution is to indicate the investor that in this respect one wants to throw no b@@ ill@@ ets between the legs , stating that both saddle - what is le@@ aning against ambient construction - as well as the roof @-@ roof - which reduces the height of the height and makes the construction more cost @-@ effective - as far as possible . &quot;
&quot; need@@ less to say , that &apos;s not just Wil@@ fried Soh@@ mer , be this addi@@ tive . &quot;
if it helps : unanim@@ ously he passes the body .
it is not as easy as the common room .
&quot; Daniela &apos;s reputation refers to the many of its own buildings , with which you don &apos;t get so right , for that you are now in the shared lounge out of the window , she says : &quot; I &apos;m hard with it . &quot;
&quot; Y@@ vonne Sta@@ iger is absolutely speaking of the common room , but absolutely against a municipal participation . &quot;
it sees behind it a cover@@ t subsi@@ dy in any case of wealthy or even foreign investors .
&quot; this is not the case , as with the acquisition of the area there is no allowance , but get a real , in doubt a market@@ able counter @-@ value , is the counter @-@ speech . &quot;
&quot; the applicant &apos;s request , to ple@@ ad the proposed resolution , finds three advoc@@ ates . &quot;
&quot; in this way , there remains two counter @-@ voices in the original program that Stefan H@@ aller summar@@ izes : &quot; if we summar@@ ize the decision , we make a giant leap to close a huge gap in our infrastructure . &quot;
col@@ lision with auto : Rad@@ ler is thrown on road
&quot; when crossing the road , a 82 @-@ year @-@ old cycl@@ ist was captured by a car on Wednesday in Gar@@ ath . &quot;
&quot; as the police ha@@ sten@@ ed , the 82 @-@ year @-@ old Langen@@ felder was on the road by 12.@@ 20 o &apos;clock with his bike on the bike path of the road Schwar@@ zer Weg towards Hil@@ den . &quot;
the senior wanted to cross the road to the Buch@@ hol@@ zer Busch road .
&quot; in the same direction , passenger car drivers granted him priority . &quot;
&quot; when the Langen@@ felder drove to the street , he obviously didn &apos;t care about the traffic . &quot;
he joined together with a car that was a 66 @-@ year @-@ old assistant .
the man was thrown onto the street .
he suffered severe injuries and was brought into a hospital with a retreat .

the Super@@ cup takes place without him : David Al@@ aba must su@@ ck the game against Dortmund .
&quot; with personnel care , FC Bayern will travel to Dortmund for the first mandatory game of the new season . &quot;
seven professionals are missing the title def@@ ender in the Super@@ cup against the cup winner .
personnel take care of the German soccer @-@ record champion Bayern München are getting bigger in front of the Super@@ cup on Saturday ( 20.@@ 30 p.m. / ZDF and Euro@@ sport ) at Po@@ kal@@ si@@ eger Bor@@ us@@ sia Dortmund .
trainer Carlo An@@ cel@@ otti has to do without the BV@@ B also on David Al@@ aba .
this was confirmed by the Itali@@ ans on Friday .
&quot; the mou@@ ch@@ men Manuel Neu@@ er , James , Thi@@ ago , Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng , Ar@@ j@@ en Rob@@ ben and Juan Bern@@ at are missing . &quot;
&quot; for the five defe@@ ats over the past six years , An@@ cel@@ otti has held responsible physical condition and the lack of balance in the game of his team . &quot;
&quot; we know that we are not in the best physical condition , &quot; &quot; said An@@ cel@@ otti and added : &quot; &quot; the most important point is balance in the team . &quot;
&quot; last but not least , it was not good . &quot;
but the 58 @-@ year @-@ old believes in an increase in performance in the first official game of the season .
&quot; football is also tac@@ tic , strategy , personality and motivation . &quot;
I have great confidence that my team shows these qualities .
the team is ready .
&quot; we want to play smart , &quot; said An@@ cel@@ otti , who expects a &quot; difficult , intense game . &quot; &quot;
the du@@ el of the two German football heav@@ y@@ weights attracts the fans in their spell .
&quot; the game is sold out with 8@@ 1,@@ 360 spectators , distributed the Deutsche Fußball League ( DF@@ L ) on Friday . &quot;
in the Harz Mountains w@@ ander to star
&quot; in the Harz Mountains , the country &apos;s first &quot; &quot; star trail &quot; &quot; is to be created . &quot;
this is planned by the association Ob@@ servatory St. Andre@@ as@@ berg .
there is a planetary way in Göttingen - since 2003 .
&quot; a &quot; &quot; star trail &quot; &quot; can be met to the information needs of many Har@@ z@@ visitors , it was called . &quot;
&quot; it combines nature , science , movement and athle@@ tic performance . &quot;
the members want to put boards along the planned route and inform about stars and stars .
&quot; in a first phase until 2018 , the association is planning &quot; well accessible installations at five to six locations &quot; in Ober@@ har@@ z . &quot;
&quot; St. Andre@@ as@@ berg , Braun@@ lage , Hoh@@ eg@@ ei@@ ß and Si@@ eber . &quot;
the information on the tables should be supple@@ mented by internet .
&quot; therefore , a good mobile phone reception plays a role in choosing a location choice . &quot;
accessibility is a crit@@ erion .
&quot; later , the path of the star trail is to be expanded by train . &quot;
&quot; on the star trail visitors learn a lot of worth knowing , for example about the physics of the individual stars , &quot; explained the association . &quot;
&quot; in addition , they learned why stars would have different colors or why a star lighter than another one , even though it is much further away . &quot;
&quot; also , in which star @-@ picture is a selected star , and when it is best to be seen . &quot;
&quot; since 2014 , the association has been operating at the Berg@@ städ@@ tchen St Andre@@ as@@ berg , the highest observ@@ atory in Northern Germany . &quot;
&quot; according to the Federal Office for Nature Conservation , the location in the middle of the Harz National Park is one of the six dark@@ est regions in Germany . &quot;
often from there the Mil@@ ky Way and even the Andro@@ med@@ a galax@@ y with naked eye can be seen clearly .
&quot; since 2003 , there has been a little similar to the planned Stern@@ en@@ wer@@ g - the planet path@@ way since 2003 on the initiative of the Förder@@ verein Planet@@ arium Göttingen . &quot;
&quot; beginning in front of Geb@@ hard Hotel in the Goe@@ the@@ alle@@ e , which forms the interior of our solar system , the planet path@@ way leads up to Hain@@ berg and to the observ@@ atory - as well as an &quot; extra @-@ terrestrial &quot; site in Di@@ em@@ arden ( municipality Glei@@ chen ) with the planet Sed@@ na . &quot;
the stel@@ ae with the individual planets - including the d@@ warf @-@ planets degra@@ ded Plu@@ to at the end point - are positioned exactly at the distance and scale of one to two billion .
&quot; the earth shr@@ inks to a sphere of 6,5 mil@@ lim@@ eter diameter , while the sun is exactly 75 metres away , at least 70 centimet@@ res . &quot;
the entire distance of the planet path is about four kilometers .
&quot; while the light from sun to the Plu@@ to requires about eight hours , pedestri@@ ans need a good hour to the st@@ ele with Plu@@ to . &quot;
pedestri@@ ans are therefore faster than the light in the universe .
&quot; the march to the next fix@@ ture , however , would last a half year . &quot;
Mi@@ key Gar@@ cia and Vas@@ yl Lom@@ ach@@ enko meet for the first time discussing a possible show@@ down
&quot; Vas@@ yl Lom@@ ach@@ enko and Mi@@ key Gar@@ cia , who were to stand in a col@@ lision course to stage the most exciting competition in the near future under 147 pounds , met for the first time on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; they were in separate rooms at ES@@ PN offices in Los Angeles , until Gar@@ cia , the unbe@@ aten World Box@@ ing Council lightweight champion , going down the hall@@ way to greet Lom@@ ach@@ enko , the World Box@@ ing Organisation Super Feder@@ weight Champion . &quot;
&quot; after Gar@@ cia &apos;s victory through unanim@@ ous decision on the former four @-@ divisions World Champion Adri@@ en Bron@@ er on Saturday at Show@@ time , both fighters are members of the Top Five Po@@ und @-@ for Po@@ und @-@ List . &quot;
&quot; Gar@@ cia stretched out the right hand and said , &quot; How are you getting Champion ? &quot;
I wish you a lot of luck . &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ enko def@@ ends his belt against Miguel Marri@@ aga on Saturday night at 7 p.m. on ES@@ PN .
&quot; as the pair pos@@ ing for photos , Lom@@ ach@@ enko Manager Eg@@ is Klim@@ as noted that a possible show@@ down between the fighters would be the &quot; perfect size . &quot; &quot;
&quot; I am a former feather @-@ weight , &quot; reminded Gar@@ cia . &quot;
&quot; I grew up for Bron@@ er &#91; to 140 pounds &#93; , but I am not so big . &quot;
I am small for 140 .
I would like to come down to light weight .
and he has to move to light weight &#91; 135 pounds &#93; and then we fight .
this is what the fans demand .
let us give them this . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Lom@@ ach@@ enko &quot; &quot; agreed . &quot;
&quot; boxing needs this fight . &quot;
&quot; Klim@@ as asked if it was to be on pay @-@ per @-@ View , part of a strategy that Lom@@ ach@@ enko must fight with a 135 po@@ und debut in this year to arrange a date in the next summer with Gar@@ cia ( 37 @-@ 0 , 30 kno@@ ck@@ outs ) who also interest in the fight against the winner of Jorge Lin@@ ares @-@ Luke Camp@@ bell after their light weight title battle in the Forum on September 23 . &quot;
&quot; this fight could take place in the pay @-@ per @-@ view mode because all the fans asked him , &quot; &quot; Gar@@ cia said , and later pushed openly to fight on the network that offers the best financial package . &quot;
we are the best .
no other names can create this kind of attention .
whenever they are ready ... &quot;
&quot; Gar@@ cia said he would like Lom@@ ach@@ enko as &quot; &quot; an enormous fighter &quot; , &quot; and he may take part in his Saturday fight . &quot;
&quot; but Lom@@ ach@@ enko held praise for Gar@@ cia at the generous praise for Gar@@ cia , saying that he thinks that the three @-@ fight champion from River@@ side looks very slowly , sorry Mi@@ key ... you wanted to be the co @-@ off . &quot;
&quot; said Gar@@ cia , the focus is to show impact , then boxes . &quot;
&quot; both said , they could sense the momentum that was built up for their own struggle . &quot;
this is the battle that needs to be carried out .
no other struggle creates so much attention and enthusiasm .
&quot; I am more than happy to work on it , &quot; &quot; said Gar@@ cia . &quot;
&quot; Lom@@ ach@@ enko said , &quot; &quot; I have been waiting for the top fighters , and this is Mi@@ key . &quot;
it will be a great battle . &quot;
four Ver@@ last after T@@ ires
&quot; in an accident on the A7 , four people were seriously injured on Thursday afternoon . &quot;
&quot; after the first information , the driver of an Opel Z@@ af@@ ira lost his vehicle at 16.@@ 30 o &apos;clock shortly before the exit of the market . &quot;
&quot; the car turned to the right into the em@@ bank@@ ment , where he over@@ turned and then lying on the roof in the green strip . &quot;
the four passengers - two adults and two children - were severely injured during the accident .
&quot; during the first supply of the injured by the ambul@@ ance service , the A7 were locked towards the north for about an hour , then the traffic on the left lane stri@@ pe could be passed by the accident site . &quot;
&quot; Fort@@ unas Hoffmann : &quot; &quot; Drei@@ erk@@ ette works better &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; after the 2 : 2 in the season op@@ ener against Braunschweig , Hoffmann hopes that the optimization of the defense information in Au@@ e points brings points . &quot;
&quot; with the first season of the season Andr@@ e Hoffmann was happy , with the result also , there were not the two oppos@@ ers at 2 : 2 against Braunschweig . &quot;
&quot; these were two oppos@@ ites too much , and we have to watch better in Au@@ e , &quot; says the defense player from Fort@@ una Düsseldorf . &quot;
&quot; in the Or@@ e Mountains , the triple chain is to be optimized even further . &quot;
and one goal after an imp@@ etus is not wanting to catch the lag@@ o@@ ons any more .
&quot; for the future , it will be that no one will be on the line next to Michael ( R@@ ens@@ ing ) . &quot;
&quot; Hoffmann is convinced that his team will continue to cope better after the experience in preparation with the three chain , than with the four @-@ chain drive . &quot;
&quot; still I don &apos;t know how we are going to act in Au@@ e , &quot; says his trainer Fried@@ helm Funk@@ el , but Hoffmann is sure of his cause , &quot; because we just in the three chain on the half @-@ positions in Ka@@ an Ay@@ han and N@@ iko G@@ ieß@@ el@@ mann , who can build well , &quot; said Hoffmann . &quot;
&quot; the prerequisite is , however , that we are even better to harmon@@ ize and we do not make as many play@@ mistakes in the building . &quot;
&quot; of course , Hoffmann travels to Au@@ e to win the game . &quot;
&quot; but whether you can talk about a mis@@ guided start , don &apos;t know . &quot;
&quot; the performance could indeed be okay , &quot; said Hoffmann . &quot;
&quot; but if we can stand with four points on Sunday and be able to concentrate on the cup , we will certainly be able to speak of a regular season op@@ ener . &quot;
his trainer didn &apos;t want to know about it .
&quot; the start of the season I judged only after six to eight playing days , &quot; &quot; said Fried@@ helm Funk@@ el , who does not want to talk about an advantage over Au@@ e just because the game of Sax@@ ons in Hei@@ den@@ heim had to be cancelled pre@@ matur@@ ely because of a weather . &quot;
&quot; now they can start the season with a home game , &quot; &quot; said Funk@@ el and Hoffmann believes that the players from Au@@ e might even have some fres@@ her because they wouldn &apos;t have a heavy and complete game like Fort@@ una against an as@@ cen@@ sion fav@@ oring in the bones . &quot;
&quot; but they do not know as 100 percent where they are currently , &quot; says the Interior Minister of Fort@@ una . &quot;
&quot; indeed , the guests from the Rhin@@ eland as an easy favorite on Sunday come to the meeting at last ( almost ) finished stadium of Au@@ e . &quot;
&quot; that we swe@@ ep it away , just because we have the right to come under the first six , is stupid &quot; , &quot; says Funk@@ el , whose balance is quite positive with only a defeat against au@@ e out of nine games . &quot;
&quot; there is no team in the 2nd Bundes@@ liga , which you have to hit from the start , &quot; explains Fort@@ unas executive coach . &quot;
meeting such a statement would be arrogan@@ t and arrogan@@ t .
&quot; and so , Funk@@ el wants to experience his players on Sunday in no case . &quot;
new results of Swedish asylum @-@ based evaluation tests published
&quot; the latest results of tests for asylum seek@@ ers in Sweden , who have under@@ gone a new method for medical assessment of their age , show that more than 80 percent of the tested persons are older than 18 years . but not everyone believes in the accuracy of these results . &quot;
the Swedish authorities for Foren@@ sic Medicine ( R@@ ät@@ ts@@ medic@@ inal@@ verk@@ et ) have started the tests last year .
&quot; during the asylum procedure , you should take a closer look at the assessment of the age after the Swedish Migration Agency ( Mig@@ r@@ ations@@ verk@@ et ) has been critici@@ zed for errors in ass@@ essing the correct age of some refugees that were inferior . &quot;
&quot; up to this date , a total of 6,@@ 880 has been sent to test cases , and the Foren@@ sic Medicine Agency has now published the results of a total of 2,@@ 481 tests from the period from mid March to 31 July 2017 . &quot;
&quot; ei@@ ghty percent ( 2002 ) were judged as 18 or older , whereas in other 25 cases the Foren@@ sic Medicine Agency evaluated that the person was &quot; possibly 18 years or older . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in 432 cases , the conclusion that the person may be under 18 years old . &quot;
the tests are only conducted in cases where the age of the person is questioned .
&quot; according to Johan Gö@@ ran@@ sson , the Foren@@ sic Medicine Agency , the results have been consistent in recent months . &quot;
&quot; we see no big difference in statistics of the past months , the numbers are fairly constant , &quot; he said the magazine The Local . &quot;
&quot; the high percentage of cases where the person has been rated as more than 18 years , does not necessarily mean that the asylum seek@@ er has lied over his age . &quot;
&quot; in May , the Agency published the results of 581 tests and said that there were 442 cases suggest@@ ing that the subject person was 18 years or older . &quot;
&quot; when the newspaper Sv@@ ens@@ ka Dag@@ bla@@ det sought the 581 results published , she noticed that in 243 of these cases the person had openly said that she will be 18 years old this year . &quot;
&quot; the method of medical age assessment , during X @-@ ray imaging of wisdom teeth and MR@@ I recordings of knee joints , which are then analyzed by denti@@ sts and radi@@ ologists , was also critici@@ zed in some areas . &quot;
&quot; a scep@@ tic is the en@@ doc@@ rin@@ ologist Claude Marcus of the Kar@@ ol@@ in@@ ska Institute , whose work involves the evaluation of the biological maturity of people to see if they were usually or later than usually passed through pu@@ ber@@ ty . &quot;
&quot; I had the reason to think about it , and I don &apos;t think the type of measurement should be used . &quot;
evaluating the biological age in this way is very uns@@ af@@ e .
&quot; if we cannot say it surely , we should not pret@@ end as if we could , &quot; &quot; he said the newspaper Metro . &quot;
&quot; however , Gö@@ ran@@ sson from Foren@@ sic Medicine Agency defended the accuracy of tests : &quot; generally , you can say that the risk of a child as an adult is un@@ correct , low . &quot;
&quot; the biggest risk is when the person is under 18 , in this case this is about 10 percent . &quot;
fully in the plan
the work on the three bridges of the highway 108 between Lau@@ ter@@ bach and Sch@@ ram@@ berg is progres@@ sing well .
&quot; on Wednesday , a seven @-@ ton@@ ne concrete part was installed on the bridge at the eastern outskirts of Lau@@ ter@@ bach . &quot;
&quot; we are very good at the time , it &apos;s going great , &quot; says Rein@@ hold Lei@@ cht , forem@@ an at the Department Road and Traffic in the Government Pres@@ idency of Freiburg . &quot;
&quot; in April , work began at the same time on all three renov@@ ations in need between Sch@@ ram@@ berg and Lau@@ ter@@ bach . &quot;
the end of the building is scheduled for October and Lei@@ cht is sure that the schedule is respected .
&quot; the first bridge , coming from Sch@@ ram@@ berg , leads across the Tro@@ mb@@ ach . &quot;
&quot; it is a concrete arch bridge made of concrete , which is covered with red colored sand@@ stone and has a total length of 4.@@ 80 metres . &quot;
it was built in 1900 .
&quot; like the other two bridges , it has now come into the years . &quot;
&quot; to ensure stability and traffic safety , the three structures are now thoroughly rehab@@ ilit@@ ated . &quot;
the other two bridges lead across the Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
they are built of red colored Bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein .
&quot; both were built in 1939 and are twelve , respectively 10.@@ 60 metres long . &quot;
&quot; the bridge at the entrance of Lau@@ ter@@ bach on Wednesday morning got a 1,@@ 30 meter wide and seven tonnes heavy so @-@ called bridge cap on Wednesday morning . &quot;
&quot; this is a border forti@@ fication , which is also used as an operating way . &quot;
&quot; at the southern part of the bridge , a bridge cap is supposed to be used on Friday . &quot;
then the pedestrian walk@@ way takes place .
&quot; the special thing is that these are finished parts , a patent for the Sch@@ ram@@ berg company Di@@ zw@@ o . &quot;
the other two bridges are already fitted with the patented bridge caps .
special finger@@ tips has required the laying of cables through the building plant in Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
there is also a fibre @-@ optic cable that many companies are connected .
local residents were informed about the project in advance of the work .
&quot; in addition , fish and cra@@ y@@ fish had to be f@@ ished . &quot;
&quot; for bridges between the building yard and the collective pond in the direction of Sch@@ ram@@ berg , traffic is regulated by traffic lights . &quot;
&quot; for the construction work on the bridge at the Lau@@ ter@@ bach village entrance , the road in the area of the bridge at the height of the hotel &quot; Tann@@ enhof &quot; and &quot; Seven Lin@@ den &quot; is closed . &quot;
the cost of the three brid@@ ging is 700 000 euros .
the whole is financed through the country .
Af@@ D in Ger@@ ol@@ stein : b@@ unter Prot@@ est with German potato salad
&quot; but when it comes to the alternative for Germany ( Af@@ D ) , parties come together , what else is difficult to get under a hat . &quot;
&quot; the Parties ( CD@@ U , SPD , Grü@@ ne , F@@ DP , F@@ W@@ G , Linke ) are part of a broad alliance , which shows peaceful flag this day because Af@@ D invites you to the Ger@@ ol@@ st@@ einer Stadthalle Ron@@ dell as the &quot; &quot; big election campaign &quot; &quot; in the Ger@@ ol@@ st@@ einer Stadthalle . &quot;
&quot; and well @-@ known names to the start brings - like Alice Wei@@ del , who together with Alexander Gau@@ land forms the leading duo for the parliamentary elections on September 24 , and the Vice @-@ President Beat@@ rix of Stor@@ k . &quot;
&quot; but those who are on site already hours before the start of the event , do not want to listen to the Af@@ D @-@ lern , but demonstrate . &quot;
the motto &quot; The Eifel remains colorful . &quot;
&quot; originally the town @-@ picnic under the motto &quot; All at a table &quot; was planned on the fountain , but now takes place on the parking place underneath the R@@ ond@@ ell - and thus directly in front of the eyes of those who come to the Af@@ D event in the Stadthalle . &quot;
a colorful picture that offers .
&quot; and what Christ@@ a Kar@@ oli , chair of the forum A world and one of the author@@ it@@ ative organizers , is really happy : &quot; great , how many people have come together here . &quot;
&quot; there is music and lots of food , among them a &quot; &quot; German potato salad , which could also eat the Af@@ D without problems , &quot; &quot; says the woman who brought him . &quot;
&quot; the police has ordered many civil servants to Ger@@ ol@@ stein , showing presence especially at the train station , which is only a few metres away from the venues . &quot;
how did the Af@@ D come to Ger@@ ol@@ stein ?
&quot; Mario Hom@@ pes of the Af@@ D Vulkan@@ ei@@ fel reports , he tried to make such an event and get the supplement . &quot;
&quot; the 45 @-@ year @-@ old from G@@ ön@@ ner@@ sdorf had first asked in Dau@@ n , but there was a cancellation because of the already built Lau@@ r@@ enti@@ us@@ kir@@ mes not enough parking available . &quot;
&quot; so now the Ron@@ dell , Hom@@ pes is pleased that &quot; we can have such a nice event here . &quot;
&quot; he says : &quot; this is the good right of the people , the main thing , it remains peaceful . &quot;
&quot; there is also a band for entertainment at about 8 p.m. on the R@@ ond@@ ell@@ platz a band for entertainment , in the Stadthalle diverse speakers , among them the rh@@ ein@@ land @-@ pf@@ äl@@ z@@ ische Af@@ D @-@ Chair@@ person Uwe Junge . &quot;
&quot; there are about 200 people in the audi@@ t@@ orium , who wait for the candidate for the Bundestag election , Alice Wei@@ del , and the Vice @-@ President Beat@@ rix of Stor@@ ch hold their speeches . &quot;
&quot; the police presence remains unchanged , but so far the officials had a quiet evening . &quot;
&quot; something more than an hour is the Af@@ D event , the guests on the forec@@ our@@ t have a longer breath , but also there is vac@@ ated shortly after 21 o &apos;clock . &quot;
the police can withdraw - no special incidents .
tro@@ mb@@ one meets trumpet
&quot; there is a revival with the Wolf@@ acher Pos@@ a@@ uni@@ sten Freder@@ ic B@@ elli in the series Has@@ l@@ acher astic group tomorrow , Sunday , at 8@@ pm in the monastery church . &quot;
&quot; together with the Bulgarian trump@@ eter Mi@@ ros@@ lav Pet@@ kov , he gives a concert under the motto &quot; Black Sea meets Schwarzw@@ ald , &quot; or even &quot; Balkan folklore , &quot; meets classical German education with roots in brass music . &quot;
both solo@@ ists are winners and winners of numerous international competitions and have held solo positions in European orchest@@ ras .
&quot; thus , Pet@@ kov solo@@ ists is the renowned Concer@@ t@@ geb@@ ou@@ w Orchestra Amsterdam and Freder@@ ic B@@ elli is the solo@@ ist of the SWR Symphony Orchestra . &quot;
&quot; both combines the desire not only to cross borders on their instruments , but also to merge the boundaries of the different gen@@ res . &quot;
&quot; Johann Sebastian Bach sounds like in a new robe , Daniel Schn@@ y@@ ders &quot; world music &quot; together with Bulgarian folklore , and in the piece &quot; Exchange Suite &quot; of jazz @-@ maker N@@ ils W@@ ogram , classical , jazz and free games mix to an intri@@ gu@@ ing Gesamt@@ kunst@@ werk . &quot;
this core of the program was first performed this spring with huge success in Freiburg .
the renowned composer N@@ ils W@@ ogram wrote it especially for the two musicians and more : the Has@@ l@@ acher Monastery Church with its particular acousti@@ cs is consciously included into the concert .
Kri@@ sten Ste@@ wart talks about her bis@@ exual
&quot; some people love grilled che@@ eses and will eat it until the end of their lives .
&quot; but I want to try everything , &quot; &quot; Kri@@ sten Ste@@ wart is quite open about her bis@@ exual . &quot;
&quot; when I join in a grilled cheese , I think : &apos; Oh that was cool , what &apos;s next ? &apos; . &quot;
&quot; the most well @-@ known relationship of Hollywood stars was the &quot; Twi@@ light &quot; colleague Robert P@@ att@@ inson , who finally dealt bit@@ terly . &quot;
&quot; despite all that she ass@@ ures the brunette act@@ ress against the &quot; &quot; Har@@ per &apos;s Baz@@ aar &quot; &quot; magazine : &quot; &quot; I was seriously in love with whom I took . &quot;
&quot; or do you think , I would have played it ? &quot;
&quot; after her separation , Kri@@ sten admitted that she was bis@@ exual , &quot; I always lived and believed in du@@ alism . &quot;
so it has never been confused or hin@@ dered .
I like it never to be taken seriously .
especially among them she suffered according to &quot; Bang Show@@ biz &quot; but at school time when she preferred to dress like a boy : &quot; not all girls are typical girls .
this really hurt me .
&quot; when I was eleven , the children said to me , I would look like a boy . &quot;
&quot; I felt really attacked , fri@@ ghtened and ashamed . &quot;
&quot; now I look back and think : &quot; &quot; girl , be proud of you ! &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; especially the public do not like to explain their love life : &quot; &quot; people expect that you are in a certain way and that anno@@ ys me . &quot;
&quot; and perhaps some call me ung@@ rat@@ eful , but I don &apos;t like to justify myself from the whole public . &quot;
the Gover@@ nor of West Virginia announced that he changes the party
&quot; the democratic Gover@@ nor of West Virginia , Jim Justice , announced Thursday evening at a rally with President Tr@@ ump that he will change the party . &quot;
&quot; whether you like it or not , the democr@@ ats have removed from me , &quot; said Gover@@ nor Justice . &quot;
&quot; today I will tell you with many prayers and a lot of re@@ thinking ... Today I will tell you as inhabitants of West Virginia , I can no longer help you if I am a democratic governor . &quot;
the rally broke out in ju@@ bel .
&quot; tomorrow I will change my registration to the Repub@@ lic@@ ans , &quot; added Justice . &quot;
as a trainer I would say it &apos;s time to play another game .
Mr. Tr@@ ump promised a great announcement at West Virginia Rally .
Mr. Tr@@ ump won West Virginia with 42 points and Justice did not endor@@ se the democratic candidate Hill@@ ary Clinton .
&quot; Justice , who , according to For@@ bes , is the only billi@@ on@@ aire in the state , was elected in 2016 . &quot;
&quot; For@@ bes states that he has coal mines in five states , and his father inherited a coal business . &quot;
it is worth approximately 1.@@ 59 billion dollars .
&quot; in the meantime , on Thursday evening , the Repub@@ lican National Committee issued an explanation in which it said : &quot; the Party change from Gover@@ nor Justice is another blow to a Democratic Party which would rather prevent us from working to make our country great again . &quot;
&quot; with only 15 provinces and the control of the least legislative bodies in history , the announcement of Gover@@ nor Justice is only the final rejection of a party that is from top to bottom without leadership and is unable to find a positive , unanim@@ ous message , &quot; said R@@ onna Mc@@ Daniel , in an explanation of the C@@ BS News . &quot;
CO@@ E pra@@ ises &quot; honest &quot; Russian ap@@ ologies for dop@@ ing sc@@ andal
&quot; the global leader of Athle@@ tics , Sebastian Co@@ e , praised what he described as an obvious ap@@ ologi@@ ze from Russia to a dop@@ ing sc@@ andal , but he repeated it is not the moment for the country to be res@@ um@@ ed back into the sport . &quot;
&quot; Russia &apos;s athle@@ tics chef Dmit@@ ry Sh@@ yl@@ akh@@ tin said during the I@@ A@@ AF Congress on the eve of the Athle@@ tics World Championships , that the exile of his country was correct and that he was determined to fight the dop@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; he said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m sorry for &quot; &quot; all athletes , who were cut away from competition gold and silver medals . &quot;
&quot; despite his comments , the I@@ A@@ AF Congress voted for the maintenance of the ban that was imposed in November 2015 after a report from the World Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency ( WA@@ DA ) had found evidence on state @-@ sponsored dop@@ ing in Russia . &quot;
&quot; I thought it was a very open response today , a very honest presentation , &quot; &quot; said I@@ A@@ AF President Co@@ e the rep@@ or@@ ters . &quot;
the whole council and the entire congress were delighted that the Russian Federation has realized with itself that it has experienced some rather hot times and will do everything possible to ensure that the Federation is re@@ designed .
&quot; said CO@@ E , he is also &quot; &quot; pleased &quot; &quot; that Russia accepts the criteria for re @-@ launch . &quot;
&quot; I think it was a very constructive day , and I think that progress was made , but the Congress supports the recommendations of Task Force that this is not the moment to re@@ use Russia again , &quot; said Co@@ e . &quot;
we have to do everything in the coming months to norm@@ alize this situation .
&quot; the guiding principle was always that we wanted to separate the clean ath@@ l@@ ete from the corrupt system , &quot; &quot; he added . &quot;
ninet@@ een Russian athletes will start at the World Athle@@ tics World Championships that start on Friday in London following the strict I@@ A@@ AF criteria as neutral players .
&quot; the head of the I@@ A@@ AF Task Force , R@@ une Ander@@ sen , said on Monday that Russia must meet some of the criteria for re @-@ adjustment . &quot;
&quot; drug tests are still inadequate and forbidden trainers are still free , he said Rep@@ or@@ ters in London after a lecture at the I@@ A@@ AF Council . &quot;
mour@@ ning for Mali collap@@ sed soldiers
&quot; at a fun@@ eral service in the North @-@ Hes@@ sian F@@ ritz@@ lar , around 1,000 people of the two were killed in a helicop@@ ter crash in Mali . &quot;
the ceremony took place on Thursday in the cathedral city under high safety precau@@ tions .
&quot; to the still un@@ clari@@ fied result , Minister of Defence Ursula von der Le@@ yen ( CD@@ U ) said nothing . &quot;
&quot; she described the two revers@@ ed pilots , but as &quot; &quot; pat@@ rons of their expertise &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; we bow down to this highest sacrifice , which they have provided in the name of the Federal Republic of Germany , &quot; she explained . &quot;
the 33 @-@ year @-@ old Major and the 47 @-@ year @-@ old Stab@@ sh@@ aup@@ tmann from Nord@@ h@@ essen were killed on Wednesday a week ago in the West African Mali .
their coff@@ ins were transferred to Germany and on Thursday accompanied by a guard of the Bundes@@ wehr in the F@@ ritz@@ lar@@ er Dom Sankt Peter .
&quot; at noon , only the members of the church took leave . &quot;
&quot; after that , the fun@@ eral service began in the circle of family , close friends , representatives of the Bundes@@ wehr as well as politics . &quot;
&quot; among them were H@@ ess@@ ens Prime Minister Volker Bou@@ ff@@ ier ( CD@@ U ) , and the General In@@ spec@@ tor of the Federal Army Volker Wi@@ ek@@ er . &quot;
&quot; mour@@ ning sticks laid down ro@@ ses , the relatives were arm in arm to the coff@@ ins . &quot;
&quot; in front of the church , F@@ ritz@@ han@@ er and numerous soldiers followed the ceremony on a canvas . &quot;
&quot; Minister of Defence of the Le@@ yen described the &quot; &quot; highly decorated &quot; &quot; soldiers as &quot; &quot; highly decorated &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the Stab@@ sh@@ aup@@ tmann designed the flying operation of the combat helicop@@ ter tiger in F@@ ritz@@ lar and was one of the first six trained tiger drivers of his reg@@ iment .
&quot; Volker Bau@@ ers@@ ach@@ s , commander of the reg@@ iment to which the soldiers were part of , said : &quot; if this crew could not turn off the crash , there would not have been any mo@@ ist . &quot;
&quot; doubt at the UN mission in Mali , Minister of the Le@@ yen presented not : commitment is dangerous . &quot;
&quot; but he is also of high importance &quot; for a country , from which we are only separated by two states , &quot; she said . &quot;
after the fun@@ eral service the coff@@ ins were taken out of the cathedral .
&quot; when and where they are buried , the Bundes@@ wehr did not provide any information . &quot;
Prince Hen@@ rik doesn &apos;t want a grave next to his wife
&quot; the man of the Danish Queen Mar@@ gre@@ the ( 77 ) , Prince Hen@@ rik ( 83 ) , does not want to be buried next to his wife after his death . &quot;
this shared the King &apos;s House on Thursday .
traditionally the Danish royal couple is buried in the cathedral church of Ros@@ kil@@ de .
the sculp@@ tor Bj@@ ør@@ n N@@ ør@@ ga@@ ard already made a sar@@ cop@@ h@@ agus for the two .
&quot; the Queen had agreed with the decision of her husband , she said in the message . &quot;
&quot; where Prince Hen@@ rik is buried , be still un@@ clear . &quot;
but he did not intend to be buried in his French homeland .
Prince Hen@@ rik had never made a secret that he was not happy with his title .
&quot; after the ascent of his wife Mar@@ gre@@ the in 1972 , he would like to become king . &quot;
&quot; in 2016 he retired and took the title &quot; &quot; Prinz@@ reg@@ mahl &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; as Hen@@ rik in Denmark did not get the title and function he wanted , he does not see himself as equivalent to his wife - even not after death , L@@ ene B@@ alle@@ by declared the director of the Danish royal house . &quot;
&quot; where the last resting place of the 83 @-@ year @-@ old will ultimately be , be still un@@ clear . &quot;
&quot; but he did not intend to be buried in his French homeland , but in Denmark . &quot;
he likes the country for which he has worked in the last 50 years .
&quot; the native Henri de Labor@@ de de Mon@@ pe@@ z@@ at , son of a French no@@ bility , had met Mar@@ gre@@ the 1965 in London . &quot;
on the Th@@ ames he worked in the French Embassy .
&quot; during his later wife , the sympath@@ ies of the people always flew away , Prince Hen@@ rik had a heavy standing in his almost 50 @-@ year reign . &quot;
&quot; Hen@@ rik expressed in an auto@@ biography about the first years in Denmark : &quot; a few months after my arrival , everything I did was critici@@ zed . &quot;
&quot; my Danish was wa@@ ver@@ ing , I prefer wine instead of beer , silk skir@@ ts instead of kn@@ itting so@@ cks , Citro@@ ë@@ n instead of Volvo , tennis instead of football . &quot;
&quot; even for the Gau@@ lo@@ ises , which I smo@@ ked instead of Virginia tobacco and who in this country had the reputation to be the brand of corporate @-@ critical intellectu@@ als , I could not hope for hope . &quot;
I was different .
I seemed to be happy with this position and not ashamed .
these were just two mistakes ! &quot;
Prime Minister Wei@@ l wants rapid re @-@ election
CD@@ U and F@@ DP in front of the possible majority in Lower Saxony
&quot; according to the loss of the red @-@ green government majority , Nieder@@ sach@@ sen &apos;s Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) is not willing to reti@@ re after the loss of the red @-@ green government majority for a swi@@ ft re @-@ election of the country . &quot;
&quot; on Friday , he spoke out for the resolution of the Parliament . &quot;
&quot; prior to the surprising exit of a Green Party in Lower Saxony , the government of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) had over@@ thrown the government of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) . &quot;
&quot; five months before the official appointment of the provincial election , the red @-@ green coalition in Hanover lost its scar@@ ce one @-@ vote majority in parliament to the opposition from CD@@ U and F@@ DP . &quot;
the former Green MPs El@@ ke T@@ winn@@ er@@ set their step with the non @-@ nom@@ ination for the 2018 election in their constitu@@ ency in Rot@@ enburg ( Wü@@ mme ) .
&quot; I see my political future in the CD@@ U , &quot; &quot; she declared on Friday in Hanover . &quot;
CD@@ U fac@@ tional leader Björn Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler wants to recommend his faction to include them .
&quot; therefore CD@@ U and F@@ DP would have 69 seats in the Lower Saxony State Parliament , SPD and Green 68 seats . &quot;
&quot; until now , the relationship was revers@@ ed . &quot;
the New Land@@ tag will be elected regularly on 14 January next year .
&quot; Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler said , the red @-@ green national government must now decide if it could be ruled out without a majority in this situation . &quot;
&quot; however , Stephan Wei@@ l believes that the Land@@ tag resol@@ ves as quickly as possible his self @-@ resolution . &quot;
the CD@@ U Group is expected to decide on its further action on Tuesday .
the state constitution also fores@@ ees the possibility that the Parliament &apos;s parliament sel@@ ects the trust and el@@ ects a successor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; our Constitution offers several options . &quot;
&quot; these opportunities must be legally insp@@ ected , &quot; &quot; Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler said . &quot;
&quot; in peace , all questions will be discussed if they are legally tested . &quot;
Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler called T@@ west@@ an &apos;s step &quot; but a little kur@@ i@@ os . &quot;
the politicians themselves stressed : &quot; I am not a tra@@ itor .
I feel very good . &quot;
she referred to as a follow@@ er of black @-@ green .
the Gre@@ ens demanded the de@@ fer@@ ous de@@ pu@@ ties for the return of their land council .
&quot; we assume , of course , that they have received their land greeting , which they have received over the green national list , with immediate effect , &quot; shared the provincial governor Meta Jan@@ ssen @-@ Ku@@ cz and Stefan Kör@@ ner . &quot;
&quot; the Group president of the Gre@@ ens Anja P@@ iel said , &quot; &quot; We regret the decision of El@@ ke T@@ west@@ extra@@ ordin@@ arily . &quot;
they deliberately chose to have no pron@@ unciation in the Group .
&quot; even in the face of the background that there were no differences in terms of content , we cannot understand this step . &quot;
SPD chan@@ cell@@ or candidate Martin Schulz condem@@ ns the transgres@@ sion of the Lower Saxon Gre@@ ens @-@ members El@@ ke T@@ v@@ est to the CD@@ U as betra@@ yal .
&quot; the behaviour of former Green MPs in Lower Saxony is not only betra@@ yal of voters , but also betra@@ yal of red @-@ green , &quot; wrote the German Social Democrats on Friday on Facebook . &quot;
he supported the decision by Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) to quickly elect the Parliament .
the outlet T@@ west@@ ens costs Red @-@ Green in Lower Saxony the majority .
&quot; the politicians &quot; place &quot; in their last van@@ ity and in their fru@@ stration their personal interests before the well @-@ being of the country , &quot; said SPD Secretary General Hu@@ ber@@ tus Heil . &quot;
it is a sc@@ andal that the CD@@ U in Lower Saxony is taking this dirty intri@@ gue and tries to make political capital out of it .
Dutch &apos;s CD@@ U fac@@ tional leader Björn Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler wants to recommend its de@@ pu@@ ties to include El@@ ke T@@ west@@ in to the CD@@ U .
&quot; the SPD leader of the SPD in the Bundestag , Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , designed T@@ v@@ ests to fal@@ si@@ fy the results of the 2013 presidential election with personal career opportunities . &quot;
&quot; the CD@@ U was at that time the SPD &apos;s strongest force , SPD and Gre@@ ens had a very thin majority in the parliament &apos;s parliament . &quot;
&quot; Minister of Agriculture in the interview - How do we protect ourselves from gyp@@ si@@ es , Mr. Schmidt ? &quot;
Germany disc@@ usses about contaminated eggs .
how could the sc@@ andal occur ?
how can consumers protect themselves ?
Minister of Agriculture Christian Schmidt ( CS@@ U ) is talking and answering in the interview with the editorial network Germany ( R@@ ND ) .
&quot; Mr. Schmidt , How can consumers protect themselves from po@@ is@@ oned eggs ? &quot;
I can only encourage all consumers to check the eggs in your fridge and check the stamp print .
&quot; on the consumer protection portal www.@@ food@@ war@@ n@@ ung.de , the federal states provide the latest information on the eggs concerned . &quot;
affected eggs should be destroyed or returned .
&quot; even if according to all that we are currently aware of , a health haz@@ ard is practically excluded . &quot;
now Al@@ di takes over the best possible crisis reaction - all the eggs from the offer - because the central role of the recon@@ na@@ iss@@ ance is not really perceived by the Federal Minister of Economic Affairs ?
food monitoring is the task of the federal states .
&quot; nevertheless , my house has immediately switched on and has been in close contact with the authorities of the countries since it was announced . &quot;
all information and risk assessment are available for consumers .
trade has just as much concern for the manufacturers to ensure that the sold @-@ out products are traffic @-@ capable and health @-@ safe .
&quot; if it is exceeded in eggs of the resi@@ due content of 0,@@ 00@@ mg / kg , these are not viable . &quot;
&quot; however , un@@ loaded eggs can however be sold and consumed . &quot;
this time the enterprises are not to blame .
are production companies and consumers in the same boat ?
&quot; according to the level of knowledge , the production companies are not responsible for immediate guilt . &quot;
&quot; rather , they must expect economic damages on the basis of presum@@ ed illegal practices of service companies . &quot;
&quot; as always , in the di@@ arr@@ he@@ a , there is too little control . &quot;
is it lacking only at the staff or in the conc@@ lusive competence ?
&quot; however , there were just the official controls exposed to the process . &quot;
&quot; however , the truth also includes that food fraud and criminal energy can never be excluded 100 percent . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , a consistent explanation of such events and the hand@@ over to the public prosec@@ ut@@ ors in cases where crimes can exist is of decisive importance . &quot;
I have already made several times clear that I expect a complete enlighten@@ ment from the responsible authorities .
is regular al@@ ar@@ mis@@ m really necessary for food sc@@ and@@ als ?
consumers have the right to only receive safe and heavy goods .
&quot; if a non @-@ approved insec@@ ti@@ cide is used in the food industry , consumers are rightly perceived . &quot;
&quot; through the pan@@ elling means , manufacturers , traders and consumers get into a situation that is absolutely unnecessary . &quot;
&quot; basically , it must be clear : the un@@ lawful use of the insec@@ ti@@ cide Fi@@ pron@@ il in the attitude of food @-@ producing animals is not acceptable and must be termin@@ ated immediately . &quot;
&quot; at all levels , it is necessary to work consistently and with high pressure . &quot;
&quot; I expect from all the competent authorities , that the atomic fact is spe@@ edy and un@@ interrupted . &quot;
how to affect the financial rules of football on N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s Mov@@ ing to Paris
the rules aimed at preventing un@@ hin@@ dered issues of European football clubs will not distur@@ b N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s world record transfer from the Spanish Barcelona to the French Paris @-@ Saint Ger@@ main .
&quot; any consequences will come to Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main from the UEF@@ A , as the guiding organisation that over@@ sees the European game has the power to ban teams from access to the prestigious champ@@ ions league tournament . &quot;
&quot; financial fair play rules , launched in 2011 by the UEF@@ A , mean that PSG has to prove at some point that the transfer of N@@ ey@@ mar was financed without major losses . &quot;
&quot; Barcelona has paid $ 222 million ( 262 million dollars ) to buy Brazilian from his contract , and N@@ ey@@ mar will receive a salary that will amount to several ten million dollars a year . &quot;
here are some of the financial aspects of N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s Mov@@ ing to France .
&quot; PSG can make money loos@@ ely , so that N@@ ey@@ mar under@@ writes and bring him into a galax@@ y of other stars , in view of the financing of the team by the rich sovereign family of Qatar . &quot;
&quot; clubs are allowed to spend a lot of money for the acquisition of players , but have to steer with legitimate income sources , which enable them to break @-@ even point in their on the football @-@ related business . &quot;
FF@@ P was designed by Michel Plat@@ ini after his election to the UEF@@ A President in 2007 .
&quot; former French player believed that clubs , who had taken enormous debt in their quest for success , are effectively dec@@ ei@@ ving and ris@@ ked to ruin when banks or owners with@@ drew their support . &quot;
&quot; in 2011 , FF@@ P moved from concentration on the debts of clubs to monitor their losses . &quot;
&quot; the change meant that the business model , the Roman Abr@@ am@@ ovi@@ ch originally used in Chelsea - bought a club with potential and then invested heavily to improve the team and build a global brand - should become a harder matter . &quot;
&quot; during the current three @-@ year clearance period , which runs until 2018 , clubs can accept losses of 30 million euros . &quot;
&quot; and although Plat@@ ini 2015 has fallen from the pres@@ idency of the Pres@@ idency , his UEF@@ A successor Aleks@@ ander C@@ efer@@ in continues to be afraid of excessive expenses . &quot;
&quot; for sure , FF@@ P is not dead and we will rein@@ force the rules for the future , &quot; &quot; said Andrea Tra@@ ver@@ so , who is responsible for FF@@ P in UEF@@ A , compared to The Associ@@ ated Press last week . &quot;
&quot; although the PSG has paid the buy @-@ out clause of N@@ ey@@ mar in a package , it can distribute the amount for invo@@ icing on the duration of his contract . &quot;
&quot; N@@ ey@@ mar has signed a five @-@ year contract , so that the solution will be exp@@ elled for the next five years in the amount of 44.@@ 4 million euros in the end of the year . &quot;
&quot; the first wave of FF@@ P sanctions in 2014 brought the PSG to Abu Dhabi , which is owned by Manchester City , with the most severe sanctions . &quot;
&quot; the PSG received a fine of 60 million euros ( then 82 million dollars ) , which later was reduced to 20 million euros - and it was arranged that the team members for the 2014 / 15 Champions League will be limited to 21 players instead of the otherwise normal 25 players . &quot;
&quot; UEF@@ A is looking for clubs that could try to over@@ see their financial supervision by blowing their revenue by companies , which are connected to the owners of a club . &quot;
&quot; while a cat@@ ar@@ table company could sponsor the PSG , if the value of the sponsor should exceed the standard market rates , the UEF@@ A would not be considered legitimate income . &quot;
&quot; this is exactly what happened in 2014 , when the UEF@@ A decided that the value of the sponsor of the P@@ SA was infl@@ ated by the Qatar Tourism Authority . &quot;
it was reported that part of the PSG @-@ payments to N@@ ey@@ mar could come to Qatar about payments of the Organiz@@ ing Committee of the 2022 World Cup in Qatar .
but PSG and Qatar 2022 argued that N@@ ey@@ mar WM will be amb@@ ass@@ ad@@ ors and a such maneu@@ ver for the UEF@@ A regul@@ ators could be easy to figure out .
&quot; the previous sanctions against PSG mean that the UEF@@ A will be more attentive , to observe any attempt to circum@@ vent the rules . &quot;
&quot; UEF@@ A had no pre @-@ prepar@@ atory discussions with PSG about N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s Transfer , announ@@ cing the people familiar with the situation on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; they spoke under the condition of anony@@ m@@ ity with The Associ@@ ated Press , since they were not authorized to discuss the PSG situation . &quot;
the last published reports show that PSG 2015 / 16 posted sales of € 54@@ 2.4 million with a profit of more than 10 million euros .
accounts for the last fiscal year need to be published .
&quot; PSG expects that N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s Arri@@ val is a blessing for sponsor@@ ing deals , merchan@@ dis@@ ing and jer@@ sey sales . &quot;
the association assumes that sales will rise by at least 30 percent after the signature .
&quot; the Spanish League was clearly irrit@@ ated to see one of the best football players , and she tried to prevent N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s &apos;s move by claim@@ ing that he would hurt the FF@@ P . &quot;
&quot; it is a clear case of &quot; financial dop@@ ing &quot; with the club and the state , &quot; said the president of the La Liga , J@@ avier T@@ eb@@ as , the Spanish daily AS regarding Qatar &apos;s last owner . &quot;
&quot; Arsen@@ al @-@ Manager Arsen@@ e Wen@@ ger , whose association is owned by an American Sports Ty@@ co@@ on , shares the reservations of La Liga with a state that finan@@ ces a society . &quot;
&quot; it is the consequence of the ownership and that has completely changed the entire landscape of football in the past 15 years , &quot; Wen@@ ger said on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; once a country has an association , everything is possible . &quot;
&quot; it is very difficult to respect financial Fair@@ play because there are different ways or have different interests , if a country has such a large player to represent a country . &quot;
Swiss is looking for a new shop supplier
&quot; in recent years , Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y has produced board chocolate for Swiss . &quot;
now the sweet collaboration is in front of a possible end : the airline is writing the contract new .
&quot; Swiss @-@ Spe@@ aker Mei@@ ke Fu@@ hl@@ rot@@ t confirmed a report from the newspaper &quot; &quot; Nord@@ west@@ schweiz &quot; &quot; on request by the news agency . &quot;
&quot; according to current planning , the airline will conclude a new contract in the first half of 2018 . &quot;
the products would be checked every two to three years and subjected to quality control .
&quot; with the current supplier Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y , we are very satisfied , &quot; &quot; said the spokes@@ person . &quot;
around 17 million small red @-@ white chocolate bars of 14 grams per year distribute the flight atten@@ d@@ ants before landing to the passengers .
Swiss do not want to give any information about the cost .
&quot; according to &quot; North @-@ West Switzerland , &quot; the volume of orders in accordance with &quot; North @-@ West Switzerland &quot; estimates 1.5 to 2 million Swiss francs - the Mig@@ ros subsidiary achieves an annual turnover of around 1 billion Swiss francs . &quot;
but more important is the advertising effect : for a sh@@ og@@ gle manufacturer it is a prestigious order .
&quot; as many applicants there are at the new ten@@ dering , the Swiss does not want to betra@@ y it . &quot;
but only Swiss manufacturers come into question .
&quot; according to the newspaper article , Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y wants to make an effort to restore the Treaty on Spring 2018 . &quot;
&quot; for the s@@ da , the largest Swiss chocolate manufacturer was not available for an opinion . &quot;
&quot; chocolate bars , which have been distribut@@ ing the Swiss since 2006 on board their flights . &quot;
&quot; before the Swiss concluded a contract with the Mig@@ ros subsidiary , Barry C@@ alle@@ baut has delivered the chocolate @-@ tablet in collaboration with Hu@@ g . &quot;
&quot; the opportunity to place the logo , Swiss introduced two and a half years ago with the start of cooperation with Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y . &quot;
the airline works together with various Swiss chocolate producers .
&quot; on long @-@ hau@@ l flights , the customers of First Class with goo@@ dies are p@@ am@@ pered by the Con@@ fis@@ erie Spr@@ ün@@ gli , in the Business Class nasty passengers Sch@@ og@@ gi of Lin@@ dt and in Economy Class Sch@@ og@@ gi of Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y . &quot;
&quot; also on the short circuit , Swiss Sch@@ og@@ gi is distributed by Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y , both in business and economy class . &quot;

nostal@@ gia goes to &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer &quot; and &quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; into the niche
&quot; this re@@ petition of history is at the same time nostal@@ g@@ ically because of the glorious days of the characters of the 80 @-@ year @-@ years , for the 90 @-@ year Gr@@ unge era ( when the pione@@ ers David W@@ ain and Michael Show@@ alter turned the Sk@@ et@@ ch com@@ edy &quot; The State &quot; for M@@ TV ) , and for himself - that means for 2001 before their stars , like Elizabeth B@@ anks , Amy Po@@ ehler and Paul Ru@@ dd went to bigger things . &quot;
as a cultural arti@@ fact it is equally a par@@ o@@ dy and a em@@ bodi@@ ment of our Facebook @-@ capable era of permanent memories .
but as fran@@ chise it feels like the time would be scar@@ ce .
&quot; first Day of Camp &quot; surprisingly good , not only because of his absurd hum@@ our ( it contained an original story for a pleasant can of vegetables spoken by H. Jon Benjamin ) . &quot;
&quot; by sti@@ ff@@ ing down to the core of the g@@ ags - actors of middle @-@ aged children play small children who are grown up - nevertheless , they managed to win the last part of the W@@ itz@@ es . &quot;
&quot; ten Years L@@ ater , &quot; with his adults who are playing adults now , is less emotion@@ ally rooted and his par@@ o@@ dy goes more after the casting principle , among them a reef to the Stal@@ ker movies of the 90 @-@ year @-@ old as &quot; The Hand That Ro@@ cks the Cra@@ dle &quot; ( &quot; The Hand that k@@ ills the cra@@ dle &quot; ) . &quot;
&quot; in one point a character rum@@ ored by an Apple Power@@ book , some inline sk@@ ates and &quot; a number of other things from the year 1991 . &quot;
many of the central stories are the same .
&quot; the gra@@ cious C@@ oop ( Mr. Show@@ alter ) , now Roman@@ au@@ tor , has still not forgotten K@@ atie ( Mar@@ gu@@ er@@ ite Mor@@ eau ) . &quot;
Victor ( Ken Marino ) still hasn &apos;t lost his vir@@ g@@ inity .
&quot; and there is another crazy mal@@ ign@@ ant plot , included in the Ronald Re@@ agan ( also Mr. Show@@ alter ) , which is now supported by George H. W. Bush ( a good impression of Michael Ian Black ) . &quot;
&quot; as always , the ex@@ ams are the best part of the fran@@ chise . &quot;
&quot; it makes a lot of fun to see the eternal young Mr. Ru@@ dd , the Matt D@@ ill@@ ons sub@@ li@@ pp@@ enb@@ art of &quot; Sing@@ les , &quot; whose former Big @-@ Man @-@ on @-@ Camp Andy feels like an old cra@@ cker . &quot;
&quot; there are the moments acci@@ dental ma@@ dness that could provo@@ ke this fran@@ chise as a sort of re@@ peti@@ tive &quot; Seven Up ! &quot; series until it reaches what I consider as its logical conclusion : &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer : Tw@@ enty Years L@@ ater , &quot; whose last scene will show the film premiere of &quot; &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; com@@ rade Det@@ ective on Amazon now reminds of a different kind of nostal@@ gia : to the revival of the Cold War of &quot; The Americans , &quot; to the movie &quot; Atom@@ ic Blon@@ de &quot; and even to &quot; G@@ LOW &quot; with its east @-@ west w@@ rest@@ ling icon@@ ography . &quot;
&quot; created by Brian Gat@@ ew@@ ood and Aless@@ andro Tan@@ aka , Com@@ edy with Rh@@ ys Thomas as director , is a Romanian drama of the eigh@@ ties with the two polic@@ emen as friends , two officers from Bucharest that fight for truth , a@@ thei@@ sm and the path of Marxism @-@ Lenin@@ ism . &quot;
the main roles - a hard @-@ ges@@ ot@@ ten@@ er Gregor and an ide@@ alistic i@@ os@@ ef - are played by Flor@@ in Pier@@ sic J@@ r. and Corn@@ eli@@ u u@@ lic@@ i whose dialog@@ ues by Ch@@ anning Tat@@ um ( also a detailed producer ) and Joseph Gordon @-@ Lev@@ itt will be synchron@@ ized in English .
it is a brilliant idea .
but it is not much more than an idea .
there are some nice g@@ ags to watch ( the police sp@@ ends the time watching chess on television how Americans may do it with football ) .
&quot; and the list of the famous actors - including Jenny S@@ late , Nick Off@@ er@@ man , Mah@@ er@@ sh@@ ala Ali and Ch@@ lo@@ ë Se@@ vi@@ gn@@ y - ensures a decent game &quot; Find out the voice . &quot; &quot;
&quot; but &quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; is so committed to the tru@@ th@@ fulness of a des@@ perate propaganda drama - a mur@@ derer , who carries a Re@@ agan Mask , is involved - that it often plays like a single one . &quot;
&quot; in six long episodes , the com@@ edy is not fast or frequent enough . &quot;
&quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective , who was edited on a lower length , could deliver his ag@@ it@@ pro@@ p sati@@ re , since Gregor and I@@ os@@ ef always visit the American emb@@ assy , whose lobby is always occupied by two thick men who dev@@ our a bunch of ham@@ bur@@ gers . &quot;
the message for the imag@@ inary communist audience is that Western culture can do everything to feed for a ban@@ ker .
the fic@@ ti@@ tious Romanian cre@@ ators were not wrong : we even do it with our own younger history and with thei@@ rs .
beat against drugs ma@@ fia in the country
the police took a blow against the Italian ma@@ fia in Baden @-@ Württemberg .
&quot; on Wednesday morning , in the Black Forest Ba@@ ar district , in Rot@@ t@@ weil , Kon@@ stanz , Ess@@ lingen and Stuttgart visited numerous objects , such as the public prosec@@ utor &apos;s office in Kon@@ stanz on Friday . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , 15 def@@ endants were arrested at the age of 25 and 77 years and had already issued arrest warran@@ ts against them . &quot;
&quot; the officials also secured large quantities of marijuana and co@@ ca@@ ine , fire@@ arms and several hundred thousand euros . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , in Italy , two persons were arrested . &quot;
&quot; against the two susp@@ ects Itali@@ ans , there were German arrest warran@@ ts . &quot;
the two are therefore probably delivered to Germany .
in the action Italian and Bavarian investig@@ ators were involved .
&quot; in total , over 300 polic@@ emen were in action . &quot;
&quot; the members of the Maf@@ ia are accused of organized drug crime , serious violence , murder , rob@@ ber@@ y and black@@ mail . &quot;
&quot; since the summer of 2016 , the prosec@@ utor &apos;s Office det@@ ects Con@@ stance against organised drug traff@@ icking in Southern Germany . &quot;
between the public prosec@@ ut@@ ors in Con@@ stance and Palermo was a lively exchange and the investig@@ ators of the Kri@@ po Rot@@ t@@ weil had almost daily contact with their colleagues on Sicily .
&quot; therefore , on Wednesday morning the large @-@ scale use was accompanied by four function@@ aries from Palermo . &quot;
&quot; in the course of the investigations , especially Italian nation@@ als with strict reference to the Italian ma@@ fia . &quot;
&quot; a incident on May 27 in Hü@@ fingen , where several shots were fired at a restaurant early in the morning , is likely to go to the bank account . &quot;
wise lam@@ ented large gaps in the foreig@@ ner &apos;s register
&quot; according to a report , the foreig@@ ner regi@@ sters significant short@@ com@@ ings in Germany . &quot;
this leads to partly serious mis@@ decisions regarding asylum procedures .
&quot; according to a media report , the commission@@ er for the refugee management of the Federal Government , Frank @-@ Jürgen Weise , drew attention to large gaps in the foreign country register . &quot;
&quot; defici@@ encies in the data recorded there could lead to partly serious mis@@ decisions in case of asylum procedures and deport@@ ations , &quot; warned in an analysis that the &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; lies ahead . &quot;
&quot; according to the report , ten million people with foreign nationality are reported in the Register , including about 5.7 million from non @-@ EU countries . &quot;
the data are therefore managed by about 600 Aus@@ länder@@ behörde in Germany .
&quot; because the data has not been sufficiently maintained , data quality has not been good in parts until now . &quot;
&quot; data from 1921 has been found in individual cases , &quot; &quot; by people who are no longer alive , or from citizens who have become German citizens and actually no longer should appear in the register . &quot;
&quot; incorrect data input can slow down revers@@ al processes , &quot; says the report further . &quot;
&quot; in the statistics on char@@ geable people , EU citizens are over@@ taken who would not have to leave . &quot;
&quot; however , such false acc@@ ords led to a dist@@ orted debate on how to deal with the subject , &quot; says it in the analysis . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , the Federal Government has apparently begun to send refugee families back to Italy with 16 @-@ year @-@ old children if they have travelled from there . &quot;
&quot; this goes out of an internal paper of the Federal Office for Migration and Refu@@ ge@@ es ( BA@@ MF ) , reports the &quot; New O@@ sn@@ ab@@ rück Zeitung . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in the paper it means that the BA@@ MF conduc@@ ts such procedures &quot; concerning families with children , with the exception of inf@@ ants and inf@@ ants - to Italy since 1 June 2017 . &quot;
&quot; since the end of 2014 , this was practically no longer possible , so the newspaper has a reference to the difficult situation on site . &quot;
&quot; following the Dublin agreement , the EU state is responsible for refugees . &quot;
&quot; if a migrant travels to another EU country , this state can send it back to the entry . &quot;
&quot; the office now comments : &quot; meanwhile , the absorption capacity for families with under@@ age children in Italy has significantly increased . &quot;
Italy has issued guarantees for the inclusion and accommodation of family guarantees .
even the European Court of Human Rights ( EG@@ MR ) considers these commitments to be sufficient .
other EU states would also send it back to refugees in the framework of the Dublin agreement .
&quot; the domestic spokes@@ woman of the left @-@ hand group at the Bundestag , Ull@@ a Jel@@ p@@ ke , critic@@ ised this decision : &quot; families with children thre@@ aten human rights @-@ un@@ lawful shooting conditions and a threat to child welfare due to lack in the Italian asylum system . &quot;
second @-@ best result achieved
a total of 220 litres of blood is available for other people in Ober@@ rei@@ chen@@ bach .
&quot; at least by the twelve citizens , who were awarded on Friday . &quot;
&quot; in the meantime , Jürgen Gre@@ ule , who , with his now 100 donations , has now distributed 50 litres of blood . &quot;
&quot; traditionally , in the meeting of the Municipal Council , the congregation appl@@ au@@ ds multiple readiness to don@@ ate blood . &quot;
&quot; it is awesome how our bodies are laid out for it and we appl@@ aud the don@@ ors who provide their blood for stran@@ gers , nor in@@ sel@@ fish , &quot; said Mayor Karl@@ hein@@ z K@@ ist@@ ner . &quot;
&quot; a single blood donation helps several people , &quot; explained the District Church leader of the German Red Cross ( DR@@ K ) , Holger Mais@@ enb@@ acher , because the c@@ anned foods are crum@@ bled into their constitu@@ ents . &quot;
this is how three people could benefit from a blood donation .
&quot; at the same time , corn blo@@ wers reported about the actions carried out in Ober@@ rei@@ chen@@ bach in the spring . &quot;
&quot; this year we achieved the second best result with 114 don@@ ors , &quot; said the Head of DR@@ K . &quot;
&quot; obviously , the change to the theatre was led to higher numbers of participants a few years ago . &quot;
&quot; already before that , Thomas Bo@@ ck@@ stadt , Susanne Reich@@ le , Sandra Schö@@ ck , Thomas Reich@@ le and Meta Re@@ beer were among the multiple don@@ ors and were awarded for 50 donated blood donations . &quot;
&quot; half so many Herbert M@@ air and Dorothe@@ e Ri@@ ex@@ inger , while T@@ amara Pf@@ rom@@ mer , Petra Schle@@ mmer , Stef@@ anie St@@ oll and Uwe V@@ etter issued ten times each 500 milli@@ liter of her life juice . &quot;
the Bank of England will hold interest rates at 0.25 %
&quot; the Bank of England is expected to announce that interest rates will remain unchanged , after weak economic growth and the weak@@ ening of inflation have damp@@ ened spec@@ ulation over an increase . &quot;
&quot; the Bank of England war@@ ns that economic growth will remain &quot; &quot; s@@ lugg@@ ish &quot; &quot; when it kept interest rates on family income in the middle of an intensi@@ fying pressure . &quot;
&quot; the Bank &apos;s policy makers in the Monetary Committee ( M@@ PC ) agreed with 6 to 2 to hold interest rates to 0.25 % , with fewer members in this month , as weak economic growth weak@@ ened support for an increase . &quot;
&quot; in its quar@@ terly inflation forecast , the Bank reduced its growth forecasts for 2017 to 1.7 % and from 2018 to 1.6 % and warned that the pressure on bud@@ get@@ ary income would continue , whereby inflation in autumn is likely to rise to just under 3 % . &quot;
&quot; but they sign@@ alized that in the next few years , interest rates would be necessary to cur@@ b the inflation heated by the Bre@@ x@@ it and they said that the loan costs might have to rise more than expected in the financial markets . &quot;
the members also agreed to withdraw a part of the Mam@@ mut &apos;s economic package which was published before the Bre@@ x@@ it a year ago .
&quot; it will demand time for financing plan to provide cheaper financial resources for banks in the coming February , although it is said that it will now be expected to provide 15 billion pounds more within the scope of this system - with 115 billion pounds ster@@ ling . &quot;
&quot; after the decision on the interest rate , the Bank said : &quot; in the central pro@@ g@@ nosis of the M@@ PC the gross domestic product ( GDP ) remains weak at short notice , as the pressure on the real income of households continued to strain consumption . &quot;
&quot; in terms of interest rates , it repeated that &quot; a certain stream@@ lining of monetary policy &quot; would be required for the cooling of inflation and a &quot; somewhat larger &quot; extent than the markets expect . &quot;
the markets are currently forec@@ asting the first increase in the third quarter of the next year and another in 2020 .
&quot; however , the Bank stressed that elev@@ ations would be &quot; gradual &quot; and &quot; limited . &quot; &quot;
forecasts to 2019 illustrate how the market is set to change .
it has maintained its growth forecast to 1.8 % in 2018 .
the Po@@ und fell after these news from the dollar and the euro .
&quot; the po@@ und fell by 0.5 % to 1,@@ 31 US dollars and fell by 0.4 % to 1,@@ 11 Euro . &quot;
&quot; the decision to no change is due after the latest dis@@ ap@@ pointing growth figures have damp@@ ened the rising expectations of interest in interest , and GDP increased to 0.3 % in the second quarter of 0.2 % in the previous three months . &quot;
&quot; growth is expected to be 0.3 % in the third quarter , although it will recover after the Bank at the end of the year . &quot;
&quot; the recent inflation report provided little enthusiasm for households , which are affected by rising inflation and low wages , as the shar@@ pen@@ ing becomes worse first before it becomes better . &quot;
&quot; she added that monetary policy in the next few years cannot prevent income from income , &quot; &quot; she added that wages will be &quot; &quot; clear &quot; &quot; at the end of their three @-@ year forecasts . &quot;
&quot; the economy is also strengthened by the rising demand for British goods , which is attri@@ but@@ able to the weak Po@@ und , which is compens@@ ated for a portion of lower consumption expenditure . &quot;
&quot; the decision comes a year after lowering interest rates to 0,25 % last August following the sho@@ cking EU vote , which caused the sin@@ king of the pounds . &quot;
the bank estimates that it will probably take four years until this will reach the prices and the economy .
&quot; prior to the last judgement of the Bank on interest rates , the call for interest rates rose as inflation increased pressure on hard @-@ pressed households , with three political decision makers in July demanded an increase to 0.5 % . &quot;
&quot; inflation in the past month of 2.9 % decreased to 2.6 % in June , although the Bank said it was expected and will attract it over the coming months . &quot;
&quot; the Bank said that exceeding 2 % is attri@@ but@@ able to &quot; &quot; wholly &quot; &quot; attri@@ but@@ able to the weak Po@@ und . &quot;
&quot; Andrew Mont@@ lake , Director of Cor@@ eco Mort@@ gage Bro@@ kers , said : &quot; in view of the recent decline in s@@ wap rates , the mort@@ gage market is likely to become more competitive again , as the len@@ ders are looking for businesses and want to end the year in a positive manner . &quot;
&quot; the market looks particularly well for those in which the existing deals will exp@@ ire and the new mort@@ g@@ ages close , and many with toll free options and low rates become increasingly popular . &quot;
&quot; N@@ HS ( National Health Service ) shall prescri@@ be controversial HIV drug 10,000 people &quot;
patients will receive access to a &quot; transform@@ ative &quot; HIV prevention treatment starting September after a fight before the High Court .
&quot; N@@ HS England announced that pre @-@ exposure proph@@ yla@@ xis ( pre@@ p ) , which can reduce the risk of infection in high risk patients by around 86 percent , is now supplied by healthcare via a first three @-@ year study for estimated 10,000 people . &quot;
&quot; he agreed to finance the trial after the App@@ eals Court confirmed a ruling by the Supreme Court of Justice last year , after which the N@@ HS had the authority to pay for the pre@@ p despite the claim that the local authorities should finance it . &quot;
&quot; the chess train announced on Thursday was welcomed by N@@ HS England leader Simon St@@ ev@@ ens as &quot; &quot; important new intervention &quot; , &quot; while the National Aids Trust ( NAT ) described this as a &quot; decisive moment . &quot; &quot;
&quot; sexual health clinics in London , Bri@@ gh@@ ton , Manchester , Liverpool and She@@ ff@@ ield will be among the first to enable the registration of people , and further clinics will follow in October before it will be introduced throughout England in April 2018 . &quot;
pre@@ p exposure phy@@ la@@ xis ( pre@@ p ) is a result of HIV preparations which are taken before sex in order to reduce the risk of HIV infection .
studies have shown that pre@@ p significantly reduces HIV transmission in infection areas .
taking pre@@ p before sexual intercourse means that just enough drugs are present in the body of a person to prevent HIV infection .
such medications can be taken every day or so already two hours before sexual intercourse .
&quot; those who are eligible for treatment include gay or bis@@ exual men , trans@@ sexual and individuals with HIV positive partners who have not been successfully treated . &quot;
&quot; in clinics , appropriate participants are identified to agree to the study including men , women , trans@@ gen@@ ders and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not known by anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment . &quot;
people who live in England and are registered with a family doctor may also opt @-@ in for possible participation in their local sex clinic .
the program will be £ 10 million and N@@ HS England signed a contract for delivery of the medicines this week following an international competitive sourcing .
&quot; the study aims to assess the entire potential of pre@@ p by collecting and implementing clinical evidence , as being used in a large scale . &quot;
&quot; St@@ ev@@ ens said : &quot; &quot; this great new intervention should complement and over@@ take the far @-@ reaching and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV . &quot;
it is another milestone in the more than three decades of ongoing progress in cop@@ ing with one of the greatest health challenges of mankind . &quot;
&quot; Deb@@ or@@ ah Gold , Chief Executive at NAT ( National Aids Trust ) , said : &quot; this is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV . &quot;
&quot; pre@@ p , if targeted towards vulnerable and endangered humans , provides the opportunity to change the English HIV epide@@ mic . &quot;
&quot; from September onwards , people with high HIV risk will have access to this N@@ HS @-@ funded study in England to develop a new instrument which is really individually controlled and is not subject to negotiation with a partner , which leads to the improvement of many , many lives . &quot;
we sincer@@ ely welcome this announcement . &quot;
&quot; Ian Green , Chairman of the Terr@@ ence Hig@@ gins Trust , said : &quot; the priority must now be that the study will be carried out quickly across the country and that no one who has a risk for HIV is left behind . &quot;
&quot; now , as the pre@@ p test medicine has been obtained , we are on the best way to protect more than 10,000 HIV @-@ infected people . &quot;
&quot; Shar@@ on Ho@@ dg@@ son , Minister of Health Minister , said : &quot; the beginning of the pre@@ p trial is welcome and over@@ due after months of delays and delayed implementation by the government . &quot;
the evidence shows how transform@@ ative this drug may be part of our approach to HIV prevention and end the transmission of this life @-@ changing infection .
this attempt brings us a step closer to understanding the benefits of pre@@ p .
&quot; now it is important that this study will be carried out as soon as possible throughout the country to protect persons who are HIV infected , and that they will contribute to the completion of the spread of HIV in society . &quot;
living the great life : me@@ zz@@ anine and clever designer tricks have turned this little Ear@@ ls Court flat into a generous home
&quot; Jo@@ anne Lei@@ gh , a former ban@@ ker with a passion for real estate , fell in 2014 from a large house in Kni@@ ghts@@ bridge to Ear@@ ls Court Apartment . &quot;
it is on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne Terrace - and it is a proof of the new design that Jo@@ anne did not pack her bags and sold her bags .
&quot; before that I lived with my ex in Kni@@ ghts@@ bridge in a much larger room , &quot; &quot; says Jo@@ anne . &quot;
I looked for something comparable to my price .
&quot; I was shown this apartment in Ear@@ ls Court , and she had the same high ceilings . &quot;
I fell in love with them and made an offer this day . &quot;
&quot; since the first visit , the 1,000 square foot of the apartment has been completely over@@ hau@@ led . &quot;
originally a one @-@ room property with a ne@@ sted layout - one had to go through the kitchen to enter the bedroom - wanted to add Jo@@ anne &apos;s storage room and a me@@ zz@@ anine to optimally use the generous ceiling height .
&quot; I wanted high ceilings , large windows , lots of light . &quot;
&quot; that was my request , &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; for this purpose , she commissioned the architectural and design studio Du@@ ck &amp; S@@ hed of Er@@ fan Az@@ adi from Not@@ ting Hill to use 12.5 feet high ceilings and to create a home that was not just a development , but also a place for Jo@@ anne &apos;s life . &quot;
&quot; the ceiling was not large enough to place two rooms above each other , so that the architectural challenge consisted in creating a me@@ zz@@ anine in which one could stand . &quot;
&quot; Er@@ fan had to think cre@@ atively , in order to solve the issue . &quot;
&quot; the ste@@ el@@ works are quite complicated , &quot; he explains . &quot;
&quot; we had to arrange the rooms so that they were st@@ acked on each other , without having to b@@ ade . &quot;
&quot; it was not just about building a simple platform , but to put the steel in such a way that it had the right height for the function above or below . &quot;
&quot; this arrangement enabled Er@@ fan to place two rooms at full height , with a lot of additional drama . &quot;
&quot; for the me@@ zz@@ anine , a classic copper light window from Ret@@ rou@@ vi@@ us over@@ looks the gl@@ amor@@ ous living area . &quot;
&quot; mir@@ r@@ ored gold furniture , silver acc@@ ents and vintage Ser@@ ge Mou@@ ille lighting set the style for the program . &quot;
&quot; the use of mirrors plays a role in adding theatre , space and light . &quot;
&quot; at both ends , a short cor@@ ridor is mir@@ r@@ ored to allow it to work longer . &quot;
&quot; in the kitchen , the mir@@ r@@ oring feels like a window in another room . &quot;
at the entrance offers mir@@ r@@ ored units space for all the cut@@ lery and j@@ ars of Jo@@ anne .
&quot; through the perception of a gl@@ amor@@ ous space , the beauty of the living room can shut down the kitchen if it is not used . &quot;
fol@@ dable kitchens are nothing new .
the special thing about this is that it is a garage door .
&quot; a bit of engineering went inside , &quot; &quot; explains Er@@ fan of the steel reinforced , ven@@ e@@ ered MDF door . &quot;
&quot; it is counter@@ balanced so that when you slide the door , very easily gli@@ des . &quot;
&quot; thanks to the clever use of space and storage space , Jo@@ anne could gain additional 16 m ² , an additional bedroom and an improved layout . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the day you will sell the land - or how your property is appreciated , &quot; says Er@@ fan . &quot;
&quot; in a ru@@ di@@ mentary form , a real estate agent will enter and calculate a calculation based on the size of the floor . &quot;
&quot; here they have managed to enlarge the floor space and at the same time use high @-@ quality materials , which give the room its luxurious advantage . &quot;
&quot; the materials are the things that you touch and which help to create an emotional bond in a home , &quot; &quot; says Er@@ fan . &quot;
&quot; you do not love yourself in the electrical outlets in the walls .
&quot; these are important , but they do not play with your heart . &quot;
it shows that an apartment can transform itself with a good design and increased square footage of some standard in something quite astonishing .
&quot; indeed , like Jo@@ anne , you could decide not to leave it . &quot;
brothers fighting for a $ 500 million real estate imperial
&quot; two brothers are four decades after their Italian family founded the Dy@@ nasty , in an analysis of one of the largest real estate imperial Vict@@ ori@@ as worth more than $ 500 million . &quot;
&quot; the former director of the Carl@@ ton football club &apos; and developer Colin De Lu@@ tis lives in a villa in To@@ or@@ ak , only three doors from his younger brother Paul . he brought him to the Supreme Court to clarify how their property and their assets are to be divided . &quot;
&quot; Paul wanted to withdraw from the family business since 2014 , but a sharp argument about the separation will take place in the Supreme Court . &quot;
&quot; together with her mother Anna , the brothers have accumulated 38 properties worth more than half a billion dollars , since the family bought a shop in Smith Street , Coll@@ ing@@ wood since 1973 . &quot;
the West@@ co jeans family established there and grew to a chain of 160 retail stores .
it was sold for USD 85 million in 1999 .
&quot; this money has been invested in real estate , and De Lu@@ tis &apos;s portfolio now includes offices in the city center , the development areas of Br@@ uns@@ wick and Sor@@ ren@@ to , the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Bul@@ ler , as well as shopping centres in the subur@@ b . &quot;
&quot; after an agreement with her dec@@ eased father , Colin - from Paul as &quot; main operator and the dominant personality &quot; in the De Lu@@ tis family - about two thirds of the company &apos;s assets and Paul about one third . &quot;
a court file states that this means that Colin has possession of $ 316 million and Paul worth of 176 million dollars .
the division of real estate and cash has proved to be a problem for Paul .
&quot; the divisions proposed by Colin drew him with what I thought for the best objects , &quot; he wrote in 2015 in a first Aff@@ id@@ av@@ it . &quot;
&quot; last Friday , after several failed attempts , the first hearing of the Supreme Court of Justice took place . &quot;
&quot; the brothers now fight for control of the existing business - from which Colin , as Paul claims to have excluded him . &quot;
&quot; Colin argued that this is not true , but raises Paul to manage some pos@@ sessions in@@ competent . &quot;
&quot; in an early Aff@@ id@@ av@@ it , which was submitted by Colin , he says he hopes to settle the argument . &quot;
&quot; my Italian heritage states that the family is the most important priority , &quot; he wrote . &quot;
&quot; the costs rise in the event , with hundreds of pages with aff@@ id@@ av@@ its , e @-@ mails and reports from companies , among them Del@@ o@@ itte , Pit@@ cher Partners and Charter K@@ eck C@@ ram@@ er , and with leading lawyers , among them Allan M@@ yers , Q@@ C , and from both parties held law firms . &quot;
&quot; Mrs. De Lu@@ tis and her dec@@ eased husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who run milk bars and delic@@ acies from the late 1950s , and in the early se@@ ven@@ ties bought a shop in Br@@ uns@@ wick . &quot;
&quot; they used the security to buy the Coll@@ ing@@ wood property , in which Colin opened the first Je@@ ans@@ laden of the family . &quot;
Colin says he started West@@ co there when he was &quot; in my last years of High School when Paul was still a small child ( about 10 years old ) .
&quot; Anna De Lu@@ tis says that she and Luigi , who died in 2012 , hoped to pass on her property to her sons . &quot;
&quot; Luigi said often to me that he never wanted the brothers to come to court , &quot; she wrote . &quot;
&quot; two other brothers , Mark and Luke , are no longer part of De Lu@@ tis group , where Colin claims that Mark when leaving the company paid 10 million dollars and Luke 26 million dollars . &quot;
&quot; both Luke and Mark , Paul says about the conditions of their financial separation . &quot;
&quot; Colin drew back very much , although he was a former AF@@ L board member and after a biography from the year 2015 by Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ire , he was the best friend of the TV star . &quot;
Fair@@ fax Media took contact with Colin and Paul De Lu@@ tis and their lawyers .
&quot; only Colin answered by SMS , to say &quot; I can really not say much , &quot; because the case is before the courts . &quot;
&quot; it is very , very sad that my brother Paul decided to acc@@ use me and pull our sur@@ name through the dishes , &quot; he wrote . &quot;
&quot; in mid @-@ 2016 , Colin wrote in a letter to the court that he tried to fulfill the demands of his brother . &quot;
&quot; our father did not wish that Paul and I would end up in our current dispute , &quot; he said and added that he still hope for a solution . &quot;
on Friday this hope seemed to be over .
&quot; our affair will be solved by the courts in the near future , &quot; Colin wrote . &quot;
Tr@@ umps of new Chief of Staff plans to limit the president &apos;s media ab@@ stin@@ ence .
others have tried and failed .
maybe John F. Kelly might actually do it .
&quot; if so , he will be the first . &quot;
&quot; POL@@ IT@@ ICO reports that the new Chief of Staff of the White House plans to limit the flow of information to President Tr@@ ump , including news media reports - hoping to keep the boss on a uniform course . &quot;
here is a piece of Rep@@ orter Jos@@ h Daw@@ sey :
&quot; when John F. Kelly , the new Chief of Staff of the White House , met with leading employees at his first working day , he represented a major problem in President Donald Tr@@ umps White House which he wants to repair : bad information that comes into the hands of the president . &quot;
&quot; Kelly told the staff that information about him should flow - whether on paper or in brief@@ ings , because the President would make better decisions if he would receive good information . &quot;
&quot; Kell@@ ys diagnosis makes sense , but others have tried to t@@ ame tr@@ ump by monitoring its media control . &quot;
&quot; President Tr@@ umps relationship to television reaches decades back - and now , where he is in the White House , his TV advertising is still strong . &quot;
&quot; when candidate Tr@@ ump was angry with unfair reporting , it was productive to show him that he received a fair reporting of jobs that were to be persu@@ aded , &quot; said the former campaign advis@@ er Sam N@@ un@@ berg in February opposite Poli@@ tico . &quot;
&quot; Poli@@ ti@@ cos Tara pal@@ mer@@ i wrote at the time that &quot; the key to keep Tr@@ umps Twitter habit under control , according to six former electoral campaig@@ ners in it , to ensure that his personal media consumption includes a steady praise . &quot;
okay .
but the idea that Tr@@ umps &apos;s Twitter habit was ever &quot; under control &quot; is ridi@@ culous .
perhaps these campaign officials know something we don &apos;t know yet - that Tr@@ umps Twe@@ ets without their intervention would have included even more fuel .
we will probably never learn something about the twe@@ ets that Tr@@ ump has not sent .
&quot; if his employees managed to keep it away from him a few times , their efforts have been worthwhile . &quot;
but no one has consistently prevented it from calling out Tr@@ ump contro@@ versy .
&quot; part of the problem is that people in a White House , which is composed of competing parties , will always try to advance their own agenda by presenting Tr@@ ump material that may possibly promote their views from the world . &quot;
&quot; POL@@ IT@@ ICO - very busy with this story , reported in May about the preference of advis@@ ors to give the President of strategic reasons dou@@ bt@@ ful information . &quot;
this was an example described by Rep@@ orter Sh@@ ane Gold@@ macher :
&quot; current and former Tr@@ ump @-@ officials say that Tr@@ ump can react like a vul@@ cano on negative press cuts , especially those with sham@@ eful le@@ aks , and that he will find out where they come from . &quot;
&quot; that was exactly what happened at the end of February when someone accused the President a printed copy of an article by Got@@ New@@ s.com , the website of the Internet Prov@@ oc@@ at@@ eurs Charles C. Johnson , who accused the Deputy Chief of Staff K@@ atie Wal@@ sh , &quot; to be the source behind a he@@ ap of le@@ aks &quot; in the White House . &quot;
&quot; although Johnson was permanently banned from Twitter because of chic@@ ane , or that he offered no concrete evidence or that he expressed false alleg@@ ations in the past and re@@ vo@@ ke them . &quot;
Tr@@ ump read the article and started asking employees about Wal@@ sh .
&quot; Gold@@ macher added that the then Chief of Staff Rein@@ ce Pri@@ eb@@ us and the General Secretary of the White House , Rob Porter , &quot; tried to implement a system to manage and document the paper@@ work and document the tr@@ ump . &quot;
how did that work ?
Kelly tries three months later to do the same .
&quot; perhaps he will prove himself as an effective manager as a pri@@ eb@@ us , but Tr@@ ump is still his impul@@ sive self , and his advis@@ ers still asp@@ ire to influence . &quot;
these un@@ changeable factors make Kell@@ ys &apos;s mission very difficult .
most wanted crimin@@ als get post by Euro@@ pol
&quot; since the address is unknown , the help of the population will be asked and hoped . &quot;
the police in all of Europe disp@@ at@@ ched in this summer ( virtual ) post@@ cards to dangerous crimin@@ als on the run .
&quot; since the addresses of the sought @-@ after crimin@@ als are naturally not known , references from the population will be collected and asked . &quot;
&quot; Euro@@ pol reported on Friday from the action , which follows the winter season on the &quot; &quot; Most W@@ anted &quot; &quot; Advent Calendar . &quot;
&quot; the experiences would have shown that many cur@@ sory notes are hiding at the destinations of the holiday destinations , the name of Euro@@ pol . &quot;
you have compiled 21 post@@ cards for selected crimin@@ als from 21 EU countries .
&quot; since 2016 , the website www.@@ e@@ um@@ ost@@ wanted , more than 2.5 million times has been viewed . &quot;
&quot; 36 of the online applications could have been arrested so far , at least eleven of them due to evidence after the publication on the website . &quot;
travelers negotiate a dit@@ ch and return to the &apos; milli@@ on@@ aire &apos; series &apos;
&quot; some of the weal@@ thi@@ est home@@ owners of the West Mid@@ lands stand back with some determined trav@@ eller on the foot of the war , who have tra@@ ded a tren@@ ch drawn by the church to rec@@ laim a field in front of their man@@ sions . &quot;
&quot; travelers have par@@ ked their 20 car@@ av@@ ans in a field outside of a prosper@@ ous road of Soli@@ h@@ ull , which is called the &quot; milli@@ on@@ aire series . &quot; &quot;
&quot; they brought horses , babies , and an army of v@@ ans after they were thrown out in May without being deter@@ red by a tren@@ ch dig@@ ged by the Council to prevent their sei@@ zur@@ es . &quot;
the tac@@ tical group found a gap in the defense units and squ@@ ee@@ zed their vehicles through a section that remained un@@ hin@@ dered to find a way .
&quot; angry residents have pushed the Council of Soli@@ h@@ ull , who said it was &quot; useless to deal with the problem . &quot;
&quot; an anonymous inhabit@@ ant said : &quot; &quot; they went there on Monday evening after they were sent from Bentley He@@ ath , where they threw stones on the pass@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; the Council has to be forced through shame on implementation , as it was useless when dealing with the problem . &quot;
&quot; the travellers were there in May , were moved and are now back . &quot;
&quot; more came last night , probably today even more . &quot;
&quot; she added : &quot; &quot; the Birmingham Council knows how to deal with it by holding long instruction to protect their parks . &quot;
&quot; I live on the Stre@@ ets@@ brook Road and I &apos;m not happy to continue paying my com@@ mon@@ place , if the Council can &apos;t even stop it . &quot;
&quot; a resident who did not want to be named said : &quot; &quot; it is ridi@@ culous , we have just seen the last round of these travellers only to be lo@@ oted by another round . &quot;
&quot; the numbers have increased this time , and one even saw a horse in the park area . &quot;
&quot; a spokes@@ person of the Council of Soli@@ h@@ ull said : &quot; &quot; we are aware of an un@@ authorised camp on the country beyond the Stre@@ ets@@ brook Road and work with the police of Soli@@ h@@ ul@@ ls . we take the necessary legal steps to move them on as quickly as possible . &quot;
&quot; to support our collection of evidence , it is very important that as many residents as possible report an anti @-@ social or criminal conduct in the police by calling 101 . &quot;
&quot; this helps to create a picture of the situation in which the court must check , when we submit our case . &quot;
made of Birk@@ enhof is Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise
the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise is made from the former Hotel Birk@@ enhof .
&quot; the house in front of the gates of Freuden@@ stadt is currently being renovated and will be opened again on March 1 , next year . &quot;
these are good news for the city .
&quot; due to the closing of the Birk@@ enhof hotel by the former ambience Betriebs@@ gesellschaft mbH on April 13 , 2014 , some 30,000 overnight stays were lost per year and also revenue through the local tax . &quot;
&quot; in the fall of 2014 , in the face of dramatic rising numbers of refugees who came to the county , the hotel building was offered as a collective accommodation which provided controversial discussions . &quot;
the city prevented the accommodation of asylum seek@@ ers by setting up a building plan to secure the area as a hotel location .
the decision was not un@@ disp@@ uted at that time in the Municipal Council .
&quot; however , especially Freuden@@ stadt &apos;s mayor Julian O@@ ss@@ wald defended the hotel location and already spoke of serious interested parties in the house . &quot;
he should keep right .
&quot; the group of Lu@@ is@@ enh@@ otels , with Managing Director Birgit Sch@@ erer , based in Bad Berg@@ z@@ ab@@ ern , has bought the former Hotel Birk@@ enhof at a voluntary auction in Berlin and wants to make it a house of the three @-@ star @-@ plus category under the name Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise . &quot;
the group has four houses with the Freuden@@ stadt facility .
two of them in Bad Berg@@ z@@ ab@@ ern and one in Bad Herren@@ al@@ b .
&quot; hot hotel Lu@@ ise , Lu@@ is@@ en@@ park , Park@@ hotel Lu@@ ise and now Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise . &quot;
&quot; the former Birk@@ enhof Hotel has long been standing building sh@@ utt@@ les in front of the entrance , and when you enter the house it becomes clear that extensive renovation works will be made . &quot;
&quot; the floors have been pulled out , ceilings partially disman@@ tled , old bath tu@@ bs removed from the rooms . &quot;
the entire hotel building is a single construction site .
there is still much to do until March .
&quot; it is actually a nice place , &quot; says Thomas Sch@@ erer in conversation with our newspaper . &quot;
everything should be renewed in the Black Forest style .
&quot; the rooms are equipped with large walk @-@ in showers , the entrance area is re@@ designed , new windows are built . &quot;
&quot; everything should later be &quot; &quot; beautiful bourgeois &quot; , &quot; as Thomas Sch@@ erer expresses . &quot;
&quot; we want to make a piece of jewelry . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; swimming pool , wellness area and a meeting room belong to the facilities . &quot;
&quot; you don &apos;t want to position yourself at the high level of hotels in Lau@@ ter@@ bad , but already on a high @-@ level downtown level , Sch@@ erer empha@@ sizes . &quot;
&quot; the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise , with its approximately 60 rooms , wants to spread wide , out@@ lines Sch@@ erer further . &quot;
&quot; individual vac@@ ation@@ ers , groups or business people should feel comfortable in the hotel . &quot;
&quot; talks with OB Julian O@@ ss@@ wald and tourism director Michael Kr@@ ause have already led him , so Sch@@ erer . &quot;
the ideas of the city are identical with those of the hotel group .
&quot; we are on the same line . &quot;
&quot; according to the amount of investments , Thomas Sch@@ erer does not want to specify exactly . &quot;
&quot; just under one million euros , he expects . &quot;
&quot; the external plants are also brought to foreg@@ round , which is already clearly visible . &quot;
&quot; in a courtyard there is a large terrace , which is open to the restaurant , which is public . &quot;
Thomas Sch@@ erer is optim@@ istic : &quot; Freuden@@ stadt is a good market . &quot;
Russia @-@ affair : us @-@ Special Inter@@ medi@@ ator sets Grand Jury
&quot; in the Russia affair around US President Donald Tr@@ ump , special promot@@ er Robert Mu@@ eller is said to have used a so @-@ called Grand Jury after a report . &quot;
&quot; the panel started work in recent weeks , and wrote the &apos; Wall Street Journal &apos; by calling on the matter entrusted to them . &quot;
the paper took the step as a sign that Mu@@ eller extended and intensi@@ fied his investigation .
&quot; the station CN@@ N reported , there are already initial charges of the Gre@@ mi@@ dium in connection with a meeting between the m@@ umps of the oldest son and a Russian lawyer . &quot;
U.S. intelligence services have been acc@@ using the Kre@@ m@@ lin for a long time being targeted in the 2016 presidential election campaign .
Mu@@ eller examined whether there were agreements between Tr@@ umps electoral campaigns and Moscow .
the investig@@ ators focus on several men who acted as advis@@ ors to the re@@ public@@ ans in the election campaign .
&quot; according to reports , Mu@@ eller also took more and more tr@@ umps private and business environment under the micro@@ scope . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; &quot; Washington Post &quot; &quot; wrote several weeks ago that the Special Inter@@ medi@@ ator Tr@@ ump has personally moved into the centre and investigate whether the President in the course of the affair may hin@@ der the judi@@ ci@@ ary . &quot;
&quot; the main task of Grand Jur@@ ys is to examine the present evidence in possible cases of crime , and decide whether to be charged . &quot;
&quot; therefore , Grand Jur@@ ys are also called count chambers . &quot;
&quot; in most cases , they are turned on when it comes to larger and controversial cases . &quot;
the procedure is always carried out behind closed doors .
the body can also be turned on by the public prosec@@ utor to charge people for the hearing under E@@ id .
&quot; according to the radio station CN@@ N , already dischar@@ ges were issued , which revol@@ ve around the encounter between Donald Tr@@ ump J@@ r. and a Russian lawyer . &quot;
&quot; people who were involved in the meeting were invited to a statement , called it in the report . &quot;
&quot; in addition , they should provide documents . &quot;
&quot; in addition to Tr@@ ump J@@ r. , Tr@@ umps were also consultants and son @-@ in @-@ law Jar@@ ed K@@ us@@ h@@ ner , as well as his former Elec@@ tor Paul Man@@ a@@ fort during the interview . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday evening in U.S. television , legal experts said that the sub@@ stitution show that Mu@@ eller would not let itself inti@@ mid@@ ated in his work and that he should act quickly if necessary . &quot;
&quot; however , it does not necessarily mean that the Grand Jury will be turned on at the end to decide on the elevation of an indictment . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , the de@@ composition of the ab@@ yss will be the beginning of a new phase in the investigation and a new cause for concern for President Tr@@ ump . &quot;
&quot; in the midst of the new revel@@ ations , the president took a speech in West Virginia on Thursday evening to portra@@ y the Russia affair as a campaign of his political opponents . &quot;
&quot; the Russia history is a total invention , &quot; &quot; said Tr@@ ump . &quot;
&quot; the theme gives the democr@@ ats a way to &quot; feel good , &quot; because they have nothing else to talk about . &quot;
&quot; his special advis@@ er T@@ y Cob@@ b stated in a statement , he knows nothing about the inser@@ tion of a Grand Jury . &quot;
&quot; but this work usually works in secret , he stressed . &quot;
the White House advoc@@ ates all measures that accelerated the work of the Special Agent in a &quot; fair &quot; way .
the former F@@ BI chief James Com@@ ey said three times that not against the president .
&quot; there is no reason to assume that something has changed , it was in the explanation . &quot;
but Mu@@ eller had only been used after Tr@@ ump Com@@ ey had fired .
&quot; because of this r@@ ash , accus@@ ations against Tr@@ ump were loud , he wanted to hin@@ der the judi@@ ci@@ ary . &quot;
&quot; Com@@ ey said in June ahead of a Senate Committee , Tr@@ ump asked him for a setting of the investigations against the former national security advis@@ er Michael Fl@@ yn@@ n . &quot;
the President is under great pressure because of the investigation .
&quot; following the representation of US media , the White House gathered material against the special promot@@ er and its staff . &quot;
the dissolved spec@@ ulation about whether Tr@@ ump Mo@@ eller wants to release .
&quot; unlike an independent special promot@@ er of Congress , such as the Wat@@ erg@@ ate affair around the later president Richard Ni@@ xon , Mu@@ eller has a position in which he could theore@@ tically be inspired by the President of the Ministry of Justice . &quot;
&quot; however , several sen@@ ators of both parties want to prevent such a step . &quot;
&quot; two groups of repub@@ lican and democratic sen@@ ators present legislative proposals on Thursday , after which the special promot@@ er could no longer be dismis@@ sed . &quot;
Ant@@ arc@@ tica : giant ic@@ eberg drives in the Ant@@ arc@@ tica
in the western Ant@@ arc@@ tic a gigantic ic@@ eberg was solved by the scar@@ c@@ ely seven @-@ fold great@@ ness of Berlin .
this shared the Bre@@ mer@@ ha@@ ven@@ er Alfred @-@ Weg@@ ener @-@ Institut for Polar and Marine Research on Wednesday .
&quot; the col@@ os@@ sus spann@@ ed over a tril@@ lion tons and 58@@ 00 square kilometers , now driving to the north and will probably need two , three years until it mel@@ ted . &quot;
&quot; with 175 kilometres of length and a width of up to 50 kilometres , it is one of the biggest iron gi@@ ants that have registered researchers over the past three decades . &quot;
there is no danger for people from him .
&quot; to what extent climate change has played a role in the demo@@ li@@ tion of the ic@@ eberg , according to research indications is un@@ clear . &quot;
&quot; in total , there have been a series of unusual break@@ dow@@ ns of ice @-@ dow@@ ns in the region for about 30 years , writes the US research centre for snow and ice ( N@@ SI@@ DC ) in a factor background . &quot;
&quot; according to many researchers , this could be related to global warming . &quot;
the broken col@@ os@@ sus has so far been a part of the Lar@@ sen @-@ C notes .
Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s swi@@ ms on the sea and is fed by big gl@@ aci@@ ers .
it continues to grow further into the sea and breaks down regularly .
the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s lies south of South America almost at the top of the Ant@@ arc@@ tic peninsula .
&quot; North of this sh@@ ank , the balance of wa@@ xing and ab@@ ort was disturbed some years ago . &quot;
&quot; a complete Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s is broken down there , A@@ WI @-@ researcher Daniela Jan@@ sen writes . &quot;
&quot; there is a lot to say that the Lar@@ sen @-@ C sh@@ ank is in danger , as the front edge has never with@@ drawn as far as currently . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the ice sla@@ b stands under tension and can crum@@ ble if a piece is broken at a key point . &quot;
&quot; the melting of Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s and Eis@@ berg does not increase the sea level , as they float on the water and ice cream so much water as it produces after melting . &quot;
&quot; however , the loss of the sh@@ ank leads to the fact that the gl@@ aci@@ ers can flow directly into the sea and drain much faster than before . &quot;
&quot; this could possibly increase the sea level , but only in a little extent , the British research project writes for the observation of Ant@@ arc@@ tica ( Mi@@ das ) . &quot;
&quot; according to A@@ WI information with almost 50 000 square kilometres , the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s is the fourth largest fe@@ eder of Ant@@ arc@@ tica . &quot;
&quot; at the transition from the mainland , it is up to 700 metres thick , at the front edge to the free ocean some 200 meters . &quot;
there it breaks regularly .
&quot; although it is a natural phenomenon and is not aware of any direct connection to climate change , the ice sign is now in a more dangerous position , &quot; &quot; said Martin O &apos;@@ Lear@@ y from the British Sw@@ an@@ sea University . &quot;
&quot; that is the longest retreat since the beginning of the record , &quot; he also confirmed . &quot;
&quot; scientists are disp@@ uted whether the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s will continue to grow or fall back in the long term , and may collapse , said his colleague Adrian Luck@@ man and added : &quot; &quot; our models say that it will be less stable . &quot;
but this development will take decades .
&quot; even if these researchers did not cause the demo@@ li@@ tion of this gigantic ic@@ eberg on climate change , however , in recent decades many ice @-@ dow@@ ns of the Ant@@ arc@@ tic Peninsula have fallen apart . &quot;
this long skir@@ t of Ant@@ arc@@ tica extends towards South America .
&quot; according to data from the British Ant@@ arc@@ tic Survey research programme , the ice surface of the Ant@@ arc@@ tic peninsula has declined by 28 000 square kilometres since the 1950s . &quot;
&quot; as a result , the temperature increase has contributed to the decline . &quot;
&quot; in the past 50 years , the Ant@@ arc@@ tic peninsula war@@ ms around three degrees and thus t@@ ame to the areas where the temperature increases the fastest . &quot;
CD@@ U wants Hau@@ st@@ ari@@ f at the staff
&quot; because it becomes increasingly difficult to occupy vac@@ ancy positions , the CD@@ U asks to leave the employers association to become more attractive . &quot;
&quot; only shortly before the summer break , the date of the circle has passed through 41 new jobs in the administration . &quot;
more than 1100 employees and civil servants work for the district administration in M@@ ett@@ mann .
&quot; now , 17 tra@@ inees have left their first working day . &quot;
the apprentic@@ es@@ hips in the circle are obviously very popular .
some 620 entries were recorded for the places to be held this year .
&quot; nevertheless , the group still l@@ acks personnel to cope with the increased demands and tasks . &quot;
&quot; at present , there are still 50 vac@@ ancies at the M@@ ett@@ mann district . &quot;
&quot; among other things , we are looking for doctors and engineers as well as the forces of general administration . &quot;
the CD@@ U now wants to take the initiative together with the F@@ DP and the U@@ W@@ G and oppose the shortage of skilled workers in the administration .
&quot; according to the request of the parties , the administration shall develop a concept for recruitment and personnel development . &quot;
&quot; the aim is to not only cover short @-@ term demand for skilled workers , but to counter@@ act forward @-@ orient@@ ated applicants . &quot;
&quot; the overall concept should orient@@ ate both internally and extern@@ ally , demonstrate concrete measures for cross @-@ entran@@ ts and include an apprentic@@ eship campaign , call CD@@ U , F@@ DP and U@@ W@@ G . &quot;
this sounds like a good approach .
because the circle has to do with personal problems that you didn &apos;t know before .
other cities promote good officials and employees and offer more attractive conditions .
the speech is of a regular &quot; competition of public employers . &quot;
&quot; for this purpose , a high number of employees , who are leaving illness or age @-@ related reasons , comes from the service . &quot;
so high time for action so that no more jobs remain un@@ occupied .
&quot; but Klaus @-@ Dieter Z. , fac@@ tional leader of the CD@@ U , goes beyond the joint application with his party . &quot;
&quot; he long ago made a surprise in the circle of chal@@ k for a f@@ ist surprise when he publicly challenged the personnel costs , and the remaining parties were amazed . &quot;
&quot; people want all the possibilities to be checked , which allow an exit from the municipal employers association . &quot;
&quot; if we don &apos;t come to a satisfying solution here at short notice , the district administration with the unions - perhaps also in cooperation with the county @-@ related cities - should strive for a &quot; &quot; Hau@@ st@@ ari@@ f &quot; , &quot; so peoples . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , the CD@@ U tries to better pay the employees and officials when it actually fores@@ ees collective bar@@ gaining for the public service . &quot;
&quot; the sal@@ aries are currently exactly prescribed , elev@@ ations or more money are only if one changes to a higher level that is oriented toward professional years . &quot;
but the challenges of the circle have grown increasingly in recent years .
&quot; only a few weeks ago , new premises had to be set up in which employees take care of the provisions of the new pro@@ stitution protection law . &quot;
&quot; last but not least by the rising number of asylum seek@@ ers , Land@@ rat Thomas Hen@@ del@@ e and Kreis@@ direktor Martin Richter have a problem : they have too little staff . &quot;
Italy ag@@ grav@@ ates the sound of NGO migrants rescue boats
&quot; &quot; &quot; Italy has warned NGOs that use rescue boats for migrants in the Mediterranean , warned that they should not continue unless they stick to new rules for their operations . &quot;
&quot; if NGOs do not sign a new code of conduct , it is difficult to see how they can continue , &quot; &quot; said Interior Minister Marco Minn@@ iti in an interview with the Turin daily La St@@ amp@@ a . &quot;
Min@@ ni@@ tis &apos;s warning came a day after the Italian authorities had seized a boat of the German aid organisation &apos; Youth Ret@@ tet &apos; because their team had effectively collabor@@ ated with traff@@ ick@@ ers in a manner that facilit@@ ated illegal immigration .
&quot; the relief organisation , which has only been in operation for a year now , refused to speak to detailed alleg@@ ations of the Italian prosec@@ utor Amb@@ ro@@ gio Carto@@ sio . &quot;
&quot; for us , the saving of human life remains our top priority . so we are very sorry that at the moment we cannot operate in the search and rescue zone , &quot; the organisation said in a statement on the social media . &quot;
&quot; we can only judge any accus@@ ations that are currently raised , after we have collected all the information and assess the situation . &quot;
&quot; the Italian authorities had watched the boat from &apos; Youth Ret@@ tet &apos; , the I@@ u@@ v@@ enta , since October . &quot;
&quot; it is suspected that its crew takes on board inf@@ lat@@ able migrants , which are delivered to them directly by traff@@ ick@@ ers , and that the smu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers can depart , so that the ships can be used again . &quot;
&quot; at least one such meeting occurred allegedly only 1.3 miles off the Libyan coast , according to the prosec@@ utor &apos;s act , whose content was published by Italian media . &quot;
&quot; the occupation is suspected of being over@@ seen by the authority of the Italian Coast Guard , the rescue operations in the area for humanitarian grounds and not from any other motives . &quot;
&quot; under the Code of Con@@ duct , boats such as the I@@ u@@ v@@ enta have to have an Italian police officer on board , who monitors their activities . &quot;
&quot; only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue operations have agreed to hold the code : save the Children , Mo@@ as from Malta and Pro @-@ Activ@@ a Open Ar@@ ms from Spain . &quot;
&quot; the latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be deemed unnecessary , but acceptable as they would not bring &quot; significant changes or obstruc@@ tions &quot; of their rescue operations . &quot;
among those who refuse to sign is the Nobel lau@@ re@@ ate organisation Ärzte ohne Grenzen ( MS@@ F ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Minn@@ iti now said that the number of migrants who arrived after the rescue measures in Italy had gone back strongly in recent weeks , suggest@@ ing that efforts to strengthen the Libyan coast@@ guard and cooperation with local citizens have borne fruit . &quot;
&quot; in recent days we have begun to see light at the end of the tunnel , &quot; said the Minister . &quot;
&quot; he announced plans for further talks with Libyan citizens this month about economic development initiatives and with C@@ had , Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants who leave these countries hoping to reach Europe . &quot;
asc@@ ents and Tri@@ als
&quot; nine Wei@@ ler@@ mer Bi@@ ker , the &quot; Berlin out@@ post &quot; and two guest drivers met in Wach@@ en@@ heim in the Nord@@ pf@@ alz region , to enjoy Tri@@ als and Si@@ ghts for four days . &quot;
there were three friendly guides available for this purpose .
the accommodation in the Wach@@ en@@ heimer valley proved to be a good starting point for the tours .
the Burg@@ und@@ y and W@@ einf@@ est of Wach@@ en@@ heim was a welcome extra .
the first tour took place during hot summer temperatures along the vineyards to the Micha@@ el@@ skap@@ elle above Dei@@ des@@ heim .
&quot; view points followed , partly on towers , from which one could look far above the Pf@@ äl@@ zer forest and the up@@ stream levels . &quot;
&quot; in between , there were always longer asc@@ ents , for the long Tri@@ als rewarded . &quot;
on the second day we went to Bad Dür@@ k@@ heim to the Sal@@ ine and to the Volks@@ fest Wur@@ st@@ markt .
&quot; again , a look@@ out point to the look@@ out point , connected by &quot; &quot; flew &quot; &quot; tri@@ als and moderate asc@@ ents . &quot;
at the last two days there were again many altitude metres .
&quot; caves , rocks , towers , castles , ruins and refu@@ ges brought welcome breaks . &quot;
in Bad Dür@@ k@@ heim the bi@@ kers in the open @-@ air inhal@@ atorium cur@@ es Sole .
&quot; also , Neustadt has been headed . &quot;
&quot; after 173 kilometres and almost 4500 al@@ timeter , the group had met the Pf@@ äl@@ zer Wald from its best side - sporty and cul@@ turally . &quot;
console instead of lawn - Bundes@@ liga upgrades for e @-@ sport
&quot; in future , the sports stars are sitting in front of computer con@@ soles , rather than struggling with wind and weather over the stadium race ? &quot;
&quot; fact : e @-@ Sport has long become a serious industry , become a lu@@ cr@@ ative business - big stars , millions of fans and huge tournaments with high scales . &quot;
&quot; this also recognized the first public ca@@ ver@@ ns , which are increasingly involved in this area . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of 2015 the V@@ f@@ L Wolfs@@ burg , later the FC Schal@@ ke 04 and recently joined the V@@ f@@ B Stuttgart , who founded an e @-@ sports department in mid @-@ July and took two pro@@ s for the FIFA 17 computer game . &quot;
&quot; we hope to inspire new young audiences for the V@@ f@@ B , &quot; says CEO Jochen Rö@@ tt@@ ger@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; it is certain , that on this turn , many associations rise . &quot;
&quot; on the next weekend , FIFA organiz@@ es the first &quot; &quot; Interactive Club World Cup &quot; &quot; in London , where the gam@@ ers compete against each other . &quot;
&quot; in addition to Schal@@ ke and Wolfs@@ burg , for example , Manchester City , Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main or the PS@@ V Ein@@ dho@@ ven qualify . &quot;
Robin D@@ utt also sees great potential in the e @-@ sport .
the ex @-@ coach of Bayer Le@@ verk@@ usen and Wer@@ der Bremen now advis@@ es an agency for virtual football players .
&quot; the real football must focus especially with the 14 to 30 @-@ year @-@ olds , that young people are still going to the stadium in the future , &quot; says the 52 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;
&quot; and : the clubs tried to conquer all sorts of markets , especially the Asian ones . &quot;
&quot; with prominent E @-@ sport@@ s@@ men under contract , one could be online far more often on these markets than once a year to send the Bundes@@ liga to Asia . &quot;
what is it all about ?
&quot; in the E @-@ sport , computer games such as &quot; League Of Legends , &quot; &quot; D@@ ota 2 , &quot; &quot; Co@@ unter@@ strike , &quot; or even the football @-@ simulation FIFA to compete on a competitive level . &quot;
&quot; as in normal sports , they have long established li@@ abilities in which the professionals compete against each other . &quot;
&quot; and in Asia @-@ games 2022 , e @-@ sport is already part of the official programme . &quot;
but is it a real sport at all ?
&quot; for many , the idea is quite common . &quot;
Ingo F@@ rob@@ ber also dealt with the question for a long time .
&quot; for the professor at the Deutsche Sp@@ orth@@ ochschule in Cologne , e @-@ sport is a sport because it is competitive and showing many biological and physical responses that one also find in the classical sport - such as increased heart rates , stress reactions , hormon@@ al changes . &quot;
&quot; it also requires cognitive abilities , a technical and tac@@ tical understanding and a fast reaction to reaction . &quot;
&quot; professional gam@@ ers should train not only at the console , but also their bodies and pay attention to the diet . &quot;
&quot; the f@@ ie player is a good player . &quot;
&quot; but also problems : &quot; &quot; dop@@ ing is becoming more and more a topic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; controls are difficult to perform in online games , and in the scene the structures of classic sports were missing . &quot;
the scientist highlights the highly integr@@ ative effect of e @-@ sports .
&quot; players are on the move internationally , that &apos;s like a big global family , there are no cross @-@ cultural barriers . &quot;
a study of the corporate consultancy Del@@ o@@ itte and the Federal Association Interactive entertainment software ( BI@@ U ) pre@@ di@@ cts the e @-@ sport a rapid growth .
&quot; in 2016 , 50 million euros were implemented in Germany , mainly about advertising , sponsor@@ ship and big tournaments . &quot;
&quot; in three years , turnover is expected to lie at 130 million . &quot;
&quot; against the almost 2.4 billion euros of the Bundes@@ liga , this is little . &quot;
&quot; however , the e @-@ sport &quot; is no longer far from other established sports such as hand@@ ball , basketball or ice ho@@ ckey . &quot; &quot;
international are many countries already further .
&quot; great markets are Asia and the USA , where ex @-@ basketball players Sha@@ qu@@ ille O &apos;@@ Ne@@ al and Bas@@ eb@@ all@@ star Alex Rodri@@ gu@@ ez participate in the U.S. Team N@@ RG e@@ Sports . &quot;
Hollywood Ac@@ tor Ash@@ ton Kut@@ cher inv@@ ests in the e@@ Sport betting provider Uni@@ kr@@ n .
there is a lot in Europe too .
&quot; in a Norwegian school , e @-@ sport was introduced as a classroom , says F@@ rob@@ atic . &quot;
&quot; in the Netherlands and France , the football league clubs , according to D@@ utt , are now obliged to establish an e @-@ sports department . &quot;
&quot; in the European comparison , Germany lag@@ s behind , &quot; explains V@@ f@@ B Board Rö@@ tt@@ ger@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; to fall only in nostal@@ gia and to clarify the old times , it is no longer enough . &quot;
&quot; it is a matter of keeping the tradition of the association , but to align the company at the same time on the modern market . &quot;
&quot; we live in a digital world , &quot; &quot; says D@@ utt . &quot;
it is not possible to stick to it that only with football everything remains as it always was .

Michelle Carter because of the lyrics that Conrad Roy puts to blame for suicide .
&quot; a woman from Massachusetts was sentenced to two and a half years , because she encouraged her friend through texts and calls for suicide . &quot;
&quot; Michelle Carter , now 20 , will spend 15 months of her conviction behind bars and five years have been subjected to prob@@ ation . &quot;
Carter was sentenced to Conrad Roy in June because of the neg@@ ligent killing of Conrad Roy who took life on 13 July 2014 .
the father of Roy said on Thursday at the hearing : &quot; my family is in@@ tr@@ insi@@ cally .
my son was my best friend . &quot;
Carter was allowed to remain free until his appeal .
&quot; she had been confronted with a maximum sentence of 20 years , but her legal representatives argued that both she and Mr Roy suffered from a mental illness . &quot;
&quot; dressed in red trousers and a cream coloured bl@@ ouse , Carter stood with tears in her eyes , folded hands and down@@ ward eyes when she was con@@ vic@@ ted . &quot;
&quot; her actions have killed Conrad Roy , &quot; said the prosec@@ utor to the court . &quot;
she finished his life to make her own better .
&quot; she has no responsibility , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; she has shown no re@@ mor@@ se . &quot;
but Car@@ ters lawyer said it was a &quot; terrible circum@@ stance she totally regre@@ t@@ ted .
&quot; however , judge Lawrence Mon@@ iz said , he did not find that her &quot; age or maturity or even her mental illness have a significant impact on their actions . &quot;
&quot; a prosec@@ utor read a statement by Ro@@ ys &apos;s mother Lyn@@ n Roy , who said that there is &quot; no day in which I do not feel the loss of my beloved son . &quot;
&quot; I want him to be proud of me and how I turned up@@ side down . I try to be there for eternity with us , in spite of all my pain that we will carry with us for eternity . &quot;
&quot; Ro@@ ys &apos;s sister , Cam@@ dy@@ n Roy , said that she would never take part in her brother &apos;s wedding or be a aun@@ t for his children . &quot;
&quot; no longer this only person to have with whom I have been together since my birth , is a pain I will always keep with me for the rest of my life , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; the case seems to be a legal preced@@ ent because there is no law in Massachusetts , which makes it a crime to challenge another , commit suicide . &quot;
Carter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead by a carbon mon@@ oxide poison@@ ing in a vehicle in 2014 .
&quot; the case drew national attention , after Car@@ ters revealed text messages that she encouraged him to end his life . &quot;
&quot; hanging up , spring of a building , eche yourself , I don &apos;t know there are many ways , &quot; she said in several news that she had sent in the two weeks before his death , while he was on vacation with his family . &quot;
&quot; in the moments before his suicide she wrote : &quot; you have to do it , Conrad &quot; and &quot; Every@@ thing you need to do is to turn on the generator and you will be free and happy . &quot;
judge Mon@@ iz said Carter was seeking attention by the death of Roy and ordered them to benefit from the case by some press .
the case has divided the legal opinion .
&quot; one of the few who defended Carter was Am@@ anda Kno@@ x , who was con@@ vic@@ ted in 2007 for murder on her British ro@@ ommate in Italy before she was acqu@@ itted two years ago . &quot;
&quot; Mrs. Kno@@ x , 30 years old , published a comment in the Los Angeles Times : &quot; Michelle Carter deserves compassion and help , not prison . &quot;
Joshua Kim@@ me : learning from the new Mini L@@ ame of FC Bayern
&quot; that Joshua Kim@@ me was allowed to run as captain at the Audi Cup as captain , is no coinci@@ dence . &quot;
the FC Bayern tr@@ aut a big season to the Con@@ fed Cup winner - extra motivation does not harm .
&quot; what was different in his place in the cabin , which looked at Joshua Kim@@ me immediately , even though the additional piece of clothing was very , very small . &quot;
&quot; but as far and wide on the second day of the Audi Cup , of course , no Philipp L@@ ahm and no Manuel Neu@@ er had to be seen , he made his grip on his arm . &quot;
&quot; the trainer did not announce it , &quot; the Con@@ fed Cup winner told him after his first deployment as Bavaria Captain . &quot;
&quot; well , the obj@@ ection could have been better than 0 : 2 against SS@@ C Naples . &quot;
but the character of the coach could also imply a hint .
&quot; not the eight year old Ar@@ tur@@ o Vi@@ dal was chosen as a player in the youth players , de@@ bu@@ ffs and especially from the holiday professionals existing C @-@ elf as a guide , but he . &quot;
&quot; as a matter of fact , sugar is distributed to those with a lot of ingredients that one wants to keep in the mood . &quot;
&quot; so who was chosen to take the inheritance of L@@ ahm , can only use a little extra motivation . &quot;
Kim@@ me confirmed : &quot; that &apos;s what you want as a player : take responsibility .
on Wednesday the 22 @-@ year @-@ old fl@@ ared as a mini @-@ l@@ ame over the field .
&quot; right back , that &apos;s his position , the white band@@ age on the arm did her rest . &quot;
&quot; and in general Kim@@ me worked in this initial formation , like the one who can take the helm best in his hand . &quot;
&quot; he gave instructions , trying to direct the un@@ mas@@ ked tro@@ upe . &quot;
&quot; he had the view for the whole , while many others were busy with himself . &quot;
&quot; Vi@@ dal thus , to over@@ play his missing fitness ( not folded ) ; Ren@@ ato San@@ ches therefore , on the devil , get out of the performance of the Asia journey ( also just limited ) ; and Sebastian Ru@@ dy and Ni@@ kl@@ as Sü@@ le did not neg@@ atively drop in their first appearance in the Bayern tri@@ cot . &quot;
08.@@ 11.2015 &#124; Desperate Housewives
&quot; in addition to Kim@@ me , Ru@@ dy went up against the defense , both acted confi@@ dently . &quot;
&quot; the nam@@ ely squ@@ at@@ ched Nap@@ oli storm often did heavy , in addition , Sü@@ le tried a few times in the game @-@ building . &quot;
&quot; his colleague Ru@@ dy showed that &quot; &quot; the result &quot; &quot; was not as we hoped for . &quot;
but he also showed a decent performance during the debut .
&quot; game shift , tempo change : &quot; for this style I was also picked up . &quot;
&quot; how un@@ familiar this Bayern world is still for the new entran@@ ces , one saw in the connection to the game . &quot;
&quot; Ru@@ dy , for example , was not one or two in the cat@@ ac@@ om@@ bs but determined six or seven interviews . &quot;
Kim@@ me said good@@ bye to a few cr@@ un@@ chy statements in the back of his new fellow players .
&quot; there he heard from Sü@@ le an interesting sentence : &quot; &quot; what is going on here , I have already noticed . &quot;
in Bavaria you just have to win any game . &quot;
&quot; after all , he doesn &apos;t have to teach the new one more . &quot;

company content with Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate Minister : economy pra@@ ises Wis@@ sings Tempo
&quot; it was often irre@@ conc@@ il@@ able , the relationship between the country and the regional economy , when E@@ vel@@ ine Lem@@ ke ( Green ) was still Minister of Economy of Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate . &quot;
&quot; this is evident after more than one year , in which the new Minister of Economy Volker Wis@@ sing ( F@@ DP ) is in office . &quot;
chambers and companies from the region speak to T V @-@ inquiry of a change in economic policy - and at the same time the old minister .
&quot; Frank nat@@ us , Chairman of the Association of Tri@@ erer Company ( V@@ TU ) , says : &quot; Wis@@ sing acc@@ esses the wishes of the economy that Lem@@ ke blocked all of them . &quot;
the biggest revers@@ al of the K@@ ehr@@ t@@ wende brings nat@@ us in infrastructure policy : the gap between the Autobahn 1 between Kel@@ berg and A@@ den@@ au is now at the top in the country &apos;s priority list .
&quot; this year , the Ministry hopes to build a planning stage . until 2021 , the building is supposed to stand . &quot;
&quot; a role in the plans of the country also plays the West@@ um@@ geh@@ ung Trier , which is in the urgent need of the Federal Rail@@ road map . &quot;
&quot; the aim is to put the track into operation in December 2020 , says Minister &apos;s spokes@@ man Cornelia Hol@@ tmann . &quot;
&quot; nat@@ us sees in it a sign for supporting regional , but internationally competing companies . &quot;
&quot; the Chamber of Commerce and Industry ( I@@ HK ) Trier , as suggested by Wis@@ sing , is a Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate @-@ Label to increase sales in supermarkets and to stop the trend of German wine exports for ten years . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Wis@@ sing has an open ear for people who want to establish their own company , praise the Chamber of Commerce . &quot;
&quot; the Handwerk@@ sk@@ ammer Trier sees in the new master bonus an additional incentive for young tra@@ inees , says CEO Matthias Schwal@@ bach . &quot;
&quot; a premium of 1000 Euro is en@@ vis@@ aged for the passed master test and 2500 euros , if graduates are self @-@ employed in ten years after master training . &quot;
but the home@@ work list for the country remains long .
&quot; in the planned road construction , fast facts are to be created , at the same time out of the country the necessary personnel , says Jan Glo@@ ck@@ auer , chief executive director of the Chamber of Commerce Trier . &quot;
&quot; of 56 new engineers , who wants to set the Wis@@ sing at the state @-@ run mobility , only 29 positions have been occupied . &quot;
the Chamber of Commerce is calling for more jobs to external offices .
&quot; CD@@ U Fra@@ ction vi@@ ze Christian Bald@@ auf points out the calculations of the Court of Audi@@ tors , the country has invested more than 20 million euros less in the receipt of provincial high@@ ways in 2017 and 2018 . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Frank nat@@ us expects a country &apos;s concept of correc@@ ting the shortage of skilled workers in the region . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the existing broad@@ band expansion in the country is also so@@ ber@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
they compl@@ ain about stock@@ pil@@ ing internet connections and out@@ breaks .
&quot; on the other hand , ex @-@ business minister E@@ vel@@ ine Lem@@ ke is currently out of politics and is still in the Supervisory Board of the wind power company Pro Wind . &quot;
&quot; the Green Group left Lem@@ ke in April to become President of a private university in Karlsruhe , where after four months of dis@@ agreements , the area cleared away . &quot;
&quot; Audi is supposed to change 8@@ 50,000 diesel vehicles - car manufacturers face a counter reaction &quot;
&quot; one day before the announcement of Audi , BMW said that it would offer to update the software in more than 350,000 vehicles . &quot;
&quot; the BMW chairman said that &quot; &quot; there are more intelligent options than driving restrictions &quot; , &quot; and thus referring to European cities - including Munich , where BMW is located - to ban or restrict diesel vehicles . &quot;
Daimler announced on Tuesday that there will be three million Mercedes cars in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions .
none of the companies described the enterprises as a recall .
European car manufacturers have strongly encouraged the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support compliance with rules for carbon dioxide emissions .
&quot; nitrogen oxi@@ des , which em@@ it@@ ate diesel engines , are considered car@@ cin@@ ogens and can cause as@@ thma . &quot;
&quot; the costs for autom@@ akers , equipment for neutr@@ alising the exhaust gases ej@@ ected from diesel vehicles also take on what makes it difficult to keep the price of cars competitive . &quot;
German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also indic@@ ted to susp@@ end the powerful auto companies and ignore signs of the problem .
&quot; the companies try to avoid the errors of Volkswagen which could regulate the use of so @-@ called de@@ preci@@ ation devices that could regulate emissions in order to comply with the regulations when a car was tested , but in normal driving conditions . &quot;
&quot; in the United States , several employees were accused of Volkswagen , others were examined on both sides of the Atlantic . &quot;
&quot; last month , the former head of ther@@ mod@@ ynam@@ ics was arrested in the engine development of Audi in Germany . &quot;
&quot; the former manager , Z@@ ac@@ che@@ o Giovanni P@@ am@@ io , is Italian and is therefore not protected from delivery and could be put in court in the United States . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of this year , Audi was involved in German criminal investigations in Volkswagen , after the authorities accused of having installed a system to b@@ ypass the emissions regulations in Europe , and a request that focused on the United States was expanded . &quot;
the inclusion of Audi in the investigation could heavily burden Volkswagen : the luxury car manufacturer has a disp@@ rop@@ or@@ tion@@ ately proportional to the win of Volkswagen .

Mor@@ dil@@ los Kn@@ ur@@ n@@ oses and laughter against the suffering
&quot; Mor@@ di@@ ll@@ o was one of the most published carto@@ ons illustr@@ ators , the l@@ oll@@ ens of his characters are his trademark . &quot;
&quot; also with 85 , the Argent@@ ine@@ er still records and works on a film . &quot;
&quot; his message : laugh , because there is too much suffering in the world . &quot;
&quot; Guill@@ ermo Mor@@ di@@ ll@@ o was born on 4 August 1932 , as the son of Spanish immigrants in Buenos Aires . &quot;
&quot; in the first years as an artist , he found himself as an illustr@@ ator for congrat@@ ulating cards - which frustr@@ ated him . &quot;
&quot; the happ@@ i@@ est day in my professional life was the day when I lost my job , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; after stops in Lima , New York and Paris , he was able to make a breakthrough at the end of the &apos; 60s : with the publication of his carto@@ ons in &quot; Paris Match &quot; and then also in the &quot; Stern &quot; and other leading magazines around the world . &quot;
even in China Mor@@ di@@ ll@@ o found many fans .
again and again the artists of cities were inspired .
&quot; large , ro@@ un@@ dish Mor@@ di@@ ll@@ o figures cav@@ ort in drawings with the Le@@ aning Tower of Pisa , Big Ben in London and the Red Square in Moscow . &quot;
&quot; in the early morning , according to his own information , he still sits at the drawing table , works almost ten hours a day . &quot;
&quot; on calendar , puzzles , books for Gross and Klein , T @-@ Shirts , Pl@@ ush favor@@ ites and watches , his dro@@ ll figures still find much spread worldwide . &quot;
&quot; for six years , he has worked on a cartoon film and a TV series with his figures . &quot;
&quot; the main person in the movie &quot; Cra@@ zy Island , &quot; is a gi@@ ra@@ ffe - Mor@@ dil@@ los popular animal in his drawings - who has a thous@@ and@@ ler as a counter player . &quot;
&quot; for the first time , his figures in the 3D film , which should come to the cinema in 2019 , speak for the first time . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t know exactly what they will say , it &apos;s strange for me , &quot; says Mor@@ di@@ ll@@ o . &quot;
the script is not written by him .
&quot; therefore , he rather relies on the TV series , which , as his original drawings , is produced literally . &quot;
la@@ ven@@ der threatened from climate change
&quot; it has become a symbol of Provence in the South of France , but there is a warning that it is threatened with climate change . &quot;
&quot; the la@@ ven@@ der is dec@@ lining because of the conditions that are reminis@@ cent of d@@ rought , and because of the diseases over@@ bearing insects are dec@@ lining what scientists and farmers who try to find solutions , large head@@ aches . &quot;
&quot; Eric Cha@@ isse , expert of the agr@@ arian research institute CRI@@ EP@@ P@@ AM in Provence , said : &quot; the la@@ ven@@ der in Provence is effectively endangered because the plant in recent years has been exposed to the effects of climate change , which has brought much less rain in spring and much more in autumn . &quot;
this has effects on the life of la@@ ven@@ der .
&quot; there is also a small to@@ ic@@ ade , a micro@@ bacter@@ ium that transfers d@@ warf @-@ c@@ ades , and in very dry weather there are many of them . &quot;
and there is a lot in the game .
&quot; la@@ ven@@ der oil attracts not only for tourists , it is also very popular for perf@@ umes and cosmetics . &quot;
&quot; Eric Cha@@ isse said : &quot; instead of having very long plants with a large number of flowers , we have smaller , under@@ developed and either missing or weak@@ ened . &quot;
so we have less parts with essential oil . &quot;
&quot; the solutions that are considered include a better water distribution and the slow@@ down of ev@@ ap@@ oration from the ground , but also spra@@ ying the plants with a protective mix of clay and water and the development of varieties that are more resistant to dr@@ y@@ ness . &quot;

the assass@@ ination of a journalist under@@ lines the growing threat in Mexico
&quot; the employees of the Week@@ ly Ri@@ odo@@ ce usually meet Wedn@@ es@@ days to check their plans for reporting on the recent chaos in the state of Sin@@ alo@@ a by organised crime , corrupt officials and un@@ ce@@ asing drug wars . &quot;
&quot; but on that day , in the shadow of their own tragedy , they came together to talk about security . &quot;
they told them that it is important to change their routines .
&quot; two high @-@ level journalists discuss what is more secure : they should take their children into the office , which were the goal of an attack with gr@@ en@@ ades in 2009 , or leave them home . &quot;
&quot; security experts have written three words on a tablet at the front of the room : opponents , neutral , allies . &quot;
&quot; they ask the rep@@ or@@ ters to propose names for each column - no proof is necessary , percep@@ tions and abdominal feelings are enough . &quot;
&quot; there are drug smu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers , politicians , business@@ men , journalists , who are suspected to stand on the pay@@ roll list of the government or the cart@@ els , a catalogue of crimin@@ als that make the chaos of Mexico dangerous . &quot;
&quot; there is no rest from violence , and throughout the country the cor@@ p@@ ses are frequent , more and more journalists are involved : at least 25 , since President En@@ ri@@ que P@@ ena N@@ ie@@ to joined his office in December 2012 . &quot;
&quot; among the latter is her publisher and her inspir@@ ator of Ri@@ odo@@ sius , co @-@ founder of J@@ avier Val@@ dez Car@@ den@@ as . &quot;
&quot; the biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and be a journalist , &quot; &quot; wrote Val@@ dez in one of his numerous books on violence in connection with drugs . &quot;
&quot; his absence becomes deeply felt , although his presence is present everywhere - a large photo of Val@@ dez , which shows his middle finger with the word &quot; Justice , &quot; hangs on the facade of the Ri@@ char@@ ce building . two rep@@ or@@ ters in the thir@@ ties , Aaron I@@ bar@@ ra and Miriam Ram@@ i@@ rez , carry t @-@ shirts that show his smiling face with glasses or his typical pan@@ am@@ ah@@ ut . &quot;
&quot; the workshop takes place less than two months after his death , and the rep@@ or@@ ters discuss their shared issues , trau@@ ma , night@@ mares , sle@@ e@@ pl@@ ess@@ ness , par@@ ano@@ ia . &quot;
&quot; although a Son@@ der At@@ tor@@ ney General was established in 2010 to process the cases of journalists , it has conducted only two criminal proceedings , according to the Committee for the Protection of Journ@@ alists . &quot;
&quot; as with most thousands of mur@@ ders committed every year with drug traff@@ icking and organised crime , the mur@@ der@@ ers of journalists are rarely brought to justice . &quot;
&quot; at Ri@@ odo@@ sius they still ins@@ ist on treating the violence of Sin@@ alo@@ a , although they are un@@ tr@@ insi@@ cally and although the terrain is now more tre@@ ach@@ er@@ ous . &quot;
&quot; without information about the mur@@ der@@ ers , without justice , the meeting to discuss security has little benefit , says I@@ bar@@ ra . &quot;
&quot; it is very stupid to waste my time in this workshop , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; as long as we don &apos;t know the why , we mi@@ str@@ ust all . &quot;
&quot; on the morning of May 15 , Val@@ dez left the office of the newspaper Ri@@ odo@@ sius in the capital of Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an . &quot;
&quot; he only managed to go a few blocks far before his red Toyota Cor@@ olla was stopped by two men . he was forced out of his car and 12 times was shot on him , probably because of the name of the newspaper - which is translated with &quot; &quot; twelve river &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the sho@@ oter drove away in his car and damaged it nearby .
Val@@ dez was 50 years old .
he left a woman and two adult children .
rum@@ ors tend to fly around in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
but to the topic Val@@ dez there is practically nothing but silence .
&quot; since Gu@@ z@@ man &apos;s arrest last year and extra@@ dition to the United States in January , Sin@@ alo@@ a has become one of the bloo@@ dies@@ t batt@@ le@@ fields in the country , as ri@@ val fac@@ tions are fighting here to fill the vacuum . &quot;
&quot; it doesn &apos;t matter that in Sin@@ alo@@ a every day one or more people are shot on the road or that the gra@@ vey@@ ard is full of decorated , two @-@ storey Maus@@ ole@@ ums for drug kings that are larger than many homes for the living . &quot;
forget for a minute that there is a state of &quot; peace &quot; if only a cart@@ el has control over the coastal state with its valuable ports and drug trade routes in the United States .
&quot; despite the fact that Val@@ dez had been aware of the dangers of his work , Is@@ mail Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez ( 60 ) , co @-@ founder and director of Ri@@ odo@@ sius , broke away with the guilt that he could not protect his friend . &quot;
he believes that two mis@@ concep@@ tions have contributed to the murder .
&quot; first , in February , the publication of an interview with Dam@@ asc@@ ene Lop@@ ez , a leader of one of the ri@@ val cart@@ el fra@@ ctions in the war with Gu@@ z@@ mans &apos;s sons . &quot;
&quot; this publication may have anno@@ yed the sons , presum@@ ed ais@@ le members bought each copy of the issue as soon as it was delivered to newspaper ki@@ os@@ ks . &quot;
&quot; the second mistake was not to force Val@@ dez , after the sei@@ z@@ ure of another newspaper that had published the same story to leave the country for its own security . &quot;
&quot; Val@@ dez was a legend in Mexico and abroad , and his killing is regarded as a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists . &quot;
he had survived so long that his friends and colleagues forgot that he would always be there .
&quot; he was active in 2003 as an experienced rep@@ orter for Nor@@ o@@ este , when he joined together with five colleagues for the establishment of Ri@@ odo@@ ce and sold 50 US dollars . &quot;
&quot; in Sin@@ alo@@ a , it was impossible to pursue journ@@ alism without viol@@ ating the drug problem , &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez . &quot;
&quot; with time , the paper earned a reputation for cour@@ age@@ ous and honest reporting , and sales and advertising revenue . &quot;
&quot; rep@@ or@@ ters loved to be able to publish harsh investigations without fear of cens@@ or@@ ship , and readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that no one else dar@@ ed to handle . &quot;
&quot; eight years after the establishment of Ri@@ odo@@ sius , she received the prestigious &quot; Maria Mo@@ ors @-@ Cab@@ ot Prize &quot; for her coverage in Latin America . &quot;
&quot; in the same year , Val@@ dez won the &apos; International Press Freedom Award &apos; of the Committee for the Protection of Journ@@ alists for his courage in pursuing Mexican drug history wherever it was . &quot;
he volunte@@ ered to be afraid .
&quot; I want to continue living , &quot; he said at the time of the CP@@ J award . &quot;
&quot; drug traff@@ icking in Sin@@ alo@@ a is a way of life , &quot; &quot; he said last October in an interview with Rom@@ pe@@ vi@@ ento TV . &quot;
you have to take over the task that you as a journalist - either that or you play the dum@@ b .
&quot; I don &apos;t want to be asked : &quot; &quot; what have you done in the light of so many dead ... why did you not say what was going on ? &quot;
&quot; the Ri@@ char@@ ce team mis@@ ses Val@@ dez , the Sp@@ a@@ ß@@ vogel , who was able to cur@@ b like a do@@ ck@@ man , the friend who was gener@@ ously with hu@@ gs and advice , a teacher who knew how to survive . &quot;
they trusted in his routine .
he would always carry his hat .
&quot; he would always go to El Guay@@ ab@@ o , the bar opposite the office , and always sit at the same table . &quot;
&quot; now they ask , Is his love for routine his spo@@ il@@ age ? &quot;
&quot; his death , too , forced her to question her own assumptions about how to best do her work and stay alive . &quot;
&quot; they don &apos;t like it when you deal with their wives , their children , their clean shops , their secret home and landing ways to move drugs . &quot;
&quot; these things were not allowed , &quot; &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez . &quot;
&quot; the result is , even in the best times , a high level of self @-@ cens@@ or@@ ship and self @-@ preservation . &quot;
trust his own inst@@ inc@@ ts .
&quot; if it sm@@ ells wrong , stay away from it . &quot;
&quot; the anger is , the editor of the Ri@@ char@@ ce Andr@@ es Vill@@ ar@@ real said that &quot; &quot; smell is a sense that can be dec@@ eived ... and then the matter is happening with J@@ avier . &quot;
&quot; the old rules , as he and others say , are no longer valid in Sin@@ alo@@ a - just as in Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as , Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z , Gu@@ err@@ ero and other states in which a poison@@ ous mixture of lu@@ cr@@ ative smu@@ g@@ gling routes , weak institutions and corrupt government officials are at home . &quot;
the landscape is constantly changing .
&quot; in the space where the employees of Ri@@ odo@@ sius met security training , no cell phones were allowed . days before , it was known that Spy@@ ware , which is exclusively sold to governments , was used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico . &quot;
&quot; outside , two polic@@ emen sought protection from the heat of 104 degrees ( 40 ° C ) in the shade of a tree . &quot;
they were commissioned by the provincial government to protect the offices of Ri@@ odo@@ ce in a four @-@ storey building in a mid @-@ size neighborhood of Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
&quot; half in the joke , some of the rep@@ or@@ ters asked whether these officers were among the 50 percent of the polic@@ emen , which the governor described himself as un@@ trust@@ worthy . &quot;
&quot; it is months since the rep@@ or@@ ters have gone into the mountain landscape , where the drug gangs are de facto under control . &quot;
&quot; for the issue of this week , Ri@@ odo@@ sius gave birth to three main stories . &quot;
there was the assass@@ ination of the brother of the former famous Box@@ ers Ju@@ lio Ces@@ ar Cha@@ vez in Sin@@ alo@@ a .
&quot; they also had an exposure to the government spending , which concentrated on the home town of the governor . &quot;
&quot; and there was a group located in one of the most expensive restaurants in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an , a block away from the Office of the Prosec@@ utor , a kid@@ n@@ apping . &quot;
&quot; there was no official word about who was kid@@ n@@ apped or as it happened , so caution was advised when it was time to write what everyone in the city knows : that the restaurant is a favourite local of drug dealers and authorities . &quot;
&quot; a rep@@ orter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politi@@ cian , who ruled the governing Institu@@ tional Revolution Party ( PR@@ I ) , which dominated all the political levels almost the entire century . &quot;
&quot; recently , several PR@@ I govern@@ ors have been accused of high @-@ cali@@ bre cases of corruption . &quot;
&quot; Vill@@ ar@@ real asked the rep@@ orter to write about previous incidents in this loc@@ ale , including one in which a son of &quot; El Ch@@ apo &quot; Gu@@ z@@ man escaped a military attack . &quot;
&quot; only a few months earlier , readers would have seen the column of Val@@ dez as the best informed source of kid@@ n@@ apping . &quot;
&quot; we had already known what happened , &quot; Vill@@ ar@@ real said 46 , with the nick@@ name &quot; El Fl@@ aco &quot; because of his slender body stat@@ ure . &quot;
&quot; now all channels of communication are broken with our sources . &quot;
&quot; the office of Val@@ dez has been transformed into a storage space for signs and sti@@ ckers , which prot@@ esting against the mur@@ ders of journalists , because the employees have become something they never expected : activists in the name of the press . &quot;
rep@@ orter Miriam Ram@@ i@@ rez grab@@ bed a few signs and went to a demonstration on the next morning for a demonstration on the office of the prosec@@ utor &apos;s office .
&quot; Salvador Ad@@ ame disappeared three days after Val@@ dez had been killed , in the Western state of Mi@@ cho@@ ac@@ an . &quot;
&quot; a burned body has been discovered and officials say , based on DNA testing that it is its . &quot;
&quot; throughout the country , journalists have become lou@@ vers by writing in organized protests &quot; SOS Press &quot; on walk@@ ways and buildings . &quot;
&quot; on this day , the director Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez is gone in Washington and tries to gather international support for the judi@@ ci@@ ary in the Val@@ dez case . &quot;
&quot; at a meeting with the Gover@@ nor of Sin@@ alo@@ a on the day after the assass@@ ination of Val@@ dez , Ram@@ i@@ rez accused the authorities to spy on journalists and bring them around because they told the truth . &quot;
&quot; she has since been asked to re @-@ divide her from the government , because she is concerned that her anger has hurt her objec@@ tivity . &quot;
&quot; Val@@ dez had repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico were surrounded by organised crime , government officials and a social society . &quot;
&quot; in his last book &quot; &quot; Nar@@ co @-@ Journ@@ alism &quot; , &quot; he wrote that rep@@ or@@ ters were not only killed by drug gangs , but also by command of politicians and security forces committed by organised crime under a blan@@ ket . &quot;
&quot; last year , the media group &quot; Artic@@ ulo 19 &quot; has been assigned more than half of the attacks on journalists of the police and officials . &quot;
&quot; in Mexico you die because they want you to keep your mouth , &quot; &quot; said Ram@@ i@@ rez . &quot;
obviously the kill@@ ers have a det@@ err@@ ent effect .
nobody for@@ gets the death of the blo@@ gger Maria Elizabeth Mac@@ ias in the northern border state Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as six years ago .
&quot; her body was found along with a note that was suppos@@ edly signed by Z@@ et@@ as @-@ Kart@@ ell , &quot; Here I am because of my reports . &quot;
a computer keyboard and head@@ phones were placed next to their separate head .
some branches have chosen to close as the newspaper El Nor@@ te in the northern border state of Chi@@ hu@@ ah@@ ua after the assass@@ ination of correspon@@ dent Mi@@ ros@@ lava Bre@@ ach in March .
others continue to do as El Man@@ ana of Nu@@ evo Lar@@ edo did after the assass@@ ination of her director in 2004 .
&quot; in 2010 , the Di@@ ario de Ci@@ u@@ dad Ju@@ are@@ z publicly set itself on the drug cart@@ elle with a editorial on the front page with the title &quot; What do you want from us ? &quot;
some journalists have fled from their home countries or even from the country .
it is a painful decision .
&quot; it is hard to find work in exile , and they still watch the streets and search for dangers . &quot;
&quot; and sometimes they are hun@@ ted , as evi@@ dently the photographer Ru@@ ben Esp@@ in@@ osa , who was murdered in 2015 together with four women in an apartment in Mexico City three months after the escape from Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z . &quot;
&quot; for those who remain behind and continue the work , it is a daily dance with ris@@ ky decisions . &quot;
&quot; I@@ bar@@ ra , who once wanted to be a poet , indicates that drug traff@@ icking is troubled . &quot;
&quot; Mexico goes to hell , and therefore I became rep@@ orter , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; at midnight on last Friday , when the last issue was already finished , the editors of Ri@@ odo@@ ce sat on the side@@ walk in front of the office and d@@ rank be@@ ers when all their phones began sum@@ ming . &quot;
a series of sho@@ ot@@ ings with ri@@ val ri@@ vals and security forces near the seaside resort Maz@@ at@@ lan had left 19 confirmed dead .
the war continues to escal@@ ate as promised by a series of Kart@@ ell messages in the region .
&quot; from the edge of the board , they released the news on the website of Ri@@ odo@@ sia about mobile phones . &quot;
the front page had to be changed the next day .
si@@ r@@ ens are waiting nearby - another shooting in the area .
Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez threw a look at the polic@@ emen who kept watch to see if they were in readiness .
&quot; if they were afraid , they did not show it . &quot;
&quot; under the massive portrait of the fallen founder of the newspaper , whose middle finger was visible for quite Sin@@ alo@@ a , the staff of Ri@@ odo@@ sius followed his traces . &quot;
&quot; how can you only think about it , &quot; &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez , &quot; &quot; if on the same day , on which J@@ avier was murdered , the intern asked me to send her to the reporting on the street . &quot;
din@@ osau@@ r used cam@@ ouflage to avoid its enemies
&quot; at first glance , it looks like a statue , though a fri@@ ghtening . &quot;
now researchers found that the first findings of the unbelievable rhin@@ oc@@ eros of a Canadian min@@ er were so well received that experts described it as &quot; Mon@@ a Lisa der Din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot;
&quot; it was so good that they could even find that his sc@@ aly skin was of red@@ dish brown - and they said that she had something of a &quot; &quot; rest@@ less past . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the report in the journal &quot; Current Biology &quot; described him as &quot; the star@@ ved din@@ osau@@ rs , who was ever found , and one of the best din@@ osau@@ rs specimens in the world . &quot;
&quot; the fossil is a newly discovered species of No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier , which lived in the middle of the circle @-@ time between 110 million and 112 million years ago . &quot;
&quot; its incredibly well @-@ preserved state has aston@@ ished researchers , which describe it as &quot; really remarkable . &quot; &quot;
&quot; according to reports in National Ge@@ ographic , the ar@@ mor@@ ed her@@ bi@@ vor@@ es is the best preserved fossil of its kind . &quot;
&quot; it was found by Sha@@ wn Funk , when he arrived in the Sun@@ cor Mill@@ enium mine near Fort Mc@@ Murray in the north of Alberta , Canada , gru@@ b . &quot;
&quot; he met something out of the surrounding rock , and decided to look more closely . &quot;
the fossil discovered by him was sent to the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rell Museum of Pal@@ e@@ ont@@ ology .
&quot; they spent the next six years to un@@ cover the wild beast within the 2,500 pounds ( 1,@@ 100 kg ) of heavy ground . &quot;
&quot; after all this hard work , the finished result is now ready to be revealed . &quot;
&quot; if you just blin@@ king a little with your eyes , you could almost believe that it slept , &quot; said the main author Cal@@ eb Brown , scientist at the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rell Museum where the creature is to be seen . &quot;
&quot; it will enter the history of science as one of the most beautiful and best preserved din@@ osau@@ rs specimens - Mon@@ a Lisa , the din@@ osau@@ r . &quot;
&quot; researchers found out that this her@@ bi@@ vor@@ es , although it is covered with an arm@@ or and resem@@ bles a shifting tank , probably threatened by meat @-@ eating din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot;
&quot; the heavily arm@@ oured Din@@ osau@@ r used a red and white cam@@ ouflage to hide from pre@@ dat@@ ors , and used an shiel@@ ding technique known as counter@@ fei@@ ting , which is also used by many modern animals . &quot;
&quot; this would have allowed it to get better in its surroundings and to avoid its enemies , experts say what it suggests that it was threatened by larger din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot;
the 110 million years old creature from the No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier family has been head@@ lines for the first time in May and can now be seen in the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rell Museum of Pal@@ ae@@ ont@@ ology .
&quot; researchers have now studied the wild animal and called it Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta mark@@ mit@@ ch@@ elli after the museum engineer Mark Mit@@ ch@@ ell , one of a team that has spent more than 7@@ .000 hours to cover it carefully . &quot;
&quot; the astonishing preservation of the specimen made it possible to document Dr. Mit@@ ch@@ ell and an international team of scientists , the pattern and the form of scales and arm@@ or over his body . &quot;
&quot; they discovered the shad@@ owing , a widespread defense method in the animal kingdom , which means that the top of the creature was dar@@ ker than its under@@ side . &quot;
&quot; although the shad@@ owing is common , the results are surprising as the size of Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta by far exceeds the animals living today . &quot;
&quot; it suggests that the din@@ osau@@ rs was hun@@ ted by meat @-@ eating din@@ osau@@ rs , that evolution fav@@ ored the conce@@ al@@ ment of confrontation as a means of survival . &quot;
&quot; but most contemporary animals that use the shad@@ ow@@ age - think of roe deer , zeb@@ ras or belt @-@ animals - are much smaller and vulnerable than loo@@ t , which signals that this No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier was exposed to a real struggle for survival . &quot;
&quot; powerful pre@@ dat@@ ory behavior on a massive , strongly arm@@ oured din@@ osau@@ r show how dangerous the din@@ osau@@ rs pre@@ dat@@ ors have to have been the Cre@@ tac@@ eous period , &quot; &quot; said Brown . &quot;
the chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the skin of the din@@ osau@@ r was bay .
scientists continue to investigate the animal on clu@@ es about his life including his con@@ served Dar@@ min@@ ate to find out what it has eaten as his last meal .
&quot; they believe that the din@@ osau@@ r , when he died , fell into a river and drove out into the sea , where he sank on the back to the sea floor . &quot;
&quot; at this time Alberta was as warm as South @-@ fl@@ ori@@ da today , and rivers and oceans probably much far@@ ther than they are today . &quot;
&quot; this No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier is really remarkable because it is completely covered with con@@ served sc@@ aly skin , but also preserved in three dimensions and maintains the original shape of the animal , &quot; &quot; said Brown . &quot;
the result is that the animal looks almost exactly the same today as in the early chal@@ k time .
&quot; you do not need to use a lot of imagination to re@@ construct it . if you play only a little with the eyes , you could almost believe that he is at sleep . &quot;
&quot; the time was a time when huge ther@@ op@@ o@@ ds , car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ r , who were standing on two legs , crossed the earth . &quot;
&quot; although the king of them , the Ty@@ ran@@ n@@ osau@@ rus Rex , lived millions of years after Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta , the ar@@ mor@@ ed din@@ osau@@ r was hun@@ ted by some of his fear@@ ful ancestors . &quot;
&quot; this includes the Ac@@ ro@@ can@@ th@@ osau@@ rus , a 38 feet ( 11.5 m ) long , six tons of heavy monsters . &quot;
&quot; the scientists , whose latest findings appear in the journal Current Biology , believe that Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta was drow@@ ned at sea after death and m@@ um@@ i@@ fied in mud . &quot;
&quot; the creature was found by Sha@@ wn Funk , when he was buried on 21 March 2011 at the Sun@@ cor Mill@@ enium mine near Fort Mc@@ Murray in the north of Alberta , Canada . &quot;
&quot; according to the museum , it is the uphol@@ stered din@@ osau@@ r of the world , including skin and arm@@ or , and is completely from the mu@@ zzle to the hip . &quot;
&quot; the creatures were about 18 feet ( 5 meters ) long and weigh@@ ed up to 3,000 pounds ( 1,@@ 300 kg ) . &quot;
it contained two 20 @-@ inch long tips that ra@@ ged from his shoulders .
the researchers believe that the ar@@ mor@@ ed her@@ bi@@ vor@@ es were sw@@ elled by Western Canada until a floo@@ ded river floo@@ ded it into the open sea .
but the water rep@@ ay@@ ment of the din@@ osau@@ r kept his arm@@ our in exquisite detail .
the pet@@ ri@@ fied remains of this special specimen are preserved so well that the house ste still covers repeat@@ able arm@@ oured plates along the din@@ osau@@ r
&quot; as Michael G@@ res@@ h@@ ko has written for National Ge@@ ographic , such a level of conservation is as &apos; rare as a winning lot@@ tery . &quot;
&quot; the more I approach it , the more conf@@ using it becomes . &quot;
&quot; pet@@ ri@@ fied remains of the skin still cover the b@@ ump@@ y ar@@ mor@@ ed plates , which carry the skull of the animal . &quot;
&quot; his right foref@@ oot is on his side , his five fingers are split upwards . &quot;
I can count the scales on its sole .
in the thunder@@ storm : mass car@@ am@@ bol@@ age on A@@ 8 : many injured
serious accident on Thursday evening on the A@@ 8 : nearly 30 vehicles are involved in a mass car@@ am@@ bol@@ age .
&quot; there are numerous injured , kilometres long St@@ aus - and G@@ aff@@ er . &quot;
&quot; on the Stuttgart @-@ Munich motorway ( A@@ 8 ) , about 20 people were injured in a mass car@@ am@@ bol@@ age on Thursday afternoon . &quot;
&quot; after the first indications of the police were between the connecting points Adel@@ z@@ hausen and O@@ del@@ z@@ hausen ( district A@@ ich@@ ach @-@ Fried@@ berg ) during a thunder@@ storm , almost 30 vehicles , among them probably also trucks , inter@@ connected . &quot;
&quot; at first , there are no indications of the exact number of the injured . &quot;
&quot; it was a slight to moderate injury , said a police spokes@@ man . &quot;
a large number of rescue vehicles was at the accident site .
the A@@ 8 was completely blocked in the direction of Munich .
&quot; in Munich &apos;s direction of direction Munich , an approximately ten kilometer long back@@ ward was formed . &quot;
&quot; as a AZ rep@@ orter reports , there was also on the counter @-@ road@@ way to massive disabilities - through numerous G@@ aff@@ er . &quot;
&quot; the fire bri@@ g@@ ade not@@ ices the hall@@ marks of the Vehicle Spar@@ ker , who now have to reck@@ on with delicate pun@@ ish@@ ments . &quot;
&quot; shortly after 18 : 45 o &apos;clock a second accident occurred on the A@@ 8 , this time between Augsburg and D@@ asing . &quot;
there was a col@@ lision between a car transpor@@ ter and a passenger car .
a helicop@@ ter was on the road to the accident .
Deutsche Bahn : group tests &quot; Comfort Check @-@ in &quot;
it is a moment that almost everyone has experienced : nothing can be found in the train and sleep .
or one is deep@@ ened into his work and has just a brilliant thought .
and then : buff@@ ering .
comes the conductor and w@@ akes up an uns@@ an@@ ft or irrit@@ ates the passenger in the middle of the workflow .
check @-@ in / check @-@ out .
but the times of inter@@ rup@@ tions are over soon .
the Deutsche Bahn is currently testing the free ticket inspec@@ tions .
you just confirm by phone that you take your seat and de@@ valu@@ ate the ticket .
&quot; currently , a test runs on two routes . &quot;
&quot; when the offer goes , we expand it . &quot;
&quot; it will probably be available in Germany at the beginning of next year , &quot; &quot; said S &amp; D spokes@@ man . &quot;
&quot; comfort check @-@ in &quot; is called by train the ticket de@@ valuation without Schaff@@ ner .
&quot; in order to be able to use them , however , some requirements must be met : you need a smartphone or tablet . &quot;
and you have to book an online ticket - what already most passengers do .
&quot; it is also necessary to have bought it via the train , the DB Navigator , which is the most convenient way of ticket booking . &quot;
and finally you need a seat reservation .
&quot; because the &quot; &quot; comfort check @-@ in &quot; &quot; works so : one climb@@ s into the train , calling his ticket to &quot; My Tickets . &quot; &quot;
a button for electronic de@@ valuation appears at the test customers .
the train atten@@ d@@ ants get a message on their mobile devices that passenger X is on the train and took the booked seat Y .
&quot; when the train atten@@ d@@ ant arrives at room Y , he knows that there is a passenger with already dischar@@ ged online ticket . &quot;
&quot; so you can continue to sleep , continue working , keep silence . &quot;
&quot; check @-@ in has two advantages : one for the customer , one for the train - which in turn should use passengers . &quot;
&quot; who wants to travel relaxed without ticket inspec@@ tions by our train atten@@ d@@ ant , check the DB Navigator for yourself . &quot;
&quot; this allows passengers to make their travel time in the train more personal , &quot; says Michael Peter@@ son , the marketing board of DB Fern@@ verkehr . &quot;
&quot; second plus : &quot; &quot; and our employees have more time than today to respond to individual customer needs . &quot;
&quot; those who often travel , know that in addition to delays and missed trains , the ticket inspec@@ tions belong to the biggest anno@@ y@@ ances . &quot;
&quot; in any case , however , one of the contribut@@ ors does not have all the documents required to de@@ valuation of online tickets . &quot;
either the credit card or the ID card or otherwise a document you have to assign .
&quot; the result is endless discussions between the train atten@@ d@@ ants and passenger , which leads to poor sen@@ timent in the section or large room and delays in controlling your own tickets and the conductor ends at the end time to take care of other matters . &quot;
only a small number of test customers can use the new service .
and this applies only to the connections ICE 9@@ 15 Dortmund @-@ Stuttgart and ICE 912 Stuttgart @-@ Essen .
further train numbers on the same route are not yet un@@ locked .
how an activ@@ ist came to learn the answer to the question : &quot; wh@@ ats Stre@@ ets ? &quot;
&quot; on 9 August 2014 , Br@@ itt@@ any Fer@@ rell was sha@@ ken up to her heart . &quot;
&quot; only one day after having arrived in New York City , the St. Louis dealer sat on the bed of an air@@ b@@ n@@ b apartment , which rented and sc@@ roll by Facebook on their phone . &quot;
she stum@@ bled over a post from someone from the High School .
&quot; the police have just killed a 18 @-@ year @-@ old child , and it is still on the road . &quot;
&quot; confused , as no one else had posted the information on their feed , she closed Facebook and opened Twitter . &quot;
a user with the Handle @ The@@ e@@ Phar@@ o@@ ah was constantly delivered on her tim@@ eline .
&quot; the ra@@ pper from the area of St. Louis was the death of Michael Brown , an un@@ armed black 18 @-@ year @-@ old , who was killed by a white polic@@ eman in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , Mo . , was killed live to twe@@ eten . &quot;
&quot; he posted a picture of Brow@@ ns alive bodies stretched out on the street , and there would stay four hours there . &quot;
&quot; that &apos;s wild , &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ rell . &quot;
but death was nothing new for her and her community .
she turned her cell phone to return to twe@@ ets on the Can@@ field @-@ Drive later in the evening .
&quot; there were photos from the police band and people crying out , and of a man who claimed to be the father &apos;s father , who carried a sign with the inscription : &quot; F@@ erg@@ us@@ on police has just killed my un@@ armed son ! &quot;
&quot; she observed a live feed , where a polic@@ eman stood before a group of demonstr@@ ators with a bar@@ king dog . &quot;
&quot; in another video , she said , a different polic@@ eman said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to kill you ... animals all kill you . &quot;
&quot; this is not usual , &quot; Fer@@ rell remembered her statement . &quot;
this is not the kind of murder that we have acc@@ u@@ stom@@ ed to and which we can call typical .
at that moment I felt ch@@ ills .
I was fur@@ ious and we@@ pt . &quot;
she booked a return flight and went home the next day .
after the landing at 23 o &apos;clock she took off her 6 @-@ year @-@ old daughter from her father &apos;s house and decided that the two would drive to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on the next morning .
&quot; what happened in the following three years with Fer@@ rell and F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , is the theme of a new documentary , &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? , &quot; in cinem@@ as from 11 . &quot;
&quot; it is a history of survival and protest , love and loss , strength and resistance , which consists of the point of view of the people who live in community and have filled the streets to demand answers . &quot;
&quot; as Fer@@ rell with her daughter who carried a flower dress and a matching crown to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , the two were talking about the black experience and the black condition many times before this morning . &quot;
&quot; you remember how I taught you when black people have to fight for what they believe ? &quot; &quot; she remembered what she said . &quot;
&quot; we are now going to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , because the police killed a 18 @-@ year @-@ old boy and that wasn &apos;t right . &quot;
&quot; I could not take them , &quot; &quot; Fer@@ rell said later . &quot;
what is happening today is a highlight of what happened in the past .
it must know and see it and be raised in it .
&quot; it must be well developed not only activ@@ ism and organisation , but also the different layers of black experience and the black constitution and what we must do to free ourselves . &quot;
&quot; even if I have the luck to give her an experience in which she personally does not experience disgu@@ sting rac@@ ism , she is no different from the next black women child . &quot;
&quot; I feel , I would give her a bad service to keep her away from it . &quot;
&quot; the first stop , when they arrived at F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , was located at the South Flor@@ iss@@ ant Road , a place opposite the police authority that became a camp@@ ground when activists were waiting for the possible non @-@ indictment of Officer Dar@@ ren Wilson . &quot;
&quot; there , Fer@@ rell and her daughter joined with a local business owner who made lunch . &quot;
they prepared pockets and helped to pass them on to demonstr@@ ators .
slowly a new type of activ@@ ism began to take shape for Fer@@ rell &apos;s shape .
&quot; my activ@@ ism has changed completely after 9 August , &quot; she said and not@@ ices that she was a student at the University of Mis@@ sour@@ i @-@ St. Louis President of the Min@@ ority Student Nur@@ ses Association and focused on eating justice and health ine@@ qualities in black communities . &quot;
&quot; I had no experience in organizing .
it is all come . &quot;
&quot; weeks later Fer@@ rell met during an evening demonstration , Sab@@ a@@ ah Fol@@ ay@@ an , one of the co @-@ directors of the film . &quot;
&quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an said , she and her cam@@ er@@ aman Lucas Al@@ var@@ ado Far@@ rar just wanted to &quot; document &quot; what happened . &quot;
&quot; a question came from Fer@@ rell in the sense : &quot; &quot; do you want to document or try to find a story you can use ? &quot;
&quot; this skep@@ ticism was no@@ ur@@ ished by countless cases of people , often from wh@@ ites - in a community that benefited from their pain and their resili@@ ence . &quot;
&quot; as Fol@@ ay@@ an recently stated in an interview : &quot; &quot; we heard that people born and raised in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on have not centered their voices and we wanted to do it differently . &quot;
&quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an had already collabor@@ ated with the then co @-@ director Dam@@ on Davis , an artist from the area known for his activ@@ ism around To@@ de@@ stra@@ kt det@@ ain@@ ees . &quot;
&quot; his commitment brought the project closer to Fer@@ rell , along with six other locals followed the team of &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; in the years after Brow@@ ns shooting . &quot;
&quot; this documentary is not someone who speaks for us or talks to us . we talk , &quot; Davis said . &quot;
&quot; that was the main thing for me as these people are represented , for so I will be represented . &quot;
&quot; the goal was not to focus on Ferr@@ al &apos;s experience - to show that the movement &quot; is not a Messiah guide , but a community that comes together , &quot; said Fol@@ ay@@ an - she proved to be the most obvious participant of the film . &quot;
&quot; as a result , documents of &quot; &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets &quot; &quot; show surprising personal aspects of Ferr@@ &apos;s life as she falls in love and marri@@ es her wife . &quot;
&quot; I felt like naked , &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ rell and laugh@@ ed when she saw the finished product for the first time . &quot;
but I understood that there must be some vulner@@ ability in this work and in the human@@ isation of black people .
&quot; in addition , Ferr@@ ell &apos;s history repe@@ ats the role of black gay women in the wider Black @-@ Li@@ ves @-@ Matter movement . &quot;
&quot; two of the three founders of the Movement , which after the killing of the black teen@@ ager Tra@@ y@@ von Martin in 2012 have shaped the film &quot; &quot; Black@@ Rock Matter &quot; &quot; in social media , identify themselves as gay . &quot;
&quot; black , gay women in leadership positions have carried the movement overall , &quot; said Fer@@ rell , &quot; and therefore we constantly fight at different fron@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; black , gay women must bear the main burden of everything . &quot;
&quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an agreed to notice that &quot; &quot; the movement is really maintained by black women and many black women . &quot;
&quot; however , it insi@@ sts that &quot; this is not an affir@@ m@@ ative type of action , &quot; when Fer@@ rell was chosen as the heart of the film due to their identity . &quot;
&quot; she was the person who sh@@ ook this energy , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; it is no coinci@@ dence , even though it was at the forefront of the front , because in a life at these cross@@ ings as a black , gay woman stands as much on the game . &quot;
you can feel your energy through the screen . &quot;
&quot; in the meantime , the telecommunications networks in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on have long since disappeared , but the racial ties between the church and the police continue to exist . &quot;
Fer@@ rell is on par@@ ole for 2 ½ years because of blocking a highway at a demonstration .
she describes the social @-@ political atmosphere of the area she calls her home : &quot; a chaos . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , she l@@ acks a voice and she feels bound to this memory , since she went on the street three years ago in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on . &quot;
it is our duty to fight for our freedom .
it is our duty to win .
we must love and support each other .
we have nothing to lose - except our chains . &quot;
from &quot; dream &quot; to &quot; meg@@ al@@ om@@ ania &quot; : TV readers discuss bit gallery
&quot; the bit gallery moves the people , even though it is not built for a long time . &quot;
but the idea of a shopping centre at the south end of the pedestrian zone has since the first presentation in 2009 split the population into advoc@@ ates and opponents .
the topic hardly leaves one .
&quot; also on our Facebook page &quot; &quot; Volks@@ fre@@ und Bit@@ burg &quot; &quot; the topic is discussed . &quot;
&quot; while the one to the bit gallery say , &quot; &quot; that would be a dream &quot; &quot; ( Anja Becker ) or &quot; &quot; That would be really great &quot; &quot; ( Nicole Schau@@ sten ) , comes from the other side : &quot; &quot; no man &quot; &quot; ( Sig@@ gi B@@ etzen ) or simply : &quot; &quot; meg@@ al@@ om@@ ania &quot; &quot; ( Lars Sch@@ olz ) . &quot;
&quot; while the supporters build that a gallery attracts more customers to the city , from which the rest of the shops will benefit , the opponents fear that the pedestrian zone is bleeding . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the gallery is planned exactly on the property where the farmer &apos;s market hall stands , in which 13 direct market@@ ers offer their products . &quot;
&quot; with the beginning of construction work , it will be an end . &quot;
&quot; the gallery makers want to integrate a market hall into the new building - to the Bed@@ a Square , with possibility to sit outside . &quot;
Simone Zimmer : &quot; we have been shopping for almost every week in the farmer &apos;s market hall for many years .
&quot; mainly our eggs , but also the delicious cakes of the land@@ lady gladly again . &quot;
we also discovered the but@@ cher shop for us .
we would wish that even during and especially after the construction of the gallery there is a chance to maintain this offer .
in other cities there is also .
especially the small market hall in Frankfurt is interesting . &quot;
Gerd D@@ ens@@ ing : &quot; whether directly marketed in a market hall in the gallery depends on the amount of rent .
&quot; however , this might not be low in the new project . &quot;
&quot; Eva K@@ ili@@ c : &quot; &quot; why shopping cart@@ els in Bit@@ burg ? &quot;
&quot; clothing , shoes , dru@@ g@@ stores or supermarkets : I find that su@@ perf@@ lu@@ ous . &quot;
there is already enough in our city .
you see how many shops here stand empty - some for months and years .
&quot; but since there is not even a regular weekly market , it is all the more important that at least the market hall is preserved . &quot;
&quot; after all , the goods offered there are fresh , mostly offered directly by the producer and is also inexpensive . &quot;
&quot; as you can see , store shops in a shopping centre are only rented by larger companies , because the rentals there are often not pay@@ able for a retail@@ er . &quot;
&quot; sorry , there is no translation for this news @-@ article . &quot;
Wolf F@@ andel : &quot; a shopping mall with a market hall does not fit for me .
and the gallery does not fit to Bit@@ burg .
above all : where should the Far@@ mers Market stand during the construction period ?
the old E@@ de@@ ka would be the solution - even if the bit gallery actually comes .
or does the Ges@@ pen@@ st Bit gallery already manage to drive all shops from Bit@@ burg before ?
George Mar@@ quet : &quot; this will simply not work .
&quot; and a shopping center that is empty , nobody needs . &quot;
&quot; in my opinion it would have been better to promote a real farmer &apos;s market , instead of this gallery . &quot;
&quot; but for a farmer &apos;s market hall , thanks to the ins@@ ane many - as I find - sen@@ sel@@ ess construction projects in Bit@@ burg no longer place a place . &quot;
&quot; if the farmer &apos;s market hall is broken , a piece of culture will disappear again . &quot;
a matching simil@@ arity : artist creates portraits with Chelsea Mann@@ ings DNA
&quot; in the middle of the space of the Fri@@ d@@ man Gallery in New York many faces can be seen - white , black and brown , which almost resem@@ ble themselves - those on cables hanging from the ceiling . &quot;
the 30 portraits were created by the artist He@@ ather De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg from che@@ eks and hair@@ cuts that were sent to her by Chelsea M@@ anning .
&quot; M@@ anning sent the excer@@ pts from the prison Fort Le@@ aven@@ worth , where former intelligence analy@@ st alli@@ ed a 35 @-@ year prison sentence after it publicly proclaimed diplomatic messages about the Wiki@@ Le@@ aks website . &quot;
&quot; the new exhibition , which was opened on August 2 , is called A Bec@@ oming res@@ emb@@ lance ( A suitable res@@ emb@@ lance ) . &quot;
&quot; she is the product of two years of correspondence between De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose discipline united her expertise in technology , computer science and art , and M@@ anning , a trans@@ exual and pioneering discourse , whose condem@@ nation was transformed by Barack Obama , when he had only three days in his office . &quot;
&quot; de@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg has been created by algorith@@ mic analysis of DNA , which was extracted from M@@ anning and created out of the 30 portraits , as someone with these gen@@ om@@ ic data could look , a sharp as well as something intellectual comment not only to the form@@ ability of DNA data - the many ways in which they can be interpreted and the inherent determin@@ ism of these interpre@@ tations - but also for identity . &quot;
&quot; M@@ anning , who was born as Brad@@ ley Edward , but has already been openly discussed since her pu@@ ber@@ ty about identification as a woman , was condemned in 2013 for 20 charges , including six violations of the es@@ pion@@ age law , computer fraud and theft . &quot;
&quot; her picture was supp@@ ressed by the prison , so much that there was only one picture - a gra@@ iny black @-@ white sel@@ f@@ ie in which M@@ anning is visi@@ bly uncomfortable at a driver &apos;s seat and carries a plat@@ in@@ blonde wig - associated with her . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 , De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg came from the big success of her 2012 project &apos; Stran@@ ger Vis@@ ions &apos; . &quot;
&quot; in this , the artist produced portraits of foreign art@@ ef@@ acts like cigar@@ ette dum@@ b and ch@@ ew@@ ing gum by extra@@ cting the DNA from the waste to produce an image of how these people might look like . &quot;
that was the time when she received an e @-@ mail from a newspaper magazine .
&quot; they conducted an interview with Chelsea M@@ anning while she was in prison , and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article , &quot; &quot; declared De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg at a press preview of the new exhibition . &quot;
&quot; and she could not be photograph@@ ed at that time and she could not be photograph@@ ed , so you took contact with Chelsea and asked her if she wanted to make a DNA portrait . &quot;
the artist and her imprisoned m@@ use became un@@ even bri@@ ph@@ ews which exchanged several letters over the course of two years .
&quot; they even created a comic illustrated by Sho@@ ili Kan@@ ung@@ o , who fores@@ aw a future in which the President would transform Chel@@ ny judgment and would be able to see the exhibition personally . &quot;
&quot; that Obama indeed was only a few days after the book was published , Mann@@ ings released release after seven brutal years in a military prison in K@@ ans@@ as , was a welcome way of happy coinci@@ dence . &quot;
&quot; there is also something deep and strong at the opening of the exhibition , as Donald Tr@@ ump introduces a war against in@@ forman@@ ts from the government camp and against trans@@ gender forces to find new , twe@@ et@@ able ways to solve the rigid spl@@ its that it should actually fix . &quot;
&quot; when De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg was asked for the strange timing of all these things , she said that things happen for a particular reason . &quot;
&quot; in a artistic statement written on the wall of the gallery , M@@ anning asked with its over@@ sized signature ( the &quot; &quot; i &quot; &quot; in their sur@@ name is provided with a heart ) an end to &quot; automatic frag@@ mentation , based on gender , race , sexu@@ ality and culture . &quot;
&quot; on the opposite wall , their mit@@ och@@ on@@ dri@@ al DNA sequence - a thous@@ and@@ ler of Cs and Gs and As , is written in pencil . &quot;
&quot; De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg hoped to show through the inclusion of 200 letters ( or nucle@@ oti@@ des according to the highly developed scientific ency@@ clo@@ pedia of the artist ) , as surprisingly similar , at least in biological ways , we are all . &quot;
&quot; what people will hopefully bring along , is that our gen@@ ome doesn &apos;t care about who we are and how openly genetic data is for an interpretation and how subjective it is , &quot; &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose video works of 2007 , Sp@@ icy Mem@@ ories , also to be seen . &quot;
&quot; DNA data can tell so many different stories , so the 30 of these stories are . &quot;
&quot; the last piece in the exhibition , stored in a separate room , is a page from the above mentioned comic novel . &quot;
she shows M@@ anning as she appears with an open spre@@ e in her hand from the discipl@@ in@@ arian bar@@ racks of the United States like King Kong .
&quot; if they put your speech , then they have won , &quot; says it . &quot;
&quot; so , never stop the mouth . &quot;
&quot; it came directly from a letter that she wrote to me , &quot; &quot; said the artist , who greetings from Philadelphia . &quot;
I still get go@@ ose when I talk about it .
&quot; M@@ anning has not seen the exhibition personally - just as it was anticipated in the comic book - but if it was supposed to do it , it will be greeted in the middle of the room by the masks , from their own gen@@ om@@ ic simul@@ ac@@ els that coinci@@ de like hor@@ des of prot@@ esters . &quot;
&quot; it was also targeted , like everything in the exhibition , up to the size ( 5 &quot; 2 , &quot; man &apos;s stat@@ ure ) , in which their genetic Hap@@ lo@@ y groups were written with pencil . &quot;
&quot; in the past I had them on the wall , but I wanted them to feel like a crowd , &quot; &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg . &quot;
&quot; I wanted it to feel like a mass movement that formed with Chelsea , like the movement which was hiding behind its liberation . &quot;
Professor of the University of North@@ western and an employee of Oxford University sought for killing
a nationwide hunting trip is underway for a professor at North@@ western University and an employee of Oxford University who were looking for susp@@ ects after a man in a luxurious apartment in Chicago was struck by deadly injuries .
&quot; on Monday , for W@@ yn@@ d@@ ham La@@ them ( 42 ) and Andrew War@@ ren ( 56 ) arrest warran@@ ts were issued for murder on account of the alleged involvement in the death of Tr@@ ent@@ on H. James Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au , as shown by the Cook County Court . &quot;
&quot; the documents say that Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au , 26 , died after several stit@@ ches . &quot;
a community warning system published by the Chicago Police Department announced that the cor@@ p@@ se was discovered on July 27 .
&quot; officials received a call , arrived at the Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victim with several injuries to his body . &quot;
&quot; Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au was declared dead at the place of events , and det@@ ectives investigating the engra@@ vings as murder , while the police actively sought the two susp@@ ects , said officials . &quot;
she has been an associate professor of micro@@ biology and immun@@ ology at North@@ western University since 2007 .
&quot; Alan K. Cub@@ bage , the Vice President for University Relations , said in an e @-@ mail statement that La@@ them had now been assessed and excluded from entering the North@@ western University campus . &quot;
&quot; this is now a criminal matter examined by the competent authorities , and North@@ western University co@@ operates with this investigation , &quot; &quot; Cub@@ bage said . &quot;
War@@ ren is Senior Treas@@ ury Assistant at Oxford University .
&quot; a spokes@@ man of the University and Som@@ er@@ ville College said in an email statement that &quot; &quot; we are in contact with the police in the UK and are ready to help US investig@@ ative authorities in any way possible . &quot;
&quot; the statement added that War@@ ren &apos;s colleagues were sho@@ cked , and want him to set himself up . &quot;
&quot; chief Communications Officer of the Chicago Police Department , Anthony Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi , said he strongly urge the susp@@ ects to face the authorities . &quot;
&quot; the police have an idea of their place of stay , and our efforts to locate them , &quot; &quot; said Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi . &quot;
&quot; Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said that local , regional and national authorities help to find the susp@@ ects . &quot;
&quot; Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said the police received a call from the building manager of the Grand @-@ Plaza building , who had just received a mysterious tip , who said that something happened in apartment 1008 . &quot;
the police described the scene as very cruel .
&quot; Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said it was un@@ clear , whether the incident took place on July 27th . &quot;
security cameras were confirmed that La@@ them and War@@ ren were in the building .
&quot; we believe that Professor L@@ ath@@ am and the victim had a relationship , &quot; said Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi . &quot;
&quot; the management team of Grand Plaza published an explanation to the residents : &quot; &quot; the police currently works on the tim@@ eline and the background of the victim and expl@@ ores a variety of motifs , including a possible domestic incident . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we will close the WA@@ DA road@@ map in the near future &quot; &quot; - the Russian Deputy Prime Minister &quot;
the Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vit@@ aly Mut@@ ko said it won &apos;t be long before the remaining criteria of the World Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency ( WA@@ DA ) will be implemented for the restoration of the Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing agency ( R@@ US@@ A@@ DA ) .
&quot; at a certain stage of meeting the criteria of the schedule , R@@ US@@ A@@ DA has the right to plan and test in cooperation with U@@ K@@ AD ( UK Anti @-@ D@@ oping ) . &quot;
&quot; the WA@@ DA road@@ map was updated in this respect , &quot; &quot; explained Mut@@ ko on Thursday . &quot;
the PM commented the second part of WA@@ DA &apos;s road@@ map to comply with the code that describes the criteria for re @-@ establishment of R@@ US@@ A@@ DA and recently published on the organization &apos;s website .
&quot; according to Mut@@ ko , he does not contain anything that could cause concern for Russia . &quot;
&quot; everything has been announced , everything is being implemented . &quot;
&quot; and the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee ( IO@@ C ) and WA@@ DA in the near future , &quot; he added . &quot;
&quot; one of the criteria mentioned in the list , however , determines that Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing authorities have to publicly accept the reported results of the state @-@ sponsored dop@@ ing in Russian sports by the Canadian lawyer Richard Mc@@ L@@ aren . &quot;
&quot; in terms of the matter , Mut@@ ko said : &quot; &quot; we carry out the investigation because our anti @-@ dop@@ ing system has made a mistake . &quot;
all measures have been implemented .
&quot; but there were no government programs , and we will not admit anything that does not exist . &quot;
&quot; Mut@@ kos words agreed with those of Vit@@ aly Sm@@ ir@@ nov , the leader of the independent Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing commission . &quot;
&quot; in conversation with the Russian sales office at the beginning of the day Sm@@ ir@@ nov announced problems of the past in Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing organizations , but then added : &quot; we have repeatedly said that the report contains controversial positions and regulations . &quot;
&quot; no one has to accept this report un@@ condition@@ ally , &quot; &quot; added Sm@@ ir@@ nov . &quot;
R@@ US@@ A@@ DA was excluded in November 2015 in the course of dop@@ ing sc@@ and@@ als by WA@@ DA by the implementation of dop@@ ing checks in Russia .
&quot; however , it was allowed to plan and coordinate tests under the supervision of international experts and the UK Anti @-@ D@@ oping ( U@@ K@@ AD ) . &quot;
&quot; after visiting the headquarters of the Moscow organization in July , WA@@ DA CEO Olivier Nig@@ gli explained that R@@ US@@ A@@ DA moves in the right direction . &quot;
Al@@ di does not sell eggs at the moment more
this was shared by the groups .
&quot; it is a purely precau@@ tion , it could not be assumed by any health imp@@ airment , it was reported in the communication . &quot;
&quot; from now on only eggs must be delivered to Al@@ di , which have demonstr@@ ably been tested negative to fi@@ pron@@ il@@ ous anti @-@ L@@ over@@ s . &quot;
Al@@ di wanted to make clarity and transparency with its customers .
start @-@ ups that will help your company not to become the next U@@ ber
Amy Er@@ ret@@ t wanted to measure happiness with your e @-@ commerce start @-@ up but the surveys didn &apos;t work .
&quot; answers were often vag@@ ue , little helpful or worse - frau@@ dul@@ ent . &quot;
&quot; and even if you promised anony@@ m@@ ity , some workers did not mo@@ urn the process . &quot;
&quot; there was simply never consistency and objec@@ tivity , &quot; &quot; said Er@@ ret@@ t , who runs the 75 @-@ person San Francisco e @-@ Commerce Hair Care company Madi@@ son Re@@ ed . &quot;
it has called people from outside to help .
a new breed of Human Resources Start @-@ ups is on the wa@@ xing to help companies find out how their employees feel .
&quot; by creating and licensing software that has the specific purpose of measuring the employee engagement , it enables companies to address surveys , to address special groups and demographic groups , to address employees anony@@ m@@ ity and complaint hot@@ lines , and in some cases allow whi@@ stle blo@@ wers to deal with the C @-@ Suite managers and turn directly to the Board of Directors . &quot;
&quot; you now have tools like Stra@@ va and Fit@@ bit for tracking your health , but where is the Fit@@ bit for your company ? &quot; &quot; said Jim Bar@@ nett , co @-@ founder and Chief Executive of Red@@ wood City Start @-@ up G@@ lin@@ t whose software analytics tools are used by companies to measure employee engagement . &quot;
&quot; saved as a favorite to look at new things you post ... &#124; Hello , just wanted to mention , I liked this article . it was funny . keep oon posting ! &#124; &quot;
&quot; in addition to sn@@ ap surveys and surveys of certain teams , it offers a heat map of the company that shows at a glance which units have most complaints and which managers have low approval results - so that you can drill down why . &quot;
&quot; companies come to see that at the top of the workplace culture must remain so that you will not be the next U@@ ber who has been involved in sc@@ and@@ als since a former employee has published a blog post that describes an environment of har@@ ass@@ ment , with which those who have spoken are punished . &quot;
&quot; for start @-@ ups , such as G@@ lin@@ t , this wish is an overview of a lu@@ cr@@ ative business opportunity . &quot;
&quot; the global governance , regulation and compliance sector could have more than $ 1@@ 18.@@ 7 billion in 2020 , according to the financial technical website Let &apos;s Talk Pay@@ ments . &quot;
&quot; Den@@ ver , Colorado , Start @-@ up Conver@@ cent , the company helps to prevent and detect bad behavior , saw an increasing interest and activity at the beginning of this year in the midst of U@@ ber @-@ F@@ alles in Mis@@ sk@@ re@@ dit . &quot;
&quot; converting has almost 600 clients , including Air@@ b@@ n@@ b , Microsoft and Tes@@ la . &quot;
u@@ ber has recently signed up as a client .
&quot; as G@@ lin@@ t , converting companies will send tailor @-@ made &quot; pulse &quot; surveys , collect sensitive answers in real time and view the heat @-@ cards of your problem areas . &quot;
it also offers an anonymous SMS hot@@ line with which employees can report bad behavior .
&quot; and if the main business leader is involved , complaints go directly to the Supervisory Board . &quot;
&quot; the court of public opinion cap@@ tures the regul@@ ators , &quot; said Patrick Quin@@ lan , the founder and managing director of Conver@@ cent . &quot;
&quot; when a company is found that its employees are poor@@ ly treated or beha@@ ved in@@ eth@@ ically , it can experience costly consequences through consumer boy@@ cot@@ t , employee fluctu@@ ation and law@@ suits , &quot; &quot; Quin@@ lan said . &quot;
&quot; ruby Tuesday , the restaurant chain with over 25,000 employees and more than 500 sites , Conver@@ tible has used for more than one year to ensure that employees are aware of politics and procedures and have an easy way to reach their corporate headquarters . &quot;
&quot; in the past , if an employee wanted to report a problem , he or she would have to find a phone number or email for the company headquarters , submit a formal complaint and hope that he was taken seriously . &quot;
&quot; it was often a inti@@ mid@@ ation and uncomfortable experience , said James Vit@@ rano , Ruby TU@@ ES@@ DA@@ YS General Co@@ uns@@ el who said there was no good way to prosec@@ ute the complaints of employees . &quot;
&quot; now , as the company uses Conver@@ tible , problems that have previously been hidden by managers who were sitting in offices in cities or states were identified - like discrimination , har@@ ass@@ ment or unfair tra@@ ine@@ - faster identified and addressed . &quot;
&quot; I can get closer to this holistic , 360 @-@ degree view into the experience with employment , &quot; said Vit@@ rano , who heads the risk management group of Ruby Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and we protect our shareholders against employment disputes . &quot;
&quot; companies began to re@@ ap ethics , values and employee engagement in 2002 after the accounting firm Arthur Ander@@ sen broke down due to ethical violations by the En@@ ron sc@@ andal , said Quin@@ lan . &quot;
&quot; but it took until the &quot; social media came to their right , &quot; that companies recognized that they could not prevent that their dirty laundry went online . &quot;
&quot; prior to using technology to monitor ethics , people used hope as a strategy , &quot; he said . &quot;
both G@@ lin@@ t and Conver@@ cent offer your software as a service and charge companies with recur@@ ring fees for the use of their products .
it is a business model and a chance to find the consent of Venture Capital Invest@@ ors who have supported both start @-@ ups .
&quot; conver@@ cent received $ 10 million in financing in February of companies such as Sapphire Vent@@ ures and T@@ ola Capital , with which total funds were raised to $ 47 million . &quot;
&quot; gl@@ itz@@ ers secured $ 10 million in November by B@@ ess@@ emer Venture Partners , bringing his entire funding to $ 60 million . &quot;
&quot; this investment is hardly surprising considering the connected nature of companies , culture and venture capital . &quot;
&quot; there is a growing complex of research , showing that today &apos;s employees are more expecting from their jobs than before . &quot;
&quot; in competitive markets such as Silicon Valley , high sal@@ aries and interesting projects are only bet@@ s . &quot;
employees want the feeling that you are accepted and valued and that you give your time to a company with a positive mission .
&quot; when people are happy to be in a company that is their voices heard and that the work that you do is worthwhile , then they feel stronger to make this company successful , &quot; said Nina Mc@@ Queen , Vice President of Global Benef@@ its and Employee Experience at Link@@ ed@@ In , which uses both Conver@@ cent and G@@ lin@@ t . &quot;
investors can achieve yields if their portfolio companies run well . companies run well when employees are committed and engaged .
&quot; if the analytics tools of third promise to increase commitment and commitment of the employees , it is no wonder that you will find support . &quot;
the data on employee engagement according to the experts of the workplace culture is important .
but the data are useless if the administration of a company does not take action .
&quot; in fact , if a company asks staff after your feedback , it may have an expectation that change is on the way . &quot;
&quot; and if the change does not come fast enough , or not at all , this can breed dis@@ appointments and motiv@@ ate employees . &quot;
&quot; if you ask for 4,000 suggestions , you need to be ready to have 4,000 talks , &quot; said Russell Ra@@ ath , President of Consulting at the Business Management company Kot@@ ter International , who has seen the company too much on collecting data . &quot;
&quot; for if you do not follow , employees ask themselves , &quot; &quot; Have you really heard me ? &quot;
do you care about it ?
&quot; and if you don &apos;t care about it , why should I ? &quot;
&quot; Madi@@ son Re@@ ed , who now runs monthly sales surveys , has been able to initiate measures on the same day if a problem is reported about G@@ lin@@ t , so Er@@ ret@@ t . &quot;
&quot; and after collecting feedback from frustr@@ ated employees , it was able to re@@ organize multiple teams within the company and add a communication training to tackle the problems . &quot;
&quot; at Ruby Tuesday , the company always receives new insights about the employees , and it hopes that in the long run , this leads to a better binding of employees in a industry that is known for high turnover . &quot;
&quot; if you are not obliged to create a culture of transparency , you will lose man , &quot; said Vit@@ rano . &quot;
&quot; and if you lose people , you also lose customers . &quot;
&quot; and if you lose customer , you will lose business . &quot;
the N@@ CA@@ A elimin@@ ates the two @-@ day practices and makes a long day for the br@@ ink
it starts at 23 o &apos;clock when a lot of U@@ C@@ LA Foot@@ ball@@ players are talking on a page of the new practice fields of the team on campus .
some have pulled off their trousers parts and show the back full of sweat from the first day of the training camp .
&quot; for a good part of the team , these idle minutes are a lunch break . &quot;
players who are registered to the summer courses will return to their final audi@@ ts after the three @-@ hour exercise before they return to the Wasser@@ man Football Center the next morning .
&quot; that &apos;s for the guys the next three days a real treadmill , &quot; &quot; said Bru@@ ins @-@ Trainer Jim Mor@@ a shortly before the Monday became Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; the N@@ CA@@ A elimin@@ ates two @-@ day exercises to ease the load of the players , and it actually extended their days - at least until the final on Friday . &quot;
&quot; therefore , the first three sessions of the U@@ C@@ LA at 19 : 15 should start to meet the already fully packed schedule of the players . &quot;
&quot; the compromise away from the two days is more than a day when the bru@@ ins were postpon@@ ed to the beginning of the camp almost a week after the last season , and during the summer school for the first time during Mor@@ as performed practical exercises in West@@ wood for the first time . &quot;
they should hold 18 exercises during August . 20 before the start of formal preparations for their pr@@ el@@ ude to Texas A &amp; M in September .
&quot; Mor@@ a said that he supported the rules change of N@@ CA@@ A , even if they add another point to the busy routes of the player . &quot;
&quot; we put this enormous burden on them three or four days , and it is very challenging , &quot; said Mor@@ a . &quot;
&quot; and they just pushed it through , they plac@@ ken on , they are great people . &quot;
&quot; I think as soon as we come to Saturday and we have more time , it will really be great . &quot;
&quot; the U@@ C@@ LA will end its practices as soon as the Camp is termin@@ ated , which in view of the clear policies of its fields from an adjacent car park and adjacent Lus@@ kin Center , a hotel of up@@ scale class that has already cleared a protective grid behind a door@@ post , will not be an easy task . &quot;
&quot; Bru@@ ins players should occupy the hotel from this weekend , but Mor@@ a admitted that there could be a problem as soon as these rooms are free during the season . &quot;
&quot; we will use our security , &quot; said Mor@@ a . &quot;
&quot; this is a real problem , and it is not far @-@ fet@@ ched to think that people can rent a room there and then set up an exercise there . &quot;
&quot; if you have the video tape from an exercise , it &apos;s a pretty good business . &quot;
&quot; but we have security forces there , and we have security forces on parking . &quot;
we will do the best with what we have .
that is why I don &apos;t worry too much about this .
we have a plan . &quot;
Facebook wants to intensi@@ fy facts in the fight against counter@@ f@@ eit news
&quot; Facebook wants to send more potential articles with fal@@ seh@@ ood news to third parties and then show their results under the original contribution , the world &apos;s largest online social network announced on Thursday . it is one of its efforts to fight so @-@ called fake news . &quot;
&quot; the company said in a statement on its website that it will begin with the use of updated machine learning methods to detect possible false reports and send them to factor audi@@ tors , which may display results of the fact review from the original item . &quot;
&quot; Facebook was critic@@ ised as one of the main distribution points for so @-@ called fake news , many of which believe that they also influenced the 2016 presidential elections . &quot;
&quot; the problem has also become a major political issue in Europe , with the French voters being floo@@ ded with false stories in the run @-@ up of presidential elections in May , and Germany is supporting a plan to quickly eradi@@ cate hate @-@ filled post@@ ings as before the elections there in September . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , Facebook told in a separate statement in German that in the US , France , the Netherlands and Germany launched a test of the new facts review . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the knowledge , which stories of fac@@ tions exceeding third parties are challenged , people want more context to make informed decisions about what they read and share , &quot; said Sara Su , product manager for Facebook news in a blog . &quot;
&quot; she added that Facebook will continue to test his feature on the &quot; &quot; related article &quot; &quot; and working on other changes to his news feed to reduce wrong messages . &quot;
creating a comic novel : a castle in the history of England
in his recent past the little Scot@@ ney Castle was to be seen in a sque@@ eze music video and was a lo@@ op@@ hole for Margaret Th@@ at@@ cher in the 1970 @-@ s and 1980 @-@ s .
&quot; but Scot@@ ney has experienced 700 years of turbul@@ ent history from its cozy seat in the Bew@@ l River Valley in K@@ ent , and now has become an inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rho@@ des , a mop@@ ha@@ ari@@ c Yor@@ k@@ shi@@ re@@ man with a preference for historical documents . &quot;
&quot; I find it so beautiful to look at the manuscript of someone who has been dead for 300 years , &quot; he says . &quot;
what a personal relationship to keep this letter in my hand .
&quot; a Castle in England is spann@@ ing the period from the Middle Ages to the Age of Edward and documents the families that lived in Scot@@ ney . each story was illustrated by another , emerging British artist - Isaac Lenk@@ ie@@ wicz , Bri@@ ony May Smith , William Ex@@ ley , Beck@@ y Pal@@ mer and Isabel Gre@@ enberg . &quot;
&quot; it is not the first book of Rho@@ des that is based on an archive : he wrote 2014 &apos; Dead Men &apos;s Te@@ eth and Other Stories &apos; , a collection that was inspired by documents in the British Library - a project that he found un@@ expect@@ edly emotional . &quot;
&quot; I only responded to the thumb pressure on the side of a letter , which was written by a double agent in the 1700 &apos;s , who worked for the Jacob@@ ins , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is his thumb pressure ! &quot;
&quot; and letters always smell smoke , for at that time one burned a fire for the light . &quot;
&quot; for someone who lives 300 years later , the smell has an effect as if he himself would be there . &quot;
&quot; Oh , I love archives ! &quot;
&quot; for someone who is so beaten with old papers that he is supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council England and lived for almost four months in a castle ( &quot; &quot; To be honest : I &apos;ve over@@ rated my welcome greeting &quot; &quot; ) it all seems too nice to be true . &quot;
&quot; Rho@@ des spent his days exploring the Vict@@ orian &quot; &quot; new &quot; &quot; castle to see the archives and study the many treasures and curi@@ osi@@ ties of the castle , such as the mounted hy@@ bri@@ ds on the walls and the bottles that had spent centuries in dit@@ ch . &quot;
&quot; he emig@@ rated through the terrain and the ruins of the old castle and spoke to landsc@@ aping , gar@@ den@@ ers and sometimes also with the artists who worked on the illustrations of his book . &quot;
&quot; then , at night he d@@ rank &quot; Whis@@ key and began to write . &quot;
&quot; the intimate history of Scot@@ ney is relatively unknown since the National Trust received full access until 2006 , when the last Er@@ bin , Elizabeth Hus@@ sey died . &quot;
&quot; when Rho@@ des arrived a decade later , the employees began to take care of the archive that he described as &quot; hundreds of years in which aristoc@@ rats said &quot; Oh , throw it on the loft . &quot; &quot;
&quot; di@@ aries , letters from the time of the English Empire , cards that represent who had something : &quot; you could think that land conflicts would be boring , &quot; says Rho@@ des , &quot; but there was a bir@@ ch to fight the two families . &quot;
&quot; guys , let all go his gear ! &quot;
&quot; some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to dive into the English history , among them &apos; The Lab@@ our@@ er &apos; that follows a man who leaves the newly built castle to join the peasant uprising of 13@@ 81 . &quot;
&quot; there is a record of an uph@@ eav@@ al that occurred in the castle in 13@@ 80 , in this book titled &apos; Kni@@ ghtly Famili@@ es of K@@ ent and Sus@@ sex &apos; , &quot; says Rho@@ des . &quot;
&quot; the peasant uprising began in this area , and I thought an insurrection was a good start . &quot;
perhaps the two are inter@@ connected ? &quot;
other stories are firmly rooted in the history of the castle - like &apos; The Pri@@ est &apos; that tells the story of the Jes@@ uit pat@@ ers that the Dar@@ rell family hid seven years during the English Reformation .
&quot; or &apos; The S@@ mu@@ gg@@ ler &apos; , in which the smu@@ gg@@ ler Arthur Dar@@ rell was portra@@ yed from the 18th century , who fil@@ med his own fun@@ eral by filling a coff@@ in with stones ( a discovery that was first excav@@ ated years later when his coff@@ in was excav@@ ated ) . &quot;
&quot; the Dar@@ r@@ ells are Rho@@ des &apos;s Favor@@ ite family of Scot@@ ney : &quot; the gentle@@ men seemed to be quite a g@@ aun@@ er , always make debt and spend money for things they could not afford . &quot;
&quot; other generations of Dar@@ rell @-@ men solved their debt crises by mar@@ rying old women - I imagine it as a bunch of well @-@ looking guys , with a talent to adver@@ tise land@@ fill . &quot;
&quot; after the end of his deployment in the castle , Rho@@ des is searching for other unique cri@@ b experiences &quot;
&quot; he has brought a two @-@ week stay in the Finnish wilderness for a comic novel about E@@ lä@@ män@@ mä@@ ki , the site of a san@@ atorium from the early 20th century , which has since been rec@@ laimed by nature . &quot;
but Scot@@ ney has a special place for him .
&quot; I was sad to go back , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; it was like &quot; &quot; Oh , now I have to deal with the dam@@ ned life again . &quot;
campaign launched : over 300 years old Mari@@ enk@@ ap@@ elle wrapped in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf
&quot; with the fusion of the 301 @-@ year @-@ old Mari@@ enk@@ ap@@ elle in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf , the city of Bad Honne@@ f started its campaign to introduce a new umbrella brand ( Rund@@ schau of Thursday ) . &quot;
&quot; until Thursday , mayor Otto Neu@@ hoff and his marketing team want to keep Nelson Art@@ z &apos;s logo and slogan . &quot;
&quot; at the end of August , there will be a feast on the island of Gra@@ fen@@ wer@@ th as the highlight of the campaign . &quot;
&quot; too beautiful for us .
&quot; or ? , &quot; the Mak@@ ers of Action have been asking for the posters at the &quot; Rh@@ ön@@ dorfer chapel . &quot; &quot;
&quot; we do not really think ( of course ! ) not really , &quot; they write on their web page released yesterday . &quot;
but we use this measure to attract your attention .
&quot; and to make it clear , that some things are better than it seems . &quot;
&quot; basically , we are firmly convinced that as Bad Honne@@ fer citizens we are very well aware of the beauty and attra@@ c@@ tiveness of our city . &quot;
&quot; the action is more than &quot; &quot; just &quot; &quot; a logo and a slogan , it is further . &quot;
&quot; it is necessary to form@@ ulate a single @-@ standing promise , one that gives the city an unmistak@@ able unique experience . &quot;
&quot; finally , it stands in competition with other municipalities . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the city of Bad Honne@@ f will cost its new umbrella brand and campaign . &quot;
military reforms in Turkey - Erd@@ og@@ an &apos;s fear of the army
&quot; every year at the beginning of August , in Ankara , the Supreme Military Council ( Y@@ AS ) advis@@ es on reti@@ re@@ es and promotions in the Offic@@ ers Corps . &quot;
this is how this week .
at first sight a normal procedure .
but nothing is routine in the Turkish armed forces one year after the attempted coup attempt .
&quot; the meeting was no longer held in the building of the General Staff , as formerly , but in the office of the Prime Minister . &quot;
&quot; under the chair@@ manship of the government , the five Deputy Prime Ministers and the Defence , Home Affairs , Justice and Foreign Affairs Minister took part . &quot;
&quot; in this way , the civilians in the Y@@ AS were in the number of numbers . &quot;
the government moves the re@@ ins in the military .
&quot; the Chief of Staff , Hul@@ us@@ i Ak@@ ar , remains in office , but the commander of the army , the air strikes and the nav@@ y were removed . &quot;
&quot; since the failed coup , Erdoğan has fired Erd@@ og@@ an 169 of 326 gener@@ als and admir@@ als . &quot;
&quot; more than 10,000 soldiers were removed from the ranks of the army - mostly due to alleged ties to the movement of the Ex@@ il Pre@@ dig@@ er Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , the Erd@@ og@@ an as a clin@@ ician of the put@@ sch@@ ver@@ su@@ chs . &quot;
&quot; against 486 people , who have been directly involved in the coup attempt , will be negoti@@ ated in Ankara since this week . &quot;
&quot; on the day after the coup , Erd@@ og@@ an had called the revolution as a &quot; gift of God , &quot; because he gave him the opportunity to fully clean the armed forces . &quot;
but Erd@@ og@@ an actually has a grip on the army ?
&quot; at the end of February , the newspaper &quot; Hür@@ ri@@ yet &quot; published an article entitled &quot; Un@@ beha@@ ved in Military Head@@ quarters . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in the general staff there are concerns about an increasing &quot; Islam@@ ization &quot; of the army , which , among other things , manifest@@ ed itself in the ab@@ olition of the military ban for soldiers , wrote the newspaper . &quot;
&quot; in any case , the Grand Master in the army and the security forces goes on . &quot;
&quot; in mid @-@ July Erd@@ og@@ an sent another 73@@ 95 public servants by decree , including 230@@ 3 police officers and 546 soldiers . &quot;
it seemed that Erd@@ og@@ an was t@@ amed the military .
the gener@@ als were formerly known as the actual masters of the country .
&quot; three times , they appe@@ aled to their role as guar@@ di@@ ans of the secular state order . &quot;
&quot; after his election victory in 2002 , Erd@@ og@@ an pushed back the power of the military step by step , not least by calling on the reform proposals of the European Union . &quot;
former officers say Erd@@ og@@ an induc@@ es specifically an Islam@@ ization of the armed forces .
&quot; in the magazine &quot; &quot; Vo@@ cal Europe &quot; , &quot; a name not called officer , seeking asylum from persecution abroad , the Turkish army will be &quot; &quot; full of extre@@ mi@@ sts and Sal@@ af@@ ists &quot; &quot; in a few years . &quot;
&quot; if this is true , such a development could not leave N@@ ato cold . &quot;
&quot; in any case , in the alliance after the pur@@ ges , there are doubts about the readiness of the Turkish army . &quot;
&quot; leadership structures and operational capabilities are &quot; weak@@ ened , &quot; say N@@ ato diplom@@ ats . &quot;
Washington changes the rules for the Green Card
&quot; there will be a new US immigration plan to change the rules of the Green Card , said President Donald Tr@@ ump , quoted from the media . &quot;
&quot; he fores@@ ees to lower the legal immigrants to 50,000 per year , stric@@ ter rules for obtaining vis@@ as for a temporary work permit and restrictions for family @-@ oriented vis@@ as . &quot;
the new rules are proposed by the Repub@@ lic@@ ans and supported by the President .
the bill is to be discussed in the two chambers of Congress .
&quot; this law will reduce poverty , increase wages and save billions of dollars for tax@@ pay@@ ers , and will do so by giving the US the way citizens from other countries are spent Green Cards . &quot;
the law will prevent chain migration and replace the current system .
&quot; this new application procedure will benefit the candidate who speak English , who have the financial means to support themselves and show knowledge that will benefit our economy , &quot; said Tr@@ ump , quoted by the American media . &quot;
Ministry wants to rehab@@ ilit@@ ate track for racing shuttle
&quot; over the past few months , the future of the race pace has been fought over and over again - now it should go very fast . &quot;
&quot; before the end of the year , the route is to be built on the route where the tourist train runs . &quot;
&quot; in order to secure the future of the race pace long @-@ term , according to the Ministry of Transport , construction work will begin this year . &quot;
&quot; with the decision to further order and renov@@ ate the route Il@@ men@@ au @-@ Renn@@ stei@@ g , the country is particularly important for the tourism sector , &quot; stated State Secretary Klaus S@@ üh@@ l on Friday in Er@@ furt . &quot;
the cost of over@@ hau@@ ling the track was about 2.5 million euros .
&quot; of this sum , the country transfers 75 percent . &quot;
&quot; the contract , based on which the shuttle should also be ordered in the future from the country , is currently finally approved , declared S@@ üh@@ l . &quot;
the ministry and the Süd@@ th@@ ür@@ itz Railway as an operator are already in agreement with the technical details .
&quot; this means that the road@@ map , the vehicles used and the quality standards are tra@@ ded , &quot; said S@@ üh@@ l . &quot;
the planned contract between the ministry and the railway company will be closed for a period of eleven years .
&quot; in this way , the racing division should be ordered regular on December 2017 . &quot;
the Renn@@ stei@@ g @-@ Shuttle is a popular rail link between the railway stations Il@@ men@@ au and Renn@@ stei@@ g .
&quot; in the course of a pilot operation , it has been tested in the course of a pilot operation , whether the route is used by sufficient many people to order them regularly in the future . &quot;
the route is also very common in parts .
&quot; the rise of sex robots is real , and we should worry about it &quot;
&quot; just as you thought it can &apos;t be crazy in 2017 , a new report on technological developments in the area of sex robots will come . &quot;
&quot; yes , in fact . &quot;
sex robots are at the moment a big thing .
the Foundation for Respon@@ sible Robotics ( FR@@ R ) recently published a report on the development of sex robots in the next five to ten years .
&quot; according to No@@ el Shar@@ key , Professor of Robot@@ ik and artificial intelligence at She@@ ff@@ ield University and co @-@ founder of FR@@ R , we must start taking their as@@ cen@@ sion seriously . &quot;
&quot; customers can choose the eye color of the robot , its form of ni@@ pple and type of f@@ ing@@ ern@@ ail . &quot;
&quot; people make fun of them , but the companies deliver a lot of them and we will see them much more often , &quot; &quot; Mr. Shar@@ key said at the release of his new report . &quot;
modern sl@@ ings have evolved from their inf@@ lat@@ able partners to robots with a silicone skin that feels warm - with consciously human reactions that are achieved by artificial intelligence .
&quot; the user can also adjust his robot according to his beliefs , and select everything from the robot &apos;s eye color to the form of ni@@ p@@ ples to the type or colour of his f@@ ing@@ ern@@ ails . &quot;
&quot; but it is even more distur@@ bing since many robots have the &quot; &quot; personalities &quot; &quot; who would like a Step@@ ford woman to look like progres@@ sively . &quot;
modern S@@ exp@@ u@@ ppen have evolved to robots with a silicone skin .
&quot; the Real@@ Bot@@ ix robot enables its users to adapt their robots to the properties that they find appealing , such as sh@@ y@@ ness . &quot;
&quot; and then there are the Ro@@ xx@@ xy Gold Sex @-@ robots developed by True Compan@@ ion with pre@@ programmed personalities such as &quot; Fri@@ gi@@ d Far@@ rah , &quot; which gives the impression of sh@@ y@@ ness and &quot; Wild W@@ endy &quot; with an &quot; &quot; adv@@ entu@@ rous &quot; &quot; personality . &quot;
&quot; Ro@@ xx@@ xy Gold has a personality adapted to your personality as well as possible , &quot; war@@ ms the True Compan@@ ion website . &quot;
&quot; so she likes what you like , and she doesn &apos;t like what you don &apos;t like , etc . &quot;
&quot; in the course of the day , it also has its m@@ oods - like real people ! &quot;
&quot; it can be tired , fixed to conversation or it can be &quot; &quot; in mood &quot; &quot; ! &quot;
&quot; there are many distur@@ bing aspects of this rise of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the sub@@ missive feminine features , the hints on rape , when one walks a step on Fri@@ gi@@ d ( i.e. here : contra@@ sting ) Far@@ rah , distur@@ b one most . &quot;
&quot; on his website True Compan@@ ion Ro@@ xx@@ xy with a vibr@@ ator , but for men . &quot;
&quot; if women ( sic ) can have a vibr@@ ator , why can men then have no Ro@@ xx@@ xy ? &quot;
&quot; however , these sex robots are not just a fe@@ tish or simply just another sex toy . &quot;
&quot; their origin and increasing sophistic@@ ation point to a bit dar@@ ker and deeper in our culture , towards a retreat from the ideal of gender equality towards a desire for sex with submission as optional enc@@ ore . &quot;
&quot; most men will of course not hold sex robots , and while the FR@@ R not@@ ices their growing popularity , they remain nonetheless on the ver@@ ge of consumer culture . &quot;
&quot; but that which le@@ ak@@ eth out of the boundary zones , can be very instruc@@ tive in relation to the spirit of the time in which we live . &quot;
&quot; and many people are not stran@@ gely or insul@@ ting , until the free market gives them permission . &quot;
&quot; there is a certain over@@ lap that these highly developed sex robots appear at a time in which women &apos;s rights are threatened all over the world , in which there is a president in the White House who has prev@@ ailed to have sex@@ ually attacked women . &quot;
&quot; the most horri@@ fying aspect of the TV series &apos; The Hand@@ maid &apos;s T@@ ale &apos; ( &apos; Der Report der Mag@@ d &apos; ) are not the graphical images , the intri@@ cate body and the out @-@ out eyes , but how realistic this vision works . &quot;
&quot; the Republic of Gilead is a leap , but at the moment it does not feel like a great leap . &quot;
the goal behind these sex robots is to produce a physical simil@@ arity to actual women as realistic as technically possible ( if also with porno@@ star proportions ) .
their builders want them to feel human that they im@@ itate the movement of a real body .
&quot; but , to the point when it comes to their &quot; personalities , &quot; robots are not real women . &quot;
they cannot separate themselves from their companion or simply go away .
&quot; they have no medi@@ ation or background story , nothing that points to independence or anything that might distur@@ b the imagination of total submission . &quot;
&quot; in other words , they are fake slaves . &quot;
or to express it in the saying of 2017 : maid Girl
Tr@@ umps great performance ?
he makes Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney the ep@@ it@@ ome of healthy human mind
&quot; it has become a sen@@ sing wisdom of the Tr@@ ump era , that the political divisions , which pol@@ ari@@ zed the US voters , also split families in small @-@ format . &quot;
around Christmas and Th@@ ank@@ s@@ giving there were newspapers in the USA with advice about how to deal with the horror of Tr@@ ump sel@@ fish relatives .
we are all supposed to take care of our filter bub@@ bles .
&quot; less noticed is the power of Tr@@ umps , families to bring together . &quot;
&quot; I mention this because my c@@ ousin , a left @-@ orient@@ ated poet who lives in Chicago and has long been busy with the Repub@@ lic@@ ans in our family , visited me this week in New York . &quot;
it reminded me that unity against a common enemy can have a powerful effect .
&quot; with Tr@@ ump in the White House , everyone she knows , including the repub@@ lican family , with whom she had fought for decades because of politics , suddenly and quite strange on the same side . &quot;
&quot; for the dining table this is certainly a good thing , but it falls to me in a further context that this also ent@@ ails considerable risks . &quot;
&quot; the left was strengthened by Tr@@ ump , but the satis@@ factory effect of his pres@@ idency has the strength to push us all to the right . &quot;
&quot; when we speak of &quot; norm@@ alization &quot; and tr@@ ump , we refer to the cre@@ ep@@ y possibility that his k@@ itt@@ ens will no longer be rep@@ lic@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; however , there is an even more difficult long @-@ term scenario in which Tr@@ ump Repub@@ lic@@ ans of the right wing &quot; norm@@ alized , &quot; which suddenly appear as the ep@@ it@@ ome of reason@@ abl@@ eness . &quot;
&quot; today I think of an active nostal@@ gia for Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney &apos;s ur@@ com@@ ical version of the mad@@ man - the dog on the car roof , the 14 % income tax ( but at least we knew how his tax return looked like ) - both in fact appear to be a very mild criminal act . &quot;
&quot; when Tr@@ ump goes , the next candidate of the re@@ public@@ ans must be only mentally healthy in order to qualify as im@@ meas@@ urable improvement . &quot;
&quot; as my c@@ ousin in the city , we brought our children to the carousel in Central Park , the biggest of the New York park department , and the best three dollars you can spend in the city if you don &apos;t need caff@@ eine . &quot;
&quot; the horses are enormous , the fi@@ ber@@ glass designs on the central cylinder - all c@@ low@@ ns are grow@@ ling and the animals turn to look full of fear of their own shoulders - extremely dark and the climate @-@ per@@ ming music convey@@ s this in a strange way . &quot;
&quot; so many c@@ lich@@ és of a city dis@@ ap@@ point : the views of high buildings are old , the sky@@ lines become familiar to offer a lot of excitement , and the reality of the city will not live up to the dream . &quot;
&quot; thirty @-@ five years later , and I &apos;m still not completely over the day when I found out that Swiss Cottage is indeed no Swiss Cottage - the Them@@ e Pub Y@@ e Ol@@ de Swiss Cottage is not - but a major round@@ about in the north of London . &quot;
&quot; the Central Park carousel is still a strange magic experience , since two years old , a 11 @-@ year @-@ old and two women in the 40 @-@ year @-@ old can go and all have a great time . &quot;
&quot; if I could have been able to evaluate the carousel , I would have given him the full score , but luckily no one asked him . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , I was forced into a department store this week to evaluate my &quot; experience &quot; with transactions on a scale of one to five stars before I could pass through my credit card . &quot;
&quot; in the coffee house at the corner of my street it is the same , plus the option to balance the rating with a 15 % tip - this to buy something about the counter . &quot;
&quot; this does not only lead to a slow@@ down of what should be a neutral exchange , but also exer@@ ts pressure on the server to bring personality into a situation where no need is required . &quot;
&quot; the poor woman in the department store was exc@@ used , while I was tired of the experience to reach her my credit card with five stars . &quot;
Oscar Pist@@ ori@@ us laid out with chest pain from prison to the hospital
&quot; for the second time , Pist@@ ori@@ us left the prison for a hospital visit . &quot;
&quot; last year he was brought to the hospital because of the treatment of cuts , which he report@@ edly suffered after a fall in his cell . &quot;
Pist@@ ori@@ us was sentenced to a first death sentence due to murder after an appeal of prosec@@ ut@@ ors .
he killed Ste@@ enk@@ amp in the early hours of Valent@@ ine &apos;s Day 2013 by shooting them several times through a door of the toilet cabin in his house in Pre@@ t@@ oria .
&quot; Pist@@ ori@@ us asser@@ ted that he held his girl@@ friend for a no@@ c@@ turn@@ al intru@@ der , hiding in the cabin . &quot;
&quot; the prosec@@ ut@@ ors have announced their intention to appeal against the six @-@ year sentence of Pist@@ ori@@ us appeal , from which they say they are too transparent . &quot;
&quot; the National Criminal Inves@@ tigation Department said that it would appeal to the Supreme Court of South Africa , and the obj@@ ection could be heard this year . &quot;
&quot; Pist@@ ori@@ us is at risk that his sentence will be increased to 15 years , if the prosec@@ ut@@ ors are successful . &quot;
there is no death penalty in South Africa .
as Bauer Arnold finds a strange egg
&quot; as the last of the Blum@@ berg schools , the four t@@ ang@@ lers from F@@ ats and E@@ pf@@ en@@ ho@@ fen were released in the holidays and in the secondary schools . &quot;
&quot; three of the clas@@ sm@@ ates will go to secondary school in the future , four to the secondary school . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday evening , school director Angel@@ ika Sit@@ te welcomed the parents and representatives of the public at the Bürger@@ haus Bi@@ es@@ ental in E@@ pf@@ en@@ ho@@ fen . &quot;
&quot; as a symbol of the dism@@ iss@@ al , the 29 students of the four classes elected a young eagle that grows in the chicken farm , but then released into freedom . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the m@@ lower Sch@@ ar performed a musical with the title &quot; The Eagle in the chicken farm . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Bauer Arnold found a strange egg , and burned it by his chick@@ ens . &quot;
&quot; instead of a hen house , a small eagle came out . &quot;
&quot; but the hope of making a chicken out of him sm@@ ashed , the eagle spread out his wings on a high mountain . &quot;
&quot; after that , the classes showed three and four in the study of Y@@ vonne Frank a chicken tan@@ z . &quot;
&quot; the h@@ ens d@@ anced with the young goat , carrying the cylinders to the bet . &quot;
&quot; the eagle stands for the integration , said school manager Angel@@ ika Sit@@ te . &quot;
&quot; the young is different from the other k@@ itt@@ ens ( chic@@ ks ) , but belong to it . &quot;
but he will never be like a chicken .
his determination is to be free .
she wished for every four @-@ piece sler that he feels accepted in his new school .
&quot; thank@@ s@@ word to the colleagues , the former school manager Michael Müller , who always jumps up with lessons , and the parents &quot; representatives . &quot;
&quot; the ch@@ ick @-@ time is over now , explained class teacher Sophia Schumacher . &quot;
&quot; after two years of teaching , she only dismis@@ ses lessons because it was a really great time . &quot;
&quot; finally , they can rely on the four @-@ ton@@ ne sler . &quot;
&quot; finally , all students left a song from summer@@ time and vacation time . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , great joy broke out in the children . &quot;

&quot; two Bulg@@ arians were imprisoned for illegal camps in Greece , shared the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , quoted from television . &quot;
&quot; on the morning of August 1 , the police arrested a group of illegal refugees in Si@@ th@@ onia , including the two Bulg@@ arians . &quot;
&quot; on the same day , they were released , while an examination is currently underway . &quot;
the Foreign Ministry reported B@@ TV that the Bulg@@ arians were released later .
&quot; the Greek authorities have shar@@ pen@@ ed the control over the free camp and place everyone who is found to stay at a place , which is not meant for this purpose , substantial funds . &quot;
the controls will be continued throughout the season .
the ministry said that the court can impose a fine of money .
software update for diesel vehicles : what those affected need to know now
how exactly does the software update take place ?
do diesel drivers need to participate in the action ?
the most important questions and answers at a glance .
&quot; at the diesel summit , BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW group software updates offered software updates for a total of around 5,@@ 3 million cars . &quot;
they should improve the emissions of emissions from emissions from emissions to Euro 5 and in part Euro 6 .
Euro @-@ 4 diesel or worse are excluded .
Anja S@@ met@@ an@@ in from ACE Auto Club Europe gives ass@@ essments :
is the new action mandatory ?
&quot; no , the software updates dealt with are optional . &quot;
&quot; the mandatory updates before are only valid for the vehicles that have the Schum@@ an software , &quot; says Anja S@@ met@@ an@@ in . &quot;
the retro@@ fitting has ordered the German Federal Aviation Office ( KBA ) .
how and when are customers informed about updates ?
&quot; the manufacturers have announced rapid implementation in the next few months , but not called an exact date . &quot;
Daimler was informed to write to each person affected .
&quot; if any inspection is due anyway , it is done in its framework . &quot;
how long can the retro@@ fitting be drawn up ?
&quot; hard to say , &quot; says S@@ met@@ an@@ in . &quot;
the hang@@ ings of the manufacturer &apos;s commitment as well as from the political pressure .
&quot; because we have seen , the car manufacturers do not act on the subject of the environment so far . &quot;
how long should the update take ?
the conversion itself could last only three to four hours in the workshop .
time @-@ consuming could be to get an appointment .
&quot; what do drivers do , who do not drive a car from BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW group ? &quot;
the ACE goes to wait .
&quot; presum@@ ably foreign manufacturers would follow , so S@@ met@@ an@@ in . &quot;
is there a massive price decline of Euro @-@ 4 cars ?
the ACE feared that .
&quot; but just in the regions , where road b@@ ans thre@@ aten . &quot;
&quot; in rural areas , there is no loss of value for older diesel so far . &quot;
the ACE advis@@ es to wait for sale yet .
ll Cool J receives Kennedy Center Award
Kennedy Awards Gala is one of the gl@@ am@@ our@@ ing events in Washington .
the first award ceremony under President Tr@@ ump promises to become politically .
one of the lau@@ re@@ ates does not want to come - from protest .
ll Cool J ( 49 ) gets the first ra@@ pper one of the cov@@ eted awards of the prestigious Kennedy Center .
&quot; this year also singer Gl@@ oria Est@@ ef@@ an ( 59 ) , Li@@ onel Rich@@ ie ( 68 ) and the chore@@ ographer Carmen de Lav@@ all@@ ade ( 86 ) and the TV producer Norman Le@@ ar ( 95 ) belong to the scholars . &quot;
the awards will be handed over at the beginning of December .
&quot; traditionally , US President Donald Tr@@ ump will hold a reception and participate in the ceremony together with his wife Mel@@ ania . &quot;
&quot; the prize winner , Le@@ ar announced with progressive TV shows , has already announced to refra@@ in from taking part in the g@@ ala . &quot;
&quot; he said : &quot; &quot; this pres@@ idency has decided to completely neg@@ lect the arts and human rights - even to depri@@ ve them of the means - and that bur@@ dens me . &quot;
&quot; the 59 @-@ year @-@ old Est@@ ef@@ an stressed , she will use the conversation with Tr@@ ump to make clear her view . &quot;
&quot; the Kennedy @-@ Center , named after former President John F. Kennedy , is the largest cultural institution in the US capital . &quot;
&quot; the former pri@@ zew@@ inners include Mer@@ yl Stre@@ ep , Are@@ tha Fran@@ klin , Robert De Nir@@ o , George Lucas , Tom H@@ anks and St@@ ing . &quot;
we make the city life worth
&quot; Roland W@@ acker , Has@@ lach@@ s Stadt@@ bau@@ meister , works in pensions next year . &quot;
&quot; the site is already adverti@@ sed , but most suitable applicants are rare . &quot;
for 31 years W@@ acker &apos;s Stadt@@ bau@@ meister is a master builder .
&quot; and the work is still great fun , as it convey@@ s in the Pres@@ seg@@ es@@ prä@@ che . &quot;
&quot; he reports from diversi@@ fied , but also demanding tasks waiting for his successor . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , it is aston@@ ished that until now no application meets the requirements profile . &quot;
the city is looking for an architect or civil engineer at the next possible time .
&quot; so , considering the regular periods of notice , there should be enough time for a revision . &quot;
&quot; since Has@@ lach acts for the administration community as the Lower Building Authority , the applicant must assign corresponding degrees . &quot;
because this function wants to keep the city in any case .
&quot; if it would no longer be able to fill it out , the citizens would have to go to Off@@ enburg . &quot;
&quot; but citizen proximity to the city and it is important to him , says W@@ acker , who reports about a good working climate as well as a good atmosphere between authorities and citizens . &quot;
&quot; in more than 30 years in office , some important projects have accumulated , looking back to the W@@ acker with pride . &quot;
&quot; we make the city life worthy , &quot; he is sure about the building and its staff . &quot;
&quot; but also in the future , diversi@@ fied projects are on the agenda : the re@@ design of the former Hu@@ kl@@ a @-@ Are@@ as and of the Nieder@@ ho@@ fen@@ park@@ platz . &quot;
&quot; the Kin@@ zig@@ brücke between Boll@@ enbach and Stein@@ ach is renewed , even the stadium renovation is still subject . &quot;
&quot; the latter alone will be@@ ech around 1.5 million Euros , &quot; if we do it right , &quot; W@@ acker estimates . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; all in all , great tasks await my successor . &quot;
the work here is fun . &quot;
design is available for a master builder in large playing space .
&quot; with Has@@ lach &apos;s own Bau@@ hof and Gär@@ t@@ ner@@ ei , it can be flexibly responded to versatility . &quot;
&quot; you can move a lot , &quot; said W@@ acker , and the design of the green spaces is often praised by citizens and visitors . &quot;
&quot; as the old town as an ensemble stands under monument protection , it is important to &quot; have an eye for it , &quot; which imp@@ airs &quot; when new buildings are approved , the out@@ going town builder empha@@ sizes . &quot;
&quot; anyway , the Stadt@@ bau@@ meister is carrying high responsibility . &quot;
&quot; he is a builder , &quot; &quot; in the end everything runs here above my table . &quot;
&quot; in the event of supervision and coordination , he can count on many years of staff : Markus Neu@@ ma@@ ier ( high construction ) has been here for ten years , Manfred Schön@@ er ( Tief@@ bau ) has been working for 15 years . &quot;
&quot; also , that his successor remains for a long time , W@@ acker wants : &quot; we are looking for someone who wants to really identify and stay with the job . &quot;
&quot; continuity is not only important for a good working climate , but also for the further development of the city . &quot;
&quot; if you want to be asp@@ ed to Roland W@@ acker , you should have completed academic studies as a graduate engineer or Bachelor &apos;s degree in architecture and have good knowledge in the fields of planning and planning law . &quot;
&quot; the Stadt@@ bau@@ amt under@@ lies high@@ - and civil engineering , construction guidelines , under@@ mining activities , administration of the urban properties , municipal court yard with building yard and municipal gymn@@ asi@@ um , as well as lower construction rights authority , including monuments conservation . &quot;

&quot; according to the police , the previously unknown perpetr@@ ators had thrown the blue bicycle from the rail@@ road crossing in the area of Le@@ ob@@ ener Straße ( B@@ 116 ) on the lines . &quot;
&quot; these were so badly damaged , that the approaching freight train had to be stopped . &quot;
the investig@@ ators go out of two male perpetr@@ ators and have been searching for them for the night hours .
&quot; near the crime scene , a pink sco@@ oter and a bike rider were observed by witnesses . &quot;
&quot; this goes far beyond a Lus@@ ati@@ an empire , &quot; said Ö@@ BB spokes@@ person Christoph Pos@@ ch to AP@@ A . &quot;
the perpetr@@ ators could have brought themselves into great danger and also je@@ op@@ ardi@@ zed the transport of the train .
&quot; in addition to the damage to the locom@@ otive and the system , as well as the delay drive and the costs for rail transport , P@@ ön@@ dern der Bahn customers could also get to the perpetr@@ ators . &quot;
&quot; overall , from a &quot; substantial &quot; sum , the spokes@@ man said . &quot;
&quot; the damage was repaired on Friday afternoon , the railway traffic on the south track could be led without disabilities . &quot;
&quot; almost ten persons were killed in Friday morning , two of which were tel@@ ev@@ ised . &quot;
&quot; freight trains did not fall out , but they were late . &quot;
&quot; according to Ö@@ BB spokes@@ person Christoph Pos@@ ch , about 200 metres of overhead lines had to be replaced . &quot;
insul@@ ators and ma@@ sts were also damaged .
&quot; meat , dairy products and chocolate could help rel@@ ieve IB@@ D ( Infl@@ amm@@ ation ) &quot;
red meat and chocolate can sound like a night@@ mare for your diges@@ tive system .
&quot; but a new study claims exactly the opposite : a diet that is rich in meat @-@ based proteins and dairy products , could alle@@ vi@@ ate the symptoms of patients with inflammatory bow@@ el disease . &quot;
&quot; the inc@@ urable condition , which affects approximately 1.3 million in the USA in the USA , causes stomach cr@@ amps and flat@@ ul@@ ence , recur@@ rent or bloody di@@ arr@@ ho@@ ea , weight loss and extreme ti@@ red@@ ness . &quot;
&quot; while patients are usually advised to avoid meat and dairy products in order to alle@@ vi@@ ate their symptoms , researchers found out at the Washington University that the essential amino acid tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han contributes to developing immune cells that promote a toler@@ ant intest@@ ines . &quot;
&quot; the conduc@@ tive researcher , Dr. Marco Col@@ onna , explained that immune cells can pat@@ rol in the intest@@ ines to ensure that harmful micro@@ bes that hide in the food cannot penet@@ rate into the body . &quot;
&quot; cells capable of trig@@ gering inflammation , are balanced by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without dam@@ aging sensitive tissues . &quot;
&quot; if the balance is too far in the direction of inflammation , it can result in inflammatory bow@@ el disease . &quot;
experiments have been found that a kind of tolerance @-@ promoting immune cell occurs in mice that carry a certain bacter@@ ium in their intest@@ ines .
and the bacter@@ ium needs tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han - one of the building blocks of proteins - to dis@@ solve the appearance of the cells .
&quot; Professor Col@@ onna said : &quot; we have established a connection between a bacterial species - Lac@@ tob@@ ac@@ ill@@ us reu@@ ter@@ i - which is a normal part of the gut micro@@ bi@@ ome , and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance . &quot;
&quot; the more tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han the mice had in their food , the more they had from these immune cells . &quot;
&quot; he suggested that the combination of L. reu@@ ter@@ i and one of tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han rich nutrition toler@@ ant , less flamm@@ able intestinal mi@@ lie@@ us , if the same system also we@@ ke in humans . &quot;
&quot; the post @-@ doctoral fellow Dr. Lu@@ isa Cer@@ v@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan , studied a kind of immune cell that promotes tolerance when she found out that a group of study mice had such cells , but another group of the same tribe , which was but separated , did not have . &quot;
&quot; it assumed that the difference with the intestinal micro@@ bi@@ al of the mice had to do - the community of bacteria , viruses and fung@@ i that normally live in the g@@ astro@@ intestinal tract . &quot;
&quot; the intest@@ ines of the mice were sequ@@ enced DNA sequ@@ enced and there were found six bacterial species present in mice with the immune cells , but without them missing in mice . &quot;
mice were raised in a sterile environment so that they were missing an intestinal micro@@ bi@@ ome and they did not develop this type of immune cells and they received the L. Cross and immune cells .
&quot; in order to understand how the bacteria affected the immune system , the researchers of L. Cross Iber@@ ia grow in a liquid and then transferred small amounts of liquid - without the bacteria - on un@@ ripe immune cells isolated from the mice . &quot;
the immune cells developed to the toler@@ ant cells .
&quot; when the active component has been puri@@ fied out of the liquid , it proved to be a by @-@ product of tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han metabolism , known as an in@@ dol @-@ 3 lac@@ tic acid . &quot;
&quot; when the researchers doubled the amount of tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han in the feed of the mice , the number of such cells increased by around 50 percent , but when the tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han were hal@@ ved , the number of cells decreased by half . &quot;
&quot; Dr. Cer@@ v@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan stated that people have the same toler@@ ant cells like mice , and that most of us can protect L. reu@@ ter@@ i in our g@@ astro@@ intestinal tra@@ cts . &quot;
&quot; it is not known whether tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han @-@ by @-@ products from L. reu@@ ter@@ i develop the cells in humans as in mice , but defects in genes in relation to tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han were found in people with inflammatory bow@@ el disease . &quot;
&quot; she said , &quot; &quot; The development of these cells is probably something we want to promote as these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the intest@@ ine . &quot;
&quot; potentially , high tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han values in the presence of L. reu@@ ter@@ i can lead to an expansion of this population . &quot;
Jose M@@ our@@ in@@ ho believes that Manchester United with N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic has committed a genius
&quot; with N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic , Manchester United signed a &quot; genius , &quot; Jose M@@ our@@ in@@ ho believes after the middle field player had his debut against S@@ amp@@ d@@ oria on Wednesday evening . &quot;
&quot; the 40 million Po@@ und Sig@@ nature of Chelsea started with a 2 : 1 victory in Dublin , the final season game before the UEF@@ A Super Cup begins against Real Madrid on Tuesday and impressed in the holder role as people mar@@ ched like Paul Pog@@ ba and Andreas Per@@ eira . &quot;
&quot; however M@@ atic was excluded from the pre @-@ preparation Asia tour of the blues and made only 45 minutes , which M@@ our@@ in@@ ho admitted that he had to improve before the beginning of the Premier League season . &quot;
&quot; he needs time , but his experience , intelligence , genius in the way he thinks - he thinks football , &quot; said M@@ our@@ in@@ ho . &quot;
we will help him sooner than later .
&quot; besides M@@ atic , Victor Lin@@ del@@ and and Rom@@ el@@ u Lu@@ k@@ ak@@ u also started in the Avi@@ va stadium , when M@@ our@@ in@@ ho formed his start @-@ XI for the beginning of the season . &quot;
&quot; the Independent revealed that M@@ our@@ in@@ ho wished three more new commitments , but he insi@@ sted that the club has already done a &quot; fantastic job , &quot; three of its four primary new commitments . &quot;
&quot; three of four to get , I thank the club , &quot; he added . &quot;
&quot; I will be happ@@ ier if they get four of four for me , but they have great difficulty . &quot;
Bo@@ eing &quot; malt &quot; Dream@@ liner into the sky
the U.S. aircraft manufacturer Bo@@ eing has painted the sil@@ houette of a Dream@@ liner in the sky .
&quot; the pilots flew from Seattle to Washington State Washington , but the drawing began in Marqu@@ ette in U.S. state Michigan and moved in the form of a Dream@@ liner about the USA , that are several thousand kilometers . &quot;
the action lasted 18 hours and a minute .
on the radar screens the form of a Dream@@ liner was to be .
the whole was a endurance test for new engines .
Bo@@ eing had already made such an advertisement .
thus the number &quot; 7@@ 87 &quot; and the Bo@@ eing logo was painted in the sky .
&quot; new grav@@ estone for Martin Schulz - Hanover , we have a problem &quot;
&quot; as the wind rot@@ ates : when Sig@@ mar Gabriel was still SPD leader , social @-@ democratic prime ministers always looked after Berlin with a certain concern . &quot;
&quot; only no fire @-@ fire from the party headquarters , but no head@@ wind out of the covenant - so the most important desire of the election fighters . &quot;
&quot; since Martin Schulz leads the party , this has fundamentally changed . &quot;
&quot; since then , the employees from Willy @-@ Brandt @-@ Haus observe the events in the SPD @-@ governed state capitals . &quot;
what Schulz had gotten from there since the beginning of the year would not even be described in the approach with a head@@ wind .
there were excav@@ ations .
and one by one .
&quot; after the surprising end of the red @-@ green majority in Lower Saxony , the federal CD@@ U sees a general signal against the coalition of SPD and the Gre@@ ens . &quot;
&quot; this shows once more : red @-@ green can simply not be reliably ruled out , &quot; said CD@@ U Secretary General Peter Tau@@ ber the German editorial network ( R@@ ND ) . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the surprising fraction of a Green MEPs led the government of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) into a serious crisis . &quot;
&quot; five months before the election , his red @-@ green coalition with it lost its one @-@ voice majority to the opposition from CD@@ U and F@@ DP . &quot;
the Green German Managing Director Michael Kell@@ ner encouraged the back@@ sliding Lower Saxony @-@ Saxon Gre@@ ens El@@ ke T@@ west@@ erly to return her mandate .
the transition to the CD@@ U means a clear fal@@ si@@ fication of the elec@@ torate &apos;s welcome .
&quot; El@@ ke T@@ asse must immediately return her mandate , &quot; said the Federal Executive Director and Elec@@ toral Campa@@ ign of the Gre@@ ens to the German editorial network Deutschland ( R@@ ND ) . &quot;
&quot; this must not be true , however , &quot; si@@ gh@@ ing an SPD constitu@@ ency , when the new Job Message reached the party headquarters on Friday morning . &quot;
&quot; Stephan Wei@@ l , SPD &apos;s Prime Minister of Lower Saxony , is there after the transfer of the green MEPs El@@ ke T@@ west@@ to CD@@ U without their own government majority . &quot;
it is the provis@@ ional climax of a whole series of big and small crises in SPD state associations .
and nobody knows what comes next .
the Mis@@ er began with the un@@ expect@@ edly clear defeat at the Saarland election in March .
&quot; a blue eye , no more , the comrades reas@@ sured . &quot;
&quot; after the elections in Schleswig @-@ Holstein and North Rhine @-@ Westphalia , everything will be different . &quot;
it was then - and everything was considerably worse .
&quot; the defeat in Kiel brought the SPD to the &quot; &quot; Tau@@ ern &quot; , &quot; the Düsseldorf @-@ P@@ lei@@ te cleared the party smoothly . &quot;
&quot; the comrades , in the weeks thereafter , ra@@ ged again . &quot;
&quot; then , when they had just begun new courage , the G @-@ 20 summit came from Hamburg . &quot;
and with him came the next grav@@ estone .
&quot; mayor Olaf Sch@@ olz , the last strong SPD head of SPD , lost his Nim@@ bus on that weekend because he sat in the El@@ b@@ phil@@ harmon@@ ie , while his city was burning . &quot;
&quot; and because in the communication of crisis , so pretty much everything was wrong , what you can do wrong . &quot;
&quot; since then , Sch@@ olz is fighting for his political survival . &quot;
so now Stephan Wei@@ l .
&quot; because of the VW @-@ exhaust @-@ gas tank and its role in the Supervisory Board , the Lower Saxony Prime Minister has been in criticism for a long time . &quot;
mi@@ ese survey results were added .
&quot; nevertheless , or perhaps precisely because , in the past few weeks , Wei@@ l tried to put emphasis on setting acc@@ ents . &quot;
&quot; the endeav@@ our of the former mayor of Hanover to expand his power in Berlin , also remained hidden in the surroundings of Martin Schulz . &quot;
they let him grant him because they promised a stabili@@ zation of the party from Wei@@ l .
&quot; now , the exact opposite could occur . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , Wei@@ l finds no fault in the party @-@ internal compul@@ sion of the Lower Saxony Green Party . &quot;
and Schulz is not at all .
&quot; for one time , comrades try to keep their ranks closed . &quot;
&quot; their anger is directed to the Gre@@ ens , and here above all on the rebel@@ li@@ ous parliam@@ ent@@ ar@@ ist v@@ ests . &quot;
&quot; it is unbe@@ ar@@ able and democratic , as Mrs. T@@ ern@@ v@@ est puts their own career interests over the interests of all others , &quot; says Matthias M@@ ier@@ sch , head of the party left in the SPD Par@@ liam@@ entary Group , the editorial network Germany ( R@@ ND ) . &quot;
&quot; Mrs. T@@ ern@@ ess has not been elected as a direct candidate , but by the state list of the Lower Saxon Gre@@ ens in parliament , so the Lower Saxon MEP continues . &quot;
the logical consequence would be that she returns her mandate .
&quot; Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , head of the SPD Par@@ liam@@ entary Group , compl@@ ains about an &quot; un@@ democratic maneu@@ ver . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the voters &apos; wil@@ le four years ago was clear : people have made Stephan Wei@@ l as prime minister , &quot; &quot; says Op@@ per@@ mann , who leads the Lower Saxony SPD to the Bundestag election , the R@@ ND . &quot;
&quot; now the personal career presents a future CD@@ U de@@ pu@@ ties the election result , &quot; &quot; said Op@@ per@@ mann . &quot;
he requested to elu@@ ci@@ date the backgrounds .
I want to know if there was more or there were further commitments from the CD@@ U Lower Saxony .
funding fees for local nucle@@ us III
&quot; who wants to be able to rehab@@ ilit@@ ate his house in the years , can soon get assistance from the country . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Mayor Albert Sch@@ in@@ dler and three representative STE@@ G urban development on Wednesday were informed . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the information event , Sch@@ in@@ dler once again gave a review of what happened so far . &quot;
since 1991 it has been in sens@@ ational rehabilitation areas .
&quot; at that time , in the rehabilitation area I from 1991 to 2004 , the Land of Baden @-@ Württemberg took over two thirds of the sum total . &quot;
&quot; in the II from 2005 to 2016 , the allowance was still 60 percent . &quot;
&quot; for Sch@@ in@@ dler the previous renovation projects are a &quot; success project &quot; - it is important to promote interior development , and not only to open up new areas of construction . &quot;
&quot; on April 4 , the Government Pres@@ idency of Karlsruhe received the information that there will be a rehabilitation area III . &quot;
&quot; the sum amount 8@@ 33 333 Euros , of which 500,000 Euros are from the country , the rest of the community sens@@ ations . &quot;
how does a refurbis@@ hment area be created ?
&quot; I will continue to investigate as Sch@@ in@@ dler , where the &quot; &quot; really old &quot; &quot; houses are . &quot;
&quot; but it also plays a role , whether in the planned area of general interest , to rehab@@ ilit@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; if necessary , the regional borders could then shift again . &quot;
&quot; on Wednesday evening Martin Keller , Gab@@ y Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann and Sarah Got@@ zel . &quot;
&quot; the cellar presented the contents of the Federal State Programme &quot; Social Town , &quot; in which the renov@@ ations would then be carried out . &quot;
&quot; the core of the program is the re@@ vit@@ alization of inner cities , improving the living and working conditions and the preservation and expansion of the infrastructure . &quot;
&quot; the measures would be carried out object @-@ related , i.e. per plot . &quot;
the refurbis@@ hment area would then finally be set as a stat@@ ute .
&quot; since 1 January 2017 , the funding period for the funding is still running until 30 April 2026 . &quot;
&quot; until September of this year , however , the survey would be carried out once again , within the scope of which the parties involved in the rehabilitation sector get a questionn@@ aire for filling out . &quot;
&quot; in November or December , the order of the statutes should be carried out , so that in the coming year it is possible to begin with the renovation . &quot;
Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann subsequently stated that every Commun@@ e had to carry out the said preliminary investigations .
&quot; it is a matter of evaluating and deciding the urban ev@@ ils , and decide when to rehab@@ ilit@@ ate and to what extent . &quot;
for the respective property there is also a re@@ mark in the land register .
&quot; Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann will once again come to sens@@ ations and make a picture of the situation , she promised . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; this is why there will be questionn@@ aires , which will be sent to citizens in the coming weeks and will be filled until the end of the summer holidays . &quot;
&quot; the yellow Ques@@ tion@@ n@@ aire is the &quot; &quot; building and land arch &quot; , &quot; which is among other things the structural state and the restructuring views . &quot;
&quot; in the gray questionn@@ aire , the &quot; &quot; household and housing &quot; , &quot; information about size , division and occup@@ ants of a living room can be made . &quot;
&quot; the blue &quot; &quot; arc &quot; &quot; is to be filled only when operated in the building business premises . &quot;
&quot; however , not@@ with@@ standing , God pointed out that a filled questionn@@ aire is not at the same time an application for funding . &quot;
&quot; in addition , new construction measures are not eligible . &quot;
Sch@@ in@@ dler still emphas@@ ised that the distribution of the funds to the &quot; gre@@ y@@ ho@@ und principle &quot; - who first comes first h@@ orts first .
&quot; one could not reserve money for &quot; &quot; later &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; finally , photos of the project &quot; &quot; local centre II &quot; &quot; were shown to make the present a &quot; &quot; tasty &quot; &quot; renovation . &quot;
British invent@@ or sets himself a micro@@ chip to come up with a hand movement in house and car
&quot; a British invent@@ or is the first in the country equipped with a micro@@ chip to open his door , enter his office and even start his car with a hand movement . &quot;
&quot; Steven North@@ am , 33 , had im@@ planted the tiny chip between thumb and foref@@ inger and now offers the service for companies and individuals who want to simplify their lives with technology through its company Bio@@ Te@@ q . &quot;
&quot; he joined Dr. Ge@@ off Wat@@ son , a consulting an@@ aes@@ the@@ tist at the Royal H@@ amp@@ shire County Hospital in Win@@ chester , H@@ ants , to ensure that the implant procedure is carried out according to medical standards . &quot;
the technology resem@@ bles a cat and dogs im@@ planted micro@@ chip and lasts only 30 seconds .
&quot; the company of Mr. North@@ am wants to change the locks of houses and cars so that they are compatible with the chip , all for a surcharge of £ 300 per lock . &quot;
&quot; the married father of one now has both at home and in his BMW Z@@ 4 technology , which begins when his hand is at the wheel . &quot;
the advertising costs of the White House cost thousands of tax@@ pay@@ ers
&quot; the White House &apos;s decision to fly a marine helicop@@ ter to the South La@@ wn for an event , which highlighted American production last month , costs tax@@ pay@@ ers to the information of the military that were left to the TIME magazine up to $ 24@@ ,000 . &quot;
&quot; the green @-@ white Si@@ kor@@ sky V@@ H @-@ 3D , known as Marine One , when the president is on board , was the cent@@ re@@ piece of the event on 17 July at the White House with American construction programs . &quot;
&quot; President Donald Tr@@ ump , Vice President Mike P@@ ence and senior officials of the White House made a tour of all 50 states . &quot;
&quot; the helicop@@ ter made in Connec@@ tic@@ ut was exhibited beside a yacht from Ma@@ ine , a fire fighter car from Wis@@ cons@@ in and a for@@ kli@@ ft from Miss@@ issi@@ ppi . &quot;
&quot; the Military office of the White House demanded the presence of the helicop@@ ter in a frag@@ mentary order or Fra@@ go , barely 36 hours before the helicop@@ ter landed on the South La@@ wn , following the records of the Hel@@ icop@@ ter S@@ quad@@ ron One ( H@@ MX @-@ 1 ) , the unit responsible for the operation of the helicop@@ ter . &quot;
&quot; I just wanted you to be aware of it because it &apos;s such an unusual event with high visibility , &quot; the commander of the H@@ MX @-@ 1 , on the eve of the event , wrote his super@@ visor , the deputy nav@@ al commander for aviation . &quot;
&quot; the news showed that the helicop@@ ter arrived at the South La@@ wn on July 17 at 7 o &apos;clock in the morning , and so long remained until the lawn between 18 : 00 and 21 : 00 was ev@@ acu@@ ated this evening . &quot;
the note adds that if the departure from the White House should be delayed due to the limitation of the hours a second team would be required for the return flight .
&quot; the original flight crew was during the event with the helicop@@ ter , while the security personnel of the unit stayed on the ground during the time on the plane . &quot;
&quot; from the records provided by the TIME , it was not clear that a second flight was ultimately required . &quot;
the H@@ atch Act prohi@@ bits federal states to use state property for political purposes .
records indicate that H@@ MX @-@ 1 asked if the event could viol@@ ate the destiny .
&quot; a question we created was whether it was a violation of the H@@ atch acts and we were informed that this was not the case , &quot; the commander wrote . &quot;
&quot; sounds as if you are closed , &quot; said the Deputy Command@@ ant . &quot;
the &quot; Made in America &quot; event was called by the White House as an official event and would not be covered by the H@@ atch Act .
but also official events have political over@@ tones .
&quot; at the event , the president gave an imp@@ etus for the reform of the health reform that was going on in the Senate and he propag@@ ated the efforts to ins@@ ulate government regulations . &quot;
&quot; the use of the aircraft , known as Marine One or Air Force One , is hardly a new phenomenon for politically advantageous purposes . &quot;
President are obliged to use them for travel .
but demanding their use only for a photo OP is unusual .
&quot; in February Tr@@ ump resulted in an investigation when the presidential jet operated in front of the background of his first campaign rally in Melbourne , Florida , taxi services , and his Twitter account is full of messages that compl@@ ain about the use of the presidential jet by its predecessor . &quot;
&quot; the White House is delighted with the show &quot; &quot; Made In America &quot; &quot; - the products from all 50 states that are produced by American workers with American materials , &quot; said the Deputy Press secretary of the White House , Lind@@ say Wal@@ ters . &quot;
H@@ MX @-@ 1 crew frequently conduct training flights in the area around Washington and South La@@ wn to en@@ force US President in the White House with precise centimet@@ ers .
&quot; as Tr@@ ump in early July at the G@@ 20 summit in Germany , H@@ MX @-@ 1 performed 58 practice land@@ ings in the White House . &quot;
&quot; the flight for the &quot; &quot; Made in America &quot; &quot; event counted during the training needs of the flight crew for the month , said a civil servant . &quot;
helicop@@ ter units also flew 11 hours this day for &quot; non @-@ presidential support missions . &quot;
the White House said that tax@@ pay@@ ers took the burden for none of the other pro@@ ps presented at the event .
a spokes@@ man of Si@@ kor@@ sky said that the company was not involved to exhibit the helicop@@ ter on the South La@@ wn .
&quot; H@@ MX @-@ 1 does not have bud@@ get@@ ary records for the presidential flights , and it is difficult to determine the exact cost of the event . &quot;
&quot; according to St@@ und@@ ent@@ ari@@ fen of the U.S. Department of Defense for fiscal year 2017 , the Do@@ D reimbur@@ sement rate for the V@@ H @-@ 3D is 24,@@ 380 USD per flight hour . &quot;
records of the unit list the flight time of the aircraft as 30 minutes from the home base of the Marine Corps Air Fac@@ ility in Qu@@ an@@ tico in Virginia .
the White House ar@@ gues that the actual cost of operation of the helicop@@ ter is far below this rate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the cost of tax@@ pay@@ ers on the basis of estimates for reimbur@@ sement rates is highly mis@@ leading , &quot; &quot; said Wal@@ ters . &quot;
&quot; these estimates include staff , maintenance and many other hidden costs included in the annual funding . &quot;
&quot; according to a R@@ AND study from 2015 , reimbur@@ sement rates for Do@@ D do not include personnel costs , but also take into account the costs of fuel , maintenance and conclusion of the contract . &quot;
&quot; at that time , the former press spokes@@ man of the White House , Se@@ an Sp@@ ic@@ er , defended the use of helicop@@ ter for the event . &quot;
&quot; the idea is to present these week things that are produced in America , &quot; Sp@@ ic@@ er said . &quot;
&quot; and I know that Si@@ kor@@ sky and the state of Connec@@ tic@@ ut are very proud that they contribute to our national security , and I assume that hundreds if not even thousands of people depend on it . &quot;
&quot; and I think , like most Americans , we are all proud of the helicop@@ ter and other military equipment , for which so many Americans have worked ti@@ rel@@ ess@@ ly . &quot;
&quot; of course , it is appropriate to emphasize that . &quot;
&quot; it wasn &apos;t clear whether Tr@@ ump was inter@@ acting with the helicop@@ ter when he entered his tour across the South La@@ wn for the event , but he sat down in the driver &apos;s seat of a fire fighter car . &quot;
&quot; in the White House , Tr@@ ump addressed representatives of Si@@ kor@@ sky and j@@ oked with the media about his own fleet of company products . &quot;
&quot; I know Si@@ kor@@ sky very good , &quot; said the president , &quot; I have three of them . &quot;
TC BW Ne@@ uss in front of tri@@ cky task
runner @-@ up of the Second Tennis Bundes@@ liga joins the Table third su@@ chs@@ dorfer SV .
&quot; the TC Blue @-@ White Ne@@ uss takes place tomorrow from 11 a.m. in Kiel , at the Table third su@@ chs@@ dorfer SV . &quot;
&quot; despite the five games still fla@@ w@@ less balance , the leader of the Second Tennis Bundes@@ liga has received the sense of reality . &quot;
team Princip@@ al Mari@@ us Z@@ ay has respect for the opponent .
&quot; this is a compact team , always in quite similar formation . &quot;
especially on the rear positions I find the team very good . &quot;
&quot; for class and stability at the Su@@ chs@@ dorfer SV , especially the imports from the high north are concerned . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; their Dan@@ es and Finn@@ s can even refer to stak@@ es in the Davis Cup . &quot;
&quot; and they are also strong in dou@@ bles , &quot; says Z@@ ay with a view to Har@@ ri Hel@@ i@@ ov@@ a@@ ara ( Finland ) , Andr@@ e Gö@@ ran@@ sson ( Sweden ) , S@@ ör@@ en and Es@@ ben O@@ lesen , Martin Pe@@ der@@ sen and Andreas B@@ jer@@ rav@@ us ( all Denmark ) . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this will be difficult for us . &quot;
you also need a good portion of luck . &quot;
the Ne@@ us@@ ser crew for the trip to the high North is practically .
his debut for blue @-@ white could give Maxim@@ e Jan@@ vier .
&quot; at the moment , the Fren@@ ch@@ man Fren@@ ch@@ man Z@@ den@@ ek Kol@@ ar ( Czech Republic ) played at the tournament in the Czech Liber@@ ec in this season . &quot;
&quot; previously un@@ defeated Chil@@ ene Hans Pod@@ stran@@ nik @-@ Castillo , yesterday with the white rus@@ sian An@@ drei V@@ asi@@ lev@@ sky , was still at the ball at the AT@@ P tournament in K@@ itz@@ büh@@ el . &quot;
&quot; he should be in Kiel as well as Bot@@ ic Van de Z@@ and@@ schul@@ p , Niel@@ s Lo@@ ot@@ sm@@ a ( both Netherlands ) and Belgian Ju@@ lien C@@ agn@@ ina . &quot;
&quot; after his two vic@@ tories , last Sunday , against the club at the Al@@ ster , Má@@ t@@ é Val@@ kus@@ z could once again move into the team . &quot;
&quot; it is enough for the 18 @-@ year @-@ old Hungary , who was still number one of the Junior World Ran@@ king List in January 2016 , does not fill someone out of the coach around Mari@@ us Z@@ ay the Ka@@ der . &quot;
how America can harm O@@ MV
&quot; really happy Donald Tr@@ ump didn &apos;t work when , Wednesday evening , he put his signature under the law to intensi@@ fy sanctions against Russia . &quot;
&quot; in his ha@@ ste to en@@ act the law , &quot; the Congress gave a few &quot; constitutional provisions &quot; in it , et@@ ched it . &quot;
&quot; the reaction from Moscow was as sharp as expected , and even Brussels fo@@ amed the U.S. offensive . &quot;
&quot; after all , the draft plans to pun@@ ish European companies that help the Russians to build gas pi@@ pel@@ ines in the EU . &quot;
&quot; correspon@@ d@@ ingly , since then , investors have been co @-@ financed by domestic O@@ MV , which jointly with other European companies financed the construction of the Russian Baltic Sea Ins@@ ulation North Stream 2 . &quot;
the Dro@@ h@@ ul@@ isse is huge .
&quot; nevertheless , it is too early for an app@@ rais@@ al of the consequences , such as the official statement of the oil company . &quot;
&quot; in fact , Donald Tr@@ ump even had to raise the sanctions by an executive order . &quot;
twelve weapons are available to him .
&quot; the press &quot; has seen which the Group could rep@@ el , and which could really hurt him . &quot;
Nar@@ cos Season 3 Trailer : without Pablo Es@@ co@@ bar the Cal@@ i Cart@@ el is put into the center of Net@@ fli@@ x
&quot; despite the second season of Nar@@ cos , the Pablo Es@@ co@@ bars Killer un@@ vei@@ ls , the Net@@ fli@@ x series is not yet over . &quot;
&quot; the seasons three and four were already confirmed by streaming service , the first received their first trailer and showed the latest vil@@ la@@ ins of the show . &quot;
&quot; with the third season , the DE@@ A has directed their attention to the rich@@ est organization of drug traff@@ icking in the world : the Cal@@ i cart@@ el . &quot;
&quot; led by four powerful god@@ parents , they operate as a Fort@@ une 500 company only with more state bri@@ bes and violent actions . &quot;
&quot; Gil@@ berto Rodri@@ gu@@ ez Ore@@ ju@@ ela ( Dam@@ ian Al@@ c@@ az@@ ar ) is the leader of the Kart@@ ell , Miguel Rodri@@ gu@@ ez Ore@@ ju@@ ela ( Francisco Denis ) is her head , P@@ ach@@ o Herr@@ era ( Alberto Am@@ mann ) , and Ch@@ ep@@ e Sant@@ ac@@ ru@@ z London@@ o ( Pep@@ e Rap@@ az@@ ote ) is in New York . &quot;

role back@@ wards : the city represents 46 kitchen aids
the town organis@@ es the K@@ ita lun@@ ch@@ work itself again .
with fixed contact persons for the children and an assignment to the team .
&quot; in the urban day@@ care centres , the clock is turned back . &quot;
&quot; on 1 September , the city of Kre@@ feld takes over the food supply in the municipal kinder@@ garten facilities ( Kit@@ as ) back in its own reg@@ ains . &quot;
&quot; for Son@@ ja Pom@@ mer@@ anz , deputy head of the youth welfare department , this is a good news : &quot; &quot; we all were very pleased . &quot;
&quot; bo@@ iled is still out of house : a cat@@ erer takes over this task , and delivers fresh @-@ cooked ch@@ illed . &quot;
&quot; the town runs in the Kre@@ felder area 46 day@@ care centers , in 44 children get a hot meal at lunch time . &quot;
&quot; last year , 28@@ 00 children sat at the tables and the demand is growing steadily . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , not only children who are looked after 45 hours of the week , in the K@@ ita at noon , &quot; explains Pom@@ mer@@ anz . &quot;
the offer also applies in the 35 @-@ hour supervision when children stay until 2 pm .
&quot; 46 part @-@ time workers have food service from September 1st : they warm up the delivered meals , supplement them around salad , raw food and fruit , por@@ tioning the meal individually , give food out , clean up , rin@@ se and clean the kitchen . &quot;
&quot; the employees are assigned to a K@@ ita , &quot; says Pom@@ mer@@ anz . &quot;
the size - there are two groups as well as seven @-@ group facilities - decides over the course of the hour .
&quot; the kitchen hel@@ pers are now part of the K@@ ita team , &quot; Pom@@ mer@@ anz says . &quot;
&quot; so they are much more involved , and it is easier for kit@@ esur@@ fing to implement ped@@ agog@@ ical concepts . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , it is also about healthy eating and cooking . &quot;
children should help prepare food .
the direct connection of the kitchen force to the team is advisable .
also for the children .
&quot; they have a well @-@ known force in the K@@ ita , a person familiar to them , and not constantly changing people . &quot;
this continuity is important for children .
the pur@@ ge of the K@@ ita rooms - until now also the task of the kitchen staff - will be done by special cleaning personnel in the future .
&quot; this variation - the separation of cleaning and kitchen service - has also the charm that it has turned out in the cost comparison between owner and foreign award for the city as the most economical , it is from the press office . &quot;
&quot; and that , although 46 part @-@ time forces are rest@@ art@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; but these hours are not so strong at around 750 people in the educational sector , &quot; says Son@@ ja Pom@@ mer@@ anz . &quot;
&quot; Afgh@@ an democracy depends on the political role of women , says the UN &quot;
&quot; elections can only be representative if all members of society , including women , play a role , said the chief of the UN mission in Afghanistan on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; Nicholas Hay@@ som , Chairman of the United Nations Mission , said that hundreds of women are chann@@ elled to the provinces . three women are elected for the role of vice @-@ president and more than 30 percent of newly registered voters are women . &quot;
&quot; the role of women cannot be over@@ estimated , &quot; he said on Wednesday in a statement . &quot;
elections can only be representative and credi@@ ble if women are fully eligible and included in all parts of the election process .
Afgh@@ an elections for the provincial council and the presidential elections will take place on 5 April .
Taliban have published threats against a choice process that coinci@@ de with the transition of international combat operations to an advisory role .
&quot; this year , the elections for the first time will hand over the power peac@@ efully from a democr@@ atically elected government to the next . &quot;
&quot; said Hay@@ som , a strong role for women to strengthen the democratic success of Afghanistan . &quot;
the Afgh@@ an Independent Elec@@ toral Commission reports that 1.2 million women registered by registered 3.6 million voters .

G@@ MB concerns about investments in the Mc@@ Vi@@ tie factory in Glasgow
a union would like to become a member of managers of the bis@@ cuit manufacturer Mc@@ Vi@@ tie about the long @-@ term commitment to production in their factory in Glasgow .
G@@ MB Scotland said the company kept silent about the future of investments at the T@@ oll@@ cross location .
&quot; more than 500 employees work in the plant , which produces along with other products hob@@ no@@ bs and rich tea cookies . &quot;
Mc@@ Vi@@ ties owner Pla@@ dis said he has invested more than 5 million pounds in recent years .
&quot; he added that employees and trade union representatives would be &quot; &quot; first experienced &quot; &quot; if their activities would change . &quot;
&quot; in a letter to the branch manager of the company , G@@ MB Scotland Mc@@ Vi@@ tie called on &quot; &quot; concerns that the financing for the modernis@@ ation of production lines is not being pushed forward . &quot;
&quot; G@@ MB @-@ Senior @-@ Organis@@ ator Dre@@ w Du@@ ffy , said : &quot; &quot; the fact that from the General Site Manager we can gain no clarity about the needs and investment plans for the future of T@@ oll@@ cross , our members are deeply concerned . &quot;
&quot; generations of families have worked here and the workers focus strongly on the local community and Glasgow , an important pillar for decent employment in an area with high unemployment and social dis@@ advantage . &quot;
&quot; therefore , under the perspective of jobs , wage and prosperity , and against the background of the Bre@@ x@@ it , the rising cost of living and the chronic production decline , the eastern end of Glasgow is urgent a thri@@ ving production presence at Mc@@ Vi@@ tie . &quot;
&quot; a spokes@@ person from Pla@@ dis said : &quot; &quot; the branch manager at T@@ oll@@ cross received a letter from G@@ MB Scotland yesterday , and the company will respond directly to this because we appreciate the ongoing commitment to employees and trade union representatives . &quot;
&quot; two months ago , we had a regular meeting with employees and G@@ MB representatives at T@@ oll@@ cross where some questions were openly discussed . &quot;
&quot; we discussed with the employees that we are working like all companies operating in an extremely competitive and uncertain economic climate , constantly checking our business - and that applies to all our business areas and locations - to remain competitive . &quot;
&quot; she added : &quot; in recent years we have invested more than 5 million pounds in our T@@ oll@@ cross location , especially in production lines and operational improvements . &quot;
&quot; we recognise the heritage of T@@ oll@@ cross as a production facility . if our operations change at the site , the employees and their union representatives will be the first to experience this . &quot;
did the PSG Barcelona warn of N@@ ey@@ mar three years ago ?
the page of La Liga may regret your interest in Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti
&quot; in their persecution of N@@ ey@@ mar , Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main will not leave after they issued an offer of £ 189 million to dis@@ solve its release clause , but did they have warned Barcelona three years before the world record ? &quot;
&quot; the sens@@ ational approach has heated the transfer window in summer , because the Lig@@ ue 1 Club is ready to break the world record by more than the double of the previous brand , with Paul Pog@@ ba returned last season for 89 million pounds to Manchester United . &quot;
&quot; after completion , N@@ ey@@ mar becomes the most expensive player in the world and the highest paid professional ath@@ l@@ ete in the world . PSG holds wages of over 500,000 GBP per week . &quot;
&quot; Barcelona is fur@@ ious about the way N@@ ey@@ mar has en@@ forced its way out , although a source near the Catal@@ ans Board insi@@ sts that the club always has its best to take care of him since his arrival from San@@ tos in 2013 . &quot;
but was the football world warned three years ago by the PSG president before this prospect ?
&quot; when Manchester City was interested in signing Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i , N@@ asser Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi had a strict warning for each club that wanted to sign one of the best players in PSG . &quot;
&quot; I am not worried because they know that when they touch one of our players , then we will be in opposition to them , we will contact their players , &quot; said Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi . &quot;
&quot; we respect all clubs .
&quot; but if they try to sign one of our players with them , this will have consequences . &quot;
&quot; Barcelona seems to have crossed this line , with the Spanish association beginning to express interest in the PSG @-@ Mittel@@ feld@@ spieler Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti in the beginning of this summer . &quot;
&quot; he made it clear that they would not allow the International from Italy under any circumstances , and Barcelona could feel the consequences of this interest by losing one of their price offerings for N@@ ey@@ mar . &quot;
sco@@ oter revers@@ ed and damaged
&quot; in the night of Friday on Saturday , an unknown offen@@ ders have deliberately removed a sco@@ oter in the Königs@@ felder street in front of the property number 30 , and so on the fair@@ ing of the vehicle &apos;s property damage of more than 200 Euro . &quot;

&quot; for an accident on the B 215 between Stol@@ zen@@ au and Le@@ ese , the police are looking for witnesses . &quot;
&quot; because he got a car in his lane , the driver had to do@@ dge a VW Tour@@ an and touched the guard . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday evening , the 34 @-@ year @-@ old from Reh@@ burg @-@ Lo@@ cc@@ um , with his VW at 19.@@ 55 o &apos;clock , was on the B 215 from Stol@@ zen@@ au towards Le@@ ese . &quot;
&quot; in the area of the city dwell@@ ings of Stol@@ zen@@ au , a car came to meet him in his lane , so that he had to do@@ dge to the right . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , the tour operator touched the Leit@@ plann@@ er . &quot;
&quot; at the passenger car , Sach@@ harm was created . &quot;
&quot; the driver of the opposite passenger car , a Mercedes Benz , had over@@ taken a truck and continued his journey without taking care of the traffic accident . &quot;
&quot; according to the accident damaged , it may well be that the accident driver had not noticed the accident . &quot;
&quot; the police now asks witnesses of the incident as well as the driver of the cause , to contact the comm@@ iss@@ ariat in Stol@@ zen@@ au under tel . 0@@ 57@@ 61 / 9@@ 20@@ 60 . &quot;
&quot; interview : &quot; &quot; Dom@@ sp@@ atzen &quot; &quot; report reli@@ eves Pope @-@ Brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger &quot;
the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen report on the abuse of abuse was reli@@ eved by the Pope @-@ Brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
this means the author and historian Michael Hes@@ emann .
the final report on the mis@@ use sc@@ andal at the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen continues for discussions .
&quot; Christian Wei@@ sn@@ der , spokes@@ man of the reform movement &quot; We are Church , &quot; stated after publication in front of the Deutsche Presse @-@ Agentur , he was waiting for the former Reg@@ ens@@ burger Bishop and present @-@ day Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller as well as from the cathedral kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , the 93 @-@ year @-@ old brother of the em@@ eri@@ fied Pope Benedi@@ ct XVI , an ap@@ ology . &quot;
&quot; it would greatly serve the pres@@ tige of the Catholic Church , if Müller and R@@ atz@@ inger would express their deep regret about their own om@@ issions or their then false assessment of the processes . &quot;
&quot; the Vatican newspaper &quot; Os@@ serv@@ atore Rom@@ ano , &quot; on the other hand , critici@@ zed that in reporting about violence at the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen with &quot; &quot; two measures &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; with regard to the attacks in Regensburg , no one doub@@ ted that it was &quot; sham@@ eful and sham@@ eful acts &quot; that would have to be punished and prevented in the future ; however , the author Luc@@ etta Scar@@ aff@@ ia , historian and member of the National Italian Bio@@ ethics Committee . &quot;
&quot; the habit of calling the Catholic Church as a source of all evil , is already part of the everyday experience and prepar@@ es public opinion to keep it normal , &quot; says Scar@@ aff@@ ia . &quot;
&quot; pr@@ incess Gl@@ oria von Th@@ urn und Ta@@ xis said in the interview with Bay@@ er@@ ischer Rundfunk : &quot; &quot; we would like to go to the church and this is a fin@@ ite fres@@ her . &quot;
&quot; she also pointed out that in her youth &quot; &quot; bats had been a very normal ped@@ agog@@ ical means &quot; , &quot; to cope with che@@ ek@@ y children , as I was one . &quot;
&quot; it is unfair to apply today &apos;s standards for past decades , as the world has changed . &quot;
&quot; in connection with the reports on abuse of abuse , pop@@ e @-@ brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger often appeared . &quot;
&quot; completely wrong , author and historian Michael Hes@@ emann , who wrote the reminder band &quot; My brother of the Pope &quot; ( translated into 12 languages ) . &quot;
&quot; I have to take protection from Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , &quot; &quot; says Hes@@ emann , &quot; &quot; for all this had nothing to do with him , &quot; &quot; he evalu@@ ates the results of the final report . &quot;
what exactly is written in the 440 @-@ page report written by the B@@ ist@@ um Regensburg with the En@@ lighten@@ ment lawyer Ulrich Weber ?
&quot; a total of 547 Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen were ab@@ used between 1945 and the early 1990s , &quot; offering high plau@@ sibility &quot; victims of attacks , 67 dome @-@ cats sex@@ ually ab@@ used . &quot;
&quot; in the final report , it is said to Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , who worked in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994 : &quot; in summary , it can be noted that by Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister R. , in many cases , forms of physical and psychological violence have been applied . &quot;
&quot; especially with high emotional levels , the punishment for the students was even more violent . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , unlike many other accused , many victims under@@ estimated the general humanity of R. and therefore , in many cases , even have positive memories with him in many cases . &quot;
&quot; in the interview , Hes@@ emann explains why the final report about the abuse sc@@ andal at the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen Georg R@@ atz@@ inger was reli@@ eved in his opinion . &quot;
&quot; Mr. Hes@@ emann , the 440 @-@ page report on the &quot; In@@ ci@@ dents of Violence Against Prevention at the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen &quot; gives a contradic@@ tory picture of Georg R@@ atz@@ inger &apos;s cathedral @-@ master master . &quot;
&quot; for one , many students highlight his &quot; humanity . &quot; &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , it also appears as a chol@@ eric and perfec@@ tion@@ ist , which was handy when a domain kit had no top performance musi@@ cally . &quot;
how do you evaluate this final report as his bi@@ ographer ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : if you make the effort and read the entire 440 pages long report from the front to the back , you have to ask yourself why the name Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is in it at all . &quot;
&quot; he has just eight pages dedicated to him , and he is clearly acqu@@ itted of any suspic@@ ion of complic@@ ity or complic@@ ity in the terrible cases of sexual abuse . &quot;
the exc@@ esses of violence at the pre @-@ school also occurred outside of its sphere of sphere .
&quot; at best , it is possible to repro@@ ach him too late or not to have taken first hints serious enough . &quot;
&quot; the Dom@@ sp@@ atz@@ eng@@ y@@ mn@@ asi@@ um , on which he worked , was felt by practically all respon@@ dents than - literally - &quot; redemption , &quot; &quot; heaven &quot; and &quot; better world . &quot; &quot;
&quot; thus also the broad majority of his students Georg R@@ atz@@ inger provides an excellent testimony , &quot; &quot; sincere , &quot; &quot; &quot; sincere , &quot; &quot; sincere , &quot; &quot; sincere , &quot; &quot; competent and &quot; understanding , &quot; who provided the boys regularly with cakes , bis@@ cuits and cand@@ y and &quot; always enc@@ amped by the grapes of children . &quot; &quot;
&quot; only a minority compl@@ ains about his perfec@@ tion@@ ism and his great emotion@@ ality , which also led to flood erup@@ tions . &quot;
&quot; that he did not only kne@@ ad with chairs and threw the key on the ground , but also par@@ ted ear@@ ses@@ es and too che@@ ered guys on the hair or ears , he himself had been deeply regre@@ t@@ ted and ap@@ ologi@@ zed for this . &quot;
&quot; however , it must be said that such educational methods were widespread in the question@@ able time , the 1960s and 1970s , with parents and teachers . &quot;
do you also know such breeding methods ?
&quot; of course , I think everyone of us who was born before 1968 . &quot;
&quot; I also experienced this in a secular school , a state high school . &quot;
&quot; compared to what is actually happening in this report , namely the horri@@ ble sexual abuse and violence of violence at the pre @-@ school , it is certainly Bag@@ at@@ elles . &quot;
&quot; there is already a question of whether it is not more of his famili@@ arity and role as a brother of Benedi@@ ct XVI to do , that many media just fell on him . &quot;
&quot; at the Bavarian pop@@ e , many people who have never understood him are still working eag@@ erly . &quot;
but the truth is : the report is reli@@ eved Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in every respect !
&quot; in the context of the report , the media was reported very much about the issue of abuse at the Regensburg domain pads . &quot;
will Georg R@@ atz@@ inger put in the final report any involvement or complic@@ ity with regard to sexual abuse ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : clearly no .
not one of the 67 victims of sexual assault claims to have entrusted the Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister .
not even the parents were inaugurated .
&quot; I never dar@@ ed to talk to my father or mother about it , &quot; &quot; said an affected representative for the others , &quot; &quot; It was all very embarrass@@ ing to me . &quot;
the real problem in the education of sexual abuse was and is that most victims are silent .
&quot; if they don &apos;t even trust parents and si@@ bl@@ ings , then certainly not a choir director , who would have been a colleague of the perpetr@@ ators in a professional way . &quot;
what is the opinion of the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen student R@@ atz@@ inger &apos;s role in terms of abuse of abuse ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : a question@@ able student formulated it so : &quot; regarding sexual abuse ... I see ... no case in which he ( Georg R@@ atz@@ inger ) had had timely findings and could have stopped the respective perpetr@@ ator .
&quot; I think it ... also for really absurd , to assume that out of it ... Bu@@ ben more forc@@ eful or clear@@ er or even more open than against their parents , dor@@ mit@@ ories , trust teachers , etc . &quot;
that you talk to him about sex ... - un@@ think@@ able . &quot;
&quot; in this way , the report conclu@@ des with the very clear result : &quot; that the student and / or their surroundings were entrusted to him in advance , could not be confirmed in the course of the study . &quot;
&quot; as far as sexual abuse is concerned , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is thus free of any co @-@ existence . &quot;
&quot; in such a way , he cannot be accused of preventing or having brought him to the ad . &quot;
&quot; therefore there is no reason to associate his good name with these contradic@@ tory crimes , as unfortunately it happened in some cases . &quot;
&quot; in the media , much of &quot; &quot; violence &quot; &quot; was to be read at the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen . &quot;
&quot; the former cathedral kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is accused of &quot; &quot; leaving &quot; &quot; in the report . &quot;
must he live with this accus@@ ation ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : that &apos;s the big problem in reporting everything mixed and mixed up to a huge reporting of sexual abuse and violence and somewhere , in the middle of it , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger . &quot;
but this is precisely the case of mis@@ use of the report .
&quot; in fact , it is clean divided : between the pre @-@ school and the gymn@@ asi@@ um of the dome @-@ cats , between sexual abuse and violence and , we say once , other alleg@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the report covers incidents from the period since 1945 , so also from four decades , in which Georg R@@ atz@@ inger was not choir leader of the cathedral sp@@ atzen . &quot;
&quot; the horri@@ ble test ped@@ agog@@ y , the cases where boys from sa@@ di@@ stic teachers were cur@@ ated and mal@@ igned and suffered from them , all occurred at the pre @-@ school in Et@@ ter@@ z@@ hausen and P@@ iel@@ en@@ ho@@ fen , where really sc@@ andal@@ ous conditions . &quot;
&quot; but with those who had Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger nothing to do , because he got the boys to face when they were already at the Dom@@ sp@@ atz@@ eng@@ y@@ mn@@ asi@@ um . &quot;
&quot; on the one hand , as most of the witnesses emphas@@ ise , the topic &quot; Preschool &quot; t@@ abo@@ o . &quot;
&quot; one was only happy to be able to escape and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even &quot; &quot; heavenly &quot; &quot; states . &quot;
what was different at the Dom@@ sp@@ atz@@ eng@@ y@@ mn@@ asi@@ um ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : there was discipline , but no sa@@ di@@ stic violence . &quot;
&quot; and this also applies to Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , where the report conclu@@ des that &quot; many victims have appreciated the general humanity of R. and therefore , in many cases , even combine positive memories with him in many cases . &quot;
&quot; at most , the blame remains to have looked away . &quot;
&quot; however , despite all efforts , the report could only define two periods in which it was reported by the states at the pre @-@ school . &quot;
&quot; the first time in 1970 / 71 , when he began to establish himself and from the processes at a school where he was not working and responsible , ( so the witness ) didn &apos;t want to hear anything , and then only back in 1993 . &quot;
does Georg R@@ atz@@ inger consistently close the ears before the states ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : no , because already in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the Dom@@ sp@@ atz@@ eng@@ y@@ mn@@ asi@@ um , which the report even re@@ produced . &quot;
&quot; in this he points out this , &quot; &quot; that in the pre @-@ school , the punishment will continue to be practiced . &quot;
&quot; in view of the danger of negative press releases , he recommended urgent action . &quot;
&quot; that was , of course , at a time when legal clarity existed , as test pen@@ alties in Bavaria were long ago banned . &quot;
&quot; before that , they occurred in a legal gray area , as each of us still knows . &quot;
it was difficult for him to estimate where the affected were perhaps exagger@@ ated or dram@@ ati@@ sed and where really the per@@ missible limit was exceeded .
&quot; but you can &apos;t say , he always looked away . &quot;
that &apos;s just right .
&quot; only in 1980 , the re@@ trial of schools was officially abol@@ ished in Bavaria . &quot;
&quot; pr@@ incess Gl@@ oria von Th@@ urn und Ta@@ xis claimed , it is unfair to apply today &apos;s ped@@ agog@@ ical standards for the time of time . &quot;
how do you see that ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : we are talking about the &quot; trap of An@@ ach@@ ron@@ ism , &quot; i.e. the danger posed by the present moral standards . &quot;

&quot; but this is of course not true for sexual abuse , which was ab@@ om@@ in@@ able at all times , and not for what was hiding in the pre @-@ school of resist@@ ances and violence against innocent child souls , that goes far beyond that then . &quot;
this is all aw@@ ful and I am glad that it is finally up @-@ to @-@ date .
but at the same time I must protect Georg R@@ atz@@ inger because all this had nothing to do with him .
&quot; his means of discipl@@ ining and punishment , so to draw ear , and to the hair and ears , were widespread in the 1970s . &quot;
&quot; when physical punishment was then banned , he also kept strictly adher@@ ed to . &quot;
&quot; which picture of his Regensburg time has Georg R@@ atz@@ inger returned in talks with you for the book &quot; &quot; My Brother of the Pope &quot; &quot; ? &quot;
did the subject of the test also come to speech ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : well , in the book it &apos;s about the life of his brother Joseph , i.e. Pope Benedi@@ ct XVI , tells from his perspective , as the cathedral pads only played a minor role . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , I don &apos;t know that he led a strict reg@@ iment there . &quot;
&quot; even this must be said once : without this perfec@@ tion@@ ism , without the un@@ conditional discipline , it would hardly have been possible for him to form an institution of world tran@@ g , the true cultural ambassador of Europe and his musical tradition , which went on tour twice in the USA ( 1983 and 1987 ) and Japan ( 1988 and 1991 ) . &quot;
&quot; with bis@@ cuits and bon@@ b@@ ons alone , you do not only make any big voc@@ alists and before every success , just in what area , but always discipline , passion and self @-@ over@@ riding . &quot;
what kind of man did you experience Georg R@@ atz@@ inger during the conversations with her book ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : through the work on the book and beyond that , I met Georg R@@ atz@@ inger very well and again and again experienced as wonderful , hum@@ orous , basic , deeply faithful and cor@@ dial people , from which one can &apos;t imagine that he could do anything but a fly . &quot;
&quot; I come regularly with how many former Dom@@ sp@@ atzen are still today , 23 years after his embar@@ go , regularly contact him to visit him - he is almost blind - and treat him like a member of her family . &quot;
&quot; those who have not for@@ given him until now , that he once was stern to them , are thus clearly in the minority . &quot;
most of the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen are thank@@ ful to him today that he enriched her life and taught them the world of music .
&quot; and that he is always a good , pat@@ ernal teacher - a strict father , certainly , that may be - but also a lovely resp@@ ect@@ ress , to which she is still looking at today and which they almost worship . &quot;
&quot; and please , once again clearly : all that you submit to him are educational methods that were on the agenda at that time . &quot;
we can be glad that we have long since overcome this time .
&quot; but it is most un@@ just , a man , just because he is prominent and has an even more prominent brother to make the medi@@ al sc@@ ap@@ ego@@ at . &quot;
&quot; there is the evil intent behind it , only too obvious . &quot;
&quot; for the report , which was just published , reli@@ eves him . &quot;
&quot; now it would be the state of affairs , a 93 @-@ year @-@ old man who has acquired great mer@@ its and without the outside of Bavaria and perhaps Germany , nobody would probably know the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen , finally in peace . &quot;
