<seg id="1">Munich 1856: four maps that change your view of the city</seg>
<seg id="2">"an Irren-Anstalt, where youths should meet today."</seg>
<seg id="3">"a crypt chapel, where it is now excavated for the S-Bahn tunnels."</seg>
<seg id="4">Kleingärtner manage the former cause of farmers.</seg>
<seg id="5">The oldest official card of Munich supports exciting stories for days.</seg>
<seg id="6">It gets nervous if maps are not up-to-date.</seg>
<seg id="7">"everybody knows everybody who had to be exciting, because the car-Navi took place in a green meadow instead of a bypass road."</seg>
<seg id="8">"the historical maps of the digital Bayern-Atlas, an offer of the Geoportal Bavaria of the state government, are anything but up-to-date - but therefore very revealing."</seg>
<seg id="9">Especially if you compare them with current online maps.</seg>
<seg id="10">Then it becomes clear how cities and communities have changed in the spread-area of the Munich Merkur since the 19th century.</seg>
<seg id="11">"the digital Bayern-Atlas is a patchwork carpet, which is not recognized as such."</seg>
<seg id="12">"in the large picture postcard, more detailed maps, so-called" "Urposibilities", "were incorporated for cities and congregations."</seg>
<seg id="13">"according to the Bayerischer junction, these were created between 1810 and 1864 and originate from Bavaria's first surveying."</seg>
<seg id="14">Your client: Napoleon.</seg>
<seg id="15">"since the spring of 1800, the French army leader occupied Bavaria during the Second Coalition War with Austria."</seg>
<seg id="16">Napoleon wanted an overview of the occupied country and gave a topographical survey of Bavaria within order - of course for military purposes.</seg>
<seg id="17">"even if the French troops finally departed with the peace of Lunéville on February 9, 1801: today's neighbors, who created the idea of an area-wide Bavaria card."</seg>
<seg id="18">"Elector Max IV. Joseph drove the project forward, founded the" Topographic Bureau "- and thus the Bavarian Surveying Management."</seg>
<seg id="19">The original composition for Munich dates back to 1856 and is like all other on the website of the Bavarian State Library.</seg>
<seg id="20">The comparison of earlier / today is the most impressive example of the state capital.</seg>
<seg id="21">The city has expanded in all directions and has grown together.</seg>
<seg id="22">"one example of this is Untersendling, which appears relatively isolated in the map of 1856."</seg>
<seg id="23">"Sendling was founded 21 years after the creation of the map, so 1877, as a Munich district."</seg>
<seg id="24">Today Untersendling is located in the middle of the city.</seg>
<seg id="25">"the houses of Untersendlings focus around 1856 along the present Plinganserstrasse, which was named after George Sebastian Plinganser in 1878, a leader of the insurgency of the Bavarian peasants against Austria in 1705."</seg>
<seg id="26">"where today the Westpark is, one sees nothing but fields - at first glance: when zooming a smaller card with dozens of lines and numbers appears: handwritten numbered flutes from the so-called" "uranium" "from which the land tax was deduced."</seg>
<seg id="27">"small plots there are no farmers there today - but small gardeners of the plant" "Land in Sonne". ""</seg>
<seg id="28">A large green area is located north of Untersendling.</seg>
<seg id="29">"Theresienwiese, since 1810 scene of the October test, was in fact a meadow in the 19th century - and no concrete desert."</seg>
<seg id="30">On the other side of the Isar the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiatric medicine.</seg>
<seg id="31">"in the area of today's district Au-Haidhausen, one reads not only the street name" "at Gasteig" "or from the height" "On the air" "- but also in large letters" "Irren Anstalt". ""</seg>
<seg id="32">"yes, here at Auerfeldstraße one once locked people with madness."</seg>
<seg id="33">"there was 1858 / 59 the Munich circle-irrigation system" Auf der Auer Lüfte "(" "Auer Lüfte" ")."</seg>
<seg id="34">"from 1872, Dr. Bernhard von Gudden has led the establishment of the psychiatrist who is brought to the death of King Ludwig II in connection with the death of King Ludwig II."</seg>
<seg id="35">"he was advanced for his time and, for example, ended the accusations of the so-called Irish."</seg>
<seg id="36">"he also instructed the staff to use force against the occupants," says Hermann Wilhelm, head of the Haidhausen Museum, who occupied an exhibition with the institution. "</seg>
<seg id="37">"for 280 patients was first place, later it was extended to 500 places."</seg>
<seg id="38">"at some point, this capacity was no longer sufficient - the reason for the construction of the Kreisirrensplatz in hair 1905."</seg>
<seg id="39">"since 2006, the Isar-Amper-Klinikum Munich-Ost, one of Germany's largest psychiatrists."</seg>
<seg id="40">"on the area of the former Auer Anstalt, young people now meet at the Salesianum in Munich."</seg>
<seg id="41">The Order warmed the building complex in 1920 and converted it into a youth home with trainees.</seg>
<seg id="42">"West is the football field of the TSV Munich east, east of residential buildings from the 1980s."</seg>
<seg id="43">"in 2015 the children's house" "Casa Don Bosco" "was built in an architectural style reminiscent of the origins of the Irrensplatz, which had been destroyed during the Second World War in bombing attacks."</seg>
<seg id="44">"the Marienplatz was listed as" "main square" "in 1856, the Kaufingerstraße was called" Kaufinger alley. ""</seg>
<seg id="45">The Second World War also brought a decisive change in the heart of Munich.</seg>
<seg id="46">The Allies seized many holes in the city centre in December 1944.</seg>
<seg id="47">A big stayed until today - at the Marienhof.</seg>
<seg id="48">"the English Institute, small business houses and a crypt from the Middle Ages were once at the Marienhof where these days were the preliminary work and on April 5, 2017 the groundbreaking ceremony for the second S-Bahn clan."</seg>
<seg id="49">"with the slider, the old Munich-card can be compared with the aerial view of today - and fill the hole at the Marienhof."</seg>
<seg id="50">Civil rights group publishes travel warning for Missouri</seg>
<seg id="51">The National Association for the Promotion of Colours has issued a warning for coloured people who travel to Missouri due to discriminatory politics and racist attacks.</seg>
<seg id="52">"the NAACP Travel Advisory for the Federal State of Missouri, which is to enter into force until 28 August 2017, calls for afro-American travelers, visitors and Missourians to take special attention while travelling through the state, as a series of questionable, rapid-based incidents in recent times exist throughout the state and be noted here," says it in the opinion of the group. "</seg>
<seg id="53">"a recently adopted Act of Missouri that makes people more difficult to win discriminatory deposits, as well as the law enforcement agencies of the state that disproportionate to minorities, prompted the group to issue travel warning, said the NAACP."</seg>
<seg id="54">They have breaches of civil rights that happen to people.</seg>
<seg id="55">"they are stopped because of their skin color, they are beaten or killed," "said the president of the Missouri NAACP, Rod Chapel, the Kansas City Star."</seg>
<seg id="56">We hear discomfort in such a frequency that we haven't heard yet.</seg>
<seg id="57">It is the first such warning issued by the Organization for a State in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="58">"the group cited incidents such as racist crime against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, 28, a black man from Tennessee."</seg>
<seg id="59">"Sanders died under questionable circumstances at the beginning of the year after he had no more fuel during the trip and was taken into custody by the police of Missouri, without being accused of a crime."</seg>
<seg id="60">"the Council also points out a recent report by the Missouri General Public Prosecutor's Office, which is shown that black drivers in the state are held 75 percent more frequently than whites."</seg>
<seg id="61">"the recommendation is that people are aware and inform their families, friends and staff about what might happen in Missouri," "said Chapel."</seg>
<seg id="62">People need to be ready to bring the money or let their relatives know that they travel through the state.</seg>
<seg id="63">"Missouri recorded 100 hate crimes in 2015, according to the latest figures from the FBI's hate crime report, which ranks the state with regard to the number of such injuries to the 16th position of the country."</seg>
<seg id="64">The travel alert is also an answer to a new Missouri law that would make it harder to accuse a company because of housing or employment discrimination.</seg>
<seg id="65">"prior to that, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) had issued travel warnings for Texas and Arizona, after the States forced immigration laws to arrest people for immigration violations, which will contribute to further racial profiling in view of ACLU."</seg>
<seg id="66">"travel warnings are usually issued by the State Department for other countries, but lately, interest groups have used the measure as a response to certain laws and trends within the United States."</seg>
<seg id="67">Fence project is elementary</seg>
<seg id="68">The Fischerbacher Weidezaun project is a success project and will be continued next year.</seg>
<seg id="69">The CDU Bundestag members Peter Weiß and Kordula Kovac got a picture on site.</seg>
<seg id="70">"at the court yard of the Schwendemann family, representatives of the Fischerbacher CDU local association met with mayor Thomas Schneider and the two deputies."</seg>
<seg id="71">"Markus Schwendemann first gave an insight into his farm in which he cultivated 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest, 40 dairy cows and as many young animals and accomodate in five apartments Ferienges."</seg>
<seg id="72">"the" "Black Forest" "is for him the alternative marketing path for the milk of his cows, so Schwendemann."</seg>
<seg id="73">On the table of the holiday house is exclusively regional.</seg>
<seg id="74">"as he is also BLHV chairman of Fischerbach, he described the fence project as" elementary important. ""</seg>
<seg id="75">I cannot profitable on such steep faces.</seg>
<seg id="76">"the grassland area care for a lot of work, much needed to be worked with the brushcutter."</seg>
<seg id="77">"we have to fight with the conditions and the topography," said Schwendemann. "</seg>
<seg id="78">"in 2003, he took over the eleventh operation and managed it without chemical plant protection and fertilizer, even if it does not lead to biofuel."</seg>
<seg id="79">"for mayor Thomas Schneider, it was clear:" the Commune recognized the importance of the fence project and is happy about the leader promotion. "</seg>
<seg id="80">"at the cost of 3,000 to 4,000 euros per hectare the farmers would have to be supported."</seg>
<seg id="81">I hope that the reforestation of the areas could be drawn up for quite a while.</seg>
<seg id="82">"the greatest treasure that we have is the people who work in agriculture and make thoughts about how they continue their operations," "said the mayor."</seg>
<seg id="83">Farmers are often in criticism because of the promotion</seg>
<seg id="84">"in 2013, a total of 25 plots of eleven participants were fenced."</seg>
<seg id="85">"the exhibition area covers 40 hectares, which may not be forwarded until at least 2023."</seg>
<seg id="86">"half of the total cost of 71 500 euros was funded by half of the leaders, a quarter contributed to the municipality of Fischerbach."</seg>
<seg id="87">"thus, the farmers remained 12 610 euros, which they had to invest in 16.2 kilometers of electric fence."</seg>
<seg id="88">"the big advantage is the longevity of the fences," explained Schwendemann. "</seg>
<seg id="89">"Kordula Kovac stressed:" you do a really good job, without farmers and landlady do not go. "</seg>
<seg id="90">Also for Peter White stand firm: "best foods are produced here."</seg>
<seg id="91">The Landscape Directive (LPR) Baden-Württemberg allows state-of-the-art extraction of soft-fences.</seg>
<seg id="92">The goal is the holding position of the Black Forest.</seg>
<seg id="93">The assumption of full take-up tends to exaggerate the simulated increase in caseloads and fiscal costs of a social policy reform.</seg>
<seg id="94">"in addition, the fenced area must not be towable (slope of over 35 percent) and must therefore be threatened by the forestation."</seg>
<seg id="95">"for the 2018 fisherman's electric fence project 2018, the application of eight participants with 24 plots, which would like to build just under 16 kilometres of fence."</seg>
<seg id="96">"the exhibition area corresponds to 35 hectares, which are calculated at more than 112 000 euros."</seg>
<seg id="97">Is nothing holy?</seg>
<seg id="98">The White House of Trump is now taking the statue of Liberty</seg>
<seg id="99">The safest sign of a regime change is when they begin to attack statues.</seg>
<seg id="100">The Americans appreciated this as well as any other - hence the carefully staged downfall of Saddam Hussein at the Firdos square in Baghdad in 2003.</seg>
<seg id="101">"Stephen Miller, one of the key ideologists of the Trump regime, certainly knew what he did when he took a symbolic axe in a heated quarrel with Jim Acosta of CNN on the proposals of the President for the drastic restriction of legal immigration with the Statue of Liberty."</seg>
<seg id="102">"to remain fair, Miller did not attack the statue itself."</seg>
<seg id="103">A horde of boat owners and Liberty Imitators would have landed him if he had done it.</seg>
<seg id="104">"but he took their meaning, and in particular the importance which you were attributed to when the famous poem by Emma Lazarus in 1903, 17 years after the completion of the monument, was added to his base."</seg>
<seg id="105">"as Miller Acosta penned:" I don't want to go into a complete thing about history here, but the Statue of Liberty is... a symbol of American freedom that lightens the world. "</seg>
<seg id="106">"the poem, which you refer to, which was later added and is not part of the original Statue of Liberty."</seg>
<seg id="107">"Miller is properly correct, but as he formulated it, it's not really about history."</seg>
<seg id="108">"it is about the contemporary response to the vibrating words of Lazarus, the only ones in which a state does not only invite any old immigrants, but the poorest of the poor."</seg>
<seg id="109">"there was never a time in which the" "falling waste" "was better to see on our screens."</seg>
<seg id="110">Miller did not engage in literary criticism - he made clear that these people are not welcome in Trumps USA.</seg>
<seg id="111">This conflict due to the importance of a statue is part of a wider political and cultural debate: it is indeed a conflict around the importance of America.</seg>
<seg id="112">"Lazarus - and her friends, who sat down to place their words after their death at the base - knew very well that they took a high political action."</seg>
<seg id="113">"the sculpture should show the ties between French and American Republicanism, portraying the female embodiment of freedom in a worn-out classical portrayal."</seg>
<seg id="114">Lazarus changed this meaning: in her poem the female figure is no longer abstract - she has received a voice.</seg>
<seg id="115">And she herself gives herself a very different name: mother of Exilants.</seg>
<seg id="116">The link of the poem with the image is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on the American Nativism.</seg>
<seg id="117">"and exactly how Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, people from the right wing wanted to change it for a long time."</seg>
<seg id="118">"the big Schreier Rush Limbaugh, a kind of John the Baptist for the coming of Trump, argued that the Statue of Liberty is no one drawer, but rather an early neo-conservatives that bring the American flame into the converted world:" Lady Liberty. "</seg>
<seg id="119">It should bear the torch of freedom from the United States into the rest of the world.</seg>
<seg id="120">The torch should not enlighten the way to the United States. "</seg>
<seg id="121">"quite unusual, Limbaugh is stung out here."</seg>
<seg id="122">The meaning of the statue is quite and even a question of the standpoint of perception.</seg>
<seg id="123">"the great fanciful deed of Lazarus was to see them as they were seen by the exhausted, eleventh, but hopeful people after long and often horrible voyages on the decks of ships."</seg>
<seg id="124">"in the truest sense, it is about seeing the world from the perspective of people seeking refuge and a chance to improve their lives."</seg>
<seg id="125">Her statue says to them the words of hope and the welcome that they have to hear.</seg>
<seg id="126">"and this is, of course, not the perspective that Miller and Trump would ever recognize."</seg>
<seg id="127">"her torch should not enlighten the way, but the hatred that is her only source of power."</seg>
<seg id="128">World Championship 2017: Neil Black praises Scottish members of the United Kingdom team</seg>
<seg id="129">Eilidh Doyle recalls at a time when only two Schotten belonged to the British team</seg>
<seg id="130">"the performance director of the athletics of the United Kingdom, Neil Black, says that the 16-member schottish contingent in the world championship kader" will make a massive contribution to the team. "</seg>
<seg id="131">A record number of Scottish athletes was selected for London 2017 which starts Friday.</seg>
<seg id="132">"black believes that" "in Scotland something special develops" "and the athletics of the United Kingdom have to learn something from it."</seg>
<seg id="133">"we welcome it and we try to understand it, and we will continue until we find out," "said Black."</seg>
<seg id="134">I talk to people at the Scottish Institute of Sport and they think it has something to do with what they have done.</seg>
<seg id="135">The Scottish athletes think there is something to do with what they have done.</seg>
<seg id="136">British athletics: it has something to do with what they have done.</seg>
<seg id="137">And also with the type on the street corner.</seg>
<seg id="138">"whatever the combination of circumstances is, it is absolutely brilliant."</seg>
<seg id="139">"several of the Scottish athletes are medals candidates, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart, who will compete against Sir Mo Farah on the 5,000 m track while Eilidh Doyle was elected by the team captain."</seg>
<seg id="140">"" "Eilidh is rather modest."</seg>
<seg id="141">"their captain speech was incredible," "says Black."</seg>
<seg id="142">"a number of athletes, whether they were Scottish or wherever they live or train, went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motivated."</seg>
<seg id="143">The passion and the real feeling that Eilidh naturally introduced were great.</seg>
<seg id="144">"the Commonwealth silver medal winner, who will compete in their fifth world championships in the 400-m-hurdles, says that it is" unbelievable "that 16 Scots are in the British team."</seg>
<seg id="145">Scotland's best overall number of athletes in the world championship was seven that were reached in 1983 and 2015.</seg>
<seg id="146">The mid-distance runner Muir leads along this path and last year has set up five British and two European records.</seg>
<seg id="147">"it will take part in the 1,500 m and 5,000 m runs."</seg>
<seg id="148">"Chris O'Hare, who runs 1,500 m, is another Scotsman, which one should observe after a great season that was winning the victory of the British Team Trials and the Anniversary Games."</seg>
<seg id="149">Doyle recalls her first World Championships as the only other Scotsman in Team Lee McConnell.</seg>
<seg id="150">"the team captain says that she is" "hugely proud" "to the fact that many of her compatriots are not only part of the team, but in some cases also with medals and finals."</seg>
<seg id="151">"the special thing about being team captain is that it was chosen by the other members of the team so that it was a great honor anyway, but knowing that my team mates voted for me and chose me, it makes something very special for me," she added. "</seg>
<seg id="152">Obviously I am very proud of all the Scots that belong to the team.</seg>
<seg id="153">It only shows how far we came.</seg>
<seg id="154">"and they are here as established athletes, athletes who want to ascend to podiums."</seg>
<seg id="155">What concerns my speech as a captain?</seg>
<seg id="156">"yes, I think she went well."</seg>
<seg id="157">I only pointed out that in this situation we are very happy as we have a home world championship.</seg>
<seg id="158">So it is really important to put on this home support and profit from it that we are back at the Olympiastadion.</seg>
<seg id="159">I get a second chance to go out there and compete and it will simply be such a great atmosphere out there.</seg>
<seg id="160">Blocking creators on Facebook: don't worry about a public office if you cannot tolerate the voters of voters</seg>
<seg id="161">The father of our country knew something of bad press.</seg>
<seg id="162">"the Americans loved George Washington, but it didn't last long until the newspapers hit him because of everything, from domestic politics to his political principles."</seg>
<seg id="163">"he penned in criticism, certainly."</seg>
<seg id="164">But he has not brought his critics to silence.</seg>
<seg id="165">"in 1783, Washington said:" freedom of speech can be taken away - and, silly and mute we will be led like sheep to slaughter. "</seg>
<seg id="166">"that brings me to Maryland to Governor Larry Hogan, who has to work to be more like Washington."</seg>
<seg id="167">Hogans employees have blocked and deleted the contributions of at least 450 people who have voiced their opinion on his official Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="168">And the American Civil Liberties Union accused him of the beginning of this week.</seg>
<seg id="169">"the Governor's staff left the complaint as frivolous, and the online commentary was full of a counter-reaction with" Na, and?. ""</seg>
<seg id="170">"it's just Facebook," "said many people."</seg>
<seg id="171">But it is important.</seg>
<seg id="172">And it is especially important when it is a type like Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="173">This is a republican Governor in an overwhelming democratic state that is surprisingly popular.</seg>
<seg id="174">He has the second highest consent of the 50 governors of the nation.</seg>
<seg id="175">Hogan is not a reactionary head-head.</seg>
<seg id="176">He has shown a firm hand in the leadership of his state and strict compliance with the principles.</seg>
<seg id="177">He was also very skillful to use Facebook as primary means to connect with his voters and play his hair-less head after chemotherapy on his side.</seg>
<seg id="178">"therefore, the blocking of persons who come to the Governor's side - which is a public forum called officially and by employees who are paid with public tax dollars - unnecessary and ultimately dangerous."</seg>
<seg id="179">In an interview with The Washington Post Hogans spokesman Amelia Chasse defended the actions of Governor and argued that blocking the comments was nothing more than a moderation.</seg>
<seg id="180">But it is too easy to use the picture of trolls or spammers or hassert people who vibrate online the whip.</seg>
<seg id="181">The post spoke to some of the real people blocked by Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="182">"and these are only real people speaking with their elected leaders: a teacher, an entrepreneur and a priest, no trolls."</seg>
<seg id="183">"they all said that their comments were respectful, thoughtful and not profound."</seg>
<seg id="184">The priest cited the Bible in his post and appealed to Hogans Catholic faith.</seg>
<seg id="185">"attorney Lakshmi Sarma Ramani of Bowie, Md., was not water-filled, but she asked for hate crimes."</seg>
<seg id="186">"I commented on politely that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to hate crimes and other current news," she wrote in the commentary box of the news broadcast "The Post." "</seg>
<seg id="187">"I also don't appreciate this idea if a number of people take a position on the same topic, they are ignored by some rather than a so-called collective effort and not recognized as a large group of affected citizens."</seg>
<seg id="188">"what the staff of the Governor referred to as" "concentrated spam-attack", "others would probably call" "intercession". ""</seg>
<seg id="189">"the Facebook era makes it easy to cut a message by simply blocking a critic, or deleted a negative comment."</seg>
<seg id="190">"it is much cleaner than in earlier times, if you have done the same that employees were sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical editorials and to arrest them or to silence them."</seg>
<seg id="191">But this is exactly what happens digitally.</seg>
<seg id="192">Hogan is not the first public official to criticize Facebook and other social media.</seg>
<seg id="193">President Trump is accusing Twitter users who have been blocked by his Twitter feed.</seg>
<seg id="194">One of the first milestones in this question fell last week in Virginia.</seg>
<seg id="195">"the Chairman of the Board of Supervisors des Loudoun County concludes the First Amendment, according to U.S. District Judge James C. Cacheris in Alexandria, when they have banished a voter from their Facebook page."</seg>
<seg id="196">"and in Kentucky, Governor Matt Bevin (R) also received a visit to the ACLU because of his use of Facebook and Twitter."</seg>
<seg id="197">This should not be so hard.</seg>
<seg id="198">"at the time of Washington, the time of affordable porttos had a similar effect as the Internet."</seg>
<seg id="199">"the number of newspapers multiplied between 1776 and 1800, and anonymous letters struck him on his lead."</seg>
<seg id="200">And even back then Washington had anonymous trolls.</seg>
<seg id="201">"the people who used pseudonyms like" Juricola, "" Valerius, "" Belisarius "and" Portius, "wrote all letters to papers that made Washington's decisions."</seg>
<seg id="202">"petitions, who criticized his position on the Treaty of Amity, trade and shipping with Britain, overcame his office, according to the historical documents collected by the online papers of the George Washington Project."</seg>
<seg id="203">But he did not bring them to silence.</seg>
<seg id="204">"freedom of speech, disagreements and discourses belong to the foundation of our nation."</seg>
<seg id="205">And true guidance means accepting this.</seg>

<seg id="424">"in recent months, Musk frequently had more than 500,000 reservation orders for the new car, whose delivery is just starting."</seg>
<seg id="425">"now Musk has one: from the total 518,000 pre-orders, 63.000 has already been withdrawn."</seg>
<seg id="426">Critics have repeatedly pointed out that it is merely non-binding reservations.</seg>
<seg id="427">"in case of cancellation, Tesla is paying the 1000 Euro (in the US 1000 US dollars and in the UK 1000 pounds)" Reservation payment. ""</seg>

<seg id="447">The sudden reversal of Wednesday is the most recent legal backlash for the withdrawal of regulatory rollback agenda.</seg>
<seg id="448">"last month, a Federal Court of Appeal in Washington decided that the EPA authorities overstepped its authority when he tried to delay the implementation of a rule by the Obama administration, the oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce methane leaks."</seg>

<seg id="466">"750 years St. Hilarius Church: on the occasion of the anniversary of the mountain church, the old cemetery site in Tumlingen on Sunday, 16 July, at 4.30 p.m. on a serenade."</seg>
<seg id="467">"whether its idyllic location and beautiful view of the village, the historic St. Hilarius facility is a popular place to stay."</seg>

<seg id="470">Walter Martini emphasizes: "it is a unique dörfliches Kleinod."</seg>
<seg id="471">"in 1267, the St. Hilariuskapelle was first mentioned in documents in the Württembergischen Urkundenbuch: count Hermann von Sulz sold the mountain with the parish church to Tumlingen and his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark Silver."</seg>
<seg id="472">"according to the original deed, on the Tumlingen mountain apart from the former parish church, there was also a beautiful courtyard where the church or patronal law belonged to and not the other way round."</seg>
<seg id="473">So there were also people there.</seg>
<seg id="474">"as from the description of the Oberamtes Freudenstadt from 1858, beside the village and the Oberdorf, which are still visible in the village of Tumlingen, the" "Berg" "is the third, the settlement nucleus of the village."</seg>

<seg id="481">"the newly created bell rang the first time in 1692, but had to be released later during the Second World War in 1942."</seg>
<seg id="482">In the 30-year-old war (1616 to 1648) the windows were carved and the bells were stolen.</seg>
<seg id="483">The roof was leaking.</seg>
<seg id="484">In 1796 French troops encamped close to the church.</seg>
<seg id="485">They removed the pulpit and church chairs and used them as firewood.</seg>
<seg id="486">Remains of the church threatened in 1809.</seg>
<seg id="487">"until 1869, the Tumlingen Hilarius cemetery served as the last resting place for the dead from Hörschweiler."</seg>
<seg id="488">In 1823 the cemetery was extended and the Hilariuskirche aborted.</seg>
<seg id="489">Only the Kirchturm had to be stopped.</seg>
<seg id="490">"in the New Year's Night in 1834, a storm split the church tower and half of it crashed."</seg>
<seg id="491">"to prevent misfortune, the tower was demolished."</seg>

<seg id="506">The association "Boisheim defenses" has called Landrat Andreas Coenen (CDU) to withdraw its approval for the construction of planned wind turbines in the Boisheimer Nette.</seg>
<seg id="507">It is illegal.</seg>
<seg id="508">"the association argues that at the time of approval on December 30, 2016, no wind turbines could have been approved at the Boisheimer Nette, as at the time in Viersen only a wind-force concentration zone existed at the border to Schwalmtal."</seg>
<seg id="509">"within this concentration zone, construction and operation of wind turbines are generally possible, but at the same time the concentration zone causes a exclusion of wind energy use for the rest of the city."</seg>
<seg id="510">Such zones are to prevent a "sparing" of the landscape.</seg>
<seg id="511">"the city of Viersen had decided a second wind power concentration zone in the Boisheimer Nette a few days earlier, but the district government Dusseldorf did not approve because of a formatting."</seg>
<seg id="512">"due to the lack of planning legal requirements, the granted approval is still unlawful and therefore recuperated," "said Christoph Erkens, Chairman of Boisheim."</seg>
<seg id="513">Current state of affairs: the city council has once again decided to re-establish the wind concentration zone in the Boisheimer Nette before the summer break; a permit from the district government is still pending.</seg>

<seg id="518">But they do not expect the procedure to be stopped.</seg>
<seg id="519">"with regard to ongoing proceedings at the Administrative Court, the circle on Thursday did not want to express itself in terms of the argumentation of the" Boisheim "association."</seg>
<seg id="520">"the NEW Re, a subsidiary of the NEW, plans to build four 200 metres high wind turbines on an area at Boisheimer Nette."</seg>
<seg id="521">"last year, the company, in which the city of Viersen is indirectly involved, has closed lease agreements with the owner of the approximately 65 hectares of large terrain."</seg>
<seg id="522">"with the construction of the four wind turbines, the power requirement of around 11 400 households should be covered - this corresponds to approximately one fifth of the power requirement of all four-year households."</seg>
<seg id="523">The NEW re wants to invest some 20 million euros.</seg>
<seg id="524">"last summer, Viersen City Council gave green light for the purchase of three wind turbines at the Linnich wind park near Aachen, as well as a participation in a wind turbine plant in Übach-Palenberg in Heinsberg District."</seg>

<seg id="1122">The rules aimed at preventing unhindered issues of European football clubs will not disturb Neymars world record transfer from the Spanish Barcelona to the French Paris-Saint Germain.</seg>
<seg id="1123">"any consequences will come to Paris Saint-Germain from the UEFA, as the guiding organisation that oversees the European game has the power to ban teams from access to the prestigious champions league tournament."</seg>
<seg id="1124">"financial fair play rules, launched in 2011 by the UEFA, mean that PSG has to prove at some point that the transfer of Neymar was financed without major losses."</seg>
<seg id="1125">"Barcelona has paid $222 million (262 million dollars) to buy Brazilian from his contract, and Neymar will receive a salary that will amount to several ten million dollars a year."</seg>
<seg id="1126">Here are some of the financial aspects of Neymars Moving to France.</seg>
<seg id="1127">"PSG can make money loosely, so that Neymar underwrites and bring him into a galaxy of other stars, in view of the financing of the team by the rich sovereign family of Qatar."</seg>
<seg id="1128">"clubs are allowed to spend a lot of money for the acquisition of players, but have to steer with legitimate income sources, which enable them to break-even point in their on the football-related business."</seg>
<seg id="1129">FFP was designed by Michel Platini after his election to the UEFA President in 2007.</seg>
<seg id="1130">"former French player believed that clubs, who had taken enormous debt in their quest for success, are effectively deceiving and risked to ruin when banks or owners withdrew their support."</seg>
<seg id="1131">"in 2011, FFP moved from concentration on the debts of clubs to monitor their losses."</seg>
<seg id="1132">"the change meant that the business model, the Roman Abramovich originally used in Chelsea - bought a club with potential and then invested heavily to improve the team and build a global brand - should become a harder matter."</seg>
<seg id="1133">"during the current three-year clearance period, which runs until 2018, clubs can accept losses of 30 million euros."</seg>
<seg id="1134">"and although Platini 2015 has fallen from the presidency of the Presidency, his UEFA successor Aleksander Ceferin continues to be afraid of excessive expenses."</seg>
<seg id="1135">"for sure, FFP is not dead and we will reinforce the rules for the future," "said Andrea Traverso, who is responsible for FFP in UEFA, compared to The Associated Press last week."</seg>
<seg id="1136">"although the PSG has paid the buy-out clause of Neymar in a package, it can distribute the amount for invoicing on the duration of his contract."</seg>
<seg id="1137">"Neymar has signed a five-year contract, so that the solution will be expelled for the next five years in the amount of 44.4 million euros in the end of the year."</seg>
<seg id="1138">"the first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014 brought the PSG to Abu Dhabi, which is owned by Manchester City, with the most severe sanctions."</seg>
<seg id="1139">"the PSG received a fine of 60 million euros (then 82 million dollars), which later was reduced to 20 million euros - and it was arranged that the team members for the 2014 / 15 Champions League will be limited to 21 players instead of the otherwise normal 25 players."</seg>
<seg id="1140">"UEFA is looking for clubs that could try to oversee their financial supervision by blowing their revenue by companies, which are connected to the owners of a club."</seg>
<seg id="1141">"while a catartable company could sponsor the PSG, if the value of the sponsor should exceed the standard market rates, the UEFA would not be considered legitimate income."</seg>
<seg id="1142">"this is exactly what happened in 2014, when the UEFA decided that the value of the sponsor of the PSA was inflated by the Qatar Tourism Authority."</seg>
<seg id="1143">It was reported that part of the PSG-payments to Neymar could come to Qatar about payments of the Organizing Committee of the 2022 World Cup in Qatar.</seg>
<seg id="1144">But PSG and Qatar 2022 argued that Neymar WM will be ambassadors and a such maneuver for the UEFA regulators could be easy to figure out.</seg>
<seg id="1145">"the previous sanctions against PSG mean that the UEFA will be more attentive, to observe any attempt to circumvent the rules."</seg>
<seg id="1146">"UEFA had no pre-preparatory discussions with PSG about Neymars Transfer, announcing the people familiar with the situation on Thursday."</seg>
<seg id="1147">"they spoke under the condition of anonymity with The Associated Press, since they were not authorized to discuss the PSG situation."</seg>

<seg id="1262">The Bank of England will hold interest rates at 0.25%</seg>
<seg id="1263">"the Bank of England is expected to announce that interest rates will remain unchanged, after weak economic growth and the weakening of inflation have dampened speculation over an increase."</seg>
<seg id="1264">"the Bank of England warns that economic growth will remain" "sluggish" "when it kept interest rates on family income in the middle of an intensifying pressure."</seg>
<seg id="1265">"the Bank's policy makers in the Monetary Committee (MPC) agreed with 6 to 2 to hold interest rates to 0.25%, with fewer members in this month, as weak economic growth weakened support for an increase."</seg>
<seg id="1266">"in its quarterly inflation forecast, the Bank reduced its growth forecasts for 2017 to 1.7% and from 2018 to 1.6% and warned that the pressure on budgetary income would continue, whereby inflation in autumn is likely to rise to just under 3%."</seg>
<seg id="1267">"but they signalized that in the next few years, interest rates would be necessary to curb the inflation heated by the Brexit and they said that the loan costs might have to rise more than expected in the financial markets."</seg>

<seg id="1269">"it will demand time for financing plan to provide cheaper financial resources for banks in the coming February, although it is said that it will now be expected to provide 15 billion pounds more within the scope of this system - with 115 billion pounds sterling."</seg>
<seg id="1270">"after the decision on the interest rate, the Bank said:" in the central prognosis of the MPC the gross domestic product (GDP) remains weak at short notice, as the pressure on the real income of households continued to strain consumption. "</seg>
<seg id="1271">"in terms of interest rates, it repeated that" a certain streamlining of monetary policy "would be required for the cooling of inflation and a" somewhat larger "extent than the markets expect."</seg>
<seg id="1272">The markets are currently forecasting the first increase in the third quarter of the next year and another in 2020.</seg>
<seg id="1273">"however, the Bank stressed that elevations would be" gradual "and" limited. ""</seg>
<seg id="1274">Forecasts to 2019 illustrate how the market is set to change.</seg>
<seg id="1275">It has maintained its growth forecast to 1.8% in 2018.</seg>
<seg id="1276">The Pound fell after these news from the dollar and the euro.</seg>
<seg id="1277">"the pound fell by 0.5% to 1,31 US dollars and fell by 0.4% to 1,11 Euro."</seg>
<seg id="1278">"the decision to no change is due after the latest disappointing growth figures have dampened the rising expectations of interest in interest, and GDP increased to 0.3% in the second quarter of 0.2% in the previous three months."</seg>
<seg id="1279">"growth is expected to be 0.3% in the third quarter, although it will recover after the Bank at the end of the year."</seg>
<seg id="1280">"the recent inflation report provided little enthusiasm for households, which are affected by rising inflation and low wages, as the sharpening becomes worse first before it becomes better."</seg>
<seg id="1281">"she added that monetary policy in the next few years cannot prevent income from income," "she added that wages will be" "clear" "at the end of their three-year forecasts."</seg>
<seg id="1282">"the economy is also strengthened by the rising demand for British goods, which is attributable to the weak Pound, which is compensated for a portion of lower consumption expenditure."</seg>
<seg id="1283">"the decision comes a year after lowering interest rates to 0,25% last August following the shocking EU vote, which caused the sinking of the pounds."</seg>
<seg id="1284">The bank estimates that it will probably take four years until this will reach the prices and the economy.</seg>
<seg id="1285">"prior to the last judgement of the Bank on interest rates, the call for interest rates rose as inflation increased pressure on hard-pressed households, with three political decision makers in July demanded an increase to 0.5%."</seg>
<seg id="1286">"inflation in the past month of 2.9% decreased to 2.6% in June, although the Bank said it was expected and will attract it over the coming months."</seg>
<seg id="1287">"the Bank said that exceeding 2% is attributable to" "wholly" "attributable to the weak Pound."</seg>
<seg id="1288">"Andrew Montlake, Director of Coreco Mortgage Brokers, said:" in view of the recent decline in swap rates, the mortgage market is likely to become more competitive again, as the lenders are looking for businesses and want to end the year in a positive manner. "</seg>

<seg id="1296">Prep exposure phylaxis (prep) is a result of HIV preparations which are taken before sex in order to reduce the risk of HIV infection.</seg>
<seg id="1297">Studies have shown that prep significantly reduces HIV transmission in infection areas.</seg>
<seg id="1298">Taking prep before sexual intercourse means that just enough drugs are present in the body of a person to prevent HIV infection.</seg>
<seg id="1299">Such medications can be taken every day or so already two hours before sexual intercourse.</seg>
<seg id="1300">"those who are eligible for treatment include gay or bisexual men, transsexual and individuals with HIV positive partners who have not been successfully treated."</seg>
<seg id="1301">"in clinics, appropriate participants are identified to agree to the study including men, women, transgenders and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not known by antiretroviral treatment."</seg>
<seg id="1302">People who live in England and are registered with a family doctor may also opt-in for possible participation in their local sex clinic.</seg>
<seg id="1303">The program will be £10 million and NHS England signed a contract for delivery of the medicines this week following an international competitive sourcing.</seg>
<seg id="1304">"the study aims to assess the entire potential of prep by collecting and implementing clinical evidence, as being used in a large scale."</seg>
<seg id="1305">"Stevens said:" "this great new intervention should complement and overtake the far-reaching and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV."</seg>
<seg id="1306">It is another milestone in the more than three decades of ongoing progress in coping with one of the greatest health challenges of mankind. "</seg>
<seg id="1307">"Deborah Gold, Chief Executive at NAT (National Aids Trust), said:" this is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV. "</seg>
<seg id="1308">"prep, if targeted towards vulnerable and endangered humans, provides the opportunity to change the English HIV epidemic."</seg>
<seg id="1309">"from September onwards, people with high HIV risk will have access to this NHS-funded study in England to develop a new instrument which is really individually controlled and is not subject to negotiation with a partner, which leads to the improvement of many, many lives."</seg>
<seg id="1310">We sincerely welcome this announcement. "</seg>
<seg id="1311">"Ian Green, Chairman of the Terrence Higgins Trust, said:" the priority must now be that the study will be carried out quickly across the country and that no one who has a risk for HIV is left behind. "</seg>
<seg id="1312">"now, as the prep test medicine has been obtained, we are on the best way to protect more than 10,000 HIV-infected people."</seg>
<seg id="1313">"Sharon Hodgson, Minister of Health Minister, said:" the beginning of the prep trial is welcome and overdue after months of delays and delayed implementation by the government. "</seg>
<seg id="1314">The evidence shows how transformative this drug may be part of our approach to HIV prevention and end the transmission of this life-changing infection.</seg>
<seg id="1315">This attempt brings us a step closer to understanding the benefits of prep.</seg>

<seg id="1317">Living the great life: mezzanine and clever designer tricks have turned this little Earls Court flat into a generous home</seg>
<seg id="1318">"Joanne Leigh, a former banker with a passion for real estate, fell in 2014 from a large house in Knightsbridge to Earls Court Apartment."</seg>
<seg id="1319">It is on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne Terrace - and it is a proof of the new design that Joanne did not pack her bags and sold her bags.</seg>
<seg id="1320">"before that I lived with my ex in Knightsbridge in a much larger room," "says Joanne."</seg>
<seg id="1321">I looked for something comparable to my price.</seg>
<seg id="1322">"I was shown this apartment in Earls Court, and she had the same high ceilings."</seg>
<seg id="1323">I fell in love with them and made an offer this day. "</seg>
<seg id="1324">"since the first visit, the 1,000 square foot of the apartment has been completely overhauled."</seg>
<seg id="1325">Originally a one-room property with a nested layout - one had to go through the kitchen to enter the bedroom - wanted to add Joanne's storage room and a mezzanine to optimally use the generous ceiling height.</seg>
<seg id="1326">"I wanted high ceilings, large windows, lots of light."</seg>
<seg id="1327">"that was my request," she says. "</seg>
<seg id="1328">"for this purpose, she commissioned the architectural and design studio Duck & Shed of Erfan Azadi from Notting Hill to use 12.5 feet high ceilings and to create a home that was not just a development, but also a place for Joanne's life."</seg>
<seg id="1329">"the ceiling was not large enough to place two rooms above each other, so that the architectural challenge consisted in creating a mezzanine in which one could stand."</seg>
<seg id="1330">"Erfan had to think creatively, in order to solve the issue."</seg>
<seg id="1331">"the steelworks are quite complicated," he explains. "</seg>
<seg id="1332">"we had to arrange the rooms so that they were stacked on each other, without having to bade."</seg>
<seg id="1333">"it was not just about building a simple platform, but to put the steel in such a way that it had the right height for the function above or below."</seg>
<seg id="1334">"this arrangement enabled Erfan to place two rooms at full height, with a lot of additional drama."</seg>
<seg id="1335">"for the mezzanine, a classic copper light window from Retrouvius overlooks the glamorous living area."</seg>
<seg id="1336">"mirrored gold furniture, silver accents and vintage Serge Mouille lighting set the style for the program."</seg>
<seg id="1337">"the use of mirrors plays a role in adding theatre, space and light."</seg>
<seg id="1338">"at both ends, a short corridor is mirrored to allow it to work longer."</seg>
<seg id="1339">"in the kitchen, the mirroring feels like a window in another room."</seg>
<seg id="1340">At the entrance offers mirrored units space for all the cutlery and jars of Joanne.</seg>
<seg id="1341">"through the perception of a glamorous space, the beauty of the living room can shut down the kitchen if it is not used."</seg>
<seg id="1342">Foldable kitchens are nothing new.</seg>
<seg id="1343">The special thing about this is that it is a garage door.</seg>
<seg id="1344">"a bit of engineering went inside," "explains Erfan of the steel reinforced, veneered MDF door."</seg>
<seg id="1345">"it is counterbalanced so that when you slide the door, very easily glides."</seg>
<seg id="1346">"thanks to the clever use of space and storage space, Joanne could gain additional 16 m ², an additional bedroom and an improved layout."</seg>
<seg id="1347">"at the end of the day you will sell the land - or how your property is appreciated," says Erfan. "</seg>
<seg id="1348">"in a rudimentary form, a real estate agent will enter and calculate a calculation based on the size of the floor."</seg>
<seg id="1349">"here they have managed to enlarge the floor space and at the same time use high-quality materials, which give the room its luxurious advantage."</seg>
<seg id="1350">"the materials are the things that you touch and which help to create an emotional bond in a home," "says Erfan."</seg>
<seg id="1351">"you do not love yourself in the electrical outlets in the walls.</seg>
<seg id="1352">"these are important, but they do not play with your heart."</seg>
<seg id="1353">It shows that an apartment can transform itself with a good design and increased square footage of some standard in something quite astonishing.</seg>
<seg id="1354">"indeed, like Joanne, you could decide not to leave it."</seg>

<seg id="1357">"the former director of the Carlton football club 'and developer Colin De Lutis lives in a villa in Toorak, only three doors from his younger brother Paul. he brought him to the Supreme Court to clarify how their property and their assets are to be divided."</seg>
<seg id="1358">"Paul wanted to withdraw from the family business since 2014, but a sharp argument about the separation will take place in the Supreme Court."</seg>
<seg id="1359">"together with her mother Anna, the brothers have accumulated 38 properties worth more than half a billion dollars, since the family bought a shop in Smith Street, Collingwood since 1973."</seg>
<seg id="1360">The Westco jeans family established there and grew to a chain of 160 retail stores.</seg>
<seg id="1361">It was sold for USD 85 million in 1999.</seg>
<seg id="1362">"this money has been invested in real estate, and De Lutis's portfolio now includes offices in the city center, the development areas of Brunswick and Sorrento, the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Buller, as well as shopping centres in the suburb."</seg>
<seg id="1363">"after an agreement with her deceased father, Colin - from Paul as" main operator and the dominant personality "in the De Lutis family - about two thirds of the company's assets and Paul about one third."</seg>
<seg id="1364">A court file states that this means that Colin has possession of $316 million and Paul worth of 176 million dollars.</seg>
<seg id="1365">The division of real estate and cash has proved to be a problem for Paul.</seg>
<seg id="1366">"the divisions proposed by Colin drew him with what I thought for the best objects," he wrote in 2015 in a first Affidavit. "</seg>
<seg id="1367">"last Friday, after several failed attempts, the first hearing of the Supreme Court of Justice took place."</seg>
<seg id="1368">"the brothers now fight for control of the existing business - from which Colin, as Paul claims to have excluded him."</seg>
<seg id="1369">"Colin argued that this is not true, but raises Paul to manage some possessions incompetent."</seg>
<seg id="1370">"in an early Affidavit, which was submitted by Colin, he says he hopes to settle the argument."</seg>
<seg id="1371">"my Italian heritage states that the family is the most important priority," he wrote. "</seg>
<seg id="1372">"the costs rise in the event, with hundreds of pages with affidavits, e-mails and reports from companies, among them Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer, and with leading lawyers, among them Allan Myers, QC, and from both parties held law firms."</seg>
<seg id="1373">"Mrs. De Lutis and her deceased husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who run milk bars and delicacies from the late 1950s, and in the early seventies bought a shop in Brunswick."</seg>
<seg id="1374">"they used the security to buy the Collingwood property, in which Colin opened the first Jeansladen of the family."</seg>
<seg id="1375">Colin says he started Westco there when he was "in my last years of High School when Paul was still a small child (about 10 years old).</seg>
<seg id="1376">"Anna De Lutis says that she and Luigi, who died in 2012, hoped to pass on her property to her sons."</seg>
<seg id="1377">"Luigi said often to me that he never wanted the brothers to come to court," she wrote. "</seg>
<seg id="1378">"two other brothers, Mark and Luke, are no longer part of De Lutis group, where Colin claims that Mark when leaving the company paid 10 million dollars and Luke 26 million dollars."</seg>
<seg id="1379">"both Luke and Mark, Paul says about the conditions of their financial separation."</seg>
<seg id="1380">"Colin drew back very much, although he was a former AFL board member and after a biography from the year 2015 by Eddie McGuire, he was the best friend of the TV star."</seg>
<seg id="1381">Fairfax Media took contact with Colin and Paul De Lutis and their lawyers.</seg>
<seg id="1382">"only Colin answered by SMS, to say" I can really not say much, "because the case is before the courts."</seg>
<seg id="1383">"it is very, very sad that my brother Paul decided to accuse me and pull our surname through the dishes," he wrote. "</seg>
<seg id="1384">"in mid-2016, Colin wrote in a letter to the court that he tried to fulfill the demands of his brother."</seg>
<seg id="1385">"our father did not wish that Paul and I would end up in our current dispute," he said and added that he still hope for a solution. "</seg>
<seg id="1386">On Friday this hope seemed to be over.</seg>

<seg id="1388">Trumps of new Chief of Staff plans to limit the president's media abstinence.</seg>
<seg id="1389">Others have tried and failed.</seg>
<seg id="1390">Maybe John F. Kelly might actually do it.</seg>
<seg id="1391">"if so, he will be the first."</seg>
<seg id="1392">"POLITICO reports that the new Chief of Staff of the White House plans to limit the flow of information to President Trump, including news media reports - hoping to keep the boss on a uniform course."</seg>
<seg id="1393">Here is a piece of Reporter Josh Dawsey:</seg>
<seg id="1394">"when John F. Kelly, the new Chief of Staff of the White House, met with leading employees at his first working day, he represented a major problem in President Donald Trumps White House which he wants to repair: bad information that comes into the hands of the president."</seg>
<seg id="1395">"Kelly told the staff that information about him should flow - whether on paper or in briefings, because the President would make better decisions if he would receive good information."</seg>
<seg id="1396">"Kellys diagnosis makes sense, but others have tried to tame trump by monitoring its media control."</seg>
<seg id="1397">"President Trumps relationship to television reaches decades back - and now, where he is in the White House, his TV advertising is still strong."</seg>
<seg id="1398">"when candidate Trump was angry with unfair reporting, it was productive to show him that he received a fair reporting of jobs that were to be persuaded," said the former campaign adviser Sam Nunberg in February opposite Politico. "</seg>
<seg id="1399">"Politicos Tara palmeri wrote at the time that" the key to keep Trumps Twitter habit under control, according to six former electoral campaigners in it, to ensure that his personal media consumption includes a steady praise. "</seg>
<seg id="1400">Okay.</seg>
<seg id="1401">But the idea that Trumps's Twitter habit was ever "under control" is ridiculous.</seg>
<seg id="1402">Perhaps these campaign officials know something we don't know yet - that Trumps Tweets without their intervention would have included even more fuel.</seg>
<seg id="1403">We will probably never learn something about the tweets that Trump has not sent.</seg>
<seg id="1404">"if his employees managed to keep it away from him a few times, their efforts have been worthwhile."</seg>
<seg id="1405">But no one has consistently prevented it from calling out Trump controversy.</seg>
<seg id="1406">"part of the problem is that people in a White House, which is composed of competing parties, will always try to advance their own agenda by presenting Trump material that may possibly promote their views from the world."</seg>
<seg id="1407">"POLITICO - very busy with this story, reported in May about the preference of advisors to give the President of strategic reasons doubtful information."</seg>
<seg id="1408">This was an example described by Reporter Shane Goldmacher:</seg>
<seg id="1409">"current and former Trump-officials say that Trump can react like a vulcano on negative press cuts, especially those with shameful leaks, and that he will find out where they come from."</seg>
<seg id="1410">"that was exactly what happened at the end of February when someone accused the President a printed copy of an article by GotNews.com, the website of the Internet Provocateurs Charles C. Johnson, who accused the Deputy Chief of Staff Katie Walsh," to be the source behind a heap of leaks "in the White House."</seg>
<seg id="1411">"although Johnson was permanently banned from Twitter because of chicane, or that he offered no concrete evidence or that he expressed false allegations in the past and revoke them."</seg>
<seg id="1412">Trump read the article and started asking employees about Walsh.</seg>
<seg id="1413">"Goldmacher added that the then Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and the General Secretary of the White House, Rob Porter," tried to implement a system to manage and document the paperwork and document the trump. "</seg>
<seg id="1414">How did that work?</seg>
<seg id="1415">Kelly tries three months later to do the same.</seg>
<seg id="1416">"perhaps he will prove himself as an effective manager as a priebus, but Trump is still his impulsive self, and his advisers still aspire to influence."</seg>
<seg id="1417">These unchangeable factors make Kellys's mission very difficult.</seg>

<seg id="1445">The Waldhotel Luise is made from the former Hotel Birkenhof.</seg>
<seg id="1446">"the house in front of the gates of Freudenstadt is currently being renovated and will be opened again on March 1, next year."</seg>
<seg id="1447">These are good news for the city.</seg>
<seg id="1448">"due to the closing of the Birkenhof hotel by the former ambience Betriebsgesellschaft mbH on April 13, 2014, some 30,000 overnight stays were lost per year and also revenue through the local tax."</seg>
<seg id="1449">"in the fall of 2014, in the face of dramatic rising numbers of refugees who came to the county, the hotel building was offered as a collective accommodation which provided controversial discussions."</seg>
<seg id="1450">The city prevented the accommodation of asylum seekers by setting up a building plan to secure the area as a hotel location.</seg>
<seg id="1451">The decision was not undisputed at that time in the Municipal Council.</seg>
<seg id="1452">"however, especially Freudenstadt's mayor Julian Osswald defended the hotel location and already spoke of serious interested parties in the house."</seg>
<seg id="1453">He should keep right.</seg>
<seg id="1454">"the group of Luisenhotels, with Managing Director Birgit Scherer, based in Bad Bergzabern, has bought the former Hotel Birkenhof at a voluntary auction in Berlin and wants to make it a house of the three-star-plus category under the name Waldhotel Luise."</seg>

<seg id="1479">Russia-affair: us-Special Intermediator sets Grand Jury</seg>
<seg id="1480">"in the Russia affair around US President Donald Trump, special promoter Robert Mueller is said to have used a so-called Grand Jury after a report."</seg>
<seg id="1481">"the panel started work in recent weeks, and wrote the 'Wall Street Journal' by calling on the matter entrusted to them."</seg>
<seg id="1482">The paper took the step as a sign that Mueller extended and intensified his investigation.</seg>
<seg id="1483">"the station CNN reported, there are already initial charges of the Gremidium in connection with a meeting between the mumps of the oldest son and a Russian lawyer."</seg>
<seg id="1484">U.S. intelligence services have been accusing the Kremlin for a long time being targeted in the 2016 presidential election campaign.</seg>
<seg id="1485">Mueller examined whether there were agreements between Trumps electoral campaigns and Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="1486">The investigators focus on several men who acted as advisors to the republicans in the election campaign.</seg>
<seg id="1487">"according to reports, Mueller also took more and more trumps private and business environment under the microscope."</seg>
<seg id="1488">"the" "Washington Post" "wrote several weeks ago that the Special Intermediator Trump has personally moved into the centre and investigate whether the President in the course of the affair may hinder the judiciary."</seg>
<seg id="1489">"the main task of Grand Jurys is to examine the present evidence in possible cases of crime, and decide whether to be charged."</seg>
<seg id="1490">"therefore, Grand Jurys are also called count chambers."</seg>
<seg id="1491">"in most cases, they are turned on when it comes to larger and controversial cases."</seg>
<seg id="1492">The procedure is always carried out behind closed doors.</seg>
<seg id="1493">The body can also be turned on by the public prosecutor to charge people for the hearing under Eid.</seg>
<seg id="1494">"according to the radio station CNN, already discharges were issued, which revolve around the encounter between Donald Trump Jr. and a Russian lawyer."</seg>
<seg id="1495">"people who were involved in the meeting were invited to a statement, called it in the report."</seg>
<seg id="1496">"in addition, they should provide documents."</seg>
<seg id="1497">"in addition to Trump Jr., Trumps were also consultants and son-in-law Jared Kushner, as well as his former Elector Paul Manafort during the interview."</seg>
<seg id="1498">"on Thursday evening in U.S. television, legal experts said that the substitution show that Mueller would not let itself intimidated in his work and that he should act quickly if necessary."</seg>
<seg id="1499">"however, it does not necessarily mean that the Grand Jury will be turned on at the end to decide on the elevation of an indictment."</seg>
<seg id="1500">"nevertheless, the decomposition of the abyss will be the beginning of a new phase in the investigation and a new cause for concern for President Trump."</seg>
<seg id="1501">"in the midst of the new revelations, the president took a speech in West Virginia on Thursday evening to portray the Russia affair as a campaign of his political opponents."</seg>
<seg id="1502">"the Russia history is a total invention," "said Trump."</seg>
<seg id="1503">"the theme gives the democrats a way to" feel good, "because they have nothing else to talk about."</seg>
<seg id="1504">"his special adviser Ty Cobb stated in a statement, he knows nothing about the insertion of a Grand Jury."</seg>
<seg id="1505">"but this work usually works in secret, he stressed."</seg>
<seg id="1506">The White House advocates all measures that accelerated the work of the Special Agent in a "fair" way.</seg>
<seg id="1507">The former FBI chief James Comey said three times that not against the president.</seg>
<seg id="1508">"there is no reason to assume that something has changed, it was in the explanation."</seg>
<seg id="1509">But Mueller had only been used after Trump Comey had fired.</seg>
<seg id="1510">"because of this rash, accusations against Trump were loud, he wanted to hinder the judiciary."</seg>
<seg id="1511">"Comey said in June ahead of a Senate Committee, Trump asked him for a setting of the investigations against the former national security adviser Michael Flynn."</seg>
<seg id="1512">The President is under great pressure because of the investigation.</seg>
<seg id="1513">"following the representation of US media, the White House gathered material against the special promoter and its staff."</seg>
<seg id="1514">The dissolved speculation about whether Trump Moeller wants to release.</seg>
<seg id="1515">"unlike an independent special promoter of Congress, such as the Watergate affair around the later president Richard Nixon, Mueller has a position in which he could theoretically be inspired by the President of the Ministry of Justice."</seg>
<seg id="1516">"however, several senators of both parties want to prevent such a step."</seg>
<seg id="1517">"two groups of republican and democratic senators present legislative proposals on Thursday, after which the special promoter could no longer be dismissed."</seg>
<seg id="1518">Antarctica: giant iceberg drives in the Antarctica</seg>
<seg id="1519">In the western Antarctic a gigantic iceberg was solved by the scarcely seven-fold greatness of Berlin.</seg>
<seg id="1520">This shared the Bremerhavener Alfred-Wegener-Institut for Polar and Marine Research on Wednesday.</seg>
<seg id="1521">"the colossus spanned over a trillion tons and 5800 square kilometers, now driving to the north and will probably need two, three years until it melted."</seg>
<seg id="1522">"with 175 kilometres of length and a width of up to 50 kilometres, it is one of the biggest iron giants that have registered researchers over the past three decades."</seg>
<seg id="1523">There is no danger for people from him.</seg>
<seg id="1524">"to what extent climate change has played a role in the demolition of the iceberg, according to research indications is unclear."</seg>
<seg id="1525">"in total, there have been a series of unusual breakdowns of ice-downs in the region for about 30 years, writes the US research centre for snow and ice (NSIDC) in a factor background."</seg>
<seg id="1526">"according to many researchers, this could be related to global warming."</seg>
<seg id="1527">The broken colossus has so far been a part of the Larsen-C notes.</seg>
<seg id="1528">Schelfeis swims on the sea and is fed by big glaciers.</seg>
<seg id="1529">It continues to grow further into the sea and breaks down regularly.</seg>
<seg id="1530">The Larsen-C-Schelfeis lies south of South America almost at the top of the Antarctic peninsula.</seg>
<seg id="1531">"North of this shank, the balance of waxing and abort was disturbed some years ago."</seg>
<seg id="1532">"a complete Schelfeis is broken down there, AWI-researcher Daniela Jansen writes."</seg>
<seg id="1533">"there is a lot to say that the Larsen-C shank is in danger, as the front edge has never withdrawn as far as currently."</seg>
<seg id="1534">"in addition, the ice slab stands under tension and can crumble if a piece is broken at a key point."</seg>
<seg id="1535">"the melting of Schelfeis and Eisberg does not increase the sea level, as they float on the water and ice cream so much water as it produces after melting."</seg>
<seg id="1536">"however, the loss of the shank leads to the fact that the glaciers can flow directly into the sea and drain much faster than before."</seg>
<seg id="1537">"this could possibly increase the sea level, but only in a little extent, the British research project writes for the observation of Antarctica (Midas)."</seg>
<seg id="1538">"according to AWI information with almost 50 000 square kilometres, the Larsen-C-Schelfeis is the fourth largest feeder of Antarctica."</seg>
<seg id="1539">"at the transition from the mainland, it is up to 700 metres thick, at the front edge to the free ocean some 200 meters."</seg>
<seg id="1540">There it breaks regularly.</seg>
<seg id="1541">"although it is a natural phenomenon and is not aware of any direct connection to climate change, the ice sign is now in a more dangerous position," "said Martin O'Leary from the British Swansea University."</seg>
<seg id="1542">"that is the longest retreat since the beginning of the record," he also confirmed. "</seg>
<seg id="1543">"scientists are disputed whether the Larsen-C-Schelfeis will continue to grow or fall back in the long term, and may collapse, said his colleague Adrian Luckman and added:" "our models say that it will be less stable."</seg>
<seg id="1544">But this development will take decades.</seg>
<seg id="1545">"even if these researchers did not cause the demolition of this gigantic iceberg on climate change, however, in recent decades many ice-downs of the Antarctic Peninsula have fallen apart."</seg>
<seg id="1546">This long skirt of Antarctica extends towards South America.</seg>
<seg id="1547">"according to data from the British Antarctic Survey research programme, the ice surface of the Antarctic peninsula has declined by 28 000 square kilometres since the 1950s."</seg>
<seg id="1548">"as a result, the temperature increase has contributed to the decline."</seg>
<seg id="1549">"in the past 50 years, the Antarctic peninsula warms around three degrees and thus tame to the areas where the temperature increases the fastest."</seg>

<seg id="1558">"at present, there are still 50 vacancies at the Mettmann district."</seg>
<seg id="1559">"among other things, we are looking for doctors and engineers as well as the forces of general administration."</seg>

<seg id="1561">"according to the request of the parties, the administration shall develop a concept for recruitment and personnel development."</seg>
<seg id="1562">"the aim is to not only cover short-term demand for skilled workers, but to counteract forward-orientated applicants."</seg>
<seg id="1563">"the overall concept should orientate both internally and externally, demonstrate concrete measures for cross-entrants and include an apprenticeship campaign, call CDU, FDP and UWG."</seg>
<seg id="1564">This sounds like a good approach.</seg>
<seg id="1565">Because the circle has to do with personal problems that you didn't know before.</seg>
<seg id="1566">Other cities promote good officials and employees and offer more attractive conditions.</seg>
<seg id="1567">The speech is of a regular "competition of public employers."</seg>
<seg id="1568">"for this purpose, a high number of employees, who are leaving illness or age-related reasons, comes from the service."</seg>
<seg id="1569">So high time for action so that no more jobs remain unoccupied.</seg>
<seg id="1570">"but Klaus-Dieter Z., factional leader of the CDU, goes beyond the joint application with his party."</seg>
<seg id="1571">"he long ago made a surprise in the circle of chalk for a fist surprise when he publicly challenged the personnel costs, and the remaining parties were amazed."</seg>
<seg id="1572">"people want all the possibilities to be checked, which allow an exit from the municipal employers association."</seg>
<seg id="1573">"if we don't come to a satisfying solution here at short notice, the district administration with the unions - perhaps also in cooperation with the county-related cities - should strive for a" "Haustarif", "so peoples."</seg>
<seg id="1574">"in doing so, the CDU tries to better pay the employees and officials when it actually foresees collective bargaining for the public service."</seg>
<seg id="1575">"the salaries are currently exactly prescribed, elevations or more money are only if one changes to a higher level that is oriented toward professional years."</seg>
<seg id="1576">But the challenges of the circle have grown increasingly in recent years.</seg>

<seg id="1581">"if NGOs do not sign a new code of conduct, it is difficult to see how they can continue," "said Interior Minister Marco Minniti in an interview with the Turin daily La Stampa."</seg>
<seg id="1582">Minnitis's warning came a day after the Italian authorities had seized a boat of the German aid organisation 'Youth Rettet' because their team had effectively collaborated with traffickers in a manner that facilitated illegal immigration.</seg>
<seg id="1583">"the relief organisation, which has only been in operation for a year now, refused to speak to detailed allegations of the Italian prosecutor Ambrogio Cartosio."</seg>
<seg id="1584">"for us, the saving of human life remains our top priority. so we are very sorry that at the moment we cannot operate in the search and rescue zone," the organisation said in a statement on the social media. "</seg>
<seg id="1585">"we can only judge any accusations that are currently raised, after we have collected all the information and assess the situation."</seg>
<seg id="1586">"the Italian authorities had watched the boat from 'Youth Rettet', the Iuventa, since October."</seg>
<seg id="1587">"it is suspected that its crew takes on board inflatable migrants, which are delivered to them directly by traffickers, and that the smugglers can depart, so that the ships can be used again."</seg>
<seg id="1588">"at least one such meeting occurred allegedly only 1.3 miles off the Libyan coast, according to the prosecutor's act, whose content was published by Italian media."</seg>
<seg id="1589">"the occupation is suspected of being overseen by the authority of the Italian Coast Guard, the rescue operations in the area for humanitarian grounds and not from any other motives."</seg>
<seg id="1590">"under the Code of Conduct, boats such as the Iuventa have to have an Italian police officer on board, who monitors their activities."</seg>
<seg id="1591">"only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue operations have agreed to hold the code: save the Children, Moas from Malta and Pro-Activa Open Arms from Spain."</seg>
<seg id="1592">"the latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be deemed unnecessary, but acceptable as they would not bring" significant changes or obstructions "of their rescue operations."</seg>
<seg id="1593">Among those who refuse to sign is the Nobel laureate organisation Ärzte ohne Grenzen (MSF).</seg>
<seg id="1594">"" "Minniti now said that the number of migrants who arrived after the rescue measures in Italy had gone back strongly in recent weeks, suggesting that efforts to strengthen the Libyan coastguard and cooperation with local citizens have borne fruit."</seg>
<seg id="1595">"in recent days we have begun to see light at the end of the tunnel," said the Minister. "</seg>
<seg id="1596">"he announced plans for further talks with Libyan citizens this month about economic development initiatives and with Chad, Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants who leave these countries hoping to reach Europe."</seg>
<seg id="1597">Ascents and Trials</seg>
<seg id="1598">"nine Weilermer Biker, the" Berlin outpost "and two guest drivers met in Wachenheim in the Nordpfalz region, to enjoy Trials and Sights for four days."</seg>
<seg id="1599">There were three friendly guides available for this purpose.</seg>
<seg id="1600">The accommodation in the Wachenheimer valley proved to be a good starting point for the tours.</seg>
<seg id="1601">The Burgundy and Weinfest of Wachenheim was a welcome extra.</seg>
<seg id="1602">The first tour took place during hot summer temperatures along the vineyards to the Michaelskapelle above Deidesheim.</seg>
<seg id="1603">"view points followed, partly on towers, from which one could look far above the Pfälzer forest and the upstream levels."</seg>
<seg id="1604">"in between, there were always longer ascents, for the long Trials rewarded."</seg>
<seg id="1605">On the second day we went to Bad Dürkheim to the Saline and to the Volksfest Wurstmarkt.</seg>
<seg id="1606">"again, a lookout point to the lookout point, connected by" "flew" "trials and moderate ascents."</seg>
<seg id="1607">At the last two days there were again many altitude metres.</seg>
<seg id="1608">"caves, rocks, towers, castles, ruins and refuges brought welcome breaks."</seg>
<seg id="1609">In Bad Dürkheim the bikers in the open-air inhalatorium cures Sole.</seg>
<seg id="1610">"also, Neustadt has been headed."</seg>
<seg id="1611">"after 173 kilometres and almost 4500 altimeter, the group had met the Pfälzer Wald from its best side - sporty and culturally."</seg>
<seg id="1612">Console instead of lawn - Bundesliga upgrades for e-sport</seg>
<seg id="1613">"in future, the sports stars are sitting in front of computer consoles, rather than struggling with wind and weather over the stadium race?"</seg>
<seg id="1614">"fact: e-Sport has long become a serious industry, become a lucrative business - big stars, millions of fans and huge tournaments with high scales."</seg>
<seg id="1615">"this also recognized the first public caverns, which are increasingly involved in this area."</seg>
<seg id="1616">"at the beginning of 2015 the VfL Wolfsburg, later the FC Schalke 04 and recently joined the VfB Stuttgart, who founded an e-sports department in mid-July and took two pros for the FIFA 17 computer game."</seg>
<seg id="1617">"we hope to inspire new young audiences for the VfB," says CEO Jochen Röttgermann. "</seg>
<seg id="1618">"it is certain, that on this turn, many associations rise."</seg>
<seg id="1619">"on the next weekend, FIFA organizes the first" "Interactive Club World Cup" "in London, where the gamers compete against each other."</seg>
<seg id="1620">"in addition to Schalke and Wolfsburg, for example, Manchester City, Paris Saint-Germain or the PSV Eindhoven qualify."</seg>
<seg id="1621">Robin Dutt also sees great potential in the e-sport.</seg>
<seg id="1622">The ex-coach of Bayer Leverkusen and Werder Bremen now advises an agency for virtual football players.</seg>
<seg id="1623">"the real football must focus especially with the 14 to 30-year-olds, that young people are still going to the stadium in the future," says the 52-year-old. "</seg>
<seg id="1624">"and: the clubs tried to conquer all sorts of markets, especially the Asian ones."</seg>
<seg id="1625">"with prominent E-sportsmen under contract, one could be online far more often on these markets than once a year to send the Bundesliga to Asia."</seg>
<seg id="1626">What is it all about?</seg>
<seg id="1627">"in the E-sport, computer games such as" League Of Legends, "" Dota 2, "" Counterstrike, "or even the football-simulation FIFA to compete on a competitive level."</seg>
<seg id="1628">"as in normal sports, they have long established liabilities in which the professionals compete against each other."</seg>
<seg id="1629">"and in Asia-games 2022, e-sport is already part of the official programme."</seg>
<seg id="1630">But is it a real sport at all?</seg>
<seg id="1631">"for many, the idea is quite common."</seg>
<seg id="1632">Ingo Frobber also dealt with the question for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="1633">"for the professor at the Deutsche Sporthochschule in Cologne, e-sport is a sport because it is competitive and showing many biological and physical responses that one also find in the classical sport - such as increased heart rates, stress reactions, hormonal changes."</seg>
<seg id="1634">"it also requires cognitive abilities, a technical and tactical understanding and a fast reaction to reaction."</seg>
<seg id="1635">"professional gamers should train not only at the console, but also their bodies and pay attention to the diet."</seg>
<seg id="1636">"the fie player is a good player."</seg>
<seg id="1637">"but also problems:" "doping is becoming more and more a topic." ""</seg>
<seg id="1638">"controls are difficult to perform in online games, and in the scene the structures of classic sports were missing."</seg>
<seg id="1639">The scientist highlights the highly integrative effect of e-sports.</seg>
<seg id="1640">"players are on the move internationally, that's like a big global family, there are no cross-cultural barriers."</seg>
<seg id="1641">A study of the corporate consultancy Deloitte and the Federal Association Interactive entertainment software (BIU) predicts the e-sport a rapid growth.</seg>
<seg id="1642">"in 2016, 50 million euros were implemented in Germany, mainly about advertising, sponsorship and big tournaments."</seg>
<seg id="1643">"in three years, turnover is expected to lie at 130 million."</seg>
<seg id="1644">"against the almost 2.4 billion euros of the Bundesliga, this is little."</seg>
<seg id="1645">"however, the e-sport" is no longer far from other established sports such as handball, basketball or ice hockey. ""</seg>
<seg id="1646">International are many countries already further.</seg>
<seg id="1647">"great markets are Asia and the USA, where ex-basketball players Shaquille O'Neal and Baseballstar Alex Rodriguez participate in the U.S. Team NRG eSports."</seg>

<seg id="1649">There is a lot in Europe too.</seg>

<seg id="1651">"in the Netherlands and France, the football league clubs, according to Dutt, are now obliged to establish an e-sports department."</seg>
<seg id="1652">"in the European comparison, Germany lags behind," explains VfB Board Röttgermann. "</seg>
<seg id="1653">"to fall only in nostalgia and to clarify the old times, it is no longer enough."</seg>
<seg id="1654">"it is a matter of keeping the tradition of the association, but to align the company at the same time on the modern market."</seg>

<seg id="1661">Michelle Carter because of the lyrics that Conrad Roy puts to blame for suicide.</seg>
<seg id="1662">"a woman from Massachusetts was sentenced to two and a half years, because she encouraged her friend through texts and calls for suicide."</seg>
<seg id="1663">"Michelle Carter, now 20, will spend 15 months of her conviction behind bars and five years have been subjected to probation."</seg>
<seg id="1664">Carter was sentenced to Conrad Roy in June because of the negligent killing of Conrad Roy who took life on 13 July 2014.</seg>
<seg id="1665">The father of Roy said on Thursday at the hearing: "my family is intrinsically.</seg>
<seg id="1666">My son was my best friend. "</seg>
<seg id="1667">Carter was allowed to remain free until his appeal.</seg>
<seg id="1668">"she had been confronted with a maximum sentence of 20 years, but her legal representatives argued that both she and Mr Roy suffered from a mental illness."</seg>
<seg id="1669">"dressed in red trousers and a cream coloured blouse, Carter stood with tears in her eyes, folded hands and downward eyes when she was convicted."</seg>
<seg id="1670">"her actions have killed Conrad Roy," said the prosecutor to the court. "</seg>
<seg id="1671">She finished his life to make her own better.</seg>
<seg id="1672">"she has no responsibility," she said. "</seg>
<seg id="1673">"she has shown no remorse."</seg>
<seg id="1674">But Carters lawyer said it was a "terrible circumstance she totally regretted.</seg>
<seg id="1675">"however, judge Lawrence Moniz said, he did not find that her" age or maturity or even her mental illness have a significant impact on their actions. "</seg>
<seg id="1676">"a prosecutor read a statement by Roys's mother Lynn Roy, who said that there is" no day in which I do not feel the loss of my beloved son. "</seg>
<seg id="1677">"I want him to be proud of me and how I turned upside down. I try to be there for eternity with us, in spite of all my pain that we will carry with us for eternity."</seg>
<seg id="1678">"Roys's sister, Camdyn Roy, said that she would never take part in her brother's wedding or be a aunt for his children."</seg>
<seg id="1679">"no longer this only person to have with whom I have been together since my birth, is a pain I will always keep with me for the rest of my life," she said. "</seg>
<seg id="1680">"the case seems to be a legal precedent because there is no law in Massachusetts, which makes it a crime to challenge another, commit suicide."</seg>
<seg id="1681">Carter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead by a carbon monoxide poisoning in a vehicle in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="1682">"the case drew national attention, after Carters revealed text messages that she encouraged him to end his life."</seg>
<seg id="1683">"hanging up, spring of a building, eche yourself, I don't know there are many ways," she said in several news that she had sent in the two weeks before his death, while he was on vacation with his family. "</seg>
<seg id="1684">"in the moments before his suicide she wrote:" you have to do it, Conrad "and" Everything you need to do is to turn on the generator and you will be free and happy. "</seg>
<seg id="1685">Judge Moniz said Carter was seeking attention by the death of Roy and ordered them to benefit from the case by some press.</seg>
<seg id="1686">The case has divided the legal opinion.</seg>
<seg id="1687">"one of the few who defended Carter was Amanda Knox, who was convicted in 2007 for murder on her British roommate in Italy before she was acquitted two years ago."</seg>
<seg id="1688">"Mrs. Knox, 30 years old, published a comment in the Los Angeles Times:" Michelle Carter deserves compassion and help, not prison. "</seg>

<seg id="1694">"the trainer did not announce it," the Confed Cup winner told him after his first deployment as Bavaria Captain. "</seg>
<seg id="1695">"well, the objection could have been better than 0: 2 against SSC Naples."</seg>

<seg id="1698">"as a matter of fact, sugar is distributed to those with a lot of ingredients that one wants to keep in the mood."</seg>
<seg id="1699">"so who was chosen to take the inheritance of Lahm, can only use a little extra motivation."</seg>
<seg id="1700">Kimme confirmed: "that's what you want as a player: take responsibility.</seg>
<seg id="1701">On Wednesday the 22-year-old flared as a mini-lame over the field.</seg>
<seg id="1702">"right back, that's his position, the white bandage on the arm did her rest."</seg>
<seg id="1703">"and in general Kimme worked in this initial formation, like the one who can take the helm best in his hand."</seg>
<seg id="1704">"he gave instructions, trying to direct the unmasked troupe."</seg>
<seg id="1705">"he had the view for the whole, while many others were busy with himself."</seg>
<seg id="1706">"Vidal thus, to overplay his missing fitness (not folded); Renato Sanches therefore, on the devil, get out of the performance of the Asia journey (also just limited); and Sebastian Rudy and Niklas Süle did not negatively drop in their first appearance in the Bayern tricot."</seg>

<seg id="1715">Kimme said goodbye to a few crunchy statements in the back of his new fellow players.</seg>

<seg id="1809">The assassination of a journalist underlines the growing threat in Mexico</seg>
<seg id="1810">"the employees of the Weekly Riodoce usually meet Wednesdays to check their plans for reporting on the recent chaos in the state of Sinaloa by organised crime, corrupt officials and unceasing drug wars."</seg>
<seg id="1811">"but on that day, in the shadow of their own tragedy, they came together to talk about security."</seg>
<seg id="1812">They told them that it is important to change their routines.</seg>
<seg id="1813">"two high-level journalists discuss what is more secure: they should take their children into the office, which were the goal of an attack with grenades in 2009, or leave them home."</seg>
<seg id="1814">"security experts have written three words on a tablet at the front of the room: opponents, neutral, allies."</seg>
<seg id="1815">"they ask the reporters to propose names for each column - no proof is necessary, perceptions and abdominal feelings are enough."</seg>
<seg id="1816">"there are drug smugglers, politicians, businessmen, journalists, who are suspected to stand on the payroll list of the government or the cartels, a catalogue of criminals that make the chaos of Mexico dangerous."</seg>
<seg id="1817">"there is no rest from violence, and throughout the country the corpses are frequent, more and more journalists are involved: at least 25, since President Enrique Pena Nieto joined his office in December 2012."</seg>
<seg id="1818">"among the latter is her publisher and her inspirator of Riodosius, co-founder of Javier Valdez Cardenas."</seg>
<seg id="1819">"the biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and be a journalist," "wrote Valdez in one of his numerous books on violence in connection with drugs."</seg>
<seg id="1820">"his absence becomes deeply felt, although his presence is present everywhere - a large photo of Valdez, which shows his middle finger with the word" Justice, "hangs on the facade of the Richarce building. two reporters in the thirties, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, carry t-shirts that show his smiling face with glasses or his typical panamahut."</seg>
<seg id="1821">"the workshop takes place less than two months after his death, and the reporters discuss their shared issues, trauma, nightmares, sleeplessness, paranoia."</seg>
<seg id="1822">"although a Sonder Attorney General was established in 2010 to process the cases of journalists, it has conducted only two criminal proceedings, according to the Committee for the Protection of Journalists."</seg>
<seg id="1823">"as with most thousands of murders committed every year with drug trafficking and organised crime, the murderers of journalists are rarely brought to justice."</seg>
<seg id="1824">"at Riodosius they still insist on treating the violence of Sinaloa, although they are untrinsically and although the terrain is now more treacherous."</seg>
<seg id="1825">"without information about the murderers, without justice, the meeting to discuss security has little benefit, says Ibarra."</seg>
<seg id="1826">"it is very stupid to waste my time in this workshop," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="1827">"as long as we don't know the why, we mistrust all."</seg>
<seg id="1828">"on the morning of May 15, Valdez left the office of the newspaper Riodosius in the capital of Culiacan."</seg>
<seg id="1829">"he only managed to go a few blocks far before his red Toyota Corolla was stopped by two men. he was forced out of his car and 12 times was shot on him, probably because of the name of the newspaper - which is translated with" "twelve river". ""</seg>
<seg id="1830">The shooter drove away in his car and damaged it nearby.</seg>
<seg id="1831">Valdez was 50 years old.</seg>
<seg id="1832">He left a woman and two adult children.</seg>
<seg id="1833">Rumors tend to fly around in Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1834">But to the topic Valdez there is practically nothing but silence.</seg>
<seg id="1835">"since Guzman's arrest last year and extradition to the United States in January, Sinaloa has become one of the bloodiest battlefields in the country, as rival factions are fighting here to fill the vacuum."</seg>
<seg id="1836">"it doesn't matter that in Sinaloa every day one or more people are shot on the road or that the graveyard is full of decorated, two-storey Mausoleums for drug kings that are larger than many homes for the living."</seg>
<seg id="1837">Forget for a minute that there is a state of "peace" if only a cartel has control over the coastal state with its valuable ports and drug trade routes in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1838">"despite the fact that Valdez had been aware of the dangers of his work, Ismail Bojorquez (60), co-founder and director of Riodosius, broke away with the guilt that he could not protect his friend."</seg>
<seg id="1839">He believes that two misconceptions have contributed to the murder.</seg>
<seg id="1840">"first, in February, the publication of an interview with Damascene Lopez, a leader of one of the rival cartel fractions in the war with Guzmans's sons."</seg>
<seg id="1841">"this publication may have annoyed the sons, presumed aisle members bought each copy of the issue as soon as it was delivered to newspaper kiosks."</seg>
<seg id="1842">"the second mistake was not to force Valdez, after the seizure of another newspaper that had published the same story to leave the country for its own security."</seg>
<seg id="1843">"Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his killing is regarded as a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists."</seg>
<seg id="1844">He had survived so long that his friends and colleagues forgot that he would always be there.</seg>
<seg id="1845">"he was active in 2003 as an experienced reporter for Noroeste, when he joined together with five colleagues for the establishment of Riodoce and sold 50 US dollars."</seg>
<seg id="1846">"in Sinaloa, it was impossible to pursue journalism without violating the drug problem," said Bojorquez. "</seg>
<seg id="1847">"with time, the paper earned a reputation for courageous and honest reporting, and sales and advertising revenue."</seg>
<seg id="1848">"reporters loved to be able to publish harsh investigations without fear of censorship, and readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that no one else dared to handle."</seg>
<seg id="1849">"eight years after the establishment of Riodosius, she received the prestigious" Maria Moors-Cabot Prize "for her coverage in Latin America."</seg>
<seg id="1850">"in the same year, Valdez won the 'International Press Freedom Award' of the Committee for the Protection of Journalists for his courage in pursuing Mexican drug history wherever it was."</seg>
<seg id="1851">He volunteered to be afraid.</seg>
<seg id="1852">"I want to continue living," he said at the time of the CPJ award. "</seg>
<seg id="1853">"drug trafficking in Sinaloa is a way of life," "he said last October in an interview with Rompeviento TV."</seg>
<seg id="1854">You have to take over the task that you as a journalist - either that or you play the dumb.</seg>
<seg id="1855">"I don't want to be asked:" "what have you done in the light of so many dead... why did you not say what was going on?"</seg>
<seg id="1856">"the Richarce team misses Valdez, the Spaßvogel, who was able to curb like a dockman, the friend who was generously with hugs and advice, a teacher who knew how to survive."</seg>
<seg id="1857">They trusted in his routine.</seg>
<seg id="1858">He would always carry his hat.</seg>
<seg id="1859">"he would always go to El Guayabo, the bar opposite the office, and always sit at the same table."</seg>
<seg id="1860">"now they ask, Is his love for routine his spoilage?"</seg>
<seg id="1861">"his death, too, forced her to question her own assumptions about how to best do her work and stay alive."</seg>
<seg id="1862">"they don't like it when you deal with their wives, their children, their clean shops, their secret home and landing ways to move drugs."</seg>
<seg id="1863">"these things were not allowed," "said Bojorquez."</seg>
<seg id="1864">"the result is, even in the best times, a high level of self-censorship and self-preservation."</seg>
<seg id="1865">Trust his own instincts.</seg>
<seg id="1866">"if it smells wrong, stay away from it."</seg>
<seg id="1867">"the anger is, the editor of the Richarce Andres Villarreal said that" "smell is a sense that can be deceived... and then the matter is happening with Javier."</seg>
<seg id="1868">"the old rules, as he and others say, are no longer valid in Sinaloa - just as in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states in which a poisonous mixture of lucrative smuggling routes, weak institutions and corrupt government officials are at home."</seg>
<seg id="1869">The landscape is constantly changing.</seg>
<seg id="1870">"in the space where the employees of Riodosius met security training, no cell phones were allowed. days before, it was known that Spyware, which is exclusively sold to governments, was used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico."</seg>
<seg id="1871">"outside, two policemen sought protection from the heat of 104 degrees (40 ° C) in the shade of a tree."</seg>
<seg id="1872">They were commissioned by the provincial government to protect the offices of Riodoce in a four-storey building in a mid-size neighborhood of Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1873">"half in the joke, some of the reporters asked whether these officers were among the 50 percent of the policemen, which the governor described himself as untrustworthy."</seg>
<seg id="1874">"it is months since the reporters have gone into the mountain landscape, where the drug gangs are de facto under control."</seg>
<seg id="1875">"for the issue of this week, Riodosius gave birth to three main stories."</seg>
<seg id="1876">There was the assassination of the brother of the former famous Boxers Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa.</seg>
<seg id="1877">"they also had an exposure to the government spending, which concentrated on the home town of the governor."</seg>
<seg id="1878">"and there was a group located in one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan, a block away from the Office of the Prosecutor, a kidnapping."</seg>
<seg id="1879">"there was no official word about who was kidnapped or as it happened, so caution was advised when it was time to write what everyone in the city knows: that the restaurant is a favourite local of drug dealers and authorities."</seg>
<seg id="1880">"a reporter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician, who ruled the governing Institutional Revolution Party (PRI), which dominated all the political levels almost the entire century."</seg>
<seg id="1881">"recently, several PRI governors have been accused of high-calibre cases of corruption."</seg>
<seg id="1882">"Villarreal asked the reporter to write about previous incidents in this locale, including one in which a son of" El Chapo "Guzman escaped a military attack."</seg>
<seg id="1883">"only a few months earlier, readers would have seen the column of Valdez as the best informed source of kidnapping."</seg>
<seg id="1884">"we had already known what happened," Villarreal said 46, with the nickname "El Flaco" because of his slender body stature. "</seg>
<seg id="1885">"now all channels of communication are broken with our sources."</seg>
<seg id="1886">"the office of Valdez has been transformed into a storage space for signs and stickers, which protesting against the murders of journalists, because the employees have become something they never expected: activists in the name of the press."</seg>
<seg id="1887">Reporter Miriam Ramirez grabbed a few signs and went to a demonstration on the next morning for a demonstration on the office of the prosecutor's office.</seg>
<seg id="1888">"Salvador Adame disappeared three days after Valdez had been killed, in the Western state of Michoacan."</seg>
<seg id="1889">"a burned body has been discovered and officials say, based on DNA testing that it is its."</seg>
<seg id="1890">"throughout the country, journalists have become louvers by writing in organized protests" SOS Press "on walkways and buildings."</seg>
<seg id="1891">"on this day, the director Bojorquez is gone in Washington and tries to gather international support for the judiciary in the Valdez case."</seg>
<seg id="1892">"at a meeting with the Governor of Sinaloa on the day after the assassination of Valdez, Ramirez accused the authorities to spy on journalists and bring them around because they told the truth."</seg>
<seg id="1893">"she has since been asked to re-divide her from the government, because she is concerned that her anger has hurt her objectivity."</seg>
<seg id="1894">"Valdez had repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico were surrounded by organised crime, government officials and a social society."</seg>
<seg id="1895">"in his last book" "Narco-Journalism", "he wrote that reporters were not only killed by drug gangs, but also by command of politicians and security forces committed by organised crime under a blanket."</seg>
<seg id="1896">"last year, the media group" Articulo 19 "has been assigned more than half of the attacks on journalists of the police and officials."</seg>
<seg id="1897">"in Mexico you die because they want you to keep your mouth," "said Ramirez."</seg>
<seg id="1898">Obviously the killers have a deterrent effect.</seg>
<seg id="1899">Nobody forgets the death of the blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias in the northern border state Tamaulipas six years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1900">"her body was found along with a note that was supposedly signed by Zetas-Kartell," Here I am because of my reports. "</seg>
<seg id="1901">A computer keyboard and headphones were placed next to their separate head.</seg>
<seg id="1902">Some branches have chosen to close as the newspaper El Norte in the northern border state of Chihuahua after the assassination of correspondent Miroslava Breach in March.</seg>
<seg id="1903">Others continue to do as El Manana of Nuevo Laredo did after the assassination of her director in 2004.</seg>
<seg id="1904">"in 2010, the Diario de Ciudad Juarez publicly set itself on the drug cartelle with a editorial on the front page with the title" What do you want from us? "</seg>
<seg id="1905">Some journalists have fled from their home countries or even from the country.</seg>
<seg id="1906">It is a painful decision.</seg>
<seg id="1907">"it is hard to find work in exile, and they still watch the streets and search for dangers."</seg>
<seg id="1908">"and sometimes they are hunted, as evidently the photographer Ruben Espinosa, who was murdered in 2015 together with four women in an apartment in Mexico City three months after the escape from Veracruz."</seg>
<seg id="1909">"for those who remain behind and continue the work, it is a daily dance with risky decisions."</seg>
<seg id="1910">"Ibarra, who once wanted to be a poet, indicates that drug trafficking is troubled."</seg>
<seg id="1911">"Mexico goes to hell, and therefore I became reporter," he said. "</seg>
<seg id="1912">"at midnight on last Friday, when the last issue was already finished, the editors of Riodoce sat on the sidewalk in front of the office and drank beers when all their phones began summing."</seg>
<seg id="1913">A series of shootings with rival rivals and security forces near the seaside resort Mazatlan had left 19 confirmed dead.</seg>
<seg id="1914">The war continues to escalate as promised by a series of Kartell messages in the region.</seg>
<seg id="1915">"from the edge of the board, they released the news on the website of Riodosia about mobile phones."</seg>
<seg id="1916">The front page had to be changed the next day.</seg>
<seg id="1917">Sirens are waiting nearby - another shooting in the area.</seg>
<seg id="1918">Bojorquez threw a look at the policemen who kept watch to see if they were in readiness.</seg>
<seg id="1919">"if they were afraid, they did not show it."</seg>
<seg id="1920">"under the massive portrait of the fallen founder of the newspaper, whose middle finger was visible for quite Sinaloa, the staff of Riodosius followed his traces."</seg>
<seg id="1921">"how can you only think about it," "said Bojorquez," "if on the same day, on which Javier was murdered, the intern asked me to send her to the reporting on the street."</seg>
<seg id="1922">Dinosaur used camouflage to avoid its enemies</seg>
<seg id="1923">"at first glance, it looks like a statue, though a frightening."</seg>
<seg id="1924">Now researchers found that the first findings of the unbelievable rhinoceros of a Canadian miner were so well received that experts described it as "Mona Lisa der Dinosaurs."</seg>
<seg id="1925">"it was so good that they could even find that his scaly skin was of reddish brown - and they said that she had something of a" "restless past." ""</seg>
<seg id="1926">"the report in the journal" Current Biology "described him as" the starved dinosaurs, who was ever found, and one of the best dinosaurs specimens in the world. "</seg>
<seg id="1927">"the fossil is a newly discovered species of Nodosaurier, which lived in the middle of the circle-time between 110 million and 112 million years ago."</seg>
<seg id="1928">"its incredibly well-preserved state has astonished researchers, which describe it as" really remarkable. ""</seg>
<seg id="1929">"according to reports in National Geographic, the armored herbivores is the best preserved fossil of its kind."</seg>
<seg id="1930">"it was found by Shawn Funk, when he arrived in the Suncor Millenium mine near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta, Canada, grub."</seg>
<seg id="1931">"he met something out of the surrounding rock, and decided to look more closely."</seg>
<seg id="1932">The fossil discovered by him was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology.</seg>
<seg id="1933">"they spent the next six years to uncover the wild beast within the 2,500 pounds (1,100 kg) of heavy ground."</seg>
<seg id="1934">"after all this hard work, the finished result is now ready to be revealed."</seg>
<seg id="1935">"if you just blinking a little with your eyes, you could almost believe that it slept," said the main author Caleb Brown, scientist at the Royal Tyrrell Museum where the creature is to be seen. "</seg>
<seg id="1936">"it will enter the history of science as one of the most beautiful and best preserved dinosaurs specimens - Mona Lisa, the dinosaur."</seg>
<seg id="1937">"researchers found out that this herbivores, although it is covered with an armor and resembles a shifting tank, probably threatened by meat-eating dinosaurs."</seg>
<seg id="1938">"the heavily armoured Dinosaur used a red and white camouflage to hide from predators, and used an shielding technique known as counterfeiting, which is also used by many modern animals."</seg>
<seg id="1939">"this would have allowed it to get better in its surroundings and to avoid its enemies, experts say what it suggests that it was threatened by larger dinosaurs."</seg>
<seg id="1940">The 110 million years old creature from the Nodosaurier family has been headlines for the first time in May and can now be seen in the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.</seg>
<seg id="1941">"researchers have now studied the wild animal and called it Borealopelta markmitchelli after the museum engineer Mark Mitchell, one of a team that has spent more than 7.000 hours to cover it carefully."</seg>
<seg id="1942">"the astonishing preservation of the specimen made it possible to document Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists, the pattern and the form of scales and armor over his body."</seg>
<seg id="1943">"they discovered the shadowing, a widespread defense method in the animal kingdom, which means that the top of the creature was darker than its underside."</seg>
<seg id="1944">"although the shadowing is common, the results are surprising as the size of Borealopelta by far exceeds the animals living today."</seg>
<seg id="1945">"it suggests that the dinosaurs was hunted by meat-eating dinosaurs, that evolution favored the concealment of confrontation as a means of survival."</seg>
<seg id="1946">"but most contemporary animals that use the shadowage - think of roe deer, zebras or belt-animals - are much smaller and vulnerable than loot, which signals that this Nodosaurier was exposed to a real struggle for survival."</seg>
<seg id="1947">"powerful predatory behavior on a massive, strongly armoured dinosaur show how dangerous the dinosaurs predators have to have been the Cretaceous period," "said Brown."</seg>
<seg id="1948">The chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the skin of the dinosaur was bay.</seg>
<seg id="1949">Scientists continue to investigate the animal on clues about his life including his conserved Darminate to find out what it has eaten as his last meal.</seg>
<seg id="1950">"they believe that the dinosaur, when he died, fell into a river and drove out into the sea, where he sank on the back to the sea floor."</seg>
<seg id="1951">"at this time Alberta was as warm as South-florida today, and rivers and oceans probably much farther than they are today."</seg>
<seg id="1952">"this Nodosaurier is really remarkable because it is completely covered with conserved scaly skin, but also preserved in three dimensions and maintains the original shape of the animal," "said Brown."</seg>
<seg id="1953">The result is that the animal looks almost exactly the same today as in the early chalk time.</seg>
<seg id="1954">"you do not need to use a lot of imagination to reconstruct it. if you play only a little with the eyes, you could almost believe that he is at sleep."</seg>
<seg id="1955">"the time was a time when huge theropods, carnivorous dinosaur, who were standing on two legs, crossed the earth."</seg>
<seg id="1956">"although the king of them, the Tyrannosaurus Rex, lived millions of years after Borealopelta, the armored dinosaur was hunted by some of his fearful ancestors."</seg>
<seg id="1957">"this includes the Acrocanthosaurus, a 38 feet (11.5 m) long, six tons of heavy monsters."</seg>
<seg id="1958">"the scientists, whose latest findings appear in the journal Current Biology, believe that Borealopelta was drowned at sea after death and mumified in mud."</seg>
<seg id="1959">"the creature was found by Shawn Funk, when he was buried on 21 March 2011 at the Suncor Millenium mine near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta, Canada."</seg>
<seg id="1960">"according to the museum, it is the upholstered dinosaur of the world, including skin and armor, and is completely from the muzzle to the hip."</seg>
<seg id="1961">"the creatures were about 18 feet (5 meters) long and weighed up to 3,000 pounds (1,300 kg)."</seg>
<seg id="1962">It contained two 20-inch long tips that raged from his shoulders.</seg>
<seg id="1963">The researchers believe that the armored herbivores were swelled by Western Canada until a flooded river flooded it into the open sea.</seg>
<seg id="1964">But the water repayment of the dinosaur kept his armour in exquisite detail.</seg>
<seg id="1965">The petrified remains of this special specimen are preserved so well that the house ste still covers repeatable armoured plates along the dinosaur</seg>
<seg id="1966">"as Michael Greshko has written for National Geographic, such a level of conservation is as' rare as a winning lottery."</seg>
<seg id="1967">"the more I approach it, the more confusing it becomes."</seg>
<seg id="1968">"petrified remains of the skin still cover the bumpy armored plates, which carry the skull of the animal."</seg>
<seg id="1969">"his right forefoot is on his side, his five fingers are split upwards."</seg>
<seg id="1970">I can count the scales on its sole.</seg>

<seg id="1976">"at first, there are no indications of the exact number of the injured."</seg>
<seg id="1977">"it was a slight to moderate injury, said a police spokesman."</seg>
<seg id="1978">A large number of rescue vehicles was at the accident site.</seg>

<seg id="1986">Deutsche Bahn: group tests "Comfort Check-in"</seg>
<seg id="1987">It is a moment that almost everyone has experienced: nothing can be found in the train and sleep.</seg>
<seg id="1988">Or one is deepened into his work and has just a brilliant thought.</seg>
<seg id="1989">And then: buffering.</seg>
<seg id="1990">Comes the conductor and wakes up an unsanft or irritates the passenger in the middle of the workflow.</seg>
<seg id="1991">Check-in / check-out.</seg>
<seg id="1992">But the times of interruptions are over soon.</seg>
<seg id="1993">The Deutsche Bahn is currently testing the free ticket inspections.</seg>
<seg id="1994">You just confirm by phone that you take your seat and devaluate the ticket.</seg>
<seg id="1995">"currently, a test runs on two routes."</seg>
<seg id="1996">"when the offer goes, we expand it."</seg>
<seg id="1997">"it will probably be available in Germany at the beginning of next year," "said S & D spokesman."</seg>
<seg id="1998">"comfort check-in" is called by train the ticket devaluation without Schaffner.</seg>
<seg id="1999">"in order to be able to use them, however, some requirements must be met: you need a smartphone or tablet."</seg>
<seg id="2000">And you have to book an online ticket - what already most passengers do.</seg>
<seg id="2001">"it is also necessary to have bought it via the train, the DB Navigator, which is the most convenient way of ticket booking."</seg>
<seg id="2002">And finally you need a seat reservation.</seg>
<seg id="2003">"because the" "comfort check-in" "works so: one climbs into the train, calling his ticket to" My Tickets. ""</seg>
<seg id="2004">A button for electronic devaluation appears at the test customers.</seg>
<seg id="2005">The train attendants get a message on their mobile devices that passenger X is on the train and took the booked seat Y.</seg>
<seg id="2006">"when the train attendant arrives at room Y, he knows that there is a passenger with already discharged online ticket."</seg>
<seg id="2007">"so you can continue to sleep, continue working, keep silence."</seg>
<seg id="2008">"check-in has two advantages: one for the customer, one for the train - which in turn should use passengers."</seg>
<seg id="2009">"who wants to travel relaxed without ticket inspections by our train attendant, check the DB Navigator for yourself."</seg>
<seg id="2010">"this allows passengers to make their travel time in the train more personal," says Michael Peterson, the marketing board of DB Fernverkehr. "</seg>
<seg id="2011">"second plus:" "and our employees have more time than today to respond to individual customer needs."</seg>
<seg id="2012">"those who often travel, know that in addition to delays and missed trains, the ticket inspections belong to the biggest annoyances."</seg>
<seg id="2013">"in any case, however, one of the contributors does not have all the documents required to devaluation of online tickets."</seg>
<seg id="2014">Either the credit card or the ID card or otherwise a document you have to assign.</seg>
<seg id="2015">"the result is endless discussions between the train attendants and passenger, which leads to poor sentiment in the section or large room and delays in controlling your own tickets and the conductor ends at the end time to take care of other matters."</seg>
<seg id="2016">Only a small number of test customers can use the new service.</seg>
<seg id="2017">And this applies only to the connections ICE 915 Dortmund-Stuttgart and ICE 912 Stuttgart-Essen.</seg>
<seg id="2018">Further train numbers on the same route are not yet unlocked.</seg>

<seg id="2023">"the police have just killed a 18-year-old child, and it is still on the road."</seg>
<seg id="2024">"confused, as no one else had posted the information on their feed, she closed Facebook and opened Twitter."</seg>
<seg id="2025">A user with the Handle @ TheePharoah was constantly delivered on her timeline.</seg>
<seg id="2026">"the rapper from the area of St. Louis was the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed black 18-year-old, who was killed by a white policeman in Ferguson, Mo., was killed live to tweeten."</seg>
<seg id="2027">"he posted a picture of Browns alive bodies stretched out on the street, and there would stay four hours there."</seg>
<seg id="2028">"that's wild," "said Ferrell."</seg>
<seg id="2029">But death was nothing new for her and her community.</seg>
<seg id="2030">She turned her cell phone to return to tweets on the Canfield-Drive later in the evening.</seg>
<seg id="2031">"there were photos from the police band and people crying out, and of a man who claimed to be the father's father, who carried a sign with the inscription:" Ferguson police has just killed my unarmed son! "</seg>
<seg id="2032">"she observed a live feed, where a policeman stood before a group of demonstrators with a barking dog."</seg>
<seg id="2033">"in another video, she said, a different policeman said," "I'm going to kill you... animals all kill you."</seg>
<seg id="2034">"this is not usual," Ferrell remembered her statement. "</seg>
<seg id="2035">This is not the kind of murder that we have accustomed to and which we can call typical.</seg>
<seg id="2036">At that moment I felt chills.</seg>
<seg id="2037">I was furious and wept. "</seg>
<seg id="2038">She booked a return flight and went home the next day.</seg>
<seg id="2039">After the landing at 23 o'clock she took off her 6-year-old daughter from her father's house and decided that the two would drive to Ferguson the next morning.</seg>
<seg id="2040">"what happened in the following three years with Ferrell and Ferguson, is the theme of a new documentary," Whose Streets?, "in cinemas from 11."</seg>
<seg id="2041">"it is a history of survival and protest, love and loss, strength and resistance, which consists of the point of view of the people who live in community and have filled the streets to demand answers."</seg>
<seg id="2042">"as Ferrell with her daughter who carried a flower dress and a matching crown to Ferguson, the two were talking about the black experience and the black condition many times before this morning."</seg>
<seg id="2043">"you remember how I taught you when black people have to fight for what they believe?" "she remembered what she said."</seg>
<seg id="2044">"we are now going to Ferguson, because the police killed a 18-year-old boy and that wasn't right."</seg>
<seg id="2045">"I could not take them," "Ferrell said later."</seg>
<seg id="2046">What is happening today is a highlight of what happened in the past.</seg>
<seg id="2047">It must know and see it and be raised in it.</seg>
<seg id="2048">"it must be well developed not only activism and organisation, but also the different layers of black experience and the black constitution and what we must do to free ourselves."</seg>
<seg id="2049">"even if I have the luck to give her an experience in which she personally does not experience disgusting racism, she is no different from the next black women child."</seg>
<seg id="2050">"I feel, I would give her a bad service to keep her away from it."</seg>
<seg id="2051">"the first stop, when they arrived at Ferguson, was located at the South Florissant Road, a place opposite the police authority that became a campground when activists were waiting for the possible non-indictment of Officer Darren Wilson."</seg>
<seg id="2052">"there, Ferrell and her daughter joined with a local business owner who made lunch."</seg>
<seg id="2053">They prepared pockets and helped to pass them on to demonstrators.</seg>
<seg id="2054">Slowly a new type of activism began to take shape for Ferrell's shape.</seg>
<seg id="2055">"my activism has changed completely after 9 August," she said and notices that she was a student at the University of Missouri-St. Louis President of the Minority Student Nurses Association and focused on eating justice and health inequalities in black communities. "</seg>
<seg id="2056">"I had no experience in organizing.</seg>
<seg id="2057">It is all come. "</seg>
<seg id="2058">"weeks later Ferrell met during an evening demonstration, Sabaah Folayan, one of the co-directors of the film."</seg>
<seg id="2059">"Folayan said, she and her cameraman Lucas Alvarado Farrar just wanted to" document "what happened."</seg>
<seg id="2060">"a question came from Ferrell in the sense:" "do you want to document or try to find a story you can use?"</seg>
<seg id="2061">"this skepticism was nourished by countless cases of people, often from whites - in a community that benefited from their pain and their resilience."</seg>
<seg id="2062">"as Folayan recently stated in an interview:" "we heard that people born and raised in Ferguson have not centered their voices and we wanted to do it differently."</seg>
<seg id="2063">"Folayan had already collaborated with the then co-director Damon Davis, an artist from the area known for his activism around Todestrakt detainees."</seg>
<seg id="2064">"his commitment brought the project closer to Ferrell, along with six other locals followed the team of" Whose Streets? "in the years after Browns shooting."</seg>
<seg id="2065">"this documentary is not someone who speaks for us or talks to us. we talk," Davis said. "</seg>
<seg id="2066">"that was the main thing for me as these people are represented, for so I will be represented."</seg>
<seg id="2067">"the goal was not to focus on Ferral's experience - to show that the movement" is not a Messiah guide, but a community that comes together, "said Folayan - she proved to be the most obvious participant of the film."</seg>
<seg id="2068">"as a result, documents of" "Whose Streets" "show surprising personal aspects of Ferr's life as she falls in love and marries her wife."</seg>
<seg id="2069">"I felt like naked," "said Ferrell and laughed when she saw the finished product for the first time."</seg>
<seg id="2070">But I understood that there must be some vulnerability in this work and in the humanisation of black people.</seg>
<seg id="2071">"in addition, Ferrell's history repeats the role of black gay women in the wider Black-Lives-Matter movement."</seg>
<seg id="2072">"two of the three founders of the Movement, which after the killing of the black teenager Trayvon Martin in 2012 have shaped the film" "BlackRock Matter" "in social media, identify themselves as gay."</seg>
<seg id="2073">"black, gay women in leadership positions have carried the movement overall," said Ferrell, "and therefore we constantly fight at different fronts."</seg>
<seg id="2074">"black, gay women must bear the main burden of everything."</seg>
<seg id="2075">"Folayan agreed to notice that" "the movement is really maintained by black women and many black women."</seg>
<seg id="2076">"however, it insists that" this is not an affirmative type of action, "when Ferrell was chosen as the heart of the film due to their identity."</seg>
<seg id="2077">"she was the person who shook this energy," she said. "</seg>
<seg id="2078">"it is no coincidence, even though it was at the forefront of the front, because in a life at these crossings as a black, gay woman stands as much on the game."</seg>
<seg id="2079">You can feel your energy through the screen. "</seg>
<seg id="2080">"in the meantime, the telecommunications networks in Ferguson have long since disappeared, but the racial ties between the church and the police continue to exist."</seg>
<seg id="2081">Ferrell is on parole for 2 ½ years because of blocking a highway at a demonstration.</seg>
<seg id="2082">She describes the social-political atmosphere of the area she calls her home: "a chaos."</seg>
<seg id="2083">"nevertheless, she lacks a voice and she feels bound to this memory, since she went on the street three years ago in Ferguson."</seg>
<seg id="2084">It is our duty to fight for our freedom.</seg>
<seg id="2085">It is our duty to win.</seg>
<seg id="2086">We must love and support each other.</seg>
<seg id="2087">We have nothing to lose - except our chains. "</seg>
<seg id="2088">From "dream" to "megalomania": TV readers discuss bit gallery</seg>
<seg id="2089">"the bit gallery moves the people, even though it is not built for a long time."</seg>
<seg id="2090">But the idea of a shopping centre at the south end of the pedestrian zone has since the first presentation in 2009 split the population into advocates and opponents.</seg>
<seg id="2091">The topic hardly leaves one.</seg>
<seg id="2092">"also on our Facebook page" "Volksfreund Bitburg" "the topic is discussed."</seg>
<seg id="2093">"while the one to the bit gallery say," "that would be a dream" "(Anja Becker) or" "That would be really great" "(Nicole Schausten), comes from the other side:" "no man" "(Siggi Betzen) or simply:" "megalomania" "(Lars Scholz)."</seg>
<seg id="2094">"while the supporters build that a gallery attracts more customers to the city, from which the rest of the shops will benefit, the opponents fear that the pedestrian zone is bleeding."</seg>
<seg id="2095">"in addition, the gallery is planned exactly on the property where the farmer's market hall stands, in which 13 direct marketers offer their products."</seg>
<seg id="2096">"with the beginning of construction work, it will be an end."</seg>
<seg id="2097">"the gallery makers want to integrate a market hall into the new building - to the Beda Square, with possibility to sit outside."</seg>
<seg id="2098">Simone Zimmer: "we have been shopping for almost every week in the farmer's market hall for many years.</seg>
<seg id="2099">"mainly our eggs, but also the delicious cakes of the landlady gladly again."</seg>
<seg id="2100">We also discovered the butcher shop for us.</seg>
<seg id="2101">We would wish that even during and especially after the construction of the gallery there is a chance to maintain this offer.</seg>
<seg id="2102">In other cities there is also.</seg>
<seg id="2103">Especially the small market hall in Frankfurt is interesting. "</seg>
<seg id="2104">Gerd Densing: "whether directly marketed in a market hall in the gallery depends on the amount of rent.</seg>
<seg id="2105">"however, this might not be low in the new project."</seg>
<seg id="2106">"Eva Kilic:" "why shopping cartels in Bitburg?"</seg>
<seg id="2107">"clothing, shoes, drugstores or supermarkets: I find that superfluous."</seg>
<seg id="2108">There is already enough in our city.</seg>
<seg id="2109">You see how many shops here stand empty - some for months and years.</seg>
<seg id="2110">"but since there is not even a regular weekly market, it is all the more important that at least the market hall is preserved."</seg>
<seg id="2111">"after all, the goods offered there are fresh, mostly offered directly by the producer and is also inexpensive."</seg>
<seg id="2112">"as you can see, store shops in a shopping centre are only rented by larger companies, because the rentals there are often not payable for a retailer."</seg>
<seg id="2113">"sorry, there is no translation for this news-article."</seg>
<seg id="2114">Wolf Fandel: "a shopping mall with a market hall does not fit for me.</seg>
<seg id="2115">And the gallery does not fit to Bitburg.</seg>
<seg id="2116">Above all: where should the Farmers Market stand during the construction period?</seg>
<seg id="2117">The old Edeka would be the solution - even if the bit gallery actually comes.</seg>
<seg id="2118">Or does the Gespenst Bit gallery already manage to drive all shops from Bitburg before?</seg>
<seg id="2119">George Marquet: "this will simply not work.</seg>
<seg id="2120">"and a shopping center that is empty, nobody needs."</seg>
<seg id="2121">"in my opinion it would have been better to promote a real farmer's market, instead of this gallery."</seg>
<seg id="2122">"but for a farmer's market hall, thanks to the insane many - as I find - senseless construction projects in Bitburg no longer place a place."</seg>
<seg id="2123">"if the farmer's market hall is broken, a piece of culture will disappear again."</seg>
<seg id="2124">A matching similarity: artist creates portraits with Chelsea Mannings DNA</seg>
<seg id="2125">"in the middle of the space of the Fridman Gallery in New York many faces can be seen - white, black and brown, which almost resemble themselves - those on cables hanging from the ceiling."</seg>
<seg id="2126">The 30 portraits were created by the artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from cheeks and haircuts that were sent to her by Chelsea Manning.</seg>
<seg id="2127">"Manning sent the excerpts from the prison Fort Leavenworth, where former intelligence analyst allied a 35-year prison sentence after it publicly proclaimed diplomatic messages about the WikiLeaks website."</seg>
<seg id="2128">"the new exhibition, which was opened on August 2, is called A Becoming resemblance (A suitable resemblance)."</seg>
<seg id="2129">"she is the product of two years of correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, whose discipline united her expertise in technology, computer science and art, and Manning, a transexual and pioneering discourse, whose condemnation was transformed by Barack Obama, when he had only three days in his office."</seg>
<seg id="2130">"dewey-Hagborg has been created by algorithmic analysis of DNA, which was extracted from Manning and created out of the 30 portraits, as someone with these genomic data could look, a sharp as well as something intellectual comment not only to the formability of DNA data - the many ways in which they can be interpreted and the inherent determinism of these interpretations - but also for identity."</seg>
<seg id="2131">"Manning, who was born as Bradley Edward, but has already been openly discussed since her puberty about identification as a woman, was condemned in 2013 for 20 charges, including six violations of the espionage law, computer fraud and theft."</seg>
<seg id="2132">"her picture was suppressed by the prison, so much that there was only one picture - a grainy black-white selfie in which Manning is visibly uncomfortable at a driver's seat and carries a platinblonde wig - associated with her."</seg>
<seg id="2133">"in 2015, Dewey-Hagborg came from the big success of her 2012 project 'Stranger Visions'."</seg>
<seg id="2134">"in this, the artist produced portraits of foreign artefacts like cigarette dumb and chewing gum by extracting the DNA from the waste to produce an image of how these people might look like."</seg>
<seg id="2135">That was the time when she received an e-mail from a newspaper magazine.</seg>
<seg id="2136">"they conducted an interview with Chelsea Manning while she was in prison, and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article," "declared Dewey-Hagborg at a press preview of the new exhibition."</seg>
<seg id="2137">"and she could not be photographed at that time and she could not be photographed, so you took contact with Chelsea and asked her if she wanted to make a DNA portrait."</seg>
<seg id="2138">The artist and her imprisoned muse became uneven briphews which exchanged several letters over the course of two years.</seg>
<seg id="2139">"they even created a comic illustrated by Shoili Kanungo, who foresaw a future in which the President would transform Chelny judgment and would be able to see the exhibition personally."</seg>
<seg id="2140">"that Obama indeed was only a few days after the book was published, Mannings released release after seven brutal years in a military prison in Kansas, was a welcome way of happy coincidence."</seg>
<seg id="2141">"there is also something deep and strong at the opening of the exhibition, as Donald Trump introduces a war against informants from the government camp and against transgender forces to find new, tweetable ways to solve the rigid splits that it should actually fix."</seg>
<seg id="2142">"when Dewey-Hagborg was asked for the strange timing of all these things, she said that things happen for a particular reason."</seg>
<seg id="2143">"in a artistic statement written on the wall of the gallery, Manning asked with its oversized signature (the" "i" "in their surname is provided with a heart) an end to" automatic fragmentation, based on gender, race, sexuality and culture. "</seg>
<seg id="2144">"on the opposite wall, their mitochondrial DNA sequence - a thousandler of Cs and Gs and As, is written in pencil."</seg>
<seg id="2145">"Dewey-Hagborg hoped to show through the inclusion of 200 letters (or nucleotides according to the highly developed scientific encyclopedia of the artist), as surprisingly similar, at least in biological ways, we are all."</seg>
<seg id="2146">"what people will hopefully bring along, is that our genome doesn't care about who we are and how openly genetic data is for an interpretation and how subjective it is," "said Dewey-Hagborg, whose video works of 2007, Spicy Memories, also to be seen."</seg>
<seg id="2147">"DNA data can tell so many different stories, so the 30 of these stories are."</seg>
<seg id="2148">"the last piece in the exhibition, stored in a separate room, is a page from the above mentioned comic novel."</seg>
<seg id="2149">She shows Manning as she appears with an open spree in her hand from the disciplinarian barracks of the United States like King Kong.</seg>
<seg id="2150">"if they put your speech, then they have won," says it. "</seg>
<seg id="2151">"so, never stop the mouth."</seg>
<seg id="2152">"it came directly from a letter that she wrote to me," "said the artist, who greetings from Philadelphia."</seg>
<seg id="2153">I still get goose when I talk about it.</seg>
<seg id="2154">"Manning has not seen the exhibition personally - just as it was anticipated in the comic book - but if it was supposed to do it, it will be greeted in the middle of the room by the masks, from their own genomic simulacels that coincide like hordes of protesters."</seg>
<seg id="2155">"it was also targeted, like everything in the exhibition, up to the size (5" 2, "man's stature), in which their genetic Haploy groups were written with pencil."</seg>
<seg id="2156">"in the past I had them on the wall, but I wanted them to feel like a crowd," "said Dewey-Hagborg."</seg>
<seg id="2157">"I wanted it to feel like a mass movement that formed with Chelsea, like the movement which was hiding behind its liberation."</seg>

<seg id="2260">It starts at 23 o'clock when a lot of UCLA Footballplayers are talking on a page of the new practice fields of the team on campus.</seg>
<seg id="2261">Some have pulled off their trousers parts and show the back full of sweat from the first day of the training camp.</seg>
<seg id="2262">"for a good part of the team, these idle minutes are a lunch break."</seg>
<seg id="2263">Players who are registered to the summer courses will return to their final audits after the three-hour exercise before they return to the Wasserman Football Center the next morning.</seg>
<seg id="2264">"that's for the guys the next three days a real treadmill," "said Bruins-Trainer Jim Mora shortly before the Monday became Tuesday."</seg>
<seg id="2265">"the NCAA eliminates two-day exercises to ease the load of the players, and it actually extended their days - at least until the final on Friday."</seg>
<seg id="2266">"therefore, the first three sessions of the UCLA at 19: 15 should start to meet the already fully packed schedule of the players."</seg>
<seg id="2267">"the compromise away from the two days is more than a day when the bruins were postponed to the beginning of the camp almost a week after the last season, and during the summer school for the first time during Moras performed practical exercises in Westwood for the first time."</seg>
<seg id="2268">They should hold 18 exercises during August. 20 before the start of formal preparations for their prelude to Texas A & M in September.</seg>
<seg id="2269">"Mora said that he supported the rules change of NCAA, even if they add another point to the busy routes of the player."</seg>

<seg id="2290">Creating a comic novel: a castle in the history of England</seg>
<seg id="2291">In his recent past the little Scotney Castle was to be seen in a squeeze music video and was a loophole for Margaret Thatcher in the 1970-s and 1980-s.</seg>
<seg id="2292">"but Scotney has experienced 700 years of turbulent history from its cozy seat in the Bewl River Valley in Kent, and now has become an inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rhodes, a mophaaric Yorkshireman with a preference for historical documents."</seg>
<seg id="2293">"I find it so beautiful to look at the manuscript of someone who has been dead for 300 years," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="2294">What a personal relationship to keep this letter in my hand.</seg>
<seg id="2295">"a Castle in England is spanning the period from the Middle Ages to the Age of Edward and documents the families that lived in Scotney. each story was illustrated by another, emerging British artist - Isaac Lenkiewicz, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer and Isabel Greenberg."</seg>
<seg id="2296">"it is not the first book of Rhodes that is based on an archive: he wrote 2014 'Dead Men's Teeth and Other Stories', a collection that was inspired by documents in the British Library - a project that he found unexpectedly emotional."</seg>
<seg id="2297">"I only responded to the thumb pressure on the side of a letter, which was written by a double agent in the 1700's, who worked for the Jacobins," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="2298">"" "this is his thumb pressure!"</seg>
<seg id="2299">"and letters always smell smoke, for at that time one burned a fire for the light."</seg>
<seg id="2300">"for someone who lives 300 years later, the smell has an effect as if he himself would be there."</seg>
<seg id="2301">"Oh, I love archives!"</seg>
<seg id="2302">"for someone who is so beaten with old papers that he is supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council England and lived for almost four months in a castle (" "To be honest: I've overrated my welcome greeting" ") it all seems too nice to be true."</seg>
<seg id="2303">"Rhodes spent his days exploring the Victorian" "new" "castle to see the archives and study the many treasures and curiosities of the castle, such as the mounted hybrids on the walls and the bottles that had spent centuries in ditch."</seg>
<seg id="2304">"he emigrated through the terrain and the ruins of the old castle and spoke to landscaping, gardeners and sometimes also with the artists who worked on the illustrations of his book."</seg>
<seg id="2305">"then, at night he drank" Whiskey and began to write. "</seg>
<seg id="2306">"the intimate history of Scotney is relatively unknown since the National Trust received full access until 2006, when the last Erbin, Elizabeth Hussey died."</seg>
<seg id="2307">"when Rhodes arrived a decade later, the employees began to take care of the archive that he described as" hundreds of years in which aristocrats said "Oh, throw it on the loft." "</seg>
<seg id="2308">"diaries, letters from the time of the English Empire, cards that represent who had something:" you could think that land conflicts would be boring, "says Rhodes," but there was a birch to fight the two families. "</seg>
<seg id="2309">"guys, let all go his gear!"</seg>
<seg id="2310">"some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to dive into the English history, among them 'The Labourer' that follows a man who leaves the newly built castle to join the peasant uprising of 1381."</seg>
<seg id="2311">"there is a record of an upheaval that occurred in the castle in 1380, in this book titled 'Knightly Families of Kent and Sussex'," says Rhodes. "</seg>
<seg id="2312">"the peasant uprising began in this area, and I thought an insurrection was a good start."</seg>
<seg id="2313">Perhaps the two are interconnected? "</seg>
<seg id="2314">Other stories are firmly rooted in the history of the castle - like 'The Priest' that tells the story of the Jesuit paters that the Darrell family hid seven years during the English Reformation.</seg>
<seg id="2315">"or 'The Smuggler', in which the smuggler Arthur Darrell was portrayed from the 18th century, who filmed his own funeral by filling a coffin with stones (a discovery that was first excavated years later when his coffin was excavated)."</seg>
<seg id="2316">"the Darrells are Rhodes's Favorite family of Scotney:" the gentlemen seemed to be quite a gauner, always make debt and spend money for things they could not afford. "</seg>
<seg id="2317">"other generations of Darrell-men solved their debt crises by marrying old women - I imagine it as a bunch of well-looking guys, with a talent to advertise landfill."</seg>
<seg id="2318">"after the end of his deployment in the castle, Rhodes is searching for other unique crib experiences"</seg>
<seg id="2319">"he has brought a two-week stay in the Finnish wilderness for a comic novel about Elämänmäki, the site of a sanatorium from the early 20th century, which has since been reclaimed by nature."</seg>

<seg id="2340">At first sight a normal procedure.</seg>
<seg id="2341">But nothing is routine in the Turkish armed forces one year after the attempted coup attempt.</seg>

<seg id="2348">"more than 10,000 soldiers were removed from the ranks of the army - mostly due to alleged ties to the movement of the Exil Prediger Fethullah Gülen, the Erdogan as a clinician of the putschversuchs."</seg>
<seg id="2349">"against 486 people, who have been directly involved in the coup attempt, will be negotiated in Ankara since this week."</seg>
<seg id="2350">"on the day after the coup, Erdogan had called the revolution as a" gift of God, "because he gave him the opportunity to fully clean the armed forces."</seg>

<seg id="2352">"at the end of February, the newspaper" Hürriyet "published an article entitled" Unbehaved in Military Headquarters. ""</seg>
<seg id="2353">"in the general staff there are concerns about an increasing" Islamization "of the army, which, among other things, manifested itself in the abolition of the military ban for soldiers, wrote the newspaper."</seg>
<seg id="2354">"in any case, the Grand Master in the army and the security forces goes on."</seg>
<seg id="2355">"in mid-July Erdogan sent another 7395 public servants by decree, including 2303 police officers and 546 soldiers."</seg>
<seg id="2356">It seemed that Erdogan was tamed the military.</seg>
<seg id="2357">The generals were formerly known as the actual masters of the country.</seg>
<seg id="2358">"three times, they appealed to their role as guardians of the secular state order."</seg>
<seg id="2359">"after his election victory in 2002, Erdogan pushed back the power of the military step by step, not least by calling on the reform proposals of the European Union."</seg>
<seg id="2360">Former officers say Erdogan induces specifically an Islamization of the armed forces.</seg>
<seg id="2361">"in the magazine" "Vocal Europe", "a name not called officer, seeking asylum from persecution abroad, the Turkish army will be" "full of extremists and Salafists" "in a few years."</seg>

<seg id="2389">"just as you thought it can't be crazy in 2017, a new report on technological developments in the area of sex robots will come."</seg>
<seg id="2390">"yes, in fact."</seg>
<seg id="2391">Sex robots are at the moment a big thing.</seg>
<seg id="2392">The Foundation for Responsible Robotics (FRR) recently published a report on the development of sex robots in the next five to ten years.</seg>
<seg id="2393">"according to Noel Sharkey, Professor of Robotik and artificial intelligence at Sheffield University and co-founder of FRR, we must start taking their ascension seriously."</seg>
<seg id="2394">"customers can choose the eye color of the robot, its form of nipple and type of fingernail."</seg>
<seg id="2395">"people make fun of them, but the companies deliver a lot of them and we will see them much more often," "Mr. Sharkey said at the release of his new report."</seg>
<seg id="2396">Modern slings have evolved from their inflatable partners to robots with a silicone skin that feels warm - with consciously human reactions that are achieved by artificial intelligence.</seg>
<seg id="2397">"the user can also adjust his robot according to his beliefs, and select everything from the robot's eye color to the form of nipples to the type or colour of his fingernails."</seg>
<seg id="2398">"but it is even more disturbing since many robots have the" "personalities" "who would like a Stepford woman to look like progressively."</seg>
<seg id="2399">Modern Sexpuppen have evolved to robots with a silicone skin.</seg>
<seg id="2400">"the RealBotix robot enables its users to adapt their robots to the properties that they find appealing, such as shyness."</seg>
<seg id="2401">"and then there are the Roxxxy Gold Sex-robots developed by True Companion with preprogrammed personalities such as" Frigid Farrah, "which gives the impression of shyness and" Wild Wendy "with an" "adventurous" "personality."</seg>
<seg id="2402">"Roxxxy Gold has a personality adapted to your personality as well as possible," warms the True Companion website. "</seg>
<seg id="2403">"so she likes what you like, and she doesn't like what you don't like, etc."</seg>
<seg id="2404">"in the course of the day, it also has its moods - like real people!"</seg>
<seg id="2405">"it can be tired, fixed to conversation or it can be" "in mood" "!"</seg>
<seg id="2406">"there are many disturbing aspects of this rise of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the submissive feminine features, the hints on rape, when one walks a step on Frigid (i.e. here: contrasting) Farrah, disturb one most."</seg>
<seg id="2407">"on his website True Companion Roxxxy with a vibrator, but for men."</seg>
<seg id="2408">"if women (sic) can have a vibrator, why can men then have no Roxxxy?"</seg>
<seg id="2409">"however, these sex robots are not just a fetish or simply just another sex toy."</seg>
<seg id="2410">"their origin and increasing sophistication point to a bit darker and deeper in our culture, towards a retreat from the ideal of gender equality towards a desire for sex with submission as optional encore."</seg>
<seg id="2411">"most men will of course not hold sex robots, and while the FRR notices their growing popularity, they remain nonetheless on the verge of consumer culture."</seg>
<seg id="2412">"but that which leaketh out of the boundary zones, can be very instructive in relation to the spirit of the time in which we live."</seg>
<seg id="2413">"and many people are not strangely or insulting, until the free market gives them permission."</seg>
<seg id="2414">"there is a certain overlap that these highly developed sex robots appear at a time in which women's rights are threatened all over the world, in which there is a president in the White House who has prevailed to have sexually attacked women."</seg>
<seg id="2415">"the most horrifying aspect of the TV series' The Handmaid's Tale '(' Der Report der Magd ') are not the graphical images, the intricate body and the out-out eyes, but how realistic this vision works."</seg>
<seg id="2416">"the Republic of Gilead is a leap, but at the moment it does not feel like a great leap."</seg>
<seg id="2417">The goal behind these sex robots is to produce a physical similarity to actual women as realistic as technically possible (if also with pornostar proportions).</seg>
<seg id="2418">Their builders want them to feel human that they imitate the movement of a real body.</seg>
<seg id="2419">"but, to the point when it comes to their" personalities, "robots are not real women."</seg>
<seg id="2420">They cannot separate themselves from their companion or simply go away.</seg>
<seg id="2421">"they have no mediation or background story, nothing that points to independence or anything that might disturb the imagination of total submission."</seg>
<seg id="2422">"in other words, they are fake slaves."</seg>

<seg id="2432">"with Trump in the White House, everyone she knows, including the republican family, with whom she had fought for decades because of politics, suddenly and quite strange on the same side."</seg>
<seg id="2433">"for the dining table this is certainly a good thing, but it falls to me in a further context that this also entails considerable risks."</seg>
<seg id="2434">"the left was strengthened by Trump, but the satisfactory effect of his presidency has the strength to push us all to the right."</seg>
<seg id="2435">"when we speak of" normalization "and trump, we refer to the creepy possibility that his kittens will no longer be replicated."</seg>
<seg id="2436">"however, there is an even more difficult long-term scenario in which Trump Republicans of the right wing" normalized, "which suddenly appear as the epitome of reasonableness."</seg>
<seg id="2437">"today I think of an active nostalgia for Mitt Romney's urcomical version of the madman - the dog on the car roof, the 14% income tax (but at least we knew how his tax return looked like) - both in fact appear to be a very mild criminal act."</seg>
<seg id="2438">"when Trump goes, the next candidate of the republicans must be only mentally healthy in order to qualify as immeasurable improvement."</seg>
<seg id="2439">"as my cousin in the city, we brought our children to the carousel in Central Park, the biggest of the New York park department, and the best three dollars you can spend in the city if you don't need caffeine."</seg>

<seg id="2579">"meat, dairy products and chocolate could help relieve IBD (Inflammation)"</seg>
<seg id="2580">Red meat and chocolate can sound like a nightmare for your digestive system.</seg>
<seg id="2581">"but a new study claims exactly the opposite: a diet that is rich in meat-based proteins and dairy products, could alleviate the symptoms of patients with inflammatory bowel disease."</seg>
<seg id="2582">"the incurable condition, which affects approximately 1.3 million in the USA in the USA, causes stomach cramps and flatulence, recurrent or bloody diarrhoea, weight loss and extreme tiredness."</seg>
<seg id="2583">"while patients are usually advised to avoid meat and dairy products in order to alleviate their symptoms, researchers found out at the Washington University that the essential amino acid tryptophan contributes to developing immune cells that promote a tolerant intestines."</seg>
<seg id="2584">"the conductive researcher, Dr. Marco Colonna, explained that immune cells can patrol in the intestines to ensure that harmful microbes that hide in the food cannot penetrate into the body."</seg>
<seg id="2585">"cells capable of triggering inflammation, are balanced by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging sensitive tissues."</seg>
<seg id="2586">"if the balance is too far in the direction of inflammation, it can result in inflammatory bowel disease."</seg>
<seg id="2587">Experiments have been found that a kind of tolerance-promoting immune cell occurs in mice that carry a certain bacterium in their intestines.</seg>
<seg id="2588">And the bacterium needs tryptophan - one of the building blocks of proteins - to dissolve the appearance of the cells.</seg>
<seg id="2589">"Professor Colonna said:" we have established a connection between a bacterial species - Lactobacillus reuteri - which is a normal part of the gut microbiome, and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance. "</seg>
<seg id="2590">"the more tryptophan the mice had in their food, the more they had from these immune cells."</seg>
<seg id="2591">"he suggested that the combination of L. reuteri and one of tryptophan rich nutrition tolerant, less flammable intestinal milieus, if the same system also weke in humans."</seg>
<seg id="2592">"the post-doctoral fellow Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barragan, studied a kind of immune cell that promotes tolerance when she found out that a group of study mice had such cells, but another group of the same tribe, which was but separated, did not have."</seg>
<seg id="2593">"it assumed that the difference with the intestinal microbial of the mice had to do - the community of bacteria, viruses and fungi that normally live in the gastrointestinal tract."</seg>
<seg id="2594">"the intestines of the mice were sequenced DNA sequenced and there were found six bacterial species present in mice with the immune cells, but without them missing in mice."</seg>
<seg id="2595">Mice were raised in a sterile environment so that they were missing an intestinal microbiome and they did not develop this type of immune cells and they received the L. Cross and immune cells.</seg>
<seg id="2596">"in order to understand how the bacteria affected the immune system, the researchers of L. Cross Iberia grow in a liquid and then transferred small amounts of liquid - without the bacteria - on unripe immune cells isolated from the mice."</seg>
<seg id="2597">The immune cells developed to the tolerant cells.</seg>
<seg id="2598">"when the active component has been purified out of the liquid, it proved to be a by-product of tryptophan metabolism, known as an indol-3 lactic acid."</seg>
<seg id="2599">"when the researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in the feed of the mice, the number of such cells increased by around 50 percent, but when the tryptophan were halved, the number of cells decreased by half."</seg>
<seg id="2600">"Dr. Cervantes-Barragan stated that people have the same tolerant cells like mice, and that most of us can protect L. reuteri in our gastrointestinal tracts."</seg>
<seg id="2601">"it is not known whether tryptophan-by-products from L. reuteri develop the cells in humans as in mice, but defects in genes in relation to tryptophan were found in people with inflammatory bowel disease."</seg>
<seg id="2602">"she said," "The development of these cells is probably something we want to promote as these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the intestine."</seg>
<seg id="2603">"potentially, high tryptophan values in the presence of L. reuteri can lead to an expansion of this population."</seg>

<seg id="2718">"the helicopter made in Connecticut was exhibited beside a yacht from Maine, a fire fighter car from Wisconsin and a forklift from Mississippi."</seg>
<seg id="2719">"the Military office of the White House demanded the presence of the helicopter in a fragmentary order or Frago, barely 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South Lawn, following the records of the Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1), the unit responsible for the operation of the helicopter."</seg>
<seg id="2720">"I just wanted you to be aware of it because it's such an unusual event with high visibility," the commander of the HMX-1, on the eve of the event, wrote his supervisor, the deputy naval commander for aviation. "</seg>
<seg id="2721">"the news showed that the helicopter arrived at the South Lawn on July 17 at 7 o'clock in the morning, and so long remained until the lawn between 18: 00 and 21: 00 was evacuated this evening."</seg>
<seg id="2722">The note adds that if the departure from the White House should be delayed due to the limitation of the hours a second team would be required for the return flight.</seg>
<seg id="2723">"the original flight crew was during the event with the helicopter, while the security personnel of the unit stayed on the ground during the time on the plane."</seg>
<seg id="2724">"from the records provided by the TIME, it was not clear that a second flight was ultimately required."</seg>
<seg id="2725">The Hatch Act prohibits federal states to use state property for political purposes.</seg>
<seg id="2726">Records indicate that HMX-1 asked if the event could violate the destiny.</seg>
<seg id="2727">"a question we created was whether it was a violation of the Hatch acts and we were informed that this was not the case," the commander wrote. "</seg>
<seg id="2728">"sounds as if you are closed," said the Deputy Commandant. "</seg>
<seg id="2729">The "Made in America" event was called by the White House as an official event and would not be covered by the Hatch Act.</seg>
<seg id="2730">But also official events have political overtones.</seg>
<seg id="2731">"at the event, the president gave an impetus for the reform of the health reform that was going on in the Senate and he propagated the efforts to insulate government regulations."</seg>

<seg id="2745">Records of the unit list the flight time of the aircraft as 30 minutes from the home base of the Marine Corps Air Facility in Quantico in Virginia.</seg>
<seg id="2746">The White House argues that the actual cost of operation of the helicopter is far below this rate.</seg>
<seg id="2747">"" "the cost of taxpayers on the basis of estimates for reimbursement rates is highly misleading," "said Walters."</seg>

<seg id="2750">"at that time, the former press spokesman of the White House, Sean Spicer, defended the use of helicopter for the event."</seg>
<seg id="2751">"the idea is to present these week things that are produced in America," Spicer said. "</seg>

<seg id="2892">"Christian Weisnder, spokesman of the reform movement" We are Church, "stated after publication in front of the Deutsche Presse-Agentur, he was waiting for the former Regensburger Bishop and present-day Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller as well as from the cathedral kapellmeister Georg Ratzinger, the 93-year-old brother of the emerified Pope Benedict XVI, an apology."</seg>
<seg id="2893">"it would greatly serve the prestige of the Catholic Church, if Müller and Ratzinger would express their deep regret about their own omissions or their then false assessment of the processes."</seg>
<seg id="2894">"the Vatican newspaper" Osservatore Romano, "on the other hand, criticized that in reporting about violence at the Domspatzen with" "two measures". ""</seg>
<seg id="2895">"with regard to the attacks in Regensburg, no one doubted that it was" shameful and shameful acts "that would have to be punished and prevented in the future; however, the author Lucetta Scaraffia, historian and member of the National Italian Bioethics Committee."</seg>
<seg id="2896">"the habit of calling the Catholic Church as a source of all evil, is already part of the everyday experience and prepares public opinion to keep it normal," says Scaraffia. "</seg>
<seg id="2897">"princess Gloria von Thurn und Taxis said in the interview with Bayerischer Rundfunk:" "we would like to go to the church and this is a finite fresher."</seg>
<seg id="2898">"she also pointed out that in her youth" "bats had been a very normal pedagogical means", "to cope with cheeky children, as I was one."</seg>
<seg id="2899">"it is unfair to apply today's standards for past decades, as the world has changed."</seg>
<seg id="2900">"in connection with the reports on abuse of abuse, pope-brother Georg Ratzinger often appeared."</seg>
<seg id="2901">"completely wrong, author and historian Michael Hesemann, who wrote the reminder band" My brother of the Pope "(translated into 12 languages)."</seg>
<seg id="2902">"I have to take protection from Georg Ratzinger," "says Hesemann," "for all this had nothing to do with him," "he evaluates the results of the final report."</seg>
<seg id="2903">What exactly is written in the 440-page report written by the Bistum Regensburg with the Enlightenment lawyer Ulrich Weber?</seg>
<seg id="2904">"a total of 547 Regensburger Domspatzen were abused between 1945 and the early 1990s," offering high plausibility "victims of attacks, 67 dome-cats sexually abused."</seg>
<seg id="2905">"in the final report, it is said to Georg Ratzinger, who worked in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994:" in summary, it can be noted that by Domkapellmeister R., in many cases, forms of physical and psychological violence have been applied. "</seg>
<seg id="2906">"especially with high emotional levels, the punishment for the students was even more violent."</seg>
<seg id="2907">"nevertheless, unlike many other accused, many victims underestimated the general humanity of R. and therefore, in many cases, even have positive memories with him in many cases."</seg>
<seg id="2908">"in the interview, Hesemann explains why the final report about the abuse scandal at the Regensburger Domspatzen Georg Ratzinger was relieved in his opinion."</seg>
<seg id="2909">"Mr. Hesemann, the 440-page report on the" Incidents of Violence Against Prevention at the Regensburger Domspatzen "gives a contradictory picture of Georg Ratzinger's cathedral-master master."</seg>
<seg id="2910">"for one, many students highlight his" humanity. ""</seg>
<seg id="2911">"on the other hand, it also appears as a choleric and perfectionist, which was handy when a domain kit had no top performance musically."</seg>
<seg id="2912">How do you evaluate this final report as his biographer?</seg>
<seg id="2913">"Michael Hesemann: if you make the effort and read the entire 440 pages long report from the front to the back, you have to ask yourself why the name Georg Ratzinger is in it at all."</seg>
<seg id="2914">"he has just eight pages dedicated to him, and he is clearly acquitted of any suspicion of complicity or complicity in the terrible cases of sexual abuse."</seg>
<seg id="2915">The excesses of violence at the pre-school also occurred outside of its sphere of sphere.</seg>
<seg id="2916">"at best, it is possible to reproach him too late or not to have taken first hints serious enough."</seg>
<seg id="2917">"the Domspatzengymnasium, on which he worked, was felt by practically all respondents than - literally -" redemption, "" heaven "and" better world. ""</seg>
<seg id="2918">"thus also the broad majority of his students Georg Ratzinger provides an excellent testimony," "sincere," "" sincere, "" sincere, "" sincere, "" competent and "understanding," who provided the boys regularly with cakes, biscuits and candy and "always encamped by the grapes of children." "</seg>
<seg id="2919">"only a minority complains about his perfectionism and his great emotionality, which also led to flood eruptions."</seg>
<seg id="2920">"that he did not only knead with chairs and threw the key on the ground, but also parted earseses and too cheered guys on the hair or ears, he himself had been deeply regretted and apologized for this."</seg>
<seg id="2921">"however, it must be said that such educational methods were widespread in the questionable time, the 1960s and 1970s, with parents and teachers."</seg>
<seg id="2922">Do you also know such breeding methods?</seg>
<seg id="2923">"of course, I think everyone of us who was born before 1968."</seg>
<seg id="2924">"I also experienced this in a secular school, a state high school."</seg>
<seg id="2925">"compared to what is actually happening in this report, namely the horrible sexual abuse and violence of violence at the pre-school, it is certainly Bagatelles."</seg>
<seg id="2926">"there is already a question of whether it is not more of his familiarity and role as a brother of Benedict XVI to do, that many media just fell on him."</seg>
<seg id="2927">"at the Bavarian pope, many people who have never understood him are still working eagerly."</seg>
<seg id="2928">But the truth is: the report is relieved Georg Ratzinger in every respect!</seg>
<seg id="2929">"in the context of the report, the media was reported very much about the issue of abuse at the Regensburg domain pads."</seg>
<seg id="2930">Will Georg Ratzinger put in the final report any involvement or complicity with regard to sexual abuse?</seg>
<seg id="2931">Michael Hesemann: clearly no.</seg>
<seg id="2932">Not one of the 67 victims of sexual assault claims to have entrusted the Domkapellmeister.</seg>
<seg id="2933">Not even the parents were inaugurated.</seg>
<seg id="2934">"I never dared to talk to my father or mother about it," "said an affected representative for the others," "It was all very embarrassing to me."</seg>
<seg id="2935">The real problem in the education of sexual abuse was and is that most victims are silent.</seg>
<seg id="2936">"if they don't even trust parents and siblings, then certainly not a choir director, who would have been a colleague of the perpetrators in a professional way."</seg>
<seg id="2937">What is the opinion of the Domspatzen student Ratzinger's role in terms of abuse of abuse?</seg>
<seg id="2938">Michael Hesemann: a questionable student formulated it so: "regarding sexual abuse... I see... no case in which he (Georg Ratzinger) had had timely findings and could have stopped the respective perpetrator.</seg>
<seg id="2939">"I think it... also for really absurd, to assume that out of it... Buben more forceful or clearer or even more open than against their parents, dormitories, trust teachers, etc."</seg>
<seg id="2940">That you talk to him about sex... - unthinkable. "</seg>
<seg id="2941">"in this way, the report concludes with the very clear result:" that the student and / or their surroundings were entrusted to him in advance, could not be confirmed in the course of the study. "</seg>
<seg id="2942">"as far as sexual abuse is concerned, Georg Ratzinger is thus free of any co-existence."</seg>
<seg id="2943">"in such a way, he cannot be accused of preventing or having brought him to the ad."</seg>
<seg id="2944">"therefore there is no reason to associate his good name with these contradictory crimes, as unfortunately it happened in some cases."</seg>
<seg id="2945">"in the media, much of" "violence" "was to be read at the Regensburger Domspatzen."</seg>
<seg id="2946">"the former cathedral kapellmeister Georg Ratzinger is accused of" "leaving" "in the report."</seg>
<seg id="2947">Must he live with this accusation?</seg>
<seg id="2948">"Michael Hesemann: that's the big problem in reporting everything mixed and mixed up to a huge reporting of sexual abuse and violence and somewhere, in the middle of it, Georg Ratzinger."</seg>
<seg id="2949">But this is precisely the case of misuse of the report.</seg>
<seg id="2950">"in fact, it is clean divided: between the pre-school and the gymnasium of the dome-cats, between sexual abuse and violence and, we say once, other allegations."</seg>
<seg id="2951">"in addition, the report covers incidents from the period since 1945, so also from four decades, in which Georg Ratzinger was not choir leader of the cathedral spatzen."</seg>
<seg id="2952">"the horrible test pedagogy, the cases where boys from sadistic teachers were curated and maligned and suffered from them, all occurred at the pre-school in Etterzhausen and Pielenhofen, where really scandalous conditions."</seg>
<seg id="2953">"but with those who had Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger nothing to do, because he got the boys to face when they were already at the Domspatzengymnasium."</seg>
<seg id="2954">"on the one hand, as most of the witnesses emphasise, the topic" Preschool "taboo."</seg>
<seg id="2955">"one was only happy to be able to escape and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even" "heavenly" "states."</seg>
<seg id="2956">What was different at the Domspatzengymnasium?</seg>
<seg id="2957">"Michael Hesemann: there was discipline, but no sadistic violence."</seg>
<seg id="2958">"and this also applies to Georg Ratzinger, where the report concludes that" many victims have appreciated the general humanity of R. and therefore, in many cases, even combine positive memories with him in many cases. "</seg>
<seg id="2959">"at most, the blame remains to have looked away."</seg>
<seg id="2960">"however, despite all efforts, the report could only define two periods in which it was reported by the states at the pre-school."</seg>
<seg id="2961">"the first time in 1970 / 71, when he began to establish himself and from the processes at a school where he was not working and responsible, (so the witness) didn't want to hear anything, and then only back in 1993."</seg>
<seg id="2962">Does Georg Ratzinger consistently close the ears before the states?</seg>
<seg id="2963">"Michael Hesemann: no, because already in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the Domspatzengymnasium, which the report even reproduced."</seg>
<seg id="2964">"in this he points out this," "that in the pre-school, the punishment will continue to be practiced."</seg>
<seg id="2965">"in view of the danger of negative press releases, he recommended urgent action."</seg>
<seg id="2966">"that was, of course, at a time when legal clarity existed, as test penalties in Bavaria were long ago banned."</seg>
<seg id="2967">"before that, they occurred in a legal gray area, as each of us still knows."</seg>
<seg id="2968">It was difficult for him to estimate where the affected were perhaps exaggerated or dramatised and where really the permissible limit was exceeded.</seg>
<seg id="2969">"but you can't say, he always looked away."</seg>
<seg id="2970">That's just right.</seg>
<seg id="2971">"only in 1980, the retrial of schools was officially abolished in Bavaria."</seg>
<seg id="2972">"princess Gloria von Thurn und Taxis claimed, it is unfair to apply today's pedagogical standards for the time of time."</seg>
<seg id="2973">How do you see that?</seg>
<seg id="2974">"Michael Hesemann: we are talking about the" trap of Anachronism, "i.e. the danger posed by the present moral standards."</seg>
<seg id="2975">08.11.2015 | Desperate Housewives</seg>
<seg id="2976">"but this is of course not true for sexual abuse, which was abominable at all times, and not for what was hiding in the pre-school of resistances and violence against innocent child souls, that goes far beyond that then."</seg>
<seg id="2977">This is all awful and I am glad that it is finally up-to-date.</seg>
<seg id="2978">But at the same time I must protect Georg Ratzinger because all this had nothing to do with him.</seg>
<seg id="2979">"his means of disciplining and punishment, so to draw ear, and to the hair and ears, were widespread in the 1970s."</seg>
<seg id="2980">"when physical punishment was then banned, he also kept strictly adhered to."</seg>
<seg id="2981">"which picture of his Regensburg time has Georg Ratzinger returned in talks with you for the book" "My Brother of the Pope" "?"</seg>
<seg id="2982">Did the subject of the test also come to speech?</seg>
<seg id="2983">"Michael Hesemann: well, in the book it's about the life of his brother Joseph, i.e. Pope Benedict XVI, tells from his perspective, as the cathedral pads only played a minor role."</seg>
<seg id="2984">"nevertheless, I don't know that he led a strict regiment there."</seg>
<seg id="2985">"even this must be said once: without this perfectionism, without the unconditional discipline, it would hardly have been possible for him to form an institution of world trang, the true cultural ambassador of Europe and his musical tradition, which went on tour twice in the USA (1983 and 1987) and Japan (1988 and 1991)."</seg>
<seg id="2986">"with biscuits and bonbons alone, you do not only make any big vocalists and before every success, just in what area, but always discipline, passion and self-overriding."</seg>
<seg id="2987">What kind of man did you experience Georg Ratzinger during the conversations with her book?</seg>
<seg id="2988">"Michael Hesemann: through the work on the book and beyond that, I met Georg Ratzinger very well and again and again experienced as wonderful, humorous, basic, deeply faithful and cordial people, from which one can't imagine that he could do anything but a fly."</seg>
<seg id="2989">"I come regularly with how many former Domspatzen are still today, 23 years after his embargo, regularly contact him to visit him - he is almost blind - and treat him like a member of her family."</seg>
<seg id="2990">"those who have not forgiven him until now, that he once was stern to them, are thus clearly in the minority."</seg>
<seg id="2991">Most of the Domspatzen are thankful to him today that he enriched her life and taught them the world of music.</seg>
<seg id="2992">"and that he is always a good, paternal teacher - a strict father, certainly, that may be - but also a lovely respectress, to which she is still looking at today and which they almost worship."</seg>
<seg id="2993">"and please, once again clearly: all that you submit to him are educational methods that were on the agenda at that time."</seg>
<seg id="2994">We can be glad that we have long since overcome this time.</seg>
<seg id="2995">"but it is most unjust, a man, just because he is prominent and has an even more prominent brother to make the medial scapegoat."</seg>
<seg id="2996">"there is the evil intent behind it, only too obvious."</seg>
<seg id="2997">"for the report, which was just published, relieves him."</seg>
<seg id="2998">"now it would be the state of affairs, a 93-year-old man who has acquired great merits and without the outside of Bavaria and perhaps Germany, nobody would probably know the Regensburger Domspatzen, finally in peace."</seg>
