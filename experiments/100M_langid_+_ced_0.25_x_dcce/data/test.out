Jennifer Ani@@ ston : I &apos;m always put into drawers
Jennifer Ani@@ ston must not always be perfect or successful .
this has clearly made the Hollywood star un@@ equi@@ voc@@ ally clear in an interview .
I &apos;m always plug@@ ged into drawers or get stuck from the outside label that usually have little to do with me and reality .
I myself have not the desire to always be perfect and successful .
&quot; hon@@ estly , these things are rather dum@@ b to me . &quot;
&quot; Jennifer Ani@@ ston ( 47 ) can only laugh about it , that she is regarded as &quot; Miss Perfect &quot; as she explains in the current cos@@ mop@@ olitan . &quot;
&quot; the act@@ ress likes to spend her time at home , in front of a television with a cris@@ py rub@@ ble and Mexican food , it is in the magazine . &quot;
&quot; she brings about the question of child desire : &quot; &quot; we women do not have to be married or have children to be perfect , &quot; &quot; says the Hollywood star . &quot;
&quot; in her new film &quot; Mother &apos;s Day - love is not a child &apos;s game &quot; &quot; is Ani@@ ston as an all@@ u@@ er@@ ous mother of two sons . &quot;
the film runs with us starting August 25 .
Gol@@ fer Lan@@ ger wins the Sport Pyram@@ id
his experiences on the horse are man@@ age@@ able .
at the end of a golf tournament in South Africa Bernhard Lan@@ ger with some colleagues sought a little variation with a ride on the beach .
it was a premiere for the 58 @-@ year @-@ old .
CHI@@ O : &quot; golden Sport@@ pyramid &quot; for Bernhard Lan@@ ger
&quot; after a few minutes , the horses remembered their feast , they were hunting for a quick gal@@ lop back home to the feed questionn@@ aires . &quot;
&quot; one kilometer at this pace , I was afraid . &quot;
&quot; it was not a good experience , &quot; says Lan@@ ger . &quot;
and thus the riding career ended up again .
&quot; on Saturday , Germany &apos;s best gol@@ fer was at all times - 101 tournament vic@@ tories - again near horses . &quot;
&quot; he was led by his family about the system of the AL@@ RV , on a horse he didn &apos;t even dare to photograph . &quot;
this was the first time in Aachen and thus also with CHI@@ O .
the reason was absolutely convincing .
the German sports aid handed over to the man from An@@ hausen as part of a small g@@ ala the Golden Sport@@ pyramid .
it does not lack the sympath@@ etic ath@@ l@@ ete .
&quot; spring Cross , Silver bay leaf , Champions @-@ Tour player of the year ... &quot;
even the British Queen has already loaded him .
long is the 18th prize winner of the sports pyramid .
&quot; in Aachen , he met the first prize @-@ winner Hans Günter Win@@ kler on Saturday . &quot;
&quot; this award means a lot to me , &quot; says Lan@@ ger , &quot; because she is not only awarded for sporting achievements , but also for social commitment . &quot;
Lan@@ ger has been promoting offspring for decades .
&quot; and so he also announced the prize money of 25,000 euros . &quot;
&quot; with 15 other outstanding sport@@ s@@ men , the two @-@ time U.S. Mast@@ ers@@ si@@ eger was admitted to the &quot; Hall of F@@ ame of German Sports &quot; on Saturday . &quot;
&quot; the winners include the athletes of Hart@@ wig Gau@@ der and Harald Schmit@@ t , the Tur@@ ner Eber@@ hard Gi@@ enger , the F@@ echter Cornelia Han@@ isch , Alexander P@@ usch and Ar@@ nd Schmit@@ t , the Ru@@ derer Peter @-@ Michael Kol@@ be , the Ju@@ do@@ ka Frank Wi@@ en@@ eke , the rider Al@@ win Scho@@ ck@@ em@@ öh@@ le and pos@@ th@@ um der Hand@@ b@@ aller Er@@ hard Wunder@@ lich . &quot;
many of these sport@@ s@@ men came to Aachen on Saturday .
&quot; after the official part , the illustri@@ ous company emig@@ rated to the Spring@@ stadi@@ on , where the Lav@@ azza Prize ran . &quot;
Bernhard Lan@@ ger held distance to the big animals .
Clin@@ tons and Tr@@ umps Policy Compar@@ ison : it &apos;s all about the money
investing in infrastructure and preventing T@@ TP trading agreement - they want both Clinton and Tr@@ ump .
&quot; the two US presidential candidates , however , are in the tax and energy policy as well as in a basic demand . &quot;
&quot; the difference in economic policy between Donald Tr@@ ump and Hill@@ ary Clinton is a basic , rather philosophical difference . &quot;
the role of the state .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Tr@@ ump wants to remain small in doubt and war@@ ns of how the state of the economy can harm the economy - with taxes and regulations . &quot;
&quot; Clinton wanted to best@@ ow the economy to death and regulate it to death , he says . &quot;
&quot; he himself , on the other hand , would be quite different , claims Tr@@ ump . &quot;
&quot; he will massi@@ vely rep@@ ay Reg@@ ulations , and he is strong for a far @-@ reaching tax reform with lower tax rates - for private people and for companies . &quot;
&quot; Clinton , on the other hand , said : the state has certain tasks to fulfil , he has to open dis@@ advant@@ aged opportunities and needs money for it . &quot;
&quot; that is why the taxes would be increased for the rich , says it . &quot;
&quot; interest@@ ingly , both are very close to the topic of infrastructure . &quot;
&quot; in the need to invest , Tr@@ ump and Clinton say almost identical . &quot;
the democratic candidate announces the largest investment in new jobs since the Second World War .
state investment programmes in the infrastructure are classical democratic policies and are strictly rejected by the state @-@ critical Te@@ apart@@ y wing of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans .
&quot; so , on Tr@@ ump , parties could still deal with party discussions . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
Tr@@ ump wants to build coal @-@ fired power plants and drive back coal mining in the US .
&quot; oil production should also be possible in so far protected areas , the Paris climate protection agreement aims to announce . &quot;
&quot; Clinton , on the other hand , wants to extend and challenge the Renew@@ able Energy with its investment program : &quot; &quot; a country will become the super power of clean energy and create millions of jobs . &quot;
&quot; it will probably be either China , Germany or America - I want it to be . &quot;
&quot; but not only in infrastructure - even in international trade agreements , the two competitors are not too far from each other . &quot;
&quot; T@@ PP , the transp@@ aci@@ fic trade agreement , both do not want to sign . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , both of them do not want to isol@@ ate the US from international trade - but simply to better protect American jobs . &quot;
&quot; they should also be paid better , such as Clinton . &quot;
the current minimum wage of $ 7.@@ 25 is a famine .
it wants to increase it to 15 dollars per hour .
&quot; what Tr@@ ump wants to do in this question is not quite clear : once he says : the minimum wage must go down , then he says he should not be changed . &quot;
but the big discussion of the months ahead is likely to be more likely to develop the control policy of the two camps .
&quot; on the one hand , Tr@@ ump , who wants to rel@@ ieve the economy and citizens to boost growth . &quot;
&quot; his critics claim to him , that the budget deficit would only grow bigger . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , Clinton , which at least wants to demand from the rich , wants to pay more taxes , and their critics say : more taxes are not the solution either . &quot;
escape : &quot; any fled woman has experiences with sexual violence &quot;
&quot; sexual violence is a part of women who flee alone , almost everyday . &quot;
&quot; when they arrive in Germany , they are often trau@@ mati@@ zed . &quot;
a house has a refuge .
four women are sitting in a large kitchen .
each one has a baby who is at most one year old .
one has put her little son in his arm .
he looks curi@@ ously into the room with big eyes .
his mother star@@ es on the table top .
until she not@@ ices that she is observed .
she sm@@ iles and kis@@ ses the little ones .
the scene is normal .
until you talk to Kat@@ rin B@@ ahr .
&quot; she is a manager of Con@@ dro@@ bs , a carrier for social welfare services in Bavaria and deals among other things with the topic of women on the run . &quot;
the four women in the kitchen are f@@ owl .
&quot; in the North of Munich , they live in one of the few de@@ centr@@ alised accommodations for seclu@@ ded women and their children in Bavaria . &quot;
&quot; in January , Con@@ dro@@ bs made up the establishment together with Pro Famili@@ a and the Münchner Frau@@ enh@@ ilfe . &quot;
it has recently been officially opened .
60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children .
men do not exist - also not as visitors .
the exception is a guard in front of the door .
&quot; it is not exagger@@ ated to say : every woman who matters here has made experiences with sexual violence on her escape , &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot;
&quot; men flee because of wars because they are politically persec@@ uted because they thre@@ aten torture or death , or because their families send them to Europe as a hope @-@ bear@@ er to Europe , &quot; she tells . &quot;
&quot; women out@@ weigh other reasons for the escape : &quot; &quot; many ste@@ al secre@@ tly because they don &apos;t see any other way out . &quot;
&quot; in their homeland , they have experience with sexual violence , forced marri@@ ages , bond@@ age , slavery or forced pro@@ stitution . &quot;
this is driving them away .
08.@@ 11.2015 &#124; Desperate Housewives
&quot; that tu@@ g@@ boats for example demand a bottle of water a sexual act is not a rar@@ ity , &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot;
&quot; and the women are alone , they are not protected by their families . &quot;
&quot; who believe that the end , as soon as they arrive in Germany , ir@@ re , tells B@@ ahr . &quot;
&quot; here too , single women in refugee shel@@ ters would often be considered inferior and badly mis@@ used . &quot;
&quot; this means that about 90 percent of women living in the housing in the North of Munich are trau@@ mati@@ zed , they appreciate . &quot;
&quot; some of the children are certainly not voluntarily created . &quot;
many women are so acc@@ u@@ stom@@ ed to say nothing .
&quot; or they don &apos;t dare to speak openly about the experience , because the shame is too big . &quot;
&quot; as she often doesn &apos;t want to help herself , it takes more accommodation only for her , asks B@@ ahr . &quot;
&quot; in Bavaria , the seven district governments are responsible for the accommodation of refugees . &quot;
&quot; on the question of whether they knew from a similar project as in Munich in their jurisdiction , some answers with no . &quot;
&quot; in the Ober@@ pf@@ alz and Upper Fran@@ conia , there is no such thing in shel@@ ters of governments . &quot;
&quot; even in Sw@@ ab@@ ians , escaped women are not accommod@@ ated separately , says Karl @-@ Heinz Meyer , spokes@@ man of the government . &quot;
&quot; in Upper Bavaria , Lower and Central Fran@@ conia there are in some communal shel@@ ving floors or own houses only for single women and their children . &quot;
&quot; the exception is Nieder@@ bay@@ ern , there are two central accommodations exclusively for women . &quot;
&quot; the committee &quot; &quot; Rights of Women and Gender E@@ quality &quot; &quot; in the European Parliament also calls for women to be separated from men . &quot;
&quot; in a study published for the committee , it is said : &quot; it is very important that men and women are accommod@@ ated separately . &quot;
&quot; lack of privacy or being accommod@@ ated together with men and women , it may become a perpet@@ ual - violence against women . &quot;
&quot; especially the wash@@ rooms should be separate and easily accessible for women , stands in the study . &quot;
&quot; how much women feel this need for protection , one can read at the rush that there is on the house in Munich . &quot;
&quot; since we have spoken about that there is us , we have a long waiting list , &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot;
one could easily make a second house .

representatives of the assist@@ ants have called their union to appro@@ ve new labour campaigns in their disputes over a new treaty .
the Junior Doc@@ tors Committee ( J@@ DC ) of the British Medical Association ( B@@ MA ) has called for its entire Council to appro@@ ve more labour campaigns from the beginning of September .
the J@@ DC said that ministers had failed to respond to concerns about the contract .
&quot; in July , assistant physicians and medical students agreed on the rejection of a contract agreed with the B@@ MA . &quot;
he was rejected by 58 % of its members voted in elections .
&quot; in a letter to the members , which was published on Thursday evening on Twitter , the chairman of the J@@ DC Ellen Mc@@ Court said that the government would have remained &quot; persistent &quot; to problems , which led to the fact that the treaty was rejected . &quot;
&quot; she said : &quot; &quot; in view of this , the J@@ DC Council agreed to reject the proposed new treaty and calls for official new negotiations to all your worries . &quot;
&quot; as an answer to the silence of the government , the J@@ DC Council today issued a formal request for a special meeting of the B@@ MA Council to appro@@ ve a running program of escal@@ ating labour campaigns , beginning of September . &quot;
&quot; the disputes resulted in assist@@ ants of this year six sm@@ al , the first complete fail@@ ures in the history of the N@@ HS . &quot;
&quot; the head of the B@@ MA assistant physicians , Dr. Johann Mal@@ aw@@ ana , res@@ igned after the election to reject the agreed contract conditions recommended by the B@@ MA . &quot;
&quot; he shared B@@ MA members during the meetings , which took place before the vote by 54@@ 0,000 assist@@ ants and medical students that the contract should be advantageous and accepted . &quot;
&quot; after the vote , the Minister of Health Jerem@@ y Hun@@ t said that the contract for doctors in England would be introduced . &quot;
Russia and Turkey : an &quot; alliance of out@@ si@@ ders &quot; ?
it was a gest@@ ure that ended a crisis .
Russia and Turkey leaders met on Tuesday to surrender their hands and to announce an official end of the eight @-@ month war of words and economic sanctions .
&quot; but when Vladimir Putin accepts his Turkish counter@@ part in the gold @-@ plated audi@@ t@@ orium of St. Petersburg palace , I cannot deny myself that Ankara wants this reconciliation most . &quot;
&quot; there was the hand@@ shake , yes . &quot;
&quot; but Putin &apos;s sm@@ iles seemed to be narrow , and he hardly radi@@ ated warmth , even for his restra@@ ined conditions . &quot;
&quot; Rec@@ ep Tay@@ y@@ ip Erd@@ og@@ an , on the other hand , spoke of his &quot; dear friend &quot; Putin - according to a report five times . &quot;
I couldn &apos;t count it any more .
&quot; he also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis , but will even improve . &quot;
&quot; the next day , a newspaper described that Erd@@ og@@ an had beha@@ ved like that , as if there was never anything bad . &quot;
to me his enthusiasm seemed rather to imply the opposite .
&quot; but one of Putin &apos;s bla@@ zing , sustainable cows showed that Russia &apos;s head of state had nothing to forget . &quot;
&quot; rather , the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his introduc@@ tory phrases : the shot of a Russian fighter plane at the Syrian border through Turkey . &quot;
Moscow &apos;s reaction to the time was disp@@ le@@ ased .
Putin condemned and accused Ankara to fall Russia back into the back .
&quot; the crime was even greater , since it was committed by a supposed friend . &quot;
re@@ build the vet@@ rain will be difficult if not even impossible .
the public opinion in Russia has changed since November .
&quot; for months , the state @-@ controlled media carried out a violent , un@@ restricted attack on Ankara . &quot;
at one time it seemed as if the Turks would bear the blame for everything .
&quot; most serious were the alleg@@ ations of senior officials , that Erd@@ og@@ an &apos;s own family would have benefited from illegal oil trade in Syria , controlled by the so @-@ called Islamic State . &quot;
he has denied this v@@ ehem@@ ently .
but in St.@@ Petersburg the official message was that it was time to look forward .
&quot; finally , this meeting took place only because Putin received the ap@@ ology from President Erd@@ og@@ an . &quot;
Russia could book a kind of victory .
&quot; for Ankara , the advantages of a ce@@ as@@ ef@@ ire are obvious . &quot;
&quot; Erd@@ og@@ an primarily needs all the friends he can get , after he was dismis@@ sed almost of his ministry last month with a failed coup d &quot; é@@ tat . &quot;
repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey have also sha@@ ken him .
but there are also economic motives .
&quot; Russian sanctions have hit Turkey hard , in particular the prohibition of charter flights , which usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast every year . &quot;
the number has declined by almost 90 % .
&quot; in Russia , tour operators and charter companies will be reli@@ eved when the flights are res@@ um@@ ed . &quot;
they count on a late @-@ night rush to the Mediterranean Sea .
&quot; this week , the state television predicted cheap fruit and vegetables as soon as the Turkish imports are allowed again . &quot;
&quot; a report in Ve@@ demo@@ sti formulated it as follows : &quot; tourists there long , tomatoes here long . &quot;
but the visit had an additional political value for Moscow .
&quot; Ankara is angry to the West , as it considers its reaction to the attempted power transfer as a weak answer . &quot;
&quot; to this end , the ongoing Gro@@ ll on the sn@@ ail of EU accession negotiations and Putin - that is pi@@ vot@@ al to benefit from the cool mood and reduce the relationship of Turkey to the West . &quot;
the Russian Head of State won a bonus in Ankara with certainty that he asked for the attempted coup d &quot; é@@ tat support for the elected state organs .
&quot; this is a matter of course for Moscow , which itself has a deep @-@ seated fear of regim@@ ents . &quot;
&quot; the summit in this splendid palace at the sea enabled Russia and Turkey to portra@@ y an &quot; &quot; alliance of out@@ si@@ ders &quot; &quot; in Russia and Turkey - two countries that stum@@ ble from the west and feel badly treated and now alli@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , despite the public reconciliation , there are still major differences between the two . &quot;
&quot; the greatest difference is Syria , where Moscow recently gave itself the role as peac@@ em@@ akers , but where Russia and Turkey support opposing sides . &quot;
&quot; it could be significant that after almost three hours of initial talks , both pres@@ idents met at the press conference that they had not even stri@@ pped the subject . &quot;
&quot; the President of Turkey inten@@ tionally avoided responding to a question about their differences , while Putin decided to emphasize that . &quot;
there is no clear consensus on where a common denom@@ in@@ ator can be found in Syria .
&quot; but after months of open hos@@ tilities - and in view of the potential for a perfect disaster , when NATO member Turkey enjoyed the Russian fighter jet - it is certainly better that the two heads of state are talking to each other again . &quot;
Royal Bank of Scotland no longer available for customers outside Scotland
&quot; according to the Bank &apos;s Board of Management , the R@@ BS brand is to be reduced to a back office role . &quot;
the Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer be available for customers outside Scotland .
Ross Mc@@ E@@ wan announced the BBC Scotland that the R@@ BS brand was connected to the Bank &apos;s global ambi@@ tions .
&quot; since then , the Bank has been dist@@ ancing itself since it had to be almost collap@@ sed and res@@ cu@@ ed eight years ago . &quot;
&quot; at this time , brand drugs called &quot; R@@ BS &quot; have used to protect other end consumers . &quot;
&quot; she supported the international sport with millions of pounds of sponsor@@ ship , from Six Nations Rugby to Wim@@ ble@@ don winner Andy Murray . &quot;
but now she has decided to put more national brands in focus .
&quot; the Royal Bank of Scotland will only be available to customers in Scotland , but will not be initi@@ alized . &quot;
&quot; in England and Wales , all RS@@ B references , the de@@ centralized head office and the stock exchange are to be changed to Nat@@ West . &quot;
the Ul@@ ster Bank brand is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland .
&quot; there are other , smaller brands for retail business that will get more importance - C@@ out@@ ts , Adam &amp; Co , Dr@@ um@@ mond and Hol@@ t &apos;s Military Bank . &quot;
Mc@@ E@@ wan was inter@@ viewed during a sightseeing tour of customers and employees in In@@ ver@@ ness @-@ Shi@@ re .
&quot; he shared the BBC Scotland with : &quot; &quot; the brand RS@@ B becomes our Invest@@ ors brand as well as the brand under which our employees will be busy , as we are now becoming a bank of brands . &quot;
&quot; when the bank itself became a global brand , R@@ BS became a global brand . &quot;
&quot; now I say that we do not pursue global goals , but pursue local goals . &quot;
each of these brands will stand for something completely different in their own communities and our employees will work with the customers under these brands .
R@@ BS has already stated that it will not continue its Six Nations sponsor@@ ship and that it will increase the percep@@ ti@@ bility of the various brands in his sport sponsor@@ ship .
&quot; it is time for us to develop into the bank of the brands , as how do we focus inside ( we asked ) to make this a better bank for customers ? &quot; said the Executive Board . &quot;
&quot; it would have been very cy@@ ni@@ cal three years ago , if we had said that we would be a great bank for our customers and would have launched these stamps . &quot;
&quot; but with our work , the focus on customer needs and not our own , I think there will be a lot of changes . &quot;
&quot; we can launch these brands again , so I think the time has come . &quot;

the jo@@ ckey Swiss Fran@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori secured his 3.0@@ 00@@ th British win at New@@ market on Friday .
&quot; on his local rac@@ et@@ rack , he set a milestone on his local circuit with his second win of the night . &quot;
&quot; the 45 @-@ year @-@ old Italian is the sixth jo@@ ckey , which reaches the milestone in the flat race . &quot;
&quot; he follows Sir Gordon Ri@@ chards , Dou@@ g Smith , L@@ ester Pig@@ got@@ t , P@@ at Ed@@ dry and Wil@@ lie Car@@ son . &quot;
&quot; the three @-@ time winner D@@ ett@@ ori , who previously won G@@ ha@@ y@@ y@@ ar , said : &quot; it &apos;s something special . &quot;
I am very emotional because my family is here too
I am very happy that it happened at New@@ market because I landed here 30 years ago .
&quot; it &apos;s not a big meeting , it &apos;s not Royal As@@ cot - it &apos;s a ban@@ al Friday night with 20,000 people . &quot;
I am reli@@ eved and very modest .
D@@ ett@@ ori refers to the che@@ ers when he wins the victory at Pre@@ dac@@ ction
&quot; two yo@@ ck@@ eys have reached the milestone in the obstacle race - Jo@@ ckey Richard Johnson and the retired 20 @-@ time winner Sir Anthony Mc@@ Co@@ y , who reached more than 4,@@ 300 wins in a record breaking career . &quot;
&quot; L@@ ester Pig@@ got@@ t , the nine @-@ time der@@ b@@ ysi@@ eger had 4,@@ 493 career steps &quot;
&quot; Frank@@ ie is one of the best jo@@ ckey of Modernis@@ m , and it is no surprise that he has reached this milestone , just a few before him . &quot;
&quot; he has style and is strong , but it is his tac@@ tical intel@@ lect that distingu@@ ishes it from the others in weight control room . &quot;
&quot; he is a fantastic ambassador for races , his enthusiasm and char@@ isma enthusi@@ as@@ tically enthusiastic fans for this kind of sport for years . &quot;
&quot; I said Frank@@ ie a few weeks ago at Ep@@ som , that he had already gotten 6@@ .000 wins if he wasn &apos;t just a weekend and big tournament jo@@ ckey ! &quot;
&quot; Frank@@ ie has already ri@@ dden almost 30 years of winners in the UK , which is great . &quot;
&quot; he has a living personality , which is good for a British race , but in addition he is an incredible jo@@ ckey . &quot;
Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori celebrated the milestone with a typical Flying Dis@@ mount
&quot; from Flying Fin@@ ishes to Flying Dis@@ moun@@ ts , Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori has been the flag@@ ship of the British flat race for two decades . &quot;
it was nerve wre@@ cking .
&quot; a whole series of major tournaments , including his famous &quot; Gl@@ ory Si@@ eben &quot; in 1996 at As@@ cot , but he also survived a plane crash and got a drug prohibition . &quot;
&quot; three years ago , he initially had difficulties when he returned from his six @-@ month lock , but he showed an impressive characteristic strength to de@@ fy his doubts and to return to his best . &quot;
and he is not yet at the end - D@@ ett@@ ori once said that he wants to continue with competitions up to his at least 50.@@ ten years of life .
Russian Putin mo@@ ist Stab@@ sch@@ ef Sergei Ivan@@ ov
Russian President Vladimir Putin has un@@ expect@@ edly dismis@@ sed his Chief of Staff Serge@@ y Ivan@@ ov .
Ivan@@ ov was part of Putin &apos;s close trust .
the 63 @-@ year @-@ old was appointed Special Represent@@ ative for Environmental and Transport Affairs .
&quot; in an opinion of the Kre@@ m@@ lin , it is that Putin arranged the dism@@ iss@@ al of Ivan@@ ovo from his duties as chairman of the Russian presidential administration . &quot;
&quot; Anton V@@ ain@@ o , who had appointed Ivan@@ ov@@ s deputy since 2012 , was appointed to his successor . &quot;
&quot; V@@ ain@@ o , 44 , is a former diplom@@ at . &quot;
&quot; born 1972 in Tallinn &apos;s capital Tallinn , he graduated from the prestigious State Department of Moscow for International Relations ( M@@ GI@@ MO ) and worked in the Embassy in Tokyo . &quot;
&quot; on the Kre@@ m@@ lin &apos;s website it means ( in Russian ) , that later he was the chief manager and staff manager of the government . &quot;
&quot; he said to Putin about his appointment : &quot; &quot; thank you for your confidence . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think that it is the main task of the government to support your activity as a leader in law enforcement and controls to implement your instructions .
Putin told the Russian TV station on Friday that Ivan@@ ov asked to leave his post and V@@ ain@@ o recommended his successor .
convince the smiling faces ?
this step has made Moscow mysterious .
&quot; Serge@@ y Ivan@@ ov was one of the closest confi@@ dan@@ ed Vladimir Putin and works like him for the Soviet secret service , the K@@ GB . &quot;
&quot; as Chief of Staff , he was one of the most powerful men in the country . &quot;
&quot; at a meeting with President Putin , which was broadcast on television , both men claimed that the Chief of Staff will reti@@ re on his own request . &quot;
&quot; but despite the smile for the cameras , few of them are convinced - especially now , just before the parliamentary elections . &quot;
so is the consequence of a kind of power struggle ?
none &#91; go to You@@ tu@@ be.com &#93;
&quot; but the official statement - that a man , once praised as a potential President , would once like to lead the Russian environmental policy - reached great scep@@ ticism . &quot;
&quot; in his remarks to Putin , which are quoted on the Kre@@ m@@ lin &apos;s website , Ivan@@ ov said , &quot; It is true that I have asked you in a conversation at the beginning of 2012 , asking me this very complicated post - you could almost say - to trust posts for four years . &quot;
&quot; as it turns out , I have been chairman of the Russian President &apos;s administration for four years and eight months . &quot;
Ivan@@ ov took the post in December 2011 .
previously he was Deputy Prime Minister and Defence Minister .
he is a member of the Russian Security Council and as Putin former member of the State Security Service K@@ GB .
&quot; in the late 1990s , when Putin was Chairman of the Federal Security Service ( F@@ SB ) , who replaced the K@@ GB , Ivan@@ ov was appointed his deputy . &quot;
&quot; when Putin came to power , he called Ivan@@ ov as one of five people whom he trusted the most . &quot;
&quot; once , it was assumed that Ivan@@ ov could become President of Russia after Putin &apos;s second term as a third term of office had viol@@ ated the constitution . &quot;
&quot; but this post was taken by another , close allies Put@@ ins , Dmit@@ ry Med@@ ve@@ dev . &quot;
Putin became Prime Minister before he became president three and a half years later .
criminal Min@@ ds Star Thomas Gib@@ son fired after he hit producers
Gib@@ son was involved in a physical examination at the set of the series in Los Angeles last month .
&quot; ABC Studios and C@@ BS Television Studios , which produce the series , announced its termination in a joint statement . &quot;
&quot; Gib@@ son , who played the Special Agent Aaron Hot@@ chner , ap@@ ologi@@ zed on Thursday before the announcement of his dism@@ iss@@ al . &quot;
the set came to artistic differences and differences of opinion .
&quot; I regret the incident , &quot; &quot; he said in a message . &quot;
&quot; details about how the character Gib@@ sons from the series , which follows a team of F@@ BI agents , is expected to be released at a later date according to ABC Studios and C@@ BS Television Studios . &quot;
&quot; the 54 @-@ year @-@ old , who had previously played D@@ har@@ ma &amp; Gre@@ g in the Sit@@ com D@@ har@@ ma &amp; Gre@@ g , has been with it since the first season of the series in 2005 . &quot;
&quot; I love Criminal Min@@ ds and put my whole heart blood in the last twelve years , &quot; said Gib@@ son in a message published on Friday . &quot;

puzzles for fish that landed in the garden in Ban@@ ff
a Ban@@ ff resident demanded help in identifying the fish that appeared in his garden in Ban@@ ff .
Kevin B@@ ain thinks that there could be a sand@@ ali with the 75 fish that were sp@@ las@@ hed by a fountain .
&quot; Mr. B@@ ain , who lives about 500 meters from the sea , published a video of the spectacle on Per@@ is@@ cope in the hope that someone could shed some light on the appearance of the two inches long fish . &quot;
Que@@ ens@@ ferry Crossing : bridge now connected to Fi@@ fe
the £ 1.@@ 35 billion project is to be completed by May 2017
engineers have connected the north deck of the Que@@ ens@@ ferry Cros@@ sings with the Vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct - which means that the bridge is now connected to Fi@@ fe .
&quot; it is the first of four closing of the &quot; &quot; ceiling b@@ lower &quot; , &quot; which are approaching the completion of each of the three towers of the bridge . &quot;
&quot; the bridge @-@ section of Fi@@ fe is now 600 meters long and weighs 30,000 tons . &quot;
&quot; it has 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 tra@@ itors . &quot;
the £ 1.@@ 35 billion project is to be completed by May 2017 .
&quot; Minister of Economics , Keith Brown , made a visit to the building site today and was one of the first to go from the country to the bridge . &quot;
he said : &quot; this is a historical and symbolic moment when building the Que@@ ens@@ ferry Cros@@ sings .
&quot; we are all witnesses of an engineering art from a truly epic proportions in this project with more than 30,000 tons of concrete and steel used for this part of the bridge . &quot;
&quot; despite the massive size and weight of the bridge , the completion of the closure between the vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct and the bridge deck is a delicate activity requiring extremely precise toler@@ ances for fit . &quot;
&quot; all in all , almost 79 % of the total bridge ende@@ cks are in their place and the last section of the deck is today in Ros@@ y@@ th a concrete for the deck , which means that the entire deck is ready to be lifted on the bridge to its place . &quot;
&quot; Michael Martin , Project Manager of For@@ th Crossing Bridge Construc@@ tors said : &quot; the first closure is a major milestone in each bridge project . &quot;
&quot; with this fantastic project , the closure is future @-@ oriented high@@ - and civil engineering . &quot;
&quot; after installing the last section of the street and its connection with the Nord@@ tower deck in the expansion , we had to close the still existing gap on the north or side of the country . &quot;
this was achieved by pulling the northern Zu@@ br@@ inger bridge 700 milli@@ meters south .
this was a massive and at the same time very sensitive activity .
&quot; massive because the vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct is 222 metres long , weighs about 6,000 tons and had to be pulled upwards at a slope of about 3 % . &quot;
&quot; as the toler@@ ances , on which the team worked , were tiny - on each side they only rub@@ bed a few milli@@ meters . &quot;
&quot; fortunately , everything went very well . &quot;
rescue in Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Bay : three men are lucky to be alive
&quot; three men have &quot; &quot; luck to be alive &quot; &quot; after they were thrown off by their fishing boat before Angl@@ es@@ ey . &quot;
the Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re R@@ N@@ LI rescue station struck alarm on Friday at 13 : 20 AM after a crew watched the event in Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Bay .
the three men had difficulties to swim while their boat moved out of their own strength .
&quot; we saw how the boat turned around and imagined the worst , &quot; said the head of the rescue station of Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Vin@@ ce Jones . &quot;
&quot; fortunately the strong winds have already blown the boat out of their reach , until we left water , &quot; &quot; he added . &quot;
&quot; two of the men were saved by a local fishing boat , while the third man was exhausted at the age of 60 and was found on a boat hanging without a life@@ jacket . &quot;
they all came aboard the coastal rescue boat and were brought back to the rescue station
&quot; Jones said , &quot; &quot; The three men who were thrown into the water have happiness and still be alive . &quot;
&quot; the boot@@ motor had an emergency stop , but the boot was loos@@ ened by the person who controlled the boat . &quot;
someone has awak@@ ened today about these men .
seriously injured - man cra@@ cks on his ex @-@ girl@@ friend
a man attacked his ex @-@ girl@@ friend in Hamburg @-@ Har@@ burg with a knife and seriously injured .
&quot; like the police yesterday , the 50 @-@ year @-@ old got the key to the apartment to get his personal things . &quot;
&quot; instead , the alco@@ holi@@ zed offen@@ ders cut the clothes of his ex @-@ girl@@ friend . &quot;
&quot; when she came to the apartment , he sat on her twice . &quot;
the 44 @-@ year @-@ old was injured in the hand and on the body .
the police could arrest the perpetr@@ ator .
&quot; during the 50 @-@ year @-@ old ru@@ ined the clothes of his ex @-@ girl@@ friend , he called his mother . &quot;
this then aler@@ ted his sister .
&quot; together with her partner , the 45 @-@ year @-@ old wanted to calm her brother . &quot;
but she could not move it to leave the apartment .
that is why she went out of the house with her companions .
on the road they met the husband &apos;s ex @-@ girl@@ friend .
&quot; when the two women entered the apartment again , the 50 @-@ year @-@ old turned his sister to the side and attacked his ex @-@ girl@@ friend . &quot;
who builds ar@@ ches cheap apartments ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD and Gre@@ ens said : investors should be strengthened much more in the future . &quot;
how does one react to the bad news that Braunschweig will lose nearly 1300 low @-@ priced apartments in the coming years ?
&quot; at the next council meeting , the SPD is propos@@ ing a &quot; concept concept living . &quot; &quot;
but dispute is programmed .
&quot; first and foremost , it is about the question : who should actually build the cheap apartments ? &quot;
a regulation is missing so far .
&quot; SPD leader Christoph Brat@@ mann says : &quot; &quot; we agree with the Gre@@ ens : those who want to build on urban areas will have to show 20 percent of all flats as social housing . &quot;
&quot; however , the favorable apartments may also arise in the continu@@ ance . &quot;
&quot; the big dispute in the town hall is , however , as Brat@@ mann : &quot; how do you deal with investors who want to build on private surfaces ? &quot;
&quot; we want investors to build at least 10 percent on such surfaces , but as 20 percent of the flats as social housing . &quot;
&quot; a new municipal housing construction program , which will cost millions and is still to be financed , is intended to provide incen@@ tives for incen@@ tives . &quot;
&quot; the problem , as Brat@@ mann says , &quot; There is currently no agreement between the fra@@ ctions . &quot;
the CD@@ U would like to make as few regulations as possible .
the left wants even tough@@ er jobs for investors .
&quot; regardless of this , so Brat@@ mann , a shar@@ pen@@ ing of the situation on the housing market . &quot;
&quot; if the concept of action is implemented , it will take care of additional tasks in the construction administration . &quot;
more staff is required .
it is un@@ clear whether we will get the skilled workers .
&quot; but still the program is not entirely new : because the around 12@@ 60 new apartments , which should be built anyway . &quot;
but how do you compens@@ ate for the loss of other around 1300 low @-@ priced apartments whose funding will exp@@ ire in the coming years ?
&quot; by 2020 alone , it will be 500 apartments . &quot;
&quot; in order to prevent this , so the planned policy speaker Nicole Palm , should now be purchased from the city . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it would have to be thought to bring apartments back into pricing . &quot;
this is possible in the western city .
&quot; on one blow , the problem could be solved . &quot;
because in the western town are running for the end of the year Fri@@ sten .
around 1800 apartments you could get back in the price binding for cheap apartments .
&quot; only : they do not want the owners , the housing companies . &quot;
&quot; because the number of social housing in the Western town is increased dramatically , it is removed from the goal of so @-@ called mixing . &quot;
there should be no more concentration of social weak in just a few districts .
the Gre@@ ens reck@@ on that there is still movement in the discussion .
&quot; CEO Holger Her@@ lit@@ sch@@ ke says : &quot; &quot; for a broad majority , the CD@@ U has to go into the boat . &quot;
the focus is on more construction sites for single @-@ family homes .
but what does not mean that a compromise can still be found .
&quot; Pok@@ é@@ mon Go , a hunt for health and happiness that pays off &quot;
it is fascinating to see how the world is changing .
&quot; the fact that teenagers and children can no longer go outside , but rather prefer to spend their free time with them , star@@ ing on screens , has been lam@@ ented by many in the last decade . &quot;
Pok@@ emon Go is about getting people from the sofa and become more active .
&quot; the time on the screen was initially limited to television , then on video games , and finally on smartphones . &quot;
&quot; therefore , it is great to see that technology and outdoor activities are not mut@@ ually exclusive . &quot;
&quot; of course , I refer to Pok@@ é@@ mon Go @-@ W@@ ahn , an app that is based on the characters that were initially created for video games in the 1990s ( a cartoon series , playing cards and other spin @-@ off@@ s ) . &quot;
&quot; how many phenomena of pop culture decreased the interest before the release of the game in the USA , Australia and New Zealand in early July . &quot;
the market launch in other countries has been postpon@@ ed by the massive demand that the servers over@@ load .
within a few days Pok@@ é@@ mon Go had more users than Tin@@ der and almost as many as Twitter .
how does it work ?
&quot; in short , players go outside and search for Pok@@ é@@ mons that are tra@@ cked with a GPS and once they have been found , &quot; &quot; photograph@@ ed &quot; &quot; ( via a screen@@ shot on the phone ) or &quot; &quot; captured &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; a generation that played the game when she was younger , joined the W@@ ahn and j@@ umped for the search of the sofa . &quot;
&quot; in the US , the game led to a considerable increase in steps that the &quot; average &quot; person sets back each day . &quot;
&quot; Cardi@@ ograms , an app for Apple Watch , followed by 35@@ ,000 users , announced the Washington Post recently that within two days after the launch of the game , the number of tra@@ vers@@ ed people who train every day 30 minutes , j@@ umped from 45 percent to 53 percent . &quot;
the company does not know who plays Pok@@ é@@ mon Go - it only looks the raw data to increase performance .
&quot; many public awareness campaigns on health that people want to take &quot; &quot; take 30 minutes &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; coming from the sofa &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; to be active every day &quot; , &quot; because many public messages are getting boring and coming from people who look el@@ end . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , the importance of sport can not be over@@ rated . &quot;
whoever drives sports regularly reduces his chances of developing cancer or depression .
&quot; physical activity helps in weight control , high blood pressure , diabetes and a long list of benefits that is too long to lead them here . &quot;
&quot; but the wonderful thing about Pok@@ é@@ mon Go is that it brings people to do something outdoors , making them fun . &quot;
&quot; thus , three pillars of health are covered - exercise , fresh air and sunshine and fun . &quot;
some people even include new friend@@ ships on the hunt .
&quot; as always there are also M@@ ür@@ cher &apos;s spo@@ ils , which always have to compl@@ ain about something . &quot;
&quot; and yes , someone could walk around a door . &quot;
what is it ?
it has made a breakthrough .
&quot; even if Smartphone @-@ Apps like Fit@@ bit could already track down our activity earlier , they gave us no reason to do sport as it does this game . &quot;
the new will lose its appeal and the use will be re@@ produced with time .
&quot; however , due to Pok@@ em@@ ons success , there will be more games that will unite apps and virtual reality with the activ@@ ist in the real world and help many people to hunt the more active , f@@ itter and health@@ ier . &quot;

Simone Bil@@ es creates gold in the Dam@@ entur@@ nen
forget the pressure .
forget the hyp@@ e .
Simone Bil@@ es is on all this im@@ mu@@ n .
dynam@@ ically on the jumping horse .
effort@@ less on the beam .
stunning on the ground .
on the whole line brilliant .
and now also the Olympic champion .
the 19 @-@ year @-@ old American gymn@@ ast arrives on Thursday to the multi @-@ campaign title and enlarged the gap between himself and the rest of the world before all eyes under the head@@ light of the Olympic Games .
&quot; her overall result of 6@@ 2,@@ 198 was clearly in front of the silver medal winner and &quot; Final Five &quot; club@@ mate A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man and Russian bronze medal winner Ali@@ ya Must@@ af@@ ina . &quot;
&quot; the American women Simone Bil@@ es tur@@ nt on the Schwe@@ be@@ bal@@ ken during the multi @-@ campaign of women in the gymn@@ as@@ tics of the Summer Games in Rio de Janeiro 2016 , Brazil , Thursday . &quot;
&quot; Bil@@ es is the fourth h@@ eter@@ os@@ exual female who wins a multi @-@ fight title and overall the fifth , while she consoli@@ dates her reputation , the best of her generation or even at all . &quot;
she broke out in tears when her final result was shown and her long journey at that moment found an end .
&quot; this achievement puts it in the same league as a unique ath@@ l@@ ete like Michael P@@ helps , who brought their sports to new heights : &quot;
&quot; the last three years domin@@ ates her sport art , 15 World Champion medals - including 10 gold medals - including 10 gold medals - with such amazing exercises , that the Olympic champion of 1984 Mary Lo@@ u Rett@@ on said that she is &quot; the best gymn@@ ast I &apos;ve ever seen . &quot;
&quot; it expected a final test in Brazil , a competition that was not so much between Bil@@ es and the rest of the athletes , but rather between her and a load of over@@ sized expectations . &quot;
&quot; not return with a handful of gold back to the family in Spring , Texas , would be considered dis@@ appointment . &quot;
&quot; the Americans Simone Bil@@ es , left , and A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man embrace each other after winning gold and silver in the solo part of women during the Summer Games 2016 in Rio de Janeiro , Brazil , Thursday . &quot;
&quot; Bil@@ es took the first medal on Tuesday , while at the f@@ arewell party of the team coordin@@ ator Martha Kar@@ oly@@ i was used as ex@@ clam@@ ation mark . &quot;
&quot; although it insi@@ sted , during its long journey to the top , never planned the future , this is not really true . &quot;
part of their floor exercises - which contain their typical Tum@@ bling Pass - is matched to Latin American music that would fit at home on the street outside the Olympic arena in Rio .
this is not a coinci@@ dence .
&quot; this girl , adopted by her grand@@ parents as a small child and was discovered by trainer A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ mans &apos;s mother during a school leaving in the gymn@@ asi@@ um , where Bo@@ or@@ man trained , became a force . &quot;
&quot; since the summer of 2013 , it has not lost a multi @-@ war competition , a winning series that will continue as long as it wishes . &quot;
&quot; even if Must@@ af@@ ina was easy to lead through two turns , the image glo@@ ved . &quot;
bri@@ efs and dent@@ ur@@ ns - in which Bil@@ es holds the World Championship title - lou@@ dly .
&quot; she repeated again with 15,@@ 433 on the floating beam again - and sat on the floor with a 15,@@ 9@@ 33 . &quot;
&quot; Ra@@ is@@ man gently emb@@ raced her when she expected her grand@@ child - a pure form@@ ality - and tears flow@@ ed on Bil@@ es shiny red , white and blue eyel@@ iner , as the vision she once described in her book book . &quot;
&quot; Ra@@ is@@ man &apos;s performance was a revenge for the last time four years ago when she fought for the third place , but the bronze medal went to Must@@ af@@ ina in a Ti@@ eb@@ ra@@ ke . &quot;
&quot; this time the 22 @-@ year @-@ old team captain , named by the Americans &quot; O@@ ma , &quot; had a lead . &quot;
&quot; after her floor exercise she threw into the public kis@@ ses , overwhel@@ med by a com@@ eback , which sometimes seemed dou@@ bt@@ ful . &quot;
&quot; as far as Bil@@ es concerned , the rapidly spread out of 19 @-@ year @-@ olds has a very new meaning from the beginning of this week : &quot;
police : 3 victims in a series of series mur@@ der@@ ers fired at the music hearing in the car
&quot; according to police reports released on Thursday , two women and a 12 @-@ year old girl were shot , who died in one of the dead@@ liest attacks since a decade in the first mass mur@@ derer of Phoenix while they stopped in the car and listened to music . &quot;
&quot; Angela Roch@@ elle Liner , Stef@@ anie R. El@@ lis and El@@ lis &apos;s daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah were shot on June 12th , while the car was par@@ ked in a dri@@ v@@ eway , the authorities said . &quot;
the perpetr@@ ator fired eight shots from a fire weapon while he stood on the passenger side of the car and then fled with another vehicle to read in the report .
&quot; the police reported that the triple murder would not have been the result of a rob@@ ber@@ y , because the att@@ acker did not take the hand@@ bags or the $ 2,@@ 900 who owned one of the adult victims . &quot;
the police spokes@@ man of Phoenix S@@ g@@ t. Jonathan Howard said that the fo@@ undry has led the investig@@ ators to take a closer look at whether it is connected to four previous attacks .
&quot; in total , seven people were killed and two others injured in h@@ is@@ panic neighbor@@ hoods within four months . &quot;
&quot; it is happening in a residential area in front of a house , &quot; said Howard the K@@ HP@@ O , a subsidiary of C@@ BS , at the beginning of the month . &quot;
&quot; it is assumed that the susp@@ ect has used several vehicles , including a brown Niss@@ ans from the late 1990s , a black BMW from the late 199@@ 0@@ ies and a white Cadi@@ l@@ lac or Lincoln . &quot;
investig@@ ators refused to disclose the evidence that led them to the conclusion that the attacks were linked and committed by the same mur@@ derer .
&quot; El@@ lis , 33 , was hospit@@ alized due to her injuries and died later . &quot;
&quot; liner , 31 , and El@@ lis &apos;s daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah died on the spot . &quot;
a witness told the police that it was not unusual for her to sit in a par@@ ked car and listen to music .
the authorities also published a police report on the shooting down on an empty pick@@ up truck half an hour before the three @-@ fold murder and from which it was assumed that it was the work of the serial killer .
investig@@ ators found cartridge sleeves and secured a ball from the seat and ball fragments from the engine compartment .
mother of a 6 year old with a micro@@ cep@@ hal@@ y : &quot; it gets better &quot;
&quot; like most 6 @-@ year @-@ old Ed@@ mund Pic@@ ci@@ uto loves singing , toys and of course his mother . &quot;
&quot; but like the least of his anti@@ quity , Ed@@ mund Micro@@ cep@@ hal@@ y , the result of a genetic disorder , which his mother Elizabeth Pic@@ ci@@ uto had no idea during her pregnancy . &quot;
&quot; when he came home for the first time , my first thought was , I couldn &apos;t do it . &quot;
I don &apos;t manage it .
I didn &apos;t let me go on that .
&quot; what is wrong at all -- of course , one has left it , &quot; she said . &quot;
her husband Vincent and her have been told that Ed@@ mund may never recognize her under certain circumstances and that he may not even survive .
some doctors even went so far that they proposed to institution@@ alise him .
&quot; my first answer was &apos; I didn &apos;t know that people still do , &apos; explained Pic@@ ci@@ uto . &quot;
Ed@@ mund can walk with the help of a help@@ desk .
Ed@@ mund could neither sit nor craw@@ l up until his third year of life and he can still not speak .
but he is making progress .
it can run with support and cycling .
he also loves to play and sing with his two brothers .
Elizabeth shows the sign language that Ed@@ mund for &quot; Please sing me something before . &quot;
&quot; we teach him sign language , &quot; &quot; told Pic@@ ci@@ uto C@@ BS News . &quot;
but it is not a typical sign language -- says it . Ed@@ mund has invented some characters alone .
&quot; micro@@ cep@@ hal@@ y has a variety of causes : genetic as with Ed@@ mund , as well as infections with viruses such as meas@@ les or the Z@@ ik@@ avi@@ rus during pregnancy . &quot;
symptoms and progn@@ oses may vary greatly .
it is still too early to say how it will affect the life of the infected with the Z@@ ik@@ avi@@ rus .
Pic@@ ci@@ uto is reminis@@ cent of the emotional award of an uncertain future .
&quot; I asked constantly , what will happen ? &quot;
what will happen ?
and they still don &apos;t really know .
I have been asking for the pro@@ g@@ nosis for a long time because I don &apos;t expect them to really tell me someone .
but Pic@@ ci@@ uto has a hop@@ eful advice for mothers of inf@@ ants with birth defects caused by the Z@@ ik@@ avi@@ rus .
it gets better .
you know that it will be better for you .
you will love your child and your child will love you .
&quot; heavy ra@@ inf@@ alls , floo@@ ding gives cause for b@@ ail@@ outs in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi &quot;
heavy ra@@ inf@@ alls and large @-@ scale floo@@ ds in Lou@@ isi@@ ana compelled the governor to call on Friday the emergency state . it is expected all Saturday over with more ra@@ inf@@ alls .
&quot; numerous rivers in the southeast of Lou@@ isi@@ ana and the south of the Miss@@ issi@@ pp@@ is floo@@ ded their banks and threatened with large @-@ scale floo@@ ds to extreme ra@@ inf@@ all , reported the National Weather Service . &quot;
the Gover@@ nor of Lou@@ isi@@ ana John B@@ el Ed@@ wards agreed that state officials are in constant contact with the local authorities and are already on the way to the affected communities .
&quot; Mike Ste@@ ele , a spokes@@ man for the Office of Hom@@ eland Security and Emergency Prepar@@ edness of Gover@@ nor , agreed that the requests for flood vehicles , boats and sand bags were multip@@ lied . &quot;
&quot; Ste@@ ele said that alone , the community of Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa had requested ten thousand sand bags . &quot;
a flood warning system is used over large parts in the south of Lou@@ isi@@ ana until Saturday .
forecasts to 2019 illustrate how the market is set to change .
&quot; in the south of Alab@@ ama , a flood early warning system was used on Friday while it still ra@@ ined in the Mobile area . &quot;
&quot; the River Com@@ ite near Bat@@ on Rou@@ ges and the River Am@@ ite near Den@@ ham Springs , both of which are located in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , will all probability reach record level over the weekend . &quot;
the met@@ er@@ e@@ ologist Ale@@ k K@@ rau@@ tmann said that both rivers could flood many houses in the suburbs of Bat@@ on Rou@@ ge .
&quot; he also said that a down@@ stream in@@ und@@ ated floo@@ ding in Ascension Par@@ ish is a danger , as these rivers only slowly flow into Lake Mau@@ rep@@ as . &quot;
&quot; the river Tick@@ fa@@ w , south of the Miss@@ issi@@ ppi &apos;s state border in Liverpool , Lou@@ isi@@ ana , reached the highest level already recorded on Friday at 0@@ 9.00 . &quot;
rescue teams still plu@@ ck people out of flood water in the districts Am@@ ites and Wil@@ kinson in the Sou@@ thwest of Miss@@ issi@@ ppi .
&quot; L@@ ero@@ y Hans@@ ford , his wife and his son &apos;s son were among those who were saved on Friday near Glo@@ ster . &quot;
&quot; Hans@@ ford , 62 , says that water from Be@@ aver Creek , which is normally located more than 400 feet from his house , rose strongly overnight . &quot;
he said that he had warned him another step@@ son who lives near .
&quot; we wo@@ ke up and the water rus@@ hed and rus@@ hed in , &quot; Hans@@ ford said . &quot;
it reached my wa@@ ist .
&quot; his wife said Hans@@ ford , she had never seen such a high level of the river in the 48 years in which she lived there . &quot;
Hans@@ ford said he and his family members would have all disabilities and he would be the only one who can swim .
&quot; Hans@@ ford said that emergency hel@@ pers had saved all three in a large military truck and had brought them to the next fire station in Glo@@ ster , where they were lod@@ ged until Friday . &quot;
&quot; K@@ rau@@ tmann said that the floo@@ ding was spreading rapidly , as there were still heavy ra@@ inf@@ alls and that authorities contempl@@ ate ev@@ ac@@ uation instructions . &quot;
&quot; according to K@@ rau@@ tmann , an observer registered close to Liv@@ ing@@ stone from midnight to Friday morning of 13.@@ 75 inches of rain . &quot;
K@@ rau@@ tmann said that the ground has been substantially su@@ cked by the ra@@ inf@@ all since Wednesday .
the authorities stated that heavy ra@@ inf@@ alls and floo@@ ding floo@@ ds caused the rescue of inhabitants from their homes in Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa Par@@ ish and teaching crew in five school districts .
the C@@ BS subsidiary WW@@ L reported that there were 200 floo@@ ded houses in Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa .
&quot; the inhabitants were ev@@ acu@@ ated in two churches , which were both floo@@ ded . &quot;
&quot; the ruler of the municipality of Rob@@ by Miller said that the authorities had saved 72 people and seven pets , washed by the flood . &quot;
&quot; in the towns of Am@@ rit@@ ania and Ham@@ mond , emergency shel@@ ters were set up to host the ev@@ ac@@ uation . &quot;
&quot; once the water begins to go back , they will return to their homes again , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; in the town of Ham@@ mond of the municipality of Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa , almost two dozens of roads were closed due to flood water and sand bags for the residents to take part , who hope to keep the water from their homes and shops . &quot;
&quot; the last great floo@@ ding we had was in March , &quot; &quot; said L@@ acy Land@@ rum of the city administration . &quot;
this seems to be a similar incident .
&quot; in Miss@@ issi@@ pp , the emergency manager Ru@@ pert L@@ acy of the Har@@ rison Count@@ ys said that it still ra@@ ined on the Gulf Coast . &quot;
&quot; according to his statements , a handful of houses on Thursday were reported as floo@@ ded , but on Friday they were not reported . &quot;
&quot; Keith Tow@@ n@@ son , Manager at Shop@@ per Value F@@ oods in Am@@ ite , has been living in the area for 40 years . &quot;
&quot; I have seen water in places I have never seen before , &quot; &quot; said Tow@@ n@@ son , &quot; &quot; and it still comes . &quot;
&quot; Ma@@ ha@@ j Brown , 6 , &quot; aug@@ mented by spheres , &quot; survi@@ ves shooting in Philadelphia &quot;
&quot; the police said that the 6 @-@ year @-@ old boy was shot in Philadelphia , this week already the second time that a 6 @-@ year @-@ old child is shot . &quot;
the grand@@ parents of the boy identified him for C@@ BS Philadelphia as Ma@@ ha@@ j Brown .
&quot; the grand@@ parents stated that Brown suffered several shot wounds , including in the end , leg , arm and stomach , but that he was in consciousness during his transport . &quot;
&quot; he has gone through much , his little body was en@@ gros@@ sed by spheres , &quot; he shared his grand@@ mother Del@@ ores Mel@@ ende@@ z to the transmitter . &quot;
I can &apos;t believe that .
the condition of the boy was considered critical in a hospital and he had to undergo several operations .
the boy &apos;s family shared the station that he is expected to recover again .
he would have started the first class in a local elementary school .
brown was one of four people shot in German@@ town .
three men were also shot : two at the age of 29 and a 32 @-@ year @-@ old .
one of the 29 @-@ year @-@ old men is in critical condition ; the other two victims are in a stable state according to C@@ BS Philadelphia .
&quot; the boy was shot at the front seat of a car with the 29 @-@ year @-@ old , who is located in a critical condition , shot up , reports the transmitter . &quot;
the other two victims were not in the car and the police were investigating whether they could be among one of the injured men of the perpetr@@ ators .
investig@@ ators shared C@@ BS Philadelphia that it seems to have come to a cross @-@ fire between several sho@@ ot@@ ers .
&quot; cartridge trun@@ ks for assault rif@@ les , which were tra@@ ced back to various assault rif@@ les , se@@ wn the crime scene . &quot;
it seems that this is clearly an ongoing struggle .
&quot; on the street , on both sides of the side@@ walk , there were shells . &quot;
&quot; so it seems to have given several armed fighters , who were very active , &quot; said police officer Anthony G@@ inal@@ di of the police in Philadelphia to the station . &quot;
there were also several houses and vehicles in the area .
&quot; there was no arrest , and the police currently sc@@ rut@@ ini@@ zed the surveillance video . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday another 6 year old girl was hit by a qu@@ ag@@ ger on the arm , when she played in front of her house in the residential area of West Oak Lane . &quot;
she reco@@ vers and the police are still looking for a susp@@ ect .
why we need Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie &quot;
this is what I imagine at the gymn@@ asi@@ um in gymn@@ as@@ tics and that for more than one reason .
&quot; first of all , I have been at every summer Olympics since 1984 and the USA have never been so dominant . &quot;
&quot; second , this team has three gymn@@ asts , Simone Bil@@ es , Gab@@ by Douglas and Lau@@ ren &quot; Lau@@ rie &quot; Her@@ nan@@ dez , which inspir@@ es many young girls of other skin colour . &quot;
&quot; the structure of this team , which is A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man , the Jew@@ ess and Madi@@ son Ko@@ cian , which is Kath@@ o@@ lik@@ in , makes everyone proud . &quot;
this team finally reflects the US .
it has soli@@ di@@ fied the black and h@@ is@@ panic female presence at the top of this sport .
&quot; in the last four years , the number one under the female gymn@@ asi@@ um was an A@@ fr@@ o @-@ American woman . &quot;
&quot; last year , Simone and Gab@@ by were # 1 and # 2 . &quot;
this shows strength .
&quot; at the last Olympic Games , Gab@@ by Douglas was a surprising Olympia winning company and America . &quot;
&quot; now the world was able to witness the incredible performance of the triple world champ@@ ions Simone Bil@@ es , Douglas and Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , how they delivered unexpected but master@@ ful gymn@@ astic routines . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , Simone was the fourth , h@@ eter@@ os@@ exual female , who won gold in an individual multi @-@ campaign event for women . &quot;
team member A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man won silver .
&quot; we experience the top of this sport , but we do not see gym classes in the whole country . &quot;
&quot; Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie beat all the same way as A@@ ly and Madi@@ son to put it into the Olympic team . &quot;
&quot; they are the &quot; last five , &quot; because the next Olympic Games will only have four gymn@@ asts in the team . &quot;
&quot; but reality looks like gymn@@ as@@ tics are a more expensive sport and gymn@@ asts primarily arise in private gymn@@ as@@ tics , which are maintained by parents who pay for training , furnis@@ hing , travel clothing , competition and hotel costs ( for the trainers and their gymn@@ asts and families ) . &quot;
&quot; the majority of these clubs are in wealthy suburbs , which can support the business . &quot;
&quot; in these societies , the gymn@@ asts get their entire training and this is an expensive and long @-@ term commitment to families . &quot;
&quot; A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ man , trainer of Simone Bil@@ es , and Mag@@ gie Han@@ ey , trainer of Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , both trained their athletes since they started the gymn@@ as@@ tics . &quot;
&quot; we have to encourage the congreg@@ ations of inn@@ um@@ erable , young girls inspired by Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie , an affordable and easily accessible gymn@@ asi@@ um . &quot;
I founded my Turn@@ foundation of 20 years .
&quot; during my events , we have offered free and affordable gymn@@ as@@ tics in Harlem for more than 15,000 urban young@@ sters ( especially black and h@@ is@@ panic ) and trained national and international vic@@ tors . &quot;
&quot; in September , we will expand to Detroit ( my hom@@ etown ) to offer the youth high @-@ quality gymn@@ as@@ tics that deserve the opportunity to learn and profit from this great Olympic sport . &quot;
&quot; gymn@@ as@@ tics develop strength , flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work , discipline and determination for the mind . &quot;
this combination offers life @-@ long benefits for health as well as for academic and professional success .
&quot; it is the inspiration of this team , bringing thousands of young girls to be interested in the gymn@@ as@@ tics and that &apos;s great . &quot;
&quot; it is so important to take part in sports , especially for girls . &quot;
this is such an exciting time .
&quot; thanks Simone , A@@ ly , Lau@@ rie , Gab@@ by and Madi@@ son for this genuine presentation of &quot; Girl Power &quot; by holding the Olympic team gold and thank you , you motivated so many young girls with different backgrounds to start their way , healthy , strong and successful young women . &quot;
assist@@ ants want to organize other strikes after having rejected Jerem@@ y Hun@@ t &apos;s proposal
&quot; the ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the amendments by adop@@ ting a re@@ formed Treaty with the Func@@ tion@@ aries of the British Medical Association , but 58 percent of the 37@@ ,000 assist@@ ants voted for election . &quot;
&quot; in July , Hun@@ t had plans to introduce the contract for@@ ci@@ bly and said that the N@@ HS was found in a &quot; &quot; Ni@@ em@@ and@@ s@@ land &quot; &quot; and any further delay for the employees and patients would be harmful . &quot;
&quot; the first assist@@ ants are to receive a new contract , which includes changes to night and weekend trips , to improve the maintenance of day @-@ to @-@ day times . &quot;
&quot; Dr Ellen Mc@@ Court , the chair@@ person of the B@@ MA committee for assistance physicians , reported last night in a message with : &quot; assist@@ ants have still serious concerns to the proposed contract , in particular that it will heat up the current occupation crisis and it will be given to treat all doctors . &quot;
&quot; with only eight weeks remaining until the first group of doctors falls under the new contract , progress must be made and time runs out . &quot;
efforts by the B@@ MA to resolve disputes by discussions with the government on rel@@ u@@ ct@@ ance and sometimes on ear @-@ num@@ bing silence .
&quot; this happened to a promise made by Jerem@@ y Hun@@ t last month , that his door would always be open . &quot;
&quot; Jerem@@ y Hun@@ t must act now , raise the condition and address the concerns of the assistant physicians . &quot;
&quot; if he does not do this , the assist@@ ants have made clear that they are ready to carry out further work campaigns . &quot;
&quot; the last strike at the end of April saw a postpon@@ ement of nearly 13@@ ,000 routine operations and 100,000 appointments , as nur@@ ses and specialists were involved in gran@@ ting doctors on the strike chain . &quot;
the ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the amendments by adop@@ ting the Re@@ formed Treaty with the Func@@ tion@@ aries of the British Medical Association .
&quot; the B@@ MA wants a better weekend remun@@ eration for the 54@@ 0,000 assist@@ ants that are subject to the contract . &quot;
&quot; Daniel Mor@@ timer , CEO of the N@@ HS employees , called on the assist@@ ants to stop the strike . &quot;
&quot; Mor@@ timer said : &quot; &quot; work combat measures do not reach anything of the only little , but already loads over@@ loaded teams and service providers and prepare the patients , nur@@ ses and their families only worry , need and break . &quot;
&quot; in the last two months , we talked to the committee of the assist@@ ants and responded positively to the concerns regarding the guar@@ di@@ an@@ ship and whi@@ stle @-@ leb@@ low@@ ings with the Ministry of Health and other mini@@ stries . &quot;
&quot; employers hoped that continuing positive engagement with other important topics - such as sending , flexibility in training , training courses , mutual recognition of the curriculum , training holidays and the gender @-@ specific wage differential in medicine - were a sign of how serious it was the employers , the Health Education England and the Ministry of Health regarding compliance with the B@@ MA in November , February and May . &quot;
the £ 2 @-@ per day medication that can reduce the risk of heart attack
thousands of heart disease patients will benefit from a £ 2 @-@ per day medication after recommended by the authorities to admini@@ ster this more people for a longer period .
the medicine T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or reduces the risk of repeated heart attacks for persons with heart disease .
&quot; the medication is administered for 12 months after a heart attack , reducing the risk of stroke or another heart attack . &quot;
the N@@ ICE regulation agency has recommended a four @-@ year intake to further reduce cardiovascular problems .
the N@@ ICE regulation agency has recommended a four @-@ year intake to further reduce cardiovascular problems .
&quot; around 14@@ 0,000 people suffer from a heart attack each year and a quarter of them suffer another heart attack or stroke . &quot;
&quot; heart attacks and stro@@ kes are caused by accumulation of fatty material in the ar@@ tery walls , forming the floor@@ ings . &quot;
&quot; when the covering breaks apart , it can cause blood cl@@ ots causing blood flow to the heart , causing a heart attack . &quot;
&quot; if the blood cl@@ ots dis@@ solve , it can flow through the blood stream and clo@@ g the blood flow to the brain , causing a stroke . &quot;
persons who have already had a heart attack are subject to higher risk .
&quot; T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , produced by the British company A@@ stra@@ Zen@@ eca and marketed under the Bri@@ li@@ que trade name , reduces this risk by making the formation of blood cl@@ ots more prob@@ able . &quot;
&quot; the introduc@@ tory design of N@@ ICE which was published today recommends a 12 @-@ month intake of 90@@ mg T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , followed by 60@@ mg with twice daily intake of aspir@@ in for the next three years . &quot;
&quot; Professor Car@@ ole Long@@ son , Director of the N@@ ICE health technology evaluation centre said : &quot; &quot; despite the availability of secondary prevention , a quarter of all persons who have suffered a heart attack , have another heart attack or a stroke - often with dis@@ astro@@ us consequences . &quot;
the fear of a renewed heart attack can have considerable negative effects on the quality of life of a person .
experience shows that T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or is effective in reducing other heart attacks and stroke attacks in people who already had a heart attack .
&quot; due to a provis@@ ional recommendation by T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , we are pleased that we are able to expand available treatment options to thousands of people who can benefit from it . &quot;
the information on the efficacy and safety of T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or - especially the risk of bleeding - is limited to a period of up to three years .
culture of Political Cor@@ rect@@ ness bl@@ ur@@ ts electoral fraud in Muslim areas
&quot; last year , the former mayor of Tower Ham@@ lets Lut@@ fur Rah@@ man was removed from office due to corruption from office last year . &quot;
a culture of Political Cor@@ rect@@ ness has led to know@@ ingly ignored widespread electoral fraud in Muslim communities like a devast@@ ating government report today .
&quot; the former member of the cabinet of Sir Eric Pic@@ kles verb@@ ally grab@@ s the police , election ob@@ servers and town halls to have ignored pro@@ ofs of electoral abuse due to &quot; over@@ sensitivity regarding eth@@ ni@@ city and religion . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the former Minister of Integration and Municipal Government , who is now an anti @-@ cor@@ rup@@ tion@@ ist , said that the inti@@ mid@@ ation of constitu@@ ents from religious motives is so bad that the police should be allowed to set off barriers outside of voting power to protect inti@@ mid@@ ated voters . &quot;
he recommends that voters should take a passport to prove their identity in elections .
&quot; at present , a vot@@ er has to name his name and address . &quot;
&quot; the report proposes to apply not removable ink on the finger of a person , when they submit their votes to prevent someone to choose twice . &quot;
&quot; whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower should get more protection , says Sir Eric . &quot;
it demands that the press should have more access to church documents and decisions of not official committees or working groups .
&quot; this serves not only against electoral fraud , but also to protect the municipal government from the broader corruption and financial fraud culture associated with it , &quot; he said . &quot;
the report was arranged by Dow@@ ning Street as a result of Tower Ham@@ let &apos;s election sc@@ andal in eastern London .
&quot; last year , a special Elec@@ toral Court decided that the reig@@ ning mayor Lut@@ sk Rah@@ man should be reli@@ eved after a lit@@ any of corrupt and illegal practices of his ministry . &quot;
&quot; the Court found that Rah@@ man had per@@ ver@@ ted the religious feelings of his Muslim community &quot; in cy@@ ni@@ cal way , &quot; and that he would have put his critics to silence with rac@@ ism and Islam@@ opho@@ bia . &quot;
Rah@@ man is said to have led his campaign on the basis that it is the religious duty of Muslims to choose him .
up to 300 voices were either dou@@ bt@@ ful or the result of an im@@ itation in which one person sel@@ ects someone else .
Sir Eric said that there was evidence of fraud throughout the country .
&quot; in particular , he expressed al@@ armed opposition to frau@@ dul@@ ent brief@@ ing - who had made pressure on people to elect a candidate of their choice . &quot;
&quot; Sir Eric , pic@@ tured , made several recommendations to clean the electoral system , including the guide of instruc@@ ting to prove the identity . &quot;
&quot; in his report it is said : &quot; &quot; evidence was attached that pressure has been exer@@ ted on vulnerable members of some ethnic minorities , especially women and young people in order to choose according to the will of the elderly , in particular communities with pak@@ ist@@ ani or bang@@ lad@@ y@@ fish background . &quot;
there were concerns that ... state institutions have know@@ ingly ignored such behavior due to &quot; politically correct &quot; hyper@@ sensitivity related to eth@@ ni@@ city and religion .
&quot; Sir Eric spoke out 50 recommendations to clean the system , including the ban that political activists are editing brief@@ ing documents in order to stop &quot; nom@@ inees . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the report adopted by Ther@@ esa May also requires tough@@ er registration checks to prevent the electoral code being used for immigration and social security purposes . &quot;
consider choosing elec@@ tors before choosing your ID .
&quot; not removable ink on the finger of a person , as soon as she has released her voice to prevent someone to choose twice . &quot;
systematic reviews on the nationality of a person perform to ensure that they are optional .
a three @-@ year limitation on applications for automatic post@@ code .
ban that political activists edit full let@@ ter@@ ies and envel@@ opes of let@@ ter@@ ies .
the police provide the authority to set up shut @-@ off stations .
&quot; a change of legislation , which made an indictment for inti@@ mid@@ ation in accordance with the Repres@@ entation of the People Act 1983 ( Legis@@ lative Dec@@ ree 1983 ) . &quot;
photography ban in elec@@ tive stations .
requirement that only English must be used in the elec@@ tive stations ( except for Wales ) .
&quot; intensi@@ fication of the training , to ensure that the employees rule the rule that voters will go alone in the election cabin . &quot;
Sir Eric falls over the Metropolitan Police and finds it &quot; amazing &quot; that after the Tower Ham@@ let case there was no criminal complaint .
&quot; the election court held Lut@@ fur Rah@@ man and his deputy for a lit@@ any of corrupt and illegal practices as un@@ suitable , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; due to a number of reasons , it was found guilty - according to the high requirements in criminal proceedings - found guilty . &quot;
he also critic@@ ises the eff@@ ec@@ tual &quot; Ab@@ ha@@ k@@ Controll@@ ers &quot; of the Ele@@ ction Sec@@ tions of the Town Hall .
&quot; Sir Eric said : &quot; &quot; the Court of Justice in Tower Ham@@ lets last year was a warning signal . &quot;
&quot; our country , as the mother of parliam@@ ents , bears a proud heritage , but the wor@@ rying and cover@@ t spread of electoral fraud and den@@ ial of some authorities thre@@ aten this good reputation . &quot;
crazy about K@@ ates Rad@@ ler @-@ Doppel@@ gän@@ gerin and other famous Doppel@@ gän@@ ger von Olympi@@ as@@ port@@ lern in Rio
&quot; fans of the 2016 Olympics in Rio have come across the French cycl@@ ist Pau@@ line Ferr@@ and @-@ Pre@@ v@@ ot , apart from the edge and the band , who proved to be an impressive Doppel@@ gän@@ gerin of the Du@@ chess of Cambridge . &quot;
but the 24 @-@ year @-@ old Olymp@@ ion@@ ik@@ in is by far not the only one to have gold fighting ath@@ l@@ ete who has its own famous Doppel@@ gän@@ ger - at least not if you are allowed to believe in social media .
&quot; in honor of the Olympic Games in Rio and all the famous faces that are currently running on our screens , F@@ emails has created a list of Olympic Games that show more than just a certain simil@@ arity with Hollywood @-@ famous . &quot;
&quot; the hunter and the wolf : team member of the U.S. squ@@ ad Bra@@ dy El@@ lis@@ on , left , has been compared with Leonardo Di@@ Cap@@ rio since his childhood . &quot;
&quot; besides K@@ ates Doppel@@ gän@@ gerin on the radar track , many people on the internet showed how a certain ar@@ cher of the twin from A @-@ Pro@@ mi Leonardo Di@@ Cap@@ rio could be . &quot;
the team member of the U.S. squ@@ ad Bra@@ dy El@@ lis@@ on caused a rush on Twitter after pictures on which he sees the Wolf of Wall Street Star in@@ secre@@ tly resem@@ bling .
&quot; in fact , the ar@@ cher got the ma@@ dness in the social media and admitted that he has already heard from his childhood that he looks like Leo . &quot;
&quot; I see no great res@@ emb@@ lance , with the exception of facial hair , &quot; said Bra@@ dy of Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post . &quot;
&quot; he is a good looking guy , so I think it is a compli@@ ment . &quot;
one of the most popular compar@@ isons since London 2012 will undoubtedly be the focus of this year : the striking simil@@ arity between the British Wei@@ t@@ spr@@ inger Gre@@ g Ru@@ ther@@ ford and the popular actor N@@ eil Patrick Har@@ ris .
&quot; the Russian gymn@@ ast Ali@@ ya Must@@ af@@ ina with her big , expressive eyes should go through to the Cub@@ an American singer Gl@@ oria Est@@ ef@@ an . &quot;
and in the swimming pool the South African Schwi@@ mmer Cameron van der Bur@@ gh was compared to G@@ lee Star Matthew Mor@@ rison for years .
&quot; a gear higher : this user believes Nathan is the &quot; &quot; athle@@ tic version &quot; &quot; of the inc@@ eption actor . &quot;
&quot; another sustained comparison was drawn between the tennis star Raf@@ ael Nad@@ al and actor Jos@@ h Hart@@ nett , who has similarly heavy eyeb@@ rows and lips . &quot;
&quot; the Russian Silver Med@@ al Show in Y@@ uli@@ a E@@ f@@ im@@ ova points more than just the sun@@ t@@ anned skin and blond hair as the act@@ ress Ann@@ aly@@ n@@ ne Mc@@ Cord , while the American was attacked by fans , an &quot; athle@@ tic version of Joseph Gordon Lev@@ itt . &quot; &quot;
&quot; strong women : football star Hope Solo , left , and D@@ ex@@ ter act@@ ress Jennifer Car@@ p@@ enter , on the right , have a similar visual form and eyes &quot;
not the only thing : a Twitter user was very happy that others have noticed the simil@@ arities too .
&quot; put theory into space : according to this user , there is perhaps one reason for the simil@@ arity of the couple . &quot;
a Twitter User@@ in explained their satisfaction that &quot; the rest of the Internet thinks that Hope Solo and Jennifer Car@@ p@@ enter are almost identical .
&quot; in fact , the US football star Hope Solo and the D@@ ex@@ ter act@@ ress Jennifer Car@@ p@@ enter have an incredibly similar face and eyes . &quot;
&quot; other popular compar@@ isons included K@@ err@@ i Wal@@ sh @-@ J@@ enn@@ ings and her smile , which is almost identical to the act@@ ress Laura Lin@@ ney as well as the gold medal winner at the Gab@@ by Douglas , who has her own wonderful , wide smile , resem@@ bling Br@@ ing It On Star Gabri@@ elle Union . &quot;

&quot; the Canadian broad@@ c@@ aster C@@ BC had to ap@@ ologi@@ ze after one of his comment@@ ators said that the 14 @-@ year @-@ old Chinese float was &quot; &quot; as low &quot; &quot; and during the race like &quot; &quot; a pig died . &quot;
&quot; the comment@@ ator By@@ ron Mac@@ Don@@ al@@ ds thought his microphone was turned off , as he put his own opinions at the end of the 4x@@ 200m fre@@ est@@ anding squ@@ ad@@ ron . &quot;
&quot; Mac@@ Donald who was brought aboard the C@@ BS commentary team to give more &quot; color , &quot; you could hear : &quot; this little 14 @-@ year Chinese Chin@@ es@@ in has lost the connection , baby . &quot;
&quot; excit@@ edly , went down like a low , died like a pig . &quot;
thanks for this .
&quot; the Chinese float in Ai Yan@@ han , 14 , sw@@ am the second stage of the swimming staff@@ el 1 : 57,@@ 79 - 1.@@ 61 seconds slower than Canada &apos;s Taylor Ru@@ ck , making it possible for Canadi@@ ans to fill the gap to China . &quot;
viewers across Canada quickly responded quickly after they were sho@@ cked by sound and language
&quot; Emm@@ ett Mac@@ far@@ lane twe@@ ete , &quot; Do@@ es the C@@ BC comment@@ ator just said that the 14 @-@ year @-@ old float from China &quot; was dead &quot; ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?

&quot; Ai Yan@@ han from China was described as described in the final 4 x 200m fre@@ estyle squ@@ ad@@ ron for women as follows : &quot; this little 14 @-@ year Chinese Chin@@ es@@ in has lost the connection , baby . &quot;
the criticism against By@@ ron Mac@@ Donald on Twitter came fast and hard in which many people asked him
Twitter users did not stop when they heard how un@@ sensitive By@@ ron Mac@@ Donald was
&quot; another Twitter user Sarah Paradi@@ s wrote : &quot; wow , # By@@ ron@@ Mac@@ Donald . &quot;
you represent the C@@ BC and Canada and let us look like R@@ assi@@ sts . # ange@@ ek@@ elt .
&quot; a short time later Scott Russ@@ el , who hosted the C@@ BC broadcast live for the comment of Mac@@ Donald , said : &quot; we ap@@ ologi@@ ze that the comment has been broadcast about a swimming performance . &quot;
&quot; it was an un@@ happy wor@@ ding , we are sorry that it happened . &quot;
C@@ BC ap@@ ologi@@ zed at the end of 90 times with the people who responded to B@@ emer@@ kt via Twitter
the comment@@ ator colleague Scott Russ@@ el had to ap@@ ologi@@ ze in the name of Mac@@ Donald
C@@ BC copied and added his ap@@ ology to more than 90 other Twitter users who compl@@ ained about Mac@@ Donald &apos;s comments
the network also ap@@ ologi@@ zed quickly and gave a message .
we regret it sincer@@ ely that these statements were made and that it was made possible for them to be broadcast .
&quot; yesterday night , we were quick to ap@@ ologi@@ ze to our viewers on the show and our followers in the social media . &quot;
&quot; to clarify one , B@@ yr@@ ons &apos;s comments related to the power of the float and not on it as a person . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , they were in@@ appropriate and an un@@ happy wor@@ ding . By@@ ron does what he said very sorry . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday afternoon , Mac@@ Donald ap@@ ologi@@ zed in the show and tried to justify his re@@ mark by stating that it was not his intention that it was designed as a personal attack . &quot;
&quot; I would like to take a moment to ap@@ ologi@@ ze for the comment , which I made after the women &apos;s squ@@ ad@@ ron in the C@@ BC Olympic program , he said . &quot;
&quot; I was referring to the power of the float , not referring to it as a person . &quot;
&quot; of course , no cont@@ emp@@ t was intended and I am very sorry . &quot;
&quot; buyer in Pri@@ mark ou@@ tra@@ ged about women , who have under@@ gone under@@ wear in the middle of the shop . &quot;
&quot; the buyers didn &apos;t know where to see , when a woman went out to dress her clothes in the middle of a pri@@ mar@@ row to try under@@ pants . &quot;
&quot; to wor@@ sen the situation , she numbered , as she looked at it , pulled her out and laid her back to the shelf . &quot;
&quot; she travelled further and tried four pairs of under@@ pants in a shop at the Bou@@ ver@@ ie Place Shopping Centre in Folk@@ estone , Germany . &quot;
&quot; the Pri@@ mark shop in the Bou@@ ver@@ ie Place shopping center in Folk@@ estone , where the woman tried the under@@ pants before she put her back into the shelf . &quot;
&quot; a mother of two children , Jenny Davi@@ dson , who was in business at the same time , said that after the mysterious woman tried the under@@ garments , &quot; she d@@ anced and left the shop without buying anything . &quot;
&quot; she said , &quot; &quot; The people could not believe what they saw . &quot;
&quot; standing in the middle of the sales area , she took a pair of under@@ pants out of the position , pulled off their own sto@@ cking pants and pants and tried them . &quot;
&quot; she did not even try to find a little more discre@@ et place to do it - she just stood there , che@@ ek@@ y like O@@ sk@@ ar . &quot;
&quot; everyone star@@ ed when she pulled out the under@@ pants , which you obviously didn &apos;t like , as she put her back to the shelf . &quot;
&quot; she repeated the same with three more under@@ pants , before she finally decided that her didn &apos;t fall back and went out . &quot;
she did not seem to distur@@ b that she was watching someone - or thinking about the person who might buy the under@@ pants which she had ta@@ sted .
&quot; Davi@@ dson , 33 , who lives in K@@ ent said : &quot; &quot; how hard to think that someone would take shelter with home that had a different person and who were not washed . &quot;
the incident occurred on Tuesday afternoon .
&quot; MS Davi@@ dson added : &quot; &quot; as I received , the employees tried to draw the garments from selling after they went - which is just as good . &quot;
I would hate to go home with a new pair of under@@ pants and find out that another woman had her and pulled out and they were not washed away .
&quot; a spokes@@ man for Pri@@ mark said : &quot; &quot; Pri@@ mark is aware of the incident taking place on Tuesday , 9 August at our Fili@@ ale in Folk@@ stone . &quot;
all products in question were drawn from the sale .
how to protect yourself with Kra@@ v Mag@@ a against weapons of arms
&quot; the world outside is a dangerous place , but this video of Daily@@ @ could make it a bit safer for you . &quot;
&quot; we talked to Rh@@ one Mi@@ z@@ ra@@ chi , a Grand Master of the Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Association in New York to find out how to deal with armed rob@@ bers at close distance . &quot;
&quot; regardless of whether you approach you from the front or from behind , this video will show you how you turn around for your pre@@ dat@@ or . &quot;
&quot; when one approaches you from behind , you should turn around first so that you can see your aggres@@ sor and get out of the shooting line , &quot; says Mi@@ z@@ ra@@ chi . &quot;
then take the weapon between your front arm and your shoulder before you beat him with your free el@@ bow .
&quot; beat him with the knee into the bar and turn , while the att@@ acker is cro@@ oked before pain , the weapon out of his hands . beat him with the barrel and move back@@ wards while holding the weapon on it . &quot;
&quot; near att@@ ack@@ ers approaching from the front , the technique is similar - move your body from the shot line , seize the weapon and turn it so that the att@@ acker can not shoot . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , shift the weight to the weapon and hit the att@@ acker on the chest , then turn the gun out of its grip before moving backward and set the weapon on it . &quot;
sounds difficult ?
watch the video to see exactly how Mi@@ z@@ ra@@ chi is doing .
&quot; but remember that in a rob@@ ber@@ y , it is the saf@@ est to transfer your money - if you are not a Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Grand@@ master . &quot;

&quot; the present@@ er and the author Ian W@@ right , 51 , from Su@@ ff@@ ol@@ k shot his course on a Euro ticket , a ban@@ ister at the Pic@@ ca@@ dil@@ ly Circus , a r@@ ins@@ ing button of a pull toilet and a public telephone in Russia to demonstrate the resili@@ ence of his immune system . &quot;
&quot; before leaving any object , he used a lumin@@ aire to show and show us what he is going to get into . &quot;
&quot; but the experiment , which was fil@@ med under the title &quot; The L@@ ick@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength , &quot; brought some surprising results . &quot;
&quot; the thought of le@@ aking up the r@@ ins@@ ing button of a pull toilet that was already used by thousands of others may be completely rep@@ ul@@ sive , but actually there are more bad bacteria in a kitchen sink . &quot;
&quot; on his journey through Europe , Mr. W@@ right spoke with doctors and medical professionals about the promotion of gut bacteria and his own health . &quot;
&quot; fortunately , nothing left what he li@@ cked , more than a bad after@@ taste in the mouth . &quot;
W@@ right became known to test the resili@@ ence of his Dar@@ ms by traveling through the world and ate peculiar as well as wonderful things .
&quot; from public rail@@ ways to train stations , up to cub@@ es of toilets , the task put his immune system defini@@ tively under a sample . &quot;
&quot; he told : &quot; &quot; as a child I was relatively in@@ worried about what my health concerns and I put all sorts of things into my mouth , earth , wor@@ ms and mud water . &quot;
&quot; in the film , he was in charge of his reputation . &quot;
the only thing he refused was a dirty public toilet in Russia .
his trial line showed an L@@ umin@@ omet@@ ry of more than 4000 units .
&quot; compared to this , the L@@ umin@@ omet@@ ry number is less than 60 . &quot;
&quot; but there was a Russian toilet that he refused to lick , after their L@@ umin@@ omet@@ ry count was over 4000 units while freshly washed hands have one of less than 60 &quot;
&quot; Mr. W@@ right and Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Vali@@ o produced the guide &quot; The L@@ ick@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength , &quot; which shows the number of bacteria in different places like the bathroom . &quot;
&quot; in the film he says : &quot; &quot; this comes to the worst thing I have ger@@ o@@ cked in a toilet . &quot;
there is nothing more dirty than that !
I will not lick anything here because it &apos;s disgu@@ sting here .
&quot; the L@@ ick@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength &quot; was produced in cooperation with the Finnish producer of dairy products vali@@ o .
&quot; the company provides Mr. W@@ right with Vali@@ o Gef@@ il@@ us , which contains both lac@@ tic acid bacteria and vitamin C and D to help promote intestinal bacteria and immune system . &quot;
&quot; Vali@@ os Senior Venice President for Snacks , ju@@ ices and new categories N@@ iko Vu@@ or@@ en@@ ma@@ a said : &quot; we wanted to offer consumers something new . &quot;
something that is fascinating to look at and at the same time explains the advantages of pro@@ biotics .
we performed crazy bra@@ inst@@ or@@ ming that ended that we told &quot; Let &apos;s call Ian . &quot;
they claim that interest in gut health is becoming a global phenomenon
&quot; instead of talking about the products , we wanted to put them into a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment , the importance of gut health and how it is associated with the immune system . &quot;

I also think the film shows that we have a great sense of humor !
&quot; Tom Hak@@ ala , who led the film direction , added : &quot; let me tell me this way - I would have lost my respect for Ian , if he had ta@@ sted some of the things I have instruc@@ ted him to lick , just like the ec@@ el@@ ous Russian toilet that is shown in the film . &quot;
&quot; of course , there were things in which it was easier to bring Ian to le@@ ak them and others , in which this was quite difficult . &quot;
I am glad that we recorded some of these dirty goo@@ dies on film .

&quot; social family destro@@ ys before del@@ og@@ ation social housing in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall &quot;
&quot; an as@@ o@@ zi@@ al family left their social housing after a del@@ og@@ ation with a loss of £ 50,000 because they terr@@ orized their neighbors . &quot;
&quot; T@@ anya Skel@@ don and her partner Sh@@ au@@ n Tre@@ bil@@ cock were thrown into S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall after a long list of complaints . &quot;
&quot; after they were for@@ ci@@ bly removed from their property , sho@@ cked employees of the housing association found the property in an ir@@ repar@@ able condition . &quot;
&quot; the walls pointed slo@@ ping holes , wooden boards were torn , gar@@ bage was disper@@ sed on the floor and gra@@ ff@@ iti was lubri@@ cated at the walls . &quot;
the family have been moved and it is assumed that it is now living in a private accommodation
&quot; Donn@@ a Mc@@ Ev@@ oy , who works for home administration at Corn@@ wall Housing , said that she feared that the apartment was no longer repaired . &quot;
she said : &quot; it was an absolute night@@ mare for the people here and I think people don &apos;t have to live in this way .
&quot; there are many things to consider , since this property is thought to be regarded as not as beautiful part of Corn@@ wall . &quot;
the family is not@@ orious and their reputation is also .
&quot; the couple had three sons who lived in the apartment in the meantime and the police said that the terror that the family had added , road@@ fights with bas@@ eball bats , inti@@ mid@@ ations of residents , drug abuse , drug traff@@ icking and excessive scre@@ ams , stri@@ kers and flu@@ kes included . &quot;
&quot; Skel@@ don , 47 , whose name was on the lease , received an arrangement for anti @-@ social behavior in June . &quot;
&quot; in some rooms of the house , which may be torn down under certain circumstances , old gar@@ bage was found &quot;
&quot; in the estate , where drugs were tra@@ ded in the past , the wooden panels were torn apart . &quot;
neighbours said that they had to fight them on the road and regularly inv@@ oked the police
Corn@@ wall housing led her and her partner this week for@@ ci@@ bly by the property after giving them an extended period of 11 weeks to volunteer .
the del@@ og@@ ation was che@@ ered by lighten@@ ed neighbours who said their lives were made to hell .
&quot; one said , &quot; &quot; They were not afraid of anyone . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we lived for 20 years along with them and it was always bad .
the countless times we say the police here are incredible .
&quot; this morning we could not sleep . &quot;
we stood up because it was so quiet here - we are not acc@@ u@@ stom@@ ed to it !
&quot; now , where they are finally gone , it will become beautiful . &quot;
&quot; Adam F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck , Nei@@ gh@@ bour@@ hood En@@ forcement Manager of Corn@@ wall Housing , said that the family had failed to cooperate with the local authorities . &quot;
&quot; the family lived in the house to which the police was rec@@ alled at regular intervals , 20 years long . &quot;
&quot; on the over@@ grown side of the village house , gar@@ bage and old toys were thrown down &quot;
&quot; he added : &quot; &quot; it is a shame that the r@@ enter agre@@ es to accept any responsibility for their behaviour and their family because a del@@ og@@ ation is always the last step , considering the Corn@@ wall Housing . &quot;
&quot; this was a very difficult case , because the behaviour was extreme and their deeds for their neighbours had to be horri@@ ble . &quot;
&quot; I appreciate all the work that my team , the De@@ von and Corn@@ wall police and members of the community who have cour@@ age@@ ously joined us and have provided us with the information . &quot;
&quot; I hope that this development will don@@ ate some neighbors , and the message convey@@ s that anti@@ social behavior is not toler@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck said that all three sons had lived at different times in the house , but that they were all over 20 . &quot;

workers of the house @-@ government will now have to blu@@ ish gar@@ bage mountains that surround the house
&quot; in 2014 , the police conducted a raid in the house and found over 70@@ g cannabis as well as scales , par@@ ap@@ her@@ n@@ als and cash in the amount of £ 1,@@ 700 . &quot;
Skel@@ don was given a fine of money after having found guilty of the possession of a drug of class B in commercial terms .
&quot; she claimed that the money for a tom@@ b@@ stone of her son Lee Skel@@ don , who came to life in 2013 at a car accident . &quot;
&quot; after being without shelter , T@@ anya and her partner are now living in a private accommodation in Pl@@ y@@ mouth . &quot;
many rooms of the house were sum@@ med up with gra@@ ff@@ iti .
&quot; the police says that they are going to dle ten@@ ants , who do not stick to the house rules &quot;
&quot; Angela C@@ row of De@@ von and Corn@@ wall police reported that del@@ og@@ ation was a clear warning to the other ten@@ ants , who do not stick to the house rules . &quot;
&quot; this goes to those who think that they can behave themselves without self @-@ repro@@ ach , as well as those who have been har@@ med by such behaviour , &quot; she said . &quot;
De@@ von and Corn@@ wall will never toler@@ ate criminal and anti @-@ social behaviour that will continue to work with partners to protect our communities .
tourists in Portugal in panic after a ti@@ eff@@ e military jet beach over@@ flies
&quot; sun seek@@ ers in Av@@ eiro , Portugal lived the shock of their lives &quot;
a portu@@ g@@ isi@@ es@@ che P @-@ 3@@ C Ori@@ on aircraft of air strikes put an incredible storm
&quot; the air forces indicated that it was on a training flight , but insi@@ sted that no security risk was &quot;
&quot; this was the moment when the fri@@ ghtened tourists begin to panic , after a ti@@ ghtly @-@ lying jet ski@@ pped over a full beach . &quot;
dramatic video recordings showed how the military air@@ plane flew almost close to the sun in Av@@ eiro in the north of Portugal .
&quot; the vac@@ ation@@ ers sprang up when they understand@@ ably began to worry about the noise of the bushes , without seeing what was coming up by the clouds . &quot;
&quot; the incident happened yesterday afternoon in Costa Nova , near Av@@ eiro . &quot;
&quot; Daniel Fern@@ andes , one of the many tourists who posted videos about the dramatic Fly @-@ By in the social media , said : &quot; &quot; it flew very deep twice and there was a moment when it looked like it would crash . &quot;
&quot; N@@ un@@ o Ar@@ ro@@ ja added : &quot; &quot; I was just surfing and it felt like the plane would fall down on me . &quot;
tourists at Av@@ eiro beach were in panic when the plane came out of the darkness and flew incredibly low
&quot; the Portuguese air forces today announced that the pilot of the P @-@ 3@@ C Ori@@ on plane was on a training flight to identify fishing boats off the coast , so that it had to fly so deeply that this was the only way to recognize it . &quot;
&quot; the speaker said the jet flew lower than usual due to poor visibility in nearby area fires , but the air forces insi@@ sted that safety was at no time je@@ op@@ ardi@@ zed . &quot;
&quot; area fires have destroyed these summer parts of the Portuguese mainland , with which four people on the island Madeira came to death . &quot;
&quot; the Portuguese air forces today announced that the pilot had to fly so deeply , because of the conditions - heavy fog and smoke - which limits his view . &quot;
the plane was on a training flight with which the pilot had to identify fishing boats as part of the exercise .
Super@@ cup : Bar@@ ca with worry about Sevilla
Sev@@ ille - FC Barcelona is fighting for the first step in the new football season on Sunday .
&quot; the Catal@@ ans compete against the FC Sevilla in the du@@ el around the Spanish Super@@ cup , the back@@ lash rises three days later at Camp No@@ u . &quot;
&quot; the Double@@ gew@@ inner must ren@@ ounce in forces with the inferior Cup@@ fin@@ alists and ruling Europa League champion , among others on N@@ ey@@ mar , who with Brazil den@@ ies the olymp@@ ic football tournament . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Go@@ alie Marc @-@ Andr@@ e is also missing . &quot;
&quot; in the training , the German suffered a change of change in the knee , which was clari@@ fied at least in favour of Claudio Bra@@ vo at least for the benefit of Claudio Bra@@ vo . &quot;
&quot; for two years , Chil@@ ean International and T@@ er St@@ egen vie for status as number one . &quot;
&quot; in this respect , coach Luis En@@ ri@@ que ren@@ ounced a clear decision and made Bra@@ vo in the league , but T@@ er St@@ egen in most of the remaining Candi@@ dates will take the lead . &quot;
&quot; before the first mandatory game of the new season , there are doubts about the fitness level of the team , which was humili@@ ated on Saturday in a test game of Liverpool with 0 : 4 . &quot;
also at 3 : 2 in the Pro@@ beg@@ al@@ opp versus S@@ amp@@ d@@ oria on Wednesday Li@@ onel Mess@@ i and Co. did not really convince .
Sev@@ ille again has to di@@ gest the 2 : 3 defeat after extension in the European Super@@ cup against Real Madrid and aims for the second triumph at the &quot; Super@@ cop@@ a de Esp@@ ana . &quot;
&quot; with so far , Barcelona is the record winner of the record winner in this review . &quot;
MA Long in an own league of table tennis @-@ gold
Rio de Janeiro - The Chinese Ma Long is the new table tennis Olympic champion .
the 27 @-@ year @-@ old defeated his fellow country@@ man and &quot; defending champion &quot; Z@@ hang Ji@@ ke on Thursday in Rio de Janeiro in Rio de Janeiro .
&quot; with this the World d@@ rank @-@ list took the &quot; Golden Grand S@@ lam &quot; with successes at WM , World Cup , World @-@ Tour Fin@@ al@@ tur@@ nier and just Olympia . &quot;
bronze went to the Japanese Jun Mi@@ zut@@ ani .
the two Chinese have made it as expected in the final game and made the title one another .
&quot; it was clear that for the third time in a row , Chinese would fetch the single title in the mark of the Five R@@ ings . &quot;
last non @-@ Chinese at the top of the Olympics was the former SV@@ S @-@ N@@ Ö @-@ Leg@@ ion@@ aire Ry@@ u Se@@ ung @-@ min from South Korea .
&quot; MA and Z@@ hang were left alone on the record , between the sentences and in time outs they had no c@@ aches . &quot;
they had with@@ drawn to the grand@@ stands and left their prot@@ ectors in a fair competition alone on one another .
&quot; the matches up to here , I played for my country . &quot;
&quot; in the final I play for myself , &quot; Z@@ hang had said . &quot;
&quot; after the game , gold and silver medals were pos@@ ing with the China flag . &quot;
the match itself was un@@ expect@@ edly one @-@ sided .
MA had to fight with his 28 @-@ year @-@ old opponent only in the first sentence .
&quot; after that , he set the pace on the record and left Z@@ hang as only a total of 13 points . &quot;
&quot; due to the superi@@ ority of Ma , the expected stir@@ ring match was not developed . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , however , adequate stunning ball @-@ changes were to be seen . &quot;
Mi@@ zut@@ ani won the game for bronze against the 40 @-@ year @-@ old Vladimir Sam@@ son@@ ov 4 : 1 .
&quot; in his quar@@ ter@@ fin@@ als against the German Europ@@ am@@ ei@@ ster Dimit@@ ri@@ j Ov@@ t@@ char@@ ov , the white @-@ rus@@ se had drawn a rif@@ le injury afterwards , and after that had been in medical care , &quot; &quot; ultimately &quot; &quot; had to be content with sheet metal . &quot;
&quot; by the way , the Sweden Jan @-@ O@@ ve Wald@@ ner ( 38 / 2004 ) and Jör@@ gen Per@@ sson ( 42 / 2008 ) had become similarly high table tennis old Olympia @-@ Fourth . &quot;
Donald Tr@@ ump sp@@ elled huge problems ″ in the election campaign
&quot; the leadership of the US re@@ public@@ ans is pl@@ agu@@ ed by massive concerns , even in traditional conservative states , to lose their majority . &quot;
presidential candidate Donald Tr@@ ump is now having weaknesses of his campaign campaign in the former Repub@@ lican stron@@ gh@@ old U@@ tah .
&quot; a rare moment , in which the usually large @-@ gauge and self @-@ confident common mul@@ tim@@ il@@ lion bear something like concerns expressed , as correspon@@ dents reported . &quot;
&quot; after having thrown 16 ri@@ vals within the one &apos;s own repub@@ lican camp , there is no doubt about his success in the fight for the White House . &quot;
&quot; we have huge problems in U@@ tah , &quot; Tr@@ ump said before evangel@@ ical Christians , which he asked for support in important states such as Ohio , Florida or Virginia . &quot;
&quot; guilt is false reports of his can@@ did@@ acy , he res@@ um@@ ed his well @-@ known media . &quot;
Repub@@ lican stron@@ gh@@ olds w@@ ack@@ y
U@@ tah is usually a secure bank for the Repub@@ lic@@ ans .
&quot; according to a survey by Sur@@ vey@@ USA from June , Tr@@ ump and his bank@@ rupt@@ cy were based on the Democrats , Hill@@ ary Clinton . &quot;
&quot; other institutes see Tr@@ ump in front , but not with the distance that is common for Repub@@ lican candidates in the Federal State . &quot;
Arizona and Georgia are also regarded as endangered .
&quot; in an interview of the sen@@ ders CNB@@ C , Tr@@ ump answered the question how he wanted to stop the advance of Clin@@ tons : &quot; just as I have done so far . &quot;
&quot; and if afterwards : this will be &quot; either successful , or I will make a very nice , long vacation . &quot;
he does not make anything else as &quot; telling the truth . &quot;
&quot; if it does not reach him at the end for reasons of political correctness , that is fine , Tr@@ ump said . &quot;
then I return to a very good way of life .
&quot; according to press reports , the Tr@@ ump party should have threatened to cancel funds to support his election campaign , he should not present a better survey data . &quot;
&quot; instead of that , the candidate of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans would force the Congress to be stronger under the arms . &quot;
Olympic : thir@@ sty Sc@@ am at D@@ oping Test
the IO@@ C wants to set up a disciplinary commission .
Ken@@ yan athletes are threatened after the second dop@@ ing affair at the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro .
&quot; following a fraud attempt at a dop@@ ing control in the Olympic village , Kenya sent a trainer home . &quot;
the International Olympic Committee announced to immediately set up a disciplinary commission to investigate the case .
&quot; a Ken@@ yan official said that the former Spr@@ inter and today &apos;s coach , John An@@ z@@ rah , gave a urine sample in the Olympic village under the name of the 800 @-@ meter runner F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ ich . &quot;
this was reported by the team leader Ken@@ ias by the dop@@ ing inspec@@ tors .
&quot; the International Association of I@@ A@@ AF submitted the IO@@ C for information on the case , to make their own investigations , shared an I@@ A@@ AF spokes@@ man . &quot;
&quot; depending on the results of the investigation and the following measures taken by the IO@@ C , the I@@ A@@ AF will make an assessment , &quot; said it in an I@@ A@@ AF statement . &quot;
&quot; he ( An@@ z@@ rah ) went to the D@@ oping control station and gave himself as F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ ich , handed the sample and signed , &quot; said Kenya &apos;s chief de Mission Stephan Ara@@ p So@@ i . &quot;
he was in possession of the accredi@@ tation of the ath@@ l@@ ete who stood on the list for training checks of the World Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency .
F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ ich worked in Beijing WM fourth more than 800 meters in 2015 .
&quot; four days before , the Ken@@ yan Athle@@ tics Deleg@@ ation@@ sch@@ ef Michael Rot@@ ich was deduc@@ ted from the Rio Olympics . &quot;
he is said to have informed about pending dop@@ ing tests against cash payments from his country .
&quot; according to media reports , he was said to have been arrested at his return at the airport of Nairobi . &quot;
&quot; in Kenya , the IO@@ C has been under special observation for a long time after numerous dop@@ ing attempts . &quot;
&quot; during the announcement of the more than 2000 dop@@ ing targets presented by the IO@@ C in front of the Rio Olympics , it was previously noted that especially athletes from Kenya and Russia were taken into sight . &quot;
&quot; before the summer Games in Brazil , the world anti @-@ dop@@ ing agency had a lot of pressure on the African country to create an anti @-@ dop@@ ing law and a functioning control system . &quot;
the law was passed a few weeks before the beginning of the Olympics .
&quot; in consequence , WA@@ DA Kenya increased from the list of countries whose dop@@ ing control con@@ form with the rules of WA@@ DA . &quot;
Kenya is considered a big runner @-@ nation .
the athletes of the country won most medals at the 2015 World Cup in Beijing .
&quot; in a series of TV reports of the ARD , alleg@@ ations were repeatedly raised that dop@@ ing funds are easily accessible in Kenya and there should be a significant ment@@ ality of sports bet@@ s . &quot;
&quot; IO@@ C member Richard Po@@ und recently called for a similar investigation in Kenya , as he had hired them in Russian athle@@ tics . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , it could be proven that in this sport art was surface @-@ covered and systematic . &quot;
&quot; as a result , Russia &apos;s athletes were excluded from the summer games . &quot;
Salzburger &quot; West Side Story &quot; with Ceci@@ lia Bart@@ oli
&quot; in the Shakespeare @-@ Jahr the Salzburg Festival presents the &quot; West Side Story &quot; with Tony and Maria as a tragic couple , similar to Romeo and Juliet . &quot;
with this a surprising Ceci@@ lia Bart@@ oli .
&quot; a Musical conqu@@ ers Salzburg : the &quot; West Side Story , &quot; Le@@ orn@@ ard Bernstein &apos;s masterpiece . &quot;
the artistic director Ceci@@ lia Bart@@ oli wanted to bring the musical into the temple of classical music and filled with the role of Mary a youth night@@ mare .
&quot; in the orchestra the Sim@@ ón Bol@@ í@@ var orchestra under the direction of the Venezu@@ el@@ an conductor Gust@@ av@@ o Du@@ dam@@ el : &quot; &quot; this music is full of rhythm , &quot; &quot; he war@@ ms . &quot;
we always say that it is very Latin @-@ American .
there are many Latin American ingredients at their pace and their melody .
&quot; it is a wonderful mix , the perfect recipe for our orchestra . &quot;
I would say that we really have Bern@@ steins &apos;s music in our blood !
in this st@@ aging Bart@@ oli plays an older Maria .
&quot; she is reminis@@ cent of her love with Tony , while the younger Maria plays and dances . &quot;
the role of Mary has always fascinated me .
&quot; first , because they are musi@@ cally extraordinary ! &quot;
and then there would be Mary &apos;s personality .
&quot; she says in her song : &quot; I feel pretty , oh so pretty , I feel pretty and wit@@ ty and bright . &quot;
&quot; so she is wise , of course also na@@ ï@@ ve , and very passionate . &quot;
&quot; she resem@@ bles me very , my Italian character , whom I as a Roman , &quot; &quot; laugh@@ s Bart@@ oli . &quot;
Du@@ dam@@ el is full of praise for the opera singer : &quot; Ceci@@ lia is a wonderful artist . &quot;
it is such an honor for us to work with her .
it is an immen@@ sely generous person .
and Bart@@ oli returns the compli@@ ment : &quot; Du@@ dam@@ el is such an extraordinary artist and very passionate ! &quot;
conducting is a necessity for him .
&quot; one sees it in each of his movements , in his eyes , it is his life ! &quot;
it is such a huge opportunity to share this musical experience with him .
&quot; we both have a rather southern temp@@ er , a fire , a passion and a cheerful approach to life , that is very important at all ! &quot;
&quot; for the American director Philip W@@ m . Mc@@ Kin@@ ley is the &quot; &quot; West Side Story &quot; &quot; top@@ ical : &quot; &quot; this piece deals with prejudi@@ ce and fan@@ ati@@ cism . &quot;
&quot; today we have the refugees , then the Pu@@ ert@@ ori@@ ans went to New York and the New York residents didn &apos;t want them . &quot;
&quot; they are the same topics , and they are just as significant today as back then . &quot;
59 years later this piece is still relevant .
London school@@ girls who joined the IS were killed in Syria
&quot; K@@ adi@@ za Sult@@ ana , one of three British school girls who left London last year to join the IS , report@@ edly died in Syria . &quot;
&quot; the lawyer , Tas@@ ni@@ me Ak@@ un@@ je@@ e , said that her family passed away from her death some weeks ago from her death in Ra@@ q@@ q@@ a , Syria . &quot;
&quot; it was suspected that it was killed by a Russian air attack in Ra@@ q@@ q@@ a , the bul@@ war@@ k of the group in the country , IT@@ V News reported on Thursday . &quot;
Sult@@ ana was 17 years old and died after giving her family shortly after she had to leave the war @-@ torn country and return to England .
&quot; one can only hope that the only good is in it - as warning and warning to others that these are the risks connected with it to go into a war zone - people to stop making this decision , &quot; &quot; said Ak@@ un@@ je@@ e . &quot;
&quot; in February 2015 , Sult@@ ana and two other school girls from the East of London got into an air@@ plane towards Turkey and then into a bus to the Syrian border . &quot;
Sult@@ ana &apos;s family was told that she was married to an IS@@ IS fighter in Syria - and within a few months she became a wi@@ dow .
&quot; Rei@@ d says , in the case of an election victory at Gar@@ land , Clinton will remain as candidates for the Supreme Court &quot;
&quot; Harry Rei@@ d , leader of the democr@@ ats in the Senate , believes that the presidential candidate of the Democrats , Hill@@ ary Clinton will nom@@ inate the judge Mer@@ ri@@ ck Gar@@ land for the Supreme Court . &quot;
the Repub@@ lic@@ ans in the Senate have blocked Gar@@ land &apos;s confirmation since his nom@@ ination by Barack Obama in March .
the majority leader in Senate Mit@@ ch Mc@@ Con@@ nell is the opinion that the next president will ap@@ point the successor of the late judge at the Supreme Court of Anton@@ in Sc@@ alia .
&quot; Rei@@ d said on Thursday during a telephone conference that he was expecting from Clinton to &quot; &quot; choose Gar@@ land &quot; &quot; with a certain degree of certainty . &quot;
&quot; a spokes@@ woman of Rei@@ d later said that he was not talking to Clinton , if she would nom@@ inate Gar@@ land and he spec@@ ulate . &quot;
he praised Gar@@ land and said Clinton &apos;s team would not worry for rest@@ lessness with a new candidate .
Gar@@ land is the Supreme Court of the U.S. Court of App@@ eal for the District of Columbia .
&quot; RAID said Repub@@ lic@@ ans blocked the Gar@@ land nom@@ ination , were lack@@ eys and hel@@ pers of Repub@@ lican presidential candidate Donald Tr@@ ump . &quot;

Tre@@ ats wants N@@ eck Calendar for &quot; Women and For Men &quot;
the Tre@@ ats magazine works with the photographer David BEL@@ LE@@ MER@@ E to bring out a 1970 &apos;s Pir@@ elli @-@ inspired calendar for 2017 .
&quot; but instead of famous naked people , they want to find the next generation of top models for their N@@ U M@@ uses Calendar for 2017 . &quot;
&quot; the editor @-@ in @-@ chief of Tre@@ ats Steve Sha@@ w told us at the beginning of this year that his naked magazine of Old@@ school @-@ Play@@ boys distingu@@ ishes , since &quot; Play@@ boy was for men . &quot; &quot;
I do that for women .
apparently he believes there is the calendar too .
&quot; we have to return to the depic@@ tion of timeless and classic naked , in which both women and men feel comfortable and feel inspired by these images of a female body , &quot; said Sha@@ w in a press release for the release of Cal@@ endar@@ s . &quot;
women will want to participate in this project because it is a beautiful work of art .
models can submit their pictures online or in person at an open Cast@@ ing call in Los Angeles and New York .
Turkey : Kur@@ dish community counts with mass acc@@ urs@@ ors
&quot; who does not fit and pra@@ ises Erd@@ og@@ an , sits on packed suit@@ cases , &quot; says the chairman of the Gü@@ len @-@ proximity Foundation Di@@ alogue and World , Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un . &quot;
&quot; in short , the Kur@@ dish Community of Germany reck@@ ons with tens of thousands of prot@@ esters who flee from Turkey to Germany . &quot;
&quot; in the medium term it might even be &quot; &quot; some hundred thousand &quot; , &quot; the group president Ali Top@@ ra@@ k believes . &quot;
&quot; due to the harsh anticip@@ ation of Turkish President Rec@@ ep Tay@@ y@@ ip Erd@@ og@@ an after the coup attempt , Kur@@ dish community Germany expects a mass flight to Germany . &quot;
&quot; at short notice I reck@@ on with tens of thousands , in the medium term with several hundred thousand prot@@ esters from Turkey in Germany , if the Erd@@ og@@ an regime further comb@@ ats the minorities and the democratic opposition , &quot; says the group president Ali Top@@ ra@@ k of the &quot; World &quot; from Friday . &quot;
&quot; because the government had sur@@ passed Kur@@ dish stron@@ gh@@ olds before months with imp@@ urities , 500,000 Kur@@ ds are fle@@ eing within Turkey . &quot;
&quot; after put@@ sch , there were still secular and op@@ position@@ ist ethnic Turks . &quot;
many will want to restart in Europe if they are further supp@@ ressed in Turkey .
&quot; it cannot be that a state , which itself takes up refugees , produces refugees in their own country , &quot; said Top@@ ra@@ k . &quot;
&quot; the Order of Malta compl@@ ained the targeted settlement of Syrian Arabs in Kur@@ dish , but also in al@@ evi@@ tical cities . &quot;
&quot; with this , Erd@@ og@@ an wants to increase the export pressure to the remaining Kur@@ ds . &quot;
&quot; they are the last great minority in Turkey , the Christian Armen@@ ians and Greeks have already been eradi@@ cated or exp@@ elled in the past hundred years , &quot; &quot; said Top@@ ra@@ k , who is also a CD@@ U member . &quot;
&quot; the German government demanded that the Federal Government is &quot; &quot; as sharp as Austria against Erd@@ og@@ an and its supporters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; in Germany too , a &quot; witch hunt &quot; is taking place against Erd@@ og@@ an critics . &quot;
I don &apos;t feel safe in Germany for the first time in the last few months .
the German branch of the Gü@@ len movement also fears the flight of many Turks abroad .
&quot; more Turks will seek asylum in Germany , especially Kur@@ ds and Op@@ position@@ ists . &quot;
the br@@ anding as a Gü@@ len trailer destro@@ ys teachers and other acade@@ mics the professional existence .
&quot; who does not fit and pra@@ ises Erd@@ og@@ an , sits on packed suit@@ cases , by the way also the Kem@@ alists and sec@@ ular@@ aries , &quot; said Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un , Chairman of the Gü@@ len @-@ near Foundation Di@@ alogue and Education , the &quot; World . &quot; &quot;
&quot; as the newspaper reports on appeal to figures from the Federal Ministry of the Interior , the Turks presented the largest group of asylum seek@@ ers recognized by political persecution in Germany before the coup . &quot;
&quot; as of June 30 , this 11,@@ 386 people and therefore nearly 29 percent of all accepted as asylum seek@@ ers ( 39.@@ 625 ) . &quot;
&quot; in this survey , there is no wage for war , poverty or lack of perspective . &quot;
&quot; asylum rights according to the Basic Law are exclusively political , i.e. from state side , individually persec@@ uted . &quot;
Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : &quot; go there where it hur@@ ts &quot;
wei@@ rd Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : the locals get nothing from the summer campaign with - and the holiday@@ makers from North Rhine @-@ Westphalia must not choose the country day .
in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern they understood .
&quot; in 2021 , the country election will not be held directly at the end of the summer holidays , the Schwer@@ in Parliament has already decided at the beginning of the year . &quot;
&quot; as far as to date , it is not going on : summer holidays , heat and agricultural competition - that bit@@ es itself . &quot;
&quot; the locals , who are to be convinced by the election fighters , are on vacation . &quot;
&quot; most of the vac@@ ation@@ ers who are in the country , on the island Us@@ edom , Rügen or Hid@@ den@@ see are not locals , so may not choose the country day . &quot;
&quot; practical problems come : during the holidays , hel@@ pers , the posters hang up , bub@@ bles , distribut@@ ing fl@@ yers , distribut@@ ing fl@@ yers at the end , only pain@@ stak@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; until September 4 , 2016 , the election and last holiday day , Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern has to pass an election campaign just below the people over itself . &quot;
&quot; the hot phase , if you can say it at all , has just begun . &quot;
&quot; and it is also about something : Prime Minister Erwin Sell@@ ering , leader of an SPD / CD@@ U coalition , must fear his office . &quot;
&quot; the SPD , the strongest party since 1998 , is now clearly behind the CD@@ U in surveys . &quot;
exciting is how strong N@@ ul@@ ing Af@@ D cuts and what remains at the end of the coalition .
&quot; Sell@@ ering , 66 years old and head of government since 2008 , makes an almost in@@ con@@ spic@@ uous campaign , one sees from his major posters . &quot;
&quot; he travels across the country , distributed ro@@ ses and chat@@ ting a little with the people , just as he did his legendary word @-@ car@@ er Harald Ring@@ storff . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , sea herr@@ ing has got cold feet and Chancellor Merkel gives Merkel the blame on the b@@ los@@ som@@ ing of the Af@@ D . &quot;
&quot; your refugee policy , you &quot; We create , &quot; acceler@@ ates the rise of right @-@ wing pop@@ uli@@ sts , which will probably cost him the beautiful ministry . &quot;
&quot; the CD@@ U with its nick@@ name , the Minister of Interior , Lor@@ enz C@@ aff@@ ier , has already experienced how it is , when you make an election campaign at the right place at the wrong time . &quot;
&quot; she invited German Chancellor Angela Merkel to speak to large @-@ scale talks , and Merkel &apos;s parliamentary election is located in the northeast . &quot;
&quot; but the target group did not agree , there were more North Rhine @-@ Westphalia , Berlin and Saxony as Meckl@@ en@@ burger and Vorpommern . &quot;
&quot; there was probably the majority from other federal states , &quot; said Vincent Kok@@ ert , General Secretary of the CD@@ U in Mecklenburg @-@ Western Pom@@ er@@ ania , recently in N@@ DR . &quot;
&quot; but it &apos;s too bad to listen to anyone from other corners of Germany , once Angela Merkel . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , the Nord@@ ost CD@@ U does not abandon the usual electoral campaigns on market places and before shopping centres with umbr@@ ellas and ballo@@ ons . &quot;
&quot; that , when Kok@@ ert writes , plays only a &quot; subordin@@ ate role . &quot; &quot;
&quot; also , the Union has noticed that on the country you have to take the ground that it must be very strict to find a wire again to the people . &quot;
&quot; it is like the left , the SPD , the Gre@@ ens : hardly any present in the expan@@ ses of the country . &quot;
&quot; however , the Council of the CD@@ U election fighter Kok@@ ert to his comrades is also self @-@ expos@@ ing : &quot; you have to go there where it hur@@ ts , namely where people are : village festivals , Golden weddings , every birthday party must be used . &quot;
&quot; because much on the game stands , Sell@@ ering has called his SPD to a particularly committed election campaign . &quot;
&quot; in surveys , the Social Democrats were last with 22 percent behind partners CD@@ U ( 25 ) and just close to Af@@ D ( 19 ) . &quot;
&quot; at the election of 2011 , the SPD gained a clear view of 35.@@ 6 percent before the CD@@ U ( 22 ) . &quot;
&quot; the Gre@@ ens , small party with seven percent in the surveys , should create the leap into the land @-@ day . &quot;
they make a modern virtue out of the holiday @-@ emergency and put up their election campaign largely into the internet .
&quot; online campaign , &quot; it calls the president Claudia Müller . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , green elec@@ tor fighters embar@@ k on track search for domestic vocal pat@@ rons among the tourists . &quot;
&quot; Sil@@ ke Ga@@ je@@ k , the nick@@ name candidate , kur@@ v@@ t just with a hou@@ seb@@ o@@ at through the Mecklenburg lakes and also finds it beautiful . &quot;
&quot; their impression : &quot; &quot; freedom of choice in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern is not a punishment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
B@@ 27 @-@ Rehabilitation : Gast@@ stätten suffer from blocking
&quot; at the speed , with which the B 27 is rehab@@ ilit@@ ated , there is nothing to compl@@ ain . &quot;
&quot; for those responsible for the construction work which start at 5.@@ 30 a.m. and end only at 8@@ pm , there is praise . &quot;
&quot; they did everything pretty pretty , &quot; El@@ vi@@ ra T@@ etz@@ l@@ aff tells about the jet fuel station . &quot;
this is a super@@ team .
there is also no delay .
&quot; at the start of the week , the construction site could be moved to the south at the start of the half , until the end of October everything should be ready . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the object will also be paid to those responsible for the construction work , for example when it comes to the establishment of ma@@ kes@@ hi@@ ft trips . &quot;
&quot; since the construction site on Monday has been mig@@ rated to the south and also the blocking of the asphalt road in Of@@ ter@@ dingen has been lifted and thus also the connection to Rot@@ ten@@ burg is again , the traffic situation in the place has eased . &quot;
the citizens can now drive from Of@@ ter@@ dingen from the B 27 on both sides .
the ev@@ asive way through the place seems to go back .
&quot; there were some considerable dis@@ comfort , &quot; says the Deputy Chief Executive Officer Florian King . &quot;
&quot; the residents of Bach@@ straße , Stein@@ lach@@ straße , Haf@@ n@@ erst@@ raße and Wei@@ her@@ rain had to fight with more traffic noise , because many cre@@ eping paths were seeking and more familiar with their Nav@@ i than sign@@ age . &quot;
what led to some trucks in residential areas .
&quot; since the speed limits were not met , the municipality increased the measuring vehicle from M@@ ös@@ singen . &quot;
&quot; there were significant exc@@ esses , &quot; says King , who himself was able to find himself on the spot . &quot;
two to three per minute have been heated .
the quick@@ est was with 77 km of hour at the speed @-@ 30 zone .
&quot; since the construction site has been further moved , it has become qui@@ eter . &quot;
&quot; for business@@ men at the B 27 , it is only a small con@@ sol@@ ation that the road again is open for customers from Rot@@ ten@@ burg . &quot;
business@@ men don &apos;t like to look into the cards .
&quot; but that the B 27 refurbis@@ hment has led to sales break@@ through@@ s , everyone who is asked to look through . &quot;
&quot; however , some more and some are less affected . &quot;
&quot; who has less to do with the &quot; end customer , &quot; so for other companies , the rehabilitation has hardly any consequences . &quot;
&quot; even at the Aut@@ oh@@ aus Mai@@ er , Thomas Sul@@ z speaks of a &quot; &quot; most light decline &quot; , &quot; but also suggests that &quot; &quot; the running documents are missing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the most heavily traff@@ ick@@ ed are the local along the road .
&quot; J. Albert G@@ öh@@ ner , owner of the Ste@@ ak@@ house , formerly crown , finds clear words . &quot;
this is already exist@@ ential .
&quot; not only him , but all the restaurants have hit it &quot; hard . &quot; &quot;
&quot; customers from H@@ ech@@ ingen , Bal@@ ingen and Rot@@ t@@ weil were missing . &quot;
we must be happy about every euro turnover .
&quot; in excess of 50 percent , the sales revenue figures &quot; &quot; far above 50 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; road@@ marking has thrown its plant &quot; &quot; by two years . &quot;
half of his staff have to be dismis@@ sed .
&quot; if I had a company with 4,000 employees and half would have been dismis@@ sed , politics would have re@@ acted differently . &quot;
&quot; instead , government President Jörg Schmidt on a request from G@@ öh@@ ner , if there could be a financial compensation , would otherwise benefit from the advantages of the situation on the B 27 . now , they also have the dis@@ advantages resulting from the refurbis@@ hment . &quot;
&quot; G@@ Ö@@ H@@ NER knows from other districts , where a little more generous was handled . &quot;
&quot; with all col@@ l@@ ages , G@@ öh@@ ner is confident that his restaurant will continue to exist . &quot;
&quot; after all , the family business has been located here since 17@@ 15 , he points to the long history . &quot;
&quot; that other regul@@ ars are now seeing less frequently due to complicated traffic guidance , he can understand . &quot;
&quot; if one cannot drive , it is also very nice elsewhere . &quot;
&quot; that its stem cell is coming back after the end of the renovation work , G@@ öh@@ ner has no doubts . &quot;
&quot; despite the crises with B@@ SE and avian influ@@ enza , G@@ öh@@ ner holds the effects of the B 27 construction work on his client@@ ele for the greatest crisis that has experienced his restaurant in its long @-@ standing history . &quot;
&quot; six months of construction work , this is already brutal . &quot;
all the time in the name of the counter @-@ counter is to be screw@@ ed on to laws .
&quot; according to recent proposals , Interior Minister de Mai@@ zi@@ ère is now propos@@ ing a large security package . &quot;
but what has a debt status to do with terror ?
and what does the coalition partner say to all that ?
Thomas de Mai@@ zi@@ ère gives the owner .
&quot; all his proposals are politically acceptable to the coalition partner , &quot; says the Federal Minister of the Interior in the presentation of his new security package . &quot;
they overwhel@@ m no one .
&quot; other , further points would initially be discussed within the parties . &quot;
&quot; also , I took part in it . &quot;
&quot; however , as Minister of Interior , he was placed on results and at a &quot; achiev@@ able consensus &quot; within the coalition . &quot;
&quot; according to recent attacks in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach , de Mai@@ zi@@ ère has a little time to do so before it presents its conclusions for security in the Republic . &quot;
but these are all the more extensive .
&quot; some have already announced , announced , announced that a new security authority is to take care of the child encrypted communication , is not new . &quot;
&quot; also , it is not the fact that Germany must implement several EU guidelines on passenger information and weapons law . &quot;
the call for more video surveillance and personnel for security authorities is also not surprising .
&quot; in part , de Mai@@ zi@@ ère is launching a second outing for proposals that have not yet been done with the SPD : he wants to put media advertising for terrorist groups under penalty and kno@@ ck ji@@ hadi@@ sts with double citizenship to the German passport . &quot;
&quot; these will be difficult points for the SPD , &quot; says the CD@@ U man . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , he considers this to be reasonable and not demanding anything , which has no chances in the coalition partner anyway . &quot;
a few new ideas are presented at Mai@@ zi@@ ère too .
they have partly in themselves : he is planning rapid processes for deport@@ ations and more possibilities for incar@@ cer@@ ation of people before deport@@ ation .
&quot; ISO @-@ 8859 @-@ 9 ( Turkish ) iso @-@ 8859 @-@ 10 ( Latin 10 ) us @-@ as@@ ci@@ i ( basic English ) eu@@ c @-@ jp ( Japanese , Unix ) &quot;
&quot; in case of ex@@ ul@@ sions for rejected asylum seek@@ ers , he wants to make some even worse than hi@@ ther@@ to - such who commit crimes or deliberately throw away their papers to disgu@@ ise their identity . &quot;
some of these are political and legal .
some also still works un@@ balanced and leaves questions open .
&quot; and with some points - in the un@@ equal treatment of pati@@ ently for example , the question arises : what actually does this have to do with security and terror ? &quot;
&quot; yes , says de Mai@@ zi@@ ère , it is important to differenti@@ ate between the subjects of refugees and terror . &quot;
but it cannot be said that the attacks from Ans@@ bach and Wu@@ erz@@ burg were refugees .
&quot; in addition , many people worried about security in the face of the high refugee figures . &quot;
&quot; and things that people were deeply occupied , could not compl@@ ain about in election times . &quot;
the inner security is enor@@ mously moved into the focus .
&quot; the sur@@ charges in the neighborhood : Paris , Copenhagen , Brussels , Nice . &quot;
then the attacks in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach .
the uncertainty is great .
&quot; and yes , there are electoral struggles . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , the Union and the SPD are therefore increasingly taking into position on the subject of internal security . &quot;
&quot; in the past few days , it was up between the two parties . &quot;
&quot; only a conc@@ lusive argument about the equipment of the Federal Police , then via a security policy collection of some Uni@@ ons interior ministers , in which the R@@ ess@@ ort@@ chiefs also demand a bur@@ ka ban and a revers@@ al from double citizenship . &quot;
de Mai@@ zi@@ ère is also struggling for con@@ cili@@ atory notes .
&quot; from a revers@@ al of the double pass , he considers nothing . &quot;
we have fixed the discussion in Germany .
&quot; if you want to re @-@ release it , it is not advisable . &quot;
&quot; and in case of a bur@@ ka ban , he made constitutional concerns . &quot;
&quot; whether its own package is un@@ constitutional at all corners and whether it is &quot; &quot; reasonable &quot; &quot; for the coalition partner , it must first show itself . &quot;
there &apos;s a lot of things in it that could cause stri@@ fe .
&quot; however , the SPD is also trying to conc@@ eal itself on the subject of inner security . &quot;
&quot; chief of the party , Sig@@ mar Gabriel , carefully sign@@ alizes talks and says : &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything that contributes to further increase security . &quot;
Volkswagen is still coming off lightly .
&quot; despite diesel engines , the delivery numbers are rising worldwide . &quot;
but not in all markets it runs round .
&quot; in the case of recall action , there are vor@@ tices around one term . &quot;
Volkswagen will start deliveries in the second half of the year for deliveries .
&quot; in spite of the many brands and some well @-@ running markets , Europe &apos;s largest car auer will continue to demonstrate a plus thanks to its many brands and some well @-@ running markets . &quot;
&quot; but in July , VW , particularly in Western Europe , weak@@ ened the total sales , as the company reported in the D@@ ax . &quot;
&quot; worldwide , the VW brand sold in July with 4@@ 49@@ 100 cars 1.8 percent less vehicles than in the previous year . &quot;
&quot; in Western Europe alone , after China the second most important market , sales were 14 percent below the previous year &apos;s month . &quot;
in the hom@@ etown of Germany the deliveries declined by almost a sixth .

&quot; in addition , there have been a purchase post@@ ure in some core markets through &quot; changed economic conditions . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in addition to the situation around the coup attempt in Turkey , the British vote for the withdrawal from the EU , explained a spokes@@ woman . &quot;
&quot; in the US , where the exhaust gas is escal@@ ated first , there is also a minus to be@@ ech . &quot;
large support for VW is the Chinese market .
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; from January to July , Group sales manager Fred Kap@@ pler was able to show a sales chart . &quot;
&quot; 1.3 percent more vehicles delivered Volkswagen at this time , around 904 million worldwide . &quot;
Volkswagen had been manipul@@ ated with a software det@@ ecting test .
&quot; in Germany alone , VW is calling for some 2.5 million cars to upgrade to the workshops . &quot;
&quot; in the course of retro@@ fitting , Volkswagen reiter@@ ated that the conversion of cars has no negative impact . &quot;
&quot; after retro@@ fitting the vehicles , there is no deteri@@ oration in fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or engine performance . &quot;
&quot; after conversion , the autom@@ aker put a &quot; guarantee &quot; certificate after the conversion , but does not speak of a &quot; guarantee , &quot; as it was supposed to be on Friday in company circles . &quot;
reason is legal sensi@@ tivities .
&quot; the &quot; Focus &quot; had reported , Volkswagen acc@@ uses its German customers now a guarantee of upgraded diesel models . &quot;
this would have been confirmed by the last Monday VW representatives in the Federal Ministry of Transport .
&quot; from the Ministry of Transport , it was confirmed that there was this meeting . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; VW has to fulfil the requirements of my inquiry commission and the KBA fully . &quot;
&quot; devi@@ ations from these are not accepted , &quot; stated Minister of Transport Alexander Do@@ brin@@ dt ( CS@@ U ) according to the ministry . &quot;
&quot; VW has taken over the guarantee that fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or engine performance after the conversion will not take place and all typical vehicle values have remained unchanged . &quot;
&quot; Volkswagen itself does not use the term &quot; &quot; guarantee &quot; &quot; but not as it was in corporate travel . &quot;
&quot; the wide term &quot; &quot; guarantee &quot; &quot; gives Volkswagen the possibility that for example , for example , half a year after the conversion , customers can come into a workshop - and this can lead to the new software even if the damage has nothing to do with it . &quot;
&quot; even in the customer interest , it is important to avoid that there are any other damage that has nothing to do with the ab@@ sc@@ andal , to avoid confusion regarding possible warranty regulations , as it was . &quot;
&quot; therefore , VW does not use the term &quot; warranty . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the Rai@@ ff@@ eisen@@ bank G@@ mund on T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see demands from rich austerity in the future , as a second institute in Germany . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , Ban@@ ker Josef Paul said : &quot; it &apos;s just about 139 customers who park 40 million euros on Gi@@ ro@@ - or daily accounts . &quot;
&quot; the Federal Association of German banks speaks of an individual case and does not see any signal in it : &quot; &quot; normal Spar@@ es &quot; &quot; should not be afraid to pay for their spar@@ se pen@@ alties . &quot;
&quot; if banks store money overnight at the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , they must pay its 0.4 percent pen@@ al interest . &quot;
&quot; this fee demands the Rai@@ ff@@ eisen@@ bank G@@ mund from September of private and corporate clients for deposits over 100,000 euros on Gi@@ ro@@ - or daily accounts . &quot;
&quot; the first 100,000 euros are free . &quot;
&quot; the next 100,000 cost will cost 400 Euro per year in the future , &quot; said Paul . &quot;
&quot; for a long time , he has covered 40 million euros , which could be with@@ drawn from one day to the other and which he could not utilize . &quot;
&quot; they lie with me on the central bank account and cause a 0.4 percent cost , &quot; said the principal . &quot;
I cannot lay down for every million 4000 Euros .
the costs he now pass on after the poll@@ uter pays principle .
&quot; letting the cash flow easily in the ra@@ ids of the Rai@@ ff@@ eisen@@ bank would be far too dangerous : &quot; I &apos;ve already experienced four attacks , I don &apos;t like the fifth ! &quot; &quot; said the bank@@ note . &quot;
most customers would have had understanding and rarely changed to other investment forms .
only a few emig@@ rated to other banks .
&quot; the co @-@ operative association of Bavaria declared : &quot; &quot; the ECB &apos;s extreme monetary policy causes considerable costs in all banks . &quot;
&quot; to bear it alone , &quot; business @-@ economically is not possible . &quot; &quot;
&quot; some German banks therefore have increased their fees for account management , credit cards or transfers . &quot;
&quot; with penalty for deposits of three million euros , the Thuring@@ ian Volks@@ - und Rai@@ ff@@ eisen@@ bank Alten@@ burger Land had head@@ lines with their Sk@@ at@@ bank branch in 2014 . &quot;
&quot; Michael Kem@@ mer , Chief Executive Director of the Banking Union , said : &quot; we do not expect private customers to pay full coverage for deposits , so the competition in Germany is much too strong among banks and savings banks . &quot;
&quot; a ban@@ ker said , at the T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see there is &quot; a cliff , which is more luxuri@@ ant from the property . &quot;
&quot; this can become a problem for a small bank , if they boun@@ ce money free of charge . &quot;
&quot; founded in 1911 , G@@ mund has branches in Bad Wies@@ see , Rot@@ t@@ ach @-@ E@@ gern , Kre@@ uth and T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see . &quot;
&quot; well known actors , sport@@ s@@ men and entrepreneurs are living in the region . &quot;
&quot; currently no other banks are known to the co @-@ operative association of Bavaria , which calcul@@ ates compensation for deposits of private customers , &quot; said spokes@@ person Ernst . &quot;
&quot; the President of the Federal Association of German Volks@@ banks and Rai@@ ff@@ eisen@@ banks ( B@@ VR ) , Uwe Fr@@ öh@@ lich , declared : &quot; the threshold to go to neg@@ atives is very , very high . &quot;
&quot; competition is tough , and it threat@@ ens the migration of investors to competition . &quot;
the customers in Germany will not be able to enjoy this in the width .
destination plates : who bu@@ ys record records ?
lonely men middle aged love plates .
&quot; before you hur@@ ry to comment part to over@@ see him under the pseu@@ don@@ ym non@@ Alle@@ en@@ sam@@ en@@ Male middle @-@ aged men with rough ins@@ ults , this statement is derived from current data . &quot;
&quot; according to You@@ Go@@ v , the multic@@ ol@@ ored re@@ birth of vinyl records is not due to a boom in mill@@ enni@@ als that want to welcome the news of physical objects , but also due to mid@@ life nostal@@ gia . &quot;
those who recently bought a record are all for@@ esi@@ ght at the age of 45 and 54 .
&quot; in fact , the age group of 18 @-@ 24 is the most unlikely buyer group . &quot;
it is also not a hor@@ des by amateur collectors - it has an emotional meaning : older record buyers retain their feelings more for themselves ( 56 % vs. 53 % ) and enjoy it alone time ( 69 % vs. 66 % ) .
forecasts to 2019 illustrate how the market is set to change .
&quot; if this blog would be a news report on TV , the camera would follow me while I run in the middle of a busy street in Soh@@ o , a modest gray suit and wil@@ dly ham@@ mer@@ ed before I stop , hold my hands and say something more determin@@ edly : &quot; &quot; so , let &apos;s take a closer look at it . &quot;
so let &apos;s take a look at it .
&quot; even if the heart of Soh@@ o is slow in its charm - hotels , restaurants and offices are now filling the buildings where independent sellers were based - there is still a handful of fantastic record specialty shops . &quot;
I would probably ask the cam@@ er@@ aman to switch the camera for the next part in which I stand in close proximity to different men in such stores and try to assess their age and mind by observation .
&quot; Stu@@ art from Glasgow , 55 , the I of Si@@ ster Ray ( number of data : two young women , three men of middle @-@ aged ) into Rec@@ kl@@ ess Records ( number of numbers : eight men of middle @-@ aged , a woman , presum@@ ably around the 20 ) , is one day long because of a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the few hours . &quot;
&quot; is he a collector , I ask ? &quot;
&quot; I guess , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; I have about 3,000 or 4,000 sheets . &quot;
&quot; these records , pic@@ tured above ( he sent me the snap@@ shot by e @-@ mail , I didn &apos;t follow him at home ) , dress the walls of his living room . &quot;
&quot; the reason why he has such a considerable number of albums and singles is the result of his available income : he is now able to buy plates that he couldn &apos;t afford , when she appeared and bought objects he sold , when he was young and wide . &quot;
&quot; many things I buy are from the late 60s , early 70s , which appeared when I was 11 or 12 . things that I was probably too young to buy it , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; he agre@@ es that those who buy plates are more intro@@ ver@@ ted and like to spend time alone , adding : &quot; I don &apos;t smoke and I don &apos;t drink a lot . &quot;
this is my vice .
&quot; WE@@ Z , 25 , who works at Si@@ ster Ray , also believes that many customers whom he meets can apply to the You@@ Go@@ v profile . &quot;
&quot; but he also noticed a new wave of people who are influenced by the media , people who have heard about the com@@ eback and set themselves to buy their old records . &quot;
&quot; from the conversations that I have led , people usually have got rid of their collection in 1998 or 1999 . &quot;
&quot; customers who once sold their records to buy CDs , sell their CDs now to buy their records , &quot; he says . &quot;
this would explain the boom to tra@@ ilers of the plate revi@@ vals of a particular age .
but what about the alleged emotional significance of plates ?
&quot; it takes just a few seconds in a shop like Ph@@ onica , to recognize that record stores offer a so@@ othing community of like @-@ minded people . &quot;
&quot; according to We@@ z , some of the older customers participated in the cont@@ act@@ less payment system . &quot;
&quot; some record fans feel overwhel@@ med by the digital world and would like to draw back to the stability of familiar sound sleeves , from objects that call blis@@ s@@ ful adjustments . &quot;
&quot; I think sometimes it can be the filling of a void or possession of material pos@@ sessions as a kind of comfort , &quot; &quot; says We@@ z . &quot;
that &apos;s with me as a collector so and I think it is so with many people .
it is a simple way to deal mentally .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we are like their social workers ! &quot; &quot; an employee of a stack pile . &quot;
&quot; a survey by IC@@ M in April revealed that almost 50 % of the people who bought a record last month , they haven &apos;t listened to . &quot;
&quot; the survey also found out that 41 % have a record player they never use , while 7 % of those who buy a record , don &apos;t have a record player . &quot;
&quot; at this time of news report , I would probably look very anxi@@ ous , while I was pu@@ zz@@ led by a pile of bos@@ sa Nova comp@@ il@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; J@@ onn@@ y , 42 , who works at Sounds of the Universe ( number of numbers : three middle @-@ aged men ) , has noticed a &quot; &quot; tro@@ phy aspect &quot; &quot; of the revival . &quot;
&quot; someone came only recently here and said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t have a turn@@ table but I would like to buy a radi@@ oh@@ ead sound plate so that I can put them into the shelf , &quot; &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; this is not a big percentage , but it definitely happens . &quot;
&quot; more produ@@ kt@@ able , less musical . &quot;
&quot; we have people who say , &quot; I don &apos;t have a record player . &quot; &quot;
&quot; these are younger people , not older ones who come slowly . &quot;
&quot; F@@ opp , which has devoted almost a whole floor to the records , has a b@@ lower audience than I enter . &quot;
&quot; there are couples around the 70 , tourists who make photos , te@@ ens and women middle aged . &quot;
even if the atmosphere is somewhat less relaxed than in the above @-@ mentioned shops - Wild Be@@ asts Neo synthes@@ izer and sex@@ be@@ packed pop in place of experimental jazz p@@ am@@ pers from the speakers - it &apos;s good to see such diversity among customers .
&quot; no one of them looks strange , but nag@@ ging mental trau@@ ma is hard to determine if you stand next to someone for 30 seconds . &quot;
&quot; E@@ lan@@ ora , 27 , has been running around the business for a few minutes and looks at the variety of boards for sale . &quot;
she is more likely to buy a man@@ ne@@ quin than a big purchase .
&quot; it does not deserve much , therefore collecting plates is not a real option , she says . &quot;
it costs a lot .
&quot; it is easy to listen to music from a computer or in a different way , but the beauty of records is ... &quot; she drives away with a de@@ ar@@ est si@@ gh . &quot;
I don &apos;t know how to explain it - it is truly unique .
my last stop is a shop which is said to have inspired a new generation of record lovers : urban Out@@ fit@@ ters .
&quot; while I give the voucher to mu@@ ck the jeans hotel pants , I observe a group of young teen@@ age girls who are group@@ ing for a moment around Polar@@ oid cameras , before a father and his daughter are thinking about buying a Cros@@ ley turn@@ table . &quot;
&quot; on the left is a staircase , a wall full of panels of Adel@@ e , Jeff Buck@@ ley , Amy Win@@ ehouse and Fle@@ et@@ wood Mac : a mixture of contemporary music and classics , the essential plates for an average collection . &quot;
&quot; no one sees them - perhaps because they are purely decorative , some so far above that it is impossible to touch them . &quot;
it is pure &quot; record art . &quot;
&quot; but considering that any attraction for these items would mean more money for the industry and could send some customers to the depths of Soh@@ o for more , there is nothing to compl@@ ain . &quot;
&quot; it is no surprise that a population group that has more time and money than others , is also the one that is most common for luxury items such as plates . &quot;
&quot; even though my research shows that the results of You@@ Go@@ v agree , they leave , at least in record stores in Soh@@ o , the large number of female collectors and record lovers that exist in reality , record stores and online forums . &quot;
these people probably work hard at school or in offices .
&quot; they spend their Thursday morning with security not with the bum@@ ble@@ bee through record stores of Ber@@ wick Street and the leaves by plates , while they steer clear of an un@@ c@@ anny , 30 @-@ year @-@ old false moder@@ ator , who out@@ stands anything of middle @-@ aged men over the shoulders . &quot;
the Greenland shar@@ k is the longest living cycl@@ one - video
scientific say that Greenland has the longest life span of all vert@@ eb@@ rates on the planet .
&quot; Julius Niel@@ sen , who investig@@ ates shar@@ ks , says that the record was with a female from which it is assumed that it is between 272 and 512 years old and five meters long . &quot;
French court bor@@ row@@ ed offer on demo@@ li@@ tion of shops in the jungle refugee camp
&quot; a French court rejected an offer by the authorities in Cal@@ ais , dozens of temporary shops and restaurants in the jungle of Cal@@ ais where thousands of refugees live . &quot;
&quot; during a trial of this week , the authorities in Cal@@ ais argued that the state should be authorised to sell 72 temporary stores in which individuals sell or sell tea for 50 c@@ ents ( 40 p@@ ence ) or simple meals for a few euros in temporary restaurants . &quot;
Cal@@ ais pre@@ f@@ ecture ar@@ gues that these places should be torn down because they would represent a parallel economy from which no taxes would be paid and which lodge a fire and san@@ ity risk .
&quot; humanitarian groups shared the court that the shops and restaurants are important , as the free meals offered by the state @-@ supported union and other groups will not provide enough food for the growing numbers in the camp . &quot;
they also led to the provis@@ ional shops and restaurants often provide accommodation and free meals for people in need .
&quot; a court in L@@ ille decided that there would be no legal basis for the deport@@ ation of people who run the 72 provis@@ ional businesses , but admitted that the concerns of the pre@@ f@@ ecture of Cal@@ ais were absolutely tra@@ ce@@ able . &quot;
&quot; the judge Jean @-@ François M@@ olla said that food stores , cafés and restaurants would play a much larger role than merely to feed people living in extremely prec@@ ari@@ ous conditions . &quot;
he said that the areas offer calm meetings between refugees and volunteers .
&quot; one of the places threatened by the ra@@ inf@@ all was the Jung@@ le Book Kids &apos; Café of the camp , which is char@@ itable and 200 meals a day , English and French classes , as well as advice on asylum cases for hundreds of vulnerable , un@@ accompanied min@@ ors in the camp . &quot;
more than 170@@ .000 people signed the petition to preserve the Kids &apos; Café .
&quot; in a letter to the Guardian , it was meant that &quot; closure &quot; would be a disaster for these children , of which the youngest is eight years old . &quot;
&quot; the two relief organisations Help Refu@@ ge@@ es and L &apos;@@ Au@@ berge des Mig@@ rants estimated on Friday that the number of people in the jungle camp had risen to more than 9,@@ 000 people - the highest number until now - after a steep increase in newcom@@ ers over the summer . &quot;
despite Olympics dis@@ appointment : Martin remains fighting
&quot; despite his dis@@ ap@@ pointing performance at the Olympic time , Rad@@ prof@@ i Tony Martin doesn &apos;t want to get involved . &quot;
&quot; I continue the World Cup at a glance , remain confident and fight further , &quot; wrote the 31 @-@ year @-@ old on Thursday before his departure from Rio de Janeiro on Facebook . &quot;
he did not have an explanation for his mis@@ erable twel@@ fth place on the sugar guard .
&quot; to me it is hon@@ estly difficult to comment on the passing of yesterday , &quot; said Martin . &quot;
&quot; he must rest in peace , which causes the deb@@ acle to have led . &quot;
&quot; at the F@@ WC in October in Qatar , Martin wanted to fight for the title . &quot;
I will look at everything exactly what we have changed in recent times .

group climb@@ s up at start @-@ up for live video broad@@ casts
&quot; looking at other people when playing video games , is a huge issue - it also wants to benefit from Microsoft too . &quot;
&quot; the technology group purchases the start @-@ up Be@@ am , which speci@@ alizes in this hobby . &quot;
&quot; as much money for the acquisition , Microsoft did not share with it on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; Be@@ am went to the start with his offer only in January and already has more than 100,000 users . &quot;
&quot; you can watch others while playing , but also interv@@ ene . &quot;
&quot; for example , they can give up missions and provide enemies and provide equipment . &quot;
the Activ@@ ision Bli@@ zz@@ ard will launch a new HD video service for the bo@@ oming world of e @-@ sports .
&quot; on the way to the global media event , Facebook is supposed to help . &quot;
the advertising industry is already listening .
&quot; the employees of the start @-@ up , which has its headquarters in Seattle , in the U.S. state of Washington , moved to the Microsoft Head@@ quarters in the California Red@@ mond , as Be@@ am co @-@ founder and CEO Matt Sal@@ sam@@ end@@ i announced . &quot;
&quot; for the customers , therefore , nothing is expected to change . &quot;
&quot; according to Microsoft , Be@@ am is integrated in the video games department around the Xbox console . &quot;
the market for streaming video games is growing rapidly .
known platforms are t@@ witch and YouTube gaming .
T@@ witch was purchased from the online retail@@ er Amazon in 2014 - for almost a billion dollars .

here comes the En@@ forcement Trailer
&quot; Germany &apos;s Ras@@ er must adapt to the next generation of speed meas@@ urer : in different federal states , among others in H@@ esse and Brandenburg , new flas@@ hes are tested , the temp@@ os@@ itors are to be executed very effectively . &quot;
&quot; the fut@@ uris@@ tically acting En@@ forcement Trailer of the company Vit@@ ronic from Wiesbaden can be used for example at accident rates , where it would be dangerous for a mobile measurement by the police . &quot;
&quot; for example , on motorway construction sites or to renov@@ ating bridges with a temporary pace , there is often no necessary infrastructure to ensure that the speed limit is observ@@ able . &quot;
a permanent mobile construction can be too dangerous or costly .
&quot; the En@@ forcement trailer is self @-@ sufficient : its battery lasts five days with un@@ interrupted measurement mode , the case data is transmitted encrypted via a modem . &quot;
&quot; with laser measurement technology , all vehicles can also be detected at the same time over several tracks . &quot;
&quot; variable speed limits as well as drive @-@ through b@@ ans by time , travel strips and vehicle class can also be monitored . &quot;
&quot; in the state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ art state , one can move the trailer according to manufacturer with each car with trailer coupling . &quot;
&quot; so that it is not easy to cl@@ ot@@ ch , it is lowered in the measurement mode so that the wheels in the arm@@ oured and inci@@ dentally also slip out the outer shell . &quot;
&quot; in addition , a built @-@ in alarm system should protect the bl@@ itz from v@@ and@@ alism . &quot;
&quot; since 2015 , the trailer has been tested by Vit@@ ronic in various federal states and is now also used . &quot;
&quot; foreign authorities also flas@@ hed with the new technology : recently France has ordered 100 units , after an order of 150 pieces last year . &quot;
Britain pic@@ ks silver in 7 @-@ year rug@@ by after Fi@@ ji Master@@ class Gold recovered
&quot; in the final on Thursday evening , the impressive performance of Great Britain &apos;s 7 @-@ day rug@@ by came to an ab@@ rupt stop at the last hur@@ dle in the form of Fi@@ j@@ is , when they were hit here in Rio with a result of 43 @-@ 7 in the De@@ od@@ oro Stadium . &quot;
&quot; Fi@@ ji divided a Master Class in the Handling , Side @-@ Step@@ ping , Night@@ mare , Line run and ro@@ her strength to win gold - her first Olympic medal of any color . &quot;
&quot; the defeat was swe@@ pt through the not too bad tro@@ phy of the silver medal - Britain &apos;s fourth on that day - and they could be proud of their efforts in this tournament , in which they hit New Zealand , Argentina and South Africa . &quot;
&quot; the massive defeat of the Bo@@ ks , 7 @-@ 5 in the semi @-@ fin@@ als on the same day could fall back on them in the final . &quot;
&quot; however , regardless of that Fi@@ ji would have beaten a 15 @-@ man @-@ team in the form of this form . &quot;
&quot; it could be a con@@ sol@@ ation for GB - but it probably won &apos;t - that at least one Br@@ ite tomorrow will have a gold medal for his neck : Fi@@ j@@ is boss trainer Ben Ryan , the former head for England from Wim@@ ble@@ don . &quot;
GB had a difficult path behind him .
&quot; eight years ago , she lost every game at the Adel@@ ai@@ de Sev@@ ens . &quot;
here they lost only one .
&quot; this fla@@ p will hurt , but progress is amazing . &quot;
Fi@@ ji began wondering and allowed the attacks to boun@@ ce out of fun .
&quot; it felt for the captain Tom Mit@@ ch@@ ell an and Co . , as if one would run into driving buses . the World Series winners went up 5 @-@ 0 upwards , when O@@ sea Kol@@ in@@ is@@ au was bri@@ ghtened up in the corner . &quot;
&quot; with four minutes of playing time , Jer@@ ry Tu@@ wa@@ i added another attack from the right corner , which he changed . &quot;
12 @-@ 0 and GB hardly touched the ball .
&quot; a vice @-@ president of Mit@@ ch@@ ell hal@@ ted the mountain of Man Leone Nak@@ ar@@ awa to achieve a third goal , but it has only stopped Fi@@ ji . &quot;
in the seventh minute j@@ asa Ver@@ em@@ al@@ ua left a touch down in the right corner and it stood 0 @-@ 17 for GB .
Nak@@ ar@@ awa added a new one since the restart and there were always over a minute of playing time ... in the first half .
V@@ atem@@ o Rav@@ ou@@ vo@@ u pres@@ ided by further weak Tac@@ kl@@ ings of the GB team and stor@@ med up to the line to make a gate .
the transformation brought a 29 @-@ 0 to a break .
&quot; it is as if Fi@@ ji was born to play the 7 , while GB still se@@ eded . &quot;
this is how it is .
&quot; GB conducted basic changes in the half @-@ time and closed the fi@@ ji@@ an gap ... for whole four minutes , which was good for the conditions of the first half @-@ time , until Joshua Tu@@ is@@ ova ran through a brilliant inter@@ play of Fi@@ ji . &quot;
&quot; Dan N@@ orton started an attempt for GB , made a touch down in the left corner for a 36 @-@ 7 , but the game already ran for a long time in favor of the South African sul@@ ans , whose fans sang , flags and d@@ anced on the grand@@ stand . &quot;
it was not difficult to admire the playful approach of Fi@@ j@@ is .
Mat@@ a Vi@@ li@@ ame set the icing on the cake with another attempt in the last seconds .
&quot; the fi@@ ff rang , the Fi@@ j@@ is emb@@ raced himself and GB kick@@ ed off in the grass . &quot;
&quot; earlier on the day Fi@@ ji Japan defeated Japan in the semi @-@ fin@@ als with 20 @-@ 5 , and Great Britain pushed South Africa in a tight semi @-@ fin@@ als match from the race - Great Britain &apos;s transformation of the difference . &quot;
&quot; K@@ yle Brown brought the boats in the first half to the front , but Dan N@@ orton interrupted the line with an impressive foot@@ work and scored a gate among the posts in the second half . &quot;
&quot; a brilliant late Tac@@ kling by Marcus Wat@@ son , the brother of Anthony of the British 15 @-@ A@@ side Team , secured the win - and thus the silver medal . &quot;
Helen Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning inspired by the fight with the trainer &apos;s cancer to a ru@@ dder win
there will be no more emotional gold than with these games and that wants to be hot .
&quot; from the first ru@@ dder to the last , 220 hard h@@ ieve that entered into history , Helen Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning found an extra meaning in their golden moment at the Est@@ acio da Lag@@ oa . &quot;
&quot; even though there were only those who sat on the helm , there were three voices in the boat . the echo of the trainer Robin Williams , was omni@@ present when she was the second Olympi@@ ad in the second without a tax woman , the first women in the history of British sports who put such a benchmark . &quot;
&quot; her domin@@ ance was absolutely , after all , her 39.@@ her un@@ defeated bet , which is also un@@ parall@@ eled . &quot;
&quot; what we see are two brilliant athletes , who slide over the surface with the elegance of sw@@ ans , which does not reflect the type of triumph@@ al damage . &quot;
&quot; behind every gold in the rowing there is a batt@@ ali@@ on of wild hel@@ pers who make up the incre@@ mental progress that makes the difference and it was no one , worse than the coach who didn &apos;t know that day before he was diagnosed with cancer . &quot;
&quot; as he said , he was ris@@ ky . &quot;
&quot; I had bladder cancer , which is oper@@ able and that did it . &quot;
&quot; if you do not do that , it spreads everywhere . &quot;
it would have been a rather bad situation .
it changes a little the outlook .
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013 .
&quot; the trio had luck that he could start treatment at the beginning of 2014 , out of season , which kept the inter@@ ruption to a minimum , if under such circumstances the right term is at all . &quot;
&quot; I needed money , so I had to go better again soon . &quot;
it was an incentive .
&quot; I was in the hospital and ran around on the station - 20 feet , 30 feet , 50 feet at a time when they said that some steps would suff@@ ice . &quot;
this is how it begins .
&quot; the rowing itself is already a challenge , but that makes it an even bigger one . &quot;
&quot; in the immedi@@ acy of victory , her first thoughts went to Williams , who spent a more anno@@ ying morning with a little more than usual , trying to process his own fears . &quot;
&quot; St@@ anning , who was the cent@@ ur@@ ion in the Royal Arti@@ llery Reg@@ iment in a deployment in Afghanistan , said &quot; &quot; I was an emotional w@@ reck this week . it might be a bit extreme , but it means so much . &quot;
&quot; it repe@@ ats only how much I and Helen , and also Robin , have worked . &quot;
there were three fantastic years with Helen and Robin .
&quot; without Robin we would be no one , so a massive thank you to him . he is the best trainer of the world . &quot;
I couldn &apos;t have wished for better training or a better trainer .
Helena Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning have not lost a race in the last five years .
the couple had a hard rhythm with which their opponents could not keep up with .
&quot; even in the last 500 meters , when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark started to start , St@@ anning and Glo@@ ver had too much in reserve . &quot;
we were caught very at the moment .
&quot; Helen called &quot; &quot; stay in the process , stay in the process . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is really important to not let yourself be carried away .
we had a good start and at the same time we weren &apos;t expecting to do something great .
&quot; today we didn &apos;t want a fire@@ work , we just wanted to achieve a good result , go out and win the race what we did . &quot;
the couple will take a break for one year before making decisions about his future .
&quot; Glo@@ ver must appear next week on a wedding , your own with the TV adventure Steve Back@@ shall . &quot;
now she just wants to enjoy the moment .
I didn &apos;t want to say that it was my last race .
that would have meant too much pressure .
&quot; in London , it took about six months to understand that I am an Olympic champion . &quot;
it was all that new for me and I was so stressed .
it took about four minutes .
&quot; that feels so much better , &quot; she said . &quot;
for 31 years exemplary for clarity
&quot; the managing director of the water @-@ purpose association &quot; V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein@@ gruppe , &quot; Rup@@ pert G@@ öller , retired . &quot;
&quot; the association is regarded as &quot; &quot; Bavarian @-@ wide exemplary . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a small French drinking water @-@ purpose association as a model for the large water producers .
this was the name of the Bay@@ er@@ ischer Rundfunk after some time in the original sound .
&quot; little later , the water forum of the government of Unter@@ fran@@ ken appl@@ au@@ ded the association . &quot;
&quot; the work of the V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein Group was &quot; &quot; Bavarian @-@ wide &quot; &quot; as exemplary . &quot;
&quot; behind all this Ru@@ pert G@@ öller , who was a member of the company for 31 years , is represented as Managing Director . &quot;
now he was retired at the age of 65 .
&quot; the drinking water @-@ purpose association of the V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein Group , based in Kot@@ ten@@ dorf , municipality Breit@@ brunn , encourages about 15@@ 0000 cubic meters of water each year and supplies 32 places and hamlet with about 5@@ 500 inhabitants . &quot;
&quot; the municipalities are church lou@@ der , Breit@@ brunn , Lau@@ ter , E@@ bel@@ sbach and the city of B@@ aun@@ ach . &quot;
there are water supply contracts for other cities and municipalities .
&quot; the current chairman , Breit@@ brun@@ ns Bürger@@ meister@@ in Ger@@ tru@@ d Büh@@ l ( FW ) , reminded that Ru@@ pert G@@ öller was appointed as a water@@ man in 1985 and was appointed Managing Director of the Association of Zw@@ eck@@ verband in 1988 . &quot;
&quot; his tasks have been very diverse and they stretched from the water pipeline construction and maintenance work on office and organization activities , the budget planning , calculation of fees and contributions to emergency assignments at weekends , &quot; &quot; said the chairman . &quot;
&quot; she called for the commissioning and initi@@ ation of the new well ( 1994 ) , land purchases in the area of the new well ( 1998 ) and compensation of the farmers , the renovation of a central computer control ( 2004 ) , the new acquisition of a central computer control ( 2004 ) and the divi@@ ding up of water pipes . &quot;
&quot; there have been no stand@@ still and I have always started new innovations , because water life is yield and drinking water the most important food . &quot;
&quot; in her lau@@ d@@ atio she praised Gö@@ ll@@ ers faithful , reliable and correct service for over 31 years . &quot;
he has used a lot of heart blood for his water @-@ purpose association and he has lived the water @-@ purpose association as if it were his own company .
&quot; a few weeks ago , he was a real practitioner to present the success concept of the V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein@@ group for nit@@ rate reduction in front of the water forum of the Lower Fran@@ conia district . &quot;
&quot; for that reason , he received a lot of recognition and praise . &quot;
&quot; Ru@@ pert G@@ öller , on his part , praised Al@@ f@@ ons G@@ rie@@ bel , who worked with him for 28 years . &quot;
he is the best water@@ man and he was a faithful Kn@@ appe .
together we were an unbe@@ atable team .
as high points from his point of view he described Brun@@ n@@ enbau and the re @-@ structuring of the association .
&quot; the biggest challenge and the most difficult task was , however , the pi@@ ping at the high container near Kirch@@ lou@@ der on a third of January . &quot;
here we had to work at minus 17 degrees throughout the night so that the villages could be supplied with water .
&quot; even the supply of Neu@@ brunn can only be maintained , because the high container from P@@ ett@@ stadt was filled with hoses . &quot;
&quot; the management of the drinking water purpose association was handed over to Daniel Stür@@ mer from Lau@@ ter , who will follow the succession of Ru@@ pert G@@ öller . &quot;
&quot; the soprano Anna Net@@ reb@@ ko is open to the au@@ tism of her son Ti@@ ago - and turns to other affected parents : &quot; &quot; they have to have the courage to talk about it . &quot;
&quot; the medicine has made great progress , &quot; said the 44 @-@ year @-@ old of the Italian newspaper &quot; Cor@@ riere della Ser@@ a . &quot; &quot;
&quot; when the disease had been recognized by her son , she believed she must die . &quot;
&quot; but the eight @-@ year old Ti@@ ago was well up@@ set , and now learn privately in New York , where there is the best therap@@ ists . &quot;

relationship at Bar@@ gt@@ eh@@ ei@@ de - man sho@@ ots at risk of life
a 35 @-@ year @-@ old man shot at a multi @-@ family house in Bar@@ gt@@ eh@@ ei@@ de ( district Stor@@ mar@@ n ) on Friday at 10.@@ 45 .
&quot; the man has inv@@ oked with us and stated to have shot his partner , &quot; &quot; said a police spokes@@ woman . &quot;
&quot; the perpetr@@ ator is on the run , and after him I am publicly punished . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , since Sven S. could be travelling by car . &quot;
&quot; the man is about 1.80 meters tall , mus@@ cular , brown burned and has a lat@@ ch . &quot;
&quot; in the meantime , the police have published a photo of him . &quot;
&quot; however , it is a few years old . &quot;
&quot; in the meantime , the man bears a lat@@ ch . &quot;
the man should not be addressed directly .
&quot; he could still carry the gun with himself , so the police . &quot;
who sees Sven S. shall call the 110 .
the police talks about a &quot; relationship . &quot;
&quot; the victim was born in 1988 , the perpetr@@ ator in 1981 . &quot;
&quot; at first , the responsible police in Lü@@ beck did not want to give any information about the ta@@ vern or the relationship between perpetr@@ ators and victims , but confirmed that a human being was killed . &quot;
it is a crime deli@@ ghts .
&quot; we do not say more at this moment , &quot; said a police spokes@@ woman in Lü@@ beck . &quot;
&quot; according to e@@ ye@@ witnesses , a Special Operations Command ( SEK ) was at the crime scene . &quot;
steel - Licht@@ blick for the German steel industry
the crisis @-@ torn and energy @-@ intensive German steel industry has spar@@ ed additional costs in millions of dollars .
financial bur@@ dens that the industry threatened from green electricity funding are from the table .
&quot; it remains in the release of the Renew@@ able Energy environment in the constitu@@ ents of the so @-@ called self @-@ current production in the German steel industry , said Federal Minister of Economic Affairs , Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) of the &quot; West@@ deutsche Allgemeine Zeitung &quot; ( WA@@ Z , Friday issue ) . &quot;
I am really happy that we could finally reach negotiations after two years of tough negotiations .
&quot; the European Commission had initially planned to use the steel producers , the gases out of the blast furnace for power generation for their own consumption , to ask for the cas@@ hier . &quot;
&quot; according to the German industry association , the steel industry threatened additional costs of 120 to 240 million euros per year . &quot;
&quot; Gabriel said the WA@@ Z , there is now a basic agreement with the European Commission for talks with the Commissioner Mar@@ gre@@ the V@@ est@@ ager . &quot;
&quot; only when the generators in the steel units are replaced , an E@@ EG @-@ lev@@ elling is 20 percent . &quot;
&quot; but , too , this will not be raised in the steel industry . &quot;
IG Metall welcomed Germany &apos;s agreement with the European Commission for self @-@ power production .
&quot; in this way , the status quo of the previous scheme is largely determined . &quot;
the successful efforts of Gabriel for the steel industry have special significance .
&quot; with regard to our campaign &apos; Stahl is Future &apos; , this is a first step . &quot;
&quot; others have to follow . &quot;
&quot; also in the reform of the emission rights sector , climate and employment targets are weak@@ ened , &quot; said IG Metall leader Jörg Hof@@ mann in Frankfurt . &quot;
the steel branch in Europe has been suffering from over@@ capacity since the financial crisis in 2008 and a significant price pressure .
&quot; last year , the situation was further ag@@ grav@@ ated as the world &apos;s largest producer in China threw masses of steel on the world market in view of the weak@@ ening domestic demand . &quot;
European manufacturers have launched price d@@ umping Chinese steel companies .
&quot; in the course of this spring , the situation has somewhat relaxed . &quot;
&quot; on the one hand , installed import duties on imported steel effect , on the other hand , the economic prospects in China have slow@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; un@@ clear , how sustainable the price recovery is . &quot;
the German industry pri@@ mus Th@@ ys@@ sen@@ k@@ ru@@ pp was cau@@ tious on Thursday .
&quot; last but not least , prices would have been rather stagn@@ ating . &quot;
the industry respon@@ ds to the difficult situation with further cost reductions .
Th@@ ys@@ sen@@ Kru@@ pp did not want to exclu@@ de finally also lock@@ ings of individual plants .
&quot; in the German steel industry , some 86@@ 0,000 people were employed at the end of 2015 . &quot;
&quot; in July , German steel producers remain cau@@ tious despite rising prices and increasing orders . &quot;
&quot; with 3.4 million tonnes , they produced six percent less crude steel than in the previous year , such as the Steel Community Steel on Friday . &quot;

&quot; community , Spirit , Health : singing is good sen@@ iors &quot;
&quot; the singing has accompanied Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp all her life : as young girl she was in the school choir , in the teacher &apos;s degree , she took the subject of music , and today the 78 @-@ year @-@ old sings in a sen@@ iors choir . &quot;
&quot; singing moves me - emotion@@ ally and physically , &quot; she describes . &quot;
&quot; after a rehear@@ sal , she feels balanced , cheerful and totally alive , she says . &quot;
&quot; by the way , she does something good for her health and spirit . &quot;
&quot; singing is a great hobby for sen@@ iors from several perspectives , says Er@@ hard H@@ ac@@ kler from the German senior league . &quot;
&quot; most sen@@ iors sing in the choir and share with like @-@ minded the joy of music , describes H@@ ac@@ kler . &quot;
&quot; by regular co@@ hes@@ ion , sen@@ iors can soci@@ alize and maintain social contacts . &quot;
&quot; because often social and family structures dis@@ solve in old age , a choir is then an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people . &quot;
&quot; this experience has also made Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp in her choir : &quot; to speak and organize , to be able to leave and to learn from one another - a choir is a very special form of being together . &quot;
&quot; singing can be stren@@ uous in the positive sense , says H@@ ac@@ kler . &quot;
&quot; for doing so , sen@@ iors train a deep and controlled breathing . &quot;
those who demand his lungs regularly get out of the pu@@ ste even in everyday life .
&quot; even if it comes to receiving the sound of the voice at the age , singing is an optimal hobby . &quot;
&quot; on older people , singing often has a very special effect , says Ursula L@@ enz from the Federal Labour Association of Senior Ci@@ tiz@@ ens . &quot;
&quot; in the older generations , common singing had a much higher priority , it belonged to everyday life , both at school and in leisure time , she explains . &quot;
&quot; L@@ enz often ob@@ serves that singing or hearing songs in elderly people awak@@ ens a lot of memories , often associated with positive feelings of their adol@@ escence . &quot;
&quot; through lyrics and especially melodies , even demen@@ tia people ab@@ ound for long past events . &quot;
&quot; in singing , the head also requires a special performance , explains L@@ enz . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , focus on his own voice and on a given rhythm and adap@@ ting to the other singers - this is a great cognitive challenge . &quot;
&quot; especially older people , who live alone , do not only practice themselves to concentrate on themselves . &quot;
&quot; another positive aspect is the recognition that one lear@@ ns through singing in the choir , says H@@ ac@@ kler . &quot;
an enthusiastic audience is a great praise .
the self @-@ este@@ em also grows through singing in the choir .
&quot; show yourself : if I do a long time for something , I will better and grow beyond me - this experience strengthens . &quot;
&quot; good reasons to begin with singing , so there is enough . &quot;
&quot; who wants to try a new hobby , should not hesitate - even if he means to have little talent , advis@@ es L@@ enz . &quot;
&quot; you don &apos;t sing alone - with 50 singing people , who h@@ ears there when a sound goes beside it ? &quot;
&quot; in search of the appropriate offer , sen@@ iors have different possibilities , says H@@ ac@@ kler . &quot;
&quot; if someone from the acquain@@ t@@ ance circle sings in a senior choir , one can simply join . &quot;
many cities also offer over@@ views over the cho@@ irs in the surrounding area .
those who want to sing in a church choir can turn directly to the church or church leader .
many senior cho@@ irs can also be found on the Internet .
&quot; who does not have access to the Internet , the family , friends or neighbours can ask for help with the internet research . &quot;
&quot; who lust has to sing , should necessarily join a choir , advis@@ es H@@ ac@@ kler . &quot;
singing does the soul well and has something liber@@ ating - that applies to all ages .
cats react sensi@@ tively as a han@@ go@@ ver on the cri@@ es of the young
bi@@ ologists have studied in Hanover which effect has the rep@@ lication of cat litter on adult animals .
&quot; to her surprise , the mi@@ str@@ ust also did not leave the males cold - however , they beha@@ ved in contrast to the females always the same . &quot;
female cats can recognize the elevation of cat @-@ cats on the peac@@ o@@ cks of the little ones .
&quot; they respond by ten per cent faster to sounds of k@@ itt@@ ens , who have found themselves in great distress , as scientists from the veter@@ inary university and the Medical School Hannover ( M@@ HH ) have found out . &quot;
&quot; boys also react to the calls of k@@ itt@@ ens - however , always the same . &quot;
&quot; apparently the acoustic differences between the mi@@ str@@ ust of less and strongly excited young animals for the males are either not percep@@ tible or not of meaning , &quot; said the bi@@ ologist Wi@@ eb@@ ke Kon@@ er@@ ding from the M@@ HH . &quot;
she is the first author@@ it@@ ator of the study published on this Friday in the journal &quot; BM@@ C Evol@@ ution@@ ary Biology . &quot;
&quot; in a previous study , the research team had already found that the duration and pitch of the k@@ itt@@ ens @-@ cri@@ mp differ with the ur@@ gency of their dependen@@ cy . &quot;
a total of nine adult male and eight female k@@ itt@@ ens were observed from the animal hus@@ band@@ ry of the M@@ HH .
&quot; they were played for a rest of little ones , taken from the throw box for three minutes and separated from mother and si@@ bl@@ ings . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , they were confronted with scre@@ aming of stronger k@@ itt@@ ens , which were additionally raised . &quot;
the researchers keep their results in spite of the small sample for meaningful results .
&quot; all females , even those who had no offspring , differentiated to the cri@@ es , &quot; &quot; said Kon@@ er@@ ding . &quot;
&quot; they turned faster to the loudspeaker , when this calls played the very excited k@@ itt@@ ens . &quot;
this ability is possibly inn@@ ate or develop with the sex@@ ually mature .
&quot; a surprise was that the males have re@@ acted at all , &quot; &quot; said the bi@@ ologist . &quot;
&quot; in the past , scientists have repeatedly examined the reactions of women and men on baby sounds . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , some studies showed that women were more sensitive to inf@@ ants regardless of whether they were mothers or not , bi@@ ologist Marina Sche@@ um@@ ann reported . &quot;
Po@@ dol@@ sky attacks &quot; g@@ ala &quot; after Super@@ cup
Hak@@ an Sü@@ kü@@ r is a football legend in Turkey .
Turkey has been issued an arrest warran@@ t against the former football star Hak@@ an Sü@@ kü@@ r .
he is accused of being a member of a terrorist group .
&quot; for the first time after the coup attempt , Turkey is again taking place an important football match . &quot;
&quot; before the du@@ el of the arch@@ ri@@ vals between Bes@@ i@@ kt@@ as Istanbul and Lukas Po@@ dol@@ ski Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay Istanbul for the Super@@ cup in Kon@@ ya , the official line is clear : &quot; business as usual &quot; is announced . &quot;
&quot; in July , the government , the daily routine of norm@@ ali@@ ers should not be affected . &quot;
&quot; however , this does not apply to those who are suspected of belonging to the movement of the pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len which is responsible for the coup attempt . &quot;
this is not done before football .
&quot; against the former Star@@ k@@ icker Hak@@ an Sü@@ me@@ v , the Prosec@@ ution issued an arrest warran@@ t . &quot;
&quot; according to this , the South Coast living in America is now accused of being a member of a terrorist group . &quot;
Sü@@ cows should be a follow@@ er of Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len who is responsible for the coup attempt by President Rec@@ ep Tay@@ y@@ ip Erd@@ og@@ an .
&quot; although the emergency state suspended for 90 days is still valid until October , it actually has no effect on the lives of most Turks . &quot;
&quot; the ni@@ ghtly &quot; &quot; democracy guards &quot; &quot; on public places throughout the country has declared Erd@@ og@@ an on Wednesday for termin@@ ated . &quot;
the sport is - like the whole country - split into followers and opponents of Erd@@ og@@ an .
especially fans of Bes@@ i@@ kt@@ as are traditionally not among the friends of the president .
&quot; but in view of dramatic experiences in history , what the Gro@@ s of Turks inv@@ aded is the strict rejection of military coup . &quot;
even the fans agree - whether their heart beats for Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay or Bes@@ i@@ kt@@ as .
&quot; at Po@@ kal@@ si@@ eger &quot; Gala , &quot; it will be especially noticeable on Lukas Po@@ dol@@ sky . &quot;
&quot; the Cologne in the past season proved its sporty value : with 17 gates and nine templates in all competitions , the 31 @-@ year @-@ old ended his first season as the top sc@@ orer of his club . &quot;
in the final match against Fen@@ erb@@ ah@@ ce he scored the 1 : 0 victory hit .
the newspaper &quot; F@@ AN@@ AT@@ IK &quot; che@@ ered him : &quot; he was the best in the square . &quot;
he completed the season in an excellent way and secured the tro@@ phy to his team .
&quot; thanks to &quot; Pol@@ di , &quot; the dis@@ ap@@ pointing season for the record master found a con@@ cili@@ atory conclusion . &quot;
&quot; after the pre @-@ round @-@ K.@@ O in the Champions League , the &quot; lions &quot; also leave early in the Europa League . &quot;
&quot; in the south per Li@@ g , it was enough to rank six . &quot;
the season was not good .
the tro@@ phy was the only way to gain something .
&quot; this is the most important thing , &quot; &quot; said Po@@ dol@@ sky . &quot;
for Master Bes@@ i@@ kt@@ as the game year was better .
&quot; thanks to Mario Gom@@ ez , who covered 26 season numbers as Sü@@ per @-@ Li@@ g @-@ Tor@@ der@@ ö@@ nig the basis for the 14th title . &quot;
this is also the reason that the fans will continue to hope for the return of the 31 @-@ year @-@ old .
&quot; in doing so , the Gom@@ ez had to be announced at the AC Florence and to Bes@@ i@@ kt@@ as , following the coup attempt , not to return because of the political situation in the country after his European holiday . &quot;
&quot; if Mario however wants to come to us , he only has to say it , &quot; &quot; quoted the specialist magazine &quot; K@@ icker &quot; Club Director F@@ ik@@ ret Or@@ man . &quot;
&quot; however , the stor@@ mer would have to be ready to ren@@ ounce about a third of his annual average of 7.5 million euros , Or@@ man noted : &quot; his salary in Florence cannot be paid . &quot;
despite D@@ oping : these athletes have still medals opportunities at Olympia in Rio
the 34 @-@ year @-@ old Jus@@ tin Gat@@ lin was already locked twice because of D@@ op@@ ings ( 2001 and 2006 ) .
Rio de Janeiro - W@@ hist@@ le@@ blo@@ wer@@ in Julia Step@@ an@@ ova is not allowed to start in Rio .
other superior athle@@ tics sinners can only laugh about it - they fight in Rio for medals .
the theme of dop@@ ing is still the head@@ lines of the Olympic Games in Rio .
&quot; the Russian flo@@ wer@@ in Juli@@ ja J@@ ef@@ im@@ owa , who had lam@@ ented their start right before the games after a dop@@ ing lock , was mer@@ cil@@ ess@@ ly plu@@ cked out and bu@@ sted at their start ( 100 meters of breast ) . &quot;
it was a sc@@ ur@@ ry scene : with a rising smile she was still st@@ oked into the hall and had prov@@ oked her appearance .
&quot; when it was determined that she won &apos;t get gold , the audience broke out into a j@@ ub@@ ble storm . &quot;
&quot; but there are numerous other sport@@ s@@ men who , despite the D@@ oping past , go to the start at the Olympic Games in Rio . &quot;
here is an overview :
&quot; Jus@@ tin Gat@@ lin ( 100 , 200 , 4x@@ 100 @-@ m @-@ Season / USA ) : the 34 @-@ year @-@ old is one of the most controversial figures in athle@@ tics . &quot;
he was locked twice because of D@@ op@@ ings ( 2001 and 2006 until 2010 ) .
&quot; since his spell , the Olympic champion of 2004 and ex @-@ world champion continues even faster than before , he is the number one in the world over 100 m in 9,@@ 80 seconds and is considered the biggest chall@@ enger of U@@ sa@@ in Bol@@ t . &quot;
&quot; Shel@@ ly @-@ Ann Fr@@ aser @-@ Pr@@ yce ( 100 , 4x@@ 100 @-@ m @-@ relay / Jam@@ ai@@ ka ) : the two @-@ time Olympic champion and seven @-@ fold world champion had to sit in 2010 a six @-@ month lock , after it was detected by Ox@@ y@@ co@@ don . &quot;
&quot; after surgery , I had severe pain , the 29 @-@ year @-@ old was defending itself . &quot;
&quot; Sandra Per@@ kovic ( Disk@@ us / Croatia ) : 2011 the Olympic champion of 2012 , world champion of 2013 and European Championship was tested positively on the banned stimul@@ ant of meth@@ yl@@ hex@@ an@@ amine in 2010 and 2016 . &quot;
&quot; Per@@ kovic denied vis@@ cer@@ al intake , and was closed for six months . &quot;
the four fur@@ th@@ est lit@@ ters this year go to the account of the big Gold@@ fav@@ ori@@ tin .
&quot; La@@ Sha@@ wn Mer@@ ritt ( 200 , 400 , 4x@@ 400 @-@ m @-@ Season / USA ) : the Beijing Olympic champion and two @-@ time world champion over 400 m , was well tested in 2010 and was closed for 21 months . &quot;
&quot; a means of penis enlargement was responsible , fired merge . &quot;
this year the 30 @-@ year @-@ old is over 200 and 400 m the fastest man in the world so far .
&quot; Ivan Ti@@ ch@@ on ( hammer throw , B@@ yel@@ or@@ us@@ sia ) : probably hardly an ath@@ l@@ ete , so many medals have been det@@ on@@ ated afterwards . &quot;
Ti@@ ch@@ on lost his World Cup title from 2005 nine years later after having found testosterone dop@@ ing .
the meanwhile 40 @-@ year @-@ old had to release Olympia @-@ Silver 2004 for ster@@ oid dop@@ ing and the EM title 2006 because of testosterone abuse .
&quot; the Bronze Med@@ al of the 2008 Olympic Games , which was also recognized by the 2008 Olympic Games , returned to CAS for its verdi@@ ct . &quot;
&quot; with 8@@ 0,@@ 04 m , he ranks second in the world ranking . &quot;
&quot; Li@@ u Hong ( 20 km Walk , China ) : the world record and Gold@@ fav@@ ori@@ tin was first tested in May , but may still be started in Rio . &quot;
&quot; at the 29 year old world champion , references to the intake of a banned dietary supplement were found , the lock of the world anti @-@ dop@@ ing agency WA@@ DA fell mil@@ de and ran off on July 13th . &quot;
bomb terror in Thailand - Austri@@ ans injured - Multiple T@@ ote
&quot; the Austrian Embassy in Thailand is in contact with the woman , said the spokes@@ man of the State Department , Thomas Schn@@ ö@@ ll , Friday morning . &quot;
&quot; she suffered from cutting wounds and had been treated in the hospital , but I have left it again . &quot;
she planned her home journey for the beginning of September .
&quot; whether from the further explo@@ sions on the island of Ph@@ u@@ ket and in the southern cities of Sur@@ at Th@@ ani , Ph@@ ang N@@ ga , Tran@@ g and Ch@@ om@@ p@@ he also Austrian citizens , are still un@@ clear . &quot;
&quot; the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is in constant contact with the local authorities , such as waste . &quot;
&quot; at about 200 kilometres south of the capital Bangkok , Hu@@ a H@@ in explo@@ ded two bombs on Thursday evening . &quot;
&quot; according to the police , a Tha@@ il@@ ar changed and about 20 people were injured , including the Austri@@ ans , three Germans , three Dutch and three Itali@@ ans . &quot;
&quot; on Friday , two explosive rates went up again , and a further person was killed according to the authorities . &quot;
also from Ph@@ u@@ ket a bomb explosion was reported in the morning .
&quot; during the det@@ on@@ ation near the popular bathing beach Pat@@ ong , a taxi driver was injured after police statements . &quot;
&quot; in Sur@@ at Th@@ ani on the south @-@ east coast of the country , another bomb explo@@ ded , which killed an urban population . &quot;
&quot; according to the authorities , the explosive rate has gone into the air in a flower bed in front of the prec@@ inct of the coastal police . &quot;
&quot; finally , Det@@ on@@ ations in Ph@@ ang N@@ ga and Tran@@ g demanded several injured at the south @-@ west coast as well as in Ch@@ om@@ p@@ he on the south @-@ east coast . &quot;
&quot; from a connection with the explo@@ sions in Hu@@ a H@@ in , it was called . &quot;
&quot; the bomb attacks carry the same manuscript , &quot; &quot; said Ar@@ rit@@ sar Dan@@ ai K@@ rit@@ meth@@ av@@ ee Friday morning before journalists . &quot;
we assume that it is a co @-@ ordin@@ ated attack .
&quot; it is too early to express himself about possible motives , but it is likely to be the actions of Muslim rebels . &quot;
Thai media also wanted to see a pattern typical for bom@@ bing Muslim separ@@ ati@@ sts in the south of the country .
&quot; the Thai police , on the other hand , stated that the attacks were not in connection with the Islam@@ ist movement or with international terrorism . &quot;
&quot; this is only local sab@@ ot@@ age restricted to limited areas and provinces , &quot; said a spokes@@ man in Bangkok . &quot;
rather it is assumed that the bombs of opponents of the ruling military jun@@ ta were laid .
&quot; in recent days , the authorities had kept secret evidence on imp@@ ending attacks in the south of the country - however , they were not informed about the exact time and places . &quot;
&quot; still be un@@ clear , which group is hiding behind the attacks . &quot;
&quot; the police instruc@@ ted its officials throughout the country to rein@@ force security around important governmental buildings , airports , train stations , tourist attractions , restaurants and entertainment districts . &quot;
&quot; in Thailand , there are always smaller bom@@ b@@ ings , but mostly they are not directed against tourists . &quot;
in Hu@@ a H@@ in is a palace which was used over the years of Thailand &apos;s king B@@ hum@@ i@@ bol Adul@@ y@@ ade@@ j .
&quot; after the well @-@ known bom@@ bing explo@@ sions , the Austrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs is recommen@@ ding to follow the instructions of the Thai Security Auth@@ orities . &quot;
&quot; high security risk ( security level 3 ) used for the provinces of Nar@@ ath@@ iw@@ at , Y@@ ala , P@@ att@@ ani and Son@@ gh@@ kl@@ a as well as Pre@@ ah V@@ ih@@ ear and its surroundings . &quot;
&quot; after confron@@ tations between the security forces and the Muslim populations , there will be no necessary travel to these provinces . &quot;
increased safety risk ( security level 2 ) suffered for the rest of the country .
the attacks on Thursday and Friday were a few days after a controversial referendum held by the military jun@@ ta .
this gives the military great influence over the coming years .
&quot; jun@@ ta boss and Prime Minister Pra@@ y@@ ut Ch@@ an @-@ o @-@ cha said that bombs were an attempt to sti@@ ften chaos while the country is moving towards stability , improvement of economic situation and tourism . &quot;
&quot; the military un@@ ta , who had seized power in 2014 after a phase of bloody un@@ rest , with@@ drew himself to have led the kingdom back to stability and order . &quot;
&quot; however , the military did not succeed in obtaining a grip for the uprising of Muslim rebels for years in the extreme south of the country . &quot;
more than 6@@ 500 people have been killed in the conflict .
&quot; almost one year ago in Bangkok , a stop at a popular Hin@@ du @-@ shr@@ ine 20 people had been killed in Bangkok - most of them foreign tourists . &quot;
it was the most bloody stop of the recent history of the country .
&quot; the right &quot; &quot; I@@ den@@ tit@@ ular movement &quot; &quot; has come into the visor of the Federal Office for constitutional protection . &quot;
&quot; after several state offices , the constitutional conserv@@ ation@@ ists in the federal government have also set up the group under observation . &quot;
&quot; we see at the &apos; identical movement &apos; evidence for efforts against the liberal democratic constitution , &quot; said Mr President Hans @-@ Georg Ma@@ aß of the Deutsche Presse @-@ Agentur in Berlin . &quot;
&quot; thus , immigrants Islamic faith or the Middle East are being diff@@ used in extrem@@ ist ways . &quot;
that is why we watch the movement now also .
&quot; the &quot; &quot; I@@ den@@ tit@@ ular movement &quot; &quot; is a group@@ ing with French roots , which has been active in Germany since 2012 . &quot;
&quot; it is directed against &quot; &quot; Mul@@ tik@@ ult@@ i @-@ W@@ ahn &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ controlled mass immigration &quot; &quot; and the &quot; &quot; loss of one &apos;s own identity through alien@@ ation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; constitutional conserv@@ ation@@ ists in nine federal states - Bremen , Bavaria , Hessen , Berlin , Baden @-@ Württemberg , NRW , Lower Saxony , Saxony and Thuring@@ ia - observe the &quot; identical &quot; already . &quot;
he said that his authority was closely aligned with the sover@@ eig@@ ns in the decision .
&quot; groups like the &apos; I@@ den@@ tit@@ ular movement &apos; try to pick up their target group , where it stands , &quot; said the Constitutional Court . &quot;
&quot; generally , extre@@ mi@@ sts try to address them with y@@ outh@@ ful language , often with p@@ opp@@ y music . &quot;
the Islamic Islam@@ ists as well as right @-@ wing extre@@ mi@@ sts .
this is no public@@ ity for their own cause .
the propaganda should address people emotion@@ ally .
young people are in a very special way vulnerable .
this is dangerous .
&quot; last but not least , there have been reports from several federal states about contacts of &quot; &quot; identi@@ ties &quot; &quot; to Af@@ D politicians . &quot;
&quot; he said , he did not have any knowledge . &quot;
&quot; for constitutional protection , possible contacts of this kind are only relevant to a certain point . &quot;
&quot; it depends on whether the respective party - in this case , the Af@@ D - by certain individuals that are extrem@@ ist , changes its direction and becomes extrem@@ ist . &quot;
so crucial is whether such persons have controlled influence on the party .
this is not evident .
&quot; with a view to the clear increase in legal crimes and attacks on asylum seek@@ ers and refugees , Ma@@ eva said that he would not speak of new right terrorism in this regard . &quot;
but we have noticed in recent years that there can be right @-@ terrorism structures .
there was the group &apos; Old School Society &apos; or the Frei@@ tal group .
&quot; it may well be that other rights @-@ terrorism groups or small groups form , the attacks against asylum seek@@ ers , against refugee homes or attacks from other right @-@ wing extrem@@ ist motives . &quot;
&quot; however , a nationwide or Europe @-@ wide control of right @-@ terrorism is not recogni@@ zable . &quot;
the previous groups were created on the regional level or in social networks .
&quot; worried about the fact that many attacks went to the account of people , who had previously not appeared in the right scene . &quot;
this is the wor@@ rying thing .
&quot; many of the susp@@ ects in attacks on asylum detention have not been known as crimin@@ als , politically motivated perpetr@@ ators or supporters of the right scene . &quot;
&quot; so many people have committed crimes that had nothing to do with right @-@ wing extre@@ mi@@ sts , perhaps politically in@@ different , or for example , CD@@ U , SPD or left , which , however , radic@@ alized themselves through right @-@ wing extre@@ mis@@ m . &quot;
Rio 2016 : RO@@ BEL Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te becomes Inter@@ ne@@ th@@ ite
not always the Olympic Games or World Records determine the head@@ lines at the Olympic Games .
this shows the brave appearance of Ro@@ bel Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te at the summer games in Rio de Janeiro .
&quot; in the Aqu@@ atics Center , the easily over@@ weight s@@ wimm@@ ers from Ethiopia are so slow that it was no longer visible in the TV pictures . &quot;
it simply disappeared - no matter how far the cut@@ out was selected .
&quot; in social networks , Hab@@ te became a viral inter@@ ne@@ th@@ ite . &quot;
&quot; in fact , the 24 @-@ year @-@ old ex@@ pi@@ red with a back@@ rest of 48 seconds and occupied the 59@@ th place of 59 star@@ ters . &quot;
but it was rather his not just athle@@ tic figure that attracted the attention of the international media .
why the 24 @-@ year @-@ old still participate in the Olympics ?
the Ethiop@@ ian got a special start right from the international swimming pool .
this is distributed to make swimming in the presented countries well known .
&quot; since most athletes run in Ethiopia , Hab@@ la wanted to do something different . &quot;
preparation is everything : RO@@ BEL Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te is ready for the big race .
quickly the first nick@@ names made the round .
some media referred him as &quot; ro@@ bel of the wh@@ ale . &quot;
&quot; referring to a &quot; &quot; well @-@ being &quot; &quot; the English tab@@ loid &quot; &quot; The Sun &quot; &quot; with &quot; &quot; D@@ ad B@@ od &quot; &quot; made fun of him . &quot;
&quot; his time , he only beat with a minute and almost five seconds over the 100 metres of free style , did not play any role . &quot;
compar@@ isons with &quot; Eric the E@@ el &quot; were also drawn .
&quot; at the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney , the run by Eric M@@ ous@@ sam@@ ban@@ i ensured media attention . &quot;
&quot; unforgettable was the appearance of the s@@ wimm@@ ers from Equ@@ at@@ orial Guinea , when he had to compete on his own 100 m Fre@@ estyle alone . &quot;
&quot; f@@ ren@@ e@@ tically , M@@ ous@@ sam@@ ban@@ i was fired at that time . &quot;
the 22 @-@ year @-@ old learned only eight months before Olympia and had never completed such a long distance before the competition .

Ger@@ ets@@ ried - The owner of a shop at the New Place has been stolen .
&quot; according to the police , the 67 @-@ year @-@ old Ger@@ ets@@ rie@@ der@@ in had left their business on Monday at 17.@@ 30 a.m. and forgot to close a window on the ground floor . &quot;
&quot; when she returned the next morning at 8.@@ 15 o &apos;clock , about 250 Euro had disappeared from the Cas@@ hier . &quot;
traces of the perpetr@@ ator could not be found .
video surveillance is also not available .
Tr@@ ump does not see the threatening electoral set@@ back so narrow
the Repub@@ lican candidate Donald Tr@@ ump speaks at a campaign in Florida .
&quot; if there is nothing to do with the election to the US president , Donald Tr@@ ump has already an alternative video . &quot;
he then drove into the holiday .
&quot; Donald Tr@@ ump loses the US presidential elections in November , it wouldn &apos;t matter : &quot; ultimately it will either fold , or I have a very , very nice , long vacation , &quot; said the candidate of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans in a telephone interview with the U.S. TV station CNB@@ C . &quot;
&quot; if it does not reach him at the end for reasons of political correctness , it is fine , said Tr@@ ump . &quot;
&quot; he described US President Barack Obama and the candidate of democr@@ ats , Hill@@ ary Clinton , as founder of the terrorist mili@@ tia Islamic State ( IS ) . &quot;
&quot; at the end of his party , more and more resistance formed . &quot;
post is entering the trade with electric transpor@@ ters
an electric motor vehicle of the Deutsche Post in action .
the interest of other companies in the vehicle is obviously great .
the post plans to sell her electric vehicle Stre@@ et@@ Sco@@ oter too .
&quot; in short , the Group wants to start trading with the transpor@@ ter . &quot;
the mail wants to offer its electric transpor@@ ters from the coming year also on the free car market .
&quot; we want to enter the sale to third parties , &quot; said a post @-@ speaker on Friday . &quot;

accidents - Bus slip in Krum@@ m@@ hör@@ n in dit@@ ch : eight injured
&quot; on Thursday in Krum@@ m@@ hör@@ n ( Land@@ kreis Aur@@ ich ) , eight people have been injured in an accident of a travel agency with 43 sen@@ iors . &quot;
&quot; two of the occup@@ ants suffered severe injuries , divided the police . &quot;
&quot; the 66 @-@ year @-@ old driver of a travel company from Eisen@@ ach had to switch to an opposite truck , which partly went on the counter @-@ road@@ way . &quot;
the bus came to the right of the road and sli@@ d into a dit@@ ch like a spokes@@ woman of the Police Aur@@ ich / Witt@@ mund reported .
&quot; due to the location of the bus , the people could not leave the bus independently , &quot; she said . &quot;
the fire bri@@ g@@ ade liber@@ ated the occup@@ ants .
six ambul@@ ances and emergency ambul@@ ances came to the accident site on the provincial road 2 .
the ir@@ res@@ isti@@ ble travellers were brought back from a bus to Krum@@ m@@ hör@@ ner district P@@ ew@@ sum .
there they should wait for a replacement bus of the travel company .
the investig@@ ators demanded the vice @-@ reader and possible witnesses to report to the police .
&quot; as of October 1 , 2016 , the fees per cubic metre of wast@@ ewater will amount to € 2,@@ 10 for the area of sewage plant Neu@@ dorf / Re@@ uth / Wel@@ hen 3,@@ 44 instead of € 2,@@ 10 ; for Zul@@ ten@@ berg / Lin@@ den@@ berg / lo@@ pp 3,@@ 36 Euro ( up to now 2,@@ 18 Euro ) . &quot;
&quot; at the plant in Az@@ endorf , the wast@@ ewater fee will increase at the latest when appropriate improvement measures are necessary . &quot;
&quot; after a per@@ tin@@ ent calculation , the wast@@ ewater price in Az@@ endorf is then at 4.@@ 37 euros per cubic meter . &quot;
&quot; as mayor Bernd Stein@@ häuser ( CS@@ U ) reported , in the approval of the household by the Federal Council of Kul@@ mb@@ ach , it was established that these sewage systems have under@@ gone under@@ coverings . &quot;
&quot; due to legal bases , the market of Kas@@ endorf is obliged to operate the facilities at a cost @-@ effective basis . &quot;
&quot; from 1 October 2016 , the citizens as well as the industrial and industrial companies from Wel@@ sch@@ ahl , Neu@@ dorf , Re@@ uth , Az@@ endorf , lo@@ pp , Lin@@ den@@ berg and Zul@@ ten@@ berg will have to interv@@ ene more deeply into the pur@@ se . &quot;
the rate increases between 48 and 67 percent .
&quot; as Head of Board of Directors Herbert Schmidt showed the committee , a new calculation of the fees for the sewage systems of the market community was necessary . &quot;
&quot; during the period from October 2016 to September 2020 , over@@ - and under@@ coverings from the preceding period of calculation were to be compens@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; Schmidt therefore founded the gra@@ ving fee rises by relatively small establishments with a very low waste of wast@@ ewater , between 68@@ 00 and 1@@ 2000 cubic meters per year . &quot;
&quot; due to the low distribution basis , for example expendi@@ tures for necessary repairs of several thousand euros would have a serious impact . &quot;
&quot; in addition , waste water in all three plants is slightly dec@@ lining . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , in the rec@@ lining period of the calculation of all three systems , not least , due to their age of renovation and repair costs , they declined in a considerable extent . &quot;
&quot; the plant in Az@@ endorf was almost 30 years old , the facilities for a cat@@ er@@ pillar , Neu@@ dorf and Re@@ uth as well as Zul@@ ten@@ berg , Lin@@ den@@ berg and lo@@ pp almost 20 years . &quot;
Schmidt pointed out that the mechanical ventilation system had to be replaced due to damage in the Az@@ endorf wast@@ ewater plant .
&quot; after nearly 20 years of operation the first sewage slu@@ dge had to be repaired , the sewage slu@@ dge dispos@@ es and an additional ventilation facility had to be installed in order to be able to maintain the water @-@ legal requirements in the future . &quot;
&quot; Schmidt : &quot; for these extraordinary expenses , the continued care and maintenance costs , which should be taken into account accordingly in the new calculation period . &quot;

stone houses made it clear that with the low waste of sewage in the three plants the expenses for operation and maintenance are fully exploited .
&quot; in doing so , Schmidt comple@@ mented the market community of large entertainment costs in wast@@ ewater facilities in the past 20 years . &quot;
&quot; the situation for the a@@ forem@@ en@@ tioned facilities will continue to remain prec@@ ari@@ ous in the view of stone houses on the long run , especially since the supply area of the Fri@@ es@@ enb@@ ach@@ tal wast@@ ewater treatment association cannot be expanded in order to not extend these facilities because it is a sanitary facilities . &quot;
Bulgaria for the first time in 8 months of inflation
national statistics show that inflation in Bulgaria was 1 % on a monthly basis in July .
&quot; this is the highest value ( since June 2012 ) and the first over zero since October last year , as positive 0,2 % were booked . &quot;
the annual average rate of the last 12 months ( August 2015 - July 2016 ) compared to the previous 12 months ( August 2014 - July 2015 ) was measured according to the CP@@ I -@@ 0.8 % .
&quot; the consumer price index in July 2016 compared to June 2016 was 10@@ 1.0 % , i.e. monthly inflation was 1.0 % . &quot;
the inflation rate since the beginning of the year ( July 2016 compared to December 2015 ) was -@@ 0.2 % and the annual inflation in July 2016 was compared to July 2015 -@@ 0.2 % .
&quot; in July 2016 , a price increase of the following groups of consumer goods was observed : food and non @-@ alcoholic drinks ( 1.7 % ) ; Transportation ( 1.8 % ) ; leisure and culture ( 6.3 % ) ; restaurants and hotels ( 1.2 % ) ; various goods and services ( 0.3 % ) . &quot;
&quot; prices fell by clothes and shoes ( 2.2 % ) ; Mo@@ bili@@ ar , household appliances and routine maintenance ( 0.5 % ) ; health ( 0.1 % ) . &quot;
&quot; prices remained as in the pre @-@ month for alcoholic beverages and tobacco ; apartments , water , electricity , gas and other fuels ; communication ; as well as education unchanged . &quot;
&quot; Snap@@ chat &quot; &quot; Ani@@ me &quot; &quot; effect critic@@ ises as an Asian car@@ ic@@ ature &quot;
&quot; Snap@@ chat says that this filter is anim@@ e @-@ inspired , but some ob@@ servers say it is in@@ sensitive to races . &quot;
&quot; with its filter tool , Snap@@ chat enables around 150 million daily users to change reality and to play with identi@@ ties in such a way that borders the absur@@ de . &quot;
&quot; you can turn into a p@@ ine@@ apple , a dog or a figure that could be of a Roy Licht@@ enstein painting . &quot;
&quot; the filters are un@@ compressed , self @-@ prop@@ elled tools that generate more than 30 million enhanced sel@@ fies per day . &quot;
all the faul@@ ts arrive to the public .
&quot; in the past , Snap@@ chat filters have been critic@@ ised in the past that they were acc@@ using that the App Black@@ face promoted or would propag@@ ate white skin as a beauty ideal . &quot;
&quot; when this week suggested some users a filter that gave them sli@@ t eyes , false teeth and ev@@ apor@@ ated che@@ eks , some critics called a rac@@ ist car@@ ic@@ ature of Asi@@ ans - &quot; Yellow face . &quot; &quot;
&quot; they wonder@@ ed if these repeated controversi@@ es pointed out to a greater problem , that the company has diversity . &quot;
&quot; the news and the ou@@ trage were widely distributed on Wednesday , with reports from The Ver@@ ge and Mother@@ board , a day after Snap@@ chat announced that it had de@@ activated the feature . &quot;
the company offered an ap@@ ology : the filter was intended as hom@@ age to anim@@ e characters and not as car@@ ic@@ ature of Asi@@ ans .
&quot; but out@@ si@@ ders who have experienced rac@@ ism , the filter reminded of hur@@ ting c@@ lich@@ és . &quot;
others rejected the anim@@ e @-@ comparison decided .
&quot; in an e @-@ mail , Grace Spar@@ ap@@ ani , a Korean @-@ American art student , whose twe@@ ets were widely spread across the photos that the filter &quot; &quot; hur@@ ting and reading &quot; &quot; was unpleasant . &quot;
&quot; she added that &quot; &quot; it is difficult to argue with the contrast of a very contradic@@ tory Asi@@ atic car@@ ic@@ ature and the filter effects . &quot;
&quot; it shows that the filter is not yellow @-@ proof , but that the yellow face has been pulled into the ab@@ duc@@ tory extreme . &quot;
Snap@@ chat is not the only company that crosses this cultural pride of pride .
&quot; American culture seems to be involved in an endless diversity of diversity and integration , from conference rooms to Hollywood and the devices that we all hold in the hand . &quot;
and Snap@@ ch@@ ats big audience of young people - who are in terms of race different than their older counter@@ actors - could be more likely to expect sen@@ sibility .
&quot; if one of Snap@@ chat filters creates a picture that is offensive for a user , &quot; it is much more difficult for a user to remain un@@ noticed than it was before , &quot; said the 25 @-@ year @-@ old K@@ atie Z@@ hu in an interview on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , Z@@ hu , who works as a product manager and engineer for medium to delete their Snap@@ chat account , asked others to do the same . &quot;
&quot; in an essay for medium and in a phone interview , she said that she believes that rapid @-@ related controversi@@ es have a lack of diversity among the recruitment practices in Snap@@ chat . &quot;
&quot; Z@@ hu critici@@ zed the large part white , only male leadership and finished her essay with a h@@ ash@@ tag : # Del@@ et@@ e@@ Snap@@ chat . &quot;
&quot; either they have no different representation of people with other skin colors in their workforce so that they can make such decisions , &quot; &quot; said the Chinese @-@ American Z@@ hu , &quot; &quot; or they have people with other skin colors that work there , but not in positions where they feel safe or comfortable to say about it . &quot;
&quot; others share their opinion , a complaint that Snap@@ chat has largely left un@@ answered . &quot;
the company does not publish figures to the diversity of its staff and points to its status as a private company .
&quot; on Thursday , it refused to discuss the cultural background of its staff , but according to a spokes@@ man the company recently recru@@ ited a personnel responsible who focused on under@@ represented populations and on internal integration efforts . &quot;
&quot; he said , &quot; &quot; I wonder if they need more users like us to say that this is not O.@@ K. &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; military leadership for@@ fei@@ ted IS@@ IS intelligence , the Committee of the Congress &quot;
&quot; military personnel of the United States Central Command changed the intelligence of intelligence to draw an optim@@ istic picture of the war against the so @-@ called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria , as it allowed the actual conditions on the ground to report on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; the provis@@ ional report , created by a Task Force of the Repub@@ lican Party Committ@@ ees , Secret Service Committ@@ ees and the Wehr@@ bud@@ get@@ kom@@ mit@@ es , reports of great dis@@ content among Central Command Intelligence analysts who reported how superi@@ ors changed their ass@@ essments to American efforts in the fight against the Islamic State . &quot;
&quot; central Command , short Cen@@ com , is the military headquarters in T@@ amp@@ a , Florida , which controls American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia . &quot;
&quot; on @-@ site information obtained from high @-@ level Cent@@ Com com@@ man@@ ders , a more positive picture of American efforts against terrorism as it had allowed the actual conditions on the ground and were consistently positive as analyses of other intelligence services , &quot; a newspaper article cited the report . &quot;
&quot; what happened at Cent@@ Com is un@@ acceptable - our soldiers suffer when bad analyses are presented to our political leaders , &quot; &quot; presented Ken Cal@@ vert , repub@@ lican member of the House of Represent@@ atives . &quot;
the leadership mistakes in the Cent@@ Com range up to the top of the organization .
the ten @-@ page report shows detailed continual problems in the years 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of American efforts in the training of the Iraqi forces .
&quot; although there are no direct indications that government tips have given statements under Obama to change reports , it shows how analysts were exposed to the pressure from their superi@@ ors , an optim@@ istic picture of the threat of the Islamic State , also known as IS@@ IS or IS@@ IL . &quot;
&quot; during the first half of 2015 , many Central Command press releases , statements and statements prior to the congress were clearly more positive than the facts , &quot; concluded the report . &quot;
&quot; for example , a Cent@@ Com has publicly announced that a military re@@ conquest of Mos@@ sul@@ s could already commen@@ ce in April or May 2015 . &quot;
&quot; Mos@@ sul , the second largest city in Iraq , remains under the control of the Islamic State . &quot;
&quot; after months of investigation , so much is clear . &quot; &quot; said Mike Pom@@ pe@@ o , Repub@@ lican Congress of Con@@ gres@@ s@@ men from K@@ ans@@ as , in a statement . &quot;
&quot; from the middle of 2014 to the middle of 2015 , the leaders of Central Command changed the intelligence reports to play down the danger of IS@@ IS in Iraq . &quot;
&quot; the Repub@@ lic@@ ans called Task Force to live after them , that analysts were worried about the manipulation of reports to the Islamic State . &quot;
&quot; the report published on Thursday will be completed by more detailed information , while the investigation will be continued . &quot;
&quot; in addition , further investigations of the Cent@@ Com reports are underway through the General In@@ spec@@ tor of the Department of Defense . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , democratic members of the Intelligence Committee issued their own findings , which coinci@@ ded with some of the conclusions of the Repub@@ lican Task Force . &quot;
&quot; in 2014 and 2015 , Cent@@ Com created an excessive trial for the creation of intelligence ass@@ essments on IS@@ IL and Iraqi security services , &quot; announced the high @-@ level Dem@@ ok@@ rat in the committee , member of the House of Represent@@ atives , Adam B. Shi@@ p , in a statement . &quot;
&quot; this process , so Mr. Schiff , &quot; delayed the publication of intelligence reports , &quot; compens@@ ated the mor@@ als among analysts and &quot; gave too little space for devi@@ ating opinions . &quot;
but Mr. Shi@@ p and the Democrats gave no indication of a intervention of the White House at Cent@@ Com analysts with regard to a &quot; certain political opinion . &quot;
the preliminary results of the investigation of the Congress were published on Tuesday through &quot; The Daily Be@@ ast . &quot;
&quot; last August , the New York Times reported on investigations by the Pentagon General In@@ spec@@ tor , which were taken up by Cent@@ Com analysts . &quot;
&quot; C@@ m@@ dr@@ . Patrick Ev@@ ans , an Pentagon spokes@@ man , gave a statement that the Ministry of Defense would not comment on the Congress &apos;s reports while the investigations of the General Insp@@ ection Group are still under way . &quot;
&quot; but he also indicated that &quot; experts sometimes have diver@@ gent opinions regarding the interpretation of complex data , and that the intelligence services and the Ministry of Defense welcome a controversial discussion of these important issues of national defence . &quot;
the investigations have re@@ perc@@ ussions of the question of a successful aerial campaign under American leadership in Iraq and Syria ( an asser@@ tion that is now made by a growing number of members of the Ministry of Defense ) .
&quot; however , the alleg@@ ations of the past year have raised the question of how President Obama can rely on Central Command for honest ass@@ essments of military operations in Iraq , Afghanistan , Libya and other crisis regions . &quot;
&quot; the critic@@ isms of the secret information about the Islamic State are reminis@@ cent of divisions of more than ten years ago when a Cent@@ Com analy@@ st , Gregory Hoo@@ ker , wrote a piece about it , as the then government under George W. Bush looked at only a small cre@@ ws of occupation in Iraq and had little time to think about the consequences of the invasion of 2003 . &quot;
Mr. Hoo@@ ker also played a key role in the rebellion against the current coverage of the Islamic State .
&quot; last year , the team headed by Mr. Hoo@@ ker stated that contrary to the government &apos;s declar@@ ations of air strikes against the refin@@ eries held by the Islamic State , there would have been no significant impact on the financial situation of the terrorist group , as these provis@@ ional refin@@ eries had been put into operation to sell oil on the black market . &quot;
&quot; however , this knowledge was not published , the Times reported in September . &quot;
&quot; Cent@@ com@@ s dam@@ ned commander , Gen@@ . Lloyd J. Austin III , was critic@@ ised by members of the legislat@@ ure because of his over@@ ly positive assessment of the war situation at a hearing before the Senate . &quot;
general Austin went into retirement in April and was replaced with the Central Command by Gen@@ . Joseph L. V@@ otel .
&quot; the USA wins fourth match in the field ho@@ ckey of women , a show@@ down with Great Britain stands before &quot;
&quot; a day after having shot three gates during a 6 @-@ 1 victory over Japan , K@@ atie B@@ am made the first two gates for the American field ho@@ ckey team of women in a match on Thursday against India that the Americans won with 3 @-@ 0 . &quot;
&quot; five gates in two games should actually represent a worthy performance , but B@@ am ( 27 ) said it could not remember that ever done . &quot;
&quot; I have no idea . &quot; she said .
&quot; I am not among the men , who keep their gates in memory . &quot;
&quot; however , this does not know : the Americans are at 4 @-@ 0 in the Olympic competition and are in their group with the Brit@@ ons in the first place , which remain unbe@@ aten after their 2 @-@ 0 victory against Japan . &quot;
Britain and the United States will meet in the last game of the first round on Saturday .
&quot; both teams have already qualified for the quarter final , the game will decide which of the two teams will win the first and second place within their group of six teams . &quot;
&quot; first placed , the strong Dutch will take a little longer from the path that the other group will lead . &quot;
&quot; like always the game on Saturday , the Americans have triggered a surprising whir@@ l@@ wind through their success story , four years after they landed in the last London games in the last 12 places . &quot;
BA@@ M was part of this team .
&quot; she grew up in Blue Bell , Pennsylvania , and had the first time with a ho@@ ckey sleep@@ er in hands ( her two older sisters played the sport at Dre@@ xel University ) , with 16 years she became national player of the USA , the youngest in the history of the team . &quot;
she missed the Olympi@@ ad in 2008 as she could not qualify for the cad@@ re .
&quot; then came the year 2012 , in which for her and her team everything went wrong . &quot;
&quot; in the following year , Cra@@ ig Par@@ n@@ ham , an Englis@@ h@@ man , trainer of the national team and thus began to turn things better . &quot;
&quot; a change of culture , mental change and a bodily change , &quot; said B@@ am . &quot;
&quot; we did not have the work to work in London , which we now have . &quot;
we have completely s@@ nat@@ ched the ru@@ dder .
on Thursday evening B@@ am opened the tor@@ ches in the first half of the game with a back@@ lash out of the close @-@ up area .
&quot; India was without victory in the tournament in the game , but the team showed itself surprisingly tough and kept the game from 1 @-@ 0 to the third quarter until B@@ am took the game into their hands . &quot;
&quot; she carried out a Sprint with the flat ball on the left flan@@ k , then pulled into the middle and pushed the ball to the goal to give the American female a 2 @-@ 0 lead . &quot;
Mel@@ issa Gon@@ z@@ al@@ ez made the final goal in the middle of the last quarter .
&quot; the Sh@@ ut@@ out was the first of all the tournament for the ke@@ epers of the USA , Jack@@ ie Brig@@ gs , who had previously had to book a gate in each of the previous games . &quot;
she has a run .
just like B@@ am .
&quot; we are in a good position , &quot; said Par@@ n@@ ham , but how well will depend on the outcome of the next game on Saturday . &quot;
&quot; amid the rank@@ ings of the Olympic Games , the Zen of the trampoline &quot;
&quot; wherever you are , how late it is , it &apos;s the Olympic Games . &quot;
&quot; the events in Rio de Janeiro feel constant and inevitable , a fast @-@ pac@@ ed relay race between competition and aspir@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; it is as if the olymp@@ ic tor@@ ch itself is a burning rod , which is passed from the w@@ rist@@ band to the swi@@ mmer to the gymn@@ ast to the tri@@ ath@@ l@@ ete . &quot;
&quot; you can &apos;t switch on TV , read a newspaper or listen to your neighbor &apos;s conversation in the queu@@ e in the queu@@ e , without hearing about Simone Bil@@ es , K@@ atie Le@@ verk@@ y or the dispute between Michael P@@ helps and C@@ had le C@@ los . &quot;
and then there is still Log@@ an Do@@ ol@@ ey .
&quot; Do@@ ol@@ ey , who for the first time playing with the Olympic Games and a women &apos;s black with dim@@ ples , could have been among these well @-@ known names that would be broadcast to Prime Time , if he would be a swi@@ mmer , gymn@@ ast or even f@@ encer . &quot;
&quot; but Do@@ ol@@ ey , 28 , from Lake Forest , California , fights for gold in the Olympic trampoline . &quot;
the Olympic flame does not illumin@@ ate any event whatsoever .
&quot; further from the center , partly in the shadow are the sports which are not generally accepted : air pist@@ ols , ar@@ chery , bad@@ min@@ ton , Ta@@ ek@@ won@@ do . &quot;
we will always have the breast@@ stroke and may there be a long time .
&quot; but if I should make modest arguments for my particular dar@@ ling , then let me draw attention to the discre@@ et charm of the trampoline . &quot;
&quot; although the trampoline jumping has been an Olympic event since 2000 , when it had its debut in Sydney , the last 16 years it was so spar@@ sely perceived that many of the ones I had questioned , did not know that it is an olymp@@ ic port at all . &quot;
this could also be regional ignorance .
&quot; although the USA sent athletes to competition , it has never won a medal in the trampoline jumping and had an ath@@ l@@ ete until 2012 , who made it to the final round . &quot;
the Chinese and Russians tend to share prices for the men and the Chinese and Canadi@@ ans for women .
D@@ ong D@@ ong from China and Ro@@ sie Mac@@ L@@ enn@@ an from Canada will defend their Gold Med@@ al from London this year .
&quot; the trampoline jumping has a certain amount of out@@ si@@ ders , partly because it sounds suitable for the un@@ enlighten@@ ed ear suitable for a c@@ low@@ ns school than the one for the Olympic Games . &quot;
&quot; at this point I should admit that I &apos;m not an expert , but only an earth@@ bound enthusi@@ ast . &quot;
&quot; it has hum@@ or@@ istic potential - the car@@ to@@ on@@ ous trem@@ bling of his never @-@ ending up@@ lift - but also the grace of gymn@@ as@@ tics and diving , the two kinds of sports , which are essentially united . &quot;
&quot; the word &quot; &quot; trampoline &quot; &quot; comes from the span@@ ish El trampoline , which means as much as &quot; spring@@ board . &quot; &quot;
&quot; emerging vic@@ tors jump on a gigantic trampoline , shoot almost up to 30 feet in the air and need a number of falling movements ( turning , real and sal@@ tos ) before they land on the feet . &quot;
&quot; according to official Olympi@@ apro@@ gram , they are evaluated according to execution , difficulty and &quot; &quot; flight time &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; thirty @-@ two athletes from 17 countries , 16 men and 16 women , will compete against each other in Rio . &quot;
the common Olympic v@@ ector is straight ahead .
&quot; in their quest for gold they need to go far@@ ther , faster , upwards and over , sometimes down to the finish , sometimes back and down , upwards and down@@ wards on the playground . &quot;
&quot; they do not only hunt the finish line or the initial wall , but also another mo@@ ist destination in television transmission : the world &apos;s or the Olympi@@ ad . &quot;
&quot; the goal @-@ directed pursuit is no@@ bel , admir@@ able , even fan@@ atic - and it is enough to stir even a spect@@ ator into tears . &quot;
but it is also what I think of watching these games as something exhau@@ sting .
&quot; of these , the trampoline offers a breath@@ break . &quot;
the v@@ ector of the trampoline is above .
a forward motion is not the goal .
&quot; he or she boun@@ ces off , apparently wei@@ ght@@ lessly like an a@@ stron@@ aut , goes up , then down@@ wards , then effort@@ lessly back up . &quot;
&quot; there is also competition here , of course not without difficulty , but during the exercise there is no hec@@ tic attack on the goal , no wol@@ ves in the distance , only the dre@@ amy , elegant ab@@ olition of time and gravity . &quot;
it is as Zen as the competition can only be for the Olympic Games .
&quot; the qualifying and final hours of women will take place on Friday afternoon , in streaming by 13.00 Eastern Time ; the men on Saturday , also at 13.00 . &quot;
N@@ BC will radi@@ ate the final rounds as part of an afternoon block on both days from 14.00 .
&quot; in the middle of the Olympia @-@ Man@@ ia they promise a quiet , nice moment , one , probably over@@ looked in the general tur@@ mo@@ il . &quot;
&quot; if the increase of consciousness can only be achieved through the att@@ ach@@ work and the objective of male ath@@ l@@ ete - as the male US @-@ Tur@@ ner proposed recently - according to The Wall Street Journal recently , Mr. Do@@ ol@@ ey awaits his new fan community according to the air . &quot;

&quot; over the past ten years , it was one of Africa &apos;s most stable countries , a solid ally of the West with a rapidly growing economy . &quot;

last week thousands of people rus@@ hed to the streets and demanded fundamental political changes .
&quot; according to human rights organizations , the response of the government was not mer@@ ciful . &quot;

&quot; in circulation , videos about the protests , probably from the last or the beginning of this year , show how security people beat young people with sticks , while they were forced to make a stand against a wall . &quot;
the chief of the UN authority for human rights now calls for an in @-@ depth investigation .
&quot; it has always been difficult to keep this country together and in the future it will become even more difficult , &quot; said Ras@@ hid Ab@@ di , the project leader of the Horn of Africa of the International Crisis Group , a research group . &quot;
&quot; according to Nigeria , Ethiopia is the most popul@@ ous country in Africa and its stability is valued by the West . &quot;
&quot; American military and intelligence services work closely with the Ethiop@@ ians to fight terrorism across the region , especially in Somalia . only a few countries in Africa , if at all , get so much Western help . &quot;
Ethiopia &apos;s economy expanded at a considerable pace .
its infrastructure has improved dras@@ tically - there is a new commu@@ te in the capital Ad@@ dis A@@ be@@ ba .
&quot; the streets are usually quiet , safe and clean . &quot;
&quot; even though Ethiopia was anything but a model for democracy - human rights organisations have continuously led the repression by the government - the opposition in the country has been restricted , whereby dissi@@ dents were effectively sil@@ enced . &quot;
&quot; many were sent to exile or prison , killed or driven into the wilderness of the desert . &quot;
but that could change .
&quot; if you supp@@ ress people and do not have any other options except prot@@ esting , it breaks out , &quot; said Se@@ you@@ m Tes@@ Home , a lectur@@ er in Central Ethiopia . &quot;
the whole youth protests .
a generation prot@@ ested .
there are numerous complaints that cover everything from land use to stran@@ gle@@ hold regarding the power of the ruling coalition .
&quot; after a far critic@@ ised election last year , the ruling party and its allies received the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 percent of Parliament . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , tensions along the border to Er@@ it@@ rea rise ; a struggle for this jag@@ ged , controversial line demanded hundreds of lives in June . &quot;
&quot; analysts fear that separ@@ ati@@ sts like the Oro@@ mo Liberation Front or the National Liberation Front of the O@@ g@@ aden , which have been forced more or less in recent years , could use the tur@@ mo@@ il and arm themselves again . &quot;
several factors explain why feelings of bit@@ tern@@ ess after years of which H@@ ink@@ ö@@ chel@@ n explo@@ de under the surface now explo@@ de .
the first seems harmless : smartphones .
&quot; in recent years , many Ethiop@@ ians have been able to communicate with the social media because cheaper smartphone has become more and more frequent and the internet services improved . &quot;
&quot; even if the government blocked access to Facebook and Twitter what they do at regular intervals , especially in protests , many people still can communicate via internet pro@@ x@@ ies hiding where they stay . &quot;
several young Ethiop@@ ians admit that they were so called protests .
&quot; the second factor is that there is more solidarity between the Oro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as , the two largest ethnic groups in Ethiopia . &quot;
the Oro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as are not natural enemies .
&quot; since e@@ ons prosp@@ ered the Am@@ har@@ as , who come from eth@@ op@@ ia mainly Christian high @-@ countries , in politics and economy , while they exploited the Oro@@ mos , of which many Muslims are and live in flat land areas . &quot;
but this also changes .
&quot; we are to co @-@ ordin@@ ate under a screen , &quot; &quot; said Mul@@ atu Mi@@ ech@@ u , a leader of the Oro@@ mos . &quot;
the greatest protests took place in areas of Am@@ har@@ a and Oro@@ mos .
&quot; many Am@@ har@@ as and Oro@@ mos have the feeling that Ethiopia is margin@@ ally dominated by members of the ethnic group of the Tig@@ ray who constitute around 6 percent of the population and are dominant in military , intelligence services , trade and politics . &quot;
the third reason for the un@@ rest is the death of Mel@@ es Zen@@ awi .
&quot; Mr. Mel@@ es , a former rebel leader , was until his death on a non @-@ pub@@ li@@ ci@@ zed disease in 2012 for 17 years in Ethiopia &apos;s prime minister . &quot;
&quot; he was regarded as tac@@ tical genius , a man who could think around corners . &quot;
analysts say that he was particularly well vers@@ ed in perc@@ ei@@ ving early signs of dis@@ content and to use Special Represent@@ atives to process opponents and make them harmless .
&quot; the current regime is lacking in this fundamental skill , &quot; &quot; said Mr Ab@@ di , a conflict analy@@ st . &quot;
&quot; Ethiopia &apos;s new Prime Minister , H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am Des@@ al@@ eg@@ n , was chosen for relatively in@@ transparent reasons to take the position of Mr. Mel@@ es . &quot;
&quot; unlike Mr. Mel@@ es , who came from the Tig@@ ray region of Northern Ethiopia , Mr. H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am comes from the South . &quot;
analysts say that he is not enjoying the confidence of the security services controlled by the Tig@@ ray .
many fear that the result will be more blood@@ shed .
&quot; the last time Ethiopia experienced such an uph@@ eav@@ al in 2005 , after thousands of elections prot@@ esting , according to analysts apparently dec@@ ou@@ ted by the government and subsequently stolen . &quot;
&quot; during the following raid , many prot@@ esters were killed , even though it was less than in the last months and this time of un@@ rest went relatively quickly . &quot;
&quot; Ethiop@@ ian leaders praised Ethiop@@ ian leaders for their vision@@ ary infrastructure planning , as the new comm@@ uter train , as well as for their meas@@ urable progress in poverty alle@@ vi@@ ation . &quot;
but obviously this does not prevent the intensi@@ fication of the internal mis@@ art of the Ethiop@@ ian government .
and it takes a dangerous ethnic form .
&quot; last month prot@@ esters in Gon@@ dar , an am@@ har@@ ian town , of Tig@@ ray managed businesses and the hatred towards the Tig@@ ray becomes more and more common in the social media . &quot;
analysts say that the protests in the US and other western allies bring in a peculiar position .
&quot; the American government used Ethiopia as a base for d@@ ron@@ en@@ ou@@ ghs over the neighboring Somalia , even though it recently informed that it has closed this base . &quot;
&quot; while the West clearly wants to support democracy , it does not want its ally to collapse in an already volati@@ le region . &quot;
&quot; this , &quot; &quot; said Mr Ab@@ di , &quot; &quot; is a very thin gra@@ dient . &quot;
Donald Tr@@ ump explains his statement Obama has been established IS@@ IS &apos; sar@@ cas@@ m &apos;
&quot; on Friday , Donald J. Tr@@ ump was trying to sc@@ atter the last contro@@ versy surrounding his campaign by att@@ acking his multiple repeated asser@@ tion , President Obama and Hill@@ ary Clinton would be the &quot; founder &quot; of the terrorist group Islamic State , not serious . &quot;
this clari@@ fication gave new questions about the communication skills of the Repub@@ lican presidential candidate to be able to communicate clearly and comprehen@@ sively with the American public .
&quot; it also ent@@ ails his comrades who endeav@@ our to take care of him during an event@@ ful phase in order to explain the peculiar position , statements that he could not have meant at all . &quot;
&quot; after having made the suggestion during a campaign event on Wednesday evening , Mr. Tr@@ ump was back on Thursday and insi@@ sted that he really did not intend to interpret the President and Mrs. Clinton would have created IS@@ IS . &quot;
&quot; but in an early morning twe@@ et on Friday Mr. Tr@@ ump said , he was simply sar@@ c@@ astic . &quot;
&quot; the twe@@ et was the contrast to the previous day , where Mr. Tr@@ ump said in a series of interviews , he said the alleg@@ ation was completely serious . &quot;
&quot; when the conservative Radi@@ om@@ or@@ ator Hu@@ gh He@@ wit@@ t wanted to help Mr. Tr@@ ump to we@@ aken the statement , he reminded him that Mr. Obama wanted to destroy IS@@ IS , the Repub@@ lican candidate didn &apos;t want to know about it . &quot;
&quot; the last storm of criticism pr@@ as@@ sel@@ t down on Mr. Tr@@ ump , while trying to direct the focus of his campaign to the economic situation due to falling demand . &quot;
Mr. Tr@@ ump and Mrs. Clinton kept talking about the economic situation in Michigan this week .
on Friday Mr. Tr@@ ump trying to return to this subject again .
&quot; on Twitter , he warned that Mrs. Clin@@ tons would have suggestions for higher taxes and that he found her speech boring . &quot;
Mr. Tr@@ ump has already brought sar@@ cas@@ m to his defense .
&quot; at the end of July he drew strong criticism , when he said the Russians should h@@ ack Mrs. Clin@@ tons &apos;s emails , but later he explained &quot; Of course I thought the sar@@ c@@ astic . &quot; &quot;
this method allows Mr. Tr@@ ump to shift the linguistic boundaries in politics and then call back on demand .
&quot; I think it &apos;s one of his methods to test how certain messages are recorded by his fans as they arrive , and then &quot; clarify &quot; depending on how the reaction falls . &quot; &quot; said Ruth Sher@@ man , a communication expert who ob@@ serves the language of both candidates . &quot;
&quot; but I think he &apos;s clever enough to keep his statements vag@@ ue enough , so that they can be interpreted in different ways . &quot;
&quot; instead of def@@ aul@@ ting the tone for the presidential elections , Mr. Tr@@ ump has adopted an even more et@@ ched sound because his survey values have gone further . &quot;
&quot; a new survey conducted by N@@ BC / Wall Street Journal / Mar@@ ist published on Friday showed a great lead in North Carolina , Virginia , Colorado , and a head @-@ to @-@ head race in Florida . &quot;
&quot; while Mr. Tr@@ ump is generally trying to ap@@ ologi@@ ze for his pro@@ voc@@ ative statements , he often accused his critics to dist@@ ort his statements or mis@@ understand his humor . &quot;
&quot; but while strengthening the focus of attention in recent months of his presidential campaign , Mr. Tr@@ umps Scher@@ ze have brought his loyal comrades into the uncomfortable situation , regardless of how pro@@ voc@@ ative his statements might be . &quot;
&quot; Rudol@@ ph W. Giuli@@ ani , former Mayor of New York and one of Tr@@ umps &apos;s most prominent spokes@@ men , gave himself great effort to defend the candidate today in a CN@@ N interview from Thursday . &quot;
&quot; I believe what he says are legitimate , political comment@@ aries , &quot; said Mr. Giuli@@ ani to the correctness of Mr. Tr@@ umps &apos;s statements whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had established the Islamic State . &quot;
&quot; it is true in this sense that before Obama was an almost unknown , small organization , he called them Hin@@ du@@ sts , completely false , and therefore it happened because he with@@ drew troops from Iraq . &quot;
&quot; most mainstream Repub@@ lic@@ ans are trying to argue that the government under Obama , in which Mrs. Clinton served as an Foreign Minister , allowed IS@@ IS to expand by forcing the situation in the Middle East aggres@@ sively under control . &quot;
&quot; before the election events in Pennsylvania on Friday , Mr. Tr@@ ump continued his attacks on the media and accused them of running around on any of his words and to be taken against him . &quot;
&quot; he ridi@@ cul@@ ed the poor , e@@ un@@ u@@ chs &quot; TV experts who try to understand him and said , &quot; You cannot ! . &quot; &quot;
some of the democr@@ ats sne@@ er at Mr. Tr@@ umps excuse as only a further proof that he was un@@ suitable for the presidential office .
&quot; once crossed over the price of the market , Café in Green@@ point &quot;
&quot; Ver@@ b Cafe was a trendy cafe in Willi@@ am@@ sburg , where you could only pay cash , which had no Wi @-@ Fi , but served for 15 years of good coffee . &quot;
&quot; of course , the prices were pushed out of his Bed@@ ford Avenue store . &quot;
&quot; the business of So@@ ap Ch@@ erie , which replaced Ver@@ b in the summer of 2014 , sells soap in the form of cup@@ cakes . &quot;
local people mour@@ ned it as the last loss in a gent@@ ri@@ fying city .
&quot; the artist Mol@@ ly Cr@@ ab@@ apple wrote on Twitter , &quot; I know , New York is change , but I still can &apos;t believe that CB@@ GB is dead , the Chelsea Hotel apart and Ver@@ b is now a soap business . &quot;
&quot; but if New York is change , then it is also new invention . &quot;
&quot; a revi@@ ved Ver@@ b Cafe opened last November in Green@@ point , less than a mile north of its original location . &quot;
&quot; the new verb has Wi @-@ Fi and accepts credit cards , but still has some of the same staff and a similarly simple atmosphere . &quot;
the coffee is still good .
&quot; the new owner of Ver@@ b is Cisco Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , a long @-@ time employee of the old coffee shop , the owner and managing director of the new coffee shop . &quot;
he began working at Ver@@ b in 2001 and remained there until the end .
&quot; when a customer asked him to provide money for a new office , he was excited to do it , he said . &quot;
&quot; Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , 36 , kept a lot . &quot;
Ver@@ b uses the same distributor for the bag@@ els bought the same es@@ pres@@ so machine .
it even uses the same lamps from the old Ver@@ b .
but Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said that he also wanted to experiment .
he introduced new ingredients .
on the menu there are sand@@ wiches with b@@ acon and cheese and there are gar@@ nis@@ hing like cap@@ ers and sau@@ ted onions .
there are natural tears .
&quot; the café does not serve beer anymore , but there are fresh ju@@ ices . &quot;
&quot; after nine months , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez stated that he noticed a constant stream of old regular customers . &quot;
&quot; many old customers were also displac@@ ed by Willi@@ am@@ sburg prices , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; recently , on a Sunday Rebecca Oli@@ v@@ eira was such a customer . &quot;
&quot; Oli@@ v@@ eira , 34 , lived in Willi@@ am@@ sburg and visited Ver@@ b regularly . &quot;
&quot; even after she moved to Green@@ point , she would take the way . &quot;
&quot; after the verb was closed , she gave a while the coffee bean , she said . &quot;
&quot; it became clear to me that there was coffee and culture in the verb which I liked , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; now she drinks coffee again , even if she ordered a bl@@ ended Cha@@ i Tea this day instead of her usual iced coffee , which is another new addition . &quot;
&quot; since the beginning of the verb in 2003 , Tom Ros@@ enthal has been another long @-@ standing and loyal customer . &quot;
he went there before the work and in@@ vari@@ ably ordered the same .
&quot; I came to seven , every day , like a Swiss pocket watch and they prepare my Every@@ thing b@@ agel with butter , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; photo Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said , he wanted to experiment and add new ingredients to the menu . &quot;
&quot; today Ros@@ enthal still gets his usual order , but sometimes he changes his Every@@ thing b@@ agel with b@@ acon , egg and cheese . &quot;
Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he has no gru@@ dge about it that the soap business has taken the old business room .
&quot; in fact , the owners of the So@@ ap Ch@@ erie offered a special soap for verb with the cold @-@ bre@@ wed coffee of the coffee shop as an ingredient . &quot;
&quot; I think we will go into her offer , &quot; &quot; said Rodri@@ gu@@ ez . &quot;
&quot; and the traditional , Polish inhabitants of Green@@ points have also accepted the café . &quot;
&quot; a new customer has translated the menu into Polish and Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he has prepared to exhibit her soon , so that his new neighbours feel welcome . &quot;
the location also has further advantages .
a local juice local wants to fill and sell the cold @-@ bre@@ wed coffee into bottles .
there is a chance that the café expands to a neighboring building .
a new verb is enough for many customers to get their old favor@@ ites .
Joseph W@@ itt was a regular customer and said he was destroyed by the ground when the café closed .
&quot; when the new cafe opened , Wh@@ itt said that the entering of the Lok@@ als and the Order felt a new coffee like a hom@@ ec@@ oming . &quot;
&quot; I had to smell it , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
the de@@ pressing food of the economic crisis in &quot; a plenti@@ ful meal &quot;
&quot; in March 1933 , shortly after his rise to the President , Fran@@ klin Del@@ ano Roos@@ ev@@ elt took his lunch at the O@@ val Office . &quot;
&quot; as a g@@ our@@ mets , President Roos@@ ev@@ elt had a Fai@@ ble for refined delic@@ acies of Fi@@ fth Avenue , like P@@ â@@ te de fo@@ ie gr@@ as and Maryland water tur@@ tle soup . &quot;
&quot; his menu on that day was slightly more modest : stuff@@ ed eggs in tomato sauce , mas@@ hed potatoes and as dessert a pl@@ um pu@@ dding . &quot;
&quot; it was an act of culinary solidarity with suffering people , &quot; &quot; said Jane G@@ egel@@ man . &quot;
&quot; her husband Andrew Co@@ e added , &quot; It was also a message to the Americans as they should eat . &quot;
the couple lives in Brooklyn Heights and are both food historians .
&quot; CO@@ Es &apos;s last book &quot; &quot; C@@ hop su@@ ey &quot; &quot; acted by Chinese cuisine in the United States , while Zi@@ egel@@ man told in her book &quot; 97 Orch@@ ard &quot; about life in a residential house at the Lower East Side of the food perspective . &quot;
&quot; their latest collaboration , &quot; A decent meal , &quot; which will appear on Tuesday at Har@@ per Verlag , illustrates the history of American cuisine during the Great Depression . &quot;
&quot; they showed culinary solidarity , when they meet with a rep@@ orter in the Eis@@ enberg &apos;s Sand@@ wich shop for dinner , a small , tasty snack at the Fl@@ ati@@ ron District , which has been in business since the stock market crash in 1929 . &quot;
&quot; brick , 54 , ordered a cream cheese sand@@ wich with olive pieces , while Co@@ e , 57 , tur@@ key with mas@@ hed potatoes and vegetable mixture . &quot;
&quot; when the rep@@ orter ordered h@@ acking , this found the couple for a discussion about food in the era of Great Depression . &quot;
&quot; rich foods were very popular , &quot; said Zi@@ egel@@ man . &quot;
&quot; there were pe@@ an@@ uts , Leb@@ erk@@ ä@@ se and Bohn@@ enb@@ rot . &quot;
&quot; they were made from an ingredient and a little cheaper , which stretches the ingredient . &quot;
imagine eating as many pe@@ an@@ uts that they serve them as dinner .
CO@@ E gr@@ inn@@ ed .
&quot; it has to have lain in the stomach like lead , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; in the years before the Great Depression was the table in an American household , especially in rural areas , an all @-@ you @-@ can @-@ buffet . &quot;
&quot; cre@@ ws of women cooked for male field cakes and it was served freshly baked pasta for breakfast , lunch and dinner . &quot;
&quot; it was the Americans who sent food to star@@ ving Europeans during the First World War . &quot; &quot; a Square Me@@ al &quot; &quot; draws the paths that the country enc@@ ir@@ cl@@ ed with it , not to be the land aff@@ ine . &quot;
&quot; it was a time when eating for the Americans was a central , ten@@ se topic , &quot; &quot; said Co@@ e , why he and his wife wanted to write about it . &quot;
&quot; the new bud@@ get@@ ary was just as ten@@ se : mysterious food such as bre@@ ads and c@@ asser@@ ies became stap@@ le food , the c@@ asser@@ ole as a &quot; wonderful way of re@@ alizing food resi@@ du@@ es , &quot; said Zi@@ egel@@ man , because coo@@ ks could hide un@@ appe@@ tiz@@ ing ingredients under a cre@@ amy sauce . &quot;
fresh fruit was replaced by cheap dried fruit .
&quot; meat , which was the focal point of the American kitchen for many years , became a rarely ser@@ vers@@ ed luxury . &quot;
&quot; strange mi@@ xes have been tried , because a rich and nutri@@ tious satisfaction had priority to taste or even healthy cooking . &quot;
&quot; during their research for the book , which also includes recipes , Zi@@ egel@@ man prepared a dish from this epoch , baked onions with pe@@ an@@ ut butter . &quot;
&quot; it was not a popular addition at lunch , &quot; says Co@@ e . &quot;
Zi@@ egel@@ mann continues : &quot; it was sur@@ real . &quot;
pe@@ an@@ ut butter and baked onions do not match each other .
it was typical for many of the family recipes .
&quot; as never before or since , household business@@ men - including Louise Stan@@ ley , head of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics from 1923 to 1943 - the eating habits of the country der@@ h@@ ly . &quot;
&quot; as they published recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines , they encouraged women to become &quot; household politicians &quot; and the challenge to transform Pamp@@ e like cre@@ amy sp@@ aghetti with car@@ rots into delicious meals . &quot;
&quot; a Square Me@@ al &quot; is a festival of historical delic@@ acies .
&quot; in particular , the reports on the response of the government to the hungry citizens , like President Herbert Hoo@@ vers L@@ ass @-@ me @-@ Cake @-@ Eating @-@ attitude . &quot;
&quot; while he publicly praised the simple I@@ owa peasant cuisine of his kitchen , he spoke as the milli@@ on@@ stroke man of the world he has become . &quot;
&quot; he liked continental cooking like fish with cu@@ cum@@ ber sauce , &quot; said Co@@ e . &quot;
he ate in an almost gil@@ ded dining room and wore a tu@@ x@@ edo .
he was wonderfully alien .
&quot; President Roos@@ ev@@ elt might have committed the same mistake , if his wife Ele@@ an@@ or asked him to re@@ mark a post@@ mark with his stomach . &quot;
&quot; as described in the book , the residents of a house@@ keeper spoke with no interest in flavors by Mrs. Roos@@ ev@@ elt that the White House produced the most boring food in Washington , but also one of the most controversial . &quot;
&quot; many of the species from the era of Great Depression , dealing with food , was disc@@ ar@@ ded once the country came back to the legs . &quot;
&quot; the legacy is on our continued focus on calories and food , said Zi@@ egel@@ man , as well as on how science was applied to food . &quot;
&quot; the couple gave a better understanding of the eating habits of Zi@@ egel@@ man &apos;s mother @-@ in @-@ law , for example , how they could not throw away food . &quot;
&quot; she had a real fear of wast@@ ing food , &quot; said Co@@ e . &quot;
&quot; Zi@@ egel@@ man remembered , &quot; She actually made people sick . &quot;
there was the incident of the wind .
&quot; after the dishes were cleared at Eis@@ enberg &apos;s , they and co@@ e produced a dessert that they had prepared at home : the pl@@ um dessert , that President Roos@@ ev@@ elt had lunch . &quot;
&quot; it is called Pr@@ une W@@ hip , &quot; &quot; said Zi@@ egel@@ man and added that it was a nasty trick , humble recipes to give a chic name . &quot;
&quot; there was no whi@@ pped cream , only pl@@ ums , some flour , sugar , water and cinnamon . &quot;
&quot; everybody di@@ pped something rel@@ u@@ ct@@ antly a spo@@ on in the tough , brown gli@@ b@@ bers . &quot;
&quot; surprisingly , it was not bad . &quot;
CO@@ E repeated three times a night .
&quot; as a Can @-@ Do @-@ Bud@@ ge@@ tier@@ er , he said to his wife , &quot; &quot; A few chopped wal@@ nuts would help . &quot;
killed in bom@@ bing attack : he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo
he put his own life on the game to help others : Khal@@ ed O@@ mar .
he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo : Khal@@ ed O@@ mar devoted his life to the people of Syria .
he ris@@ ked everything to save others .
&quot; now , the 30 @-@ year @-@ old has died in a bom@@ bing attack of the Assad regime . &quot;
&quot; O@@ mar was a member of &quot; White Helm@@ ets , &quot; a civil defence group , which has saved the lives of nearly 60,000 people according to the Bild @-@ Zeitung . &quot;
29@@ 00 volunteers put their own life on the game to draw people from bom@@ bed houses and to make first aid in the war zone .
they are the heroes of the war in Syria .
&quot; O@@ mar was the group &apos;s face : a video of the civil defence , showing him in a 11 @-@ hour rescue of a baby from the rub@@ ble of a house , went around the world in 2014 . &quot;
it made the Syri@@ ans a g@@ lowing symbol in the horror of the war .
&quot; but as a hero , he has never seen himself , said according to the picture : &quot; &quot; for me this is the real ji@@ had . &quot;
&quot; when I die , save life , I think God sees a mart@@ yr in me . &quot;
&quot; shortly before O@@ mar himself fell victim to an attack , he had spoken in a video about the last bom@@ b@@ ings in Syria . &quot;
&quot; the helicop@@ ters have dropped out of four bom@@ b@@ ings over the Alz@@ adia district , one was filled with chlor@@ ine gas . &quot;
&quot; a woman and two children died , seven people suffer from breathing . &quot;
&quot; we now eliminate the poison@@ ous remn@@ ants of the bomb , so that no children play with it , &quot; the picture quotes his last words before he died . &quot;
the deadly bomb of the Assad regime had to make terrorists .
Greenland shar@@ k : the oldest cycl@@ one is almost 400 years old
rare sight .
Greenland shar@@ ks usually only come to the surface in winter .
this shar@@ k was allowed to go back to the sea after an investigation on board the research vessel S@@ anna .
he was born in 16@@ 24 and flo@@ ats with a good 1 km / h through the North Atlantic - to the present day .
Greenland shar@@ ks only get up to 150 years of offspring .
&quot; as a matter of fact , the Greenland shar@@ k flo@@ ats along the North Atlantic , in an hour it reaches an average of just 1,@@ 220 metres . &quot;
&quot; only when it arrives , the five @-@ metre @-@ long animal acceler@@ ates at a s@@ atin 2,6 km / h - and is half as fast as a seal with this top speed . &quot;
&quot; this lifestyle influenced by slow@@ ness , however , seems to be a patent for a high age . &quot;
&quot; Julius Niel@@ sen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues reported in the journal &quot; Science &quot; at any rate from a Greenland shar@@ k , who might be 392 years old . &quot;
&quot; ma@@ dness , &quot; commented Alexander Sch@@ euer@@ lein from the Max @-@ Planck @-@ Institute for demographic research in Rostock this life span , which means a world record for vert@@ eb@@ rates . &quot;
&quot; indeed , the evolution@@ ary bi@@ ologist suspected that Greenland shar@@ ks become stone @-@ old . &quot;
only lack@@ ed the evidence .
&quot; Greenland shar@@ ks are difficult to observe , finally they live mainly in the polar sea in front of the spar@@ sely populated co@@ asts of Canada , Greenland , Norway and S@@ val@@ bard . &quot;
&quot; because they prefer water temperatures around the six degrees Celsius , they usually appear only in winter at the surface . &quot;
researchers know correspon@@ d@@ ingly little about the lifestyle of Greenland shar@@ ks .
&quot; their slow @-@ ben@@ ds , as they stood before Sp@@ it@@ s@@ bergen six animals with a transmitter . &quot;
&quot; the loo@@ t still make this shar@@ k : in the stomach of an animal , researchers found the remains of a seal , another had swal@@ lowed the j@@ aw@@ bone of a young polar bear . &quot;
possibly they hunt sleeping animals or pat@@ rou@@ il@@ ate at the bottom of the ice sea and seek Kad@@ aver that tor@@ ches from higher water layers down to the bottom .
&quot; Julius Niel@@ sen and his colleagues now examined 28 Greenland shar@@ ks , who took fishermen between 2010 and 2013 in front of Greenland or S@@ val@@ bard as by@@ catch from the depth of the North Atlantic . &quot;
&quot; the smallest shar@@ k was just 81 centimet@@ ers long , while the greatest 502 cm measured . &quot;
&quot; to determine the age of the animals , they analyzed the len@@ tic@@ ular nucle@@ us of shar@@ ks with the carbon @-@ 14 method . &quot;
&quot; this center of the eye lens is created before the birth of shar@@ ks , the proteins contained therein will no longer be renewed . &quot;
the two smallest shar@@ ks had notably much carbon @-@ 14 in the lin@@ ker @-@ core .
&quot; their birth should therefore lie after the early 1960s , as a nuclear weapon seeking larger amounts of this radio@@ active carbon into the atmosphere . &quot;
&quot; in the third animal with 220 centimet@@ res of length , the l@@ enti@@ l det@@ ects a small surplus of carbon @-@ 14 from the nuclear weapons , it is likely to celebrate its 50@@ th birthday in its investigation in 2012 . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , all larger Greenland shar@@ ks had normal carbon @-@ 14 amounts in their enti@@ re@@ ty , which is created by cosmic rays in the atmosphere . &quot;
&quot; in fact , the Carbon @-@ 14 watch for a 493 centimet@@ re long Gr@@ ön@@ land@@ hai showed an age of 335 years , while the record shar@@ k with 502 centimet@@ ers might even be 392 years old . &quot;
&quot; that Greenland @-@ shar@@ k females get offspring only when they are longer than four meters , was known . &quot;
&quot; now , the researchers were able to assign an age to their length . &quot;
&quot; as one of the animals with 392 centimet@@ res probably stood on the threshold of the sex@@ ually mature age and its age was determined by 156 years , Greenland shar@@ ks with multip@@ lication are obviously at least one and a half centuries of time . &quot;
this is likely to be a world record for vert@@ eb@@ rates at the moment .
&quot; that such meth@@ us@@ al@@ em@@ es live mainly in icy waters , is no coinci@@ dence . &quot;
&quot; the previous record holder , a 211 year old Gr@@ ön@@ land@@ w@@ al , in whose b@@ acon at the neck stuck a 120 @-@ year @-@ old har@@ poon , was caught in front of Alaska . &quot;
&quot; due to the low temperatures , the organism of the animals lives there on as@@ par@@ agus . &quot;
so they mature later - and al@@ der slower .
&quot; in order to keep warm in cold water , the animals are often very large . &quot;
&quot; the volume grows much faster than its surface , through which the animal gets heat . &quot;
the heat loss of a gram mouse is therefore much bigger than with a gram of elephant .
another advantage : you have less enemies .
&quot; a smaller animal therefore lives more dangerous and should concentrate on having as many offspring as possible as possible , &quot; explains the evolution@@ ary bi@@ ologist Sch@@ euer@@ lein . &quot;
&quot; a very large animal , on the other hand , should invest its resources in a long life . &quot;
building plot in a double pack
&quot; with topics relating to construction , the council at the most recent meeting has focuss@@ ed on the main focus of the meeting . &quot;
&quot; with relief , the committee adopted the notification of Mayor Robert P@@ utz , that &quot; finally the marketing of the recently designated residential buildings can begin . &quot;
&quot; after the plot , plot and replacement questions were clari@@ fied and the applications could be put on sur@@ veying , the sale of land plots in the residential areas &quot; &quot; Straß@@ l@@ weg &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; Schön@@ au @-@ West &quot; &quot; ( section 1 ) is nothing more in the way to prospective buyers . &quot;
the municipal council is convinced that the construction plans in the rural and quiet residential community Schön@@ au attract young families and former sen@@ iors alike .
&quot; as it was said , bau@@ bles can be reported immediately at the Town Hall , on the awar@@ ding of the par@@ c@@ els , the municipal council is expected to advise in its September session . &quot;
&quot; in order to also en@@ force requests for the establishment of other industrial enterprises , connected with the creation of jobs , the municipal council decided to change the order plan newly created in the spring of this year . &quot;
&quot; in the area of Unter@@ zeit@@ lar@@ n , the park area has been extended by two plots in the direction of state road 21@@ 12 . &quot;
Frankfurt benefits from Bre@@ x@@ it
&quot; thus , the city of the Main has the best chance to attract more jobs and companies from London in the competition with Paris , Dublin and Luxembourg . &quot;
&quot; it is highly likely that Frankfurt will benefit most from the Bre@@ x@@ it V@@ ot@@ um , &quot; says Michael Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder , head of the Core Bank &apos;s financial markets and real estate markets . &quot;
&quot; according to the Bre@@ x@@ it referendum , it is uncertain whether Gel@@ dh@@ äuser should continue to operate from London from financial transactions across the EU . &quot;
&quot; so far , for the so @-@ called EU passport , it is enough for them to be admitted to the UK . &quot;
these are currently using large US banks .
several banks have already announced to shift jobs .
&quot; the lob@@ b@@ ying association &quot; Frankfurt Main Finance &quot; calcul@@ ates 10,000 new jobs in the Main within five years . &quot;
&quot; for Frankfurt , such as the I@@ W , the seat of the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , which combines monetary policy and supervision over the largest banks in the Eurozone , as well as other important authorities such as the European insurance company EI@@ OP@@ A and the risk group ES@@ R@@ B . &quot;
&quot; in Paris , the Organisation for Economic Co @-@ operation and Development ( OECD ) has its headquarters , but this is less significant for the financial sector than the ECB . &quot;
&quot; the proximity to the central bank is important for banks as they can communicate directly with the supervision , &quot; says I@@ W @-@ Professor Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder . &quot;
&quot; while Luxembourg has a large fund industry , it cuts down as well as Dublin with the infrastructure worse . &quot;
&quot; thanks to the large airport , Frankfurt is much easier to reach . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , the city boasts easy @-@ to @-@ use shops . &quot;
&quot; in Paris , it is not as easy to find free high @-@ quality offices , &quot; says Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Frankfurt offers a higher quality of life than the competition thanks to good medical care and infrastructure , as well as less crime . &quot;
&quot; in a ranking of Mer@@ cer &apos;s advisory coun@@ seling , the city ranks seventh , Luxembourg at No. 19 , Dublin on No. 33 and Paris at 37@@ th place . &quot;
&quot; even if quality of life is a matter of preference , &quot; with its already strong position as a financial location for the European internal market , Frankfurt could attract more banks and investors , &quot; &quot; conclu@@ des the I@@ W . &quot;
&quot; but in spite of Bre@@ x@@ it V@@ ot@@ um , London will remain the most important financial centre in Europe , my econom@@ ist . &quot;
&quot; according to figures from the Landes@@ bank Hel@@ aba at the end of 2015 around 14@@ 4,000 people in the banking industry , in Frankfurt , were 6@@ 2500 . &quot;
Gilead receives legal expenses from the hepatitis C patent dispute with Mer@@ ck
&quot; a U.S. counter@@ judge decided that Gilead Sciences Inc is entitled to reimbur@@ sement of legal costs , which you have created from the H@@ ep@@ ati@@ ts C legal dispute with the pharmaceutical company Mer@@ ck &amp; Co Inc . &quot;
&quot; in June , Gilead was liber@@ ated from a claim for damages amoun@@ ting to $ 200 million for the violation of two patents of Mer@@ ck , in connection with the block@@ bu@@ ster drugs of so@@ val@@ di and Har@@ von@@ i of Gilead , after a US judge covered a pattern of mis@@ conduct on the part of Mer@@ ck , including Mein@@ ei@@ des and other un@@ ethical acts . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , on Thursday , US President Beth Lab@@ son Fre@@ eman said that Gilead is entitled to reimbur@@ se the costs incurred during the defense of the case . &quot;
&quot; Mer@@ ck tries to equi@@ p with Gilead , which controls the market of a new generation of hepatitis C medicines that can heal over 90 percent of patients with liver disease . &quot;
&quot; the case goes back to 2013 when Gilead and Mer@@ ck claimed each other and claim ownership of laboratory work , which sof@@ os@@ bu@@ vir inf@@ lic@@ ted , the active ingredient in the drugs of Gilead . &quot;
troops supported by the US say they have reg@@ ained complete control over Man@@ bi@@ j from the Islamic State
&quot; by the U.S. forces supported the complete control of the northern city of Man@@ bi@@ j near the Turkish border , after the last IS fighters left in the city , a group spokes@@ man said on Friday . &quot;
&quot; the Democratic Forces of Syria ( D@@ KS ) cur@@ tail@@ ed the remn@@ ants of the remaining group of fighters buried within the city , at the moment the city . &quot;
&quot; they have freed more than 2,000 civilians held by the fighters as host@@ ages shared with the D@@ KS alli@@ ed Man@@ bi@@ j military council Reuters . &quot;
&quot; the city is now under perfect control , but we just run clearing work , &quot; he told Reuters . &quot;
&quot; Clin@@ tons earn 10,@@ 75 million in 2015 and pay 34,@@ 2 % of federal taxes &quot;
&quot; on Friday Hill@@ ary Clinton issued its tax return for 2015 , which resulted in the presidential candidate of the Democrats and her husband an income of USD 10.@@ 75 million and an effective federal tax rate of 34.@@ 2 % . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 , the Clinton Foundation donated USD 1 million for char@@ itable purposes , mainly to the Clinton Foundation ; former President Bill Clinton generated USD 3 million in Rede@@ mption . the former foreign minister gave an income of USD 3 million from the publishing house Simon &amp; Schu@@ ster for her book about her term in the State Department . &quot;
&quot; Clinton &apos;s candidate for the vice @-@ pres@@ idency , Sen@@ ator Tim KA@@ INE from Virginia , published his tax statements of the last ten years along with his wife Anne Hol@@ ton . &quot;
they paid an effective federal tax rate of 20.@@ 3 % in 2015 .
&quot; Hill@@ ary Clinton and Tim KA@@ INE continue to set standards regarding financial transparency , &quot; said Clin@@ tons Kamp@@ agn@@ en@@ hel@@ per Jennifer Pal@@ mier@@ i in a statement . &quot;
&quot; in a stark contrast to this , Donald Tr@@ ump is hiding behind false pron@@ oun@@ cements and returns with regards to his previous promises to publish his tax statements . &quot;
&quot; it is common for US presidential candidates to publish their tax statements , although they are not oblig@@ ated by law for this purpose . &quot;
&quot; Tr@@ ump , a New York business@@ man , and his lawyers argued for his refusal to control a tax audit by the tax authorities . &quot;
&quot; they are on the train , &quot; wrote Clin@@ tons &apos;s electoral campaign in Ian S@@ ams on Twitter , with regard to the publication of the presidential candidate of the Democrats . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday Michael Coh@@ en , Tr@@ umps Special Ad@@ visor , said to CN@@ N , that he would not allow Tr@@ ump to publish something before the tax inspec@@ tions are not complete . &quot;
&quot; Tr@@ umps critics , including the Repub@@ lican candidate of the year 2012 Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney , have already declared that his refusal to ask questions regarding assets , donations for char@@ itable organisations , his business bears and various other links , in particular with Russia . &quot;
Clinton has already pl@@ ung@@ ed on the issue and published a video on the Internet on Friday to appeal to the high ranking Repub@@ lican Tr@@ ump to publish his tax declaration .
&quot; on Thursday , she also addressed the topic during a speech on the business in Michigan . &quot;
&quot; he ref@@ uses to do what every other presidential candidate has done over the last decades and to publish his tax statements . &quot; &quot; she said to the crowd . &quot;
&quot; POL@@ IT@@ ICO reported that Tr@@ ump has paid no or only very little taxes during the 1990s , and an economic journalist from the New York Times cited a series of tax lawyers and tax consultants , declar@@ ing that it could still be the case . &quot;
federal taxes have become an issue in election campaigns .
Clinton supports a regulation named after the billi@@ on@@ aire and investor War@@ ren Buff@@ ett which would ensure that individuals pay more than USD 1 million a tax rate of at least 30 % .
President Obama also supports the proposal .
&quot; during an election campaign for Hill@@ ary Clinton last week in O@@ ma@@ ha , Neb@@ ras@@ ka called Buff@@ ett , whose Ber@@ k@@ shire H@@ ath@@ away industrial glomer@@ ate has its headquarters here , Tr@@ ump a meeting to exchange their tax statements . &quot;
&quot; Buff@@ ett said that he was also subjected to a control examination of IR@@ S and Tr@@ ump was &quot; &quot; afraid &quot; &quot; before voters and not before tax authorities . &quot;
Clinton &apos;s campaign has returned tax return to 2007 until 2007 .
&quot; the Clin@@ tons , now living in Ch@@ app@@ aqu@@ a , New York , paid an effective federal tax rate of about 32 % between 2007 and 2014 and an effective combined tax rate of approx . 4@@ 0.5 % . &quot;
&quot; the tax return of the 2015 Clin@@ tons revealed that these only USD 100 of their income were purchased as a wage , unlike most of the Americans . &quot;
&quot; their main investment position was a cost @-@ effective index fund , from which the Clin@@ tons divi@@ den@@ ds and revenues of USD 109@@ .000 registered . &quot;

&quot; con@@ doms with ch@@ ili@@ pu@@ der , fire@@ works promote Tanz@@ ani@@ as elephant protection &quot;
&quot; nature conserv@@ ation@@ ists in Tanzania use an un@@ orthodo@@ x way to prevent eleph@@ ants from going to live in people inhabited settlements - they throw con@@ doms on them , which are filled with ch@@ ili@@ pu@@ ce . &quot;
&quot; the method has proven to be effective and the Honey@@ guide Foundation , which has been the idea for years ago , has intensi@@ fied its fo@@ stering with US nature protection by trained volunteers in villages in the north of Tanzania , a non @-@ violent four @-@ step method to protect their homes and crops without viol@@ ating animals . &quot;
&quot; previously , many sp@@ ears have used to defend themselves . &quot;
Friday is the world &apos;s day &apos;s day dedicated to animal protection .
&quot; since we have developed the ... Tool@@ kit , we were able to observe a change in their attitudes within these communities , although they are much more confident that they can prevent the eleph@@ ants from their fields without har@@ ming the eleph@@ ants , &quot; said the director of Honey@@ moon Dam@@ ian Bell in a message . &quot;
the first two steps include the lighting of the elephant with a tor@@ ch and the bub@@ bles into a horn .
&quot; if it is not deter@@ red , a so @-@ called &quot; &quot; ch@@ li@@ cloud &quot; &quot; is thrown . &quot;
&quot; ch@@ ili@@ pu@@ der mixed with earth is packed together with a fire@@ works body into a con@@ dom , whose end is turned to the ignition cord . &quot;
&quot; when it is lit , the con@@ dom rests with a bang and spra@@ ys fine dust at ch@@ ili@@ pu@@ der in the air . &quot;
a breath is usually already sufficient to ch@@ ase the elephant .
&quot; a last possibility represents a value that sho@@ ots a gold @-@ turn fire@@ works in the air , causing a loud , bright explosion . &quot;
city council decides unanim@@ ously : no Ki@@ os@@ han@@ ub@@ au at the St. Go@@ ar@@ er Rhein@@ ufer
&quot; normally , the St. Go@@ ar@@ er investment plan of business travellers with K@@ us@@ sh@@ and , however , is now considered to be considerably exp@@ and@@ able in the core city . &quot;
&quot; however , the city council now rejected the application for the new construction of a sal@@ es@@ car near the Rhine river in the immediate vicinity of the Rhein@@ bal@@ k@@ un . &quot;
&quot; in principle , we welcome new businesses , but at this location in exposed position on the banks of the Rhine , this ki@@ osk does not fit , &quot; &quot; explained Michael Hu@@ br@@ ath for the CD@@ U Group . &quot;
Jewish director beats Berlin hotel because Israeli pre @-@ selection was removed after &quot; Arab &quot; call - RT News
&quot; a French director with Jewish roots unle@@ ashed a media clock , after revealing that Kemp@@ inski B@@ rist@@ ol Hotel in Berlin did not list any Israeli choice , since Arabian guests had requested an employee . &quot;
&quot; Claude Lanz@@ mann , author of the Holocaust documentary &quot; Sho@@ ah , &quot; left his anger at the Kemp@@ inski B@@ rist@@ ol Hotel in Berlin by writing an open letter to the German newspaper FA@@ Z . &quot;
&quot; during his last stay , Lanz@@ mann tried to find Israel on the list of the hotels list . &quot;
&quot; however , the country was not listed among the countries that can be inv@@ oked directly from the hotel room . &quot;
&quot; how is it possible in 2016 in Berlin , the capital of the new Germany , possible that Israel was eliminated and deleted ? &quot;
wrote Lanz@@ mann .
&quot; instead , the Kemp@@ in@@ ks@@ i B@@ rist@@ ol offers a possibility to choose Israel via its own call center . &quot;
&quot; after an explanation , the director turned to the hotel reception . &quot;
&quot; the answer he received there , &quot; sho@@ cked him , &quot; as Lanz@@ mann wrote . &quot;
the hotel employee said that the measure was a &quot; deliber@@ ate decision of the management of the Kemp@@ inski Hotels . &quot;
the reason behind it was the director even more fur@@ y .
&quot; the majority of our guests are Arabs and they have demanded that the pre @-@ election is deleted , &quot; was cited by Lanz@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; the Israeli ambassador in Germany Y@@ ak@@ ov Ha@@ das @-@ Handels@@ man called this a &quot; great dis@@ grace , &quot; reports the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung . &quot;
we were horri@@ fied and troubled by this event .
this is really very sham@@ eful .
the fact that this has taken place in Germany in precisely this hotel chain is even an even greater dis@@ grace .
this requires no explanation .
&quot; we expect the hotel to &quot; draw the right conclusions , &quot; said the minister . &quot;
&quot; the incident triggered a fairly large response on the Internet , where people knew the whole thing a sc@@ andal . &quot;
some of the Kemp@@ inski Hotel accommod@@ ated that there would have been the alleged invitation of Arab guests . &quot;
&quot; ashamed of you , it was in another post that was pointed out that the hotel , located in the noble Kur@@ für@@ st@@ end@@ amm , is near a synagogue . &quot;
&quot; the hotel quickly pointed out all accus@@ ations of himself and called the incident to &quot; &quot; see &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; ap@@ ologi@@ zed &quot; &quot; by Lanz@@ mann , Der Spiegel . &quot;
&quot; there was never a direct assignment , &quot; &quot; Israel did not include in the quick selection list , &quot; &quot; quoted the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung a spokes@@ man of the Kemp@@ inski Hotel . &quot;
adds that the country code has now been added .
police force Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as &amp; Gum@@ mig@@ esch@@ osse against prot@@ esting Brazilian students
students met with the police on Thursday in Sa@@ o Paulo &apos;s Brazilian city when they gathered to protest against the government &apos;s reforms for the public education system .
the police deployed tear gas and rubber bul@@ lets against prot@@ esters .
&quot; the difficulties began , as police officers tried to disper@@ se the students , which led to the fact that the police put rubber sho@@ cks and tear gas . &quot;
several hundred students took part in the demonstrations in order to express their short@@ com@@ ings about the plans .
&quot; according to the proposals of the Gover@@ nor of Sa@@ o Paulo Ger@@ aldo Al@@ ck@@ min , less than 100 public schools will be closed , while 300,000 students are implemented to save money . &quot;
some of the Protest@@ ants were seen gra@@ ff@@ iti against the provis@@ ional President Michel Tem@@ er on walls .
&quot; the most recent protests occurred a few days after demonstr@@ ators went to the streets in masses to support the suspended President Dil@@ ma Rous@@ se@@ ff , which had been dismis@@ sed by a vote by the Senate on her assignment . &quot;
trade between Russia &amp; Iran suddenly rises to 71 % - RT Business
&quot; according to the Russian ambassador in Iran , Lev@@ an D@@ zh@@ ag@@ ar@@ yan , the trade turnover between Moscow and T@@ eher@@ an increased by 7@@ 0.9 percent . &quot;
&quot; since the international sanctions against Iran have been lifted , the interest in Russian companies grew strongly in businesses in the country , shared the ambassador . &quot;
&quot; Russian companies take up existing connections with Iran , while new companies are willing to gain access to the market . &quot;
&quot; of course , the further commercial expansion is one of the main priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran , &quot; &quot; said D@@ zh@@ ag@@ ar@@ yan . &quot;
&quot; he noted that the trade turnover between Russia and Iran in the first five months of the year 2016 increased by 7@@ 0.9 percent compared to the same period in 2015 , and $ 8@@ 56 million . &quot;
&quot; in particular , Russian imports increased by 9@@ 1.5 percent in Iran and amounted to $ 697 million . &quot;
Russian imports from Iran rose by 16 percent to $ 158 million .
&quot; the trade boom was achieved by deliveries of machinery , land vehicles and weapons , &quot; said the ambassador . &quot;
&quot; for this year , D@@ zh@@ ag@@ ar@@ yan goes out of a record number of Iranian tourists in Russia . &quot;
&quot; last year , Russian foreign representatives issued around 35@@ ,000 Vis@@ as , primarily travel visa , Iranian citizens . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Iran reached the top 20 of the countries in terms of the number of tourists in Russia . &quot;
&quot; one could say that record numbers of Iranian tourists in Russia last year will be broken , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , only relatively few Russians visit Iran , something from which the ambassador hopes it will change . &quot;
&quot; I personally can recommend visiting the cities Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Shi@@ ra@@ z and Y@@ az@@ d , who have received the monuments of the ancient Persian civilization in a good condition , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; searched for : beverages market in Wald@@ bron@@ n , Germany &quot;
a rob@@ ber@@ y attack on Thursday evening has been exer@@ ted on the beverage market of Re@@ we XXL at the Wald@@ br@@ ö@@ ler Ger@@ ber@@ straße .
&quot; with the support of a gun weapon , three dark @-@ dressed people who had m@@ um@@ bled their faces were the issu@@ ing of cash and then fled at first by foot and then presum@@ ably with a silver @-@ coloured VW Golf . &quot;
&quot; how much money was captured , the police will not share . &quot;
&quot; the perpetr@@ ators should have been between 1,@@ 60 and 1,@@ 70 metres tall , so relatively small . &quot;
the beverage market is accessible directly from the deck of the Re@@ we market and is poor@@ ly accessible .
&quot; after the Über@@ fall , the perpetr@@ ators have to be sc@@ anned in the direction of Ger@@ ber@@ straße , Friedrich @-@ Engel@@ bert @-@ Weg and be escaped from the gravel parking area situated opposite the parking place with the silver @-@ coloured car , possibly towards B 256 ( Schla@@ der@@ n@@ ring ) . &quot;
&quot; who made observations at the time of the crime ( against 19.@@ 45 h ) , who are in connection with the rob@@ ber@@ y attack , should urgently report to the police . &quot;
Nag@@ old : games and fun during summer@@ time
&quot; eight beautiful and happy days spent the children and you@@ ths of the social ped@@ agog@@ ical day group / social group work of the Nag@@ old child protection association with their car@@ ers on their summer@@ time in Nuss@@ dorf , near Müh@@ lack@@ er . &quot;
&quot; during the first school holiday week , the life @-@ joy@@ ful group was quar@@ ter@@ ated during the first school holiday week . &quot;
several full day trips were on the agenda .
for one we went to Bret@@ ten with a visit to the zoo z@@ oos .
&quot; to the other after Maul@@ bron@@ n , where there was a special children &apos;s guide in the world @-@ famous monastery . &quot;
the third excursion led to Pfor@@ z@@ heim .
&quot; in the Kel@@ ten@@ museum in Hoch@@ dorf , the group learned a lot about everyday life and the food of the Cel@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; on the hot days , the group rejo@@ iced in the deep sea in Maul@@ bron@@ n , who invited to jump , swimming and planning . &quot;
&quot; culinary , children and car@@ egi@@ vers have been spoiled with their own car@@ ts such as the Sau@@ ren Sp@@ itt@@ le , the Seeb@@ ron@@ ner Pf@@ än@@ n@@ le , I@@ sel@@ sh@@ aus@@ er @-@ Blo@@ ff , the English @-@ Breakfast and T@@ üb@@ inger Bolog@@ n@@ ese . &quot;
&quot; workshops were cur@@ ated , beautiful jewellery made of pearls and stones or made of wood a Roman mill game . &quot;
&quot; further highlights of the free time were fishing in a nearby pond , the evenings at the fire and the final &quot; &quot; Bun@@ te Abend . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; on the day of the voyage home , the sun and the children and you@@ ths returned satisfied . &quot;
Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch : pilgrims to the gates of mercy
the mini@@ stries from the pastoral care unit E@@ yach@@ tal @-@ Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch St. Anna were on the way on a four @-@ day pilgrimage from Vil@@ lingen to Freiburg .
&quot; together , four stages were overcome . &quot;
&quot; in order to bridge the period up to the next Roman pilgrimage of all the mini@@ stries in the fores@@ ee@@ able two years , the chief minist@@ erial round St. Anna decided to prepare and carry out a multi @-@ day pilgrimage . &quot;
&quot; several pilgrimage destinations were examined and one finally decided to visit the Bishop of Freiburg , where this year , on the occasion of the Holy Year of Mer@@ cy with the opened gate of mercy on Freiburg &apos;s Münster , a special pilgrimage destination was offered . &quot;
&quot; 16 Min@@ is of B@@ itt@@ el@@ bron@@ n , Gru@@ ene , and Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch , and Heiligen@@ zimmern , went on the way . &quot;
&quot; in the evening before , Pastor Stor@@ ost sent pilgrims in a small celebration in St. Anna , blessed the pilgri@@ ma@@ ges and granted the pilgrimage . &quot;
&quot; from Hor@@ b , it was driven by train to the starting point of Vil@@ lingen , where also a Münster cathedral of Our Lady stands , and so the pilgrimage route from Münster was taken . &quot;
&quot; each day tours were framed in the morning and in the evening by a short impulse with different prayers , songs and texts . &quot;
&quot; but also on the way , the Min@@ is made on field cross @-@ crosses , chap@@ els or churches again and again to sing a song from a specially composed pilgri@@ m song . &quot;
&quot; for the nights , par@@ ishes of the local par@@ ishes stood at their disposal . &quot;
&quot; at the stage destinations Alexandra Burk@@ hardt and Hei@@ di F@@ aller made a tasty , even stronger dinner and breakfast . &quot;
on the second day we passed over Fur@@ tw@@ angen to Gü@@ ten@@ bach .
&quot; tags were followed by the stage after St. Peter , which was the most exhau@@ sting distance , but at first we had to climb some 500 metres in the heat and then climbed up again . &quot;
the deser@@ ved reward was in the evening a joint barbecue at Bad@@ wei@@ her .
after dawn on the fourth day of pilgrimage in the impressive monastery church of St. Peter we went to Freiburg .
&quot; visi@@ bly facilit@@ ated and happy , the Min@@ is met in the afternoon at the Freiburg cathedral and passed through the gates of mercy . &quot;
with a little impulse God was given thanks to God .
&quot; at the evening Mass in Münster , the Min@@ is by Ko@@ operator Markus O@@ bert were welcomed at the Pil@@ gri@@ m &apos;s destination . &quot;
&quot; after the divine service , pilgrims were able to visit the sac@@ rist@@ y and the high altar . &quot;
the next day was still time for the B@@ reis@@ gau@@ metropolis .
in the afternoon we went by train back to Hor@@ b .
&quot; at the end , all participants agreed that the days of spirituality and a strong community experience were marked . &quot;
Scot@@ sman Call@@ um Sk@@ inner rus@@ hes home when Br@@ ite Gold won gold for cycling
Scotland &apos;s Call@@ um Sk@@ inner ra@@ ste the last night in the male team spr@@ int in the Vel@@ od@@ rom in Rio for fame when the British team defended the title of London 2012 .
&quot; the 23 @-@ year @-@ old from Glasgow took the an@@ chor@@ age , which his fellow country@@ man Sir Chris Ho@@ y had made himself to E@@ igen . &quot;
&quot; four years ago England claimed a sho@@ cking victory , while Ho@@ y fet@@ ched the fifth of six Olympic medals . &quot;
&quot; they repeated the trick , after they took a modest sixth place in London in March at the London Underground World Championships in London . &quot;
the problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the driver Jamie staff .
they did this in time as a Hin@@ der .
Ho@@ ys retirement was created a gap that K@@ ian E@@ ma@@ di and Matt Cr@@ ampton were trying to close .
Sk@@ inner was the man with whom they stayed as they saw potential in the gravel that has now un@@ folded .
&quot; Hin@@ der , Kenn@@ y - who won with Ho@@ y four years ago - and Sk@@ inner played an olymp@@ ic record in qualifying rounds , but in the stand@@ ar@@ round the New Ze@@ al@@ anders won in the first round . &quot;
and the British trio won the du@@ el with gold .
&quot; Hin@@ der lag behind after his lap , but Kenn@@ y brought the team forward and Sk@@ inner held it . &quot;
&quot; a change of strategy made a large part of the transformation , when the Hin@@ der rode in a higher speed to slow it down and allow Kenn@@ y and above all sk@@ inner to keep the pace . &quot;
&quot; Ho@@ y looked at his position as a BBC expert and fell Sk@@ inner , Kenn@@ y and Hin@@ der , when they stepped on the podium . &quot;
the 23 @-@ year @-@ old Sk@@ inner from Glasgow said : &quot; it &apos;s a flat@@ tering comparison . &quot;
I am just here to do my best and make a name for me .
&quot; in the final round , we set up an olymp@@ ic record and defeated the World Champion . &quot;
it was just incredible .
there is no better way to win this .
&quot; after the triumph in 2012 on the page Kenn@@ ys and Ho@@ ys , Hin@@ du said that after a weak start , he inten@@ tionally fell on track . &quot;
he with@@ drew this statement later and there was no obj@@ ection from England &apos;s ri@@ vals .
&quot; with such an outstanding victory , this time there was no such problem . &quot;
&quot; he said , &quot; &quot; It feels like the whole GB flags on the grand@@ stand like London . &quot;
we have come together in the last three months as a team .
&quot; in so many world titles , we did so badly that it was incredible to win again at the Olympics . &quot;
&quot; this is an event , a gold medal for the nation , which were won seven out of 10 titles both in Beijing and in London . &quot;
&quot; if this is a bar@@ ometer of our progress in the last five months , we expect successful five days in the Vel@@ od@@ rom . &quot;
&quot; with the form of Kenn@@ y , it is in the realm of the possibility that he has repeated Ho@@ ys &apos;s victory of three Olympic gold medals in a competition . &quot;
&quot; that would be for Kenn@@ y - who was just 12 years younger than Ho@@ y , who was also born on March 23rd ( an apparently holy date for British sports ; on the day also Steve Red@@ grave , Mo Far@@ ah and Roger Ban@@ ni@@ ster were born ) - a yield of six gold medals and a silver medal . &quot;
that &apos;s the same from Ho@@ y .
Kenn@@ y takes part in the spr@@ int that starts today and will go for three days .
the 28 @-@ year @-@ old Bol@@ ton said : &quot; I enjoy this only for the moment . &quot;
the team event is always the best .
you can win it with his colleagues .
it feels a bit lonely to win alone .
&quot; he said , &quot; &quot; If he wins two more gold medals , he should be beaten to the k@@ night . &quot;
&quot; it was the only medal race of the day , but there were other good news for England . &quot;
&quot; Sir Bra@@ dly W@@ ig@@ gins , Ed C@@ lan@@ cy , Steven Bur@@ ke and Ow@@ ain Dou@@ ll qualified with the fastest performance in four @-@ four km race . &quot;
they arrived at the target in 3 : 5@@ 1,9@@ 42 . &quot;
&quot; the World Record , which won gold in 2012 in London , was 3 : 5@@ 1,6@@ 59 . &quot;

the GB team relies on his strong train team to dominate the middle period of the Olympic Games and get a bill of medals .
&quot; after a truly extraordinary representation of absolute domin@@ ance in Beijing and London , the expectations for Rio were shut down . &quot;
&quot; dr@@ amas in the background played in the background , so the res@@ ign@@ ation of the technical director Sh@@ ane S@@ ut@@ ton in April surrounded by sex@@ ism and mus@@ ings and retirement of sizes such as Ho@@ y and Victoria P@@ end@@ let@@ on . &quot;
&quot; however , if one sees the first evening of the competition in the Vel@@ od@@ rom , it looks like the now legendary reputation GB@@ s that has reached its peak at the perfect moment . &quot;
future of the melting of Port@@ land due to the lifting of the energy contract
&quot; the future of the aluminum mel@@ ts of Port@@ land in Victoria - as well as hundreds of work@@ stations of workers - are at stake , as the plant operator termin@@ ate the energy supply contract and thereby abol@@ ishes all supply contracts , as the supplying energy company has ha@@ sten@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; this step followed the decision of the government in Victoria at the beginning of this year , no further subsidies to operate the plant . &quot;
a subsi@@ dy for 20 years is running out in November .
up to 2000 jobs in the Alco@@ a plant in Port@@ land are at stake .
not less than 2000 jobs - direct as well as indirect - may be je@@ op@@ ardi@@ zed at a closure .
&quot; in addition , it could come to domin@@ oes , as the melting process consum@@ es about 10 percent of the total electricity generation of Vict@@ ori@@ as . &quot;
&quot; in 2014 , Alco@@ a closed the Point Henry Schmel@@ zer@@ ei , which led to a closure of the Angl@@ es@@ ea power plant last year . &quot;
the sm@@ el@@ ting of Alco@@ a in Port@@ land loses money and risk a closure .
&quot; this step follows the years of spec@@ ulation in terms of the future of the system , originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar and finally due to the power supply for the plant . &quot;
&quot; AG@@ L , which supplies the large aluminium melting pot with its Lo@@ y Yang A power plant in Lat@@ robe Valley , announced that three more owners will announce their contracts . &quot;
&quot; the plant is in the majority ownership of a joint venture of Alco@@ a and Al@@ um@@ ina , from which the Chinese company C@@ IT@@ IC and the Japanese Mar@@ ub@@ eni Cor@@ p keep smaller shares . &quot;
&quot; AG@@ L assumes that the plant in Port@@ land continues to operate , which means a further physical demand for electricity by sm@@ el@@ ting , &quot; said the company . &quot;
&quot; AG@@ L continued to say that the contracts were called &quot; &quot; hed@@ ging transactions &quot; , &quot; which should have come into effect from November 2016 . &quot;
the contracts signed a 12 month notice period so that they will end in 2017 .
&quot; from that point , AG@@ L assumes that the contracts will contribute to revenues in the fiscal year 17 , &quot; &quot; said the power supplier . &quot;
all potential impacts on the revenue on AG@@ L from the G@@ J 18 are currently limited by forecasts of strong terminal prices for wholesale electricity prices .
AG@@ L announced that it had already written the value of the contracts in its annual subscription in the amount of $ 187 million in &quot; anticip@@ ation of a cancellation . &quot;
&quot; Alco@@ a said that the decision to book the contracts , the &quot; &quot; capacity of Alco@@ as ... &quot; &quot; to operate the melt or to ensure the power supply to the sm@@ el@@ ting process &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the US company said that 2010 concluded a 20 @-@ year contract with Lo@@ y Yang , which would have come into force from November this year , even if there is still one explanation why it res@@ igned from the contract . &quot;
analysts warn against the bad economic conditions of the industry before the possible closure of the Port@@ land melting shop in Victoria and the Tom@@ ago facility near New@@ castle .
&quot; in reference to the statements of analysts at the beginning of the week , Head of Operations Stephen Mik@@ kel@@ sen said that Port@@ land consum@@ es around 600 meg@@ a@@ wat@@ ts and Tom@@ ago about 900 meg@@ a@@ wat@@ ts of power each year . &quot;
&quot; if both systems should disappear from the market , this would mean significant reduction in demand on the &#91; power market &#93; . &quot;
&quot; and for us as a generator , it wouldn &apos;t be good , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; more than just a Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an Reality @-@ TV @-@ Star , K@@ end@@ all is on the cover of the Vog@@ ue September issue &quot;
&quot; all J@@ enner , 20 , Model and fourth daughter of the Man@@ ag@@ erin and mother of the Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an @-@ J@@ enner C@@ lans Kr@@ is is on the cover of the cov@@ eted September issue of the US Vog@@ ue . &quot;
&quot; the brand ambassador of E@@ ste@@ e Lau@@ der , and ran on Fashion We@@ eks in Milan , Paris and New York , announced the news on their Inst@@ ag@@ ram account on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; in a room full of people I love , the sight of this disgu@@ ise brought me to cry , &quot; K@@ end@@ all wrote . &quot;
&quot; the un@@ v@@ eiling of the cover was followed by a bizarre ( or simply Ke@@ eping Up with the Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an @-@ like ? ) , scrip@@ ted reality video showing the whole Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an J@@ enner family ( with the exception of the problem cases Rob and Ca@@ it@@ ly@@ n as well as in the presence of the most popular Show@@ biz On@@ c@@ els and Producer of Ke@@ eping Up Ryan Se@@ ac@@ rest ) , as she conclu@@ des with a classical twist . &quot;
&quot; this represents the kl@@ is@@ ha@@ iry act of nearly every birthday sep@@ is@@ ode of a children &apos;s show ( Se@@ ac@@ rest brought the sentence , &quot; &quot; You thought that we had forgotten you ? &quot; , &quot; with the hon@@ esty of a cartoon by 8 o &apos;clock in the morning ) , but Kr@@ is had to let her other girls take part in this public@@ ity . &quot;
&quot; with regard to the September issue of Vog@@ ue , a new era of the Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an began with certainty . &quot;
&quot; K@@ end@@ alls big sister Kim likes to hit the Vog@@ ue cover ( she and her husband K@@ any@@ e West were to be seen in April 2014 ) , but the cover of the September issue of the magazine is a league for itself . &quot;
the September edition is the most sold edition of the year for Vog@@ ue .
&quot; with a circum@@ ference that resem@@ bles an illustrated book as a fashion magazine , the output draws a large number of advertis@@ ers ( L@@ aut Fas@@ hi@@ on@@ ist@@ a were from the 8@@ 32 pages of the dancer 615 pages advertising ) . &quot;
the un@@ v@@ eiling of his cover star is so eag@@ erly awa@@ ited that in the last two years pictures of the magazine le@@ ak@@ ed before the official announcement .
&quot; women who were already on the cover include Na@@ omi Camp@@ bell , Linda Evangel@@ ist@@ a and Kate Mos@@ s . &quot;
&quot; in recent years there were clearly more &quot; celeb@@ ri@@ ties , which are model@@ ed &quot; as &quot; models that are celeb@@ ri@@ ties &quot; on the cover . &quot;
&quot; Oscar Prize Win@@ ner and Di@@ or brand ambassador Jennifer Lawrence was on the cover in 2013 , a year after Lady G@@ aga had the honor . &quot;
&quot; but even with the little chance that Mrs. J@@ enner , who is described by the magazine as the &quot; breakthrough model &quot; of her generation - is under the earlier category , she is in good company . &quot;
&quot; these celeb@@ ri@@ ties are not related to famous people , or reality stars or young@@ sters of today who know how to turn a good Snap@@ chat video ( even if it all applies to denom@@ in@@ ator ) . &quot;
they are really talented women who sign in the entertainment industry .
&quot; Be@@ y@@ once , who appeared on the last cover , had with the release of Lem@@ on@@ ade one of the most successful years of her career . &quot;
&quot; of course , J@@ enn@@ ers don &apos;t like success any success . &quot;
&quot; with their reality TV story , J@@ enn@@ ers had always listened to something in the world of fashion . &quot;
in June the former Victoria &apos;s Secret model Steph@@ anie Sey@@ m@@ our J@@ enner and her colleague Gig@@ i Ha@@ did and she called her &quot; the dung of the moment . &quot;
these feelings came up again when news came out with the appearance of J@@ enn@@ ers on the Vog@@ ue Cover .
&quot; but on the mis@@ carriage , it seems to pass by the point . &quot;
k@@ end@@ all J@@ enner is on the cover of the September issue of Vog@@ ue .
it is a super@@ model in the tru@@ est sense of the word .
it runs for Marc Jacob@@ s .
it makes advertising for your pri@@ ming of E@@ ste@@ e Lau@@ der .
you and all your sisters will sell you pictures of themselves on their respective pay@@ wall apps .
she sold her made pictures of Cin@@ dy C@@ RA@@ W@@ FOR@@ DS daughter to the magazine LOVE .
and in her free time she is seen in reality TV . presum@@ ably only to see her sister K@@ our@@ t@@ ney and her children .
&quot; community Centr@@ es exhibit 16@@ 0,000 people each year &quot;
&quot; more than 16@@ 0,000 in the country &apos;s aid would be deb@@ ated annually by the municipal centres , while the industry insi@@ sted on the impact of further short@@ cuts to already over@@ loaded transactions . &quot;
&quot; in Que@@ ens@@ land , three of five people - mostly older people , immigrants , need@@ y workers , victims of violence and those who have no means for un@@ just del@@ og@@ ations and similar - are rejected in their request for free legal advice and legal assistance . &quot;
&quot; legal services of the municipality , which are already sufficiently trained , are ready for further cuts . &quot;
&quot; as of June next year , these legal centres will lose another 30 percent of their federal funds . &quot;
the director of the community centers of Que@@ esland James Far@@ rell said that the last survey of the National Association of Community Centers found that thousands of people have already been dismis@@ sed each year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Far@@ rell said that the situation would only get worse without repe@@ ating the decision of the Federal Government . &quot;
&quot; Que@@ ens@@ land &apos;s community centres are chron@@ ically under@@ financed , meaning that thousands of people are rejected by important services you need , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; people who rely on violent relationships , people with insur@@ moun@@ table and overwhelming debt , families who were dismis@@ sed by separ@@ ations , workers who were dismis@@ sed un@@ just - all these people have problems of legal nature and this survey shows that they cannot receive the help they need . &quot;
&quot; in June 2017 , the federal government will cut its funds by 30 percent , which means that thousands of aid need@@ less people from Que@@ ens@@ land will be forced to cope with their legal problems without any help . &quot;
&quot; we call for the General Prosec@@ utor and the Federal Constitutional Court as well as sen@@ ators from Que@@ ens@@ land George Bran@@ dis to immediately raise these short@@ cuts , so that people can get the help they need in legal problems . &quot;
&quot; last year , the state government fulfilled its commitment to raise funds for guidance on national average . &quot;
&quot; it is now time to look at the needs of community centres and their customers , as well as that the Pal@@ as@@ z@@ c@@ zu@@ k government has invested in this important work . &quot;
Donald Tr@@ ump Ele@@ ction Campa@@ ign accused of allegedly pulling a gun
&quot; new York : Donald Tr@@ umps campaign has been indic@@ ted for alleged in@@ action after being told that her campaign manager for North Carolina had directed a gun to a staff , while in February they were on the road in a je@@ ep . &quot;
&quot; the incident is described in a complaint filed on Wednesday at Charlotte Regional Court by Vincent B@@ ordin@@ i , a former software program@@ mer for the campaign in this federal state . &quot;
&quot; B@@ ordin@@ i gave up for months to have waited for the matter internally to be settled , before he realis@@ es that &quot; that would not happen . &quot;
&quot; the campaign manager , Earl Philip , &quot; pulled a gun , put his right finger on the trigger , and r@@ ammed the run at Vinc@@ ents Kni@@ ek@@ eh@@ le , &quot; B@@ ordin@@ i said in his indictment . &quot;
&quot; after he had compl@@ ained with the local and regional campaign management , B@@ ordin@@ i stated that at least four more people had made the same experience with Phil@@ lip , he admitted to the indictment . &quot;
&quot; weapons must not be fired to cause harm , &quot; said B@@ ordin@@ i . &quot;
&quot; the accus@@ ation comes only two days after the Repub@@ lican candidate prov@@ oked a rebellion when he said a crowd in North Carolina , that &quot; Second A@@ mend@@ ment People &quot; - shot war@@ lords and ce@@ as@@ ers should take action if his ri@@ val@@ in Hill@@ ary Clinton should be elected and ap@@ point judge . &quot;
&quot; Tr@@ umps Campa@@ ign clearly stated that the media would have torn his words out of context , and that he would not cause violence . &quot;
B@@ ordin@@ is complaint demands compensation from the campaign for breach of due di@@ ligence and by Philip for bodily injury and lead @-@ free psychological damage .
Tr@@ umps press spokes@@ man Hope H@@ icks was not to be reached for a statement .
&quot; try to contact Philip , just as well . &quot;
&quot; W@@ CC@@ B , a local news channel in Charlotte , reports that Phil@@ lip is no longer collabor@@ ator of the campaign . &quot;
&quot; on calls to his consulting company , Innov@@ ative Consulting Services , was not respon@@ sive . &quot;

Berlin / Schwer@@ in : survey before federal elections : SPD and CD@@ U
&quot; in the upcoming elections in the Federal States of Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern ( September 4 ) and Berlin ( September 18 ) , considerable losses for the governing parties SPD and CD@@ U are recorded . &quot;
this was representative surveys of the IN@@ SA opinion research institute for the &quot; Bild &quot; newspaper ( Friday ) .
&quot; while the red @-@ black government coalition in the north could hardly be ruled out , this is not possible after the survey data in Berlin . &quot;
&quot; in both states , the SPD would be the strongest party and would have good chances to continue to face the head of government . &quot;
&quot; in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern , the SPD las@@ hed out from 35.@@ 6 percent to 24 percent five years ago . &quot;
&quot; according to the survey , the party only sm@@ iles almost before the CD@@ U , which could come back to 23 percent . &quot;
the third place is fought between the left and the Af@@ D .
&quot; the left came to 19 percent ( previously 18.@@ 4 percent ) , the Af@@ D would be represented by 19 percent for the first time in the country . &quot;
&quot; despite slight losses , the Gre@@ ens were rel@@ u@@ ct@@ ant to return to Schwer@@ in Land@@ tag in spite of slight losses ( previous 8.7 percent ) . &quot;
&quot; with 3 percent , N@@ PD and F@@ DP would not be represented in the Parliament . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
the CD@@ U only reached 18 percent after 23.@@ 4 percent .
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
the Af@@ D would be represented by 14 percent for the first time in the Chamber of Dep@@ u@@ ties .
&quot; with 5 percent , the F@@ DP could hope for a return , the pir@@ ates would , on the other hand , miss the move in contrast to 2011 . &quot;
Nokia 9000 Communic@@ ator : the first smartphone
&quot; e @-@ Mail and Internet in slow motion : 20 years ago , the Nokia Communic@@ ator came to the market . &quot;
the success@@ ors dominate the world today - his manufacturer experienced a disaster .
the tool weigh@@ ed almost half kil@@ ograms and was more than four times as heavy as an iPhone 5 .
&quot; it was th@@ icker and bigger , therefore it was not good in the hand . &quot;
&quot; on the contrary , it was rather cl@@ ums@@ y . &quot;
&quot; the built @-@ in memory was initially eight meg@@ ab@@ ytes , which would suff@@ ice today for about two sel@@ fies with high resolution . &quot;
an iPhone is now supplied with at least 16 gig@@ ab@@ ytes .
&quot; the &quot; Nokia 9000 communic@@ ator &quot; occurred exactly 20 years ago , on 15 August 1996 , in stores - and it was the first smartphone . &quot;
&quot; for a few euros , fans can buy the equipment on the internet , but they somehow come from the stone age of the internet age . &quot;
&quot; 20 years ago , however , communic@@ ator was a sensation . &quot;
&quot; the Finnish mobile phone manufacturer had announced the product a few months earlier at the computer fair C@@ eb@@ it in Hanover as an &quot; &quot; office in the West &quot; &quot; format . &quot;
&quot; in fact , the new mobile phone could be sent and received for then standards : SMS and e @-@ mails could be sent and received , even by fax , the communic@@ ator was reached . &quot;
&quot; even the access to web pages was possible via HTML browser , even if agon@@ izing slowly . &quot;
&quot; a calcul@@ ator was available , a digital address book and an electronic calendar . &quot;
there was a small antenna and the mobile phone could be folded like a laptop .
then there was a small keyboard and a black and white screen .
&quot; the prize : 2700 D @-@ Mark , thus about 1400 Euro . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
nobody could fores@@ ee in August 1996 that the communic@@ ator would become the beginning of the smartphone era .
&quot; since then , everything is different . &quot;
&quot; smart phones are a success story , though not for Nokia . &quot;
&quot; the mobile phone division of the Finn@@ s experienced an unprecedented disaster , was finally sold to Microsoft and handled . &quot;
&quot; today , market@@ ers dominate the market that came all much later than Nokia . &quot;
&quot; always and everywhere online , this is today for a lot of people everyday . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; sold around 1.4 billion devices , on Samsung and Apple , it alone accounts for 555 million units . &quot;
worldwide sales with the devices is around 400 billion euros .
&quot; for this purpose , the well @-@ running business of the countless app providers and the telec@@ om companies will be involved . &quot;
&quot; in the meantime , a whole industry has emerged around the smartphone . &quot;
&quot; the decisive breakthrough to the mass market was only beginning in early 2007 , then Apple boss Steve Jobs announced the launch of the i@@ Ph@@ ones on Mac @-@ World . &quot;
&quot; he promised three devices in one : a music player , a telephone and an internet communic@@ ator , all with touch screen easy to use . &quot;
&quot; the success story of Apple began , even today the iPhone is the most important product of the group . &quot;
&quot; Nokia , Motorola and Black@@ berry , who dominated the market , had the night view . &quot;
&quot; finally , they disappeared , Black@@ berry has to fight . &quot;
the sa@@ ws are now Apple and Asian providers like Samsung .
the smartphone is a matter of course for 20 years after its invention .
today each German now looks for his mobile phone 88 times a day .
&quot; we must all learn to get rid of the smartphone , &quot; &quot; said Jan@@ ina Ball , in charge of the Siemens Executive Board . &quot;
permanent availability is now considered a curse and blessing at the same time .
England must direct the Olympic spirit and extend He@@ ath@@ row
&quot; He@@ ath@@ row won &apos;t only bring about renewal and prosperity in our local communities and throughout London , but throughout the country . &quot;
&quot; for me this was the biggest attraction of He@@ ath@@ row , just like in 2012 in London , when we ran a great effort to ensure that all our nations and regions benefited from the games . &quot;
the Olympi@@ ad brought great advantages for Strat@@ ford and the East End .
and that will be achieved by creating new opportunities for local residents and companies near He@@ ath@@ row .
&quot; for our local communities , we will create 10,000 new apprentic@@ es@@ hips alone , creating 4@@ 0,000 new jobs and put an end to youth unemployment in the airport environment . &quot;
&quot; as they were ahead of us in London 2012 , there will be those who think that the challenge of enlargement he@@ ath@@ rows is too big . &quot;
I was told that England will never be ready for the games and that we will be bl@@ am@@ pered on the world stage .
the doub@@ ters had wron@@ ged in 2012 and they will also be wrong with He@@ ath@@ row .
&quot; there are always obstacles to over@@ coming , but He@@ ath@@ row answers every question asked . &quot;
&quot; like the Olympic Games , He@@ ath@@ row is for many and not for single an infrastructure project . &quot;
&quot; expansion is a way to create up to 180@@ .000 new jobs , £ 211 bn in wit@@ ty growth and to leave a legacy of skills and employment both around the airport and across the UK . &quot;
&quot; we have implemented a great team at He@@ ath@@ row , which has implemented a £ 11 billion expensive infrastructure investment program in time and budget , from T5 - five years in a row to the world &apos;s best airport terminal . &quot;
&quot; now they are ready to deliver a third cat@@ walk , which is supported by £ 16 billion in private investment . &quot;
the 2012 London games were a great success for GB and I am confident that the expansion of He@@ ath@@ row will also be one .
&quot; it is time for us to direct this Olympic spirit and bro@@ aden He@@ ath@@ row , as well as to secure our future trade and create a legacy of skills and jobs that England can be proud of . &quot;

&quot; Ad@@ block Plus , Facebook in &quot; &quot; K@@ atz und Maus spiel &quot; &quot; regarding ad blocking &quot;
&quot; for companies who earn money with online advertising , according to one of the software manufacturers attempts to b@@ ypass the ad block , a &quot; cat and mouse game . &quot; &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , only two days after Facebook announced that it would block display lo@@ dges on its desktop page , Ad@@ block Plus published a blog post in which it announced that users could update their filters in the program to re@@ activate advertisement on the social network . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , Facebook announced that his desktop page would change the enco@@ ding with respect to his advertisements to make it difficult to detect the recognition that part of the page is advertising . &quot;
but Ad@@ block announced that it has found a new way to circum@@ vent the new codes .
&quot; in a blog@@ post , the spokes@@ man of Ad@@ block Ben Williams wrote that &quot; this kind of H@@ in @-@ and @-@ Her @-@ struggle between the time @-@ giving open source community and the rel@@ u@@ ct@@ ant has been in progress since the invention of display lock@@ ers , &quot; and that it is possible that Facebook is coming soon with a new solution . &quot;
the fact that the world &apos;s largest social media company has entered the fight is a strong indication of how wor@@ rying scor@@ eboard for the industry have become .
&quot; according to a study published last year by Pa@@ gef@@ air and Adobe , some 200 million people use scor@@ eboard mark@@ ers ; almost four times as much as 2013 . &quot;
&quot; with 1,@@ 03 billion daily users who access Facebook via their mobile devices , hand@@ y@@ ads make 84 percent of the advertising revenue . &quot;
&quot; the company , apart from the fact that mobile ad block@@ ers have no effect on Facebook &apos;s mobile apps for the social network and inst@@ ag@@ ram , shared a spokes@@ man . &quot;
advertising on desktop PCs is making a sufficient amount of revenue so that Facebook appears to be worth the investment of such a step as worthwhile .
&quot; on Tuesday , Facebook announced that it would be &quot; &quot; ad preferences pool &quot; &quot; to give people more control over them . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , Facebook affir@@ med that ad@@ missions would be wor@@ rying about new filters because they would also block content on the site that are no advertising . &quot;
&quot; for the users , this is not a positive experience , so we plan to address the problem , &quot; said a Facebook spokes@@ person in an email message . &quot;
&quot; ad block@@ ers are a bl@@ unt tool , which is why we have instead focused on developing tools such as Ad Pre@@ ferences , to put more control into the hands of the people . &quot;
woman supposed to pass on Swiss motorway at suspected suicide
the victim was in the middle of the night on the highway .
the police call on witnesses after a woman in the early hours of the morning was passed on a presum@@ able suicide of several vehicles on a highway .
the incident occurred on the A1 near Morges in the Canton of Vau@@ d shortly after midnight .
&quot; a woman slept in the dark &quot; &quot; in an act of despair &quot; &quot; on the street and were hit by several cars , the police said in Vau@@ d . &quot;
&quot; it is obvious that a Swiss , at the age of 49 , wanted to kill itself by several vehicles , including a truck , to kill itself . &quot;
she died on the spot .
&quot; several drivers have already been inter@@ rog@@ ated , but some have not yet been identified , the police said that these and every witness of the incident prompt you to report . &quot;
&quot; an investigation proceedings were opened , which is a &quot; logical &quot; step in such a situation , distributed G@@ illes Hof@@ st@@ etter to Le Tri@@ b@@ une de Gen@@ eve . &quot;
&quot; however , it remains to be seen whether one of the drivers will be displayed . &quot;
was a clas@@ h prev@@ ent@@ able ?
&quot; this is something that the prosec@@ utor has to decide , &quot; Hof@@ st@@ etter said . &quot;
two similar cases in the last five years show that the drivers are not to be held accoun@@ table .
&quot; in each of the two cases - in which one person in the dark ran on the motorway , it was decided that the drivers do not have to assume that a pedestrian prec@@ edes in the middle of the night on the highway as it was in the newspaper . &quot;
&quot; last year a police officer was acqu@@ itted of the neg@@ ligent killing , having crossed and killed a man who was lying on the A1 at the A1 near Pay@@ erne in August 2014 . &quot;
&quot; the 22 @-@ year @-@ old victim had drunk and has become un@@ conscious on the street , took the court . &quot;
&quot; the court stated that the police officer -- who had responded to a call -- on a justified way , and that the presence of a man on the road was a &quot; completely unusual and unfor@@ es@@ ee@@ able situation , &quot; said the judge . &quot;
anyone who has further information on the incident on Thursday near Morges should report to the police under the number 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 83 46 or 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 44 44 .
NASA Klim@@ am@@ o@@ dell : Venus once habit@@ able
the Venus was probably once habit@@ able according to the proj@@ ections of a new NASA climate model .
scientists at Go@@ dd@@ ard Institute for Space Studies by NASA developed a model to discover the past of Venus based on tools and algorithms similar to those of climate scientists .
&quot; the model was designed to determine whether the Venus with its hot , water @-@ less surface and CO2 @-@ dense atmosphere could have revealed similar conditions . &quot;
scientists have previously indicated that the slow rotation of Venus could be explained by its dense atmosphere .
&quot; but the latest simulation indicates that Venus could have had a thin , er@@ d@@ like atmosphere and still slowly turned on . &quot;
the model also illuminated the top@@ ography of the early Venus .
&quot; the planet probably showed more dry areas than the earth , but once had enough water and geographical vari@@ ability to host life and protected against rapid ev@@ ap@@ oration . &quot;
&quot; the early Venus also benefited from a sun , which was 30 percent matt . &quot;
&quot; in the G@@ ISS model simulation , the slow revolution of Venus trans@@ forms its day @-@ side of the sun for almost two months , &quot; said G@@ ISS scientists Anthony Del Gen@@ io in a press release . &quot;
&quot; this war@@ ms the surface and produces rain , which creates a thick layer of clouds , which acts as a umbrella to shield the surface from a large part of the solar heat . &quot;
the result is average temperatures which are some degrees cooler than that of the Earth today .
&quot; the model produced a history of Venus , which resem@@ bles evolution that was previously presum@@ ed by planetary scientists . &quot;
&quot; although it was probably habit@@ able , Venus was exposed to much heat and ultra@@ violet light over several billions years ago . &quot;
their oceans ev@@ apor@@ ated and their steam was fired from ultra@@ violet light .
&quot; as their hydro@@ gen , only a thick atmosphere with@@ drew from carbon dioxide with a deadly greenhouse effect remained behind -- the Venus , which we know today . &quot;
the researchers shared the results of their new Venus Climate model in Ge@@ ophysi@@ cal Research Let@@ ters .
Patrick Roy coming back as trainer of the Aval@@ an@@ che
Patrick Roy went back on Thursday as a coach and Vice President of Ho@@ ckey Operations of the Colorado Aval@@ an@@ che and led to minor co @-@ determination in the team &apos;s decision @-@ making process .
&quot; alternatively , President / General Manager of the Color@@ ados Joe Sak@@ ic confirmed this decision and noted that the association will immediately look for a new coach . &quot;
&quot; over the past three years I have fulfilled my duties as head coach and Vice President of Ho@@ ckey Operations of the Colorado Aval@@ an@@ che with energy , passion and determination , &quot; the 50 @-@ year @-@ old Roy expressed in a statement . &quot;
&quot; during the summer , I thought about how I could improve this team to give him more depth , it needed and bring it to a higher level . &quot;
&quot; in order to achieve this , the Vision of Train@@ ers and Vice President of Ho@@ ckey Operations must be perfectly matched to the organisation . &quot;
he must also have co @-@ determination in decisions that influence the performance of the team .
these conditions are not being met at the moment .
&quot; Sak@@ ic , who had hired Roy on May 23 , 2013 , thank@@ ed him for his contributions to the team . &quot;
&quot; Patrick informed me today about this decision , &quot; &quot; said Sak@@ ic . &quot;
we appreciate all that he has done for our organization and wish him the best for the future .
Roy won the best trainer of the league during his debut season at the Aval@@ an@@ ches 2013 @-@ 14 as the winner of the Jack Adams Awards .
&quot; he led the association to 112 points and in the first place in Central Vision , but Colorado was defeated in the first round of the pl@@ yo@@ ffs of Minn@@ es@@ ota and missed in each of the last two years the season . &quot;
the Aval@@ an@@ ches recorded a 39 @-@ 39 @-@ 4 brand in the 2015 @-@ 16 season and fell by five points behind the game for a second wild@@ card spot at the Western Conference .
as Hall of F@@ ame Tor@@ wart Roy won four Stan@@ ley C@@ ups -- two pieces with the Montreal Canadi@@ ans and the Aval@@ an@@ che .

&quot; the working struggles for the remun@@ eration for north @-@ sec@@ tari@@ ans will be suspended , while all the parties face the table for a new round of talks , said negoti@@ ators . &quot;
&quot; strikes against the oil field service provider Wood Group were carried out spor@@ adi@@ cally on platforms in the North Sea , operated by Royal Dutch Shell . &quot;
&quot; wood Group as well as the Un@@ ite and R@@ MT trade unions can confirm that we have agreed to restart the process of the current strike , &quot; says it in a common statement . &quot;
&quot; we will stop a few full @-@ day sessions over the next few weeks , beginning next year to restart the problems . &quot;
&quot; the unions said that their last strike , which is the first in over 25 years , is a protest against possible wage cuts of up to 30 percent . &quot;
&quot; this year , Wood Group has reduced its rates to its counter@@ parts in the North Sea by around 9 percent due to negative market pressures . &quot;
the company &apos;s recommendation follows a 10 percent decline for on@@ shore contractors in 2014 .
the company said that additional cuts give the company the required space to get through the market down@@ turn .
&quot; shell has fired thousands of people and announced plans to impose its oil and gas operations in up to 10 countries , as it ration@@ alized its business activities as a result of its mega association with the British energy company BG Group . &quot;
&quot; energy companies are under pressure on the basis of lower crude oil prices under pressure , an economic situation which was reinforced by the decision of the British in June to leave the European Union . &quot;
&quot; the Scottish MEP Dave Anderson met with workers &quot; leaders at the beginning of this week , to discuss one of the biggest labour disputes which took place since a generation in the North Sea . &quot;
&quot; the North Sea is important for the regional economy , he said . &quot;
&quot; in the North Sea and throughout the country we need an economy that works for many and not only for few , &quot; he said in a statement . &quot;

Ke@@ pler measures the rot@@ ational rate of stars in the star @-@ he@@ ap of the P@@ lei@@ ades
the latest mission with the Ke@@ pler space teles@@ cope has helped astronom@@ ers to collect the most complete catalogue of rot@@ ational rates under the stars of the star @-@ raising of the P@@ lei@@ ades .
&quot; the new data will help to understand astronom@@ ers , why stars in star clusters rotate at different rates as well as in which context the rotation periods with planetary development are standing . &quot;
&quot; we hope to learn more about the relationship between the mass of a star , age and even the history of his solar system , &quot; said Lu@@ isa Reb@@ ull , a researcher at the Cal@@ tech &apos;s Infr@@ ared Processing and Analysis Center in Pas@@ ad@@ ena , in a press release . &quot;
the star @-@ he@@ ap of the P@@ lei@@ ades is 445 light years away from the Earth .
&quot; many stars in this cluster , which originated approximately 125 million years ago , are now reaching adul@@ thood . &quot;
you are now turning the fastest .
&quot; at peak rotation rates , these mature stars produce large amounts of star@@ ches . &quot;
&quot; as these winds travel through the magnetic fields of the stars , they have a braking effect on the stars . &quot;
&quot; when a star is aged , its rotation rate begins to slow down . &quot;
Ke@@ pler measures the rate of rotation of each star by recognis@@ ing the time between the appearance of a recogni@@ zable star spot -- such as sun@@ spots -- .
the latest rotary rate catalogue points out that more massive stars turn slower than less massive stars .
&quot; Reb@@ ull compar@@ es the stars with dancers , with bigger stars slowly spin pi@@ rou@@ ettes than smaller ones . &quot;
&quot; in the &quot; Ballet &quot; of the P@@ lei@@ ades we see that slow rot@@ ors tend to be massive , whereas faster rot@@ ors tend to be very bright stars , &quot; &quot; said Reb@@ ull . &quot;
&quot; since the star @-@ he@@ ap of the P@@ lei@@ ades is so close , it serves as an ideal cosmic laboratory to compare stell@@ ar qualities like rot@@ ational rates . &quot;
&quot; the star @-@ pile of the P@@ lei@@ ades offers an anchor for theoretical models of stell@@ ar rotation in both directions , younger and older , &quot; &quot; Reb@@ ull said . &quot;
&quot; there is still much before us what we would like to learn more about how , when and why stars slow down their rotation rates and hang up their &quot; &quot; dance shoes &quot; &quot; so to speak . &quot;
&quot; in three newspaper reports , Reb@@ ull and her colleagues reported in detail about their latest analysis of the rot@@ ational rates of the P@@ lei@@ ades , which soon appear in the Astronom@@ ical Journal . &quot;
a controversial bas@@ eball star occurs
the tears ran with Alex Rodri@@ gu@@ ez faster than the U.S. bas@@ eball star in the best days of Base to Base .
&quot; after his emotional withdrawal , the 41 @-@ year @-@ old professional will be wearing the Tri@@ ko@@ t of his New York Yan@@ ke@@ es last time on August 12 against the T@@ amp@@ a Bay R@@ ays . &quot;
&quot; I love this game and this team . &quot;
&quot; I say good@@ bye &apos; to both , &quot; &quot; said the 14 @-@ time All @-@ Star @-@ Game @-@ participant of the Major League Bas@@ eball ( ML@@ B ) . &quot;
&quot; three times , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez was elected to the most valuable player in the league , in 2009 he won the Yan@@ ke@@ es World Series . &quot;
his signature under a tenth year agreement made him $ 27 million annually since 2007 .
&quot; until the end of the contract on 31 December 2017 , he will act as a consultant and youth coach in the future - with full salary . &quot;
&quot; as a player , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez paid a long time with performance . &quot;
&quot; with 6@@ 96 hom@@ er@@ us , 3@@ 114 hits and 2021 counts for his teams ( &quot; R@@ uns &quot; ) for the Seattle Marin@@ ers ( 1994 @-@ 2000 ) , Texas Rang@@ ers ( 2001 until 2004 ) and since 2005 he managed the Yan@@ ke@@ es a few mil@@ estones . &quot;
&quot; with the Hall @-@ of @-@ F@@ ame members H@@ ank Aaron and Wil@@ lie M@@ ays , only two other bas@@ eball players have similar values in the most important statistics . &quot;
&quot; however , the 41 @-@ year @-@ old should not be included in the hall of the Bas@@ eb@@ alls . &quot;
&quot; because so successful Rodri@@ gu@@ ez - nick@@ name &quot; A @-@ Rod &quot; - was on the field , so controversial is his appearance outside the place . &quot;
&quot; already in 2009 , the Super@@ star appeared at &quot; ES@@ PN , &quot; between 2001 and 2003 banned ster@@ oids . &quot;
&quot; in August 2013 , he was closed for 211 games due to a winding up in the so @-@ called Bio@@ gen@@ esis sc@@ andal . &quot;
Rodri@@ gu@@ ez is considered the main susp@@ ect to have received high @-@ performance funding for years on an anti @-@ aging clinic in South Florida .
&quot; after a legal dispute , the lock was still reduced to 162 meetings . &quot;
&quot; the League could even have done a favor for 2014 , as I played through 20 years without a break , &quot; &quot; Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , then , ad@@ mi@@ red at that time . &quot;
his f@@ arewell @-@ days are not no@@ is@@ eless .
&quot; while many bas@@ eball legend has once again received the big stage in their last games , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez frequently had to sit on the bench . &quot;
&quot; my job does not include a f@@ arewell tour . &quot;
&quot; my job includes the attempt to win any game , &quot; k@@ itt@@ ens Yan@@ ke@@ es @-@ coach Joe Gir@@ ar@@ di . &quot;
&quot; after all , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , who was married to the act@@ ress Cameron Di@@ az and said to the circumstances with Pop@@ star Madonna and act@@ ress Kate Hudson , was the sympathy of the fans of the Yan@@ ke@@ e @-@ Erz@@ riv@@ ale Boston Red So@@ x . &quot;
&quot; we want A @-@ Rod , &quot; the supporters of the 4 : 9 defeat against the Rodri@@ gu@@ ez @-@ Team . &quot;
&quot; Olympia 2016 : chen X@@ in@@ yi , Sil@@ wi@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ owa and Adrian Ziel@@ inski are the first dop@@ ing cases &quot;
&quot; caught : because of a positive dop@@ ing sample , wei@@ ght@@ li@@ fter Adrian Ziel@@ inski from Poland can not start in Rio . &quot;
Rio de Janeiro - The Olympic Games 2016 are over@@ shad@@ owed by the first official d@@ op@@ ing@@ es .
a wis@@ er athle@@ tic would have won almost a medal .
&quot; before the seventh competition day , the first official d@@ op@@ ing@@ cases have become known for the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro . &quot;
&quot; the Chinese float in Ch@@ en X@@ in@@ yi , 3000 metres steep@@ le steep@@ le in Sil@@ wi@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ ova from Bulgaria and the Polish wei@@ ght@@ li@@ fter Adrian Ziel@@ inski were positively tested and excluded - immediately before the start of the already critical athle@@ tics cont@@ ests , these messages come to the unknown . &quot;
&quot; in Ch@@ en , last Sunday , the di@@ ure@@ tic hydro@@ chlor@@ ot@@ hi@@ azi@@ de has been proven to be used as a mas@@ king agent for dop@@ ing substances . &quot;
the International Sports Court of Barcelona confirmed its exclusion from the Olympic Games on Friday afternoon .
&quot; on Sunday , the 18 @-@ year @-@ old occupied fourth place in the final over 100 m Butter@@ fly , only by 0.0@@ 9 seconds , she missed the bronze medal . &quot;
&quot; on Friday , Ch@@ en would have to take part in the courses over 50 m Fre@@ estyle . &quot;
&quot; at the International Olympic Committee ( IO@@ C ) , the opening of the B trial and a hearing was applied . &quot;
&quot; the national association takes the matter &quot; &quot; very seriously and demands full cooperation in the investigations , &quot; &quot; quoted X@@ in@@ hua from a message : &quot; &quot; we will work with the International Sports Court CAS and will accept the judgment . &quot;
&quot; for the first time in history , the IO@@ C is no longer responsible for the san@@ ction of athletes with positive cases . &quot;
&quot; in the night of Rio , news about the positive test at Dan@@ ek@@ ova was le@@ aking up , the 33 @-@ year @-@ old went into the offensive . &quot;
&quot; I had three tests , all negative , and my fourth test was positive , &quot; &quot; this was an incredible shock , &quot; &quot; she said to the Bulgarian TV station B@@ NT . &quot;
&quot; she was innocent , &quot; the only explanation could be dietary supplements , &quot; explained the ath@@ l@@ ete . &quot;
&quot; according to the report , the prohibited substance is to deal with the blood dop@@ ing agent EP@@ O . &quot;
&quot; Dan@@ ek@@ ova was temporarily suspended , according to B@@ NT , the B @-@ Probe should also have been positive . &quot;
Bulgaria &apos;s Prime Minister Boy@@ ko Bor@@ is@@ so@@ v reported immediately with criticism of the Athle@@ tin .
&quot; I don &apos;t understand why the athletes don &apos;t pull the right conclusions , &quot; he said : &quot; we Bulg@@ arians are under observation , so many have already been excluded . &quot;
&quot; in this way , all wei@@ ght@@ li@@ fters of the chronic dop@@ ing @-@ loaded nation may not take part in Rio . &quot;
&quot; on Friday the case &quot; Adrian Ziel@@ inski &quot; was also known , the London Olympic champion in the class up to 85 kg was tested positive on the an@@ abolic ster@@ oid N@@ and@@ rol@@ on three days earlier . &quot;
&quot; both deny the intake , but both are not allowed to start in the class up to 94 kg . &quot;
&quot; before starting the athletes , the Dan@@ ek@@ ova case is another serious blow to the reputation of the whole sport . &quot;
&quot; the World Federation of I@@ A@@ AF had forbidden the whole Russian team to an exception because of systematic dop@@ ing , even the Kenya &apos;s birth of Kenya produces numerous bad news in Rio . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the previous contracts in China had also taken care of fierce battles among the athletes . &quot;
the Fren@@ ch@@ man Cam@@ ille Lac@@ our@@ t attacked the Chinese Olympi@@ asi@@ eger Sun Yang har@@ sch .
&quot; sun Yang p@@ ink@@ ed purple . &quot;
&quot; when I see the podium over 200 m Fre@@ estyle , I want to pass , &quot; Lac@@ our@@ t said in the French radio . &quot;
sun was also the focal point of a debate with Austr@@ ali@@ ans M@@ ack H@@ orton .
&quot; I have no time and no respect for dop@@ ing dec@@ ei@@ vers , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; sun was positively tested by the Chinese champ@@ ionships in 2014 for the stimul@@ ant tri@@ meth@@ azi@@ din , but had to sit only a three @-@ month lock . &quot;

&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
40 percent of the victims readily paid the sol@@ dering required by the perpetr@@ ators to be able to use the systems and data challenged .
&quot; according to the observations of mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes , the perpetr@@ ators speci@@ alize in attacks in corporate networks . &quot;
&quot; if they are successful there , the potentially explosive ran@@ som is significantly higher than for private users . &quot;
&quot; we are currently watching a fri@@ ghtening rapid evolution of the damage software , &quot; explains Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes Chief Mar@@ cin K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski in conversation with the &quot; world . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in 2008 , most of the painting programs were designed to send advertising . &quot;
then the perpetr@@ ators discovered black@@ mailing software for themselves .
&quot; first of all , private users were the target , but the change to company attacks was horri@@ fying in the past few months . &quot;
&quot; Ran@@ som@@ ware works according to a simple pattern : once active on the computer of a victim , it searches for long @-@ changed files such as word@@ - , Excel or database files , as well as archi@@ ved images and videos . &quot;
these files enco@@ des the Ran@@ som@@ ware and delet@@ es the origin@@ als sustain@@ ably .
the software then presents the recei@@ v@@ ables of the black@@ mail .
&quot; to get the final encryption code to the files , the victim must transfer money - mostly in the form of Cryp@@ to@@ currencies Bit@@ coin . &quot;
&quot; but where private users have the personal photo database on the game , companies are concerned about sensitive customer data or project databases , without which production is shut down . &quot;
&quot; accordingly , the damage occurs when a ran@@ som@@ ware strikes . &quot;
&quot; 22 percent of the affected German companies reported revenue losses due to ran@@ som@@ ware , 13 percent even had to complete the business operation completely , in one case people were in danger of living . &quot;
&quot; in Germany , several hospitals already had victims of attacks whose patients could be threatened by the loss of patient records . &quot;
&quot; we always say to the victims : pay not , you only funding the problem , &quot; K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski explains . &quot;
&quot; but 80 to 90 percent of the companies , who pay , get their data back . &quot;
&quot; for managers , it is difficult to reject the perpetr@@ ator &apos;s claim in the face of stand@@ still in operation . &quot;
the h@@ ack@@ ers again know this and try to build a good reputation .
&quot; in an up @-@ to @-@ date study , the safety researchers of F @-@ Secure have investigated the usage areas and contact with the black@@ jack and come to the result : the perpetr@@ ators are actually trying to build a kind of customer service to take more money . &quot;
&quot; they explain their victims via chat , how they can pay by Bit@@ coin , set freely accessible support websites or dec@@ ryp@@ t for free sample files . &quot;
&quot; and if private people rede@@ em payments of only a few hundred euros , companies must negotiate some hard and pay five @-@ digit sums to get their data un@@ encrypted . &quot;
&quot; in view of the potentially high and relatively ris@@ ky profits from Ran@@ som@@ ware black@@ mail the h@@ ack@@ ers become more professional and share the work , explains safety expert Ch@@ ester Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski from the antivirus provider SO@@ PH@@ OS : &quot; a single person can write a ran@@ som@@ ware about within a week . &quot;
&quot; however , it is more likely that it is three or four persons . &quot;
the program@@ mers sell their damage software then in the form of a software construction kit to the actual black@@ mail .
&quot; the previous malware kits have been created by buying the malware , advice and additional tools for a single , fixed price between $ 1000 and $ 10,000 . &quot;
&quot; included in delivery is a custom@@ ization tool , so that smaller configurations , appearance and br@@ anding can be changed , &quot; says Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski . &quot;
the black@@ mail@@ ers then look for further h@@ ack@@ ers to spread the newly purchased software among the victims .
we live in a service sector .
&quot; so one logs in one of the forums on the ground , bu@@ ys the set from a criminal and commissioned another to install the software on as many PCs as possible . &quot;
payment will be made per infected computer .
&quot; usually the crimin@@ als instruc@@ t sp@@ amm@@ ers with the dis@@ sem@@ ination , &quot; explains Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski . &quot;
the risk of Ran@@ som@@ ware is now well @-@ known among many companies that better secure their data .
more than 50 percent of the companies IT managers in the Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes survey trust Ran@@ som@@ ware to be able to rep@@ el Ran@@ som@@ ware by means of file @-@ back @-@ ups and scanner software .
&quot; accordingly , the perpetr@@ ators are already pursuing new strategies . &quot;
&quot; if the encryption of data alone is not a sufficient threat to successful recovery , the perpetr@@ ators are instead threatening to publish sensitive data such as customer lists or price calculations , &quot; explains Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes Chief Mar@@ cin K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski . &quot;
&quot; this means the potential for damage , depending on the type of data , is much higher than before . &quot;
&quot; in the future , the perpetr@@ ators could also fully adopt new goals on the internet of things . &quot;
&quot; on the Def@@ Con chip conference , security researchers demonstrated how they could get a thermo@@ stat connected to the Internet under their control . &quot;
&quot; in the middle of the winter , the activation of such a blocked heating could well be worth a ran@@ som . &quot;
&quot; if the perpetr@@ ators then block a whole production line in a factory instead of heating in the future , Ran@@ som@@ ware could also be a topic in Industry 4.0 . &quot;
one for all cases
Honda HR @-@ V is flexible and suitable for everyday use
&quot; in the small HR @-@ V Honda will pack everything : a little SU@@ V , a little cou@@ pe and also the versatility of a mini@@ v@@ ans . &quot;
&quot; sounds pretty much over@@ loaded , but the HR @-@ V , which was constructed on the same new platform as the new jazz , actually proves to be extremely flexible in everyday life . &quot;
&quot; although the only 1.@@ 60 m high HR @-@ V looks rather small , the passengers have plenty of space both in the first row and in the rear . &quot;
&quot; the materials of the interior are well processed and have a pleasant effect , only the cock@@ pit top is falling down . &quot;
more versatile than comparable vehicles the HR @-@ V is the storage space .
&quot; there is not only a trunk of 453 l available for up @-@ to @-@ date and 10@@ 26 l in reverse back@@ rests , but there is the &quot; Magic Se@@ ats . &quot; &quot;
&quot; this is less magical than it sounds : the seat surfaces of the rear bench can be folded like k@@ ett@@ les and thus offer storage space , which is 1,@@ 24 m high from the floor to the ceiling . &quot;
&quot; the trunk can be loaded well , but the loading height of 650 mm is slightly higher than the comparable Peugeot 2008 . &quot;
the tested 1.6 @-@ liter diesel with 88 kW / 120 HP acceler@@ ates HR @-@ V thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm in wide speed ranges .
&quot; however , he should do his work somewhat qui@@ eter . &quot;
the daily consumption of 4.7 l / 100 km is enjoyable .
there is another engine type : a 1.5 @-@ litre petrol engine with 96 kW / 130 hp .
a four @-@ wheel drive is not offered .
&quot; driving behavior is balanced , a good compromise between dynamics and comfort . &quot;
but the steering should be a bit more direct .
&quot; in the tested Top @-@ version &quot; Executive , &quot; the equipment is not desired . &quot;
&quot; the safety systems include the City Not@@ ting Assistant ( works up to tempo 32 ) , the col@@ lision warning system and the lane assist assistant . &quot;
the col@@ lision war@@ ner sometimes irrit@@ ates because he evalu@@ ates many obstacles as &quot; approaching objects . &quot;
very reliable the high @-@ beam assistant works .
and the intelligent temp@@ er re@@ acts to the traffic sign detection and th@@ rot@@ tle the speed when needed .
&quot; the full connectivity is only available for the top features : 7 @-@ inch touch@@ screen , navigation device , app integration and more . &quot;
two US@@ B- and an HDMI jack are under the arm@@ rest and are therefore somewhat cum@@ ber@@ some to achieve .
the approximately 29@@ 000 euros for the well @-@ equipped top @-@ dies@@ els are fine .
&quot; those who don &apos;t want to invest so much will receive the gasoline of 20,000 euros , the diesel from 2@@ 3000 euros . &quot;
the engines comply with the Euro 6 emissions standard .
&quot; with the HR @-@ V , Honda offers a versatile and everyday car . &quot;
Air@@ line is not liable : down@@ fall on passenger lift bridge
an airline is not liable for the fall of a passenger on the passenger bridge .
&quot; the Higher Regional Court of Düsseldorf ( A@@ z . : 18 U 124 / 14 ) argued that liability is conceivable only for haz@@ ards , which are typical of air traffic . &quot;
the plain@@ ti@@ ff had broken a knee injury during the fall .
&quot; however , the accident could have happened everywhere - it is a common risk of life , such as judgment . &quot;
the airline had to pay no compensation to the man .
case of disease : when paid by the organis@@ er
&quot; after their trip , vac@@ ation@@ ers only get money back if the cause of the disease is dou@@ bt@@ lessly found in the hotel . &quot;
&quot; however , this is only the case if more than ten percent of the guests have proven to show the same symptoms . &quot;
&quot; in this case , a family was severely ill in di@@ arr@@ he@@ a and v@@ om@@ iting on the second day of their tur@@ f holiday . &quot;
she spent almost the whole holiday in the room .
&quot; their condition was caused by the vac@@ ation@@ ers on a defective sewage plant , which allegedly poll@@ uted the sea water . &quot;
&quot; the family was the view , the journey was therefore poor - and compl@@ ained against the organis@@ er . &quot;
&quot; before the court , the plain@@ ti@@ ffs had no success . &quot;
&quot; in fact , the sewage treatment was indeed defective . &quot;
but the organizer took only shortly before departure of the plain@@ ti@@ ffs .
until then he had to assume that the sea water was fine .
&quot; so he did not viol@@ ate his duties , so the verdi@@ ct . &quot;
especially since no contamination has been found in the water samples .
the disease of several hotel guests - possibly by cont@@ ag@@ ment among each other - belongs to the general risk of living .
only 38 people were sick of 6@@ 91 guests .
&quot; the Mai@@ zi@@ ère said , after the violence committed by refugees in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach in July , many people were worried about further attacks . &quot;
the state must be headed and resolved at the same time to terrorist attacks .
&quot; sure , our country will not answer the violence of the perpetr@@ ators with hatred and division . &quot;
we won &apos;t grant this triumph to the terrorists .
&quot; if offen@@ ders had to leave the country faster , however , the security and strength also increase the approval of the population for refugee policy . &quot;
de Mai@@ zi@@ ère aims to implement the proposals until the elections of the Bundestag in 2017 .
&quot; he also announced further personal rein@@ forcement of the security forces , namely &quot; in medium @-@ four size order over several years . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; for terrorism for terrorism must be punished again . &quot;
&quot; video surveillance is to be improved , the ce@@ as@@ ef@@ ire can be amended in such a way that it is especially difficult to buy weapons on the Internet . &quot;
the last much discussed Schwei@@ ge@@ pf@@ licht for doctors should stay in accordance with de Mai@@ zi@@ ères words .
&quot; however , he wants to look for solutions in dialogue with the medical profession , as the endanger@@ ment of the citizens can be reduced , he said with a look at some mental ab@@ norm@@ alities . &quot;
&quot; in order to counter@@ act the radic@@ alization of refugees , the Minister considers a better social support . &quot;
teachers need to be better prepared for dealing with trau@@ mati@@ sed people .
&quot; in order to prosec@@ ute crimin@@ als in special areas of the Internet ( Dark@@ net ) , de Mai@@ zi@@ ère is planning the use of cover@@ t investig@@ ators . &quot;
&quot; SPD leader Gabriel said : &quot; &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything that contributes to further increase security . &quot;
it is important that the Interior Minister clearly declared himself against shareholders .
&quot; that was a sla@@ p for the sni@@ per in the CD@@ U / CS@@ U , &quot; Gabriel said to the newspapers of the Fun@@ ke Media Group ( Friday ) . &quot;
de Mai@@ zi@@ ère had rejected calls from the Union after a b@@ anning ban and the ab@@ olition of double citizenship before .
he considers that a general prohibition of full @-@ wear is un@@ constitutional .
&quot; one cannot prohi@@ bit everything that one re@@ jects , and I rest the wearing of the bur@@ ka . &quot;
talking about rules about road traffic or for witnesses to court .
&quot; green @-@ boss Simone Peter designed the minister , he wanted to simul@@ ate action with ever new anti @-@ terror packages and ability to act . &quot;
&quot; left @-@ party leader Bernd Ri@@ ex@@ inger said : &quot; &quot; fleet Pro@@ verb@@ s and a ti@@ ghtening of the right of residence bring people in this country no more security . &quot;
better traffic flow on the motorway
it is regularly st@@ owed on the change @-@ way - here &apos;s a picture of November .
but this should change : the rule of law should be extended .
&quot; this is a good news for all car drivers who are driving in traffic on the ambient route every evening in the traffic jam , when they ride via the motorway : Zu@@ br@@ inger ( A 43 ) . &quot;
&quot; on the next Tuesday and Wednesday ( 16th / 17th August ) in the area between the Hammer road and the descent Wes@@ eler Strasse , road construction extends the right @-@ bending path by 700 meters . &quot;
drivers can then cycle directly from the Hammer road on the right .
&quot; the big advantage : the traffic divi@@ des itself as early as possible , thereby improving the entire workflow on the many @-@ driven section of the federal road 51 . &quot;
&quot; the idea with the extended exit had the CD@@ U Group in the district &quot; &quot; Münster @-@ West &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the road transport on the Zu@@ br@@ inger is anno@@ ying the drivers especially between 17 and 19 o &apos;clock .
&quot; on week@@ days , the return au reaches the bridge over the Alber@@ slo@@ h way and sometimes also beyond . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , the needle pipe on B 51 is short before the exit Wes@@ eler street . &quot;
&quot; from here , traffic will only be guided single @-@ gauge via the motorway bridge . &quot;
the second track had to be rec@@ eded before a good one @-@ three years ago .
&quot; the reason : static calculations had shown that the bridge no longer has the required load capacity , in order to absorb heavy load traffic . &quot;
&quot; as long as this bott@@ len@@ eck and the associated traffic jam will continue , the relevant state operation cannot be said . &quot;
&quot; however , with years to reck@@ on : because the bridge has an official remaining period up to 20@@ 34 . &quot;
&quot; for the extension of the rule of law , the state company deliberately chose the traffic @-@ weaker time during the school holidays because with disabilities it is expected . &quot;
the traffic will be passed on Tuesday and on Wednesday at the construction site .
intercultural Travel : cultural activities for schools
&quot; the international class of the Wald@@ schule attended the play &quot; &quot; The invisible house &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the association N@@ ima &apos;s and the Junge Theater are now planning a music project .
N@@ ima &apos;s association enables young people to visit cultural institutions in Münster .
&quot; the &quot; &quot; Class International &quot; &quot; of the Wald@@ schule Children &apos;s House has visited a presentation of the award @-@ winning piece &quot; &quot; The invisible house &quot; &quot; of the boy theatre Münster . &quot;
&quot; in the context of the &quot; Inter@@ cultural journey &quot; initiated by the association N@@ ima &apos;s &quot; Inter@@ cultural Travel , &quot; 19 students from 11 to 15 years visited the st@@ aging in the Small House . &quot;
&quot; since the beginning of the year , the association , which aims to promote cultural integration of young people with a migration and refugee background , offers schools with welcome classes to visit cultural institutions in Münster within the framework of this project . &quot;
&quot; most young people in the class have come to Münster between September 2015 and March 2016 , among others from Afghanistan , Iran , Serbia and Syria . &quot;
&quot; thanks to the chore@@ ographies , the scenic pics and video animations it was possible for them to follow the course of action nevertheless , thus the press release of the boy theatre Münster . &quot;
&quot; the association N@@ ima &apos;s , founded by Dr. Tann@@ az West@@ er@@ berg of Spra@@ kel , and the Young Theater will work together in the upcoming season as part of a music theatre project . &quot;
&quot; from October to December young people with and without fluid and migration background are to be given the opportunity to attend professionally guided courses in the fields of singing , dancing , acting and music . &quot;
offers for children and families in the area of theatre play and theat@@ rical language education are planned .
the project &quot; Inter@@ cultural journey &quot; continues .
&quot; in view of the increased refugee figures , the association expects many classes to participate . &quot;
rain instead of star schn@@ u@@ ppen : hope to improve weather
the weather has made the star schn@@ u@@ ppen @-@ Gu@@ ck@@ ern in the south @-@ west of Germany in the night to Friday a line through the bill - but there is still hope .
&quot; the night was bad for clouds and rain to watch the cel@@ esti@@ al spectacle , said the chair@@ woman of the observ@@ atory Wel@@ z@@ heim , Hans @-@ Ulrich Keller , on Friday morning . &quot;
our hope is on the night to Saturday .
&quot; the weather is supposed to be good , then we will see many star schn@@ aps in the sky . &quot;
&quot; the star @-@ shed is Per@@ sei@@ den , which are among the fastest star schn@@ u@@ ppen with 216@@ ,000 kilometers per hour . &quot;
&quot; they have their names , because they seem to come from the con@@ stellation Per@@ se@@ us , which goes up in the north @-@ east . &quot;
relaxing night : tips for sleeping disorders
&quot; in the evenings , you roll around forever , at night you are awake for hours , in the morning you can &apos;t think of sleep long before the wake @-@ up ring . &quot;
this is anything but relaxing .
&quot; after all , one is in good company with such problems : according to the Robert Koch Institute , about a quarter of adults sleep disorders and more than ten percent find their sleep frequently or permanently than not relaxing . &quot;
how do sleep problems or sleep disorders manifest ?
&quot; there are several forms of sleep disorders , and it can be based on various causes , Hans @-@ Günter We@@ eks , member of the German Society for Schla@@ ef@@ ree and Sleep Medicine . &quot;
&quot; what one does not understand , however , is the in@@ som@@ nia , i.e. an in- and sleep distur@@ b@@ ance . &quot;
&quot; the di@@ arr@@ ho@@ ea feel many people as uns@@ atis@@ factory or insufficient , says Jens Wagner ne@@ cht , member of the board of the German Medical Association with practice in the Lower Saxony Var@@ el . &quot;
what is behind sleep disorders ?
the causes of sleep disorders are complex .
&quot; there can be organic , mental or behavi@@ our@@ al factors , but also medicines . &quot;
in@@ frequently the sleeping disorder is an expression of another condition .
&quot; very early wake up is often common in depression , &quot; said We@@ eks . &quot;
and it can be that different factors are wor@@ rying each other .
&quot; who , for example , has a her@@ ni@@ ated disc , can lie poor@@ ly , w@@ akes up every two to three hours and possibly starts to pon@@ der about everyday problems and worries , there is an example . &quot;
&quot; this leads to tension , and sleep is no longer possible . &quot;
when should you go to a doctor with sleep disorders ?
&quot; who does not sleep well over a period of one month in at least three nights a week and is com@@ promised the day , should go to the doctor , av@@ ant@@ eed We@@ eks . &quot;
&quot; the imp@@ airment can look quite different : one is down@@ cast , tired , drow@@ ned , has difficulty with the attention and concentration , is easily irrit@@ able , has mood sw@@ ings or physical ail@@ ments like stomach or head@@ aches . &quot;
&quot; to alle@@ vi@@ ate sleeping disorder , it is important to find out their causes . &quot;
&quot; the treatment options include behavi@@ our@@ al changes , cognitive behavi@@ our@@ al therapy or also medicines - classical sleeping pills only in exceptional cases and at most for two weeks - in@@ question . &quot;
&quot; there is hardly any sleep medicine in Germany , empha@@ sizes Prof. Ingo Fi@@ etze , head of the interdisciplinary medicine centre of Char@@ ité Universitäts@@ medizin Berlin . &quot;
&quot; therefore , in case of sleeping problems , one should first turn to the GP , av@@ ant@@ eed oil . &quot;
it can determine if the problems have a physical cause .
&quot; who should go to sleep lab , and what happens ? &quot;
&quot; for examination in the sleep laboratory , doctors advise physicians for example in snor@@ ing with breathing problems , in case of illness or if one does not find the cause of a sleeping disorder , explains fi@@ en@@ ity . &quot;
you do not have to prepare for the examination .
you should spend the day normally .
&quot; only please do not make a n@@ ap sleep , &quot; says Fi@@ esta . &quot;
&quot; after cab@@ ling , one goes to bed at its normal time . &quot;
&quot; besides the electrodes on the body , you wear a nas@@ al g@@ og@@ gles , a chest strap and a fe@@ asting on the finger . &quot;
&quot; in addition , a camera at the ceiling shows the sleeping places . &quot;
how can people get a grip on the problems ?
there are quite a lot of screws where you can get a better sleep .

what the jungle camp with missing medals in swimming has to have
the former German swi@@ mmer Markus Dei@@ bler posted a dis@@ ap@@ pointing out of the DS@@ V team at Olymp@@ is via Facebook .
&quot; in December 2014 , he first took gold in Doh@@ a for the first time in Doh@@ a and at the same time presented his first world record . &quot;
&quot; now , the former DS@@ V ath@@ l@@ ete Markus Dei@@ bler submitted a protective visor to the former team @-@ mates in front of his colleagues in the cri@@ tique . &quot;
&quot; in a country where an Olympic winner gets 20,000 € bonus and a jungle King 150@@ .000 € should no one wonder about missing medals , &quot; the 26 @-@ year @-@ old wrote at night on his Facebook page . &quot;
&quot; the conveyor system in the swimming pool is bad , but the dop@@ ing controls are very good . &quot;
&quot; in this way , we cannot compete with countries that promote a great deal and do not see so closely at the topic of dop@@ ing , or even operate it . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t say that controls should be set here , &quot; he explained . &quot;
&quot; if he wanted to make a com@@ eback , Dei@@ bler would have to be registered nine months before his first launch of the National Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency Germany ( NA@@ DA ) . &quot;
this is exactly how you should keep it with countries .

airport : Ban@@ de of Bag@@ gage Speci@@ es arrested
professional thi@@ eves at the Düsseldorf Airport
&quot; on Thursday , the police arrested two women and two men at the age of 50 to 61 . &quot;
the susp@@ ects had committed several hand@@ ker@@ chiefs and bag ste@@ els as a gang .
&quot; at 9 : 30 a.m. civil servants in the area of the Düsseldorf Airport called a gang , which was known by the police officers of past theft . &quot;
&quot; the two women and two men had committed several del@@ ik@@ es since the middle of July and were , in a community , work @-@ y and particularly professional . &quot;
&quot; the specialists of the Criminal Com@@ miss@@ ari@@ ate 34 are able to demonstrate four actions , especially for off@@ setting criminal off@@ ences to Germany . &quot;
&quot; in the process , they had acquired a total of more than 15,000 Euros . &quot;
&quot; old buildings , a few lin@@ den trees , in between and a rest of the cob@@ ble@@ stone pav@@ ement : the Riga Street in Berlin @-@ Friedrichsha@@ in does not affect the first sight , but the police are one of the &quot; &quot; dangerous places &quot; &quot; of the city . &quot;
&quot; along the road from the east to the west , one gets past play@@ grounds , a newly painted kinder@@ garten and a bi@@ ol@@ ades . &quot;
on the facade of a grey house someone has &quot; ug@@ ly ! &quot; spra@@ yed .
&quot; opposite of a Li@@ dl , which is to be dem@@ ol@@ ished soon , is already built : until 2017 a house with high windows and 133 new apartments will be built here . &quot;
&quot; article about this &quot; &quot; trendy district &quot; , &quot; as the responsible real estate company Friedrichsha@@ in calls , however , is preferred over the last few weeks with burning cars . &quot;
&quot; the reason is the house with number 94 : once it was occupied , the inhabitants rented rental contracts , but on the ground floor there are still rooms occupied and are used for events . &quot;
&quot; since the beginning of the year , especially the Berlin In@@ sen@@ ator H@@ enkel recorded several times for a tough action by the police against the project , the area called &quot; no @-@ go @-@ zone &quot; for polic@@ emen and 94 as the starting point of autonomous violence . &quot;
&quot; after 22 June , the rooms on the ground floor , the ca@@ det s@@ mi@@ ths , with 300 police officers were cleared , pat@@ rou@@ il@@ ised the police three weeks ago with 30 to 40 civil servants and three crew cars on site , locked parts of the street and held visitors from entering the house with number 94 . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , construction workers renovated the premises on behalf of the unknown house owners . &quot;
&quot; on 13 July , a Berlin Administr@@ ative Court decided that the clearance was illegal , and a day later police and construction workers went down under the che@@ ers of sympath@@ iz@@ ers and residents . &quot;
&quot; this summer afternoon , the street works peac@@ efully : parents walk with children , people sit on the pav@@ ement in front of the houses in the sun , others are talking vor@@ m Sp@@ ät@@ i . &quot;
&quot; in the immediate vicinity of the building projects , there is a primary school and kinder@@ gart@@ ens . &quot;
&quot; lef@@ tist violence is not the main concern of many residents : Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who lives in the Kie@@ z since 1999 , and Jan@@ a * , who plays three children here , are mostly gener@@ alized by the police presence . &quot;
&quot; with the inhabitants of the house projects , they share the concern of rising r@@ ents and gent@@ ri@@ fication . &quot;
&quot; it doesn &apos;t sound like a Kie@@ z , who wanted to bring about a majority police protection from the v@@ andal@@ ous left . &quot;
&quot; the dit@@ ch , which the Berlin interior sen@@ ator and the police between house @-@ occup@@ iers and their neighbours , apparently does not exist . &quot;
&quot; in the east of Berlin Friedrichsha@@ in , in the east of Berlin , was actually a traditional working @-@ class neighborhood , which today compared to the rest of the city , has a low average income and a high risk of poverty . &quot;
&quot; in 1990 , numerous houses were occupied in the former East German Democratic Republic , including almost the entire Main@@ zer Straße close to Riga . &quot;
&quot; while the Main@@ zer had been cleared by a large police force in a right direction of road , many of the projects were leg@@ alized in Riga and are partly occupied by the people who occupied them 26 years ago . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , in recent years , the district has become a magnet for tourists and elec@@ tive lin@@ ers from all over the world . &quot;
&quot; this is also noticeable in the r@@ ents , which have risen by almost 60 per cent since 2009 . &quot;
&quot; many of the new buildings in Riga are being attacked as symbols for this development : they recognize them at raised disks or newly painted faç@@ ades , which were disc@@ ar@@ ded with color @-@ bags . &quot;
&quot; no other road was mentioned this year as often as &quot; &quot; left @-@ wing violence &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; a reason for not all neighbours to consider this as a problem could be that they are not necessarily affected by crimin@@ ality : crimes like bodily injury , statistics are according to statistics almost exclusively against polic@@ emen . &quot;
&quot; the most part of the crimes do property damage , which tend to meet new buildings and newly renovated houses . &quot;
&quot; for Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who has been living in a house for 17 years , next to the controversial 94 , there is no talk of uncertainty . &quot;
&quot; as for acts of violence , it is wei@@ ght@@ lifting : the people in 94 are their neighbours , they have not been this . &quot;
the famous burning cars are no longer available in Riga .
&quot; for the architect , her road is not a criminal focus , on the contrary : &quot; here one helps each other , lives together on the road and gets more from each other than elsewhere . &quot;
Neu@@ geb@@ auer is deliberately drawn into Riga &apos;s street - and stayed .
&quot; for this reason , it was also so important that local residents returned to their streets : from the police , politics and the media , all of them suddenly claimed the interpretation of the interpretation of the city . &quot;
&quot; but in the eyes of residents like Neu@@ geb@@ auer , the road continues to be taken away : through fac@@ eless new buildings in former buildings that displ@@ ace the old inhabitants . &quot;
&quot; these are ultimately con@@ dom@@ ini@@ ums , which are not interesting for many - here are rather people who are not so well @-@ dri@@ fted , &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; violence and destruction can I absolutely not appro@@ ve . &quot;
but what should one do if someone has never listened to ?
&quot; there is fru@@ stration on all sides , including the police and the inhabitants . &quot;
&quot; Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer has little understanding of those drawn about color bombs , Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer has little understanding : the home projects and the left scene belonged to the neighbourhood . &quot;
&quot; who pul@@ ls out , should be aware of it - just like someone who pul@@ ls into a pub area , can badly compl@@ ain about noise there . &quot;
all persons presented only with the first names have asked to not be called with their proper name .
Ur@@ bach : Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le is new refugee @-@ commission@@ er
Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le is the contact person for integration and organis@@ er .
she is also a social worker on site .
Anni@@ ka Deu@@ le has been the refugee representative for Ur@@ bach since July .
the social ped@@ agog@@ ue supports the team of the administration around Ach@@ im Gro@@ cken@@ berger .
&quot; she sees herself as a contact for all actors : refugees , working group refugee assistance , administration , authorities , and anyone else . &quot;
&quot; Reg@@ ine client from the working circle indicates that the volunteers are more than grateful that Deu@@ sch@@ le is now there , the ei@@ ving Woll@@ mil@@ ch@@ sau , who has a problem above all . &quot;
&quot; in this way , some - less mo@@ cking than rather on the multitude of desired tasks had been targeted - meant as the administration wanted to write the job . &quot;
&quot; looking for an administrative manager with a talent for languages and people , connected with a long @-@ standing experience in the field of social work , an ins@@ ult of Woll@@ mil@@ ch@@ sau . &quot;
&quot; however , administrative work is not its central area , says Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le . &quot;
&quot; above all , it is about organization , work with people on site and also behind the scenes as well as network activity . &quot;
the 31 @-@ year @-@ old has been there for about six weeks .
it has a 50 @-@ percent position limited to three years .
&quot; it was high time , &quot; says Reg@@ ine Client , that Anni@@ ka Deu@@ le supports honest and full @-@ time actors . &quot;
&quot; there are large and small problems , organizational , human and understanding problems . &quot;
&quot; soon , new containers are available in the washing way . &quot;
it has been a serious problem for some time to find apartments for connecting refugees that have been recognized .
the municipalities are responsible for the connection installation .
they have to accommodate the refugees in their own or rented flats .
&quot; the costs for the construction , rent or renovation of these accommodations must bear the commun@@ es themselves . &quot;
the responsibility is changed from the Council of Agriculture to the Commun@@ e and Job@@ centre .
&quot; problem : there are free objects , but not every landlord wants to offer his apartment . &quot;
the search has been very difficult for some time .
&quot; de facto , the administration does not find any private apartments . &quot;
&quot; so far , it does not work so far , if one relies on private apartments , Deu@@ sch@@ le . &quot;
&quot; therefore , communities must be encouraged as it is so beautiful . &quot;
new containers will soon be set up in the basin .
but only with apartments it is not done .
&quot; perspective is the keyword , Reg@@ ine client and Anni@@ ka Deu@@ le agree . &quot;
&quot; in addition to a permanent residence there are intern@@ ships , training places , training places , one @-@ euro jobs and aid activities for refugees and migrants who need to be frozen or furnished . &quot;
&quot; more places would be good , &quot; says Reg@@ ine Client . &quot;
&quot; many work in the building yard or help house masters , do @-@ profit work - and that motiv@@ ates and very ti@@ dy , as reported by Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le . &quot;
it hopes the work for the community leads to a positive external effect .
&quot; this is &quot; &quot; no employment therapy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; however , activity does not mean just work . &quot;
&quot; the day needs a solid structure , say Deu@@ sch@@ le and Customer . &quot;
people would have to develop a sense of belonging .
&quot; so I need offers such as sports , contacts with locals and especially language courses . &quot;
professional courses are rare .
so also jump here administration and volunteers .
&quot; it is central that the refugees get the feeling , they are welcome and welcome in Germany . &quot;
the long duration of the proceedings is a problem .
&quot; they have to explain to the refugees that it just takes and they can make sense to bridge them wis@@ ely , for example with language courses . &quot;
&quot; who eventually develop the feeling that he could not help anyone in Ur@@ bach , should not work and be useless , he will never be able to integrate . &quot;
the clear majority is motivated .
&quot; however , customers are honest , &quot; people , with whom nothing works . &quot; the work of Deu@@ sch@@ le and customer is therefore always to motiv@@ ate others . &quot;
&quot; all this is already a &quot; &quot; mam@@ mot@@ h task &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; a difficult question : have the two of the latest incidents fear of radic@@ alisation , even in a small community like Ur@@ bach ? &quot;
&quot; no , &quot; says Reg@@ ine Client quite clearly , &quot; what man@@ ger may call &quot; nai@@ ve . &quot; a residual risk can and doesn &apos;t want to exclu@@ de it . &quot;
but the hel@@ pers are already sensi@@ ti@@ zed .
these incidents are also the subject of the refugees .
they would have the fear that the assass@@ ins put them completely in call .
&quot; they want to show that they have nothing to do with it , &quot; says Reg@@ ine Client . &quot;
many would like to stay in Ur@@ bach .
so main and hon@@ orary officials have to look for activities on site and in the region .
&quot; in the background , they always have in the background that soon a new st@@ ump of refugees and migrants could come to Ur@@ bach . &quot;
does Germany need a cap ?
&quot; to answer this question clearly , politics is afraid . &quot;
&quot; in fact , it is unfair to put them on @-@ site hel@@ pers . &quot;
&quot; in Ur@@ bach we haven &apos;t arrived yet where we want , &quot; says Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le . &quot;
&quot; no new refugees , that would relax the situation . &quot;
&quot; Reg@@ ine client also makes clear that the Ur@@ bacher is already busy , to integrate the previous people sensi@@ bly . &quot;
&quot; these are currently about 100 people , mainly young men . &quot;
&quot; but when people are in need , they must help them , both women agree . &quot;
&quot; the political world situation is so complicated , there are no simple answers . &quot;
Sch@@ orn@@ dorf : a Crus@@ her with Hel@@ icop@@ ter
the police helicop@@ ter flew several areas for about an hour - un@@ successful .
two unknown men were entered into an apartment in a multi @-@ family house at 8.@@ 50 am on Friday morning at 8.@@ 50 am .
the inhabit@@ ant surprised the two and struck the lack of escape .
&quot; the two men were about 1.@@ 65 to 1.@@ 70 meters large , probably mas@@ ked , both men wore jeans and black hoo@@ dies . &quot;
they fled the direction of the city centre .
&quot; for the prosecution , police put several fights as well as a police helicop@@ ter . &quot;
the prosecution worked out without success .
&quot; perhaps the unknown , before the fact , fell near the apartment or at their escape . &quot;
Baden @-@ Wu@@ er@@ ttemberg : police determined after ro@@ cker attack on I@@ mb@@ iss
