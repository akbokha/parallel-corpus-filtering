<seg id="1">Golfer Langer wins the Sport Pyramid</seg>
<seg id="2">His experiences on the horse are manageable.</seg>
<seg id="3">At the end of a golf tournament in South Africa Bernhard Langer with some colleagues sought a little variation with a ride on the beach.</seg>
<seg id="4">It was a premiere for the 58-year-old.</seg>
<seg id="5">CHIO: "golden Sportpyramid" for Bernhard Langer</seg>
<seg id="6">"after a few minutes, the horses remembered their feast, they were hunting for a quick gallop back home to the feed questionnaires."</seg>
<seg id="7">"one kilometer at this pace, I was afraid."</seg>
<seg id="8">"it was not a good experience," says Langer. "</seg>
<seg id="9">And thus the riding career ended up again.</seg>
<seg id="10">"on Saturday, Germany's best golfer was at all times - 101 tournament victories - again near horses."</seg>
<seg id="11">"he was led by his family about the system of the ALRV, on a horse he didn't even dare to photograph."</seg>
<seg id="12">This was the first time in Aachen and thus also with CHIO.</seg>
<seg id="13">The reason was absolutely convincing.</seg>
<seg id="14">The German sports aid handed over to the man from Anhausen as part of a small gala the Golden Sportpyramid.</seg>
<seg id="15">It does not lack the sympathetic athlete.</seg>
<seg id="16">"spring Cross, Silver bay leaf, Champions-Tour player of the year..."</seg>
<seg id="17">Even the British Queen has already loaded him.</seg>
<seg id="18">Long is the 18th prize winner of the sports pyramid.</seg>
<seg id="19">"in Aachen, he met the first prize-winner Hans Günter Winkler on Saturday."</seg>
<seg id="20">"this award means a lot to me," says Langer, "because she is not only awarded for sporting achievements, but also for social commitment."</seg>
<seg id="21">Langer has been promoting offspring for decades.</seg>
<seg id="22">"and so he also announced the prize money of 25,000 euros."</seg>
<seg id="23">"with 15 other outstanding sportsmen, the two-time U.S. Masterssieger was admitted to the" Hall of Fame of German Sports "on Saturday."</seg>
<seg id="24">"the winners include the athletes of Hartwig Gauder and Harald Schmitt, the Turner Eberhard Gienger, the Fechter Cornelia Hanisch, Alexander Pusch and Arnd Schmitt, the Ruderer Peter-Michael Kolbe, the Judoka Frank Wieneke, the rider Alwin Schockemöhle and posthum der Handballer Erhard Wunderlich."</seg>
<seg id="25">Many of these sportsmen came to Aachen on Saturday.</seg>
<seg id="26">"after the official part, the illustrious company emigrated to the Springstadion, where the Lavazza Prize ran."</seg>

<seg id="1">Clintons and Trumps Policy Comparison: it's all about the money</seg>
<seg id="2">Investing in infrastructure and preventing TTP trading agreement - they want both Clinton and Trump.</seg>
<seg id="3">"the two US presidential candidates, however, are in the tax and energy policy as well as in a basic demand."</seg>
<seg id="4">"the difference in economic policy between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton is a basic, rather philosophical difference."</seg>
<seg id="5">The role of the state.</seg>
<seg id="6">"" "Trump wants to remain small in doubt and warns of how the state of the economy can harm the economy - with taxes and regulations."</seg>
<seg id="7">"Clinton wanted to bestow the economy to death and regulate it to death, he says."</seg>
<seg id="8">"he himself, on the other hand, would be quite different, claims Trump."</seg>
<seg id="9">"he will massively repay Regulations, and he is strong for a far-reaching tax reform with lower tax rates - for private people and for companies."</seg>
<seg id="10">"Clinton, on the other hand, said: the state has certain tasks to fulfil, he has to open disadvantaged opportunities and needs money for it."</seg>
<seg id="11">"that is why the taxes would be increased for the rich, says it."</seg>
<seg id="12">"interestingly, both are very close to the topic of infrastructure."</seg>
<seg id="13">"in the need to invest, Trump and Clinton say almost identical."</seg>
<seg id="14">The democratic candidate announces the largest investment in new jobs since the Second World War.</seg>
<seg id="15">State investment programmes in the infrastructure are classical democratic policies and are strictly rejected by the state-critical Teaparty wing of the Republicans.</seg>
<seg id="16">"so, on Trump, parties could still deal with party discussions."</seg>
<seg id="17">"Euromonitor International has over 40 years' experience of publishing market research reports, business reference books and online information systems."</seg>
<seg id="18">Trump wants to build coal-fired power plants and drive back coal mining in the US.</seg>
<seg id="19">"oil production should also be possible in so far protected areas, the Paris climate protection agreement aims to announce."</seg>
<seg id="20">"Clinton, on the other hand, wants to extend and challenge the Renewable Energy with its investment program:" "a country will become the super power of clean energy and create millions of jobs."</seg>
<seg id="21">"it will probably be either China, Germany or America - I want it to be."</seg>
<seg id="22">"but not only in infrastructure - even in international trade agreements, the two competitors are not too far from each other."</seg>
<seg id="23">"TPP, the transpacific trade agreement, both do not want to sign."</seg>
<seg id="24">"at the same time, both of them do not want to isolate the US from international trade - but simply to better protect American jobs."</seg>
<seg id="25">"they should also be paid better, such as Clinton."</seg>
<seg id="26">The current minimum wage of $7.25 is a famine.</seg>
<seg id="27">It wants to increase it to 15 dollars per hour.</seg>
<seg id="28">"what Trump wants to do in this question is not quite clear: once he says: the minimum wage must go down, then he says he should not be changed."</seg>
<seg id="29">But the big discussion of the months ahead is likely to be more likely to develop the control policy of the two camps.</seg>
<seg id="30">"on the one hand, Trump, who wants to relieve the economy and citizens to boost growth."</seg>
<seg id="31">"his critics claim to him, that the budget deficit would only grow bigger."</seg>
<seg id="32">"on the other hand, Clinton, which at least wants to demand from the rich, wants to pay more taxes, and their critics say: more taxes are not the solution either."</seg>

<seg id="16">"in the North of Munich, they live in one of the few decentralised accommodations for secluded women and their children in Bavaria."</seg>

<seg id="24">"women outweigh other reasons for the escape:" "many steal secretly because they don't see any other way out."</seg>
<seg id="25">"in their homeland, they have experience with sexual violence, forced marriages, bondage, slavery or forced prostitution."</seg>
<seg id="26">This is driving them away.</seg>

<seg id="30">"who believe that the end, as soon as they arrive in Germany, irre, tells Bahr."</seg>
<seg id="31">"here too, single women in refugee shelters would often be considered inferior and badly misused."</seg>

<seg id="2">Representatives of the assistants have called their union to approve new labour campaigns in their disputes over a new treaty.</seg>
<seg id="3">The Junior Doctors Committee (JDC) of the British Medical Association (BMA) has called for its entire Council to approve more labour campaigns from the beginning of September.</seg>
<seg id="4">The JDC said that ministers had failed to respond to concerns about the contract.</seg>
<seg id="5">"in July, assistant physicians and medical students agreed on the rejection of a contract agreed with the BMA."</seg>
<seg id="6">He was rejected by 58% of its members voted in elections.</seg>
<seg id="7">"in a letter to the members, which was published on Thursday evening on Twitter, the chairman of the JDC Ellen McCourt said that the government would have remained" persistent "to problems, which led to the fact that the treaty was rejected."</seg>
<seg id="8">"she said:" "in view of this, the JDC Council agreed to reject the proposed new treaty and calls for official new negotiations to all your worries."</seg>
<seg id="9">"as an answer to the silence of the government, the JDC Council today issued a formal request for a special meeting of the BMA Council to approve a running program of escalating labour campaigns, beginning of September."</seg>

<seg id="1">Russia and Turkey: an "alliance of outsiders"?</seg>
<seg id="2">It was a gesture that ended a crisis.</seg>
<seg id="3">Russia and Turkey leaders met on Tuesday to surrender their hands and to announce an official end of the eight-month war of words and economic sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="4">"but when Vladimir Putin accepts his Turkish counterpart in the gold-plated auditorium of St. Petersburg palace, I cannot deny myself that Ankara wants this reconciliation most."</seg>
<seg id="5">"there was the handshake, yes."</seg>
<seg id="6">"but Putin's smiles seemed to be narrow, and he hardly radiated warmth, even for his restrained conditions."</seg>
<seg id="7">"Recep Tayyip Erdogan, on the other hand, spoke of his" dear friend "Putin - according to a report five times."</seg>
<seg id="8">I couldn't count it any more.</seg>
<seg id="9">"he also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis, but will even improve."</seg>
<seg id="10">"the next day, a newspaper described that Erdogan had behaved like that, as if there was never anything bad."</seg>
<seg id="11">To me his enthusiasm seemed rather to imply the opposite.</seg>
<seg id="12">"but one of Putin's blazing, sustainable cows showed that Russia's head of state had nothing to forget."</seg>
<seg id="13">"rather, the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his introductory phrases: the shot of a Russian fighter plane at the Syrian border through Turkey."</seg>
<seg id="14">Moscow's reaction to the time was displeased.</seg>
<seg id="15">Putin condemned and accused Ankara to fall Russia back into the back.</seg>
<seg id="16">"the crime was even greater, since it was committed by a supposed friend."</seg>
<seg id="17">Rebuild the vetrain will be difficult if not even impossible.</seg>
<seg id="18">The public opinion in Russia has changed since November.</seg>
<seg id="19">"for months, the state-controlled media carried out a violent, unrestricted attack on Ankara."</seg>
<seg id="20">At one time it seemed as if the Turks would bear the blame for everything.</seg>
<seg id="21">"most serious were the allegations of senior officials, that Erdogan's own family would have benefited from illegal oil trade in Syria, controlled by the so-called Islamic State."</seg>
<seg id="22">He has denied this vehemently.</seg>
<seg id="23">But in St.Petersburg the official message was that it was time to look forward.</seg>
<seg id="24">"finally, this meeting took place only because Putin received the apology from President Erdogan."</seg>
<seg id="25">Russia could book a kind of victory.</seg>
<seg id="26">"for Ankara, the advantages of a ceasefire are obvious."</seg>
<seg id="27">"Erdogan primarily needs all the friends he can get, after he was dismissed almost of his ministry last month with a failed coup d" état. "</seg>
<seg id="28">Repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey have also shaken him.</seg>
<seg id="29">But there are also economic motives.</seg>
<seg id="30">"Russian sanctions have hit Turkey hard, in particular the prohibition of charter flights, which usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast every year."</seg>
<seg id="31">The number has declined by almost 90%.</seg>
<seg id="32">"in Russia, tour operators and charter companies will be relieved when the flights are resumed."</seg>
<seg id="33">They count on a late-night rush to the Mediterranean Sea.</seg>
<seg id="34">"this week, the state television predicted cheap fruit and vegetables as soon as the Turkish imports are allowed again."</seg>
<seg id="35">"a report in Vedemosti formulated it as follows:" tourists there long, tomatoes here long. "</seg>
<seg id="36">But the visit had an additional political value for Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="37">"Ankara is angry to the West, as it considers its reaction to the attempted power transfer as a weak answer."</seg>
<seg id="38">"to this end, the ongoing Groll on the snail of EU accession negotiations and Putin - that is pivotal to benefit from the cool mood and reduce the relationship of Turkey to the West."</seg>
<seg id="39">The Russian Head of State won a bonus in Ankara with certainty that he asked for the attempted coup d "état support for the elected state organs.</seg>
<seg id="40">"this is a matter of course for Moscow, which itself has a deep-seated fear of regiments."</seg>
<seg id="41">"the summit in this splendid palace at the sea enabled Russia and Turkey to portray an" "alliance of outsiders" "in Russia and Turkey - two countries that stumble from the west and feel badly treated and now allied."</seg>
<seg id="42">"nevertheless, despite the public reconciliation, there are still major differences between the two."</seg>
<seg id="43">"the greatest difference is Syria, where Moscow recently gave itself the role as peacemakers, but where Russia and Turkey support opposing sides."</seg>
<seg id="44">"it could be significant that after almost three hours of initial talks, both presidents met at the press conference that they had not even stripped the subject."</seg>
<seg id="45">"the President of Turkey intentionally avoided responding to a question about their differences, while Putin decided to emphasize that."</seg>
<seg id="46">There is no clear consensus on where a common denominator can be found in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="47">"but after months of open hostilities - and in view of the potential for a perfect disaster, when NATO member Turkey enjoyed the Russian fighter jet - it is certainly better that the two heads of state are talking to each other again."</seg>

<seg id="5">"in an opinion of the Kremlin, it is that Putin arranged the dismissal of Ivanovo from his duties as chairman of the Russian presidential administration."</seg>
<seg id="6">"Anton Vaino, who had appointed Ivanovs deputy since 2012, was appointed to his successor."</seg>
<seg id="7">"Vaino, 44, is a former diplomat."</seg>
<seg id="8">"born 1972 in Tallinn's capital Tallinn, he graduated from the prestigious State Department of Moscow for International Relations (MGIMO) and worked in the Embassy in Tokyo."</seg>
<seg id="9">"on the Kremlin's website it means (in Russian), that later he was the chief manager and staff manager of the government."</seg>
<seg id="10">"he said to Putin about his appointment:" "thank you for your confidence." ""</seg>
<seg id="11">I think that it is the main task of the government to support your activity as a leader in law enforcement and controls to implement your instructions.</seg>
<seg id="12">Putin told the Russian TV station on Friday that Ivanov asked to leave his post and Vaino recommended his successor.</seg>
<seg id="13">Convince the smiling faces?</seg>
<seg id="14">This step has made Moscow mysterious.</seg>
<seg id="15">"Sergey Ivanov was one of the closest confidaned Vladimir Putin and works like him for the Soviet secret service, the KGB."</seg>
<seg id="16">"as Chief of Staff, he was one of the most powerful men in the country."</seg>
<seg id="17">"at a meeting with President Putin, which was broadcast on television, both men claimed that the Chief of Staff will retire on his own request."</seg>
<seg id="18">"but despite the smile for the cameras, few of them are convinced - especially now, just before the parliamentary elections."</seg>
<seg id="19">So is the consequence of a kind of power struggle?</seg>
<seg id="20">None [go to Youtube.com]</seg>
<seg id="21">"but the official statement - that a man, once praised as a potential President, would once like to lead the Russian environmental policy - reached great scepticism."</seg>
<seg id="22">"in his remarks to Putin, which are quoted on the Kremlin's website, Ivanov said," It is true that I have asked you in a conversation at the beginning of 2012, asking me this very complicated post - you could almost say - to trust posts for four years. "</seg>
<seg id="23">"as it turns out, I have been chairman of the Russian President's administration for four years and eight months."</seg>
<seg id="24">Ivanov took the post in December 2011.</seg>
<seg id="25">Previously he was Deputy Prime Minister and Defence Minister.</seg>
<seg id="26">He is a member of the Russian Security Council and as Putin former member of the State Security Service KGB.</seg>
<seg id="27">"in the late 1990s, when Putin was Chairman of the Federal Security Service (FSB), who replaced the KGB, Ivanov was appointed his deputy."</seg>
<seg id="28">"when Putin came to power, he called Ivanov as one of five people whom he trusted the most."</seg>
<seg id="29">"once, it was assumed that Ivanov could become President of Russia after Putin's second term as a third term of office had violated the constitution."</seg>
<seg id="30">"but this post was taken by another, close allies Putins, Dmitry Medvedev."</seg>

<seg id="2">The £1.35 billion project is to be completed by May 2017</seg>
<seg id="3">Engineers have connected the north deck of the Queensferry Crossings with the Viaduct - which means that the bridge is now connected to Fife.</seg>
<seg id="4">"it is the first of four closing of the" "ceiling blower", "which are approaching the completion of each of the three towers of the bridge."</seg>
<seg id="5">"the bridge-section of Fife is now 600 meters long and weighs 30,000 tons."</seg>
<seg id="6">"it has 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 traitors."</seg>
<seg id="7">The £1.35 billion project is to be completed by May 2017.</seg>
<seg id="8">"Minister of Economics, Keith Brown, made a visit to the building site today and was one of the first to go from the country to the bridge."</seg>
<seg id="9">He said: "this is a historical and symbolic moment when building the Queensferry Crossings.</seg>
<seg id="10">"we are all witnesses of an engineering art from a truly epic proportions in this project with more than 30,000 tons of concrete and steel used for this part of the bridge."</seg>
<seg id="11">"despite the massive size and weight of the bridge, the completion of the closure between the viaduct and the bridge deck is a delicate activity requiring extremely precise tolerances for fit."</seg>
<seg id="12">"all in all, almost 79% of the total bridge endecks are in their place and the last section of the deck is today in Rosyth a concrete for the deck, which means that the entire deck is ready to be lifted on the bridge to its place."</seg>
<seg id="13">"Michael Martin, Project Manager of Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors said:" the first closure is a major milestone in each bridge project. "</seg>
<seg id="14">"with this fantastic project, the closure is future-oriented high- and civil engineering."</seg>
<seg id="15">"after installing the last section of the street and its connection with the Nordtower deck in the expansion, we had to close the still existing gap on the north or side of the country."</seg>
<seg id="16">This was achieved by pulling the northern Zubringer bridge 700 millimeters south.</seg>
<seg id="17">This was a massive and at the same time very sensitive activity.</seg>
<seg id="18">"massive because the viaduct is 222 metres long, weighs about 6,000 tons and had to be pulled upwards at a slope of about 3%."</seg>

<seg id="4">"at the next council meeting, the SPD is proposing a" concept concept living. ""</seg>
<seg id="5">But dispute is programmed.</seg>
<seg id="6">"first and foremost, it is about the question: who should actually build the cheap apartments?"</seg>
<seg id="7">A regulation is missing so far.</seg>
<seg id="8">"SPD leader Christoph Bratmann says:" "we agree with the Greens: those who want to build on urban areas will have to show 20 percent of all flats as social housing."</seg>
<seg id="9">"however, the favorable apartments may also arise in the continuance."</seg>
<seg id="10">"the big dispute in the town hall is, however, as Bratmann:" how do you deal with investors who want to build on private surfaces? "</seg>
<seg id="11">"we want investors to build at least 10 percent on such surfaces, but as 20 percent of the flats as social housing."</seg>
<seg id="12">"a new municipal housing construction program, which will cost millions and is still to be financed, is intended to provide incentives for incentives."</seg>
<seg id="13">"the problem, as Bratmann says," There is currently no agreement between the fractions. "</seg>

<seg id="16">"regardless of this, so Bratmann, a sharpening of the situation on the housing market."</seg>
<seg id="17">"if the concept of action is implemented, it will take care of additional tasks in the construction administration."</seg>
<seg id="18">More staff is required.</seg>
<seg id="19">It is unclear whether we will get the skilled workers.</seg>
<seg id="20">"but still the program is not entirely new: because the around 1260 new apartments, which should be built anyway."</seg>
<seg id="21">But how do you compensate for the loss of other around 1300 low-priced apartments whose funding will expire in the coming years?</seg>
<seg id="22">"by 2020 alone, it will be 500 apartments."</seg>
<seg id="23">"in order to prevent this, so the planned policy speaker Nicole Palm, should now be purchased from the city."</seg>

<seg id="28">Around 1800 apartments you could get back in the price binding for cheap apartments.</seg>
<seg id="29">"only: they do not want the owners, the housing companies."</seg>
<seg id="30">"because the number of social housing in the Western town is increased dramatically, it is removed from the goal of so-called mixing."</seg>

<seg id="1">"Pokémon Go, a hunt for health and happiness that pays off"</seg>
<seg id="2">It is fascinating to see how the world is changing.</seg>
<seg id="3">"the fact that teenagers and children can no longer go outside, but rather prefer to spend their free time with them, staring on screens, has been lamented by many in the last decade."</seg>
<seg id="4">Pokemon Go is about getting people from the sofa and become more active.</seg>
<seg id="5">"the time on the screen was initially limited to television, then on video games, and finally on smartphones."</seg>
<seg id="6">"therefore, it is great to see that technology and outdoor activities are not mutually exclusive."</seg>
<seg id="7">"of course, I refer to Pokémon Go-Wahn, an app that is based on the characters that were initially created for video games in the 1990s (a cartoon series, playing cards and other spin-offs)."</seg>
<seg id="8">"how many phenomena of pop culture decreased the interest before the release of the game in the USA, Australia and New Zealand in early July."</seg>
<seg id="9">The market launch in other countries has been postponed by the massive demand that the servers overload.</seg>
<seg id="10">Within a few days Pokémon Go had more users than Tinder and almost as many as Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="11">How does it work?</seg>
<seg id="12">"in short, players go outside and search for Pokémons that are tracked with a GPS and once they have been found," "photographed" "(via a screenshot on the phone) or" "captured". ""</seg>
<seg id="13">"a generation that played the game when she was younger, joined the Wahn and jumped for the search of the sofa."</seg>
<seg id="14">"in the US, the game led to a considerable increase in steps that the" average "person sets back each day."</seg>
<seg id="15">"Cardiograms, an app for Apple Watch, followed by 35,000 users, announced the Washington Post recently that within two days after the launch of the game, the number of traversed people who train every day 30 minutes, jumped from 45 percent to 53 percent."</seg>
<seg id="16">The company does not know who plays Pokémon Go - it only looks the raw data to increase performance.</seg>
<seg id="17">"many public awareness campaigns on health that people want to take" "take 30 minutes", "" "coming from the sofa" "and" "to be active every day", "because many public messages are getting boring and coming from people who look elend."</seg>
<seg id="18">"nevertheless, the importance of sport can not be overrated."</seg>
<seg id="19">Whoever drives sports regularly reduces his chances of developing cancer or depression.</seg>
<seg id="20">"physical activity helps in weight control, high blood pressure, diabetes and a long list of benefits that is too long to lead them here."</seg>
<seg id="21">"but the wonderful thing about Pokémon Go is that it brings people to do something outdoors, making them fun."</seg>
<seg id="22">"thus, three pillars of health are covered - exercise, fresh air and sunshine and fun."</seg>
<seg id="23">Some people even include new friendships on the hunt.</seg>
<seg id="24">"as always there are also Mürcher's spoils, which always have to complain about something."</seg>
<seg id="25">"and yes, someone could walk around a door."</seg>
<seg id="26">What is it?</seg>
<seg id="27">It has made a breakthrough.</seg>
<seg id="28">"even if Smartphone-Apps like Fitbit could already track down our activity earlier, they gave us no reason to do sport as it does this game."</seg>
<seg id="29">The new will lose its appeal and the use will be reproduced with time.</seg>
<seg id="30">"however, due to Pokemons success, there will be more games that will unite apps and virtual reality with the activist in the real world and help many people to hunt the more active, fitter and healthier."</seg>

<seg id="1">Why we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie "</seg>
<seg id="2">This is what I imagine at the gymnasium in gymnastics and that for more than one reason.</seg>
<seg id="3">"first of all, I have been at every summer Olympics since 1984 and the USA have never been so dominant."</seg>
<seg id="4">"second, this team has three gymnasts, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren" Laurie "Hernandez, which inspires many young girls of other skin colour."</seg>
<seg id="5">"the structure of this team, which is Aly Raisman, the Jewess and Madison Kocian, which is Katholikin, makes everyone proud."</seg>
<seg id="6">This team finally reflects the US.</seg>
<seg id="7">It has solidified the black and hispanic female presence at the top of this sport.</seg>
<seg id="8">"in the last four years, the number one under the female gymnasium was an Afro-American woman."</seg>
<seg id="9">"last year, Simone and Gabby were # 1 and # 2."</seg>
<seg id="10">This shows strength.</seg>
<seg id="11">"at the last Olympic Games, Gabby Douglas was a surprising Olympia winning company and America."</seg>
<seg id="12">"now the world was able to witness the incredible performance of the triple world champions Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, how they delivered unexpected but masterful gymnastic routines."</seg>
<seg id="13">"on Thursday, Simone was the fourth, heterosexual female, who won gold in an individual multi-campaign event for women."</seg>
<seg id="14">Team member Aly Raisman won silver.</seg>
<seg id="15">"we experience the top of this sport, but we do not see gym classes in the whole country."</seg>
<seg id="16">"Simone, Gabby and Laurie beat all the same way as Aly and Madison to put it into the Olympic team."</seg>
<seg id="17">"they are the" last five, "because the next Olympic Games will only have four gymnasts in the team."</seg>
<seg id="18">"but reality looks like gymnastics are a more expensive sport and gymnasts primarily arise in private gymnastics, which are maintained by parents who pay for training, furnishing, travel clothing, competition and hotel costs (for the trainers and their gymnasts and families)."</seg>
<seg id="19">"the majority of these clubs are in wealthy suburbs, which can support the business."</seg>
<seg id="20">"in these societies, the gymnasts get their entire training and this is an expensive and long-term commitment to families."</seg>
<seg id="21">"Aimee Boorman, trainer of Simone Biles, and Maggie Haney, trainer of Laurie Hernandez, both trained their athletes since they started the gymnastics."</seg>
<seg id="22">"we have to encourage the congregations of innumerable, young girls inspired by Simone, Gabby and Laurie, an affordable and easily accessible gymnasium."</seg>
<seg id="23">I founded my Turnfoundation of 20 years.</seg>
<seg id="24">"during my events, we have offered free and affordable gymnastics in Harlem for more than 15,000 urban youngsters (especially black and hispanic) and trained national and international victors."</seg>
<seg id="25">"in September, we will expand to Detroit (my hometown) to offer the youth high-quality gymnastics that deserve the opportunity to learn and profit from this great Olympic sport."</seg>
<seg id="26">"gymnastics develop strength, flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work, discipline and determination for the mind."</seg>
<seg id="27">This combination offers life-long benefits for health as well as for academic and professional success.</seg>
<seg id="28">"it is the inspiration of this team, bringing thousands of young girls to be interested in the gymnastics and that's great."</seg>
<seg id="29">"it is so important to take part in sports, especially for girls."</seg>
<seg id="30">This is such an exciting time.</seg>
<seg id="31">"thanks Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for this genuine presentation of" Girl Power "by holding the Olympic team gold and thank you, you motivated so many young girls with different backgrounds to start their way, healthy, strong and successful young women."</seg>

<seg id="1">Culture of Political Correctness blurts electoral fraud in Muslim areas</seg>
<seg id="2">"last year, the former mayor of Tower Hamlets Lutfur Rahman was removed from office due to corruption from office last year."</seg>
<seg id="3">A culture of Political Correctness has led to knowingly ignored widespread electoral fraud in Muslim communities like a devastating government report today.</seg>
<seg id="4">"the former member of the cabinet of Sir Eric Pickles verbally grabs the police, election observers and town halls to have ignored proofs of electoral abuse due to" oversensitivity regarding ethnicity and religion. ""</seg>
<seg id="5">"the former Minister of Integration and Municipal Government, who is now an anti-corruptionist, said that the intimidation of constituents from religious motives is so bad that the police should be allowed to set off barriers outside of voting power to protect intimidated voters."</seg>
<seg id="6">He recommends that voters should take a passport to prove their identity in elections.</seg>
<seg id="7">"at present, a voter has to name his name and address."</seg>
<seg id="8">"the report proposes to apply not removable ink on the finger of a person, when they submit their votes to prevent someone to choose twice."</seg>
<seg id="9">"whistleblower should get more protection, says Sir Eric."</seg>
<seg id="10">It demands that the press should have more access to church documents and decisions of not official committees or working groups.</seg>
<seg id="11">"this serves not only against electoral fraud, but also to protect the municipal government from the broader corruption and financial fraud culture associated with it," he said. "</seg>
<seg id="12">The report was arranged by Downing Street as a result of Tower Hamlet's election scandal in eastern London.</seg>
<seg id="13">"last year, a special Electoral Court decided that the reigning mayor Lutsk Rahman should be relieved after a litany of corrupt and illegal practices of his ministry."</seg>
<seg id="14">"the Court found that Rahman had perverted the religious feelings of his Muslim community" in cynical way, "and that he would have put his critics to silence with racism and Islamophobia."</seg>
<seg id="15">Rahman is said to have led his campaign on the basis that it is the religious duty of Muslims to choose him.</seg>
<seg id="16">Up to 300 voices were either doubtful or the result of an imitation in which one person selects someone else.</seg>
<seg id="17">Sir Eric said that there was evidence of fraud throughout the country.</seg>
<seg id="18">"in particular, he expressed alarmed opposition to fraudulent briefing - who had made pressure on people to elect a candidate of their choice."</seg>
<seg id="19">"Sir Eric, pictured, made several recommendations to clean the electoral system, including the guide of instructing to prove the identity."</seg>
<seg id="20">"in his report it is said:" "evidence was attached that pressure has been exerted on vulnerable members of some ethnic minorities, especially women and young people in order to choose according to the will of the elderly, in particular communities with pakistani or bangladyfish background."</seg>
<seg id="21">There were concerns that... state institutions have knowingly ignored such behavior due to "politically correct" hypersensitivity related to ethnicity and religion.</seg>
<seg id="22">"Sir Eric spoke out 50 recommendations to clean the system, including the ban that political activists are editing briefing documents in order to stop" nominees. ""</seg>
<seg id="23">"the report adopted by Theresa May also requires tougher registration checks to prevent the electoral code being used for immigration and social security purposes."</seg>
<seg id="24">Consider choosing electors before choosing your ID.</seg>
<seg id="25">"not removable ink on the finger of a person, as soon as she has released her voice to prevent someone to choose twice."</seg>

<seg id="32">Requirement that only English must be used in the elective stations (except for Wales).</seg>
<seg id="33">"intensification of the training, to ensure that the employees rule the rule that voters will go alone in the election cabin."</seg>
<seg id="34">Sir Eric falls over the Metropolitan Police and finds it "amazing" that after the Tower Hamlet case there was no criminal complaint.</seg>
<seg id="35">"the election court held Lutfur Rahman and his deputy for a litany of corrupt and illegal practices as unsuitable," he said. "</seg>
<seg id="36">"due to a number of reasons, it was found guilty - according to the high requirements in criminal proceedings - found guilty."</seg>
<seg id="37">He also criticises the effectual "AbhakControllers" of the Election Sections of the Town Hall.</seg>
<seg id="38">"Sir Eric said:" "the Court of Justice in Tower Hamlets last year was a warning signal."</seg>
<seg id="39">"our country, as the mother of parliaments, bears a proud heritage, but the worrying and covert spread of electoral fraud and denial of some authorities threaten this good reputation."</seg>

<seg id="4">"she travelled further and tried four pairs of underpants in a shop at the Bouverie Place Shopping Centre in Folkestone, Germany."</seg>

<seg id="2">"the world outside is a dangerous place, but this video of Daily@ could make it a bit safer for you."</seg>
<seg id="3">"we talked to Rhone Mizrachi, a Grand Master of the Krav Maga Association in New York to find out how to deal with armed robbers at close distance."</seg>
<seg id="4">"regardless of whether you approach you from the front or from behind, this video will show you how you turn around for your predator."</seg>
<seg id="5">"when one approaches you from behind, you should turn around first so that you can see your aggressor and get out of the shooting line," says Mizrachi. "</seg>
<seg id="6">Then take the weapon between your front arm and your shoulder before you beat him with your free elbow.</seg>
<seg id="7">"beat him with the knee into the bar and turn, while the attacker is crooked before pain, the weapon out of his hands. beat him with the barrel and move backwards while holding the weapon on it."</seg>
<seg id="8">"near attackers approaching from the front, the technique is similar - move your body from the shot line, seize the weapon and turn it so that the attacker can not shoot."</seg>
<seg id="9">"at the same time, shift the weight to the weapon and hit the attacker on the chest, then turn the gun out of its grip before moving backward and set the weapon on it."</seg>
<seg id="10">Sounds difficult?</seg>

<seg id="2">A British traveller underwent his immune system and stranglelex to a serious test - by forcing some of the dirtiest and most disgusting places in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="3">"the presenter and the author Ian Wright, 51, from Suffolk shot his course on a Euro ticket, a banister at the Piccadilly Circus, a rinsing button of a pull toilet and a public telephone in Russia to demonstrate the resilience of his immune system."</seg>
<seg id="4">"before leaving any object, he used a luminaire to show and show us what he is going to get into."</seg>
<seg id="5">"but the experiment, which was filmed under the title" The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength, "brought some surprising results."</seg>
<seg id="6">"the thought of leaking up the rinsing button of a pull toilet that was already used by thousands of others may be completely repulsive, but actually there are more bad bacteria in a kitchen sink."</seg>
<seg id="7">"on his journey through Europe, Mr. Wright spoke with doctors and medical professionals about the promotion of gut bacteria and his own health."</seg>
<seg id="8">"fortunately, nothing left what he licked, more than a bad aftertaste in the mouth."</seg>
<seg id="9">Wright became known to test the resilience of his Darms by traveling through the world and ate peculiar as well as wonderful things.</seg>
<seg id="10">"from public railways to train stations, up to cubes of toilets, the task put his immune system definitively under a sample."</seg>
<seg id="11">"he told:" "as a child I was relatively inworried about what my health concerns and I put all sorts of things into my mouth, earth, worms and mud water."</seg>
<seg id="12">"in the film, he was in charge of his reputation."</seg>
<seg id="13">The only thing he refused was a dirty public toilet in Russia.</seg>
<seg id="14">His trial line showed an Luminometry of more than 4000 units.</seg>
<seg id="15">"compared to this, the Luminometry number is less than 60."</seg>
<seg id="16">"but there was a Russian toilet that he refused to lick, after their Luminometry count was over 4000 units while freshly washed hands have one of less than 60"</seg>
<seg id="17">"Mr. Wright and Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Valio produced the guide" The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength, "which shows the number of bacteria in different places like the bathroom."</seg>
<seg id="18">"in the film he says:" "this comes to the worst thing I have gerocked in a toilet."</seg>
<seg id="19">There is nothing more dirty than that!</seg>
<seg id="20">I will not lick anything here because it's disgusting here.</seg>
<seg id="21">"the Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength" was produced in cooperation with the Finnish producer of dairy products valio.</seg>
<seg id="22">"the company provides Mr. Wright with Valio Gefilus, which contains both lactic acid bacteria and vitamin C and D to help promote intestinal bacteria and immune system."</seg>
<seg id="23">"Valios Senior Venice President for Snacks, juices and new categories Niko Vuorenmaa said:" we wanted to offer consumers something new. "</seg>
<seg id="24">Something that is fascinating to look at and at the same time explains the advantages of probiotics.</seg>
<seg id="25">We performed crazy brainstorming that ended that we told "Let's call Ian."</seg>
<seg id="26">They claim that interest in gut health is becoming a global phenomenon</seg>
<seg id="27">"instead of talking about the products, we wanted to put them into a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment, the importance of gut health and how it is associated with the immune system."</seg>
<seg id="28">"Euromonitor International has over 40 years' experience of publishing market research reports, business reference books and online information systems."</seg>
<seg id="29">I also think the film shows that we have a great sense of humor!</seg>
<seg id="30">"Tom Hakala, who led the film direction, added:" let me tell me this way - I would have lost my respect for Ian, if he had tasted some of the things I have instructed him to lick, just like the ecelous Russian toilet that is shown in the film. "</seg>
<seg id="31">"of course, there were things in which it was easier to bring Ian to leak them and others, in which this was quite difficult."</seg>
<seg id="32">I am glad that we recorded some of these dirty goodies on film.</seg>

<seg id="2">"an asozial family left their social housing after a delogation with a loss of £50,000 because they terrorized their neighbors."</seg>
<seg id="3">"Tanya Skeldon and her partner Shaun Trebilcock were thrown into Saltash, Cornwall after a long list of complaints."</seg>
<seg id="4">"after they were forcibly removed from their property, shocked employees of the housing association found the property in an irreparable condition."</seg>
<seg id="5">"the walls pointed sloping holes, wooden boards were torn, garbage was dispersed on the floor and graffiti was lubricated at the walls."</seg>
<seg id="6">The family have been moved and it is assumed that it is now living in a private accommodation</seg>
<seg id="7">"Donna McEvoy, who works for home administration at Cornwall Housing, said that she feared that the apartment was no longer repaired."</seg>
<seg id="8">She said: "it was an absolute nightmare for the people here and I think people don't have to live in this way.</seg>
<seg id="9">"there are many things to consider, since this property is thought to be regarded as not as beautiful part of Cornwall."</seg>
<seg id="10">The family is notorious and their reputation is also.</seg>
<seg id="11">"the couple had three sons who lived in the apartment in the meantime and the police said that the terror that the family had added, roadfights with baseball bats, intimidations of residents, drug abuse, drug trafficking and excessive screams, strikers and flukes included."</seg>
<seg id="12">"Skeldon, 47, whose name was on the lease, received an arrangement for anti-social behavior in June."</seg>
<seg id="13">"in some rooms of the house, which may be torn down under certain circumstances, old garbage was found"</seg>
<seg id="14">"in the estate, where drugs were traded in the past, the wooden panels were torn apart."</seg>
<seg id="15">Neighbours said that they had to fight them on the road and regularly invoked the police</seg>
<seg id="16">Cornwall housing led her and her partner this week forcibly by the property after giving them an extended period of 11 weeks to volunteer.</seg>
<seg id="17">The delogation was cheered by lightened neighbours who said their lives were made to hell.</seg>
<seg id="18">"one said," "They were not afraid of anyone." ""</seg>
<seg id="19">We lived for 20 years along with them and it was always bad.</seg>
<seg id="20">The countless times we say the police here are incredible.</seg>
<seg id="21">"this morning we could not sleep."</seg>
<seg id="22">We stood up because it was so quiet here - we are not accustomed to it!</seg>
<seg id="23">"now, where they are finally gone, it will become beautiful."</seg>
<seg id="24">"Adam Fitzpatrick, Neighbourhood Enforcement Manager of Cornwall Housing, said that the family had failed to cooperate with the local authorities."</seg>
<seg id="25">"the family lived in the house to which the police was recalled at regular intervals, 20 years long."</seg>
<seg id="26">"on the overgrown side of the village house, garbage and old toys were thrown down"</seg>
<seg id="27">"he added:" "it is a shame that the renter agrees to accept any responsibility for their behaviour and their family because a delogation is always the last step, considering the Cornwall Housing."</seg>
<seg id="28">"this was a very difficult case, because the behaviour was extreme and their deeds for their neighbours had to be horrible."</seg>
<seg id="29">"I appreciate all the work that my team, the Devon and Cornwall police and members of the community who have courageously joined us and have provided us with the information."</seg>
<seg id="30">"I hope that this development will donate some neighbors, and the message conveys that antisocial behavior is not tolerated."</seg>
<seg id="31">"Fitzpatrick said that all three sons had lived at different times in the house, but that they were all over 20."</seg>
<seg id="32">A dirty mattress that is left behind in one of the bedrooms of the house after delogation on the ground.</seg>
<seg id="33">Workers of the house-government will now have to bluish garbage mountains that surround the house</seg>

<seg id="35">Skeldon was given a fine of money after having found guilty of the possession of a drug of class B in commercial terms.</seg>
<seg id="36">"she claimed that the money for a tombstone of her son Lee Skeldon, who came to life in 2013 at a car accident."</seg>

<seg id="38">Many rooms of the house were summed up with graffiti.</seg>
<seg id="39">"the police says that they are going to dle tenants, who do not stick to the house rules"</seg>
<seg id="40">"Angela Crow of Devon and Cornwall police reported that delogation was a clear warning to the other tenants, who do not stick to the house rules."</seg>
<seg id="41">"this goes to those who think that they can behave themselves without self-reproach, as well as those who have been harmed by such behaviour," she said. "</seg>

<seg id="4">"in 2021, the country election will not be held directly at the end of the summer holidays, the Schwerin Parliament has already decided at the beginning of the year."</seg>
<seg id="5">"as far as to date, it is not going on: summer holidays, heat and agricultural competition - that bites itself."</seg>
<seg id="6">"the locals, who are to be convinced by the election fighters, are on vacation."</seg>
<seg id="7">"most of the vacationers who are in the country, on the island Usedom, Rügen or Hiddensee are not locals, so may not choose the country day."</seg>
<seg id="8">"practical problems come: during the holidays, helpers, the posters hang up, bubbles, distributing flyers, distributing flyers at the end, only painstaking."</seg>
<seg id="9">"until September 4, 2016, the election and last holiday day, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern has to pass an election campaign just below the people over itself."</seg>
<seg id="10">"the hot phase, if you can say it at all, has just begun."</seg>
<seg id="11">"and it is also about something: Prime Minister Erwin Sellering, leader of an SPD / CDU coalition, must fear his office."</seg>
<seg id="12">"the SPD, the strongest party since 1998, is now clearly behind the CDU in surveys."</seg>
<seg id="13">Exciting is how strong Nuling AfD cuts and what remains at the end of the coalition.</seg>
<seg id="14">"Sellering, 66 years old and head of government since 2008, makes an almost inconspicuous campaign, one sees from his major posters."</seg>
<seg id="15">"he travels across the country, distributed roses and chatting a little with the people, just as he did his legendary word-carer Harald Ringstorff."</seg>
<seg id="16">"otherwise, sea herring has got cold feet and Chancellor Merkel gives Merkel the blame on the blossoming of the AfD."</seg>
<seg id="17">"your refugee policy, you" We create, "accelerates the rise of right-wing populists, which will probably cost him the beautiful ministry."</seg>
<seg id="18">"the CDU with its nickname, the Minister of Interior, Lorenz Caffier, has already experienced how it is, when you make an election campaign at the right place at the wrong time."</seg>
<seg id="19">"she invited German Chancellor Angela Merkel to speak to large-scale talks, and Merkel's parliamentary election is located in the northeast."</seg>
<seg id="20">"but the target group did not agree, there were more North Rhine-Westphalia, Berlin and Saxony as Mecklenburger and Vorpommern."</seg>
<seg id="21">"there was probably the majority from other federal states," said Vincent Kokert, General Secretary of the CDU in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, recently in NDR. "</seg>
<seg id="22">"but it's too bad to listen to anyone from other corners of Germany, once Angela Merkel."</seg>
<seg id="23">"otherwise, the Nordost CDU does not abandon the usual electoral campaigns on market places and before shopping centres with umbrellas and balloons."</seg>
<seg id="24">"that, when Kokert writes, plays only a" subordinate role. ""</seg>
<seg id="25">"also, the Union has noticed that on the country you have to take the ground that it must be very strict to find a wire again to the people."</seg>

<seg id="27">"however, the Council of the CDU election fighter Kokert to his comrades is also self-exposing:" you have to go there where it hurts, namely where people are: village festivals, Golden weddings, every birthday party must be used. "</seg>
<seg id="28">"because much on the game stands, Sellering has called his SPD to a particularly committed election campaign."</seg>
<seg id="29">"in surveys, the Social Democrats were last with 22 percent behind partners CDU (25) and just close to AfD (19)."</seg>
<seg id="30">"at the election of 2011, the SPD gained a clear view of 35.6 percent before the CDU (22)."</seg>

<seg id="9">"since the construction site on Monday has been migrated to the south and also the blocking of the asphalt road in Ofterdingen has been lifted and thus also the connection to Rottenburg is again, the traffic situation in the place has eased."</seg>

<seg id="15">"since the speed limits were not met, the municipality increased the measuring vehicle from Mössingen."</seg>

<seg id="11">"according to recent attacks in Würzburg and Ansbach, de Maizière has a little time to do so before it presents its conclusions for security in the Republic."</seg>

<seg id="14">"also, it is not the fact that Germany must implement several EU guidelines on passenger information and weapons law."</seg>

<seg id="24">Some also still works unbalanced and leaves questions open.</seg>
<seg id="25">"and with some points - in the unequal treatment of patiently for example, the question arises: what actually does this have to do with security and terror?"</seg>
<seg id="26">"yes, says de Maizière, it is important to differentiate between the subjects of refugees and terror."</seg>
<seg id="27">But it cannot be said that the attacks from Ansbach and Wuerzburg were refugees.</seg>
<seg id="28">"in addition, many people worried about security in the face of the high refugee figures."</seg>
<seg id="29">"and things that people were deeply occupied, could not complain about in election times."</seg>

<seg id="37">"only a conclusive argument about the equipment of the Federal Police, then via a security policy collection of some Unions interior ministers, in which the Ressortchiefs also demand a burka ban and a reversal from double citizenship."</seg>

<seg id="1">Destination plates: who buys record records?</seg>
<seg id="2">Lonely men middle aged love plates.</seg>
<seg id="3">"before you hurry to comment part to oversee him under the pseudonym nonAlleensamenMale middle-aged men with rough insults, this statement is derived from current data."</seg>
<seg id="4">"according to YouGov, the multicolored rebirth of vinyl records is not due to a boom in millennials that want to welcome the news of physical objects, but also due to midlife nostalgia."</seg>
<seg id="5">Those who recently bought a record are all foresight at the age of 45 and 54.</seg>
<seg id="6">"in fact, the age group of 18-24 is the most unlikely buyer group."</seg>
<seg id="7">It is also not a hordes by amateur collectors - it has an emotional meaning: older record buyers retain their feelings more for themselves (56% vs. 53%) and enjoy it alone time (69% vs. 66%).</seg>
<seg id="8">Forecasts to 2019 illustrate how the market is set to change.</seg>
<seg id="9">"if this blog would be a news report on TV, the camera would follow me while I run in the middle of a busy street in Soho, a modest gray suit and wildly hammered before I stop, hold my hands and say something more determinedly:" "so, let's take a closer look at it."</seg>
<seg id="10">So let's take a look at it.</seg>
<seg id="11">"even if the heart of Soho is slow in its charm - hotels, restaurants and offices are now filling the buildings where independent sellers were based - there is still a handful of fantastic record specialty shops."</seg>
<seg id="12">I would probably ask the cameraman to switch the camera for the next part in which I stand in close proximity to different men in such stores and try to assess their age and mind by observation.</seg>
<seg id="13">"Stuart from Glasgow, 55, the I of Sister Ray (number of data: two young women, three men of middle-aged) into Reckless Records (number of numbers: eight men of middle-aged, a woman, presumably around the 20), is one day long because of a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the few hours."</seg>
<seg id="14">"is he a collector, I ask?"</seg>
<seg id="15">"I guess," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="16">"I have about 3,000 or 4,000 sheets."</seg>
<seg id="17">"these records, pictured above (he sent me the snapshot by e-mail, I didn't follow him at home), dress the walls of his living room."</seg>
<seg id="18">"the reason why he has such a considerable number of albums and singles is the result of his available income: he is now able to buy plates that he couldn't afford, when she appeared and bought objects he sold, when he was young and wide."</seg>
<seg id="19">"many things I buy are from the late 60s, early 70s, which appeared when I was 11 or 12. things that I was probably too young to buy it," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="20">"he agrees that those who buy plates are more introverted and like to spend time alone, adding:" I don't smoke and I don't drink a lot. "</seg>
<seg id="21">This is my vice.</seg>
<seg id="22">"WEZ, 25, who works at Sister Ray, also believes that many customers whom he meets can apply to the YouGov profile."</seg>
<seg id="23">"but he also noticed a new wave of people who are influenced by the media, people who have heard about the comeback and set themselves to buy their old records."</seg>
<seg id="24">"from the conversations that I have led, people usually have got rid of their collection in 1998 or 1999."</seg>
<seg id="25">"customers who once sold their records to buy CDs, sell their CDs now to buy their records," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="26">This would explain the boom to trailers of the plate revivals of a particular age.</seg>
<seg id="27">But what about the alleged emotional significance of plates?</seg>
<seg id="28">"it takes just a few seconds in a shop like Phonica, to recognize that record stores offer a soothing community of like-minded people."</seg>
<seg id="29">"according to Wez, some of the older customers participated in the contactless payment system."</seg>
<seg id="30">"some record fans feel overwhelmed by the digital world and would like to draw back to the stability of familiar sound sleeves, from objects that call blissful adjustments."</seg>
<seg id="31">"I think sometimes it can be the filling of a void or possession of material possessions as a kind of comfort," "says Wez."</seg>
<seg id="32">That's with me as a collector so and I think it is so with many people.</seg>
<seg id="33">It is a simple way to deal mentally.</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "we are like their social workers!" "an employee of a stack pile."</seg>
<seg id="35">"a survey by ICM in April revealed that almost 50% of the people who bought a record last month, they haven't listened to."</seg>
<seg id="36">"the survey also found out that 41% have a record player they never use, while 7% of those who buy a record, don't have a record player."</seg>
<seg id="37">"at this time of news report, I would probably look very anxious, while I was puzzled by a pile of bossa Nova compilations."</seg>
<seg id="38">"Jonny, 42, who works at Sounds of the Universe (number of numbers: three middle-aged men), has noticed a" "trophy aspect" "of the revival."</seg>
<seg id="39">"someone came only recently here and said," "I don't have a turntable but I would like to buy a radiohead sound plate so that I can put them into the shelf," "he says."</seg>
<seg id="40">"this is not a big percentage, but it definitely happens."</seg>
<seg id="41">"more produktable, less musical."</seg>
<seg id="42">"we have people who say," I don't have a record player. ""</seg>
<seg id="43">"these are younger people, not older ones who come slowly."</seg>
<seg id="44">"Fopp, which has devoted almost a whole floor to the records, has a blower audience than I enter."</seg>
<seg id="45">"there are couples around the 70, tourists who make photos, teens and women middle aged."</seg>
<seg id="46">Even if the atmosphere is somewhat less relaxed than in the above-mentioned shops - Wild Beasts Neo synthesizer and sexbepacked pop in place of experimental jazz pampers from the speakers - it's good to see such diversity among customers.</seg>
<seg id="47">"no one of them looks strange, but nagging mental trauma is hard to determine if you stand next to someone for 30 seconds."</seg>
<seg id="48">"Elanora, 27, has been running around the business for a few minutes and looks at the variety of boards for sale."</seg>
<seg id="49">She is more likely to buy a mannequin than a big purchase.</seg>
<seg id="50">"it does not deserve much, therefore collecting plates is not a real option, she says."</seg>
<seg id="51">It costs a lot.</seg>
<seg id="52">"it is easy to listen to music from a computer or in a different way, but the beauty of records is..." she drives away with a dearest sigh. "</seg>
<seg id="53">I don't know how to explain it - it is truly unique.</seg>
<seg id="54">My last stop is a shop which is said to have inspired a new generation of record lovers: urban Outfitters.</seg>
<seg id="55">"while I give the voucher to muck the jeans hotel pants, I observe a group of young teenage girls who are grouping for a moment around Polaroid cameras, before a father and his daughter are thinking about buying a Crosley turntable."</seg>
<seg id="56">"on the left is a staircase, a wall full of panels of Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mixture of contemporary music and classics, the essential plates for an average collection."</seg>
<seg id="57">"no one sees them - perhaps because they are purely decorative, some so far above that it is impossible to touch them."</seg>
<seg id="58">It is pure "record art."</seg>
<seg id="59">"but considering that any attraction for these items would mean more money for the industry and could send some customers to the depths of Soho for more, there is nothing to complain."</seg>
<seg id="60">"it is no surprise that a population group that has more time and money than others, is also the one that is most common for luxury items such as plates."</seg>
<seg id="61">"even though my research shows that the results of YouGov agree, they leave, at least in record stores in Soho, the large number of female collectors and record lovers that exist in reality, record stores and online forums."</seg>
<seg id="62">These people probably work hard at school or in offices.</seg>
<seg id="63">"they spend their Thursday morning with security not with the bumblebee through record stores of Berwick Street and the leaves by plates, while they steer clear of an uncanny, 30-year-old false moderator, who outstands anything of middle-aged men over the shoulders."</seg>

<seg id="2">"a French court rejected an offer by the authorities in Calais, dozens of temporary shops and restaurants in the jungle of Calais where thousands of refugees live."</seg>
<seg id="3">"during a trial of this week, the authorities in Calais argued that the state should be authorised to sell 72 temporary stores in which individuals sell or sell tea for 50 cents (40 pence) or simple meals for a few euros in temporary restaurants."</seg>
<seg id="4">Calais prefecture argues that these places should be torn down because they would represent a parallel economy from which no taxes would be paid and which lodge a fire and sanity risk.</seg>
<seg id="5">"humanitarian groups shared the court that the shops and restaurants are important, as the free meals offered by the state-supported union and other groups will not provide enough food for the growing numbers in the camp."</seg>
<seg id="6">They also led to the provisional shops and restaurants often provide accommodation and free meals for people in need.</seg>
<seg id="7">"a court in Lille decided that there would be no legal basis for the deportation of people who run the 72 provisional businesses, but admitted that the concerns of the prefecture of Calais were absolutely traceable."</seg>
<seg id="8">"the judge Jean-François Molla said that food stores, cafés and restaurants would play a much larger role than merely to feed people living in extremely precarious conditions."</seg>
<seg id="9">He said that the areas offer calm meetings between refugees and volunteers.</seg>
<seg id="10">"one of the places threatened by the rainfall was the Jungle Book Kids' Café of the camp, which is charitable and 200 meals a day, English and French classes, as well as advice on asylum cases for hundreds of vulnerable, unaccompanied minors in the camp."</seg>
<seg id="11">More than 170.000 people signed the petition to preserve the Kids' Café.</seg>
<seg id="12">"in a letter to the Guardian, it was meant that" closure "would be a disaster for these children, of which the youngest is eight years old."</seg>
<seg id="13">"the two relief organisations Help Refugees and L'Auberge des Migrants estimated on Friday that the number of people in the jungle camp had risen to more than 9,000 people - the highest number until now - after a steep increase in newcomers over the summer."</seg>

<seg id="2">"in the final on Thursday evening, the impressive performance of Great Britain's 7-day rugby came to an abrupt stop at the last hurdle in the form of Fijis, when they were hit here in Rio with a result of 43-7 in the Deodoro Stadium."</seg>
<seg id="3">"Fiji divided a Master Class in the Handling, Side-Stepping, Nightmare, Line run and roher strength to win gold - her first Olympic medal of any color."</seg>
<seg id="4">"the defeat was swept through the not too bad trophy of the silver medal - Britain's fourth on that day - and they could be proud of their efforts in this tournament, in which they hit New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa."</seg>
<seg id="5">"the massive defeat of the Boks, 7-5 in the semi-finals on the same day could fall back on them in the final."</seg>
<seg id="6">"however, regardless of that Fiji would have beaten a 15-man-team in the form of this form."</seg>
<seg id="7">"it could be a consolation for GB - but it probably won't - that at least one Brite tomorrow will have a gold medal for his neck: Fijis boss trainer Ben Ryan, the former head for England from Wimbledon."</seg>
<seg id="8">GB had a difficult path behind him.</seg>
<seg id="9">"eight years ago, she lost every game at the Adelaide Sevens."</seg>
<seg id="10">Here they lost only one.</seg>
<seg id="11">"this flap will hurt, but progress is amazing."</seg>
<seg id="12">Fiji began wondering and allowed the attacks to bounce out of fun.</seg>
<seg id="13">"it felt for the captain Tom Mitchell an and Co., as if one would run into driving buses. the World Series winners went up 5-0 upwards, when Osea Kolinisau was brightened up in the corner."</seg>
<seg id="14">"with four minutes of playing time, Jerry Tuwai added another attack from the right corner, which he changed."</seg>
<seg id="15">12-0 and GB hardly touched the ball.</seg>
<seg id="16">"a vice-president of Mitchell halted the mountain of Man Leone Nakarawa to achieve a third goal, but it has only stopped Fiji."</seg>
<seg id="17">In the seventh minute jasa Veremalua left a touch down in the right corner and it stood 0-17 for GB.</seg>
<seg id="18">Nakarawa added a new one since the restart and there were always over a minute of playing time... in the first half.</seg>
<seg id="19">Vatemo Ravouvou presided by further weak Tacklings of the GB team and stormed up to the line to make a gate.</seg>
<seg id="20">The transformation brought a 29-0 to a break.</seg>
<seg id="21">"it is as if Fiji was born to play the 7, while GB still seeded."</seg>
<seg id="22">This is how it is.</seg>
<seg id="23">"GB conducted basic changes in the half-time and closed the fijian gap... for whole four minutes, which was good for the conditions of the first half-time, until Joshua Tuisova ran through a brilliant interplay of Fiji."</seg>
<seg id="24">"Dan Norton started an attempt for GB, made a touch down in the left corner for a 36-7, but the game already ran for a long time in favor of the South African sulans, whose fans sang, flags and danced on the grandstand."</seg>
<seg id="25">It was not difficult to admire the playful approach of Fijis.</seg>
<seg id="26">Mata Viliame set the icing on the cake with another attempt in the last seconds.</seg>

<seg id="2">There will be no more emotional gold than with these games and that wants to be hot.</seg>
<seg id="3">"from the first rudder to the last, 220 hard hieve that entered into history, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found an extra meaning in their golden moment at the Estacio da Lagoa."</seg>
<seg id="4">"even though there were only those who sat on the helm, there were three voices in the boat. the echo of the trainer Robin Williams, was omnipresent when she was the second Olympiad in the second without a tax woman, the first women in the history of British sports who put such a benchmark."</seg>
<seg id="5">"her dominance was absolutely, after all, her 39.her undefeated bet, which is also unparalleled."</seg>
<seg id="6">"what we see are two brilliant athletes, who slide over the surface with the elegance of swans, which does not reflect the type of triumphal damage."</seg>
<seg id="7">"behind every gold in the rowing there is a battalion of wild helpers who make up the incremental progress that makes the difference and it was no one, worse than the coach who didn't know that day before he was diagnosed with cancer."</seg>
<seg id="8">"as he said, he was risky."</seg>
<seg id="9">"I had bladder cancer, which is operable and that did it."</seg>
<seg id="10">"if you do not do that, it spreads everywhere."</seg>
<seg id="11">It would have been a rather bad situation.</seg>
<seg id="12">It changes a little the outlook.</seg>
<seg id="13">Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.</seg>
<seg id="14">"the trio had luck that he could start treatment at the beginning of 2014, out of season, which kept the interruption to a minimum, if under such circumstances the right term is at all."</seg>
<seg id="15">"I needed money, so I had to go better again soon."</seg>
<seg id="16">It was an incentive.</seg>
<seg id="17">"I was in the hospital and ran around on the station - 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet at a time when they said that some steps would suffice."</seg>
<seg id="18">This is how it begins.</seg>
<seg id="19">"the rowing itself is already a challenge, but that makes it an even bigger one."</seg>
<seg id="20">"in the immediacy of victory, her first thoughts went to Williams, who spent a more annoying morning with a little more than usual, trying to process his own fears."</seg>
<seg id="21">"Stanning, who was the centurion in the Royal Artillery Regiment in a deployment in Afghanistan, said" "I was an emotional wreck this week. it might be a bit extreme, but it means so much."</seg>
<seg id="22">"it repeats only how much I and Helen, and also Robin, have worked."</seg>
<seg id="23">There were three fantastic years with Helen and Robin.</seg>
<seg id="24">"without Robin we would be no one, so a massive thank you to him. he is the best trainer of the world."</seg>
<seg id="25">I couldn't have wished for better training or a better trainer.</seg>
<seg id="26">Helena Glover and Heather Stanning have not lost a race in the last five years.</seg>
<seg id="27">The couple had a hard rhythm with which their opponents could not keep up with.</seg>
<seg id="28">"even in the last 500 meters, when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark started to start, Stanning and Glover had too much in reserve."</seg>
<seg id="29">We were caught very at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="30">"Helen called" "stay in the process, stay in the process." ""</seg>
<seg id="31">It is really important to not let yourself be carried away.</seg>
<seg id="32">We had a good start and at the same time we weren't expecting to do something great.</seg>
<seg id="33">"today we didn't want a firework, we just wanted to achieve a good result, go out and win the race what we did."</seg>
<seg id="34">The couple will take a break for one year before making decisions about his future.</seg>
<seg id="35">"Glover must appear next week on a wedding, your own with the TV adventure Steve Backshall."</seg>
<seg id="36">Now she just wants to enjoy the moment.</seg>
<seg id="37">I didn't want to say that it was my last race.</seg>
<seg id="38">That would have meant too much pressure.</seg>
<seg id="39">"in London, it took about six months to understand that I am an Olympic champion."</seg>

<seg id="41">It took about four minutes.</seg>

<seg id="2">The crisis-torn and energy-intensive German steel industry has spared additional costs in millions of dollars.</seg>
<seg id="3">Financial burdens that the industry threatened from green electricity funding are from the table.</seg>
<seg id="4">"it remains in the release of the Renewable Energy environment in the constituents of the so-called self-current production in the German steel industry, said Federal Minister of Economic Affairs, Sigmar Gabriel (SPD) of the" Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung "(WAZ, Friday issue)."</seg>
<seg id="5">I am really happy that we could finally reach negotiations after two years of tough negotiations.</seg>
<seg id="6">"the European Commission had initially planned to use the steel producers, the gases out of the blast furnace for power generation for their own consumption, to ask for the cashier."</seg>
<seg id="7">"according to the German industry association, the steel industry threatened additional costs of 120 to 240 million euros per year."</seg>
<seg id="8">"Gabriel said the WAZ, there is now a basic agreement with the European Commission for talks with the Commissioner Margrethe Vestager."</seg>
<seg id="9">"only when the generators in the steel units are replaced, an EEG-levelling is 20 percent."</seg>
<seg id="10">"but, too, this will not be raised in the steel industry."</seg>
<seg id="11">IG Metall welcomed Germany's agreement with the European Commission for self-power production.</seg>
<seg id="12">"in this way, the status quo of the previous scheme is largely determined."</seg>
<seg id="13">The successful efforts of Gabriel for the steel industry have special significance.</seg>
<seg id="14">"with regard to our campaign 'Stahl is Future', this is a first step."</seg>
<seg id="15">"others have to follow."</seg>
<seg id="16">"also in the reform of the emission rights sector, climate and employment targets are weakened," said IG Metall leader Jörg Hofmann in Frankfurt. "</seg>
<seg id="17">The steel branch in Europe has been suffering from overcapacity since the financial crisis in 2008 and a significant price pressure.</seg>
<seg id="18">"last year, the situation was further aggravated as the world's largest producer in China threw masses of steel on the world market in view of the weakening domestic demand."</seg>
<seg id="19">European manufacturers have launched price dumping Chinese steel companies.</seg>
<seg id="20">"in the course of this spring, the situation has somewhat relaxed."</seg>
<seg id="21">"on the one hand, installed import duties on imported steel effect, on the other hand, the economic prospects in China have slowed."</seg>
<seg id="22">"unclear, how sustainable the price recovery is."</seg>
<seg id="23">The German industry primus Thyssenkrupp was cautious on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="24">"last but not least, prices would have been rather stagnating."</seg>
<seg id="25">The industry responds to the difficult situation with further cost reductions.</seg>
<seg id="26">ThyssenKrupp did not want to exclude finally also lockings of individual plants.</seg>
<seg id="27">"in the German steel industry, some 860,000 people were employed at the end of 2015."</seg>
<seg id="28">"in July, German steel producers remain cautious despite rising prices and increasing orders."</seg>

<seg id="1">"community, Spirit, Health: singing is good seniors"</seg>
<seg id="2">"the singing has accompanied Ursel Kipp all her life: as young girl she was in the school choir, in the teacher's degree, she took the subject of music, and today the 78-year-old sings in a seniors choir."</seg>
<seg id="3">"singing moves me - emotionally and physically," she describes. "</seg>
<seg id="4">"after a rehearsal, she feels balanced, cheerful and totally alive, she says."</seg>
<seg id="5">"by the way, she does something good for her health and spirit."</seg>
<seg id="6">"singing is a great hobby for seniors from several perspectives, says Erhard Hackler from the German senior league."</seg>
<seg id="7">"most seniors sing in the choir and share with like-minded the joy of music, describes Hackler."</seg>
<seg id="8">"by regular cohesion, seniors can socialize and maintain social contacts."</seg>
<seg id="9">"because often social and family structures dissolve in old age, a choir is then an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people."</seg>
<seg id="10">"this experience has also made Ursel Kipp in her choir:" to speak and organize, to be able to leave and to learn from one another - a choir is a very special form of being together. "</seg>
<seg id="11">"singing can be strenuous in the positive sense, says Hackler."</seg>
<seg id="12">"for doing so, seniors train a deep and controlled breathing."</seg>
<seg id="13">Those who demand his lungs regularly get out of the puste even in everyday life.</seg>
<seg id="14">"even if it comes to receiving the sound of the voice at the age, singing is an optimal hobby."</seg>
<seg id="15">"on older people, singing often has a very special effect, says Ursula Lenz from the Federal Labour Association of Senior Citizens."</seg>
<seg id="16">"in the older generations, common singing had a much higher priority, it belonged to everyday life, both at school and in leisure time, she explains."</seg>
<seg id="17">"Lenz often observes that singing or hearing songs in elderly people awakens a lot of memories, often associated with positive feelings of their adolescence."</seg>
<seg id="18">"through lyrics and especially melodies, even dementia people abound for long past events."</seg>
<seg id="19">"in singing, the head also requires a special performance, explains Lenz."</seg>
<seg id="20">"at the same time, focus on his own voice and on a given rhythm and adapting to the other singers - this is a great cognitive challenge."</seg>
<seg id="21">"especially older people, who live alone, do not only practice themselves to concentrate on themselves."</seg>
<seg id="22">"another positive aspect is the recognition that one learns through singing in the choir, says Hackler."</seg>
<seg id="23">An enthusiastic audience is a great praise.</seg>
<seg id="24">The self-esteem also grows through singing in the choir.</seg>
<seg id="25">"show yourself: if I do a long time for something, I will better and grow beyond me - this experience strengthens."</seg>
<seg id="26">"good reasons to begin with singing, so there is enough."</seg>
<seg id="27">"who wants to try a new hobby, should not hesitate - even if he means to have little talent, advises Lenz."</seg>
<seg id="28">"you don't sing alone - with 50 singing people, who hears there when a sound goes beside it?"</seg>
<seg id="29">"in search of the appropriate offer, seniors have different possibilities, says Hackler."</seg>
<seg id="30">"if someone from the acquaintance circle sings in a senior choir, one can simply join."</seg>
<seg id="31">Many cities also offer overviews over the choirs in the surrounding area.</seg>
<seg id="32">Those who want to sing in a church choir can turn directly to the church or church leader.</seg>
<seg id="33">Many senior choirs can also be found on the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="34">"who does not have access to the Internet, the family, friends or neighbours can ask for help with the internet research."</seg>
<seg id="35">"who lust has to sing, should necessarily join a choir, advises Hackler."</seg>
<seg id="36">Singing does the soul well and has something liberating - that applies to all ages.</seg>

<seg id="7">"it is directed against" "Multikulti-Wahn", "" "uncontrolled mass immigration" "and the" "loss of one's own identity through alienation." ""</seg>

<seg id="9">He said that his authority was closely aligned with the sovereigns in the decision.</seg>
<seg id="10">"groups like the 'Identitular movement' try to pick up their target group, where it stands," said the Constitutional Court. "</seg>
<seg id="11">"generally, extremists try to address them with youthful language, often with poppy music."</seg>
<seg id="12">The Islamic Islamists as well as right-wing extremists.</seg>
<seg id="13">This is no publicity for their own cause.</seg>
<seg id="14">The propaganda should address people emotionally.</seg>
<seg id="15">Young people are in a very special way vulnerable.</seg>
<seg id="16">This is dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="17">"last but not least, there have been reports from several federal states about contacts of" "identities" "to AfD politicians."</seg>
<seg id="18">"he said, he did not have any knowledge."</seg>
<seg id="19">"for constitutional protection, possible contacts of this kind are only relevant to a certain point."</seg>
<seg id="20">"it depends on whether the respective party - in this case, the AfD - by certain individuals that are extremist, changes its direction and becomes extremist."</seg>
<seg id="21">So crucial is whether such persons have controlled influence on the party.</seg>
<seg id="22">This is not evident.</seg>
<seg id="23">"with a view to the clear increase in legal crimes and attacks on asylum seekers and refugees, Maeva said that he would not speak of new right terrorism in this regard."</seg>
<seg id="24">But we have noticed in recent years that there can be right-terrorism structures.</seg>
<seg id="25">There was the group 'Old School Society' or the Freital group.</seg>
<seg id="26">"it may well be that other rights-terrorism groups or small groups form, the attacks against asylum seekers, against refugee homes or attacks from other right-wing extremist motives."</seg>
<seg id="27">"however, a nationwide or Europe-wide control of right-terrorism is not recognizable."</seg>
<seg id="28">The previous groups were created on the regional level or in social networks.</seg>
<seg id="29">"worried about the fact that many attacks went to the account of people, who had previously not appeared in the right scene."</seg>
<seg id="30">This is the worrying thing.</seg>
<seg id="31">"many of the suspects in attacks on asylum detention have not been known as criminals, politically motivated perpetrators or supporters of the right scene."</seg>
<seg id="32">"so many people have committed crimes that had nothing to do with right-wing extremists, perhaps politically indifferent, or for example, CDU, SPD or left, which, however, radicalized themselves through right-wing extremism."</seg>

<seg id="3">"after a pertinent calculation, the wastewater price in Azendorf is then at 4.37 euros per cubic meter."</seg>
<seg id="4">"as mayor Bernd Steinhäuser (CSU) reported, in the approval of the household by the Federal Council of Kulmbach, it was established that these sewage systems have undergone undercoverings."</seg>

<seg id="6">"from 1 October 2016, the citizens as well as the industrial and industrial companies from Welschahl, Neudorf, Reuth, Azendorf, lopp, Lindenberg and Zultenberg will have to intervene more deeply into the purse."</seg>

<seg id="2">"Snapchat says that this filter is anime-inspired, but some observers say it is insensitive to races."</seg>
<seg id="3">"with its filter tool, Snapchat enables around 150 million daily users to change reality and to play with identities in such a way that borders the absurde."</seg>
<seg id="4">"you can turn into a pineapple, a dog or a figure that could be of a Roy Lichtenstein painting."</seg>
<seg id="5">"the filters are uncompressed, self-propelled tools that generate more than 30 million enhanced selfies per day."</seg>
<seg id="6">All the faults arrive to the public.</seg>
<seg id="7">"in the past, Snapchat filters have been criticised in the past that they were accusing that the App Blackface promoted or would propagate white skin as a beauty ideal."</seg>
<seg id="8">"when this week suggested some users a filter that gave them slit eyes, false teeth and evaporated cheeks, some critics called a racist caricature of Asians -" Yellow face. ""</seg>
<seg id="9">"they wondered if these repeated controversies pointed out to a greater problem, that the company has diversity."</seg>
<seg id="10">"the news and the outrage were widely distributed on Wednesday, with reports from The Verge and Motherboard, a day after Snapchat announced that it had deactivated the feature."</seg>
<seg id="11">The company offered an apology: the filter was intended as homage to anime characters and not as caricature of Asians.</seg>
<seg id="12">"but outsiders who have experienced racism, the filter reminded of hurting clichés."</seg>
<seg id="13">Others rejected the anime-comparison decided.</seg>
<seg id="14">"in an e-mail, Grace Sparapani, a Korean-American art student, whose tweets were widely spread across the photos that the filter" "hurting and reading" "was unpleasant."</seg>
<seg id="15">"she added that" "it is difficult to argue with the contrast of a very contradictory Asiatic caricature and the filter effects."</seg>
<seg id="16">"it shows that the filter is not yellow-proof, but that the yellow face has been pulled into the abductory extreme."</seg>
<seg id="17">Snapchat is not the only company that crosses this cultural pride of pride.</seg>
<seg id="18">"American culture seems to be involved in an endless diversity of diversity and integration, from conference rooms to Hollywood and the devices that we all hold in the hand."</seg>
<seg id="19">And Snapchats big audience of young people - who are in terms of race different than their older counteractors - could be more likely to expect sensibility.</seg>
<seg id="20">"if one of Snapchat filters creates a picture that is offensive for a user," it is much more difficult for a user to remain unnoticed than it was before, "said the 25-year-old Katie Zhu in an interview on Thursday."</seg>
<seg id="21">"on Thursday, Zhu, who works as a product manager and engineer for medium to delete their Snapchat account, asked others to do the same."</seg>
<seg id="22">"in an essay for medium and in a phone interview, she said that she believes that rapid-related controversies have a lack of diversity among the recruitment practices in Snapchat."</seg>
<seg id="23">"Zhu criticized the large part white, only male leadership and finished her essay with a hashtag: # DeleteSnapchat."</seg>
<seg id="24">"either they have no different representation of people with other skin colors in their workforce so that they can make such decisions," "said the Chinese-American Zhu," "or they have people with other skin colors that work there, but not in positions where they feel safe or comfortable to say about it."</seg>
<seg id="25">"others share their opinion, a complaint that Snapchat has largely left unanswered."</seg>
<seg id="26">The company does not publish figures to the diversity of its staff and points to its status as a private company.</seg>

<seg id="2">"military personnel of the United States Central Command changed the intelligence of intelligence to draw an optimistic picture of the war against the so-called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, as it allowed the actual conditions on the ground to report on Thursday."</seg>
<seg id="3">"the provisional report, created by a Task Force of the Republican Party Committees, Secret Service Committees and the Wehrbudgetkommites, reports of great discontent among Central Command Intelligence analysts who reported how superiors changed their assessments to American efforts in the fight against the Islamic State."</seg>
<seg id="4">"central Command, short Cencom, is the military headquarters in Tampa, Florida, which controls American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia."</seg>
<seg id="5">"on-site information obtained from high-level CentCom commanders, a more positive picture of American efforts against terrorism as it had allowed the actual conditions on the ground and were consistently positive as analyses of other intelligence services," a newspaper article cited the report. "</seg>
<seg id="6">"what happened at CentCom is unacceptable - our soldiers suffer when bad analyses are presented to our political leaders," "presented Ken Calvert, republican member of the House of Representatives."</seg>
<seg id="7">The leadership mistakes in the CentCom range up to the top of the organization.</seg>
<seg id="8">The ten-page report shows detailed continual problems in the years 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of American efforts in the training of the Iraqi forces.</seg>
<seg id="9">"although there are no direct indications that government tips have given statements under Obama to change reports, it shows how analysts were exposed to the pressure from their superiors, an optimistic picture of the threat of the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL."</seg>
<seg id="10">"during the first half of 2015, many Central Command press releases, statements and statements prior to the congress were clearly more positive than the facts," concluded the report. "</seg>
<seg id="11">"for example, a CentCom has publicly announced that a military reconquest of Mossuls could already commence in April or May 2015."</seg>
<seg id="12">"Mossul, the second largest city in Iraq, remains under the control of the Islamic State."</seg>
<seg id="13">"after months of investigation, so much is clear." "said Mike Pompeo, Republican Congress of Congressmen from Kansas, in a statement."</seg>
<seg id="14">"from the middle of 2014 to the middle of 2015, the leaders of Central Command changed the intelligence reports to play down the danger of ISIS in Iraq."</seg>
<seg id="15">"the Republicans called Task Force to live after them, that analysts were worried about the manipulation of reports to the Islamic State."</seg>
<seg id="16">"the report published on Thursday will be completed by more detailed information, while the investigation will be continued."</seg>
<seg id="17">"in addition, further investigations of the CentCom reports are underway through the General Inspector of the Department of Defense."</seg>
<seg id="18">"on Thursday, democratic members of the Intelligence Committee issued their own findings, which coincided with some of the conclusions of the Republican Task Force."</seg>
<seg id="19">"in 2014 and 2015, CentCom created an excessive trial for the creation of intelligence assessments on ISIL and Iraqi security services," announced the high-level Demokrat in the committee, member of the House of Representatives, Adam B. Ship, in a statement. "</seg>
<seg id="20">"this process, so Mr. Schiff," delayed the publication of intelligence reports, "compensated the morals among analysts and" gave too little space for deviating opinions. "</seg>
<seg id="21">But Mr. Ship and the Democrats gave no indication of a intervention of the White House at CentCom analysts with regard to a "certain political opinion."</seg>
<seg id="22">The preliminary results of the investigation of the Congress were published on Tuesday through "The Daily Beast."</seg>
<seg id="23">"last August, the New York Times reported on investigations by the Pentagon General Inspector, which were taken up by CentCom analysts."</seg>
<seg id="24">"Cmdr. Patrick Evans, an Pentagon spokesman, gave a statement that the Ministry of Defense would not comment on the Congress's reports while the investigations of the General Inspection Group are still under way."</seg>
<seg id="25">"but he also indicated that" experts sometimes have divergent opinions regarding the interpretation of complex data, and that the intelligence services and the Ministry of Defense welcome a controversial discussion of these important issues of national defence. "</seg>
<seg id="26">The investigations have repercussions of the question of a successful aerial campaign under American leadership in Iraq and Syria (an assertion that is now made by a growing number of members of the Ministry of Defense).</seg>
<seg id="27">"however, the allegations of the past year have raised the question of how President Obama can rely on Central Command for honest assessments of military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis regions."</seg>
<seg id="28">"the criticisms of the secret information about the Islamic State are reminiscent of divisions of more than ten years ago when a CentCom analyst, Gregory Hooker, wrote a piece about it, as the then government under George W. Bush looked at only a small crews of occupation in Iraq and had little time to think about the consequences of the invasion of 2003."</seg>
<seg id="29">Mr. Hooker also played a key role in the rebellion against the current coverage of the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="30">"last year, the team headed by Mr. Hooker stated that contrary to the government's declarations of air strikes against the refineries held by the Islamic State, there would have been no significant impact on the financial situation of the terrorist group, as these provisional refineries had been put into operation to sell oil on the black market."</seg>
<seg id="31">"however, this knowledge was not published, the Times reported in September."</seg>
<seg id="32">"Centcoms damned commander, Gen. Lloyd J. Austin III, was criticised by members of the legislature because of his overly positive assessment of the war situation at a hearing before the Senate."</seg>
<seg id="33">General Austin went into retirement in April and was replaced with the Central Command by Gen. Joseph L. Votel.</seg>

<seg id="1">"the USA wins fourth match in the field hockey of women, a showdown with Great Britain stands before"</seg>
<seg id="2">"a day after having shot three gates during a 6-1 victory over Japan, Katie Bam made the first two gates for the American field hockey team of women in a match on Thursday against India that the Americans won with 3-0."</seg>
<seg id="3">"five gates in two games should actually represent a worthy performance, but Bam (27) said it could not remember that ever done."</seg>
<seg id="4">"I have no idea." she said.</seg>
<seg id="5">"I am not among the men, who keep their gates in memory."</seg>
<seg id="6">"however, this does not know: the Americans are at 4-0 in the Olympic competition and are in their group with the Britons in the first place, which remain unbeaten after their 2-0 victory against Japan."</seg>
<seg id="7">Britain and the United States will meet in the last game of the first round on Saturday.</seg>
<seg id="8">"both teams have already qualified for the quarter final, the game will decide which of the two teams will win the first and second place within their group of six teams."</seg>
<seg id="9">"first placed, the strong Dutch will take a little longer from the path that the other group will lead."</seg>
<seg id="10">"like always the game on Saturday, the Americans have triggered a surprising whirlwind through their success story, four years after they landed in the last London games in the last 12 places."</seg>
<seg id="11">BAM was part of this team.</seg>
<seg id="12">"she grew up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, and had the first time with a hockey sleeper in hands (her two older sisters played the sport at Drexel University), with 16 years she became national player of the USA, the youngest in the history of the team."</seg>
<seg id="13">She missed the Olympiad in 2008 as she could not qualify for the cadre.</seg>
<seg id="14">"then came the year 2012, in which for her and her team everything went wrong."</seg>
<seg id="15">"in the following year, Craig Parnham, an Englishman, trainer of the national team and thus began to turn things better."</seg>
<seg id="16">"a change of culture, mental change and a bodily change," said Bam. "</seg>
<seg id="17">"we did not have the work to work in London, which we now have."</seg>
<seg id="18">We have completely snatched the rudder.</seg>
<seg id="19">On Thursday evening Bam opened the torches in the first half of the game with a backlash out of the close-up area.</seg>
<seg id="20">"India was without victory in the tournament in the game, but the team showed itself surprisingly tough and kept the game from 1-0 to the third quarter until Bam took the game into their hands."</seg>
<seg id="21">"she carried out a Sprint with the flat ball on the left flank, then pulled into the middle and pushed the ball to the goal to give the American female a 2-0 lead."</seg>
<seg id="22">Melissa Gonzalez made the final goal in the middle of the last quarter.</seg>
<seg id="23">"the Shutout was the first of all the tournament for the keepers of the USA, Jackie Briggs, who had previously had to book a gate in each of the previous games."</seg>
<seg id="24">She has a run.</seg>
<seg id="25">Just like Bam.</seg>
<seg id="26">"we are in a good position," said Parnham, but how well will depend on the outcome of the next game on Saturday. "</seg>

<seg id="1">"amid the rankings of the Olympic Games, the Zen of the trampoline"</seg>
<seg id="2">"wherever you are, how late it is, it's the Olympic Games."</seg>
<seg id="3">"the events in Rio de Janeiro feel constant and inevitable, a fast-paced relay race between competition and aspiration."</seg>
<seg id="4">"it is as if the olympic torch itself is a burning rod, which is passed from the wristband to the swimmer to the gymnast to the triathlete."</seg>
<seg id="5">"you can't switch on TV, read a newspaper or listen to your neighbor's conversation in the queue in the queue, without hearing about Simone Biles, Katie Leverky or the dispute between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos."</seg>
<seg id="6">And then there is still Logan Dooley.</seg>
<seg id="7">"Dooley, who for the first time playing with the Olympic Games and a women's black with dimples, could have been among these well-known names that would be broadcast to Prime Time, if he would be a swimmer, gymnast or even fencer."</seg>
<seg id="8">"but Dooley, 28, from Lake Forest, California, fights for gold in the Olympic trampoline."</seg>
<seg id="9">The Olympic flame does not illuminate any event whatsoever.</seg>
<seg id="10">"further from the center, partly in the shadow are the sports which are not generally accepted: air pistols, archery, badminton, Taekwondo."</seg>
<seg id="11">We will always have the breaststroke and may there be a long time.</seg>
<seg id="12">"but if I should make modest arguments for my particular darling, then let me draw attention to the discreet charm of the trampoline."</seg>
<seg id="13">"although the trampoline jumping has been an Olympic event since 2000, when it had its debut in Sydney, the last 16 years it was so sparsely perceived that many of the ones I had questioned, did not know that it is an olympic port at all."</seg>
<seg id="14">This could also be regional ignorance.</seg>
<seg id="15">"although the USA sent athletes to competition, it has never won a medal in the trampoline jumping and had an athlete until 2012, who made it to the final round."</seg>
<seg id="16">The Chinese and Russians tend to share prices for the men and the Chinese and Canadians for women.</seg>
<seg id="17">Dong Dong from China and Rosie MacLennan from Canada will defend their Gold Medal from London this year.</seg>
<seg id="18">"the trampoline jumping has a certain amount of outsiders, partly because it sounds suitable for the unenlightened ear suitable for a clowns school than the one for the Olympic Games."</seg>
<seg id="19">"at this point I should admit that I'm not an expert, but only an earthbound enthusiast."</seg>
<seg id="20">"it has humoristic potential - the cartoonous trembling of his never-ending uplift - but also the grace of gymnastics and diving, the two kinds of sports, which are essentially united."</seg>
<seg id="21">"the word" "trampoline" "comes from the spanish El trampoline, which means as much as" springboard. ""</seg>
<seg id="22">"emerging victors jump on a gigantic trampoline, shoot almost up to 30 feet in the air and need a number of falling movements (turning, real and saltos) before they land on the feet."</seg>
<seg id="23">"according to official Olympiaprogram, they are evaluated according to execution, difficulty and" "flight time". ""</seg>
<seg id="24">"thirty-two athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women, will compete against each other in Rio."</seg>
<seg id="25">The common Olympic vector is straight ahead.</seg>
<seg id="26">"in their quest for gold they need to go farther, faster, upwards and over, sometimes down to the finish, sometimes back and down, upwards and downwards on the playground."</seg>
<seg id="27">"they do not only hunt the finish line or the initial wall, but also another moist destination in television transmission: the world's or the Olympiad."</seg>
<seg id="28">"the goal-directed pursuit is nobel, admirable, even fanatic - and it is enough to stir even a spectator into tears."</seg>
<seg id="29">But it is also what I think of watching these games as something exhausting.</seg>
<seg id="30">"of these, the trampoline offers a breathbreak."</seg>
<seg id="31">The vector of the trampoline is above.</seg>
<seg id="32">A forward motion is not the goal.</seg>
<seg id="33">"he or she bounces off, apparently weightlessly like an astronaut, goes up, then downwards, then effortlessly back up."</seg>
<seg id="34">"there is also competition here, of course not without difficulty, but during the exercise there is no hectic attack on the goal, no wolves in the distance, only the dreamy, elegant abolition of time and gravity."</seg>
<seg id="35">It is as Zen as the competition can only be for the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="36">"the qualifying and final hours of women will take place on Friday afternoon, in streaming by 13.00 Eastern Time; the men on Saturday, also at 13.00."</seg>
<seg id="37">NBC will radiate the final rounds as part of an afternoon block on both days from 14.00.</seg>
<seg id="38">"in the middle of the Olympia-Mania they promise a quiet, nice moment, one, probably overlooked in the general turmoil."</seg>
<seg id="39">"if the increase of consciousness can only be achieved through the attachwork and the objective of male athlete - as the male US-Turner proposed recently - according to The Wall Street Journal recently, Mr. Dooley awaits his new fan community according to the air."</seg>

<seg id="1">"a generation protested" in Ethiopia, Long an ally of the USA "</seg>
<seg id="2">Violent protests in Ethiopia</seg>
<seg id="3">Protesters who demand political changes in Ethiopia meet violent resistance of the government.</seg>
<seg id="4">Witnesses say that sixty protesters were killed while clashes with the police in shooting.</seg>
<seg id="5">Is Ethiopia interrupting?</seg>
<seg id="6">"over the past ten years, it was one of Africa's most stable countries, a solid ally of the West with a rapidly growing economy."</seg>
<seg id="7">"but in the last months, protests against the government had shattered the country and settled in more and more areas."</seg>
<seg id="8">Last week thousands of people rushed to the streets and demanded fundamental political changes.</seg>
<seg id="9">"according to human rights organizations, the response of the government was not merciful."</seg>
<seg id="10">Witnesses testified that police officers shot and kill unarmed demonstrators.</seg>
<seg id="11">"in circulation, videos about the protests, probably from the last or the beginning of this year, show how security people beat young people with sticks, while they were forced to make a stand against a wall."</seg>
<seg id="12">The chief of the UN authority for human rights now calls for an in-depth investigation.</seg>
<seg id="13">"it has always been difficult to keep this country together and in the future it will become even more difficult," said Rashid Abdi, the project leader of the Horn of Africa of the International Crisis Group, a research group. "</seg>
<seg id="14">"according to Nigeria, Ethiopia is the most populous country in Africa and its stability is valued by the West."</seg>
<seg id="15">"American military and intelligence services work closely with the Ethiopians to fight terrorism across the region, especially in Somalia. only a few countries in Africa, if at all, get so much Western help."</seg>
<seg id="16">Ethiopia's economy expanded at a considerable pace.</seg>
<seg id="17">Its infrastructure has improved drastically - there is a new commute in the capital Addis Abeba.</seg>
<seg id="18">"the streets are usually quiet, safe and clean."</seg>
<seg id="19">"even though Ethiopia was anything but a model for democracy - human rights organisations have continuously led the repression by the government - the opposition in the country has been restricted, whereby dissidents were effectively silenced."</seg>
<seg id="20">"many were sent to exile or prison, killed or driven into the wilderness of the desert."</seg>
<seg id="21">But that could change.</seg>
<seg id="22">"if you suppress people and do not have any other options except protesting, it breaks out," said Seyoum TesHome, a lecturer in Central Ethiopia. "</seg>
<seg id="23">The whole youth protests.</seg>
<seg id="24">A generation protested.</seg>
<seg id="25">There are numerous complaints that cover everything from land use to stranglehold regarding the power of the ruling coalition.</seg>
<seg id="26">"after a far criticised election last year, the ruling party and its allies received the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 percent of Parliament."</seg>
<seg id="27">"at the same time, tensions along the border to Eritrea rise; a struggle for this jagged, controversial line demanded hundreds of lives in June."</seg>
<seg id="28">"analysts fear that separatists like the Oromo Liberation Front or the National Liberation Front of the Ogaden, which have been forced more or less in recent years, could use the turmoil and arm themselves again."</seg>
<seg id="29">Several factors explain why feelings of bitterness after years of which Hinköcheln explode under the surface now explode.</seg>
<seg id="30">The first seems harmless: smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="31">"in recent years, many Ethiopians have been able to communicate with the social media because cheaper smartphone has become more and more frequent and the internet services improved."</seg>
<seg id="32">"even if the government blocked access to Facebook and Twitter what they do at regular intervals, especially in protests, many people still can communicate via internet proxies hiding where they stay."</seg>
<seg id="33">Several young Ethiopians admit that they were so called protests.</seg>
<seg id="34">"the second factor is that there is more solidarity between the Oromos and Amharas, the two largest ethnic groups in Ethiopia."</seg>
<seg id="35">The Oromos and Amharas are not natural enemies.</seg>
<seg id="36">"since eons prospered the Amharas, who come from ethopia mainly Christian high-countries, in politics and economy, while they exploited the Oromos, of which many Muslims are and live in flat land areas."</seg>
<seg id="37">But this also changes.</seg>
<seg id="38">"we are to co-ordinate under a screen," "said Mulatu Miechu, a leader of the Oromos."</seg>
<seg id="39">The greatest protests took place in areas of Amhara and Oromos.</seg>
<seg id="40">"many Amharas and Oromos have the feeling that Ethiopia is marginally dominated by members of the ethnic group of the Tigray who constitute around 6 percent of the population and are dominant in military, intelligence services, trade and politics."</seg>
<seg id="41">The third reason for the unrest is the death of Meles Zenawi.</seg>
<seg id="42">"Mr. Meles, a former rebel leader, was until his death on a non-publicized disease in 2012 for 17 years in Ethiopia's prime minister."</seg>
<seg id="43">"he was regarded as tactical genius, a man who could think around corners."</seg>
<seg id="44">Analysts say that he was particularly well versed in perceiving early signs of discontent and to use Special Representatives to process opponents and make them harmless.</seg>
<seg id="45">"the current regime is lacking in this fundamental skill," "said Mr Abdi, a conflict analyst."</seg>
<seg id="46">"Ethiopia's new Prime Minister, Hailemariam Desalegn, was chosen for relatively intransparent reasons to take the position of Mr. Meles."</seg>
<seg id="47">"unlike Mr. Meles, who came from the Tigray region of Northern Ethiopia, Mr. Hailemariam comes from the South."</seg>
<seg id="48">Analysts say that he is not enjoying the confidence of the security services controlled by the Tigray.</seg>
<seg id="49">Many fear that the result will be more bloodshed.</seg>
<seg id="50">"the last time Ethiopia experienced such an upheaval in 2005, after thousands of elections protesting, according to analysts apparently decouted by the government and subsequently stolen."</seg>
<seg id="51">"during the following raid, many protesters were killed, even though it was less than in the last months and this time of unrest went relatively quickly."</seg>
<seg id="52">"Ethiopian leaders praised Ethiopian leaders for their visionary infrastructure planning, as the new commuter train, as well as for their measurable progress in poverty alleviation."</seg>
<seg id="53">But obviously this does not prevent the intensification of the internal misart of the Ethiopian government.</seg>
<seg id="54">And it takes a dangerous ethnic form.</seg>
<seg id="55">"last month protesters in Gondar, an amharian town, of Tigray managed businesses and the hatred towards the Tigray becomes more and more common in the social media."</seg>
<seg id="56">Analysts say that the protests in the US and other western allies bring in a peculiar position.</seg>
<seg id="57">"the American government used Ethiopia as a base for dronenoughs over the neighboring Somalia, even though it recently informed that it has closed this base."</seg>
<seg id="58">"while the West clearly wants to support democracy, it does not want its ally to collapse in an already volatile region."</seg>
<seg id="59">"this," "said Mr Abdi," "is a very thin gradient."</seg>

<seg id="1">Donald Trump explains his statement Obama has been established ISIS 'sarcasm'</seg>
<seg id="2">"on Friday, Donald J. Trump was trying to scatter the last controversy surrounding his campaign by attacking his multiple repeated assertion, President Obama and Hillary Clinton would be the" founder "of the terrorist group Islamic State, not serious."</seg>
<seg id="3">This clarification gave new questions about the communication skills of the Republican presidential candidate to be able to communicate clearly and comprehensively with the American public.</seg>
<seg id="4">"it also entails his comrades who endeavour to take care of him during an eventful phase in order to explain the peculiar position, statements that he could not have meant at all."</seg>
<seg id="5">"after having made the suggestion during a campaign event on Wednesday evening, Mr. Trump was back on Thursday and insisted that he really did not intend to interpret the President and Mrs. Clinton would have created ISIS."</seg>
<seg id="6">"but in an early morning tweet on Friday Mr. Trump said, he was simply sarcastic."</seg>
<seg id="7">"the tweet was the contrast to the previous day, where Mr. Trump said in a series of interviews, he said the allegation was completely serious."</seg>
<seg id="8">"when the conservative Radiomorator Hugh Hewitt wanted to help Mr. Trump to weaken the statement, he reminded him that Mr. Obama wanted to destroy ISIS, the Republican candidate didn't want to know about it."</seg>
<seg id="9">"the last storm of criticism prasselt down on Mr. Trump, while trying to direct the focus of his campaign to the economic situation due to falling demand."</seg>
<seg id="10">Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton kept talking about the economic situation in Michigan this week.</seg>
<seg id="11">On Friday Mr. Trump trying to return to this subject again.</seg>
<seg id="12">"on Twitter, he warned that Mrs. Clintons would have suggestions for higher taxes and that he found her speech boring."</seg>
<seg id="13">Mr. Trump has already brought sarcasm to his defense.</seg>
<seg id="14">"at the end of July he drew strong criticism, when he said the Russians should hack Mrs. Clintons's emails, but later he explained" Of course I thought the sarcastic. ""</seg>
<seg id="15">This method allows Mr. Trump to shift the linguistic boundaries in politics and then call back on demand.</seg>
<seg id="16">"I think it's one of his methods to test how certain messages are recorded by his fans as they arrive, and then" clarify "depending on how the reaction falls." "said Ruth Sherman, a communication expert who observes the language of both candidates."</seg>
<seg id="17">"but I think he's clever enough to keep his statements vague enough, so that they can be interpreted in different ways."</seg>
<seg id="18">"instead of defaulting the tone for the presidential elections, Mr. Trump has adopted an even more etched sound because his survey values have gone further."</seg>
<seg id="19">"a new survey conducted by NBC / Wall Street Journal / Marist published on Friday showed a great lead in North Carolina, Virginia, Colorado, and a head-to-head race in Florida."</seg>
<seg id="20">"while Mr. Trump is generally trying to apologize for his provocative statements, he often accused his critics to distort his statements or misunderstand his humor."</seg>
<seg id="21">"but while strengthening the focus of attention in recent months of his presidential campaign, Mr. Trumps Scherze have brought his loyal comrades into the uncomfortable situation, regardless of how provocative his statements might be."</seg>
<seg id="22">"Rudolph W. Giuliani, former Mayor of New York and one of Trumps's most prominent spokesmen, gave himself great effort to defend the candidate today in a CNN interview from Thursday."</seg>
<seg id="23">"I believe what he says are legitimate, political commentaries," said Mr. Giuliani to the correctness of Mr. Trumps's statements whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had established the Islamic State. "</seg>
<seg id="24">"it is true in this sense that before Obama was an almost unknown, small organization, he called them Hindusts, completely false, and therefore it happened because he withdrew troops from Iraq."</seg>
<seg id="25">"most mainstream Republicans are trying to argue that the government under Obama, in which Mrs. Clinton served as an Foreign Minister, allowed ISIS to expand by forcing the situation in the Middle East aggressively under control."</seg>
<seg id="26">"before the election events in Pennsylvania on Friday, Mr. Trump continued his attacks on the media and accused them of running around on any of his words and to be taken against him."</seg>
<seg id="27">"he ridiculed the poor, eunuchs" TV experts who try to understand him and said, "You cannot!." "</seg>
<seg id="28">Some of the democrats sneer at Mr. Trumps excuse as only a further proof that he was unsuitable for the presidential office.</seg>

<seg id="5">"it was an act of culinary solidarity with suffering people," "said Jane Gegelman."</seg>
<seg id="6">"her husband Andrew Coe added," It was also a message to the Americans as they should eat. "</seg>
<seg id="7">The couple lives in Brooklyn Heights and are both food historians.</seg>
<seg id="8">"COEs's last book" "Chop suey" "acted by Chinese cuisine in the United States, while Ziegelman told in her book" 97 Orchard "about life in a residential house at the Lower East Side of the food perspective."</seg>
<seg id="9">"their latest collaboration," A decent meal, "which will appear on Tuesday at Harper Verlag, illustrates the history of American cuisine during the Great Depression."</seg>
<seg id="10">"they showed culinary solidarity, when they meet with a reporter in the Eisenberg's Sandwich shop for dinner, a small, tasty snack at the Flatiron District, which has been in business since the stock market crash in 1929."</seg>
<seg id="11">"brick, 54, ordered a cream cheese sandwich with olive pieces, while Coe, 57, turkey with mashed potatoes and vegetable mixture."</seg>
<seg id="12">"when the reporter ordered hacking, this found the couple for a discussion about food in the era of Great Depression."</seg>
<seg id="13">"rich foods were very popular," said Ziegelman. "</seg>
<seg id="14">"there were peanuts, Leberkäse and Bohnenbrot."</seg>
<seg id="15">"they were made from an ingredient and a little cheaper, which stretches the ingredient."</seg>
<seg id="16">Imagine eating as many peanuts that they serve them as dinner.</seg>
<seg id="17">COE grinned.</seg>
<seg id="18">"it has to have lain in the stomach like lead," he said. "</seg>
<seg id="19">"in the years before the Great Depression was the table in an American household, especially in rural areas, an all-you-can-buffet."</seg>
<seg id="20">"crews of women cooked for male field cakes and it was served freshly baked pasta for breakfast, lunch and dinner."</seg>
<seg id="21">"it was the Americans who sent food to starving Europeans during the First World War." "a Square Meal" "draws the paths that the country encircled with it, not to be the land affine."</seg>
<seg id="22">"it was a time when eating for the Americans was a central, tense topic," "said Coe, why he and his wife wanted to write about it."</seg>
<seg id="23">"the new budgetary was just as tense: mysterious food such as breads and casseries became staple food, the casserole as a" wonderful way of realizing food residues, "said Ziegelman, because cooks could hide unappetizing ingredients under a creamy sauce."</seg>
<seg id="24">Fresh fruit was replaced by cheap dried fruit.</seg>
<seg id="25">"meat, which was the focal point of the American kitchen for many years, became a rarely serversed luxury."</seg>
<seg id="26">"strange mixes have been tried, because a rich and nutritious satisfaction had priority to taste or even healthy cooking."</seg>
<seg id="27">"during their research for the book, which also includes recipes, Ziegelman prepared a dish from this epoch, baked onions with peanut butter."</seg>
<seg id="28">"it was not a popular addition at lunch," says Coe. "</seg>
<seg id="29">Ziegelmann continues: "it was surreal."</seg>
<seg id="30">Peanut butter and baked onions do not match each other.</seg>
<seg id="31">It was typical for many of the family recipes.</seg>
<seg id="32">"as never before or since, household businessmen - including Louise Stanley, head of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics from 1923 to 1943 - the eating habits of the country derhly."</seg>

<seg id="1">Greenland shark: the oldest cyclone is almost 400 years old</seg>
<seg id="2">Rare sight.</seg>
<seg id="3">Greenland sharks usually only come to the surface in winter.</seg>
<seg id="4">This shark was allowed to go back to the sea after an investigation on board the research vessel Sanna.</seg>
<seg id="5">He was born in 1624 and floats with a good 1 km / h through the North Atlantic - to the present day.</seg>
<seg id="6">Greenland sharks only get up to 150 years of offspring.</seg>
<seg id="7">"as a matter of fact, the Greenland shark floats along the North Atlantic, in an hour it reaches an average of just 1,220 metres."</seg>
<seg id="8">"only when it arrives, the five-metre-long animal accelerates at a satin 2,6 km / h - and is half as fast as a seal with this top speed."</seg>
<seg id="9">"this lifestyle influenced by slowness, however, seems to be a patent for a high age."</seg>
<seg id="10">"Julius Nielsen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues reported in the journal" Science "at any rate from a Greenland shark, who might be 392 years old."</seg>
<seg id="11">"madness," commented Alexander Scheuerlein from the Max-Planck-Institute for demographic research in Rostock this life span, which means a world record for vertebrates. "</seg>
<seg id="12">"indeed, the evolutionary biologist suspected that Greenland sharks become stone-old."</seg>
<seg id="13">Only lacked the evidence.</seg>
<seg id="14">"Greenland sharks are difficult to observe, finally they live mainly in the polar sea in front of the sparsely populated coasts of Canada, Greenland, Norway and Svalbard."</seg>
<seg id="15">"because they prefer water temperatures around the six degrees Celsius, they usually appear only in winter at the surface."</seg>
<seg id="16">Researchers know correspondingly little about the lifestyle of Greenland sharks.</seg>
<seg id="17">"their slow-bends, as they stood before Spitsbergen six animals with a transmitter."</seg>
<seg id="18">"the loot still make this shark: in the stomach of an animal, researchers found the remains of a seal, another had swallowed the jawbone of a young polar bear."</seg>
<seg id="19">Possibly they hunt sleeping animals or patrouilate at the bottom of the ice sea and seek Kadaver that torches from higher water layers down to the bottom.</seg>
<seg id="20">"Julius Nielsen and his colleagues now examined 28 Greenland sharks, who took fishermen between 2010 and 2013 in front of Greenland or Svalbard as bycatch from the depth of the North Atlantic."</seg>
<seg id="21">"the smallest shark was just 81 centimeters long, while the greatest 502 cm measured."</seg>
<seg id="22">"to determine the age of the animals, they analyzed the lenticular nucleus of sharks with the carbon-14 method."</seg>
<seg id="23">"this center of the eye lens is created before the birth of sharks, the proteins contained therein will no longer be renewed."</seg>
<seg id="24">The two smallest sharks had notably much carbon-14 in the linker-core.</seg>
<seg id="25">"their birth should therefore lie after the early 1960s, as a nuclear weapon seeking larger amounts of this radioactive carbon into the atmosphere."</seg>
<seg id="26">"in the third animal with 220 centimetres of length, the lentil detects a small surplus of carbon-14 from the nuclear weapons, it is likely to celebrate its 50th birthday in its investigation in 2012."</seg>
<seg id="27">"on the other hand, all larger Greenland sharks had normal carbon-14 amounts in their entirety, which is created by cosmic rays in the atmosphere."</seg>
<seg id="28">"in fact, the Carbon-14 watch for a 493 centimetre long Grönlandhai showed an age of 335 years, while the record shark with 502 centimeters might even be 392 years old."</seg>
<seg id="29">"that Greenland-shark females get offspring only when they are longer than four meters, was known."</seg>
<seg id="30">"now, the researchers were able to assign an age to their length."</seg>
<seg id="31">"as one of the animals with 392 centimetres probably stood on the threshold of the sexually mature age and its age was determined by 156 years, Greenland sharks with multiplication are obviously at least one and a half centuries of time."</seg>
<seg id="32">This is likely to be a world record for vertebrates at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="33">"that such methusalemes live mainly in icy waters, is no coincidence."</seg>
<seg id="34">"the previous record holder, a 211 year old Grönlandwal, in whose bacon at the neck stuck a 120-year-old harpoon, was caught in front of Alaska."</seg>
<seg id="35">"due to the low temperatures, the organism of the animals lives there on asparagus."</seg>
<seg id="36">So they mature later - and alder slower.</seg>
<seg id="37">"in order to keep warm in cold water, the animals are often very large."</seg>
<seg id="38">"the volume grows much faster than its surface, through which the animal gets heat."</seg>
<seg id="39">The heat loss of a gram mouse is therefore much bigger than with a gram of elephant.</seg>
<seg id="40">Another advantage: you have less enemies.</seg>
<seg id="41">"a smaller animal therefore lives more dangerous and should concentrate on having as many offspring as possible as possible," explains the evolutionary biologist Scheuerlein. "</seg>
<seg id="42">"a very large animal, on the other hand, should invest its resources in a long life."</seg>

<seg id="2">The ministries from the pastoral care unit Eyachtal-Haigerloch St. Anna were on the way on a four-day pilgrimage from Villingen to Freiburg.</seg>
<seg id="3">"together, four stages were overcome."</seg>
<seg id="4">"in order to bridge the period up to the next Roman pilgrimage of all the ministries in the foreseeable two years, the chief ministerial round St. Anna decided to prepare and carry out a multi-day pilgrimage."</seg>
<seg id="5">"several pilgrimage destinations were examined and one finally decided to visit the Bishop of Freiburg, where this year, on the occasion of the Holy Year of Mercy with the opened gate of mercy on Freiburg's Münster, a special pilgrimage destination was offered."</seg>
<seg id="6">"16 Minis of Bittelbronn, Gruene, and Haigerloch, and Heiligenzimmern, went on the way."</seg>
<seg id="7">"in the evening before, Pastor Storost sent pilgrims in a small celebration in St. Anna, blessed the pilgrimages and granted the pilgrimage."</seg>
<seg id="8">"from Horb, it was driven by train to the starting point of Villingen, where also a Münster cathedral of Our Lady stands, and so the pilgrimage route from Münster was taken."</seg>
<seg id="9">"each day tours were framed in the morning and in the evening by a short impulse with different prayers, songs and texts."</seg>
<seg id="10">"but also on the way, the Minis made on field cross-crosses, chapels or churches again and again to sing a song from a specially composed pilgrim song."</seg>
<seg id="11">"for the nights, parishes of the local parishes stood at their disposal."</seg>
<seg id="12">"at the stage destinations Alexandra Burkhardt and Heidi Faller made a tasty, even stronger dinner and breakfast."</seg>
<seg id="13">On the second day we passed over Furtwangen to Gütenbach.</seg>
<seg id="14">"tags were followed by the stage after St. Peter, which was the most exhausting distance, but at first we had to climb some 500 metres in the heat and then climbed up again."</seg>
<seg id="15">The deserved reward was in the evening a joint barbecue at Badweiher.</seg>
<seg id="16">After dawn on the fourth day of pilgrimage in the impressive monastery church of St. Peter we went to Freiburg.</seg>
<seg id="17">"visibly facilitated and happy, the Minis met in the afternoon at the Freiburg cathedral and passed through the gates of mercy."</seg>
<seg id="18">With a little impulse God was given thanks to God.</seg>
<seg id="19">"at the evening Mass in Münster, the Minis by Kooperator Markus Obert were welcomed at the Pilgrim's destination."</seg>
<seg id="20">"after the divine service, pilgrims were able to visit the sacristy and the high altar."</seg>

<seg id="2">Scotland's Callum Skinner raste the last night in the male team sprint in the Velodrom in Rio for fame when the British team defended the title of London 2012.</seg>
<seg id="3">"the 23-year-old from Glasgow took the anchorage, which his fellow countryman Sir Chris Hoy had made himself to Eigen."</seg>
<seg id="4">"four years ago England claimed a shocking victory, while Hoy fetched the fifth of six Olympic medals."</seg>
<seg id="5">"they repeated the trick, after they took a modest sixth place in London in March at the London Underground World Championships in London."</seg>
<seg id="6">The problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the driver Jamie staff.</seg>
<seg id="7">They did this in time as a Hinder.</seg>
<seg id="8">Hoys retirement was created a gap that Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton were trying to close.</seg>
<seg id="9">Skinner was the man with whom they stayed as they saw potential in the gravel that has now unfolded.</seg>
<seg id="10">"Hinder, Kenny - who won with Hoy four years ago - and Skinner played an olympic record in qualifying rounds, but in the standarround the New Zealanders won in the first round."</seg>
<seg id="11">And the British trio won the duel with gold.</seg>
<seg id="12">"Hinder lag behind after his lap, but Kenny brought the team forward and Skinner held it."</seg>
<seg id="13">"a change of strategy made a large part of the transformation, when the Hinder rode in a higher speed to slow it down and allow Kenny and above all skinner to keep the pace."</seg>
<seg id="14">"Hoy looked at his position as a BBC expert and fell Skinner, Kenny and Hinder, when they stepped on the podium."</seg>
<seg id="15">The 23-year-old Skinner from Glasgow said: "it's a flattering comparison."</seg>
<seg id="16">I am just here to do my best and make a name for me.</seg>
<seg id="17">"in the final round, we set up an olympic record and defeated the World Champion."</seg>
<seg id="18">It was just incredible.</seg>
<seg id="19">There is no better way to win this.</seg>
<seg id="20">"after the triumph in 2012 on the page Kennys and Hoys, Hindu said that after a weak start, he intentionally fell on track."</seg>
<seg id="21">He withdrew this statement later and there was no objection from England's rivals.</seg>
<seg id="22">"with such an outstanding victory, this time there was no such problem."</seg>
<seg id="23">"he said," "It feels like the whole GB flags on the grandstand like London."</seg>
<seg id="24">We have come together in the last three months as a team.</seg>
<seg id="25">"in so many world titles, we did so badly that it was incredible to win again at the Olympics."</seg>
<seg id="26">"this is an event, a gold medal for the nation, which were won seven out of 10 titles both in Beijing and in London."</seg>
<seg id="27">"if this is a barometer of our progress in the last five months, we expect successful five days in the Velodrom."</seg>
<seg id="28">"with the form of Kenny, it is in the realm of the possibility that he has repeated Hoys's victory of three Olympic gold medals in a competition."</seg>
<seg id="29">"that would be for Kenny - who was just 12 years younger than Hoy, who was also born on March 23rd (an apparently holy date for British sports; on the day also Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister were born) - a yield of six gold medals and a silver medal."</seg>
<seg id="30">That's the same from Hoy.</seg>
<seg id="31">Kenny takes part in the sprint that starts today and will go for three days.</seg>
<seg id="32">The 28-year-old Bolton said: "I enjoy this only for the moment."</seg>
<seg id="33">The team event is always the best.</seg>
<seg id="34">You can win it with his colleagues.</seg>
<seg id="35">It feels a bit lonely to win alone.</seg>
<seg id="36">"he said," "If he wins two more gold medals, he should be beaten to the knight."</seg>
<seg id="37">"it was the only medal race of the day, but there were other good news for England."</seg>
<seg id="38">"Sir Bradly Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doull qualified with the fastest performance in four-four km race."</seg>
<seg id="39">They arrived at the target in 3: 51,942. "</seg>
<seg id="40">"the World Record, which won gold in 2012 in London, was 3: 51,659."</seg>
<seg id="41">"the first and final round (22.42) will be held on the second day of the competition, where Wiggins will be focused on safety."</seg>
<seg id="42">"he had fought yesterday with commissioners before the qualification, when functionaries called him to measure his height."</seg>
<seg id="43">"in the corresponding women competition, continued and ended tomorrow, Laura Trott, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald of Milngavie in World record time in 4: 13,260."</seg>
<seg id="44">The GB team relies on his strong train team to dominate the middle period of the Olympic Games and get a bill of medals.</seg>
<seg id="45">"after a truly extraordinary representation of absolute dominance in Beijing and London, the expectations for Rio were shut down."</seg>
<seg id="46">"dramas in the background played in the background, so the resignation of the technical director Shane Sutton in April surrounded by sexism and musings and retirement of sizes such as Hoy and Victoria Pendleton."</seg>
<seg id="47">"however, if one sees the first evening of the competition in the Velodrom, it looks like the now legendary reputation GBs that has reached its peak at the perfect moment."</seg>

<seg id="1">Future of the melting of Portland due to the lifting of the energy contract</seg>
<seg id="2">"the future of the aluminum melts of Portland in Victoria - as well as hundreds of workstations of workers - are at stake, as the plant operator terminate the energy supply contract and thereby abolishes all supply contracts, as the supplying energy company has hastened."</seg>
<seg id="3">"this step followed the decision of the government in Victoria at the beginning of this year, no further subsidies to operate the plant."</seg>
<seg id="4">A subsidy for 20 years is running out in November.</seg>
<seg id="5">Up to 2000 jobs in the Alcoa plant in Portland are at stake.</seg>
<seg id="6">Not less than 2000 jobs - direct as well as indirect - may be jeopardized at a closure.</seg>
<seg id="7">"in addition, it could come to dominoes, as the melting process consumes about 10 percent of the total electricity generation of Victorias."</seg>
<seg id="8">"in 2014, Alcoa closed the Point Henry Schmelzerei, which led to a closure of the Anglesea power plant last year."</seg>
<seg id="9">The smelting of Alcoa in Portland loses money and risk a closure.</seg>
<seg id="10">"this step follows the years of speculation in terms of the future of the system, originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar and finally due to the power supply for the plant."</seg>
<seg id="11">"AGL, which supplies the large aluminium melting pot with its Loy Yang A power plant in Latrobe Valley, announced that three more owners will announce their contracts."</seg>
<seg id="12">"the plant is in the majority ownership of a joint venture of Alcoa and Alumina, from which the Chinese company CITIC and the Japanese Marubeni Corp keep smaller shares."</seg>
<seg id="13">"AGL assumes that the plant in Portland continues to operate, which means a further physical demand for electricity by smelting," said the company. "</seg>
<seg id="14">"AGL continued to say that the contracts were called" "hedging transactions", "which should have come into effect from November 2016."</seg>
<seg id="15">The contracts signed a 12 month notice period so that they will end in 2017.</seg>
<seg id="16">"from that point, AGL assumes that the contracts will contribute to revenues in the fiscal year 17," "said the power supplier."</seg>
<seg id="17">All potential impacts on the revenue on AGL from the GJ 18 are currently limited by forecasts of strong terminal prices for wholesale electricity prices.</seg>
<seg id="18">AGL announced that it had already written the value of the contracts in its annual subscription in the amount of $187 million in "anticipation of a cancellation."</seg>
<seg id="19">"Alcoa said that the decision to book the contracts, the" "capacity of Alcoas..." "to operate the melt or to ensure the power supply to the smelting process". ""</seg>
<seg id="20">"the US company said that 2010 concluded a 20-year contract with Loy Yang, which would have come into force from November this year, even if there is still one explanation why it resigned from the contract."</seg>
<seg id="21">Analysts warn against the bad economic conditions of the industry before the possible closure of the Portland melting shop in Victoria and the Tomago facility near Newcastle.</seg>
<seg id="22">"in reference to the statements of analysts at the beginning of the week, Head of Operations Stephen Mikkelsen said that Portland consumes around 600 megawatts and Tomago about 900 megawatts of power each year."</seg>
<seg id="23">"if both systems should disappear from the market, this would mean significant reduction in demand on the [power market]."</seg>
<seg id="24">"and for us as a generator, it wouldn't be good," he said. "</seg>

<seg id="2">"Heathrow won't only bring about renewal and prosperity in our local communities and throughout London, but throughout the country."</seg>
<seg id="3">"for me this was the biggest attraction of Heathrow, just like in 2012 in London, when we ran a great effort to ensure that all our nations and regions benefited from the games."</seg>
<seg id="4">The Olympiad brought great advantages for Stratford and the East End.</seg>
<seg id="5">And that will be achieved by creating new opportunities for local residents and companies near Heathrow.</seg>
<seg id="6">"for our local communities, we will create 10,000 new apprenticeships alone, creating 40,000 new jobs and put an end to youth unemployment in the airport environment."</seg>
<seg id="7">"as they were ahead of us in London 2012, there will be those who think that the challenge of enlargement heathrows is too big."</seg>
<seg id="8">I was told that England will never be ready for the games and that we will be blampered on the world stage.</seg>
<seg id="9">The doubters had wronged in 2012 and they will also be wrong with Heathrow.</seg>
<seg id="10">"there are always obstacles to overcoming, but Heathrow answers every question asked."</seg>
<seg id="11">"like the Olympic Games, Heathrow is for many and not for single an infrastructure project."</seg>
<seg id="12">"expansion is a way to create up to 180.000 new jobs, £211 bn in witty growth and to leave a legacy of skills and employment both around the airport and across the UK."</seg>
<seg id="13">"we have implemented a great team at Heathrow, which has implemented a £11 billion expensive infrastructure investment program in time and budget, from T5 - five years in a row to the world's best airport terminal."</seg>
<seg id="14">"now they are ready to deliver a third catwalk, which is supported by £16 billion in private investment."</seg>
<seg id="15">The 2012 London games were a great success for GB and I am confident that the expansion of Heathrow will also be one.</seg>

<seg id="2">The Venus was probably once habitable according to the projections of a new NASA climate model.</seg>
<seg id="3">Scientists at Goddard Institute for Space Studies by NASA developed a model to discover the past of Venus based on tools and algorithms similar to those of climate scientists.</seg>
<seg id="4">"the model was designed to determine whether the Venus with its hot, water-less surface and CO2-dense atmosphere could have revealed similar conditions."</seg>
<seg id="5">Scientists have previously indicated that the slow rotation of Venus could be explained by its dense atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="6">"but the latest simulation indicates that Venus could have had a thin, erdlike atmosphere and still slowly turned on."</seg>
<seg id="7">The model also illuminated the topography of the early Venus.</seg>
<seg id="8">"the planet probably showed more dry areas than the earth, but once had enough water and geographical variability to host life and protected against rapid evaporation."</seg>
<seg id="9">"the early Venus also benefited from a sun, which was 30 percent matt."</seg>
<seg id="10">"in the GISS model simulation, the slow revolution of Venus transforms its day-side of the sun for almost two months," said GISS scientists Anthony Del Genio in a press release. "</seg>
<seg id="11">"this warms the surface and produces rain, which creates a thick layer of clouds, which acts as a umbrella to shield the surface from a large part of the solar heat."</seg>
<seg id="12">The result is average temperatures which are some degrees cooler than that of the Earth today.</seg>
<seg id="13">"the model produced a history of Venus, which resembles evolution that was previously presumed by planetary scientists."</seg>
<seg id="14">"although it was probably habitable, Venus was exposed to much heat and ultraviolet light over several billions years ago."</seg>
<seg id="15">Their oceans evaporated and their steam was fired from ultraviolet light.</seg>
<seg id="16">"as their hydrogen, only a thick atmosphere withdrew from carbon dioxide with a deadly greenhouse effect remained behind -- the Venus, which we know today."</seg>

<seg id="5">40 percent of the victims readily paid the soldering required by the perpetrators to be able to use the systems and data challenged.</seg>
<seg id="6">"according to the observations of malwarebytes, the perpetrators specialize in attacks in corporate networks."</seg>
<seg id="7">"if they are successful there, the potentially explosive ransom is significantly higher than for private users."</seg>
<seg id="8">"we are currently watching a frightening rapid evolution of the damage software," explains Malwarebytes Chief Marcin Kleczynski in conversation with the "world." "</seg>
<seg id="9">"in 2008, most of the painting programs were designed to send advertising."</seg>
<seg id="10">Then the perpetrators discovered blackmailing software for themselves.</seg>
<seg id="11">"first of all, private users were the target, but the change to company attacks was horrifying in the past few months."</seg>
<seg id="12">"Ransomware works according to a simple pattern: once active on the computer of a victim, it searches for long-changed files such as word-, Excel or database files, as well as archived images and videos."</seg>
<seg id="13">These files encodes the Ransomware and deletes the originals sustainably.</seg>
<seg id="14">The software then presents the receivables of the blackmail.</seg>
<seg id="15">"to get the final encryption code to the files, the victim must transfer money - mostly in the form of Cryptocurrencies Bitcoin."</seg>
<seg id="16">"but where private users have the personal photo database on the game, companies are concerned about sensitive customer data or project databases, without which production is shut down."</seg>
<seg id="17">"accordingly, the damage occurs when a ransomware strikes."</seg>
<seg id="18">"22 percent of the affected German companies reported revenue losses due to ransomware, 13 percent even had to complete the business operation completely, in one case people were in danger of living."</seg>
<seg id="19">"in Germany, several hospitals already had victims of attacks whose patients could be threatened by the loss of patient records."</seg>
<seg id="20">"we always say to the victims: pay not, you only funding the problem," Kleczynski explains. "</seg>
<seg id="21">"but 80 to 90 percent of the companies, who pay, get their data back."</seg>
<seg id="22">"for managers, it is difficult to reject the perpetrator's claim in the face of standstill in operation."</seg>
<seg id="23">The hackers again know this and try to build a good reputation.</seg>
<seg id="24">"in an up-to-date study, the safety researchers of F-Secure have investigated the usage areas and contact with the blackjack and come to the result: the perpetrators are actually trying to build a kind of customer service to take more money."</seg>
<seg id="25">"they explain their victims via chat, how they can pay by Bitcoin, set freely accessible support websites or decrypt for free sample files."</seg>
<seg id="26">"and if private people redeem payments of only a few hundred euros, companies must negotiate some hard and pay five-digit sums to get their data unencrypted."</seg>
<seg id="27">"in view of the potentially high and relatively risky profits from Ransomware blackmail the hackers become more professional and share the work, explains safety expert Chester Wisniewski from the antivirus provider SOPHOS:" a single person can write a ransomware about within a week. "</seg>
<seg id="28">"however, it is more likely that it is three or four persons."</seg>

<seg id="38">More than 50 percent of the companies IT managers in the Malwarebytes survey trust Ransomware to be able to repel Ransomware by means of file-back-ups and scanner software.</seg>
<seg id="39">"accordingly, the perpetrators are already pursuing new strategies."</seg>
<seg id="40">"if the encryption of data alone is not a sufficient threat to successful recovery, the perpetrators are instead threatening to publish sensitive data such as customer lists or price calculations," explains Malwarebytes Chief Marcin Kleczynski. "</seg>
<seg id="41">"this means the potential for damage, depending on the type of data, is much higher than before."</seg>
<seg id="42">"in the future, the perpetrators could also fully adopt new goals on the internet of things."</seg>
<seg id="43">"on the DefCon chip conference, security researchers demonstrated how they could get a thermostat connected to the Internet under their control."</seg>
<seg id="44">"in the middle of the winter, the activation of such a blocked heating could well be worth a ransom."</seg>
<seg id="45">"if the perpetrators then block a whole production line in a factory instead of heating in the future, Ransomware could also be a topic in Industry 4.0."</seg>

<seg id="11">The tested 1.6-liter diesel with 88 kW / 120 HP accelerates HR-V thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm in wide speed ranges.</seg>

<seg id="2">"in the evenings, you roll around forever, at night you are awake for hours, in the morning you can't think of sleep long before the wake-up ring."</seg>
<seg id="3">This is anything but relaxing.</seg>
<seg id="4">"after all, one is in good company with such problems: according to the Robert Koch Institute, about a quarter of adults sleep disorders and more than ten percent find their sleep frequently or permanently than not relaxing."</seg>
<seg id="5">How do sleep problems or sleep disorders manifest?</seg>
<seg id="6">"there are several forms of sleep disorders, and it can be based on various causes, Hans-Günter Weeks, member of the German Society for Schlaefree and Sleep Medicine."</seg>
<seg id="7">"what one does not understand, however, is the insomnia, i.e. an in- and sleep disturbance."</seg>
<seg id="8">"the diarrhoea feel many people as unsatisfactory or insufficient, says Jens Wagner necht, member of the board of the German Medical Association with practice in the Lower Saxony Varel."</seg>
<seg id="9">What is behind sleep disorders?</seg>
<seg id="10">The causes of sleep disorders are complex.</seg>
<seg id="11">"there can be organic, mental or behavioural factors, but also medicines."</seg>
<seg id="12">Infrequently the sleeping disorder is an expression of another condition.</seg>
<seg id="13">"very early wake up is often common in depression," said Weeks. "</seg>
<seg id="14">And it can be that different factors are worrying each other.</seg>
<seg id="15">"who, for example, has a herniated disc, can lie poorly, wakes up every two to three hours and possibly starts to ponder about everyday problems and worries, there is an example."</seg>
<seg id="16">"this leads to tension, and sleep is no longer possible."</seg>
<seg id="17">When should you go to a doctor with sleep disorders?</seg>
<seg id="18">"who does not sleep well over a period of one month in at least three nights a week and is compromised the day, should go to the doctor, avanteed Weeks."</seg>
<seg id="19">"the impairment can look quite different: one is downcast, tired, drowned, has difficulty with the attention and concentration, is easily irritable, has mood swings or physical ailments like stomach or headaches."</seg>
<seg id="20">"to alleviate sleeping disorder, it is important to find out their causes."</seg>
<seg id="21">"the treatment options include behavioural changes, cognitive behavioural therapy or also medicines - classical sleeping pills only in exceptional cases and at most for two weeks - inquestion."</seg>
<seg id="22">"there is hardly any sleep medicine in Germany, emphasizes Prof. Ingo Fietze, head of the interdisciplinary medicine centre of Charité Universitätsmedizin Berlin."</seg>
<seg id="23">"therefore, in case of sleeping problems, one should first turn to the GP, avanteed oil."</seg>
<seg id="24">It can determine if the problems have a physical cause.</seg>
<seg id="25">"who should go to sleep lab, and what happens?"</seg>
<seg id="26">"for examination in the sleep laboratory, doctors advise physicians for example in snoring with breathing problems, in case of illness or if one does not find the cause of a sleeping disorder, explains fienity."</seg>
<seg id="27">You do not have to prepare for the examination.</seg>
<seg id="28">You should spend the day normally.</seg>
<seg id="29">"only please do not make a nap sleep," says Fiesta. "</seg>
<seg id="30">"after cabling, one goes to bed at its normal time."</seg>
<seg id="31">"besides the electrodes on the body, you wear a nasal goggles, a chest strap and a feasting on the finger."</seg>

<seg id="5">"article about this" "trendy district", "as the responsible real estate company Friedrichshain calls, however, is preferred over the last few weeks with burning cars."</seg>
<seg id="6">"the reason is the house with number 94: once it was occupied, the inhabitants rented rental contracts, but on the ground floor there are still rooms occupied and are used for events."</seg>
<seg id="7">"since the beginning of the year, especially the Berlin Insenator Henkel recorded several times for a tough action by the police against the project, the area called" no-go-zone "for policemen and 94 as the starting point of autonomous violence."</seg>
<seg id="8">"after 22 June, the rooms on the ground floor, the cadet smiths, with 300 police officers were cleared, patrouilised the police three weeks ago with 30 to 40 civil servants and three crew cars on site, locked parts of the street and held visitors from entering the house with number 94."</seg>
<seg id="9">"meanwhile, construction workers renovated the premises on behalf of the unknown house owners."</seg>
<seg id="10">"on 13 July, a Berlin Administrative Court decided that the clearance was illegal, and a day later police and construction workers went down under the cheers of sympathizers and residents."</seg>
<seg id="11">"this summer afternoon, the street works peacefully: parents walk with children, people sit on the pavement in front of the houses in the sun, others are talking vorm Späti."</seg>
<seg id="12">"in the immediate vicinity of the building projects, there is a primary school and kindergartens."</seg>
<seg id="13">"leftist violence is not the main concern of many residents: Kerstin Neugebauer, who lives in the Kiez since 1999, and Jana *, who plays three children here, are mostly generalized by the police presence."</seg>
<seg id="14">"with the inhabitants of the house projects, they share the concern of rising rents and gentrification."</seg>
<seg id="15">"it doesn't sound like a Kiez, who wanted to bring about a majority police protection from the vandalous left."</seg>
<seg id="16">"the ditch, which the Berlin interior senator and the police between house-occupiers and their neighbours, apparently does not exist."</seg>
<seg id="17">"in the east of Berlin Friedrichshain, in the east of Berlin, was actually a traditional working-class neighborhood, which today compared to the rest of the city, has a low average income and a high risk of poverty."</seg>
<seg id="18">"in 1990, numerous houses were occupied in the former East German Democratic Republic, including almost the entire Mainzer Straße close to Riga."</seg>
<seg id="19">"while the Mainzer had been cleared by a large police force in a right direction of road, many of the projects were legalized in Riga and are partly occupied by the people who occupied them 26 years ago."</seg>
<seg id="20">"at the same time, in recent years, the district has become a magnet for tourists and elective liners from all over the world."</seg>
<seg id="21">"this is also noticeable in the rents, which have risen by almost 60 per cent since 2009."</seg>
<seg id="22">"many of the new buildings in Riga are being attacked as symbols for this development: they recognize them at raised disks or newly painted façades, which were discarded with color-bags."</seg>
<seg id="23">"no other road was mentioned this year as often as" "left-wing violence". ""</seg>
<seg id="24">"a reason for not all neighbours to consider this as a problem could be that they are not necessarily affected by criminality: crimes like bodily injury, statistics are according to statistics almost exclusively against policemen."</seg>
<seg id="25">"the most part of the crimes do property damage, which tend to meet new buildings and newly renovated houses."</seg>
<seg id="26">"for Kerstin Neugebauer, who has been living in a house for 17 years, next to the controversial 94, there is no talk of uncertainty."</seg>
<seg id="27">"as for acts of violence, it is weightlifting: the people in 94 are their neighbours, they have not been this."</seg>
<seg id="28">The famous burning cars are no longer available in Riga.</seg>
<seg id="29">"for the architect, her road is not a criminal focus, on the contrary:" here one helps each other, lives together on the road and gets more from each other than elsewhere. "</seg>
<seg id="30">Neugebauer is deliberately drawn into Riga's street - and stayed.</seg>
<seg id="31">"for this reason, it was also so important that local residents returned to their streets: from the police, politics and the media, all of them suddenly claimed the interpretation of the interpretation of the city."</seg>
<seg id="32">"but in the eyes of residents like Neugebauer, the road continues to be taken away: through faceless new buildings in former buildings that displace the old inhabitants."</seg>
<seg id="33">"these are ultimately condominiums, which are not interesting for many - here are rather people who are not so well-drifted," she says. "</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "violence and destruction can I absolutely not approve."</seg>
<seg id="35">But what should one do if someone has never listened to?</seg>

<seg id="7">"Regine client from the working circle indicates that the volunteers are more than grateful that Deuschle is now there, the eiving Wollmilchsau, who has a problem above all."</seg>
<seg id="8">"in this way, some - less mocking than rather on the multitude of desired tasks had been targeted - meant as the administration wanted to write the job."</seg>
<seg id="9">"looking for an administrative manager with a talent for languages and people, connected with a long-standing experience in the field of social work, an insult of Wollmilchsau."</seg>
<seg id="10">"however, administrative work is not its central area, says Annika Deuschle."</seg>
<seg id="11">"above all, it is about organization, work with people on site and also behind the scenes as well as network activity."</seg>
<seg id="12">The 31-year-old has been there for about six weeks.</seg>
<seg id="13">It has a 50-percent position limited to three years.</seg>
<seg id="14">"it was high time," says Regine Client, that Annika Deule supports honest and full-time actors. "</seg>
<seg id="15">"there are large and small problems, organizational, human and understanding problems."</seg>
<seg id="16">"soon, new containers are available in the washing way."</seg>
<seg id="17">It has been a serious problem for some time to find apartments for connecting refugees that have been recognized.</seg>
<seg id="18">The municipalities are responsible for the connection installation.</seg>
<seg id="19">They have to accommodate the refugees in their own or rented flats.</seg>
<seg id="20">"the costs for the construction, rent or renovation of these accommodations must bear the communes themselves."</seg>
<seg id="21">The responsibility is changed from the Council of Agriculture to the Commune and Jobcentre.</seg>
<seg id="22">"problem: there are free objects, but not every landlord wants to offer his apartment."</seg>
<seg id="23">The search has been very difficult for some time.</seg>
<seg id="24">"de facto, the administration does not find any private apartments."</seg>
<seg id="25">"so far, it does not work so far, if one relies on private apartments, Deuschle."</seg>
<seg id="26">"therefore, communities must be encouraged as it is so beautiful."</seg>
<seg id="27">New containers will soon be set up in the basin.</seg>
<seg id="28">But only with apartments it is not done.</seg>
<seg id="29">"perspective is the keyword, Regine client and Annika Deule agree."</seg>
<seg id="30">"in addition to a permanent residence there are internships, training places, training places, one-euro jobs and aid activities for refugees and migrants who need to be frozen or furnished."</seg>
<seg id="31">"more places would be good," says Regine Client. "</seg>
<seg id="32">"many work in the building yard or help house masters, do-profit work - and that motivates and very tidy, as reported by Annika Deuschle."</seg>
<seg id="33">It hopes the work for the community leads to a positive external effect.</seg>
<seg id="34">"this is" "no employment therapy." ""</seg>
<seg id="35">"however, activity does not mean just work."</seg>
<seg id="36">"the day needs a solid structure, say Deuschle and Customer."</seg>
<seg id="37">People would have to develop a sense of belonging.</seg>
<seg id="38">"so I need offers such as sports, contacts with locals and especially language courses."</seg>
<seg id="39">Professional courses are rare.</seg>
<seg id="40">So also jump here administration and volunteers.</seg>
<seg id="41">"it is central that the refugees get the feeling, they are welcome and welcome in Germany."</seg>
<seg id="42">The long duration of the proceedings is a problem.</seg>
<seg id="43">"they have to explain to the refugees that it just takes and they can make sense to bridge them wisely, for example with language courses."</seg>
<seg id="44">"who eventually develop the feeling that he could not help anyone in Urbach, should not work and be useless, he will never be able to integrate."</seg>
<seg id="45">The clear majority is motivated.</seg>
<seg id="46">"however, customers are honest," people, with whom nothing works. "the work of Deuschle and customer is therefore always to motivate others."</seg>
<seg id="47">"all this is already a" "mammoth task". ""</seg>
<seg id="48">"a difficult question: have the two of the latest incidents fear of radicalisation, even in a small community like Urbach?"</seg>
<seg id="49">"no," says Regine Client quite clearly, "what manger may call" naive. "a residual risk can and doesn't want to exclude it."</seg>
<seg id="50">But the helpers are already sensitized.</seg>
<seg id="51">These incidents are also the subject of the refugees.</seg>
<seg id="52">They would have the fear that the assassins put them completely in call.</seg>
<seg id="53">"they want to show that they have nothing to do with it," says Regine Client. "</seg>
<seg id="54">Many would like to stay in Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="55">So main and honorary officials have to look for activities on site and in the region.</seg>
<seg id="56">"in the background, they always have in the background that soon a new stump of refugees and migrants could come to Urbach."</seg>
<seg id="57">Does Germany need a cap?</seg>
<seg id="58">"to answer this question clearly, politics is afraid."</seg>
<seg id="59">"in fact, it is unfair to put them on-site helpers."</seg>
<seg id="60">"in Urbach we haven't arrived yet where we want," says Annika Deuschle. "</seg>
<seg id="61">"no new refugees, that would relax the situation."</seg>
<seg id="62">"Regine client also makes clear that the Urbacher is already busy, to integrate the previous people sensibly."</seg>
<seg id="63">"these are currently about 100 people, mainly young men."</seg>
<seg id="64">"but when people are in need, they must help them, both women agree."</seg>
<seg id="65">"the political world situation is so complicated, there are no simple answers."</seg>
