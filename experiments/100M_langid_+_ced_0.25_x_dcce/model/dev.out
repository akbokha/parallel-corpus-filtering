Obama Recei@@ ves Net@@ any@@ ahu
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu is not very friendly .
the two wanted to talk about the implementation of the international agreement as well as about Te@@ hr@@ an dest@@ abili@@ zing measures in the Middle East .
&quot; at the meeting , however , there should be a conflict with the Palestinians and the two @-@ state solution discussed . &quot;
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu has been ten@@ se for years .
Washington critic@@ ises Israel &apos;s ongoing sett@@ ling building and th@@ rows Net@@ any@@ ahu lack of will in the peace process .
&quot; by the deal struck by Obama over Iran &apos;s nuclear program , the relationship between the two has deteri@@ or@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; in March , Net@@ any@@ ahu has held an controversial speech at the invitation of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans in front of the US Congress , which was partly considered an aff@@ ront to Obama . &quot;
&quot; the speech was not talking to Obama , a meeting had refused it with reference to the upcoming election in Israel . &quot;
in an emergency call professor to have shot his girl@@ friend
&quot; in an emergency call , Professor Sh@@ ann@@ on Lamb with a somewhat z@@ itt@@ y voice of the police told him that he shot his girl@@ friend and that the officials had to come to his house . &quot;
Lamb was important to stress that his &quot; sweet dog &quot; was still alive and probably excited and he said the family contacts of the dead woman could be found on the mobile phone .
&quot; inside the house the officers found the cor@@ p@@ ses of Amy Pr@@ enti@@ ss and a hand@@ written note , which was cut on a white block : &quot; I &apos;m sorry , I could undo it , I loved Amy and she is the only woman who ever loved me . &quot; this was signed by the authorities in the letter and he was signed by Lamb . &quot;
&quot; there was no indication that Lamb , who had traveled in two online courses for the Delta State University in Cle@@ vel@@ and , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , had already traveled 300 miles to the school site , where he shot and killed a popular history professor , E@@ than Schmidt , at the door to his office . &quot;
Delta State University Poli@@ drawing ef Lyn@@ n Bu@@ ford said that university staff have heard the shooting at 10 : 18 .
he said that Lamb had made the fatal emergency call some@@ time afterwards .
until the end of the day there was another death : Lamb took the life when the police enc@@ ir@@ cl@@ ed him .
&quot; a day after shooting in the university , students and lectur@@ ers forced to hide behind closed doors , the authorities still try to get a picture of what Lamb is motivated . &quot;
&quot; the details published by the investig@@ ators at both ends of the state , as well as what students and employees who knew him helped to draw a picture of a talented , but possibly difficult teacher . &quot;
students said they were happy about his class .
&quot; the police in Gau@@ tier , where Pr@@ enti@@ ss died , said he has no history of violence or a criminal pre@@ history . &quot;
&quot; Schmidt himself had mentioned Lamb in a book written by him in which he mentioned &quot; &quot; wonderful people &quot; &quot; with which he shared his academic life . &quot;
&quot; both taught in the Department of Social Sciences and History , whose faculty comprises 17 members , and many students visited courses of both . &quot;
at the same time there were some tendencies towards problematic behavi@@ ors .
&quot; a student , Brand@@ on Be@@ a@@ vers , who praised Lamb , said he also seemed a little nervous and nervous , &quot; as if something was wrong with him . &quot;
&quot; another student , Mik@@ el Sy@@ kes , said that he told him that he had to do with stress at the end of the academic year 2014 @-@ 15 . &quot;
Lamb had previously asked the Delta State University for an absence of health reasons and said he had any health problem .
this year he taught only two online courses .
&quot; recent changes in the employment policy of the university meant that the promotion , for which Lamb had worked so hard , would not guarantee an automatic path to an appointment as Assistant Professor . &quot;
&quot; University President William LA@@ FOR@@ GE said he did not know anything about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs presentation . &quot;
these are questions that Lamb can no longer answer .
after the flight out of the campus the police later found Lam@@ bs trail when he came back to Miss@@ issi@@ ppi from Ar@@ kan@@ s@@ as .
&quot; before he could be arrested , Lamb killed himself with a .@@ 38 cali@@ ber pist@@ ol in the back@@ yard of a house about a mile south of his childhood home on the outskirts of Green@@ ville , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , said Washington County Cor@@ oner Meth@@ el Johnson . &quot;
his car was still in dri@@ v@@ eway .
&quot; it was not immediately clear why he went to this house , but Johnson said that he knew he knew the people who lived there . &quot;
Lamb grew up in the area .
&quot; Lamb began his work at the university in 2009 , which has 3,@@ 500 students in a city with about 12@@ ,000 inhabitants and taught Ge@@ ography and Ped@@ agog@@ y . &quot;
he completed his doc@@ torate in the spring of education .
&quot; one of the long@@ time friends of Lam@@ bs described him as intelligent , charis@@ matic and funny . &quot;
&quot; Car@@ la H@@ air@@ ston said , she was 15 and lamb was 20 , when they met with friends . &quot;
&quot; she and her friends were in High School , and he was the cool elderly guy who tried to teach her the guitar playing . &quot;
he was the women of women at that time .
&quot; all girls melt away when he was there , &quot; said H@@ air@@ ston , now 40 and in the Jackson subur@@ b of Brand@@ on . &quot;
Lamb and Pr@@ enti@@ ss were obviously some time together .
&quot; in the emergency call Lamb &quot; &quot; I killed my wife , &quot; &quot; but there was no certificate from a marriage . &quot;
&quot; they had a dog named Light@@ ning , who lived with them in the brick house , which ad@@ joins a Ba@@ you in Gau@@ tier . &quot;
the police said that the dog was fine .
&quot; the ex @-@ husband of Pr@@ enti@@ ss , Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , said they were divor@@ ced 15 years ago , but friends stayed and had a daughter who was now 19 years old . &quot;
&quot; she was totally destroyed by the ground , &quot; said O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en over his daughter . &quot;
she and her mother were absolutely best friends .
&quot; O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said he never met Lamb , but through his daughter Ab@@ ig@@ ail he heard that Lamb is interested in music and played blues . &quot;
Lamb met Pr@@ enti@@ ss when he and Ab@@ ig@@ ail came both on a summer fair three years ago .
later they played one or the other gig together .
O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said his daughter writes and sings her own music .
Pr@@ enti@@ ss was a nurse who worked for various companies online .
&quot; Mike Sha@@ ffer , a bar@@ keeper and sometimes entertainment coordin@@ ator at The Ju@@ le@@ p Room , a weak lit bar near Gau@@ tier said that he had finished Lamb and Pr@@ enti@@ ss Night in the night 5 . September for the last time , after finishing his guitar and mouth accor@@ di@@ onist at the end of a spar@@ se audience . &quot;
there was no indication that something was wrong .
&quot; just a happy couple , &quot; he said . &quot;
we were in the clearing and jo@@ inted with each other .
I mean they both had a good sense of jo@@ king .
&quot; Schmidt , the dead professor , led the first semester program and specialized in American n@@ atives and colonial history , said Don Allan Mit@@ ch@@ ell , an English professor at the school . &quot;
he was married and had three small children .
he studied at Emp@@ oria State University in K@@ ans@@ as and was president of his br@@ otherhood and the student committee .
&quot; on Tuesday evening , around 900 people attended the Delta State Campus in Cle@@ vel@@ and , including lectur@@ ers , employees , students and members of the community at a cand@@ l@@ eli@@ ght commem@@ oration ceremony . &quot;
&quot; Schmidt &apos;s wife Li@@ z and his brother Jeff Schmidt also participated in the M@@ ahn@@ wache , while the &quot; bright Mor@@ ning Star &quot; and &quot; Ama@@ zing Grace &quot; sang . &quot;
the lessons will be res@@ um@@ ed on Wednesday .
&quot; we try to return our students to return , &quot; &quot; said LA@@ FOR@@ GE . &quot;
the crisis is over .
this is a day of healing .
&quot; Amy and Rog@@ el@@ io Soli@@ s reported from Cle@@ vel@@ and , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi . &quot;
&quot; associated Press Auth@@ ors Emil@@ y Wag@@ ster P@@ ett@@ us in Green@@ ville , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , and Rebecca Sant@@ ana in New Orleans contributed to this report . &quot;
&quot; this story has been corrected to reflect that the police now says that Lamb opened the emergency call after he shot Schmidt , and that Lamb in his emergency call Pr@@ enti@@ ss described as his wife , but there is no indication that the two have ever married . &quot;
toys R Us plans to set fewer workers for Christmas time
&quot; Toys R Us says that there won &apos;t be so many Christmas season employees as last year , but the toy and baby products dealer says that he will give the currently employees and seasonal workers a chance to work more hours . &quot;
&quot; the company said it plans to employ 4@@ 0,000 people in shops and distribution centers throughout the country . in the Christmas season 2014 , 45@@ ,000 workers were hired . &quot;
most jobs will be part @-@ time jobs .
the company said it will start with job interviews this month and the number of employees from October to December is rising .
&quot; while the holidays itself are still months away , the Christmas business is approaching , and companies are preparing to hire temporary workers to equi@@ p shops with employees selling , dispatch and delivering products . &quot;
Michael J. Fox jo@@ ys about his &quot; Date &quot; with Princess Diana
the premiere of &quot; Back to the Future &quot; was a big moment for Michael J. Fox .
it was also remarkable for personal reasons .
&quot; we sat in the theater waiting for the Roy@@ als , and I notice that the seat next to me is empty and it becomes clear to me that Princess Diana will sit next to me , &quot; he said in a trailer for an upcoming documentary &quot; Back in Time . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the film begins , and it comes to mind that I am a simul@@ ated paraly@@ tic and a measuring length of it , to be with the pr@@ incess of Wales on a date . &quot;
&quot; back in Time , &quot; a documentary about &quot; Back to the Future , &quot; presented interviews with Fox , Lea Thom@@ p@@ son and Christopher Lloyd , as well as with director Robert Z@@ em@@ eck@@ is and producer Steven Spiel@@ berg . &quot;
&quot; back for the Future &quot; had its premiere 30 years ago .
&quot; it really is , &quot; Spiel@@ berg said , &quot; un@@ disp@@ uted the biggest time travel film ever rot@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; back in Time &quot; will be shown on VO@@ D , DVD and in selected cinem@@ as in October . &quot;
UN boss says there is no military solution in Syria
&quot; Secretary @-@ General Ban K@@ i @-@ moon says that Russia &apos;s response to Russia &apos;s military support for Syria is : &quot; there is no military solution &quot; of the conflict of almost five years , and more weapons will only wor@@ sen violence and misery for millions of people . &quot;
&quot; the UN boss calls for once again all parties , including the UN Security Council , to unite and support inclusive negotiations on finding a political solution . &quot;
&quot; said a press conference on Wednesday that he plans to meet the Foreign Ministers of the five permanent member nations of the Council - USA , Russia , China , Great Britain and France - on the ver@@ ge of minist@@ erial meeting of the General Assembly this month to discuss the situation in Syria . &quot;
he regre@@ t@@ ted that the spl@@ its in the Council and within the Syrian people and the regional powers will make this situation un@@ sol@@ vable .
&quot; ban urged the five permanent members to show the same solidarity and unity in dealing with the crisis in Syria , which they have proven in achieving a nuclear deal with Iran . &quot;
&quot; 8 survey results , which show that Donald Tr@@ ump is serious . &quot;
some have tried to brand him as a flop .
others have dismis@@ sed it as a joke .
and some are waiting for a collapse .
&quot; but no matter how some Repub@@ lic@@ ans try to pull Donald Tr@@ ump from the upper ranks during surveys , it has ( yet ) does not work . &quot;
&quot; ten of the last eleven national surveys showed Donald Tr@@ ump in the double @-@ digit range , and some begin to seriously wonder what it means for the chances of nom@@ ination of real estate Mog@@ ul@@ s . &quot;
&quot; of course , it is still too early in the election period . &quot;
nobody claims that Tr@@ ump is likely to win the Repub@@ lican nom@@ ination .
&quot; experts emphasize that at this time Rick Per@@ r@@ ys &apos;s leadership was given to the rising Her@@ man Cain , of whom no one also gained a state in the nom@@ ination process . &quot;
and there are many reasons why he had to fight in a general election .
but out@@ si@@ ders like J@@ eb Bush@@ s Super P@@ AC and the conservative business group Club for Growth now recognise Tr@@ umps staying power and start to let their dollars flow to overthrow it .
here are some current survey results indicating that real estate Mog@@ ul is not only a temporary phase :
umps Ac@@ quisition values have turned 180 degrees .
&quot; shortly before Donald Tr@@ ump announced his can@@ did@@ acy mid @-@ June , a survey from the Mon@@ mouth University showed that only two out of ten re@@ public@@ ans saw the real estate Mog@@ ul positive . &quot;
until mid @-@ July it was 40 percent .
at the beginning of August it was 52 percent .
now six of 10 re@@ public@@ ans have a positive view of Donald Tr@@ ump .
about three out of ten say that they have a negative opinion .
and these figures keep in the early states .
&quot; last week , a Quin@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac vote in I@@ owa reported that 60 percent of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans have a good view of Tr@@ ump . &quot;
two @-@ thirds of GO@@ P voters would be happy with Tr@@ ump as candidates .
&quot; in a survey of CN@@ N / OR@@ C last week , 67 percent of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans said they were either &quot; &quot; enthusiastic &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; satisfied &quot; &quot; if Tr@@ ump would be nominated . &quot;
&quot; only two of 10 say they would be &quot; &quot; angry &quot; &quot; if he was the candidate . &quot;
&quot; only Ben Car@@ son manages about the same enthusiasm as Tr@@ ump ( 43 percent say they would be &quot; &quot; enthusiastic &quot; &quot; vs. 40 percent , who say the same about Tr@@ ump ) . &quot;
the next thing about enthusiasm ?
Marco Ru@@ bio with only 21 percent .
&quot; on the other hand 47 percent of the Repub@@ lican voters say they were &quot; &quot; dis@@ satisfied &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; angry &quot; &quot; if J@@ eb Bush , the favorite of the establishment , would be the candidate . &quot;
a majority of re@@ public@@ ans does not see Tr@@ umps temper@@ ament as a problem .
&quot; while Donald Tr@@ ump is widely critic@@ ised for his bom@@ b@@ astic and insul@@ ting statements , 52 percent of the Iranian voters ins@@ ist that the Real Estate Mog@@ ul has the right temper@@ ament for a president , as ABC News / Washington Post on Monday . &quot;
&quot; the same number is in the first pre @-@ election state of the nation , the State of I@@ owa , where the same 52 percent of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans think that he has the personality for a Commander @-@ in @-@ Chief , according to Quin@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac last week . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless 44 percent think that he did not have the personality to effectively accomplish his ministry , and almost six of ten independ@@ ents say that his temper@@ ament does not fit into the White House , so ABC / Post . &quot;
Repub@@ lican voters acc@@ ust@@ om to the idea .
&quot; when they set up their guard guard , Repub@@ lican voters think Tr@@ ump for real . &quot;
&quot; if they are asked who will most likely win the GO@@ P nom@@ ination , the last week CN@@ N / OR@@ C will say four out of ten that Tr@@ ump is the best bet . &quot;
&quot; this is a change since the time , when four of ten at the end of July put their money on J@@ eb Bush . &quot;
full disclosure : in the past GO@@ P voters did not have the clear@@ est crystal ball in the past .
&quot; at that time in the last cycle , four of ten re@@ public@@ ans thought that Rick Perry would win nom@@ ination with only 28 % for the final Candi@@ date Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , a variety of GO@@ P voters will see Tr@@ umps campaign as plau@@ sible . &quot;
&quot; even if the Repub@@ lic@@ ans gathered around another candidate , Tr@@ ump strikes almost everyone . &quot;
&quot; some experts point out that the fragmented field probably contributes to Tr@@ umps leadership , while anti @-@ Tr@@ ump support is distributed to more than a dozen other candidates . &quot;
&quot; but a survey of the Mon@@ mouth University in early September showed that in a hyp@@ othe@@ tical head @-@ to @-@ head race between Tr@@ ump and most other Repub@@ lican candidates , Tr@@ ump harv@@ ested the majority support . &quot;
&quot; he has ahead of Car@@ ly Fior@@ ina 13 points ahead , ahead of Marco Ru@@ bio 14 points , before Walker 15 points , ahead of J@@ eb Bush 19 points and finally before Rand Paul , John Ka@@ sich and Chris Christi@@ e 33 points . &quot;
it is a head @-@ to @-@ head race with Ted Cruz .
the only candidate who beats him ?
Ben Car@@ son would over@@ take the entrepren@@ eur with 19 points in a hyp@@ othe@@ tical head @-@ to @-@ head race .
a scar@@ ce majority of Donald Tr@@ ump fans say they have formed their minds .
a new survey by C@@ BS / NY@@ T on Tuesday shows that only slightly more than half of the voters who support Tr@@ ump say they have firmly awarded their votes .
&quot; of course , much can happen to change this , and no one can truly say , never change the mind . &quot;
&quot; 46 percent said that they leave the door open , in order to switch to other candidates . &quot;
&quot; nonetheless , Tr@@ umps is strongest competition at the moment the other out@@ sider , the neuro@@ surgeon Ben Car@@ son , but voters who say they have formed their minds are twice as common for Tr@@ ump . &quot;
six of 10 re@@ public@@ ans say they agree with Tr@@ ump on immigration .
&quot; since Donald Tr@@ ump in his election campaign called &quot; rape , &quot; two months ago , Donald Tr@@ ump in his election campaign was the immigration and pi@@ vot@@ al point in the public discourse of 2016 . &quot;
some are concerned that the bom@@ b@@ astic expressions of Tr@@ ump will hold crucial His@@ p@@ ano Americans from the Repub@@ lican party and will damage the re@@ orientation efforts .
&quot; but after the new ABC / Post pol@@ l of Monday , six of 10 re@@ public@@ ans say that they agree with Tr@@ ump in questions of immigration . &quot;
&quot; so long as the immigration in the li@@ mel@@ ight is left , it seems to be Donald Tr@@ ump to do . &quot;
the fru@@ stration of the government climb@@ s to new high@@ s .
&quot; Donald Tr@@ ump and Ben Car@@ son meanwhile accoun@@ ted for about half of the support of Repub@@ lican voters , especially by their out@@ si@@ ders . &quot;
&quot; six of 10 re@@ public@@ ans say in the new Monday &apos;s survey by ABC / Post , they rather want a political out@@ sider than someone with government experience . &quot;
and they are angry at Washington too .
a survey by Des Mo@@ ines Register / Blo@@ om@@ berg in I@@ owa two weeks ago shows that three of four I@@ owa re@@ public@@ ans are frustr@@ ated by the re@@ public@@ ans in Congress with 54 percent &quot; dis@@ satisfied &quot; and 21 percent &quot; hell@@ ish . &quot;
&quot; Munich , Sy@@ lt and Co . : the five exclusive residential areas in Germany &quot;
here in the Hob@@ ok@@ en@@ weg is the most expensive residential complex - overlooking the North Sea .
&quot; in the street , one square meter of a roof @-@ roof@@ ed house costs 7@@ 3,@@ 300 euros . &quot;
&quot; on Sy@@ lt the range of objects is naturally limited , &quot; says it in the study - therefore the high price . &quot;
&quot; a new study shows , in which special locations one square meter is the most . &quot;
&quot; of course , 18,@@ 70 Euro per square meter for a student bu@@ de in Munich are not really little . &quot;
&quot; in contrast to Germany &apos;s top residential sites , however , one of the price is like Pe@@ an@@ uts . &quot;
the Real Estate service provider Engel &amp; Völ@@ kers has published a ranking of the most exclusive German residential sites - with square meter prices in di@@ zz@@ ying heights .
&quot; there are several tens of thousands of Euro nix - per square meter , well @-@ marked . &quot;
but good who can afford it ...
&quot; by the way : Munich is not at the top here , as an exception . &quot;
Champions League : Bavaria &apos;s dream start thanks to Müller and Göt@@ ze
double sc@@ orer in Pi@@ ra@@ eus : Bavaria @-@ Star Thomas Müller has just one run .
a happy hit by Thomas Müller paved the way to a deser@@ ved 3 : 0 at Olympia &apos;s Pi@@ ra@@ eus - then it went .
a sovereign start of the Champions League season .
&quot; the world champ@@ ions Thomas Müller and Mario Göt@@ ze gave the FC Bayern a dream start to the &quot; &quot; Mission Milan &quot; &quot; in the dragon bo@@ ilers of Pi@@ ra@@ eus . &quot;
the team of trainer P@@ ep Guardi@@ ola won their kick @-@ off in the Champions League in the Greek record champion Olympi@@ ak@@ os in hot atmosphere thanks to Müll@@ ers Doppel@@ pack ( 5@@ 2nd / 90@@ . + 2 ) and Gö@@ tz@@ es hits ( 89 . ) earned at 3 : 0 ( 0 : 0 ) .
&quot; the twel@@ fth race success in series is to be the first step towards the final on May 28 , 2016 in Italy , where Guardi@@ ola finally wants to take the H@@ enk@@ el@@ pot@@ t to Munich in the third attempt . &quot;
&quot; Müller received his 28th place in the Champions League in the Champions League for the Bavarian leadership of the Olympic tor@@ go@@ al@@ keeper , Roberto , who made a memorable shot of the world champion as a flan@@ k . &quot;
&quot; we will not under@@ estimate them , &quot; &quot; Bavaria @-@ Captain Philipp L@@ ahm promised before the game at the Kar@@ ais k@@ ak@@ is Stadium in front of 31,@@ 688 fans promised - and the Munich @-@ based word . &quot;
they showed a concentrated and dedicated idea without having to shine .
&quot; Pi@@ ra@@ eus had won his youngest six home games in the royal class , among them against well @-@ known clubs such as Manchester United , At@@ l@@ é@@ tico Madrid or Ju@@ vent@@ us Turin . &quot;
in 2011 Bor@@ us@@ sia Dortmund joined Dortmund ( 1 : 3 ) .
&quot; but Bavaria , defeated in seven Europ@@ ac@@ up du@@ els with Greek teams , did not want to be the next victim . &quot;
&quot; they went cour@@ age@@ ously , but often to work with their offensive efforts . &quot;
&quot; the attacks were often initiated by a deposit on the left @-@ hand side of Douglas Costa , which rarely passed through the former Braunschwei@@ ger O@@ mar E@@ lab@@ d@@ ell@@ a@@ ou@@ i . &quot;
Müller had more luck than his flan@@ k from the right half @-@ field in the upper left corner .
in the 67@@ th minute the World Champion gave the potential 2 : 0 .
the best opportunities in half one had Robert Lew@@ and@@ owski .
&quot; first , when Olympi@@ ak@@ os @-@ storms of Ide@@ ye Brown struck the Polish head@@ ball from the line ( 26 . ) . &quot;
&quot; then by direct acceptance , the go@@ al@@ keeper Roberto par@@ ked with his knee ( 35 . ) . &quot;
&quot; although the Bav@@ arians moved their usual domin@@ ance game , Pi@@ re@@ aus could put con@@ i@@ fer@@ ous con@@ i@@ fers . &quot;
but Manuel Neu@@ er was abandoned .
&quot; so , when he drew a shot of Ide@@ ye about the bar ( 56@@ th ) . &quot;
&quot; before New@@ er , Guardi@@ ola had defending a qu@@ ette with David Al@@ aba in the center next to Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng that made it well . &quot;
&quot; Mario Göt@@ ze , after mus@@ cular problems back in the ca@@ vern , sat outside . &quot;
&quot; after the final training , the World Cup hero gave the green light after the final training , said Matthias Sam@@ mer on &quot; Sky &quot; : &quot; whoever wants to make something different from it is already mal@@ ign@@ ant . &quot;
&quot; during the first change , Guardi@@ ola decided against him when he brought K@@ ings@@ ley Com@@ an for the beaten Lew@@ and@@ owski ( 59@@ th ) . &quot;
&quot; Go@@ ze arrived late for Ar@@ tur@@ o Vi@@ dal ( 7@@ 6. ) and made everything clear 13 minutes later , by El@@ f@@ meter Müller still got one . &quot;
in front of the game it had come to Kra@@ v@@ alle in the stadium .
&quot; after a smaller group of partly anno@@ yed Bavarian fans in their spect@@ ator block apparently had prov@@ oked the followers of Ho@@ sts Pi@@ ra@@ eus with words and gest@@ ures , the security forces interven@@ ed and proce@@ eded with bat@@ ches against the Munich followers . &quot;
at least one Bavaria @-@ Fan was injured from the stadium .
who smo@@ kes has a higher risk of losing teeth
&quot; who smo@@ kes , does not only harm the lung , but also the teeth - this suggests a Potsdam &apos;s long @-@ term study . &quot;
&quot; good news : in aband@@ on@@ ment , risk drops rapidly . &quot;
smo@@ kers have a significantly increased risk of losing their teeth early .
&quot; this results from the long @-@ term study of an international research team , including several staff at the German Institute for Nutrition Research ( DI@@ f@@ E ) in Potsdam . &quot;
&quot; in comparison to non @-@ smo@@ kers , smoking lay the risk of losing their teeth pre@@ matur@@ ely , in order to increase the 2.5 to 3.6 kil@@ o@@ fold . &quot;
&quot; the scientists had observed more than 23,@@ 300 participants . &quot;
&quot; root causes for tooth loss are tooth decay and inflammation of the gum , empha@@ sizes the DI@@ f@@ E . &quot;
&quot; for this peri@@ od@@ on@@ ti@@ tis smoking is a risk factor , the authors stress . &quot;
the link between smoking and loss of teeth therefore results in more frequent g@@ ing@@ i@@ val infections in smo@@ kers .
it is not clear to what extent smoking also increases the risk of tooth decay .
&quot; people who stopped smoking could reduce their risk however within a short time , write the researchers in the &quot; Journal of Dental Research . &quot; &quot;
&quot; however , it could take more than ten years before endanger@@ ing the level of non @-@ smo@@ kers , explained Mr. Thomas Dietrich from the English University of Birmingham . &quot;
&quot; it is necessary to convince people to become non @-@ smo@@ kers , said Head of H@@ einer Bo@@ eing from DI@@ f@@ E : &quot; smoking reduces the lifetime of life . &quot;
&quot; not smoking is good for lungs and vessels , and according to our findings also leads to a good oral health right up to the high age . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
previous studies have already pointed out that smoking increases the risk of early tooth loss .
the new long @-@ term study bri@@ ck@@ les the findings .
archae@@ ologists meet the Rhein@@ ufer in Cologne on remains from the late Anti@@ quity
&quot; for the repeated time , archaeological findings have been made on the right bank of the Rhine . &quot;
&quot; near the construction site for the new Rhein@@ bou@@ levard , archae@@ ologists of the Roman @-@ German@@ ic @-@ Museum have excav@@ ated skel@@ et@@ ons and remains of historical buildings , said Museum director Marcus Trier on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; since the beginning of the construction work on the Rhine , historians are searching for so @-@ called soil monuments . &quot;
&quot; in all construction projects in the city district of Cologne , the museum is always being drawn up as a department for archae@@ ology of soil preservation . &quot;
&quot; in the third section of the Rhine Boulevard , archae@@ ologists have now been found . &quot;
&quot; from text documents , it has already been known that in the fourth century a fortress and in the 8th century have stood up a church , Trier explained . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the remains of the fortress and the church tower , a cemetery with around 350 gra@@ ves was discovered , which probably belonged to the church . &quot;

EU Commission proposes new court in dispute over T@@ TIP
&quot; to shar@@ pen the dispute about the planned Trans@@ atlan@@ tic Trade Agreement T@@ TIP , the European Commission has proposed a comprehensive reform of the current arbit@@ ration system . &quot;
&quot; the disp@@ uted private arbit@@ ration institutions for disputes between corporations and states should therefore be replaced by a more transparent system , which in its functioning meets significantly more traditional dishes . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we want to set up a system that citizens trust , &quot; &quot; declared the competent EU commission@@ er Ceci@@ lia Malm@@ ström . &quot;
the Swe@@ de tried to introduce the proposal as European negoti@@ ating position in the free trade talks with the US .
the German government announced support .
T@@ TIP should create the world &apos;s largest free trade zone with 800 million people .
the plans for the reform of the current arbit@@ ration proceedings suggest that the EU states and the USA jointly select independent judges for a new investment court .
&quot; they should come to equal parts from the EU , the US and from third countries . &quot;
for the first time a second instance is fores@@ een .
it would allow it to appeal against jud@@ gements .
&quot; so far , the proceedings concerned themselves with one another on arbitr@@ ators , a claim against their jud@@ gments . &quot;
&quot; in the discussion of the past months , it became clear that citizens did not trust the old IS@@ DS system in terms of fair@@ ness and fair@@ ness . &quot;
&quot; in the long term , she wants to work on an international investment court . &quot;
&quot; there , for example , disputes between Chinese companies and EU states could then be clari@@ fied . &quot;
&quot; the Investor @-@ State Ar@@ bit@@ ration ( IS@@ DS ) , mainly by large corporations , are considered to be one of the main reasons for the great resistance in Europe against T@@ TIP . &quot;
&quot; the traditional arbit@@ ration tri@@ bun@@ als are critic@@ ised by opponents as a type of parall@@ el@@ ism , to de@@ duct compensation from tax@@ pay@@ ers , negotiate national laws , or to en@@ force a reduction of consumer and environmental standards . &quot;
&quot; in the first comments , anti @-@ T@@ TIP organisations , such as Camp@@ act , designated the proposals of the European Commission as inadequate . &quot;
&quot; in particular , it has not been critic@@ ised for the already negoti@@ ated free trade agreement with Canada ( C@@ eta ) . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , the German economic state secretary Matthias Mach@@ nig ( SPD ) described the plans as a great advance . &quot;
&quot; the Commission , on the reform , took into account significant points that the Federal Minister of Economic Affairs , Sig@@ mar Gabriel , agreed in the spring with other EU trade ministers . &quot;
the old system of private arbit@@ ral tri@@ bun@@ als is from the table .
the French government also welcomed the plans of Malm@@ ström .
the European business association Business@@ Europe warned against limiting the possibilities of the economy by too many new rules .
&quot; in this way , particularly small and medium @-@ sized enterprises could be dis@@ advant@@ aged . &quot;
&quot; when the talks on the T@@ TIP ( Trans@@ atlan@@ tic Trade and Investment Partnership ) agreement can be concluded on Wednesday , it continued un@@ clear on Wednesday . &quot;
the negotiations have been underway since mid @-@ 2013 .
&quot; however , the topic of investor protection has not been discussed with the United States . &quot;
&quot; originally , a framework for the agreement was to stand at the end of this year . &quot;
this date is considered to be no longer sustainable .
del@@ ik@@ ater Folk by Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens in Hamburg
&quot; eleven years ago Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens sits on stage at the Cologne Prime Club ( today , Lux@@ or ) . &quot;
&quot; next to him there is a fli@@ p@@ chart , on which the shy Fol@@ ks@@ än@@ ger recorded the picturesque US state Michigan with felt @-@ pin . &quot;
&quot; the entire audience , about 40 people , is nearly taken by St@@ ev@@ ens &apos;s lecture . &quot;
&quot; he tells you about different places he always records on the map , what his min@@ u@@ tiles and delic@@ ately arranged songs tell . &quot;
&quot; where they originated , and how it looks there , in his homeland . &quot;
&quot; since then , St@@ ev@@ ens proves to be a wonderfully creative Irish . &quot;
&quot; with the 2003 and third album &quot; Gre@@ etings from Michigan : the Great Lake State &quot; &quot; cle@@ verly composed songs , which harmon@@ ise harmon@@ i@@ ously to American folk of the late six@@ ties , but can always dri@@ fted into great opul@@ ence at any time . &quot;
&quot; the rum@@ or , &quot; Michigan , &quot; would be the first part of a promising series : each of the 50 states should follow in a row . &quot;
&quot; but already in 2004 and in the proximity of the Rhine already &quot; Seven Sw@@ ans &quot; has been published , and has a positive effect on certain expectations . &quot;
reduces St@@ ev@@ ens here .

&quot; one year later , the musician returns to the series in New York . &quot;
&quot; with &quot; Illinois &quot; ( &quot; Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens Inv@@ ites You To : come on Fe@@ el The Il@@ lin@@ oise &quot; ) , 2005 appears a nationwide celebrated masterpiece . &quot;
convincing ideas and stylis@@ tic fin@@ esse .
the album entered the charts in the US Bill@@ board and is missing in any ann@@ ot@@ ation list of influential music media .
&quot; after extremely productive experiments , St@@ ev@@ ens then uses &quot; The Age of AD@@ Z &quot; ( 2010 ) very extensive electronic parts . &quot;
&quot; this sixth scheduled studio album is still broad@@ ly orchest@@ rated , but supported by programmed sequences or beats and plays with all sorts of effect and rever@@ ence . &quot;
&quot; the smaller clubs have long since disappeared , the stage shows become a colorful spectacle from Ne@@ on @-@ forehead @-@ bands and large fluor@@ escent stage @-@ de@@ ko . &quot;
currently Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens is touring Germany as part of a five @-@ headed band .

&quot; although nearly 2000 guests are now ban@@ ished in their chairs , the stun@@ ned St@@ ev@@ ens returns to intim@@ acy and folk . &quot;
&quot; without direc@@ ting a word to the audience , the group is playing excellent musicians through the broad @-@ enriched album . &quot;
&quot; one h@@ ears from the audience : the talk is &quot; &quot; opul@@ ent &quot; &quot; and one can basically throw away the &quot; &quot; plate . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ ns debut at the Prime Minister &apos;s Ques@@ tion@@ n@@ aire
&quot; since his election Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns de@@ buted at the prime minister , with tension expected &quot;
the new Labour leader Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n is supposed to give his debut at the Prime Minister &apos;s parliamentary report and set out for the first time with David Cameron .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will rise to set the first of his six pre@@ determined questions shortly after lunch and his performance is likely to be examined by the media and the Labour MEPs .
he called for &quot; less theatre and more facts &quot; at this weekly event .
he also said he could ski@@ p some sessions to leave her colleagues .
&quot; the meeting will be the first parliamentary sc@@ rut@@ iny for Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s leadership , as it comes after his appointment as a member of the Shadow Cab@@ inet and after his speech at TU@@ C Congress on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; in the meantime , the Labour leader &apos;s decision to pers@@ ist in silence on Tuesday during a commemor@@ ative ceremony celebrating the 75@@ th anniversary of the Battle of Britain , cri@@ tically prov@@ oked by a number of T@@ ory MPs and is at the center of several title pages stories in the newspapers . &quot;
Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s decision not to sing the national an@@ them has attracted attention
&quot; a speaker by Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said he had been &quot; &quot; resp@@ ect@@ ful silence &quot; &quot; and he recognized the &quot; &quot; hero@@ ism of the Royal Air Force in the Battle of England &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; but a member of Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns Shadow Cab@@ inet , O@@ wen Smith , told the Labour leader to sing the national an@@ them , &quot; independent &quot; of his belief that the monarchy should be abol@@ ished . &quot;
&quot; almost a dozen of shadow ministers have refused to serve in Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns supreme team , and they appe@@ aled to differences in the economy , defense and foreign policy , while less than a sixth of the parliamentary party originally supported it as a leader . &quot;
&quot; the Political Cor@@ respon@@ dent of the BBC Robin Bran@@ t says that political differences are also st@@ acked within Labour , according to Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns utter@@ ances on the position of the European Union and the limitation of profits . &quot;
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said the TU@@ C conference that Labour changes are proposed to remove the whole idea of a limitation overall .
&quot; hours later Mr Smith , the shadow work and pensions minister said that the party was &quot; very clear , &quot; that it was only against government plans to lower the limit of £ 26@@ ,000 to £ 23@@ ,000 . &quot;
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will be the fifth Labour leader David Cameron ever since he has been T@@ ory leader over the Dis@@ patch in Parliament last decade .
&quot; the Labour leader , who promised another policy approach , says that he has &quot; Crow@@ d @-@ sour@@ ced &quot; ideas for questions to Mr Cameron and gave him more than 30,000 suggestions . &quot;
&quot; the Is@@ lington North MP has said that the Prime Minister &apos;s political affairs are too confron@@ t@@ ative and that he will refra@@ in from &quot; &quot; impact &quot; &quot; and stri@@ fe with hooks and instead focused on serious problems like poverty , ine@@ quality and challenges for young people . &quot;
&quot; Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said that Angela Eagle , the shadow economic minister , will represent him if he does not participate - for example when Mr Cameron is travelling abroad . &quot;
&quot; he has also put the idea into conversation that other colleagues occasionally seize the word , and that he addressed John Ber@@ cow , the spokes@@ man of the House , to discuss the problem . &quot;
&quot; when he was leader in 2005 , Mr Cameron said that he wants to remove himself from politics in the style of a &quot; Kas@@ per@@ le Theatre , &quot; which is often associated with the prime minister &apos;s frag@@ ment . but a few years later he admitted that he failed . &quot;
&quot; since it was first broadcast on television in 1990 , the prime minister was regarded as the most important bar@@ ometer of the judgement of a leader and his leadership in the House of Comm@@ ons and his position among his fellow parliam@@ ent@@ arians , although critics have argued that they have become a car@@ ic@@ ature and require far @-@ reaching reforms . &quot;

po@@ und rises through accelerated wage growth in the United Kingdom
&quot; the Po@@ und went jump @-@ nicely to dates , which show an increase in the wage growth of the United Kingdom . parallel to this , the FT@@ SE 100 was increased by the SA@@ BM@@ iller &apos;s bid target . &quot;
&quot; between May and July , the result without bonuses in the UK grew by 2.9 % compared to the same period of the previous year . &quot;
&quot; since 2009 , this percentage has been the fastest and raised ass@@ essments of the time of an increase in interest . &quot;
&quot; the po@@ und increased by more than 1 % compared to the dollar to $ 1,@@ 550@@ 5 and climbed to 0.@@ 84 % compared to the Euro to 1,@@ 37@@ 30 € . &quot;
the FT@@ SE 100 index included an increase of 1.@@ 49 % to 6.@@ 2@@ 29.@@ 21 .
SA@@ BM@@ iller was the outstanding share in the market and made a jump of 20 % after the tak@@ eover offer of the Ri@@ val AB In@@ Be@@ v was entered .
&quot; a transaction would combine the two biggest bre@@ wer@@ ies in the world and bring brands such as Bud@@ weiser , Stella Ar@@ to@@ is , Per@@ oni and Gro@@ l@@ sch . &quot;
&quot; after encouraging news from the competition group for luxury goods Ri@@ chem@@ ont , Bur@@ berry shares were 0.9 % higher . &quot;
Ri@@ chem@@ on &apos;s latest sales figures suggest all expectations and also showed that sales in China - a key market for Bur@@ berry - announces growth again .
Gl@@ enc@@ ore shares rose by 5 % after the mining giant said that he took EUR 2.5 billion by a stock sale as part of his strategy of debt .
&quot; the shares in Mon@@ di &apos;s packaging and paper company were the largest los@@ ers on the index , with a 4.3 % drop after Gold@@ man Sach@@ s had pos@@ ited his assessment of the company &apos;s rating on &quot; sale . &quot; &quot;
&quot; JD sport increased by 3.1 % , after the sport@@ swear company reported a pre @-@ tax result of 46.@@ 6 million for the half @-@ year . &quot;
the boss of JD Sports says that higher wages thre@@ aten the expansion .
the managing director of JD Sports Peter Cow@@ g@@ ill says that a higher minimum wage for UK workers could mean more purchasing power in the pockets of potential customers .
&quot; but it is unlikely that this purchasing power would balance the higher labour costs at his company , he says . &quot;
&quot; the costs could hit the expansion plans of JD Sports , he added , and that could mean there are fewer additional jobs . &quot;

PE@@ GI@@ DA poster brings Leban@@ ese to potato @-@ twe@@ eter @-@ idea
potatoes or woo@@ fers ?
&quot; both - and indeed in the Kartoffel@@ keller , which the Ol@@ den@@ burger I@@ mb@@ iss@@ land@@ owner Han@@ i Al@@ ha@@ y has developed . &quot;
&quot; inspired by the slogan &quot; Pot@@ ato instead of D@@ öner &quot; on a poster of the Peg@@ ida movement , Al@@ ha@@ y Pot@@ ato and meat have put together on a sk@@ ewer . &quot;
&quot; the idea brought him a poster on a Peg@@ ida demonstration with the inscription &quot; Pot@@ atoes , instead of D@@ öner , &quot; which he had acci@@ dentally seen on television . &quot;
&quot; since then , a barbecue sp@@ ears in its shop , which is equipped with meat and potatoes . &quot;
&quot; this is multic@@ ult@@ i for the stomach , &quot; says Al@@ ha@@ y . &quot;
the idea has meanwhile contributed to the Leban@@ ese patent office in Munich .
&quot; according to the authority , it has recently been protected as a utility model . &quot;
&quot; how much meat and how much potatoes are the sk@@ ewer , Al@@ ha@@ y does not want to reveal . &quot;
&quot; only so much : &quot; it tastes better together , &quot; he finds . &quot;
&quot; also with its customers , the culinary international understanding is good . &quot;
Met@@ cash starts ground @-@ level campaign to fight Al@@ di@@ - Ein@@ decay
Met@@ cash tries to protect the IG@@ A stores in front of an Al@@ di march in South Australia and Western Australia .
food wholes@@ aler Met@@ cash has launched a ground @-@ breaking campaign to defend the market share of the IG@@ A retailers in South Australia and Western Australia in advance of a 700 million $ Al@@ di invasion .
&quot; while Al@@ di prepared the opening of two distribution centers and the first 120 stores in South Australia and Western Australia early next year , Met@@ cash and IG@@ A Super@@ markets strengthen their relationships with local food suppliers and build the IG@@ A brand through mainstream marketing and marketing via the social media , as well as events like Adel@@ ai@@ de show . &quot;
&quot; IG@@ A dealers and suppliers jump on board , with brands such as ice producer S@@ imm@@ o from D@@ uns@@ bor@@ ough , who distri@@ butes samples in IG@@ A stores and store owners who sell approved tickets for the South Australian Football League to loyal customers . &quot;
&quot; it is expected that Met@@ e@@ or publishes additional details of its defence strategy on September 29 , when the wholes@@ aler is carrying out its annual Invest@@ ing Strategy Day . &quot;
&quot; it is a lot in the game , as South Australia and Western Australia make up almost 30 percent of Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s IG@@ A stores and generate higher profit margins as Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s IG@@ A network in eastern states . &quot;
&quot; buyers in South Australia and Western Australia are not@@ orious provincial and IG@@ A retailers have a much stronger market share than in New South Wales , Victoria and Que@@ ens@@ land - more than 30 percent in South Australia and 24 percent in Western Australia compared to around 14 percent in eastern Australia . &quot;
&quot; analysts like Morgan Stan@@ ley believe that Al@@ di will cut away around five percent of the food market in these two countries twelve months after opening its first markets and will take away all existing actors , but mainly self @-@ employed retailers . &quot;
&quot; according to a report published in this week , the analy@@ st Tom K@@ ier@@ ath by Morgan Stan@@ ley estimates that IG@@ A retail@@ er could lose 360 $ million revenues per year and $ 250 million by the end of 2016 . &quot;
the assumption of full take @-@ up tends to exagger@@ ate the simul@@ ated increase in cas@@ elo@@ ads and fiscal costs of a social policy reform .
&quot; the loss in the food and food business and in the quantities on Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s high fixed cost basis could cost Met@@ e@@ ee about 13 million $ profit before interest and tax , Mr K@@ ier@@ ath said . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , Met@@ cash loses market shares in eastern states , mainly Al@@ di and Col@@ es , although a recently conducted survey by Roy Morgan found that IG@@ A buyers are the most loyal . &quot;
&quot; Morgan Stan@@ ley assumes that Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s revenue in the food and food business is 3.8 percent in 2016 , by 4.1 percent in 2017 and 2.1 percent in 2018 and reduce the market share of 14 percent in 2015 to 10.@@ 3 percent by 2020 . &quot;
&quot; last week , the leading fund manager Ham@@ ish Dou@@ glass , the founder of the Mag@@ ell@@ an Financial Group , told me that Met@@ cash is likely to disappear within a decade . Met@@ cash will disappear . &quot;
Met@@ cash refused to publicly respond to Mr Dou@@ glass &apos;s comments .
but it is assumed that a committee member of Met@@ cash has contacted Mr Dou@@ glass last week .
&quot; since 2010 , i@@ Gas market share has fallen from 18 percent to 14 percent , and revenues from Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s food and food trade , which has been supplied around 1,@@ 200 IG@@ A retailers , has been around 43 percent since 2012 , reflecting the reduction of operative debt reduction in terms of turnover and margins . &quot;
&quot; however , wholes@@ alers def@@ enses and inv@@ ests more than $ 150 million to compens@@ ate sales prices with Col@@ es and Wo@@ ol@@ wor@@ ths for hundreds of products each week to improve their shops with fast growing fresh food and to deliver a better selection of private label foods . &quot;
&quot; Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s Chief Executive Manager Ian Mor@@ rice says that the price adjustments and charging infrastructure programs to El@@ an will be set , hoping that the wholes@@ aler will return to a profit growth for the first time in four years in 2017 . &quot;
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is is supported by the president of the Australian tennis association Steve He@@ aly
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is deserves praise rather than criticism for his behaviour .
&quot; Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was one of the &quot; &quot; col@@ lateral damage &quot; &quot; in the recent storm around his friend Nick Kyr@@ gi@@ os and deserves praise as a cri@@ tique of his own behaviour . &quot;
&quot; Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is , the younger of the talented duo , which is repeatedly called &quot; Special K@@ s , &quot; came into the spotlight with St@@ an Wa@@ wr@@ in@@ ka with St@@ an Wa@@ wr@@ in@@ ka at the Montreal Masters . &quot;
&quot; in a fier@@ y qualifying game in C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati soon after that , Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is and his opponent Ryan Har@@ rison had to be separated twice by the refer@@ ee , with Har@@ rison called : &quot; Wa@@ wr@@ in@@ ka would have to hit Kyr@@ gi@@ os , and I should beat the child . &quot;
&quot; while he was recently watched as he sm@@ ashed a tennis ra@@ cket , after a cr@@ amp had a potential US Open win by Richard Gas@@ quet , Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was fully defended by He@@ aly . &quot;
&quot; the teen@@ ager is currently in Glasgow , in the competition with Sam Gr@@ oth for the second place in singles behind Bernard Tom@@ ic in the Davis Cup semi @-@ fin@@ als against the UK . &quot;
&quot; one thing that I am quite brave is the fact that after my view Th@@ an@@ asi got a little drawn into the argument , &quot; He@@ aly said . &quot;
&quot; he has broken a ra@@ cket than he lost because of a cr@@ amp in the US Open , but he is not the first player who has broken a bat out of fru@@ stration with himself , and I know Th@@ an@@ asi enough to know that he is not proud of it . &quot;
&quot; but , really , he has beha@@ ved extremely well in the US Open , even under the rather pro@@ voc@@ ative circumstances with Har@@ rison and so on , and I think he deserves much recognition . &quot;
&quot; he has a great team around him , he has a great family around him , and I think he was a little too severe . &quot;
&quot; he is a very mature 19 @-@ year @-@ old , he works very hard , and he fits into the team and so on , he has never been a problem with the other players , he is well in shape , he &apos;s a very stable and mature young guy , and I think he deserves to be judged by his own mer@@ its . &quot;
&quot; He@@ aly also supported the decision to not consider Kyr@@ gi@@ os during the important preliminary decision , which begins on Friday and describes the &quot; common decision &quot; as the right one for everyone , but he sec@@ ures the man from Can@@ ber@@ ra as a long @-@ term solid component to return to the team . &quot;
&quot; first , we wish the team to be completely focused on the competition and not on all the controversi@@ es around it &#91; Kyr@@ gi@@ os &#93; , &quot; He@@ aly said . &quot;
&quot; some time outside the ram@@ p in which he can only think about it , I think it &apos;s best for the team and it &apos;s best for the team and it &apos;s best for him . &quot;
&quot; Europe refugee crisis : Hungary declares emergency , closes the border , keeps refugees back &quot;
&quot; Hungary explains the emergency situation and set up the southern border with Serbia on Tuesday and held all who tried to enter the country illeg@@ ally , all with the aim of stopping the influ@@ x of migrants . &quot;
chaos followed the border when hundreds of migrants participated in a Ni@@ em@@ and@@ s@@ land and re@@ acted Serbian officials with indi@@ gn@@ ation .
&quot; the people who fled from violence were stuck for an unknown time in a strip of land on the road between the two control points of the countries , and built tents and settled there . &quot;
but frustr@@ ations rose .
&quot; as a police helicop@@ ter flo@@ ated over them , the migrants launched &quot; &quot; Open the border ! &quot; &quot; and cried out ins@@ ults against the Hungarian police police . &quot;
some rejected Prot@@ est food@@ stuffs and water .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Serbia &apos;s Foreign Minister declared it was &quot; &quot; un@@ acceptable &quot; &quot; that migrants from Hungary would be sent back , while more and more from Macedonia and Greece arrive . &quot;
( Serbia ) wants to be part of the solution and not a col@@ lateral damage .
&quot; there must be talks with Brussels and other countries in the coming days , &quot; &quot; said I@@ vica Dac@@ ic in Prague . &quot;
the turbul@@ ence on the Hungarian @-@ Serbian border came a day after the 28 @-@ Nations @-@ block at a controversial meeting in Brussels did not agree on a common immigration policy .
&quot; however , the ministers agreed to share responsibility for 4@@ 0,000 people who were seeking refuge in the crowded Italy and Greece . they expressed their hope that the EU states would eventually receive 120,000 refugees , including some from Hungary . &quot;
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria called on Tuesday a special summit of the European Union to discuss the immigration crisis of the continent .
&quot; Hungary , however , did not put its hopes on a swi@@ ft action of Brussels or its neighbours . &quot;
&quot; the emergency stand out on Tuesday in two southern regions gave authorities more powers to cope with the crisis , so that they could block roads and speed up asylum procedures . &quot;
&quot; the Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to said that his country also plans to build a bar@@ bed wire along its border to Romania to stop the influ@@ x of migrants from the country , after having ended a fence at the Serbian border . &quot;
&quot; C@@ BS News correspon@@ dent Charlie D &apos;@@ Ag@@ ata reported that even prison doors were deployed in the race , the bar@@ bed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia . &quot;
&quot; in recent months , Hungary has become a significant bott@@ len@@ eck and the entry point to the European Union for many war refugees from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East . &quot;
&quot; however , Prime Minister Viktor Or@@ ban insi@@ sted that most of the upcoming economic refugees are looking for a better life , and not war refugees who are entitled to protection - a view that is strongly opposed to other EU countries , including Germany . &quot;
&quot; the new laws , which came into force at midnight in Hungary , make the crossing of the border or the damage of the 4 @-@ meter ( 13 feet ) high fence , which allowed the government to build along the southern border to Serbia , to a crime . these laws also place higher sentences for condemned human traff@@ ick@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; due to the situation created by mass migration , the Hungarian government declares the emergency state , &quot; said government spokes@@ man Z@@ ol@@ tan K@@ ov@@ acs Rep@@ or@@ ters in the southern city of Sz@@ eg@@ ed . &quot;
we say it very clearly : illegal border crossing is a crime .
&quot; the Parliament must still appro@@ ve the deployment of the military , which is expected next week , but rep@@ or@@ ters from Associ@@ ated Press have already seen heavily armed soldiers with vehicles and dogs for days . &quot;
&quot; Gy@@ org@@ y Bak@@ on@@ di , country security advis@@ er to Or@@ ban , said that authorities caught 45 people trying to cross the border , 15 others were already penet@@ rated deeper into the country . &quot;
&quot; they come over by dam@@ aging the fence , they are now in police custo@@ dy and accused of off@@ ences of off@@ ences according to the new laws . &quot;
authorities are quick to repair the fence .
&quot; Hungarian officials closed on Tuesday morning also two of the seven border cross@@ ings with Serbia , after a draw wagon with bar@@ bed wire to close the borders . &quot;
&quot; chaos surro@@ unds the most important border crossing near Ros@@ z@@ ke , Hungary , when Hungary opened a small office in a metal container to manipul@@ ate people &apos;s data and press a crowd of people to push for it there . &quot;
&quot; about 20 succeeded in entering , but thousands remained outside . &quot;
another group of migrants was blocking the most important highway connection between Serbia and Hungary and said that they would deny food and water until they enter Hungary .
election @-@ 2016 : Hill@@ ary Clinton &apos;s lead ahead Ber@@ nie S@@ anders in a national survey
&quot; the former US foreign minister Hill@@ ary Clinton continues to hold a double @-@ digit advantage in the democratic race for nom@@ ination at national level , but Sen@@ ator Ber@@ nie S@@ anders wins her face to the ground . &quot;
&quot; Clinton has now supported 47 percent of democratic voters in the pre @-@ election ( 58 percent before ) , while S@@ anders is second , with 27 percent ( increase by 17 percent ) . &quot;
&quot; Vice @-@ President Joe Bi@@ den , who has not yet announced that he will candidate for the presidential office receives support of 15 percent of the democratic voters in the elections . &quot;
&quot; more than five months before the start of the elections , most democratic voters say that it is too early to say that their opinion is determined by which candidate they will support . &quot;
but Clinton &apos;s supporters are more consistent in their choice than those of the other candidates .
&quot; since the C@@ BS news survey Clinton lost a number of demographic groups , while S@@ anders achieved some gains . &quot;
Clinton holds a big lead in women and moder@@ ates but these proj@@ ections have decreased .
&quot; their support among the men has fallen sharp@@ ly , and S@@ anders just returned here with 5 points . &quot;
&quot; Clinton &apos;s advantage with democratic voters under 50 years has volati@@ le , and they and S@@ anders are now at the same level . &quot;
&quot; Clinton , however , has a big advantage in older voters . &quot;
&quot; in the past month , Clinton was before S@@ anders with a double @-@ digit promin@@ ence among the liber@@ als , but S@@ anders has now a 5 @-@ point advantage in this group . &quot;
&quot; about half of the democratic voters in the pre @-@ elections were saying that they would support Clinton , if they were nominated by the party . &quot;
&quot; a quarter would support them with some reservations , and another 15 percent would only support them because they are the candidate . &quot;
six percent would not support them .
maybe not surprisingly that Clin@@ tons &apos;s current supporters are especially enthusiastic about it .
&quot; the views are more mixed with those currently not supported in Clinton - just about a quarter , it would support them enthusi@@ as@@ tically . &quot;
&quot; while 48 percent of the democratic voters of the pre@@ positions say that they support Clinton with enthusiasm , fewer Repub@@ lican voters say this about their nick@@ name Donald Tr@@ ump ( 35 percent ) . &quot;
&quot; if Clinton &apos;s supporters are asked in an open question why they want them to be the nomin@@ ee is the most common answer that she has the right experience ( 16 percent ) , followed by the view that it is time that a woman president is ( 13 percent ) and that she is the best candidate for the job ( 10 percent ) . &quot;
Clinton &apos;s supporters will also mention their connection with Bill Clinton ( 9 percent ) .
consent to dealing with the problems and the constitu@@ tion@@ ality are also cited .
&quot; since the Vice @-@ President raises a potential for the office of the presidential office , 57 percent of the democratic voters want to see him in the race - although a third believes he should not do it . &quot;
&quot; if democratic voters are asked of the pres@@ election , who would be their second choice for the party , Bi@@ den is at the top . &quot;
Clinton &apos;s followers say more than half that Bi@@ den would be their second choice far from S@@ anders .
&quot; Bi@@ den does not decide to channel for the nom@@ ination of democr@@ ats , Hill@@ ary Clinton &apos;s lead in front of S@@ anders , from 20 points with bi@@ ds in race to 30 points without him in the race . &quot;
&quot; fifty @-@ five percent of the democratic voters see Clinton as nomin@@ ee with the best chances of winning the election , but this figure decreased by 78 percent last month . &quot;
&quot; Bi@@ den is by far a second in this measurement , but the percentage that sees it as the &quot; sel@@ fish &quot; has increased . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , on the question of what is more important for a candidate , Democratic voters call on questions about the vot@@ av@@ age . &quot;
&quot; similar to the last month , there is no single democratic candidate or potential candidate for these constitu@@ ents of the election as un@@ acceptable . &quot;
the Democratic candidates or potential candidates provide good results with some important characteristics when choosing the pres@@ election of their party .
&quot; maj@@ orities see Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den as honest and trust@@ worthy and equipped with strong leadership qualities . &quot;
&quot; Bi@@ den cuts the three candidates best with hon@@ esty , while clin@@ ton &apos;s strength is the lead . &quot;
&quot; thirty percent of democratic voters do not believe that Clinton is honest and trust@@ worthy , twice as many say about S@@ anders ( 15 percent ) , but 27 percent do not have an opinion of it . &quot;
&quot; in general , democratic voters in the elections also generally see Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den ide@@ ologically in accordance with their views . &quot;
&quot; in all these measurements , for instance , a quarter of democratic voters have no opinion of S@@ anders . &quot;
&quot; as questions about Hill@@ ary Clinton &apos;s use of a personal e @-@ mail address and a server to be continued as an external minister , most Democ@@ rat voters are satisfied with their explanation of the matter and say that it has not affected their opinions . &quot;
but it is a different story in the American public all in all .
&quot; half of the Americans are now dis@@ satisfied with their explanation , while only one @-@ third is satisfied . &quot;
&quot; public opinion was split in March , shortly after the problem came to light . &quot;
&quot; most Americans said that the e @-@ mail contro@@ versy had no impact on Clinton &apos;s general opinions , although 36 percent said that their opinion of it had deteri@@ or@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; it is mainly Repub@@ lic@@ ans , more than six of 10 who say that Clinton &apos;s views have become worse . &quot;
&quot; although Clinton is considered honest and trust@@ worthy by the voters of its party , this continues to be a problem for them among registered voters in total : only 32 percent see them as honest and trust@@ worthy , eight percent less than last month and 15 points less since May . &quot;
62 percent of those eligible voters do not hold them for an honest and trust@@ worthy person .
&quot; at the same time , 55 percent of the eligible voters will also see Tr@@ ump as not honest and un@@ trust@@ worthy . &quot;
&quot; Clinton and Tr@@ ump are , however , good grades in leadership . &quot;
&quot; from the six candidates , Bi@@ den , Car@@ son and Bush best cut out hon@@ esty . &quot;
&quot; a majority looks rather than hon@@ estly , but as with Car@@ son many do not have an opinion of him . &quot;
the error rate for the sample of 351 Democ@@ rat voters in the pre @-@ election is 6 percentage points .
Ben Car@@ son moves close behind Donald Tr@@ ump at nationwide survey
Ben Car@@ son is close behind Donald Tr@@ ump in the latest survey by C@@ BS News / New York Times
&quot; on the two candidates , half of the support of the voters in the new survey , and others are losing dramatically . &quot;
Repub@@ lican voters support nationwide Tr@@ ump in large numbers . the support is growing up 23 % in the last C@@ BS Survey conducted in front of Fox News Deb@@ ate last month by 27 % in the survey on Tuesday .
but Car@@ son fell from 6 % to 23 % in the same period .
the survey also revealed that Car@@ son arrives well in demo@@ graphic groups and sur@@ passed Tr@@ ump under repub@@ lican elec@@ tors with university education .
&quot; the rest of the field , except for Car@@ ly Fior@@ ina and Ohio Gover@@ nor John Ka@@ sich , is defeated with Wis@@ cons@@ ins Gover@@ nor Scott Walker , who dropped by 10 % in the last month to now 2 % . &quot;
&quot; former Florida Gover@@ nor J@@ eb Bush , former governor of Ar@@ kan@@ s@@ as Mike Hu@@ ck@@ ab@@ ee and Florida Sen@@ ator Marco Ru@@ bio , are 6 % in third place . &quot;
the bug margin in the sample of 376 people from Repub@@ lican voters in this latest survey is plus or minus 6 % and was conducted in September .
&quot; the latest CN@@ N / OR@@ C survey , published last week , shows that Car@@ son increases in the surveys - he ends with 19 % support among the Repub@@ lic@@ ans , behind the Tr@@ ump with 32 % support . &quot;
the latest ABC News / Washington Post survey also showed Tr@@ ump well ahead of Car@@ son .
&quot; with a view of a Car@@ son rising in the last week , Tr@@ ump found some si@@ eves for the former neuro@@ surgeon , even after Car@@ son ap@@ ologi@@ zed to question Tr@@ umps Faith . &quot;
&quot; we need energy , &quot; said Tr@@ ump last Saturday during a campaign presentation in I@@ owa . &quot;
pleasant bathing temperatures : the eastern Mediterranean is currently up to 29 degrees warm .
&quot; even if peak values are measured only in the distance , there is already a trip to the Mediterranean for bathing holiday@@ makers to find even warm water . &quot;
a bath in the north or the Baltic Sea should be a rather short pleasure with a maximum of 17 degrees .
&quot; some people do not go to the sea : maximum 18 degrees has the water in the North and Baltic Sea during this week , the German Weather Service ( D@@ WD ) shares . &quot;
&quot; bathroom temperatures , however , continue to offer the Mediterranean : in the east it is even up to 29 degrees . &quot;
&quot; in the Adriatic , there are at the top 25 degrees , in France 23 degrees . &quot;
the Red Sea in Egypt comes to 28 degrees .
five members of the Brotherhood charged with the death of a Bar@@ uch College @-@ Ne@@ ul@@ ings
&quot; almost two years after a student died during a schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ic ritual in Po@@ con@@ o Mountains , Pennsylvania , murder charges against five people are submitted . &quot;
&quot; members of the New York Bar@@ uch College P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ P@@ si Brotherhood attacked Ch@@ un &quot; Michael &quot; Den@@ g brut@@ ally during an introduc@@ tory ritual in September 2013 and delayed his transport to the hospital , which contributed to his death , shared the police . &quot;
&quot; officials said that he had been loaded with a 30 @-@ po@@ und back@@ pack full of sand , and attacked repeatedly while he tried to go over a frozen field to a target . &quot;
&quot; Mr. Den@@ g finally compl@@ ained about head@@ aches , then he fell un@@ conscious . &quot;
&quot; the members of the P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ P@@ si @-@ Brotherhood did not call on the emergency number 911 , after Den@@ g became impot@@ ent and waited for an hour before they brought him to a hospital , so the police . &quot;
&quot; however , they had the time to change D@@ eng@@ s clothing , to goo@@ gling its symptoms and contact Andy Men@@ g , the national president of the Brotherhood to seek advice , said police chief Chris Wagner at a press conference . &quot;
&quot; at this point , the members , U@@ ten@@ si@@ lien , began to hide and set the well @-@ being of the Brotherhood in principle about Michael Den@@ g , &quot; said police chief Wagner . &quot;
&quot; he could not be revi@@ ved , and the next morning he died of his injuries . &quot;
&quot; after an aut@@ op@@ sy report , Den@@ g was repeated repeatedly with bl@@ unt power injury to head , tor@@ so and thi@@ ghs . &quot;
&quot; too many families were destroyed by the Brotherhood of the Brotherhood . at least one student dies at the chic@@ anes since 1970 , &quot; said Douglas F@@ ier@@ berg , a lawyer who represents D@@ eng@@ s &apos;s family in an explanation . &quot;
&quot; br@@ other@@ hoods and their members must be held accoun@@ table , and this step by authorities is very important . &quot;
a County Grand Jury of Mon@@ roe received an indictment because of Mor@@ der &apos;s third count for the first five members .
&quot; thirty @-@ two members of the Brotherhood , including Mr Men@@ g , are also accused of schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ic attacks and the formation of a criminal association . &quot;
&quot; we do not only want to take responsibility for the persons involved , but if there is an organization which - officially or un@@ officially - has sanc@@ tioned this , we will also be held accoun@@ table , &quot; &quot; said Wagner at a press conference on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; Bar@@ uch College was banned by the Brotherhood , and the national br@@ otherhood has rev@@ oked its affili@@ ation to the local group . &quot;
this will happen if the F@@ ed increases interest
&quot; a interest raise is coming , and the house will fall into bank@@ rupt@@ cy , returns for bonds will rise , and the economy will slide into recession . &quot;
we know this .
what we don &apos;t know is how long it will last and how long it will stop .
&quot; in particular , the history of the economy only provides a small guide to the process . &quot;
a recession came within just 11 months after the first interest rate increase and lasted 86 months .
&quot; the aggres@@ si@@ veness of the Federal Reserve when lifting interest rates is often , if not always , a factor in how the economy and the financial investments react . &quot;
&quot; hence , representatives of the US Central Bank have strongly emphasized that investors should not concentrate when it starts to increase interest rates , but rather to the period required for norm@@ alization . &quot;
&quot; in fact , several variables play a role . &quot;
&quot; at the end , market participants could find that the whole excitement was possibly exagger@@ ated because of a interest rate . &quot;
&quot; the first increase in F@@ ed since the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted as a signal for the end of the era of &quot; cheap money &quot; , &quot; said Julian Jes@@ so@@ p , chief econom@@ ist at Capital Economics , in a communication to customers . &quot;
&quot; in contrast , we do not expect the gradual return of US interest rates to normal heights , but still at too low level to lead to sei@@ s@@ mic shock that many seem to fear . &quot;
&quot; however , this does not mean that there will be no effect . &quot;
here is a look at historic trends based on how some areas of the economy could react :
&quot; as the market has seen last month , the anticip@@ ation of interest increases can be volati@@ le for a while . &quot;
&quot; once the up@@ li@@ ft@@ ment arrives , the influence is not so dramatic . &quot;
&quot; there is apparently a tendency that assets will be honored 12 to 24 months after the first increase , which may again reflect the delay in monetary policy , &quot; said Deutsche Bank Analy@@ sts in a recent study on what has happened after interest in the F@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; in particular , the market is mostly in the upward trend - about 14 percent - on the way to the interest rate , quite flat in the 250 days afterwards ( average profit of 2.6 percent ) , then back to normal state after 500 days , with an average return in the past six last cycles of 14.@@ 4 percent according to a current analysis , which was published by Bob Doll , Chief Operating Officer at Nu@@ ve@@ en Asset Management , at Bar@@ ron &apos;s . &quot;
the Deutsche Bank said that the impact on the shares tends to occur later in the increases cycle and returns to decrease returns .
rec@@ essions are a fact of economic life but they often promote interest income .
&quot; in the current case , the F@@ ed is confronted with some conditions that did not exist before and which could accelerate a recession . &quot;
&quot; it is particularly not@@ e@@ worthy , that the gross domestic product will be near its lowest point in the interest rate of the F@@ ed . &quot;

&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; interest increases in such a fragile economic background could be ris@@ ky and throw the question , &quot; &quot; whether this time is different , &quot; &quot; said Deutsche Bank . &quot;
&quot; market participants took the whole year on an interest rate of the F@@ ed , and all eyes were directed to the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee this week , which ends on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; while many strateg@@ ists and econom@@ ists believe that the FO@@ MC could appro@@ ve an increase in this session , fut@@ ures trading will only increase 25 percent . &quot;
&quot; in our study , all the growth cycles from 1950 to today have taken place in a super cycle with increasing fluctu@@ ation in GDP and pre @-@ rec@@ es@@ sion@@ al heights are placed very quickly after the start of recovery , &quot; says the report . &quot;
&quot; in contrast , this is a clearly slow recovery from what was the worst recession in the observed phase . &quot;
&quot; the current cycle is by far the longest that the F@@ ed has been waiting for since the end of the last recession ; the record was 35 months , and this has been 74 months . &quot;
&quot; fixed income was volati@@ le , as the market shares a interest rate , and the pattern is quite similar to the capital market . &quot;
the main difference is that the effect of bonds is faster than in equi@@ ties when they change their strategic course .
&quot; in bonds , the returns appear to change as soon as the first increase / decrease is carried out in the cycle . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the de@@ preci@@ ation cycle , the loans fall immediately , said Deutsche Bank . &quot;
&quot; the strateg@@ ists of Charles Schw@@ ab believe that the increase in interest rates will result in yields between longer and shorter bonds , and lead to a flat@@ ten@@ ing of the curve . &quot;
&quot; high @-@ interest bonds often bring better yields in such a climate , although &quot; we are still cau@@ tious to expect higher yields , &quot; said Kath@@ y Jones , Fi@@ xed @-@ In@@ come analy@@ st at Schw@@ ab , in an analysis . &quot;
Jones thinks that markets have already adapted to F@@ ed strategy expectations .
&quot; in addition to the strength of the dollar and the decline in inflation expectations , there are some indications that the market has adapted to the prospect of stric@@ ter monetary policy . &quot; &quot;
&quot; short @-@ term interest rates have increased , the earnings curve is flat@@ ter , bor@@ rowing have expanded and volati@@ lity has risen - all characteristics of the market , when the F@@ ed has ag@@ grav@@ ated its strategy . &quot;
&quot; in the large and whole , companies that handle the greater part of their business operations in the US will benefit when interest rates are rising and local products become more attractive . &quot;
multinational companies with high debts become worse because an increasing dollar is making their products more expensive on the global market and also financing their debts .
&quot; history shows that &quot; &quot; quality &quot; &quot; shares tend to respond very positively three months after an initial interest rate , &quot; &quot; said Gold@@ man Sach@@ s analysts in a report for the customers . &quot;
&quot; companies with a strong balance sheet have exceeded 5 percentage points after each of the interest income increases in 1994 , 1999 and 2004 . &quot;
companies with high capital yields and low volati@@ lity for their shares also exceeded their counter@@ parts with low quality by an average of 4 ( percentage points ) and 3 ( percentage points ) .
debt will be a big problem .
&quot; companies with a high proportion of flexible interest rates are most likely to lose , Gold@@ man said . &quot;
&quot; outside of pure stock games , consumers will also benefit from the growing dollar . &quot;
&quot; savings could see gains through higher yields , even if experts of varying opinions are how quickly this will take place . &quot;
&quot; BBC Radio 3 is a copy of the Classic FM , says member of Parliament Andrew Bin@@ gham &quot;
&quot; the Con@@ servative member of Parliament critici@@ zed the broad@@ c@@ aster for its &quot; &quot; stupid &quot; &quot; &quot;
he ar@@ gues that he is increasingly unable to distinguish from commercial ri@@ vals .
he also went to the BBC Music Awards and said that they im@@ it@@ ated The Br@@ its
&quot; Parliament @-@ colleague Dam@@ ien Col@@ lins grab@@ bed the voice of The Voice and said , that this was not very original . &quot;
&quot; BBC Radio 3 turns into &quot; &quot; Classic FM , &quot; &quot; claims a leading member of Parliament and raises new pressure on the transmitter to prove that he does something , what the private trav@@ eller does not do . &quot;
&quot; the Con@@ servative MP Andrew Bin@@ gham also said to the BBC bos@@ ses that the public @-@ legal radio station &quot; &quot; suspic@@ ious &quot; &quot; and increasingly no longer distingu@@ is@@ hable from its commercial competi@@ tor . &quot;
&quot; radio 3 seems - I don &apos;t like to use the word &quot; &quot; sil@@ ly &quot; &quot; - but it seems to turn to Classic FM , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; he also aimed at the BBC Music Awards , which started last December . &quot;
&quot; the BBC Music Awards , which started last year , seem to be just under another name . &quot;
&quot; so , if you try to do something else - these are two spontane@@ ously a@@ forem@@ en@@ tioned examples where you actually only im@@ itate what is already on the market , &quot; said Mr Bin@@ gham . &quot;
BBC General Director rejected alleg@@ ations and argued that BBC Radio 3 is far ahead of his commercial competi@@ tor when it comes to live music and educ@@ ating the public .
&quot; what I learn from Radio 3 , I &apos;m going to learn more about classical music anywhere else . &quot;
and there is a commitment to live music and playing music that is really un@@ matched .
&quot; and the commitment of Radio 3 to find new music and to give new works on order , I think really important , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of this year , BBC Radio 3 Controller Alan Dav@@ ey argued that he needed to work harder to engage the audience as it did in the past , because the British were less informed about classical music . &quot;
&quot; however , Radio 3 was not the only element of BBC production , which during the hearing in the Committee for the Selection of Culture , Media and Sport fell under fire to tre@@ ad commercial ri@@ vals to the feet . &quot;
&quot; the T@@ ory MP Dam@@ ien Col@@ lins interven@@ ed The Voice - the BBC &apos;s musical talent show , which was bought by the Dutch producer T@@ alp@@ a Media at an estimated cost of 22 million £ . &quot;
&quot; do you see why this program is often discussed , because it is not original and not particularly striking ? &quot;
Lord Hall insi@@ sted that the BBC 1 show - with Pal@@ oma Faith and Boy George was produced as a judge - &quot; in particular BBC way . &quot;
&quot; he added , he wishes that the company &quot; &quot; find a hit from our in @-@ house stable &quot; &quot; when the next time it is a series of entertainment . &quot;
&quot; however , he refused to exclu@@ de the order from other rows of The Voice in the future or to spend money in the fee pay@@ ers for other maintenance formats . &quot;
Internet sales increased in August at slow@@ est and the Black Friday can be responsible for this
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; last month , there was the lowest score since the beginning of the records in 2000 . &quot;
online sales increased three years ago by using mobile phones for shopping
experts believe that Black Friday has slow@@ ed down spending in November
&quot; for over a decade , the virtual shopping has been dom@@ ic@@ iled , and many of Britain &apos;s main shopping streets have turned into ghost towns . &quot;
&quot; experts say that there are signs now that online sales stagn@@ ate , after new numbers only showed seven percent in the first three months of 2015 . &quot;
the total expenditure for August presented the lowest rise in growth since the beginning of the record in 2000 with only five percent increase compared to the previous year .
&quot; experts say that there are signs that online sales stagn@@ ate , after new figures showed only seven percent growth in the first three months of 2015 &quot;
&quot; if you look at the growth rates for previous years and go back to 2000 , it has always been developed over time , &quot; said Andy Mul@@ c@@ ah@@ y , editor of the IM@@ RG sales index . &quot;
&quot; he explained that online sales increased three years ago , as buyers started making purchases with their mobile phones . &quot;
&quot; it meant that more people could buy online and that people could do it in different environments , e.g. at home on the sofa . &quot;
&quot; but now the one comm@@ utes , and we may experience that growth dimin@@ ishes . &quot;
&quot; the Black @-@ Friday @-@ Phen@@ om@@ enon , imported from America , is cited as a reason for the las@@ hing turno@@ vers . &quot;
&quot; experts believe that buyers will hold back their purchases before this event , which takes place last Friday in November . &quot;
&quot; last year , five times the average number of buyers turned around their computers to make their bar@@ gains , and some dealer websites crashed . &quot;
&quot; experts believe that Black Friday , in which the buyer comb@@ ats against bar@@ gains , could prevent buyers from making purchases . &quot;
a study by the British Retail Con@@ sortium finds out that £ 5 spending has been spent a little over £ 1 online .
&quot; for some products such as TV@@ s and washers , more than one third of purchases are now carried out via web shops . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , more than a quarter of people bu@@ ys clothes and shoes online instead of fashion chains in the inner cities . &quot;
Muslims buried in Mec@@ ca near the crane accident - B@@ in Laden &apos;s family is sanc@@ tioned
the dead bodies of 29 dead are carried by Muslims at the first fun@@ er@@ als in Mec@@ ca through the streets
Saudi Arabia finally puts the collapse of the huge Saudi B@@ in Laden group to the burden
the Ministry of Health also said that a total of 394 people were injured after the crane rus@@ hed
hundreds of Muslims gathered when 29 of the victims were carried through the streets to bury those who were killed when a crane in Mec@@ ca collap@@ sed .
&quot; the gri@@ eving crowded , largely dressed in white , the track to show their respect , when the first of the dead came up their last trip to the Al @-@ Renaissance cemetery . &quot;
&quot; the mour@@ ning proc@@ ession went over to the sacred site , where only days before a building crane rus@@ hed through the ceiling of the mos@@ que and then on the bed . &quot;
&quot; the cor@@ p@@ ses were released for fun@@ eral as the Saudi King over the construction company of the B@@ in Laden estate due to the disaster , which left the 394 injured , a san@@ ction . &quot;
the bodies of 29 people who were killed when a crane rus@@ hed through the Great Central Mus@@ h@@ ee Mec@@ ca were carried through the streets .
&quot; among the dead was Q@@ asi@@ m Ak@@ ram from Bol@@ ton , Greater Manchester , father of four children who was on his first pilgrimage , when the Cran@@ e fell down . &quot;
Mr Ak@@ ram was with his parents before the beginning of the annual H@@ add@@ sch in the Great Mos@@ que .
&quot; Saudi officials have already stated that the H@@ add@@ sch is going to Mec@@ ca with thousands , who will continue to come to the city . &quot;
&quot; today King Sal@@ man said , the B@@ in Laden group would not have stopped the arm of the crane when he was not used . &quot;
&quot; an Arab version of the decree , published by the State of Saudi Press Agency , said that the B@@ in Laden group was responsible for the collapse . &quot;
&quot; the English @-@ language service of the news agency did not report this detail , but said that the management of the company abroad had been banned . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of this week , Sal@@ man had to reveal what caused the fall of the Cran@@ e , who rus@@ hed into an inner courtyard of the Grand@@ mo@@ sch@@ ee , where hundreds of thousands of Muslims in front of the H@@ add@@ sch , which later takes place this month , gathered together . &quot;
&quot; the B@@ in Laden group did not have any statements on the breakdown of the crane , and their representatives were not available for an opinion . &quot;
the Royal decree also hon@@ ed the group because of not current security measures and because they did not cooperate with meteor@@ ologists .
dozens of cranes surround Mek@@ kas Groß@@ mo@@ sch@@ ee as part of the massive construction project led by the B@@ in Laden group .
the B@@ in Laden family has been associated with the sovereign family of Saudi Arabia for decades and takes over larger building projects .
&quot; the dec@@ eased Chief of Al Qaeda , Os@@ ama bin Laden , was a back@@ sliding son who was ex@@ propri@@ ated by the family in the 1990 @-@ s . &quot;
&quot; the crash of the crane came amid strong winds and rain , only a few days before arrival of millions in the kingdom of pilgrimage , which is required at least once in the life of any healthy Muslims . &quot;
officials said that 158 people remain in hospital .
&quot; government representatives ordered that 1 million Ri@@ al ( £ 17@@ 4,000 ) were to be paid to the members of the slain and the same amount of permanently last . &quot;
other wounded will receive half of this amount .

&quot; Britain increasingly employs arti@@ sans , says Ver@@ oni@@ que Lau@@ ry &quot;
the number of skilled tra@@ des@@ people from Eastern Europe showed a rise behind
&quot; this means that 200 further Scre@@ w@@ fix stores , which aim at tra@@ des@@ people , will be opened &quot;
&quot; at the same time , King@@ fis@@ her will close 60 B &amp; Q outlets nationwide . &quot;
&quot; by Ru@@ pert St@@ einer , City Chef @-@ Cor@@ respon@@ dent of the Daily Mail &quot;
&quot; it is said that Br@@ its put its h@@ amm@@ ers and brushes in favour of the use of qualified East European craftsmen , who carry out work in their home , &quot;
&quot; if you are sk@@ ill@@ ful with a hammer or a brush for painting walls , nowadays you seem to be a minority today . &quot;
&quot; the British employ increasingly arti@@ sans to conduct DIY jobs in their homes , so the boss of the company behind B &amp; Q . &quot;
&quot; V@@ é@@ ron@@ ique Lau@@ ry , a new managing director from King@@ fis@@ her who owns the DIY chain , said that a large increase in the number of skilled tra@@ des@@ men from Eastern Europe , offering services to low prices , is now over@@ hau@@ led . &quot;
&quot; King@@ fis@@ her plans to open 200 further Scre@@ w@@ fix shops , which are geared to professional tra@@ des@@ people and close to 60 selling points of B &amp; Q . &quot;
&quot; Mrs Lau@@ ry said she wants more women in B &amp; Q shops , because eight of ten purchasing decisions are made by women . &quot;
&quot; at the moment , men out@@ weigh the men . &quot;
&quot; she said it was necessary to face the growing demographic trends , which show more feminine single households that do more renov@@ ations than in the past . &quot;
Mrs Lau@@ ry said : &quot; it still works a majority of men in our branches .
we have to shift this towards a balance .
&quot; in principle , half of our customers consist of women with 80 percent of the decisions on buying articles by women . &quot;
women play a major role in the decision @-@ making process .
&quot; Mrs Lau@@ ry , who is one of only five women at the top of a UK in the FT@@ SE@@ 100 index , has also instruc@@ ted her top team to reflect the same number of men and women in leadership positions . &quot;
&quot; King@@ Fis@@ her is almost the only company that occupies exactly 50 percent of the team with women , including its management and financial officer . &quot;
Mrs Lau@@ ry said : &quot; this was a conscious decision - diversity here is an important topic .
it was not difficult to find good women for our supervisory board .
King@@ Fis@@ her reported a decline in half @-@ year profit and sales after the group deb@@ ated the cost of closing the shops .
&quot; because of the trend , King@@ fis@@ her , the Scre@@ w@@ fix and B &amp; Q , will open 200 new stores . &quot;
function@@ aries of A@@ ich / D@@ ob due to in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity in court
&quot; on Wednesday , on Wednesday two function@@ aries of the Austrian Vol@@ leyball @-@ vice @-@ champion A@@ ich / D@@ ob have to answer for in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity and expenditure . &quot;
the def@@ endants were not guilty .
one of them was also accused of abuse .
&quot; of this accus@@ ation , he has been vali@@ dly acqu@@ itted in May . &quot;
the current trial was ad@@ jour@@ ned .
&quot; according to the At@@ tor@@ ney General , Robert Ri@@ ffel had cryst@@ alli@@ zed himself in the preliminary investigation that the def@@ endants in the years 2006 to 2011 were the members of association accounts that were allowed to disp@@ ose of their functions for private purposes . &quot;
&quot; it costs around 400@@ ,000 Euro to damage the damage . &quot;
the sports officials are also charged with financial crimes .
&quot; this fact eliminated the Chairman of the Sch@@ öff@@ el@@ sen@@ ate , judge Micha@@ ela San@@ in . &quot;
it should be negoti@@ ated at a later date .
&quot; to the accus@@ ation of in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity , the defence argued that the association was at no point an asset . &quot;
&quot; sports officials could have compens@@ ated only expenses and the sports club for which they had invested between 1982 and 2011 , and in which they invested a lot of time and money , the pas@@ si@@ ties amounted to about 600@@ ,000 sch@@ illing ( approx . 44@@ .000 Euro ) . &quot;
&quot; at that time , we stood before the situation : do we continue or block the club ? &quot; &quot; one of the def@@ endants , in the bread profession , told large @-@ scale inspec@@ tor of the financial market . &quot;
&quot; with his colleagues and co @-@ def@@ endants , he decided to take over this task . &quot;
with all risks .
&quot; we have advanced money , put our life insurance as security at the bank , &quot; &quot; he said during the withdrawal . &quot;
&quot; the association has been agreed : you can manage the money freely , no debts must be made . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , in case of corresponding financial - success , the withdrawal of the reimbur@@ sement of the expenses had been decre@@ asing until 1991 . &quot;
&quot; therefore , one has paid a part of the expenses only years later , namely from the year 2003 , when a plus was paid to the account . &quot;
&quot; therefore , the former Ob@@ mann also seemed to explain the events . &quot;
&quot; accounts and savings accounts managed the two def@@ endants together , the second def@@ endant said . &quot;
&quot; why the pay@@ outs were not disclosed in detail to the association , the judge asked . &quot;
&quot; the association was not interested in detail for financial services , which was important only to the freedom of debt , so the answer . &quot;
&quot; as in 2011 , against which a functional investigation began for office abuse , an amount of 120@@ .000 Euro was transferred to the club account . &quot;
&quot; they were appropri@@ ations , declar@@ ing the def@@ endants . &quot;
&quot; this securities account ran on the name of the second def@@ endant , and according to its statement the association was not known . &quot;
&quot; why ? &quot; &quot; the judge wanted to know . &quot;
&quot; after that , the respon@@ dent did not know any answer for a long time . &quot;
&quot; then he finally thought , he believed that this was the best for the club . &quot;
&quot; if something had happened to him , no one would have known anything of this money , the prosec@@ utor put into the room . &quot;
&quot; the co @-@ accused had been informed , justified himself . &quot;
this transfer was formulated as &quot; damage compensation . &quot;
&quot; why in@@ dem@@ nity ? , judges and prosec@@ utor wanted to know . &quot;
&quot; the first def@@ endant explained that he did not agree with this wor@@ ding , because the association had never been damaged . &quot;
&quot; but what should I do if the lawyer says , &quot; &quot; With this you are all of the tailor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; am I a legal representative ? &quot; &quot; he asked . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , the function@@ ary , he never paid a cent salary , he calculated only mil@@ eage and di@@ eting . &quot;
&quot; he added 1,000 euros per month to di@@ ets , but the actual cost was much higher , he added . &quot;
the def@@ endants were not able to show exact documents for the early years .
&quot; these were no longer stored after an audit in which everything was judged correctly , they explained . &quot;
o@@ dom@@ eter was also referred to as the second def@@ endant .
&quot; all expe@@ ditions are in cash , and from his place of residence he had to go to the bank to Blei@@ burg from his place of residence , explaining in his statement . &quot;
the main hearing will be continued on 23 September with the inter@@ rog@@ ation of witnesses .
Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard supplies more 30.000 jobs
&quot; in addition to reducing personnel breakdown for three years , the computer giant will continue to work at the company &apos;s spl@@ itting up further jobs . &quot;
the positions at the US computer giant Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard ( HP ) do not end .
&quot; as part of its restructuring , the US technology group is planning to reduce the reduction of 25,000 to 30,000 positions in its corporate customer segment within the framework of its restructuring . &quot;
&quot; to save costs of 2.7 billion dollars ( 2.4 billion euros ) , the company distributed on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; the step will lead to a special load of around $ 2.7 billion , which will fall from the fourth quarter . &quot;
&quot; the reduction of 55@@ ,000 jobs has not yet been completed for three years . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the fiscal year 2013 / 14 , HP still employed around 30@@ 2,000 employees . &quot;

conflict : majority supports the anti @-@ IS training mission

&quot; on the other hand , 24 per cent are to interv@@ ene in the conflict . &quot;

behind the police a police line had been formed and a water @-@ laun@@ cher was ready .
&quot; 40 to 50 refugees began to throw stones , sticks and plastic bottles to the officials . &quot;
the officers were initially using pepper spray .
&quot; after that , the police used tear gas . &quot;
much tear gas was spra@@ yed in the direction of the refugees .
&quot; in this way , the group was dissolved . &quot;

time of decision on interest rates for the US emergency tank
&quot; the world ob@@ serves when the US emergency tank arrives two days , on Wednesday and Thursday , to make the most important decision whether the interest raised for the first time for almost a decade or not . &quot;
&quot; a survey among 80 econom@@ ists surv@@ ey@@ ed by Reuters found out that a little more than half , the last week of the view , was that the F@@ ed will continue to pers@@ ist and interest rates on the current state of 0 - 0.25 percent will keep . &quot;
&quot; it is a historical event , because it has been seven years since the F@@ ed interest paid to NU@@ LL . &quot;
&quot; for the first time , we approach a situation where a large central bank may leave the zero area and starts a process of norm@@ alisation of interest rates , &quot; said Angel U@@ bid , Head of Staff at the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot;
&quot; the US economy is on a relatively good level of performance , billions of dollars are added to the balance sheet and generate only a low inflation . &quot;
&quot; however , the F@@ ed cannot ignore the less crude outlook on global proportions . &quot;
&quot; it warned the markets to adjust to an increase , but the signs point out that the odds of such a step are good . &quot;
the decision is to be announced on Thursday at 8 : 00 CET on Thursday
&quot; death of Death at Delta State University left &quot; &quot; Deg@@ re@@ ation &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; after shooting and killing his girl@@ friend in Miss@@ issi@@ ppi on Monday morning - and before he later killed his colleague and killed , Sh@@ ann@@ on Lamb wrote a note to say that he was &quot; &quot; sorry &quot; &quot; at the first murder and wanted , &quot; &quot; he could not do it , &quot; &quot; gave authorities on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; police in Gau@@ tier , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , said that Lamb , lectur@@ er for ge@@ ography and social science education at Delta State University , called the emergency number at 10 : 00 on Monday morning &quot;
&quot; and he said , &quot; &quot; He has shot and killed someone . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Lamb said to the staff of the emergency centre that police had to send polic@@ emen to his home .
&quot; he said , &quot; &quot; I shot my wife yesterday evening &quot; &quot; and he also mentioned that a &quot; sweet dog &quot; was in the house but nobody will distur@@ b &quot; , &quot; but probably excited . &quot;
&quot; the police asked the call@@ ers for his name , but he did not abandon him . &quot;
Lamb has no explanation for his shots .
&quot; when police entered the scene , they found the body of Amy Pr@@ enti@@ ss , 41 , and a hand@@ written note from Lamb , 45 who said : &quot; I &apos;m sorry , I wanted , I could undo it . &quot;
&quot; I loved Amy , and she is the only woman who ever loved me . &quot;
&quot; after writing the note , Lamb 300 miles went to Delta State University where he killed E@@ than Schmidt , a professor of history , before he finally took his own life on Monday evening as polic@@ emen ring@@ ing him . &quot;
&quot; University President William LA@@ FOR@@ GE said he did not know anything about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs presentation . &quot;
&quot; despite reports on Monday that Lamb suppos@@ edly believed that Pr@@ enti@@ ss had a relationship with Schmidt , authorities said on Tuesday that there is &quot; no information , no evidence &quot; for a &quot; triangle &quot; relationship . &quot;
&quot; Pr@@ enti@@ ss was written by Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , who said she was married about seven years as a &quot; &quot; good man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the two were divor@@ ced 15 years ago , but remained friends . &quot;
&quot; O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said he and Pr@@ enti@@ ss had a daughter who is 19 , and she was &quot; &quot; destroyed by the ground . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he said that Pr@@ enti@@ ss was her daughter &quot; absolute best friends . &quot;
&quot; Pr@@ enti@@ ss worked online from home , according to L@@ ins@@ day Know@@ les , identified by Sun Her@@ ald as a close friend of Pr@@ enti@@ ss . &quot;
&quot; Know@@ les said that Pr@@ enti@@ ss , who had a dog named Light@@ ning , met with Lamb for about three years . &quot;
&quot; she always wanted to help other people , &quot; &quot; said Know@@ les &quot;
&quot; the police said , Lamb had relatives at a certain time on Monday to tell them , &quot; &quot; he did not go to prison . &quot;
&quot; as police officers arrested him on Highway 1 near Green@@ ville later in that night , Lamb drove his car to the side , ran into the forest and killed himself with a shot . &quot;
Lamb received a doc@@ torate in spring 2015 from the Delta State University as his life @-@ lau exists on the university &apos;s website .

Luke Sha@@ w of Manchester United can &apos;t play for months because of double fra@@ cture
Luke Sha@@ w suffered a double fra@@ cture of his right leg at the Champions League defeat of Manchester at PS@@ V Ein@@ dho@@ ven .
&quot; while this brought the left foreign minister to crying and closing it out for at least six months of playing , Louis van Ga@@ al will not give hope that Sha@@ w can play back in this season . &quot;
the injury was caused by a reck@@ less attack by H@@ é@@ ctor Mor@@ eno in the 15th minute after the 20 year old Sha@@ w had fallen into the PS@@ V area .
he was treated for nine minutes on the field and needed oxygen before he was taken to the hospital .
&quot; said van Ga@@ al : &quot; &quot; he has a double structure and is located in the hospital . &quot;
he will be reloc@@ ated tomorrow or perhaps a day later and then operates in Manchester .
&quot; it &apos;s aw@@ ful - a boy who comes with 18 to Manchester United , it has very hard and then plays fantastic , and then that happens . &quot;
in the changing cabin he had an oxygen mask .
he cried .
&quot; I am not a doctor , but if you have a double fra@@ cture , then it takes six months , and it will not play in the group phase . &quot;
I hope he can play this season again .
Mor@@ eno seemed happy to have escaped a Red Card and the suspension of an El@@ f@@ meter .
&quot; Nic@@ ola Ri@@ zz@@ oli , the refer@@ ee , did not pun@@ ish the Mexican . &quot;
van Ga@@ al assumed that the Italian refer@@ ee had mistaken .
you can judge for yourself if I say that an El@@ f meter and a red card were due .
it was a very bad attack with both legs .
&quot; a twe@@ et to Sha@@ ws account was saying , &quot; &quot; I thank you all for your messages . words cannot describe how broken I am , my way to recovery begins now , I get stronger again . &quot;
this is related : Manchester United suff@@ ers the loss of Luke Sha@@ w in defeat at PS@@ V
&quot; with the European champ@@ ionships in France , the England def@@ ender has an additional incentive to recover until the coming of June . &quot;
&quot; Phil@@ lip Co@@ c@@ u , the PS@@ V @-@ Trainer , said : &quot; it &apos;s a very bad injury . &quot;
&quot; when a player leaves the place with this kind of injury , all are very sad about it . &quot;
it is never the intention of our players to hurt a opponent .
Mor@@ eno suffered a break @-@ break when Mexico played against Van Ga@@ as Holland team at the 2014 World Cup .
&quot; he is very hard , because it was not his intention to hurt the opponent , and if you hear that it is a very bad injury , that &apos;s not good , &quot; said Co@@ c@@ u . &quot;
for me it was not possible to see the moment .
&quot; the only thing I could see was the ball moving in another direction , so it looked as if he had touched him &#91; Mor@@ eno &#93; , but I couldn &apos;t see the attack on Luke . &quot;
&quot; in conversation with S@@ BS@@ 6 Mor@@ eno said : &quot; I know how it feels , I know how hard it can be . &quot;
I feel very bad about it . I &apos;m so sorry .
the PS@@ V player Andr@@ és Gu@@ ard@@ ado was also brought to the hospital - after a f@@ oul@@ ding by Chris Sm@@ alling .
certainly David Cameron knows The Lor@@ ax better ?
&quot; it is one thing that all parents will soon learn : if your child loves a book , it will not take long before you know it almost . &quot;
unless you are David Cameron .
&quot; when he was asked by a provider of child care systems to call his favorite children &apos;s book , the premi@@ er of The Lor@@ ax , which was published in 1971 , decided by Dr. Se@@ uss . &quot;
&quot; it was a difficult choice , writes Cameron in a message on the website of the company Super@@ Camp@@ s , and continues : &quot; fun , moving , creative , and with a powerful message , it &apos;s a book that I like to read my children , because it always seems to have a picture or message we &apos;ve missed so far . &quot;
&quot; everything nice and good , except that the following paragraph , in which Cameron allegedly describes the plot of the book , instead depic@@ ting a content announ@@ cing the 2012 movie version , adding new characters and details to extend the rather short original text . &quot;
&quot; in the midst of the w@@ alled city of Th@@ under @-@ Ville , where all nature has gone and even the air is a commodity , a boy named Ted , the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , meets the girl of his dreams by fulfilling her desire to see a real tree , he reads . a love interest was Dr. Se@@ uss whose real name Theodor Se@@ uss Gei@@ sel died and died in 1991 but completely unknown . &quot;
&quot; as if that would not be suspic@@ ious enough : the text presented by Cameron is partly reading like the summary of the Lor@@ ax movie , which is presented on the website of Internet Movie Database and so begins : &quot; in the w@@ alled city of Th@@ under @-@ Ville , where everything is artificial and even the air is a commodity , a boy named Ted hopes to win the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , the girl of his dreams . &quot;
&quot; although he ad@@ mits to be a pra@@ g@@ matic father , it seems unlikely that Cameron is so little familiar to the plot of the book . here , an un@@ named boy , like the local environment by the money @-@ gre@@ edy , trees f@@ lung , Th@@ ought stri@@ ck@@ ling Once @-@ ler , in spite of the protests of the name @-@ giving Lor@@ ax , a ho@@ ck@@ ling , car@@ eless being , &quot; &quot; which speaks in the name of the trees , &quot; &quot; is devast@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; most likely , such a relatively low PR task was deleg@@ ated to a hel@@ per who did not read The Lor@@ ax for 20 times in a row . &quot;
a Dow@@ ning Street spokes@@ man said that the text had probably come from Cameron &apos;s Elec@@ toral Plan .
&quot; Super@@ Camp@@ s confirmed that the text was delivered by Cameron &apos;s staff , but gave no immediate comments . &quot;
&quot; Adam Ly@@ th was clearly threatened with the exclusion from England &apos;s team , but it is still difficult . &quot;
&quot; to meet Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task , but when you see the Ka@@ der who chose England for the tour , a re@@ petition of the 3 @-@ 0 test series defeat is not on my card . &quot;
I would not exclu@@ de a forward victory .
&quot; the A@@ last@@ air C@@ ooks page may be less experienced than those three years ago , but there are good spin @-@ players in the bat@@ ting setup , and the community spirit is strong ; they will not bear any sc@@ ars of 2012 just a y@@ outh@@ ful positive attitude . &quot;
&quot; with the ball , Mo@@ ea Ali develops as Spin @-@ Bow@@ ler and Adi@@ l Ras@@ hid , even if it represents an unknown size at test level , is an option for the attack . &quot;
related news : Adam Ly@@ th ex@@ cre@@ ases from the England test cad@@ re and is replaced by Alex H@@ ales .
&quot; the decision to release Adam Ly@@ th , of course , is hard to analyze for me as his head coach in Yor@@ k@@ shire . &quot;
&quot; with its seven tests , there were two good attacks under difficult conditions , and the simple but hard reality is that cri@@ cket players are aimed at results . &quot;
&quot; there was no question mark at Joe R@@ oot , for example , and that led to the nom@@ ination , there - and I said this before - players are their own best performers . &quot;
&quot; a long time ago , one would have extended the run of Ly@@ th , but he had control of his own fate . &quot;
&quot; if he hopefully turns out more runs for Yor@@ k@@ shire , another chance comes . &quot;
&quot; the England @-@ Trainer Tre@@ vor Bay@@ lis@@ s praised his post@@ ure , even if he did not deliver such good performances , and that doesn &apos;t surprise me ; he is above all a team man . &quot;
&quot; the question , how much time a test man receives , to set his mark is difficult . &quot;
&quot; Ly@@ th got seven chances - like Sam Rob@@ son in front of him , while Nick Comp@@ ton got nine . &quot;
only comp@@ ton got the chance to play home and out .
&quot; the only accus@@ ation that could be raised was that England first sat down Jonathan Des@@ p@@ ite in the Caribbean - when Ly@@ th was in top shape , but this lost chance is now in the past . &quot;
&quot; Alex H@@ ales comes in , and he is a stroke man , whom I set high . &quot;
&quot; he is an X @-@ factor cri@@ cket player , what we saw at Yor@@ k@@ shire early this season when he scored 236 against us on a Tr@@ ent Bridge Square , which met us very much . &quot;
&quot; he must have at least the same chances as those before him , but this depends naturally on the position of the team in the United Arab Emirates . &quot;
&quot; the idea to make mos@@ ques alongside Cook , which would give an extra spin @-@ punch and get four qu@@ icks , appeared , and I have nothing against it . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t see why a hit man can &apos;t beat there , and this left @-@ h@@ ander has already shown that he is a Teu@@ fel@@ sk@@ er@@ l of Cri@@ cket players . &quot;
&quot; mos@@ ques may not have done his job for his County Wor@@ c@@ ester@@ shire , but he is a number 3 for them , and there is no big difference . &quot;
&quot; my former team mate Jus@@ tin Lan@@ ger played his first 38 tests at the first drop , before he appeared as op@@ ener in 2001 . &quot;
he has made three hundred steps away and did not look back .
&quot; Z@@ af@@ ar Ans@@ ari comes to the cad@@ res as a back @-@ up sp@@ inner , and in my limited dealing with him he has impressed me as a young man . &quot;
&quot; people may see his statistics on average 31 with the bat and 35 with the ball - and think it &apos;s a pun@@ t , but there is no large number of backup sp@@ inning who raise their hands and the trainers have chosen for youth . &quot;
he will learn a lot on this tour .
&quot; apart from the team , England has made a few clever additions to the trainer . &quot;
&quot; the appointment of Mah@@ ela Jay@@ awar@@ dene , the B@@ ats@@ man from Sri Lanka , as a consultant for the test games could be a coup . &quot;
&quot; he is one of the nic@@ est guys in the game , who will bring a wealth of experiences as it has played in all conditions and against all the attacks . &quot;
Paul Coll@@ ing@@ wood comes for the white ball @-@ phase of the tour and brings energy and a powerful application into the setup .
&quot; I always felt that he was created for the international cri@@ cket competition , as a player or as coach , and like Mah@@ ela he has insight from which we can benefit . &quot;
&quot; sometimes new voices can bring fresh air in the changing cabin , even if the messages are in line with the previously said . &quot;
&quot; Coll@@ ys te@@ amm@@ ate at Dur@@ ham , Ben St@@ okes , is not used for the One @-@ Day@@ ers , R@@ oot got a similar break against Australia and I have no problem with it for my part . &quot;
&quot; some will not agree , but coaches and team @-@ makers do not determine the schedule . &quot;
and you must remember that as with the players their jobs depend on the results .
such decisions are not made easy in heart .
&quot; the Bre@@ x@@ it camp ( Bre@@ x@@ it = exit from Britain from the EU ) could gain access to Zul@@ u , if the economy gets into a trap by 2017 &quot;
&quot; David Cameron &apos;s un@@ elabor@@ ated re @-@ action strategy to keep Britain in the EU will get deeper into trouble every day , even without the election of brilliant Jerem@@ y &quot; &quot; Is it yes or no ? &quot; &quot; Cor@@ by@@ n as leader of Labour or the TU@@ C who fought hard for Europe on Tuesday . &quot;
foreigners also have their Cor@@ by@@ ns and Ni@@ gel Far@@ ages .
&quot; a European diplom@@ at friend said recently that some member states , so deeply ent@@ angled in various crises , as the EU is now and not always on its own fault , Britain &apos;s self @-@ created agenda with split conc@@ essions and distur@@ bing treaty changes that they usually do not want . &quot;
&quot; in Bri@@ gh@@ ton , the TU@@ C decided at its annual meeting , that it does not like it if it end@@ anger the social protection . &quot;
we could also call it Dave and Georges Sel@@ f@@ ie agenda .
&quot; prime minister and finance minister climb on summit meetings or bilateral meetings in foreign capitals , make a photo of themselves in front of a famous local monument , with or without local sizes , come home and say that they win allies for reforms . &quot;
it &apos;s always about me .
&quot; my European friend , who wants a Great Britain outside the EU tent - &quot; Let &apos;s not alone with France , &quot; says Berlin - and lets see that more and more short @-@ si@@ ghted ministers and officials have come to the point where it doesn &apos;t matter whether we stay or go . &quot;
&quot; Germany &apos;s cau@@ tious Chancellor Angela Merkel is an ally , but she has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave the office before it is bad for her , as with the exagger@@ ated long endurance as Th@@ at@@ cher ( 11 years ) , Mit@@ terr@@ and ( 14 ) and K@@ ohl ( 16 ) . &quot;
France &apos;s François Hollande can look at his re @-@ election or his replacement in 2017 .
he is also a f@@ ading force .
&quot; Poland soon has a nation@@ alist right government , Spain a left wing . &quot;
&quot; it is hard to imagine that they will tear a leg to help the Sel@@ f@@ ie British , whose energy should be used to prevent Scotland &apos;s exit from the UK - something they don &apos;t want , because most similar separ@@ ati@@ st tendencies have . &quot;
&quot; therefore , some such ministers may even plan un@@ inten@@ tionally un@@ released comments , entirely in SN@@ P style , while Britain &apos;s referendum campaign in 2017 to speed up the Bre@@ x@@ it process , my friend presum@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation was a bank@@ rupt@@ cy , &quot; &quot; Great Britain has won nothing of the new tre@@ ati@@ se . &quot;
&quot; Europeans know how pre@@ dat@@ ory the Fle@@ et Street can be at their cost , and which EU scep@@ tics are the oli@@ gar@@ chy of the press room , as they were not inspired by Tony Ben@@ n in 1975 , which supported our entry in 1973 with a ratio of 2 : 1 . &quot;
&quot; they can be weak to remember Boris Johnson , the Er@@ z @-@ Euro opportun@@ ist , who has made himself a name as an &quot; EU straight ban@@ anas &quot; Brussels correspon@@ dent in the early 90 &apos;s . &quot;
&quot; in all his ins@@ anity , Ed Mili@@ band knew who were his enemies . &quot;
&quot; this included the Med@@ ley of tax @-@ fear@@ ing vil@@ la@@ ins , telephone @-@ h@@ ack@@ ers aliens and the pseu@@ do non @-@ foreigners who own most of our large newspapers . &quot;
&quot; actually Tony Bla@@ ir thought similar about her , but noticed that when sitting with a hot gor@@ illa in a cage , one better spread ban@@ anas to distrac@@ t him instead of getting to his lunch and dinner . &quot;
&quot; in fact , Mili@@ band used more Bla@@ ir as Bla@@ ir himself when he opposed Cameron &apos;s refer@@ end@@ ums because Bla@@ ir had rejected the principle of the non @-@ adopted constitution of the EU , which was then rejected by French and Dutch voters in 2005 , which opened him a back@@ door . &quot;
the press has never for@@ given him .
&quot; but the nice Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n who gave me a friendly fla@@ p on Monday in Westminster - I told him that he didn &apos;t have time to waste me - seems in danger of repe@@ ating N@@ eil Kin@@ no@@ cks Boy@@ cot@@ t Mur@@ doch strategy of the 80 &apos;s , a mistake back then and today . &quot;
&quot; it can take but he must develop a coher@@ ent strategy to win the media , not with me , but certainly with Andrew Mar@@ r , whose BBC sofa he left on Sunday . &quot;
Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s official position in Europe is - I always express it - in the development .
he says that we should remain in a re@@ formed EU .
&quot; well , most people outside of U@@ ki@@ ps of traditional bl@@ auf@@ ar@@ b@@ stoff trends and the wild fav@@ es of Tor@@ ys Klein @-@ Eng@@ land@@ ism can certainly say yes . &quot;
&quot; it is what Hil@@ ary &quot; &quot; A Ben@@ n , but not Benn@@ ite &quot; &quot; on the radio and on TV this week said when the boy@@ sc@@ outs fought in him , not admit that Cor@@ by@@ ns was a bad idea as a shadow Chancellor . &quot;
&quot; it reminded me of the 70 &apos;s , when his old father tried to be il@@ loyal to his Labour Cab@@ inet colleagues without going too far and losing his cabinet job . &quot;
Hil@@ ary &apos;s fight was even more attractive .
&quot; but to fight to remain &quot; &quot; under all circumstances &quot; &quot; - Benn@@ ett &apos;s expression - was not what Mc@@ Donn@@ ell told what J@@ C told his comrades and de@@ pu@@ ties after all reports on their annual meeting on Monday evening . &quot;
&quot; whatever the stir@@ ring bottom @-@ up image of Cor@@ by@@ n wants to convey - remember that he even touched me - News discipline remains important in the age of TV around the clock and above all things in the whir@@ lpool of the social media , a breeding ground of par@@ ano@@ ia and betra@@ yal . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s right to give Cameron a free ticket for Europe which allows him to keep Lab@@ ours support in the referendum campaign for granted , as Mc@@ Donn@@ ell said . &quot;
Simon J@@ enk@@ ins thinks for sure .
&quot; but Mc@@ Donn@@ ell and Cor@@ by@@ ns fundamental ambig@@ u@@ ities concerning EU membership - in accordance with their Benn@@ ite siege economy , their anti @-@ capitalist past - is no longer just a question of es@@ ot@@ eric discussion among left dissi@@ dents , for which the nar@@ c@@ iss@@ ism of little difference is a central principle of dog@@ matic disputes . &quot;
&quot; as with his ambig@@ u@@ ities to N@@ ato - Tom Wat@@ son insi@@ sts that J@@ C does not start a campaign to exit - foreign diplom@@ ats will be required to try , in particular , to find a sense of their superi@@ ors at home . &quot;
why should Paris or Berlin waste political capital - they also have suspic@@ ious voters - to make conc@@ essions to the British if all this can be meaning@@ less ?
&quot; the US is already quite disappointed with the weak military performance in Iraq , Libya and Syria , even with a lowering of the T@@ ory government in power , which I was reminded of when starting on Monday of something that was called British Influ@@ ence Security Forum . &quot;
experts critici@@ ze report from Public Health England on e @-@ cigar@@ ettes
&quot; claims of a state @-@ funded agency that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are less harmful than smoking was created from a meeting of 12 people , partly with connections to tobacco industry , said researchers . &quot;
experts who write in the British Medical Journal ( BM@@ J ) joined the Lanc@@ et by critici@@ zing the evidence used by Public Health England ( P@@ he ) in her report on e @-@ cigar@@ ettes .
he published the &quot; Basic Report &quot; last month and describes it as a &quot; comprehensive review of evidence . &quot;
&quot; however , some researchers have questioned the resili@@ ence of data and pointed to the connections between some experts and the tobacco industry . &quot;
&quot; a editorial in the medical journal Lanc@@ et last month held the &quot; &quot; extra@@ ordin@@ arily win@@ dy basis &quot; , &quot; on which P@@ he founded his most important conclusion . &quot;
two more researchers write in BM@@ J and asked whether to build the claims &quot; on stone or sand .
&quot; Martin Mc@@ K@@ ee , Professor of European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Trop@@ ical Medicine and Simon Cap@@ e@@ well , professor of Clinical Epidemiology at the University of Liverpool , said : &quot; a basic principle of public health is that strategies should be based on evidence of effectiveness . &quot;
&quot; they said that the public anticip@@ ates that &quot; &quot; the current best estimate is that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are about 95 % less harmful than smoking &quot; &quot; on a detailed review of evidence and modelling . &quot;
&quot; in fact , this statement comes from a single session of 12 people who were conven@@ ed to develop a model for multi @-@ C@@ rit@@ eria Decision Analysis - MC@@ DA ) to lead their opinions on the damages of various ni@@ cot@@ ine @-@ containing products to a synthesis ; the results of the meeting were summar@@ ized in a research report . &quot;
&quot; Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that a sponsor of the meeting was a company called Euro@@ Swiss Health , whose managing director was previously received by British American Tob@@ acco Fund ( BA@@ T ) for an independent study . &quot;
&quot; he also signed the references of BA@@ T for Public Health in a sustainability report , they said . &quot;
&quot; one of the 12 participants at the meeting explained to receive funds from an e @-@ cigar@@ ette manufacturer , but not the financing that he should have received after reports from tobacco company Philip Morris International , added them . &quot;
&quot; the reasons for choosing the members of the committee are not delivered , but these include several well @-@ known e @-@ cigar@@ ettes , some of which include a sector financing in the paper . &quot;
some other participants at this meeting are not known for their know @-@ how in tobacco control .
&quot; at the meeting , the Tob@@ acco management of P@@ he took part . &quot;
&quot; the Group &apos;s research work indicates that there is a lack of &quot; hard evidence for the damage of most products in most criteria , &quot; Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well wrote . &quot;
&quot; however , none of these links or restrictions will be discussed in the P@@ he report . &quot;
&quot; Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that &quot; &quot; there have been no evidence that &quot; &quot; there have been no evidence that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes serve as a way to smoke for children or non @-@ smo@@ kers &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Kevin F@@ ent@@ on , Director of Health and Well @-@ being at P@@ he said that the claims of BM@@ J had already been re@@ acted earlier . &quot;
he said : &quot; e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are much less harmful than smoking . &quot;
every second life @-@ long smo@@ ker dies at his ad@@ diction .
&quot; all evidence suggests that the health risks of e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are low compared to that , but that we continue to study long @-@ term effects . &quot;
&quot; he has the clear duty to inform the public about what the evidence proves and what is not , especially if there is so much public confusion over the relative dangers in comparison to tobacco . &quot;
&quot; nearly 8@@ 0,000 people annually die in a disease related to smoking , and smoking costs the National Health System from two billion pounds per year . &quot;
&quot; due to the clear preparation of current evidence that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are not without risk , but only a fraction of the damage caused by smoking , we fulfill our national jurisdiction . &quot;
BBC should give up East@@ enders says former boss of Channel 4
&quot; the former Chairman of Channel 4 , Luke Johnson said that the BBC should stop sending programs such as East@@ enders and The Voice . he said that commercial ri@@ vals would &quot; give their right arm &quot; for hit shows like Albert Square So@@ ap . &quot;
Johnson said that the broadcasting fee should be used only to make the type of programs that are not sent by other UK channels .
&quot; he critici@@ zed the BBC for placing publicly @-@ legal programs , which are likely to be seen by a smaller audience , in hard controversial time frame against the most popular shows of their ri@@ vals and broad@@ cast@@ ers like BB@@ C4 . &quot;
&quot; after the BBC General Director Tony Hall said that the company wanted to do more in partnership with other organizations , Johnson said he had tried to get in contact with the BBC for six years in his time at Channel 4 . &quot;
&quot; I have problems with the idea that BBC programs are commissioned or sent , which would also be clearly shown by non @-@ subsidi@@ zed ri@@ vals , &quot; said Johnson to the Ober@@ haus communications committee as part of his investigation on the future of BBC . &quot;
&quot; if you want to keep the broadcasting fee , what I don &apos;t think about mid@@ - or long @-@ term not for a good idea , you should at least give its production to programs that others do not do or order . &quot;
they send The Voice in a first @-@ class time window because they want to achieve the wid@@ est possible support for their future .
&quot; the idea that nobody else would show this is a joke , it &apos;s ridi@@ culous , it &apos;s non@@ sense . &quot;
&quot; Johnson said : &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t see why a reg@@ res@@ sive tax is financed , which could also be financed without subsidies . &quot;
&quot; the Voice is such a program , East@@ enders is another , ad@@ mitt@@ edly both self @-@ productions . &quot;
&quot; hon@@ estly , other channels would give their right arm for it . &quot;
&quot; I would like to see myself , how this public @-@ legal television should be . &quot;
I don &apos;t think this would reduce the BBC at all .
&quot; Johnson , an entrepren@@ eur for series that led Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010 , said the BBC is to blame for reviews &quot; because of the ambition of the people who work there , and because they believe that this is the best way to secure long @-@ term support . &quot;
&quot; his comments on the most popular shows of the BBC show what the former head of Sky , Tony Ball , in his Mac@@ K@@ Tag@@ gart presentation in Edinburgh in 2003 suggested that the BBC should sell shows like East@@ enders . &quot;
&quot; Johnson said that the rather public @-@ legal N@@ ic programs should go to BB@@ C4 where one can &apos;t measure the audience , but they can argue , if they go to their apparent missions for justi@@ fication of 4 billion £ broadcasting fees , &quot; &quot; Well , of course , we have created all these obsc@@ ure programs that no one has seen . &quot;
they put them into a time frame in which no one ever wanted to see them .
Johnson said to the committee : &quot; I urge you to find a rather reg@@ res@@ sive system in terms of conditions that can get the best value from this .
&quot; of course , you all think we all think that you get a great value for $ 150 per year , but for people who are a lot of money for the 150 £ a lot , wonder if this is true because they consume not much of the BBC . &quot;
&quot; the former Sky@@ - and Channel 5 boss David El@@ stein , who also said before the Committee on Tuesday , demanded that the BBC should check its Rei@@ th@@ ian mission , &quot; to inform , to form and to enter@@ tain . &quot;
&quot; he said , little of the BBC &apos;s production would now officially be classified as education - he said that it was 1 % of their TV production and 0.1 % on the radio - and they should take an example on the public broad@@ cast@@ ers in Australia and Canada . &quot;
&quot; the question of partnerships said El@@ stein , the BBC should do more in areas like those of the Pro@@ ms , of which he said that only a handful of television are shown , and with the commercial broad@@ cast@@ ers enter alli@@ ances to make everything available online . &quot;
&apos;@@ Son@@ o@@ gene@@ tics &apos; can control brain cells by sound waves
the video shows how the nem@@ ato@@ des change the direction in which they are radi@@ ated with sound impulses .
scientists have bred wor@@ ms with gene@@ tically modified nervous systems that can be controlled by break@@ through@@ s of sound waves .
&quot; the tiny nem@@ ato@@ des change the direction in the moment when they have sound impulses , which have too high frequencies for the human ear to be heard , be@@ amed . &quot;
the impulses work by switching from Mot@@ on@@ eur@@ one cells that are gene@@ tically modified to carry the membrane channels that respond to ultr@@ asonic waves .
more about this topic : reading researchers and writing brain activity with light
&quot; researchers said that wor@@ ms showed the power of a new method called Son@@ o@@ gene@@ tics where ultras@@ ound can be used to activate a range of brain , heart , and muscle cells outside the body . &quot;
&quot; Sre@@ ek@@ an@@ th Chal@@ as@@ ani , researcher at the Sal@@ k Institute in La J@@ olla , California , told the Guardian that the procedure of one day could replace the depths of brain stimulation , a invasive procedure that gives electric impulses to the brain of people to treat the symptoms of Parkinson &apos;s disease . &quot;
&quot; thread wor@@ ms usually do not react to ultras@@ ound , but Chal@@ as@@ ani noted that they did it when they were surrounded by a liquid with micro@@ sc@@ opic bub@@ bles . &quot;
&quot; the bub@@ bles , he found out , rein@@ force the ultr@@ asonic waves , which penet@@ rate into the wor@@ ms . &quot;
the reinforced ultr@@ asonic waves act on structures called TR@@ P @-@ 4 ion@@ ary channels and found in the membran@@ es of some of the worm cells .
&quot; the sound waves cause the opening of these ion channels and activate the cells they are assigned , such as a report of Nature Communications . &quot;
&quot; to create ultras@@ ound @-@ controlled nem@@ ato@@ des , Chal@@ as@@ ani gene@@ tically modified the wor@@ ms that some of their Mot@@ on@@ eur@@ ons carry TR@@ P @-@ 4 ion channels . &quot;
&quot; when ultras@@ ound is applied to the changed creatures , the sound waves are ampli@@ fied by the micro@@ b@@ lows and transferred to the wor@@ ms , where they turn on the modified Mot@@ on@@ eur@@ ons . &quot;
&quot; the procedure has some simil@@ arities with Op@@ to@@ gene@@ tics , a ground@@ breaking tool that enables scientists to switch and switch neur@@ ons with impulses of light . &quot;
but Chal@@ as@@ ani said that Son@@ o@@ gene@@ tics could have some advantages over this technique .
&quot; in contrast to light , which must be sent down to the desired position in the brain at a optical fiber , low frequency ultr@@ asonic waves can happen un@@ hin@@ dered and can thus be sent to the brain from the top of the skull . &quot;
&quot; we believe that with gene therapy and a therapeutic virus it is possible to temporarily make the targeted human neur@@ ons temporarily vulnerable to the ultras@@ ound signal in a clinical setting for certain neurolog@@ ical treatments , &quot; &quot; said Chal@@ as@@ ani . &quot;
&quot; other applications could focus on muscle cells and insulin @-@ producing cells , he added . &quot;

&quot; but a separate campaign also leads to many posters , which are to be seen at bus stations and subway trains and which require a second view . &quot;

Matt L@@ ever was amazed at the silence that reigned around the advertising for the arms trade fair - and thought : &quot; let &apos;s give them the campaign they try to avoid .
&quot; they played with the invention of a more realistic commercial advertising , but &quot; by the ring of bright colours and animation , it remains stronger . &quot;
&quot; they did a fantastic job by helping us raise awareness of the sale of illegal torture devices at the fair , &quot; &quot; says Tom Davi@@ es of Am@@ nesty . &quot;
what we need now is a step in the British government and the guarantee that torture devices cannot be tra@@ ded illeg@@ ally from our door@@ step .
&quot; perhaps the creative art around the Waffen@@ trade fair comes from the area within Ex@@ Ce@@ L , where exhibitors are fantas@@ tically eu@@ ph@@ em@@ istic products . &quot;

eight golden rules for living in student residen@@ ces
&quot; eleven years ago , I was a self @-@ for@@ get@@ table 19 @-@ year @-@ old in a student residence , still in faith in Ber@@ ets and mor@@ ally rel@@ ati@@ vis@@ m , but only now I remember the ten@@ se smile of those whom I have up@@ set - and to the numerous , leng@@ thy complaints about others . &quot;
most I &apos;ve learned can be distill@@ ed in eight simple rules .
the entry into student residence halls ranges from slightly nerve @-@ sp@@ elling to absolutely horri@@ fying .
&quot; it is temp@@ ting to tie : people tell where you come from where and where you took the Sabbath year , where you stand with regard to Cor@@ by@@ n and why you &quot; frank@@ ly Mar@@ m@@ ite do not love or hate , because in Ernst , guys , it &apos;s just a yeast extract ha@@ ha@@ ha , I &apos;m in my room . &quot;
breathe through .
and help others to do the same - ask questions and show interest .
&quot; it distrac@@ ts the conversation and helps you to find out the people you like contrary to those with whom you would not speak , even if your lashes fell on fire and these fire extingu@@ ish@@ ers would be . &quot;
let people .
&quot; people often turn into drinks reception , film night venues and communal meeting points , but they are also places where people are dressed and their under@@ wear . &quot;
referring to this : do not remember to start the university with a relationship
intro@@ vert will receive a rough treatment at the university .
&quot; their room should be a refuge , but many student residen@@ ces form a space @-@ to @-@ room @-@ bum@@ ble culture that is friendly and socially and can lead to life @-@ long friendship . &quot;
this can be hell for someone who is trying to recover .
&quot; nothing in culture allows you to say , &quot; &quot; I like you and I want our friendship to go on , but you have to go away so that I can get back the energy I used for interaction with you . &quot;
try to feel when a milit@@ ant of convi@@ vi@@ ality is exhausted - and send it an SMS instead of kno@@ cking .
apro@@ pos tap : do it .
a guy in my student residence had the idea that an un@@ locked door was an invitation .
he saw a few things .
close friendship by baking .
&quot; as you start the university at the peak of the back @-@ man@@ ia , the kno@@ ck at the doors of people to present yourself with a plate full of brow@@ ni@@ es , less strange than the welcome of the 1950 @-@ year &quot; welcome in the neighborhood , I have something baked . so , and now please smile when I ask you some personal questions . &quot;
offering homemade treats is a good way to close friend@@ ships .
your room@@ mates feel obliged to enter@@ tain themselves and will eventually associate your face with a delicious surprise .
&quot; of course , this depends on whether you are an ongoing b@@ aker . &quot;
&quot; poor@@ ly mixed cl@@ umps of flour , sugar and fat lead to people sleeping when you drop . &quot;
ste@@ aling food is a common crime in student residence .
&quot; of course , the cla@@ ws of chick@@ ens is a theft , but is it taking a drop of milk for your tea also ? &quot;
check this with the milk owner .
&quot; chances are good that they say to use themselves , even if they cook in the interior . &quot;
&quot; if someone ste@@ als your stuff , it is anno@@ ying , and you have my compassion - but try to deal more balanced than my ro@@ ommate who added a dish@@ washing agent to her milk to pun@@ ish thi@@ eves . &quot;
she is now in prison .
they should not make noise that keeps people from sleep or from work .
&quot; it is not just about being a decent person , but that you belong to the people who sit in the glass house in the tru@@ est sense of the pro@@ verb . &quot;
&quot; a girl on my cor@@ ridor asked her neighbours if it makes them a bit more quiet , because it was three o &apos;clock in the morning and she had a test in the morning . &quot;
they responded with even more lu@@ ke@@ warm music .
&quot; when she finally stopped at 5 o &apos;clock , she kindly allowed her neighbours to sleep two hours before she dropped her own music , shut down her door and went to her three @-@ hour test . &quot;
wouldn &apos;t it be romantic if your future spouse would random@@ ly move into the same student residence ?
&quot; on the other hand , it wouldn &apos;t be too deep embarrass@@ ing if you hold a ro@@ ommate for your future sp@@ ouses , get rid of them , dis@@ connect and see them every day and maybe experience how to move all their friends together ? &quot;
&quot; of course , the heart walks its own ways - but if a hot ro@@ ommate is definitely not your future sp@@ ouses , try at least to talk to your abdom@@ en a little reason . &quot;
&quot; in the exciting moment you notice that someone has his keys in his un@@ locked room , the boundary between an Ul@@ k and mo@@ b@@ bing is fine than it seems . &quot;
&quot; a good stick is fun , but it only takes moments until it becomes a bo@@ omer@@ ang . &quot;
&quot; through hiding a precious and am@@ using lesson over safety , but never disc@@ ern someone &apos;s room with to@@ oth@@ paste and sh@@ ampoo . &quot;
&quot; close your door , and place your keys in a glass of water which you put into the freezer - but do not t@@ ack their pos@@ sessions on the ceiling more than twice . &quot;
&quot; ter@@ raced houses for refugees , single @-@ educ@@ ators , &quot;
the real estate entrepren@@ eur Markus Gil@@ dner is building ter@@ raced houses for people who do not have much money .
&quot; so for refugees - but also as a signal : &quot; &quot; not only refugees need living room , but also the only educ@@ ative mother and the poor . &quot;
&quot; I am showing how to build and build well today , &quot; says the 44 @-@ year @-@ old in the interview &quot;
thousands of refugees will push for the housing market .
entrepren@@ eur Markus Gil@@ dner believes to know how quickly cheaper living space can be created : he builds in a project ter@@ raced houses for refugees .
&quot; Mr. Gil@@ dner , many refugees will push for the housing market . &quot;
which solution do you offer ?
Markus Gil@@ dner : the mass accommodation in containers or gy@@ ms has no sustainability .
for people stay in a large part here .
&quot; in view of the flow of refugees , we also need sufficient living space in the coming decades . &quot;
&quot; a very ban@@ al , three @-@ storey ter@@ raced house is the solution . &quot;
heroes of Ple@@ ven Com@@ mem@@ or@@ ated in Moscow W@@ re@@ ath@@ es from the Russian Ministry of Defense and Bulgarian Embassy were laid at the pedi@@ ment of the memorial church .
it facilitates the integration .
this is different if one puts people in blocks of residence .
&quot; each of the six houses built in the pilot project consists of three housing units , each for four asylum seek@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; each unit has two bedrooms , one bathroom , a kitchen and a common room . &quot;
&quot; it can be that many refugees will say it &apos;s peace again , I go back . &quot;

iOS 9 : how to get the new iPhone operating system when Apple Update is released
&quot; the new operating system can be requested by going to &quot; &quot; General &quot; &quot; and then &quot; &quot; Software Update . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; if it is ready , the phone will give you the option to download and then install . &quot;
&quot; some have encountered problems after installation , as they receive an error message stating that the &quot; &quot; Software update failed &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; to avoid the problem , users are advised to either wait until the rush goes back or attempt to update via iTunes . &quot;
the phone itself guides you through the rest of the process .
&quot; this could possibly mean the del@@ e@@ tion of apps to create space - but Apple has made it more likely because of the upgrade of the update . likewise , it will be easier to do this when you use a special tool to delete apps and then re@@ install it as soon as the process is complete . &quot;
&quot; it is worth to ensure that your mobile phone is charged during the update or is located near a charger , so that the battery is charged . &quot;
&quot; if the load is too low , Apple doesn &apos;t allow the update to continue , as the phone might be switched on half way and this could lead to a break @-@ off of the update . &quot;

bad Kis@@ singer Schach@@ club has a prominent member
&quot; Schach@@ club &quot; Schach@@ freunde Bad Kis@@ singen &quot; , which was founded three months ago , has added another member to its ranks , so the membership number increased to 19 players . &quot;

district office is looking for direct contact
Sal@@ u@@ dis and the Alten@@ zentrum Anton@@ ín have joined the social foundation under the man@@ tle of the Sozial@@ stiftung and opened a new office at the Graf @-@ St@@ auff@@ enberg site .
&quot; in addition to consulting , one can also participate in courses . &quot;
the social foundation runs it down from the mountain into the city centre .
more precisely to the Graf @-@ St@@ auff@@ enberg @-@ Platz .
a new district office was recently opened there .
&quot; here , directly next to the shopping market , you will immediately get sen@@ iors and ad@@ dic@@ tive information on questions such as health insurance or services of health insurance companies . &quot;
&quot; for years , we have been working with our ambul@@ ant care service to ensure that often nursing homes are left alone . &quot;
there are infin@@ itely many questions .
&quot; the new land@@ lady Jutta Wei@@ g@@ and , who is also responsible for the Anton@@ ist and the civil hospital as well as for the out@@ patient service &quot; Amadeus &quot; , will not rarely be used as the complexity of insurance companies . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the consult@@ ations , the new district office also offers prevention , health courses and wellness . &quot;
&quot; for this purpose , the Sal@@ u@@ dis was taken into the boat . &quot;
&quot; therefore , you can use additional offers such as assault prevention , memory training or physical therapy . &quot;
the offers of the retirement center and the Sal@@ u@@ dis complement each other in an ideal way .
&quot; Sal@@ u@@ dis stands for prevention , prevention and rehabilitation . &quot;
&quot; the retirement center for care and care , &quot; described Heike R@@ ie@@ del , Managing Director of Sal@@ u@@ dis . &quot;
both executives see the reason for the opening of the new district office in the city centre especially in demographic change .
this makes a good de@@ centralized infrastructure indispensable for the individual districts of Bam@@ berg in the future .
&quot; in addition , Mayor Wolfgang Metz@@ ner ( SPD ) under@@ lined the inaugur@@ ation ceremony , the district office also devoted himself to the club meeting at the age : &quot; there are numerous events and offers on the program and these invite to a regular soci@@ able supplement . &quot;
&quot; thus , the social foundation will make a big contribution that sen@@ iors can live independently and well in their familiar environment . &quot;
&quot; the district office is open Monday , Wednesday and Friday from 9 am to 2 pm , Tuesday and Thursday from 4 am to 6 pm and Saturday from 10 am to 12 pm . &quot;

men tested on 17 @-@ year @-@ old Afgh@@ ans
&quot; witnesses are looking for the police for a incident in Bad So@@ den @-@ Sal@@ mün@@ ster : on Friday evening , at 11 : 45 p.m. , three young men were walking from Bad So@@ den towards Sal@@ mün@@ ster . &quot;
&quot; one from the group , a 17 @-@ year old Afgh@@ an , followed his two friends at a distance of about five meters and called them to wait for him . &quot;
at that time the group was located at the height of the b@@ ft gas station .
there were also three persons on the premises of the petrol station .
one of these men now sh@@ ou@@ ted the young and struck it with the f@@ ist .
the victim suffered a nas@@ al fra@@ cture and bleeding heavily from the nose .
&quot; when his two friends made ha@@ ste and appe@@ aled to the ra@@ cket , he first left his victim . &quot;
&quot; from his friends , the injured young man was now brought home . &quot;
the perpetr@@ ator persec@@ uted the group with a passenger car to their home and passed there demonstr@@ atively several times .
&quot; when you no longer saw the vehicle , the last one went in front of the building to smoke a cigar@@ ette . &quot;
there he was again attacked by the bat and another male .
&quot; with the help of a stroke , one checked on the face and the thi@@ ghs of the victim . &quot;
the injured must be brought to hospital for medical care .
&quot; up to now , there is only a vag@@ ue story description . &quot;
one of the men was about 1.80 meters in size .
the second ra@@ cket was about 1.@@ 65 meters tall and was dressed with a jeans and a brown @-@ white shirt .
the police ask witnesses and instruc@@ tors to sign up under the telephone number 06@@ 181 / 100 @-@ 123 .
Dr. Frank Müller takes over the field of Fel@@ t@@ ville and investing 3@@ 10000 Euro
Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l and Frank Müller ( from left ) take over the practice of Karl @-@ Heinrich and Ur@@ sel Fel@@ ber@@ ausen .
&quot; also , the mayor Bernd Bor@@ mann , economic promot@@ er U@@ ta Sei@@ m @-@ Schw@@ art@@ z and A@@ sen@@ dor@@ fs mayor Hein@@ fried Kab@@ bert are also delighted . &quot;
&quot; in many places in the country , doctors - A@@ sen@@ dorf , on the other hand , have luck : there Dr. Frank Müller will take over the field on October 1 . &quot;
&quot; while Ur@@ sel Fel@@ t@@ auses is reti@@ ring , her husband Karl @-@ Heinrich is still in half a position in the next few months . &quot;
&quot; after a reconstruction phase , Müller opens the practice on October 12 , until then he invested 3@@ 10000 euros into the premises at St@@ .-@@ Mar@@ cell@@ us@@ strasse 6 . &quot;
&quot; it was sympathy at first sight , when the Fel@@ lowship began to meet Frank Müller and his wife Dr. Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l , who currently under@@ took their professional training in the Golden hospital and also wants to get into practice . &quot;
&quot; we always had in mind that the Müll@@ ers would fit well into this practice , &quot; &quot; says Dr. Ur@@ sel Fel@@ steh@@ aus and laugh@@ s . &quot;
&quot; when it was time , I just called it . &quot;
&quot; Müller managed the idea , in future , to operate their own practice in A@@ sen@@ dorf . &quot;
&quot; the proximity and constant contact with the patients are very attractive to us , &quot; says the 39 @-@ year @-@ old Müller . &quot;
&quot; we want to meet and accompany the families over the years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; as an advantage , he also sees to be his own boss . &quot;
and so it was agreed that the gar@@ bage cans bought the house with practice .
they will continue to stay in Bruch@@ hausen @-@ Vil@@ sen .
&quot; there , the two @-@ time family father Frank Müller also grew up , his medical facility in Hanover followed stations in several medical practices as well as in hospitals in Sul@@ ingen , Ni@@ enburg and Rot@@ enburg . &quot;
&quot; he is currently active as a senior physician in Sul@@ ingen , in 2009 he was appointed a senior physician in the Di@@ ep@@ holz district and engaged in volunteer work at the DR@@ K willingness of Bruch@@ hausen @-@ Vil@@ sen . &quot;
&quot; from September 19 , the practice will be prepared for the new boss . &quot;
&quot; while the surgeon Dr Karl @-@ Heinrich Fel@@ steh@@ aus works as a general practitioner , his wife Ur@@ sel ( Intern@@ ist ) speci@@ alis@@ es in g@@ astro@@ enter@@ ology . &quot;
&quot; the gar@@ bage , both inter@@ ni@@ sts , want to settle down as practitioners . &quot;
&quot; the end@@ os@@ copy comes out , &quot; says the 38 @-@ year @-@ old Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l . &quot;
&quot; after the conversion , the rooms will look more modern . &quot;
we will offer more ultr@@ asonic examination as well as long @-@ term and stress @-@ EC@@ G Gs and need a consultation room more .
&quot; in addition , the ED@@ V is completely renewed . &quot;
&quot; as part of a funding programme from the District Circle ( 25@@ 000 Euro ) and the municipality ( 12@@ 500 Euro ) and the municipality ( 12@@ 500 Euro ) , the gar@@ bage can receive a supplement of 500@@ 00 euros . &quot;
&quot; this shows how proud and happy we are , that practice is continued , &quot; says Bernd Bor@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; approximately 2000 patients , according to Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l , come into the field of Fel@@ t@@ ville each quarter , in the North German average practice , there are about 500 . &quot;
there is another doctor &apos;s practice in A@@ sen@@ dorf .
a positive side effect of the practice by Frank Müller : the pharmacy remains according to Ur@@ sel Fel@@ steh@@ ausen in A@@ sen@@ dorf .
&quot; if no successor has been found , it would have gone . &quot;
&quot; by the way , who visits Müll@@ ers &apos;s consultation hour , also looks particularly in familiar faces : taking over the seven medical professionals and the cleaning power of the fields of the fields . &quot;
&quot; with their par@@ ting ends in A@@ sen@@ dorf an era , after all , the doctors have practiced for 30 years . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning we had only two rooms , &quot; Ur@@ sel Fel@@ steh@@ aus rec@@ alls . &quot;
a little melanchol@@ y already sen@@ sed them after the long time .
&quot; but we continue to stay in Hohen@@ mo@@ or and will see many patients still often , &quot; &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; her husband is smiling : &quot; &quot; we have a 6000 square meter plot . &quot;
&quot; so far I have always pressed on gardening , now it could be different . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the pair has two grand@@ children and travels to travel . &quot;
Croatia : &quot; we leave refugees by &quot;
&quot; now the border controls are also transferred to our southern border , &quot; &quot; said Minister of Interior Johanna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner . &quot;
the controls on the Hungarian border remain parallel to this .
&quot; still , it is clear that anyone who wants to ask for asylum has to do so &quot; &quot; of course . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the care and safety of people is in the foreg@@ round .
&quot; but it is clear , however , &quot; that it needs clear signals , &quot; said the Minister . &quot;
&quot; people must know that we don &apos;t accept bound@@ less migration flows , nor about the Austrian @-@ Sloven@@ ian border . &quot;
it needs a controlled approach .
Croatia is considering &quot; Cor@@ ridor &quot; - Slovenia denied
&quot; the Croatian government had previously announced that Slovenia wanted to leave incoming refugees in the direction of Austria and Germany , and under certain circumstances also cor@@ rid@@ ors for the refugees . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , however , this Interior Minister Ves@@ na Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar did not see Z@@ ni@@ dar in Lai@@ bach . &quot;
&quot; the idea of cor@@ rid@@ ors is &quot; absolutely un@@ acceptable , &quot; Slovenia is going to intensi@@ fy the surveillance of the border - especially to Hungary . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , the border with Croatia is already considerably controlled as the outside border of the Schengen area . &quot;
&quot; as the Minister stressed , Sloven@@ es will not want to un@@ lock its borders for refugees . &quot;
&quot; every EU member must fill out its commitments , otherwise the system cannot function , &quot; &quot; stressed Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar . &quot;
&quot; as the Croatian government announced , the first refugees had already tried to travel in eastern Croatia at the border crossing of T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik / Si@@ d to ev@@ ade the registration . &quot;
the Croatian police could pick them up in the nearby corn fields .
&quot; according to local media , the Croatian T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik continues to meet new refugees with new refugees in the Croatian T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik . &quot;
&quot; it was mainly about Syri@@ ans and Afgh@@ ans , including numerous women and children . &quot;
rescue services and the Red Cross are already in use .
&quot; in the coming days , his country expects some 4,000 refugees , said Minister of Interior , R@@ ank@@ o O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic . &quot;
&quot; in addition , buses from Pres@@ evo on the Mac@@ ed@@ onian @-@ Serbian border , which hi@@ ther@@ to been transferred to the Hungarian border , would be diver@@ ted towards Croatia , consul@@ ted Croatian and Serbian media on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; the government in Belgrade , however , denied that it was the people to propose certain routes : &quot; neither can we , nor do we want to do so , &quot; it was said . &quot;
&quot; according to media reports , in the morning a first bus with around 50 refugees arrived in the Serbian border town of Si@@ d , in the course of the day further buses would be expected . &quot;
&quot; about Croatia , Slovenia and Austria to Germany &quot;
&quot; the occup@@ ants were all the night away from the Mac@@ ed@@ onian border , some 500 kilometres away from Serbia . &quot;
&quot; we heard that Hungary has admitted , so the police said that we should drive here , &quot; &quot; said one of the refugees . &quot;
&quot; they wanted to travel to Germany through Croatia , Slovenia and Austria . &quot;
&quot; in fact , the postpon@@ ed postpon@@ ement of the former Balkan route Turkey @-@ Greece @-@ Macedonia @-@ Hungary @-@ Hungary could actually reach a somewhat further west @-@ west route . &quot;
Croatia : &quot; comprehensive ways of border control &quot;
Croatian Minister of Interior Minister O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic had previously stressed that his country had prepared plans for the case of a strong influ@@ x of refugees .
&quot; he did not call it , but he pointed out that Croatia was a non @-@ Schengen member &quot; comprehensive options for border control . &quot; &quot;
strict controls are carried out in order to qualify for membership in the Schengen area .
&quot; since 2007 , Slovenia has been a member of the EU . since then , the EU partners have consistently issued a good testimony to the standards of border controls . &quot;
&quot; on the Serbian side , some 300 refugees are stuck behind the Hungarian border fence . &quot;
&quot; according to Belgrade news reports , they would have spent the past night at the border crossing Hor@@ gos , which leads to R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke . &quot;
&quot; according to the Hungarian authorities , the two border cross@@ ings Hor@@ gos and Back@@ i Bre@@ g remain completely blocked . &quot;
&quot; whether the remaining refugees are now going to travel to the Croatian border , is still un@@ clear . &quot;
Serbian interior minister N@@ ebo@@ j@@ sa Stef@@ an@@ ovic was trying to calm the Wednesday early on a local appearance in Hor@@ gos : he kept the debates on alternative routes of refugees after the Hungarian border now is closed for premature .
it would not currently deal with very high refugee figures .
&quot; they cannot say whether they would continue their journey through Hungary , Croatia or another country . &quot;
hel@@ pers advise migrants - dangerous - alternative routes
&quot; however , private Hungarian refugee shel@@ ters have already started distribut@@ ing maps on which alternative routes are marked by Croatia . &quot;
&quot; however , the border crossing between Serbia and Croatia is not harmless : in parts of the border area there are also still not large min@@ e@@ fields after the end of the Croatian war . &quot;
&quot; on Wednesday afternoon , the Croatian police announced that a team of mine clearance was sent to the border region . &quot;

&quot; with the information captured , insi@@ der deals should have been made on the financial markets . &quot;
&quot; in this way , the investig@@ ators were considered a total of more than $ 100 million . &quot;
&quot; today &apos;s comparison shows that even those outside our borders are ultimately tra@@ pped , &quot; says the SE@@ C communication . &quot;
the trial against 32 further accused in the event continued .
most of the accused came from Ukraine and Georgia .
the perpetr@@ ators should have acted in both the US and Eastern Europe .

&quot; with this action , the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical Hos@@ pi@@ ce aid brought attention to its 20 @-@ year existence and is quite confron@@ ting itself with mixed reactions . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s about life , so we went with the action in the middle of the city and among the people , &quot; says Jos@@ ef@@ ine Lam@@ mer . &quot;
the Head of E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical Hos@@ pi@@ ce help is available to the pass@@ ers as well as for questions and conversations like the volunteers .
&quot; while maneu@@ ver@@ ing a pass@@ ant spontane@@ ously to the chal@@ k and the phrase &quot; &quot; my life be@@ j@@ es &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; go with the camper through the USA &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; stop the war &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; not long suffer &quot; , &quot; others remain short , read , say phrases like &quot; so far I am not yet &quot; and then go on . &quot;
&quot; again and again , small discussions about the action are developing over the life , dealing with dying . &quot;
Peter H@@ üb@@ inger is also on site .
&quot; only when I realize that at some point the end of this world is coming , I can live in a responsible way , &quot; says the director of the Di@@ ac@@ onal Plant of Mannheim , which together with the Car@@ it@@ as@@ verband carrier of the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical Hos@@ pi@@ z@@ aid is . &quot;
&quot; therefore , this public @-@ effective action for 20 @-@ year @-@ old is good . &quot;
&quot; however , it is understandable , after all , it is a very personal thing . &quot;
&quot; the topic of death and death is still afflic@@ ted with tab@@ oos , so the experience of Jos@@ ef@@ ine Lam@@ mer , although the hos@@ pi@@ ce movement in recent years has contributed greatly to the fact that people open up . &quot;

&quot; when the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical Hos@@ pi@@ z@@ aid was looking for hon@@ orary members , she immediately reported and was part of the founding in 1995 . &quot;
&quot; Go@@ def@@ roid is part of a team of 45 volunteers - 43 women and two men - the affected and relatives in private households , hospitals , nursing homes , and hos@@ pi@@ ce Saint Vincent . &quot;
all of them are trained carefully .

&quot; Fed@@ Ex reports dis@@ ap@@ pointing results for the last quarter , and the supply giant consolidated his outlook for a whole year due to the weaker demand for freight services and higher costs in his bo@@ d@@ land transport service . &quot;
&quot; the company also said it plans to spend some 55@@ ,000 seasonal workers on holiday . &quot;
&quot; at this time last year , Fed@@ Ex announced that the company would like to set 50,000 seasonal workers for the holiday season . &quot;
the share fell by 2.5 percent in the market trading 45 minutes before the opening on Wednesday .
&quot; Fed@@ Ex Corp. said to earn a profit of $ 10,@@ 40 and 10,@@ 90 $ in the financial year that ends in May , 20 cent less than in previous forecast . &quot;
analysts expected a survey of Fac@@ t@@ Set 10.@@ 84 $ .
&quot; the lower view comes despite the price increases , which amount to 4.@@ 9 percent and will be effective on 4 January and despite higher allow@@ ances for bo@@ d@@ gers of heavy and large packages , which will be collected from November . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said that the company delivers solid income when considering the weaker economic conditions , especially in manufacturing and global trade . &quot;
&quot; the plans for the holiday @-@ employment were announced one day later than that of the Ri@@ val U@@ PS , which plans to employ 90@@ ,000 to 95@@ ,000 extra workers , approximately the same number as last year . &quot;
&quot; in the quarter , which ended on 31 August , Fed@@ Ex deser@@ ved 6@@ 92 million $ , 6 percent more than in the previous year . &quot;
&quot; earnings per share stood at 2.@@ 42 $ per share , just behind the 2.@@ 44 $ per share , the twelve analysts predicted by Z@@ acks Investment Research . &quot;
sales rose by 5 percent to 12.@@ 3 billion $ .
six of Z@@ acks asked analysts predicted 12.@@ 23 billion $ .
&quot; in recent years , Fed@@ Ex has reported a decline in international pri@@ ori@@ tiz@@ ing ship@@ ments , which brought sales in its unit express disp@@ at@@ ching . &quot;
but the boom in online shopping has increased the results at Fed@@ Ex Ground .
&quot; in the last quarter , net sales increased by 29 percent , but the operating result was basically flat due to higher costs for larger packages and self @-@ insurance . &quot;
&quot; the Express unit recorded higher income due to higher prices , while the result fell due to higher labour costs in the cargo business . &quot;
&quot; in the market trading , about an hour before the opening , the Fed@@ Ex shares fell by 3.@@ 85 $ , or 2.5 percent , to 15@@ 0.@@ 15 . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , they closed with 11 percent loss for the year and 17 percent below a record high on June 11 . &quot;
&quot; on their most expected meeting in the years , Federal Reserve strateg@@ ists spend two days sitting around a 27 foot Hondur@@ an ma@@ ho@@ gan@@ y table to decide whether it is time to raise the body for the first time for almost a decade . &quot;
&quot; dro@@ oping over them at an end of the two @-@ storey sitting hall , there is a wall picture of the United States . &quot;
the map is a reminder that the F@@ ed chairman Jan@@ et L. Y@@ ellen and her colleagues should put the economic interests of the nation before all other things .
the central bank has a two @-@ fold order from Congress : maxim@@ ising US employment and prices remain stable here .
&quot; but since the great recession , the F@@ ed leaders have acknowledged that there is an un@@ written third mandate : financial stability . &quot;
&quot; and this third mandate could be the X @-@ factor in a decision that is too tight to pre@@ dict it . on Thursday , it will be announced on Thursday whether the US economy is ready to be we@@ an@@ ed by unprecedented interest rate by the close short @-@ term interest rate since the end of 2008 . &quot;
&quot; although most of the data of the economy show that it grows solid , recent turbul@@ ence on the global financial markets could fri@@ ghten the already cau@@ tious F@@ ed representatives to rein@@ force this volati@@ lity by raising the interest rate for federal bonds - and be it only a quarter percentage point . &quot;
&quot; obviously , the labour market and inflation are primarily the most important thing to observe , &quot; said Lind@@ sey M. Pi@@ eg@@ za , chief econom@@ ist at the bro@@ ker company Sti@@ fel Nicol@@ aus &amp; Co . &quot;
&quot; but I think if they were looking for a pre@@ text to not increase the interest rate , the increased uncertainty around the global market is enough justi@@ fication to continue to wait , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; there is no consensus on what the F@@ ed is doing , which sec@@ ures itself to the financial market . &quot;
&quot; about half of the econom@@ ists , recently inter@@ viewed by Blo@@ om@@ berg , have predicted an interest rate this week . &quot;
&quot; financial markets , however , expect a waiting for the F@@ ed , with a key indicator which only shows a 30 % chance for an increase . &quot;
&quot; this indicates a decline in the stock market , if the F@@ ed increases the sentence unless the strateg@@ ists l@@ essen the blow by promising that another increase is far away . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , the Dow Jones Industrial average value was 2@@ 28,@@ 89 points or by 1.4 % to 16.@@ 59@@ 9,@@ 85 . &quot;
&quot; the action was triggered by expectations that the F@@ ed policy maintained the sentence this week , said John Lon@@ ski , Chief econom@@ ist of Moo@@ dy &apos;s Capital Markets Research Group . &quot;
&quot; it would be a surprise if the F@@ ed would lift the sentences at that time , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; if she does , she would have to go very far in her statement in order to calm the financial markets so that they don &apos;t panic . &quot;
&quot; other experts argued that a interest rate would calm the financial markets , because they would remove uncertainty about when the F@@ ed would act . &quot;
&quot; a month ago , the F@@ ed seemed good to increase the set by 0.25 percentage points this month , the first small step in a slow shar@@ pen@@ ing of monetary conditions that would test the strength of recovery in the US . &quot;
&quot; Y@@ ellen had said in spring and early summer that this year , despite the complaints of liber@@ als , that more economic progress would be required , an increase in the sentence was expected . &quot;
&quot; although the job creation slow@@ ed down in August , improvement in the labour market was sound this year . &quot;
&quot; the unemployment rate dropped to 5.1 % last month , the lowest for over seven years and close to the level that the F@@ ed sees as full employment . &quot;
wage increases have shown signs of recovery .
&quot; although inflation continued to decline under the annual target of 2 % of the Central Bank , the F@@ ed representatives said that the main reason is the temporary impact of significantly lower oil prices . &quot;
&quot; the economy can handle higher interest rates and needs it because of the tension on the labour market , &quot; said Ian Sh@@ ep@@ her@@ man , Chief econom@@ ist of Pan@@ the@@ on Macro@@ economics . &quot;
&quot; but the financial markets around the world were ch@@ oked at the end of last month , after China had utilized its currency . &quot;
&quot; the Dow Jones Industrial average value fell by more than 16 % in May , as investors were afraid that a slow@@ down of the Chinese economy would th@@ rot@@ tle global growth . &quot;
forecasts to 2018 illustrate how the market is set to change .
&quot; for the F@@ ed representatives , the market tum@@ ul@@ tu@@ ous influence the complex calculation of when to increase interest rates . &quot;
&quot; if events on the financial markets and the news on the weakness of the Chinese economy have not occurred over the past few weeks , they would attract the re@@ ins in this meeting , &quot; said Stephen D. O@@ lin@@ ers , Senior Research Fel@@ low at the U@@ C@@ LA Zim@@ an Center for Real Estate and a former employee of the US emergency tank . &quot;
now he pre@@ di@@ cts that she will wait at least one month to get a grip on the effects .
&quot; there is a lot of uncertainty about what the impact on the U.S. economy will be , and there is almost no reliable data describing developments in China , &quot; said O@@ lin@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; the health of the world economy is none of the main concerns of the F@@ ed , so it should not be taken into account in terms of technical decision making . &quot;
&quot; but in the end , the F@@ ed Monetary Authority has become the world . &quot;
the influence of the central bank has been enormous over the past few years .
&quot; the mere suggestion of the former leader Ben S. Bern@@ anke in 2013 , that the F@@ ed could &quot; &quot; narrow &quot; &quot; their monetary expansion , triggered confusion around the globe . &quot;
&quot; in a world where markets and economies are increasingly inter@@ tw@@ ined , the F@@ ed representatives are expected to monitor not only the developments elsewhere , but also consult other central banks and experts to gain a better understanding of the global economy . &quot;
&quot; her decision @-@ making is &quot; more art than science , &quot; said Zach@@ ary Kar@@ ab@@ ell , head of the global strategy for managing the company En@@ vest@@ net Inc . &quot;
&quot; Jeff@@ rey Lack@@ er , President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Rich@@ mond , VA . , re@@ marked this month that &quot; the F@@ ed has a history of transactions on financial market movements that apparently are not associated with economic fundam@@ entals . &quot;
&quot; acqu@@ er , voting rights member of the Federal Open Market Committee , comm@@ itting an interest in interest , made decisions in the years 1998 / 1999 as an example . &quot;
&quot; a financial crisis in Asia brought the F@@ ed to lower their Lei@@ tz@@ ins by 0.@@ 75 percentage points in three sessions , &quot; despite limiting percep@@ tible impact on growth in the US . &quot; &quot;
a year later the F@@ ed representatives with@@ drew these cuts .
&quot; the F@@ ed should put aspects of financial stability only during a serious crisis such as the 2008 market composition , said Adam S. P@@ osen , former member of the Committee for the Inter@@ est Sett@@ lement of the Bank of England . &quot;
&quot; the youngest turbul@@ ences do not come near this level , he said . &quot;
&quot; she certainly does not want to get into the situation in which she fears a interest in interest , because the markets are exciting , &quot; &quot; said Poz@@ nan , President of the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot;
&quot; the Federal Reserve Act still contains the double mandate and does not mention financial stability , and until that is changed , I do not believe it should advance the time . &quot;

Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da : small Leben@@ sh@@ ilfe for refugees
more and more refugees arrive in Germany these days .
&quot; to prepare a warm welcome , do not go without the commitment of countless volunteer hel@@ pers . &quot;
&quot; in Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da , there are a number of people who support un@@ sel@@ fish asylum seek@@ ers in the city . &quot;
among them are Petra and Klaus H@@ eine .
Petra H@@ eine is a teacher with body and soul .
she still likes to teach with her 74 lessons .
every Thursday she does it at the asylum seek@@ ers home at D@@ ill@@ inger Street .
&quot; it helps refugees from Syria , Kur@@ dist@@ an , Kosovo and Pakistan to learn German language . &quot;
&quot; of course , the whole of other classes is considered to be at the right school . &quot;
Brazil &apos;s pa@@ edi@@ atric society Rio Grande promotes healthy breast@@ feeding
the Brazilian pedi@@ atric organization Spr@@ S tries to elu@@ ci@@ date women in a sho@@ cking way how important good nutrition is during lac@@ tation . it does this with the presentation of pictures of babies who are painted on breasts which are painted with represent@@ ations of un@@ healthy foods .
&quot; breast milk consists of a variety of proteins , fats , vitamins and carbohydrates that give babies all the nutrients they need to build a strong immune system . &quot;
&quot; due to the additional energy requirements , pregnant and young mothers are advised to increase their daily cal@@ orie intake by about 500 calories per day . &quot;
&quot; however , new research findings suggest that higher cal@@ orie intake is not the only dietary adjustment that mothers should undertake . &quot;
&quot; a recent study conducted by Robert Water@@ land , Professor at the Bay@@ lor College of Medicine in Texas , showed that a healthy diet actually affects the genes of her babies and protects them from the development of tum@@ ours . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , an un@@ healthy diet of the child can adver@@ sely affect the immune system . &quot;
exceptions to the new gym Bern@@ rie@@ der Sp@@ orth@@ alle
the municipal council Bern@@ ried approved the contract for the 2.3 million euros expensive sports hall .
and he made an exception .
the roof must be flat@@ ter for solar system .
&quot; the planning for the long @-@ awa@@ ited gy@@ ms industry at the Bern@@ rie@@ der Sport area is progres@@ sing step by step : in the recent municipal meeting , the elabor@@ ated building contract has been unanim@@ ously approved without major discussions . &quot;
&quot; among other things , the committee had already approved an application for a &quot; &quot; resp@@ ectable &quot; &quot; exemp@@ tion from the valid development plan . &quot;
&quot; the exception &quot; &quot; was the permission for a special form regarding the roof construction . &quot;
&quot; accordingly , a &quot; saddle roof with non @-@ m@@ illed first and roof over@@ board &quot; should be erected . &quot;
&quot; the planning is the intended use of the roof surface for solar installations : &quot; this is how we get a wonderfully large southern roof , &quot; &quot; explained Mayor Josef St@@ eigen@@ berger in the meeting . &quot;
&quot; in the case of &quot; &quot; liberation &quot; , &quot; again , the roof inc@@ lin@@ ation , which for energetic reasons - was stipul@@ ated differently from the development plan - should lie under ten degrees . &quot;
the volume of the hall is thus significantly reduced .
&quot; &quot; &quot; liberation &quot; &quot; was therefore necessary because the plan of building on the roof inc@@ lin@@ ation was not &quot; &quot; exceptions &quot; &quot; - whereby Bern@@ rie@@ der &apos;s municipal council normally travels more restri@@ ctive when it comes to liber@@ ating orders . &quot;
&quot; however , it is not a recur@@ ring project for the gy@@ ms industry : &quot; we do not create a preced@@ ent , &quot; says St@@ eigen@@ berger . &quot;
the gym hall at the sports centre is a community project of the municipality and SV Bern@@ ried .
around 2.3 million euros are calculated at the cost .
subsidies are expected from school and long@@ itude transport .
&quot; in the next step , the building extension for the 18 x 36 meter hall will now be submitted to the Council of Agriculture . &quot;
Klinik Pei@@ ßen@@ berg moves to Sch@@ ong@@ au
the Pei@@ ßen@@ berg hospital should be closed earlier than planned - namely 2016 .
&quot; at the same time , Dr. Wilhelm Fischer ( 66 ) becomes the new medical director at the Sch@@ ong@@ au hospital . &quot;
the station as well as the majority of staff move from Pei@@ ßen@@ berg to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
&quot; this shows the surprising plans of the hospital GmbH of the county , which confirmed the coun@@ cill@@ or Andrea J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß . &quot;
&quot; however , a decision about this is the Supervisory Board , and the meeting conven@@ es on Wednesday , 23 September . &quot;
&quot; if plans are to be implemented , all of the nearly 50 employees would be employed at the hospital in Pei@@ ßen@@ berg . &quot;
the overwhelming majority should be reloc@@ ated to Sch@@ ong@@ au with Fischer and the further existing In@@ ner Station .
the rooms are available .
&quot; the employees , who cannot go to Sch@@ ong@@ au , should be offered a job in Wei@@ l@@ heim , so J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß . &quot;
the staff were informed about the plans .
&quot; the change is initiated by Dr. Andreas E@@ der , who has been the medical director of the Sch@@ ong@@ auer Clinic since the beginning of the year and is now moving to a private practice in close proximity to the hospital . &quot;
&quot; according to J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White , the name &quot; Fischer &quot; came into play with the question of who he was willing to take over leadership from October 1 and to move with his team to Sch@@ ong@@ au . &quot;
&quot; for the house in Sch@@ ong@@ au this applies in every case a &quot; &quot; appreciation &quot; &quot; and a diversi@@ fication of the offer in the area &quot; &quot; Internal Medicine &quot; , &quot; said J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß . &quot;
Fischer is a specialist in pac@@ emaker and de@@ fibr@@ ill@@ ators .
Sch@@ ong@@ au ( 180 beds ) is specialized in the In@@ ner Station on g@@ astro@@ enter@@ ologic diseases .
&quot; for the next two years , Fischer is said to be with his team if the Supervisory Board agre@@ es to the two houses , until then next year the former hospital of the scar@@ ce that still has 35 beds in Pei@@ ßen@@ berg should be closed for almost 140 years . &quot;
&quot; until now , the District Circle had planned this for 2018 , when the currently running rehabilitation at the Wei@@ l@@ heim hospital is completed . &quot;
&quot; Mr. J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß , who is also chairman of the Supervisory Board , meets rum@@ ours that the House , which is owned by the Bundes@@ kn@@ app@@ schaft , will in future be used as accommodation for asylum seek@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; that I shut out . &quot; as it goes on with the property , J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White could not say there are several considerations . &quot;
currently there is a short @-@ term care of the Car@@ itas and a daily sy@@ chiat@@ ry .
&quot; what better could not happen to us , such an opportunity does not come back , &quot; &quot; said Fis@@ her about the Qu@@ asi move to the Le@@ ch , which was received by the employees &quot; positive and very understanding . &quot; &quot;
&quot; a real perspective for the house where fishermen worked as a chief physician for over 30 years , did not exist . &quot;
he was asked by Sch@@ ong@@ auer &apos;s colleagues to take over the post of the medical director .
&quot; the hospital Pei@@ ßen@@ berg ( formerly 100 beds ) has been threatened with closure in recent decades , det@@ achments were closed , for example surgery and ob@@ st@@ et@@ rics . &quot;
the hand@@ b@@ aller of the Rhein @-@ Neck@@ ar lions are required tonight ( 8.@@ 15 p.m. ) at the Berg@@ isches HC .

refugees need accommodation : study war@@ ns of housing
the location on the German housing market is ten@@ se .
more and more refugees are looking for an affordable stay .
the pressure on the housing market is growing .
the social housing construction is facing a challenge .
the distribution matches on the German housing market have long since begun .
&quot; with the coming refugees and job@@ seek@@ ers from the EU , more and more people are pushing for a market that is already over@@ bur@@ dened in many big cities . &quot;
they compete with low @-@ income citizens around the last affordable housing .
&quot; in order to cover the demand for affordable housing , 400@@ ,000 new units would have to be built by 2020 . &quot;
&quot; this results in a study commissioned by the &quot; &quot; Social Housing Construction &quot; &quot; Association . &quot;
&quot; for comparison , there are 26@@ 0,000 units ready in Germany this year . &quot;
&quot; thus , 140@@ .000 dwell@@ ings are missing . &quot;
&quot; after the first three months of their stay , refugees are no longer obliged to live as asylum seek@@ ers in an emergency accommodation . &quot;
many come across the housing market and lined up in the long queu@@ es in front of the apartments .
&quot; according to the Federal Statistical Office , however , less than half of all asylum seek@@ ers lived in the last year . &quot;
&quot; the negative development of the housing market , however , is not only due to the rising refugee figures . &quot;
the study also made significant fail@@ ures in the housing policy of recent years .
&quot; Germany pus@@ hes a housing deficit in front of itself , which will grow from year to year . &quot;
&quot; currently , in the metrop@@ olitan areas already around 7@@ 0,000 units already lack@@ ed , Matthias Günther , author of the study . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , many professionals also lived in large @-@ scale cities in W@@ G rooms . &quot;
young adults stayed un@@ tarily because of the F@@ lau@@ te in the housing market longer in the &quot; Hotel Mama . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; in order to solve the problem , the Alliance &quot; Social Housing Construction &quot; proposes a new start . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , new incen@@ tives should boost the social housing construction . &quot;
&quot; in this way , the land Tax will not be wai@@ ved and the property tax for subsi@@ dised flats may be suspended . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , according to the alliance attractive tax de@@ preci@@ ation possibilities are necessary . &quot;
the funding programme for Refu@@ ge@@ e Refu@@ ge@@ es of the Kf@@ W state bank is already well received by towns and municipalities .
&quot; a good week after the start , on Monday evening , with 184 million euros , more than half of the available costs had been rec@@ alled . &quot;
&quot; now , the project could even be raised . &quot;
refugees have free money : Croatia and Slovenia direct cor@@ ridor
&quot; Hungary is practically no longer passing , as more and more refugees choose the way over Croatia . &quot;
Zagreb announces to grant entry through Slovenia to the north without hur@@ d@@ les .
&quot; however , the route is dangerous . &quot;
Croatia wants to communicate with neighbouring Slovenia on the establishment of a cor@@ ridor for refugees .
&quot; I spoke to the Sloven@@ ian Interior Minister and if it is necessary , we will organize a cor@@ ridor , &quot; &quot; said the Croatian Minister of Interior , R@@ ank@@ o O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic . &quot;
Slovenia lies between Croatia and Austria and is already part of the Schengen area .
the EU country Croatia is not yet a Schengen country .
&quot; after the isolation of the Serbian @-@ Hungarian border , hundreds of refugees came to Croatia to get to Western Europe from there . &quot;
&quot; 500 people have come across the border at T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik , the Croatian television station RT@@ L reports . &quot;
Hungary had sealed off its border for refugees on the eve of the day .
new laws that came into force on the same day are practically unnecessary in Hungary .
Croatia wants to let refugees pass .
Croatian Prime Minister Zor@@ an Mil@@ an@@ ovic stated : &quot; you can travel through and we prepare for this possibility . &quot;
&quot; these people are there , there are women , children and men who want to live and achieve something . &quot;
&quot; however , there are people who did not want to live in Croatia . &quot;
&quot; in the morning , the Croatian police took up the first refugees at the Serbian border to the EU neighbourhood of Croatia . &quot;
&quot; most of the media reports are from Syria , Iran and Afghanistan . &quot;
they came both by bus and with taxis in the Serbian border town of Si@@ d .
&quot; immediately after their arrival , they would have tried to get on foot over the green border to Croatia . &quot;
&quot; at the Croatian @-@ Serbian border , the refugees are not encounter@@ ing f@@ ences . &quot;
&quot; for this , the border strip holds other dangers : there are still sharp mines from the Yugosla@@ v civil war in the 1990s . &quot;
mine clear@@ ers should quickly create a safe passage .
&quot; according to Hungary , there are hardly any refugees after the closure of the border . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , the police numbered 1,@@ 366 people . &quot;
&quot; shortly before closing on Monday , there were still 93@@ 80 . &quot;
the new Hungarian laws grade the over@@ coming and damage of the border zone as a crime .
&quot; in the south @-@ western border town of Sz@@ eg@@ ed , 35 criminal proceedings were initiated . &quot;
the condemned thre@@ aten prison sentences of up to five years and the deport@@ ation from the country .
&quot; according to the immigration authority , on Tuesday , a total of 94 asylum applications have been accepted on Tuesday in the newly appointed &quot; Tran@@ sit zones , &quot; almost all of which - 93 - the most important transition from R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke . &quot;
&quot; among the applicant are 13 families with small children , as well as two elderly people . &quot;
&quot; on Wednesday morning , there were still 40 refugees . &quot;
&quot; practically , no one has a chance to obtain asylum in Hungary . &quot;
&quot; according to Hungarian opinion , Serbia is a &quot; &quot; safe third country &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the rejected asylum seek@@ ers shall be dep@@ orted thi@@ ther .
only a few hundred refugees gathered in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke before the &quot; transit zone &quot; in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
&quot; in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke , workers began to clean up . &quot;
they gathered the gar@@ bage that had left thousands of people in the last few weeks on the road@@ side .
barrier grid were disman@@ tled and one of the recording centers in the bor@@ der@@ line was rebuilt .
no one wanted to express itself to the goal of this reconstruction .
&quot; after the closure of the border between Serbia and Hungary , Austria only few refugees arrive . &quot;
the country has also reinforced its border controls .
&quot; however , around 20,000 migrants were still in the country for government information . &quot;
&quot; in Salzburg , about 1400 people are waiting for the move to Germany . &quot;
train traffic from there to Germany was stopped at the instruction of German authorities in the morning .
&quot; in Frei@@ las@@ sing , small groups of refugees met on a regular basis . &quot;
mayor drove &quot; str@@ anded &quot; across the border
&quot; we were occupied after the bridge festival on Sunday , when ten people with travel officers were at the entrance of the tent , &quot; said W@@ ern@@ stein mayor Alo@@ is Stad@@ ler . &quot;
&quot; tourists , they wanted to go by train to Pass@@ au . &quot;
&quot; but because Germany had surprisingly adjusted the rail traffic with Austria on Sunday because of the flow of refugees , it was in W@@ ern@@ stein &apos;s end , &quot; &quot; Stad@@ ler , who immediately offered his help and ch@@ apped the borders together with two other hel@@ pers and their cars across the border into the Nah@@ e Pass@@ au . &quot;
&quot; prior to that , we first wi@@ ped out the un@@ hoped guests , with snacks and drinks . &quot;
&quot; we said the same , we bring them by car to Pass@@ au . &quot;
&quot; this was a matter of course for us , &quot; &quot; says Stad@@ ler in the O@@ Ö@@ N discussion . &quot;
they were very grateful .
a man could not take it to give a generous donation - 100 Euro for the fire bri@@ g@@ ade .
&quot; that made us very happy , &quot; &quot; says Stad@@ ler . &quot;
&quot; on Sunday evening in W@@ els , the boar@@ ded train passengers had switched from an ICE to a regional train towards Pass@@ au , in order to make it possible after the short notice that the railway traffic was adjusted to Germany , but still to try on the border . &quot;
&quot; the regional train , however , was stopped at the river Inn before the border . &quot;
&quot; in W@@ ern@@ stein , the border crossing is generally high in the course . &quot;
&quot; the bridge @-@ fest association with Bavarian neighbours on Sunday soci@@ alized , days before a two @-@ brid@@ ged run sporting - organised by the Union W@@ ern@@ stein and Bayern from Neu@@ kirchen . &quot;
&quot; that Viktor Or@@ b@@ án now sends a number of tens of thousands to us , is a logical result of a hypo@@ critical policy : &quot;
&quot; instead of assi@@ sting in the R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke camp immediately in the establishment of structures that ensure humanity , our Chancellor has publicly acknowledged the position of the Hungarian government in the Dun@@ st@@ kreis of National Socialism . &quot;
&quot; sorry , there is no translation for this news @-@ article . &quot;
&quot; even the refugees will find that the &quot; &quot; Pro@@ mis@@ ed Land &quot; , &quot; which they invited and welcomed , is nothing but another refugee camp . &quot;
&quot; it will be a great challenge , given the ongoing flow of refugees and the coming winter , to establish decent conditions for seek@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; and there will be an even greater - peace , security and stability in Austria . &quot;
Konrad on the search for 35@@ .000 con@@ servatory quar@@ ts
&quot; on the other hand , Konrad has all hands to do with the support of refugees . &quot;
Christian Konrad is used to having his word weight .
the government has used the former powerful Rai@@ ff@@ eisen bank to set up districts for the thousands of refugees .
the chaos in the first emergency centre Tra@@ is@@ kirchen has already got a grip on Konrad .
&quot; we have no hom@@ eless people in Tra@@ is@@ kirchen , &quot; he reported on his first success . &quot;
&quot; also the housing of the 20,000 refugees who came to Austria on Monday was without great emp@@ athy , &quot; &quot; Konrad and praised the organisational &quot; &quot; Master &apos;s performance . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the Interior Ministry , on the other hand , spoke of a &quot; crisis @-@ like situation . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in total , Konrad calcul@@ ates with a demand of 85@@ .000 districts in the he@@ ur@@ thy year . &quot;
&quot; in order to meet the number , 35@@ ,000 accommodations will have to be found in the coming weeks - 20,000 are supposed to provide 15,000 the federal government . &quot;
&quot; should it be more refugees , we can do it . &quot;
&quot; but it is not a barrel without soil , &quot; &quot; said Konrad . &quot;
&quot; with the provincial governor , he has already had talks . &quot;
&quot; they would have assured him , too , to create qu@@ arti@@ ere for the refugees coming . &quot;
&quot; in Upper Austria it runs fine , &quot; said Ferry Mai@@ er . &quot;
the former VP @-@ Mand@@ olin supports Konrad .
&quot; there will be a meeting with Cardinal Christoph Schön@@ born tomorrow , and will be clari@@ fied how the Church will help . &quot;
&quot; the asylum @-@ coordin@@ ator also places great expectations in the OR@@ F campaign &quot; &quot; Hel@@ ping as we . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; on the platform , individuals can easily offer accom@@ od@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; in addition , one hopes for hotels that are empty in winter . &quot;
&quot; Konrad and Mai@@ er critic@@ ised the standards for housing as &quot; &quot; very high . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; in times of emergency , it cannot be that districts have to keep a certain height of the towel holder or size of the overhead . &quot;
&quot; for a temporary period , &quot; emergency standards &quot; would have to be considered . &quot;
&quot; in contrast to the Interior Ministry , he is more successful in housing , Konrad with his experience . &quot;
&quot; I am an older gentle@@ man , whom one does not say without further into the face the fal@@ seh@@ ood . &quot;
persu@@ asion is his most important weapon .
&quot; Konrad and Mai@@ er do not cause any costs of the Republic , as they themselves declared themselves . &quot;
their number of employees want to increase them to three to four .
the company &apos;s own district search has not been successful so far .
Konrad wanted to establish a container at the Steph@@ an@@ splatz as an office .
but there are apparently problems with the permission .
Linz calls for a better division
&quot; first , there is no opening of municipal sports hall and other buildings such as tips @-@ arena and design centers to accommodate refugees planning the city of Linz . &quot;
&quot; this is not necessary at the moment , since the affected persons can currently be accommod@@ ated without these measures , says Mayor Klaus Lu@@ ger ( SP ) . &quot;
&quot; for emer@@ gen@@ cies , however , further locations should be tested for its suitability . &quot;
&quot; in recent years , problems of matching the skill requirements of jobs and employees &quot; qualifications have come into the focus of scientific discussions . &quot;
other districts also have to make their contribution .
seals : &quot; limits are not sealed &quot;
&quot; in a longer call with the Bavarian Prime Minister Horst Seeh@@ o@@ fer ( CS@@ U ) , Landes@@ haupt@@ mann Josef P@@ ühr@@ inger ( VP ) held the further procedure in the refugee issue on Monday . &quot;
Seeh@@ o@@ fer has assured me that the German borders are not sealed .
it is still possible to continue the journey of refugees to the Federal Republic of Germany .
&quot; however , there is now the corresponding border controls . &quot;
there will be no more special moves with refugees to Germany .
&quot; however , the seek@@ ers would be brought to Germany with regular trains . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; from the other EU member states , P@@ ühr@@ inger once called for greater solidarity in the refugee issue . &quot;
&quot; for P@@ ühr@@ inger , Austria is now also a logical consequence of the actions of the Germans . &quot;
Run@@ t@@ astic is a matter of time
the general refurbis@@ hment of the &quot; Die Neue Wer@@ ft &quot; in the Linz industrial line has been officially completed .
&quot; in four of the six floors of the office and production building , the listed IT group S &amp; T is set up , the rest ( 2700 square meters ) is to be le@@ ased to young , innovative companies from the technology sector . &quot;
&quot; in IT , the wise heads are our raw material - and we must try to work for us , &quot; says S &amp; T CEO Hannes Nieder@@ haus@@ er . &quot;
&quot; he could imagine investing in startup companies of the new shi@@ py@@ ard , and later to equi@@ p them . &quot;
&quot; from the very beginning , S &amp; T wants to cooperate with the new neighbours - whereby Nieder@@ haus@@ er promises a lot : &quot; the next Run@@ t@@ astic is just a matter of time . &quot;
&quot; 1.7 million euros have been invested in the site by S &amp; T , 3.3 million euros from the Tech@@ Center , which belongs to one third of the city of Linz , the land of Upper Austria and the Federal Government ( FF@@ G ) . &quot;
the building is le@@ ased by Linz AG for 60 years to S &amp; T as well as Tech@@ Center .
&quot; 30 percent of the 2700 square meters of residual surface in the building are already le@@ ased , for another 40 per cent there are requests . &quot;
Li@@ a @-@ Per@@ oni @-@ In@@ hab@@ or opened second business in the arcade
&quot; in the new shop , Fur@@ la hand@@ bags are at the centre of attention . &quot;
&quot; actually , Jutta Br@@ eit wanted to get a dog . &quot;
&quot; this project had to push the 49 @-@ year @-@ old owner of Li@@ a Per@@ oni in the do@@ ve market arcade : finally , she now got an increase in the form of another business location . &quot;
&quot; in the Fur@@ la @-@ Shop opposite the shop in which they sold among other things bags , suit@@ cases , shoes and clothing of various manufacturers , all these bags of the brand Fur@@ la , wall@@ ets are now available from 75 euros . &quot;
larger bags and accessories cost up to € 500 .
the new shop has been in operation since yesterday .
&quot; previously , several weeks were rebuilt . &quot;
&quot; but I think that I should open a store for a long time , &quot; &quot; says Br@@ eit . &quot;
&quot; among other things , the decision was that also the Fur@@ la producers , who are at home in Bologna , from the idea of an own site where only their hand@@ bags were sold . &quot;
&quot; we are the only ones in the Greater Region of Linz , who sell this brand , &quot; says the mother of two daughters who himself has Italian roots . &quot;
her fashion interest has given birth to her mother in the cra@@ dle .
I am most interested when something developed and I can show new trends at affordable prices .
&quot; why so many women in the sight of a beautiful hand@@ bag in rap@@ ture , the professional woman can not answer with last security . &quot;
perhaps it is because a beautiful bag is enhanced every outfit .
the Br@@ ause P@@ jes@@ ac from K@@ all@@ stadt
the Pal@@ at@@ inate ancestors of Donald Tr@@ ump came from a place whose residents are called An@@ gi@@ ers .
this property also connects man@@ holes with the billi@@ on@@ aire who wants to become the US president .
Donald Tr@@ ump ( 69 ) is always good for excitement .
&quot; whether it mani@@ f@@ ests itself as hostile to foreign journalists , r@@ amm@@ ing journalists or revealing knowledge gaps in international crisis policies - the applicant for the US presidential office s@@ wir@@ ls the election campaign vigor@@ ously . &quot;
and cuts off well .
&quot; this is also registered in the Pal@@ at@@ inate K@@ all@@ stadt , where the grand@@ parents of the real estate billi@@ on@@ aire come from . &quot;
&quot; the New Yorker with the &quot; &quot; F@@ öhn@@ ungs@@ mall &quot; &quot; is a concept for many in the wine village on the wine road . &quot;
some in the 1200 @-@ inhabitants @-@ place is related to it over -@@ zig corners with it .
&quot; his grandfather came from K@@ all@@ stadt in the Pal@@ at@@ inate : Donald Tr@@ ump , here in campaign mode . &quot;
the K@@ all@@ städ@@ ter Simone Wen@@ del made a film about Tr@@ ump .
and what do the vill@@ agers think about his goal of becoming a mighty man in the world ?
&quot; I think they find that exciting , but are not so deeply impressed in their K@@ all@@ stad@@ ter type , &quot; &quot; says Simone Wen@@ del . &quot;
the native K@@ all@@ städ@@ ter has fil@@ med an am@@ using documentary about the place and his famous sp@@ rou@@ ts to which besides Tr@@ ump also the K@@ et@@ ch@@ up family Heinz counts .
&quot; Tr@@ ump , who is not known for mo@@ dest@@ y , is also a word in &quot; Kings of K@@ all@@ stadt &quot; ( 2014 ) - so with the statement that he would certainly be successful if he would live in K@@ all@@ stadt . &quot;
he did not bring it to the king of the hearts .
&quot; although there is respect for the family &apos;s performance , it also tends to think that Tr@@ ump is a bit &apos; w@@ alled &apos; , &quot; Wen@@ del says . &quot;
&quot; inci@@ dentally , the nick@@ name , the K@@ all@@ stadt in the circle , &quot; &quot; The Br@@ ings Me@@ et@@ ers &quot; &quot; - in High German : the don@@ ors , she says . &quot;
so Tr@@ ump comes from the village of the don@@ ors .
&quot; the Tr@@ ump &apos;s success story began 1885 , when the later grandfather emig@@ rated and opened a restaurant for gold dig@@ gers in the USA . &quot;
the foundation stone of the property group were first real estate purchases in New York .
&quot; but the life of grand@@ parents was not free of tragedy : their desire to return to the homeland for a long time , failed at the Bavarian State where the Pal@@ at@@ inate was at that time . &quot;
&quot; he did not record tr@@ ump because he was once without hom@@ olog@@ ation , the director of the Institute for Pal@@ at@@ inate History and Volk@@ sk@@ unde , Roland Paul , declared a film start . &quot;
&quot; Tr@@ ump is the grand@@ son of an &quot; illegal emig@@ rant . &quot; &quot;
this is in stark contrast to the sometimes striking say@@ ings of the desc@@ endant .
he had spoken repeatedly about Mexican immigrants in the US and called for the construction of a border wall to deter illegal immigrants .
&quot; just as it pol@@ lin@@ ates , this is not so li@@ ke@@ able , &quot; says Hans @-@ Joachim Ben@@ der , a distant relationship of Tr@@ umps ( &quot; The Grand@@ ma was a born Tr@@ ump , the Op@@ a was born Heinz &quot; ) . &quot;
&quot; the win@@ emaker in retirement sees the American rather dist@@ anced , &quot; he is always so up@@ lifting . &quot;
does he believe that Tr@@ ump is coming ?
&quot; I cannot imagine that , &quot; says the 72 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;
&quot; he never took care of K@@ all@@ stadt . &quot;
&quot; the pension vert@@ ine Ver@@ oni@@ ka Sch@@ ramm is mentioned as man@@ ger K@@ all@@ stad@@ ter , that a desc@@ endant of the Heinz family donated a little for the church organ , which was generally well anch@@ ored . &quot;
&quot; I cannot imagine this , &quot; says the 68 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;
&quot; it would be better if he did not want the election , for &quot; he has such radical views , I don &apos;t know if that is good . &quot;
&quot; if those who had the sa@@ ws at the time of his grandfather in the US would have been like him , &quot; &quot; he would never have arrived there . &quot;
&quot; there are more interesting topics than him , &quot; says Win@@ zer@@ ste@@ chter Sarah Büh@@ ler . &quot;
and as president ?
&quot; my president is not , &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; and : &quot; &quot; the grapes are ripe also without the President Tr@@ ump . &quot;
&quot; Wen@@ dels &apos;s film , for which Tr@@ ump was inter@@ viewed for a long time , have seen 12 000 cinem@@ at@@ ograph@@ ers , also in the USA watch the interest . &quot;
the Upper Bavarian community of Ram@@ sau with Ber@@ cht@@ es@@ g@@ aden is Germany &apos;s first &quot; mountain@@ eering village . &quot;
&quot; from the hand of the vice @-@ president at the German Alpine Club , Ludwig Wu@@ cher@@ pf@@ enni@@ g , the 1800 @-@ inhabitants village in the Ber@@ cht@@ es@@ g@@ aden National Park received the award for gentle tourism on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; in Austria , there are already 20 &quot; mountain clim@@ bers . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in the neighboring country , the local Alpine Club is responsible for awar@@ ding the award . &quot;
a &quot; mountain@@ eering village &quot; must have a maximum of 2500 inhabitants .
at least one fifth of its surface must be designated as a reserve area .
&quot; seven &apos;s Sun@@ rise domin@@ ates the reviews , despite attempts by N@@ ine to take over the loss of leadership at the Today Show &quot;
&quot; Karl Stef@@ an@@ ovic and Lisa Wil@@ kinson make ha@@ ste to Can@@ ber@@ ra to report on the loss of the leadership of the liber@@ als , but there has been no major shifts on the reviews for today . &quot;
the N@@ ine breakfast show was broadcast by the federal capital as Mal@@ col@@ m Turn@@ bull made the overthrow of Tony Ab@@ bot@@ t .
&quot; the Ri@@ val Sun@@ rise , with moder@@ ators David Koch and Sam@@ antha Ar@@ my@@ tage , joined London as part of a week @-@ long series of international television programs , including Dubai , New York , Ni@@ ag@@ ara Falls and Can@@ cu@@ n . &quot;
&quot; this dis@@ advantage of the board seemed to play no role for Australian TV viewers , as Sun@@ rise recorded an average of 39@@ 7,@@ 000 spectators at the five capitals compared with today 3@@ 39@@ ,000 . &quot;
&quot; today , a slight increase in ratings for Monday ( 3@@ 17@@ ,000 ) and last Tuesday ( 28@@ 3,000 ) , but its number remained behind the last Thursday ( 34@@ 3,000 ) . &quot;
today has closed the gap to Sun@@ rise in recent months .
&quot; in August , today , today reached an average of 3@@ 18@@ ,000 in comparison to the 330@@ ,000 of Sun@@ rise . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the year , the distance ran between 4@@ 0,000 and 50,000 . &quot;
&quot; up to now in September Sun@@ rise is at an average of 3@@ 49@@ ,000 viewers to 3@@ 14@@ ,000 in today . &quot;
this is the most interesting thing happening every morning .
the winds of change relate these morning people more than the Parliament !
&quot; Karl and Lisa are fine , thank you for the review ! &quot;

the big news for Seven was the impressive debut of 800 words with the former Seri@@ enst@@ ar von Pack@@ ed to the Raf@@ ters Erik Thom@@ son .
&quot; the new drama on a recently wit@@ ted father , who decides to settle down with his two children at the coast of New Zealand , reached a very impressive figure of 1,@@ 219 million viewers . &quot;
critics were wondering if Thom@@ son could carry a hit show solo without the Raf@@ ters Star Rebecca Gib@@ ney .
&quot; the result of yesterday evening answered this with a clear &quot; &quot; yes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the X @-@ Factor of Seven remained strong with 1.@@ 136 million spectators and hit The Block ( 8@@ 38@@ ,000 ) and T@@ BL Famili@@ es ( 7@@ 26@@ ,000 ) . &quot;
seven had mixed results in the evening two of The Ch@@ ase Australia .
&quot; the first half hour ( 17 : 00 to 17 : 30 ) of the new qui@@ z show , hosted by Andrew O &apos;@@ Ke@@ ef@@ e , presented an average of 4@@ 46@@ ,000 spectators . &quot;
&quot; the second half hour ( 17 : 30 to 18 : 00 ) j@@ umped on 6@@ 23@@ ,000 spectators - enough for a little victory over Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ires Hot @-@ Seat ( 6@@ 13@@ ,000 ) . &quot;
&quot; on Monday evening the first half hour of The Ch@@ ase Australia reached 5@@ 20,000 spectators and in the second half hour sat@@ te 7@@ 20,000 . &quot;
&quot; hot @-@ seat average 6@@ 20,000 . &quot;
the decline in the quot@@ as of the second evening of The Ch@@ ase Australia will be confident that hot @-@ seat will ultimately prevail at 17 : 30 .
the Ch@@ ase Australia is a replacement for a million dollars that did not manage to ski@@ p the Mc@@ Gu@@ ire show .

the last three agree : Bachelor &apos;s Sam Wood is the perfect man - but who will he choose ?
secret un@@ veiled ? ...
&quot; L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows , Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and Sne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki possibly have unknow@@ ingly revealing who wins the Bachelor &apos;s . &quot;
&quot; the woman , at which Sam Wood finally lands in The Bachelor , was envel@@ op@@ ed in the greatest sec@@ rec@@ y . &quot;
&quot; and none of the three remaining girls will certainly not reveal if she is the one , who has received the last rose . &quot;
&quot; but when we checked with Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay , Sne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki and L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows on the day before coming out of three , you might acci@@ dentally have given a hint about who will be the winner . &quot;
Sam Wood keeps his lips ti@@ ghtly sealed until the final on Thursday
&quot; all three women have om@@ itted in a ly@@ rical way why Wood is the perfect man and they called his sense of hum@@ our , ambition , family values and positive attitude as reasons why they would like to be his partner . &quot;
&quot; however , if the question is asked &quot; If not you , who should receive W@@ oods last rose ? &quot; their answers could become a game spoil , who won the heart of the bach@@ el@@ or . &quot;
Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows and Mark@@ os@@ ki knew both quickly - except themselves - M@@ ack@@ ay as the best partner for Wood .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and Sam Wood had a simple relationship with each other on the first day .
&quot; from the moment I went to the house and realized ( Sar@@ ahs ) and ams energies , I felt that they were pretty compatible and I thought that throughout the show , &quot; said Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows . &quot;
&quot; Sarah is standing on the ground with both feet , it &apos;s so much fun to be together with her , &quot; &quot; added Mark@@ os@@ ki . &quot;
&quot; I have seen them together , and they have the right chemistry . &quot;
they feel comfortable and comfortable with each other .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay believes that they and Sam Wood would be well suited as a couple .
&quot; from her point of view , M@@ ack@@ ay said that the visit to the house made her clear last week that Wood could be &quot; &quot; the One . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; as soon as I saw him with my friends and family , it became clear to me that this is obviously not just a game - I am now un@@ reserv@@ edly att@@ un@@ ed to him , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; and when she was asked whom Wood should choose , if not she , she was pu@@ zz@@ ling . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t know if I can say that , &quot; she said . &quot;
I love the remaining girls equally - it &apos;s a draw between Sne@@ z@@ ana and L@@ ana .
&quot; on Wednesday , 19 : 30 , the Bachelor is broad@@ cast@@ ed on Ten . &quot;
originally released as Sarah first choice for Sam Wood ?
Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne had several options to begin his N@@ FL career .
Detroit and Seattle showed great interest after moving to the USA - and there were many other teams who sent requests for his impressive open training day at the end of last year .
but Hay@@ ne chose San Francisco 49@@ ers and trainer Jim Tom@@ s@@ ula and it looks like a wise decision .
some trainers had ban@@ ished Hay@@ ne for the rest of the game on the bank when he lost a don@@ key as he did the Aus@@ sie @-@ Rugby division conver@@ ti@@ t at his first Pun@@ t @-@ Return on Tuesday at 20 @-@ 3 victory against Minn@@ es@@ ota .
but Tom@@ s@@ ula trusted his man and gave Hay@@ ne the next opportunity to return to a Pun@@ t return and also in the running game after a violation of Reg@@ gie Bush .
Tom@@ s@@ ula continues to show his true face in the changing cabin after the game .
&quot; instead of gr@@ ind his ro@@ ok@@ ies from the rest of the team through the mill , he encouraged them . &quot;
&quot; Tom@@ s@@ ula also strengthened Hay@@ ne publicly at his press conference after the game , too . &quot;
&quot; the 49@@ ers Sport@@ rep@@ orter Cam In@@ man reported that Hay@@ ne was also encouraged by special teams coordin@@ ator Thomas Mc@@ Gau@@ gh@@ ey , who advised him to forget his scrat@@ ched catch and take care of the next game . &quot;
&quot; Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne p@@ atz@@ t at a pun@@ t , which was restored in the first playing district of the Minn@@ es@@ ota Vi@@ kings &quot;
&quot; it was certainly not the start , the Hay@@ ne and his massive Australian spirit had hoped for his N@@ FL debut . &quot;
Hay@@ ne left the field after the F@@ um@@ ble and later told the Australian Radio duo Ham@@ ish &amp; Andy on 2@@ Day@@ FM 10@@ 4.1 that he couldn &apos;t imagine a worse start into his N@@ FL career .
&quot; that was a thing that happens now , you just take care of the next game , and that &apos;s it , &quot; Hay@@ ne said . &quot;
Hay@@ ne compared the car@@ ver with his Orig@@ in debut at that time in 2007 when a passport with his own in @-@ Go@@ al area led to a T@@ ry for Que@@ ens@@ land .
&quot; overall , it was a great experience for the 27 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; free voters demand the employment of 1,000 new teachers in Bavaria because of the high refugee figures . &quot;
&quot; at the start of the FW @-@ Herbst@@ kl@@ au@@ sur in Groß@@ wall@@ stadt , at the beginning of the FW @-@ Herbst@@ kl@@ au@@ sur in Groß@@ wall@@ stadt , when there is no corresponding new teacher for the many new students , &quot; we need at least 1000 additional teachers to preserve the schools before the collapse , &quot; said A@@ iw@@ anger . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , we will get pun@@ ish@@ ments in the Bavarian education system . &quot;
the day @-@ to @-@ day fraction of the free elec@@ torate conven@@ es until Friday in the Fran@@ con@@ ian commun@@ e .
&quot; in fact , altogether different main themes were planned . &quot;
but the record number of refugees is now also dominated by the free vote .
&quot; of course , the subject of asylum will over@@ lap the retreat , &quot; said A@@ iw@@ anger . &quot;
&quot; A@@ iw@@ anger demanded the establishment of UN Protection Are@@ as for Refu@@ ge@@ es in Syria , as existed during the Yugoslavia &apos;s war in the 1990s . &quot;
&quot; so it &apos;s not going on , we have to go to the causes , &quot; &quot; said the Free choice boss . &quot;
rejected asylum seek@@ ers want to push the Free voters as soon as possible .
&quot; therefore , A@@ iw@@ anger demanded more staff for the administrative courts responsible for asylum claims : &quot; we need at least 50 new asylum persons , &quot; said A@@ iw@@ anger . &quot;
&quot; the FW @-@ boss critic@@ ised that several federal states were not consistent : &quot; &quot; we needed nationwide uniform standards of the federal states . &quot;
&quot; Bavaria moves away , others do not . &quot;
&quot; we need to become more powerful . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; however , the regional policy in large @-@ wall capital should not fall under the table . &quot;
a long @-@ standing bur@@ ners remain on the agenda : the policy of education .
&quot; for the new school year , Kult@@ us@@ minister Ludwig Sp@@ a@@ en@@ le ( CS@@ U ) started the pilot study &quot; &quot; Mittel@@ stufe plus &quot; &quot; at 47 gram@@ mar schools . &quot;
but that is not far enough for A@@ iw@@ anger .
&quot; the topic G@@ 9 needs to be accelerated , &quot; said the FW @-@ boss . &quot;
we call for freedom of choice for all students who want to do that .
free ride at G@@ 9 wherever desired .

4 people killed after polic@@ emen shooting rubber bul@@ lets on prot@@ esters in Nepal
&quot; four people , including a 4 @-@ year @-@ old boy , were killed in Southern Nepal after the police shot rubber bul@@ lets against the proposed new constitution , a civil servant said on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; the violence broke out on Tuesday evening in the Rup@@ an@@ de@@ hi district , about 175 miles west of the capital Kath@@ mandu . &quot;
&quot; B@@ ish@@ n@@ u Pr@@ as@@ ad D@@ ha@@ kal , head of the District Apostle , said that more than 1,000 demonstr@@ ators had gathered outside of a police station , and some of them threw stones and fire bombs . &quot;
Mr D@@ ha@@ kal said the police have used tear gas and then shot in the air before moving on to rubber bul@@ lets .
&quot; 20 police officers and five civilians were injured , he said . &quot;
&quot; it was not immediately clear why the used rubber bul@@ lets , from which it is known that they can kill , which are traditionally used as a less deadly alternative , apparently produced such a high death rate . &quot;
&quot; the confrontation was the last in weeks of violent protests in Nepal &apos;s southern pl@@ ains , where members of the ethnic group of the M@@ ern@@ i say that new provinces , which are formed within the proposed new constitution , would reduce their political influence . &quot;
there were also protests in the Western Nepal by the ethnic group of Laz@@ arus who want their own state .
&quot; at least 40 people , including 11 Police Offic@@ ers , have been in violent confron@@ tations since the 10th . &quot;
&quot; killed when the four major political parties signed an agreement to divide the country into provinces - an important step towards a new constitution , but a very controversial subject in Nepal which has been governed centrally for centuries . &quot;
&quot; the work on a new constitution has been on the way since 2008 , but the law@@ makers accelerated the process after the devast@@ ating earthquake that killed thousands of people in April . &quot;
&quot; the legislat@@ ors voted in Kath@@ mandu over certain cl@@ auses this week , and officials said that the new constitution could enter into force on Sunday . &quot;
construction area planned in the city
the property at Em@@ my Youth Centre Alte Post is to be restored .
the city currently prepar@@ es everything for the marketing of the 4000 square meter area .
&quot; planning is a mix of trade , business and living - but there is still no concrete offer . &quot;
Em@@ den - Em@@ den - The city of Em@@ den intends to market some 4000 square meters of land in direct neighbourhood to the Youth Centre Alte Post .
the preparations for this are currently underway .
&quot; it is planned to use the terrain for a mix of trade , commercial and living . &quot;
&quot; waiting for appropriate offers , is said by the city . &quot;
which investor I receive is not yet clear .

project H@@ ieve : details are on the table

now the plans for a new holiday settlement at the Little Sea close to Em@@ den on the table .
&quot; the interests , the medium @-@ sized emblem of the company &quot; System @-@ Bau , &quot; presented its plans for the first time on Monday evening in the Regional Development Committee of the Em@@ de Council . &quot;
&quot; originally , this point had been on the non @-@ public part of the agenda . &quot;
&quot; under the pressure of the project critics and the F@@ DP parliamentary group , leading to investors and administration , Ralf Behr@@ ends went to the offensive : &quot; &quot; we have not yet answered all questions , &quot; &quot; he said in front of the Council members and more than 50 visitors . &quot;
but it is good to meet all rum@@ ours now .
the project has been around ten to twelve million euros for months in the discussion .
&quot; hef@@ ty reactions among hor@@ se@@ ful owners , who had come to the meeting , called forth the pictures and new details about the desired hotel building . &quot;
&quot; Roberto Schulz , owner of the sea owner and board member in the representation of the An@@ lieg@@ er , Pro H@@ ieve , compl@@ ains : &quot; this is a huge cl@@ ot@@ ch that domin@@ ates all the other buildings . &quot;
&quot; he also fears as many other project critics , that traffic by the intended size of the plant would greatly increase : &quot; &quot; all bus charges must come so that it pays off , &quot; &quot; says Schulz &quot;
&quot; what happens exactly on the well @-@ a @-@ hect@@ are site of the former restaurant , is still open . &quot;
there is still no operator .
&quot; first we have to have a coher@@ ent concept , &quot; &quot; said Ralf Behr@@ ends . &quot;
&quot; because this still lack@@ ed , the cultivation plans are still variable . &quot;

Google has an un@@ usually personal approach to announ@@ cing the donation request on his blog .
&quot; instead of letting a manager make the announcement , Rita Mas@@ oud , a Google associate , who fled with her family from Kab@@ ul , when she was seven years old , wrote about her personal experiences . &quot;
&quot; our journey included many dark train and bus trips , as well as hunger , thirst , cold and fear , &quot; she wrote . &quot;
I was lucky .
&quot; but since the refugee and migrant crisis has grown in Europe , many people like my family are des@@ perate for help . &quot;
&quot; the donations go to four char@@ itable organisations providing assistance to refugees and migrants : doctors Without Bor@@ ders , International Res@@ cue Committee , Save the Children and UN High Commissioner for Refu@@ ge@@ es . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; Europe is faced with its worst refugee crisis since the Second World War , largely caused by the four @-@ year civil war in Syria , which has driven more than 4 million people this year . &quot;

reporting from Y@@ as@@ me@@ en Ab@@ ut@@ al@@ eb ; edited by Christian Pl@@ umb
&quot; for slightly over@@ weight di@@ abe@@ tics , weight loss surgery can be helpful . &quot;
the benefits of weight loss surgery for easily over@@ weight people with type 2 diabetes can last at least five years after a new study .
it is still too early to tell if easily over@@ weight people with diabetes after losing weight loss surgery live longer than those who receive non @-@ surgical treatments .
&quot; the mort@@ ality data require a long time to show something , &quot; said Dr. Robin Black@@ stone , an expert in weight loss surgery , which wrote an editorial to the new study in J@@ AMA Surgery . &quot;
&quot; weight loss surgery or obesity surgery , use different methods to shr@@ ink the size of the stomach . &quot;
they reduce hunger and limit the body &apos;s ability to take food .
&quot; over the years , obesity operations have proven to be efficient for the treatment of type 2 diabetes , but most studies have been carried out in people who are ab@@ normal with a Body Mass Index ( BM@@ I ) of 35 or higher . &quot;
&quot; BM@@ I , a certain amount of weight in terms of size , is considered normal between 18.@@ 5 and 24.@@ 9 . &quot;
a BM@@ I of 25 or more indicates that someone is over@@ weight and people with a BM@@ I over 30 are considered o@@ bes@@ e .
you can calculate your BM@@ I here : 1.@@ us@@ a.@@ gov / 1@@ D@@ 0@@ Z@@ q@@ D@@ v .
&quot; for the new study , researchers from Tai@@ wan@@ ese Min @-@ Sh@@ eng General Hospital data which they have been collected in a study since 2007 and compare two types of obesity - gast@@ ric b@@ ypass and stomach pain - to medical treatments for type 2 diabetes in people who were easily over@@ weight . &quot;
&quot; the average BM@@ I , among those under@@ going this operation , fell from 31 to 24.@@ 5 to the end of the fifth year in this study . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , the BM@@ I stayed with those who received non @-@ surgical diabetes treatments approximately equal to 29 . &quot;
&quot; among those who undergo a surgical procedure , 36 % of the diabetes @-@ disease dissolved completely and at 28 % in part . &quot;
&quot; compared with diabetes , the medi@@ cally treated group only dissolved in one percent and partly at only about two percent . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the results of the blood pressure , tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des and the &quot; bad &quot; L@@ DL Cholester@@ ins were generally better in the &quot; surgical &quot; group , &quot; the authors found out . &quot;
&quot; the researchers also monitored the patient blood level of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c , which reflects the blood sugar levels over time . &quot;
&quot; ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c is best kept under 7 percent , write the researchers . &quot;
&quot; after the operation , the average hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c decreased from around 9 percent to around 6 percent . &quot;
&quot; in the medical therapy group , however , it remained stable at around 8 percent . &quot;
&quot; but this better &quot; gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control &quot; - as reflected in the improved hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c level - did not decrease mort@@ ality in five years , so the leading researcher Dr Chi@@ h @-@ Ch@@ eng H@@ su and his colleagues . &quot;
the research team also toler@@ ated average results in the two types of surgery .
&quot; in the fifth year , the b@@ ypass surgery group lost more weight compared to the gast@@ ric tom@@ y group ( 18.@@ 7 vs. 14.@@ 2 kg ) , achieved higher returns in BM@@ I ( 7.4 versus 5.1 % ) and ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c ( 3.1 % vs. 2.1 % ) and rather recorded a complete over@@ coming of diabetes ( 46.@@ 9 % vs. 16.@@ 7 % ) . &quot;
&quot; while the new study does not show survival benefit after five years , there are clu@@ es from a study of he@@ avier people in Sweden that surgery leads to a longer life , says Black@@ stone from the University of Arizona , College of Medicine Phoenix . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; although the new study showed no advantage for survival in the surgery patients , Black@@ stone said it was so@@ othing for persons with a BM@@ I under 35 who are interested in the procedure . &quot;
&quot; this is the critical point of this study because it says that this operation in this lower BM@@ I group is lower , &quot; without increased risk of death or kidney disease , she said . &quot;
&quot; Black@@ stone added that people and their doctors should start taking weight seriously , as soon as the patient lies with his BM@@ I between 27 and 30 . &quot;
&quot; I think we are waiting too long until we bring people to take this seriously , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; I think , once they have accumulated these genetic changes that have firmly attached their bodies to obesity and diabetes , a revers@@ al is really difficult . &quot;
love story plays in the H@@ uns@@ rück
&quot; it is a theme that is currently increasingly taking into consideration in fiction : a young woman , un@@ popular at school times and un@@ si@@ ghtly , meets the flock of her youth after years , and he falls in love with her . &quot;
&quot; so also in the recently published novel &quot; &quot; Ac@@ tu@@ ally , we are not so &quot; &quot; by Lu@@ isa Bin@@ der . &quot;
&quot; beyond the love story , the novel might be interesting especially for H@@ uns@@ rück readers , because he plays in Lang@@ weiler and the surrounding villages . &quot;
the main professional author has grown up in Lang@@ weiler and is pleased that she was able to put a literary monument to her hom@@ etown .
&quot; it is impossible for everyone to come to Europe &quot; - Dalai Lama - RT @-@ News
&quot; Europe cannot accommodate all refugees , said the Dalai Lama and added that the real solution of the refugee crisis in the Middle East is lying . &quot;
the Tibetan Buddhist leader urged the end to end violence in the hom@@ el@@ ands of refugees .
the Dalai Lama addressed the problem of the ongoing refugee crisis at the beginning of his ten @-@ day visit to the United Kingdom in his speech on the occasion of the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Comp@@ as@@ sion in Oxford focusing on eth@@ ic studies .
he demanded that under the circumstances the interests of humanity should be placed before the interests of the individual nations or even continents .
&quot; he also stressed that the reaction of Western European countries to the refugee crisis is ad@@ mi@@ red , but the situation is not appropriate . &quot;
&quot; it is impossible that everyone can come to Europe , &quot; he said in his speech . &quot;
&quot; although the Dalai Lama promised Germany and Austria &apos;s efforts to cope with the crisis , he stressed that it was only a temporary solution . &quot;
&quot; to take care of several thousand refugees is wonderful , but in the meantime you have to think about long @-@ term solutions such as a true peace and genuine development , mainly through education , for these Muslim countries , &quot; he emphas@@ ised . &quot;
&quot; in the end , we have to think about how killing in their countries is reduced . &quot;
we must reduce the use of violence .
&quot; the use of force has never solved these problems , &quot; he added . &quot;
the Dalai Lama spoke to the problem of violence and commented George Bush &apos;s actions after the terrorist attack on September 11 and turned out that the violent reaction of the US pulled a chain of un@@ controll@@ able events .
&quot; after September 11 , I expressed my con@@ dol@@ ences in a letter to President Bush , and I told him the way to solve this problem lies in non@@ violence . &quot;
&quot; I know his motives were good , but he made violence , and that caused unexpected consequences , &quot; &quot; said the Dalai Lama . &quot;
four@@ fold increase of hand san@@ iti@@ zer intake by children in the last 4 years
&quot; po@@ ison control centers in the US report on an almost 400 @-@ percent increase in the number of children under 12 years , which swal@@ low strongly alcoholic hand dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants , such as Georgia Po@@ ison Center . &quot;
&quot; according to Dr. Gay@@ lord Lop@@ ez , director of the Georgia Po@@ ison Center , the cases of inf@@ ectious agents in children under 12 were reported to report the poison@@ ing centers , from 3,@@ 266 in 2010 to 16.@@ 117 in 2014 . &quot;
&quot; children are increasingly coming to these products , and unfortunately a percentage of them lands in emergency room , &quot; said Lop@@ ez CN@@ N . &quot;
&quot; he said that some children des@@ inf@@ ect@@ ant drink inten@@ tionally , while some do it to impress their friends or because of a mut@@ ation in social media . &quot;
videos on YouTube show how young dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants can only drink because of a cheap experience .
te@@ ens have allegedly bl@@ ended dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ant with alcoholic mouth@@ wash to get a harder drink .
younger children can be attracted by attractive sc@@ ents of dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants .
&quot; a child doesn &apos;t think that this is bad for it , &quot; &quot; said Lop@@ ez . &quot;
many of the more attractive ( hand dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants ) are those that are perf@@ um@@ ed .
&quot; there are dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants with straw@@ berry , grapes and or@@ an@@ ges that are very appealing to children . &quot;
hand dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants contain between 45 and 95 percent alcohol .
&quot; especially for inf@@ ants , few sy@@ ring@@ es can lead to alcohol in@@ toxic@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; it is highly concentrated alcohol , &quot; said Dr. Stephen Thor@@ n@@ ton , medical director of the Tox@@ ic@@ ology Centre at the University of K@@ ans@@ as , the Fox 4 station in kan@@ sa City . &quot;
&quot; so , you wouldn &apos;t let slip whis@@ ky around , but people leave these hand dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants within reach of children , and when children come to it , then it is a quick way to consume lots of alcohol . &quot;
&quot; N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah Russell , a six @-@ year @-@ old girl , recently taken four sy@@ ring@@ es from straw@@ berry frag@@ rant san@@ iti@@ zer at school , was taken into an emergency room for treatment . &quot;
&quot; her blood alcohol concentration was 179 , twice higher than the threshold , which is legally associated with an adult , said Dr. Chris R@@ IT@@ CHE@@ Y , a emergency doctor who treated them at G@@ winn@@ ett Medical Center outside of Atlanta . &quot;
&quot; N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah l@@ all@@ te her words and was unable to go , when she arrived in the emergency room . &quot;
&quot; doctors monitored them overnight in a separate children &apos;s hospital on signs of brain trau@@ ma , as the girl had fallen through alcohol and hit his head , said R@@ IT@@ CHE@@ Y . &quot;
&quot; this was very sc@@ ary , &quot; &quot; said Ort@@ oria Scott , N@@ ha@@ i@@ j@@ ahs Mother , CN@@ N . &quot;
it could have been fatal for my child .
Lop@@ ez has recommended parents and teachers to use alcohol @-@ free products or dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants and to store hands @-@ on dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants out of the reach of the child .
&quot; in addition to alcohol in@@ toxic@@ ation , some dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants were associated with deaths . &quot;
&quot; in 2013 , two women in Ontario died after the swal@@ lowing of hand dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants which contained a toxic , un@@ declared ingredient . &quot;
&quot; health authorities susp@@ ect that the product contained meth@@ anol , a deadly solution instead of eth@@ yl alcohol , which was listed as active ingredient . &quot;
&quot; in January , three students of the fourth grade in the State of New York planned to po@@ ison their &quot; gem@@ s &quot; teacher by placing anti@@ bacterial products around the classroom , &quot; reports a police report . &quot;
the teacher is highly allergic to hand dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants and ex@@ iled them out of their room .
&quot; the police considered the ins@@ ulated plan as &quot; &quot; speed &quot; &quot; and rejected disciplinary action to the school authority . &quot;
Vil@@ lingen @-@ Schwen@@ n@@ ingen : three vehicles damaged
&quot; at a rear end of the cross @-@ sp@@ ange between Nordr@@ ing and On Her@@ den , a 33 @-@ year @-@ old car driver has been injured at a rear end . &quot;
a 60 @-@ year truck driver drove towards the round@@ about towards the industrial area and arrived late that two preceding vehicles had stopped at the round@@ about .
&quot; as a result , he crashed into the rear of an audi@@ tor with his truck and pushed this vehicle to a previously standing Ford Fi@@ esta . &quot;
&quot; at the accidents involved in the accident , property damage was about 10 000 euros , divi@@ des the police . &quot;

&quot; I don &apos;t think we feel under pressure , I think the players are looking forward to it . &quot;
the lack of title competition in Scottish football bored Dut@@ ch@@ man - de Bo@@ er
former Rang@@ ers mid@@ field player and former national player of the Netherlands Ronald de Bo@@ er said that Dutch football fans have lost interest in Celtic because there is no title ri@@ val@@ ry with the Rang@@ ers .
&quot; he is currently an ambassador for Ajax , said : &quot; in Holland they don &apos;t show highlights of Celtic games any more and why ? &quot;
it &apos;s because the Rang@@ ers aren &apos;t there .
people here don &apos;t just talk about the return of the Rang@@ ers .
they speak about the Old Firm .
they talk about both teams and that is what they are interested in .
&quot; there is a lot of excitement in the Old @-@ Firm @-@ games , and there are not only the people in Scotland who want to see these games . &quot;
&quot; I will turn things around , swe@@ ars Dei@@ la . &quot;
&quot; R@@ onn@@ y Dei@@ la accepted that Celtic needs to fight , but the Norwegian boss s@@ wore to turn things around . &quot;
&quot; after the defeat against Malm@@ ö and the subsequent departure from the Champions League , the defeat against 10 @-@ man from Aber@@ deen , who now reached the top of the table with five points . &quot;
&quot; but Dei@@ la said , &quot; &quot; Celtic had bad times before , and we will come back . &quot;
now we want to come out as soon as possible .
&quot; I know it &apos;s very frustr@@ ating and a lot of people are very , very angry or sad about what happens . &quot;
we feel the same - but we have to go on .
&quot; we really need Celtic &apos;s support , because that makes the players better . &quot;
working together is so important .

unemployment in Scotland remains unchanged while in the UK .
&quot; unemployment in Scotland remained unchanged in the period of May to July at 16@@ 4,000 , while the number of people without work for the United Kingdom as a whole rose to 1.@@ 82 million in the same period . &quot;
&quot; Scotland &apos;s unemployment rate of 5.@@ 9 percent was above that of the U@@ K@@ s of 5.5 percent , as indicated by the figures of the National Statistical Office ( ONS ) offices . &quot;
&quot; in the meantime , employment in Scotland fell by 12@@ ,000 during the three months , with the number of employees now at 2.6@@ 12@@ .000 . &quot;
&quot; in the course of the quarter , the employment rate for Scotland fell to 7@@ 4.0 percent - a figure above the UK average of 7@@ 3.5 percent . &quot;
&quot; the Secretary of State for Scotland David Mund@@ el commented on the latest figures and said : &quot; &quot; the long @-@ term plan of the government has laid the foundation for a stronger economy . &quot;
it is almost exactly one year ago that Scotland has made the historic decision to remain part of the United Kingdom .

&quot; when it happens , and I hope that it does not happen I will sit in a spect@@ ator gallery in the O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma State Pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary , when Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ p is executed by the po@@ ison @-@ sy@@ ringe . &quot;
he asked me to be one of the four official witnesses at his death .
&quot; the invitation took place for the first time in January about his best friend , and although I was sho@@ cked I agreed . &quot;
&quot; when the day drew near , I began to fear . &quot;
so why should I do it ?
&quot; I agreed , because I thought it would be a good way to tell the whole story about the death penalty . &quot;
it would offer a unique perspective .
&quot; it is true that journalists are allowed to see exec@@ utions in the United States , and there are often more applications available as places , a lean lot@@ tery will take place to decide who is elected . &quot;
O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma reduced the number of media sites from 12 to five .
&quot; who is selected , who will observe it emotion@@ ally . &quot;
_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _
I will sit next to Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ ps closest friend with whom I have developed my own relationship over the months with phone calls and a two and a half hours visit .
I like the guy .
we often laugh a lot when we speak .
&quot; the prison authorities say that I cannot be a witness and a journalist , so I will not be allowed to take a not@@ ebook and a pen to record what I see . &quot;
I just have to try to remember all the details .
a journalist from O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma accused me on Twitter to give up my im@@ parti@@ ality .
here is the lesson .
tell the story of the prisoner as he wants and you get access .
I compl@@ ain with her .
&quot; she admitted that she could &quot; &quot; could have form@@ ulate it better &quot; , &quot; but she still thinks that it &apos;s wrong what I do . &quot;
Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ p had a problem with some of the things I said and wrote .
&quot; he tells me not what I have to write , and I wouldn &apos;t do it even if he would do it . &quot;
I told him that he can remove me from his list of witnesses at any time .
but he wants an international rep@@ orter is present to write there .
&quot; when he dies , he thinks that the public relations work will help against the death penalty . &quot;
&quot; Kim Bell@@ ware , a rep@@ orter of Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post , will sit next to me . &quot;
&quot; if you want to know more about the case , please listen to the series of pod@@ casts I made . &quot;
I don &apos;t want to go back to all details here .
I cannot say with certainty that Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ p is innocent .
his actions after the assass@@ ination of Barry Van Tre@@ ese would blame him to be a benef@@ ici@@ ary of action .
but I believe that there is a strong lik@@ el@@ ihood that he is not guilty .
I believe that there is not enough evidence to justify a death sentence .
I believe that his execution is false .
and from this perspective I will see him dying .
I cannot claim to be really objective .
there will be other rep@@ or@@ ters that you can turn to .
what you will get from me is what it means to die a man die unnecessary death .
man after dam@@ p police ch@@ ase persu@@ ades to get out of the C@@ anning River
the C@@ anning V@@ ale polic@@ eman stayed dry when he talked to the man of the C@@ anning River .
&quot; an attempt by a man of Per@@ th to hang out the police was un@@ successful when he was in shallow and sw@@ amp@@ y waters , only a few meters away from a police officer who tried to persu@@ ade him to return to the shore . &quot;
the police force of C@@ anning V@@ ale was established on Tuesday to a house peac@@ ekeeping in Beck@@ en@@ ham .
&quot; when they discovered the susp@@ ect , he tried to escape to C@@ anning River . &quot;
but he did not come too far .
&quot; he stood in water and said &apos; I &apos;m not coming out , come and get me , &quot; &quot; said senior Serge@@ ant S@@ hand@@ ell Cast@@ led@@ ine . &quot;
&quot; Con@@ stable Lach@@ lan Per@@ pet@@ c was not too enthusiastic about making his uniform wet , so he applied a more reliable tac@@ tic - &quot; A good polic@@ eman is negoti@@ ating . &quot;
&quot; sometimes people do funny things to try to escape , &quot; said senior Serge@@ ant Cast@@ led@@ ine . &quot;
&quot; team of champ@@ ionships , Ben C@@ ous@@ ins , offers an unforgettable example . &quot;
in 2006 C@@ ous@@ ins drove his car into the dit@@ ch to avoid alcohol control and then tried to swim over the S@@ wan River .
his efforts were un@@ successful but inspired locals to the hum@@ orous planning of a Ben C@@ ous@@ ins bi@@ athlon .
Peter Moo@@ dy claims that ste@@ wards tried to spy on him and threat@@ ens to end racing
Peter Moo@@ dy claims that ste@@ wards from Racing Victoria tried to install a spy in his st@@ ables last year and threatened to finish the race immediately .
&quot; he pointed to the ste@@ wards and the integrity department of Racing Victoria , claim@@ ing that they conducted a personal campaign against him with the L@@ ate S@@ cr@@ at@@ ching of Lady Tat@@ ai for a race day treatment , the last straw on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; Moo@@ dy said Fair@@ fax Media , that he always tried to do what is best for racing and he found himself in difficult conditions when it was about the positive cob@@ alt t@@ up sample at Li@@ dar@@ i , which he cannot explain . &quot;
he had kept back 18 months because of the es@@ pion@@ age alleg@@ ations and did not want it to &quot; look like too high hanging grapes . &quot;
&quot; I had nothing to say about it , and I have been eating a long time , but sometimes you are so frustr@@ ated that everything comes out at once , &quot; &quot; says Moo@@ dy . &quot;
they know that it went on .
sometimes you react and you have to live with the consequences and I have to live with what I said .
I will go home tonight and sleep well .
&quot; I want to change my head , and I want my owners to think that I do my best for them . &quot;
&quot; if they start thinking , I don &apos;t do that , then I should not be a coach . &quot;
I have to consider what I do with my license .
Moo@@ dy had previously made the bomb in an interview with rac@@ ing.com that the Integr@@ ity Department had tried to spy on his stable .
&quot; eighte@@ en months ago Ter@@ ry Bail@@ ey , Day@@ le Brown and Dr. Brian Ste@@ wart were sitting in a room with a man - whom I &apos;m going to call - and offered him a job in my st@@ ables to provide information about what I do inside my st@@ ables , &quot; &quot; says Moo@@ dy on rac@@ ing.com . &quot;
they seem to believe that I am a dec@@ ei@@ ver .
&quot; if this is the case , they should certainly believe in their n@@ oses , because they have failed to grasp me . &quot;
&quot; Robert Rou@@ l@@ ston , former Chairman of Route L , David Moo@@ dy , President of Route L and Bernard Sa@@ undry , the current CEO of RV@@ L , were aware of this at the time and are still today . &quot;
should this be my opinion that it will be personal ?
is the RV@@ L behave co@@ war@@ dly and perhaps makes people outside trainers responsible for what &apos;s going on in the industry ?
am I bad for the industry ?
am I so bad for the industry ?
maybe people are thinking outside that I am .
&quot; perhaps they have to take my license and viol@@ ate me , and I have no doubt that what I say they can now think about it . &quot;
&quot; but I have arrived at the point where it doesn &apos;t matter , and that makes me sad . &quot;
that makes me really sad .
I will exercise pressure on them and urge them to make a decision .
I have the support of my family and I can go .
&quot; the train@@ ee &apos;s fru@@ stration levels have set up with the long @-@ lasting cob@@ alt examination at Li@@ dar@@ i , and the L@@ ate S@@ cr@@ at@@ ching performed that he said he could &quot; throw his license over the table . &quot;
&quot; Moo@@ dy , best known for his preparation of the un@@ defeated Master Black Caviar , described the race day treatment rule &quot; ridi@@ culous , &quot; after a pack of mud or clay was applied to the horse debate , which viol@@ ated the rules . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is against the rules of racing . &quot;
&quot; I have to take full responsibility for this , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; one of my colleagues has mistakenly applied mud to the leg .
it could have been so last night .
it could have been so yesterday the whole day as it was .
but it was also so on the day of the race .
Moo@@ dy could be confronted with a three @-@ month dis@@ qualification for the treatment with the pack at the race day . an investigation of this matter was opened .
it is a joke .
people who set up these rules know nothing about the horse .
&quot; we all see that we need rules , but here you have to go too far , &quot; &quot; says Moo@@ dy . &quot;
man arrested for driver acc@@ urs@@ ed

Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Cra@@ ig Bell@@ amy turns against Ri@@ val due to claims on Ring@@ tones
Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Cra@@ ig Bell@@ amy has critic@@ ised the tac@@ kling of his players as &quot; Agenda @-@ Set@@ ting &quot; by two Premier League favor@@ ites of the N@@ RL .
Sydney Roo@@ sters Trainer Tr@@ ent Robinson said that the ump@@ ires have allowed the Storm @-@ Players &quot; Ring fighting &quot; with his team during the high @-@ end victory in Sydney on Friday evening .
Bris@@ bane Bron@@ cos Trainer Way@@ ne Benn@@ ett made a barely conce@@ aled comment on the Storm team after his team had achieved the final victory against North Que@@ ens@@ land Cow@@ boys on Saturday evening . he called the game a &quot; sample example &quot; of the rug@@ by League and said that the two from Que@@ ens@@ land were not too good in rings .
&quot; Bell@@ amy defended the fli@@ ck@@ fire of his team and said that at Tac@@ kling , they were concentr@@ ating only on their &quot; contact . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; it always appears - I haven &apos;t heard that Tr@@ ent Robinson spoke about ring struggles when they hit us 24 : 2 , &quot; &quot; said Bell@@ amy on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; I can guarantee that we haven &apos;t changed anything about our defensive system or techniques throughout the year . but over the past six weeks we have made our contact with Tac@@ kles a real focus , and this has provided the turn@@ around for us . &quot;
&quot; Tr@@ ent has been there for three years and obviously has a great team to train . so he &apos;s probably not acc@@ u@@ stom@@ ed to losing it , so it was a bit shock for him . &quot;
&quot; it is already funny , as it appears again and again at this time of the year . &quot;
&quot; Bell@@ amy has attacked Benn@@ etts idea of &quot; &quot; exciting football &quot; &quot; and reminds his ment@@ or that Benn@@ etts St George Il@@ la@@ war@@ ra Dragons won the Premier League in 2010 with &quot; &quot; boring &quot; &quot; football . &quot;
Way@@ ne speaks of exciting football .
&quot; he compared his game on Saturday evening with our Friday evening and how exciting their game was , &quot; &quot; said Bell@@ amy . &quot;
&quot; I remember that in 2010 St George was critic@@ ised as a te@@ di@@ ous team , and Way@@ ne said he will take care of a shooting . &quot;
&quot; but now he has a team that can play and which we consider as exciting , especially his young players with their speed . &quot;
this is the ball game you want to play when you have this kind of players .
&quot; he made this statement in 2010 , now he wants to play all his kind of football - not every team has two players such as Anthony Mil@@ ford and Ben Hun@@ t , so they can play like these . &quot;
&quot; I build stronger confidence because they say these things , because they are a bit worried against us to play against us . &quot;
&quot; six weeks ago , they did not think of us when it was about the Big Games . &quot;
Bell@@ amy also pointed out that the Storm vs. Roo@@ ster game achieved higher result than the game of Bron@@ cos against cow@@ boys .
&quot; the game of the Bron@@ cos was probably a good game , I haven &apos;t seen it yet , but what was the result ? 16 : 12 ? &quot;
&quot; our game was 20 : 18 , there were two more trials in our game , but is that an exciting game ? &quot;
or are breaks do and don &apos;t have any points any ten@@ sion@@ ing ?
for me it is the game plans .
&quot; when they mention us , it means we will meet them in one phase . &quot;
&quot; the Storm Team released this weekend , as they won the right to receive either North Que@@ ens@@ land Cow@@ boys or C@@ ron@@ ul@@ la Shar@@ ks on Saturday evening in the A@@ AM@@ I park . ticket sales begin next Tuesday morning . &quot;
&quot; Ser@@ bier with 200,000 $ damage deposit to drug ad@@ diction &quot;
&quot; a man who may be threatened with a life @-@ long sentence because of his attempt to get into possession of 40 kil@@ ograms of co@@ ca@@ ine , who were smu@@ g@@ gl@@ ed to Que@@ ens@@ land , was released against a $ 200,000 deposit . &quot;
&quot; Mark@@ o Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c , 29 , was one of the five men who were arrested last month after the federal police found 100 kil@@ os of the drug on the yacht Sol@@ ay that came from South America via Van@@ u@@ atu and arrived in August in Co@@ om@@ era . &quot;
&quot; Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c was observed how he met his co @-@ def@@ endants in the marina during the morning and later in the Café Co@@ om@@ era Road@@ house , where the police found 40 kil@@ ograms of the drug in a Toyota Echo . &quot;
&quot; despite a potentially li@@ fel@@ ong penalty for trying to possess a commercial amount of co@@ ca@@ ine , the lawyer of Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c argued that there was no evidence that he tried to possess the whole amount and that in the cafe could have been out of a harmless reason . &quot;
&quot; the judge at the Supreme Court , Peter Flan@@ agan , was worried about the danger of escape with Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c . &quot;
he has clear relations with Serbia .
&quot; he often travels to Serbia , &quot; he explained to the court on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; in the case of a criminal case , he lied to the police about his residence . &quot;
&quot; Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c &apos;s mother and step@@ father had offered a security deposit of 200,000 dollars for safety together to reach his release . &quot;
&quot; after reading the aff@@ id@@ av@@ al declar@@ ations of the two persons , it is clear that the circulation of a security of 200,000 dollars is a real financial burden , &quot; &quot; said Ju@@ dge Flan@@ agan . &quot;
&quot; but that alone will not suff@@ ice to prevent him from appearing , he warned . &quot;
&quot; Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c was released against deposit , under the conditions that he ab@@ stain@@ ed from his Australian and Serbian passport , reported daily to the police and stops at a cur@@ few from 18 : 00 @-@ 06 : 00 . &quot;
accident on A5 near Karlsruhe : driver &apos;s house tears apart
&quot; at a rear end with three trucks on the highway 5 near Karlsruhe , a truck driver was severely injured on Tuesday evening . &quot;
two of the three trucks involved had brakes before a permanent building in the direction of Basel .
&quot; the third driver noticed it too late and in vain , trying to turn left at the last moment , as the police ha@@ sten@@ ed . &quot;
the driver &apos;s cab of the accident @-@ causing tear falls completely apart .
the driver was seriously injured in a hospital .
the A5 between Bru@@ chs@@ al and Karlsruhe @-@ Nord was completely closed for six hours until 2 am .
&quot; there was a damage in the amount of € 12@@ 2,000 . &quot;
St@@ ev@@ an H@@ og@@ g used telephone of girls to attract P@@ äd@@ oph@@ ile to send pictures
a ped@@ op@@ hil@@ ator used the phone of a 11 year old girl to ask for pictures of child abuse .
&quot; St@@ ev@@ an H@@ og@@ g took the girl &apos;s phone , as this slept , log@@ ged into an online mess@@ aging service , from which he received a number of un@@ decent pictures of children who were sent to him by another user . &quot;
the girl wo@@ ke up later and discovered that the phone was missing and found it in the hand of the sleeping dog .
&quot; she saw it through , found the conf@@ using messages and immediately aler@@ ted her mother . &quot;
&quot; the police took care of it and looked at the five images , then analyzed computers that were found under the address and discovered &quot; &quot; relevant &quot; &quot; web research , which used terms for searching for non @-@ decent images of children . &quot;
&quot; H@@ og@@ g then claimed to the officials that he did it , as it would lead to &quot; P@@ äd@@ oph@@ ile on the Internet &quot; and he then &quot; pre@@ tended to be a polic@@ eman to fri@@ ghten them . &quot;
&quot; the prosec@@ utor of E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Rober@@ ts@@ on told Dun@@ dee Sh@@ eri@@ ff Court : &quot; he said it would be a ad@@ diction , - that he was ad@@ dic@@ ted to fri@@ ghten people . &quot;
&quot; he admitted that the searches on the computer were carried out by him , but said it was done because he wanted to pret@@ end to be a polic@@ eman to fri@@ ghten P@@ äd@@ oph@@ ile . &quot;
he was asked for his talks with the unknown person who sent him the pictures and he asked him to send even more photos .
he said he did it to l@@ ure her .
&quot; he said he was sick in his head when he drinks , and said he wanted to see images of rape and murder . &quot;
&quot; MS Rober@@ ts@@ on added : &quot; when the girl found the news on the phone , she called her mother and was on trem@@ bling and crying . &quot;
she then saw the in@@ consistent pictures on the phone and confronted the def@@ endants with it .
the girl was inter@@ viewed and said that the accused computer and Play@@ station used to speak to girls who looked much younger than him .
&quot; H@@ og@@ g , 23 , W@@ ard Road , Dun@@ dee , ple@@ aded guilty in the sense of the indictment , to have received irre@@ pres@@ sible pictures of children on the 14th of June last year , to viol@@ ate the conditions of the indictment on 25 January of this year and not before the Tribunal at a hearing on March 24 of this year . &quot;
&quot; counsel Gregor S@@ im asked that H@@ og@@ g did not appear in the register of sexual offen@@ ders , as one could argue that &quot; no significant sexual element &quot; may be found in his crime . &quot;
Sh@@ eri@@ ff Ali@@ st@@ air Car@@ mi@@ ch@@ ael postpon@@ ed the verdi@@ ct until October to obtain background reports on social work .
&quot; H@@ og@@ g was granted a deposit in this case , but was held in custo@@ dy for hear@@ ings to other cases pending . &quot;
he was still taken up before the date of the judgment into the list of sexual offen@@ ders .
Schle@@ user switches to Germany on small border cross@@ ings
more and more refugees are picked up at the German @-@ Austrian border aside from the wholesale control points .
many of the smu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers caused by fear of discovery and arrest the people increased at smaller border cross@@ ings
&quot; on the Austrian side , a spokes@@ man of the Federal Police said . &quot;
&quot; along the river river Inn in Pass@@ au and Rot@@ tal @-@ Inn , more than 1000 refugees have been taken up in the districts of Pass@@ au and Rot@@ tal @-@ Inn . &quot;
they were on foot over bridges and rif@@ les to the German side .
there they are received by federal police and for@@ warded to registration .

&quot; Stuttgart : ski@@ ers of tropical storm &quot; &quot; Henry &quot; &quot; expected in the south @-@ west &quot;
meteor@@ ologists warn of g@@ astro@@ ph@@ es in the southwest of Wednesday afternoon .
&quot; due to a low pressure area over Western Europe , hot sea air flows into the country , distributed the German Weather Service ( D@@ WD ) in Stuttgart . &quot;
&quot; the strong low is the out@@ runner of the tropical storm &quot; Henry , &quot; which was drawn from the Bermuda Islands over the Atlantic last days . &quot;
storms and storms are mainly expected in Baden .
&quot; according to D@@ WD , it is still in the Black Forest up to Thursday , on the Sw@@ ab@@ ian Al@@ b and in the ground floor with gu@@ sts of 60 to 90 km of hour . &quot;
&quot; on Friday , the sun can be seen again longer . &quot;
the mass makes it : every two years the high@@ s at the I@@ AA show their novel@@ ties .
&quot; in 2015 , it is mainly a movement among the compact cars that are currently especially well @-@ selling . &quot;
&quot; cars from the compact class are currently particularly popular : approximately 28,@@ 1 percent of new registr@@ ations accoun@@ ted for this segment only in August . &quot;
this is also reflected at the I@@ AA ( public days 17 to 27 September ) .
&quot; this year , many new compact models will be introduced between all fut@@ uris@@ tic concept cars and new luxury cars . &quot;
&quot; one of the biggest premier@@ es for the German car industry is Opel Astra , which will be available to dealers in autumn . &quot;
&quot; the Astra is an extremely important model for us , &quot; said Opel CEO Karl @-@ Thomas Neumann at the fair . &quot;
it belongs to the core of the brand .
&quot; in order for the volume model to be sold well , the new Astra is also not much more expensive . &quot;
Opel makes a entry below the biggest competi@@ tor VW Golf in view that starts at 17 650 euros .
the current Astra costs from € 16@@ 990 .
the Astra is equipped with a new 1.4 @-@ liter engine with 74 kW / 100 hp .
&quot; in addition , the H@@ esse offer other diesel and gasoline engines of 70 kW / 95 hp to 147 kW / / 200 hp , for which three @-@ cylinder petrol engines are for the first time . &quot;
&quot; unlike most competi@@ tor VW Golf and Ford Focus , Opel Astra is initially only five @-@ door . &quot;
&quot; the second variant will follow in the spring of the station wagon , which is already visible at the I@@ AA . &quot;
and what will be added next to the Astra at the I@@ AA on new compact cars ?
Renault Mé@@ gan@@ e : Renault sends the fourth generation of its Astra competing Mé@@ gan@@ e into the race .
&quot; at the fair , the Mé@@ gan@@ e can only be seen as a five @-@ door in a conventional and an acc@@ entu@@ ated sporty GT version . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of next year , it is also available as a station wagon . &quot;
Infin@@ iti : brand new in the segment is Infin@@ iti Q@@ 30 .
the Nissan boom wants to find its position in the strongly growing segment with the new model .
&quot; the compact Infin@@ iti , with its curved lines , fits perfectly into the design line of the brand . &quot;
the basic model will get a petrol engine with an output of at least 90 kW / 122 hp .
the offer is also a diesel with 80 kW / 109 hp or 125 kW / 170 hp .
Suzuki Bal@@ eno : new in the segment is also the Suzuki Bal@@ eno that celebrates its world premiere in Frankfurt .
&quot; the model is offered with gasoline engines , including a newly developed 1.0 @-@ liter tur@@ bom@@ ot@@ or and an output of 82 kW / 111 hp . &quot;
the maximum torque is based on manufacturer &apos;s declar@@ ations at 170 new@@ ton meters ( Nm ) .
sales launch of the Bal@@ eno in Europe is spring 2016 .
DS 4 : not completely new but completely renewed is the compact car model DS 4 which is visible at the I@@ AA .
&quot; outside the designers of the noble Citro@@ ë@@ n @-@ Ab@@ leg@@ ers were especially hand @-@ painted on the front part : here , the radiator gr@@ ille was re@@ drawn and the modified head@@ lights with LED technology were equipped . &quot;
&quot; in the interior , the inf@@ ot@@ ain@@ ment system was moderni@@ zed , reducing the number of buttons by a touch screen and integrated Apple &apos;s Car@@ Play for the first time . &quot;
&quot; in addition , at the I@@ AA in the compact class , there are a number of re@@ visions and new variants , such as the rear @-@ mounted Mercedes A @-@ Class or the Peugeot 308 GT@@ I . &quot;
&quot; J@@ VA Berlin @-@ Te@@ gel : five square meters of cell , are un@@ worthy &quot;
the Federal Constitutional Court admitted to an ex @-@ prisoner of the Bundes@@ verfassungs@@ gericht Te@@ gel which was lod@@ ged in a too small cell months for months .
&quot; because of the violation of their human dignity , prisoners are entitled to financial compensation if they are accommod@@ ated in small cells . &quot;
this decision was made by the Federal Constitutional Court in a decision issued on Wednesday .
the persons affected can even hope for money if they were imprisoned only a few days in the confined spaces ( A@@ z . : 1 BvR 112@@ 7 / 14 ) .
&quot; in this way , an ex @-@ prisoner was successful with his constitutional complaint in Karlsruhe : he was lod@@ ged in a single cell with around five square meters of floor space between June and November 2009 ; the toilet was not separate . &quot;
&quot; after that , the man , who is now on the loose foot according to his lawyer &apos;s particulars , was transferred to a larger cell . &quot;
his ten@@ ure of office due to the un@@ worthy detention conditions against the country of Berlin failed .
&quot; however , the judges raised the verdi@@ ct of the Berlin Chamber of App@@ eal and dismis@@ sed the case for re @-@ examination . &quot;
you see the man &apos;s human dignity is viol@@ ated .
chamber court now decides on the amount of compensation
&quot; even if for legal reasons only a few days of arrest for compensation are author@@ it@@ ative for compensation , a compensation claim was given . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , &quot; &quot; would fear the personality protection of the personality . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Court of App@@ eal must now clarify the amount of dental damage .
&quot; in the past , the Constitutional Court has often strengthened the rights of prisoners of prisoners . &quot;
&quot; in April , they spoke to a prisoner of damage in April because he was naked in a cell . &quot;
&quot; according to a decision of 2011 , man un@@ worthy is also the multiple occup@@ ancy of a cell without separate toilet . &quot;
&quot; in addition , on Wednesday , Karlsruhe has also confirmed the Berlin Constitutional Court , which in@@ stituted a decent housing for a prisoner in a parallel fall in November 2009 . &quot;
the then K@@ lä@@ ger lived in a similar cell every day between 15 and 21 hours in a similar cell like in the Karls@@ ru@@ her case .
the Berlin pris@@ ons have also come into the head@@ lines because of lack of personnel in recent weeks .
&quot; prisoners are therefore always included 23 hours , the aggres@@ si@@ veness increases , even to massac@@ res , it should have already come because of the ten@@ se situation . &quot;
&quot; after information from the Jus@@ tiz@@ press@@ est@@ elle , 21 places in Te@@ gel are not occupied because of a shortage of young people , 19 shall fall away in 2016 . &quot;
Angela Merkel and the refugee policy : &quot; we are creating this &quot;
the immigration of refugees is an enormous challenge - the Chancellor is determined to accept her .
what comes to Germany ?
&quot; some 800 000 asylum seek@@ ers will come to Germany according to the Federal Ministry of Justice this year , according to Vice Chancellor Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) , Germany is even able to accommodate a million refugees . &quot;
&quot; in view of the unusual challenge , German Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) demonstrated determination in the face of the unusual challenge : &quot; &quot; I say again and again : we can do that , and we do it . &quot;
&quot; what comes to Germany , gives the following overview . &quot;
&quot; according to various forecasts , between 35@@ 0000 ( estimate of the Federal Ministry of State ) and 400@@ ,000 ( estimate of the P@@ est@@ el Institute ) apartments are held annually - and the next five years . &quot;
this is almost twice as much as ever built ( 25@@ 0000 homes ) .
&quot; the lack of living space is dramatic , but above all for affordable rental properties : every year , 600@@ 00 to 800@@ 00 social housing will fall out of the rental price and around these particularly convenient apartments will also apply for refugees . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , Federal Minister of State Barbara Hend@@ ri@@ cks ( SPD ) aims to double the funding from currently 518 million to one billion euros . &quot;
&quot; much too little is that from the point of view of the P@@ est@@ el Institute : 80 000 social housing a year would have to arise , and the federal government would have to invest EUR 6.4 billion a year . &quot;
scientists and Federal Minister of State agree that there must also be more tax advantages for investment in housing construction .
&quot; according to the Institute for Employment Research , it is estimated that 55 percent of the poultry in Germany can be employed in the long term . &quot;
&quot; however , in Germany , the refugees in Germany were not systematically asked about their qualification to help them get started , Claudia Walter critic@@ ises the project manager for integration and education in the Ber@@ tel@@ smann foundation . &quot;
but it is crucial for the integration of refugees to find employment in Germany .
&quot; work is the key to social contacts , for the este@@ em in the employment society , but also for the self @-@ este@@ em of immigrants , says Mig@@ r@@ ations@@ researcher Dietrich Thr@@ iller . &quot;
&quot; in Germany , there has been a political shift in Germany according to the thr@@ iller : from the prohibition of labour for refugees to recognise work . &quot;
&quot; while there was a ban on employment for asylum seek@@ ers up to five years ago , it was reduced to three months in November 2014 , just as the residence light , the asylum seek@@ ers restricted to a residence . &quot;
&quot; the aim is to gather information on the quality and variety of what IAB offers , on comprehen@@ sibility , motivation for use , and new user requirements , with a view to improving IAB &apos;s web presence even further . &quot;
lack of German knowledge is a major barrier to access to the labour market .
&quot; until now , there is no sufficient supply of general and professional language courses . &quot;
studies also show that jobs are most often medi@@ ated by personal contacts .
&quot; for this reason , the creation of networks is based on the view of Thr@@ es@@ hardt from the Königs@@ weg to work integration . &quot;
&quot; the Berlin School Administration has found that only a few des@@ pat@@ ched parents give their children to the Kit@@ as , an estimated 10 to 15 percent : &quot; for the ro@@ ared parents it is only once important to keep the family together , &quot; says Il@@ ja Ko@@ diag@@ bar , spokes@@ man for youth and family in the Berlin Senate Administration . &quot;
&quot; to convince the family of the advantages of the K@@ ita , the administration distri@@ butes hand@@ ball@@ ots in different languages . &quot;
&quot; if the need for educ@@ ators should rise strongly by the large number of refugees , the Berlin Senate would try to increase educational capacities - for instance by allowing more skilled schools . &quot;
&quot; in the countries , students will be prepared for lessons without German knowledge in welcome classes . &quot;
&quot; however , they are not always taught by fully trained teachers , but , as in Berlin , also by teachers who have only one qualification in German as a second language . &quot;
&quot; there is no shortage of them , says Be@@ ate St@@ offers from the Berlin school administration . &quot;
the German Studenten@@ werk estimates that about 20 percent of the refugees in Germany want to study .
&quot; in principle , no federal state does not prohi@@ bit asylum seek@@ ers or pati@@ ently for their studies - the only exception was Berlin , inside sen@@ ator Frank H@@ enkel ( CD@@ U ) has now abandoned his attitude . &quot;
student willing refugees could facilitate access to the university .
&quot; because refugees with a citizenship or debt receive no more services according to the asylum seek@@ ers law , if they start studying . &quot;
&quot; the latter basically do not get a b@@ af@@ ö@@ g , as they do not fall under the circle of legitimate persons . &quot;
&quot; toler@@ ated refugees had to have lived in Germany for four years to be entitled to be B@@ af@@ ö@@ g , from 1 January 2016 , this span short@@ ens to 15 months . &quot;
&quot; but this financial gap must also be closed , demand Steffen Kra@@ ch , Berlin &apos;s State Secretary for Science , and the Deutsche Studenten@@ werk . &quot;
students should immediately get B@@ af@@ ö@@ g .
&quot; Islam will play a more important role in the future , because many refugees are Muslims , and for many , religion is an important part of their identity . &quot;
&quot; the state should succ@@ essi@@ vely im@@ part the same rights to Islam as they have the churches , and the existing state @-@ churches @-@ right to develop a new state @-@ religion ratio . &quot;
&quot; it would also be important to establish a Islamic well @-@ being association , who cares for the newcom@@ ers professionally . &quot;
the rights also include duties .
&quot; thus , the representatives of Islam must agree on clear contact persons and be willing to cooperate with the state in many areas and grant them certain control options . &quot;
&quot; this also includes the willingness to act against religious fundament@@ alism , too . &quot;
&quot; the Chairman of the Central Council of Muslims , A@@ im@@ an Maz@@ ye@@ k , expressed concern on Thursday that religious conflicts could also be carried into Germany . &quot;
&quot; those who wanted to pun@@ ish such conflicts in Germany &quot; have immediately their right to stay here , in Germany , &quot; he said in Bay@@ rische Rundfunk . &quot;
he proposed to translate the Basic Law in Arabic .
&quot; in the future , integration will be much more than today a topic of the whole society . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , the majority society will also have to change , the reduction of discrimination and rac@@ ism will be more pressing . &quot;
&quot; Germany , as a result of European decisions , has been an anti @-@ discrimination site and a general gender equality law since a decade . &quot;
&quot; however , it is very slow to learn how the NS@@ U was systematically ignor@@ ing the rac@@ ist motif in the police and authorities . &quot;
&quot; equal opportunities for all : what migrant organisations and the interest groups of non @-@ white German have long been demanding and what international agreements like the anti @-@ rac@@ ism convention of Germany are committed , must become a reality in the coming years when the country should remain peaceful and its new citizens should use their opportunities - for the benefit of all . &quot;
&quot; in general , Germany is able to medi@@ cally supply the expected refugees , according to Frank Ulrich Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery . &quot;
&quot; as for man@@ - power and capacities , we create that , &quot; he said to the Tages@@ spiegel . &quot;
&quot; however , additional money must be incorporated into the system . &quot;
&quot; to avoid bott@@ len@@ ecks , Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery expects to susp@@ end all newcom@@ ers in the registration of health tickets . &quot;
&quot; later , achievements could be rec@@ al@@ cul@@ ated with the federal states . &quot;
&quot; and in the long run , it is highly question@@ able to save as many people with the limited range of services the asylum seek@@ ers law . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , the doctors make the language barriers above all . &quot;
&quot; so far , the Berlin health scientist The@@ a Bor@@ de has proven to be worse about their illnesses as other patients . &quot;
&quot; not only in clinics , also in medical practices , interpre@@ ting costs must be taken over , demands it . &quot;
&quot; however , many refugees were also helped with more general medical problems in emergency ambul@@ ances . &quot;
and with another diagnostic view .
&quot; for example , under refugee channels , there are clearly more untreated obstruc@@ tions , and with the young people it is about HIV awareness . &quot;
&quot; but with some other disease pictures , German doctors come from their training but clearly , Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery believes . &quot;
&quot; paras@@ ite inf@@ estation or tu@@ ber@@ cu@@ lo@@ sis are not so difficult to detect . &quot; &quot; and as for the medical affairs , perhaps even alle@@ vi@@ ation in sight may be caused by the refugees . &quot;
&quot; the Syri@@ ans would have a highly developed education system , some refugees are even doctors . &quot;
&quot; to be allowed to practice , however , they would have to prove their qualification and possibly have ex@@ ams again . &quot;
&quot; at least half of the refugees coming in Germany are psych@@ ically ill according to estimates by the Federal Psych@@ otherap@@ ist Chamber ( B@@ P@@ t@@ K ) , most of them suffer from a post@@ traumatic stress disorder or depression . &quot;
&quot; refugee children are particularly vulnerable , explains Dietrich Mun@@ z , President of the B@@ P@@ t@@ K . &quot;
a recently published study by the TU München att@@ ests that every fifth Syrian refugee crisis is trau@@ mati@@ zed in Germany .
&quot; those who suffer from a post @-@ traumatic stress disorder , among other things suffer from so @-@ called Flash@@ backs with difficulty breathing , di@@ zz@@ iness , heart attack and death . &quot;
&quot; further symptoms are sleeping and concentration difficulties , strong fri@@ ght and emotional num@@ b@@ ness . &quot;
&quot; to prevent the symptoms chronic , an early treatment is necessary , explained Mun@@ z . &quot;
&quot; however , up to now only four percent of the psych@@ ologically ill refugees receive psych@@ otherapy . &quot;
&quot; although mentally ill seeking asylum seek@@ ers can provide an application for psych@@ otherapy , the treatment usually takes several months . &quot;
&quot; in addition , specialists or doctors , who are not trained for mental illnesses , would decide whether a therapy is necessary or not . &quot;
&quot; this often lead to mis@@ calculations , says Mun@@ z . &quot;
Man@@ ege invites you to dream
cir@@ cus Pro@@ bst looks back on the traditions of cir@@ cus arts with the new &quot; passion &quot; st@@ aging .
&quot; the goal is to attract any age group into the spell of fascinating ac@@ rob@@ atics , animal dres@@ sage and unique entertainment . &quot;
&quot; now the Circus Pro@@ bst looks into the man@@ ege on the brick , wash it up to dream . &quot;
&quot; our passion is cir@@ cus . &quot;
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine living without my cir@@ cus family , &quot; says Steph@@ anie Pro@@ bst , Tier@@ Instruc@@ tor and Juni@@ or@@ ch@@ ef@@ in . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; passion &quot; &quot; - under this motto is the current mode of operation . &quot;
&quot; for more than 33 years , the cir@@ cus is in the hands of the Pro@@ bst family . &quot;
&quot; thus , the family is in the blood of the family . &quot;
&quot; it is important to us to take away people from their everyday life and take them into a completely different world for two hours , &quot; stresses the 27 @-@ year @-@ old Juni@@ or@@ ch@@ ef@@ in . &quot;
&quot; Man@@ eg@@ enco@@ ck@@ tails with world city flair , &quot; says Director Reinhard Pro@@ bst his concept . &quot;
&quot; 50 cities on the nearly 3,000 kilometres long tour can now experience this flair . &quot;
the cir@@ cus program impres@@ ses with talented artists from all over the world .
&quot; excellent at the international cir@@ cus festival in Monte Carlo , the Russian St@@ oli@@ ar@@ ov C@@ low@@ n Family moves the audience with w@@ it and charm into their spell . &quot;
the Castillo Brothers also understand their craft .
&quot; with the heroes of the silent movies , the Cub@@ an duo likes to take up . &quot;
light@@ ness and ag@@ ility - with these words they identify themselves .
her hum@@ orous art at the mast is intended to conquer women &apos;s hearts in the storm .
&quot; besides numerous salmon sal@@ ts , the ac@@ rob@@ atics of Circus Pro@@ bst fascin@@ ates also with finger@@ tips and artic@@ ulated . &quot;
balancing with the un@@ ic@@ ycle on a ball ?
for He y@@ uan no problem .
snake @-@ Man fascin@@ ate and terri@@ fies at the same time .
W@@ ang L@@ in from China is familiar with the oldest form of ac@@ rob@@ atics like little others and fascin@@ ates with their mobility .
60 employees from twelve nations offer variety in every respect .
&quot; the animals belong to our family , &quot; stresses Steph@@ an@@ ies Mutter , Brigitte Pro@@ bst . &quot;
gri@@ ev@@ ances in the attitude of cir@@ cus animals are only too often subject to various animal welfare organizations .
&quot; Steph@@ anie Pro@@ bst looks at this : &quot; &quot; it is not good for our animals , it doesn &apos;t work well either . &quot;
around 80 animals from five different continents enjoy each car@@ pet@@ ting unit .
&quot; the &quot; four @-@ leg@@ ged arti@@ stes , &quot; as they are lov@@ ingly called , will be read by the eyes every wish . &quot;
we want to work with the animals and have fun with them .
&quot; if the beast does not feel well , it does not want to go into the arena . &quot;
the first commandment therefore : good for the animals .
&quot; especially on its zeb@@ roid jum@@ bo , a mixture of a Sh@@ et@@ land pon@@ y stallion and a zeb@@ ra@@ mare , the Pro@@ bst family is proud . &quot;
the two animals lived together for eight years in an enclosure and nothing happened .
&quot; but then , suddenly , our little jum@@ bo was there , &quot; &quot; says Brigitte Pro@@ bst . &quot;
&quot; the zeb@@ roid is not ready for the arena , but it is the unique mas@@ cot of Circus Pro@@ bst . &quot;
so there should be something for every visitor .
&quot; one thing is certain , &quot; &quot; says Steph@@ anie Pro@@ bst : &quot; &quot; no matter if five or 1 200 viewers , we always do our best and are with all the heart . &quot;
&quot; the Circus Pro@@ bst , from September 17 to 20 , invites every day at 5 p.m. to 8 p.m. &quot;
&quot; on Sunday , the program starts at 11 a.m. and 4 p.m. &quot;
&quot; sorry , there is no translation for this news @-@ article . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the animal show is open daily from 10 am to 6 pm . &quot;
Sim@@ bab@@ we@@ es Robert Mu@@ gabe gives false speech in parliament
&quot; Mr Mu@@ gabe , Africa &apos;s oldest leader , dropped down the stairs from a podium at the beginning of the year . &quot;
&quot; he remained un@@ har@@ med , but the video of the case spread rapidly across the social media . &quot;
&quot; the Parliament &apos;s opening was also clou@@ ded by statements made by members of the opposition , that they had received anonymous death threats and warned them to accompany Mr Mu@@ gabe with Bu@@ hr@@ u . &quot;
&quot; last month , they had boo@@ sted him and interrupted him during his speech on the State of the Nation in parliament - this is the speech he repeated on Tuesday . &quot;
spokes@@ man of the Movement for Democratic Change ( M@@ DC ) In@@ no@@ cent Gon@@ ese said that seven opposition politicians have received SMS messages on their phones that warned them to distur@@ b Mr. Mu@@ gabe &apos;s speech .
&quot; the message comes from a number that is not displayed , but it has the title &apos; death &apos; , he said journalists to Mu@@ gabe &apos;s speech . &quot;
&quot; it war@@ ns the members concerned that the immun@@ ity will end in parliament , and once they leave the Parliament , their parliamentary immun@@ ity is no longer effective . &quot;
chief spokes@@ man said that the party led by Morgan T@@ sv@@ angi@@ ra@@ i is &quot; concerned &quot; about the dangers for politicians .
Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard will reduce up to 30.000 jobs
Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard is expected to de@@ construct 25,000 to 30.000 jobs within the framework of restructuring and saving efforts in the company &apos;s services . &quot;
&quot; later this year , HP will split into two listed companies and separate the computer and printer business from its faster @-@ growing company hardware and service business activities . &quot;
&quot; the expected actu@@ ation will result in a burden of over 2.7 billion dollars from the fourth quarter , HP said in an explanation . &quot;
&quot; these restructuring measures will enable a more competitive , more sustainable cost structure for the new Hew@@ lett Packard Enterprise , &quot; said Me@@ g Whit@@ man , HP president and Chief Executive , who is to lead the unit after separation . &quot;
&quot; Hew@@ lett Packard Enterprise will be smaller and more focused than HP is today , and we have a broad and deep@@ ened portfolio of businesses that support companies in transition to a new style of business , &quot; &quot; said Whit@@ man . &quot;
as an independent company we are better positioned than ever before to satisfy the changing needs of our customers around the world .
&quot; Hew@@ lett Packard Enterprise has more than 50 billion $ annual revenue and will be focused on providing hi@@ ther@@ to @-@ to @-@ date , integrated technology solutions for companies , &quot; &quot; explains the company &apos;s statement . &quot;
&quot; it divi@@ des a company that was founded in the 19@@ 30s by the graduates of Stan@@ ford University Bill Hew@@ lett and Dave Packard , to produce electro @-@ systems and called Pal@@ o Alto Garage &quot; the birth@@ place of Silicon Valley . &quot; &quot;
HP has under@@ gone a massive restructuring to cope with the conversion of traditional PCs to mobile devices .
&quot; HP , the world &apos;s second largest PC manufacturer and one of the largest U.S. tech companies , is the latest in this field based on the belief that closely focused businesses provide a better performance . &quot;
FC Arsen@@ al @-@ Captain Mik@@ el Art@@ eta says that team @-@ mates must stand behind the wounded Jack Wil@@ sh@@ ere before the game vs Dynam@@ o Zagreb
&quot; Wen@@ ger emphas@@ ised Wil@@ sh@@ ere that it was only September and if his rehabilitation runs according to plan , there is no reason why he cannot play before Christmas . &quot;
&quot; this optim@@ istic scenario already means that Wil@@ sh@@ ere will surely miss at least the next four games for England , and in view of his story his participation in the next summer at the European Championship is certainly still uncertain . &quot;
the big shame on this current problem is that Wil@@ sh@@ ere had ended the last season after a separate ank@@ le injury and then returned to his old swing during the pres@@ e@@ ason .
&quot; this kind of injury is not threatening the career , &quot; Wen@@ ger said . &quot;
it is a bone that did not heal well .
this is not a major issue .
this was just an accident .
it was not in connection with his an@@ kles or with the injuries he had before .
&quot; this may be true from purely medical point of view , but as Wen@@ ger also recognized , there is the associated risk of further injuries , whenever a player tries to return in the middle of the season . &quot;
it also develops an unpleasant pattern .
the investigation of Prime Minister In@@ j@@ uries Ltd reported 23 different diseases of Wil@@ sh@@ ere since his debut six years ago .
he also played in only 65 of ar@@ sen@@ als 157 league games in the last five seasons .
the wider picture for Arsen@@ al is that they have been one of the two Premier League clubs in six of eight seasons since 2007 / 08 that have to list most injuries .
&quot; Wen@@ ger accepts the potential of a vi@@ cious circle , but ar@@ sen@@ al believes that an improvement in the injury rate will continue during the last season . &quot;
&quot; sometimes when you come back from an injury , you have a te@@ di@@ ous period of time , a time in which you need to strengthen your body and gain fighting power , &quot; Wen@@ ger said . &quot;
Jack is young enough to overcome that .
&quot; I hope his body stabili@@ zes , I am confident that he will do it and he will run a career of the way he deserves . &quot;
ar@@ sen@@ al starts his Champions League season on Wednesday evening against Din@@ amo Zagreb to play against Chelsea on Saturday and against Tot@@ ten@@ ham Hot@@ spur on Wednesday and Wen@@ ger presents a rotation within the team .
&quot; H@@ é@@ ctor Bell@@ er@@ ín and Aaron Ram@@ sey have not travelled to Croatia , meaning Math@@ ie@@ u Deb@@ u@@ chy and Art@@ eta must start . &quot;
Wen@@ ger can also begin with K@@ ier@@ an Gib@@ bs and Olivier Gi@@ rou@@ d instead of Nach@@ o Mon@@ real and Theo Wal@@ cot@@ t .
&quot; I try to keep the balance and give the players who need it to give a little break , &quot; Wen@@ ger said . &quot;
&quot; although Arsen@@ al &apos;s clear favor@@ ites are to go ahead with group F , the Mak@@ si@@ mir Stadium in Zagreb belongs to the play@@ grounds with the biggest inti@@ mid@@ ation effect in Europe . &quot;
dynam@@ o is also unbe@@ aten after 41 games after the &quot; inv@@ inci@@ ble &quot; campaign started in the last season .
the stadium was sha@@ ken by an earthquake on Tuesday evening and 3.2 were measured on the Richter scale .
this year it was the 10th in Zagreb .
&quot; Wen@@ ger is the opinion that Arsen@@ al has drawn up the lesson from the past season with the Champions League capit@@ ulation against Monaco , and is driven by the distant hope to lead the club to its first Europ@@ ap@@ oc@@ al triumph . &quot;
&quot; this drive is immense , &quot; Wen@@ ger said . &quot;
it has never worked at Arsen@@ al .
we were very close in 2006 but on the other hand I &apos;m long enough in business to be realistic .
&quot; we are ambitious , but we are not dre@@ amer . &quot;
&quot; Friend@@ s@@ Fest : the com@@ edy show , which gave us serious lessons on male friend@@ ships &quot;
&quot; the absence of similar represent@@ ations in shows is obvious , especially with regard to how the need for men to open up , now even more des@@ perate than ever has become how suicide rates among young men will prove on a 15 @-@ year high . &quot;
&quot; in 2013 , it was the most important cause of death among men aged 20 to 45 in the UK , and it remains three times more common in men than women . &quot;
&quot; in an effort to address the issue , the Campa@@ ign Against Living Mis@@ er@@ ably ( CAL@@ M Campa@@ ign against a her@@ edit@@ ary life ) announced in 2015 as the year of the man with the aim of ques@@ tioning the culture that men seek to seek help if they need them . &quot;
friendship is the heart of battle to overcome this challenge .
&quot; a recent study with more than 2,000 high school students with depres@@ sive symptoms stated that when the suff@@ erer had a sufficiently high percentage of friends with &quot; healthy mood , &quot; his chances of recovery doubled . &quot;
&quot; for those who are not de@@ pressed , a circle of mentally healthy friends hal@@ ves the risks of mental problems . &quot;
but of course you have to have friends for a friendship .
&quot; in the age of communication related to social media , with its focus on the style of substance , the immedi@@ acy of the answer is often more important than a meaningful contact . &quot;
&quot; our digital lives have doubled the need to appear strong , fun and successful , even if in reality the isolation domin@@ ates . &quot;
&quot; this super@@ ficial success is dominated by what psych@@ ologists call ex@@ trin@@ sic values ; money , image , social status , everything at the expense of in@@ trin@@ sic values - our inner longing for personal development and friendship that affects our mental health much deeper . &quot;
&quot; and as a video game invent@@ or and billi@@ on@@ aire recently explained , money can really not buy happiness . &quot;
the beauty of friends was that this focus was placed on the head .
&quot; each character was defined not by his work , but by his personality , which sh@@ ines through the interaction as a friend . &quot;
&quot; the hum@@ our of Jo@@ ey and Ch@@ and@@ ler &apos;s frequent hu@@ gs , moments when football matches in comfortable arm@@ chairs and the longing of Ross to Rachel - all this came out of the knowledge that men can definitely get back to explore their feelings completely . &quot;
&quot; as an employee of telephone couns@@ elling it told me : ... &quot; &quot; my audience role for people who feel de@@ pressed and compl@@ aining themselves has really shown me how even the smallest interactions of friends can make a difference . &quot;
the men who contact us feel often unable to talk with friends .
&quot; the old saying &quot; I come along with it &quot; has a tremendous impact , as the feeling that it is perceived as weakness , when talking about problems openly . &quot;
friends is one of the shows that comes to mind when I try to offer long @-@ term cop@@ ing mechanisms .
it clearly presents the small moments of men &apos;s friend@@ ships .
&quot; so much my objective out@@ sider status about the phone can help people in moments of despair , too , the long @-@ term support comes from a personal network of family and friends . &quot;
&quot; and so , if you visit Com@@ edy Central Friend@@ s@@ Fest this weekend with which to celebrate the day completely re@@ designed scenery , why don &apos;t take your friends to a drink in Central Per@@ k with . &quot;
&quot; or , even better , if you see someone sitting around in Star@@ bu@@ cks alone , give him a smile and say h@@ ello . &quot;
you never know what difference your friendship could make .
friends will be sent to Com@@ edy Central from beginning to end - all 236 episodes - for # Friend@@ s@@ Fest
di Maria meets to help PSG to gr@@ ind Malm@@ ö
angel Di Maria celebrates with Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i and Ed@@ inson Cav@@ ani after his hit against Malm@@ ö .
&quot; at his debut in the Champions League in the Champions League on Tuesday , he makes PSG to pass on to Malm@@ ö . &quot;
here are the play report and the reaction to the game .
angel Di Maria and Ed@@ inson Cav@@ ani kept course when Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main started his Champions League season with an extremely comfortable 2 @-@ 0 victory against Malm@@ ö in the principle park@@ stadi@@ on on Tuesday .
&quot; in less than four minutes after the start of his champ@@ ions League Deb@@ ü@@ ts , Maria met the French champion , but afterwards she missed a number of occasions before she finally increased its lead when Cav@@ ani achieved a head of the head in the 6@@ 1st minute . &quot;
&quot; with Real Madrid and Schach@@ t@@ j@@ or Don@@ et@@ sk also in group A , Paris takes a strong start against the Swedish master , as they not only asp@@ ire to the qualification for the kno@@ ck@@ ons but an improvement on the way to the quarter fin@@ als in each of the last three campaigns . &quot;
&quot; but as they got the points , it was not a class of Laurent Blan@@ cs team with Zlat@@ an I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ cs missed opportunities in front of the gate . he was later replaced by his hom@@ etown team and against the club with whom he began his illustri@@ ous career in 1999 . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s not easy to win at home or down@@ ward in the Champions League . so it &apos;s a good start to win 2 : 0 , cause our opponents to cause problems and to look back , even if there are certain things that we have to perfec@@ tion@@ ist over the season , &quot; Blanc said . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is a good omen . &quot;
&quot; we wanted to win and we won , although I regret that we haven &apos;t achieved one or two other goals . &quot;
&quot; after his injury , I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c returned in one of three changes to the Paris team that was able to hold a 2 : 2 oun@@ ces on their own square against Bordeaux in the First League , but he was sto@@ cked out in the fourth minute by Di Maria . &quot;
&quot; the Argent@@ ine@@ an wing storm was called the man who was able to take the PSG to the next stage in Europe , when he was taken over in the last month of Manchester United , and he suggested why , when he went into Marco Ver@@ rat@@ tis passport behind the Malm@@ ö defense before he graduated to Johan Wil@@ and passed nicely into the long corner of the net . &quot;
&quot; however , if someone believed that PSG would achieve a great victory , he was disappointed . &quot;
&quot; Malm@@ ö , which hit Celtic in a play @-@ off to reach this level , joined An@@ pi@@ ff with nine national players in the field and was armed with a five @-@ man defense and two deep in the middle field a serious opponent . &quot;
&quot; but besides a shot by Nik@@ ola D@@ jur@@ dj@@ ic , who passed far to Kevin Tra@@ pps P@@ fo@@ sten in the 34@@ th minute , they did little in the attack . &quot;
&quot; instead , PSG himself sometimes got up , with some mis@@ ses and bad connections , not least from I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c , who was scrat@@ ched in the first half by no less than five attempts and then abandoned after Cav@@ ani had used it after rest@@ art@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless he proved much more skill when he brought his fellow players into the game , and it was a passport from I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c who turned Di Maria into a shot down by Wil@@ and in the 5@@ 2nd minute at the post ... &quot;
the second goal finally fell short after the hours mark thanks to Cav@@ ani . the Urugu@@ ay@@ ans achieved his sixth season tor after I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c had caught a left flan@@ k of Max@@ well .
&quot; that ended all the thoughts that Malm@@ ö could come back to the game , and only an excellent intervention of Wil@@ and from short@@ est distance to stop David Lu@@ iz was able to keep the end result low before sub@@ woofer Ez@@ equi@@ el Lav@@ e@@ zzi received a gate at the end . &quot;
&quot; the coach of Malm@@ ö , Age Har@@ ei@@ de , later admitted that PSG played a class above his team , and the Norwegian said : &quot; our last Champions League game was last year . &quot;
&quot; since then , we have only played in the Swedish league , which did not have the same level . &quot;
the qualification matches are not enough . &quot;
hats off to Paris !
it was a great game of them !
Gl@@ enc@@ ore colle@@ cts $ 2.5 billion through share sales
&quot; the Mining Ri@@ ese Gl@@ enc@@ ore resi@@ des in Switzerland , which is affected by collap@@ sing raw materials prices , accumulated $ 2.5 billion on Wednesday as part of its huge school denti@@ al plan . &quot;
Gl@@ enc@@ ore registered in London in a statement that he sold new shares worth about $ 1.6 billion in order to pay off his own debts .
&quot; the company , which has lost 57 per cent of its market value this year , is fighting with falling commodity prices , as China &apos;s economic down@@ turn expresses demand and has a devast@@ ating effect on markets . &quot;
the issu@@ ance of subscription rights brought Gl@@ en@@ cores the share price of trading early Wednesday morning a rapid rise to the top of the London stock exchange .
&quot; the share j@@ umped by 2.@@ 77 percent to 13@@ 1.@@ 60 P@@ ence on the FT@@ SE 100 index , which opened 0.@@ 69 percent higher . &quot;
&quot; Gl@@ enc@@ ore had announced the 2.5 billion dollar stock sale last week as part of the more comprehensive plans to wi@@ pe about a third of its $ 30 billion debt , announced . &quot;
&quot; the company sold the new shar@@ ehol@@ dings to 125 P@@ ence per share , which meant a 2.4 percent discount on the closing price on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; there were 1.3 billion shares worth up to 9,@@ 99 percent of the Group . &quot;
&quot; concerns regarding a long @-@ term growth in China have reduced iron ore prices by about half , coal , copper and other raw materials prices dropped by 20 to 40 percent . &quot;

the White House endor@@ ses Xi Jin@@ ping &apos;s visit to Washington
&quot; Chinese President Xi Jin@@ ping will make a state visit to the United States at the end of the month , the White House confirmed in a statement on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; the visit , xis of first official in Washington , takes place on September 25 and re@@ fut@@ ed President Barack Obama &apos;s journey to Beijing last November , said the statement . &quot;
&quot; the US president and the First Lady Michelle Obama will also be hosted by Xi and his wife Pen@@ g Li@@ y@@ uan , at a State D@@ iner , after the two leaders have conducted bilateral talks . &quot;
&quot; the visit will provide the opportunity to bro@@ aden the American @-@ Chinese cooperation in a number of global , regional and bilateral issues of common interest , but at the same time President Obama and President Xi will give the possibility to construc@@ tively address areas of dis@@ agreements , &quot; &quot; adds the statement . &quot;
&quot; XI , whose visit was first announced in February , will probably meet several U.S. technology leaders on his way to Washington , before travelling to New York City to the UN General Assembly in September . &quot;
&quot; it is expected that Obama and Xi will address a series of controversial issues , including Washington &apos;s concerns regarding China &apos;s alleged Cyber@@ spi@@ on@@ age and its increasing self @-@ confidence in the controversial waters of the South China Me@@ ers . &quot;
440 @-@ PS sports car rented and driven to scrap
a 29 @-@ year @-@ old wanted to fulfill a dream and gave himself a Ford Must@@ ang .
&quot; on the wet highway , the evil awakening came . &quot;
&quot; with a company in the district of Got@@ ha , one can meet the dream and rent a V8 U.S. sports car Ford Must@@ ang Boss 302 with 440 hp . &quot;
so did this also a 29 @-@ year @-@ old from the district of Got@@ ha .
&quot; on the A 71 near Arn@@ stadt , the dream was then gone and over . &quot;
&quot; the 29 @-@ year @-@ old lost control of the sports car , gr@@ ated on wet dri@@ v@@ eway and drove into the guard rail . &quot;
&quot; the sports car suffered total damage , nobody was injured . &quot;
&quot; the damage is estimated at 4@@ 0,000 EUR . &quot;
X@@ avi : PE@@ P Guardi@@ ola prevented 2008 change to FC Bayern
world and Europe champion X@@ avi has been playing for the al @-@ S@@ add Sport Club in Qatar since summer 2015
&quot; obviously , FC Bayern just stood before the commitment of Spain Super@@ star X@@ avi , which was then played for FC Barcelona . &quot;
&quot; eight time Spanish champion , three times champion winning champion , four times champion league winner , two times champion champion , twice World Champion , one time world champion - the title list of X@@ avi is stunning . &quot;
&quot; in summer , the 35 @-@ year @-@ old left FC Barcelona after 24 years and switched to al @-@ S@@ add Sport Club to Qatar . &quot;
&quot; but in an interview with the Mar@@ ca , X@@ avi now reveals that he was already in front of the F@@ arewell to Barcelona in front of the EM 2008 . &quot;
I told me that Bar@@ ça wanted to sell me .
&quot; Madrid at that time won everything , we don &apos;t know anything , &quot; he says . &quot;
and that also registered the FC Bayern .
X@@ avi : &quot; there was an offer of Bavaria . &quot;
&quot; Rum@@ men@@ ig@@ ge wanted to have me . &quot;
in the summer of 2008 Jürgen Klin@@ smann took over FC Bayern .
Guardi@@ ola was the reason X@@ avi didn &apos;t change
but the change did not come about .
and the crucial man for this works today for the German record champion : PE@@ P Guardi@@ ola .
&quot; X@@ avi declares , why : &quot; Bar@@ ça has taken Guardi@@ ola under contract and I played a great European . &quot;
PE@@ P told me that I would not change that he couldn &apos;t imagine the crew without me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so he has gotten me . &quot; &quot; &quot;
who knows how to run Bay@@ erns &apos;s season 2008 / 2009 with X@@ avi .
&quot; X@@ avi was standing for Bar@@ ca in the quar@@ ter@@ fin@@ als of the Champions League against Bavaria about the entire distance on the lawn , split the reds ( 4 : 0 , 1 : 1 ) and celebrated the King &apos;s Class triumph at the end . &quot;
matt Dam@@ on plays variety in film creation
matt Dam@@ on confron@@ ts the American film@@ maker Eff@@ ie Brown during a discussion about diversity and said she is not needed behind the scenes .
&quot; during a episode of Sunday Night by H@@ B@@ OS Project Green@@ Light , the experienced actor Brown broke down when she emphas@@ ised the need for alternative perspectives while referring to a black protagon@@ ist in the chosen script of the project . &quot;
&quot; if we talk about diversity , then do it in filling the film and not at the filling of the show , &quot; &quot; assured Dam@@ on . &quot;
&quot; brown re@@ acted sho@@ cked , with insul@@ ted un@@ belief and called &quot; Ho@@ o ! wow . okay , &quot; when the comment@@ ators of the act@@ ress captured by The Mar@@ tian . &quot;
Dam@@ on and Brown joined the producers of producers Ben Aff@@ le@@ ck and the Far@@ rel@@ ly Brothers to discuss the show fin@@ alists .
&quot; I want people to ask people to think about it - who will always be the director - as they treat the figure of Harmon@@ y , &quot; Brown said at first . &quot;
&quot; the only black person , and she is a sp@@ line beaten by her white p@@ im@@ p . &quot;
the producer of Dear White People sat down for the fin@@ alists Leo Angel@@ os and Kri@@ sten Bran@@ c@@ accio for direc@@ ting rights to the film ; Dam@@ on said that their direction &quot; at the end could give us something that we don &apos;t want .
&quot; after the discussion was broad@@ cast@@ ed , the social media explo@@ ded before dis@@ approval of Dam@@ on &apos;s comments . &quot;
&quot; Twitter users Mr Po@@ oni expressed his anger about the clip , writing &quot; Matt Dam@@ on talking about the only black person in space , so he can explain their variety - that is SO WE@@ ISS that it hur@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; the twe@@ et earned more than 5,000 retri@@ eves and 4,000 likes since its release . &quot;
Dam@@ on &apos;s comments arrive at a time when the exact racial representation in the media is at the head of the social discussion .
&quot; after the teen@@ ager Michael Brown was killed in 2014 by a white polic@@ eman , the Movement Black Li@@ ves Matter achieved country @-@ wide effect and urged legislat@@ ors and authorities to use discri@@ min@@ atory practices against non @-@ discri@@ min@@ atory practices . &quot;
&quot; in February , the singer Prince made an all@@ usion to the movement during the introduction of the nominated albums of the year at the Gram@@ my Awards . &quot;
&quot; albums still weaker , &quot; ( albums still have their meaning ) , he said . &quot;
&quot; like books and black life , albums still have their meaning . &quot;
&quot; in recent times , leaders of the Black Li@@ ves Matter movement have published an explanation in response to the question of the Fox News personality Elisabeth Hassel@@ beck , whether the group should be regarded as a hatred group . &quot;
&quot; the network Black Li@@ ves Matter is a love group , &quot; said the leaders . &quot;
&quot; recently , Dam@@ on was announced that Dam@@ on was on a list of enter@@ tainers , producers and media styles invited to visit the Pope in order to discuss the depic@@ tion of the Catholic Church in the West . &quot;
whether he accepted the invitation or already met the Pope is un@@ clear .
&apos;@@ American Nin@@ ja Warrior &apos; crow@@ ned first champion
&quot; professional sports clim@@ bers and operating aid Isaac Cal@@ di@@ ero became the first ath@@ l@@ ete , who won the American Nin@@ ja Warrior on Monday evening and took home the Grand Prix of $ 1 million . &quot;
&quot; the competition show , which had just completed their 7th season , had never experienced a competition participants , who could complete all stages of their obstacle course . &quot;
&quot; during the season finale there were two men , Cal@@ di@@ ero and cam@@ er@@ aman , Ge@@ off Brit@@ ten , to the final . &quot;
the last task was climbing on a 75 foot long climbing rope in 30 seconds .
&quot; Brit@@ ten finished the task at the time that he was the first ath@@ l@@ ete to complete the exhau@@ sting phase 4 of American Nin@@ ja Warrior . however , Cal@@ di@@ ero completed this challenge three seconds faster , making him the winner . &quot;
&quot; Cal@@ di@@ ero spoke to E ! News after the hard fought victory , still under the shock of winning the Grand Prix of $ 1 million . &quot;
&quot; I mean , it &apos;s amazing to think about it , I have never deser@@ ved more than $ 10,000 or had life , &quot; said Isaac E ! about his he@@ ap of money . &quot;
suddenly .. like I can &apos;t even imagine how this is ... the future is unknown .
&quot; the executive producer K@@ ent We@@ ed went with The Hollywood Rep@@ orter to discuss the final and why Brit@@ ten , although he first ever finished the course , did not receive any prize money . &quot;
&quot; after the rules , the money goes to the fastest person . &quot;
&quot; if there is more than one fin@@ alists , it gets the one with the fastest time , &quot; &quot; said We@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; how much money is a wonderful price and changed life , he receives the great ati@@ fication . &quot;
I don &apos;t think he &apos;ll have a gru@@ dge about it .
he is just as happy to have done what he did .
he received awards from fans .
he is such a great guy and a father .
he is a hero for his children and his wife .
&quot; Ge@@ off said to me , &quot; If I should be sm@@ itten by someone , then I am glad that it is Isaac . &quot;
and I think Isaac would have felt just as if they had changed the roles .
&quot; America Nin@@ ja Warrior has been extended for an ais@@ le season , the fil@@ ming will begin in spring 2016 . &quot;
Detroit Tig@@ ers sne@@ ak past Minn@@ es@@ ota Tw@@ ins
MIN@@ NE@@ AP@@ OL@@ IS@@ --@@ The second half of the season was not especially funny for the Detroit Tig@@ ers .
&quot; once they were one of the best teams in bas@@ eball , today the tig@@ ers stand in the last place in the American League Central . &quot;
&quot; the tig@@ ers are reduced to their role as spo@@ iler , but played this part perfectly against the Minn@@ es@@ ota Tw@@ ins with 5 @-@ 4 in target field on Tuesday . &quot;
the Tw@@ ins wast@@ ed a chance to climb within a half of Houston astro@@ s for the second American League Wild@@ card slot .
&quot; for Detroit , if only for one evening , it was a return of the three letter F @-@ word that was so difficult to grasp over a large part of the second half of the season . &quot;
&quot; all vic@@ tories make fun , no matter how it comes , &quot; said Tig@@ ers Manager Brad Sp@@ read . &quot;
&quot; tiger @-@ Pit@@ cher Al@@ fre@@ do Simon maintained his early offensive support when Detroit scored three times in the first two quarters , then once in the sixth and then once again in ninth place . &quot;
Simon ( 13 @-@ 9 ) hit the 1 / 3 inside 6 times and made three riders possible .
it was only his third successful start in his last nine games .
&quot; I want to end this year strongly , &quot; &quot; said Simon . &quot;
&quot; it is hard to throw in the bull@@ pen of every game , and therefore I want to go very concentrated into the game . &quot;
&quot; the designed tiger h@@ itter Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z had three hits and was in two ranks , his first r@@ bis since mid @-@ August . &quot;
&quot; it was the first hit game by Mart@@ ine@@ z , since he had four hits against the Seattle Marine on July 6th . &quot;
&quot; he turned the be@@ ech well , &quot; &quot; Aus@@ mus said . &quot;
&quot; he looked good at ( impact training ) , looked much better off in the bull@@ pen , and he brought it straight to the game . &quot;
&quot; with three steps at the end of the seventh interior , the Tw@@ ins had their best chance to come back into play . &quot;
center Fiel@@ der By@@ ron Bu@@ x@@ ton finished the inning with a double on the left field line .
&quot; right Fiel@@ der Aaron H@@ icks reached a Bun@@ t , and Simon brought his second Baz@@ eman Brian Do@@ zier to Stri@@ ke@@ out before being replaced by the lef@@ th@@ anded Bla@@ ine Har@@ dy . &quot;
&quot; Har@@ dy crossed the wall , the only man with whom he was confronted , in front of the design@@ ate R@@ ook@@ ie @-@ Schlag@@ mann Miguel S@@ ano , who gave the right @-@ handed Dre@@ w Ver@@ hagen a two @-@ run . &quot;
&quot; with a pair of runners and the finish @-@ run at the second , Ver@@ hagen brought the third Bas@@ eman Tre@@ vor Pl@@ ou@@ ffe to a double play . &quot;
it was the 27th time in the Major League this season that Pl@@ ou@@ ffe proposed a Double Play
&quot; after Detroit added an Insurance @-@ Run at the end of the ninth inside , wall secured a R@@ BI double against the C@@ loser of the Tig@@ ers Bruce Ron@@ don and achieved the stand of 5 @-@ 4 . &quot;
&quot; the right @-@ handed , however , puts S@@ ano on three Pit@@ ches for his fifth Save . &quot;
Detroit drove to the pr@@ el@@ ude of the game by an even non @-@ mo@@ vable Phil Hu@@ gh@@ es .
&quot; the tig@@ ers scored three R@@ uns in the first two inside against the right @-@ handed veter@@ an , who had been das@@ hed before the game from the vulner@@ ability list after he was missing for more than a month because of a back @-@ suffering . &quot;
&quot; obviously not the beginning I wanted , &quot; Hu@@ gh@@ es said , &quot; but I felt better when I got started and felt that I would create some pretty good pit@@ ches in the third inning . &quot;
&quot; after receiving the Le@@ ad@@ off Bat@@ ter , Hus@@ him gave a single to Second Bas@@ eman Ian Kin@@ dle . &quot;
&quot; a Two @-@ Out Walk for J@@ .D. Mart@@ ine@@ z brought Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z into the game , who created a single &quot; up the middle &quot; at the first run of the game . &quot;
Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z created his 0 @-@ 21 success story with the runners in the Scor@@ ing position .
&quot; the third Bas@@ eman Nick Castell@@ anos followed a single at the right side , managed another run , but Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z was thrown out of the game when he tried to reach the third , which ended the threat . &quot;
the tig@@ ers put in the second one @-@ out Double by Cat@@ cher James Mc@@ C@@ ann and a Two @-@ Out single from Center @-@ Fiel@@ der Anthony G@@ ose for 3 @-@ 0 .
&quot; that was a big blow , &quot; said Tw@@ ins @-@ Manager Paul Mol@@ itor . &quot;
&quot; he did not hit very well , but he caught the right place . &quot;
&quot; Hu@@ gh@@ es was in a Pit@@ ch Count , scored no points in the third inning before being replaced by the reli@@ ever right @-@ handed A.@@ J.@@ A@@ chter . &quot;
at Hu@@ gh@@ es there were three steps with six hits and a walk with four stro@@ ke@@ outs .
ann@@ ot@@ ations : tig@@ ers R@@ HP Ani@@ bal San@@ che@@ z retired due to injury of the throwing shoulder .
he was examined by Dr. James Andre@@ ws who operated the S@@ hou@@ l@@ der of San@@ che@@ z in 2007 .
&quot; sorry , there is no translation for this news @-@ article . &quot;
&quot; with San@@ che@@ z from the game , L@@ HP Daniel Morris is removed from the vulner@@ ability list to start the Tw@@ ins . &quot;
Nor@@ ris with 1 @-@ 1 at four starts with the Tig@@ ers since he was acquired in exchange with L@@ HP David Price on 30 July
he was lacking since 20 August because of a distor@@ tion in the right hip joint .
the Tig@@ ers and Tw@@ ins will end their series of three games in Target Field on Wednesday
&quot; Nor@@ ris ( 2 @-@ 2.@@ 4.@@ 43 ERA ) will play against Minn@@ es@@ ot@@ as R@@ HP Er@@ vin Sant@@ ana ( 5 @-@ 4 , 4.@@ 73 ) &quot;
hundreds of refugees are to be accommod@@ ated in Wiesbaden
a train with hundreds of refugees is on the way to H@@ esse .
his arrival was expected for the night on Wednesday .
&quot; the most excited people will then be accommod@@ ated in emergency shel@@ ters in Wiesbaden , such as the city of Wiesbaden on Tuesday evening . &quot;
they reck@@ oned with 450 to 750 incoming refugees .
several sports halls of the Hes@@ sian capital have been prepared for this event in recent days .
up to 1000 refugees can temporarily stay there .
they should then be distributed to other municipalities .
&quot; in the past ten days alone , according to the government president G@@ ießen 7@@ 500 people had arrived in H@@ esse for the first time . &quot;
&quot; due to the large number of refugees , Frankfurt and Han@@ au have set up emergency shel@@ ters in sports halls . &quot;
Isch@@ inger : German military interventions in Syria an option
&quot; the head of the Munich Security Conference , Wolfgang Isch@@ inger , holds military measures with German involvement in Syria for a possibility . &quot;
&quot; I believe the decisive re@@ thinking about military action options must not take place without Germany , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; he proposed &quot; &quot; collective departure &quot; &quot; to the European states . &quot;
&quot; four years ago , one was glad that the Chal@@ ice passed a military involvement in Germany . &quot;
&quot; now the conflict ends in front of our door@@ step , &quot; he said in Deutschl@@ and@@ funk . &quot;
the former German ambassador in Washington also called for a massive increase in international aid on the ground for refugees .
Austria controls on southern and eastern borders
&quot; after Germany , Austria once again introduced controls to its southern and eastern borders . &quot;
&quot; the Austrian Minister of Interior Johanna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner explained on Tuesday evening in the Austrian television station OR@@ F , after Hungary no one will be sent back . &quot;
&quot; in Germany , too , no refugees sent back to Austria . &quot;
&quot; no , it is agreed , &quot; she explained . &quot;
&quot; on the question of an agreement in which Germany could take a certain number of refugees from Austria a day , Mik@@ l Leit@@ ner said , there have already been discussions between the General Director for Public Security and the representatives of Germany . &quot;
she did not call on concrete figures and pointed out talks on Wednesday in Berlin .
&quot; in recent days , tens of thousands of refugees have come to Austria about the so @-@ called Bal@@ kan@@ route from Hungary to Austria . &quot;
their goal is usually Germany .
Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) and her Austrian colleague Werner F@@ ay@@ mann asked for a special summit next week with several other EU heads of state and government .
Germany had begun on Sunday with temporary border controls .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the EU states have not yet to agree on a joint action in the crisis . &quot;
&quot; the EU interior ministers plan to take a new approach to the binding distribution of further 120,000 refugees next Tuesday ( 22 September ) at a special meeting . &quot;
&quot; in view of the strong refugee disaster in Germany , the federal government wants to support the countries in the initial up@@ take and distribution of people . &quot;
&quot; the Con@@ federation will manage this together with the countries , and in the late afternoon , Merkel said after almost four hours of deliber@@ ations with the Prime Ministers in the Chancellor &apos;s office in Berlin . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , Merkel under@@ lined , those people who need protection , also conf@@ ess it . &quot;
&quot; but who does not have a lead perspective , cannot remain in Germany . &quot;
this opinion was strongly divided in the round .
the chan@@ cell@@ or emphas@@ ised that the state as a whole must now cope with a &quot; huge effort . &quot;
thousands of des@@ perate refugees are meanwhile stuck on the Bal@@ kan@@ route .
&quot; in the night of Tuesday , Hungary closed its 175 kilometres long border with Serbia . &quot;
&quot; a few hours later , the government in Budapest announced the border to Romania with a fence . &quot;
this neighbour country is different from Serbia to the EU .
Hungary wanted to prevent smu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers seeking ev@@ asive routes across Romania said Hungary &apos;s Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to to the planned new border fence .
the Romanian Government immediately condemned the plan .
there were first ar@@ rests of people who had cut the fence .
&quot; in Turkey , meanwhile , thousands of migrant workers report@@ edly made their way to the Greek border . &quot;
room probe &quot; Cass@@ ini &quot; finds ocean on Satur@@ n@@ mond En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us
beneath the ice @-@ p@@ anz@@ er of the Satur@@ n@@ monds En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us sw@@ app@@ ts a global ocean .
these include researchers from observations of the space probe &quot; Cass@@ ini . &quot;
&quot; accordingly , the Moon po@@ urs slightly on its way around the ring planets . &quot;
&quot; this exchange movement is only small , but still too large for a consistent body of cel@@ esti@@ al bodies , it is said in a communication by the Corn@@ ell University in I@@ th@@ aca ( US state New York ) from Tuesday . &quot;
the researchers present their analyses in the &quot; I@@ car@@ us &quot; specialist .
it was already known that there must be liquid water under the ice sheet of En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us .
&quot; so &quot; Cass@@ ini &quot; had already discovered ice @-@ vul@@ can@@ es at the south pole of the Satur@@ n@@ monds in 2006 , feed the steam and ice particles , and thus feed the so @-@ called E @-@ ring of Saturn . &quot;
&quot; at least at the South Pole , there had to be a sub@@ terranean sea , the astronom@@ ers included back then . &quot;
&quot; however , the expansion of the hidden ocean was not clear . &quot;
R@@ ama missing in 1860 München several weeks
the 1860 München must ab@@ stain from Val@@ det R@@ ama for about a month .
&quot; a study commissioned an ad@@ duc@@ tor injury during the 27 @-@ year @-@ old year , distributed by the association . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the week , R@@ ama compl@@ ained about pain . &quot;
&quot; according to Munich , the diagnosis is expected for four weeks . &quot;
&quot; that makes us difficult , R@@ ama is a heart@@ y loss . &quot;
&quot; of course , we have to think now , &quot; said sports director N@@ ec@@ at Ay@@ gü@@ n the &quot; Bild &quot; newspaper with a view to the possible commitment of un@@ met professionals . &quot;
&quot; as a train@@ ee , the six@@ ties initially presented a de@@ fl@@ ator . &quot;
the 30 year old Hr@@ vo@@ je C@@ ale was last active in Belgium and was already under contract at the V@@ f@@ L Wolfs@@ burg .
&quot; at present , the Cro@@ ate has the possibility to prove his skill . &quot;
&quot; after his conc@@ ussion , Tor@@ hunter Rubin Ok@@ ot@@ ie will return to the club@@ team again next week . &quot;
&quot; already on Thursday , the Austrian national player should enter running training . &quot;
&quot; in the game at Fort@@ una Düsseldorf ( 0 : 3 ) , Ok@@ ot@@ ie was hurt by a violent clas@@ h in the head . &quot;
&quot; contrary to the first fears , however , he remained without a serious threat . &quot;
no diet fruit - man@@ goes contain a lot of sugar
man@@ goes are exotic and ju@@ icy @-@ sweet .
&quot; but he who wants to pay attention to his slim line , is often rather dis@@ cour@@ aged by them . &quot;
because man@@ goes contain relatively much sugar - especially sac@@ char@@ ose .
&quot; the exotic fruits are healthy : in them B vitamins , as well as vitamins E and C. Also , man@@ goes contain a lot of vitamin A and its prec@@ urs@@ or beta car@@ ot@@ ene . &quot;
&quot; whoever e@@ ats the fruits thus supports ten@@ acity , immune system , and metabolic processes in the body . &quot;
&quot; when buying , man@@ goes should not be too soft or too firm and pleas@@ antly smell . &quot;
&quot; the color of the shell alone does not say anything about how ripe the fruit is , so also green man@@ gos can taste delicious . &quot;
they should store at room temperature and be consumed within a few days .
&quot; then they taste , of course , pure or in sweet foods . &quot;
&quot; however , a man@@ go gives a special note also to sav@@ ory dishes . &quot;
it sof@@ tens the slightly bitter taste of some leaf salads such as Chi@@ cor@@ ee and Radi@@ c@@ cio .
&quot; and a Man@@ go@@ ch@@ ut@@ ney fits well to fish , poultry , lamb and game . &quot;
&quot; for the Christmas business in the USA , the US @-@ parcel service U@@ PS will re@@ charge up to 95@@ 000 aid . &quot;
&quot; the company already started the recruitment of seasonal workers , U@@ PS announced on Tuesday . &quot;
especially drivers are looking for .
&quot; last year , U@@ PS had raised its staff for the holiday season around 95@@ 000 aid . &quot;
&quot; in view of the bo@@ oming online business , U@@ PS and his competi@@ tor Fed@@ Ex meet for past year earlier to be ready for the Christmas business . &quot;
&quot; in 2013 , delayed deliveries had brought harsh criticism . &quot;
&quot; first Com@@ promise Tower , then prominent cold front &quot;

&quot; on Wednesday and during the night to Thursday , the fo@@ eh@@ n b@@ lows partly with a stub@@ ble strength through the cham@@ ber@@ ing valleys . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday morning we cross a prominent cold front , which brings powerful ra@@ inf@@ alls , wind ar@@ ches and a temperature decline . &quot;
&quot; as Met@@ e@@ o@@ News writes in a message , Switzerland is currently on the front of an extensive grav@@ ure area over the British Is@@ les in a strong southwest flow . &quot;
on the Alp@@ enn@@ ord@@ side it breaks through the valleys at night to Wednesday .
&quot; in the episode , the F@@ öh@@ n b@@ lows into the com@@ promis@@ ers with the slopes of 60 to 100 km / h , occasionally and especially in the Ur@@ i land sometimes with more than 100 km / h . &quot;
&quot; the fo@@ eh@@ n can penet@@ rate into the adjacent middle of the middle , and on the mountains even organs are possible by more than 120 km / h . &quot;
&quot; while in the north on Wednesday stor@@ my f@@ öh@@ n provides summer temperatures of 23 to 27 degrees , humidity begins to st@@ ow at the alpine slope . &quot;
&quot; here is the rain , which lasts until Thursday evening . &quot;
&quot; in total , in the south of the Alps in the next 48 hours with some more than 100 liters of rain per square meter , this has already fallen in large ra@@ inf@@ all . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday morning the fo@@ eh@@ n leaves the air , in the episode rolls a cold front with powerful , partly hum@@ orous rain from west to east via Switzerland . &quot;
&quot; together with the cold front the wind is refreshing to stor@@ my temperatures , and temperatures drop considerably . &quot;
&quot; the following days present themselves in the north with 15 to 20 degrees , in the south on the other hand it becomes sunny and warmer with up to 25 degrees . &quot;
Rome now has a Martin @-@ Luther @-@ Platz
&quot; almost 500 years after the Reformation , there is now a Martin @-@ Luther @-@ Platz in Rome . &quot;
&quot; in the presence of President Ign@@ azi@@ o Marino , a previously nam@@ eless place in the park on the Opp@@ io Hill was chri@@ sten@@ ed on the name of the German Re@@ former . &quot;
&quot; in the &quot; Piazza Martin Lu@@ ter@@ o , &quot; he is now honoured as a &quot; German the@@ ologi@@ an of the Reformation . &quot; &quot;
the park is located in the middle of the old Rome next to the Col@@ os@@ se@@ um .
the nam@@ ing had been requested by the work community of the Evangel@@ ical churches in Rome .
&quot; Jens @-@ Martin Kr@@ use , pastor of the Evangel@@ ical Lutheran Church in Rome , rec@@ alled that Protest@@ ants in the city of the Pop@@ es were often only able to live in seclu@@ sion for centuries as a minority . &quot;
the square is symbo@@ lically visible that their tradition of Christian faith is welcome in Rome .
Martin Luther ( 14@@ 83 @-@ 15@@ 46 ) considered himself a young August@@ inian mon@@ k at the turn of the year 15@@ 10 / 11 a few months in Rome .
&quot; at that time , he perceived the city as a sin@@ ful sc@@ ap@@ ego@@ at . &quot;
his negative impressions might have strengthened him in the view of historians in his later battle against Rome .
Luther then initiated the division of the Western Church with his thes@@ es against the wholesale trade .
hammer Artist invested three years into the personal interpretation of the Bible
Jesus with the ( gold @-@ plated ) Dorn@@ enk@@ rone is one of the main works that Ot@@ mar Alt has painted for his Bible .
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost has written the introduction and updated Bible texts .
in the beginning was the Word ?
&quot; no , not at the Ot@@ mar Old Bible , which is now published with splendid pictures . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning was the image for Ot@@ mar Alt , which in 150 designs formulated his very personal interpre@@ tations of biblical stories on paper and canvas . &quot;
&quot; his &quot; language &quot; with colorful colors and imagin@@ ative forms has received the 75 year old - but what is by no means syn@@ onymous with &quot; &quot; funny &quot; &quot; pictures . &quot;
&quot; on the contrary : adapted to the respective topics , this may seem quite dark . &quot;
&quot; for about three years , Ot@@ mar Alt has worked on his Bible project for which he has made a subjective @-@ artistic selection from the many subject areas of the &quot; book of all books . &quot; &quot;
&quot; cycles arose which dedic@@ ate themselves to topics like crus@@ hing , pl@@ agues , bi@@ ds or fa@@ ther@@ es . &quot;
&quot; in this way , he immediately fascinated several partners : this applies to Luther @-@ Verlag with its the@@ ological orientation , as well as for the Kettler publishing house with its emphasis on art books . &quot;
&quot; and there is above all the author Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost , who has dealt with the respective Bible points based on painting . &quot;
&quot; he interpreted the biblical passages selected by Ot@@ mar Alt and translated into present , into current contex@@ ts . &quot;
these texts are like verbal mirror of Al@@ ts painting .
&quot; they are embedded between the original scrip@@ ture of Martin Luther and each one of the artist , who formulated his own personal thoughts on the situation here . &quot;
the jewelry cord has golden letters .
&quot; thus , the 75 @-@ year @-@ old gives twice a deep insight into his soul , his emotions . &quot;
this is a high degree of intim@@ acy .
&quot; emotions were ultimately the trigger for the Bible project : Ot@@ mar Alt , born 1940 in Wer@@ ni@@ ger@@ ode and grew up in Berlin , comes from a family owned by the strict Protestant Herr@@ n@@ h@@ uter Or@@ ders . &quot;
&quot; then education started with the pipe @-@ stick , &quot; &quot; rec@@ alls Oth@@ mar Alt . &quot;
&quot; I tried to re@@ vise this , in order to get me back with the Lord &apos;s Father again . &quot;
&quot; his second concern is to revi@@ ve art at a faster time : &quot; &quot; the perception of picture worlds is shaped by advertising today , and it is loud . &quot;
symbol@@ ism is displac@@ ed .
artists have a different desire and pleasure to show things .
pictures always have something mysterious and are not decorative .
&quot; in this respect , I am a din@@ osau@@ r . &quot;
&quot; Ot@@ mar Alt wants the viewer to fall into the images , letting them look , discover and feel the power they have : &quot; the image searches for its counter@@ part . &quot;
&quot; Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost was on Tuesday at the presentation of the Ot@@ mar Old Bible in the Ot@@ mar Old Foundation , &quot; &quot; always &quot; &quot; a lover of Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts art has been to be : &quot; &quot; I like how he understands life with his paintings . &quot;
&quot; I didn &apos;t care to fully capture the Bible , but also chosen the mysterious themes for him . &quot;
&quot; this was no cooperation at eye level , &quot; says Alt@@ ep@@ ost : &quot; here it is about the images , the text merely explains . &quot; &quot;
&quot; for Hans Mö@@ h@@ ler from Luther @-@ Verlag , this work is an invitation to deep@@ en his life and find freedom . &quot;
Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts pictures speak for Mö@@ h@@ ler both the ( biblical ) language of love and responsibility .
part of the origin@@ als - paper and canvas prints - will be presented for the first time in an exhibition opened on 15 November in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Stiftung .
start of construction for BM@@ X @-@ Bahn
&quot; a year later , almost everything was done - but before the official opening of the BM@@ X @-@ Bahn it was already finished . &quot;
&quot; om@@ issions in politics and administration took care of , especially among the residents who didn &apos;t want to toler@@ ate the train . &quot;
&quot; so Hill dep@@ orted , new place searched - now with formal planning and application for building permit . &quot;
&quot; the approval was given in October , the first municipal coun@@ cill@@ or Sabine Mos@@ eb@@ ach @-@ Bo@@ ck was able to share in the Children &apos;s and Youth Committee . &quot;
&quot; I hope this year is still visible , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; it should then be started without &quot; &quot; another commemor@@ ative break &quot; &quot; with the works of the former indoor pool . &quot;
DF@@ B intensi@@ fies commitment to refugees
&quot; the DF@@ B wi@@ dens its commitment to refugees up to 2019 , making the Bundes@@ liga a clear sign for the weekend . &quot;
the football respon@@ ds to the conflic@@ ting situation in Germany and ass@@ ures the policy its help in dealing with the problems pending .
&quot; I think this is the biggest challenge of our country since the re@@ unification . &quot;
&quot; there can no one say in principle , that &apos;s nothing to me , I have nothing to do with it . &quot;
&quot; this has to be of interest to everyone to get a grip on this issue , &quot; said DF@@ B boss Wolfgang Nier@@ sbach . &quot;
&quot; at the annual meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel on 23 September in Berlin , he wants to discuss the refugee situation in Germany intensively . &quot;
&quot; I am the next Wednesday in the chan@@ cell@@ or office and meet the Minister of State , Mrs. Ö@@ zo@@ ğ@@ u@@ z and the chan@@ cell@@ or . &quot;
&quot; the subject will certainly play a central role , &quot; he announced . &quot;
football can and wants to help .
but the decisive turn@@ out must be policy .
the German Football League has therefore extended its refugee initiative &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; for four years .
&quot; through the E@@ gi@@ di@@ us @-@ Braun Foundation , we have ensured that this programme continues until 2019 , &quot; &quot; declared Nier@@ sbach at the edge of the UEF@@ A meeting in St. Julian &apos;s / Malta . &quot;
some federal states also support this program .
&quot; already on this weekend , the 36 professionals place a clear sign when they will wear the print &quot; We help - # Refu@@ ge@@ es@@ Welcome &quot; instead of the usual sponsor@@ ing logo ( Her@@ mes ) instead of the usual sponsor@@ ing logo ( Her@@ mes ) . &quot;
&quot; we want to make it clear that everyone should help wherever and how they can , &quot; said Le@@ verk@@ usen , Sports Director Ru@@ di Völ@@ ler of the &quot; Bild &quot; newspaper ( Tuesday ) and described the project as &quot; self @-@ evident . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the drama @-@ drama goes everyone , nobody is allowed to see . &quot;
&quot; we can use football feder@@ ations , no , we must use our radi@@ ance , influence and opportunities to help the many refugees who have already suffered so incredibly , &quot; &quot; said Her@@ tha @-@ Manager Michael Pre@@ etz . &quot;
H@@ offen@@ hei@@ ms Managing Director Peter Ret@@ tig spoke of a &quot; prominent sign of the league . &quot;
the national team of women invites 100 refugees to Halle / Sa@@ ale for the European Championship of Quali@@ fication against Hungary on Friday .
&quot; Nier@@ sbach described the support of refugees as &quot; &quot; a large common work of German football . &quot; &quot; &quot;
that all 36 lic@@ en@@ se@@ ers had started their own projects in their places was great .
just as great is that small and smallest clubs are active .
&quot; the message &quot; &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; &quot; that we have spent will live in football . &quot;
&quot; this is of enormous importance , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; in this and next year , the association together with the DF@@ B selection and the federal government provides 300 000 euros each for the integration of refugees . &quot;
&quot; the clubs have already sum@@ mon@@ ed the whole sum for 2015 , &quot; said Nier@@ sbach . &quot;
reports : CEO of SAP loses an eye in case of accident
&quot; the Chief Executive Officer of Europe &apos;s largest software company , Bill Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t , report@@ edly lost the left eye by a crash at the beginning of July . &quot;
&quot; after midnight on the stairs in the house of his brother in the USA , he had fallen on a water glass after midnight , which he carried in the left hand , reports the &quot; Wirtschafts@@ Woche &quot; on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; he is almost blood @-@ bloo@@ ded , impot@@ ent , then tow@@ ed on the road - that he told us last week , &quot; quoted the &quot; W@@ IW@@ O &quot; SAP co @-@ founder Has@@ so Platt@@ ner . &quot;
but Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t could follow his job .
&quot; at the beginning of October we meet at the &quot; &quot; Pil@@ gri@@ m Meeting &quot; &quot; meeting in Wall@@ dorf , &quot; &quot; said Platt@@ ner . &quot;
the 54 year old manager is at the meeting and &quot; fully operational . &quot;
&quot; Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t announced in an interview with the &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; ( Thursday edition ) , he will return to Germany in October and will continue to run the software company . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m full for SAP , full in my job . &quot;
&quot; of course , I was in regular contact with the Supervisory Board and its chairman Has@@ so Platt@@ ner , &quot; said Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t of the &quot; SZ . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t usually comm@@ utes between Germany and the USA , but since summer he was no longer in the German SAP headquarters in Wall@@ dorf . &quot;
&quot; it is important to him to go public with such personal history , said the manager of the &quot; &quot; SZ &quot; &quot; : &quot; &quot; everyone can happen . &quot;
it is important to stop again when you are fallen .
Mc@@ L@@ aren @-@ Re@@ placement pilot Magn@@ us@@ sen apart from combat ...

&quot; therefore , in Singapore on weekends , he is just as little as a reserve tainer for the two common boats Fernando Al@@ on@@ so and J@@ enson Button inter@@ rog@@ ated , as a week later at the Grand Prix of Japan . &quot;
football : BV@@ B without Re@@ us against Kr@@ as@@ no@@ dar : Weiden@@ f@@ eller in the gate
&quot; at Bor@@ us@@ sia Dortmund , all hopes of a com@@ eback of Marco Re@@ us will finally break down in the first group game of the Europa League . &quot;
the national player will also be missing the championship leader of the Bundes@@ liga in the du@@ el with the FK Kr@@ as@@ no@@ dar on Thursday ( 07.@@ 00 p.m. / Sky ) .
&quot; unfortunately we cannot fall back on him , &quot; &quot; said Thomas Tu@@ chel on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; whether Re@@ us will be back on Sunday in the Bundes@@ liga @-@ Top@@ game against Le@@ verk@@ usen , the BV@@ B coach open : &quot; we reck@@ on with a return from him to the training on Friday . &quot;
&quot; in view of the high load of his pro@@ s , Tu@@ chel is not only able to change his master eleven on the Re@@ us position . &quot;
&quot; in this way , he announced a change on the door@@ mat position . &quot;
&quot; therefore , Roman Weiden@@ f@@ eller takes the place from the master keeper Roman Bür@@ ki . &quot;
&quot; he trains at an absolute top level , &quot; the football teacher praised the World Champion . &quot;
&quot; however , if wil@@ low fin@@ ery is used in all Europe @-@ league games in the future , however , Tu@@ ck left open . &quot;
&quot; with high probability , he will also contest the second game . &quot;
&quot; the for@@ en@@ sic message by Mit@@ chel Re@@ us , that the final entry for the BV@@ B in the Europa League must be the goal , will keep Julian Wei@@ gl for understandable : &quot; &quot; this is not so wrong . &quot;
I think we have a good chance to pick up the title .
Robot@@ er@@ au@@ tos : government wants leadership for Germany
&quot; according to the will of the Federal Government , Germany should be a pioneer in the change of cars . &quot;
&quot; on Wednesday , the Federal Cab@@ inet decided to draft a strategy paper from the House of Transport Minister Alexander Do@@ brin@@ dt ( CS@@ U ) , which among other things fores@@ ees investments in the expansion of digital infrastructure . &quot;
&quot; Do@@ brin@@ dt spoke on Wednesday in Frankfurt at the edge of the Autom@@ esse I@@ AA from a &quot; &quot; new mobility era &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; automated and connected driving will increase traffic safety and provide less traffic , said Do@@ brin@@ dt . &quot;
&quot; he wants to discuss the issue with his colleagues from the G@@ 7 states , who also come together with industry representatives at the I@@ AA . &quot;
&quot; the strategy paper of the Department of Transport , among other things , highlights the importance of mobile broad@@ band expansion and rapid access to digital radio . &quot;
a test track on the motorway 9 in Bavaria is currently being tested for testing new technology .
&quot; in order for the driver to be &quot; &quot; no additional liability risks &quot; , &quot; the federal government wants to review the legal framework conditions and , where necessary , to adapt to the new developments . &quot;
&quot; for example , Germany wants to use internationally for the per@@ missible maximum speed for self @-@ prop@@ elled cars from 10 to 130 km / h . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the Federal Government wants to introduce itself to a change in the Vienna Convention , which so far only fores@@ ees the human being as a driver . &quot;
&quot; when driving automated driving , the car takes over the lead , the driver becomes more and more to the passenger . &quot;
the technology is based primarily on sensors and cameras that capture the environment and process the data in seconds .
&quot; according to a study commissioned by the Ministry of Economy , highly automated driving on motor@@ ways by 2020 will be technically possible . &quot;
&quot; nonetheless , dri@@ ver@@ less vehicles on public roads are expected to be expected only far after 2020 . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; the digital networking of the car can lead to greater safety and efficiency in road traffic , &quot; said the SPD traffic politi@@ cian S@@ ör@@ en Bar@@ to@@ l . &quot;
&quot; however , the question of liability in accidents and the safety of the personal data of the drivers must be clearly clari@@ fied . &quot;
&quot; however , the German self @-@ prop@@ elled cars still look skep@@ tical - much more than French or Americans . &quot;

&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; anyway , drivers in Germany are not ready to rely completely on a self @-@ prop@@ elled vehicle . &quot;
&quot; following a survey by Bit@@ kom , only seven percent would agree to give control during the entire trip on all roads . &quot;
&quot; at least 15 percent could be seen on the motorway , in the traffic jam 45 percent . &quot;
good every fourth would not leave control to the car under any circumstances .
B@@ oll says team and double start at ping @-@ p@@ ong EM
&quot; according to the current status of the title fight between September 25 and October 4 , Düssel@@ dorfer wishes to open only in singles . &quot;
the final decision should be taken at the latest on September 22 .
&quot; this is a huge loss for our team . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the guys experienced it in the morning . &quot;
&quot; but we are strong enough to get the title without Timo , &quot; said Bun@@ de@@ eps Jörg Ro@@ ß@@ kopf during the EM course in Düsseldorf . &quot;
&quot; at that time , B@@ oll was on the flight to a long @-@ term sponsor@@ ship date in China . &quot;
the 34 year old German master is expected to come back on Friday .
&quot; without Timo is the dis@@ advantage , we are no longer such a clear favorite , &quot; said Ein@@ zel @-@ Europ@@ am@@ ei@@ ster Dimit@@ ri@@ j Ov@@ t@@ char@@ ov . &quot;
&quot; Ham@@ el@@ ner , who runs the S@@ etz@@ ler in Y@@ ek@@ ater@@ in@@ burg , also remembered the EM 2013 in Sch@@ wech@@ at . &quot;
&quot; at that time Timo also was lacking , and we became European Champion . &quot;

Gau@@ l@@ tier feels too old for an en@@ f@@ ant terrible
it is a mixture of very large fashion show and a wax figures gr@@ us@@ el@@ kab@@ in@@ ett : the designer Jean Paul Gau@@ l@@ tier ( 63 ) presented an exhibition on Wednesday in Munich about his work .
&quot; the highlights : SCH@@ AU@@ F@@ EN@@ STER@@ NE , which terri@@ bly looks human thanks to video proj@@ ections . &quot;
&quot; they wear the spectacular creations of the French designer , who , among other things , became the big star in the fashion scene with Mad@@ onn@@ as stage out@@ fits - and that he put men in skir@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; today , I cannot say that I am the en@@ f@@ ant terrible of Haute Cou@@ ture because I have white hair . &quot;
&quot; it used to be easy , now it &apos;s real , &quot; &quot; said Gau@@ l@@ tier . &quot;
&quot; for the visitors of the exhibition &quot; From The Side@@ walk To The Cat@@ walk &quot; ( From the side@@ walk to the cat@@ walk ) , which is to be seen from 18 September to the Kunsth@@ alle der Hyp@@ o Kultur@@ stiftung , it is a good luck that the fashion designer has changed his initially rejected attitude towards a show about his person . &quot;
&quot; actually he was against it , for : &quot; for me an exhibition so@@ unded a bit of death , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; when you die , you come to the museum . &quot;
the impressive collection had already been made in the Canadian Montreal and Paris Station .
&quot; it &apos;s all about so much more than just beautiful clothes , &quot; said the director of the Kunsth@@ alle , Roger C@@ her . &quot;
&quot; it is about tolerance , acceptance and the vision of an open society . &quot;
&quot; the exhibits give an insight into the hardly ever @-@ looking work of the man , who has written fashion history without ever having completed an apprentic@@ eship . &quot;
&quot; chron@@ ologically , the show is not built up , but it is an excell@@ ently chore@@ ograph@@ ed overall artwork , for which a lot of effort was used : to refres@@ h the dolls , for example , a sty@@ list was engaged . &quot;
14 tons of material have ar@@ red the makers according to the cur@@ ator Thierry @-@ Maxim@@ e L@@ ori@@ ot in Munich .
shortly before the start of the Oktober@@ fest there was still a special delic@@ acy : a leather pants outfit with cor@@ set .
Hei@@ di meets Madonna .
&quot; he is always interested in strong women ( &quot; &quot; women are smar@@ ter than men &quot; &quot; ) and for people who are a bit different , said Gau@@ l@@ tier . &quot;
also Gau@@ l@@ tiers old Teddy can be seen in the exhibition .
&quot; he stands for the first , agile , fashion gro@@ oming of the designer . &quot;
&quot; as a child ( he was not a good student and bad in football ) he put on his Teddy B@@ H@@ s and clothes , said Gau@@ l@@ tier . &quot;
&quot; playing with a doll , his parents wouldn &apos;t have allowed him . &quot;
he later taught the design of fashion .
he ste@@ ered fashion magazines and looked at the designs of other designers as Gau@@ l@@ tier told in Munich .
later I bought them but of course .
for his first own fashion show he did not have to pay the models .
&quot; they got nothing , but they were allowed to keep the clothes . &quot;
jewelry instead of curtain - P@@ lau@@ ener Spitze as fashion @-@ niche
&quot; in the past , we went to the long embroi@@ dery machines in and around P@@ lau@@ en to make meters . &quot;
&quot; the embroi@@ dered fabrics and tips ar@@ isen in large quantities for customers , which they processed for example to blan@@ kets and she@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; this alone does not work anymore , explains Andreas Rein@@ hardt , Managing Director of Mo@@ desp@@ itze P@@ lau@@ en . &quot;
&quot; instead , fashion is important again . &quot;
&quot; in the early times of the P@@ lau@@ ener Spitze mode , fashion plays a major role , was then displac@@ ed by the home textiles industry - and is now being re@@ discovered as a niche . &quot;
&quot; Rein@@ hardt calls for some examples : lace in jewelry , with accessories such as bags and for regional costumes . &quot;
&quot; in general , the so @-@ called vintage fashion , which leans against past styles , is an increasing order potential . &quot;
anyone who has no niche in the textile sector in Germany is no longer on the market .
&quot; with us , they already make half of all jobs . &quot;
&quot; together with nine other companies , Mo@@ desp@@ itze P@@ lau@@ en is a member of the P@@ lau@@ en lace and embroi@@ dery industry association . &quot;
only they must bear the protected label .
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
private specialty shops and wholesale markets are almost no longer available .
our products hardly reach the customer in this way .
&quot; nowadays , the mass @-@ ware is produced much cheaper in the Asian region and almost exclusively sold over chains . &quot;
&quot; in addition , exports , current to Russia and the USA are weak@@ est . &quot;
so there are enough reasons for new ways .
&quot; the industry association also tries to score points on environmental awareness , as C@@ ord@@ ula Bauer explains of the nitrogen in Fal@@ k@@ enstein : &quot; since this year we are introducing a quality seal that shows that we produce ec@@ ologically and socially sustainable . &quot;
Rein@@ hardt adds : &quot; this also applies to the materials used .
graduate designer U@@ te Schmidt teaches at the Schne@@ eber@@ ger outdoor stage of the West@@ säch@@ s@@ ische Hochschule Z@@ wick@@ au - at the Faculty of Applied Arts - and is specialized in embroi@@ dery and lace .
&quot; in order to counter@@ act the competition from the Asian region , you have to find high @-@ quality and innovative products . &quot;
that takes time and courage .
&quot; there is a voltage field between the fresh@@ est ideas of the designers and the companies , which must first of all think economically , &quot; Schmidt says . &quot;
&quot; therefore , an existing design is often only slightly different to maintain a customer base . &quot;
&quot; a few years ago , Kat@@ i Re@@ uter , a textile designer , re@@ vit@@ alized the historical snow@@ ball tip . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , the machine sti@@ cks small cells at some places . &quot;
&quot; the P@@ lau@@ er gold@@ smith master@@ in Bianca H@@ alle@@ bach @-@ K@@ rau@@ ß was inspired by it : &quot; before , I could not start with traditional P@@ lau@@ ener &apos;s head . &quot;
now she uses the snow@@ ball tip for her jewelry .
in a complex procedure she shapes the pattern in silver .
&quot; many people in the region relate to the topic of &quot; &quot; P@@ lau@@ ener Spitze &quot; &quot; - young and old , &quot; &quot; says Re@@ uter . &quot;
&quot; it also supplies to the USA , Australia and Finland - mainly to customers who lived their ancestors in P@@ lau@@ en and the surrounding area and who would like to have a mem@@ or@@ and@@ um . &quot;
this means that I see my jewellery as a modern ambassador for the P@@ lau@@ en lace .
Disney plans new &quot; Mary P@@ opp@@ ins &quot; movie
&quot; one should not touch legends , but Disney is still vent@@ uring into a new film of his classic &quot; &quot; Mary P@@ opp@@ ins &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; according to &quot; &quot; Entertainment Week@@ ly &quot; , &quot; it is not about a new movie , but a continuation of the 20 years after the first film with the magic inf@@ est girl . &quot;
it is about the experiences of the N@@ anny with the B@@ anks in times of the world economic crisis in England .

&quot; but the director already states : Rob Marshall , last with &quot; In@@ to the W@@ oods &quot; in the cinema . &quot;
XI ur@@ ges to open the economy more broad@@ ly for the world
&quot; the economy must open broad to the outside to promote growth , President Xi Jin@@ ping said on Tuesday a group commissioned with the steering of reform . &quot;
&quot; China should advoc@@ ate foreign investment and know @-@ how and improve the strategies for business start @-@ ups , &quot; he said in a speech at the 16th meeting of the Central Executive Group for deep@@ ening a comprehensive reform . &quot;
&quot; encouraging new start @-@ ups and driving reforms will bring about new momentum and vitality and offer new place for economic growth , &quot; &quot; said Xi . &quot;
&quot; the management group has adopted a series of guidelines , including a negative list for the regulation of market access , relaxation of border controls policy , promotion of state enterprises ( SO@@ E ) , private capital , and over@@ hau@@ l of the population reporting system . &quot;
&quot; after the statement , a negative list will be created that identifies sectors and companies that are not eligible for investment . &quot;
the system is gradually tested and improved by test programs .
&quot; the initiative is of importance because it grants the market a greater role in the allocation of resources , guarantees a legally @-@ state business environment and designed the market more open , said the statement . &quot;
the government will also lo@@ osen controls on the powers transferred to the companies and make sure that companies decide how to conduct their business .
the statement also said that China will allow border regions to explore new models of cross @-@ border economic co @-@ operation and new mechanisms to promote regional growth .
&quot; in the context of an offer to open state controlled sectors , further areas for private investment will be opened . &quot;
&quot; the government will not change its policy towards foreign investments and will protect the legitimate interests of foreign enterprises and provide better services for them , &quot; said the Statement . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it is easier for foreigners to apply for permanent residence permit or &quot; &quot; Green Card &quot; &quot; by optimi@@ zing the requirements and making the application process easier . &quot;
&quot; the right of lawyers to guarantee their activity , and employ professional judges and prosec@@ ut@@ ors , was also discussed at a meeting . &quot;
Prime Minister Li Ke@@ q@@ i@@ ang and important leaders such as Li@@ u Y@@ un@@ shan and Z@@ hang Ga@@ oli also attended the meeting as reported in a declaration published after the meeting .
EU wants to double mer@@ cury limit value in pre@@ dat@@ ors
&quot; the European Commission wants to double the limit values for mer@@ cury in large pre@@ dat@@ ory fish , thereby depri@@ ving consumers a significantly higher dose of the tox@@ ins . &quot;
&quot; the consumer organisation food@@ watch , which has a corresponding EU working paper , sharp@@ ly critic@@ ised the plans : &quot; risks and side effects of missing industrial and environmental policy are passed on with full impact on pregnant women and inf@@ ants , &quot; explained Matthias Wolf@@ sch@@ midt of food@@ watch . &quot;
&quot; according to Wolf@@ sch@@ midt , the limit values of the nervous system for large fish should be raised at the end of the food chain such as shar@@ k or s@@ word@@ fish from one to two milli@@ grams of mer@@ cury per kil@@ ogram of fish . &quot;
&quot; however , large pre@@ dat@@ ory fishes are already so strongly charged with mer@@ cury that on the basis of the still valid limit values about 50 per cent of the cat@@ ches are not allowed to be sold . &quot;
&quot; after dou@@ bling the limit values , only 14.5 percent would be ru@@ de . &quot;
&quot; in return for this e@@ asing , the EU wants to ag@@ grav@@ ate the limit values for other fish from currently 0.5 milli@@ grams to 0.1 milli@@ grams of mer@@ cury per kil@@ ogram . &quot;
&quot; however , food@@ watch described this as &quot; trick &quot; because smaller c@@ low@@ n@@ fish , such as car@@ p , are usually so low that they already hold the planned peak values today . &quot;
&quot; the lowering of mon@@ ast@@ eries is therefore &quot; &quot; a per@@ fi@@ de de@@ fle@@ ction man@@ oeu@@ vre that helps the economy alone , &quot; &quot; explained Wolf@@ sch@@ midt . &quot;
mer@@ cury is a heavy metal that is highly poison@@ ous for humans that are strongly affected by the food chain in pre@@ dat@@ ory fish .
&quot; the Federal Government therefore war@@ ns that &quot; &quot; small amounts can be especially caused by inf@@ ant damage to the nervous system . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; on his homepage , the Federal Ministry of Education states that a &quot; health haz@@ ard of the general population &quot; is not to be expected . &quot;
mer@@ cury is mainly due to coal combustion in the environment .
&quot; according to a written information by the German Federal Ministry of Defence , the German coal @-@ fired power stations will come to the Green @-@ Bundestag Members of Ann@@ al@@ ena Ba@@ er@@ bock more than six tonnes of mer@@ cury in the year , two thirds of the total amount issued in Germany . &quot;
&quot; the concentration of mer@@ cury in fis@@ hings around Elbe , Rhine and Danube was &quot; permanently and nationwide crossed , &quot; had quoted the &quot; Spiegel &quot; in March from paper . &quot;
&quot; last year , Europe @-@ wide warning against mer@@ cury in fish were already among the most commonly reported health risks in the EU warning system RA@@ S@@ FF . &quot;
