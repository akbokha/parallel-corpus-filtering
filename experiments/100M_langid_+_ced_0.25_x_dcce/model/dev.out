Obama receives Net@@ any@@ ahu
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu is not just friendship .
the two wanted to talk about the implementation of the international agreement and T@@ eher@@ an dest@@ abili@@ zing measures in the Middle East .
&quot; in the meeting , however , there should be a conflict with the Palestinians and the two @-@ state solution discussed . &quot;
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu has been ten@@ se for years .
Washington critic@@ ises Israel &apos;s ongoing sett@@ ler assembly and raises Net@@ any@@ ahu &apos;s lack of will in the peace process .
&quot; by the deal struck by Obama about the Iranian nuclear programme , the relationship between the two has deteri@@ or@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; in March , Net@@ any@@ ahu held an controversial speech at the invitation of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans in front of the US Congress , which was partly considered an aff@@ ront to Obama . &quot;
&quot; the speech was not spoken with Obama , a meeting was rejected with reference to the upcoming election in Israel . &quot;
&quot; in an emergency call , Professor , to have shot his girl@@ friend &quot;
&quot; in an emergency call , Professor Sh@@ ann@@ on Lamb told the police that he shot his girl@@ friend and that the officials had to come to his house . &quot;
&quot; Lamb was important to emphasize that his &quot; sweet dog &quot; but still live and probably excited , and he said the family contacts of the dead woman could be found on the phone . &quot;
&quot; inside the house , the officials found the bodies of Amy Pr@@ enti@@ ss and a hand@@ written note that was cut on a white blo@@ c : &quot; I &apos;m sorry , I could undo it , I loved Amy and she is the only woman who ever loved me . &quot; this was signed by the authorities in the letter and he was signed by Lamb . &quot;
&quot; there was no indication that Lamb , who had traveled in two online courses for the Delta State University in Cle@@ vel@@ and , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , had already traveled 300 miles to the school premises , where he shot and killed a popular history professor , E@@ than Schmidt on the door to his office . &quot;
Delta State University Poli@@ zeich@@ ef Lyn@@ n Bu@@ ford said that university staff have heard the shooting at 10 : 18 .
he said that Lamb made the fatal emergency call some@@ time afterwards .
&quot; until the end of the day , there was another death : Lamb took the life when the police enc@@ ir@@ cl@@ ed him . &quot;
&quot; a day after shooting in the university , students and teachers forced to hide behind closed doors , the authorities still try to get a picture of what Lamb motiv@@ ates . &quot;
&quot; the details published by the investig@@ ators at both ends of the state , as well as what students and employees who knew him , helped to draw a picture of a talented , but possibly difficult teacher . &quot;
students said they were looking forward to his lessons .
&quot; the police in Gau@@ tier , where Pr@@ enti@@ ss died , said he had no history of violence or a criminal story . &quot;
&quot; Schmidt himself had mentioned Lamb in a book written by him in which he mentioned &quot; &quot; wonderful people &quot; &quot; with whom he shared his academic life . &quot;
&quot; both established in the department of social sciences and history , whose faculty comprises 17 members , and many students visited courses of both . &quot;
at the same time there were some tendencies to be problematic .
&quot; a student , Brand@@ on Be@@ a@@ vers , the Lamb praised , said he also appeared a little nervous and nervous , &quot; as if something was wrong with him . &quot;
&quot; another student , Mik@@ el Sy@@ kes , said that he told him that he had to do with stress at the end of the academic year 2014 @-@ 15 . &quot;
&quot; Lamb had previously asked the Delta State University for an absence of health reasons , saying that he had any health problem . &quot;
this year he only taught two online courses .
&quot; recent changes in the employment policy of the university meant that the promotion , for which Lamb had worked so hard , would not represent a guarantee for an automatic path to employment as Assistant Professor . &quot;
&quot; President William LA@@ FOR@@ GE said he didn &apos;t know anything about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs &apos;s performance . &quot;
these are questions that Lamb can no longer answer .
&quot; after the escape from the campus , the police later found Lam@@ bs track when he returned to Miss@@ issi@@ ppi from Ar@@ kan@@ s@@ as . &quot;
&quot; before he could be arrested , Lamb killed himself with a .@@ 38 cali@@ ber gun at the back@@ yard of a house about a mile south of his par@@ ental home on the outskirts of Green@@ ville , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , said Washington County Cor@@ oner Meth@@ el Johnson . &quot;
his car was still in the dri@@ v@@ eway .
&quot; it was not immediately clear why the Lamb went to this house , but Johnson said that he knew that he knew the people who lived there . &quot;
Lamb grew up in the area .
&quot; Lamb started his work at the university in 2009 , which has 3,@@ 500 students in a city with about 12@@ ,000 inhabitants and taught ge@@ ography and ped@@ agog@@ y . &quot;
he completed his doc@@ torate in the spring of ped@@ agog@@ y .
&quot; one of the long@@ time girl@@ friends Lam@@ bs described it as intelligent , charis@@ matic and funny . &quot;
&quot; Car@@ la H@@ air@@ ston said , she was 15 and lamb was 20 , when they met by joint friends . &quot;
&quot; she and her friends were in high school , and he was the cool elderly guy who tried to teach her the guitar playing . &quot;
he was the women of women at that time .
&quot; all girls had mel@@ ted away when he was there , &quot; said H@@ air@@ ston , now 40 and in Jackson &apos;s subur@@ b of Brand@@ on . &quot;
Lamb and Pr@@ enti@@ ss were obviously some time together .
&quot; in the emergency call Lamb &quot; I have killed my wife , &quot; but there was no certificate from a marriage . &quot;
&quot; they had a dog called Light@@ ning , who lived with them in the brick house , which ad@@ joins a Ba@@ you in Gau@@ tier . &quot;
the police said that the dog was fine .
&quot; the ex @-@ husband of Pr@@ enti@@ ss , Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , said they were divor@@ ced 15 years ago , but friends stayed and had a daughter who was now 19 years old . &quot;
&quot; she was totally destroyed in the ground , &quot; said O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en over his daughter . &quot;
she and her mother were absolutely best friends .
&quot; O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said he never met Lamb , but by his daughter Ab@@ ig@@ ail he heard that Lamb was interested in music and played blues . &quot;
Lamb met Pr@@ enti@@ ss when he and Ab@@ ig@@ ail came both on a summer fair three years ago .
later they played together the one or the other gig .
O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said his daughter writes and sings her own music .
Pr@@ enti@@ ss was a nurse who worked for various companies online .
&quot; Mike Sha@@ ffer , a b@@ art@@ ender and sometimes entertainment coordin@@ ator at The Ju@@ le@@ p Room , a weak@@ ly lit bar near Gau@@ tier , said he had finished Lamb and Pr@@ enti@@ ss Night in the night 5 of September for the last time when Lamb had finished his guitar and harmon@@ ic role in front of a spar@@ se audience . &quot;
there was no sign that something did not vote .
&quot; just a happy couple , &quot; he said . &quot;
we were in the clearing and jo@@ inted with each other .
I mean they both had a good sense of joke .
&quot; Schmidt , the dead professor , led the first semester seminar program and specialized in American native people and colonial history , said Don Allan Mit@@ ch@@ ell , a German professor at school . &quot;
he was married and had three little children .
he studied at the Emp@@ oria State University in K@@ ans@@ as and was president of his br@@ otherhood and the student committee .
&quot; on Tuesday evening about 900 people attended the Delta State Campus in Cle@@ vel@@ and , including lectur@@ ers , employees , students and members of the community at a cand@@ l@@ eli@@ ght commem@@ oration ceremony . &quot;
&quot; Sch@@ mid@@ ts Frau Li@@ z and his brother Jeff Schmidt also participated in the M@@ ahn@@ awake , while the Univers@@ itä@@ tsch@@ or &quot; B@@ right Mor@@ ning Star &quot; and &quot; Ama@@ zing Grace &quot; sang . &quot;
the lessons will be res@@ um@@ ed on Wednesday .
&quot; we try to return our students to return , &quot; &quot; said LA@@ FOR@@ GE . &quot;
the crisis is over .
this is a day of healing .
Amy and Rog@@ el@@ io Soli@@ s reported from Cle@@ vel@@ and , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi . &quot;
&quot; associated Press Auth@@ ors Emil@@ y Wag@@ ster P@@ ett@@ us in Green@@ ville , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , and Rebecca Sant@@ ana in New Orleans contributed to this report . &quot;
&quot; this story has been corrected to reflect that the police now says that Lamb made the emergency call after he had shot Schmidt , and that lamb wrote in his emergency call Pr@@ enti@@ ss as his wife , but there is no indication that the two have ever married . &quot;
Toys R Us plans to adjust less labour power for Christmas time
&quot; Toys R Us says that there will not be so many Christmas season employees as last year , but the toy and baby products dealer says that he will give up a chance to work more hours with him in his employees and seasonal workers . &quot;
&quot; the company said it plans to employ 4@@ 0,000 people in shops and distribution centres throughout the country . in the Christmas season 2014 still 45@@ ,000 workers were hired . &quot;
most jobs will be part @-@ time jobs .
the company said it will start with job interviews this month and the number of employees from October to December is rising .
&quot; while the holidays are even months away , the Christmas business is approaching , and companies are preparing to stop time workers to equi@@ p shops with employees who sell , ship and deliver products . &quot;
Michael J. Fox j@@ okes about his &quot; Date &quot; with Princess Diana
the premiere of &quot; Back to the Future &quot; was a great moment for Michael J. Fox .
it was also remarkable for personal reasons .
&quot; we sat in the theater waiting for the roy@@ als , and I notice that the seat next to me is empty and it becomes clear to me that Princess Diana is sitting next to me , &quot; he said in a trailer for an upcoming documentary &quot; Back in Time . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the film begins , and it comes to me in the sense that I am a simul@@ ated paraly@@ tic and an arm length of it , with the pr@@ incess of Wales at a date . &quot;
&quot; back in Time , &quot; a documentary about &quot; Back to the Future , &quot; presents interviews with Fox , Lea Thom@@ p@@ son and Christopher Lloyd , as well as director Robert Z@@ em@@ eck@@ is and producer Steven Spiel@@ berg . &quot;
&quot; back for the Future &quot; had its premiere 30 years ago .
&quot; it &apos;s really , &quot; &quot; Spiel@@ berg said , &quot; &quot; un@@ disp@@ uted the biggest travel film ever shot . &quot;
&quot; back in Time &quot; will be shown on VO@@ D , DVD and in selected cinem@@ as in October . &quot;
UN boss says there is no military solution in Syria
&quot; Secretary @-@ General Ban K@@ i @-@ moon says his answer to Russia &apos;s greater military support for Syria is : &quot; there is no military solution &quot; of the conflict of almost five years , and more weapons will only wor@@ sen violence and misery for millions of people . &quot;
&quot; the UN boss again calls for all parties , including the UN Security Council , to unite and support inclusive negotiations on finding a political solution . &quot;
&quot; ban said a press conference on Wednesday that he plans to meet the Foreign Ministers of the five permanent member nations of the Council - USA , Russia , China , Great Britain and France - on the ver@@ ge of the minist@@ erial meeting of the General Assembly to discuss the situation in Syria . &quot;
he regre@@ ts that the divisions within the Council and within the Syrian people and the regional powers will make this situation un@@ sol@@ vable .
&quot; ban urged the five permanent members to show the same solidarity and unity in addressing the crisis in Syria , which they have demonstrated in achieving a nuclear deal with Iran . &quot;
&quot; 8 survey results , showing that Donald Tr@@ ump is taken seriously . &quot;
some have tried to brand him as a flop .
others have dismis@@ sed him as a joke .
and some are waiting for a collapse .
&quot; but no matter how some Repub@@ lic@@ ans attempt to pull Donald Tr@@ ump from the upper ranks of surveys down , it has ( yet ) does not work . &quot;
&quot; ten of the last eleven national surveys show Donald Tr@@ ump in the double @-@ digit range , and some begin to seriously wonder what it means for the chances of nom@@ ination of real estate Mog@@ ul@@ s . &quot;
&quot; of course , it is still too early in the election period . &quot;
nobody claims that Tr@@ ump is likely to win the Repub@@ lican nom@@ ination .
&quot; experts emphasize that at this time , Rick Per@@ r@@ ys &apos;s leadership was given to the rising Her@@ man Cain , of whom no one also gained a state in the nom@@ ination process . &quot;
and there are many reasons why he had to fight in a general election .
but out@@ si@@ ders like J@@ eb Bush@@ s Super P@@ AC and the conservative Economic Group Club for Growth now recognise Tr@@ umps staying power and begin to let their dollars flow to overthrow it .
here are some current survey figures suggest@@ ing that the real estate Mog@@ ul is not only a temporary phase :
&quot; &quot; &quot; Tr@@ umps &quot; &quot; values have turned 180 degrees . &quot;
&quot; shortly before Donald Tr@@ ump started his can@@ did@@ acy in mid @-@ June , a survey of the Mon@@ mouth @-@ University showed that only two of ten re@@ public@@ ans saw the real estate Mog@@ ul positive . &quot;
by mid @-@ July it was 40 percent .
at the beginning of August it was 52 percent .
now six of 10 re@@ public@@ ans have a positive view of Donald Tr@@ ump .
about three of ten say they have a negative opinion .
and these figures are in the early states .
a Quin@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac vote in I@@ owa reported last week that 60 percent of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans have a good view of Tr@@ ump .
two @-@ thirds of GO@@ P voters would be happy with Tr@@ ump as candidates .
&quot; in a survey of CN@@ N / OR@@ C last week , 67 percent of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans said they were either &quot; &quot; enthusiastic &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; happy &quot; &quot; if Tr@@ ump would be nominated . &quot;
&quot; only two of 10 say they were &quot; &quot; angry &quot; &quot; if he were the candidate . &quot;
&quot; only Ben Car@@ son manages about the same enthusiasm as Tr@@ ump ( 43 percent say they would be &quot; &quot; enthusiastic &quot; &quot; vs. 40 percent , who say the same about Tr@@ ump ) . &quot;
the next thing in enthusiasm ?
Marco Ru@@ bio with only 21 percent .
&quot; on the other hand , 47 percent of the Repub@@ lican voters say they were &quot; &quot; dis@@ satisfied &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; angry &quot; &quot; if J@@ eb Bush , the favorite of the establishment , would become a candidate . &quot;
a majority of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans does not see Tr@@ umps temper@@ ament as a problem .
&quot; while Donald Tr@@ ump is widely critici@@ zed for his bom@@ b@@ astic and insul@@ ting statements , 52 percent of the Irish voters ins@@ ist that the Real Estate Mog@@ ul has the right temper@@ ament for a president , so ABC News / Washington Post on Monday . &quot;
&quot; the same number is in the first state of the nation of the nation , the state of I@@ owa , where the same 52 percent of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans think that he has the personality for a commander , according to Quin@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac last week . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless 44 percent think that he did not have the personality to effectively perform his ministry , and almost six of ten independent states say that his temper@@ ament does not fit into the White House , so ABC / Post . &quot;
Repub@@ lican voters acc@@ ust@@ om to the idea .
&quot; when they set up their hon@@ ors , Repub@@ lican voters think Tr@@ ump for real . &quot;
&quot; after a survey of CN@@ N / OR@@ C from last week , they say four out of ten that Tr@@ ump is the best bet . &quot;
&quot; this is a change since the time , when four of ten ends of July put their money on J@@ eb Bush . &quot;
&quot; in the past , GO@@ P voters did not have the clear@@ est crystal ball in the past . &quot;
&quot; at that time in the last cycle , four of ten re@@ public@@ ans thought that Rick Perry would win the nom@@ ination versus only 28 % for the final candidate Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , it shows that a variety of GO@@ P voters will see Tr@@ umps campaign as plau@@ sible . &quot;
&quot; even if the Repub@@ lic@@ ans gathered around another candidate , Tr@@ ump strikes almost everyone . &quot;
&quot; some experts point out that the fragmented field probably contributes to Tr@@ umps leadership , while anti @-@ Tr@@ ump support is spread over more than a dozen other candidates . &quot;
&quot; but a survey of the Mon@@ mouth @-@ University in early September shows that in a hyp@@ othe@@ tical head @-@ an @-@ head @-@ race between Tr@@ ump and most other Repub@@ lican candidates , Tr@@ ump has re@@ aped the majority of support . &quot;
&quot; he has 13 points ahead of Car@@ ly Fior@@ ina , ahead of Marco Ru@@ bio 14 points , before Walker 15 points , before J@@ eb Bush 19 points and finally before Rand Paul , John Ka@@ sich and Chris Christi@@ e 33 points . &quot;
it is a head @-@ to @-@ head race with Ted Cruz .
the only candidate who beats him ?
Ben Car@@ son would over@@ take the entrepren@@ eur with 19 points in a hyp@@ othe@@ tical head @-@ to @-@ head race .
a small majority of Donald Tr@@ ump fans say they have formed their minds .
&quot; a new survey by C@@ BS / NY@@ T on Tuesday shows that only slightly more than half of the voters , who support Tr@@ ump , say they have fixed their votes . &quot;
&quot; of course , much can happen to change this , and no one can truly say , never change the mind . &quot;
46 per cent said that they leave the door open to change to other candidates .
&quot; nonetheless , Tr@@ umps is strongest competition at the moment the other out@@ sider , the neuro@@ surgeon Ben Car@@ son , but voters who say they have formed their opinion are twice as common for Tr@@ ump . &quot;
six of 10 Repub@@ lic@@ ans say they agree with Tr@@ ump on immigration .
&quot; since Donald Tr@@ ump in his election campaign called &quot; &quot; rap@@ ist &quot; &quot; two months ago , Donald Tr@@ ump in his election campaign was the immigration of turning and fishing point in the public discourse . &quot;
some are concerned that the bom@@ b@@ astic expressions of Tr@@ ump will hold crucial He@@ ur@@ p@@ ano Americans from the Repub@@ lican party and will damage the re@@ orientation efforts .
&quot; but after the new ABC / Post pol@@ l of Monday , six of 10 re@@ public@@ ans say that they agree with Tr@@ ump in questions of immigration . &quot;
&quot; so long as the immigration in the spotlight remains , Donald Tr@@ ump seems to do . &quot;
fru@@ stration on the government climb@@ s to new high@@ s .
&quot; meanwhile , Donald Tr@@ ump and Ben Car@@ son meanwhile lost half of the support of Repub@@ lican voters , above all by their out@@ si@@ ders status . &quot;
&quot; six of 10 Repub@@ lic@@ ans say in the new ABC / Post Monday survey , they rather want a political out@@ sider than someone with government experience . &quot;
and they are angry at Washington .
&quot; a survey conducted by Des Mo@@ ines Register / Blo@@ om@@ berg in I@@ owa two weeks ago shows that three of four I@@ owa Repub@@ lic@@ ans were frustr@@ ated by the Repub@@ lic@@ ans , with 54 percent &quot; uns@@ atis@@ fied &quot; and 21 percent . &quot;
&quot; Munich , Sy@@ lt and Co . : the five most exclusive residential areas in Germany &quot;
here in the Hob@@ ook@@ en@@ weg is the most expensive residential complex - with a view over the Nord@@ se@@ ew@@ att .
&quot; in the street , one square meter of a roof @-@ roof@@ ed house costs 7@@ 3,@@ 300 Euro . &quot;
&quot; on Sy@@ lt the range of objects is naturally limited , &quot; says the study - therefore the high price . &quot;
a new study shows in which specific layers a square meter most cost .
&quot; of course , 18,@@ 70 Euro per square meter for a student bu@@ de in Munich are not really little . &quot;
&quot; in contrast to Germany &apos;s top residential areas , however , there is one of the price as Pe@@ an@@ uts . &quot;
the real estate service provider Engel &amp; Völ@@ kers has published a ranking of the most exclusive German residen@@ ces - with square metre prices in di@@ zz@@ ying heights .

Champions League : Bavaria @-@ dream start thanks to Müller and Göt@@ ze
double sc@@ orer in Pi@@ ra@@ eus : Bavaria @-@ Star Thomas Müller has just one run .
a happy hit by Thomas Müller moved the FC Bayern the way to a deser@@ ved 3 : 0 at Olympi@@ ak@@ os Pi@@ ra@@ eus - then it went .
a sovereign start of the Champions League season .
&quot; the world champion Thomas Müller and Mario Göt@@ ze gave the FC Bayern a dream start to the &quot; &quot; Mission Milan &quot; &quot; at Pi@@ ra@@ eus . &quot;
the team of Trainer P@@ ep Guardi@@ ola won her kick @-@ play in the Champions League in the Greek record champion Olympi@@ ak@@ os in hot atmosphere thanks to Müll@@ ers Doppel@@ pack ( 5@@ 2nd / 90@@ . + 2 ) and Gö@@ tz@@ es hits ( 89@@ . ) earned with 3 : 0 ( 0 : 0 ) .
&quot; the twel@@ fth time in series is to be the first step towards the final on May 28 , 2016 in Italy , where Guardi@@ ola finally wants to take the H@@ enk@@ el@@ pot@@ t to Munich in the third attempt . &quot;
&quot; at his 28th place in the Champions League , Müller received good help from Olympic and Olympic tor@@ go@@ ers Roberto , who had a flan@@ k to pass the champion &apos;s shot in the Champions League . &quot;
&quot; we will not under@@ estimate them , &quot; Bavaria @-@ Captain Philipp L@@ ahm promised before the game in the Kar@@ ais@@ ak@@ is stadium in front of 31.@@ 688 hot @-@ bloo@@ ded fans - and the Munich @-@ based word . &quot;
they showed a concentrated and dedicated idea without shining .
&quot; Pi@@ ra@@ eus had won his youngest six home games in the royal class , among them against well @-@ known clubs such as Manchester United , At@@ l@@ é@@ tico Madrid or Ju@@ vent@@ us Turin . &quot;
in 2011 Bor@@ us@@ sia Dortmund ( 1 : 3 ) .
&quot; but Bavaria , defeated in seven European ac@@ up du@@ els with Greek teams , did not want to be the next victim . &quot;
&quot; they went cour@@ age@@ ously ran , however , with their offensive efforts often too resour@@ c@@ eful to work . &quot;
&quot; the attacks were often initiated by deposit on left @-@ hand Douglas Costa , who rarely passed through the former Braunschwei@@ ger O@@ mar E@@ lab@@ d@@ ell@@ a@@ ou@@ i . &quot;
Müller had more luck at the right when his flan@@ k hit the right half @-@ field in the left upper gate .
in the 67@@ th minute the world champion passed the possible 2 : 0 .
the best opportunities in half one had Robert Lew@@ and@@ owski .
&quot; first of all , when Olympi@@ ak@@ os @-@ Stür@@ mer Ide@@ ye Brown struck the Pol@@ ball of Poland from the line ( 26 . ) . &quot;
&quot; then by direct acceptance , the go@@ al@@ keeper Roberto operated with his knee ( 35 . ) . &quot;
&quot; although the Bav@@ arians moved their usual domin@@ ating game , Pi@@ ra@@ eus was able to put con@@ i@@ fers . &quot;
but on door@@ ke@@ epers Manuel Neu@@ er was leaving .
&quot; so , when he drew a shot of Ide@@ ye about the lat@@ te ( 56@@ th ) . &quot;
&quot; before Neu@@ er , Guardi@@ ola left a four @-@ chain with David Al@@ aba in the centre next to Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng that made it well . &quot;
&quot; Mario Göt@@ ze , after mus@@ cular problems back in the ca@@ der , sat outside . &quot;
&quot; after the final training , the World Cup hero gave green light only after the final training , &quot; said sport chief Matthias Sam@@ mer at &quot; Sky &quot; : &quot; he who wants to make something different from it is already mal@@ ign@@ ant . &quot;
&quot; during the first change , Guardi@@ ola decided against him when he brought K@@ ings@@ ley Com@@ an for the beaten Lew@@ and@@ owski ( 59@@ th ) . &quot;
&quot; Göt@@ ze arrived late for Ar@@ tur@@ o Vi@@ dal ( 7@@ 6. ) and made everything clear 13 minutes later , by El@@ f@@ meter Müller put one on it . &quot;
before the game it had come to Kra@@ v@@ alle in the stadium .
&quot; after a smaller group of partly anno@@ yed Bavaria fans in their spect@@ ator block apparently had prov@@ oked the followers of Ho@@ sts Pi@@ ra@@ eus with words and gest@@ ures , the security forces attacked and went with whi@@ st@@ les against the Munich supporters . &quot;
at least one Bavaria @-@ Fan was injured from the stadium .
&quot; who smo@@ kes , has a higher risk of losing teeth &quot;
&quot; who smo@@ kes , does not only harm the lung , but also the teeth - that places a Potsdam long term study . &quot;
the good news : at ren@@ unciation the risk decreases quickly .
smo@@ kers have a significantly increased risk of losing their teeth early .
&quot; this results from the long @-@ term study of an international research team , including several employees of the German Institute for Nutrition Research ( DI@@ f@@ E ) in Potsdam . &quot;
&quot; compared to smo@@ kers , smoking was the risk of losing their teeth pre@@ matur@@ ely , in order to increase the 2.5@@ - to 3.6 @-@ fold . &quot;
the scientists had observed more than 23.@@ 300 participants .
&quot; main causes of dental loss are tooth decay and inflammation of the g@@ ing@@ i@@ val , empha@@ sizes the DI@@ f@@ E . &quot;
&quot; for this peri@@ od@@ on@@ ti@@ tis , smoking is a risk factor , emphas@@ ise the authors . &quot;
&quot; therefore , the connection between smoking and tooth loss will therefore be reduced to more frequent g@@ ing@@ i@@ val infections in smo@@ kers . &quot;
it is not clear to what extent smoking also increases the risk of c@@ aries .
&quot; people who stopped smoking could reduce their risk but within a short time , the researchers write in the &quot; Journal of Dental Research . &quot; &quot;
&quot; however , it could take more than ten years until the endanger@@ ment came back to the level of non @-@ smo@@ kers , said Er@@ stau@@ tor Thomas Dietrich from the English University of Birmingham . &quot;
&quot; one must convince people to be non @-@ smo@@ kers , &quot; Head of H@@ einer Bo@@ eing from DI@@ f@@ E said : &quot; smoking reduces life time . &quot;
&quot; not smoking is good for lung and vessels and , according to our findings , also leads to a good dental health up to the high age . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
previous studies have already pointed out that smoking increases the risk of early tooth loss .
the new long @-@ term study bri@@ ghten the findings .
archae@@ ologists meet on the Rhein@@ ufer in Cologne on remains of the late Anti@@ quity
&quot; for the repeated time , archaeological findings have been made on the right bank of the Rhine . &quot;
&quot; near the construction site for the new Rhein@@ bou@@ levard , archae@@ ologists of the Roman @-@ German@@ ic @-@ Museum have excav@@ ated skel@@ et@@ ons and remains of historical buildings , Museum director Marcus Trier on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; since the beginning of the construction work on the Rhine , historians are searching for so @-@ called soil monuments . &quot;
&quot; in all construction projects in the district of Cologne , the museum is always considered a department for archae@@ ology soil preservation . &quot;
&quot; in the third section of the Rhine Boulevard , the archae@@ ologists have now been found . &quot;
&quot; from text documents , it was already known that at the place in the 4th century a fortress and in the 8th century have stood up a church , explained Trier . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the remains of the fortress and the church tower , a cemetery with around 350 tom@@ bs had been discovered , which probably belonged to the church . &quot;

EU Commission propos@@ ing new court in dispute over T@@ TIP
&quot; to assess the dispute over the planned trans@@ atlan@@ tic Trade Agreement T@@ TIP , the European Commission proposed a comprehensive reform of the current arbit@@ ration system . &quot;
&quot; the controversial private equity facilities for disputes between corporations and states should therefore be replaced by a more transparent system , which in its operation corresponds to considerably more traditional dishes . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we want to set up a system that people trust , &quot; &quot; explained the competent EU Commissioner Ceci@@ lia Malm@@ ström . &quot;
the Swe@@ de tried to introduce the proposal as European negoti@@ ating position in the free trade talks with the US .
the German government announced support .
T@@ TIP is intended to develop the world &apos;s largest free trade zone with 800 million people .
the plans for the reform of the current arbit@@ ration proceedings con@@ cre@@ t@@ ely see that the EU states and the USA jointly select independent judges for a new investment court .
&quot; they should come to equal parts from the EU , the US and from third countries . &quot;
&quot; for the first time , a second instance is planned . &quot;
it would allow it to appeal against verdi@@ ct verdi@@ ct .
&quot; so far , the proced@@ ural parties agreed to one another on arbitr@@ ators , a obj@@ ection to their jud@@ gments . &quot;
&quot; in the discussion of recent months , it became clear that citizens of the old IS@@ DS system did not trust in terms of fair@@ ness and justice , commented Malm@@ ström . &quot;
&quot; in the long term , they want to work on an international investment court according to their own data . &quot;
&quot; there could then , for example , be clari@@ fied disputes between Chinese companies and EU states . &quot;
&quot; the Investor @-@ State Ar@@ bit@@ ration ( IS@@ DS ) , above all , are considered to be one of the main reasons for the great resistance in Europe against T@@ TIP . &quot;
&quot; the traditional arbit@@ ration tri@@ bun@@ als are critici@@ zed by opponents as a kind of parall@@ el@@ ism , on the companies to de@@ duct compensation from tax@@ pay@@ ers , negotiate national laws , or to en@@ force a reduction of consumer and environmental standards . &quot;
&quot; in the first statements , anti @-@ T@@ TIP organisations , such as Camp@@ act , reported the proposals of the European Commission as inadequate . &quot;
it was above all critic@@ ised that they should not apply to the already negoti@@ ated free trade agreement with Canada ( C@@ eta ) .
&quot; on the other hand , the German Economic Secretary Matthias Mach@@ nig ( SPD ) signed the plans as a major advance . &quot;
&quot; during the reform , the Commission took into account significant points that the Federal Minister of Economic Affairs Sig@@ mar Gabriel developed in the spring with other EU trade ministers . &quot;
the old system of private arbit@@ ration was from the table .
the French government also welcomed the plans of Malm@@ ström .
the European Business Association Business@@ Europe warned against limiting the possibilities of the economy by too many new rules .
&quot; in this way , particularly small and medium @-@ sized enterprises could be dis@@ advant@@ aged . &quot;
&quot; when the talks on the T@@ TIP ( Trans@@ atlan@@ tic Trade and Investment Partnership ) agreement can be concluded , on Wednesday continued un@@ clear . &quot;
negotiations run since mid @-@ 2013 .
&quot; however , the topic of investor protection has not been discussed with the United States . &quot;
&quot; originally , a framework for the agreement should be at the end of this year . &quot;
this date is considered to be no longer unten@@ able .
del@@ ik@@ ater Folk by Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens in Hamburg
&quot; eleven years ago , Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens sits on stage at the Cologne Prime Club ( today : Lux@@ or ) . &quot;
&quot; next to him there is a fli@@ p@@ chart , on which the shy folk singer has recorded the picturesque U.S. state Michigan with felt pen . &quot;
&quot; the entire audience , about 40 persons , is nearly taken by St@@ ev@@ ens &apos;s lecture . &quot;
&quot; he tells about various places he always records on the map , about his min@@ u@@ ci@@ ously and delic@@ ately arranged songs . &quot;
&quot; where they were created , and how it looks there , in his homeland . &quot;
&quot; since then , St@@ ev@@ ens has proven to be a wonderfully creative Irish . &quot;
&quot; with the 2003 published and third album &quot; Gre@@ etings from Michigan : the Great Lake State &quot; clever composed songs , which harmon@@ ise harmon@@ i@@ ously close to American folk of the late six@@ ties , but can always drift into great opul@@ ent at any time . &quot;
&quot; the rum@@ or , &quot; Michigan , &quot; would be the first part of a scattered series : each of the 50 states of states should be dealt with in a row . &quot;
&quot; but already in 2004 and in the proximity of the Rhine , &quot; Seven Sw@@ ans &quot; has already appeared and has a positive effect on certain expectations . &quot;
reduces St@@ ev@@ ens here .
live with him guitar and ban@@ jo .
a year later the musician returns to the series in New York .
&quot; with &quot; Illinois &quot; ( &quot; Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens Inv@@ ites You To : come on Fe@@ el The Il@@ lin@@ oise , &quot; ) appears in 2005 a nationwide celebrated masterpiece . &quot;
convincing ideas and stylis@@ tic fin@@ esse .
the album rises into the American Bill@@ board Charts and is missing in any yearly list of influential music media .
&quot; after extremely productive experiments , St@@ ev@@ ens then runs on &quot; The Age of AD@@ Z &quot; ( 2010 ) very extensive electronic spare parts . &quot;
&quot; this sixth studio album is still broad@@ ly orchest@@ rated , but supported by programmed sequences or beats and plays with all manner of effect and rever@@ ence . &quot;
&quot; long since the smaller clubs increased , stage shows become a colorful spectacle of ne@@ on @-@ forehead @-@ bands and large fluor@@ escent stage de@@ co . &quot;
currently Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens is part of a five @-@ headed band through Germany .
in the dark @-@ held Hamburg @-@ Hamburg more !
&quot; he mainly presents the &quot; &quot; Car@@ rie &amp; Low@@ ell &quot; &quot; available since March . &quot;
&quot; although there are nearly 2000 guests now ban@@ ished in their chairs , the clearly traveled St@@ ev@@ ens returns to intim@@ acy and folk . &quot;
&quot; without a word to the audience , the group of excellent musicians is playing through the broad @-@ enriched album . &quot;
&quot; one h@@ ears from the audience : the lecture is &quot; &quot; opul@@ ent &quot; &quot; and you can basically throw away the &quot; &quot; plate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; only when it comes to an enc@@ ore , St@@ ev@@ ens would be humble , playing acousti@@ cally a few older songs and eventually falls under thunder@@ ous appl@@ ause . &quot;
Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ ns debut at the Prime Minister
&quot; since his election , Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns de@@ buted at the prime minister &apos;s parliamentary group with tension &quot;
the new Labour leader Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n is supposed to give his debut at the Prime Minister &apos;s findings and set out for the first time with David Cameron .
&quot; Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will rise to set the first of his six pre@@ determined questions shortly after noon , whereby his performance by the media is likely to be checked by the Labour MEPs . &quot;
he called for &quot; less theatre and more facts &quot; at this weekly event .
he also said he could ski@@ p some sessions to leave her colleagues .
&quot; the meeting will be the first parliamentary examination for Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s guidance , as it comes after his appointment as a member of the Shadow Cab@@ inet and after his speech at the TU@@ C Annual Meeting on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; in the meantime , the Labour president &apos;s decision on Tuesday during the singing of the national an@@ them at a commemor@@ ative ceremony commemor@@ ated the 75@@ th anniversary of the Battle of Britain in silence , cri@@ tically prov@@ oked by a number of T@@ ory MPs and is at the heart of several title pages stories in the newspapers . &quot;
Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s decision not to sing the national an@@ them has attracted attention
&quot; a spokes@@ man of Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said he had &quot; &quot; in resp@@ ect@@ ful silence &quot; &quot; and he recognized the &quot; &quot; hero@@ ism of the Royal Air Force in the Battle of England &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; but a member of Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns Shadow Cab@@ inet , O@@ wen Smith , told the Labour leader to sing the national an@@ them , &quot; independent &quot; of his belief that the monarchy should be abol@@ ished . &quot;
&quot; almost a dozen of shadow ministers have refused to serve in Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns supreme team , and they appe@@ aled to differences in the economy , defense and foreign policy , while less than a sixth of the parliamentary party originally supported it as a leader . &quot;
&quot; the Political Cor@@ respon@@ dent of the BBC Robin Bran@@ t says that political differences are also st@@ acked within Labour , &quot; and by Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s remarks on the position of the European Union and the limitation of profits . &quot;
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said the TU@@ C conference to set Labour changes to remove the whole idea of a limitation overall .
&quot; hours later Mr Smith , the shadow work and pensions minister , said that the party was &quot; very clear , &quot; that it was only against government plans to lower the limit of £ 26@@ ,000 to £ 23@@ ,000 . &quot;
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will be the fifth Labour leader David Cameron ever since he has been T@@ ory leader over the last decade over the Dis@@ patch box in parliament .
&quot; the Labour leader who promised another policy approach says that he has &quot; &quot; Crow@@ d @-@ sour@@ ced &quot; &quot; ideas for questions to Mr Cameron and gave him more than 30.000 contributions . &quot;
&quot; the Is@@ lington North MP has said that the prime minister is too con@@ front of the Prime Minister and that he will have both &quot; &quot; impact &quot; &quot; and fighting with resistance and instead of focusing on serious problems such as poverty , ine@@ quality and challenges for young people . &quot;
&quot; Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said that Angela Eagle , the shadow economic minister , will represent him if he does not participate - for example when Mr Cameron is travelling abroad . &quot;
&quot; he has also brought the idea into conversation that other colleagues occasionally take the word , and that he talked to John Ber@@ cow , the spokes@@ man of the under@@ house , to discuss the problem . &quot;
&quot; when he was leader in 2005 , Mr Cameron said that he wants to remove himself from politics in the style of a &quot; Kas@@ per@@ le Theatre , &quot; which is often linked to the Prime Minister &apos;s frag@@ ment . but a few years later he admitted that he failed . &quot;
&quot; as it was first broadcast on television in 1990 , the questionn@@ aire was considered as the most important bar@@ ometer of the judgement of a leader and his leadership in the House of Comm@@ ons and his position among his parliamentary colleagues , although critics have argued that they have become a car@@ ic@@ ature and require far @-@ reaching reforms . &quot;

po@@ und rises through accelerated wage growth in the United Kingdom
&quot; the Po@@ und rose sharp@@ ly by dates , which show an increase in the wage growth of the United Kingdom . in parallel , the FT@@ SE 100 was increased by the SA@@ BM@@ iller &apos;s bid target . &quot;
&quot; between May and July , the result without bonuses in the United Kingdom grew by 2.9 % over the same period of the previous year . &quot;
&quot; since 2009 , this percentage has been the fastest and raised ass@@ essments of the time of an increase in interest . &quot;
&quot; the Po@@ und rose by more than 1 % compared to the dollar to $ 1,@@ 550@@ 5 and climbed to 0.@@ 84 % compared to the Euro to 1,@@ 37@@ 30 € . &quot;
the FT@@ SE 100 Index concluded with an increase of 1.@@ 49 % to 6.@@ 2@@ 29.@@ 21 .
SA@@ BM@@ iller was the outstanding share in the market and made a jump of 20 % after taking over the offer of the Ri@@ val AB In@@ Be@@ v .
&quot; a transaction would combine the two largest bre@@ wer@@ ies in the world and bring brands such as Bud@@ weiser , Stella Ar@@ to@@ is , Per@@ oni and Gro@@ l@@ sch . &quot;
&quot; after encouraging news from the competition group for luxury goods Ri@@ chem@@ ont , Bur@@ berry shares were 0.9 % higher . &quot;
Ri@@ chem@@ on &apos;s latest sales figures beat all expectations and also showed that sales in China - a key market for bur@@ berry - announces growth again .
Gl@@ enc@@ ore shares rose by 5 % after the mining giant said that it took EUR 2.5 billion by a stock sale as part of its strategy of debt .
&quot; the shares of Mon@@ di &apos;s packaging and paper group were the largest los@@ ers on the index , with a decrease of 4.3 % after Gold@@ man Sach@@ s had set his assessment for the company rating on sale . &quot;
&quot; JD Sports increased by 3.1 % , after the sport@@ swear company had reported a pre @-@ tax result of 4@@ 6.6 million for the half @-@ year . &quot;
the boss of JD Sports says that higher wages thre@@ aten the expansion .
the managing director of JD Sports Peter Cow@@ g@@ ill says that a higher minimum wage for UK workers could mean more purchasing power in the pockets of potential customers .
&quot; but it is unlikely that this purchasing power would balance the higher labour costs in his company , he says . &quot;
&quot; the cost could hit the expansion plans of JD Sports , he added , and that could mean there are fewer additional jobs . &quot;

&quot; inspired by the &quot; potato instead of the twe@@ eter &quot; on a poster of the Peg@@ ida movement , Al@@ ha@@ y potato and meat put together on a sk@@ ewer . &quot;
&quot; the idea brought him a poster at a Peg@@ ida demonstration with the inscription &quot; Pot@@ atoes , instead of D@@ öner , &quot; which he had seen in television by chance . &quot;
&quot; since then , there is a barbecue , which is equipped with meat and potatoes . &quot;
&quot; this is multic@@ ultural for the stomach , &quot; says Al@@ ha@@ y . &quot;
the idea has meanwhile joined the Leban@@ ese patent office in Munich .
&quot; according to the authority , it has recently been protected as a utility model . &quot;

Met@@ cash launches ground @-@ breaking anti @-@ theft campaign to fight al@@ di@@ -
Met@@ cash tries to protect the IG@@ A stores in front of an Al@@ di march in South Australia and Western Australia .
food wholes@@ aler Met@@ cash has launched a ground @-@ breaking campaign to defend the market share of the IG@@ A retailers in South Australia and Western Australia in advance of a 700 million $ Al@@ di invasion .
&quot; while Al@@ di prepared the opening of two distribution centers and the first 120 stores in South Australia and Western Australia early next year , Met@@ cash and IG@@ A Super@@ markets strengthen their relationships with local food suppliers and build the IG@@ A brand through mainstream marketing and marketing across the social media , as well as events like Adel@@ ai@@ de Show . &quot;
&quot; suppliers and suppliers leap on board , with brands such as ice manufacturer S@@ imm@@ o from D@@ uns@@ bor@@ ough , which distri@@ butes samples distributed in IG@@ A stores and selling shop@@ ke@@ epers to sell the approved tickets for the South Australian Football League to loyal customers . &quot;
&quot; it is expected that Met@@ cash will publish more details of its defensive strategy on September 29 , when the wholes@@ aler will perform its annual investor @-@ strategy ag on 29 September . &quot;
&quot; it is a lot in the game , as South Australia and Western Australia make up almost 30 percent of Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s IG@@ A stores and generate higher profit margins as Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s IG@@ A network in eastern states . &quot;
&quot; buyers in South Australia and Western Australia are not@@ orious provincial and IG@@ A retailers have a much stronger market share than in New South Wales , Victoria and Que@@ ens@@ land - more than 30 percent in South Australia and 24 percent in Western Australia compared to around 14 percent in eastern Australia . &quot;
&quot; analysts like Morgan Stan@@ ley believe that Al@@ di will cut away around five percent of the food market for twelve months after opening its first markets and will take away all existing actors , but mainly self @-@ employed retailers . &quot;
&quot; according to a report published in this week , the analy@@ st Tom K@@ ier@@ ath of Morgan Stan@@ ley estimates that IG@@ A retail@@ er could lose 360 $ million sales per year and $ 250 million by the end of 2016 . &quot;
forecasts to 2019 illustrate how the market is set to change .
&quot; the loss in the food and food business and in the quantities on Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s high fixed cost base could cost CHF 13 million for earnings before interest and tax , Mr K@@ ier@@ ath said . &quot;
&quot; at the same time Met@@ cash loses market shares in eastern states , mainly at Al@@ di and Col@@ es , although a recently conducted survey by Roy Morgan found that IG@@ A buyers are the most loyal . &quot;
&quot; Morgan Stan@@ ley assumes that Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s revenue in food and food business will drop by 3.8 percent in 2016 , by 4.1 percent in 2017 and 2.1 percent in 2018 and reduce the market share of 14 percent in 2015 to 10.@@ 3 percent by 2020 . &quot;
&quot; last week , the leading fund manager Ham@@ ish Dou@@ glass , the founder of the Mag@@ ell@@ an Financial Group , told a business dinner in Melbourne that Met@@ cash will probably disappear within a decade . Met@@ cash will disappear . &quot;
Met@@ cash refused to publicly respond to Mr Dou@@ glass &apos;s comments .
but it is assumed that a member of Met@@ cash has been contacted by Mr Dou@@ glass last week .
&quot; since 2010 , i@@ Gas market share has fallen from 18 percent to 14 percent , and revenues from Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s food and food trade , which have been supplied by around 1,@@ 200 IG@@ A retailers since 2012 , reflects the operative debt reduction in turnover and margins . &quot;
&quot; the wholes@@ aler , however , def@@ ends itself and inv@@ ests more than $ 150 million in order to improve sales prices with Col@@ es and Wo@@ ol@@ wor@@ ths at hundreds of products every week and deliver IG@@ A retailers in improving their shops through fast growing fresh food and deliver a better selection of private label foods . &quot;
Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s main business leader Ian Mor@@ rice says that the price adjustments and charging software programs at El@@ an are to be set and hopes that the wholes@@ aler will return to profit growth for the first time in four years in 2017 .
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is is supported by the president of the Australian tennis association Steve He@@ aly
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is deserves praise for his behaviour .
&quot; Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was one of the &quot; &quot; col@@ lateral damage &quot; &quot; in the recent storm around his friend Nick Kyr@@ gi@@ os and deserves praise for his own behaviour . &quot;
&quot; Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is , the younger of the talented duo , which is repeatedly called &quot; Special K@@ s , &quot; came into the spotlight by the not@@ orious engagement of Kyr@@ gi@@ os with St@@ an Wa@@ wr@@ in@@ ka at the Montreal Masters . &quot;
&quot; in a fier@@ y qualifying game in C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati soon after that , Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is and his opponent Ryan Har@@ rison had to be separated twice by the refer@@ ee , and Har@@ rison cried out : &quot; Wa@@ wr@@ in@@ ka would have to beat Kyr@@ gi@@ os , and I should beat the child . &quot;
&quot; as he was last seen , how he struck a tennis ra@@ cket after a cr@@ amp had a potential US Open victory by Richard Gas@@ quet , Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was fully defended by He@@ aly . &quot;
&quot; the teen@@ ager is currently in Glasgow , in the competition with Sam Gr@@ oth for the second place in the singles behind Bernard Tom@@ ic in the Davis Cup semi@@ fin@@ als against Great Britain . &quot;
&quot; one thing I am quite brave is the fact that in my opinion Th@@ an@@ asi was a little drawn into the argument , &quot; &quot; He@@ aly said . &quot;
&quot; he has broken a ra@@ cket when he lost a cr@@ amp in the US Open , but he is not the first player who has broken a m@@ allet from fru@@ stration with himself , and I know Th@@ an@@ asi enough to know that he is not proud of it . &quot;
&quot; but , really , he has beha@@ ved extremely well in the US Open , even among the fairly pro@@ voc@@ ative circumstances with Har@@ rison and so on , and I think he deserves a lot of recognition . &quot;
&quot; he has a great team around himself , he has a great family around himself , and I believe he was a little too strict . &quot;
&quot; he is a very mature 19 @-@ year @-@ old , he works very hard , and he fits into the team and so on , he has never been a problem with the other players , he is well in shape , he &apos;s a very stable and mature young guy , and I think he deserves to be judged by his own mer@@ its . &quot;
&quot; He@@ aly also supported the decision , Kyr@@ gi@@ os decided not to take into account the important decision on Friday , and he describes the &quot; common decision &quot; as the right one for everyone , but he sec@@ ures the man from Can@@ ber@@ ra as a long @-@ term solid component to return to the team . &quot;
&quot; first of all , we wish that the team is completely focused on the competition and not on all the controversi@@ es around us &#91; Kyr@@ gi@@ os &#93; , &quot; He@@ aly said . &quot;
&quot; some time outside the li@@ mel@@ ight , in which he can only think about it , I consider it appropriate , and it &apos;s best for the team and it &apos;s the best for him . &quot;
&quot; Europe &apos;s refugee crisis : Hungary explains emergency , closes the border , keeps refugees back &quot;
&quot; Hungary explains the emergency status and settled the southern border with Serbia on Tuesday , and held all those who tried to escape illeg@@ ally in the country . all with the aim of stopping the influ@@ x of migrants . &quot;
chaos followed the border when hundreds of migrants were accum@@ ulating in a Ni@@ em@@ and@@ s@@ land and re@@ acted Serbian officials with indi@@ gn@@ ation .
the people who fled from violence were stuck for an unknown time in a country strip at the road between the two control points of the countries and built tents and settled there .
but frustr@@ ations rose .
&quot; as a police helicop@@ ter floating above them , the migrants &quot; &quot; open the border ! &quot; &quot; and cried out ins@@ ults against the Hungarian police police . &quot;
some reported from Prot@@ est food@@ stuffs and water .
&quot; Serbia &apos;s Foreign Minister declared it &quot; &quot; un@@ acceptable &quot; &quot; that migrants from Hungary would be sent back , while more and more from Macedonia and Greece arrive . &quot;
( Serbia ) wants to be part of the solution and not a col@@ lateral damage .
&quot; there must be talks with Brussels and other countries in the coming days , &quot; &quot; said I@@ vica Dac@@ ic in Prague . &quot;
the turbul@@ ence on the Hungarian @-@ Serbian border came a day after the 28 @-@ Nations @-@ block at a controversial meeting in Brussels did not agree on common immigration policy .
&quot; however , the ministers agreed to share responsibility for 4@@ 0,000 people who sought refuge in the cor@@ rupted Italy and Greece . they expressed their hope that finally - next month or by the end of the year - an agreement would be achieved that the EU states would take more 120,000 refugees among them , including some from Hungary . &quot;
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria called on Tuesday a special summit of the European Union to discuss the immigration crisis of the continent .
&quot; Hungary , however , did not rely on a bal@@ m action from Brussels or from its neighbours . &quot;
&quot; the emergency room rested on Tuesday in two southern regions gave authorities more authority to cope with the crisis , so that they could block roads and accelerate asylum procedures . &quot;
the Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to said that his country also plans to build a bar@@ bed wire along its border to Romania to stop the influ@@ x of migrants from the country - after having completed a fence at the Serbian border .
&quot; C@@ BS News correspon@@ dent Charlie D &apos;@@ Ag@@ ata reported that even prison @-@ races were deployed in the race , the bar@@ bed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia . &quot;
&quot; in recent months , Hungary has become a significant bott@@ len@@ eck for many war refugees from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East and to the entry point to the European Union . &quot;
&quot; however , Prime Minister Viktor Or@@ ban has insi@@ sted that most of the upcoming economic refugees are looking for a better life , and not war refugees who are entitled to protection - a view that is strongly opposed to other EU countries , including Germany . &quot;
&quot; the new laws , which came into force at midnight in Hungary , make the crossing of the border or the damage of the 4 @-@ metre ( 13 feet ) high fence , which allowed the government along the southern border to Serbia , to a crime . these laws also establish higher sentences for den@@ ounced human traff@@ ick@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; due to the situation created by mass migration , the Hungarian government declares the emergency state , &quot; said government spokes@@ man Z@@ ol@@ tan K@@ ov@@ acs Rep@@ or@@ ters in the southern town of Sz@@ eg@@ ed . &quot;
we say it very clearly : illegal border crossing is a crime .
&quot; the Parliament must still agree to the use of the military , which is expected for next week , but rep@@ or@@ ters from Associ@@ ated Press have already seen heavily armed soldiers with vehicles and dogs for days . &quot;
&quot; Gy@@ org@@ y Bak@@ on@@ di , country security advis@@ er for Or@@ ban , said that authorities caught 45 people trying to cross the border , 15 others were already penet@@ rated deeper into the country . &quot;
&quot; they come down by dam@@ aging the fence , they are now in police custo@@ dy and are acc@@ using criminal off@@ ences according to the new laws . &quot;
authorities are able to quickly repair the fence .
&quot; on Tuesday morning , Hungarian officials closed two of the seven border cross@@ ings with Serbia after a train car with bar@@ bed wire to close the borders . &quot;
&quot; chaos surro@@ unds the most important border crossing near Ros@@ z@@ ke , Hungary , when the Hung@@ arians opened a small office in a metal container to process the data from people and press a crowd to push for it there . &quot;
&quot; about 20 succeeded in entering , but thousands remained outside . &quot;
another group of migrants blocked the most important highway connection between Serbia and Hungary and said that they would refuse food and water until they are allowed to arrive to Hungary .
election @-@ 2016 : Hill@@ ary Clinton &apos;s lead ahead Ber@@ nie S@@ anders in a national survey
&quot; the former US Secretary of State Hill@@ ary Clinton continues to hold a double @-@ digit advance in the democratic race for the nom@@ ination at national level , but Sen@@ ator Ber@@ nie S@@ anders wins the ground . &quot;
&quot; Clinton has now backed 47 percent of democratic voters in the elections ( 58 percent before ) , while S@@ anders is second , with 27 percent ( increase by 17 percent ) . &quot;
&quot; Vice @-@ President Joe Bi@@ den , who has not yet announced if he is a candidate for the presidential office , receives support of 15 percent of the democratic voters in the elections . &quot;
&quot; more than five months before the beginning of the elections , most democratic voters say that it is too early to say that their opinion is determined by which candidates will support them . &quot;
but Clinton &apos;s supporters are more consistent than those of the other candidates .
&quot; since the C@@ BS news survey Clinton has lost a number of demographic groups , while S@@ anders generated some gains . &quot;
&quot; Clinton holds a great lead in women and moder@@ ates , but these jumps have decreased . &quot;
&quot; your support in the men has dropped significantly , and S@@ anders is here only with 5 points . &quot;
&quot; Clinton &apos;s advantage with democratic voters under 50 years has displac@@ ed , and they and S@@ anders are now at the same level . &quot;
&quot; Clinton , however , has a big advantage in older voters . &quot;
&quot; last month Clinton was in front of S@@ anders with a double @-@ digit margin in the liber@@ als , but S@@ anders has now a 5 @-@ point lead in this group . &quot;
about half of the democratic voters of the elections nationwide say they would support Clinton when they were nominated by the party .
&quot; a quarter would support them with some privileges , and another 15 percent would only support them because they are the candidate . &quot;
six percent would not support them .
perhaps not surprising that Clin@@ tons &apos;s current supporters are especially enthusiastic about it .
the views are more mixed with those who are currently not supporting Clinton - only about one quarter would support them enthusi@@ as@@ tically .
&quot; while 48 percent of the democratic voters say that they support Clinton with enthusiasm , fewer Repub@@ lican voters say this about their nick@@ name Donald Tr@@ ump ( 35 percent ) . &quot;
&quot; if Clinton &apos;s supporters are asked in an open question why they want them to be the candidate , the most common answer is that it has the right experience ( 16 percent ) , followed by the opinion that it is time that a woman is President ( 13 percent ) and that she is the best candidate for the job ( 10 percent ) . &quot;
Clinton &apos;s supporters are also referred to as Bill Clinton ( 9 percent ) .
consent to dealing with the problems and the voters are quoted as well .
&quot; since the vice @-@ president has a potential for the presidential office in the balance sheet , 57 percent of the democratic voters want to see him in the race - although a third believes he should not do it . &quot;
&quot; if democratic voters are asked of the elections , who would be their second choice for the party , Bi@@ den is at the top . &quot;
Clin@@ tons supporters say more than half that Bi@@ den would be their second choice far off S@@ anders .
&quot; Bi@@ den does not decide to channel for the nom@@ ination of democr@@ ats , Hill@@ ary Clinton &apos;s lead is raised in front of S@@ anders , from 20 points with Bi@@ den in race to 30 points without him in the race . &quot;
&quot; fifty @-@ five percent of the democratic voters see Clinton as a candidate with the best chances of winning the election ; however , this figure has dropped from 78 percent last month . &quot;
&quot; Bi@@ den is by far a second in this measurement , but the percentage that sees it as the &quot; &quot; sel@@ fish &quot; &quot; has increased . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , with the question of what is more important for a candidate , Democratic voters call on questions about voters . &quot;
&quot; similar to the last month , there is no single democratic candidate or potential candidate for this vot@@ er election as un@@ acceptable . &quot;
the Democratic candidates or potential candidates provide good results with some important characteristics in the election of their party .
&quot; maj@@ orities view Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den as honest and trust@@ worthy and equipped with strong leadership qualities . &quot;
&quot; Bi@@ den is best cut off with the three candidates for hon@@ esty , whereas clin@@ ton &apos;s strength is the leadership . &quot;
&quot; thirty percent of the democratic voters do not believe that Clinton is honest and trust@@ worthy , twice as many say that about S@@ anders ( 15 percent ) , but 27 percent do not think of it . &quot;
&quot; democratic voters in the elections generally also regard Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den ideological in accordance with their views . &quot;
&quot; in all these measurements , about one quarter of the democratic voters did not think of S@@ anders . &quot;
&quot; as questions about Hill@@ ary Clinton &apos;s use of a personal e @-@ mail address and server during term , most of the Democratic voters are satisfied with their explanation of the matter and say that it has not affected their opinions altogether . &quot;
but it is a different story in the American public all in all .
&quot; half of the Americans are now un@@ happy with their explanation , while only about one third is satisfied . &quot;
&quot; public opinion was split in March , shortly after the problem came to light . &quot;
&quot; most Americans said that the e @-@ mail contro@@ versy had no impact on Clinton &apos;s general opinion , although 36 percent said that their opinion had deteri@@ or@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; it is mainly re@@ public@@ ans , more than six of 10 who say their views of Clinton have become worse . &quot;
&quot; although Clinton is considered honest and trust@@ worthy by the voters of its party , this continues to be a problem for them among registered voters in total : only 32 percent see them as honest and trust@@ worthy , eight percent less than last month and 15 points less since May . &quot;
62 percent of voters do not hold them for an honest and trust@@ worthy person .
&quot; at the same time , 55 percent of voters will see Tr@@ ump as not honest and un@@ trust@@ worthy . &quot;
&quot; Clinton and Tr@@ ump , however , get good notes on leadership . &quot;
&quot; from the six candidates tested , Bi@@ den , Car@@ son and Bush best cut out hon@@ esty . &quot;
&quot; a majority sees S@@ anders rather than hon@@ estly , but as with Car@@ son many have no opinion of him . &quot;
the error rate for the sample of 351 demo@@ cra@@ cies in the pre @-@ election is 6 percentage points .
Ben Car@@ son moves near Donald Tr@@ ump at the nationwide survey
Ben Car@@ son is located at the latest survey by C@@ BS News / New York Times close to Donald Tr@@ ump
&quot; on the two candidates , half of the support of the voters in the new survey , and others are losing dramatically . &quot;
&quot; Repub@@ lican voters continue to support tr@@ ump in large numbers throughout the country . the support is growing of 23 % in the last C@@ BS survey conducted before Fox News Deb@@ ate last month , by 27 % in the survey on Tuesday . &quot;
but Car@@ son oss in the same period of 6 % to 23 % .
the survey also revealed that Car@@ son arrives well in demo@@ graphics groups and sur@@ passes Tr@@ ump under repub@@ lican elec@@ tors with university education .
&quot; the rest of the field , with the exception of Car@@ ly Fior@@ ina and Ohio Gover@@ nor John Ka@@ sich , is defeated with Wis@@ cons@@ in Gover@@ nor Scott Walker , who dropped by 10 % support last month to now 2 % . &quot;
&quot; the former Florida Gover@@ nor J@@ eb Bush , former governor of Ar@@ kan@@ s@@ as Mike Hu@@ ck@@ ab@@ ee and Florida Sen@@ ator Marco Ru@@ bio , are in third place with 6 % . &quot;
the bug margin in the sample of 376 people from Repub@@ lican voters in this latest survey is plus or minus 6 % and was conducted in September .
&quot; the latest CN@@ N / OR@@ C survey , published last week , shows that Car@@ son increases in the surveys - he lands with 19 % support in re@@ public@@ ans , behind the Tr@@ ump with 32 % support . &quot;
the latest survey of ABC News / Washington Post also showed Tr@@ ump clearly ahead of Car@@ son .
&quot; with a view of one of the last week rising Car@@ son , Tr@@ ump found some si@@ eves for the former neuro@@ surgeon , even after Car@@ son ap@@ ologi@@ zed to question Tr@@ ump &apos;s faith . &quot;
&quot; we need energy , &quot; said Tr@@ ump last Saturday during a campaign performance in I@@ owa . &quot;
pleasant bathing temperatures : the eastern Mediterranean is currently up to 29 degrees warm .
&quot; even if peak values are only measured in the distance , there is already a trip to the Mediterranean for bathing resorts to find even warm water . &quot;
a bathroom in the North or Baltic Sea should be a rather short pleasure with a maximum of 17 degrees .
&quot; some people do not go to the sea : a maximum of 18 degrees has the water in the North and Baltic Sea during this week , the German Weather Service ( D@@ WD ) shares . &quot;
&quot; bathing temperatures , on the other hand , still offer the Mediterranean : in the East it is even up to 29 degrees . &quot;
&quot; in the Adriatic , there are at the top 25 degrees , in France 23 degrees . &quot;
the Red Sea in Egypt comes to 28 degrees .
five members of the Brotherhood with the death of a Bar@@ uch College @-@ Ne@@ ul@@ ings stressed
&quot; almost two years after a student died during a schi@@ z@@ ous ritual in Po@@ con@@ o Mountains , Pennsylvania , murder charges against five people were submitted . &quot;
&quot; members of the New York Bar@@ uch College P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ P@@ si @-@ Brotherhood attacked Ch@@ un &quot; Michael &quot; Den@@ g brut@@ ally and delayed his transport to the hospital , which contributed to his death , shared the police . &quot;
&quot; officials said that he had been loaded with a 30 @-@ po@@ und back@@ pack full of sand , and repeatedly attacked while trying to go over a frozen field to a target . &quot;
&quot; Mr. Den@@ g finally compl@@ ained about head@@ ache , then he fell un@@ conscious . &quot;
&quot; the members of the P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ P@@ si @-@ Brotherhood did not call the emergency number 911 , after Den@@ g was power@@ less and suppos@@ edly waiting for an hour before they brought him to a hospital , so the police . &quot;
&quot; however , they had the time to change D@@ eng@@ s clothing , to goo@@ gling its symptoms and contact Andy Men@@ g , the national president of the Brotherhood to pick up advice , said police chief Chris Wagner at a press conference . &quot;
&quot; at this point , the members of U@@ ten@@ si@@ lien started to hide and set the well @-@ being of the Brotherhood in principle about Michael Den@@ g , &quot; said police chief Wagner . &quot;
&quot; he could not be revi@@ ved , and he died in his injury the next morning . &quot;
&quot; after an aut@@ op@@ sy report Den@@ g was repeatedly added with bl@@ unt force injuries to head , tor@@ so and thi@@ ghs . &quot;
&quot; too many families were destroyed by the Brotherhood of the Brotherhood . at least one student dies at the Sch@@ ik@@ anen since 1970 , &quot; said Douglas F@@ ier@@ berg , a lawyer , representing the D@@ eng@@ s family in an explanation . &quot;
&quot; br@@ other@@ hoods and their members must be held accoun@@ table , and this step by authorities is very important . &quot;
a County Grand Jury of Mon@@ roe recommended an indictment for the first five members for the first five members .
&quot; thirty @-@ two members of the Brotherhood , including Mr Men@@ g , are also accused of schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ic attacks and formation of a criminal association . &quot;
&quot; we do not only want to take responsibility for the persons involved , but if there is an organization which - officially or in@@ official - has sanc@@ tioned this , we will also be held accoun@@ table , &quot; &quot; said Wagner at a press conference on Tuesday . &quot;
Bar@@ uch College has banned the Brotherhood and the national br@@ otherhood has rev@@ oked its affili@@ ation to the local group .
this will happen when the F@@ ed raises interest
&quot; a interest rise is coming , and the house will fall into wa@@ ver@@ ing , ren@@ ews for bonds will rise , and the economy will slide into a recession . &quot;
we know this .
what we don &apos;t know is how long it will last and how long it will stop .
&quot; in particular , the history of the economy offers only low guidance for the process . &quot;
a recession came within just 11 months after the first interest rate increase and lasted for 86 months .
&quot; the aggres@@ si@@ veness of the Federal Reserve at raising interest rates is often , if not always , a factor in how the economy and financial investments are responding . &quot;
&quot; therefore , representatives of the US Central Bank strongly emphasized that investors should not concentrate when it starts to increase interest rates , but rather on the period required for norm@@ alisation . &quot;
&quot; in fact , several variables play a role . &quot;
&quot; at the end , market participants could find that the whole excitement was possibly exagger@@ ated because of a interest rate increase . &quot;
&quot; the first increase in F@@ ed since the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted as a signal for the end of the era of &quot; cheap money , &quot; said Julian Jes@@ so@@ p , chief econom@@ ist at Capital Economics , in a communication to customers . &quot;
&quot; in contrast , we do not expect the gradual return of US interest to normal heights , but still at a low level , to lead to sei@@ s@@ mic shock that many seem to fear . &quot;
&quot; however , this does not mean that there will be no effect . &quot;
here is a look at historic trends based on how some areas of the economy could react :
&quot; as the market has seen last month , the anticip@@ ation of interest increases can make things more volati@@ le for a while . &quot;
&quot; once the up@@ li@@ ft@@ ment arrives , the influence is not so dramatic . &quot;
&quot; there is apparently a tendency that wealth yields 12 to 24 months after the first increase , which perhaps reflects the delay in monetary policy , &quot; said Deutsche Bank Analy@@ sts in a newer study to what happened after interest increases of the F@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; more precisely , the market is mostly in the upward trend - about 14 percent - on the way to the interest rate increase , quite flat in the last six past cycles of 14.@@ 4 percent , with an average return in the past six past cycles of 14.@@ 4 percent , with an average return on Nu@@ ve@@ en Asset Management , at Bar@@ ron &apos;s . &quot;
Deutsche Bank said that the impact on the shares tends to occur later in the increases cycle and returns the return of return .
rec@@ essions are a fact of economic life but interest increases often promote it .
&quot; in the current case , the F@@ ed is confronted with some conditions that did not exist before and that could accelerate a recession . &quot;
it is particularly not@@ e@@ worthy that gross domestic product will be near its lowest point at an interest rate of F@@ ed .
&quot; according to Deutsche Bank , the 118 tari@@ ffs were only twice the nominal GDP of 4.5 percent since 1950 . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; interest rates in such a fragile economic setting could be ris@@ ky and throw up the question , &quot; if this time is different , &quot; the Deutsche Bank said . &quot;
&quot; market participants have taken the whole year on an interest rate of the F@@ ed , and all eyes were directed to the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee this week , which ends on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; while many strateg@@ ists and econom@@ ists believe that FO@@ MC could appro@@ ve an increase in this session , fut@@ ures trading will only increase 25 percent . &quot;
&quot; in our study , all the increase cycles from 1950 to today have taken place in a super cycle with increasing fluctu@@ ation in the GDP and pre @-@ rec@@ es@@ sion@@ ed heights are very quickly placed after the start of recovery , &quot; says the report . &quot;
&quot; in contrast , this is a clearly slow recovery from what was the worst recession in the observed phase . &quot;
&quot; the current cycle is by far the longest that the F@@ ed has been waiting for since the end of the last recession ; the record was 35 months , and this has been 74 months . &quot;

the main difference is that the effect on bonds is faster than in equi@@ ties when they change their strategic course .
&quot; at bonds , the returns seem to change the direction as soon as the first increase / decrease in the cycle takes place . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the slow@@ down cycle , the loans fell immediately , said Deutsche Bank . &quot;
&quot; the strateg@@ ists of Charles Schw@@ ab believe that the increase in interest rates will lead to a closer co @-@ operation between longer and shorter bonds , and lead to a flat@@ tering of the curve . &quot;
&quot; high @-@ interest bonds often bring better yields in such a climate , although &quot; we are still cau@@ tious to expect higher yields , &quot; said Kath@@ y Jones , Fi@@ xed In@@ come Analy@@ stin at Schw@@ ab , in an analysis . &quot;
Jones believes that the markets have already adapted to F@@ ed strategy expectations .
&quot; in addition to the strength of the dollar and the decline in inflation expectations , there are some signs that the market has adapted to the prospect of stric@@ ter monetary policy , &quot; she wrote . &quot;
&quot; short @-@ term interest rates have risen , the earnings curve is flat@@ ter , bor@@ rowing have expanded and volati@@ lity has risen - all the characteristics of the market , when the F@@ ed has exac@@ erb@@ ated its strategy . &quot;
&quot; in the large and whole , companies that handle the greater part of their business operations in the US will benefit if interest rates are rising and local products become more attractive . &quot;
&quot; multinational companies with high debts become worse , as an increasing dollar makes their products more expensive on the global market , and also the financing of their debts . &quot;
&quot; the story shows that &quot; &quot; quality &quot; &quot; shares tend to react very positively three months after an initial interest rate increase , &quot; said Gold@@ man Sach@@ s analysts in a report for the customers . &quot;
&quot; companies with a strong balance sheet have exceeded 5 percentage points after each of the interest rates in 1994 , 1999 and 2004 . &quot;
companies with high capital yields and low volati@@ lity with their shares also exceeded their counter@@ parts with low quality at an average of 4 ( percentage points ) and 3 ( percentage points ) .
debt will be a major problem .
&quot; companies with a high proportion of flexible interest rates will lose most , Gold@@ man said . &quot;
&quot; outside the pure stock games , consumers will also benefit from the rising dollar . &quot;
&quot; savings could see profits by higher yields , even if experts of different opinions are how quickly this will take place . &quot;
&quot; BBC Radio 3 is a copy of the Classic FM , says MEP Andrew Bin@@ gham &quot;
&quot; the Con@@ servative member of Parliament critici@@ zed the broad@@ c@@ aster for his &quot; &quot; stupid &quot; &quot; &quot;
he ar@@ gues that he is increasingly difficult to distinguish from commercial ri@@ vals .
he also went to the BBC Music Awards and said that they im@@ it@@ ated The Br@@ its
Parliament @-@ colleague Dam@@ ien Col@@ lins attacked the broadcast The Voice and said that this was not very original .
&quot; BBC Radio 3 turns into &quot; &quot; Classic FM , &quot; &quot; claims a leading member of the Parliament and increases new pressure on the transmitter , to prove that he does something what the private sen@@ ders do not do . &quot;
&quot; the Con@@ servative MP Andrew Bin@@ gham also said the BBC @-@ bos@@ ses that the public @-@ legal radio station &quot; &quot; mu@@ te &quot; &quot; and increasingly no longer be distinguished from its commercial competi@@ tor . &quot;
&quot; radio 3 seems - I don &apos;t like to use the word &quot; &quot; stupid &quot; &quot; - but it seems to turn to Classic FM , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; he also quoted the BBC Music Awards , which started last December . &quot;
&quot; the BBC Music Awards , which started last year , seem to be the Br@@ its only under another name . &quot;
&quot; so , if you try to do something else - these are two spontaneous examples where you actually only im@@ itate what is already on the market , &quot; said Mr Bin@@ gham . &quot;
BBC general director dismis@@ sed the alleg@@ ations and argued that BBC Radio 3 is far ahead of his commercial competi@@ tor when it comes to live music and educ@@ ating the public .
&quot; what I learn from Radio 3 , I &apos;m not going to learn about classical music anywhere else . &quot;
and there is a commitment to live music and music that is really un@@ matched .
&quot; and the commitment of Radio 3 to find new music and to give new works on behalf , I think it is important , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of this year , BBC Radio 3 Controller Alan Dav@@ ey argued that harder to work was to engage the audience as it did in the past , because the British were less informed about classical music . &quot;
&quot; however , Radio 3 was not the only element of BBC production , which during the hearing in the Committee for the Selection of Culture , Media and Sport came under fire to step up commercial ri@@ vals on the feet . &quot;
&quot; the T@@ ory MEP Dam@@ ien Col@@ lins attacked The Voice - the BBC &apos;s musical talent show , which was bought by the Dutch producer T@@ alp@@ a Media for estimated costs of 22 million £ . &quot;
do you see why this program is often discussed because it is not original and not particularly striking ?
Lord Hall insi@@ sted that the BBC 1 show - with Pal@@ oma Faith and Boy George was produced as a judge - &quot; on special BBC way . &quot;
&quot; he added , he wants the company to find &quot; a hit from our in @-@ house stable , &quot; if the next time it star@@ ed a series of entertainment . &quot;
&quot; however , he refused to exclu@@ de the order from other rows of The Voice in the future or to give money to the fee pay@@ ers for other entertainment formats . &quot;
Internet sales increased in August at slow@@ est and the Black Friday can be responsible for it
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; last month , there was the lowest score since the beginning of the records in 2000 . &quot;
online sales increased three years ago by using mobile phones for shopping
experts believe that Black Friday has slow@@ ed down spending in November
&quot; for over a decade , the virtual shopping has been om@@ itted , and many of the UK &apos;s main shopping streets have turned into ghost towns . &quot;
&quot; experts say that there are signs now that online sales stagn@@ ate , after new figures showed only seven percent in the first three months of 2015 . &quot;
the total expenditure for August presented the lowest rise in growth since the beginning of the records in 2000 with only five percent increase compared to the previous year .
&quot; experts say that there are signs that online sales stagn@@ ate , after new figures showed only seven percent growth in the first three months of 2015 &quot;
&quot; if you look at the growth rates for the previous years and go back to 2000 , it has always been developed over time , &quot; said Andy Mul@@ c@@ ah@@ y , editor of the IM@@ RG sales index to the Guardian . &quot;
&quot; he stated that online sales increased three years ago , as buyers started to make purchases with their mobile phones . &quot;
&quot; it meant that more people could buy online and that people could do this in different environments , for example at home on the sofa . &quot;
&quot; but now that is , and we may experience that growth is reduced . &quot;
&quot; the Black @-@ Friday phenomenon , imported from America , is cited as a reason for the las@@ hing turno@@ vers . &quot;
&quot; experts believe that buyers will hold their purchases before this event , which will take place last Friday in November . &quot;
&quot; last year , five times the average number of buyers around their computers to make their bar@@ gains , and some dealer websites crashed . &quot;
&quot; experts believe that Black Friday , in which the buyer comb@@ ats against bar@@ gains , could prevent buyers from making purchases . &quot;
a study by the British Retail Con@@ sortium found out that £ 5 spent a bit more than 1 £ online .
&quot; for some products such as TV and washing machines , more than one third of purchases are now carried out via web @-@ shops . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , more than one quarter of people bu@@ ys clothes and shoes online instead of fashion chains in the inner cities . &quot;
Muslims buried in Mec@@ ca near the crane accident - B@@ in Lad@@ ens &apos;s family is sanc@@ tioned
the dead bodies of 29 dead are carried by Muslims at first fun@@ er@@ als in Mec@@ ca through the streets
Saudi Arabia partially destro@@ ys the collapse of the huge Saudi B@@ in Laden group
&quot; the Ministry of Health , that in addition , a total of 394 people were injured after the crane rus@@ hed &quot;
hundreds of Muslims assembled as 29 of the victims were carried by the streets to bury those who were killed when a crane was collap@@ sed to Mec@@ ca &apos;s grandfather .
&quot; gri@@ eving , largely dressed in white , the track to t@@ olls their respect , when the first of the dead came their last journey to the Al @-@ Mo@@ dena @-@ gra@@ vey@@ ard . &quot;
&quot; the fun@@ eral proc@@ ession passed on to the Holy site , where only days before a building crane rus@@ hed through the ceiling of the mos@@ que and then fell on the beds . &quot;
&quot; the cor@@ p@@ ses were released for the fun@@ eral , when the Saudi king over the construction company of the B@@ in Laden caused the disaster , which left 394 injured , a san@@ ction . &quot;
&quot; the bodies of 29 dr@@ yers who were killed when a crane rus@@ hed through the Great Central mo@@ sch@@ ee Mec@@ ca , were carried through the streets . &quot;
&quot; among the dead was Q@@ asi@@ m Ak@@ ram from Bol@@ ton , Greater Manchester , father of four children , who was on his first pilgrimage as the crane under@@ went . &quot;
Mr Ak@@ ram was with his parents before the beginning of the annual H@@ add@@ sch in the Great Mos@@ que .
&quot; Saudi officials have already stated that the h@@ add@@ les are going to Mec@@ ca with thousands , who will continue to come to the city . &quot;
&quot; today King Sal@@ man said , the B@@ in Laden group should not have stopped the arm of the crane , when he was not used . &quot;
&quot; an Arab version of the decree , published by the State of Saudi Press Agency , said that the B@@ in Laden group was responsible for the collapse . &quot;
&quot; the English speaking service of the news agency did not report this detail , but said that the guidance of the company abroad had been banned . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of this week , Sal@@ man had to reveal what caused the fall of the crane , which crashed into an inner courtyard of the Grand@@ mo@@ sch@@ ee , where hundreds of thousands of Muslims in front of the H@@ add@@ sch , which later takes place this month , gathered themselves together . &quot;
&quot; the B@@ in Laden group did not have any statements on the collapse of the crane , and their representatives were not available for a statement . &quot;
the Royal decree also did not ad@@ here to the group because of no current security measures and because they did not cooperate with meteor@@ ologists .
dozens of cranes surround Mek@@ ka &apos;s big mo@@ sch@@ ee as part of the massive construction project led by the B@@ in Laden group .
&quot; for decades , the B@@ in Laden family has been connected to the royal family of Saudi Arabia and takes over larger construction projects . &quot;
&quot; the dec@@ eased leader of Al Qaeda , Os@@ ama bin Laden , was a little son who was kid@@ n@@ apped by the family in the 1990 @-@ s . &quot;
&quot; the crash of the crane came amid strong winds and rain , only a few days before the arrival of millions in the kingdom for the pilgrimage , which is needed at least once in the life of any healthy Muslims . &quot;
officials said that 158 people remain in hospital .
&quot; government representatives ordered that 1 million Ri@@ al ( £ 17@@ 4,000 ) were paid to the members of the slain , and the same amount of permanently injured . &quot;
other ones will receive half of this amount .

&quot; it is said that Brit@@ ons put their h@@ amm@@ ers and brushes in favour of the use of qualified East European craftsmen , who carry out their work in their home , &quot;
&quot; if you are sk@@ ill@@ ful with a hammer or a brush for painting walls , nowadays you seem to be a minority today . &quot;
&quot; the British are increasingly working craftsmen to carry out DIY jobs in their homes , so the boss of the company behind B &amp; Q . &quot;
&quot; V@@ é@@ ron@@ ique Lau@@ ry , new managing director from King@@ fis@@ her , who owns the DIY chain , said that a large increase in the number of skilled tra@@ des@@ men from Eastern Europe , offering services to low prices , is now over@@ hau@@ led . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , King@@ fis@@ her plans to open 200 other scre@@ w@@ fix shops , which are aimed at arti@@ sans and to close to 60 outlets from B &amp; Q . &quot;
&quot; Mrs Lau@@ ry said she wants more women in B &amp; Q shops , because eight of ten purchasing decisions are made by women . &quot;
&quot; at the moment , men weigh the men . &quot;
&quot; she said , it is necessary to face the growing demographic trends that have more feminine single households having more renov@@ ations than in the past . &quot;
Mrs Lau@@ ry said : &quot; it still works a majority of men in our branches .
we need to shift this stronger towards a balance .
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
women play a major role in the decision @-@ making process .
&quot; Mrs Lau@@ ry , who is one of only five women at the top of a British company in the FT@@ SE@@ 100 index , has also instruc@@ ted her top team to reflect the same number of men and women in executive positions . &quot;
&quot; King@@ Fis@@ her is almost the only company that occupies exactly 50 percent of the team with women , including his management and financial officer . &quot;
Mrs Lau@@ ry said : &quot; this was a conscious decision - diversity here is an important issue here .
it was not difficult to find good women for our Supervisory Board .
King@@ Fis@@ her reported a decline in half @-@ year profit and sales after the Group re@@ counted the cost of closing the shops .
&quot; because of the trend , King@@ fis@@ her , the Scre@@ w@@ fix and B &amp; Q , will open 200 new stores . &quot;
function@@ aries of A@@ ich / D@@ whether due to un@@ faith@@ fulness in court
&quot; on Wednesday , on Wednesday two function@@ aries of the Austrian Vol@@ leyball @-@ Vi@@ zem@@ ei@@ sters A@@ ich / D@@ ob will have to be responsible for lack of fi@@ del@@ ity and expenditure . &quot;
the accused ple@@ aded not guilty .
one of them had also been indic@@ ted for office abuse .
&quot; from this accus@@ ation , he was legally acqu@@ itted in May . &quot;
the current trial was ad@@ jour@@ ned .
&quot; according to the chief prosec@@ utor Robert Ri@@ ffel , the accused had cryst@@ alli@@ zed in the preliminary investigation that the def@@ endants in the years 2006 until 2011 were able to disp@@ ose of association accounts of which they were allowed to disp@@ ose of their functions , used for private purposes . &quot;
&quot; he charges the damage with around 400@@ ,000 euros . &quot;
the sports @-@ function@@ aries are also indic@@ ted for financial fail@@ ures .
&quot; this fact was the chairman of the Sch@@ öff@@ el@@ sen@@ ate , judge Micha@@ ela San@@ in . &quot;
it should be negoti@@ ated at a later date .
&quot; to the accus@@ ation of in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity , the defence argued that the association was at no point an asset . &quot;
&quot; sports officials would have charged only expenses and the sports club , for which they had invested between 1982 and 2011 , and in which they had invested a lot of time and money out of debt - the pas@@ si@@ vation in 2001 amounted to about 600@@ ,000 sch@@ illing ( approx . 44@@ .000 euros ) . &quot;
&quot; at that time , we stood before the situation : do we continue or block the club ? &quot; , &quot; one of the accused , in bread profession , said a large @-@ scale inspec@@ tor of the financial officer . &quot;
&quot; with his colleagues and co @-@ accused , he decided to take over this task . &quot;
with all risks .
&quot; we have advanced money , put our life insurance as a security at the bank , &quot; &quot; he said during the withdrawal . &quot;
&quot; the association has been agreed : you can manage the money freely , no debts must be made . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , in case of corresponding financial - success , the reimbur@@ sement of the expenses compens@@ ated retro@@ actively until 1991 . &quot;
&quot; therefore , one has paid a part of the expenses only years later , namely from 2003 when a plus was paid to the account . &quot;
&quot; therefore , l@@ ump sum and not detail statements seemed to be explained , the former Ob@@ mann explained the processes . &quot;
&quot; accounts and savings accounts managed the two def@@ endants , the second def@@ endant said . &quot;
&quot; why the pay@@ outs were not disclosed in detail to the association , the judge asked . &quot;
&quot; the association has not been interested in detail for financial services , it is important to have the freedom of debt , thus the answer . &quot;
&quot; as in 2011 , against which a function@@ ary investigation began for office abuse , an amount of 120,000 Euro was transferred to the association &apos;s account . &quot;
&quot; that had been set@@ backs , the def@@ endants asser@@ ted . &quot;
this securities account ran to the name of the second def@@ endant and was not known according to the association &apos;s statement .
&quot; why ? &quot; &quot; the judge wanted to know . &quot;
&quot; on top of that , the respon@@ dent did not know any answer for a long time . &quot;
&quot; then he finally said , he believed that this was the best for the association . &quot;
&quot; if something had happened to him , nobody would have known anything of that money , the prosec@@ utor asked in the room . &quot;
&quot; the co @-@ accused had been informed , justified the function@@ ary . &quot;
&quot; this transfer was formulated as &quot; &quot; damage compensation &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; why in@@ dem@@ nity claims ? , judge and prosec@@ utor wanted to know . &quot;
&quot; the first def@@ endant explained that he did not agree with this wor@@ ding , because the association had never been damaged . &quot;
&quot; but what should I do if the lawyer says , &quot; &quot; With him you are all out of the tailor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; am I a legal representative ? &quot; &quot; he asked . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , the function@@ ary , he never covered a cent salary , he only reck@@ oned with mil@@ eage and di@@ ets . &quot;
&quot; on di@@ ets he charged the association 1,000 euros per month , but the actual effort was much higher , he added . &quot;
the def@@ endants were not able to show exact documents for the early years .
&quot; these are after an audit in which everything was assessed correctly , they explained . &quot;
o@@ dom@@ eter money was also referred to as the second def@@ endant .
&quot; all dwell@@ ings are in cash , and he explained in his statement from his place of residence to the Bank to Blei@@ burg . &quot;
the main hearing will be continued on 23 September with the survey of witnesses .
Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard sets another 30.000 Jobs
&quot; in addition to the ongoing personnel breakdown for three years , the computer giant will replace further jobs when spl@@ itting the company . &quot;
the positions in the US computer giant Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard ( HP ) do not end .
&quot; as part of its restructuring , the U.S. technology group is planning to disman@@ tle 25,000 to 30,000 jobs in its corporate division . &quot;
&quot; thus , costs in the amount of 2.7 billion dollars ( € 2.4 billion ) are to be saved , distributed the company on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; the step will lead to a special burden of around 2.7 billion dollars , which will be incurred from the fourth quarter . &quot;
&quot; the reduction of 55@@ ,000 jobs has not yet been completed for three years . &quot;
&quot; at the end of fiscal 2013 / 14 , HP employed around 30@@ 2,000 employees . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; currently , the corporation with printers from the Califor@@ nian Pal@@ o Alto currently spl@@ its up : so the computer and printer business will be bund@@ led even more in a new society - separate from the more promising areas with computer servers and data storage for companies as well as other services . &quot;
both business parts are to be listed on the stock market .
&quot; a further dis@@ ap@@ pointing PC sales , as well as a weaker demand for company customers in accordance with its services , was last the world &apos;s second @-@ largest PC manufacturer to Lenovo . &quot;
&quot; in the third quarter of July , sales of PC and printers declined by 11.@@ 5 percent . &quot;
sales fell by 8 percent to just under 25.@@ 4 billion dollars .
&quot; in this way , revenues were returned to 15 out of 16 quarters . &quot;

conflict : majority supports the anti @-@ IS training mission
&quot; however , a direct involvement of German soldiers in combat operations in Iraq would mainly come to rejection : 54 percent spoke against it , 35 percent were agre@@ eing . &quot;
&quot; while other countries fly air strikes against the IS in Iraq and Syria , 61 percent will be positive . &quot;
forecasts to 2019 illustrate how the market is set to change .

R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke : violent erup@@ tion at Serbian @-@ Hungarian border
the Hungarian police have deployed on the Serbian border with R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as and water @-@ laun@@ chers against several hundred refugees .
Eur@@ on@@ ews correspon@@ dent D@@ á@@ ni@@ el Bo@@ z@@ si@@ k has witnessed the violent erup@@ tion at the border control point .
he reported by phone :
a group of refugees broke through the border .
&quot; behind them , a police line had formed and behind the polic@@ emen there was a water designer ready . &quot;
&quot; 40 to 50 refugees started throwing stones , sticks and plastic bottles to the officials . &quot;
the officials started at first un@@ interrupted pepper spray .
&quot; after that , the police used tear gas . &quot;
much tear gas was spra@@ yed in the direction of the refugees .
&quot; in this way , the group was dissolved . &quot;
the refugees have now with@@ drawn a little while .
a pregnant and apparently injured woman was removed from the zone .
&quot; children , who had inhal@@ ed the Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as , cried out . &quot;
other refugees put in themselves together and suffered under difficulty .
the press spokes@@ persons of the Ser@@ b police suffered injuries through the use of tear gas and pepper spray .
time of decision on interest rates for the US emergency tank
&quot; the world ob@@ serves when the US emergency tank arrives in two days , on Wednesday and Thursday , to make the most important decision whether the interest raised for the first time for almost a decade or not . &quot;
&quot; a survey conducted among 80 econom@@ ists questioned by Reuters , found out that a little more than half , the last week of view was that the F@@ ed will do this , now thinks that the F@@ ed will continue to pers@@ ist and interest rates on the current level of 0 - 0.25 percent will keep . &quot;
&quot; it is a historical event , because it has been seven years since the F@@ ed interest paid to NU@@ LL . &quot;
&quot; for the first time , we approach a situation where a large central bank may be leaving the zero area and starts a process of norm@@ alisation of interest rates , &quot; said Angel U@@ bid , Head of Staff at Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot;
&quot; the US economy is based on a relatively good performance level , tril@@ lion dollars are added to the balance sheet and generate only a low inflation . &quot;
&quot; however , the F@@ ed cannot ignore the less crude outlook on global conditions . &quot;
&quot; it has warned the markets to adapt to an increase , but the signs point out that the odds against such a step are good . &quot;
the decision should be announced at 20.00 CET on Thursday
death Sent@@ ence at the Delta State University left Deb@@ t Deb@@ t
&quot; after shooting and killing his girl@@ friend in Miss@@ issi@@ ppi on Monday morning - and before he killed his colleagues on the day , Sh@@ ann@@ on Lamb wrote a note to say that he was &quot; &quot; sorry &quot; &quot; at the first murder and wanted , &quot; &quot; he could make it happen , &quot; &quot; gave authorities on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; police in Gau@@ tier , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , said that Lamb , lectur@@ er for ge@@ ography and social science education at Delta State University , called the emergency number at 10 : 00 on Monday morning &quot;
&quot; and said he had shot on someone , and someone killed . &quot;
Lamb said to the staff of the emergency centre that police need to send polic@@ emen to his home .
&quot; he said , &quot; &quot; I shot my wife yesterday evening &quot; &quot; and he also mentioned that a &quot; &quot; sweet dog &quot; &quot; was in the house but nobody will distur@@ b &quot; &quot; but probably be excited . &quot;
&quot; the police asked the call@@ ers after his name , but he did not give him . &quot;
Lamb did not give any explanation for his shots .
&quot; as police entered the scene , they found the body of Amy Pr@@ enti@@ ss , 41 , and a hand@@ written note from Lamb , 45 who said : &quot; I &apos;m sorry , I wanted , I could undo it . &quot;
&quot; I loved Amy , and she is the only woman who ever loved me . &quot;
&quot; after writing the note , Lamb received 300 miles to the Delta State University , where he killed E@@ than Schmidt , a professor for history , killing him before he finally took his own life on Monday evening , as polic@@ emen . &quot;
&quot; President William LA@@ FOR@@ GE said he didn &apos;t know anything about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs &apos;s performance . &quot;
&quot; despite reports on Monday that Lamb allegedly believed that Pr@@ enti@@ ss had a relationship with Schmidt , authorities said on Tuesday , there is &quot; no information , no evidence &quot; for a &quot; tri@@ angular relationship . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Pr@@ enti@@ ss was written by Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , who said that she was married about seven years as a &quot; good person . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the two were divor@@ ced 15 years ago , but remained friends . &quot;
&quot; O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said he and Pr@@ enti@@ ss would have a daughter who is 19 , and she was &quot; &quot; destroyed &quot; &quot; on the ground . &quot;
he said that Pr@@ enti@@ ss was her daughter &quot; absolutely best friends . &quot;
&quot; Pr@@ enti@@ ss worked online from home , according to L@@ ins@@ day Know@@ les , identified by Sun Her@@ ald as a close friend of Pr@@ enti@@ ss . &quot;
&quot; Know@@ les said that Pr@@ enti@@ ss , who had a dog named Light@@ ning , met with Lamb for about three years . &quot;
&quot; she wanted to help other people , &quot; &quot; said Know@@ les &quot;
&quot; the police said that Lamb had called relatives at a certain time on Monday to tell them , &quot; &quot; he does not go to prison . &quot;
&quot; when polic@@ emen took him on Highway 1 near Green@@ ville later in that night , Lamb drove his car to the side , fled to foot , ran into the forest and killed himself with a shot . &quot;
Lamb received a doc@@ torate in spring 2015 from the Delta State University as his life lau on the university &apos;s website .

Eu@@ row@@ ings : Lufthansa is building the Group
Lufthansa is planning a large Group restructuring .
the Lufthansa Group wants to save a half billion euros a year alone with a better organization .
150 of the around 1000 managers around the world will cost Group sales to the workplace .
there are new negotiations with the pilot union .
Lufthansa is expanding its corporate structure and evalu@@ ates Eu@@ row@@ ings &apos;s billi@@ ards .
&quot; the aim of the re@@ orientation is an income contribution of around € 500 million a year from cost and revenue syner@@ gies , the airline distributed on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; among other things , there will be no more executive board for the passenger business in the future . &quot;
the Eu@@ row@@ ings balance line should be developed as independent as possible .
in future Karl Ulrich Gar@@ n@@ adt will be responsible for Eu@@ row@@ ings in the management team headed by Carsten Sp@@ oh@@ r .
&quot; in the future , Sp@@ oh@@ r emphas@@ ises the importance of Eu@@ row@@ ings with which the Group wants to compete against Ry@@ an@@ air and Easy@@ jet . &quot;
&quot; until now , the organization of the 120,000 employees was complex . &quot;
&quot; the airlines operate under the roof of the Passage Air@@ line Group , representing three quarters of annual revenues of € 30 billion . &quot;
new negotiations with the pilots
&quot; in the Tari@@ ff conflict with the cock@@ pit pilot association ( VC ) , negotiations are scheduled to be res@@ um@@ ed after the strike on this Thursday . &quot;
that shared the union with .
the theme of the talks should be the retirement control for pilots .
&quot; in a year with a projected record result , &quot; &quot; cock@@ pit wool &quot; &quot; will result in viable results as soon as possible . &quot;
the conflict between union and airline led to various strikes in recent months .
&quot; in addition to the interim supply of pilots , the background is the Spar@@ kasse &quot; &quot; Wings &quot; . &quot; &quot;

Luke Sha@@ w of Manchester United can &apos;t play for months because of double fra@@ cture
Luke Sha@@ w suffered a double fra@@ cture of his right leg at the Champions League defeat of Manchester at PS@@ V Ein@@ dho@@ ven .
&quot; while this brought the left foreign @-@ champion to crying and closing it for at least six months from the games , Louis van Ga@@ al will not give hope that Sha@@ w can play in this season . &quot;
the injury was caused by a ru@@ th@@ less attack by H@@ é@@ ctor Mor@@ eno in the 15th minute after the 20 year old Sha@@ w was in the PS@@ V area .
he was treated for nine minutes on the field and needed oxygen before he was brought to hospital .
&quot; van Ga@@ al said : &quot; &quot; he has double bonds and is located in the hospital . &quot;
he will be reloc@@ ated tomorrow or perhaps one day later and then operated in Manchester .
&quot; it &apos;s terrible - a boy who comes with 18 to Manchester United , it has very hard and then plays fantastic , and then it happens . &quot;
in the dressing cabin he had an oxygen mask .
he cried .
&quot; I am not a doctor , but if you have a double fra@@ cture , then it takes six months , and it will not play in the group phase . &quot;
I hope he can play this season again .
Mor@@ eno seemed happy to escape a Red Card and the suspension of an El@@ f@@ meter .
&quot; Nic@@ ola Ri@@ zz@@ oli , the refer@@ ee , did not pun@@ ish the Mexican . &quot;
van Ga@@ al presum@@ ed that the Italian refer@@ ee had mistaken .
they can judge for themselves when I say that an El@@ f@@ meter and a red card were due .
it was a very bad attack with both legs .
&quot; a twe@@ et on Sha@@ ws account said , &quot; &quot; I thank you all for your messages . words cannot describe how broken I am , my way to recovery begins right now , I get stronger again . &quot;
related to : Manchester United suff@@ ers the loss of Luke Sha@@ w in defeat at PS@@ V
&quot; with the European champ@@ ionships in France , the England def@@ ender has an additional incentive to recover until the coming of June . &quot;
&quot; Phil@@ lip Co@@ c@@ u , the PS@@ V @-@ Trainer , said : &quot; it is a very bad injury . &quot;
&quot; if a player with this kind of injury leaves the place , all are very sad about it . &quot;
it is never the intention of our players to viol@@ ate an opponent .
Mor@@ eno suffered a leg @-@ break when Mexico played against Van Ga@@ als Holland team at the World Cup in 2014 .
&quot; he is very hard because it was not his intention to hurt the opponent , and if you hear that it is a very bad injury , that &apos;s not good , &quot; said Co@@ c@@ u . &quot;
for me it was not possible to see the moment .
&quot; the only thing I could see was the ball rolling in another direction , so it looked like he had touched him , but I couldn &apos;t see the attack on Luke . &quot;
&quot; in conversation with S@@ BS@@ 6 Mor@@ eno said : &quot; I know how it feels , I know how difficult it can be . &quot;
I feel very bad about it . I &apos;m so sorry .
the PS@@ V player Andr@@ és Gu@@ ard@@ ado was also brought to the hospital - after a f@@ oul@@ ding by Chris Sm@@ alling .
certainly David Cameron knows The Lor@@ ax better ?
&quot; it is a matter that all parents will soon learn : if your child loves a book , it will not take long before you know it almost . &quot;
unless you are David Cameron .
&quot; when he was asked by a provider of child care systems to call his favorite children &apos;s book , the Minister @-@ President for The Lor@@ ax , which was published in 1971 by Dr. Se@@ uss . &quot;
&quot; it was a difficult choice , writes Cameron in a message on the website of Super@@ Camp@@ s , and continues : &quot; funny , moving , creative and with a powerful message , it &apos;s a book that I like to read my children because it always seems to have missed a picture or message we have missed so far . &quot;
&quot; everything nice and good , except that the following paragraph , in which Cameron suppos@@ edly describes the plot of the book , instead of giving back an ingredient of the 2012 movie version , added the new characters and details to extend the rather short original text . &quot;
&quot; in the midst of the w@@ alled city of Th@@ need @-@ Ville , where all nature has gone and even the air is a commodity , a boy named Ted , the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , meets the girl of his dreams , reads it . a love interest was Dr. Se@@ uss , whose real name was Theodor Se@@ uss Gei@@ sel and died in 1991 but completely unknown . &quot;
&quot; as if that would not be suspic@@ ious enough : the text presented by Cameron is partly read like the summary of the Lor@@ ax movie , which is presented on the website of Internet Movie Database and thus begins : &quot; in the w@@ alled city of Th@@ need @-@ Ville , where everything is artificial and even the air is a commodity , a boy named Ted hopes to win the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , the girl of his dreams . &quot;
&quot; although he ad@@ mits to be a pra@@ g@@ matic father , it seems unlikely that Cameron is so little familiar to the act of the book . here , a un@@ named boy , like the local environment , comes to a ho@@ ck@@ ling , snow@@ y creatures , &quot; &quot; that speaks in the name of the trees , &quot; &quot; is devast@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; most likely , such a relatively low PR task was deleg@@ ated to a hel@@ per who did not read The Lor@@ ax for 20 times in a row . &quot;
&quot; one Dow@@ ning Street spokes@@ woman said , that the text was probably come from Cameron &apos;s election agency . &quot;
&quot; Super@@ Camp@@ s confirmed that the text was delivered by Cameron &apos;s staff , but there was no further immediate comments . &quot;
&quot; Adam Ly@@ th was clearly threatened with the exclusion from England &apos;s team , but it is still difficult . &quot;
&quot; encounter@@ ing Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task , but if you have chosen the Ka@@ der , England for the tour , a re@@ petition of the 3 @-@ 0 test series defeat is not on my card . &quot;
I would not exclu@@ de a forward victory .
&quot; the A@@ last@@ air C@@ ooks page may be less experienced than the three years ago , but there are good spin players in the bat@@ ting list , and the community spirit is strong ; they will not carry any sc@@ ars of 2012 , just a y@@ outh@@ ful positive attitude . &quot;
&quot; with the ball , Mo@@ een Ali develops as Spin Bow@@ ler and Adi@@ l Ras@@ hid , even if it represents an unknown size on test level , is an option for the attack . &quot;
this news : Adam Ly@@ th leaves the England test cad@@ res and replaced by Alex H@@ ales .
&quot; leaving Adam Ly@@ th , of course , is hard to analyze for me as his boss trainer in Yor@@ k@@ shire . &quot;
&quot; with its seven tests , there were two good attacks under difficult conditions , and the simple but hard reality is that cri@@ cket players are aimed at results . &quot;
&quot; there was no question mark at Joe R@@ oot , for example , and that led to the nom@@ ination , there - and I said this before - players are their own best performers . &quot;
&quot; a long time ago , he had extended the run of Ly@@ th , but he had control of his own fate . &quot;
&quot; if he hopefully turns out more runs for Yor@@ k@@ shire , another chance comes . &quot;
&quot; the England @-@ Trainer Tre@@ vor Bay@@ lis@@ s praised his attitude , even if he did not have such good performances , and that doesn &apos;t surprise me ; he is above all a team man . &quot;
the question of how much time a test schl@@ ager gets to set his character is difficult .
&quot; Ly@@ th got seven chances , like Sam Rob@@ son in front of him , while Nick Comp@@ ton got nine . &quot;
only comp@@ ton got the chance for home and down@@ play .
&quot; the only accus@@ ation that can be raised was that England first sat down in the Caribbean at first - when Ly@@ th was in top shape , but this lost chance is now in the past . &quot;
&quot; Alex H@@ ales comes in , and he is a perc@@ us@@ sion@@ ist that I set up high . &quot;
&quot; he is an X @-@ factor cri@@ cket player , what we saw at Yor@@ k@@ shire early in this season when he scored 236 against us on a Tr@@ ent Bridge , which met us very much . &quot;
&quot; he must have at least the same chances as those before him , but this depends naturally on the position of the team in the United Arab Emirates . &quot;
&quot; the idea to make mos@@ ques alongside Cook , which would give an extra spin @-@ bow@@ ler and get four qu@@ icks , appeared , and I have nothing against it . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t see why a stroke can &apos;t beat there , and this lef@@ th@@ or has already shown that he is a devil &apos;s cri@@ cket of cri@@ cket players . &quot;
&quot; mos@@ ques may not have done his job for his County Wor@@ c@@ ester@@ shire , but he is a number 3 for them , and there is no big difference . &quot;
&quot; my former team mate Jus@@ tin Lan@@ ger played his first 38 tests at the first drop , before he appeared as op@@ ener in 2001 . &quot;
he immediately abol@@ ished three hundred steps and did not look back .
&quot; Z@@ af@@ ar Ans@@ ari comes into the ca@@ der as a back @-@ up sp@@ inner , and in my limited interaction with him he has impressed me as a young man . &quot;
&quot; people may see his statistics on average 31 with the bat and 35 with the ball - and think it &apos;s a pun@@ t , but there is no large number of backup spi@@ ders that raise their hands and the trainers have decided for youth . &quot;
he will learn a lot on this tour .
&quot; apart from the team , England made a few clever additions to the coach . &quot;
&quot; the appointment of Mah@@ ela Jay@@ awar@@ dene , the B@@ ats@@ man from Sri Lanka , as a consultant for the test games could be a masterpiece . &quot;
&quot; he is one of the nic@@ est guys in the game , who will bring a wealth of experiences as it has played under all conditions and against all the attacks . &quot;
Paul Coll@@ ing@@ wood comes for the white ball @-@ phase of the tour and brings energy and a powerful application into the setup .
&quot; I always felt that he was created for the international cri@@ cket competition , as a player or as coach , and like Mah@@ ela he has insights from which we can benefit . &quot;
&quot; sometimes new voices can bring fresh air in the changing cabin , even if the messages are in line with the previously said . &quot;
&quot; Coll@@ ys te@@ amm@@ ate at Dur@@ ham , Ben St@@ okes , is not used for the One @-@ Day@@ ers , R@@ oot got a similar break to Australia and I have no problem with it . &quot;
&quot; some will not agree , but coaches and team actors do not determine the schedule . &quot;
and you must remember that as with players their jobs depend on the results .
such decisions are not made easy in heart .
&quot; the Bre@@ x@@ it camp ( Bre@@ x@@ it = Out of Britain out of the EU ) could gain access to Zul@@ u , if the economy was in a lu@@ te until 2017 . &quot;
&quot; David Cameron &apos;s un@@ elabor@@ ated re @-@ action strategy to keep Britain in the EU will get deeper into trouble with every day , even without the election of the brilliant Jerem@@ y &quot; &quot; Is it Yes or No ? &quot; &quot; Cor@@ by@@ n to the leader of Labour or the TU@@ C who fought hard for Europe on Tuesday . &quot;
foreigners also have their Cor@@ by@@ ns and Ni@@ gel Far@@ ages .
&quot; a European diplom@@ at friend said recently that some member states , so deeply ent@@ angled in various crises , as the EU is now time and not always from its own guilt , Britain itself created agenda with split conc@@ essions and distur@@ bing contract changes that they usually don &apos;t want . &quot;
&quot; in Bri@@ gh@@ ton , the TU@@ C decided at its annual meeting , that it does not like it if they end@@ anger the social protection . &quot;
we could also call it Dave and Georges Sel@@ f@@ ie agenda .
&quot; the prime minister and finance ministers climb on summit or bilateral meetings in foreign capitals , making a photo of themselves in front of a famous local monument , with or without local sizes , then come home and say that they win allies for reforms . &quot;
it &apos;s always about me .
&quot; my European friend , who wishes a Great Britain looking outside of the EU @-@ tent - &quot; &quot; Let &apos;s not alone with France , &quot; &quot; says Berlin - and lets see that more and more short @-@ si@@ ghted ministers and officials have come to the point where it doesn &apos;t matter whether we stay or go . &quot;
&quot; Germany &apos;s cau@@ tious Chancellor Angela Merkel is an ally , but she has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave the office before it looks bad for her as with the exagger@@ ated long endurance as th@@ at@@ cher ( 11 years ) , Mit@@ terr@@ and ( 14 ) and K@@ ohl ( 16 ) . &quot;
French François Hollande looks at his re @-@ election or his replacement in 2017 .
he is also a scor@@ ching force .
&quot; Poland soon has a nation@@ alist right government , Spain a left wing . &quot;
&quot; it is hard to imagine that they will tear a leg to help the Sel@@ f@@ ie British , whose energy should be used to prevent Scotland from the UK - something they don &apos;t want , because most similar separ@@ ati@@ st tendencies have . &quot;
&quot; therefore , some such ministers may even plan not inten@@ tionally un@@ clear comments , entirely in the SN@@ P style , while Britain &apos;s referendum campaign in 2017 to speed up the Bre@@ x@@ it process , my friend susp@@ ects . &quot;
&quot; the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation was a loan &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; Great Britain has won &apos;t any value from the new tre@@ ati@@ se . &quot;
&quot; Europeans know how pre@@ dat@@ ory the Fle@@ et Street can be at their cost , and which EU scep@@ tics are the oli@@ gar@@ chy of the press level , as they did not support our entry in 1975 with a ratio of 2 : 1 . &quot;
&quot; they can be weak to remember Boris Johnson , the Er@@ z @-@ Euro opportun@@ ists who made themselves a name as an &quot; &quot; EU straight ban@@ anas &quot; &quot; correspon@@ dent in the early 90 &apos;s . &quot;
&quot; with all its dec@@ ei@@ ght@@ ness , Ed Mili@@ band knew who were his enemies . &quot;
&quot; this included the Med@@ ley of tax @-@ fear@@ ing vil@@ la@@ ins , telephone @-@ h@@ acking foreign countries and the pseu@@ do non @-@ states that most of our large newspapers possess . &quot;
&quot; actually Tony Bla@@ ir thought about her , but noticed that when you sit with a hot gor@@ illa in a cage , you better spread ban@@ anas to distrac@@ t him instead of getting to his lunch and dinner . &quot;
&quot; in fact , Mili@@ band was more bla@@ zer than Bla@@ ir himself when he opposed Cameron &apos;s refer@@ end@@ ums , because Bla@@ ir had made the principle of the un@@ approved constitution of the EU , which was then rejected by French and Dutch voters in 2005 , which opened him a back@@ door . &quot;
the press has never for@@ fei@@ ted him .
&quot; but the nice Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n , who gave me a friendly fla@@ p on Monday in Westminster - I told him that he didn &apos;t need time for me - seems in danger of repe@@ ating N@@ eil Kin@@ no@@ ck Boy@@ cot@@ t Mur@@ doch strategy of the 80 @-@ year @-@ old , a mistake back then and today . &quot;
&quot; it can take , but he must develop a coher@@ ent strategy to win the media , not with me , but certainly with Andrew Mar@@ r , whose BBC sofa he left on Sunday . &quot;
Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s official position on Europe is - I sometimes express it - in the development .
he says that we should remain in a re@@ formed EU .
&quot; well , most people outside of U@@ ki@@ ps traditional Bl@@ auf@@ ar@@ b@@ stoff trend and the wil@@ ting bra@@ ins of Tor@@ ys Klein @-@ Eng@@ lander can certainly say yes . &quot;
&quot; it is what Hil@@ ary &quot; A Ben@@ n , but not Benn@@ ite &quot; Ben@@ n on the radio and on TV this week , when the boy@@ sc@@ outs fought in him , did not admit that Cor@@ by@@ ns had a bad idea as a shadow Chancellor . &quot;
&quot; it reminded me of the 70 &apos;s , when his old father tried to be il@@ loyal to his Labour cabinet colleagues without going too far and losing his cabinet job . &quot;
Hil@@ ary &apos;s fight was even more attractive .
&quot; but to fight to remain &quot; &quot; under all circumstances &quot; &quot; - Benn@@ &apos;s expression - was not what Mc@@ Donn@@ ell told what J@@ C told his comrades and de@@ pu@@ ties after all reports on her Kl@@ aus@@ age convention on Monday evening . &quot;
&quot; whatever the stir@@ ring bottom @-@ up image of Cor@@ by@@ n wants to convey - remember that he even stir@@ red me - News @-@ Dis@@ ci@@ pl@@ ine remains important in the age of TV around the clock and above all things in the vort@@ ex of social media , a breeding ground of par@@ ano@@ ia and betra@@ yal . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s right to give Cameron a free card for Europe that allows him to keep Lab@@ ours support in the referendum campaign for a matter of course , as Mc@@ Donn@@ ell said . &quot;
Simon J@@ enk@@ ins certainly thinks so .
&quot; but Mc@@ Donn@@ ell and Cor@@ by@@ ns fundamental ambig@@ u@@ ities about EU membership - in line with their Benn@@ ite Siege @-@ Economy , their anti @-@ capitalist past - is no longer just a question of es@@ ot@@ eric discussion among left dissi@@ dents , for which the nar@@ c@@ iss@@ ism of little difference is a central principle of dog@@ matic disputes . &quot;
&quot; as with its ambig@@ u@@ ities to N@@ ato - Tom Wat@@ son , it is firmly convinced that J@@ C does not start a campaign to exit - foreign diplom@@ ats will be required to try to find a sense of their superi@@ ors at home . &quot;
why should Paris or Berlin waste political capital - they also have suspic@@ ious voters - to make conc@@ essions to the British if all this can be meaning@@ less ?
&quot; the US is already quite disappointed with the weak military performance in Iraq , in Libya and Syria , even with a lowering of the T@@ ory government in power , which I was reminded of something that was reminded by British Influ@@ ence Security Forum on Monday . &quot;
experts critici@@ ze report from Public Health England on e @-@ cigar@@ ettes
&quot; claims of a state @-@ funded agency that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are less harmful than smoking arose from a meeting of 12 people , partly with connections to tobacco industry , said researchers . &quot;
&quot; experts working in the British Medical Journal ( BM@@ J ) , launched Lanc@@ et by critici@@ zing the evidence used by Public Health England ( P@@ he ) in her report on e @-@ cigar@@ ettes . &quot;
he published the &quot; Basic Report &quot; last month and describes it as a &quot; comprehensive review of evidence . &quot;
&quot; however , some researchers have questioned the resili@@ ence of data and pointed to the connections between some experts and the tobacco industry . &quot;
a editorial in the medical journal Lanc@@ et last month attacked the &quot; extra@@ ordin@@ arily win@@ dy basis &quot; on which P@@ he founded his most important conclusion .
two more researchers write in BM@@ J and asked whether the statements can be based on stone or sand .
&quot; Martin Mc@@ K@@ ee , Professor of European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Trop@@ ical Medicine and Simon Cap@@ e@@ well , Professor of Clinical Epidemiology at the University of Liverpool , said : &quot; a basic principle of public health is that strategies should be based on evidence of effectiveness . &quot;
&quot; they said that the public anticip@@ ates that &quot; &quot; the present best estimate is that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are about 95 % less harmful than smoking &quot; &quot; on a detailed review of evidence and modelling . &quot;
&quot; in fact , this statement comes from a single session of 12 persons conven@@ ed to develop a model for multiple criteria decision analysis ( Multi @-@ C@@ rit@@ eria Decision Analysis - MC@@ DA ) to lead their opinions on the damage of various ni@@ cot@@ ine @-@ containing products to a synthesis ; the results of the meeting were summar@@ ized in a research report . &quot;
&quot; Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that a sponsor of the meeting was a company called Euro@@ Swiss Health , whose managing director was previously named by British American Tob@@ acco Fund ( BA@@ T ) for an independent study . &quot;
&quot; he also under@@ wrote the references of BA@@ T to public health in a sustainability report , they said . &quot;
&quot; one of the 12 participants at the meeting explained to receive funds from an e @-@ cigar@@ ettes manufacturer , but not the financing which he report@@ edly received from tobacco company Philip Morris International , added them . &quot;
&quot; the reasons for choosing the members of the Gre@@ mi@@ ums are not delivered , but they include several well @-@ known e @-@ cigar@@ ettes , some of which include a sector financing in paper . &quot;
some other participants at this meeting are not known for their know @-@ how in tobacco control .
&quot; at the meeting , the tobacco line of P@@ he took part . &quot;
&quot; the research work of the group &quot; conf@@ esses &quot; that there is a lack of &quot; hard evidence for the damage of most products in most criteria , &quot; &quot; wrote Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well . &quot;
&quot; however , none of these links or restrictions will be discussed in the P@@ he report . &quot;
&quot; Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that &quot; &quot; there is no evidence that &quot; &quot; there have been no evidence that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes have been served as a way to smoking for children or non @-@ smo@@ kers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Kevin F@@ ent@@ on , Director of Health and Well @-@ being at P@@ he said that the claims of BM@@ J had already been re@@ acted before . &quot;
he said : &quot; e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are much less harmful than smoking . &quot;
every second life @-@ long smo@@ ker dies at his ad@@ diction .
&quot; all evidence suggests that the health risks of e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are low compared to that , but that we continue to study long @-@ term effects . &quot;
&quot; he has the clear duty to inform the public about what evidence proves and what is not , especially when there is so much public confusion about relative dangers in comparison to tobacco . &quot;
&quot; nearly 8@@ 0,000 people annually die in a disease with regard to smoking , and smoking costs the National Health System two billion pounds per year . &quot;
&quot; due to the clear presentation of current evidence that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are not without risk , but only a fraction of the damage caused by smoking , we comply with our national jurisdiction . &quot;
&quot; BBC should give up East@@ enders , says former Chief of Channel 4 &quot;
&quot; the former chair of Channel 4 , Luke Johnson , said that the BBC should stop sending programs like East@@ enders and The Voice . he said that commercial ri@@ vals would give their right arm &quot; for hit shows like Albert Square So@@ ap . &quot;
Johnson said that the broadcasting fee should only be used to make the type of programs that are not sent by other UK channels .
&quot; he critici@@ zed the BBC for making public legal programs , which are likely to be seen by a smaller audience , in hard controversial time frame against the most popular shows of their ri@@ vals and from transm@@ it@@ ters such as BB@@ C4 . &quot;
&quot; after the BBC general director , Tony Hall , said that the company wanted to do more in partnership with other organizations , Johnson said that he tried to get in touch with the BBC for six years in his time at Channel 4 . &quot;
&quot; I have problems with the idea that BBC programs are commissioned or sent , which would also be clearly shown by un@@ subsidi@@ zed ri@@ vals , &quot; said Johnson to the Ober@@ haus Communications Committee as part of his investigation on the future of BBC . &quot;
&quot; if you want to keep the broadcasting fee , what I don &apos;t think in the medium or long term for a good idea , one should at least give its production to programs that do not do it or put it on behalf . &quot;
&quot; they send The Voice in a first @-@ class time window , because they want to achieve the wid@@ est possible support for their future . &quot;
&quot; the idea that nobody else would show this is a joke , it &apos;s ridi@@ culous , it is non@@ sense . &quot;
&quot; Johnson said : &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t see why a reg@@ res@@ sive tax is financed , which could also be financed without subsidies . &quot;
&quot; the Voice is such a program , East@@ enders is another , ad@@ mitt@@ edly both its own productions . &quot;
&quot; hon@@ estly , other channels would give their right arm to it . &quot;
I would like to see how this is supposed to be public television .
I don &apos;t think this would reduce the BBC ever .
&quot; Johnson , an entrepren@@ eur for series , conducted channel 4 from 2004 to 2010 , said the BBC was to blame for reviews &quot; because of the ambi@@ tions of people who work there and because they believe that this is the best way to secure long @-@ term support . &quot;
&quot; his comments on the most popular broad@@ casts of the BBC show what the former head of Sky , Tony Ball , in his Mac@@ Tag@@ gart Talk in Edinburgh in 2003 proposed that BBC shows like East@@ enders should sell . &quot;
&quot; Johnson said that the rather public @-@ legal N@@ ic programs should go to BB@@ C4 , where one can &apos;t measure the audience , but they can argue , if they are going on their apparent missions for justi@@ fication of 4 billion £ circular radio fees , &quot; &quot; Well , of course , we have created all these obsc@@ ure programs that no one has seen . &quot;
they put them in a time frame in which nobody ever wanted to see them .
Johnson said to the committee : &quot; I urge you to find a more reg@@ res@@ sive system in terms of conditions who can get the best value from this .
&quot; of course , you all think that you get a great value for $ 150 per year , but for people who are a lot of money for the 150 £ a lot , ask me if that &apos;s right , because they consume not much from the BBC . &quot;
&quot; the former Sky@@ - and Channel 5 boss David El@@ stein , who also said before the committee on Tuesday , demanded that the BBC should check their Rei@@ th@@ ian mission , &quot; to educ@@ ate and maintain . &quot;
&quot; he said , little of BBC &apos;s production would now officially be classified as education - he said that it was 1 % of its TV production and 0.1 % on the radio - and it should take an example on public broad@@ cast@@ ers in Australia and Canada . &quot;
&quot; the question of partnerships said El@@ stein , the BBC should do more in areas like those of the Pro@@ ms , of which he said that only a handful of television will be shown , and with the commercial broadcasting alli@@ ances to make everything available online . &quot;
&apos;@@ Son@@ o@@ gene@@ tics &apos; can control brain cells through sound waves
the video shows how the nem@@ ato@@ des change the direction in the moment they are be@@ amed with sound impulses .
scientists have bred wor@@ ms with gene@@ tically modified nervous systems that can be controlled by break@@ through@@ s of sound waves .
&quot; the tiny nem@@ ato@@ des change the direction in the moment when it reson@@ ates with sound impulses , which have too high frequencies for human ear to be heard . &quot;
pul@@ ses work by switching from Mot@@ on@@ eur@@ one cells that are gene@@ tically modified to carry the membrane channels that respond to ultr@@ asonic waves .
more about this topic : reading researchers and write brain activity with light
&quot; the researchers said that wor@@ ms showed the power of a new method called Son@@ o@@ gene@@ tics , where ultras@@ ound can be used to activate a range of brain , heart and muscle cells outside the body . &quot;
&quot; Sre@@ ek@@ an@@ th Chal@@ as@@ ani , researcher at the Sal@@ k Institute in La J@@ olla , California , told the Guardian that the procedure of one day could replace the depths of brain stimulation , an invasive procedure that gives electric impulses to the brain of people to treat the symptoms of Parkinson &apos;s disease . &quot;
&quot; thread wor@@ ms usually do not react to ultras@@ ound , but Chal@@ as@@ ani noted that they did it when they were surrounded by a liquid with micro@@ sc@@ opic bub@@ bles . &quot;
&quot; the bub@@ bles , he found out , rein@@ force the ultr@@ asonic waves , which penet@@ rate into the wor@@ ms . &quot;
the reinforced ultras@@ ound waves act on structures called TR@@ P @-@ 4 ion@@ ary channels and found in the membran@@ es of some of the worm cells .
&quot; the sound waves cause the opening of these ion channels , activ@@ ating the cells they are assigned to , such as a report Nature Communications . &quot;
&quot; to create ultr@@ asonic @-@ controlled nem@@ ato@@ des , Chal@@ as@@ ani gene@@ tically modified the wor@@ ms that some of their Mot@@ on@@ eur@@ one TR@@ P @-@ 4 @-@ ion channels carry . &quot;
&quot; when ultras@@ ound is applied to the modified creatures , the sound waves are ampli@@ fied by the micro@@ b@@ lows and transferred to the wor@@ ms , where they turn on the modified Mot@@ on@@ eur@@ ons . &quot;
&quot; the procedure has some simil@@ arities with Op@@ to@@ gene@@ tics , a ground @-@ breaking tool that enables scientists to switch on and off neur@@ ons with impulses of light . &quot;
but Chal@@ as@@ ani said that Son@@ o@@ gene@@ tics could have some advantages over this technique .
&quot; in contrast to light , which must be sent down to the desired position in the brain , low frequency ultr@@ asonic waves can happen un@@ hin@@ dered and can thus be sent to the brain from the top of the skull . &quot;
&quot; we believe that with gene therapy and a therapeutic virus it is possible to make the targeted human neur@@ ons temporarily vulnerable to the ultras@@ ound signal in a clinical setting for certain neurolog@@ ical treatments , &quot; &quot; said Chal@@ as@@ ani . &quot;
&quot; other applications could concentrate on muscle cells and insulin @-@ producing cells , he added . &quot;

&quot; V@@ C@@ CP Creative Director Matt L@@ ever was amazed at the silence that ruled around the advertising for the arms trade fair - through a lie@@ uten@@ ant of the Ex@@ Ce@@ L calendar - and thought , &quot; &quot; We give them the campaign they try to avoid . &quot;

eight golden rules for living in student residen@@ ces
&quot; eleven years ago I moved to a student residence as a self @-@ forgotten 19 @-@ year @-@ old , still in faith in Ber@@ ets and moral rel@@ ati@@ vis@@ m , but only now I remember the ten@@ se sm@@ iles of those whom I have been angry - and to the numerous , long @-@ leg@@ ged complaints about others . &quot;
most of the things I have learned can be distill@@ ed in eight simple rules .
the entrance into student residen@@ ces ranges from slightly nerve wre@@ cking to absolutely horri@@ fying .
&quot; it is temp@@ ting to tie : people tell where you come from where and where you have taken the Sabbath year , where you are standing with regard to Cor@@ by@@ n and why you &quot; hon@@ estly Mar@@ m@@ ite neither love nor hate because in earn@@ est , guys , it &apos;s just a yeast extract ha@@ ha@@ ha , I am in my room . &quot;
breathe through .
and help others to do the same - ask questions and show interest .
&quot; it distrac@@ ts the conversation and helps you to find out the people you like in contrast to those with whom you would not speak , even if your lashes were on fire and these fire extingu@@ ish@@ ers would be . &quot;
let people .
&quot; the rooms of people often turn into drinks reception , film night venues and communal meeting points , but they are also the places where people are dressed and their under@@ wear . &quot;
referring to this : don &apos;t remember to start the university with a relationship
intro@@ vert will receive a rough treatment at the university .
&quot; their room should be a refuge , but many student residen@@ ces form a space @-@ to @-@ space bum@@ ble culture that is friendly and socially and can lead to life @-@ long friendship . &quot;
this can be hell for someone who tries to recover .
&quot; nothing in culture allows you to say , &quot; &quot; I like you and I want our friendship to go on , but you have to go away so that I have consumed the energy I have consumed for interaction with you . &quot;
try to feel when a comb@@ at@@ ant of convi@@ vi@@ ality is exhausted - and send it an SMS instead of kno@@ cking .
apro@@ pos cli@@ pping : do it .
a guy in my student residen@@ ces had the idea that an un@@ locked door was an invitation .
he saw some things .
close friendship through baking .
&quot; as you start the Uni at the peak of back @-@ Man@@ ia , the kno@@ ck on the doors of people to imagine with a plate full of brow@@ ni@@ es , less strange than the welcome of the 1950 @-@ er years &quot; welcome in the neighborhood , I have something baked . so , and now please smile when I ask you a few personal questions . &quot;
offering homemade goo@@ dies is a good way to close friend@@ ships .
your room@@ mates feel oblig@@ ated to enter@@ tain yourself and will eventually associate your face with a delicious surprise .
&quot; of course , this depends on whether you are a decent b@@ aker . &quot;
&quot; poor@@ ly mixed cl@@ ump of flour , sugar and fat lead to people sleeping when you pick up . &quot;
ste@@ aling food is a common crime in student residen@@ ces .
&quot; of course , the cla@@ ws of chick@@ ens is a theft , but is it taking a drop of milk for your tea ? &quot;
check this with the dairy owner .
&quot; chances are good that they say to use themselves , even if they cook in the interior . &quot;
&quot; if someone ste@@ als your stuff , it is anno@@ ying and you have my compassion - but try to deal more balanced as my ro@@ ommate , who added a pur@@ ge to her milk to pun@@ ish thi@@ eves . &quot;
she is now in prison .
they should not make noise that keeps people from sleep or from work .
&quot; it is not just about being a decent person , but that you are in the tru@@ est sense of the pro@@ verb to the people sitting in the glass house . &quot;
&quot; a girl on my cor@@ ridor asked her neighbors , whether it makes them a bit more quiet , because it &apos;s three o &apos;clock in the morning and she had a test in the morning . &quot;
they responded with even more lou@@ der music .
&quot; when she finally stopped at 5 o &apos;clock , she kindly allowed her neighbors to sleep for two hours before she left her own music , shut down her door and went to her three @-@ hour test . &quot;
wouldn &apos;t it be romantic if your future spouse would acci@@ dentally move into the same student residence ?
&quot; on the other hand , it would not be aw@@ k@@ ward embarrass@@ ing if you hold a ro@@ ommate for your future spouse to join them again and see them every day and perhaps experience how to move all their friends together ? &quot;
&quot; of course , the heart walks its own ways - but if a hot ro@@ ommate is definitely not your future spouse , try at least to talk to your abdom@@ en a little reason . &quot;
&quot; in the exciting moment you notice that someone has his keys in his un@@ locked room , the boundary between a Ul@@ k and M@@ ob@@ bing is fine when it seems . &quot;
&quot; a good mare is funny , but it only takes moments until he becomes a bo@@ omer@@ ang . &quot;
&quot; through hiding a precious and am@@ using lesson on safety , but never disc@@ ern someone &apos;s room with to@@ oth@@ paste and sh@@ ampoo . &quot;
&quot; close your door , and put your keys into a glass of water which you put into the freezer - but do not t@@ ack their pos@@ sessions at the ceiling any more than twice . &quot;
&quot; town@@ houses for Refu@@ ge@@ es , Solo@@ ists , Ger@@ ing@@ ver@@ dien@@ er &quot;
the real estate entrepren@@ eur Markus Gil@@ dner is building in the Central Fran@@ con@@ ian Eck@@ ental town@@ houses for people who do not have much money .
&quot; so for refugees - but also as a signal : &quot; not only refugees need living space , but also the only educ@@ ating mother and the poor . &quot;
&quot; I am showing how to get cheap and good today , &quot; says the 44 @-@ year @-@ old in the interview &quot;
thousands of refugees are displac@@ ed in the housing market .
entrepren@@ eur Markus Gil@@ dner believes to know how quickly cheaper living space can be created : he builds up town@@ houses for refugees in a project .
&quot; Mr. Gil@@ den , many refugees will be pushing for the housing market . &quot;
which solution do you offer ?
Markus Gil@@ dner : the mass accommodation in containers or gy@@ ms does not have any sustainability .
for people stay in a large part here .
&quot; in view of the flow of refugees , we also need sufficient living space in the coming decades . &quot;
&quot; a very ban@@ al , three @-@ storey ter@@ raced house is the solution . &quot;
Gil@@ den : a Sem@@ i @-@ Sem@@ i @-@ Sem@@ i @-@ detached house needs least space .
it facilitates integration .
this is different if one puts people in blocks of residence .
&quot; each of the six houses built in the pilot project consists of three housing units , each for four asylum seek@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; each unit has two bedrooms , a bathroom , a kitchen and a common room . &quot;
&quot; it can be that many refugees will say it &apos;s peace again , I go back . &quot;
then the houses can be easily converted to the specific needs .
how high are the costs ?
&quot; Gil@@ den : the price for 160 square meters of living space per house is worth 184 000 euros , without land . &quot;
this is man@@ age@@ able .

iOS 9 : how to get the new iPhone operating system when Apple Update is released
&quot; the new operating system can be requested by going to &quot; &quot; General &quot; &quot; and then select &quot; &quot; Software Update . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; if it is ready , the phone will give you the option to download and then install . &quot;
&quot; some are encountered after installation , as they get an error message indicating that the &quot; &quot; Software update failed &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; to handle the problem , users are advised to either wait until the rush goes back or try to update via iTunes . &quot;
the phone itself guides you through the rest of the process .
&quot; this may mean the del@@ e@@ tion of apps to create space - but Apple has made it more likely due to the deteri@@ oration of updates . likewise , it will be easier to do this if you use a special tool to delete apps and then re@@ install it as soon as the process is completed . &quot;
&quot; it is worth to ensure that your mobile phone is charged during the update or is located near a charger , so that the battery is charged . &quot;
&quot; if the load is too low , Apple doesn &apos;t allow the update to be continued since the phone might be switched on half way and this could lead to a break @-@ off of the update . &quot;

district office is looking for direct contact
Sal@@ u@@ dis and the Alten@@ zentrum Anton@@ isti@@ ft have merged under the casing of the Sozial@@ stiftung and opened a new office at Graf @-@ St@@ auff@@ enberg @-@ Platz .
&quot; besides consult@@ ations , one can also participate in courses . &quot;
the social foundation draws it down from the mountain into the city centre .
more precisely to the Graf @-@ St@@ auff@@ enberg square .
a new district office was recently opened there .
&quot; here , directly next to the shopping market , from now on , sen@@ iors and ad@@ vices get information on questions such as health insurance or services of health insurance companies . &quot;
&quot; for years , we have been working with our ambul@@ ant care service that often caring relatives are left alone . &quot;
there are endless many questions .
&quot; the new land@@ lords Jutta Wei@@ g@@ and , who as Head of Alten@@ Hilfe für das Anton@@ eu@@ ft and the Bürger@@ sp@@ ital , as well as for the out@@ patient service &quot; Amadeus &quot; are also responsible . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the consult@@ ations , the new district office also offers prevention , health courses and wellness . &quot;
&quot; for this purpose , the Sal@@ u@@ dis was taken into the boat . &quot;
&quot; therefore , you can use additional offers such as assault prevention , memory training or physi@@ otherapy treatment . &quot;
the offers of the Senior Centre and Sal@@ u@@ dis complement each other in an ideal way .
&quot; Sal@@ u@@ dis stands for prevention , prevention and rehabilitation . &quot;
&quot; the Senior Centre for Care and Care , &quot; described Heike R@@ ie@@ del , Managing Director of Sal@@ u@@ dis . &quot;
&quot; as a result of the opening of the new district office in the city center , both directors see particularly in demographic change . &quot;
&quot; for this , a good de@@ centralized infrastructure in the individual districts of Bam@@ berg is essential in the future . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Mayor Wolfgang Metz@@ ner ( SPD ) under@@ lined the inaugur@@ ation ceremony , the district office also devoted himself to the club meeting at the age : &quot; there are numerous events and offers on the programme and these invite to a regular soci@@ able supplement . &quot;
&quot; thus , the Sozial@@ stiftung makes a big contribution that sen@@ iors can live independently and well in their familiar environment . &quot;
&quot; the district office is open Monday , Wednesday and Friday from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m. , Tuesday and Thursday from 4 p.m. to 6 p.m. and Satur@@ days from 10 am to 12 pm . &quot;

men tested on 17 @-@ year @-@ old Afgh@@ ans
&quot; witnesses are looking for the police for a incident in Bad So@@ den @-@ Sal@@ mün@@ ster : on Friday evening , at 23.@@ 45 o &apos;clock , three young men were walking from Bad So@@ den towards Sal@@ mün@@ ster . &quot;
&quot; one out of the group , a 17 year old Afgh@@ an , followed his two friends at a distance of about five meters and called them to wait for him . &quot;
at that point the group was at the height of the b@@ ft gas station .
there are also three persons on the premises of the gas station .
&quot; one of these men now cried out to the young , and struck the face with the f@@ ist . &quot;
the victim suffered a nas@@ al break and ble@@ ed strongly out of the nose .
&quot; when his two friends made ha@@ ste and appe@@ aled to the bat , he initially dismis@@ sed his victim . &quot;
&quot; from his friends , the injured young man was now brought home . &quot;
the perpetr@@ ator persec@@ uted the group with a passenger car up to their apartment and drove there demonstr@@ atively several times .
&quot; when you no longer saw the vehicle , the last one went in front of the building to smoke a cigar@@ ette . &quot;
&quot; there , he was again attacked by the bat and another male . &quot;
&quot; with the help of a stroke , one checked on the face and the thi@@ ghs of the victim . &quot;
the injured must be brought to hospital for medical care .
&quot; up to now , there is only a vag@@ ue issue description . &quot;
one of the men was about 1.80 meters in size .
the second bat should have been about 1.@@ 65 metres tall and was dressed with a jeans and a brown @-@ white shirt .

Dr. Frank Müller takes over practice field breaks and inv@@ ests 3@@ 10000 Euro
Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l and Frank Müller ( from left ) take over the practice of Karl @-@ Heinrich and Ur@@ sel Fel@@ steh@@ ausen .
&quot; furthermore , the mayor Bernd Bor@@ mann , economic development in U@@ ta Sei@@ m @-@ Schw@@ art@@ z and A@@ sen@@ dor@@ fs mayor Hein@@ fried Kab@@ bert are also pleased . &quot;
&quot; in many places in the country , doctors - A@@ sen@@ dorf , on the other hand , are lucky : Dr. Frank Müller took over the practice of Fel@@ steh@@ ausen on October 1 . &quot;
&quot; while Ur@@ sel Fel@@ steh@@ ausen is reti@@ ring , her husband Karl @-@ Heinrich is still standing at half a point in his successor in the next few months . &quot;
&quot; after a reconstruction phase , Müller opens the practice on October 12 , until then he inv@@ ests 3@@ 10000 Euro to the premises at St@@ .-@@ Mar@@ cell@@ us@@ straße 6 . &quot;
&quot; it was sympathy at first sight , when the fields of the field came to know Frank Müller and his wife Dr. Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l , who currently under@@ took their medical training in the Ver@@ den Hospital and also wants to get into practice . &quot;
&quot; we always had in mind that the gar@@ bage would fit well into this practice , &quot; says Dr. Ur@@ sel Fel@@ steh@@ ausen and laugh@@ s . &quot;
&quot; when it was so far , I just called it . &quot;
&quot; the couple Müller liked the idea , in future in A@@ sen@@ dorf to operate their own practice . &quot;
&quot; the proximity and constant contact to the patients are very attractive to us , &quot; says the 39 @-@ year old m@@ iller . &quot;
&quot; we want to meet and accompany the families over the years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; as an advantage , he also see his own boss soon . &quot;
and so it was agreed that the gar@@ bage cans bought the house with practice .
they will continue to live in Bruch@@ hausen @-@ Vil@@ sen .
&quot; the double family father Frank Müller also grew up there , his medical facility in Hanover followed stations in several medical offices and in the hospitals in Sul@@ ingen , Ni@@ enburg and Rot@@ enburg . &quot;
&quot; at present , he is active as a senior physician in Sul@@ ingen , in 2009 he was appointed a leading emergency physician in the Di@@ ep@@ holz district and is involved in the DR@@ K willingness of Bruch@@ hausen @-@ Vil@@ sen . &quot;
&quot; from September 19 , the practice for the new boss will be prepared . &quot;
&quot; while the surgeon Dr. Karl @-@ Heinrich Fel@@ steh@@ ausen works as a general practitioner , his wife Ur@@ sel ( Intern@@ ist ) speci@@ alis@@ es in the g@@ astro@@ enter@@ ology . &quot;
&quot; the gar@@ bage , both inter@@ ne@@ sts , want to settle down as a general practitioner . &quot;
&quot; the end@@ os@@ copy comes out , &quot; says the 38 @-@ year @-@ old Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l . &quot;
&quot; after re@@ modeling , the rooms will look more modern . &quot;
we will offer more ultras@@ ound examinations as well as long @-@ term and endurance EK@@ G and need a speaking room more .
&quot; in addition , the ED@@ V is completely renewed . &quot;
&quot; as part of a funding programme from the District Circle ( 25@@ 000 Euro ) and the municipality ( 12@@ 500 Euro ) and the municipality ( 12@@ 500 Euro ) , the gar@@ bage can receive a grant of 500@@ 00 Euros . &quot;
&quot; this shows how proud and happy we are , that practice continues , &quot; says Bernd Bor@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; according to Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l , about 2000 patients come to the field of Fel@@ ir@@ inal surgery every quarter , in the North German average practice , it is about 500 . &quot;
there is another doctor &apos;s practice in A@@ sen@@ dorf .
a positive side effect of the practice by Frank Müller : the pharmacy remains according to Ur@@ sel Fel@@ steh@@ ausen in A@@ sen@@ dorf .
&quot; if no successor has been found , it would have gone . &quot;
&quot; by the way , who visits Müll@@ ers &apos;s consultation hour , also looks particularly in familiar faces : taking over the seven medical professionals and the cleaning power from the fields of the field . &quot;
&quot; with their f@@ arewell end in A@@ sen@@ dorf an era , after all , the medical doctors have practiced for 30 years . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning we had only two rooms , &quot; Ur@@ sel Fel@@ steh@@ ausen re@@ members . &quot;
a little melanchol@@ y already sen@@ sed them after the long time already .
&quot; but we continue to live in Hohen@@ mo@@ or and will see many patients still often , &quot; &quot; says the dor@@ mit@@ ory . &quot;
&quot; her husband has a laugh : &quot; &quot; we have a 6000 square meter plot . &quot;
&quot; so far I have always pressed me on gardening , now it could be different . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the pair has two grand@@ children and travels to travel . &quot;
Croatia : &quot; we leave refugees by &quot;
&quot; now the border controls are also high on our southern border , &quot; &quot; said Minister Johanna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner . &quot;
the controls on the Hungarian border remain parallel to this .
&quot; still , it is clear that anyone who wants to ask for asylum has to do so . &quot;
the care and safety of people are in the foreg@@ round .
&quot; but it is clear , however , that it needs clear signals , &quot; &quot; said the Minister . &quot;
&quot; people must know that we do not accept limit@@ less migration flows , nor the Austrian @-@ Sloven@@ ian border . &quot;
it needs a controlled approach .
Croatia is considering &quot; Cor@@ ridor &quot; - Slovenia denied
&quot; the Croatian government had previously communicated , also Slovenia wanted to leave incoming refugees in the direction of Austria and Germany and under certain circumstances establish cor@@ rid@@ ors for the refugees . &quot;
&quot; the Interior Minister Ves@@ na Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar in Lai@@ bach , however , did not see this . &quot;
&quot; the idea of cor@@ rid@@ ors is &quot; absolutely un@@ acceptable , &quot; Slovenia is rather the monitoring of the border - especially to Hungary - intensi@@ fy . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , the border with Croatia is already heavily controlled as the outside border of the Schengen area . &quot;
&quot; as the Minister stressed , Slovenia wants to un@@ lock its limits for refugees . &quot;
&quot; each EU member must fill out its commitments , otherwise the system cannot function , &quot; said Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar . &quot;
&quot; as the Croatian government announced , the first refugees had already tried to leave the border crossing of T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik / Si@@ d in eastern Croatia at the border crossing of T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik / Si@@ d to ev@@ ade the registration . &quot;
the Croatian police could pick them up in the nearby corn fields .
&quot; according to local media , in the Croatian T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik , police vehicles are constantly meeting new refugees . &quot;
&quot; it is mainly about Syri@@ ans and Afgh@@ ans , including numerous women and children . &quot;
rescue services and the Red Cross are already in use .
&quot; in the days ahead , his country expects about 4000 refugees , Minister R@@ ank@@ o O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic . &quot;
&quot; moreover , buses from Pres@@ evo to the Mac@@ ed@@ onian @-@ Serbian border , which so far had brought migrants to the Hungarian fron@@ tier , diver@@ ted Croatian and Serbian media on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; the government in Belgrade , however , denied that it was it that people approach certain routes : &quot; neither can we , nor do we want to do it , &quot; it was said . &quot;
&quot; according to the media reports , in the morning a first bus with some 50 refugees arrived in the Serbian border town of Si@@ d , in the course of the day further buses would be expected . &quot;
&quot; about Croatia , Slovenia and Austria to Germany &quot;
&quot; the occup@@ ants were all night away from the Mac@@ ed@@ onian border , around 500 kilometres away from Serbia . &quot;
&quot; we heard that Hungary did , so the police said that we should drive here , &quot; &quot; said one of the refugees . &quot;
&quot; they wanted to travel to Germany through Croatia , Slovenia and Austria . &quot;
&quot; this could indeed lead to a somewhat further west @-@ west route , already predicted by ob@@ servers of the previous Balkan route Turkey @-@ Greece @-@ Macedonia @-@ Serbia @-@ Hungary . &quot;
Croatia : &quot; comprehensive options for border control &quot;
Croatia &apos;s interior minister O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic had previously stressed that his country prepared for the case of a strong influ@@ x of refugees prepared plans for possible exceptions .
&quot; he did not call him , but he pointed out that Croatia was a non @-@ Schengen member &quot; comprehensive options for border control . &quot; &quot;
carry out strict controls to qualify for membership in the Schengen area .
&quot; since 2007 , Slovenia has been part of this since 2007 . since then , the EU partners have consistently witnessed a good testimony to the standards of border controls . &quot;
&quot; on the Serbian side , there are still about 300 refugees behind the Hungarian border fence . &quot;
&quot; according to Belgrade media reports , they had spent the past night at the border crossing Hor@@ gos , who leads to R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke . &quot;
&quot; according to the Hungarian authorities , the two border cross@@ ings Hor@@ gos and Back@@ i Bre@@ g remain completely blocked . &quot;
&quot; if the remaining refugees are now going to go on to the Croatian border , it is still un@@ clear . &quot;
the Serbian Interior Minister N@@ ebo@@ j@@ sa Stef@@ an@@ ovic still tried to calm Wednesday at a local eye in Hor@@ gos : he kept the debates on alternative routes of refugees after the Hungarian border is now closed for premature .
it would not currently deal with very high refugee figures .
&quot; they could not say whether they would continue their journey through Hungary , Croatia or another country . &quot;
volunteers advise migrants - dangerous - alternative routes
&quot; however , private Hungarian refugee shel@@ ters have already begun distribut@@ ing maps on which alternative routes are marked by Croatia . &quot;
&quot; however , the border crossing between Serbia and Croatia is not dangerous : in parts of the border area there are also 20 years after the end of the Croatian border still un@@ cleared min@@ e@@ fields . &quot;
&quot; on Wednesday afternoon , the Croatian police announced that a team of mine clearance was sent to the border region . &quot;

&quot; with the information carried out , insi@@ der transactions should be made on the financial markets . &quot;
&quot; in this way , the investig@@ ators were considered a total of more than $ 100 million . &quot;
&quot; today &apos;s comparison shows that even those outside our borders are ultimately captured , &quot; says the SE@@ C communication . &quot;
the trial against 32 further accused in the case lasted .
most of the accused came from Ukraine and Georgia .

&quot; with this action , the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce aid brought attention to its 20 @-@ year anniversary and is quite confronted with mixed reactions . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s about life , so we went with the action in the middle of the city and among the people , &quot; says Jos@@ ef@@ ine Lam@@ mer . &quot;
the Head of E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical Hos@@ pi@@ z@@ aid is available to the pass@@ ers as well as questions and talks as well as hon@@ orary members .
&quot; while some pass@@ ers spontane@@ ously interv@@ ene to chal@@ k and read the phrase &quot; &quot; my life &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; stop &quot; &quot; with the camper through the USA , &quot; &quot; stop the war &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; not long suffer &quot; , &quot; others remain short , read , say phrases as &quot; &quot; so far I am not yet &quot; &quot; and then go on . &quot;
&quot; over and over again , small discussions about the action are developing over life , dealing with dying . &quot;
Peter H@@ üb@@ inger is also on site .

&quot; therefore , this public @-@ effective action for 20 @-@ year @-@ old is good . &quot;
&quot; the fact that not everyone wants to publicly disclose himself on the tablets , however , is understandable , after all , it is a very personal thing . &quot;

&quot; Fed@@ Ex result , mixed , financial outlook for 2016 &quot;
&quot; Fed@@ Ex reports dis@@ ap@@ pointing results for the last quarter , and the supplier Gig@@ ant lowered his earnings outlook for a whole year due to the weaker demand for freight services and higher costs in his bo@@ d@@ land transport service . &quot;
&quot; the company also said that it plans to hire about 55@@ ,000 seasonal workers for holidays . &quot;
&quot; at that time last year , Fed@@ Ex announced that the company wants to set 50,000 seasonal workers for the holiday season . &quot;
the share fell by 2.5 percent in the market trading 45 minutes before the opening on Wednesday .
&quot; Fed@@ Ex Corp. said to earn a profit of 10.@@ 40 $ and 10,@@ 90 $ in the financial year that ends in May , 20 c@@ ents less than in previous forecast . &quot;
analysts expected a survey of Fac@@ t@@ Set 10.@@ 84 $ .
&quot; the lower view comes despite the price increases , which amount to 4.@@ 9 percent and will be effective on 4 January and despite higher supplements for bo@@ d@@ ging of heavy and large packages , which will be collected from November . &quot;
&quot; the company said it was nevertheless expected that the result compared to the previous year due to cost reduction , higher earnings and due to growth in online trading will increase . &quot;
&quot; Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said that the company provides solid income when considering the weaker economic conditions , especially in manufacturing and global trade . &quot;
&quot; the plans for the holiday employment were announced a day later than that of the Ri@@ val U@@ PS , which plans to set 90@@ ,000 to 95@@ 5,000 additional workers , for example the same number as last year . &quot;
&quot; in the quarter , which ended on August 31 , Fed@@ Ex received 6@@ 92 million dollars , 6 percent more than in the previous year . &quot;
&quot; earnings per share stood at 2.@@ 42 $ per share , just behind the 2.@@ 44 $ per share , the twelve analysts predicted by Z@@ acks Investment Research . &quot;
sales rose by 5 percent to 12.@@ 3 billion $ .
six of Z@@ acks asked analysts expected 12.@@ 23 billion $ .
&quot; in recent years , Fed@@ Ex has reported a decline in international priority shipping , which brought sales in its unit express shipment to the star@@ ring . &quot;
but the boom in online shopping increased the results at Fed@@ Ex Ground .
&quot; in the last quarter , sales in bo@@ d@@ land transport increased by 29 percent , but the operating result was basically flat because of higher costs for larger packages and self @-@ insurance . &quot;
&quot; the express unit recorded higher revenue , due to higher prices , while the result dropped due to higher labour costs in the freight business . &quot;
&quot; pre @-@ market trading , about an hour before opening , the Fed@@ Ex shares fell by 3.@@ 85 $ , or 2.5 percent , to 15@@ 0,15 $ . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , they closed with 11 percent loss for the year and 17 percent below a record high on June 11 . &quot;
&quot; on their most expected conference in the year , Federal Reserve strateg@@ ists spend two days this week around a 27 @-@ foot Hondur@@ an ma@@ ho@@ gan@@ y table to decide whether it &apos;s time for the first time to lift the Lei@@ tz@@ ins for the first time . &quot;
&quot; dro@@ oping over them at an end of the decorated , two @-@ story session hall is a wall picture of the United States . &quot;
the map is a reminder that the president Jan@@ et L. Y@@ ellen and her colleagues should put the economic interests of the nation before all other things .
the central bank has a two @-@ fold order from Congress : maxim@@ izing the US employment and prices here stable .
&quot; but since the great recession , the F@@ ed leaders have acknowledged that there is an un@@ written third mandate : financial stability . &quot;
&quot; and this third mandate could be the X @-@ factor in a decision that is too tight to pre@@ dict it . it will be announced on Thursday , whether the US economy is ready to be we@@ an@@ ed by the unprecedented incentive by the close to zero current interest rate since the end of 2008 . &quot;
&quot; although most of the data of the economy show that it grows solid , recent turbul@@ ence in the global financial markets might be anxi@@ ous to strengthen this volati@@ lity by raising the interest rate for federal bonds - and be it just a quarter percentage point . &quot;
&quot; obviously , the labour market and inflation are primarily the most important thing they are watching , &quot; said Lind@@ sey M. Pi@@ eg@@ za , chief econom@@ ist at the bro@@ ker company Sti@@ fel Nicol@@ aus &amp; Co . &quot;
&quot; but I think if they were looking for a pre@@ text to not increase the interest rate , the increased uncertainty around the global market is enough justi@@ fication to continue to wait , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; there is no consensus on what the F@@ ed is doing , which sec@@ ures itself to the financial market . &quot;
&quot; about half of the econom@@ ists , recently questioned by Blo@@ om@@ berg , have predicted an interest rate this week . &quot;
&quot; the financial markets , however , expect a waiting for the F@@ ed , with a key indicator which only shows a 30 % chance for an increase . &quot;
&quot; this indicates a decline in the stock market , if the F@@ ed increases the sentence unless the strateg@@ ists l@@ essen the blow by promising that another increase is far away . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , the Dow Jones Industrial A@@ verage was 2@@ 28,@@ 89 points or 1.4 % to 16.@@ 59@@ 9,@@ 85 . &quot;
&quot; the action was triggered by expectations that F@@ ed policy maintained the sentence this week , said John Lon@@ ski , chief econom@@ ist at Moo@@ dy &apos;s Capital Markets Research Group . &quot;
&quot; it would be a surprise if the F@@ ed would raise the sentences at that time , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; if she does it , she would have to go very far in her statement to calm the financial markets so that she should not panic . &quot;
&quot; other experts argued that an interest rate would calm the financial markets , because it would eliminate uncertainty about when the F@@ ed would act . &quot;
&quot; a month ago , the F@@ ed appeared in good ways to increase the set by 0.25 percentage points this month , the first small step in a slow intensi@@ fication of monetary conditions that would test the strength of recovery in the US . &quot;
&quot; Y@@ ellen had said in spring and early summer that this year , despite the complaints of liber@@ als , that more economic progress would be required to increase the sentence . &quot;
&quot; although the creation of jobs slow@@ ed in August , the improvement in the labour market was solid this year . &quot;
&quot; the unemployment rate dropped to 5.1 % last month , the lowest since more than seven years and close to the level which the F@@ ed sees as full employment . &quot;
wage increases have shown signs of recovery .
&quot; although inflation was steadily rising below the annual target of 2 % of the Central Bank , the F@@ ed representatives said that the main reason is the temporary impact of significantly lower oil prices . &quot;
&quot; the economy can handle higher interest rates and needs them because of the tension on the labour market , &quot; &quot; said Ian Sh@@ ep@@ her@@ dson , Chief econom@@ ist of Pan@@ the@@ on Macro@@ economics . &quot;
&quot; but the financial markets around the world were ch@@ oked at the end of last month , after China had utilized its currency . &quot;
&quot; in May , the Dow Jones Industrial A@@ verage was more than 16 % below its top level , as investors feared that a slow@@ down of the Chinese economy would cut global growth . &quot;
forecasts to 2019 illustrate how the market is set to change .
&quot; for the F@@ ed Represent@@ atives , market turbul@@ ences influence the complex calculation when to increase interest rates . &quot;
&quot; if the events on the financial markets and the news on the weakness of the Chinese economy have not occurred in the last few weeks , they would attract the re@@ ins in this meeting , &quot; said Stephen D. O@@ liner , Senior Research Fel@@ low at the U@@ C@@ LA Zim@@ an Center for Real Estate and a former employee of the US emergency tank . &quot;
now he pre@@ di@@ cts that she will wait at least one month to get the effects better .
&quot; there is a lot of uncertainty about what will be the impact on the U.S. economy , and there are almost no reliable data describing developments in China , &quot; said O@@ lin@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; the health of the world economy is none of the main concerns of the F@@ ed , so it should not be involved in technical decision @-@ making . &quot;
&quot; but in the end , the F@@ ed Monetary Authority has become the world . &quot;
the influence of the central bank has been enormous over the past few years .
&quot; the mere suggestion of the former leader Ben S. Bern@@ anke in 2013 , that the F@@ ed could narrow their monetary expansion , &quot; b@@ los@@ som@@ ing confusion around the globe . &quot;
&quot; in a world where markets and economies are increasingly inter@@ tw@@ ined , the F@@ ed representatives are expected to monitor not only developments elsewhere , but also consult with other central banks and experts to gain a better understanding of the global economy . &quot;
&quot; her decision @-@ making is &quot; more art than science , &quot; said Zach@@ ary Kar@@ ab@@ ell , Head of Global Strategy for the Asset Management of En@@ vest@@ net Inc . &quot;
&quot; Jeff@@ rey Lack@@ er , President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Rich@@ mond , VA . , noted this month that &quot; the F@@ ed has a history of transactions on financial market movements that apparently are not associated with the economic fundam@@ entals . &quot;
&quot; Lack@@ er , backed member of the Federal Open Market Committee , comm@@ itting an interest in interest , made decisions in the years 1998 / 1999 as an example . &quot;
&quot; a financial crisis in Asia brought the F@@ ed to lower its Lei@@ tz@@ ins by 0.@@ 75 percentage points in three sessions despite limiting percep@@ tible effects on growth in the US , &quot; &quot; said Lack@@ ner . &quot;
a year later the F@@ ed representatives with@@ drew these cuts .
&quot; the F@@ ed should put aspects of financial stability only during a serious crisis such as the 2008 market crisis , said Adam S. P@@ osen , former member of the Committee for the Inter@@ est Rate of Bank of England . &quot;
&quot; the recent tur@@ mo@@ il does not come near this level , he said . &quot;
&quot; she will certainly not fall into the situation in which she fears a interest in interest , because the markets are exciting , &quot; &quot; said Poz@@ nan , President of the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot;
&quot; the Federal Reserve Act still contains the double mandate and does not mention financial stability , and until that is changed , I don &apos;t think it should prec@@ ede the time . &quot;
do you need a great Thai market ?
try LA@@ X @-@ C in Chin@@ at@@ own .
&quot; yes , Chin@@ at@@ own &quot;
the market / warehouse was opened in 1997 and is owned by LA@@ X @-@ C Inc .
&quot; LA@@ X @-@ C is often referred to as Thai Co@@ st@@ co and is a Thai wholesale market , which is also sold to the general public . &quot;
&quot; yes , it is located in Chin@@ at@@ own and not in Thai Town . &quot;
&quot; the market / stock is a central contact point and offers a conf@@ using number of fresh , frozen and dried goods , popular Thai and Asian snacks , and c@@ rock@@ ery , furniture , religious jewelry and Christmas decorations . &quot;
there is even a car department if you need engine oil .
&quot; the shop is huge , and it takes over an hour to stroll through the walks . &quot;
&quot; if the whole purchasing process makes you hungry , there is a meal in the LA@@ X @-@ C BBQ Express for you . &quot;
the kitchen ( good and inexpensive ) in this shop is close to the c@@ asses and has various participation options .
what is there : do you need something - anything - Thai ?
LA@@ X @-@ C probably has it .
products are cheap and a number of them are sold in large quantities .
&quot; fresh products include Asian specialties and regional Thai herbs , fruits and much more . &quot;
&quot; the meat counter is extensive , as well as the fish bar - the staff behind the counter will clean and filter the fish and even fry on request for you . &quot;
&quot; a good part of the store is part of the massive freezer department . here you will find frozen cur@@ ry leaves , bitter mel@@ on and gal@@ gan@@ t , whole du@@ cks , fish , beef blu@@ t and g@@ all , pork , herr@@ ing fish , regional saus@@ age , commerci@@ ally prepared food and more . &quot;
&quot; who purchases here : restaurant owners and coo@@ ks , also individual families and individuals . &quot;
the wide gears are suitable for cart and for@@ kli@@ ft trucks .
you will find here : fresh Mon@@ th@@ ong Dur@@ ian besides the cas@@ hier .
where it is located : the store is located in an industrial area of Los Angeles on the edge of Chin@@ at@@ own and downtown - a few blocks away from Philippe The Original .
&quot; parking : LA@@ X @-@ C has its own parking area , along with other shops and restaurants . &quot;
&quot; even if the shop is well visited , it is not difficult to find a parking place . &quot;
Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da : small Leben@@ sh@@ ilfe for Refu@@ ge@@ es
more and more refugees are coming to Germany this day .
&quot; to prepare a warm welcome , do not go without the commitment of inn@@ um@@ erable volunteer hel@@ pers . &quot;
also in Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da there are a number of people who support un@@ sel@@ fish asylum seek@@ ers in the city .
among them are Petra and Klaus H@@ eine .
Petra H@@ eine is a teacher with body and soul .
&quot; with her 74 lessons , she is still teaching her . &quot;
every Thursday she does it in the asylum seek@@ er at the D@@ ill@@ inger street .
&quot; it helps refugees from Syria , Kur@@ dist@@ an , Kosovo and Pakistan to learn German language . &quot;
&quot; of course , this is quite different from the right school . &quot;
Brazil &apos;s Pap@@ al Society Rio Grande promotes healthy breast@@ feeding
&quot; the Brazilian pedi@@ atric organization Spr@@ S tries to elu@@ ci@@ date women in a sho@@ cking way , how important good nutrition during breast@@ feeding is . she does this with the presentation of pictures of babies who su@@ ck at breasts that are painted with depic@@ tions of un@@ healthy foods . &quot;
&quot; breast milk consists of a variety of proteins , fats , vitamins and carbohydrates that give babies all the nutrients they need to build a strong immune system . &quot;
&quot; due to the additional energy requirements , pregnant and young mothers are advised to increase their daily cal@@ orie intake by about 500 calories per day . &quot;
&quot; however , new research findings suggest that higher cal@@ orie intake is not the only dietary adjustment that mothers should undertake . &quot;
&quot; a recent study conducted by Robert Water@@ land , Professor at the Bay@@ lor College of Medicine in Texas , showed that a healthy diet actually affects women &apos;s genes and protects them from the development of tum@@ ours . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , an un@@ healthy diet of the child can adver@@ sely affect the immune system . &quot;
exceptions to the new Bern@@ rie@@ der Sp@@ orth@@ alle
the municipal council Bern@@ ried approved the building application for the 2.3 million euros expensive sports hall .
and he made an exception .
the roof must be flat for solar installation .
&quot; the planning for the long @-@ longed gy@@ h@@ room construction at the Bern@@ rie@@ der Sport@@ grounds will step by step by step : in the recent municipal meeting , the elabor@@ ated construction contract was unanim@@ ously approved without large discussions . &quot;
&quot; prior to that , the committee had already approved an application for a &quot; &quot; exception &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; exemp@@ tion &quot; &quot; exemp@@ tion from the valid development plan . &quot;
&quot; the exception &quot; &quot; was the permission for a special form regarding the roof construction . &quot;
&quot; accordingly , a &quot; saddle roof with a non @-@ m@@ illed first and roof over@@ board &quot; is to be erected . &quot;
&quot; the planning is the intended use of the roof surface for solar installations : &quot; this allows us to get a wonderfully large roof , &quot; said Mayor Josef St@@ eigen@@ berger at the meeting . &quot;
&quot; in the case of &quot; &quot; liberation &quot; , &quot; again , the roof inc@@ lin@@ ation , which for energetic reasons - was different from the development plan - should lie under ten degrees . &quot;
the volume of the hall is thus significantly reduced .
&quot; therefore , a &quot; liberation &quot; was necessary because the plan @-@ plan for the roof inc@@ lin@@ ation does not permit &quot; exceptions &quot; - with the Bern@@ rie@@ der Municipal Council generally rather restri@@ ctive when it comes to liber@@ ating orders . &quot;
&quot; however , the gy@@ ms are not a recur@@ ring project : &quot; we do not create a preced@@ ent , &quot; says St@@ eigen@@ berger . &quot;
the gym hall at the sports centre is a community project of the municipality and SV Bern@@ ried .
some 2.3 million euros are calculated at the cost .
subsidies are expected from school and long@@ itude transport .
&quot; in the next step , the building extension for the 18 x 36 meter large hall will now be submitted to the Council of Agriculture . &quot;
Klinik Pei@@ ßen@@ berg moves to Sch@@ ong@@ au
the Pei@@ ßen@@ berg hospital should be closed earlier than planned - namely 2016 .
&quot; at the same time , Dr. Wilhelm Fischer ( 66 ) is the new medical director at the Sch@@ ong@@ au hospital . &quot;
the station and the majority of staff move from Pei@@ ßen@@ berg to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
&quot; they see the surprising plans of the Hospital GmbH of the county , who confirmed the coun@@ cill@@ or Andrea J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß . &quot;
&quot; however , a decision about this is the Supervisory Board , and the next Wednesday , 23 September . &quot;
&quot; if plans are implemented , all of the nearly 50 employees would be employed at the hospital in Pei@@ ßen@@ berg . &quot;
the vast majority should move to Sch@@ ong@@ au with Fischer and the existing In@@ ner Station .
the rooms are available .
&quot; employees , who are not able to compete with Sch@@ ong@@ au , should be offered a job in Wei@@ l@@ heim , so J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß . &quot;
the staff are informed about the plans .
&quot; the change is initiated by Dr. Andreas E@@ der , who has been the medical director of Sch@@ ong@@ auer Clinic since the beginning of the year and is now transferred to a private practice in close proximity to the hospital . &quot;
&quot; according to J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß , the name &quot; Fischer &quot; came to the game , who agreed to take over the leadership from October 1 , and to change his team to Sch@@ ong@@ au . &quot;
&quot; for the house in Sch@@ ong@@ au this applies in every case a &quot; &quot; appreciation &quot; &quot; and a spread of the offer in the area &quot; &quot; Internal Medicine &quot; , &quot; said J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß . &quot;
Fischer is a specialist in pac@@ em@@ akers and de@@ fibr@@ ill@@ ators .
Sch@@ ong@@ au ( 180 beds ) is specialized on the inside stop on g@@ astro@@ enter@@ ological diseases .
&quot; for the next two years , Fischer is said to be with his team if the Supervisory Board agre@@ es to the two houses , until then next year , the former hospital of the scar@@ ce , which still has 35 beds to be finally closed in Pei@@ ßen@@ berg after almost 140 years . &quot;
&quot; until now , the administrative district had planned this for 2018 , when the currently running refurbis@@ hment at the hospital of Wei@@ l@@ heim has been completed . &quot;
&quot; the coun@@ cill@@ or J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß , who is also chairman of the Supervisory Board , meets rum@@ ors that the House , which is owned by the Bundes@@ kn@@ app@@ schaft , will in future be used as an accommodation for asylum seek@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; I conclude this . as it goes on with the property , J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß could not say there are several considerations . &quot;
currently there is a short @-@ term care of the Car@@ itas and a daily sy@@ chiat@@ ry .
&quot; what better it could not happen to us , such an opportunity does not come back , &quot; says Fischer about the Qu@@ asi proc@@ ession to the Le@@ ch , which was received by employees &quot; positive and very understanding . &quot; &quot;
&quot; a real perspective for the house , which fisher@@ man has been working as a chief physician for over 30 years , did not give it . &quot;
he was asked by Sch@@ ong@@ auer colleagues to take over the position of the medical director .
&quot; the hospital Pei@@ ßen@@ berg ( formerly 100 beds ) has always been threatened with closure in recent decades , det@@ achments were closed , for example surgery and ob@@ st@@ et@@ rics . &quot;
the hand@@ b@@ aller of the Rhein @-@ Neck@@ ar lions are required tonight ( 20.@@ 15 p.m. ) at the Berg@@ isches HC .
&quot; the leader of the Bundes@@ liga is the clear favourite in Wuppertal , but there is no reason for arrogan@@ ce . &quot;
&quot; during the last season , the bad@@ ener moved a painful defeat at the Bh@@ c and got something good there . &quot;

a crime suspic@@ ious has led the police to the body of the 16 @-@ year @-@ old missing from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate for Saturday .
&quot; in inter@@ rog@@ ation , the 20 @-@ year @-@ old was to have killed the young people and threw their bodies into a channel in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen . &quot;
&quot; one since Saturday , 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate has fallen victim to violent crimes . &quot;
&quot; the body of the young woman was found on Tuesday evening at Rock@@ enh@@ ausen near Kais@@ ers@@ lau@@ tern , such as the Prosec@@ ution and the Police on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; as a susp@@ ect , a 20 @-@ year @-@ old arrested on Tuesday evening , who indeed stated the statement , and led the investig@@ ators to the discovery site of the cor@@ p@@ se . &quot;
the 16 @-@ year @-@ old had been reported on Sunday morning after she did not come home after a visit of an autumn festival in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen as agreed .
&quot; in search of the young woman , investig@@ ators initially met personal bel@@ ong@@ ings of the victim . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; the alleged perpetr@@ ator then led the police to a channel in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen , where the bodies were found . &quot;
&quot; according to the authorities , the authorities were report@@ edly killed in police inter@@ rog@@ ation , killing 16 @-@ year @-@ old and put the bodies into the canal . &quot;
&quot; the 20 @-@ year @-@ old should be led to the Haf@@ tri@@ chter on Wednesday , the investig@@ ators put him to death . &quot;

refugees need accommodation : study war@@ ns of housing shortage
the location on the German housing market is ten@@ se .
more and more refugees are looking for an affordable stay .
the pressure on the housing market is growing .
social housing construction is facing a challenge .
the distribution matches on the German housing market have long since begun .
&quot; with the upcoming refugees and job@@ seek@@ ers from the EU , more and more people are pushing for a market that is already over@@ loaded in many big cities . &quot;
they compete with income @-@ poor citizens around the last affordable housing .
&quot; in order to cover the demand for affordable housing , 400@@ ,000 new units would have to be built every year by 2020 . &quot;
&quot; as a result , a study commissioned by the association &quot; Social Housing Construction &quot; will be commissioned . &quot;
&quot; for comparison : this year , 26@@ 0,000 units will be completed . &quot;
&quot; with this , 14@@ 0,000 apartments are missing . &quot;
&quot; after the first three months of their stay , refugees are no longer obliged to live as asylum seek@@ ers in an initial emergency . &quot;
many come across the apartment market and lined up in the long queu@@ es in front of the apartments .
&quot; according to the Federal Statistical Office , however , less than half of all asylum seek@@ ers lived in the last year . &quot;
&quot; however , the negative development of the housing market is not only due to the rising number of refugees . &quot;
the study also makes significant fail@@ ures in the housing policy of recent years .
&quot; Germany pus@@ hes a housing deficit in front of itself , which becomes larger from year to year . &quot;
&quot; currently , some 7@@ 0,000 units have been missing in the metrop@@ olitan areas , compl@@ ains Matthias Günther , author of the study . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , many professionals lived in large cities in W@@ G rooms . &quot;
young adults stayed un@@ voluntarily due to the F@@ lau@@ te on the housing market longer in the &quot; Hotel Mama . &quot;
&quot; in the big cities , the number of square meters per capit@@ a has declined again for the first time in recent years . &quot;
&quot; in order to solve the problem , the Alliance &quot; Social Housing Construction &quot; proposes a restart . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , new incen@@ tives should boost the social housing construction . &quot;
&quot; in this way , the land Tax tax could not be wai@@ ved and the property tax for subsi@@ dised flats may be suspended . &quot;
&quot; moreover , according to alliance attractive tax amor@@ tis@@ ation possibilities are necessary . &quot;
the funding programme for Refu@@ ge@@ e Refu@@ ge@@ es of the state bank Kf@@ W is already well received by towns and municipalities .
&quot; a good week after the start , on Monday evening , with 184 million euros , more than half of the available costs have been rec@@ alled . &quot;
now the project could even be raised .
refugees have free money : Croatia and Slovenia direct cor@@ ridor
&quot; in Hungary , practically no di@@ arr@@ he@@ a is more , since more and more refugees choose the way over Croatia . &quot;
Zagreb announces to grant transit through Slovenia to the North without hur@@ d@@ les .
but the route is dangerous .
Croatia wants to communicate with neighbouring Slovenia via the establishment of a cor@@ ridor for refugees .
&quot; I spoke to the Slov@@ ene Interior Minister and if it is necessary , we will organize a cor@@ ridor , &quot; &quot; said Croatian Minister of Interior , R@@ ank@@ o O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic . &quot;
Slovenia lies between Croatia and Austria and is already part of the Schengen area .
the EU country Croatia is not yet a Schengen country .
&quot; after the isolation of the Serbian @-@ Hungarian border , hundreds of refugees came to Croatia to get to Western Europe from there . &quot;
&quot; 500 people have come across the border with T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik , the Croatian TV station RT@@ L reports . &quot;
&quot; at the day of the day , Hungary had sealed off its border for refugees . &quot;
&quot; new laws , which came into force on the same day , make excessive asylum procedures in Hungary virtually unnecessary . &quot;
Croatia wants to let the refugees pass .
&quot; the Croatian Prime Minister Zor@@ an Mil@@ an@@ ovic stated , &quot; You can travel through , and we prepare for this possibility . &quot;
&quot; these people are there , they are women , children and men who want to live and achieve something . &quot;
&quot; however , there are people who did not want to live in Croatia . &quot;
&quot; in the morning , the Croatian police took up the first refugees at the Serbian border to the EU neighbourhood of Croatia . &quot;
&quot; most of the reports came from Syria , Iran and Afghanistan . &quot;
they came both by bus and with taxis to the Serbian border town of Si@@ d .
&quot; immediately after their arrival , they would have tried to get on foot over the green border to Croatia . &quot;
&quot; at the Croatian @-@ Serbian border , the refugees do not encounter border fence . &quot;
&quot; for this , the border strip contains other dangers : there are still sharp mines from the Yugosla@@ v civil war in the 90@@ s . &quot;
mine clearance should quickly create a safe passage .
&quot; according to Hungary , there are hardly any refugees after the closure of the border . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , the police numbered 366 people . &quot;
shortly before closing on Monday it had been 93@@ 80 .
the new Hungarian laws ampli@@ fy the over@@ coming and damage of the border zone as a crime .
&quot; therefore , 35 pen@@ alties were initiated in the South @-@ Hungarian border town of Sz@@ eg@@ ed . &quot;
the condemned prison sentences of up to five years and the deport@@ ation from the country .
&quot; according to the immigration authority , a total of 94 asylum applications have been accepted on Tuesday in the newly appointed &quot; Tran@@ sit zones &quot; on Tuesday , almost all of them - 93 - the most important transition from R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke . &quot;
&quot; among the applicants , 13 families with small children , as well as two elderly people . &quot;
&quot; on Wednesday morning , 40 refugees would have stopped there . &quot;
&quot; in practice , however , no one has a prospect of granted asylum in Hungary . &quot;
&quot; according to Hungarian opinion , Serbia is a &quot; &quot; safe third country . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the rejected asylum seek@@ ers shall be dep@@ orted there .
only a few hundred refugees gathered in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke in front of the &quot; transit zone &quot; in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
&quot; in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke , workers began to clean up with it . &quot;
&quot; they gathered the gar@@ bage , leaving the tens of thousands of people in the past few weeks at the road@@ side . &quot;
barrier guards were disman@@ tled and one of the recording centers in the border place was rebuilt .
no one wanted to express himself about the goal of this reconstruction .
&quot; after the closure of the border between Serbia and Hungary , Austria reach only a few refugees . &quot;
the country has also strengthened its border controls .
&quot; however , around 20,000 migrants were still in the country . &quot;
&quot; in Salzburg , about 1400 people are waiting for the journey to Germany . &quot;
the train traffic from there to Germany was stopped at the instruction of German authorities in the morning .
&quot; in Frei@@ las@@ sing , smaller groups of refugees met on foot regularly . &quot;
mayor drove &quot; str@@ and@@ ete &quot; across the border
&quot; we were occupied after the bridge festival on Sunday , when suddenly ten people with travel k@@ off@@ s stood at the entrance of the tent , &quot; said W@@ ern@@ stein mayor Alo@@ is Stad@@ ler . &quot;
&quot; tourists , they wanted to go by train to Pass@@ au . &quot;
&quot; because Germany had surprisingly set the rail traffic with Austria on Sunday due to the flow of refugees , it was in W@@ ern@@ stein &apos;s end , &quot; so Stad@@ ler , who immediately offered his help and ch@@ apped the borders together with two other hel@@ pers and their cars over the border into the Nah@@ e Pass@@ au . &quot;
&quot; prior to that , we first cut the un@@ hoped guests , with snacks and drinks . &quot;
&quot; we have said the same thing , we bring them by car to Pass@@ au . &quot;
&quot; this was a matter of course for us , &quot; says Stad@@ ler in the O@@ Ö@@ N discussion . &quot;
they were very thank@@ ful .
a man did not let it take to give a generous donation - 100 Euro for the fire bri@@ g@@ ade .
&quot; we were very pleased , &quot; says Stad@@ ler . &quot;
&quot; the str@@ anded train passengers were switched off on Sunday evening in W@@ els by an ICE in a regional train towards Pass@@ au , in order to try the railway traffic to Germany after the short notice that the railway traffic was set to Germany , but still to try the border . &quot;
&quot; the regional train , however , was completed before the border in W@@ ern@@ stein at the Inn . &quot;
in W@@ ern@@ stein the border crossing is generally high in the course .
&quot; the Brück@@ en@@ fest association with the Bavarian neighbours on Sunday soci@@ ably , day before a two @-@ brid@@ ged run sporting - organized by the Union W@@ ern@@ stein and Bayern from Neu@@ kirchen . &quot;
the fact that Viktor Or@@ b@@ án has now sent tens of thousands of thousands to us is a logical result of a hypo@@ critical policy :
&quot; instead of helping to establish structures that ensure humanity , our Federal Chancellor has officially put up the position of the Hungarian government in the Dun@@ st@@ kreis of National Socialism . &quot;
&quot; sorry , there is no translation for this news @-@ article . &quot;
&quot; also the poultry will find that the &quot; &quot; Pro@@ mis@@ ed Land &quot; &quot; that she has invited and welcomed , nothing but another refugee camp . &quot;
&quot; it will become a great challenge , given the ongoing flow of refugees and the coming winter , to create decent conditions for protective seek@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; and there will be an even greater - peace , security and stability in Austria . &quot;
Konrad at the search for 35@@ .000 Winter@@ fest Quar@@ ts
&quot; with the support of the refugees , Konrad has all hands full to do . &quot;
Christian Konrad is acc@@ u@@ stom@@ ed to his word weight .
the government has used the former powerful Rai@@ ff@@ eisen banks to set up lod@@ gings for thousands of refugees .
the chaos in the first @-@ tak@@ eover centre Tra@@ is@@ kirchen has already got a grip on Konrad .
&quot; we have no hom@@ eless more in Tra@@ is@@ kirchen , &quot; he told his first success . &quot;
&quot; also the accommodation of the 20,000 refugees , who came to Austria on Monday , was without big confusion , said Konrad and praised the organisational &quot; master performance . &quot; &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , the Ministry of Interior spoke of a &quot; crisis @-@ like situation . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in total , Konrad calcul@@ ates with a demand of 85@@ .000 quart@@ ets in the he@@ ur@@ y year . &quot;
&quot; in order to meet the number , 35@@ ,000 accommodations will have to be found in the coming weeks - 20,000 are to provide the federal states . &quot;
&quot; should it be more refugees , we can create it . &quot;
&quot; but it is not a drum without soil , &quot; &quot; said Konrad . &quot;
he has already had discussions with the heads of the state .
they would have assured him to create lod@@ gings even for the coming refugees .
&quot; in Upper Austria it runs well , &quot; &quot; said Ferry Mai@@ er . &quot;
the former VP @-@ mand@@ olin supports Konrad .
&quot; tomorrow , there will be a meeting with Cardinal Christoph Schön@@ born to be clari@@ fied , as the Church will help . &quot;
&quot; the asylum @-@ coordin@@ ator also places great expectations in the OR@@ F campaign , &quot; Hel@@ ping as we . &quot; &quot;
on the platform private persons can offer un@@ complicated accommodations .
&quot; in addition , one hopes to find hotels that are empty in winter . &quot;
&quot; Konrad and Mai@@ er yesterday critic@@ ised the standards for housing as &quot; &quot; very high . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; in times of emergency , it cannot be that Qu@@ arti@@ er@@ ers have to maintain a certain amount of the towel holder or size of the overhead . &quot;
&quot; for a temporary period of time , &quot; emergency standards &quot; would have to be considered . &quot;
&quot; in contrast to the Interior Ministry , he is successful in placing more successful , Konrad with his experience . &quot;
&quot; I am an older gentle@@ man , whom one does not say without further into the face of fal@@ seh@@ ood . &quot;
persu@@ asi@@ veness is his most important weapon .
Konrad and Mai@@ er no longer cause the Republic to explain how they themselves explained .
their number of employees want to increase them to three to four .
our own quest for accommodation has not been successful until now .
Konrad wanted to establish a container at Steph@@ an@@ splatz as an office .
&quot; however , there are apparently problems with the permission . &quot;
Linz calls for a better division
no opening of municipal sports hall and other buildings such as tips @-@ arena and design center to accommodate refugees is planning the city of Linz .
&quot; this is not necessary at the moment , since the affected people are currently unable to carry out these measures , says mayor Klaus Lu@@ ger ( SP ) . &quot;
&quot; for emer@@ gen@@ cies , however , further locations should be tested for its suitability . &quot;
criticism exer@@ ts the governor in the division of the refugees within the Federal State .
other districts also have to contribute to their contribution .
seals : &quot; limits are not sealed &quot;
&quot; in a longer telephone call with the Bavarian Prime Minister Horst Seeh@@ o@@ fer ( CS@@ U ) , Landes@@ haupt@@ mann Josef P@@ ühr@@ inger ( VP ) held the further procedure in the refugee issue on Monday . &quot;
Seeh@@ o@@ fer ass@@ ures me that the German borders will not be sealed off .
the journey of refugees to the Federal Republic of Germany is still possible .
&quot; however , there is now the corresponding border controls . &quot;
there will be no more special requests for refugees in Germany .
the protective seek@@ ers would however be brought to Germany with regular trains .
&quot; from the other EU member states , P@@ ühr@@ inger once called for greater solidarity in the refugee problem . &quot;
&quot; for P@@ ühr@@ inger &quot; &quot; a logical consequence &quot; &quot; is a logical consequence of the procedure of the Germans . &quot;
Run@@ t@@ astic is a matter of time
the general renovation of the &quot; new shi@@ py@@ ard &quot; in the Lin@@ zer Industrie@@ zeile is officially closed .
&quot; in four of the six floors of the office and production building , the listed IT group S &amp; T is moved , the rest ( 2700 square meters ) is to be rented to young , innovative companies from the technology sector . &quot;
&quot; in IT , the smart heads are our raw material - and we have to try to work for us , &quot; says S &amp; T CEO Hannes Nieder@@ haus@@ er . &quot;
he could imagine investing in start @-@ up companies of the new shi@@ py@@ ard and later acquire what to acquire .
&quot; from the very beginning , S &amp; T wants to co @-@ operate with the new neighbours - from which Nieder@@ haus@@ er promises a lot : &quot; the next Run@@ t@@ astic is just a matter of time . &quot;
&quot; 1.7 million euros have been invested in the site by S &amp; T , 3.3 million euros from the Tech@@ Center , which belongs to one third of the city of Linz , the country of Upper Austria and the Federal Government ( FF@@ G ) . &quot;
the building is le@@ ased by Linz AG for 60 years at S &amp; T as well as Tech@@ Center .
&quot; 30 per cent of the 2700 square meter space in the building are already rented , for more 40 per cent there are requests . &quot;
Li@@ a @-@ Per@@ oni @-@ In@@ hab@@ or opened second business in the arcade
Fur@@ la hand@@ bags are at the centre of the new shop .
&quot; actually , Jutta Bre@@ eit wanted to get a dog . &quot;
&quot; this project had to shift the 49 @-@ year @-@ old owner of Li@@ a Per@@ oni in the do@@ ve market arcade : finally , she now got an increase in the form of another business location . &quot;
&quot; in the Fur@@ la @-@ Shop opposite the shop in which they sold among other bags , suit@@ cases , shoes and clothing from various manufacturers , now everything revol@@ ves around ladies hand@@ bags of the brand Fur@@ la , pur@@ ses are available from 75 euros . &quot;
larger bags and accessories cost up to 500 euros .
the new shop has been in operation since yesterday .
&quot; previously , several weeks have been rebuilt . &quot;
&quot; but I think that I should open a store for a long time , &quot; &quot; says Br@@ eit . &quot;
&quot; among other things the decision was , among other things , that the Fur@@ la producers , who are at home in Bologna , from the idea of an own site where only their hand@@ bags were sold . &quot;
&quot; we are the only ones in the big room of Linz , who sell this brand , &quot; says the mother of two daughters who even has Italian roots . &quot;
her fashion interest has gotten eit from her mother to the cra@@ dle .
&quot; most , when something developed and I can show new trends at affordable prices . &quot;
&quot; why so many women in the sight of a beautiful hand@@ bag in rap@@ ture , the professional woman can not answer with the last security . &quot;
maybe it &apos;s because a beautiful bag is enhanced every outfit .
the Br@@ ul@@ jes@@ macher from K@@ all@@ stadt
the Pf@@ äl@@ zer ancestors of Donald Tr@@ ump came from a place whose inhabitants are called An@@ gi@@ ers .
&quot; this property also connects many people with the billi@@ on@@ aire , who wants to become the US president . &quot;
Donald Tr@@ ump ( 69 ) is always good for excitement .
&quot; whether it mani@@ f@@ ests itself stran@@ gely , journalists are rum@@ ored or revealed information gaps in the international crisis policy - the applicant for the U.S. Pres@@ idency s@@ wir@@ ls the election campaign vigor@@ ously . &quot;
and cut off well .
&quot; this is also registered in the Pal@@ at@@ inate K@@ all@@ stadt , where the grand@@ parents of the real estate billi@@ on@@ aire come from . &quot;
the New Yorker with the F@@ öhn@@ ungs@@ fris@@ ur is a concept for many in the Win@@ zer@@ dorf an der Wein@@ straße .
some in the 1200 inhabitants @-@ place is related over -@@ zig corners with it .
&quot; his grandfather came from K@@ all@@ stadt in the Pal@@ at@@ inate : Donald Tr@@ ump , here in campaign mode . &quot;
the K@@ all@@ städ@@ ter Simone Wen@@ del made a film about Tr@@ ump .
and what do the vill@@ agers think about his goal of becoming more powerful man in the world ?
&quot; I think they find that somehow exciting , but are not so deeply impressed in their K@@ all@@ stadt fashion , &quot; says Simone Wen@@ del . &quot;
&quot; the native K@@ all@@ städ@@ ter has fil@@ med an am@@ using documentary about the place and its famous sho@@ ots , among which Tr@@ ump also counts the K@@ et@@ ch@@ up family Heinz . &quot;
&quot; Tr@@ ump , who is not known for mo@@ dest@@ y , comes in &quot; Kings of K@@ all@@ stadt &quot; ( 2014 ) as well - so with the statement that he would certainly be successful if he would live in K@@ all@@ stadt . &quot;
he did not bring it to the king of the hearts .
&quot; although there is respect for the power of the family , but also the opinion that Tr@@ ump is already a bit &apos; mau@@ l &apos; , Wen@@ del says . &quot;
&quot; inci@@ dentally , the nick@@ name , the K@@ all@@ stadt within the radius , &quot; &quot; The Br@@ ul@@ jes@@ macher &quot; &quot; - to the high German : the legislat@@ ure , says it . &quot;
so Tr@@ ump comes from the village of the legislat@@ ors .
&quot; the Tr@@ ump &apos;s success story began 1885 , when the later grandfather immig@@ rated and opened a pub for gold dig@@ gers in the USA . &quot;
the foundation stone of the real estate company were the first real estate purchases in New York .
&quot; but the life of the grand@@ parents was not free of tragedy : their desire to return to the home , failed at the Bavarian State , to which the Pal@@ at@@ inate was at that time . &quot;
&quot; he did not take Tr@@ ump , because he was once without permission , the director of the Institute for Pf@@ äl@@ z@@ ische Geschichte und Volk@@ sk@@ unde , Roland Paul , was declared a film start . &quot;
&quot; Tr@@ ump is the grand@@ son of an &quot; &quot; illegal emig@@ rant &quot; . &quot; &quot;
this is in contrast to the no@@ isy claims of the desc@@ endant .
he had repeatedly spoken about Mexican immigrants in the US and demanded the construction of a border wall to deter illegal immigrants .
&quot; as the pol@@ tert , this is not so li@@ ke@@ able , &quot; says Hans @-@ Joachim Ben@@ der , a distant relative of Tr@@ umps ( &quot; The Grand@@ ma was a born Tr@@ ump , the Op@@ a was born Heinz &quot; ) . &quot;
&quot; the win@@ emaker in retirement sees the Americans rather dist@@ ancing , &quot; he is always so up@@ set . &quot;
does he believe that Tr@@ ump comes ?
&quot; I cannot imagine that , &quot; says the 72 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;
&quot; he never took care of K@@ all@@ stadt . &quot;
&quot; the pension vert@@ ine Ver@@ oni@@ ka Sch@@ ramm is mentioned as man@@ ger K@@ all@@ stad@@ ter , that a desc@@ endant of the Heinz &apos;s family donated a little for the church organ , which was generally well anch@@ ored . &quot;
&quot; that can &apos;t be imagined by the Donald , &quot; says the 68 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;
&quot; it would be better if he did not w@@ ander the election , for &quot; he has such radical views , I don &apos;t know if that is good . &quot;
&quot; if those who had the sa@@ ws at the time of his grandfather in the US would have been like him , &quot; he would never have arrived there . &quot;
&quot; there are more interesting topics than him , &quot; says Win@@ zer@@ to@@ chter Sarah Büh@@ ler . &quot;
and as president ?
&quot; my president is not , &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; and : &quot; &quot; the grapes are ripe also without the president Tr@@ ump . &quot;
&quot; Wen@@ dels &apos;s film , for whom Tr@@ ump was inter@@ viewed for a long time , have seen 12 000 cinem@@ at@@ ograph@@ ers , also in the United States awak@@ ens the interest . &quot;
the Upper Bavaria municipality Ram@@ sau near Ber@@ cht@@ es@@ g@@ aden is Germany &apos;s first &quot; mountain@@ eering village . &quot;

&quot; in Austria , there are already 20 &quot; mountain clim@@ bers . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in neighbouring countries , the local Alpine Club is responsible for awar@@ ding the award . &quot;
a &quot; mountain@@ eering village &quot; must have a maximum of 2500 inhabitants .

&quot; Karl Stef@@ an@@ ovic and Lisa Wil@@ kinson make ha@@ ste to Can@@ ber@@ ra to report to the loss of the Liber@@ als leadership , but there are no major shifts in the reviews for Today . &quot;

&quot; the Ri@@ val Sun@@ rise , with moder@@ ators David Koch and Sam@@ antha Ar@@ my@@ tage , joined London as part of a week @-@ long series of international television programmes , including Dubai , New York , Ni@@ ag@@ ara Falls and Can@@ cu@@ n . &quot;
&quot; this dis@@ advantage of the board seemed to play no role for Australian TV viewers as Sun@@ rise recorded an average of 39@@ 7,@@ 000 spectators at the five capitals compared with Today 3@@ 39@@ ,000 . &quot;
&quot; today , a slight increase in ratings for Monday ( 3@@ 17@@ ,000 ) and last Tuesday ( 28@@ 3,000 ) , but its number remained behind the last Thursday ( 34@@ 3,000 ) . &quot;
today the gap to Sun@@ rise has closed in recent months .
&quot; in August today , today , today average 3@@ 18@@ ,000 in comparison to the 330@@ ,000 of Sun@@ rise . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the year , the distance ran between 4@@ 0,000 and 50,000 . &quot;
&quot; up to now in September Sun@@ rise stands at an average of 3@@ 49@@ ,000 viewers to 3@@ 14@@ ,000 in today . &quot;

the great news for Seven was the impressive debut of 800 words with the former Seri@@ enst@@ ar von Pack@@ ed to the Raf@@ ters Erik Thom@@ son .
&quot; the new drama on a recently wit@@ ted father , who decides to settle down with his two children at New Zealand &apos;s coast , reached a very impressive figure of 1,@@ 219 million spectators . &quot;
critics were asked if Thom@@ son could wear a hit show solo without the Raf@@ ters Star Rebecca Gib@@ ney .
&quot; the result of yesterday evening answered this with a clear &quot; &quot; yes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the X @-@ Factor of Seven remained strong with 1,@@ 136 million viewers and hit light The Block ( 8@@ 38@@ ,000 ) and T@@ BL Famili@@ es ( 7@@ 26@@ ,000 ) . &quot;
seven had mixed results in the evening two by The Ch@@ ase Australia .
&quot; the first half hour ( 17 : 00 to 17 : 30 ) of the new qui@@ z show , presented by Andrew O &apos;@@ Ke@@ ef@@ e , presented an average of 4@@ 46@@ ,000 spectators . &quot;
&quot; the second half hour ( 17 : 30 to 18 : 00 ) j@@ umped to 6@@ 23@@ ,000 spectators - enough for a small win over Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ires Hot @-@ Seat ( 6@@ 13@@ ,000 ) . &quot;
&quot; on Monday evening the first half hour of The Ch@@ ase Australia reached 5@@ 20,000 spectators and in the second half hour sat@@ te 7@@ 20,000 . &quot;

the last three voices agree : Bachelor Sam Wood is the perfect man - but who will he choose ?
secret revealed ? ...
&quot; L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows , Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and Sne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki possibly have unknow@@ ingly revealed who wins The Bachelor . &quot;
&quot; the woman , who finally lands Sam Wood in The Bachelor , was envel@@ op@@ ed in greatest sec@@ rec@@ y . &quot;
&quot; and none of the three remaining girls will certainly not reveal if she is the one , who has received the last rose . &quot;
&quot; but when we checked with Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay , Sne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki and L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows on the day before out of three , you may have acci@@ dentally given a hint to who will be the winner . &quot;
Sam Wood keeps his lips ti@@ ghtly sealed until the final on Thursday
&quot; all three women have reli@@ ed on ly@@ ric ways of why Wood is the perfect man and they called his sense of hum@@ our , ambition , family values and positive attitude as reasons why they would like to be his partner . &quot;
&quot; however , if the question is asked &quot; If not you , who should receive W@@ oods last rose ? &quot; could their answers be to the game @-@ destro@@ yer who won the heart of the Bachel@@ ors . &quot;
Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows and Mark@@ os@@ ki called both quickly - except themselves - M@@ ack@@ ay as the best partner for Wood .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and Sam Wood have had a simple relationship from the first day .
&quot; from the moment I went to the house and ( Sar@@ ahs ) and S@@ ams energies noticed , I felt that they were quite compatible and I thought that throughout the show , &quot; &quot; said Je@@ av@@ on Fel@@ lows . &quot;
&quot; Sarah is standing on the ground with both feet , making it so much fun to be together with her , &quot; added Mark@@ os@@ ki . &quot;
I have seen them together and they have the right chemistry .
they feel comfortable and comfortable with each other .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay believes she and Sam Wood would be well suited as a couple .
&quot; from her point of view , M@@ ack@@ ay said that the house visit last week made her clear that Wood could be &quot; &quot; one &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; as soon as I saw him with my friends and family , it became clear to me that this is obviously not just a game - I am now un@@ reserv@@ edly att@@ un@@ ed to him , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; and when she was asked whom Wood should choose , if not she , she was pu@@ zz@@ ling . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t know if I can say it , &quot; she said . &quot;
I love the remaining girls equally - it &apos;s a draw between Sne@@ z@@ ana and L@@ ana .
&quot; the bach@@ el@@ or will be broadcast on Wednesday , 19 : 30 . &quot;

Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne had several options to start his N@@ FL career .
Detroit and Seattle showed great interest after moving to the USA - and there were many other teams who sent requests after his impressive open training day at the end of last year .
but Hay@@ ne chose the San Francisco 49@@ ers and trainer Jim Tom@@ s@@ ula and it looks like a clever decision .
some trainers had ban@@ ished Hay@@ ne for the rest of the game on the bank when he lost a bar@@ gain as he did the Aus@@ sie @-@ Rugby League Conver@@ ti@@ t at his first Pun@@ t @-@ Return on Tuesday at 20 @-@ 3 victory against Minn@@ es@@ ota .
but Tom@@ s@@ ula trusted his husband and gave Hay@@ ne the next opportunity to a Pun@@ t return and also to the ongoing game after a violation of Reg@@ gie Bush .
Tom@@ s@@ ula continues to show his true face in the dressing cabin after the game .
&quot; instead of gr@@ ind his ro@@ ok@@ ies before the rest of the team , he encouraged them . &quot;
Tom@@ s@@ ula also strengthened Hay@@ ne publicly in his press conference after the game .
&quot; the 49@@ ers Sport@@ rep@@ orter Cam In@@ man reported that Hay@@ ne was also encouraged by special teams coordin@@ ator Thomas Mc@@ Gau@@ gh@@ ey , who advised him to forget his scrat@@ ched catch and take care of the next game . &quot;
Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne p@@ atz@@ t at a pun@@ t restored in the first playing district of Minn@@ es@@ ota Vi@@ kings
&quot; it was certainly not the start , the Hay@@ ne and his massive Australian spirit for his N@@ FL debut . &quot;
&quot; after the F@@ um@@ ble , Hay@@ ne left the playing field after the F@@ um@@ ble and later told the Australian radio duo Ham@@ ish &amp; Andy on 2@@ Day@@ FM 10@@ 4.1 that he couldn &apos;t imagine a worse start into his N@@ FL career , &quot;
&quot; that was a thing that happens now , one takes care of the next game , and that &apos;s it , &quot; Hay@@ ne said . &quot;
Hay@@ ne compared the car@@ ver with his original debut at that time in 2007 when a pass led to a T@@ ry for Que@@ ens@@ land in his own in @-@ Go@@ al area .
&quot; overall , it was nevertheless a great experience for the 27 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;

the Free voters demand the employment of 1000 new teachers in Bavaria because of the high refugee figures .
&quot; at the beginning of the FW @-@ Herbst@@ kl@@ au@@ sur in Groß@@ wall@@ stadt , the party and fac@@ tional leader Hubert A@@ iw@@ anger warned about a severe crisis in Bavaria &apos;s schools if there is no new teacher for the many new students : &quot; &quot; we need at least 1000 additional teachers to keep schools from collapse , &quot; &quot; said A@@ iw@@ anger . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , we will get pun@@ ish@@ ments in the Bavarian educational system . &quot;
the day @-@ to @-@ day fraction of the free voters tag@@ t until Friday in the Fran@@ con@@ ian commun@@ e .
&quot; in fact , completely different main themes were planned . &quot;
but the record number of refugees now also domin@@ ates the Free Select @-@ Meeting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; of course , the subject of asylum is over@@ hau@@ led , &quot; &quot; said A@@ iw@@ anger . &quot;
&quot; A@@ iw@@ anger called for the establishment of UN protection zones for refugees in Syria , as was it during the war in Yugoslavia during the 1990s . &quot;
&quot; so it &apos;s not going on , we have to go to the causes , &quot; &quot; said the Free Elec@@ tor boss . &quot;
rejected asylum seek@@ ers want to push the free voters as soon as possible .
&quot; therefore , A@@ iw@@ anger demanded more staff for the administrative courts responsible for asylum claims : &quot; &quot; we need at least 50 new asylum judges , &quot; &quot; said A@@ iw@@ anger . &quot;
&quot; the FW @-@ boss critici@@ zed that several federal states were not consistent : &quot; &quot; we needed nationwide uniform standards of the federal states . &quot;
&quot; Bavaria moves away , others do not . &quot;
&quot; we need to become more respon@@ sive . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; however , the regional policy should not fall under the table under the table . &quot;
a long @-@ term permanent bur@@ ners remain on the agenda : the policy of education .
&quot; for the new school year , Kult@@ us@@ minister Ludwig Sp@@ a@@ en@@ le ( CS@@ U ) started the pilot study &quot; Mittel@@ stufe plus , &quot; in which an extension of the secondary high level of three to four years is tested - in the result it takes nine years to the final . &quot;
&quot; however , A@@ iw@@ anger is not far enough . &quot;
&quot; the topic G@@ 9 must be accelerated , &quot; said the FW boss . &quot;
we call for freedom of choice for all students who want to do that .
free ride at G@@ 9 anywhere where it is desired .
fir@@ mer Wall Street helps D@@ ax on jumps
&quot; the German stock market has closed , after a long @-@ span , trend @-@ free and nervous trading course with profits . &quot;

many Bör@@ si@@ aner expect that the markets until after the rate of interest in the US and also for the big fall at the terminals will be placed on this Friday .
&quot; the discussion about the bur@@ dens arising from the nuclear phase has left the shares of RW@@ E in between time to a record deep , and also left its mark on E@@ on &apos;s deep tracks . &quot;
&quot; according to &quot; Spiegel , &quot; German energy companies probably lack 30 billion euros in provisions . &quot;
the Federal Government denied the numbers mentioned in the press .
&quot; the share of the two largest German energy companies recovered somewhat , but ultimately lost 3.@@ 31 percent ( RW@@ E ) and 6.@@ 15 percent ( E@@ on ) . &quot;
Infin@@ eon shares increased by another 3.@@ 22 percent on the D@@ ax peak .
&quot; according to a retail@@ er , a positive report from the US investor magazine &quot; Bar@@ ron &apos;s &quot; appeared from the weekend . &quot;
&quot; accordingly , investors for@@ granted little attention to the German chip manufacturer . &quot;
investment in future @-@ driven w@@ afer technologies and the focus should be paid to the car market .
&quot; car values were asked : even in the traditionally weak summer month of August , more cars were replaced than in the same period last year , such as the association AC@@ EA to start the International Automobile Exhibition I@@ AA in Frankfurt . &quot;
the documents of the Daimler and BMW motor@@ bikes were by 1.@@ 34 percent and 2.9 per cent respectively .

4 people killed after police officers shoot gum prot@@ esters in Nepal
&quot; four people , including a 4 @-@ year @-@ old boy , were killed in Southern Nepal after the police shot rubber bul@@ ls in a crowd who demonstrated against the proposed new constitution , a civil servant said on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; the violence broke out on Tuesday evening in the Rup@@ an@@ de@@ hi district , about 175 miles west of Kath@@ mandu . &quot;
&quot; B@@ ish@@ n@@ u Pr@@ as@@ ad D@@ ha@@ kal , senior executive officer , said that more than 1,000 demonstr@@ ators had gathered outside a police station , and some of them threw stones and fire bombs . &quot;
Mr D@@ ha@@ kal said the police have used Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as and then shot in the air before they return to Gum@@ mig@@ esch@@ osse .
&quot; 20 police officers and five civilians were injured , he said . &quot;
&quot; it was not immediately clear why the used rubber bul@@ lets , known to them that they may kill , which are traditionally used as a less deadly alternative , apparently produced such a high mort@@ ality rate . &quot;
&quot; the conflict was the last in weeks of violent protests in Nepal &apos;s southern pl@@ ains , where members of the ethnic group of the M@@ adhes@@ i say that new provinces being formed within the proposed new constitution would reduce their political influence . &quot;
there were also protests in the Western Nepal of the ethnic group of Laz@@ arus who want their own state .
&quot; at least 40 people , including 11 police officers , were in violent disputes since the 10th . &quot;
&quot; when the four major political parties signed an agreement to divide the country into provinces - an important step towards a new constitution , but a very controversial subject in Nepal which has been governed centrally for centuries . &quot;
&quot; the work on a new constitution has been on its way since 2008 , but the legislat@@ ors accelerated the process after the devast@@ ating earthquake that killed thousands of people in April . &quot;
&quot; this week the legislat@@ ors voted on certain cl@@ auses in the draft constitution in Kath@@ mandu , and officials said that the new constitution could enter into force on Sunday . &quot;
construction area planned in the city
the property at the Em@@ my Youth Centre Alte Post is to be restored .
the city currently prepar@@ es everything for the marketing of the 4000 square meter area .
&quot; a mixture of trade , commercial and living - concrete offers are not yet planned . &quot;
Em@@ den - The city of Em@@ den wants to market an approximately 4000 square meter plot in direct neighbourhood to the Art Centre Alte Post .
the preparations for this are currently underway .
&quot; it is planned to use the terrain for a mix of trade , commercial and living . &quot;
&quot; wait for appropriate offers , it is said by the city . &quot;
what investor has to ask is not yet clear .
&quot; accordingly , no contracts were concluded . &quot;
&quot; the city of Em@@ den had a part of the property , which is located on the main road / corner of Great Street , already a few months ago , and the building was disman@@ tled . &quot;
project H@@ ieve : details lie on the table
the plans for an agriturismo at the Small Sea near Em@@ den take shape .
the investor made public plans for the project for the first time .
several An@@ lieg@@ er are further troubled - they fear the sale of their leisure fu@@ gi@@ um
&quot; for months , behind closed doors was negoti@@ ated , p@@ onder@@ ed , deb@@ ated and drawn . &quot;
now the plans for a new holiday settlement at the Small Sea close to Em@@ den on the table .
&quot; the prospective , medium @-@ sized emblem company &quot; System @-@ Bau , &quot; presented its plans for the first time on Monday evening in the Development Committee of the Em@@ den Council . &quot;
&quot; originally , this point had been on the non @-@ public part of the agenda . &quot;
&quot; under the pressure of the project critic and the F@@ DP group , which war@@ med the investor and administration of sec@@ rec@@ y , Ralf Behr@@ ends went to the offensive : &quot; we have not yet answered all questions , &quot; he said in front of the Council members and more than 50 visitors . &quot;
but it is good to be able to meet all rum@@ ours now .
the project has been around ten to twelve million Euros for months in the discussion .
&quot; hef@@ ty reactions among hor@@ se@@ power owners , who had come to the meeting , called forth the pictures and new details for the desired hotel building . &quot;
&quot; Roberto Schulz , sea owner and board member in the representation of the An@@ lieg@@ er , Pro H@@ ieve , compl@@ ains : &quot; this is a cycl@@ ot@@ z that domin@@ ates all the other buildings . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , he fears like several other project critics that the traffic would be greatly increased by the intended size of the plant : &quot; &quot; all bus charges must come , so that it pays off , &quot; &quot; says Schulz &quot;
&quot; what happens exactly on the good one hect@@ are of the former restaurant , is still open . &quot;
there is still no operator .
&quot; first we have to have a conc@@ lusive concept , &quot; said Ralf Behr@@ ends . &quot;
&quot; because this still lack@@ ed , the construction plans are still variable . &quot;

Google La@@ un@@ ches Double Don@@ ation Campa@@ ign to collect 11 million dollars for refugees
&quot; Google Inc ( Goo@@ gl . O ) announced a double donation campaign to help thousands of refugees fle@@ eing the European nations , as they flee from the war torn and im@@ pover@@ ished countries . &quot;
Google has an un@@ usually personal approach when posting the donation request on his blog .
&quot; instead of letting a manager make the announcement , Rita Mas@@ oud , a Google collabor@@ ator , who fled with her family from Kab@@ ul , when she was seven years old , wrote about her personal experiences . &quot;
&quot; our trip included many dark rail@@ ways and bus rides , as well as hunger , thirst , cold and fear , &quot; she wrote . &quot;
I was lucky .
&quot; but since the refugee and migrant crisis has grown in Europe , many people like my family are des@@ perate for help . &quot;
&quot; donations go to four non @-@ profit organisations providing assistance to refugees and migrants : doctors Without Bor@@ ders , International Res@@ cue Committee , Save the Children and UN High Commissioner for Refu@@ ge@@ es . &quot;
Google said that the first global funds raised up to $ 5.5 million can be doubled to $ 11 million .
&quot; Europe is faced with its worst refugee crisis since the Second World War , largely due to the four @-@ year civil war in Syria , which has driven more than 4 million people this year . &quot;
&quot; many refugees also flee from the war torn Afghanistan , Yemen , Iraq and Libya . &quot;

weight loss surgery can be helpful for easily over@@ weight di@@ abe@@ tics .
the benefits of weight loss surgery for easily over@@ weight people with type 2 diabetes can last at least five years after a new study .
it is still too early to say if easily over@@ weight people with diabetes after weight loss surgery live longer than those who receive non @-@ surgical treatments .
&quot; mort@@ ality data require a long time to show something , &quot; said Dr. Robin Black@@ stone , an expert in weight loss surgery , who wrote a editorial to the new study in J@@ AMA Surgery . &quot;
&quot; weight loss surgery or obesity surgery , use different methods to shr@@ ink the size of the stomach . &quot;
they reduce hunger and limit the body &apos;s ability to absorb food .
&quot; over the years obesity operations have proven to be efficient for the treatment of type 2 diabetes , but most of the studies have been carried out in humans who are ab@@ normal with a Body Mass Index ( BM@@ I ) of 35 or higher . &quot;
&quot; BM@@ I , a certain amount of weight in terms of size , is considered normal between 18.5 and 24.@@ 9 . &quot;
a BM@@ I of 25 or more indicates that someone is over@@ weight and people with a BM@@ I over 30 are considered o@@ bes@@ e .
you can calculate your BM@@ I : 1.@@ us@@ a.@@ gov / 1@@ D@@ 0@@ Z@@ q@@ D@@ v .
&quot; for the new study , researchers from Tai@@ wan@@ ese Min @-@ Sh@@ eng General Hospital data that they have been collected in a study since 2007 and compare two types of obesity - gast@@ ric b@@ ypass and stomach ache - to medical treatments for type 2 diabetes in people who were easily over@@ weight . &quot;
&quot; the average BM@@ I below those who under@@ went this surgery dropped from 31 to 24,@@ 5 to the end of the fifth year in this study . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , the BM@@ I remained with those who received non @-@ surgical diabetes treatments approximately equal to 29 . &quot;
&quot; among those who undergo a surgical procedure , 36 % of the diabetes disease dissolved in total and at 28 % in part . &quot;
&quot; in comparison with diabetes , the medical @-@ treated group only dissolved in one percent and partially at only two percent . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the results were found in the controls of blood pressure , tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des and the &quot; bad &quot; L@@ DL Cholester@@ ins &quot; in general better in the &quot; surgical &quot; group , &quot; the authors found out . &quot;
&quot; the researchers also monitored the patient blood level of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c , which reflects the blood sugar levels over time . &quot;
&quot; ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c is best kept under 7 percent , write the researchers . &quot;
&quot; after surgery , the average hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c decreased from around 9 percent to around 6 percent . &quot;
&quot; in the medical therapy group , however , it remained stable at around 8 percent . &quot;
&quot; but this better &quot; gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control &quot; - as reflected in improved hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c levels - did not decrease mort@@ ality in five years , so the leading researcher Dr Chi@@ h @-@ Ch@@ eng H@@ su and his colleagues . &quot;
the research team also toler@@ ates average results in the two types of surgery .
&quot; in the fifth year , the b@@ ypass surgery group had lost more weight compared to the Gast@@ recur@@ tom@@ y group ( 18.@@ 7 vs. 14.@@ 2 kg ) , achieved higher returns in the BM@@ I ( 7.4 vs. 5.1 ) and ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c ( 3.1 % vs. 2.1 % ) and rather recorded a complete over@@ coming of the diabetes ( 46.@@ 9 % vs. 16.@@ 7 % ) . &quot;
&quot; while the new study does not show survival benefit of the surgery after five years , there are evidence from a study of he@@ avier people in Sweden that surgery leads to a longer life , says Black@@ stone from the University of Arizona , College of Medicine Phoenix . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; although the new study showed no advantage for survival in the surgery patients , Black@@ stone said it was comfor@@ ting for individuals with a BM@@ I under 35 who are interested in the procedure . &quot;
&quot; this is the critical point of this study because it says that this operation is lower in this lower BM@@ I group , without increased risk of death or kidney disease , she said . &quot;
&quot; Black@@ stone added that people and their doctors should start taking weight seriously , as soon as the patient lies with his BM@@ I between 27 and 30 . &quot;
&quot; I think that we are waiting too long until we bring people to take this seriously , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; I think that once they have accumulated these genetic changes that have firmly linked their bodies to obesity and diabetes , a revers@@ al is really difficult . &quot;
love story plays in the H@@ uns@@ rück
&quot; it is a topic that is currently increasingly popular in fiction : a young woman , un@@ popular at school times and un@@ si@@ ghtly , meets the flock of her youth after years , and he falls in love with her . &quot;
so also in the recently published novel &quot; Eig@@ ner we are not so &quot; by Lu@@ isa Bin@@ der .
&quot; beyond the love story , the novel is likely to be interesting especially for H@@ uns@@ rück readers , because he plays in Lang@@ weiler and the surrounding villages . &quot;
the main professional author was raised in Lang@@ weiler and is pleased that she was able to put a literary monument to her hom@@ etown .
&quot; it is impossible for everyone to come to Europe &quot; - Dalai Lama - RT @-@ News
&quot; Europe cannot accommodate all refugees , said the Dalai Lama and added that the real solution to the refugee crisis in the Middle East . &quot;
the Tibetan Buddhist leader urged to end violence in the home countries of the refugees .
the Dalai Lama addressed the problem of the ongoing refugee crisis at the beginning of his ten @-@ day visit to the United Kingdom in his speech on the occasion of the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Comp@@ as@@ sion in Oxford dealing with ethics studies .
he demanded that under the circumstances the interests of humanity should be placed before the interests of the individual nations or even continents .
&quot; he also stressed that the reaction of Western European countries to the refugee crisis is ad@@ mi@@ red , but the situation is not appropriate . &quot;
&quot; it is impossible for everyone to come to Europe , &quot; he said in his speech . &quot;
&quot; although the Dalai Lama praised Germany and Austria &apos;s efforts in cop@@ ing with the crisis , he stressed that there was only a temporary solution . &quot;
&quot; to take care of several thousand refugees is wonderful , but in the meantime you have to think about long @-@ term solutions such as a true peace and genuine development , mainly through education that can be created for these Muslim countries , &quot; he stressed . &quot;
&quot; in the end , we must think about how killing in their countries is reduced . &quot;
we must reduce the use of violence .
&quot; the use of violence has never solved these problems , &quot; he added . &quot;
the Dalai Lama also addressed the problem of violence and also commented George Bush &apos;s actions after the terrorist attack on September 11 and revealed that the violent reaction of the US pulled a chain of un@@ controll@@ able events .
&quot; after September 11 , I expressed my con@@ dol@@ ences in a letter to President Bush , and I told him the way to solving this problem lies in non @-@ violence . &quot;
&quot; I know his motives were good , but he set violence , and that caused unexpected consequences , &quot; &quot; said the Dalai Lama . &quot;
four@@ fold increase of hand san@@ iti@@ zer intake by children over the last 4 years
&quot; tox@@ in control centres in the US report on an almost 400 @-@ percent increase in the number of children under 12 years of age , which swal@@ low heavily alcoholic and san@@ iti@@ ative inf@@ ectious agents , such as Georgia Po@@ ison Center . &quot;
&quot; according to Dr. Gay@@ lord Lop@@ ez , director of Georgia Po@@ ison Center , the cases of revenue from hand dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants in children under 12 years of age , reporting the control centres reported , from 3.@@ 266 in 2010 to 16.@@ 117 in 2014 . &quot;
&quot; children are increasingly coming to these products , and unfortunately a percentage of them lands in the emergency room , &quot; said Lop@@ ez CN@@ N . &quot;
&quot; he said that some children dis@@ inf@@ ect dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants , while some are doing it to impress their friends , or because of a test of the social media . &quot;
videos on YouTube show how young people dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ant can drink only because of a cheap experience .
young people are supposed to have dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants mixed with alcohol @-@ containing mouth@@ wash in order to get a harder drink .
younger children can be attracted by attractive sc@@ ents of dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants .
&quot; a child doesn &apos;t think that this is bad for it , &quot; &quot; said Lop@@ ez . &quot;
many of the more attractive ( hand dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants ) are those that are perf@@ um@@ ed .
&quot; there are dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants with straw@@ berry , grapes and orange du@@ ft that are very appealing to children . &quot;
hand dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants contain between 45 and 95 percent alcohol .
&quot; especially for inf@@ ants , few sy@@ ring@@ es can lead to alcohol in@@ toxic@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; it is highly concentrated alcohol , &quot; said Dr. Stephen Thor@@ n@@ ton , medical director of the Gi@@ ft@@ emergency Centre at the University of K@@ ans@@ as , the Fox 4 in kan@@ sa City . &quot;
&quot; so , you wouldn &apos;t let slip whis@@ ky around , but people leave these hand dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants within reach of children , and when children come to it , then it is a quick way to consume lots of alcohol . &quot;
&quot; N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah Russell , a six @-@ year @-@ old girl who had recently taken four sy@@ ring@@ es from straw@@ berry frag@@ rant san@@ iti@@ zer in the school , was brought into an emergency room for treatment . &quot;
&quot; your blood alcohol concentration was 179 , twice higher than the threshold that applies in an adult by law , said Dr. Chris R@@ IT@@ CHE@@ Y , a emergency doctor who treated them at G@@ winn@@ ett Medical Center outside Atlanta . &quot;
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah laugh@@ ed her words and was unable to go when she arrived in the emergency room .
&quot; doctors supervised them overnight in a separate children &apos;s hospital on signs of brain trau@@ ma , as the girl fell by the alcohol and hit the head , said R@@ IT@@ CHE@@ Y . &quot;
&quot; that was very fri@@ ghtening , &quot; said Ort@@ oria Scott , N@@ ha@@ i@@ j@@ ahs Mother , CN@@ N . &quot;
it could have been fatal for my child .
Lop@@ ez has recommended parents and teachers to use soft @-@ free products or dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants and to store hands dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants out of the reach of the child .
&quot; in addition to alcohol in@@ toxic@@ ation , some dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants were associated with deaths . &quot;
&quot; in 2013 , two women died in Ontario , after the swal@@ lowing of hand dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants that contained a toxic , un@@ declared ingredient . &quot;
&quot; employees of health authorities susp@@ ect that the product is contained meth@@ anol , a deadly solution instead of eth@@ yl alcohol , which was listed as active ingredient . &quot;
&quot; in January , three students of the fourth class in the New York State planned to po@@ ison their &quot; gem@@ einer &quot; teacher by laying anti@@ bacterial products around the classroom , &quot; reports a police report . &quot;
the teacher is highly allergic to hand san@@ iti@@ zer and ban@@ ished them out of their room .
&quot; the police considered the promised plan as &quot; &quot; skill &quot; &quot; and pointed out disciplinary action to the school authorities . &quot;
Vil@@ lingen @-@ Schwen@@ n@@ ingen : three vehicles damaged
&quot; in case of a rear @-@ end col@@ lision between Nordr@@ ing and Her@@ dem , a 33 @-@ year @-@ old mot@@ orists have been injured . &quot;
a 60 @-@ year truck driver drove towards a round@@ about industrial area and arrived too late that two preceding vehicles had stopped at the round@@ about .
&quot; as a result , he hit the rear of an audi@@ t@@ orium with his truck and pushed this vehicle to a previously standing Ford Fi@@ esta . &quot;
&quot; at the accident involved in the accident , atomic damage occurred of about 10 000 Euro , divi@@ des the police . &quot;
the Audi of the 33 @-@ year @-@ old was no longer able to drive and had to be tow@@ ed .

&quot; there are rum@@ ors about Dis@@ harmon@@ ie at Celtic Glasgow , which was spontane@@ ously rejected by Griff@@ i@@ ths . he insi@@ sted that he and his team members do not stand under increased control , as they prepare themselves for confrontation with the Dutch tab@@ ular guide . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t think we feel under pressure , I think the players are looking forward to it . &quot;
the lack of title competition in Scottish football bored Dut@@ ch@@ man - de Bo@@ er
&quot; the former Rang@@ ers mid@@ field player and former national player of the Netherlands Ronald de Bo@@ er said that Dutch football fans have lost interest in Celtic , there is no title ri@@ val@@ ry with the Rang@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; he is currently an ambassador for Ajax , said : &quot; in Holland they show no highlights of the Celtic games more and why ? &quot;
it &apos;s because the Rang@@ ers are not there .
people here don &apos;t just talk about the return of the Rang@@ ers .
they talk about the Old Firm .
they talk about both teams and that &apos;s what they are interested in .
&quot; there is a lot of excitement in the Old @-@ Firm games , and there are not only the people in Scotland who want to see these games . &quot;
&quot; I will turn things around , swe@@ ars Dei@@ la . &quot;
&quot; R@@ onn@@ y Dei@@ la has accepted that Celtic must fight , but the Norwegian Chef s@@ wore to turn things around . &quot;
&quot; after the defeat against Malm@@ ö and the subsequent departure from the Champions League , the defeat against 10 @-@ man from Aber@@ deen , which now with five points lead to the top of the table . &quot;
&quot; but Dei@@ la said , &quot; &quot; Celtic had already had bad times before , and we will come back . &quot;
now we want to come out as soon as possible .
&quot; I know it &apos;s very frustr@@ ating and a lot of people are very , very angry or sad about what happens . &quot;
we feel the same - but we have to go on .
&quot; we really need Celtic , really the support of Celtic because that makes the players better . &quot;
working together is so important .
War@@ bur@@ ton carefully in January @-@ transfers

the ex @-@ boss of Br@@ ent@@ ford said : &quot; January @-@ transfer @-@ window is very different from the summer window . &quot;
players who come in summer have this pre @-@ season time to integrate what you have seen with our own group during this season .

&quot; Der@@ ek Mc@@ Inn@@ es admitted that his team from Aber@@ deen des@@ per@@ ately had to fight against Hamilton Ac@@ cies in order to see a seventh consecutive League victory , which gave them a lead of five points before Celtic at the top of the table thanks to Adam Ro@@ on@@ ey &apos;s El@@ f@@ meter in the first half . &quot;
&quot; Mc@@ Allen said : &quot; &quot; there is no team that has won everything , in poker games or le@@ agues , who won &apos;t win games of this kind . &quot;
unemployment in Scotland remains unchanged while in the UK .
&quot; unemployment in Scotland remained unchanged at 16@@ 4,000 during the period of May to July , while the number of people without work for the United Kingdom as a whole rose to 1.@@ 82 million in the same period . &quot;
Scotland &apos;s unemployment rate of 5.@@ 9 percent was 5.5 percent above the U@@ K@@ s as the numbers of the Office for National Statistics ( ONS ) showed .
&quot; in the meantime employment in Scotland fell by 12@@ ,000 during the three months , with the number of employees now at 2.6@@ 12@@ .000 . &quot;
&quot; in the course of the quarter , the employment rate for Scotland fell to 7@@ 4.0 percent - a figure above the UK average of 7@@ 3.5 percent . &quot;
&quot; Secretary of State for Scotland David Mund@@ ell commented on the latest figures and said : &quot; &quot; the long @-@ term plan of the government has laid the corn@@ erst@@ one for a stronger economy . &quot;
it is almost exactly one year that Scotland has made the historic decision to remain part of the United Kingdom .
&quot; in these 12 months , we have experienced further improvements in the Scottish labour market with an increase in employment and a decline in unemployment . &quot;
dr@@ unken bot@@ hers the process

why I will be witn@@ essing an execution in O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma
&quot; a little later today , except for a late legal intervention , I will see how a man is brought to death . &quot;
&quot; when it happens , and I hope that it does not happen , I will sit in a spect@@ ator gallery in the death chamber in the O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma State Pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary , when Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ p is executed by the po@@ ison @-@ sy@@ ringe . &quot;
he asked me to be one of the four official witnesses of his death .
&quot; the invitation took place for the first time in January about his best friend , and although I was sho@@ cked , I agreed . &quot;
&quot; when the day drew near , I began to fear . &quot;
so why should I do it ?
&quot; I agreed , because I thought it would be a good way to tell the whole story about the death penalty . &quot;
it would offer a unique perspective .
&quot; it is true that journalists are allowed to see exec@@ utions in the U.S. , and there are often more applications available as places , a lean lot@@ tery will take place to decide who is elected . &quot;
O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma reduced the number of media places from 12 to five .
&quot; who is selected , he will observe it emotion@@ ally . &quot;
I cannot do that .
I will sit next to Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ ps closest friend with whom I have developed my own relationship over the months with teleph@@ ones and a two and a half hours visit .
I like the guy .
we often laugh a lot when we speak .
&quot; the prison authorities say that I cannot be a witness and a journalist , so it will not be allowed to take a not@@ ebook and a pen to record what I see . &quot;
I just have to try to remember all the details .
a journalist from O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma accused me on Twitter to give up my im@@ parti@@ ality .
here is the lesson .
tell the story of the prisoner as he wants and you get access .
I compl@@ ain with her .
&quot; she admitted that she could &quot; &quot; better form@@ ulate it &quot; , &quot; but she still thinks that it &apos;s wrong what I am doing . &quot;
Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ p had a problem with some of the things I said and wrote .
&quot; he tells me not what I have to write , and I wouldn &apos;t do it even if he would do it . &quot;
I told him that he can remove me from his list of witnesses at any time .
but he wants an international rep@@ orter is present to write there .
&quot; if he dies , he thinks that the public relations work will help against the death penalty . &quot;
&quot; Kim Bell@@ ware , a rep@@ orter of Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post , will sit next to me . &quot;
&quot; if you want to know more about the case , please hear the series of pod@@ casts I have done . &quot;
I don &apos;t want to go back to all details here .
I cannot say with certainty that Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ p is innocent .
his actions after the assass@@ ination of Barry Van Tre@@ ese would blame him to be a benef@@ ici@@ ary of action .
but I believe that there is a strong probability that he is not guilty of murder .
I believe that there is not enough evidence to justify a death sentence .
I believe his execution is wrong .
and from this perspective I will see him dying .
I cannot claim to be really objective .
there will be other rep@@ or@@ ters that you can turn to .
what you will get from me is what it means to die a man die unnecessary death .
man after dam@@ p police ch@@ ase talks to get out of the C@@ anning River
the C@@ anning V@@ ale Poli@@ z@@ ist remained dry when he talked to the man of the C@@ anning River .
&quot; an attempt by a man of Per@@ th to hang out the police was un@@ successful when he was in shallow and sw@@ amp@@ y water , only a few meters away from a police officer who tried to persu@@ ade him to return to the shore . &quot;
the police of C@@ anning V@@ ale was called in Beck@@ en@@ ham on Tuesday .
&quot; when they discovered the susp@@ ect , he tried to escape to C@@ anning River . &quot;
but he did not come too far .
&quot; he stood in water and said &apos; I &apos;m not coming out , come and get me , &quot; &quot; said senior Serge@@ ant S@@ hand@@ ell Cast@@ led@@ ine . &quot;
&quot; Con@@ stable Lach@@ lan Per@@ n@@ c was not too enthusiastic about making his uniform wet , so he turned a more reliable tac@@ tic - &quot; A good polic@@ eman is negoti@@ ating . &quot;
&quot; sometimes people do funny things to try to escape , &quot; &quot; said senior Serge@@ ant Cast@@ led@@ ine . &quot;
soccer player Ben C@@ ous@@ ins offers an unforgettable example .
in 2006 C@@ ous@@ ins drove his car into the dit@@ ch to escape a alcohol control and then tried to swim over the S@@ wan River .
&quot; his efforts were un@@ successful , but inspired locals to the hum@@ orous planning of a Ben C@@ ous@@ ins bi@@ athlon . &quot;
Peter Moo@@ dy claims that ste@@ wards tried to spy on him and threat@@ ens to finish racing
Peter Moo@@ dy claims that ste@@ wards from Racing Victoria tried to install a spy in his st@@ ables last year and threatened to finish the race immediately .
&quot; he insi@@ sted on the ste@@ wards and the integrity department of Racing Victoria , claim@@ ing that she had a personal campaign against him with the L@@ ate S@@ cr@@ at@@ ching of Lady Tat@@ ai , due to a race day treatment , the last straw on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; Moo@@ dy said Fair@@ fax Media , that he always tried to do what is best for racing and he found himself under difficult conditions when it was about the positive cob@@ alt t@@ up sample at Li@@ dar@@ is , which he cannot explain . &quot;
&quot; he had kept back for 18 months because of the es@@ pion@@ age alleg@@ ations , and did not want it to look like too high hanging grapes . &quot;
&quot; I had nothing to say about it , and I &apos;ve been eating for a long time , but sometimes you are so frustr@@ ated that everything comes out at once , &quot; &quot; said Moo@@ dy . &quot;
they know that it went on .
sometimes you react and you have to live with the consequences and I have to live with what I said .
I will go home tonight and sleep well .
&quot; I want to go up@@ stairs , and I want my owners to think that I am trying to do my best for them . &quot;
&quot; if they start thinking , I don &apos;t do that , then I should not be a trainer . &quot;
I have to think about what I do with my license .
Moo@@ dy had previously made the bomb in an interview with rac@@ ing.com that the integrity department tried to spy on his stable .
&quot; eighte@@ en months ago Ter@@ ry Bail@@ ey , Day@@ le Brown and Dr. Brian Ste@@ wart were sitting in a room with a man - whom I &apos;m going to call - and offered him a job in my st@@ ables to provide information about what I &apos;m doing inside my st@@ ables , &quot; &quot; said Moo@@ dy on rac@@ ing.com . &quot;
they seem to believe that I am a dec@@ ei@@ ver .
&quot; if that is the case , they should certainly touch their n@@ oses , because they have failed to grasp me . &quot;
&quot; Robert Rou@@ l@@ ston , Chairman of the RV@@ L , David Moo@@ dy , President of Route L and Bernard Sa@@ undry , current CEO of RV@@ L , were aware of this at the time and are still today . &quot;
should this happen to me that it will be personal ?
did the RV@@ L behave like fei@@ ting and maybe people outside trainers are responsible for what &apos;s going on in the industry ?
am I bad for the industry ?
am I so bad for the industry ?
maybe people think outside that I am .
&quot; perhaps they have to take my license and viol@@ ate me , and I have no doubt that what I say they can now think about it . &quot;
&quot; but I have arrived at the point where that doesn &apos;t matter , and that makes me sad . &quot;
that makes me really sad .
I will exercise pressure on them and urge them to make a decision .
I have the support of my family and I can go .
&quot; the trainer &apos;s fru@@ stration levels have set up with the long @-@ lasting cob@@ alt examination at Li@@ dar@@ i , and the L@@ ate S@@ cr@@ at@@ ching conducted that he could cast his license over the table . &quot;
&quot; Moo@@ dy , best known for his preparation of the un@@ beaten track Black Vodka , described the rac@@ et@@ day treatment rule &quot; ridi@@ culous , &quot; after a pack of mud or clay was applied to the horse debate , which viol@@ ated the rules . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is against the rules of racing . &quot;
&quot; I have to take full responsibility for it , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; one of my colleagues has mistakenly applied mud to the leg .
it could have been so last night .
it could have been the whole day that was so .
but it also had so on the race day .
Moo@@ dy could be confronted with a three @-@ month dis@@ qualification for the treatment with the pack on the race day . an investigation of this matter was opened .
it is a joke .
people who set up these rules do not know about the horse .
&quot; we all see that we need rules , but here you have gone too far , &quot; &quot; said Moo@@ dy . &quot;
man according to driver acc@@ urs@@ ed
&quot; at the weekend , the police arrested a man after a clas@@ h with a cycl@@ ist and driver acc@@ urs@@ ed in Cob@@ ram . &quot;
the cycl@@ ist was delivered with the helicop@@ ter to the Royal Melbourne Hospital with serious injuries after being hit by a car on Saturday morning on the Murray @-@ Valley motorway .
the police said the driver continued driving without stopping to help the injured driver .
&quot; on Monday , a 50 year old man from Nath@@ alia presented himself to the police in Sh@@ ep@@ part@@ on . &quot;
he is expected to be charged for driver acc@@ urs@@ or and subordin@@ ated assistance and other traffic del@@ ik@@ es .

Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Cra@@ ig Bell@@ amy beats Riv@@ alen for claims about Ring@@ krieg
Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Cra@@ ig Bell@@ amy has critic@@ ised the tac@@ kling of his players as &quot; Agenda @-@ Set@@ ting &quot; by two Premier League favor@@ ites of the N@@ RL .
Sydney Roo@@ sters Trainer Tr@@ ent Robinson said that the arbitr@@ ators gave the Storm players &quot; ring struggles &quot; with his team during the high Storm victory in Sydney on Friday evening .
Bris@@ bane Bron@@ cos Trainer Way@@ ne Benn@@ ett made a scar@@ c@@ ely note to the Storm team after his team had achieved the final victory against North Que@@ ens@@ land Cow@@ boys on Saturday night . he called the game a &quot; sample example &quot; of the rug@@ by League and said that the two from Que@@ ens@@ land were not too good in rings .
&quot; Bell@@ amy defended the fli@@ ck@@ fire of his team and said , that they were concentr@@ ating only on their &quot; contact &quot; at the tac@@ kling . &quot;
&quot; Bell@@ amy added that the criticism of two leading trainers in his team makes him confident , because it was worried that they were worried to be sm@@ itten by the Storm team . &quot;
&quot; it always appears - I haven &apos;t heard that Tr@@ ent Robinson spoke about ring struggles when they hit us 24 : 2 , &quot; &quot; said Bell@@ amy on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; I can guarantee that we have not changed anything about our defensive system or techniques throughout the year . but over the past six weeks we have made our contact with Tac@@ kles a real main focus , and this has provided us the turn@@ around for us . &quot;
&quot; Tr@@ ent has been there for three years now , and obviously he has a great team to train . he is probably not acc@@ u@@ stom@@ ed to losing it , so it was a bit a shock for him . &quot;
&quot; it is already funny , as this always appears at this time of the year . &quot;
Bell@@ amy has attacked Benn@@ etts idea of &quot; exciting football &quot; and reminds his ment@@ or that Benn@@ etts St George Il@@ la@@ war@@ ra Dragons won the Premier League in 2010 with &quot; boring &quot; football .
Way@@ ne speaks of exciting football .
&quot; he compared his game on Saturday evening with our Friday evening and how exciting their game was , &quot; &quot; said Bell@@ amy . &quot;
&quot; I remember that in 2010 St George was critic@@ ised as a boring team , and Way@@ ne said he will take care of a shooting . &quot;
&quot; but now he has a team that can play and which we see as exciting , especially his young players with their speed . &quot;
this is the ball game you want to play when you have this type of players .
&quot; he made this statement in 2010 , now he wants to play all his kind of football - not every team has two players such as Anthony Mil@@ ford and Ben Hun@@ t , so they can play like these . &quot;
&quot; I build stronger confidence because they say these things , because they are a bit worried about playing against us . &quot;
&quot; six weeks ago , they did not think of us when it was about the Big Games . &quot;
Bell@@ amy also pointed out that the game Storm versus Roo@@ sters achieved a higher result than the game bron@@ cos against cow@@ boys .
&quot; the game of the Bron@@ cos was probably a good game , I haven &apos;t seen it yet , but what was the result ? 16 : 12 ? &quot;
&quot; our game was 20 : 18 , there were two more trials in our game , but is that an exciting game ? &quot;
or are breaks down and do not have any points any ten@@ sion@@ ing ?
for me it is the game plans .
&quot; when they mention us , it means we will meet them in one phase . &quot;
&quot; the Storm team is free on this weekend , as they won the right to receive either North Que@@ ens@@ land Cow@@ boys or the C@@ ron@@ ul@@ la Shar@@ ks on the next Saturday night in the A@@ AM@@ I Park . ticket sales begin next Tuesday morning . &quot;
&quot; beer with 200,000 $ De@@ posit to drug ad@@ diction &quot;
&quot; a man who may possibly have a li@@ fel@@ ong penalty for his attempt to get into possession of 40 kil@@ ograms of co@@ ca@@ ine , smu@@ g@@ gl@@ ed to Que@@ ens@@ land , was released against a deposit of 200,000 $ . &quot;
&quot; Mark@@ o Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c , 29 , was one of the five men who were arrested last month after the federal police found 100 kil@@ os of the drug on the yacht Sol@@ ay that came from South America over Van@@ u@@ atu and in August in Co@@ om@@ era . &quot;
Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c was watching how he met his co @-@ def@@ endants in the J@@ ach@@ th@@ afen during the morning and later in the Café Co@@ om@@ era Road@@ house where the police found 40 kil@@ ograms of the drug in a Toyota Echo .
&quot; despite a potentially life sentence for trying to possess a commercial amount of co@@ ca@@ ine , the lawyer of Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c argued that there was no evidence that he tried to possess the whole amount and that in the café could have been out of a harmless cause . &quot;
&quot; the judge at the Supreme Court , Peter Flan@@ agan , was concerned about the danger of escape from Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c . &quot;
he has clear relations with Serbia .
&quot; he often travels to Serbia , &quot; he declared the court on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; in the case of the criminal case , he lied to the police about his residence . &quot;
&quot; Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ cs mother and step@@ father had offered a deposit of 200,000 dollars as safety together to reach his release . &quot;
&quot; after reading the aff@@ ection@@ able declar@@ ations of the two people , it is clear that the edition of a security of 200.000 dollars is a real financial burden , &quot; &quot; said Ju@@ dge Flan@@ agan . &quot;
&quot; but that alone will not suff@@ ice to prevent him from appearing , he warned . &quot;
&quot; Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c was released on the deposit , under the conditions that he gives his Australian and Serbian passport , reported daily at the police and stops at a cur@@ few of 18 : 00 @-@ 06 : 00 . &quot;
accident on A5 near Karlsruhe : driver &apos;s house apart
&quot; at a rear end with three lor@@ ries on the Autobahn 5 near Karlsruhe , a truck driver was severely injured on Tuesday evening . &quot;
two of the three trucks involved had bra@@ ked in front of a permanent building in the direction of Basel .
&quot; the third driver noticed it too late , trying to avoid spending the last moment to the left , as the police ha@@ sten@@ ed . &quot;
the driver &apos;s cab of the accident @-@ bearing plan is completely apart .
the driver was severely injured in a hospital .
the A5 between Bru@@ chs@@ al and Karlsruhe @-@ Nord was completely blocked over six hours until 2 o &apos;clock .
&quot; there was a damage in the amount of € 12@@ 2,000 . &quot;
St@@ ev@@ an H@@ og@@ g used telephone of girls to attract P@@ äd@@ oph@@ ile to send pictures
a P@@ äd@@ op@@ hil@@ er used the phone of a 11 year old girl to request pictures of child abuse .
&quot; St@@ ev@@ an H@@ og@@ g took the phone of the girl , when this slept , got into an online mess@@ aging service , from which he received a number of un@@ related images of children who were sent to him by another user . &quot;
the girl wo@@ ke up later and discovered that the phone was missing and found it in the hand of the sleeping dog .
&quot; she saw it , found the conf@@ using messages and immediately aler@@ ted her mother . &quot;
&quot; the police took care of it and looked at the five images , then analyzed computers that were found under the address and discovered &quot; &quot; Web @-@ resear@@ ches &quot; , &quot; which used terms for the search for non @-@ permanent images of children . &quot;
&quot; H@@ og@@ g then asser@@ ted the officials that he did it , as it would lead to &quot; P@@ äd@@ oph@@ ile on the Internet &quot; and he then &quot; pre@@ tended to be a polic@@ eman to fri@@ ghten them . &quot;
&quot; the prosec@@ utor E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Rober@@ ts@@ on told the Dun@@ dee Sh@@ eri@@ ff Court : &quot; he said it would be a ad@@ diction , that it is ad@@ dic@@ tive to fri@@ ghten people . &quot;
&quot; he admitted that the searches on the computer were carried out by him , but said it was done because he wanted to be a polic@@ eman to sc@@ are p@@ est . &quot;
he was asked for his talks with the unknown person who sent him the pictures and he asked to send even more photos .
he said he did it to l@@ ure her .
&quot; he said he was sick in his head , when he drinks , and said he wants to see images of rape and murder . &quot;
&quot; MS Rober@@ ts@@ on added : &quot; when the girl found the news on the phone , she called her mother and was on trem@@ bling and crying . &quot;
she then saw the im@@ permanent pictures on the phone and confronted the def@@ endants with it .
the girl was inter@@ viewed and said that the accused computers and play@@ station used to talk to girls who looked much younger than he .
&quot; H@@ og@@ g , 23 , W@@ ard Road , Dun@@ dee , ple@@ aded guilty in the sense of the indictment , to have received non @-@ permanent pictures of children on 14 June last year , and not before the court issued a hearing on 24 March of this year . &quot;
Gregory S@@ im asked that H@@ og@@ g did not appear in the Register of sexual crimes because one could argue that &quot; no significant sexual element &quot; could be found in his crime .
Sh@@ eri@@ ff Ali@@ st@@ air Car@@ mi@@ ch@@ ael disc@@ usses the verdi@@ ct until October to obtain background reports on social work .
&quot; H@@ og@@ g was granted a deposit in this case , but was held in custo@@ dy for hear@@ ings to other pending cases . &quot;
he was still taken before the date of the judgment into the list of sexual offen@@ ders .
Schle@@ user switches to Germany on small border cross@@ ings
more and more refugees are taken away from the major control points on the German @-@ Austrian border .
many smu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers caused fear of discovery and arrest the people multip@@ ly at smaller border cross@@ ings
&quot; on the Austrian side , a spokes@@ man of the Federal Police said . &quot;
&quot; along the river river Inn in Pass@@ au and Rot@@ tal @-@ Inn , more than 1000 refugees were picked up in the districts of Pass@@ au and Rot@@ tal @-@ Inn . &quot;
they had come to the German side by foot on bridges and air@@ guns .
there they are taken into reception by Federal Police and for@@ warded to registration .
&quot; at Munich &apos;s main train station , more and more refugees arrived at the Federal Police Office in comparison with the start of the week on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; only until 8@@ am , some 700 people arrived in the state capital , said a spokes@@ man in the morning . &quot;
&quot; after the re @-@ establishment of controls on the German @-@ Austrian border , the city reached the city on Tuesday 17@@ 59 . &quot;
Stuttgart : er@@ un@@ ner of Trop@@ enst@@ ur@@ m &quot; Henry &quot; in the Sou@@ thwest expects
meteor@@ ologists warn against assault rif@@ les in the southwest of Wednesday afternoon .
&quot; due to a low pressure area over Western Europe , hot sea air currently flows into the country , distributed the German weather service ( D@@ WD ) in Stuttgart . &quot;
&quot; the vigor@@ ous Deep is the footh@@ ills of the tropical storm &quot; Henry , &quot; which was drawn from the Bermuda Islands over the Atlantic in the past few days . &quot;
storms and storms are mainly expected in Baden .
&quot; according to D@@ WD , it is still in the Black Forest until Thursday , on the Sw@@ ab@@ ian Al@@ b and in the Lake Con@@ stance with Bö@@ en from 60 to 90 km of hour . &quot;
&quot; on Friday , the sun can be seen again longer . &quot;
the mass makes it : every two years the motor@@ bikes show their novel@@ ties at the I@@ AA .
&quot; in 2015 , it is mainly a movement among the compact cars that are currently especially well @-@ selling . &quot;
&quot; cars from the compact class are currently in demand : around 28.@@ 1 percent of new registr@@ ations , according to the German Federal Statistical Office ( KBA ) , fell on this segment alone in August alone . &quot;
this is also reflected at the I@@ AA ( public days 17 to 27 September ) .
&quot; between all the fut@@ uris@@ tic concept cars and new luxury cars , many new compact models will be introduced this year . &quot;
&quot; one of the biggest premier@@ es for the German car industry is the Opel Astra , which will be available to dealers in autumn . &quot;
&quot; the Astra is an extremely important model for us , &quot; said Opel CEO Karl @-@ Thomas Neumann at the fair . &quot;
it belongs to the core of the brand .
&quot; in order for the volume model to be sold well , the new Astra is not to be much more expensive . &quot;
Opel offers a entry below the biggest competi@@ tor VW Golf in a view that starts at 17 650 euros .
the current Astra costs from 16 990 euros .
the Astra is equipped with a new 1.4 @-@ liter engine with 74 kW / 100 hp .
&quot; in addition , the H@@ esse offer further diesel and gasoline engines of 70 kW / 95 hp to 147 kW / / 200 hp , for which three @-@ cylinder petrol engines are for the first time . &quot;
&quot; unlike the most important competitors VW Golf and Ford Focus , the Opel Astra is initially only five @-@ door . &quot;
&quot; the second variant will follow in the spring of the comb@@ i station , which is also visible at the I@@ AA . &quot;
and what will be added next to the Astra at the I@@ AA on new compact cars ?
Renault Mé@@ gan@@ e : Renault sends the fourth generation of its Astra competi@@ tor Mé@@ gan@@ e into the race .
&quot; at the fair , the Mé@@ gan@@ e is exclusively used as a five @-@ door in a conventional and an acc@@ entu@@ ated sporty GT version . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of next year , it is also available as a combination . &quot;
Infin@@ iti : new in the segment is the Infin@@ iti Q@@ 30 .
the Nissan boom wants to find its position in the strongly growing segment with the new model .
&quot; the compact Infin@@ iti , with its curved lines , adap@@ ts to the design line of the brand . &quot;
the basic model will get a gasoline engine with an output of at least 90 kW / 122 hp .
the offer is also a diesel with 80 kW / 109 hp or 125 kW / 170 hp .
&quot; Suzuki Bal@@ eno : new in the segment is also the Suzuki Bal@@ eno , which celebrates its world premiere in Frankfurt . &quot;
&quot; the model is offered with gasoline engines , including a newly developed 1.0 liter tur@@ bom@@ ot@@ or and an output of 82 kW / 111 hp . &quot;
the maximum torque is according to manufacturer &apos;s data at 170 new@@ ton meters ( Nm ) .
sales launch of the Bal@@ eno in Europe is in spring 2016 .
DS 4 : not completely new but completely renewed is the compact class model DS 4 which is visible at the I@@ AA .
&quot; outside the designers of the noble Citro@@ ë@@ n stand , above all , laid hands on the front part : here the radiator gr@@ ille was re@@ drawn and the changed head@@ lights equipped with LED technology . &quot;
&quot; in the interior , the inf@@ ot@@ ain@@ ment system has been moderni@@ zed , the number of buttons is reduced by a touch screen and integrated for the first time Ap@@ ples Car@@ Play . &quot;
&quot; in addition , at the I@@ AA in the compact class , there are a number of re@@ visions and new variants , such as the ascending Mercedes A @-@ Class or the Peugeot 308 GT@@ I . &quot;
&quot; J@@ VA Berlin @-@ Te@@ gel : five square meters cell , are human un@@ worthy &quot;
&quot; the Federal Constitutional Court admitted to an ex @-@ prisoner of the law enforcement institution te@@ gel , which was lod@@ ged in a too small cell months for months . &quot;
&quot; because of the violation of their human dignity , prisoners are entitled to financial compensation if they are accommod@@ ated in small cells . &quot;
this decision was made by the Federal Constitutional Court in a decision issued on Wednesday .
the persons affected can even hope for money if they were locked only a few days in the confined spaces ( A@@ z . : 1 BvR 112@@ 7 / 14 ) .
&quot; in this way , an ex @-@ prisoner was successful with his constitutional complaint in Karlsruhe : he was accommod@@ ated in a single cell with approximately five square meters of floor space between June and November 2009 ; the toilet was not separated . &quot;
&quot; after that , the man , who , according to his lawyer , is now again on the loose foot , has been reloc@@ ated to a larger cell . &quot;
his official duties due to the un@@ worthy conditions of arrest against the country of Berlin failed .
&quot; however , the Constitutional Court raised the verdi@@ ct of the Berlin Chamber of App@@ eal and rejected the case for renewed examination . &quot;
they see human dignity wounded .
chamber court now decides on the amount of compensation
&quot; even if for legal reasons only a few days of imprisonment for compensation were decisive for compensation , a compensation claim was given . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , &quot; &quot; wor@@ sen@@ ing the intellectual property of the personality would be feared . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Chamber of App@@ eal must now clarify the amount of dental compensation .
&quot; in the past , the judges have often strengthened the rights of prisoners of pen@@ alties . &quot;
&quot; in April , they spoke to a prisoner of damage only in April because he was locked in a cell in the nude . &quot;
&quot; un@@ worthy is a decision from 2011 , according to the multiple occup@@ ancy of a cell without separate toilet . &quot;
&quot; in addition , on Wednesday , Karlsruhe also confirmed the Berlin Constitutional Court , which was certified by a prisoner in a parallel case in November 2009 . &quot;
the then K@@ lä@@ ger lived in a similar cell for three months between 15 and 21 hours in a similar cell as in the Karls@@ ru@@ her case .
&quot; in recent weeks , the Berlin pris@@ ons have also come into the head@@ lines due to lack of personnel . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , prisoners are always included 23 hours , the aggres@@ si@@ veness rises , even to b@@ lows it should have been due to the ten@@ se situation . &quot;
&quot; according to the Jus@@ tiz@@ press@@ est@@ elle , 21 positions in Te@@ gel are not occupied because of the young lack , 19 are to fall away in 2016 . &quot;
Angela Merkel and the refugee policy : &quot; we are creating this &quot;
the immigration of refugees is an enormous challenge - the chan@@ cell@@ or is determined to accept it .
what comes to Germany ?
&quot; some 800 000 asylum seek@@ ers will come to Germany after proj@@ ections of the Federal Ministry of the Federal Ministry of Germany this year , according to Vice @-@ Chancellor Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) , Germany is even able to accommodate a million refugees . &quot;
German Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) demonstrated commitment in view of the unusual challenge : &quot; I say again and again : we can do that and we create that . &quot;
what comes to Germany gives the following overview .
&quot; according to a different pre@@ dictions between 35@@ 0000 ( estimate of the Federal Ministry of State ) and 400@@ ,000 ( estim@@ ation of the P@@ est@@ el Institute ) apartments each year - and for the next five years . &quot;
this is almost twice as much as it has been built ( 25@@ 0000 apartments ) .
&quot; the lack of living space is dramatic , but above all with affordable renting objects : every year 600@@ 00 to 800@@ 00 social apartments are out of the rental price and in order to apply these particularly convenient apartments , refugees will also apply . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , Federal Minister Barbara Hend@@ ri@@ cks ( SPD ) aims to double the funding from currently 518 million to one billion euros . &quot;
&quot; much too little is that from the point of view of the P@@ est@@ el Institute : 80 000 social housing is to be created every year , and the federal government would have to invest CHF 6.4 billion a year . &quot;
&quot; in addition , scientists and federal ministers agree that there must also be more tax advantages for investment in housing construction . &quot;
&quot; according to estimates by the Institute for Employment Research , it is assumed that long @-@ term 55 percent of the poultry people in Germany can be employed . &quot;
&quot; however , the refugees in Germany were not systematically asked for their qualification to help them get started , Claudia Walter critic@@ ises the project manager for integration and education in the Ber@@ tel@@ smann foundation . &quot;
but it is crucial for the integration of refugees to find work in Germany .
&quot; work is the key to social contacts , for the appreciation in the society , but also for the self @-@ este@@ em of immigrants , says Mig@@ r@@ ations@@ researcher Dietrich Thr@@ ur@@ hardt . &quot;
&quot; in Germany , there has been a political turn@@ around according to the thr@@ iller : from the prohibition of labour for refugees to recognise work . &quot;
&quot; while there was an employment prohibition for asylum seek@@ ers of up to five years earlier , this was reduced to three months in November 2014 , as well as the Residen@@ z@@ pf@@ licht , the asylum seek@@ ers restricted to a residence . &quot;
&quot; in society , even because of the shortage of skilled labour , the view of the labour market has become more and more evident that refugees should be allowed to access the labour market more quickly . &quot;
a large barrier to access to the labour market are missing German skills .
&quot; until now , there is no sufficient supply of general and professional language courses . &quot;
studies also show that jobs are most often medi@@ ated by personal contacts .
&quot; for this reason , the construction of networks is based on the view of Thr@@ ur@@ hardt from the Königs@@ weg to work integration . &quot;
&quot; the Berlin school administration found that only a few escaped parents give their children to the Kit@@ as , estimated at least ten to 15 percent : &quot; for the depri@@ ved parents , it is only once important to hold the family together , &quot; says Il@@ ja Ko@@ schem@@ as , spokes@@ man for youth and family in the Berlin Senate Administration . &quot;
&quot; to convince the family of the advantages of the K@@ ita , the administration is distributed in different languages . &quot;
&quot; if the need for educ@@ ators should rise sharp@@ ly by the large number of refugees , the Berlin Senate would try to increase the training capacity - for example by allowing more skilled schools . &quot;
&quot; in the countries , students are prepared without German knowledge in welcome classes . &quot;
&quot; but they are not always taught by trained teachers and teachers , but , as in Berlin , also by teachers who have only one qualification in German as second language . &quot;
&quot; there is no shortage , says Be@@ ate St@@ offers from the Berlin school administration . &quot;
the German Studenten@@ werk estimates that about 20 per cent of the refugees in Germany want to study .
&quot; in principle , no federal state does not prohi@@ bit asylum seek@@ ers or toler@@ ated the study - the only exception was Berlin , In@@ sen@@ ator Frank H@@ enkel ( CD@@ U ) has now abandoned his attitude . &quot;
student willing refugees could be facilit@@ ated access to the university .
&quot; because refugees with a reimbur@@ sement or reimbur@@ sement receive no more services after the asylum seek@@ ers Act , if they start studying . &quot;
&quot; the latter basically does not get a b@@ af@@ ö@@ g , since it does not fall under the circle of those responsible persons . &quot;
&quot; toler@@ ated refugees had to have lived in Germany for four years to be B@@ af@@ ö@@ g , from 1 January 2016 to short@@ ened this span to 15 months . &quot;
&quot; but this financing gap must also be closed , demand Steffen Kra@@ ch , Berlin &apos;s State Secretary for Science , and the Deutsche Studenten@@ werk . &quot;
students should immediately get B@@ af@@ ö@@ g .
&quot; Islam will play a more important role in the future , as many refugees are Muslims , and for many , religion is an important part of their identity . &quot;
&quot; the state should gradually embrace the same rights as they have the churches , and the existing state @-@ church law will develop into a new state @-@ religion relationship . &quot;
&quot; it would also be important to establish an Islamic welfare association , who cares for the newcom@@ ers in a professional manner . &quot;
the rights also include duties .
&quot; thus , the representatives of Islam must agree on clear contact persons and be willing to cooperate with the state in many areas and to grant them some control options . &quot;
&quot; this also includes the willingness to act against religious fundament@@ alism , too . &quot;
&quot; the Chairman of the Central Council of Muslims , A@@ im@@ an Maz@@ ye@@ k , expressed concern on Thursday that religious conflicts could also be carried into Germany . &quot;
&quot; those who wanted to pun@@ ish such conflicts in Germany &quot; have immediately their right to abide here , in Germany , &quot; he said in Bay@@ rische Rundfunk . &quot;
he proposed to translate the Basic Law in Arabic .
&quot; in the future , integration will be much more than today a theme of the whole society . &quot;
&quot; in this way , the majority society will have to change , the reduction of discrimination and rac@@ ism will be more pressing . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Germany has - as a result of European decisions - for a decade a decade has been an anti @-@ discrimination law and a general gender equality law . &quot;
&quot; but it lear@@ ns very slowly , as the NS@@ U @-@ murder series showed , in the police and authorities systematically ignored the rac@@ ist motif . &quot;
&quot; equal opportunities for all : what migrant organisations and the interest groups of non @-@ white German have long been demanding and what international agreements , such as anti @-@ rac@@ ism prevention Germany , must become a reality in the coming years , when the country should remain peaceful and its new citizens should use their possibilities - for the benefit of all . &quot;
&quot; in general , Germany is able to medi@@ ate the far @-@ anticipated refugees in medical condition , says Dr. Ulrich Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery . &quot;
&quot; as for some power and capacities , we create that , &quot; he said to the Tages@@ spiegel . &quot;
&quot; however , additional money needed to flow into the system . &quot;
&quot; in order to avoid bott@@ len@@ ecks , Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery expects to susp@@ end all newcom@@ ers at the registration of health cards . &quot;
the services rendered could later be rep@@ uted with the federal states .
&quot; in the long term , it is highly question@@ able to save as many people with the limited edition of services that the asylum seek@@ ers act . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , the doctors make the language barriers . &quot;
&quot; so far , the Berlin health scientist The@@ a Bor@@ de has proven that migrants are informed of their diseases worse than other patients . &quot;
&quot; not only in clinics , even in medical practices , interpre@@ ting costs would have to be taken over . &quot;
&quot; however , many refugees were also helped with more general medical conditions in emergency ambul@@ ances . &quot;
and with another diagnostic view .
&quot; among the refugee channels , there is clearly more untreated disability , and with the young people it is about HIV awareness . &quot;
&quot; but with some other diseases , German doctors come from their training but clearly , Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery believes . &quot;
&quot; paras@@ ite inf@@ estation or tu@@ ber@@ cu@@ lo@@ sis is not so difficult to detect . &quot; and as for the health care level , the refugees may even be reli@@ eved in sight . &quot;
&quot; the Syri@@ ans would have a highly developed education system , several refugees are even doctors . &quot;
&quot; in order to practice cultivation , however , they would have to prove their qualifications and possibly ex@@ ert ex@@ ams . &quot;
&quot; at least half of the refugees coming in Germany are psych@@ ically ill according to estimates of the Federal Psych@@ otherap@@ ist Chamber ( B@@ P@@ t@@ K ) , most of them suffer from a post @-@ traumatic stress disorder or depression . &quot;
&quot; especially vulnerable are refugee children , explains Dietrich Mun@@ z , President of the B@@ P@@ t@@ K . &quot;
a recently published study at TU München proves that every fifth Syrian refugee problem is trau@@ mati@@ zed in Germany .
&quot; who is suffering from a post @-@ traumatic stress disorder , among other things suff@@ ers from so @-@ called Flash@@ backs with difficulty , di@@ zz@@ iness , heart rate and death . &quot;
&quot; further symptoms are sleeping and concentration distur@@ bances , severe fri@@ ght and emotional num@@ b@@ ness . &quot;
&quot; to prevent the symptoms chronic , an early treatment is necessary , explained Mun@@ z . &quot;
&quot; however , only four percent of the psych@@ ologically ill refugees receive psych@@ otherapy . &quot;
&quot; ad@@ mitt@@ edly , mentally ill seeking asylum seek@@ ers in the social @-@ offices can place an application for psych@@ otherapy , but usually the processing takes several months . &quot;
&quot; in addition , specialists or doctors , who are not trained for mental illnesses , would decide whether a therapy is necessary or not . &quot;
&quot; this often lead to mis@@ calculations , says Mun@@ z . &quot;
Man@@ ege invites you to dream
&quot; with the new &quot; &quot; passion &quot; &quot; stage , Circus Pro@@ bst looks back on the traditions of cir@@ cus arts . &quot;
&quot; the goal is to attract any age group in the spell of fascinating ac@@ rob@@ atics , animal dres@@ sage and unique entertainment . &quot;
&quot; now , the Circus Krone in the arena will invite you to dream . &quot;
&quot; our passion is cir@@ cus . &quot;
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine living without my cir@@ cus family , &quot; &quot; says Steph@@ anie Pro@@ bst , Tier@@ Instruc@@ tor and Juni@@ or@@ ch@@ ef@@ in . &quot;
&quot; passion &quot; - under this motto is the current man@@ ure stage .
&quot; for more than 33 years , the cir@@ cus is in the hands of the Pro@@ bst family . &quot;
&quot; thus , the family is in the blood . &quot;
&quot; it is important to us to take away the people from their everyday lives and take them into a completely different world for two hours , &quot; empha@@ sizes the 27 @-@ year @-@ old Juni@@ or@@ ch@@ ef@@ in . &quot;
&quot; Man@@ eg@@ enco@@ ck@@ tails with world city flair , &quot; says director Reinhard Pro@@ bst his concept . &quot;
50 cities on the almost 3 000 kilometer long tour can now experience this flair .
the cir@@ cus program impres@@ ses with talented artists from around the world .
&quot; awarded with the international cir@@ cus festival in Monte Carlo , Russian St@@ oli@@ ar@@ ov C@@ low@@ n Family moves the audience with w@@ it and charm in her spell . &quot;
the Castillo Brothers also understand their craft .
&quot; with the heroes of the silent movies , the Cub@@ an duo wants to loose . &quot;
light@@ ness and ag@@ ility - with these words they identify themselves .
her hum@@ orous art at the mast is meant to take women &apos;s hearts in the storm .
&quot; besides numerous salmon sal@@ ts , the ac@@ rob@@ atics of Circus Pro@@ bst also fascin@@ ates with finger@@ tips and joint . &quot;
balancing with the un@@ ic@@ ycle on a ball ?
for He Yuan is not a problem .
snake @-@ man fascin@@ ate and terri@@ fies at the same time .
W@@ ang L@@ in from China is familiar with the oldest form of ac@@ rob@@ atics like little others and fascinated with their mobility .
60 employees from twelve nations offer variety in every respect .
&quot; the animals belong to our family , &quot; says Steph@@ an@@ ies Mutter , Brigitte Pro@@ bst . &quot;
gri@@ ev@@ ances in the position of cir@@ cus animals are only too often the subject of various animal welfare organisations .
&quot; Steph@@ anie Pro@@ bst also takes a position : &quot; &quot; it is not good for our animals , it doesn &apos;t work well . &quot;
around 80 animals from five different continents enjoy each string unit .
&quot; the &quot; four @-@ leg@@ ged arti@@ stes , &quot; as they are lov@@ ingly called , will be read by the eyes every wish . &quot;
we want to work with the animals and have fun with them .
&quot; if the animal does not feel well , it doesn &apos;t want to go into the arena . &quot;
so the first commandment : good for the animals .
&quot; especially on her zeb@@ roid Jum@@ bo , a mixture of a Sh@@ et@@ land P@@ ony@@ h@@ eng@@ st and a zeb@@ ra@@ stu@@ te , the Pro@@ bst family is proud . &quot;
the two animals lived together for eight years in an enclosure and nothing happened .
&quot; but then , suddenly , our little jum@@ bo was there , &quot; says Brigitte Pro@@ bst . &quot;
&quot; the zeb@@ roid is not ready for the arena , but it is the unique mas@@ cot of Circus Pro@@ bst . &quot;
so there should be something for every visitor .
&quot; one thing is certain , &quot; says Steph@@ anie Pro@@ bst : &quot; no matter if five or 1 200 spect@@ ator , we always give our best and are with all my heart . &quot;
&quot; the Circus Pro@@ bst invites every day from September 17 to 20 , daily at 5 p.m. and 8 p.m. &quot;
on Sunday the program begins at 11 a.m. and 4 p.m .
&quot; Thursday is a family day , for the performance at 5 o &apos;clock the prices are reduced . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the animal show is open every day from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. &quot;
Sim@@ bab@@ we@@ es Robert Mu@@ gabe provides false speech in parliament
&quot; Mr Mu@@ gabe , Africa &apos;s oldest leader , dropped down the stairs at the beginning of the year . &quot;
&quot; he remained un@@ har@@ med , but the video of the case spread quickly over the social media . &quot;
&quot; the opening of the Parliament was also clou@@ ded by alleg@@ ations of members of the opposition , that they had received anonymous death threats and warned them to accompany Mr Mu@@ gabe &apos;s speech with Bu@@ hr@@ u@@ fen . &quot;
&quot; last month , they had booked him , and during his speech to the situation of the nation in parliament , this is the speech which he repeated on Tuesday . &quot;
spokes@@ man on the Movement for Democratic Change ( Movement for Democratic Change - M@@ DC ) In@@ no@@ cent Gon@@ ese said that seven opposition politicians have received SMS messages on their mobile phones that warned them to distur@@ b Mr. Mu@@ gabe &apos;s speech .
&quot; the message comes from a number that is not shown , but it has the title &apos; death &apos; , he said journalists after Mu@@ gabe &apos;s speech . &quot;
&quot; it war@@ ns the Parliament members that the immun@@ ity in parliament ends , and once they leave the Parliament , their parliamentary immun@@ ity is no longer effective . &quot;
the chief spokes@@ person said that the party led by Morgan T@@ sv@@ angi@@ ra@@ i is &quot; worried &quot; about the dangers for politicians .
Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard up to 30.000 jobs
Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard is expected to set up 25.000 to 30.000 jobs within the framework of restructuring and savings efforts in the company &apos;s services .
&quot; later this year , HP will split into two listed companies and separate the computer and printer business from its fast growing company hardware and service business activities . &quot;
&quot; the expected loss of parking leads to a burden of over 2.7 billion dollars from the fourth quarter , said HP in an explanation . &quot;
&quot; these restructuring measures will enable a more competitive , more sustainable cost structure for the new Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard @-@ Enterprise , &quot; said Me@@ g Whit@@ man , HP Chairman and Chief Executive , who is to lead the unit after separation . &quot;
Hew@@ lett Packard Enterprise will be smaller and more focused than HP today and we have a broad and deep@@ ened portfolio of businesses that support companies in transition to a new style of business . &quot;
&quot; as an independent company , we are better positioned than ever before to satisfy the changing needs of our customers around the world . &quot;
Hew@@ lett Packard Enterprise has more than 50 billion $ annual revenue and will be focused on providing so far @-@ reaching and integrated technology solutions for companies such as an explanation of the company .
&quot; it spl@@ its a company that was founded in the 19@@ 30s by the graduates of Stan@@ ford University Bill Hew@@ lett and Dave Packard in order to produce electro @-@ systems and whose Pal@@ o Alto garage was called &quot; &quot; the birth@@ place of Silicon Valley . &quot; &quot; &quot;
HP has under@@ gone massive restructuring to tackle the conversion of traditional PCs to mobile devices .
&quot; the measure of HP , the world &apos;s second largest PC manufacturer and one of the largest U.S. tech companies , is the latest in this field based on the belief that closely focused companies produce a better performance . &quot;
FC Arsen@@ al @-@ Captain Mik@@ el Art@@ eta says that team @-@ mates in front of the game against Dynam@@ o Zagreb have to stand behind the injured Jack Wil@@ sh@@ ere
&quot; Wen@@ ger emphas@@ ised Wil@@ sh@@ ere that it is only September and if his rehabilitation proceeds according to plan , there is no reason why he can &apos;t play before Christmas again . &quot;
&quot; this optim@@ istic scenario already means that Wil@@ sh@@ ere will certainly miss at least the next four games for England , and in view of its history , its participation in the next summer is still uncertain . &quot;
the big shame on this current problem is that Wil@@ sh@@ ere had ended the last season after a separate ank@@ le injury and then returned to his old swing during the pres@@ e@@ ason .
&quot; this kind of injury is not threatening the career , &quot; Wen@@ ger said . &quot;
it is a bone that does not heal well .
this is not a major issue .
this was just an accident .
it was not in connection with his an@@ kles or with the injuries he had before .
&quot; this may be true from purely medical point of view , but as Wen@@ ger also recognized , there is the associated risk of further injuries , whenever a player tries to return in the middle of the season . &quot;
it also develops an unpleasant pattern .
the investigation of Prime Minister In@@ j@@ uries Ltd records 23 different diseases of Wil@@ sh@@ ere since his debut six years ago .
he also played in just 65 of Arsen@@ als 157 Lig@@ asp@@ iel@@ en in the last five seasons .
&quot; the wider picture for Arsen@@ al is that they have been one of the two Premier League clubs in six of eight seasons since 2007 / 08 , which have the most vulnerable days . &quot;
&quot; Wen@@ ger accepts the potential of a vi@@ cious circle , but ar@@ sen@@ al believes that an improvement will last during the last season . &quot;
&quot; sometimes when you come back from an injury , you have a pr@@ one time period , a time when you have to strengthen your body and win combat strength , &quot; Wen@@ ger said . &quot;
Jack is young enough to overcome that .
&quot; I hope his body stabili@@ zes , I am confident that he will do it and he will run a career of the way he deserves . &quot;
&quot; Arsen@@ al starts its Champions League season on Wednesday evening against Din@@ amo Zagreb , before playing against Chelsea on Saturday and against Tot@@ ten@@ ham Hot@@ spur next Wednesday , and Wen@@ ger presents a rotation within the team . &quot;
&quot; H@@ é@@ ctor Bell@@ er@@ ín and Aaron Ram@@ sey have not travelled to Croatia , meaning Math@@ ie@@ u Deb@@ u@@ chy and Art@@ eta are likely to start . &quot;
Wen@@ ger can also begin with K@@ ier@@ an Gib@@ bs and Olivier Gi@@ rou@@ d instead of Nach@@ o Mon@@ real and Theo Wal@@ cot@@ t .
&quot; I try to keep the balance and the players who need it to give a little break @-@ off , &quot; Wen@@ ger said . &quot;
&quot; although Arsen@@ al &apos;s clear favor@@ ites are to go ahead by group F , the Mak@@ si@@ mir stadium in Zagreb belongs to the play@@ grounds with the biggest inti@@ mid@@ ation effect in Europe . &quot;
&quot; Dynam@@ o is also unbe@@ aten after 41 games , after the &quot; inv@@ inci@@ ble &quot; campaign was launched during the last season . &quot;
the stadium was sha@@ ken by an earthquake on Tuesday evening and 3.2 were measured on the Richter scale .
this year it was the 10th in Zagreb .
&quot; Wen@@ ger believes that Arsen@@ al has drawn up the lesson from the past season with the Champions League capit@@ ulation versus Monaco , and is driven by far hope to lead the association to its first Europ@@ ap@@ oc@@ al triumph . &quot;
&quot; this drive is immense , &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot;
it has never worked at Arsen@@ al .
&quot; we were very close to it in 2006 , but on the other hand I am long enough in the business to be realistic . &quot;
&quot; we are ambitious , but we are not dre@@ amer . &quot;
&quot; Friend@@ s@@ Fest : the com@@ edy show , which gave us serious lessons on male friend@@ ships &quot;
&quot; the absence of similar portra@@ y@@ als in shows is obvious , especially with regard to how the need for men to open up , now even more des@@ perate than ever before is how suicide rates among young men prove to a 15 @-@ year high . &quot;
&quot; in 2013 , it was the most important cause of death among men aged 20 to 45 in Great Britain , and it remains three times more common in men than women . &quot;
&quot; in an effort to address the problem , the Campa@@ ign Against Living Mis@@ er@@ ably ( CAL@@ M - Campa@@ ign against a her@@ edit@@ ary life ) announced in 2015 as the year of the man with the aim of ques@@ tioning the culture that hin@@ ders men to seek help if they need them . &quot;
friendship is the heart of battle to overcome this challenge .
&quot; a recent study with more than 2,000 high school students with depres@@ sive symptoms stated that when the suff@@ erer had enough high percentage of friends with &quot; healthy mood , &quot; his chances of recovery were doubled . &quot;
&quot; for those who are not de@@ pressed , a circle of mentally healthy friends hal@@ ves the risks of mental problems . &quot;
but of course you have to have friends so that a friendship can work .
&quot; in the age of communication related to social media , with its focus on style over substance , the immedi@@ acy of the answer is often more important than a meaningful contact . &quot;
&quot; our digital life have doubled the need to appear strong , fun and successful , even though in reality the isolation domin@@ ates . &quot;
&quot; this super@@ ficial success is dominated by what psych@@ ologists call ex@@ trin@@ sic values ; money , image , social status , all at the expense of in@@ trin@@ sic values - our inner longing for personal development and friendship that affects our spiritual health much deeper . &quot;
&quot; and as a video game invent@@ or and billi@@ on@@ aire recently explained , money can really not buy . &quot;
the beauty of friends was that this focus was placed on the head .
&quot; each character was defined not by his work , but by his personality , which sh@@ ines through interaction as a friend . &quot;
&quot; the hum@@ our of Jo@@ ey and Ch@@ and@@ ler &apos;s frequent hu@@ gs , moments in soccer gu@@ cks in comfortable arm@@ chairs and the longing of Ross to Rachel - all this came from knowing that men can definitely get back to explore their feelings completely . &quot;
&quot; as a staff of teleph@@ ony care I explained to me : ... &quot; &quot; my audience role for people who feel de@@ pressed and endangered by myself , really showed me how even the smallest interactions of friends can make a difference . &quot;
the men who contact us feel often unable to talk to friends .
&quot; the old phrase &quot; I come along with it &quot; has a tremendous impact , as the feeling that it is perceived as a weakness if one speaks about problems openly . &quot;
friends is one of the shows that comes to mind when I try to offer long @-@ term cop@@ ing mechanisms .
it clearly presents the small moments of men &apos;s friend@@ ships .
&quot; so much my objective out@@ sider status over the phone might help people in moments of despair also , the long @-@ term support comes from a personal network of family and friends . &quot;
&quot; and so , if you visit this weekend com@@ edy Central Friend@@ s@@ Fest with which to celebrate the day completely re@@ designed scenery , why do not take your friends to drink in Central Per@@ k . &quot;
&quot; or , even better if you see someone sitting around in Star@@ bu@@ cks alone , give him a smile and say h@@ ello . &quot;
you never know what difference your friendship could make .
friends will be sent to Com@@ edy Central from the beginning to the end - the total 236 episodes - for # Friend@@ s@@ Fest
&quot; di Maria meets to help PSG , Malm@@ ö &quot;
angel Di Maria celebrates with Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i and Ed@@ inson Cav@@ ani after his hit against Malm@@ ö .
di Maria meets with his debut in the Champions League on Tuesday and assi@@ sts PSG to pass on Malm@@ ö .
here are the game review and the reaction to the game .
angel Di Maria and Ed@@ inson Cav@@ ani held course when Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main started his Champions League season with an extremely comfortable 2 @-@ 0 victory against Malm@@ ö in the Prin@@ zen@@ park@@ stadi@@ on on Tuesday .
&quot; less than four minutes after the start of his Champions League debut as a PSG player who brought the French master to the track , but after that they missed a number of occasions before they finally increased their lead when Cav@@ ani achieved a head @-@ ball in the 6@@ 1st minute . &quot;
&quot; with Real Madrid and chess t@@ j@@ or Don@@ et@@ sk also in group A , Paris takes a strong start against the Swedish master , as it does not only strive for the qualification of the K.@@ O. laps but an improvement on the way to the quarter fin@@ als in each of the last three campaigns . &quot;
&quot; but as they got the points , it was not a class of Laurent Blan@@ cs Team with Zlat@@ an I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ cs missed opportunities in front of the gate . he was later replaced in the game against his hom@@ etown team and against the association with which he began his illustri@@ ous career in 1999 . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s not easy to win at home or down@@ ward in the Champions League . so it &apos;s a good start to win 2 : 0 , cause our opponents to trouble and to look back , even if there are certain things that we have to perfec@@ ting over the season , &quot; said Blanc . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is a good omen . &quot;
&quot; we wanted to win and we won , although I regret that we did not have one or two other goals . &quot;
&quot; after his injury , I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c returned to the Paris team after his injury , who was able to hold a 2 : 2 Un@@ decided on his own square against Bordeaux in the First League , but he was sto@@ cked out in the fourth minute by Di Maria . &quot;
&quot; the Argent@@ ine@@ an wing storm was referred to as the man to take the PSG to the next level in Europe , when he went in the last month of Manchester United , and he pointed why , when he ran into Marco Ver@@ rat@@ tis passport behind the Malm@@ ö @-@ defense before he finished in Johan Wil@@ and over the long corner of the net . &quot;
&quot; however , if someone believed that PSG would achieve a great victory , he was disappointed . &quot;
&quot; Malm@@ ö , who hit the Celtic in a play @-@ off to reach this level , joined An@@ pi@@ ff with nine national players in the field and was armed with a five @-@ man defense and two deep in the mid@@ field . &quot;
&quot; but besides a shot by Nik@@ ola D@@ jur@@ dj@@ ic , who passed far to Kevin Tra@@ pps P@@ fo@@ sten in the 34@@ th minute , they offered little in the attack . &quot;
&quot; instead , PSG himself sometimes got up , with some mis@@ ses and bad statements , not least of I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c , who was at no less than five attempts alone in the first half and then abandoned after Cav@@ ani used it after rest@@ art@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless he proved a lot more skill when he brought his fellow players into the game , and it was a pass from I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c who turned Di Maria into a shot shot by Wil@@ and in the 5@@ 2nd minute ... &quot;
&quot; the second gate finally fell short after the hours mark thanks to Cav@@ ani . the Urugu@@ ay@@ an scored his sixth season , after I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c had caught a left flan@@ k of Max@@ well . &quot;
&quot; that ended all the thoughts that Malm@@ ö could come back to the game , and only an excellent intervention from Wil@@ and from the short@@ est distance to stop David Lu@@ iz was able to keep the end result low before replacement player Ez@@ equi@@ el Lav@@ e@@ zzi received a gate at the end . &quot;
&quot; the coach of Malm@@ ö , Age Har@@ ei@@ de , later admitted that PSG played a class over his team , and the Norweg@@ ians said : &quot; our last Champions League game was last year in December . &quot;
&quot; since then , we have played only in the Swedish league , which has not the same level . &quot;
the qualification games are not enough . &quot;
hat off in front of Paris !
it was a great game of them !
Gl@@ enc@@ ore g@@ athers 2.5 billion dollars through share sales
&quot; the mining giant Gl@@ enc@@ ore resi@@ des in Switzerland , which is affected by collap@@ sing raw materials prices , collected € 2.5 billion on Wednesday as part of its huge debt plan . &quot;
&quot; the company Gl@@ enc@@ ore registered in London , said in a statement that it sold new shares worth about $ 1.6 billion in order to pay off its own debts . &quot;
&quot; the company , which has lost 57 per cent of its market value this year , is fighting with falling commodity prices , as China &apos;s economic down@@ turn expresses demand and has a devast@@ ating effect on markets . &quot;
the issue of subscription rights brought Gl@@ en@@ cores share price during trading on the early Wednesday morning a rapid rise to the top of the London Stock Exchange .
&quot; the share j@@ umped by 2.@@ 77 percent to 13@@ 1,@@ 60 P@@ ence on the FT@@ SE 100 Index , which was 0.@@ 69 percent higher . &quot;
&quot; Gl@@ enc@@ ore had announced the 2.5 billion $ share sale last week as part of the most comprehensive plans to cut around one third of its 30 billion $ debt , announced . &quot;
&quot; the company sold the new shar@@ ehol@@ dings to 125 p@@ ence per share , which meant a 2.4 percent discount on the closing price on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; there were 1.3 billion shares worth up to 9,@@ 99 percent of the group . &quot;
&quot; concerns regarding a long @-@ term growth in China have cut iron ore prices by about half , coal , copper and other raw materials prices declined by 20 to 40 percent . &quot;
refugees arrive in Weimar
&quot; in the morning , 49 people reach the city administration in Weimar after a long run . &quot;
&quot; the refugees are from Syria , Albania , Afghanistan , Macedonia and Somalia . &quot;

the White House confirmed Xi Jin@@ ping &apos;s visit to Washington
&quot; Chinese President Xi Jin@@ ping will make a state visit to the United States at the end of the month , the White House confirmed in a statement on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; the visit , the first official in Washington , takes place on September 25 and res@@ ists President Barack Obama &apos;s journey to Beijing last November , said the statement . &quot;
&quot; the US president and the First Lady Michelle Obama will also be hosted by Xi and his wife Pen@@ g Li@@ y@@ uan , at a State D@@ iner , after the two leaders have conducted bilateral talks . &quot;
&quot; President &apos;s visit will offer the opportunity to bro@@ aden the American @-@ Chinese cooperation with a number of global , regional and bilateral issues of common interest , but at the same time President Obama and President Xi will give the possibility to construc@@ tively address areas of dis@@ agreements , &quot; adds the statement . &quot;
&quot; XI , whose visit was announced initially in February , will probably meet several U.S. technology leaders on his way to Washington before travelling to New York City to the UN General Assembly in September . &quot;
&quot; it is expected that Obama and Xi addressed a number of controversial issues , including Washington &apos;s concerns regarding alleged Cyber@@ spi@@ on@@ age China and its increasing self @-@ confidence in the controversial waters of the South China Me@@ ers . &quot;

world and European champion X@@ avi has been playing for the al @-@ S@@ add Sport Club in Qatar since summer 2015
&quot; the FC Bayern clearly stood before the commitment of Spain Super@@ star X@@ avi , who then played for FC Barcelona . &quot;
&quot; eight time Spanish champion , three times winner champion , four times champion league champion , two times champion champion , two times Europe champion , one time world champion - the title list of X@@ avi is breathtaking . &quot;
&quot; in summer , the 35 @-@ year @-@ old left FC Barcelona after 24 years and switched to the al @-@ S@@ add Sport Club to Qatar . &quot;
&quot; but in an interview with the Mar@@ ca , X@@ avi now av@@ eng@@ es that he was already in front of the F@@ arewell from Barcelona in front of the EM 2008 . &quot;
I told me that Bar@@ ça wanted to sell me .
&quot; at that time , Madrid won everything , we do nothing , &quot; he tells . &quot;
and that also registered FC Bayern .
X@@ avi : &quot; there was an offer of Bavaria . &quot;
&quot; Rum@@ men@@ ig@@ ge wanted to have me . &quot;
in the summer of 2008 Jürgen Klin@@ smann took over FC Bayern .
Guardi@@ ola was the reason that X@@ avi didn &apos;t change
but the change did not come about .
and the decisive man today is working for the German record champion : PE@@ P Guardi@@ ola .
&quot; X@@ avi explains why : &quot; &quot; Bar@@ ça has taken Guardi@@ ola under contract and I played a great European . &quot;
PE@@ P told me that I would not change that he could not imagine the crew without me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so he has gotten me . &quot; &quot; &quot;
who knows how Bay@@ erns played season 2008 / 2009 with X@@ avi .
&quot; X@@ avi was standing for Bar@@ ca in the quarter @-@ fin@@ als of the Champions League against Bayern across the entire distance on the lawn , out@@ dated the reds ( 4 : 0 , 1 : 1 ) and at the end celebrated the King &apos;s triumph . &quot;
matt Dam@@ on plays variety in film creation
matt Dam@@ on confron@@ ted the af@@ ro@@ amer@@ ican film@@ maker Eff@@ ie Brown during a discussion about diversity and said she is not needed behind the scenes .
&quot; during a series of Sunday night by H@@ B@@ OS Project Green@@ Light , the experienced actor Brown broke when they stressed the need for alternative perspectives and in relation to a black protagon@@ ist in the chosen script of the project . &quot;
&quot; if we talk about diversity , then do it at the filling of the film and not at the filling of the show , &quot; &quot; said Dam@@ on . &quot;
&quot; brown re@@ acted sho@@ cked , with insul@@ ted un@@ belief and called &quot; Ho@@ o ! wow . okay , &quot; when the actors of the act@@ ress captured by The Mar@@ tian . &quot;
Dam@@ on and Brown joined the producer colleagues Ben Aff@@ le@@ ck and the Far@@ rel@@ ly Brothers to discuss the show fin@@ alists .
&quot; I want to ask people to think about it - whoever is always the director - how to treat the figure of Harmon@@ y , &quot; Brown said at first . &quot;
&quot; the only black person , and she is a Nut@@ te , beaten by her white half . &quot;
the producer of Dear White People took place for the fin@@ alists Leo Angel@@ os and Kri@@ sten Bran@@ c@@ accio for direc@@ ting rights to the film ; Dam@@ on said that their direction &quot; at the end could give us something that we do not want .
&quot; after the discussion was broadcast , the social media explo@@ ded before dis@@ approval of Dam@@ on &apos;s comments . &quot;
&quot; Twitter users Mr Po@@ oni expressed his anger about the clip , writing &quot; Matt Dam@@ on talking about the only black person in space , so he can explain their variety - that &apos;s SO WE@@ ISS that it hur@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; the twe@@ et earned more than 5,000 Ret@@ we@@ ets and 4,000 hits since its publication . &quot;
Dam@@ on &apos;s comments come at a time when the exact racial representation in the media is at the forefront of social discussion .
&quot; after the teen@@ ager Michael Brown was killed in 2014 by a white polic@@ eman , the movement Black Li@@ ves Matter achieved country @-@ wide impact and urged legislat@@ ors and authorities to use discri@@ min@@ atory practices against colour content . &quot;
&quot; in February , the singer Prince made a reference to the movement during the introduction of the nominated albums of the year at the Gram@@ my Awards . &quot;
&quot; albums still matt , &quot; ( albums still have their meaning ) , he said . &quot;
&quot; like books and black life , albums still have their meaning . &quot;
&quot; in recent times , leaders of the Black Li@@ ves Matter movement have published an explanation in response to the question of Fox @-@ News @-@ personality Elisabeth Hassel@@ beck , whether the group should be regarded as an Hat@@ red group . &quot;
&quot; the Network Black Li@@ ves Matter is a love group , &quot; said the leaders . &quot;
&quot; recently , it was announced that Dam@@ on was on a list of enter@@ tainers , producers and media styles invited to visit the pop@@ e to discuss the depic@@ tion of the Catholic Church in the West . &quot;
whether he accepted the invitation or already met the Pope is un@@ clear .
&apos;@@ American Nin@@ ja Warrior &apos; crow@@ ned first champion
&quot; professional sports clim@@ bers and operating aid Isaac Cal@@ di@@ ero became the first ath@@ l@@ ete , who won the American Nin@@ ja Warrior on Monday evening and took home the Grand Prix of $ 1 million . &quot;
&quot; the competition show , which just completed their 7th season , had never experienced a competition participant who could complete all stages of his obstacle course . &quot;
&quot; during the season finale there were two men , Cal@@ di@@ ero and cam@@ er@@ aman Ge@@ off Brit@@ ten , to the final . &quot;
the last task was climbing on a 75 foot long climbing rope in 30 seconds .
&quot; Brit@@ ten finished the task at the time he was the first ath@@ l@@ ete , who completed the exhau@@ sting phase 4 of American Nin@@ ja Warrior . however , Cal@@ di@@ ero finished this challenge three seconds faster , which made him the winner . &quot;
&quot; Cal@@ di@@ ero spoke to E ! News after the hard @-@ fought victory , still under the shock of the winning of the Grand Prix of $ 1 million . &quot;
&quot; I mean , it &apos;s amazing to think about it , I have never earned more than $ 10,000 or had life , &quot; said Isaac E ! about his pile of money . &quot;
so suddenly ... as I can not even imagine how that is ... the future is unknown .
&quot; the leading producer K@@ ent We@@ ed sat down with The Hollywood Rep@@ orter to discuss the final and why Brit@@ ten , although he first ended the course at all , did not receive any prize money . &quot;
&quot; according to the rules , the money goes to the fastest person . &quot;
&quot; if there is more than one fin@@ alists , it gets the one with the fastest time , &quot; said We@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; how much money is a wonderful price and change life , he receives the great rati@@ fication . &quot;
I don &apos;t think he &apos;ll have a gru@@ dge about it .
he is just as happy to have done what he has done .
he received awards from fans .
he is such a great guy and a family father .
he is a hero for his children and his wife .
&quot; Ge@@ off said to me , &quot; &quot; If I should be beaten by someone , then I am glad that it is Isaac . &quot;
and I think Isaac would have felt the same if they had changed the roles .
&quot; America Nin@@ ja Warrior was extended for a eighth relay , the fil@@ ming will begin in spring 2016 . &quot;
Detroit Tig@@ ers sne@@ ak over to Minn@@ es@@ ota Tw@@ ins
MIN@@ NE@@ AP@@ OL@@ IS@@ --@@ The second half of the season was not particularly funny for the Detroit Tig@@ ers .
&quot; once they were one of the best teams in bas@@ eball , today the tig@@ ers stand in the last place in the American League Central . &quot;
&quot; the tig@@ ers are reduced to their role as spo@@ iler , but played this part perfectly against Minn@@ es@@ ota Tw@@ ins with 5 @-@ 4 in the target field on Tuesday . &quot;
the Tw@@ ins wast@@ ed a chance to climb within a half of the Houston astro@@ s for the second American League Wild@@ card .
&quot; for Detroit , if only for one evening , it was a return of the three letter F @-@ word that was so difficult to grasp over a large part of the second half of the season . &quot;
&quot; all vic@@ tories make fun , no matter how it comes , &quot; said Tig@@ ers Manager Brad Sp@@ read . &quot;
&quot; tiger @-@ Pit@@ cher Al@@ fre@@ do Simon maintained his early offensive support when Detroit scored three times in the first two quarters , then once in sixth and then once again in ninth place . &quot;
Simon ( 13 @-@ 9 ) scored six times in the 1 / 3 interior and allowed three ranks .
it was just his third successful start in his last nine games .
&quot; I want to end this year strongly , &quot; &quot; said Simon . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s hard to throw each game in the bull@@ pen , and therefore I want to concentrate entirely in the game . &quot;
&quot; the designated Tiger @-@ H@@ itter Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z had three hits and was in two ranks , his first r@@ bis since mid @-@ August . &quot;
&quot; it was the first tri@@ er hit game by Mart@@ ine@@ z , since he had four hits against Seattle Marin@@ ers on July 6th . &quot;
&quot; he has turned the drum well , &quot; &quot; Aus@@ m said . &quot;
&quot; he looked good at the ( punch training ) , saw clearly better out in the bull@@ pen , and he brought it straight into the game . &quot;
&quot; with three R@@ uns at the end of the seventh indoor meeting , the Tw@@ ins had their best chance to get back to the game . &quot;
center Fiel@@ der By@@ ron Bu@@ x@@ ton finished the inning with a double on the left field line .
&quot; right Fiel@@ der Aaron H@@ icks reached a Bun@@ t , and Simon brought his second Bas@@ eman Brian Do@@ zier to Stri@@ ke@@ out before being replaced by the left @-@ handed Bla@@ ine Har@@ dy . &quot;
&quot; Har@@ dy crossed the wall , the only man with whom he was confronted , in front of the designated ro@@ ok@@ ie drummer Miguel S@@ ano , who gave the right @-@ handed Dre@@ w Ver@@ hagen a two @-@ run escape . &quot;
&quot; with a pair of runners and the final run at the second , Ver@@ hagen brought the third Bas@@ eman Tre@@ vor Pl@@ ou@@ ffe to a double play . &quot;
it was the 27th time in the Major League this season that Pl@@ ou@@ ffe proposed a double play
&quot; after Detroit added a Insurance @-@ Run at the end of the ninth inning , the wall made a R@@ BI double against the C@@ loser of the Tiger Bruce Ron@@ don and achieved the stand of 5 @-@ 4 . &quot;
&quot; the right @-@ h@@ anders , however , st@@ ach at three Pit@@ ches for its fifth Save . &quot;
Detroit benefited to the pr@@ el@@ ude of the game from an even non @-@ mo@@ vable Phil Hu@@ gh@@ es .
the tig@@ ers scored three R@@ uns in the first two Inn@@ ings against the right @-@ handed veter@@ an who had been das@@ hed before the game from the vulner@@ ability list after missing more than one month because of a back suffering .
&quot; obviously not the beginning I wanted , &quot; Hu@@ gh@@ es said , &quot; but I felt better when I started to get started and felt that I would create some pretty good pit@@ ches in the third inning . &quot;
&quot; after receiving the Le@@ ad@@ off Bat@@ ter in the first , Hus@@ hes released a single to Second Bas@@ eman Ian Kin@@ dle . &quot;
&quot; a Two @-@ Out Walk for J@@ .D. Mart@@ ine@@ z brought Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z into the game , who created a single &quot; up the middle &quot; at the first run of the game . &quot;
Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z created his 0 @-@ 21 success story with the runners in the Scor@@ ing position .
&quot; the third Bas@@ eman Nick Castell@@ anos followed with a single on the right side , managed another run , but Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z was thrown out of the game when he tried to reach the third , which ended the threat . &quot;
the tig@@ ers placed in the second one @-@ out Double by Cat@@ cher James Mc@@ C@@ ann and a two @-@ out single from Center @-@ Fiel@@ der Anthony G@@ ose for 3 @-@ 0 .
&quot; that was a big blow , &quot; said Tw@@ ins @-@ Manager Paul Mol@@ itor . &quot;
&quot; he did not hit very well , but he caught the right place . &quot;
&quot; Hu@@ gh@@ es was in a Pit@@ ch Count , scored no points in the third inning before replacing A.@@ J.@@ A@@ chter by the reli@@ ever right @-@ handed . &quot;
at Hu@@ gh@@ es there came to three ranks with six hits and a walk with four stro@@ ke@@ outs .
remarks : Tig@@ ers R@@ HP Ani@@ bal San@@ che@@ z retired due to a violation of the throw school .
he is examined by Dr. James Andre@@ ws who operated the shoulder of San@@ che@@ z in 2007 .
&quot; San@@ che@@ z , since mid @-@ August on the vulner@@ ability list because of a shoulder control , should be activated for the start on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; with San@@ che@@ z from the game , L@@ HP Daniel Morris is removed from the list of vulner@@ abilities to start the Tw@@ ins . &quot;
Nor@@ ris with 1 @-@ 1 at four starts with the Tig@@ ers since he was bought in exchange with L@@ HP David Price on 30 July
he was missing from the right hip on the right hip on 20 August .
the tig@@ ers and the Tw@@ ins will end their series of three games in Target Field on Wednesday
&quot; Nor@@ ris ( 2 @-@ 2.@@ 4.@@ 43 ERA ) will play against Minn@@ es@@ ot@@ as R@@ HP Er@@ vin Sant@@ ana ( 5 @-@ 4 , 4.@@ 73 ) &quot;
hundreds of refugees are to be accommod@@ ated in Wiesbaden
a train with hundreds of refugees is on the way to H@@ esse .
his arrival was expected for the night on Wednesday .
&quot; the most excited people will then be accommod@@ ated in emergency shel@@ ters in Wiesbaden , such as the city of Wiesbaden on Tuesday evening . &quot;
they reck@@ oned with 450 to 750 incoming refugees .
several sports halls of the Hes@@ sian capital have been prepared for this event in recent days .
up to 1000 refugees can temporarily stop there .
they should then be distributed to other communities .
&quot; over the past ten days alone , according to the government president , G@@ ießen 7@@ 500 people had arrived in H@@ esse for the first time . &quot;
&quot; due to the large number of refugees , Frankfurt and Han@@ au have also set up emergency accommodation in sports halls . &quot;
Kyr@@ gy@@ z@@ stan : German military action an option in Syria
&quot; the head of the Munich Security Conference , Wolfgang Isch@@ inger , holds military action with German involvement in Syria for a possibility . &quot;
&quot; I believe the decisive thinking about military action options must not take place without Germany , &quot; he said . &quot;
he threw the European states &quot; collective departure . &quot;
&quot; four years ago , one was happy that the cup was passed by a military involvement in Germany . &quot;
&quot; now the conflict ends in front of our front door , &quot; he said in Deutschl@@ and@@ funk . &quot;
the former German ambassador in Washington also called for a massive increase of international aid on the spot for refugees .
Austria controls southern and eastern borders
&quot; according to Germany , Austria once again introduced controls to its southern and eastern borders . &quot;
&quot; the Austrian Minister of Interior Johanna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner stated on Tuesday evening in the Austrian television station OR@@ F , after Hungary no one will be sent back . &quot;
&quot; in Germany , too , no refugees sent back to Austria . &quot;
&quot; no , it is so agreed , &quot; &quot; she explained . &quot;
&quot; on the question of an agreement in which Germany could take up a certain number of refugees from Austria per day , Mik@@ l Leit@@ ner said that there have already been discussions between the General Director General for Public Security and representatives of Germany . &quot;
concrete figures did not call them and rejected talks on Wednesday in Berlin .
&quot; in recent days , tens of thousands of refugees have come to Austria via the so @-@ called Bal@@ kan@@ route from Hungary to Austria . &quot;
your goal is usually Germany .
Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) and her Austrian colleague Werner F@@ ay@@ mann asked for a special summit next week together with several other EU heads of state and government .
Germany had begun on Sunday with temporary border controls .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the EU states have not yet been able to agree on a joint action in the crisis . &quot;
&quot; the EU interior ministers want to take a new start to the binding distribution of further 120,000 refugees at a special meeting on Tuesday ( 22 September ) . &quot;
&quot; in view of the strong refugee disaster in Germany , the federal government wants to support countries in the first @-@ generation and distribution of people . &quot;
&quot; the federal government will manage this together with the countries , Merkel announced on the late Tuesday evening after almost four hour consult@@ ations with the Prime Minister in the Chancellor &apos;s office in Berlin . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , Merkel under@@ lined , those people who need protection , do not compl@@ ain . &quot;
&quot; but who does not have a lead perspective , could not remain in Germany . &quot;
this point of view was strongly divided in the round .
the chan@@ cell@@ or stressed that the state as a whole must now cope with a &quot; huge effort . &quot;
thousands of des@@ perate refugees are now stuck on the Bal@@ kan@@ route .
&quot; in the night of Tuesday , Hungary closed its 175 kilometres long border to Serbia . &quot;
&quot; a few hours later , the government in Budapest announced the border to Romania with a fence . &quot;
this neighbour country is different from Serbia to the EU .
&quot; Hung@@ arians wanted to prevent smu@@ g@@ gling routes across Romania , Hungary &apos;s Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to said to the planned new border fence . &quot;
the Romanian government immediately condemned the plan .
there were first ar@@ rests of people who had crossed the fence .
&quot; in Turkey , meanwhile , thousands of other migrants were reported on their way to the Greek border . &quot;

&quot; accordingly , the moon is slightly stag@@ gering on its rail around the ring planets . &quot;
&quot; although this de@@ af movement is only small , but still too large for a continuous cel@@ esti@@ al body , it is said in a message from Corn@@ ell University in I@@ th@@ aca ( New York State ) from Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; the researchers present their analyses in the &quot; &quot; I@@ car@@ us &quot; &quot; paper . &quot;
it was already known that there must be liquid water under the ice ceiling of En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us .
&quot; so &quot; Cass@@ ini &quot; had already discovered Eis@@ volcan@@ kan@@ e at the South Pole of the Satur@@ n@@ monds in 2006 , feed the water vap@@ our and ice particles , and thus feed the so @-@ called E @-@ Ring of Saturn . &quot;
&quot; at least at the south pole , there had to be an underground sea , the astronom@@ ers included then . &quot;
&quot; however , the expansion of the hidden ocean was not clear . &quot;
R@@ ama missing 1860 München several weeks
the 1860 München has to ren@@ ounce a month on the offensive actor Val@@ det R@@ ama .
&quot; a study commissioned an ad@@ duc@@ tor injury at the 27 @-@ year @-@ old , distributed by the association . &quot;
R@@ ama compl@@ ained about pain at the beginning of the week .
&quot; according to Munich , the diagnosis is expected for four weeks of forced break . &quot;
&quot; that is difficult for us , R@@ ama is a heart@@ y loss . &quot;
&quot; of course , we must now think , &quot; said Sport@@ director N@@ ec@@ at Ay@@ gü@@ n the &quot; Picture &quot; newspaper with a view of the possible commitment of un@@ compromising pro@@ s . &quot;
&quot; as a train@@ ee , the Six@@ ties initially presented a de@@ fl@@ ator . &quot;
the 30 @-@ year @-@ old Hr@@ vo@@ je C@@ ale was last active in Belgium and was already under contract with the V@@ f@@ L Wolfs@@ burg .
&quot; at present , the Cro@@ ate has the opportunity to prove his skills . &quot;
Tor@@ hunter Rubin Ok@@ ot@@ ie can return to the team &apos;s training after his bra@@ ins next week .
&quot; already on Thursday , the Austrian national player should enter running training . &quot;
Ok@@ ot@@ ie had hurt in the game at Fort@@ una Düsseldorf ( 0 : 3 ) at a violent clas@@ h in the head .
&quot; contrary to the first fears , however , he remained without a serious threat . &quot;
no diet fruit - man@@ goes contain a lot of sugar
man@@ goes are exotic and ju@@ icy @-@ sweet .
&quot; but he who wants to pay attention to his slender line , is often rather dis@@ cour@@ aged by them . &quot;
because man@@ goes contain relatively much sugar - especially su@@ c@@ rose .
&quot; the exotic fruits are healthy : in them B vitamins , as well as vitamins E and C. Before all , man@@ goes contain a lot of vitamin A and its prec@@ urs@@ or beta car@@ ot@@ ene . &quot;
&quot; who e@@ ats fruits , thus supports ten@@ acity , immune system , and metabolic processes in the body . &quot;
&quot; when you buy , man@@ goes should not be too soft or too tight and pleas@@ antly smell . &quot;
&quot; the shell color alone does not tell anything about how ripe the fruit is , so also green man@@ gos can taste delicious . &quot;
they should be stored at room temperature and are consumed within a few days .
&quot; then , of course , they taste pure or in sweet foods . &quot;
a man@@ go also gives sav@@ ory dishes a special note .

&quot; last year , U@@ PS had raised its staff for the holiday season by 95@@ 000 aid . &quot;
&quot; in view of the bo@@ oming online business , U@@ PS and its competi@@ tor Fed@@ Ex have been making previous arrangements for the Christmas business earlier this year . &quot;

&quot; according to F@@ öhn@@ ende on Thursday morning we cross a distinctive cold front , the strong ra@@ inf@@ alls , wind ar@@ ches and a temperature decline . &quot;
&quot; as Met@@ e@@ o@@ News writes in a communication , Switzerland is currently on the front of an extensive grav@@ ure area over the British Is@@ les in a strong southwest flow . &quot;
&quot; on the north side of the Alps , the cave breaks through the valleys during the night to Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; in the wake of the F@@ öh@@ n until Thursday morning , the F@@ öh@@ n b@@ lows with goats from 60 to 100 km / h , isolated and especially in the Ur@@ ner@@ land partially also with more than 100 km / h . &quot;

&quot; while in the north on Wednesday stor@@ my hair for summer temperatures of 23 to 27 degrees , the humidity starts to dust at the slope . &quot;
&quot; here &apos;s the rain , which lasts until Thursday evening . &quot;
&quot; in sum , south of the Alps must be reck@@ oned in the next 48 hours with partly over 100 liters of rain per square meter , this after the last few days have already fallen large amounts of rain . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday morning , the F@@ öh@@ n leaves the air , in the episode rolled a cold front with strong , partly hum@@ id rain from west to east via Switzerland . &quot;
&quot; together with the cold front , the wind has a strong wind up to a storm , and the temperatures drop considerably . &quot;
&quot; the following days present themselves in the north with 15 to 20 degrees , in the south on the other hand it becomes sunny and warmer at up to 25 degrees . &quot;
Rome now has a Martin @-@ Luther @-@ Platz
&quot; almost 500 years after the Reformation , there is now a Martin @-@ Luther @-@ Platz in Rome . &quot;
&quot; in the presence of Ign@@ azi@@ o Marino , a nam@@ eless place in the park on the Opp@@ io Hill was chri@@ sten@@ ed on the name of the German Re@@ former on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; at the &quot; Piazza Martin Lu@@ ter@@ o , &quot; he is now honoured as a &quot; German the@@ ologi@@ an of the Reformation . &quot; &quot;
the park is right in the middle of the ancient Rome next to the Col@@ os@@ se@@ um .
the nam@@ ing was requested by the work community of the Protestant churches in Rome .
&quot; Jens @-@ Martin Kr@@ use , Pastor of the Evangel@@ ical Lutheran Church in Rome , rec@@ alled that Protest@@ ants in the city of the Pop@@ es were able to live in the city of Pop@@ es for centuries only in secret their faith . &quot;
&quot; in a symbolic way , the place will be seen in a symbolic way that the tradition of the Christian faith in Rome is welcome . &quot;
Martin Luther ( 14@@ 83 @-@ 15@@ 46 ) considered a young August@@ inian mon@@ k about the turn of the year 15@@ 10 / 11 a few months in Rome .
he felt the city at that time as a comm@@ ited sc@@ ap@@ ego@@ at .
his negative impressions might have strengthened him in the view of historians in his later struggle against Rome .

hammer Artist spent three years in the personal interpretation of the Bible
Jesus with the ( gold @-@ plated ) Dorn@@ enk@@ rone is one of the main works that Ot@@ mar Alt has painted for his Bible .
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost has posted the introduction and updated Bible texts .
in the beginning was the Word ?
&quot; no , not at the Ot@@ mar Old Bible , which now appeared with splendid pictures . &quot;
&quot; in the beginning , the image for Ot@@ mar Alt , which in 150 motifs has formulated his very personal interpre@@ tations of biblical stories on paper and canvas . &quot;
&quot; his &quot; &quot; language &quot; &quot; with colorful colors and imagin@@ ative forms has gotten the 75 @-@ year @-@ old - which is by no means syn@@ onymous with &quot; funny &quot; pictures . &quot;
&quot; on the contrary , the respective topics can be adapted quite well . &quot;
&quot; for about three years , Ot@@ mar Alt has worked on his Bible project for which he has hit a subjective @-@ artistic selection from the many topics of the &quot; book of all books . &quot; &quot;
&quot; these are cycles that focus on topics like crus@@ hing , pl@@ agues , bi@@ ds , or fa@@ ther@@ hood . &quot;
&quot; in this way , he immediately fascinated several partners : this applies to the Luther @-@ Verlag with its the@@ ological orientation as well as for the Kettler publishers with its emphasis on art books . &quot;
&quot; and there is above all the author Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost , who has dealt with the respective Bible points based on painting . &quot;
&quot; he interpreted the Bible passages selected by Ot@@ mar Alt , and thus translated into current contex@@ ts . &quot;
these texts are like the verbal mirror of Al@@ ts painting .
&quot; they are embedded between the original Bible study of Martin Luther and a set of the artist , who formulated his own personal thoughts on the situation here . &quot;
the jewelry cord has golden letters .
&quot; thus , the 75 @-@ year @-@ old gives twice a deep insight into his soul , his emotions . &quot;
this is a high degree of intim@@ acy .
&quot; emotions were ultimately the trigger for the Bible project : Ot@@ mar Alt , born in Wer@@ ni@@ ger@@ ode in 1940 and grew up in Berlin , comes from a family that belonged to the strict prot@@ est@@ ant Herr@@ n@@ h@@ uter Or@@ ders . &quot;
&quot; since the education started already with the pipe , &quot; &quot; Oth@@ mar Alt &quot; &quot; re@@ members . &quot;
&quot; I tried to work up , perhaps to bring me back with the Lord &apos;s Father again . &quot;
&quot; his second concern is to be more important to art in a faster time : &quot; &quot; the perception of picture worlds is shaped by advertising today , and it is loud . &quot;
symbol@@ ism is displac@@ ed .
artists have a different desire and pleasure to show things .
pictures always have something mysterious and are not decorative .
&quot; in this respect , I am a din@@ osau@@ r . &quot;
&quot; Ot@@ mar Alt wants the viewer to fall into the images , letting them look at themselves , discover and feel what force they have : &quot; the image looks for his counter@@ part . &quot;
&quot; Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost was standing on Tuesday at the presentation of the Ot@@ mar Old Bible in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Stiftung , &quot; &quot; always &quot; &quot; a lover of Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts Kunst &quot; &quot; : &quot; &quot; I like how he understands life with his paintings . &quot;
&quot; I did not care to fully grasp the Bible , but also selected the mysterious themes for him . &quot;
&quot; this was not co @-@ operation at eye level , &quot; says Alt@@ ep@@ ost : &quot; here it is about the images , the text merely explains . &quot; &quot;

start of construction for BM@@ X @-@ Bahn
&quot; a year later , almost everything was done - but before the official opening of the BM@@ X @-@ Bahn it was already finished . &quot;
&quot; fail@@ ures in politics and administration ensured dr@@ um@@ ming , especially among residents who would not toler@@ ate the train . &quot;
&quot; therefore , hill dep@@ orted , new place searched - now with formal planning and application for building permit . &quot;
&quot; the approval will commen@@ ce in October , the first municipal coun@@ cill@@ or Sabine Mos@@ eb@@ ach @-@ Bo@@ ck was able to share in the children &apos;s and youth committee . &quot;
&quot; I hope that this year is still visible , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; it should then be started without &quot; &quot; further commem@@ oration &quot; &quot; with the works of the former indoor swimming pool . &quot;
DF@@ B intensi@@ fies commitment to refugees
&quot; the DF@@ B wi@@ dens its commitment to refugees to 2019 , the Bundes@@ liga will make a clear sign on the weekend . &quot;
the football respon@@ ds to the more addi@@ tive situation in Germany and ass@@ ures the policy his help in cop@@ ing with the problems pending .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I think this is the biggest challenge of our country since the re@@ unification . &quot;
&quot; in principle no one can say , that &apos;s nothing about me , I have nothing to do with it . &quot;
&quot; this must be interesting for everyone to get a grip on this subject , &quot; said DF@@ B boss Wolfgang Nier@@ sbach . &quot;
&quot; at the annual meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel on 23 September in Berlin , he wants to discuss the refugee situation in Germany intensively . &quot;
&quot; I am the chan@@ cell@@ or next Wednesday and meet the Minister of State , Mrs. Petro@@ zo@@ ğ@@ u@@ z and the chan@@ cell@@ or . &quot;
&quot; there will certainly play a central role , &quot; he announced . &quot;
the football can and wants to help .
but the decisive turn@@ out has to put politics .
&quot; the German Football Association therefore has extended its refugee initiative &quot; &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; &quot; for four years . &quot;
&quot; through the E@@ gi@@ di@@ us Braun Foundation , we have ensured that this program will continue until 2019 , &quot; &quot; declared Nier@@ sbach on the edge of the UEF@@ A meeting in St. Julian &apos;s / Malta . &quot;
some federal states also support this program .
&quot; already on this weekend , the 36 professional clubs make a clear sign , when they are on the left @-@ hand jer@@ sey instead of the usual sponsor@@ ing logo ( Her@@ mes ) the im@@ print &quot; We help - # Refu@@ ge@@ es@@ Welcome . &quot; &quot;
&quot; we also want to make clear that everyone should help wherever and how they can , &quot; said Le@@ verk@@ usen &apos;s Sports Director Ru@@ di Völ@@ ler of the &quot; Bild &quot; newspaper ( Tuesday ) and described the project as &quot; self @-@ evident . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the drama @-@ drama goes everyone , nobody can see . &quot;
&quot; we can use football Bundes@@ liga , no , we must use our bla@@ sting force , our influence and our possibilities to help the many refugees who have so incredibly s@@ led to help , &quot; &quot; said Her@@ tha @-@ Manager Michael Pre@@ etz . &quot;
H@@ offen@@ hei@@ ms Managing Director Peter Ret@@ tig spoke of a &quot; prominent sign of the league . &quot;
&quot; for the EM quali@@ fier against Hungary on this Friday , the national team of Women invites 100 refugees to Halle / Sa@@ ale . &quot;
&quot; Nier@@ sbach referred to the support of refugees as &quot; &quot; a large joint work of German football . &quot; &quot; &quot;
that all 36 license clubs in their places had started their own projects was great .
just as great is that small and smallest associations are active there .
&quot; the message &quot; &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; &quot; that we have spent will live in football . &quot;
&quot; that is of enormous importance , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; in this and next year , the Association will jointly provide 300 000 euros for the integration of refugees together with the DF@@ B selection and the Federal Government . &quot;
&quot; the clubs have already rec@@ alled the whole amount for 2015 , &quot; K@@ id@@ ney reported . &quot;
reports : SAP Executive Board lost an eye in case of accident
&quot; the Executive Board of Europe &apos;s largest software corporation , Bill Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t , report@@ edly lost the left eye by a fall in early July . &quot;
&quot; during the accident on the stairs in the house of his brother in the USA , he fell on a water glass after midnight , which he carried in the left hand , reports the &quot; Wirtschafts@@ woche &quot; on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; he is almost blood @-@ bloo@@ ded , impot@@ ent , has then drag@@ ged out on the road - that told us last week , &quot; quoted the &quot; W@@ IW@@ O &quot; SAP co @-@ founder Has@@ so Platt@@ ner . &quot;
but Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t could follow his job .
&quot; at the beginning of October we meet at the Supervisory Board meeting in Wall@@ dorf , &quot; said Platt@@ ner . &quot;
the 54 year old manager is at the meeting and &quot; fully working . &quot;
&quot; Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t announced in an interview with the &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; ( Thursday edition ) , he will come back to Germany in October and will continue with the software company . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m full of SAP , full of my job . &quot;
&quot; of course I stood in regular contact with the Supervisory Board and its chairman Has@@ so Platt@@ ner , &quot; said Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t of the &quot; SZ . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t usually oscill@@ ates between Germany and the USA , but since summer he was no longer in the German SAP headquarters in Wall@@ dorf . &quot;
&quot; it is important to him to go to the public with such a personal story , said the manager of the &quot; SZ &quot; : &quot; everyone can happen . &quot;
&quot; it is important to get up again , if you like it . &quot;
Mc@@ L@@ aren replacement pilot Magn@@ us@@ sen apart from skir@@ mish ...
Magn@@ us@@ sen thunder@@ ed a corresponding photo and explained that he suffered the injury when he crashed from the wheel .
&quot; he therefore comes as little as a spare race for the two common pilots Fernando Al@@ on@@ so and J@@ enson Button , just like a week later at the Grand Prix of Japan . &quot;
football : BV@@ B without re@@ us against Kr@@ as@@ no@@ dar : Weiden@@ f@@ eller in the gate
&quot; at Bor@@ us@@ sia Dortmund , all hopes of a com@@ eback by Marco Re@@ us will finally cut off in the first group game of the Europa League . &quot;
the national player will also be missing the championship leader of the Bundes@@ liga in Du@@ ell with the FK Kr@@ as@@ no@@ dar on Thursday ( 7 pm / Sky ) .
&quot; we cannot fall back on him , &quot; &quot; said Thomas Tu@@ ck on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; if Re@@ us will be back on Sunday at the Bundes@@ liga @-@ Top@@ spiel against Le@@ verk@@ usen , the BV@@ B coach left open : &quot; we reck@@ on with a return from him to the training on Friday . &quot;
&quot; in view of the high loading of his pro@@ s , tu@@ ckle will not only change his stem @-@ elf on the Re@@ us position . &quot;
so he announced a change on the door@@ ke@@ epers position .
&quot; therefore , Roman Weiden@@ f@@ eller takes the place from the master keeper Roman Bür@@ ki . &quot;
&quot; he trains at an absolute top level , &quot; the football teacher praised the World Champion . &quot;
&quot; however , if Weiden@@ f@@ eller is in use in all Europe @-@ league games , however , tu@@ ckle left open . &quot;
&quot; with high probability , he will also deny the second game . &quot;
&quot; the for@@ ter statement from co @-@ player Re@@ us , that the final entry for the BV@@ B in the Europa League must be the goal , will keep Julian Wei@@ gl for understandable : &quot; &quot; that &apos;s why Marco is not so wrong . &quot;
I think we have a good chance to pick up the title .
Robot@@ er@@ au@@ tos : government wants leadership role for Germany
&quot; according to the will of the Federal Government , Germany should be a pioneer in the transformation of the car . &quot;
&quot; on Wednesday , the Federal Cab@@ inet decided on Wednesday a strategy paper from the house of Minister of Transport Alexander Do@@ brin@@ dt ( CS@@ U ) , which among other things fores@@ ees investments in the expansion of digital infrastructure . &quot;
&quot; on Wednesday , Do@@ brin@@ dt spoke at Frankfurt at the edge of the fair I@@ AA from a &quot; new mobility era . &quot; &quot;
&quot; automated and connected driving will increase traffic safety and provide less traffic , said Do@@ brin@@ dt . &quot;
&quot; he wants to discuss the issue with his counter@@ part colleagues from the G@@ 7 states , who also come together with industry representatives at the I@@ AA . &quot;
&quot; among other things , the strategy paper of the Ministry of Transport emphas@@ ises the importance of mobile broad@@ band expansion and rapid access to digital radio radio . &quot;
testing new technology is currently developing a test track on the highway 9 in Bavaria .
&quot; in order to avoid any additional liability risks to the driver , the Federal Government intends to review the legal framework conditions and , where necessary , to adapt to the new developments . &quot;
&quot; for example , Germany wants to use internationally for the permitted maximum speed for self @-@ prop@@ elled cars from 10 to 130 km / h . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the Federal Government wants to apply for a change in the Vienna Convention , which has so far only fores@@ een the human being as a driver . &quot;
&quot; on automated driving , the car takes over the lead , the driver becomes more and more the passenger . &quot;
the technology is mainly based on sensors and cameras that capture the environment and process data in seconds fast .
&quot; according to a study commissioned by the Ministry of Economy , highly automated driving on motor@@ ways by 2020 will be technically possible . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , road@@ less vehicles on public roads are expected to be expected only far after 2020 . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; the digital networking of the car can lead to greater safety and efficiency in road traffic , &quot; said the SPD pro @-@ politi@@ cian S@@ ör@@ en Bar@@ to@@ l . &quot;
&quot; however , the question of liability in accidents and the safety of the personal data of the drivers must be clearly clari@@ fied . &quot;
&quot; however , the German self @-@ prop@@ elled cars still look skep@@ tical - much more than French or Americans . &quot;

&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; anyway , drivers in Germany are not ready to completely rely on a self @-@ prop@@ elled vehicle . &quot;
&quot; following a survey of the digital association Bit@@ kom , only seven percent would agree to give control over the entire journey on all roads . &quot;
&quot; on the fre@@ eway , that in flowing traffic could at least imagine 15 percent , in St@@ au 45 percent . &quot;
good every fourth would leave the car to control under no circumstances .
B@@ oll says team and double start at table tennis @-@ EM
&quot; according to current status , Düssel@@ dorfer wishes to beat only in singles on September 25 to October 4 . &quot;
the final decision should be taken at the latest on September 22 .
&quot; this is a huge loss for our team . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the guys experienced it in the morning . &quot;
&quot; but we are strong enough to get the title even without Timo , &quot; said Bun@@ de@@ strainer Jörg Ro@@ ß@@ kopf during the European Championship in Düsseldorf . &quot;
&quot; at that time , B@@ oll was on the flight to a long @-@ term sponsor@@ ship in China . &quot;
the 34 year old German master is expected to come back on Friday .
&quot; without Timo is the dis@@ advantage , we are no longer such a clear favorite , &quot; &quot; explained Single European champion Dimit@@ ri@@ j Ov@@ t@@ char@@ ov . &quot;
&quot; Ham@@ el@@ ner , who runs the S@@ etz@@ er in Y@@ ek@@ ater@@ in@@ burg , also remembered the EM 2013 in Sch@@ wech@@ at . &quot;
&quot; at that time Timo was also missing , and we became European champion . &quot;
&quot; that is why we should ori@@ ent ourselves , &quot; &quot; explained the world tran@@ g@@ ist @-@ fifth . &quot;
the English football team Luke Sha@@ w of Manchester United moved a serious injury to the right leg .

Gau@@ l@@ tier feels too old for a duck .
the designer Jean Paul Gau@@ l@@ tier ( 63 ) has presented an exhibition about his work on Wednesday in Munich .
the highlights : DIS@@ PLA@@ Y MAN@@ NE@@ QU@@ INS that look terri@@ fying thanks to video proj@@ ections .
&quot; they wear the spectacular creations of the French designer , who , among other things , became the big star of the fashion scene with Mad@@ onn@@ as stage out@@ fits - and that he put men in skir@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; today I cannot say that I am the end of the Haute Cou@@ ture , because I have white hair . &quot;
&quot; earlier it was easy , meanwhile it &apos;s real , &quot; &quot; said Gau@@ l@@ tier . &quot;
&quot; for the visitors of the exhibition &quot; From The Side@@ walk To The Cat@@ walk &quot; ( From Bürger@@ stei@@ g auf den Lauf@@ ste@@ g ) , which is to be seen from 18 September at the Kunsth@@ alle der Hyp@@ o Kultur@@ stiftung , it is a good fortune that the designer has changed his initially le@@ aning attitude towards a show about his person . &quot;
&quot; actually he was against it , for : &quot; &quot; for me an exhibition so@@ unded a bit of death , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; when one dies , one comes to the museum . &quot;
the impressive collection had already been made in the Canadian Montreal and Paris Station .
&quot; it &apos;s about as much more than just beautiful clothes , &quot; said the director of the Kunsth@@ alle , Roger Die@@ ßen . &quot;
&quot; it is about tolerance , acceptance and vision of an open society . &quot;
&quot; the exhibits give an insight into which hardly any man &apos;s work , written in fashion history , without ever having completed an apprentic@@ eship . &quot;
&quot; chron@@ ologically , the show is not constructed , but it is an excell@@ ently chore@@ ograph@@ ed overall artwork for which much effort was used : to refres@@ h the dolls , for example , a sty@@ list has been engaged . &quot;
&quot; 14 tons of material , according to the cur@@ ator Thierry @-@ Maxim@@ e L@@ ori@@ ot , have ar@@ isen to Munich . &quot;
&quot; shortly before the start of the Oktober@@ fest , there was still a special delic@@ acy : a leather pants outfit with cor@@ set . &quot;
Hei@@ di meets Madonna .
&quot; he has always been interested in strong women ( &quot; &quot; women are smar@@ ter than men &quot; &quot; ) and for people who are a bit different , said Gau@@ l@@ tier . &quot;
also Gau@@ l@@ tiers old Teddy is to be seen in the exhibition .
&quot; he stands for the first , agile @-@ fashi@@ oned side@@ ways of the designer . &quot;
&quot; as a child ( he was not a good student and bad in football ) he used his Teddy B@@ H@@ s and dresses , said Gau@@ l@@ tier . &quot;
&quot; playing with a doll , his parents wouldn &apos;t have allowed him . &quot;
he then taught himself how to throw out fashion .
he steel fashion magazines and saw the designs of other designers how Gau@@ l@@ tier told in Munich .
later I bought the then naturally .
&quot; for his first own fashion show , he cannot pay the models . &quot;
&quot; they got nothing , but they were allowed to keep the clothes . &quot;
jewelry instead of Gar@@ dine - P@@ lau@@ ener Spitze as fashion @-@ niche
&quot; earlier we went to the long embroi@@ dery machines in and around P@@ lau@@ en , to make meters . &quot;
&quot; the embroi@@ dered fabrics and tips were created in large quantities for customers , which they processed for example to blan@@ kets and she@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; this alone does not work anymore , explains Andreas Rein@@ hardt , Managing Director of Mo@@ desp@@ itze P@@ lau@@ en . &quot;
&quot; instead , fashion is again important . &quot;
&quot; in the early times of the P@@ lau@@ ener Spitze , fashion plays a major role , was then displac@@ ed by the home textile industry - and is now re@@ discovered as niche . &quot;
&quot; Rein@@ hardt calls for some examples : lace in jewelry , with accessories such as bags and for regional costumes . &quot;
&quot; the so @-@ called vintage fashion , which leans on past boots , is an increasing order potential . &quot;
those who do not use niche in the textile industry in Germany is no longer on the market .
&quot; with us , they already make half of all orders . &quot;
&quot; together with nine other companies , Mo@@ desp@@ itze P@@ lau@@ en is a member of the association P@@ lau@@ ener Spitze and Sti@@ cker@@ eien . &quot;
only they must bear the protected label .
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
private specialty shops and wholesale distribution are almost no longer available .
our products hardly reach the customer in this way .
&quot; nowadays , the mass @-@ ware is produced much cheaper in the Asian region and is sold almost exclusively by chains . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , exports , current to Russia and the US . &quot;
so there are enough reasons for new ways .
&quot; the industry association also tries to score points on environmental awareness , such as C@@ ord@@ ula Bauer of the Stick@@ per@@ le in Fal@@ k@@ enstein : &quot; since this year we have been introducing a quality seal , which shows that we produce ec@@ ologically and socially compatible . &quot;
Rein@@ hardt adds : &quot; this also applies to the materials used . &quot;
diploma designer U@@ te Schmidt teaches at the Schne@@ eber@@ ger Office of the West@@ säch@@ s@@ ische Hochschule Z@@ wick@@ au - at the Faculty of Applied Arts - and is specialized in embroi@@ dery and sp@@ ik@@ es .
&quot; in order to counter@@ act the competition from the Asian region , you have to find high @-@ quality and innovative products . &quot;
this takes time and courage .
&quot; there is a tension between the fresh@@ est ideas of the designers and the companies that need to think economically , &quot; Schmidt says . &quot;
&quot; therefore , an existing design is often only slightly different to maintain a customer base . &quot;
&quot; a few years ago , Kat@@ i Re@@ uter re@@ bu@@ ked the historical snow@@ ball tip a few years ago . &quot;
the machine sti@@ cks small kitchens at some places .
&quot; the P@@ lau@@ ener Gold@@ schmi@@ ede@@ meister@@ in Bianca H@@ alle@@ bach @-@ K@@ rau@@ ß was inspired by it : &quot; before , I couldn &apos;t do anything with traditional P@@ lau@@ ener Spitze . &quot;
now she uses the snow@@ ball tip for her jewelry .
in an elaborate process it shapes the pattern in silver .
&quot; many people in the region relate to the topic of P@@ lau@@ ener Spitze - young and old , &quot; &quot; says Re@@ uter . &quot;
&quot; it also supplies to the USA , Australia and Finland - mainly to customers whose ancestors lived in P@@ lau@@ en and surroundings and who want to mem@@ ori@@ ze . &quot;
so I see my jewellery as a modern ambassador for the P@@ lau@@ ener Spitze .
Disney plans new &quot; Mary P@@ opp@@ ins &quot; movie
&quot; Legends should not be stir@@ red , but Disney is still vent@@ uring into a new film of his classic &quot; Mary P@@ opp@@ ins . &quot; &quot;
&quot; according to &quot; &quot; Entertainment Week@@ ly &quot; , &quot; however , it is not about a new movie but a kind of continuation , which plays for 20 years after the first film with the magic child girl . &quot;
it is about the experiences of the N@@ anny with the B@@ anks family in times of the world economic crisis in England .
who plays P@@ opp@@ ins more than 50 years after Ju@@ lie Andre@@ ws is still un@@ clear .
&quot; but the director already stands out : Rob Marshall , last with &quot; In@@ to the W@@ oods &quot; in the cinema . &quot;
XI pus@@ hes to open the economy wide for the world
&quot; the economy must open broad to the outside to promote growth , President Xi Jin@@ ping said on Tuesday a group commissioned with the steering of reform . &quot;
&quot; China should advoc@@ ate foreign investment and know @-@ how and improve the strategies for business start @-@ ups , &quot; he said in a speech at the 16th meeting of the Central Executive Group for deep@@ ening a comprehensive reform . &quot;
&quot; encouraging new start @-@ ups and driving reforms will bring about new momentum and vitality and offer new place for economic growth , &quot; &quot; said Xi . &quot;
&quot; the management group has adopted a number of guidelines , including a negative list for the regulation of market access , relaxation of border controls policies , promotion of state enterprises ( SO@@ E ) , private capital , and over@@ hau@@ l of the population reporting system . &quot;
&quot; according to the statement , a negative list is created , which identifies sectors and companies that are not in question for investments . &quot;
the system is gradually tested and improved by test programs .
&quot; the initiative is of importance because it grants the market a greater role in allocation of resources , ensuring a legally @-@ state business environment and open the market more open , said the statement . &quot;
the government will also lo@@ osen the inspec@@ tions transferred to the companies and make sure that companies decide how to conduct their business .
the statement also said that China will allow border regions to explore new models of cross @-@ border economic co @-@ operation and new mechanisms to promote regional growth .
&quot; as part of an offer to open state controlled sectors , further areas for private investment will be opened . &quot;
&quot; the government will not change its policy towards foreign investments and will protect the legitimate interests of foreign companies and provide better services for them , &quot; &quot; said the statement . &quot;
&quot; moreover , it is easier for foreigners to apply for a permanent residence permit or &quot; &quot; Green Card &quot; &quot; by optimi@@ zing the requirements and facilit@@ ating the application process . &quot;
&quot; the right of lawyers to guarantee their activity , and employ professional judges and prosec@@ ut@@ ors , was also discussed at a meeting . &quot;
Prime Minister Li Ke@@ q@@ i@@ ang and important leaders such as Li@@ u Y@@ un@@ shan and Z@@ hang Ga@@ oli also participated in the meeting as reported in a statement published after the meeting .
EU wants to double mer@@ cury limit value in pre@@ dat@@ ors
&quot; &quot; &quot; the European Commission wants to double the limit values for mer@@ cury in large pre@@ dat@@ ors and to reduce the consumers a significantly higher dose of the neur@@ ons . &quot;
&quot; the consumer organisation food@@ watch , which is a corresponding paper of the EU , critic@@ ised the plans sharp@@ ly : &quot; risks and side effects of missing industrial and environmental policy are passed on with full force of pregnant and inf@@ ants , &quot; explained Matthias Wolf@@ sch@@ midt of food@@ watch . &quot;
&quot; according to Wolf@@ sch@@ midt , the limit values of the nervous system for large fish should be raised at the end of the food chain such as shar@@ k or s@@ word@@ fish for economic reasons , from one to two milli@@ grams of mer@@ cury per kil@@ ogram of fish . &quot;
&quot; however , large pre@@ dat@@ ory fish are already so heavily bur@@ dened with mer@@ cury that on the basis of the still valid limit values about 50 per cent of the cat@@ ches are not allowed to be sold . &quot;
&quot; after dou@@ bling the limit values , only 14.5 percent would be ru@@ de . &quot;
&quot; in return for this loos@@ ening , the EU wants to ag@@ grav@@ ate the limit values for other fish from currently 0.5 milli@@ gram to 0.1 milli@@ gram of mer@@ cury per kil@@ ogram . &quot;
&quot; however , food@@ watch described this as &quot; trick &quot; because smaller c@@ low@@ n@@ fish , such as car@@ p , are usually so low , that they keep the planned high@@ s already today . &quot;
&quot; therefore , lowering in plain is &quot; a per@@ fi@@ de de@@ fle@@ ction man@@ oeu@@ vre that helps the economy alone , &quot; &quot; explained Wolf@@ sch@@ midt . &quot;
mer@@ cury is a heavy metal which is highly toxic for humans which is strongly influenced by the food chain mainly in pre@@ dat@@ ory fish .
&quot; the Federal Government therefore war@@ ns that &quot; &quot; small quantities are particularly likely to cause inf@@ ants of the nervous system . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the Federal Environment Ministry explained on his homepage with regard to the maximum values , however , that a &quot; health haz@@ ard of the general population &quot; is not expected . &quot;
mer@@ cury is mainly due to the carbon combustion in the environment .
&quot; according to a written information by the German Federal Environment Ministry , the German coal @-@ fired co@@ asts viol@@ ate more than six tonnes of mer@@ cury in the year , two thirds of the total amount issued in Germany . &quot;
&quot; the concentration of mer@@ cury in fis@@ hings for instance in Elbe , Rhine and Danube was &quot; permanently and surface @-@ covered &quot; , &quot; the &quot; Spiegel &quot; had quoted from paper in March . &quot;
&quot; last year , Europe @-@ wide warning against mer@@ cury in fish was already one of the most commonly reported health risks in the EU warning system RA@@ S@@ FF . &quot;
