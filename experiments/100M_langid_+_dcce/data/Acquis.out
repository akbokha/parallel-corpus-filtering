&quot; in any case , the securing measures planned in this Convention will once again be applied once the core material is returned to a peaceful nuclear activity . &quot;
&quot; the organization is kept running on the current state , and the composition of this material in the respective state or the concerned states , and on any disclosure of such material from this state or these states . &quot;
&quot; this explains their understanding as quickly as possible ; however , it extends only on matters such as tempor@@ al and proced@@ ural rules and arrangements for reporting , but does not include endor@@ sement or under in@@ sider knowledge of military activity , and does not apply to the following use of the core material . &quot;
&quot; the organization , the community and the states bear the costs that each of them grow up in the implementation of their respective obligations under this Convention . &quot;
&quot; the community , the states or individuals who are subject to their sovereignty , however , are subject to extraordinary costs due to a particular search of the organization , the organisation will reimbur@@ se these costs , as long as it has clari@@ fied beforehand in advance . &quot;
&quot; in any case , the organisation carries out the costs of all additional measurements and sampling schemes requested by the inspec@@ tors of the organization . &quot;
&quot; the community and states ensure that the liability of liability for nuclear damage , including insurance or other financial security , shall be entitled to the organisation and its officials for the purpose of carrying out this Convention in the same manner as on the nation@@ als of the States . &quot;
any claim that the Community or a State vis @-@ Ã  @-@ vis the organization or the organisation towards the Community or a State due to damage - with the exception of any damage resulting from a nuclear incident - is governed in accordance with international law .
&quot; in accordance with the deliber@@ ate information provided by the Director General , the Council is not able to verify that no core material that has to be subject to securing measures for nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive bodies in Article X@@ II paragraph C and possibly take the other measures provided there . &quot;
&quot; in such steps , the Council , in which mass was obtained by the applied safety measures , takes into account the community or the state - as far as each of the two contracting parties is concerned - every reasonable opportunity to give the Council the necessary security . &quot;
&quot; upon request of the organization , the community or a state , consult@@ ations on questions that arise from the interpretation or application of this Convention . &quot;
&quot; the Community and the States are entitled to request that questions , arising from the interpretation or application of this Convention shall be examined by the Council . &quot;
the Council invites the community and the affected state to participate in the discussion of such questions by the Council .
&quot; with the exception of disputes , a decision of the Council according to Article 19 or any of the measures made by the Council shall be disputes arising from the interpretation or application of this Convention , which shall not be submitted to the arbit@@ ral tri@@ bunal , or by another of the Organisation , the Community and the States , which consists of five arbit@@ rators . &quot;
&quot; the community and the states name two arbit@@ rators , the organization also names two arbit@@ rators , and the four designated arbit@@ rators elect a fifth that leads the pres@@ idency . &quot;
&quot; if the Community and the States or the Organization shall not be named two arbit@@ rators according to the request for an arbitr@@ ator , the community or organisation may seek the President of the International Court of Justice to ap@@ point these arbit@@ rators . &quot;
the same procedure is applicable if within thirty days after nam@@ ing or appointment of the fourth arbitr@@ ator the fifth arbitr@@ ator has not yet been chosen .
&quot; a majority of the members of the Arb@@ it@@ ral Tribunal are competent , and all decisions require the consent of at least three arbit@@ rators . &quot;
&quot; the decisions of the Arb@@ it@@ ral Tribunal are binding for the organization , the Community and the States concerned . &quot;
&quot; ( a ) This Convention enters into force for non @-@ nuclear weapons , the contracting party of the contract and become members of the association , in force , i ) if the relevant state of the organization noti@@ fies that its procedures are concluded for the entry into force of this Convention and &quot;
&quot; ( II ) When the organization of the Organization is notified , that it is able to apply its securing measures in relation to this state for the purposes of this Convention . &quot;
&quot; a ) The organization , the community and the states consult each other upon request of one of the contracting parties to am@@ end this Convention . &quot;
&quot; B ) All changes require the approval of the organization , the Community and the States . &quot;

B ) This Convention shall remain in force as long as the States Parties to the contracting party .
the term &quot; Convention &quot; used in this agreement signi@@ fies the agreement and the protocol .
the purpose of this part of the Convention is to specify the procedure as required when performing the provisions of Part I on securing measures .
the aim of the securing measures laid down in this Convention is the timely detection of the distribut@@ ing of significant nuclear weapons from peaceful nuclear activities for the production of nuclear weapons and other nuclear explo@@ sives for unknown purposes as well as the det@@ err@@ ent of such a junction through the risk of premature discovery .
&quot; for the purpose of reaching the target in Article 28 , the material accounting is used as securing measures of fundamental importance , combined with the spatial intervention and observation as important supplementary measures . &quot;
&quot; the technical completion of veri@@ fications by the organisation is carried out by an explanation , in which for each material balance zone , the material quantity is not specified for a specific period of time under specification of the accuracy limits for the given seas . &quot;
&quot; when performing their investigations , the organization in accordance with Article 3 makes full use of the Community &apos;s safety system . &quot;
the accounting and control system of the Community for nuclear material in accordance with this Convention is based on a breakdown in material balance zones .
&quot; when applying their backup measures , the Community will make use of de procedures and measures of the following kind of use and they , as far as necessary , see how they are defined in the supplementary agreements and are expe@@ dient : &quot;
&quot; a ) a measurement system to determine the quantities of preserved , restored , lost , lost , or in other ways out of the stock material and the stock@@ pile ; &quot;
B ) the evaluation of re@@ produ@@ ci@@ bility and accuracy of measurements and estim@@ ation of measurement uncertainty ;
C ) Procedure for identification and evaluation of differences in the measurements of sender and receiver ;
e ) method for ass@@ essing appropri@@ ations of un@@ measured stocks and not measured losses ;
&quot; F ) a protocol and reporting system , which points to the core material for each material balance zone and the changes in this inventory , including the inputs and outputs of the material balance zone ; &quot;
&quot; g ) provisions , which ensure that the accounting procedures and agreements are performed correctly ; &quot;
h ) Proced@@ ures to reimbur@@ se reports to the organization in accordance with the articles 59 to 65 and 67 to 69 .
the securing measures according to this Convention do not extend to material in mining or mining .
&quot; B ) is ur@@ anium - or th@@ orial material that has not yet reached the phase of the nuclear fuel cycle described under the letter c ) , the community of organization shares the quantity and composition of the material if it is not introduced for specific non @-@ nuclear purposes ; &quot;
&quot; C ) leaves core material , which is suitable for the composition and purity of fuel production or is@@ ot@@ ope enrich@@ ment , the plant or process phase in which it is produced , or will be introduced in a later stage of the nuclear fuel cycle in the States , so it is subject to the other securing measures mentioned in this Convention . &quot;
&quot; a ) The securing measures fores@@ een in this Convention shall be terminated for core material under the conditions mentioned in Article 11 . if the provisions mentioned in Article 11 are not permitted or desirable , the organisation and the community consult each other on the use of appropriate safety measures . &quot;
&quot; B ) The securing measures fores@@ een in this Convention shall be terminated for core material under the conditions mentioned in Article 13 , provided the organization and the Community agree that this core material is virtually un@@ profitable . &quot;
&quot; at the request of the community , the organisation fre@@ es the following core material from the securing measures according to this Convention : &quot;
a ) special fol@@ dable material when used in grams or smaller quantities as a sensor in instruments ;
&quot; ( B ) Nu@@ clear material if it is used in case of non @-@ nuclear activities pursuant to Article 13 , if such core material is retained , and &quot;
C ) Pl@@ ut@@ oni@@ um with an is@@ ot@@ ope concentration of Pl@@ ut@@ oni@@ um @-@ 238 which is over 80 % .
&quot; at the request of the community , the organisation fre@@ es core material which would otherwise be subject to securing measures according to this Convention , provided that the entire material quantity liber@@ ated in the states is no longer than any point in the states than &quot;
a ) A kil@@ ogram of particular p@@ alt@@ able material that can consist of one or more of the following materials :
&quot; II ) Ur@@ an with an enrich@@ ment of 0,2 ( 20 % ) and above , calcul@@ ates by multip@@ lication of its weight with enrich@@ ment , &quot;
&quot; Ur@@ an with an enrich@@ ment , which is under 0.2 ( 20 % ) and above the natural ur@@ anium , calcul@@ ates by multip@@ lication of its weight with the five @-@ fold square of enrich@@ ment ; &quot;
B ) a total of ten metric tons of natural ur@@ anium and de@@ pl@@ eted ur@@ anium with enrich@@ ment of more than 0.0@@ 05 ( 0.5 % ) ;
C ) twenty metric tons of de@@ pl@@ eted ur@@ anium with enrich@@ ment of 0.0@@ 05 ( 0.5 % ) or below ;
&quot; the core material is intended to be processed or stored in accordance with the core material , which is subject to the securing measures according to the Convention , processed or stored , so precau@@ tions are taken for the re@@ application of the securing measures on that material . &quot;
&quot; the community meets with the organisation of supplementary agreements , which are necessary for the successful and effective implementation of the tasks of the organization according to this Convention , in particular determine how the procedures specified in the Convention shall apply . &quot;
the supplementary agreements can be extended or amended without any change in the agreement between the organization and the community .
&quot; the Organisation , the Community and the States undertake all efforts to enter into force within nin@@ ety days after the entry into force ; an extension of this period requires an agreement between the organization , the community and the states . &quot;
&quot; on the basis of the initial report mentioned in Articles 62 , the organization provides a summar@@ ized inventory of the whole , the securing measures of this Convention within the States , regardless of its origin , on and on the basis of the following reports and the results of their investigations . &quot;
&quot; between the European Economic Community ( EEC ) and its Member States Belgium , Denmark , Germany , France , Ireland , Italy , Luxembourg , Netherlands , United Kingdom ( Member States ) on the one hand and the International Development Organization ( Organisation ) &quot;
&quot; ( GR@@ Ã@@ N@@ DE - a ) The EEC has decided to contribute to the special interaction program specified at the conference for international economic cooperation , to help meet the immediate needs of individual countries with low in@@ comes , whose development is ham@@ per@@ ed by general res@@ sour@@ cent@@ ran@@ s@@ fer@@ ential problems . &quot;
&quot; C ) It is the aim of the EEC and the Member States that the entire contribution made by Member States is bound to entry into force within six months following entry into force in the form of loans , and the organisation will do its utmost to achieve this goal . &quot;
D ) The EEC and the Organization have consul@@ ted each other on the proposed implementation and management of this agreement and the middle bind@@ ings in order to ensure broad and balanced geographical distribution within the framework of this agreement .
&quot; for this purpose , the Organization of the EEC has submitted a table out of which the criteria set forth in this agreement is intended - &quot;
&quot; the organisation direc@@ ts a special account under the name &quot; &quot; special action account &quot; &quot; which consists of the funds provided by the Member States according to this agreement to the special transaction account ; this account is defined by the organization as a manager , and only to the purpose specified in this agreement and in accordance with the provisions of this agreement . &quot;
the special transaction account is managed separately and separated from all other accounts and assets of the organization .
the contributions are to be paid as follows : a ) The payment takes place in the form of cash or non @-@ interest bonds of the member state that will pay upon request in the currency of the respective state to order the organization as administrator of the special transaction account and to be depos@@ ited in the organization in the respective country .
B ) The payment shall be made in two rati@@ os ( and i ) the first amoun@@ ting to at least 45 v . h . within 30 days after entry into force of this agreement or another between the EEC and the car@@ et@@ aker agreed upon ;
&quot; II ) the second in the amount of the remain@@ der of the contribution to 1 January 1979 or at any other date agreed between the EEC and the car@@ et@@ aker , taking into account the dead@@ lines required for parliamentary approval of the annual budget plans . &quot;
C ) E@@ ach Member State can make payments prior to the aforementioned dead@@ lines upon request .
&quot; according to the usual procedure of the organization , the administrator takes about proportional drawing on cash or school j@@ unk to cover expenses for the special transaction loans and balance the special transaction account in an appropriate manner . &quot;
&quot; in the grant of these loans , the car@@ et@@ aker can be guided by the following factors in accordance with the conditions of the EEC . &quot;
III ) the extent to which international economic factors contributed to the current and fores@@ e@@ eable economic problems of the country ;
VI ) the composition and the tendency of debt service in the country and its further l@@ ending capacity to bor@@ rowing conditions without bl@@ ending ; and
VII ) the extent to which the problems of the countries concerned can be regulated by contributions from other sources .
&quot; each special transaction is intended to finance a clearly defined and rapidly paying development programme or pre @-@ hab@@ itation ( including a sec@@ toral project ) , regardless of whether it belongs to the loan program of the organization or not , according to the procedures and practices which are considered to be considered for the loan program of the organization , which is to be taken into account for the purposes stated under the letter b ) of the pre@@ am@@ ble to this agreement . &quot;
&quot; the means of the special action con@@ tos may not be used instead of proper funding from the International Bank for Rec@@ on@@ struction and Development ( Bank ) or the Organisation , which has already been approved by the directors of the Bank or the Organisation on the day of entry into force . &quot;
&quot; apart from section 4 , special transaction loans are subject to the same payment conditions , which are generally valid for the development loans granted by the organization ; they are therefore ref@@ und@@ able in ten years of age in 50 years . &quot;
special transaction loans are granted in one or more currencies of the Member States and are ref@@ und@@ able in these currencies .
amounts to the payment of this watch can be made directly to the organization which it re@@ tains .
each special transaction is indicated by a separate loan agreement between the recipient country and the car@@ et@@ aker in which the source of the means is given .
&quot; recei@@ pts from each special transaction can be used for expenses in the currency of the recipient country or for goods or services which are established and are provided in a Member State ; ii ) in developing countries , the members of the organization and which , according to the stipul@@ ations stipul@@ ated by the administrator at the time of loan granted , could be recipients of a special action loan . &quot;
capital rep@@ ay@@ ments of special transaction loans are made to the special transaction account and the amount paid in the currency of a member state is to be returned to the Member State according to his input as soon as possible by the administrator .
&quot; the administrator shall instruc@@ t EW@@ G until complete awar@@ ding of all special transaction loans , which are currently under preparation for the audit by the directors in preparation and on the plans and programmes approved by the directors . &quot;
&quot; during the time of payment of the special transaction loans , the st@@ ew@@ ard instruc@@ ts the EW@@ G quar@@ terly on the development of the special transaction loans and the expenses for this . &quot;
the administrator transm@@ its the EEC as soon as possible after completion of the financial year of the organization a detailed account of the special transaction account with an opinion of the external account@@ ants of the organization to this account .
&quot; following full payment of the special transaction loans , the administrator of the EEC transm@@ its as soon as possible a detailed report on the projects financed by the special transaction account . &quot;
&quot; the car@@ et@@ aker creates and performs appropriate records and invo@@ ices , from which the contributions to the special transaction account , which are made up of account recei@@ pts from account and withdraw@@ als to the Member States . &quot;
the EEC and the car@@ et@@ aker work closely together to achieve the objectives of this agreement .
&quot; the EW@@ G ( represented by the Commission of the European Communities ) and the car@@ et@@ aker to the full output of the special transaction accounts , from time to time , lead to an exchange of ideas on the status of the special transaction accounts , the continuation of the programme financed by special transaction accounts and all other issues affecting the provisions of this agreement . &quot;
&quot; this agreement was not entered into force on 31 December 1978 , or at a later date , which the EEC and the organization may agree , so the agreement and all the obligations of the parties are sus@@ cep@@ tible to immediate effect . &quot;
&quot; if the total amount of capital paid by the recipients , in accordance with Article II Section 8 of this Agreement and transferred to the Member States , this agreement and all obligations of the parties are terminated with immediate effect . &quot;
this agreement requires approval by the individual member states and the EEC in accordance with the proced@@ ural regulations of each party .
the Member States Government noti@@ fies the General Sec@@ retariat of the Council of the European Communities to conclude the proceedings concerned .
the General Sec@@ retariat for@@ wards these notes together with a notification of the regulatory approval of this agreement by the EEC to the organisation .
&quot; this agreement is effective and enters into force on the first day of the month , following the date of receipt of the mentioned notification in the organisation . &quot;
&quot; this agreement is written in two manus@@ crip@@ ts in Danish , German , English , French , Italian and Dutch , with each wording equally binding . &quot;
&quot; whereas the agreement in the form of a letter to change the Annex A of Protocol No. 1 to the Agreement between the European Economic Community and the Swiss Con@@ federation ( 1 ) , H@@ AT has issued the following VER@@ OR@@ DN@@ UNG : &quot;
between the European Atom@@ ic Community and the Swiss Con@@ federation in the field of controlled nuclear fusion and plasma physics
&quot; the EURO@@ PE@@ AN Atom@@ ic Energy Community , herein@@ after called &quot; Eur@@ atom , &quot; represented by the Commission of the European Communities , herein@@ after referred to as &quot; Commission , &quot; &quot;
&quot; the SCH@@ WEI@@ Z@@ ER@@ IS@@ CHE Con@@ federation , herein@@ after referred to as &quot; Switzerland , &quot; represented by the Swiss Federal Council , herein@@ after referred to as &quot; Bundes@@ rat , &quot; &quot;
&quot; this program includes the creation of a large pilot plant , the J@@ ET project ( joint European Tor@@ us ) , whose construction and operation are named after Chapter V of the Eur@@ atom Treaty - herein@@ after called &quot; Joint Business J@@ ET &quot; . &quot; &quot;
Switzerland has been dealing with research in the field of controlled nuclear fusion and plasma gas for several years and is well acquainted with the area concerned .
&quot; as far as the practical use of controlled nuclear fusion is to be carried out , it is in the interests of the contracting parties of the present agreement to avoid unnecessary overl@@ aps and to accelerate their respective research , which have attained higher priority level due to the energy crisis . &quot;
&quot; this agreement should enable each contracting party to get the greatest possible benefit through a merger of their research efforts in the field of controlled nuclear fusion and plasma physics , i.e. the common objective of this research work , i.e. the cost @-@ moder@@ ately competitive electricity generation by using the controlled nuclear fusion reaction . &quot;
&quot; to achieve the target of the present agreement , the contracting parties associate their respective research programmes , herein@@ after called &quot; Eur@@ atom &quot; and &quot; Swiss program . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in order to ensure effective cooperation , the Swiss programme takes over the long @-@ term goals and forms of cooperation with the Eur@@ atom program ; it will be extended or changed after examination by the organs mentioned in Articles 5 to 10 and Article 16 of the present agreement , that there may be new activities relevant for the Eur@@ atom program . &quot;
&quot; each time the contracting parties accept a new program , this will take place at the place of the programs mentioned in Annex I and II to the present agreement . &quot;
the association en@@ vis@@ aged in paragraph 1 will be realised by : - appropriate participation of each of the contracting parties during the preparation and execution of the programs of the other party ;
&quot; - Exchange of personnel under the relevant laboratories in the Eur@@ atom Member States , Switzerland and third countries , with which Eur@@ atom has concluded a similar agreement as the present agreement , as well as the laboratories that collaborate on the Eur@@ atom program ; &quot;
- mutual right to access the scientific and technical results of the respective programmes .
&quot; as part of the present agreement , Switzerland is participating in the J@@ ET project . &quot;
&quot; in view of the association agreement stipul@@ ated in Article 2 paragraph 1 of this agreement , the contracting parties are called an association agreement , herein@@ after referred to as &quot; association agreement , &quot; which is referred to as far as possible to those associated with the establishment of the Eur@@ atom program . &quot;
&quot; with the same objective , Eur@@ atom is concerned that Switzerland is involved with the time of entry into force of the present agreement on the promotion of human exchange , which is concluded between the Commission and the associated Organ@@ s , herein@@ after &quot; Agreement on Human Resources . &quot; &quot;
&quot; with regard to the participation in the J@@ ET project , Switzerland is part of the entry into force of the present agreement to the Joint enterprise J@@ ET , whose statutes are accepted . &quot;
&quot; furthermore Eur@@ atom is concerned that Switzerland can become contractual partner for any contract , except association agreements or other similar contracts concluded by Eur@@ atom during the validity period of the present agreement . &quot;
&quot; the organs , which are assigned to the association in Article 2 paragraph 1 of the present agreement , are described in Article 5 to 10 of this agreement and in association agreement . &quot;
&quot; the association agreement , in particular , includes the establishment of a steering committee , the competent representative of the Commission and the Council of the Federation . &quot;
- to monitor the development of research work and to direct the best possible outcomes in accordance with the objectives of this agreement .
Switzerland is represented by a maximum of two delegates in the connection group used within the Eur@@ atom program - in the following &quot; VG . &quot;
&quot; the VG , which guarantees the exchange of information and cooperation in all questions concerning current or planned programs and activities in the area of the Eur@@ atom program , assumes that this agreement relates to all research and development activities . &quot;
&quot; in particular , it promotes cooperation and co @-@ ordination between the associated organs and direc@@ ts its T * ness in the interests of the two contracting parties to the common goal defined in the Eur@@ atom programme and the Swiss programme and the scientific and technological developments in the world . &quot;
&quot; according to its Rules of Procedure , the VG member will ap@@ point one or more Swiss representatives in the advisory groups created within the Eur@@ atom program , whenever the relevant Swiss authorities are seeking . &quot;
&quot; the consultation groups , which submit VG research proposals with regard to the fact that the means approved for the Eur@@ atom program provide the best possible scientific results , take this task in regard to all research and development work , which is referred to in this agreement . &quot;
Switzerland is represented by the director of one of the laboratories participating in the Eur@@ atom program .
the Committee of directors to monitor the implementation of the Eur@@ atom program and which is responsible for ensuring that the capacities of laboratories carried out in the work carried out in the framework of the program are carried out optimally with regard to all research and development work carried out under the present agreement .
&quot; he particularly cares for the best possible use of the personnel and for the exchange of the same between laboratories , which are involved in the implementation of the Eur@@ atom program and the Swiss program . &quot;
a Swiss representative is entitled to participate in the meetings of all coordin@@ ating committees used within the framework of the Eur@@ atom program .
&quot; the coordination committees , which have the best possible use of resources , personnel as well as the knowledge and skills that are involved in conducting the Eur@@ atom program , take this task in the respective field with regard to all research and development work , which fall under the present agreement . &quot;
&quot; BA@@ F is a responsible representative for each Member State of Eur@@ atom , Switzerland and any associated third country . &quot;
&quot; at the request of the Commission , the BA@@ F advis@@ es the Commission regarding the implementation of the programme and any changes in the exec@@ utions as well as in preparation of the future programmes and defining its overall scope , coordination and integration of national activities at Community level in the field of fusion . &quot;
&quot; the statements of the BA@@ F , the VG , the Director of Directors , the Advisory Group and the Coordination Com@@ mitt@@ ees have an advisory character . &quot;
the VG opinion on the urgent action is obligatory ; the same applies to the committee of directors in the field of personnel exchange .
the representatives of the two parties work on the works of all technical advisory committees or all administrative bodies created for the purposes of the present agreement .
&quot; the financial contribution of Switzerland at the Eur@@ atom programme , according to this agreement , is determined annually on an amount which is at the cost of the Eur@@ atom program in the same relationship as the gross domestic product of Eur@@ atom and Switzerland last year . &quot;
&quot; concerning the J@@ ET project , this financial contribution refers to the participation of Eur@@ atom on the Common Market as soon as this is established . &quot;
&quot; moreover , Switzerland as@@ signs to the Joint Enterprise J@@ ET , which is stipul@@ ated in accordance with the financial regulations of the Stat@@ utes of this Common Company . &quot;
&quot; the financial contribution , which Eur@@ atom contributes to the financing of the works within the association agreement and the agreement on personnel exchange , is based on the same basis that is usually used to calculate the Eur@@ atom contribution to the financing of the works based on the corresponding contracts . &quot;
&quot; the Commission will inform the Federal Council at the beginning of the year , which is intended to cover expenses in the context of the Eur@@ atom program for the year concerned . &quot;
the Federal Council pays the amount due to this article as follows : 7 / 12 before 15 January and 5 / 12 before the 15th .
July . the other payment methods for the financial contributions of Switzerland and Eur@@ atom in accordance with this article are stipul@@ ated in Annex III to the present agreement .
&quot; Switzerland takes all the necessary measures , so that Eur@@ atom of customs or other duties as well as import restrictions and restrictions shall be exemp@@ t from the part of the items financed by Eur@@ atom , which shall be used in Switzerland for activities within the framework of this agreement . &quot;
&quot; in Switzerland or where purchased items are not allowed to be sold in this country , nor free of charge unless the Federal Council approved . &quot;
these liber@@ ations are not applicable to ru@@ he@@ els and loans that will be paid to these persons .
the provisions on the access to the knowledge intended for the association stipul@@ ated in Article 2 paragraph 1 of the present Agreement shall be governed in Article 14 and 15 of this agreement as an association agreement and in the agreement on the exchange of personnel .
&quot; the provisions on access to the knowledge , which apply to the participation of Switzerland at the Joint Business J@@ ET , are regulated in Article 14 of this agreement and in the statutes of the Common Market . &quot;
the right of any contracting party to access to the knowledge of the other party is an essential part of this agreement .
&quot; - the exchange of personnel among the participating laboratories in Eur@@ atom , Switzerland and the associated third countries ; &quot;
&quot; - adequate consideration of companies in Eur@@ atom , Switzerland and associated third countries when awar@@ ding contracts to carry out the two associated programmes according to the principle of the best possible utilisation of the amounts used . &quot;
&quot; the knowledge gained during the validity of this agreement in Eur@@ atom and the associated organs in the field of controlled nuclear fusion and Plas@@ map@@ hy@@ si@@ k , will be able to justify the access to these knowledge under the same conditions as Member States , persons or enterprises of Eur@@ atom . &quot;
&quot; the knowledge gained during the research activities within the framework of this agreement in Switzerland will be communicated to the Member States of Eur@@ atom and the associated third countries as well as the persons or companies , who are engaged in a Member State of Eur@@ atom or an associated third @-@ state research or production activities which justify access to these knowledge . &quot;
&quot; the parties share this knowledge of other states , individuals or companies only if there is an agreement between the parties , unless these individuals or companies operate in Switzerland research or production activities which justify access to these knowledge . &quot;
&quot; by patent protected under section 1 and 2 of this article , these patents may be used by the Member States of Eur@@ atom , Switzerland , the associated third countries and the persons or companies that are located in the countries concerned , for research purposes in pursu@@ it of the objectives of this agreement . &quot;

BI@@ Z could close a stand@@ by credit agreement with the central banks of the credi@@ tor countries when the banks present a corresponding application .
&quot; the agreement could be closed down to the total amount paid by the credi@@ tor country to the mechanism paid by the credi@@ tor , and within a total limit of 2,7@@ 25 billion accounting units ; this corresponds to 50 % of all future plans of the member countries . &quot;
&quot; however , some conditions are already listed below , for whose application the BI@@ Z would be ready . &quot;
&quot; at each stand@@ by credit , the BI@@ Z would first assume an obligation for two years , with the possibility of extensions resist@@ ing , but without a total of five years . &quot;
&quot; at the opening of the loans , as well as during their subsequent pro@@ long@@ ation , the BI@@ Z would charge a credit @-@ opening fee . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it would be agreed that the first scre@@ enings will not be made prior to the exp@@ ir@@ ation of the stand@@ by agreement , so that the Bank can make the necessary adjustments to its own liqui@@ dity . &quot;
&quot; the currencies would be made available in the currencies at the disposal of the agreement at the disposal of the agreement , very likely in US dollars ; they would extend to time periods , which would be taking into account the funds of the bank , presum@@ ably three or six months . &quot;
&quot; the conditions would correspond to those who applied the BI@@ Z at the particular time on similar conditions , i.e. interest rates would largely correspond to the market sets . &quot;
&quot; if the BI@@ Z needs to obtain the necessary funds on the market , then the interest rate of the application could reach a maximum , which corresponds to a corresponding margin increased Li@@ bor . &quot;

in the form of a correspondence between the European Economic Community and the Argent@@ inian Republic on trade with h@@ amm@@ el and lamb meat
&quot; I urge me to take on the recent negotiations between our deleg@@ ations to set provisions on the import of h@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat from Argentina to the European Economic Community in connection with the application of the Common Market Organisation for sheep and goat meat . &quot;
&quot; - Fresh or cold h@@ amm@@ el - , lamb and goat meat ( 02.0@@ 1 A IV a ) ) ; &quot;
&quot; as part of this agreement , the export opportunities for h@@ amm@@ el - , lamb and goat meat from Argentina will be set to the following annual amount : 20,000 tons , expressed in car@@ c@@ asses weight ( 1 ) . &quot;
&quot; in order to ensure imp@@ ec@@ cable operation of the agreement , Argentina under@@ takes to ensure that the annual amount does not exceed the agreed amount and is executed according to conventional offer forms ( frozen or refriger@@ ated ) . &quot;
&quot; should a change in the offer form be possible as a result of changes in technology and commerce , the two parties shall consult each other before the introduction of such a change in the committee mentioned under the number 10 to find an appropriate solution . &quot;
&quot; in the event that the community takes the protection clause , it oblig@@ ates itself to bear care that the access of Argentina &apos;s access to the community market is not affected . &quot;
&quot; in the event that imports from Argentina exceed the agreed quantities in one year , the Community reserves the right to susp@@ end imports from Argentina for the rest of the year . &quot;
the Community comm@@ its itself to limit the exhaus@@ tion of imports of the products made by this agreement to a throughput rate of 10 b.@@ H . AD val@@ or@@ em .
&quot; when entering new Member States , the Community in consultation with Argentina will change the amount equal to the scope of Argent@@ ine@@ an trade with each new Member State . &quot;
the import charges for these new Member States shall be determined in accordance with the provisions of the Treaty of Acc@@ ession ; this shall be taken into account under the number 5 stated purpose of the dismis@@ sal of the exhaus@@ tion .
&quot; the total amount named under Number 2 is set to 23 000 tons of battle body weight , with the day of Greece accession to the community . &quot;
&quot; the community under@@ takes everything to avoid market development , which could imp@@ air the marketing of Argent@@ ine@@ an h@@ amm@@ el and lamb meat on the Community market within the agreed quantities . &quot;
&quot; in particular , the community meets precau@@ tions in order to prevent the paragraph of ven@@ tional orders on frozen meat due to the implementation of the regulation on the sale of Argent@@ inian h@@ amm@@ el and lamb meat . &quot;
&quot; taking into account the objectives and regulations of this agreement , the community agre@@ es that any actual application of reimbur@@ sement or other funding measures for the export of h@@ amm@@ el and lamb as well as the slaughter of certain living sheep and lam@@ bs will only take place in accordance with the existing international obligations and take into account the traditional portion of the community on world trade with these products . &quot;
&quot; these terms are in a way compatible with Article XVI of the G@@ AT@@ T and in particular Article 10 ( 2 letter c ) of the Convention on the Interpretation and Application of Articles VI , XVI and XX@@ III of the General Cust@@ oms and Trade Agreement . &quot;
&quot; Argentina guarantees compliance with this agreement , in particular , that there are stipul@@ ated quantities of export lic@@ ences specified in this agreement for the products listed under number 1 . &quot;
&quot; the community is obliged to make all necessary precau@@ tions , so that obtaining import lic@@ ences for the aforementioned products with origin in Argentina is dependent on the submission of an export license , which is designated by the authorities designated by the Argent@@ inian government . &quot;
the details of the application of this system are defined in such a way that on the position of a security deposit for obtaining the import license for the question@@ able products can be wai@@ ved .
&quot; in addition , it is stipul@@ ated that the competent Argent@@ ine@@ an authority of the responsible body of the community in regular intervals has been issued in regular intervals for export lic@@ ences . &quot;
the committee shall ensure that the agreement is properly applied and will work smoothly .
&quot; he regularly reviews the tendency on the h@@ amm@@ el - , lamb and goat &apos;s market of both parties and on the world market as well as the sales conditions on these markets , including the conditions mentioned under the number 7 . &quot;
&quot; the committee shall ensure that the proper application of this agreement is not affected by the fact that products made of h@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat under the agreement do not be carried out according to the agreement . &quot;
the committee considers all questions arising during the implementation of this agreement and recommends appropriate solutions to the competent authorities .
the provisions of this agreement are subject to the rights and obligations of the parties within the framework of the G@@ AT@@ T .
the annual amount stated under number 2 is valid for the period from 1 January to 31 December .
&quot; the amount of quantity demanded by the entry into force until 1 January of the following year is determined in relation to the total annual amount , and takes account of the seasonal character of the trade . &quot;
&quot; this agreement applies to the areas in which the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community is applied , and on the one hand and for the territory of the Republic of Argentina on the other hand . &quot;
&quot; it is valid until 31 March 1984 ; at that time , it remains in force , subject to the right of each party to termin@@ ate them in writing with a period of one year . &quot;
&quot; in any case , the provisions of this agreement shall be reviewed by the two parties before 1 April 1984 with regard to changes that they consider necessary to be necessary . &quot;
I would be grateful if you would share the consent of your government .
I encourage me to confirm the input of your current writing with the following wording :

&quot; with an agreement between the European Economic Community and New Zealand on trade with h@@ amm@@ el - , lamb and goat meat &quot;
&quot; I urge me to take part in the negotiations between our two deleg@@ ations to set provisions on the import of h@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat from New Zealand to the Community in connection with the application of the regulation on a common market organisation for h@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat . &quot;
&quot; in recognition of the fact that the sheep farming and the export of h@@ amm@@ el and lamb meat after the world market and especially after the community for the New Zealand economy is not affected , I urge me to propose the following agreement : &quot;
&quot; the agreement is valid for : - fresh or frozen h@@ amm@@ el - , lamb and goat meat ( 02.0@@ 1 A IV a ) ) ; &quot;
&quot; after this agreement , New Zealand is ensured for h@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat of access to the market of the Community in the height specified in the agreement . &quot;
&quot; new Zealand ob@@ tains the assurance that the normal sales of its h@@ amm@@ el and lamb meat is not affected by the application of the Ord@@ in@@ ance . &quot;
&quot; in order to ensure imp@@ ec@@ cable operation of the agreement , New Zealand comm@@ its itself to ensure that the annual amount does not exceed the set quantity . &quot;
the pre@@ defined quantities are carried out in conventional offer forms ( frozen or cooled ) .
the community ass@@ ures that New Zealand should not be prevented from using this agreement to use new technological developments or to maintain its competitive position on the market of the community .
&quot; should a change in the offer form be possible as a result of changes in technology and commerce , the two parties shall consult each other before the introduction of such a change in the committee mentioned in clause 10 to find an appropriate solution . &quot;
&quot; in the event that the community takes the protection clause , it under@@ takes to protect themselves from the interests of New Zealand &apos;s interests . &quot;
&quot; in the event that imports from New Zealand exceed the agreed quantities , the Community reserves the right to susp@@ end imports from this country . &quot;
the Community comm@@ its itself to limit the exhaus@@ tion of imports of the products captured by this agreement to a height of 10 b.@@ H . AD val@@ or@@ em .
&quot; in the accession of new Member States , the Community in consultation with New Zealand changes the amounts stated in clause 2 according to the scope of New Zealand trade with each new Member State . &quot;
the import charges for these new Member States shall be determined in accordance with the provisions of the Treaty of Acc@@ ession ; this shall be borne in clause 5 of the purpose of cancellation of the exhaus@@ tion .
the total amount mentioned in clause 2 is determined by the Day of Greece accession to the Community on 245 500 tons of batt@@ le@@ weight .
&quot; the community under@@ takes everything to prevent market development , which could imp@@ air the normal sales of New Zealand H@@ amm@@ el and lamb meat on the common market within the agreed quantities . &quot;
&quot; in particular , the community meets precau@@ tions in order to prevent the paragraph of ven@@ tional orders on frozen meat due to the implementation of the regulation of this goal . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the two parties do everything to promote the consumption of Schaff@@ lei@@ sch in the community without danger to market stability . &quot;
&quot; taking into account the goals and regulations of this agreement , the community agre@@ es that any actual application of reimbur@@ sement or other funding measures for the export of h@@ amm@@ el and lamb as well as from the slaughter of certain living sheep and lam@@ bs will only take place in accordance with the existing international obligations and take into account the traditional portion of the community on world trade with these products . &quot;
&quot; new Zealand guarantees compliance with the quantities mentioned in clause 2 , in particular that there are no export licenses beyond these amounts . &quot;
&quot; the Community comm@@ its itself to make all necessary arrangements , so that obtaining import lic@@ ences for the aforementioned products with origin in New Zealand is dependent on the submission of a export license , which is granted by the authorities designated by the New Zealand government . &quot;
the details of the application of this system are defined in such a way that on the position of a security deposit for obtaining the import license for the question@@ able products can be wai@@ ved .

&quot; - frozen h@@ amm@@ el - , lamb and goat meat ( Tari@@ f@@ stelle 02.0@@ 1 A IV b ) of the Common Tari@@ ff Tari@@ ff ) . &quot;
&quot; as part of this agreement , the export opportunities for h@@ amm@@ el - , lamb and goat meat from Uruguay have set the following annual amounts : &quot;
&quot; in order to ensure imp@@ ec@@ cable operation of the agreement , Uruguay is oblig@@ ated to ensure that the annual amount does not exceed the agreed amount and executed according to conventional offer forms ( frozen or refriger@@ ated ) . &quot;
&quot; should a change in the offer form be possible as a result of changes in technology and commerce , the two parties shall consult each other before the introduction of such a change in the committee mentioned under the number 10 to find an appropriate solution . &quot;
&quot; in the event that the community takes the protection clause , it under@@ takes to bear the concern that the Urugu@@ ay@@ ans regulated by this agreement will not be touched by the Community market . &quot;
&quot; in the event that imports from Uruguay in one year exceed the agreed quantities , the Community reserves the right to susp@@ end imports from Uruguay for the rest of the year . &quot;
the Community comm@@ its itself to limit the exhaus@@ tion to imports of the products made by this agreement to a throughput rate of 10 b.@@ H . AD val@@ or@@ em .
&quot; in the accession of new Member States , the Community in consultation with Uruguay is changing the amount equal to the amount of ur@@ u@@ gu@@ ay@@ an trade with each new Member State . &quot;
the import charges for these new Member States shall be determined in accordance with the provisions of the Treaty of Acc@@ ession ; this shall be taken into account under the number 5 stated purpose of the dismis@@ sal of the exhaus@@ tion .
the total amount named under Number 2 is set to 5 800 tons of car@@ c@@ ass body weight with the day of Greece accession to the community .
the community takes everything to avoid a market development that could imp@@ air the marketing of ur@@ u@@ gu@@ ay@@ an h@@ amm@@ el and lamb meat on the common market within the agreed quantities .
&quot; in particular , the community meets precau@@ tions in order to prevent the paragraph of ven@@ tional orders on frozen meat due to the implementation of the regulation the paragraph of ur@@ u@@ gu@@ ay@@ an arti@@ san@@ al . &quot;
&quot; taking into account the objectives and regulations of this agreement , the community agre@@ es that any actual application of reimbur@@ sement or other funding measures for the export of h@@ amm@@ el and lamb as well as the slaughter of certain living sheep and lam@@ bs will only take place in accordance with the existing international obligations and take into account the traditional portion of the community on world trade with these products . &quot;
&quot; these terms are in a way compatible with Article XVI of the G@@ AT@@ T and in particular Article 10 ( 2 letter c ) of the Convention on the Interpretation and Application of Articles VI , XVI and XX@@ III of the General Cust@@ oms and Trade Agreement . &quot;
&quot; Uruguay ass@@ ures compliance with this agreement , in particular , that within the quantities specified in this agreement , it is granted export lic@@ ences for the products named under number 1 . &quot;
&quot; the community is obliged to make all necessary arrangements , so that obtaining import lic@@ ences for the aforementioned products with origin in Uruguay is dependent on the submission of an export license , which is designated by the authorities designated by the ur@@ u@@ gu@@ ay@@ an government . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it is stipul@@ ated that the responsible ur@@ u@@ gu@@ ay@@ an authority of the responsible body of the community in regular intervals has been issued in regular intervals for export lic@@ ences ; these data may be payable according to destination country . &quot;
&quot; this agreement applies to the areas in which the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community is applied , and on the one hand and for the territory of the Republic of Ã@@ st@@ lich des Uruguay on the other . &quot;
&quot; it is valid until 31 March 1984 ; at that time , it remains in force , subject to the right of any party to termin@@ ate them in writing with a period of one year . &quot;
&quot; in any case , the provisions of this agreement shall be reviewed by the two parties before 1 April 1984 with regard to changes that they consider necessary . &quot;
I would be grateful if you confirm the approval of your government with this letter .

( translation ) Protocol to the Convention on long @-@ term perme@@ ation of air pollution from 1979 concerning the long @-@ term financing of the programme on cooperation in the measurement and evaluation of the iner@@ tia transmission of air poll@@ uting substances in Europe ( EME@@ P )
&quot; please note that the Convention on the Perman@@ ent gr@@ en@@ ching air pollution ( herein@@ after referred to as &quot; &quot; the Convention &quot; &quot; ) entered into force on 16 March 1983 , &quot;
&quot; in the awareness of the importance of the &quot; &quot; programme on cooperation in the measurement and evaluation of the fer@@ rous transmission of air poll@@ uting substances in Europe &quot; &quot; ( herein@@ after referred to as &quot; &quot; EME@@ P &quot; &quot; ) , &quot;
&quot; in recognition of the fact that the implementation of the EME@@ A has so far been enabled , thanks to the financial resources provided by the UN environmental programme and the voluntary contributions of governments , &quot;
&quot; in knowledge of the fact that the contribution of the UN environmental programme is only made until the end of 1984 , and this contribution and the voluntary contributions of governments must not fully cover the costs of applying the work plan of the EME@@ P , so that precau@@ tions must be made to ensure long @-@ term financing after 1984 , &quot;
&quot; in view of the demand by the Economic Commission for Europe in its decision B ( XX@@ X@@ VIII ) , in which they are inv@@ oked with im@@ print according to the mod@@ alities specified in the first session of the Executive Committee of the EE@@ A ( herein@@ after referred to as &quot; Executive Man@@ gan@@ ese &quot; ) , in particular those in connection with the work of the EME@@ P , &quot;

2 ) The financial obligations of the party that termin@@ ate this protocol shall continue until the termination is effective .
&quot; the wording of this protocol , whose English , French and Russian wording is equally binding , is depos@@ ited with the Secretary @-@ General of the United Nations . &quot;
containers and in@@ fusion equipment must be provided with an English and French @-@ speaking label that corresponds to the pattern in the systems 2 to 10 of this protocol .
human thorough@@ bred can only be disp@@ at@@ ched in tanks in which the temperature can be held at 4 C to 6 C during transport .
&quot; the preparations and equipment mentioned in Part II must be sterile , ap@@ y@@ rogen and non @-@ toxic . &quot;
it is recommended to add the ship@@ ments the equipment necessary to in@@ fusion as well as the solvent for dry preparations .
human thorough@@ bred is that of a healthy human being extracted and mixed with a suitable anti @-@ o@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant blood .
C ) which are not free from diseases that can be transmitted by blood trans@@ fu@@ sions as far as this can be assured by simple medical examination and medical history .
&quot; blood removal is as@@ ep@@ tic ; the blood is sli@@ pped into a sterile bottle through a closed , sterile tube system into which the anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant solution was fu@@ elled before steri@@ li@@ zation . &quot;
&quot; after the removal of the blood removal , the bottle is immediately closed and cooled down to a temperature of 4 C to 6 C . afterwards , it must be opened immediately before using the blood . &quot;
&quot; the anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ um solution must not exceed 220 ml per litre of human thorough@@ bred , and the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in concentration must not exceed 97 g per liter . &quot;
the blood group after the A @-@ B @-@ 0 system is determined before the blood cells and the ser@@ um ; the determination of the R@@ h factor is carried out by examining the blood cells on a new sample of the don@@ or blood .
&quot; if there are standardized or recommended procedures for blood group determination in individual countries , these are applicable . &quot;
&quot; the term R@@ h @-@ negative is only to be used if specific examinations have resulted in the non @-@ existence of the anti@@ gens C , D , You and E . &quot;
the blood covered by this Convention shall only be used for recipients of the corresponding working class AB @-@ 0 .
&quot; human thorough@@ bred is stored in sterile , sealed bottle from micro@@ organisms until it is used at a temperature of 4 to 6 C ; higher temperatures are allowed only during the time required for inspection and transport , which must be at most 30 minutes , wher@@ eu@@ pon the blood can be cooled immediately to 4 to 6 C . &quot;
&quot; a concentrate of human red blood cells is a unity of human thorough@@ bred , from which most of the plasma is removed . &quot;
it contains all red blood cells of the unit from which it has been won ; other blood cells can be present or can be partially removed .
the liquid content of the concentrate is either from the rest of the plasma or from a suitable is@@ ot@@ onic artificial wat@@ ering solution that was added after removal of the plasma .
&quot; the volume of the red blood cells should be between 65 and 75 % of the total volume of the product ; however , a higher concentration of red blood cells is used , so the approxim@@ ate percentage of the er@@ y@@ thro@@ cy@@ te volume ( hem@@ at@@ oc@@ rit ) is indicated on the label . &quot;
all operations required for the production must be carried out under as@@ ep@@ tic conditions . the acceptance must be carried out using a sterile , closed system and exclusively by pressure . &quot;
&quot; an artificial wat@@ ering solution has been added , so the volume and composition must be applied on the label . &quot;
human drying plasma is obtained through drying of the liquid that is ab@@ used in centri@@ fug@@ ation or sedi@@ mentation of human solid blood .
human dry plasma is obtained by cold drying or any other method by which a den@@ atur@@ ation of proteins is avoided .
&quot; the dry product can easily be dissolved in a quantity of water , which corresponds to the amount of fluid from which it was used in the manufacture of the substance . &quot;
protein concentration of the resulting solution must not be less than 45 g per liter and the solution must not have visible signs of hem@@ oly@@ sis products .
&quot; donations , in which ( using a cream sample ) have been found a dangerous content of in@@ sole or immune ha@@ em@@ ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ine , are excluded . &quot;
&quot; if the plasma is not mixed and frozen within 48 hours after the removal of blood , the ster@@ ility of each unit must be detected in a blood volume of at least 10 ml . &quot;
&quot; to eliminate the harmful effect of bacterial growth in the plasma , blood don@@ ating , the signs of a bacterial contamination , are not used ; the ster@@ ility of each donation must be proven in a blood volume of at least 10 ml . &quot;
&quot; in order to reduce the risk of transferring I@@ no@@ kul@@ ation@@ sh@@ ep@@ atitis , to take mix@@ tures , which do not contain more than 12 donations , or apply other methods , the most well @-@ known risk minim@@ izing this risk in a comparable way . &quot;
one of the liquid quantity from which one went out during the production of the plasma is to add a corresponding amount of water ; the substance must be completely dissolved within 10 minutes at 15 to 20 C .
a given quantum plasma is dissolved in the amount of water that corresponds to the fluid quantity from which it is produced ; the solution is subjected to the following tests :
&quot; II ) If one uses a sufficient amount of thro@@ mb@@ in or calcium chlori@@ de 1 ml solution , co@@ ag@@ ulation occurs ; the process can be accelerated in the incub@@ ator at 37 C . &quot;
&quot; due to the 24 @-@ step drying process in the presence of phosph@@ or@@ pent@@ oxide under a pressure of at most 0,@@ 02 mm mer@@ cury , weight loss may not occur at the human dry plasma weight loss over 0.5 % . &quot;
&quot; human dry plasma is in a nitrogen ath@@ mosph@@ ere or in an air @-@ empty space in a sterile , sealed bottle under exclusion of any micro @-@ organism and after the possibility of storing any moisture ; it is protected from light and keep on a temperature below 20 C . &quot;
human alb@@ um@@ in and fr@@ actions from human plasma proteins are preparations from the protein component that consist of about 60 % of the total prot@@ e@@ activity of the plasma of human thorough@@ bred .
&quot; without regard to whether the final product should be cur@@ l or dry , the preparation must be heated to 60 C Â± 0.5 C in the final container , in order to in@@ activate the path@@ o@@ gens of the I@@ no@@ kul@@ ation@@ sh@@ ep@@ atitis . &quot;
in preparations from human alb@@ um@@ in at least 95 % of the mass of the available proteins must be alb@@ um@@ ine .
&quot; in both preparations , no more than 10 mg immun@@ og@@ lob@@ ulin G per gram of the product may be present . &quot;
&quot; if the final product is frozen , it must contain at least 950 mg of protein per gram of the product . &quot;
&quot; if the Group is made of human plasma proteins as a solution , it must have a total protein concentration between 45 and 50 g per liter . &quot;
&quot; if human alb@@ um@@ in is produced as a solution , it must have a total protein concentration of at least 45 g per liter . &quot;
&quot; comparison measurements of vis@@ cosity and clou@@ d@@ iness as well as centri@@ fug@@ ing with the ultra@@ centri@@ fu@@ ge and electro@@ phor@@ esis , which are carried out before and after heating at the solutions , may not result in den@@ atur@@ ation of dissolved proteins . &quot;
&quot; after heating up to 57 C and six @-@ stage sh@@ aking in a mechanical sh@@ aker at this temperature , the solution must be completely free of visible particles . &quot;
I ) The precip@@ itation tests with specific antibodies must show that in both preparations only human plas@@ map@@ rot@@ eins are included ;
&quot; the electro@@ phor@@ esis presented by free @-@ floating particles under acceptable and suitable conditions must show that the protein fraction , which possesses the mobility of the alb@@ umin@@ um@@ component of the normal human plasma , has at least 95 % and in preparations made of human plasma proteins at least 85 % of the proteins . &quot;
&quot; in other preparations , from human alb@@ um@@ in and in fr@@ actions of human plasma proteins , the sodium concentration 0.@@ 15 mo@@ l per litre solution or recovered trol@@ ley preparation may not exceed . &quot;
the pot@@ assium concentration of the fr@@ actions of human plasma proteins must not exceed 2 m@@ mo@@ l per litre solution or re@@ manufactured dry preparation .
&quot; the pH value of each preparation should amount to a protein concentration of 10 g per liter with a solution that contains 0,15 mo@@ l pot@@ assium chlori@@ de per litre , at a temperature of 15 to 25 C 6,@@ 8 Â± 0.2 . &quot;
&quot; due to the 24 @-@ step drying process in the presence of phosph@@ or@@ pent@@ oxide under a pressure of at most 0,@@ 02 mm mer@@ cury , weight loss may not occur at the dry preparations for weight loss over 0.5 % . &quot;
&quot; human dry alb@@ um@@ in is in a nitrogen atmosphere or in an air@@ less space in sterile , closed container under exclusion of micro @-@ organisms and after the possibility of moisture storage ; it is protected from light and keep on a temperature below 20 C . &quot;
solutions from human alb@@ um@@ in and fr@@ actions of human plasma proteins are stored in sterile and sealed containers under exclusion of micro@@ organisms . they are protected from light and keep on a temperature of 4 to 6 C .
the label on the container contains all information recorded on the appropriate Mu@@ stere@@ otype ( Annex 4 ) .
&quot; normal human immun@@ og@@ lob@@ ulin is a plastic compound made of plasma proteins , which was made from human , the antibodies of normal adult . &quot;
the used method of production must ensure that the final product is fu@@ elled on the conditions described below and does not transfer I@@ no@@ kul@@ ation@@ sh@@ ep@@ atitis .
&quot; in addition , the production method must ensure that the antibodies contained in the output product are concentrated in sufficient quantity in the final product . &quot;
&quot; the method is satis@@ factory for each final preparation , if in the initial and end product antibodies for at least one virus and a bacterial tox@@ in may be ti@@ ered . &quot;
&quot; during production , no anti@@ sep@@ tic or bacter@@ i@@ ost@@ atic substance must be added ; to ensure the bacterial ster@@ ility and stability of the end product , a suitable preser@@ v@@ ative and a suitable stabil@@ ising agent can be added to it . &quot;
the end product is delivered as a solution whose immun@@ og@@ lob@@ ulin concentrations must be between 100 and 170 g per liter .
&quot; the electro@@ phor@@ esis , represented by free @-@ floating particles under acceptable and suitable conditions , must show that at least 90 % of the proteins have the ag@@ ility of the gam@@ ma component of the normal human plasma . &quot;
&quot; the final solution must not be seen before or after a 7 @-@ day warming on 37 C visible signs of precip@@ itation or clou@@ d@@ iness , and it is advisable . &quot;

a re@@ agent for blood group determination must react with all tested blood samples that contain the an@@ tigen that contains the an@@ tigen that is hom@@ olo@@ g to the antibody or another on the label .
&quot; if a re@@ agent is used in the manner recommended by the manufacturer , the following factors or phenomena may not occur : a ) h@@ amm@@ oly@@ tic properties ; &quot;
the ti@@ ter is measured by ever renewed di@@ lution of the re@@ actor to the double in a suitable medium .
the ti@@ ter is the re@@ zi@@ pro@@ cal value of the number of the strongest ser@@ um th@@ inner in which a reaction occurs ; the th@@ inning is calculated only in volume of blood cells in the total volume .
&quot; for anti @-@ A , anti @-@ B or other re@@ agents used on object carriers , the activity is expressed through the time required for ag@@ glut@@ ination on an object carrier . &quot;
&quot; the World Health Organization has established international standards for anti @-@ A and anti @-@ B , as well as in@@ complete anti @-@ D re@@ agents for the determination of blood group determination International standards , and for re@@ agents of other specific@@ ity , standards are elabor@@ ated at present . &quot;
&quot; according to definition , an international standard preparation contains a number of international units per mg or ml , and this definition is independent of the ti@@ ters which are observed in individual preparations of red blood cells ( 1 ) . &quot;
( 1 ) The effectiveness of re@@ agents for blood group determination of most specific@@ ities is expressed as ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ation@@ sti@@ tes that are observed in a series of di@@ lution in er@@ y@@ thro@@ cy@@ te in@@ undation .
the Tit@@ er speci@@ fies the di@@ lution of the re@@ actor in the last mix within a series where a micro@@ sc@@ opic visible ag@@ glut@@ ination occurs .
&quot; the effectiveness of re@@ agents for blood group determination , for which international standard preparations are present ( at present anti @-@ A and anti @-@ B as well as in@@ complete anti @-@ D ) , can be expressed on the basis of the title of the unknown re@@ agent in international units ( see Bulletin WHO O@@ MS 1954 , 10 , 9@@ 37 , 9@@ 41 - 1950 , 3 , 301 . ) . &quot;
&quot; if you bring them back to a volume of 1 ml , the Anti @-@ A and Anti @-@ B S@@ eren contain according to definition 256 international units per ml . &quot;
&quot; preparations are available free of charge from the International Laboratory for Bi@@ ological Standards of the World Health Organization , Stat@@ ens Ser@@ um Institute , Copenhagen . &quot;
the following table shows an example of a comparative ti@@ tr@@ ation of the International standard ser@@ um ( S ) and an &quot; unknown &quot; anti @-@ A re@@ agent ( U ) against red blood cells A1 and red blood cells A@@ 2B . &gt; PI@@ C FI@@ LE = &quot; T@@ 00@@ 450@@ 83 &quot; &gt;
&quot; if a re@@ agent is stored under the conditions recommended by the manufacturer , its properties should be maintained at least one year . &quot;
the exp@@ ir@@ ation date of a re@@ agent in fluid form according to the label is at most one year after the last satis@@ factory test test .
the exp@@ ir@@ ation date indicated on the label for dry re@@ agents depends on the results of the shelf tests ; it is appro@@ achable by the state supervisory authorities .
dry re@@ agents are stored in an atmosphere of in@@ ert gas or in a vacuum .
&quot; a dry re@@ agent may lose at most 0,5 v.@@ H. of its weight if it is tested by further drying about phosph@@ or@@ pent@@ oxy@@ de at a pressure of no more than 0,@@ 02 mm Hg in 24 hours . &quot;
&quot; to avoid bacterial growth , the responsible state authority may determine that the re@@ agent ( or the solvents supplied by the dry re@@ agents ) can be added to an anti@@ sep@@ tic and / or antibiotic , as long as the re@@ agent with the added substance continues to obtain the prerequis@@ ites for specific@@ ity and efficacy . &quot;
sera human origin for blood group determination must contain at least 2.5 mg protein per ml of cur@@ l or recur@@ rent ser@@ ums .
&quot; re@@ agents , indiffer@@ ent , whether in fluid form or after re@@ activation , must be transparent and must not contain sedi@@ ments or gels or visible particles . &quot;
&quot; the re@@ agents destined for the international exchange of blood group determination should not be arti@@ fici@@ ally colored as possible , at least until an international agreement has come about through a uniform system . &quot;
re@@ agents for blood group determination are to be distributed in such a way and in such quantities that the re@@ agent located in a container is not only sufficient to carry out tests with the unknown blood cells but also to carry out tests with positive and negative contro@@ ll blood cells .
the amount must be so large that the content may be used to carry out the efficacy tests described in this protocol .
the manufacturer &apos;s laboratory has written records on all levels of production and checks of re@@ agents for blood group determination .
appropriate samples of all re@@ agents are to be kept from the laboratory until some probability can be assumed that the batch is no longer used .
&quot; re@@ agents used for blood group determination may contain substances of human , animal , plant ( or mineral ) ; some of these represent the effective share , the others are the necessary aids to strengthen the effectiveness and maintain the stability of the re@@ agent . &quot;
&quot; for technical reasons , these re@@ agents are divided into three groups according to their effectiveness . &quot;
this does not mean that re@@ agents of human origin contain exclusively substances of human origin or that animal or plant re@@ agents cannot contain substances of human origin .
&quot; on every single container , a black printed label is available in English and French , containing the following information : 1 . name and address of the manufacturer , &quot;
&quot; 4. the amount or , in case of dried re@@ agents , the quantity and composition of the liquid required for re@@ activation , &quot;
&quot; in addition , this label or label on the box in which the individual containers are located , or the instructions attached to the containers contain the following information : 1 . full name and address of the manufacturer , &quot;
&quot; 3. the amount or , in case of dried re@@ agents , the quantity and composition of the liquid required for re@@ activation , &quot;
each shipment shall be accompanied by a certificate in accordance with Article 4 of the Convention according to the Annex to this protocol .

the effectiveness of the ser@@ um must in no case be less than 64 international units per ml .
&quot; anti @-@ A ser@@ um is mixed on an object carrier with a same amount of 5 to 10 percent im@@ pregn@@ ation of A@@ 1- , A@@ 2- and A@@ 2B blood cells , which is necessary when the same attempt is performed with the dissolved International standard preparation of the anti @-@ A blood group ser@@ um or a standard preparation of the same avi@@ dity . &quot;
anti @-@ B ser@@ um is obtained from the blood of selected persons of the group A which can be immun@@ ised by red blood cells or by specific substances of the group B .

&quot; an anti @-@ B ser@@ um is parallel to the dissolved , but un@@ dil@@ uted international standard preparation of the anti @-@ B blood group ser@@ um or a corresponding comparative part against a floo@@ ding of B @-@ blood cells . &quot;
&quot; anti @-@ B ser@@ um is mixed on an object carrier with a same amount of 5 to 10 percent flus@@ hing of B @-@ blood cells , which is necessary when the same attempt is performed with the dissolved International standard preparation of the anti @-@ B blood group ser@@ um or with a standard preparation of the same avi@@ dity . &quot;
anti @-@ A + anti @-@ B ( group 0 ) Ser@@ um is obtained from the blood of selected persons of group 0 which can be immun@@ ised by red blood cells or specific substances of group A and group B .
&quot; anti @-@ A + anti @-@ B ( group 0 ) Ser@@ um ag@@ glut@@ inated human red blood cells that contain ag@@ glut@@ inu@@ genic A and / or B , i.e. those of group A including sub@@ groups A@@ 1@@ b and A@@ 2B ; it ag@@ glut@@ inated no human red blood cells that contain no ag@@ glut@@ inu@@ genic A or B , i.e. those of group 0 . &quot;
it ag@@ glut@@ inated human red blood cells that contain the A@@ x ( A@@ y or A@@ o ) an@@ tigen ( which are generally not ag@@ glut@@ inated by anti @-@ A ser@@ um of blood @-@ giving of the group B ) .
&quot; an anti @-@ A + anti @-@ B ( group 0 ) Ser@@ um is parallel to the dissolved , but un@@ dil@@ uted international standard preparation of the anti @-@ A blood group ser@@ um or a corresponding comparative part , separately against floo@@ ding of A1 and A2 blood cells . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , it is parallel to the dissolved , but un@@ dil@@ uted international standard preparation of the anti @-@ B blood group ser@@ um or a corresponding comparative paper against a flood of B @-@ blood cells . &quot;
the effectiveness of the ser@@ um must in no case be less than 64 international units per ml .
non @-@ dil@@ uted Anti @-@ A + Anti @-@ B ( group 0 ) Blood ser@@ um must likewise cause an easily recogni@@ zable ag@@ glut@@ ination of the blood cells of the group A@@ x ( A@@ y or A@@ o ) .
&quot; an anti @-@ A + anti @-@ B ( group 0 ) Ser@@ um is mixed on an object carrier with equal amounts of 5 to 10 percent floo@@ ding of A1 and A2 blood cells , so the ag@@ glut@@ ination must occur within the double period that is required , but un@@ dil@@ uted international standard preparation of the anti @-@ A blood group ser@@ um or with a standard preparation of the same activity . &quot;
&quot; anti @-@ A + anti @-@ B ( group 0 ) Ser@@ um is mixed to an object carrier with a same amount of 5 to 10 percent flus@@ hing of B @-@ blood cells , which is necessary when the same attempt is performed with the dissolved International standard preparation of the anti @-@ B blood group ser@@ um or a standard preparation of the same avi@@ dity . &quot;
an anti @-@ A + an anti @-@ B ( group 0 ) Ser@@ um on an object carrier with the same amount of 5 to 10 percent of blood cells is mixed so the ag@@ glut@@ ination must occur within 5 minutes at a temperature of 18 to 25 Â° C .
&quot; anti @-@ R@@ h blood group sera each specific@@ ity can be one of two species , which are distinguished by the conditions under which ag@@ glut@@ ination hom@@ olog@@ ous blood cells is achieved . &quot;

the following requirements for the effectiveness of Ser@@ a to determine the R@@ h Group may possibly change if International Standard Prepar@@ ations are available . i ) Anti @-@ D ( Anti @-@ Rh@@ o ) Blood Group ser@@ um ( human )
anti @-@ D ser@@ um is obtained from the blood of one or more people who are immun@@ ised by the an@@ tigen D of the R@@ h system .
&quot; it re@@ acts with human red blood cells that contain the an@@ tigen D , but not with human red blood cells that do not contain the an@@ tigen D . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; complete &quot; &quot; anti @-@ D ser@@ a must have a ti@@ ters of at least 1 : 32 towards C@@ c@@ De@@ e blood cells in a 0.@@ 9@@ percent sal@@ ine solution . &quot;
