this document is a summary of the European Public Service Report ( EP@@ AR ) which explains how the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) has judged the conducted studies to get recommendations regarding the use of the drug .
&quot; if you need more information about your illness or treatment , please read the package insert ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) or contact your doctor or pharmac@@ ist . &quot;
&quot; if you would like more information on the basis of CH@@ MP recommendations , please read the scientific discussion ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) . &quot;
&quot; it is available as a 5 mg , 10 mg , 15 mg and 30 mg tablets , as 10 mg , 15 mg and 30 mg of enam@@ el tablets ( tablets that are dissolved in the mouth ) , as a solution to intake ( 1 mg / ml ) and as an injection solution ( 7,5 mg / ml ) . &quot;
&quot; B. wir@@ res thinking and speaking , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations ( hearing or seeing of things that are not present ) , distr@@ ust and ins@@ an@@ ity ; • bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , a mental illness , in which patients manage man@@ ic epis@@ odes ( periods an@@ or@@ mal high tuning ) with periods of normal mood . &quot;
A@@ bili@@ fy is used to treat moderate to severe man@@ ic epis@@ odes and to prevent man@@ ic epis@@ odes in patients who have addressed the medicine in the past .
&quot; the injection solution is used for rapid monitoring of increased distur@@ b@@ ance or behavi@@ our@@ al distur@@ bances , if the oral intake of the medicine is not possible . &quot;
&quot; in both diseases , the solution can be used for taking one or the enam@@ el tablets in patients , which prepar@@ es the swal@@ lowing of tablets . &quot;
&quot; in patients who take other medicines at the same time , which are exactly as A@@ bili@@ fy , the dose of A@@ bili@@ fy should be adapted . &quot;
&quot; this imp@@ airs the signal transmission between brain cells through &quot; neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ smit@@ ters , &quot; i.e. chemical substances that allow the communication of nerve cells among themselves . &quot;
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l probably mainly acts as a &quot; partial ag@@ on@@ ist &quot; for the recept@@ ors for neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ smit@@ ters dop@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin ( also called ser@@ oton@@ in ) .
&quot; this means that Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l like 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin and dop@@ amine , but in less degree than the neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ smit@@ ters acts to activate the recept@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; da D@@ op@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin play a role in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l contributes to norm@@ alizing the activity of the brain , reducing mental or man@@ ic symptoms and preventing its recur@@ rence . &quot;
A@@ bili@@ fy &apos;s effectiveness to prevent recur@@ rence of symptoms has been studied in three studies for up to one year .
&quot; the efficacy of the injection solution was compared in two studies at 8@@ 05 patients with schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia or similar diseases , which were suffering from stri@@ cken un@@ rest , over a period of two hours with a plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in another study A@@ bili@@ fy was compared to 347 patients with Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol , in another study the efficacy of A@@ bili@@ fy and plac@@ ebo to prevent recur@@ rence of 160 patients , in which the man@@ ic symptoms had already been stabili@@ zed with A@@ bili@@ fy . &quot;
the efficacy of A@@ bili@@ fy injection solution was in a study of 301 patients with bi@@ polar disorder that suffered from stri@@ cken un@@ rest with which Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( another anti @-@ psych@@ otic medication ) and plac@@ ebo compared to a period of two hours .
&quot; in all studies , the change in the patient &apos;s symptoms was examined using a standard scale for bi@@ polar disorder or the number of patients who responded to the treatment . &quot;
the company also conducted studies to investigate how the body res@@ or@@ ted the enam@@ el tablets and the solution to intake .
&quot; in the two studies with the injection solution showed patients who received A@@ bili@@ fy in doses of 5.@@ 25 mg , 9,75 mg or 15 mg , a significantly stronger reduction in symptoms of increased un@@ rest than the patients receiving a plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; when applying for treatment of bi@@ polar disorder , A@@ bili@@ fy decreased in four of the five short @-@ term studies of man@@ ic symptoms more effective than plac@@ ebo . &quot;
A@@ bili@@ fy also prevented the recur@@ rence of man@@ ic epis@@ odes in previously untreated patients up to 74 weeks and if it was also administered to an existing treatment .
A@@ bili@@ fy inj@@ ections in 10@@ - or 15 mg cans also reduced more effective than plac@@ ebo the symptoms increased un@@ rest and were similarly effective as Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am .
&quot; the most common side effects of A@@ bili@@ fy for taking ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are ex@@ trap@@ yram@@ idal distur@@ bances ( un@@ controll@@ able ) , drow@@ sy , nau@@ sea ( drow@@ sin@@ ess ) , s@@ ali@@ va hyper@@ secre@@ tion ( increased s@@ ali@@ va production ) , s@@ ali@@ va hyper@@ secre@@ tion , rest@@ lessness , in@@ som@@ nia ( in@@ som@@ nia ) and anxiety . &quot;
&quot; the Committee on Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that A@@ bili@@ fy &apos;s advantages in treating schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and moderate to severe man@@ ic epis@@ odes in bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , as well as in the prevention of a new man@@ ic episode in patients who mainly talked to the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l , out@@ weigh the risks . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the committee came to the conclusion that the benefits of injection solution in patients with schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia or in patients with man@@ ic epis@@ odes in bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , if oral therapy is not suitable , out@@ weigh the risks . &quot;
&quot; in June 2004 , the European Commission submitted a permit to the company Ot@@ su@@ ka Pharmaceutical Europe Ltd . a permit for the transportation of A@@ bili@@ fy throughout the European Union . &quot;
A@@ bili@@ fy is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe man@@ ic epis@@ odes of bi@@ polar disorder and for the prevention of a new man@@ ic episode in patients who had mainly man@@ ic epis@@ odes and their man@@ ic epis@@ odes on treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l ( see section 5.1 ) .
the recommended starting dose for A@@ bili@@ fy is 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day daily regardless of meals .
increased effectiveness when dos@@ ages over a daily dose of 15 mg has not been proven although individual patients can benefit from a higher dose .
the recommended starting dose for A@@ bili@@ fy is 15 mg once a day regardless of meals as mon@@ otherapy or combination therapy ( see section 5.1 ) .
the efficacy of A@@ bili@@ fy in the treatment of schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar disorder in patients ≥ 65 years has not been proven .
&quot; with regard to the greater sensitivity of this patient group , a lower initial dose should be considered if clinical factors justify this ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; if the C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 in@@ duction is removed from combination therapy , the ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l dose should be reduced to the recommended dose ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
the occurrence of su@@ icide behavior is part of psych@@ otic disorders and aff@@ ective disorder and was reported in some cases after the beginning or after the change of an anti@@ psych@@ otic therapy also in treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l ( see section 4.8 ) .
results of an epide@@ mi@@ ological study showed that in patients with bi@@ polar disorder there was no increased su@@ icide risk associated with ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l compared to other anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics .
&quot; Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l should be used with care in patients with known cardiovascular disease ( m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction , cardi@@ ac in@@ suffici@@ ency , cardi@@ ac in@@ suffici@@ ency , hyper@@ tension , treatment with blood pressure lowering medicines ) or hyper@@ tension ( including ac@@ zel@@ er@@ ated and mal@@ ign@@ ant form ) . &quot;
&quot; 3 Sp@@ ät@@ dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical trials , which lasted a year or less , there were occasional reports on during treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l appearing dy@@ sk@@ in@@ etry . &quot;
&quot; if patients treated with A@@ bili@@ fy , signs and symptoms of a late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ etry should be considered , should be considered to reduce the dose or break the treatment . &quot;
&quot; if a patient develops signs and symptoms that indicate to a m@@ ns , or has uncle@@ ar high fever without an additional clinical manifestation of m@@ ns , all anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , including A@@ bili@@ fy , must be removed . &quot;
&quot; therefore , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l should be used in patients with sei@@ zur@@ es in an@@ am@@ nes@@ ia or at conditions related to sei@@ zur@@ es in connection with caution . &quot;
&quot; 56 - 99 years ) with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l in patients with psycho@@ sis who are associated with Alzheimer &apos;s disease , had patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l , an increased risk of death compared to plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; however , there was in one of these studies , a study with fixed dosage , a significant relationship between dosage and response to unwanted cer@@ eb@@ rov@@ ascular events with ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l treated patients . &quot;
&quot; hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia , in some cases extremely and associated with k@@ eto@@ aci@@ do@@ sis or hyper@@ os@@ mol@@ ar coma or death , was reported in patients treated with at@@ yp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic agents , including A@@ bili@@ fy . &quot;
there are no exact risk ass@@ essments for hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia @-@ related unwanted events with A@@ bili@@ fy and other at@@ yp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic agents treated patients who allow direct compar@@ isons .
&quot; poly@@ di@@ p@@ sy , poly@@ carbonate , poly@@ ph@@ ag@@ ia and weakness ) are observed and patients with diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or with risk factors for diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus should be monitored regularly regarding a deteri@@ oration of glucose levels . &quot;
&quot; weight gain is generally observed in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ic patients and in patients with bi@@ polar Man@@ ia because of com@@ or@@ bi@@ di@@ ties , the use of anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics where weight gain is known as side effects , or an un@@ healthy lifestyle and could lead to serious complications . &quot;
&quot; due to the primary effect of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l on the central nervous system , caution is advised if Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l is used in combination with alcohol or other central effective medicines with out@@ lying side effects such as sed@@ ation ( see section 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; the H2 @-@ antagon@@ ist Fam@@ oti@@ din , a gast@@ ric acid blo@@ cker , reduces the res@@ or@@ ption rate of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l , but this effect is considered clin@@ ically not relevant . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical trial with healthy volunteers , a highly effective C@@ YP@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ or ( Ch@@ ini@@ dine ) increased the AU@@ C of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l by 107 % , while the C@@ MA@@ x remained unchanged . &quot;
&quot; it is expected that other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ YP@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 , such as flu@@ ox@@ et@@ ine and par@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , have similar effects and therefore should be made similar dose reduc@@ tions . &quot;
&quot; with C@@ YP@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 &apos; bad &apos; ( = &quot; poor &quot; ) metabol@@ is@@ ers , the common application with highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 in higher plasma concentrations of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l results in compared to C@@ YP@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 extensive metabol@@ is@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; considering the common gift of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole or other highly effective C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors with A@@ bili@@ fy , the potential benefits should prevail for the patient . &quot;
other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 such as it@@ rac@@ on@@ az@@ ole and HIV prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors are likely to have similar effects and therefore similar dose reduc@@ tions should be made .
&quot; after placing the C@@ YP@@ 2@@ D@@ 6@@ - or 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ or , A@@ bili@@ fy dosage should be lifted to the dose height prior to the start of the accompanying therapy . &quot;
dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em or Esc@@ ital@@ op@@ ram ) or C@@ YP@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 together with A@@ bili@@ fy can be calculated with a moderate increase in Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - concentrations .
&quot; in clinical studies , doses of 10 @-@ 30 mg Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l per day showed no significant effect on metabolism of the sub@@ str@@ ates of C@@ YP@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 ( dex@@ tro@@ meth@@ orph@@ an / 3 @-@ metho@@ xy@@ morph@@ in@@ an ratio ) , 2@@ C@@ 19 ( Om@@ ep@@ ra@@ zo@@ l ) and 3@@ A4 ( dex@@ tro@@ meth@@ orph@@ an ) . &quot;
patients should be advised to notify their doctor if they are pregnant or plan a pregnancy during treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l .
&quot; due to the insufficient data situation for human beings and due to the concerns caused in reproductive studies at the animal , this drug may not be applied in pregnancy unless the potential benefits justi@@ fies the potential risk of fet@@ us . &quot;
&quot; however , as with other anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics patients should be warned against dangerous machines , including motor vehicles , until they are certain that Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l has no negative influence . &quot;
the following side effects occurred more frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) compared to plac@@ ebo or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects ( * ) :
&quot; the incidence of the following side effects is defined according to the following criteria : frequent ( &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( &gt; 1 / 1.000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) . &quot;
&quot; Schizophren@@ ia - In a controlled long term study of 52 weeks in patients suffering from Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l , a total lower incidence ( 25.@@ 8 % ) of EPS , including Park@@ in@@ son@@ ism , Ak@@ ath@@ omed , D@@ yst@@ onie and Dy@@ sk@@ in@@ etry , compared to patients treated with Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol ( 5@@ 7.3 % ) . &quot;
in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled long term study over 26 weeks the incidence of EPS 19 % was in patients suffering from Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l treatment and 13.@@ 1 % in patients under plac@@ ebo .
&quot; in another controlled long term study of 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS 14.@@ 8 % in patients treated with ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l was 15.@@ 1 % in patients under O@@ lan@@ z@@ ap@@ in therapy . &quot;
man@@ ic epis@@ odes in bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder - in a controlled trial of 12 weeks the incidence of EPS 23.@@ 5 % was in patients suffering from Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 5@@ 3.3 % in patients under Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol treatment .
in another study of 12 weeks the incidence of EPS 26.@@ 6 % in patients with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l treatment and 17.@@ 6 % for those under lithium @-@ treatment .
in the long @-@ term maintenance period more than 26 weeks in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled trial the incidence of EPS 18.@@ 2 % for patients suffering from Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 15.@@ 7 % for plac@@ ebo treated patients .
&quot; a comparison between the patient groups under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l and plac@@ ebo , in which potentially clin@@ ically significant changes in rout@@ inely controlled laboratory parameters occurred , showed no medi@@ cally significant differences . &quot;
&quot; increased CP@@ K ( cre@@ atine @-@ ph@@ osp@@ ho@@ kin@@ ase ) , generally temporary and asy@@ mpt@@ om@@ atic , were observed in 3.5 % of patients treated with ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l compared to 2.0 % of patients treated with plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; the side effects associated with an anti @-@ psych@@ otic therapy are the mal@@ ign@@ ant neuro@@ le@@ p@@ tic syndrome , sp@@ ät@@ dy@@ sp@@ ine@@ tic events and increased mort@@ ality in older demen@@ tia patients , hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials and since the launch of the market , un@@ inten@@ tional or deliber@@ ate acute over@@ dose with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l alone is observed in adult patients with estimated doses of up to 12@@ 60 mg and without death sequence . &quot;
&quot; although there is no information about the effectiveness of a hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis in the treatment of an over@@ dose with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l , it is unlikely that ha@@ em@@ aly@@ sis is beneficial in the treatment of over@@ dosage as Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l has a high plasma rotation . &quot;
it is assumed that the efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l is medi@@ ated in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder about the combination of a partial agon@@ ist effect on dop@@ amine D@@ 2- and ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ a- recept@@ ors and an antagon@@ istic effect on ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2a recept@@ ors .
&quot; in vitro , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l showed a high aff@@ inity to the dop@@ amine D@@ 2- and D3 recep@@ tor as well as an even aff@@ inity to the dop@@ amine D@@ 4- , for ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2@@ c@@ - and 5@@ HT@@ 7@@ - , for alpha @-@ 1 @-@ adren@@ ergi@@ c and for hi@@ stam@@ ine @-@ H@@ 1@@ recep@@ tor . &quot;
&quot; with the gift of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l in dos@@ ages of 0.5 to 30 mg once daily over 2 weeks of healthy volunteers , the Pos@@ it@@ ron emission tom@@ ography showed a dose @-@ dependent reduction in the binding of 11@@ C rac@@ lo@@ pri@@ d , a D2 / D3 recep@@ tor lig@@ ands , at nucle@@ us cau@@ dat@@ us and at the put@@ amen . &quot;
&quot; in three plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled short @-@ term studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) to 1,@@ 228 schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ic patients with positive or negative symptoms , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l showed a statisti@@ cally significant improvement in psych@@ otic symptoms compared to plac@@ ebo . &quot;
in a Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol @-@ controlled trial in week 52 the proportion of respon@@ der patients receiving a response to study medi@@ ation was similar in both groups ( Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l 77 % and Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol 73 % ) .
&quot; current values from measuring scales defined as secondary study objectives , including PAN@@ SS and the Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery As@@ berg@@ - Dep@@ res@@ sion rates scale , showed a significantly greater improvement than at Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol . &quot;
&quot; in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled trial over 26 weeks of stabili@@ zed patients with chronic z@@ ophren@@ ia , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l showed a significantly higher reduction in the return rate , which was 34 % in the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l group and 57 % below plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in an O@@ lan@@ z@@ ap@@ in controlled , multinational double blind study in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia more than 26 weeks , the 314 patients included a weight gain of at least 7 % compared to the initial value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.6 kg ) with an average weight of approx . &quot;
&quot; in two plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy studies with flexible dosing over 3 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of bi@@ polar I disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l showed superior efficacy in reducing man@@ ic symptoms over 3 weeks . &quot;
in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy study over 3 weeks with fixed dosage with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of bi@@ polar I disorder Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l showed no superior efficacy compared to plac@@ ebo .
&quot; in two plac@@ ebo and actively controlled mon@@ otherapy studies for 12 weeks in patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar I disorder , with or without psych@@ otic characteristics , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l showed superior efficacy in week 3 and a conservation effect that was comparable to that of lithium or Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol in week 12 . &quot;
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l also showed a comparable proportion of patients with sy@@ mpt@@ om@@ atic re@@ mission of the Man@@ ia as lithium or semi @-@ i@@ dol in week 12 .
&quot; in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled trial for 6 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar I disorder , with or without psych@@ otic characteristics , which sometimes referred to lithium or val@@ pro@@ ate mon@@ otherapy in therapeutic ser@@ um mirrors , the companion therapy with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l showed superior efficacy in reducing man@@ ic symptoms compared to mon@@ otherapy with lithium or val@@ pro@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; 10 In a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled trial for 26 weeks followed by a long @-@ term extension period over 74 weeks in man@@ ic patients who had reached a re@@ mission with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l during a stabili@@ zation phase , mainly in preventing a bi@@ polar return , mainly in the prevention of a bi@@ polar return . &quot;
&quot; based on in vitro studies , the enzymes C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 and C@@ YP@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 are responsible for the Deh@@ ydr@@ ation and Hydro@@ xy@@ isation of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l , the N @-@ De@@ al@@ ky@@ ation is cataly@@ zed by C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 . &quot;
the average Eli@@ mination of Eli@@ mination is approximately 75 hours for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l for extensive metabol@@ ites using C@@ YP@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and approximately 146 hours in &apos; bad &apos; ( = &quot; poor &quot; ) metabol@@ is@@ ers via C@@ YP@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 .
&quot; in Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l there are no differences in pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics between male and female healthy subjects , as well as a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic investigation of schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ic patients no gender @-@ dependent effects . &quot;
a Pop@@ ulations @-@ specific evaluation for pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics showed no indication of clin@@ ically significant differences regarding ethnic origin or the effect of smoking on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l and Deh@@ ydr@@ o @-@ Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l were similar in patients with severe kidney failure compared to young healthy volunteers .
&quot; a single dose study in subjects with different liver cir@@ rho@@ sis ( Child @-@ P@@ ugh Class A , B and C ) showed no significant effect in the depression of the liver function on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l and Deh@@ ydr@@ o @-@ Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l , but the study included only 3 patients with cir@@ rho@@ sis of the class C , which is not sufficient to draw conclusions on their met@@ abolic capacity . &quot;
&quot; based on conventional studies on the safety har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated administration , reproduction toxic@@ ity , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and the car@@ cin@@ ogen@@ ic potential the prec@@ lin@@ ical data could not be identified for human beings . &quot;
&quot; toxic@@ ologically significant effects were only observed in dos@@ ages or ex@@ positions , which significantly exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure to humans , so they have limited or no significance for clinical application . &quot;
effects included a dose @-@ dependent side @-@ level toxic@@ ity ( Li@@ po@@ f@@ us@@ cin @-@ pigment @-@ accumulation and / or par@@ ench@@ y@@ m@@ ary loss ) in rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg / kg / day ( the 10@@ fold of the middle Ste@@ ady State Exposition ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended maximum dose in humans ) .
&quot; in addition , a chol@@ eli@@ asis was detected as a result of the precip@@ itation of sulph@@ ate con@@ jug@@ ates of the hydro@@ xy@@ - metabol@@ ites of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l in the bile from 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( 1 to 3 times of the recommended maximum dose of humans based on mg / m2 ) . &quot;
&quot; however , the concentrations found in human G@@ alle at the highest recommended daily dose of 30 mg found concentrations of the sulph@@ ate con@@ jug@@ ate of Hydro@@ xy@@ - Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l are not more than 6 % of concentrations found in the study over 39 weeks in the G@@ alle of apes , and are far below the limit values ( 6 % ) of the in vitro solu@@ bility . &quot;
&quot; rab@@ bits were observed after dos@@ ages , which led to ex@@ positions of the 3- and 11@@ fold of the mean steady @-@ state AU@@ C in the recommended clinical Maxim@@ al dose . &quot;

the recommended starting dose for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l amounts to 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day daily regardless of meals .
patients who have difficulty swal@@ lowing A@@ bili@@ fy tablets can take the melting tablets alternative to A@@ bili@@ fy tablets ( see section 5.2 ) .
the occurrence of su@@ icide behavior belongs to psych@@ otic disorders and aff@@ ective disorder has been reported in some cases after the beginning or after changing an anti@@ psych@@ otic therapy . also in treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l ( see section 4.8 ) .

&quot; in an O@@ lan@@ z@@ ap@@ in controlled , multinational double blind study in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia more than 26 weeks , the 314 patients included a weight gain of at least 7 % compared to the initial value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.6 kg ) with an average weight of approx . &quot;
97 In a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy study over 3 weeks with fixed dosage with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of bi@@ polar I disorder Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l showed no superior efficacy against plac@@ ebo .
&quot; in a relative bio@@ availability study , in which the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of 30 mg Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l was compared to the intake of 30 mg Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l in tablet form for healthy volunteers , the ratio between the geometric C@@ MA@@ x mean value of the solution and the value of the tablets was 122 % ( N = 30 ) . &quot;

A@@ bili@@ fy In@@ j@@ ection solution is used to quickly control the sor@@ eness and behavior in patients with schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia or in patients with man@@ ic epis@@ odes of bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder if oral therapy is not appropriate .
&quot; once it is clin@@ ically appropriate , treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l injection solution should be terminated and started with the oral application of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l . &quot;
&quot; to increase the res@@ or@@ ption and minimize the vari@@ ability , an injection into the M. del@@ to@@ ide@@ us or deep into the glut@@ eus maxim@@ us muscle is recommended under Um@@ geh@@ ung of adi@@ p@@ ous regions . &quot;
a lower dose of 5.@@ 25 mg ( 0.7 ml ) can be given depending on individual clinical status considering the medicines used already for maintenance or acute therapy ( see section 4.5 ) .
&quot; if a further oral treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l is indicated , see the summary of the characteristics of the medicine to A@@ bili@@ fy tablets , A@@ bili@@ fy enam@@ el tablets or A@@ bili@@ fy solution . &quot;
there are no investigations on the efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l injection solution in patients with cognitive and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders that were different from schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and man@@ ic epis@@ odes of bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder .
&quot; if a par@@ enter@@ al therapy with ben@@ zo@@ di@@ az@@ ep@@ ines is considered necessary in addition to the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l injection solution , patients should be observed with regard to extreme sed@@ ation or blood pressure drops ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
investigations on the safety and efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l injection solution are not available for patients with alcohol or drug poison@@ ing ( by prescribed or illegal drugs ) .
&quot; Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l should be used with care in patients with known cardiovascular disease ( m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction , cardi@@ ac in@@ suffici@@ ency , cardi@@ ac in@@ suffici@@ ency , hyper@@ tension , treatment with blood pressure lowering medicines ) or hyper@@ tension ( including ac@@ zel@@ er@@ ated and mal@@ ign@@ ant form ) . &quot;
&quot; late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical trials , which lasted a year or less , there were occasional reports of dy@@ sk@@ in@@ etry occurring during treatment using Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l . &quot;
&quot; clinical manifest@@ ations of a brain are high fever , muscle sti@@ ff@@ ness , changing consciousness layers and signs of autonomous inst@@ ability ( irregular pulse or blood pressure , t@@ ach@@ y@@ kar@@ das , swe@@ ating and heart rhythm disorders ) . &quot;
&quot; poly@@ di@@ p@@ sy , poly@@ carbonate , poly@@ ph@@ ag@@ ia and weakness ) are observed and patients with diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or with risk factors for diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus should regularly be monitored regarding a deteri@@ oration of glucose levels . &quot;
&quot; a weight gain is generally observed in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ic patients and patients with bi@@ polar Man@@ ia due to com@@ or@@ bi@@ di@@ ties , the use of anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , where weight gain is known as side effect or an un@@ healthy lifestyle and could lead to serious complications . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , the intensity of the sed@@ ation was greater compared to that after all the gift of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l , in a study where healthy volunteers Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l ( 15 mg dose ) were in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular and which at the same time received Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( 2 mg dose ) in@@ tram@@ us@@ cul@@ arly . &quot;
&quot; 105 The H2 @-@ antagon@@ ist Fam@@ oti@@ din , a gast@@ ric acid blo@@ cker , reduces the absorption rate of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l , but this effect is considered clin@@ ically not relevant . &quot;
&quot; compared to C@@ YP@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 &apos; bad &apos; ( = &quot; poor &quot; ) metabol@@ is@@ ers , the common application with highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 can result in higher plasma concentrations of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l . &quot;
other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 such as it@@ rac@@ on@@ az@@ ole and HI@@ V@@ - prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors are likely to have similar effects and therefore similar dose reduc@@ tions should be made .
&quot; after placing the C@@ YP@@ 2@@ D@@ 6@@ - or 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ or , A@@ bili@@ fy dosage should be lifted to the dose height prior to the start of the accompanying therapy . &quot;
&quot; 106 Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( 2 mg dose ) in@@ tram@@ us@@ cul@@ arly received , the intensity of the sed@@ ation was greater compared to that after the sole administration of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l . &quot;
the following side effects occurred in clinical trials with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l injection solution more frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than under plac@@ ebo or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant side @-@ effects ( * ) ( see section 5.1 ) :
&quot; the incidence of the following side effects is defined according to the following criteria : common ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1.000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) . &quot;
107 The following side effects occurred more frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than plac@@ ebo or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant side @-@ effects ( * ) in clinical trials ( see section 5.1 ) :
in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled long term study over 26 weeks the incidence of EPS 19 % was in patients suffering from Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 13.@@ 1 % in patients under plac@@ ebo .
in another study of 12 weeks the incidence of EPS 26.@@ 6 % in patients with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 17.@@ 6 % for those under lithium @-@ treatment .
in the long @-@ term maintenance period more than 26 weeks in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled trial the incidence of EPS 18.@@ 2 % for patients suffering from Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l treatment and 15.@@ 7 % for plac@@ ebo treated patients .
&quot; a comparison between the patient groups under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l and plac@@ ebo , in which potentially clin@@ ically significant changes in rout@@ inely controlled laboratory parameters occurred , showed no medi@@ cally significant differences . &quot;
&quot; increased CP@@ K ( cre@@ at@@ in@@ ph@@ osp@@ ho@@ kin@@ ase ) , generally temporary and asy@@ mpt@@ om@@ atic , were observed in 3.5 % of patients treated with ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l compared to 2.0 % of patients treated with plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; the side effects associated with an anti @-@ psych@@ otic therapy are the mal@@ ign@@ ant neuro@@ le@@ p@@ tic syndrome , sp@@ ät@@ dy@@ sp@@ ine@@ tic events and increased mort@@ ality in older demen@@ tia patients , hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
110 and behavi@@ our@@ al distur@@ bances were the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l injection solution with statisti@@ cally significant improvements of Agi@@ on and behavior disorders compared to plac@@ ebo and was similar to Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol .
&quot; in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled short @-@ term study ( 24 h ) with 291 patients with bi@@ polar disorder and sor@@ eness and behavi@@ our@@ al distur@@ bances , the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l injection solution was associated with a statisti@@ cally significant improvement in symptoms associated with plac@@ ebo and similar to the Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am@@ - reference arm . &quot;
&quot; the mean improvement from the initial value on the PAN@@ SS Ex@@ cit@@ ement Compon@@ ent score was 5.8 for plac@@ ebo , 9,@@ 6 for Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am and 8,@@ 7 for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l . &quot;
&quot; in analyses of sub @-@ groups in patients with mixed epis@@ odes or patients with severe frag@@ ility , a similar effectiveness has been observed in relation to the overall population , but a statistical Sig@@ ni@@ fi@@ can@@ z could be determined because of a reduced patient number . &quot;
&quot; in three plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled short @-@ term studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) to 1,@@ 228 schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ic patients with positive or negative symptoms , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l ( oral ) showed a statisti@@ cally significant improvement in psych@@ otic symptoms compared to plac@@ ebo . &quot;
in a Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol @-@ controlled trial in week 52 the proportion of respon@@ der patients receiving a response to study medi@@ ation was similar in both groups ( Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l 77 % ( oral ) and Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol 73 % ) .
&quot; current values from measuring scales defined as secondary study objectives , including PAN@@ SS and the Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery As@@ berg Dep@@ res@@ sion rates scale , showed significantly greater improvement than at Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol . &quot;
&quot; in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled trial over 26 weeks of stabili@@ zed patients with chronic z@@ ophren@@ ia , a significantly higher reduction in the return rate , which was at 34 % in the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - ( oral ) group and 57 % below plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in an O@@ lan@@ z@@ ap@@ in controlled , multinational double blind study in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia more than 26 weeks , the 314 patients included a weight gain of at least 7 % compared to the initial value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.6 kg ) with an average weight of approx . &quot;
&quot; 111 In a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled trial for 6 weeks with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , with or without psych@@ otic characteristics , which sometimes referred to lithium or val@@ pro@@ ate mon@@ otherapy in therapeutic ser@@ um mirrors , the companion therapy with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l showed superior efficacy in reducing man@@ ic symptoms compared to mon@@ otherapy with lithium or val@@ pro@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study of 26 weeks followed by a 74 @-@ week study extension in man@@ ic patients who had achieved a re@@ mission with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l during a stabili@@ zation phase before Rand@@ om@@ ization , the treatment of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l was superior to the prevention of a bi@@ polar return . &quot;
the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l AU@@ C is in the first 2 hours after in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular injection 90 % greater the AU@@ C after giving the same dose as tablet ; the system@@ ic exposure was similar between the two form@@ ulations .
&quot; in 2 studies with healthy volunteers , the average time has to be reached until reaching the maximum plasma level in 1 to 3 hours . &quot;
&quot; the gift of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l injection solution was well toler@@ ated by rats and monkeys and resulted in no direct toxic@@ ity of a target organ after repeated gift at a system@@ ic exposure ( AU@@ C ) , the 15 and 5 times above the maximum human therapeutic exposure of 30 mg in@@ tram@@ us@@ cul@@ arly . &quot;
&quot; in studies on reproductive toxic@@ ity after intra@@ ven@@ ous application no safety @-@ relevant concerns resulted in mat@@ ernal exposure , the 15@@ - ( rats ) and 29 times ( rab@@ bits ) above the maximum human therapeutic exposure of 30 mg . &quot;
&quot; based on conventional studies with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l ( oral ) for the safety har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated administration , reproduction toxic@@ ity , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and the car@@ cin@@ ogen@@ ic potential the prec@@ lin@@ ical data could not be identified for human beings . &quot;
toxic@@ ologically significant effects were only observed in dos@@ ages or ex@@ positions which significantly exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure to humans ; thus they have limited or no importance for clinical application .
effects included a dose @-@ dependent side @-@ level toxic@@ ity ( Li@@ po@@ f@@ us@@ cin @-@ pigment @-@ accumulation and / or par@@ ench@@ y@@ m@@ ary loss ) in rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg / kg / day ( equivalent to 10 times of mean steady @-@ state exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended maximum dose in humans ) .
&quot; in addition , a chol@@ eli@@ asis was detected as a result of precip@@ itation of sulph@@ ate con@@ jug@@ ates of the hydro@@ xy@@ - metabol@@ ites of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l in the bile from 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( 1 to 3 times of the recommended maximum dose in humans based on mg / m2 ) . &quot;

&quot; the efficacy of Abra@@ x@@ ane was studied in a major study , participated in 460 women with metastatic breast cancer , of which three quarters previously had been an anth@@ rac@@ y@@ c@@ line . &quot;
the effect of Abra@@ x@@ ane ( in sole administration or mon@@ otherapy ) was compared with the drug containing a conventional pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el ( given in combination with other medicines to reduce side effects ) .
&quot; in total , 72 ( 31 % ) of 229 patients treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane responded to treatment , compared to 37 ( 16 % ) of 225 patients receiving conventional pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el . &quot;
&quot; if only patients who were treated for metastatic breast cancer for the first time , there was no difference between the efficacy indicators such as time to deteri@@ oration of disease and survival . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , patients who had previously received other treatments of their metastatic breast cancer showed that Abra@@ x@@ ane was more effective than conventional pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el . &quot;
&quot; it may also not be applied to patients who are breast@@ feeding , or have low neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ils in the blood before the treatment begins . &quot;
&quot; the Committee on Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) stated that Abra@@ x@@ ane was no longer any more effective than conventional pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el , and that in contrast to other pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el , medicines do not have to be given with other medicines to reduce side effects . &quot;
&quot; in January 2008 , the European Commission issued a permit for the company Abra@@ xis Bio@@ Science Limited for the launch of Abra@@ x@@ ane in the entire European Union . &quot;
&quot; Abra@@ x@@ ane mon@@ otherapy is indicated for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer in patients in which the first @-@ line treatment for metastatic disease is missing , and for which a standard anth@@ rac@@ y@@ c@@ line @-@ containing therapy is not indicated ( see also Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients with severe neut@@ ro@@ pen@@ ia ( neut@@ ro@@ phy@@ sic value &lt; 0,50 x 109 / l over a period of one week or longer ) or he@@ avier sensory neu@@ rop@@ athy during the Abra@@ x@@ ane therapy , the dose should be reduced to 220 mg / m2 in the following series . &quot;
&quot; in case of sensory neu@@ rop@@ athy grade 3 , treatment is to be interrupted until a recovery is reached on degree 1 or 2 , and in all subsequent cycles the dose must be reduced . &quot;
there is currently no adequate data for the recommendation of dosage adjustments in patients with mild to moderate depression of the liver function ( see section 4.@@ 4. and 5.2 ) .
there were no studies carried out with patients with imp@@ aired ren@@ al function and there is currently no adequate data for the recommendation of dose adjustments in patients with imp@@ air@@ ment of kidney function ( see section 5.2 ) .
&quot; Abra@@ x@@ ane is not recommended for use in children under 18 years of age , due to insufficient data concerning harm@@ lessness and efficacy . &quot;
&quot; Abra@@ x@@ ane is an alb@@ um@@ in bonded nano @-@ artic@@ ulation of pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el , which could have substantially different pharmac@@ ological characteristics than other form@@ ulations of pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el ( see section 5.1 and 5.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; if an allergic reaction occurs , the medicine should be immediately removed and a sy@@ mpt@@ om@@ atic treatment should be initiated and the patient must not be treated with pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el again . &quot;
&quot; in patients , no new abrasion treatment cycles should be initiated until the neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ic@@ ity increased again &gt; 1.5 x 109 / l , and the thro@@ m@@ bo@@ cy@@ tic count increased again to &gt; 100 x 109 / l . &quot;
patients with severe liver function disorders ( bili@@ ru@@ bin &gt; 5 x UL@@ N or AS@@ L / AL@@ T &gt; 10 x UL@@ N ) should not be treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane .
&quot; during a clearly identified cardi@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity in connection with Abra@@ x@@ ane , cardi@@ ac inci@@ dents are not un@@ common in the indicated patient lesson , especially in patients with earlier anth@@ rac@@ y@@ c@@ line treatment or underlying heart or lung disease . &quot;
&quot; if patients after the treatment of Abra@@ x@@ ane nau@@ sea , v@@ om@@ iting and di@@ arr@@ ho@@ ea , they can be treated with the usual anti@@ em@@ etic and con@@ sti@@ p@@ ating methods . &quot;
&quot; Abra@@ x@@ ane should not be applied in pregnant women or women in chil@@ d@@ bearing age , which do not practice effective contrac@@ eption , except the treatment of the mother with pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is inevitable . &quot;
women in chil@@ d@@ bearing age should use a reliable contrac@@ ep@@ tive method during and up to 1 month after the treatment with Abra@@ x@@ ane .
male patients who are treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane is advised to bear no child during and up to six months after treatment .
&quot; male patients should be advised against the treatment of a sperm count , since the treatment with Abra@@ x@@ ane is the possibility of ir@@ reversible in@@ fertility . &quot;
abra@@ x@@ ane can cause side effects such as ti@@ red@@ ness ( very frequent ) and di@@ zz@@ iness ( frequent ) that can affect the traffic and the ability to serve machines .
&quot; below are the most common and most significant inci@@ dents of adverse events performed in 229 patients with metastatic breast cancer , which were treated once every three weeks with 260 mg / m2 abra@@ x@@ ane once every three weeks . &quot;
neut@@ ro@@ pen@@ ie was the most con@@ spic@@ uous important hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity ( reported in 79 % of patients ) and was quickly reversible and dose @-@ dependent ; leu@@ kop@@ enia was reported in 71 % of patients .
an@@ emia ( H@@ b &lt; 10 g / dl ) was observed in 46 % of patients treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane and was severe in three cases ( H@@ b &lt; 8 g / dl ) .
&quot; in Table 1 , the side effects mentioned in connection with the gift of Abra@@ x@@ ane as mon@@ otherapy occurred at each dose and indication in studies ( N = 789 ) . &quot;
&quot; often ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1.000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) ; rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1.000 ) ; very rare ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) . &quot;

pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is an anti@@ mi@@ kr@@ ot@@ u@@ bul@@ i agent that promotes the accumulation of mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules from the tu@@ b@@ ules and stabil@@ ises the mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules by in@@ hibition of their de@@ poly@@ meri@@ zation .
this stabili@@ zation leads to in@@ hibition of the normal dynamic re@@ organisation of the mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ular network which is essential for the vital inter@@ phase and the mit@@ otic cell functions .
it is known that alb@@ um@@ in convey@@ s the trans@@ cy@@ t@@ sis of plasma components into the end@@ othel@@ ial cells and in the framework of in @-@ vitro studies it has been proven that the presence of alb@@ um@@ in promotes the transport of pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el through the end@@ othel@@ ial cells .
it is assumed that this improved tran@@ sen@@ dot@@ hel@@ i@@ al transport is medi@@ ated by the g@@ p @-@ 60 alb@@ umin@@ escence recep@@ tor and occurs due to the alb@@ umin@@ ous protein aci@@ dic rich in c@@ yst@@ eine ) a pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el accumulation in the area of the tumour .
the application of Abra@@ x@@ ane for metastatic breast cancer is supported by data of 106 patients in two armed un@@ related studies and 454 patients treated in a random@@ ised Phase III comparative study .
&quot; in a study , 43 patients with metastatic breast cancer are treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane , which was given in the form of an in@@ fusion of about 30 minutes with a dose of 175 mg / m2 . &quot;
&quot; in the second study , a dose of 300 mg / m2 was used as in@@ fusion for 30 minutes to 63 patients with metastatic breast cancer . &quot;
&quot; this multi @-@ centric study was performed in patients with metastatic breast cancer , who received a mon@@ otherapy with pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el , either in the form of solvent containing pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el 175 mg / m2 as a 3 @-@ hour in@@ fusion with pre@@ medi@@ ation for preventing an allergic reaction ( N = 225 ) or in the form of Abra@@ x@@ ane 260 mg / m2 as 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion without pre@@ medi@@ ation ( N = 229 ) . &quot;
&quot; in the study , 64 % of patients had an imp@@ aired general condition ( ECO@@ G 1 or 2 ) , 79 % had vis@@ cer@@ al metast@@ ases and 76 % had more than 3 met@@ ast@@ ases . &quot;
&quot; 14 % of patients had not received chemotherapy before , 27 % had only a adju@@ v@@ ant chemotherapy , 40 % only because of metast@@ asis and 19 % because of metast@@ asis and adju@@ v@@ ant treatment . &quot;
&quot; 9 Results for the general response rate and time to progression of the disease , as well as progression @-@ free survival and survival for patients receiving &gt; First @-@ Line therapy are explained below . &quot;
neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity compared to pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el was evaluated by the improvement of a degree for patients who lived at a time during therapy a peripher@@ al neu@@ rop@@ athy grade 3 .
the natural course of peripher@@ al neu@@ rop@@ athy to sound on bas@@ eline due to the cum@@ ulative toxic@@ ity of Abra@@ x@@ ane after &gt; 6 treatment courses has not been evaluated and is still unknown .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of the overall pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el after 30@@ - and 180 @-@ minute in@@ fusion of Abra@@ x@@ ane with a dose of 80 to 375 mg / m2 was determined in clinical trials .
the active substance exposure ( AU@@ C ) increased linear from 26@@ 53 to 16@@ 7@@ 36 n@@ g.@@ h / ml analog to a dose of 80 to 300 mg / m2 .
10 After intra@@ ven@@ ous administration of Abra@@ x@@ ane to patients with metastatic breast cancer in the recommended clinical dose of 260 mg / m2 the pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el plasma concentration decreased in a multi@@ phase way .
the mean distribution volume was 6@@ 32 l / m2 ; the high distribution volume points to a far @-@ reaching ex@@ trav@@ ascular distribution and / or crossover binding of pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
in a study involving patients with advanced solid tum@@ ours the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el were compared with intra@@ ven@@ ous 30 minutes intra@@ ven@@ ous 30 minutes intra@@ ven@@ ous injection of 175 mg / m2 of solvent containing pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
&quot; the Clear@@ ance of Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el was higher after the Abra@@ x@@ ane @-@ Gift ( 43 % ) than after a solvent containing pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el injection , and also the distribution volume was higher at Abra@@ x@@ ane ( 53 % ) . &quot;
in the published literature on in @-@ vitro studies of human liver micro@@ some and tissue history reports that pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is primarily met@@ ab@@ oli@@ zed to 6@@ α -@@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el and two smaller metabol@@ ites ( 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el and 6@@ α -3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ D@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el ) .
&quot; after a 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion of 260 mg / m2 of patients with metastatic breast cancer , the mean value for cum@@ ulative urine ex@@ cre@@ tion of the unchanged active ingredient was 4 % of the total dose with less than 1 % of the metabol@@ ites 6@@ α -@@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el and 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el , which indicates a far @-@ reaching non @-@ ren@@ al Clear@@ ance . &quot;
&quot; however , only a few data is available for patients aged over 75 years , as only 3 patients of this age group participated in the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic analysis . &quot;
the chemical and physical stability was detected at 2 ° C - 8 ° C in the original box and in front of bright light protected over 8 hours .

&quot; this means that Ab@@ se@@ amed is similar to a biological medicine , which is already approved in the European Union ( EU ) and contains the same ingredient ( also called &quot; reference drug &quot; ) . &quot;
&quot; it is used in patients with normal blood @-@ iron values that might occur in connection with blood trans@@ fusion complications , if a blood loss is not possible before the procedure and where a blood loss of 900 to 1 800 ml can be expected . &quot;
the treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed must be introduced under the supervision of a physician who has experience in the treatment of patients with diseases for which the medicine is indicated .
&quot; in patients with kidney problems and in patients who want to make a blood donation , Ab@@ se@@ amed is inj@@ ected into a v@@ ein . &quot;
&quot; injection can also be carried out by the patient or his super@@ visor , provided that they have an appropriate guidance . &quot;
patients with chronic ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency and patients receiving chemotherapy should always lie in the recommended area ( between 10 and 12 grams per dec@@ il@@ iter in adults or between 9.5 and 11 g / dl in children ) .
the iron values of all patients must be checked before the treatment to ensure that there is no iron deficiency and iron supplements should be administered during the entire treatment .
&quot; in patients receiving chemotherapy , or in patients with kidney problems , an@@ emia can be caused by er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ i@@ etal deficiency or that the body does not adequ@@ ately respond to the body &apos;s own er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin . &quot;
&quot; er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin is also applied before surgery to increase the number of red blood cells , thereby reducing the consequences of blood loss . &quot;
&quot; it is produced by a cell , into which a gene ( DNA ) has been introduced , which it conduc@@ ts to the formation of ep@@ ep@@ tin al@@ fa . &quot;
&quot; Ab@@ se@@ amed was administered as an injection into a v@@ ein within the framework of a major study involving 479 patients who suffered an@@ a@@ emia caused by kidney problems , compared with the reference drug . &quot;
all patients participating in this study had been inj@@ ected at least eight weeks of E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o in a v@@ ein before they were converted to Ab@@ se@@ amed or continued to receive E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
the main indicator of the efficacy was the change in hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in values between the beginning of the study and the assessment period in the weeks 25 to 29 .
&quot; in addition , the company presented the results of a study in which the effects of gem@@ cut@@ ted Ab@@ se@@ amed were examined with those of E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o in 114 cancer patients receiving chemotherapy . &quot;
&quot; in the study involving patients suffering from kidney problems caused an@@ a@@ emia , hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in values of patients who were converted to Ab@@ se@@ amed were maintained in the same degree as in those patients who continue to receive E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o . &quot;
&quot; in comparison to this , patients who still received E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o showed a rise in 0.0@@ 63 g / dl of the output value of 12.@@ 0 g / dl . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effect of Ab@@ se@@ amed is an increase in blood pressure , which can occasionally lead to symptoms of encephal@@ opathy ( brain problems ) such as sudden , pier@@ cing mig@@ raine near@@ ing head@@ aches and confusion . &quot;
&quot; Ab@@ se@@ amed must not be applied to patients who are possibly hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to ep@@ ep@@ tin al@@ fa , or any of the other components . &quot;
&quot; Ab@@ se@@ amed as an injection under the skin is not recommended for the treatment of kidney problems , as further studies are required to make sure that this will not trigger allergic reactions . &quot;
&quot; the Committee on Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that for Ab@@ se@@ amed according to the provisions of the European Union , proof that the medicine has a comparable quality , safety and efficacy profile as E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o . &quot;
&quot; the company that manufactures Ab@@ se@@ amed will provide information packages for medical personnel in all Member States , including information on the safety of the drug . &quot;
&quot; in August 2007 , the European Commission issued a permit for the company Medi@@ ce Pharmaceuticals P@@ üt@@ ter GmbH &amp; Co KG a permit for the launch of Ab@@ se@@ amed in the entire European Union . &quot;

&quot; treatment should be performed only in patients with moderate an@@ emia ( hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in &#91; H@@ b &#93; 10 - 13 g / dl &#91; 6,@@ 2 - 8,@@ 1 m@@ mo@@ l / l &#93; , no iron deficiency ) , in case blood @-@ saving measures are not available or insufficient , in case of planned larger surgical procedures ( 4 or more units of blood in women ; 5 or more units of blood in men ) . &quot;
&quot; to reduce foreign blood , Ab@@ se@@ amed can be applied in front of a large elec@@ tive orthop@@ a@@ edic procedure in adults without iron deficiency , in which a high risk of trans@@ fusion complications is expected . &quot;
HB 10 @-@ 13 g / dl ) and an expected blood loss of 900 @-@ 1800 ml can not be applied to an aut@@ olog@@ ous blood donation program .
hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration is between 10 and 12 g / dl ( 6.2 - 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) except for pedi@@ atric patients where hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in concentration should lie between 9.5 and 11 g / dl ( 5.9 - 6.8 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
&quot; symptoms of an@@ emia and disease may vary depending on age , gender and overall disease burden ; therefore , the assessment of the individual clinical course and condition of illness is required by the doctor . &quot;
an increase in ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in by more than 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) over a period of four weeks should be avoided .
&quot; due to the vari@@ ability between patients , individual hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in values can occasionally be observed in a patient over or below the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ - target concentration . &quot;
&quot; given this hem@@ og@@ lob@@ bin@@ vari@@ ability , an appropriate dose management should be attempted to reach the ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration of 10 g / dl ( 6,@@ 2 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) to 12 g / dl ( 7,5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) . &quot;
if the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value increases by more than 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month or if the permanent hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value is 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) the ep@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa dose is reduced by 25 % .
patients should be closely monitored to ensure that ep@@ ep@@ tin al@@ fa is applied in the lowest permitted dose prescribed for the control of an@@ a@@ emia and an@@ a@@ emia symptoms .
these clinical results suggest that patients with initial very low h@@ b value ( &lt; 6 g / dl or &lt; 3.@@ 75 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) may require higher maintenance doses ( H@@ b &gt; 8 g / dl or &gt; 5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
these clinical results suggest that patients with initial very low h@@ b value ( &lt; 6.8 g / dl or &lt; 4.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) may require higher maintenance doses ( H@@ b &gt; 6.8 g / dl or &gt; 4.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
starting dose 50 I.@@ E. / kg three times a week by means of intra@@ ven@@ ous application if necessary with a dose increase of 25 I.@@ E. / kg ( three times a week ) until the desired target is reached ( this should be done in steps of at least 4 weeks ) .
&quot; symptoms and symptoms may vary depending on age , gender and overall disease burden ; therefore , the assessment of the individual clinical course and condition of illness is required by the doctor . &quot;
&quot; given this hem@@ og@@ lob@@ bin@@ vari@@ ability , an appropriate dose management should be attempted to reach the ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration of 10 g / dl ( 6,@@ 2 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) to 12 g / dl ( 7,5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) . &quot;
patients should be closely monitored to ensure that ep@@ ep@@ tin al@@ fa is applied in the lowest approved dose which is required to control the an@@ a@@ emia symptoms .
&quot; if after 4 treatment weeks of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value increased by at least 1 g / dl ( 0,@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) or the reproduction number of ≥ 0,000 cells / µ@@ l compared to the initial value , the dose should be maintained three times a week or 450 I.@@ E. / kg once a week . &quot;
&quot; if the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in rose &lt; 1 g / dl ( &lt; 0,@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and the reproduction number of &lt; 4@@ 0,000 cells / µ@@ l compared to the initial value , the dose should be increased to 300 I.@@ E. / kg three times a week . &quot;
&quot; if after further 4 weeks of treatment with 300 I.@@ U. / kg three times a week of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value of ≥ 1 g / dl ( ≥ 0,@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) or the reproduction number increased by ≥ 0,000 cells / µ@@ l , the dose should be maintained three times a week three times a week . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value increased by &lt; 1 g / dl ( &lt; 0,@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) or the reproduction number of &lt; 4@@ 0,000 cells / µ@@ l compared to the initial value , a response to ep@@ ep@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa therapy is unlikely and the treatment should be abor@@ ted . &quot;
patients with mild an@@ emia ( hem@@ at@@ oc@@ rit 33 - 39 % ) in which the precau@@ tion of ≥ 4 blood con@@ serving should be required should be obtained ab@@ se@@ amed in a dose of 600 I.@@ E. / kg body weight twice a week for 3 weeks before surgery .
iron sub@@ stitution should be started as early as possible - for example a few weeks before the start of the aut@@ olog@@ ous blood donation program - started to provide large iron reserves prior to the start of the Ab@@ se@@ amed therapy .
&quot; 6 The recommended dosage is 600 I.@@ U. / kg ep@@ ep@@ tin al@@ fa , which should be given once a week over three weeks ( day 21 , 14 and 7 ) before the surgery and on the day of surgery ( day 0 ) . &quot;
&quot; on this occasion , ep@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa pre@@ oper@@ atively should be given pre@@ oper@@ atively 300 I.@@ E. / kg at 10 consecutive days , on the day of surgery and 4 days immediately afterwards . &quot;
&quot; alternatively , injection can be given at the end of di@@ aly@@ sis via the hose of a fi@@ st@@ pin , followed by 10 ml is@@ ot@@ onic cooking salt solution to rin@@ se the hose and ensure an adequate injection of the drug in the circulation . &quot;
&quot; patients suffering from the treatment with any er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ e@@ tin at a er@@ y@@ thro@@ blast@@ oc@@ ie ( Pure Red Cell A@@ pl@@ asia , PR@@ CA ) should not receive Ab@@ se@@ amed or another er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ e@@ tin ( see section 4.4 - er@@ y@@ thro@@ blast@@ oc@@ ie ) . &quot;
&quot; heart attack or stroke within a month before the treatment , inst@@ ab@@ ile ang@@ ina pec@@ tor@@ is , increased risk of deep ven@@ ous thro@@ mb@@ oses ( e.g. an@@ am@@ nes@@ tically known ven@@ ous thro@@ m@@ bo@@ em@@ bo@@ lia ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients who are en@@ vis@@ aged for a larger elec@@ tive orthop@@ a@@ edic intervention and which can not participate in an aut@@ olog@@ ous blood donation program , the application of ep@@ ep@@ tin al@@ fa is contra@@ indicated in the following up , accompanying or cer@@ eb@@ rov@@ ascular diseases ; in patients with a short heart attack or cer@@ eb@@ rov@@ ascular occ@@ as@@ sion . &quot;
er@@ y@@ thro@@ blast@@ oc@@ ie ( PR@@ CA ) Very rare was reported about the occurrence of an antibody @-@ medi@@ ated PR@@ CA after monthly until years of treatment with sub@@ cut@@ aneous er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ e@@ tin .
&quot; patients with sudden function loss , defined as a reduction of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in values ( 1 - 2 g / dl per month ) with increased need for trans@@ fu@@ sions , should be investigated as the usual causes of non @-@ response ( iron , foli@@ c acid or vitamin B@@ 12 deficiency , al@@ umini@@ om@@ in@@ toxic@@ ation , infections or inflammation , blood loss and hem@@ oly@@ sis ) . &quot;
&quot; if the Re@@ tic@@ u@@ lo@@ zy@@ te value , taking into account the an@@ a@@ emia ( i.e. the re@@ tic@@ u@@ lo@@ zy@@ te &quot; index &quot; ) , is degra@@ ded ( &lt; 20,000 / mm@@ 3 or &lt; 20,000 / micro@@ liter or &lt; 0,5 % ) , the anti @-@ er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ e@@ tin antibodies should be determined and investigate the bone mar@@ row for diagnosis of PR@@ CA . &quot;
the data for immun@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity in sub@@ cut@@ aneous use of Ab@@ se@@ amed in patients with a risk of antibody @-@ induced PR@@ CA ( patients with ren@@ al an@@ a@@ emia ) are not sufficient .
&quot; 8 For patients with chronic ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency , the upper limit of the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration should not be exceeded during maintenance therapy . &quot;
clinical trials have been observed an increased risk of mort@@ ality and risk of serious cardiovascular events when er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ esis stimul@@ ants were given with a hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target of more than 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
controlled clinical trials showed no significant benefit due to ep@@ ox@@ et@@ ine accumulation if the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in concentration is increased by the concentration required for the control of the an@@ a@@ emia symptoms and avoiding blood trans@@ fu@@ sions .
hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in rose should not exceed 1 g / dl ( 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month and should not exceed 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month to minimize the risk of increased blood pressure .
&quot; in patients with chronic ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency and clin@@ ically evidence cor@@ on@@ ary heart disease or con@@ ges@@ tion in@@ suffici@@ ency , the upper limit of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration should not be exceeded during maintenance therapy . &quot;
&quot; according to the present findings , the treatment of an@@ a@@ emia with ep@@ ep@@ tin al@@ fa in adults with ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency , which are not di@@ aly@@ sis charged , will not accelerate progression of ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency . &quot;
tumour patients under chemotherapy should be taken into account for ass@@ essing the therapeutic efficiency of ep@@ ox@@ et@@ ine al@@ fa 2 - 3 @-@ week delay between ep@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa and er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ e@@ tin response ( patients who may need to be trans@@ lu@@ ded ) .
&quot; if the H@@ b increase is exceeded than 2 g / dl ( 1,@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month or a H@@ b @-@ value of 13 g / dl ( 8.1 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , the dose must be reduced according to section 4.2 , to minimize the risk of possible thro@@ mb@@ otic events ( see section 4.2 Treatment of patients with chemotherapy @-@ related an@@ a@@ emia ) . &quot;
the decision for the application of re@@ combin@@ ant er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ et@@ ine should be based on a benefit @-@ risk @-@ weighing under the participation of the respective patient that should also take into account the specific clinical context .
&quot; in patients who are intended for a larger elec@@ tive orthop@@ edic procedure , if possible , before the beginning of ep@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa therapy , the cause of an@@ a@@ emia should be examined and treated accordingly . &quot;
&quot; patients who undergo a larger elec@@ tive orthop@@ a@@ edic procedure should have adequate Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ os@@ e@@ proph@@ yla@@ xis , since they have an increased risk of thro@@ mb@@ otic and v@@ ascular diseases , especially in an underlying cardiovascular disease . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the risk of post@@ operative thro@@ mb@@ otic / v@@ ascular events can be excluded in the treatment with ep@@ ep@@ tin al@@ fa for patients with an output equivalent of &gt; 13 g / dl . &quot;
&quot; in several controlled studies , ep@@ och@@ et@@ ine was not proven to improve overall survival in tumour patients with sy@@ mpt@@ om@@ atic an@@ emia or reduce the risk of progression . &quot;
4 months in patients with metastatic breast cancer that received chemotherapy when a hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration of 12 - 14 g / dl ( 7.5 - 8.7 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) was targeted
&quot; if ep@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is applied together with C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in , the blood levels of C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in should be controlled and the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ indo@@ sis should be adjusted to the rising hem@@ at@@ ox@@ y . &quot;
&quot; in vitro investigation of tumor tissues , there are no indications of interaction between ep@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa and G @-@ CS@@ F or GM @-@ CS@@ F concerning hem@@ at@@ ological differentiation or prolifer@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; thro@@ mb@@ otic , v@@ ascular events such as M@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al I@@ dem@@ ics , M@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al infections , cer@@ eb@@ rov@@ ascular diseases ( brain ble@@ eding , cer@@ ebral thro@@ mb@@ oses , spinal thro@@ mb@@ oses , spinal thro@@ mb@@ oses , spinal thro@@ mb@@ oses , spinal thro@@ mb@@ oses , spinal thro@@ mb@@ oses , spinal thro@@ mb@@ oses , spinal thro@@ mb@@ oses , spinal thro@@ mb@@ oses , spinal thro@@ mb@@ oses , spinal thro@@ mb@@ oses , spinal thro@@ mb@@ oses , spinal thro@@ mb@@ oses , spinal thro@@ mb@@ oses , spinal thro@@ mb@@ oses , spinal thro@@ mb@@ oses , spinal thro@@ mb@@ oses , spinal thro@@ mb@@ oses , spinal thro@@ mb@@ oses , spinal thro@@ mb@@ oses , spinal thro@@ mb@@ oses , spinal thro@@ mb@@ oses , spinal thro@@ mb@@ oses , spinal thro@@ mb@@ oses , spinal thro@@ mb@@ oses , spinal thro@@ mb@@ oses , spinal thro@@ mb@@ oses , spinal thro@@ mb@@ oses , spinal thro@@ mb@@ oses , spinal thro@@ mb@@ oses , spinal thro@@ mb@@ oses , spinal thro@@ mb@@ oses , spinal thro@@ mb@@ oses , spinal thro@@ mb@@ oses , spinal thro@@ mb@@ oses , spinal thro@@ mb@@ oses , spinal thro@@ mb@@ oses , spinal thro@@ mb@@ oses , spinal thro@@ mb@@ oses , spinal thro@@ mb@@ oses , spinal thro@@ mb@@ oses , spinal thro@@ mb@@ oses , spinal thro@@ mb@@ oses , spinal thro@@ mb@@ oses , spinal thro@@ mb@@ oses , spinal thro@@ mb@@ oses , spinal thro@@ mb@@ oses , spinal thro@@ mb@@ oses , spinal thro@@ mb@@ oses , spinal thro@@ mb@@ oses , spinal thro@@ mb@@ oses , spinal thro@@ mb@@ oses , spinal thro@@ mb@@ oses , spinal thro@@ mb@@ oses , spinal thro@@ mb@@ oses , spinal thro@@ mb@@ oses , spinal thro@@ mb@@ oses , spinal thro@@ mb@@ oses , spinal thro@@ mb@@ oses , spinal thro@@ mb@@ oses , spinal thro@@ mb@@ oses , spinal thro@@ mb@@ oses , spinal thro@@ mb@@ oses , spinal thro@@ mb@@ oses , spinal thro@@ mb@@ oses ,
the most common side effect during the treatment with ep@@ ep@@ tin al@@ fa is a dose @-@ dependent rise in blood pressure or deteri@@ oration of an existing hyper@@ tension .
an increased incidence of thro@@ m@@ bo@@ vas@@ cul@@ arly events ( see section 4.4 and section 4.8 - General ) was observed in patients under the treatment with er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ et@@ ines .
independent of er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ e@@ tin treatment it can occur in surgical patients with cardiovascular disease after repeated ha@@ v@@ eins to thro@@ mb@@ otic and v@@ ascular complications .
&quot; the gene@@ tically extracted ep@@ ep@@ tin al@@ fa is gly@@ co@@ si@@ ulated and identical with the endo@@ genous human er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ e@@ tin , which was isolated from urine from the urine . &quot;
it could be shown with the help of cultures of human bone mar@@ row cells that ep@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa stimul@@ ates the er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ esis and not influenced the leu@@ kop@@ o@@ esis .
&quot; 389 patients with hem@@ o@@ blast@@ osis ( 221 multiple my@@ el@@ oma , 144 non @-@ Hod@@ g@@ kin@@ - lymph@@ omas and 24 further hem@@ ost@@ asis ) and 332 patients with solid tum@@ ors ( 172 breast cancer , 23 bron@@ chi@@ al cancer , 22 prostate cancer , 21 g@@ astro@@ intestinal cancer , 21 g@@ astro@@ intestinal cancer , and 30 more ) . &quot;
&quot; 1895 patients with solid tum@@ ors ( 68@@ 3 mam@@ ma@@ car@@ cin@@ omas , 260 bron@@ chi@@ al car@@ cin@@ omas , 174 gy@@ nec@@ ological tum@@ ors , 300 g@@ astro@@ intestinal tum@@ ors , 300 g@@ astro@@ intestinal tum@@ ors and 478 other ) and 8@@ 02 patients with hem@@ ost@@ blast@@ osis . &quot;
survival and tumour progression were examined in five major controlled trials with a total of 28@@ 33 patients ; four of these studies were double @-@ blind plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled trials and
&quot; in the open study , there was no difference in overall survival between patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ e@@ tin patients and patients . &quot;
&quot; in these studies , patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ e@@ tin treated patients with an@@ a@@ emia due to various frequent mal@@ ign@@ om@@ ous mal@@ ign@@ ant , statisti@@ cally significantly higher mort@@ ality than in the controls . &quot;
overall survival in studies could not be explained by differences in the incidence of thro@@ mb@@ oses and related complications associated with re@@ combin@@ ant human er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ e@@ tin patients and in controls .
&quot; there is an increased risk of thro@@ m@@ bo@@ em@@ bol@@ ical events in tumour patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ e@@ tin , and a negative effect on overall survival cannot be excluded . &quot;
&quot; it is not clari@@ fied how far these results are transferred to the application of re@@ combin@@ ant human er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ e@@ tin in tumour patients treated with chemotherapy with the aim of reaching a hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value less than 13 g / dl , since too few patients with these characteristics were included in the checked data . &quot;
ep@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa provisions after repeated intra@@ ven@@ ous application showed a half @-@ life time of approximately 4 hours in healthy volunteers and a somewhat prolonged half @-@ life of approximately 5 hours in patients with ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency .
after sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection the ser@@ um mirror of ep@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is much lower than the ser@@ um mirror that can be reached after intra@@ ven@@ ous injection .
&quot; there is no cum@@ ulation : the ser@@ um mirrors remain the same regardless of whether they are determined 24 hours after the first gift , or 24 hours after the last gift . &quot;
bone mar@@ row fibro@@ sis is a well @-@ known complic@@ ation of chronic ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency in humans and could be due to secondary hyper@@ par@@ ath@@ y@@ re@@ o@@ idi@@ m or unknown factors .
&quot; in a study of hem@@ at@@ aly@@ sis patients , which were treated three years with ep@@ ep@@ tin al@@ fa , the incidence of bone mar@@ row fibro@@ sis compared to the control group with di@@ aly@@ sis patients , which were not treated with ep@@ ep@@ tin al@@ fa , was not increased . &quot;
&quot; 14 In animal experimental studies involving approximately 20 times of the recommended weekly dose , ep@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa led to reduced f@@ ö@@ al body weight , to a delay of the Os@@ si@@ fication and an increase in red@@ dish mort@@ ality . &quot;
&quot; these reports are based on vitro diagnostic findings with cells from human tumor tissue samples , which are known for the clinical situation but of uns@@ af@@ e sig@@ ni@@ fi@@ des . &quot;
&quot; as part of the out@@ patient application , the patient can store Ab@@ se@@ amed unique for a period of maximum 3 days outside the cooling cabinet and not over 25 ° C. &quot;
&quot; the sy@@ ring@@ es are provided with gradu@@ ation rings and the filling volume is indicated by a glu@@ ed label , so that if necessary , the dimension of particles is possible . &quot;
the treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed must be introduced under the supervision of doctors who have experience in the treatment of patients with the indications mentioned above .
&quot; 21 The recommended dosage is 600 I.@@ U. / kg ep@@ ep@@ tin al@@ fa , which should be given once a week over three weeks ( day 21 , 14 and 7 ) before surgery and on the day of surgery ( day 0 ) . &quot;
&quot; 23 In patients with chronic ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency , the upper limit of the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration should not be exceeded during maintenance therapy . &quot;
hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in rose should not exceed 1 g / dl ( 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month and should not exceed 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month to minimize the risk of increased blood pressure .

very rare was reported about the occurrence of an antibody medi@@ ated er@@ y@@ thro@@ blast@@ oc@@ ie after months to years of treatment with sub@@ cut@@ aneous ( under the skin ges@@ pen@@ ed ) er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ e@@ tin .
&quot; if you suffer from er@@ y@@ thro@@ blast@@ oc@@ ie , it will cancel your treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed and determine how your an@@ a@@ emia is best handled . &quot;
&quot; therefore , Ab@@ se@@ amed must be given by injection into a v@@ ein ( intra@@ ven@@ ously ) if you are treated because of an an@@ a@@ emia due to kidney disease . &quot;
a high hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value is the risk of problems with the heart or blood vessels and the risk of death could be increased .
&quot; in case of increased or increasing pot@@ assium levels , your doctor may consider a dis@@ ruption of the treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed until the pot@@ assium values lie in the normal range . &quot;
&quot; if you suffer from chronic kidney weakness and clin@@ ically obvious cor@@ on@@ ary heart disease or dam@@ aging signs by in@@ adequate heart rate , your doctor will ensure that your hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in mirror does not exceed a certain value . &quot;
&quot; according to the present findings , the treatment of blood poverty with Ab@@ se@@ amed in adults with chronic kidney failure ( ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency ) , which are not di@@ aly@@ sis subject to di@@ aly@@ sis , will not accelerate progression of ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency . &quot;
a 2 - 3 @-@ week delay between ep@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa gift and the desired effect should be considered for evaluating the effectiveness of Ab@@ se@@ amed .
200 your doctor will regularly determine your values of the red blood dy@@ e ( hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in ) and adjust your ab@@ se@@ amed dose accordingly to keep the risk of blood c@@ low@@ y ( thro@@ mb@@ otic event ) as low as possible .
&quot; this risk should be weigh@@ ed very carefully against the benefits derived from the treatment with ep@@ ep@@ tin al@@ fa , especially if you have an increased risk of thro@@ mb@@ otic v@@ ascular events ( e.g. a deep ven@@ ous thro@@ mb@@ ose or lung em@@ bo@@ lie ) . &quot;
&quot; if you are a cancer patient , consider that Ab@@ se@@ amed can act as a growth factor for blood cells and may adver@@ sely affect the tumor . &quot;
&quot; if an orthop@@ edic operation is im@@ min@@ ent you should study the cause of your an@@ a@@ emia before treatment start with Ab@@ se@@ amed , and be treated accordingly . &quot;
&quot; if your values of the red blood dy@@ e ( hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in ) are too high , you should not obtain Ab@@ se@@ amed since an increased risk of blood c@@ low@@ ness after surgery exists . &quot;
&quot; please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you are taking other medicines / used or applied recently , even if it is not prescription drugs . &quot;
&quot; if you are taking C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( means of supp@@ ression of the immune system ) during your therapy with Ab@@ se@@ amed , your doctor may be prescribed certain blood tests to measure the blood levels of C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in . &quot;
laboratory tests have shown no interaction between ep@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa and G @-@ CS@@ F or GM @-@ CS@@ F ( G @-@ CS@@ F and GM @-@ CS@@ F are means for building the immune system e.g. in cancer chemotherapy or with HIV ) .
&quot; depending on how your blood glucose ( an@@ a@@ emia ) refers to treatment , the dose can be adjusted about every four weeks until your condition is under control . &quot;
your doctor will be able to arrange regular blood tests to check the treatment success and ensure that the medicine works correctly and your hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value does not exceed a certain value .
&quot; once you are well set , you will receive regular doses of ab@@ se@@ amed between 25 and 50 I.@@ E. / kg twice a week , spread over two equally large inj@@ ections . &quot;
your doctor will be able to arrange regular blood tests to check the treatment success and ensure that your hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value does not exceed a certain value .
&quot; depending on how an@@ a@@ emia appe@@ als to treatment , the dose can be adjusted about every four weeks until the condition is under control . &quot;
&quot; to ensure this and ensure that the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value does not exceed a certain value , the treating doctor will conduct regular blood tests . &quot;
&quot; if it is necessary to shor@@ ten the treatment time before surgery , a dose of 300 I.@@ E. / kg may be given to 10 consecutive days before surgery , on the day of intervention and another 4 days after surgery . &quot;
&quot; however , you can , if your doctor thinks it appropriate , also learn how to sp@@ lash yourself off yourself under the skin . &quot;
&quot; heart , heart attacks , brain ble@@ eding , stroke , hyper@@ tension disorders of the brain , deep ven@@ ous thro@@ mb@@ oses , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ oses , v@@ ascular end@@ ings ( an@@ eur@@ ys@@ men ) , thro@@ mb@@ oses of the ret@@ ina and blood cl@@ ots in artificial kid@@ neys were reported in patients under er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ e@@ tin treatment . &quot;
&quot; eyel@@ ids and lips ( qu@@ in@@ cke eyes ) and shock@@ ing allergic reactions with symptoms such as ting@@ ling , red@@ ness , it@@ ching sensation and accelerated pulse were reported in rare cases . &quot;
er@@ y@@ thro@@ blast@@ oc@@ ie means that no longer enough red blood cells can be formed in bone mar@@ row ( see section &quot; Special caution when applying Ab@@ se@@ amed is required &quot; ) .
&quot; after repeated blood@@ shed , it can happen regardless of the treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed - to a blood c@@ low@@ y formation ( thro@@ mb@@ otic v@@ ascular events ) . &quot;
treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed can be accompanied by an increased risk of blood pro@@ p after surgery ( post@@ operative thro@@ mb@@ otic v@@ ascular events ) if your initial greenhouse value is too high
please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if any of the listed side effects will significantly affect you or if you notice any side effects that are not stated in this utility .
&quot; if a sy@@ ringe has been taken out of the fridge and room temperature has reached ( up to 25 ° C ) , it must be used either within 3 days or be disc@@ ar@@ ded . &quot;
A@@ cl@@ asta is used to treat the following diseases : • Oste@@ opor@@ osis ( a disease that makes the bone br@@ ittle ) both in women after men@@ op@@ ause and in men .
&quot; it is used in patients with a high frac@@ ture risk ( frac@@ tures ) , including patients who recently suffered a minor frac@@ ture such as h@@ inf@@ all ; • Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get des Kno@@ chens , a disease that changes the normal course of the bone growth . &quot;
&quot; in addition , patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get should take at least 500 mg of calcium twice daily for at least 10 days after treatment ; patients with hip frac@@ ture should receive a large dose of vitamin D ( 50 000 to 125 000 Y ) oral or by injection into a muscle . &quot;
&quot; the administration of par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ( remedy against inflammation ) shortly after the application of A@@ cl@@ asta can reduce the symptoms occurring in the three days after in@@ fusion , such as fever , muscle pain , flu @-@ like symptoms , joint pain and head@@ ache . &quot;
the treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get may only be prescribed by doctors who have experience in treating this disease .
&quot; as the active ingredient in A@@ cl@@ asta is the same as in Z@@ omet@@ a , a part of the data material for z@@ omet@@ a was used to evaluate A@@ cl@@ asta . &quot;
&quot; in the first study , nearly 8 000 elderly women were involved with oste@@ opor@@ osis , and the number of spinal and hip frac@@ tures was examined over a period of three years . &quot;
the second study included 2 127 men and women with oste@@ opor@@ osis over 50 years who recently suffered a hip frac@@ ture ; the number of frac@@ tures was examined over a period of up to five years .
&quot; at Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , A@@ cl@@ asta was tested in two studies of 357 patients and compared with Ris@@ ed@@ ron ( another bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate ) for six months . &quot;
the main indicator of the efficacy was whether the sal@@ ary of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase in the ser@@ um ( an enzyme that builds bone substance ) in the blood returned to norm@@ alized or at least 75 % compared to the initial value .
&quot; in the study with older women , the risk of vert@@ ebral frac@@ tures in patients under A@@ cl@@ asta ( without any other oste@@ opor@@ osis ) was reduced by 70 % over a period of three years compared to the patients . &quot;
&quot; compared to all patients under A@@ cl@@ asta ( with or without other oste@@ opor@@ osis ) , the risk of hip frac@@ tures was reduced by 41 % . &quot;
in the study involving men and women with hip frac@@ ture 9 % of patients under A@@ cl@@ asta had a frac@@ ture ( 92 of 1 0@@ 65 ) compared to 13 % of patients under plac@@ ebo ( 139 of 1 0@@ 62 ) .
most of the side effects of A@@ cl@@ asta occur within the first three days after in@@ fusion and are less frequent in repeated in@@ fu@@ sions .
A@@ cl@@ asta must not be used in patients who are possibly hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic to z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid or other bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate or any of the other ingredients .
&quot; as with all bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates , patients with A@@ cl@@ asta are subject to the risk of kidney problems , reactions to the in@@ fusion site and oste@@ on@@ ek@@ ro@@ sis ( death of bone tissue ) in the jaw . &quot;
&quot; the manufacturer of A@@ cl@@ asta provides re@@ conn@@ aissance material for doctors who prescri@@ be A@@ cl@@ asta for the treatment of oste@@ opor@@ osis , which contains hints of how the medicine is applied , as well as similar material for patients in which the drug side effects are explained and pointed out when they should contact the doctor . &quot;
&quot; in April 2005 , the European Commission issued Nov@@ arti@@ s Euro@@ ph@@ arm Limited a permit to launch A@@ cl@@ asta in the entire European Union . &quot;

&quot; treatment of oste@@ opor@@ osis • in post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women • in men with increased risk of frac@@ tures , including in patients with a recently low @-@ traumatic stress frac@@ ture . &quot;
intra@@ ven@@ ous in@@ fusion of 5 mg A@@ cl@@ asta is recommended once a year for the treatment of post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis and oste@@ opor@@ osis in men .
in patients with a low @-@ traumatic stress frac@@ ture the administration of the in@@ fusion of A@@ cl@@ asta is recommended two or more weeks after the surgical treatment of the hip frac@@ ture ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; for the treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , A@@ cl@@ asta should only be prescribed by doctors who have experience in the treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get . &quot;
after treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get with A@@ cl@@ asta a long re@@ mission period was observed in patients who responded to the therapy ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; in addition , it is very advisable in patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get a sufficient supply of calcium , accordingly twice daily at least 500 mg of elementary calcium , for at least 10 days after the administration of A@@ cl@@ asta ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients with a low @-@ traumatic stress frac@@ ture , an initial dose of 50,000 to 12@@ 5.000 I.@@ E. or@@ ally or in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular vitamin D is recommended prior to the first A@@ cl@@ asta in@@ fusion . &quot;
the frequency of symptoms occurring within the first three days after the administration of A@@ cl@@ asta can be reduced shortly after using A@@ cl@@ asta .
patients with kidney function distur@@ b@@ ance ( see section 4.4 ) For patients with a cre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min A@@ cl@@ asta is not recommended because limited clinical experience exists for this patient group .
&quot; older patients ( ≥ 65 years ) A dosage adjustment is not necessary , since the bio@@ availability , distribution and elimination of older patients is similar to younger patients . &quot;
children and adol@@ escents A@@ cl@@ asta is not recommended for use in children and adol@@ escents under the age of 18 .
&quot; A@@ cl@@ asta is not recommended in patients with severe ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency ( Cre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min ) , because only limited clinical experiences are available for this patient population . &quot;
pre @-@ existing hypo@@ kal@@ emia is to treat calcium and vitamin D prior to the start of therapy ( see section 4.3 ) .
&quot; due to the rapid inser@@ tion of the effect of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ acid on bone structure , a temporary , co @-@ associated sy@@ mpt@@ om@@ atic hypo@@ kal@@ emia can develop , whose maximum occurs usually within the first 10 days after the in@@ fusion of A@@ cl@@ asta ( see section 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it is very advisable in patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get a sufficient supply of calcium , accordingly twice daily at least 500 mg of elementary calcium , for at least 10 days after the administration of A@@ cl@@ asta ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; cancer illnesses , chemotherapy , treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ o@@ ids , poor oral hygiene ) should be investigated before applying bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates a tooth examination with appropriate preventive dental treatment . &quot;
no data is available for patients who require dental intervention if the inter@@ ruption of the treatment with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates reduces the risk of oste@@ opor@@ osis in the jaw area .
the clinical evaluation by the attending physician should be the basis for the treatment plan for each patient and based on an individual benefit risk assessment .
the frequency of symptoms occurring within the first three days after administration of A@@ cl@@ asta can be reduced shortly after the application of par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ( see section 4.2 ) .
&quot; incidence of cases reported as serious side effects reported in patients who received A@@ cl@@ asta increased ( 1.3 % ) ( 51 of 3,@@ 8@@ 62 ) compared to patients receiving plac@@ ebo ( 0.6 % ) ( 22 of 3.8@@ 52 ) . &quot;
&quot; in oste@@ opor@@ osis studies ( PFT , HOR@@ IZ@@ ON - Recur@@ rent Fr@@ ac@@ ture Trial &#91; R@@ FT &#93; ) the total frequency of atri@@ al fibr@@ ill@@ ation between A@@ cl@@ asta ( 2.6 % ) and plac@@ ebo ( 2.1 % ) was comparable . &quot;
&quot; very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , frequent ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasional ( ≥ 1 / 1.000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) adverse drug effects are listed in Table 1 . &quot;
&quot; kidney function disorder Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ acid was associated with ren@@ al dys@@ functions , which expressed itself as a decrease in kidney function ( i.e. an increase in the ser@@ um cre@@ at@@ in@@ ins ) and in rare cases as acute ren@@ al failure . &quot;
the change of the cre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance ( measured annually before administration ) and the occurrence of kidney failure and a reduced kidney function were comparable in a clinical trial for oste@@ opor@@ osis over three years comparable to the A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a- and the plac@@ ebo group .
a temporary increase in the ser@@ um cre@@ at@@ in@@ ins within 10 days after giving was observed at 1.8 % of patients treated with A@@ cl@@ asta compared to 0.8 % of patients treated with plac@@ ebo .
&quot; based on the evaluation of laboratory findings , the temporary asy@@ mpt@@ om@@ atic calcium values , which were below the normal fluctu@@ ation area ( less than 2.@@ 10 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , treated patients compared to 21 % of patients treated with A@@ cl@@ asta in the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get studies . &quot;
&quot; all patients received sufficient amounts of vitamin D and calcium in the study on post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis , in the study to avoid clinical frac@@ tures following a hip frac@@ ture and in the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get studies ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; in the study to avoid clinical frac@@ tures after a recently suffered hip frac@@ ture , the vitamin D mirror was not rout@@ inely measured , but the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D prior to the administration of A@@ cl@@ asta ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; local reactions After the administration of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ acid in a large clinical study was reported on local reactions to the in@@ fusion site , such as red@@ ness , swelling and / or pain , reported ( 0.7 % ) . &quot;
&quot; oste@@ on@@ ek@@ ro@@ ses in the jaw area were occasional , especially with cancer patients , about oste@@ on@@ ek@@ ro@@ ses ( primarily in the jaw area ) , which were treated with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates , including Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid . &quot;
many of these patients had signs of local infections including oste@@ omyel@@ itis and the majority of the reports refer to cancer patients following tooth extraction or other dental intervention .
7 study with 7.@@ 7@@ 36 patients entered oste@@ on@@ ek@@ ro@@ sis in the jaw area at one with A@@ cl@@ asta and in a patient treated with plac@@ ebo .
&quot; in case of over@@ dose which leads to a clin@@ ically relevant hypo@@ kal@@ emia , a compensation can be achieved by applying oral calcium and / or intra@@ ven@@ ous in@@ fusion of calcium glu@@ con@@ ate . &quot;
clinical efficacy in the treatment of post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis ( PFT ) The efficacy and safety of A@@ cl@@ asta 5 mg once a year for 3 consecutive years was found in post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women ( 7.@@ 7@@ 36 women aged between 65 and 89 years ) with either a bone density value ( BM@@ D ) T @-@ Score for the Sch@@ enk@@ el@@ h@@ al ≤ -@@ 2.5 with or without signs of an existing spinal body structure .
effects on morph@@ ometric cycl@@ ones A@@ cl@@ asta decreased significantly over a period of three years as well as after one year the frequency of one or more new vert@@ ebral cor@@ tures ( see table 2 ) .
A@@ cl@@ asta treated patients aged 75 and older had a 60 % reduced risk of spinal cord injuries compared to plac@@ ebo @-@ patients ( p &lt; 0.0@@ 001 ) .
&quot; effects on hip frac@@ tures A@@ cl@@ asta showed a consistent effect over three years , resulting in a reduced risk of hip frac@@ tures at 41 % ( 95 % CI , 17 % to 58 % ) . &quot;
&quot; the effect on bone density ( BM@@ D ) A@@ cl@@ asta increased the bone density on the lum@@ bar vert@@ eb@@ ra , hip and at the dist@@ al radius compared with plac@@ ebo treatment significantly to all times ( 6 , 12 , 24 and 36 months ) . &quot;
&quot; 9 Incre@@ ase of the bone density of the lum@@ bar spine by 6.7 % , the whole hip by 6.0 % , the thig@@ h neck by 5.1 % and the dist@@ al radius by 3.2 % . &quot;
bone hist@@ ology With 152 post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ otic patients treated with A@@ cl@@ asta ( N = 82 ) or plac@@ ebo ( N = 70 ) were taken from the pel@@ vis a year after the third annual dose of bone bi@@ op@@ sies .
a micro@@ computer tom@@ ography ( µ@@ CT ) analysis showed an increase in the tr@@ ab@@ ecular bone volume compared to plac@@ ebo and the preservation of the tr@@ ab@@ ecular bone structure .
&quot; bone @-@ specific alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase ( B@@ SAP ) , the N @-@ terminal prop@@ ep@@ ti@@ d of type I@@ - coll@@ agen ( P@@ 1@@ NP ) in ser@@ um and the beta @-@ C tel@@ op@@ ep@@ ti@@ d ( b @-@ CT@@ x ) in ser@@ um were determined in sub @-@ groups of 517 to 1,@@ 246 patients in peri@@ odic intervals during study duration . &quot;
treatment with an annual 5 mg dose A@@ cl@@ asta reduced B@@ SAP after 12 months significantly by 30 % compared to the initial value and was held at 28 % below the initial value up to 36 months .
P@@ 1@@ NP was significantly reduced by 61 % below the initial value after 12 months and was kept at 52 % below the initial value up to 36 months .
B @-@ CT@@ x was significantly reduced by 61 % below the initial value after 12 months and was kept at 55 % below the initial value up to 36 months .
&quot; the vitamin D mirrors were not rout@@ inely measured , but the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D ( 50,000 to 12@@ 5.000 I.@@ E. oral or in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular ) 2 weeks before in@@ fusion . &quot;
&quot; overall mort@@ ality was 10 % ( 101 patients ) in the group treated with A@@ cl@@ asta , compared to 13 % ( 141 patients ) in the plac@@ ebo group . &quot;
&quot; effect on bone mineral density ( BM@@ D ) In the HOR@@ IZ@@ ON @-@ R@@ FT study , the A@@ cl@@ asta treatment increased in comparison to plac@@ ebo treatment by the BM@@ D at all time points . &quot;
&quot; compared to plac@@ ebo treatment , the A@@ cl@@ asta treatment resulted in an increase in the BM@@ D by 5.4 % in total hardness and by 4.3 % on the lower abdom@@ en . &quot;
&quot; clinical efficacy in men In the HOR@@ IZ@@ ON R@@ FT study , 508 men were random@@ ised and in 185 patients the BM@@ D was evaluated after 24 months . &quot;
the study was not designed to show a reduction in clinical frac@@ tures in men ; the incidence of clinical frac@@ tures was 7.5 % in A@@ cl@@ asta @-@ treated men compared to 8.7 % in plac@@ ebo .
&quot; in another study in men ( study CZ@@ OL@@ 4@@ 46@@ M@@ 230@@ 8 ) , the once yearly administration of Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at was not inferior to the percentage alter@@ ation of the lum@@ bar vert@@ eb@@ ra BM@@ D after 24 months compared to the initial value . &quot;
&quot; clinical efficacy of the treatment in Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get des Kno@@ chens A@@ cl@@ asta was examined for patients aged over 30 years with radi@@ ologically confirmed , especially light to moderate Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the bone ( mean ser@@ um @-@ level of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase in accordance with the 2,@@ 6@@ fold up to 3.0@@ fold age @-@ specific upper normal value when recording into the study ) . &quot;
11 The efficacy of an in@@ fusion of 5 mg z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ acid compared to the intake of 30 mg ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate once daily during 2 months has been proven in two six months comparative studies .
the combined results were observed after 6 months a similar decrease in pain strength and pain influ@@ encing compared to the initial value for A@@ cl@@ asta and Ris@@ ed@@ ron .
patients who were classified as Respon@@ der in the end of the six @-@ month study ( responded to the therapy ) could be included in a follow @-@ up phase .
&quot; from 143 with A@@ cl@@ asta and 107 with ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate treated patients who participated in the follow @-@ up study , the therapeutic approach for patients treated with A@@ cl@@ asta compared to 71 of the patients treated with ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate could be maintained during an average duration of the follow @-@ up phase of 18 months after application . &quot;
&quot; unique and multiple 5 and 15 minutes lasting in@@ fusion of 2 , 4 , 8 and 16 mg Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid in 64 patients showed the following pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data , which proved to be dos@@ is@@ independent . &quot;
&quot; after that , the plasma speed decreased rapidly from &lt; 10 % of the maximum value after 4 h and &lt; 1 % after 24 h , followed by a long @-@ lasting phase very low concentration , no more than 0.1 % of the maximum value . &quot;
&quot; rapid bi@@ polar dis@@ appearance from the big cycle with half @-@ life times t ½ α 0,@@ 24 and t ½ β 1,@@ 87 hours , followed by a long Eli@@ mination phase with a termin@@ al elimination period t ½ g 146 hours . &quot;
&quot; the early distribution phases ( α and β , with the above t ½ -@@ values ) presum@@ ably represent the rapid res@@ or@@ ption in the bones and ex@@ cre@@ tion over the kid@@ neys . &quot;
&quot; in the first 24 hours , 39 ± 16 % of the administered dose is found in the urine , while the rest is mainly tied to bone tissue . &quot;
&quot; the total body Clear@@ ance is independent of the dose 5,@@ 04 ± 2.5 l / h and remains un@@ affected by gender , age , race or body weight . &quot;
&quot; an extension of the in@@ fusion time of 5 to 15 minutes resulted in the decrease of the Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid concentration by 30 % at the end of in@@ fusion , but had no effect on the surface under the curve ( plasma concentration against time ) . &quot;
&quot; reduced clearance of met@@ abolic substances met@@ ab@@ oli@@ zed by cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom enzyme systems is unlikely , because Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ acid is not met@@ ab@@ oli@@ zed in humans and because they are a weak or no more direct and / or ir@@ reversible , metabol@@ ised inhibit@@ or of the P@@ 450@@ - &quot;
&quot; special patient groups ( see section 4.2 ) The ren@@ al Clear@@ ance of the Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid cor@@ related with the Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance , namely 75 ± 33 % of the Cre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance , and was in the 64 examined patients in the mean 84 ± 29 ml / min ( range 22 to 143 ml / min ) . &quot;
this results in an easy ( Cl@@ c@@ r = 50@@ - 80 ml / min ) and an even kidney function distur@@ b@@ ance down to 35 ml / min does not require dose adaptation of the Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid .
&quot; because for severe kidney function distur@@ b@@ ance ( cre@@ at@@ in@@ in- Clear@@ ance &lt; 30 ml / min ) only limited data are available , no statements are possible for this population . &quot;
acute toxic@@ ity The highest non @-@ let@@ al intra@@ ven@@ ous single dose was 10 mg / kg body weight and at rats 0.6 mg / kg body weight .
&quot; in the case of studies in dogs single doses of 1.0 mg / kg ( based on AU@@ C the 6@@ fold of the recommended humane therapeutic exposure ) , administered over a period of 15 minutes , well and without a ren@@ al influence . &quot;
&quot; chronic and chronic toxic@@ ity In studies with intra@@ ven@@ ous application , the ren@@ al toler@@ ability of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ acid in rats was administered in 3 @-@ day intervals ; in dogs a 15 @-@ minute in@@ fusion of 0.25 mg / kg , administered in intervals of 2- 3 weeks ( a cum@@ ulative dose that corresponds to the 7@@ fold of the human @-@ therapeutic exposure , related to the AU@@ C , corresponds ) . &quot;
&quot; in long @-@ term studies with repeated use in accumulated ex@@ positions which exceeded the maximum of intended human exposure , toxic@@ ological effects in other organs , including the Gast@@ ro@@ intestinal tract and the liver , as well as at the intra@@ ven@@ ous injection point . &quot;
&quot; the most common findings in studies with repeated use was an increased primary spon@@ gi@@ osa in the met@@ ap@@ hy@@ sis of the long bones of animals in the growth phase with nearly all dos@@ ages , an inf@@ estation that reflects the pharmac@@ ological , anti @-@ res@@ or@@ p@@ tive effect of the substance . &quot;
rats observed a ter@@ ato@@ gen@@ eity in doses of 0.2 mg / kg as outer and inner ( vis@@ cer@@ al ) ab@@ norm@@ alities and such of skel@@ eton .
&quot; rab@@ bits were not observed ter@@ ato@@ genic effects or embr@@ yo @-@ fet@@ al effects , although the mat@@ ernal toxic@@ ity at 0.1 mg / kg was marked as a result of the reduced ser@@ um calcium level . &quot;
&quot; if the medicine is not immediately used , the user is responsible for the storage period following preparation and the conditions before the application ; normally 24 h at 2 ° C to 8 ° C should not be exceeded . &quot;

&quot; Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ acid is a representative of a sub @-@ class that is called bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates , and is used to treat oste@@ opor@@ osis in post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women , oste@@ opor@@ osis in men and the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the bone . &quot;
&quot; decre@@ asing blood levels of sex hormones , especially est@@ ro@@ gens , which are formed from and@@ ro@@ gens , play a role in the rather gradual loss of bone mass observed in men . &quot;
&quot; at the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get the bone structure is too fast , and new bone material is structured un@@ ordered , which weak@@ ens the bone material as normal . &quot;
&quot; A@@ cl@@ asta works by restor@@ ing the bone structure again norm@@ alized , thereby ensuring a normal bone formation and thus gives strength to the bone . &quot;
&quot; if you are in dental treatment or undergo a dental surgery , tell your doctor that you are treated with A@@ cl@@ asta . &quot;
&quot; when using A@@ cl@@ asta with other medicines , please inform your doctor , pharmac@@ ist or nursing staff if you use other drugs / or have recently taken / applied , even if it is not prescription drugs . &quot;
&quot; for your doctor , it is particularly important to know if you are taking drugs , known to which it is known to damage the kid@@ neys . &quot;
&quot; when using A@@ cl@@ asta together with food and beverages , you are concerned that you take sufficient liquid in accordance with the instructions of your doctor before and after the treatment with A@@ cl@@ asta . &quot;
oste@@ opor@@ osis The usual dose is 5 mg once a year that is administered by your doctor or nursing staff as in@@ fusion into a v@@ ein .
&quot; if you have recently broken the hip , it is recommended to make the administration of A@@ cl@@ asta two or more weeks after the operational supply of the hip frac@@ ture . &quot;
&quot; Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get The usual dose is 5 mg , which is administered by your doctor or nursing staff as in@@ fusion into a v@@ ein . &quot;
&quot; since A@@ cl@@ asta works for a long time , you may need another dose after one year or longer . &quot;
it is important to follow these instructions carefully so that the calcium level in your blood is not too low in your blood during the in@@ fusion .
&quot; at Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , A@@ cl@@ asta can work longer than a year , and your doctor will inform you if you need a renewed treatment . &quot;
&quot; if the administration of A@@ cl@@ asta is missed , please contact your doctor or hospital immediately to arrange a new appointment . &quot;
&quot; before ending the treatment with A@@ cl@@ asta If you are considering the ending of treatment with A@@ cl@@ asta , please take your next doctor &apos;s date and discuss it with your doctor . &quot;
&quot; side effects in connection with the first in@@ fusion often occur ( with more than 30 % of patients ) , but are less frequent after the subsequent in@@ fu@@ sions . &quot;
&quot; fever and ch@@ ills , muscle or joint pain and head@@ aches , occur within the first three days after the administration of A@@ cl@@ asta . &quot;
&quot; currently it is uncle@@ ar whether A@@ cl@@ asta does not cause this irregular heart@@ beat , but you should tell your doctor if you notice such symptoms with you after you have received A@@ cl@@ asta . &quot;

&quot; please inform your doctor , pharmac@@ ist or nursing staff , if one of the listed side effects will significantly affect you or you notice side effects that are not listed in this utility . &quot;
&quot; if the medicine is not immediately used , the user is responsible for the storage period and conditions until the application ; normally 24 h at 2 ° C to 8 ° C should not be exceeded . &quot;
patients with a recently low @-@ traumatic stress frac@@ ture is recommended to make the in@@ fusion of A@@ cl@@ asta two or more weeks after surgical treatment of hip frac@@ ture .
&quot; before and after the administration of A@@ cl@@ asta , patients have to be sufficiently treated with liquid ; this is particularly important in patients receiving di@@ ure@@ tic therapy . &quot;
&quot; due to the rapid inser@@ tion of the effect of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ acid on bone structure , a temporary , sometimes sy@@ mpt@@ om@@ atic , hypo@@ kal@@ emia develops , whose maximum usually occurs within the first 10 days after the in@@ fusion of A@@ cl@@ asta . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it is very advisable to ensure adequate intake of calcium in patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , according to at least twice daily 500 mg of elementary calcium , for at least 10 days after the administration of A@@ cl@@ asta . &quot;
&quot; in patients with a low @-@ traumatic stress frac@@ ture , an initial dose of 50,000 to 12@@ 5.000 I.@@ E. or@@ ally or in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular vitamin D is recommended prior to in@@ fusion of A@@ cl@@ asta . &quot;

A@@ comp@@ lia is additionally applied to a diet and exercise for the treatment of adult patients who suffer from o@@ besity ( body mass index - BM@@ I ) of 30 kg / m ² or above or that are over@@ weight ( BM@@ I of 27 kg / m ² or above ) and additionally one or more I
&quot; in addition , four studies were carried out over 7 000 patients in which A@@ comp@@ lia was used as a suppor@@ tive agent for smoking in comparison to a plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in contrast to the studies on the setting of smoking , no uniform results showed , so that the effect of A@@ comp@@ lia was hard to assess in this area of application . &quot;
&quot; which risk is associated with A@@ comp@@ lia ? he The most common side effects of A@@ comp@@ lia , which were observed during the studies ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) , were nau@@ sea ( nau@@ sea ) and infections of the upper respiratory tract . &quot;
&quot; it may also not be used in patients who suffer from an existing severe depression or be treated with anti@@ de@@ press@@ ants , as it can strengthen the risk of depression and among other things , in a small minority of patients su@@ ici@@ dal thoughts . &quot;
&quot; caution is advisable when using A@@ comp@@ lia with medicines such as k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole or it@@ rac@@ on@@ az@@ ole ( medicines for fung@@ al infections ) , Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( a remedy for using HI@@ V@@ - infection ) , tel@@ i@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or clari@@ thro@@ my@@ cin ( antibiotics ) . &quot;

A@@ comp@@ lia is not recommended for use in children and adol@@ escents under 18 years of age due to the lack of data on efficacy and harm@@ lessness .
&quot; La Dep@@ res@@ sive disorders or mood changes with depres@@ sive symptoms were reported to up to 10 % , su@@ ici@@ dal thoughts with up to 1 % of patients receiving Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant ( see section 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; in case of depres@@ sive disorders , Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant may not be applied unless the benefit of treatment in an individual case out@@ weighs the risk ( see section 4.3 and 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; he also in patients who - besides the o@@ besity - no recogni@@ zable risks , may occur depres@@ sive reactions . &quot;
relatives or other nearby persons ) are indicated that it is necessary to monitor the new occurrence of such symptoms and immediately obtain medical advice if these symptoms occur .
• El@@ der patients The efficacy and harm@@ lessness of Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant in the treatment of patients over 75 years have not been sufficiently shown .
patients with cardiovascular disease ( m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction or stroke ) less than 6 months were excluded from studies with Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant . l@@ n

abstract of the EP@@ AR to the public The present document is a summary of the European Public Service Report ( EP@@ AR ) which explains how the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) has judged the conducted studies to get recommendations regarding the use of the drug .
&quot; Ac@@ tos is used to treat type 2 diabetes ( also known as non @-@ insulin @-@ dependent diabetes ) . • It can be used alone ( mon@@ otherapy ) in patients ( especially over@@ weight patients ) , where met@@ form@@ in ( a diabetes medication ) is not shown . &quot;
&quot; it can be applied in addition to met@@ form@@ in in patients ( especially over@@ weight patients ) , which cannot be satis@@ factory with met@@ form@@ in alone in the highest toler@@ able dose . &quot;
&quot; in combination with a sul@@ f@@ onic acid or insulin , the previous dose of sul@@ phon@@ yl har@@ nit@@ ine or insulin can be retained with the start of the acet@@ yl@@ phen@@ emia ( low blood sugar ) ; in this case , the dose of sul@@ fon@@ c@@ emia or insulin should be reduced . &quot;
this means that the body &apos;s insulin can be better utilized and the blood sugar level sin@@ ks so that type 2 diabetes is better adjusted .
&quot; in more than 1,@@ 400 patients the efficacy of Ac@@ tos in Tri@@ ple@@ therapy was examined ; the patients received a combination of met@@ form@@ in with a sul@@ phon@@ yl substance , in addition , they received up to 3.5 years either Ac@@ tos or plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in the studies , the concentration of a substance in the blood ( gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in , H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) was measured , indicating how well the blood sugar is set . &quot;
&quot; Ac@@ tos led to a reduction in the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c value , which allows blood glucose levels to be reduced by 15 mg , 30 mg and 45 mg . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the Tri@@ ple@@ therapy study , the effect of the additional gift of Ac@@ tos for the existing treatment with met@@ form@@ in and a sul@@ phon@@ ate resin in a decrease of H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c values was 0.@@ 94 % , while the additional administration of plac@@ ebo led to a decrease of 0.@@ 35 % . &quot;
&quot; in a small study where the combination of Ac@@ tos and insulin was examined in 289 patients , the patients , the Ac@@ tos increased in addition to insulin , reduced the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c values of 0.@@ 69 % after 6 months compared to 0.@@ 14 % in patients who also took plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects associated with Ac@@ tos were visual disorders , infections of the upper respiratory tract ( col@@ ds ) , weight gain and hypo@@ an@@ aes@@ thesia ( reduced sensitivity to stimul@@ i ) . &quot;
&quot; Ac@@ tos may not be applied in patients who are possibly hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic to pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one or one of the other components ) , or in patients with liver problems , heart failure or di@@ ab@@ etic k@@ eto@@ aci@@ do@@ sis ( high ket@@ one level - acid levels - in the blood ) . &quot;
it has been decided that Ac@@ tos should serve as an alternative to standard treatment with met@@ form@@ in in patients with met@@ form@@ in .
&quot; October 2000 , the European Commission issued Tak@@ eda Europe R &amp; D Centre Limited approved an approval for Ac@@ tos in the whole European Union . &quot;
&quot; the tablets are white until whi@@ tish , round , arch@@ ed and carry on one side the marker &quot; &quot; 15 &quot; &quot; and on the other side the inscription &quot; &quot; Ac@@ tos . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one is also indicated for the combination with insulin in patients with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus whose blood sugar is in@@ adequate with insulin and is un@@ suitable for met@@ form@@ in due to contra@@ indications or intoler@@ ance ( see section 4.4 ) .
&quot; to use pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one in patients under 18 years of age , no data is available , so the application in this age group is not recommended . &quot;
&quot; in patients suffering from the presence of at least one risk factor ( e.g. earlier heart attack or sy@@ mpt@@ om@@ atic cor@@ on@@ ary heart disease ) , the doctor should start treatment with the lowest available dose and increase the dose gradually . &quot;
&quot; patients should be observed in signs and symptoms of heart failure , weight gain or o@@ ede@@ ma , especially those with reduced cardi@@ ac reserve . &quot;
&quot; patients should be observed in signs and symptoms of heart failure , weight gain and o@@ ede@@ ma when used in combination with insulin . &quot;
cardiovascular out@@ come study with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one in patients under 75 years with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and pre @-@ existing ma@@ kro@@ v@@ ascular disease has been carried out .
&quot; in this study , an increase in reports on heart failure , however , did not lead to an increase in mort@@ ality in the study . &quot;
&quot; in patients with increased output liver enzymes ( AL@@ T &gt; 2,5 x upper limit of the normal range ) or with other signs of liver disease , Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one must not be used . &quot;
&quot; if the AL@@ T mirror is increased to 3 times the upper limit of the standard range , the liver enzymes are to be checked again as soon as possible . &quot;
&quot; if a patient develops symptoms that point to a hep@@ atic dysfunction , such as un@@ explained nau@@ sea , v@@ om@@ iting , tor@@ sion pain@@ s , fatigue , loss of appetite and / or dark res@@ ins , the liver enzymes are to be checked . &quot;
the decision whether the patient &apos;s treatment is continued with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on should be conducted before the clinical evaluation of the laboratory parameters .
&quot; in clinical trials with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one , a dose @-@ dependent weight gain has been detected , which can be caused by fat deposits and in some cases associated with fluid retention . &quot;
&quot; as a result of hem@@ odi@@ lution , a minor reduction in the mean hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in values ( relative reduction by 4 % ) and hem@@ at@@ oc@@ r@@ its ( relative reduction by 4.1 % ) occurred under the therapy with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one . &quot;
similar changes were observed in patients under Met@@ form@@ in ( relative reduction of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in by 3 @-@ 4 % and hem@@ at@@ oc@@ r@@ its by 1 @-@ 2 % and hem@@ at@@ oc@@ r@@ its by 1 @-@ 3.2 % ) .
&quot; as a result of increased insulin sensitivity , patients suffering from pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one as oral two @-@ fold or triple combination therapy with insulin , or as a dual combination therapy with insulin , is the risk of dose @-@ dependent hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia . &quot;
&quot; the market launch was reported under the treatment with thi@@ az@@ oli@@ d@@ indi@@ an , including Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on , a incidence or deteri@@ oration of a di@@ ab@@ etic mac@@ ular ede@@ ma with a reduction in visual acu@@ ity . &quot;
&quot; it is uncle@@ ar whether there is a direct link between taking pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one and the occurrence of mac@@ ular ede@@ ma , but prescribed doctors should be aware of the possibility of mac@@ ular ede@@ ma when patients report about distur@@ bances of visual acu@@ ity ; a suitable oph@@ thalm@@ ological clari@@ fication should be considered . &quot;
&quot; in a summar@@ izing analysis of messages of unwanted , random@@ ized , double @-@ blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3,5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients treated with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on &quot;
&quot; the calculated questionn@@ aire was 1.9 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in patients treated with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one , and 1.1 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in women treated with comparative medications . &quot;
&quot; in the Pro@@ Active study , a study of 3.5 years for the investigation of cardiovascular events , frac@@ tures occurred at 44 / 870 ( 5.1 % ; 1.0 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) with patients treated with comparative medications . &quot;
&quot; patients should be aware of the possibility of pregnancy , and if a patient wishes to pregnancy or this occurs , treatment is ab@@ sent ( see section 4.6 ) . &quot;
&quot; studies for the investigation of the interactions have shown that Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on does not exercise relevant effects on pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics or pharmac@@ o@@ dynamics of di@@ go@@ ox@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , phen@@ proc@@ ou@@ mon and met@@ form@@ in . &quot;
&quot; drug interactions that are met@@ ab@@ oli@@ zed by these enzymes , e.g. oral contrac@@ ep@@ tiv@@ a , cy@@ clos@@ por@@ in , calcium channel blo@@ cker and H@@ M@@ G@@ Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors are not expected . &quot;
simultaneous application of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one with gem@@ fibro@@ zi@@ l ( cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8@@ - In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or ) resulted in an increase in the AU@@ C of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on by 3 times .
the simultaneous application of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on with Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 2@@ C8 @-@ induc@@ tor ) resulted in a reduction in the AU@@ C of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one by 54 % .
this is due to the fact that in the treatment with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on the hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and increased insulin resistance of the mat@@ ernity reduced and thereby decre@@ asing the availability of the met@@ abolic sub@@ str@@ ates for the fet@@ al growth .
&quot; very common &gt; 1 / 10 ; often &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ; occasionally &gt; 1 / 1000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ; rare &gt; 1 / 10000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ; very rare &lt; 1 / 10000 , single cases : unknown ( not estimated from present data ) . &quot;
these lead to a temporary change in the turbine and the lens t@@ apping index as they are also observed in other hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic agents .
&quot; in clinical trials with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on AL@@ T asc@@ ents often appeared as often as plac@@ ebo , but more rarely than in comparison groups under Met@@ form@@ in or Sul@@ fon@@ yl@@ resin . &quot;
in an out@@ come study in patients with pre @-@ existing advanced macro@@ v@@ ascular disease the incidence of severe heart failure under Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on was 1.6 % higher than under plac@@ ebo when Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on res@@ p .
&quot; since the introduction of the market , rarely has been reported about heart failure under Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on , however , if Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on was used in combination with insulin or in patients with heart failure in an@@ am@@ nes@@ ia . &quot;
&quot; a summary analysis of reports of adverse events relating to frac@@ tures from random@@ ised , random@@ ised , double @-@ blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients in patients treated with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one treated groups and over 7,@@ 400 patients treated with comparative medications . &quot;
&quot; in the Pro@@ Active study conducted over a period of 3.5 years , frac@@ tures occurred at 44 / 870 ( 5.1 % ) patients treated with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one patients , compared to 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ) in patients treated with comparative medications . &quot;
&quot; when taking the reported maximum dose of 120 mg / day over four days , then 180 mg / day over seven days no symptoms occurred . &quot;
&quot; Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on appears to act on the activation of specific nuclear recept@@ ors ( Per@@ ox@@ is@@ ome Pro@@ lifer@@ ator ) Rec@@ ep@@ tor @-@ γ ( PP@@ AR @-@ γ ) ) , which leads to an increased insulin sensitivity of liver , fat and skel@@ etal muscle cells . &quot;
it could be shown that Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one reduces glu@@ cos@@ e@@ production in the liver and increases the peripher@@ al glucose levels in case of insulin resistance .
a clinical trial with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on versus G@@ lic@@ la@@ zi@@ d as mon@@ otherapy was continued over two years to investigate the time until after leaving the therapeutic effect ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ≥ 8.0 % after the first 6 months of treatment ) .
&quot; at the time after two years after the start of therapy , blood glucose control ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c &lt; 8.0 % ) could be maintained by pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one at 69 % of patients treated ( compared to 50 % of patients under G@@ lic@@ la@@ zi@@ d ) . &quot;
&quot; in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled trial for 12 months , patients whose blood sugar was in@@ adequate despite three months of optimization with insulin was random@@ ised to Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on or plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in patients under Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on , the mean H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c reduced 0.@@ 45 % , compared to the patients who continued to receive insulin ; a reduction in insulin intake in the group treated with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on was observed . &quot;
in clinical trials over a year under Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on a statisti@@ cally significant decrease of the alb@@ um@@ in / Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in quot@@ i@@ ents compared to the initial values .
&quot; the effect of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on ( mon@@ otherapy with 45 mg versus plac@@ ebo ) was tested in a small , 18 @-@ week examination of type 2 di@@ abe@@ tics . &quot;
&quot; in most clinical studies , compared to plac@@ ebo , a reduction of the overall plasma tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de and the free fatty acids and a rise in the HD@@ L cholesterol levels as well as slightly , but clin@@ ically not significantly increased L@@ DL cholesterol levels observed . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials over a period of up to two years , Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on reduced the total plas@@ mas gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de and free fatty acids and increased the HD@@ L cholesterol levels . &quot;
&quot; compared to plac@@ ebo , no statisti@@ cally significant increase in L@@ DL cholesterol was found under Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on , while met@@ form@@ in and G@@ lic@@ la@@ zi@@ d have been observed . &quot;
&quot; in a study of 20 weeks , Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on reduced not only the tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de levels , but also improved the post@@ p@@ ran@@ dial increased tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de levels , this has an effect on tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de absorption and the hep@@ atic tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de synthesis . &quot;
&quot; in the Pro@@ Active study , a cardiovascular out@@ come study , 5@@ 238 patients were random@@ ised with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and pre @-@ existing ma@@ kro@@ v@@ ascular disease in groups , who received either Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on or plac@@ ebo over a period of up to 3.5 years . &quot;
&quot; after oral application , Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one is quickly res@@ or@@ ted , with the top concentrations of un@@ modified pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one in plasma usually 2 hours after application . &quot;
&quot; on this basis , the contribution of M @-@ IV is equivalent to the effectiveness of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one , whereas the relative effectiveness of M @-@ II is minimal . &quot;
&quot; in interaction studies , Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on has no relevant effect on pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics or pharmac@@ o@@ dynamics of di@@ go@@ ox@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , phen@@ proc@@ ou@@ mon and met@@ form@@ in . &quot;
the simultaneous application of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one with gem@@ fibro@@ zi@@ l ( cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8@@ - In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or ) or with Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 2@@ C8 @-@ induc@@ tor ) increases and lowers the plasma concentration of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on ( see section 4.5 ) .
&quot; after oral application of radio@@ active pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one in humans , the marker was found mainly in the subject ( 55 % ) and to a lesser extent in the urine ( 45 % ) . &quot;
&quot; the mean plasma elimination time of unchanged pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on amounts to 5 @-@ 6 hours , and the total active metabol@@ ites is 16 - 23 hours . &quot;
&quot; the plasma concentrations of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on and its metabol@@ ites are lower in patients with reduced kidney function than in healthy volunteers , but the rates of oral Clear@@ ance of the mother substance are similar . &quot;
&quot; toxic@@ ological studies occurred with mice , rats , dogs and monkeys according to repeated administration plasma volume magni@@ fication with hem@@ odi@@ lution , an@@ a@@ emia and reversible ec@@ centric heart hyper@@ tro@@ phy . &quot;
this is due to the fact that with the treatment with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on the hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and elevated insulin resistance of the mat@@ ernity reduced and thereby decre@@ asing the availability of the met@@ abolic sub@@ str@@ ates for the fet@@ al growth .
&quot; in long @-@ term studies ( up to 2 years ) , increased incidence of hyper@@ pl@@ asia ( male and female rats ) and tum@@ ors ( in male rats ) of the bladder epithel@@ ium were induced . &quot;
&quot; in an animal model of family aden@@ omat@@ ous poly@@ posi@@ s ( FA@@ P ) , treatment with two other thi@@ az@@ oli@@ d@@ indi@@ ans led to increased frequency of col@@ ont@@ um@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; the tablets are white to whi@@ tish , round , flat and wear on one side the marker &quot; 30 &quot; and on the other hand the inscription &quot; Ac@@ tos . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the calculated questionn@@ aire was 1.9 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in patients treated with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one , and 1.1 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in women treated with comparative medications . &quot;
&quot; in the Pro@@ Active study , a study of 3.5 years for the investigation of cardiovascular events , frac@@ tures occurred at 44 / 870 ( 5.1 % ; 1.0 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) with patients treated with comparative medications . &quot;
&quot; in another study of two years , the effects of a combination therapy of met@@ form@@ in were examined with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one or G@@ lic@@ la@@ zi@@ d . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials over 1 year , under Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on , a statisti@@ cally significant decrease of the alb@@ um@@ in / Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in quot@@ i@@ ents compared to the initial values . &quot;
&quot; in a study of 20 weeks , Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on reduced not only the tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de levels , but also improved the post@@ p@@ ran@@ dial increased tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de levels , this has an effect on the tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de absorption and the hep@@ atic Tr@@ y@@ g@@ liz@@ eric synthesis . &quot;
&quot; although the study presented the target with regard to its primary end@@ point , which presented a combination of the overall mort@@ ality , non @-@ mort@@ al m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ ac ar@@ ct , leg amp@@ utation above the ank@@ le , cor@@ on@@ ary re@@ as@@ cul@@ ari@@ zation and re@@ as@@ cul@@ ar@@ isation of the leg arter@@ ies , the results suggest that with the intake of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one no kar@@ di@@ ov@@ as@@ cul@@ ary long @-@ term risks are linked . &quot;

&quot; Ac@@ tr@@ aph@@ ane was examined in a total of 294 patients with type 1 diabetes , where the pancre@@ as does not produce insulin , and type 2 diabetes in which the body is unable to use insulin effectively . &quot;
the study was measured after 12 weeks the concentration of a substance ( gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) which indicates how well the blood sugar is set .
&quot; Ac@@ tr@@ aph@@ ane led to a decrease in the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c mirror , indicating that blood sugar levels were similar to another human insulin . &quot;
&quot; Ac@@ tr@@ aph@@ ane should not be applied to patients , possibly hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to human insulin ( r@@ DNA ) or one of the other components . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the doses of Ac@@ tr@@ aph@@ ane must be adjusted if it is administered together with a number of other medicines that may affect the blood sugar ( see the complete list is the package insert ) . &quot;
the Committee on Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of Ac@@ tr@@ aph@@ ane are out@@ weighing in the treatment of diabetes against the risks .
&quot; in October 2002 , the European Commission issued a permit for the company Nov@@ o Nor@@ disk A / S for the launch of Ac@@ tr@@ aph@@ ane in the entire European Union . &quot;
&quot; pre @-@ mixed insulin products are normally used once or twice daily , if a quick initial action is desired along with a longer lasting effect . &quot;
the injection needle must be left under the skin for at least 6 seconds to ensure that the entire dose was inj@@ ected .
&quot; patients whose blood sugar is significantly improved by an intensive insulin therapy , the hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia warning symptoms can be perceived and should accordingly be advised . &quot;
&quot; any change in terms of strength , brand ( manufacturer ) , insulin type ( fast acting , bi@@ polar , long @-@ acting insulin , etc . ) , type of insulin ( animal insulin , human insulin or insulin analog ) and / or manufacturing method ( due to re@@ combin@@ ant DNA compared to insulin @-@ animal origin ) may cause a change in dosage is required . &quot;
&quot; if a dose adjustment is required when changing to Ac@@ tr@@ aph@@ ane in the patient , this may be necessary during the first dose or during the first weeks or months after the conversion . &quot;
&quot; some patients , in which hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ em@@ ic reactions occurred after a change from animal to human insulin , reported that the early warning symptoms of hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia were less pronounced or different than in their previous insulin . &quot;
&quot; travelling across multiple time zones , the patient should be advised to pick up the advice of his physician , as such journeys may cause insulin and meals to be used or taken at other times . &quot;
the doctor must therefore consider possible interactions in the therapy and ask his patients to ask for other medicines taken by them .
&quot; 4 B@@ oth hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia as well as hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia , which can occur in a non @-@ sufficient controlled di@@ ab@@ et@@ es@@ therapy , increase the risk of ab@@ norm@@ alities and fertility in uter@@ o . &quot;
severe hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ em@@ ias can lead to un@@ consciousness and / or cr@@ amps and end with temporary or permanent disorders of the brain function and even death .
diseases of the nervous system occasional - Peri@@ pher@@ al Neurop@@ athy A rapid improvement of blood sugar control can be associated with complaints related to acute painful neu@@ rop@@ athy and usually reversible .
&quot; 5 A intensi@@ fication of insulin therapy with an ab@@ rupt improvement in blood sugar , however , can be associated with a temporary deteri@@ oration of di@@ ab@@ etic ret@@ in@@ opathy . &quot;
diseases of the skin and the lower skin tissue casual - Li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy On the injection point can develop a li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy when failed to change the inser@@ tion points within the injection area .
&quot; general conditions and complaints at the location occasional - Local hyper@@ sensitivity reaction to the injection point Dur@@ ing the insulin therapy can occur local hyper@@ sensitivity reactions ( red@@ ness , swelling , it@@ ching , pain and hem@@ at@@ oma at the injection point ) . &quot;
&quot; diseases of the immune system occasional - Ur@@ tik@@ aria , Ex@@ an@@ them Very rare - an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ tic reactions symptoms of gener@@ alized hyper@@ sensitivity , including gener@@ alized skin r@@ ash , it@@ ching , g@@ astro@@ intestinal disorders , breathing difficulties , heart kno@@ bs , low blood pressure and power@@ lessness / un@@ consciousness . &quot;
&quot; however , hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia can develop gradually : • Light hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia can be treated by oral intake of glucose or sug@@ ary foods . &quot;
• Heavy hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ em@@ ias with un@@ consciousness are treated with in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of glu@@ c@@ agon ( 0.5 to 1.0 mg ) by an in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of glu@@ c@@ agon ( 0.5 to 1.0 mg ) by an in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of glucose ( 0.5 to 1.0 mg ) .
&quot; the effect starts within half an hour , the active maximum occurs within 2 to 8 hours and the entire duration of the activity is up to 24 hours . &quot;
res@@ or@@ ption The res@@ or@@ ption profile lies in the fact that it is a mixture of insulin products with fast or delayed res@@ or@@ ption .
a number of spl@@ itting ( hydro@@ ly@@ sis ) places on the human insulin molec@@ ule were considered ; none of the metabol@@ ites formed by spl@@ itting is active .

it is recommended to increase the temperature of the insulin to room temperature ( not above 25 ° C ) before it is res@@ us@@ pen@@ ed according to the manual for the first use .
&quot; some patients , in which hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ em@@ ic reactions occurred after a change from animal to human insulin , reported that the early warning symptoms of hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia were less pronounced or different than in their previous insulin . &quot;

&quot; Ac@@ trap@@ id must not be applied to patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive to insulin , human ( r@@ DNA ) or any other component . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the doses of Ac@@ trap@@ id may be adjusted if it is administered together with a number of other medicines that can affect blood sugar . &quot;
&quot; in October 2002 , the European Commission issued a permit for the company Nov@@ o Nor@@ disk A / S for the launch of Ac@@ trap@@ id in the entire European Union . &quot;
&quot; when two types of insulin are mixed , the amount of insulin must first be absorbed , then the amount of insulin acting . &quot;
&quot; 3 If a dose adjustment is required when changing to Ac@@ trap@@ id in the patient , this may be necessary during the first dose or during the first weeks or months after the conversion . &quot;
&quot; travelling across multiple time zones , the patient should be advised to pick up the advice of his physician , as such journeys may cause insulin and meals to be used or taken at other times . &quot;

&quot; if the ur@@ ic acid level is still more than 6 mg per dec@@ il@@ iter after two to four weeks , the dose may be increased to 120 mg once a day . &quot;
&quot; during the first treatment months , g@@ ing@@ attacks can still occur ; therefore , it is recommended that patients may use A@@ den@@ ur@@ ic for at least during the first six months of treatment with A@@ den@@ ur@@ ic . &quot;
the medicine is not recommended in children and in patients who had an organ transplan@@ t since it was not examined for these groups .
&quot; in the first study , attended by 1 0@@ 72 patients , the efficacy of three different aden@@ ur@@ ic dos@@ ages ( once daily 80 , 120 and 240 mg ) was compared with the plac@@ ebo ( bog@@ us drug ) and Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( another medicine for the treatment of hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ a@@ emia ) . &quot;
&quot; in the second study , two doses of A@@ den@@ ur@@ ic ( once daily 80 and 120 mg ) were compared to 7@@ 62 patients with Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol . &quot;
in both studies Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol was used in a dose of once daily 300 mg ; patients with kidney problems received only 100 mg per day .
the main indicator of the efficacy was the number of patients whose ur@@ ic acid levels in the blood was under 6 mg / dl in the blood during the last three measurements .
&quot; in the first study we had 48 % ( 126 of 262 ) of patients who took A@@ den@@ ur@@ ic in a dose of once daily 80 mg , and 65 % ( 175 of 269 ) of patients who once daily intake 120 mg , during the last three measurements a ur@@ ic acid level in the blood of below 6 mg / dl . &quot;
&quot; in comparison to this , this was the case with 22 % ( 60 of 268 ) of patients under Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol and none of the 134 patients under plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of aden@@ ur@@ ic ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are head@@ aches , di@@ arr@@ ho@@ ea , nau@@ sea ( nau@@ sea ) , r@@ ash and ab@@ normal liver values . &quot;
especially in patients with heart complaints in the pre@@ history there may also be an increased risk of certain side effects affecting the heart and blood vessels .
&quot; the Committee on Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that A@@ den@@ ur@@ ic was more effective in lowering the ur@@ ic acid level in the blood as allo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol , but also a higher risk of side effects in connection with the heart and blood vessels . &quot;
&quot; treatment of chronic hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ emia in diseases , which have already led to urine deposits ( including one from the medical history known or currently available g@@ elling node and / or a g@@ le@@ arthritis ) . &quot;
&quot; if the ser@@ um har@@ n@@ age is still &gt; 6 mg / dl ( 357 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) after 2 @-@ 4 weeks , a dose increase can be taken into consideration at AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 120 mg 1 x daily . &quot;
&quot; in patients with severe kidney function restriction , efficacy and safety have not been fully investigated ( Cre@@ at@@ in@@ in- Clear@@ ance &lt; 30 ml / min , see section 5.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; children and adol@@ escents Since there are no experiences in children and adol@@ escents , the use of Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at in this patient group is not recommended . &quot;
&quot; transplan@@ t recipients Since there are no experiences in organ transplan@@ ts , the application of Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at in this patient group is not recommended ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
cardiovascular disease in patients with isch@@ em@@ ic heart disease or de@@ compens@@ ated heart failure is not recommended for the treatment with Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at ( see section 4.8 ) .
&quot; as with other hard @-@ acid medicines , it is possible to arrive at acute toxic@@ ity during the course of treatment , because it is possible to mobili@@ ze urine drainage in the tissues by lowering the ser@@ um resin . &quot;
&quot; B. in mal@@ ign@@ ant diseases and their treatment , Les@@ ch@@ - Ny@@ han &apos;s syndrome ) the absolute concentration of X@@ an@@ thin in the urine in rare cases so far increase that it comes to a deposit in the ur@@ inary tract . &quot;
&quot; during the clinical trials of phase 3 , slight ab@@ norm@@ alities of liver function were observed in patients treated with Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at ( 3.5 % ) . &quot;
&quot; it is therefore recommended to perform a liver function before the beginning of Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at@@ treatment , and in the further course of the clinical findings ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
the@@ ophy@@ l@@ line Z@@ wasn &apos;t carried out any exchange rate studies on Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at but it is known that the X@@ O in@@ hibition could lead to an increase in the@@ ophy@@ l@@ lin@@ le ( a hibition of the@@ ophy@@ l@@ line metabol@@ isation was also reported for other X@@ O inhibit@@ ors ) .
&quot; in subjects , the simultaneous administration of Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at and Nap@@ ro@@ xen 250 mg 2 x per day was associated with an increase in Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ atic exposition ( C@@ MA@@ x 28 % , AU@@ C 41 % and t@@ 1 / 2 26 % ) . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials , the application of nap@@ ro@@ xen or other N@@ SA@@ R / co@@ x @-@ 2 inhibit@@ ors was not associated with a clin@@ ically significant increase of adverse events . &quot;
Col@@ chic@@ ine / In@@ dom@@ et@@ ac@@ in / Hydro@@ chlor@@ thi@@ azi@@ de / War@@ far@@ in Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at can be applied along with Col@@ chic@@ ine or In@@ dom@@ et@@ ac@@ in without requiring a dose adaptation for Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at or the other used active ingredient .
&quot; in a study of subjects , 120 mg AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 1 x daily showed a moderate 22 % increase in the AU@@ C of Des@@ i@@ pr@@ amine , a C@@ YP@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 sub@@ strate , which indicates a possible weak inhibit@@ ory effect of Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at to the C@@ YP@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 enzyme in vi@@ vo . &quot;
&quot; An@@ ta@@ zi@@ da It could be shown that the simultaneous use of a anus , the magnesium hydro@@ x@@ ide and aluminum hydro@@ x@@ ide , the absorption of Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at ( about 1 hour ) is delayed and a decrease in the C@@ MA@@ x by 32 % , but no significant change in AU@@ C . &quot;
pregnancy data on a very limited number of exposed pregn@@ ancies cannot be excluded from the side effects of Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at to pregnancy or the health of the fet@@ us / new@@ born .
&quot; experimental studies do not result in direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development or birth ( see section 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; patients should be careful when controlling a vehicle , serving machines or in the exercise of dangerous activities until they can be reasonably sure that AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C does not affect their performance . &quot;
&quot; a numer@@ ically higher incidence of cardiovascular events reported in the overall f@@ eb@@ lin@@ in@@ ol group in the pi@@ vot@@ al study phase 3 ( 1.3 versus 0.3 events per 100 patient years ) , although no statisti@@ cally significant differences were found and no caus@@ al connection with Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at could be detected . &quot;
the risk factors detected in these patients were an arter@@ ios@@ kl@@ erotic disorder and / or a m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction or a de@@ compens@@ ated heart failure in the medical history .
&quot; frequent ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasional ( ≥ 1 / 1.000 to &lt; 1 / 100 ) and rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 to &lt; 1 / 100 ) , which could stand in the treatment groups with 80 mg / 120 mg of Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at and which were reported more than once in all of Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at treatment groups , are listed below . &quot;
&quot; di@@ arr@@ he@@ a , nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting are more common in patients treated at the same time with Col@@ chic@@ ine . * * In the clinical trials , no heavy r@@ ashes or serious hyper@@ sensitivity reactions were observed . &quot;
&quot; 7 Off@@ ene long @-@ term extension studies In the open long @-@ term extension studies were 9@@ 06 patients up to 1 year long , 322 patients up to 2 years long , 57 patients up to 4 years long with Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at 80 mg / 120 mg . &quot;
the treatment related events reported during long @-@ term studies were similar to those reported in Phase 3 studies ( see table 1 ) .
&quot; the following treatment @-@ related events were reported more than once in all of Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at@@ - treatment groups ( up to 4 years with an exposure time of &gt; 1,@@ 900 patient years ) , according to indications . &quot;
the following treatment @-@ related events were either not reported in the pi@@ vot@@ al studies of Phase 3 for these cans either at all or with a lower frequency :

clinical study results The efficacy of AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C was shown in two pi@@ vot@@ al studies of Phase 3 ( AP@@ EX Study and F@@ ACT study as described below ) which were performed with 1.8@@ 32 patients with hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ a@@ emia and g@@ out .
the primary efficacy end@@ point was in each study the proportion of patients with which the last three month determined ser@@ um har@@ n@@ ace levels &lt; 6.0 mg / dl ( 357 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) were .
&quot; plac@@ ebo ( n = 134 ) , AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 80 mg 1 x daily ( n = 267 ) , AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 240 mg 1 x daily ( n = 258 ) , AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 240 mg 1 x daily ( n = 10 ) for patients with a ser@@ um canc@@ at@@ in@@ inal value at the beginning of study of &gt; 1,5 mg / dl and ≤ 2,0 mg / dl . &quot;
the AP@@ EX study showed a statisti@@ cally significant superi@@ ority of the treatment with AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 80 mg 1 x daily as well as with AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 120 mg 1 x daily compared to the treatment with conventional doses of Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg ( n = 258 ) / 100 mg ( n = 10 ) .
the F@@ ACT study showed a statisti@@ cally significant superi@@ ority of the treatment with AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 80 mg 1 x daily as well as with AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 120 mg 1 x daily compared to the treatment with the conventional dose Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg .
&quot; patients with ser@@ um cancer ( 1.5 and ≤ 2,0 mg / dl ) or 300 mg 1 x daily ( n = 509 ) were collected for analyses . * p &lt; 0.0@@ 01 versus Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol , # p &lt; 0.0@@ 01 versus 80 mg &quot;
lowering of the ser@@ um resin of the ser@@ um resin on &lt; 6.0 mg / dl ( 357 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) was observed in the doctor visit in week 2 and maintained permanently over the entire treatment .
509 patients received Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg 1 x daily ; 10 patients with ser@@ um cancer values &gt; 1.5 and &lt; 2.0 mg / dl were 100 mg 1 x daily .
primary end@@ point in the sub@@ group of patients with kidney function restriction The AP@@ EX study evaluated the efficacy in 40 patients with kidney function restriction ( i.e. h .
&quot; AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C became the primary efficacy end@@ point at 44 % ( 80 mg 1 x daily ) , 45 % ( 120 mg 1 x daily ) and 60 % ( 240 mg 1 x daily ) of the patients . &quot;
&quot; there were no clin@@ ically significant differences regarding the percentage decline of ser@@ um har@@ ness concentrations in subjects , regardless of their kidney function ( 58 % in the group with normal kidney function and 55 % in the group with severe kidney function disorders ) . &quot;
primary end@@ point in the sub@@ group of patients with ser@@ um har@@ p concentrations ≥ 10 mg / dl E@@ tw@@ a 40 % of patients ( AP@@ EX@@ - and F@@ ACT study ) had a ser@@ um har@@ ness concentration of ≥ 10 mg / dl .
the data collected in two years showed that the permanent reduction of the ser@@ um har@@ n@@ ace levels to &lt; 6 mg / dl ( &lt; 357 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) required a decrease in the incidence of g@@ out attacks ( i.e. more than 97 % of patients did not require treatment against a si@@ des@@ hi@@ ft ) .
&quot; this was associated with a reduction in the volume node size , which in 54 % of patients had a complete dis@@ appearance of the g@@ out node up to 24 months . &quot;
increased T@@ SH@@ - values ( &gt; 5.5 µ@@ l / ml ) were observed in patients receiving a long @-@ term treatment with Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at ( 5.0 % ) and also in patients who received Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( 5.8 % ) in the open long @-@ term renewal studies ( see section 4.4 ) .
in healthy volunteers the maximum plasma concentrations ( C@@ MA@@ x ) and the area under the plasma concentration curve ( AU@@ C ) from Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at after administration of simple and multiple doses of 10 mg to 120 mg dos@@ is@@ proportional .
doses between 120 mg and 300 mg are observed for Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at an increase in AU@@ C which is greater than the dose proportional increase .
after taking simple or multiple oral doses of 80 and 120 mg 1 x daily the C@@ MA@@ x is about 2.8 @-@ 3.2 µ@@ g / ml and 5.0 @-@ 5.3 µ@@ g / ml .
&quot; however , no clin@@ ically significant change was observed in the percentage decline of ser@@ um har@@ ness concentration , provided that was tested ( multiple doses of 80 mg ) . &quot;
distribution The apparent steady state distribution volume ( V@@ ss / F ) of Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at is in the range from 29 to 75 l after taking doses of 10 @-@ 300 mg .
&quot; the plasma rotation of Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at amounts to approx . 99.@@ 2 % ( primary binding on alb@@ um@@ in ) and is consistent with the concentration width , which is reached with doses of 80 and 120 mg . &quot;
&quot; in vitro studies in human liver micro@@ scope , these oxid@@ ative metabol@@ ites are mainly formed by C@@ YP@@ 1@@ A1 , C@@ YP@@ 1@@ A2 , C@@ YP@@ 2@@ C8 or C@@ YP@@ 2@@ C@@ 9 , and that Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at@@ glu@@ cur@@ on@@ ide is primarily created by U@@ GT 1@@ A1 , 1@@ A8 and 1@@ A@@ 9 . &quot;
&quot; after taking a 80 mg dose of 14@@ C @-@ marked Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at , approximately 49 % of the dose found in the urine as unchanged Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at ( 3 % ) , its known oxid@@ ative metabol@@ ites and their con@@ jug@@ ates ( 13 % ) and other unknown metabol@@ ites ( 3 % ) . &quot;
&quot; in addition to ex@@ cre@@ tion over the urine , approximately 45 % of the dose in the chair found itself as unchanged Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at ( 12 % ) , acet@@ yl@@ glu@@ cur@@ on@@ id of the drug ( 1 % ) , its well @-@ known oxid@@ ative metabol@@ ites and their con@@ jug@@ ates ( 25 % ) and other unknown metabol@@ ites ( 7 % ) . &quot;
&quot; special patient groups ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency After taking multiple doses of 80 mg AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C in patients with mild , moderate or severe kidney failure , the C@@ MA@@ x of Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at did not change in relation to subjects with normal kidney function . &quot;
the mean overall AU@@ C of Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at increased by about the 1.8 @-@ fold of 7.5 μ g ⋅ 10 m@@ L in the group with normal kidney function to 13.@@ 2 μ g / h / ml in the group with severe kidney function .
12 liver function restriction After taking multiple doses of 80 mg AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C in patients with mild ( Chil@@ d@@ - P@@ ugh classification B ) liver function restriction changed the C@@ MA@@ x and AU@@ C of Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at and its metabol@@ ites not significantly compared to subjects with normal liver function .
age There were no significant changes with regard to the AU@@ C of Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at or its metabol@@ ites after taking multiple oral doses of AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C in older patients compared to younger subjects .
&quot; car@@ cin@@ ogen@@ esis , mut@@ agen@@ esis , imp@@ air@@ ment of fertility In males rats , a statisti@@ cally significant increase of ur@@ inary bladder tum@@ ors ( transition cell pap@@ ill@@ omas and car@@ cin@@ omas ) was found only in connection with X@@ an@@ thin stones in the highly dos@@ ed treated group , with approximately the 11 @-@ fold of exposure to humans . &quot;
these findings are seen as a result of a specific Pur@@ in@@ ab@@ oli@@ zation and urine composition and considered not relevant for clinical use .
it was found that Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at in oral doses of up to 48 mg / kg / day has no effect on fertility and reproductive capacity of male and female rats .
&quot; at high doses , which were approximately in the 4,@@ 3 @-@ fold of the human@@ ist exposure , mat@@ ernal toxic@@ ity occurred , which accompanied by lowering the increase performance and a develop@@ mental delay in the descendants of rats . &quot;
&quot; ter@@ at@@ ological studies in supporting rats with ex@@ positions , which are about 4,@@ 3 times and in carrying rab@@ bits with ex@@ positions , which c@@ row approximately 13 times of the human therapeutic exposure , do not have ter@@ ato@@ genic effects . &quot;

AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is used to treat oste@@ opor@@ osis ( a disease where the bones are incub@@ ated ) in women after men@@ op@@ ause where there is a risk of a low vitamin D mirror .
&quot; the patient must take the tablet with a full glass of water ( no mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before eating , drinking or taking other medicines ( including An@@ ta@@ zi@@ da , calcium and vitamin supplements ) . &quot;
&quot; in order to avoid irrit@@ ation of the o@@ es@@ oph@@ ag@@ us , the patient may not lie down until after the first food intake of the day , which should take place at the earliest 30 minutes after taking the tablet . &quot;
&quot; since Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at and vitamin D3 are already used separately in pharmaceuticals that are approved in the European Union , the company presented data from earlier studies and published literature . &quot;
the company also conducted a study involving 35 men and 68@@ 2 post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women with oste@@ opor@@ osis to prove the efficacy of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE in terms of increasing the vitamin D mirror .
&quot; after a 15 @-@ week treatment , the proportion of patients with a low vitamin D mirror in patients treated with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE was lower ( 11 % ) than those who received only alpha @-@ dr@@ on@@ ate ( 32 % ) . &quot;
the company also presented data to indicate that the Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at dose contained in AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is exactly the dose needed to prevent bone loss .
&quot; the most common side effects ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are head@@ aches , pain of the mus@@ cul@@ os@@ kel@@ etal system ( muscles , bones or joints ) and symptoms of the diges@@ tive system such as abdominal pain , dy@@ sp@@ ep@@ sy ( di@@ arr@@ ho@@ ea ) , ul@@ c@@ ers ( ul@@ cer@@ a ) , er@@ ron@@ eous abdom@@ en ( blo@@ ated abdom@@ en ) , as well as suction no@@ ises . &quot;
&quot; in patients with any hyper@@ sensitivity ( allergy ) against al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate , vitamin D3 or any of the other components AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE cannot be applied . &quot;
&quot; it must not be applied in case of diseases of the es@@ oph@@ ag@@ us , in patients with hypo@@ cal@@ c@@ emia ( low calcium levels ) or in patients who cannot stand or sit for at least 30 minutes . &quot;

&quot; capsule shaped , white until broken white tablets , marked with the outline of a bone on one side and &quot; 710 &quot; on the other side . &quot;
&quot; AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is available only with water ( not with mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before the first meal , drink or intake of medicines ( including an@@ ta@@ zi@@ da , calcium and vitamin supplements ) for the day . &quot;
follow these instructions carefully to reduce the risk of mal@@ ign@@ ant irrit@@ ation and associated side effects ( see section 4.4 ) :
&quot; • AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is supposed to be swal@@ lowed only with a full glass of water ( at least 200 ml ) after the day , since there is a risk for or@@ op@@ har@@ yn@@ ge@@ al Ul@@ zer@@ a . &quot;
&quot; B. pep@@ tic ul@@ cer , active g@@ astro@@ intestinal hem@@ or@@ rh@@ ages or surgical procedures in the upper Gast@@ ro@@ intestinal tract ( see section 4.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; es@@ es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al reactions , such as es@@ oph@@ agi@@ tis , mal@@ ign@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al ul@@ cer@@ a and mal@@ ign@@ ant ero@@ sions , rarely followed by mal@@ ign@@ ant ha@@ ge@@ al frac@@ tures , were reported in patients under the intake of Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at ( partially these were severe and required a hospital assignment ) . &quot;
&quot; the doctor should therefore point attention to all signs and symptoms that point to possible mal@@ ign@@ ant reactions , and patients should be pointed out when the symptoms of mal@@ ign@@ ant irrit@@ ation such as dy@@ sph@@ ag@@ ia , pain when swal@@ lowing or retro@@ stern@@ al pain or new or wor@@ sen@@ ing heart@@ burn the medicine seek medical advice ( see section 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; 3 The risk of serious mal@@ ign@@ ant side effects seems to be increased in patients , which do not take the medicine correctly and / or after the occurrence of symptoms that point to a mal@@ ign@@ ant irrit@@ ation . &quot;
it is very important that all dosing instructions are passed on to the patient and be understood by the patient ( see section 4.2 ) .
&quot; during large @-@ scale clinical trials with al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate no increased risk was detected , rare ( after market introduction ) stomach and du@@ oden@@ al ul@@ cer@@ a , among them some severe and with complications , reported ( see section 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; oste@@ opor@@ osis of the jaw , usually associated with a tooth extraction and / or a local infection ( including oste@@ omyel@@ itis ) , was reported in cancer patients whose therapy g@@ ime primarily contains intra@@ ven@@ ously administered bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates . &quot;
&quot; there are no data available to give notice , whether using a bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate therapy in patients requiring a lower surgical procedure , reduces the risk of oste@@ opor@@ osis of the jaw . &quot;
clinical evaluation by the attending physician is author@@ it@@ ative for treatment planning in each patient based on an individual benefit risk assessment .
patients should be advised that they should take the tablet next morning when taking a dose AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE after they have noticed their failure .
&quot; you should not take two tablets on the same day , but take the intake of one tablet per week as originally planned at the scheduled day of the week . &quot;
other diseases affecting mineral metabolism ( such as vitamin D deficiency and hyp@@ op@@ ar@@ athy ) should also be treated adequ@@ ately before the therapy with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE .
&quot; algae dr@@ on@@ ate foods and beverages ( including mineral water ) , calcium supplements , An@@ ta@@ zi@@ da and some oral medicines can imp@@ air the absorption of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate if they are taken at the same time . &quot;
&quot; therefore , patients must wait at least 30 minutes after taking Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at before taking other medicines ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 5.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; although specific interaction studies were not carried out , Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate was taken together with a variety of commonly prescribed medicines without clin@@ ically relevant interactions . &quot;
AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is intended only for the application of post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women and is therefore neither applicable during pregnancy or by breast @-@ feeding women .
&quot; animal studies with al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate leave no indication of directly dam@@ aging effects with regard to pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al or post@@ nat@@ al development . &quot;
&quot; oste@@ opor@@ osis of the jaw was reported in patients suffering from bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates ; most reports were reported by cancer patients , but it was also reported in oste@@ opor@@ os@@ ep@@ ati@@ ents . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , up to &lt; 8,0 mg / dl ( 2.0 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and the ser@@ um @-@ phosph@@ ats up to ≤ 2,0 mg / dl ( 0.@@ 65 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) in both treatment groups with similar frequency occurred . &quot;
&quot; al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at following an oral over@@ dose can occur Hy@@ po@@ cal@@ c@@ emia , hyp@@ oph@@ osph@@ at@@ emia and side effects in the upper Gast@@ ro@@ intestinal tract such as stomach up@@ set , heart@@ burn , Ö@@ soph@@ agi@@ tis , Gast@@ ri@@ tis or Ul@@ zer@@ a . &quot;

the effects of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate on bone mass and frac@@ tures in post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women were examined in two phase III studies of identical design ( n = 9@@ 44 ) and in the frac@@ ture intervention study ( F@@ IT : N = 6.@@ 459 ) .
&quot; in phase III studies , the average asc@@ ents of the BM@@ D with Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at 10 mg / day compared to plac@@ ebo after 3 years 8.@@ 8 % on the spine , 5.9 % on the fem@@ ur neck and 7.@@ 8 % on the tro@@ chan@@ ter . &quot;

&quot; in the two @-@ year extension of these studies , the asc@@ ents of the BM@@ D of spine and tro@@ chan@@ ter continued to continue ; also the BM@@ D of the fem@@ ur and the entire body was maintained . &quot;
&quot; fit consisted of two plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled studies , with which Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate daily ( 5 mg daily for 2 years and then 10 mg daily continues either over 1 or 2 years ) : &quot;
&quot; in this study , the daily administration of Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at reduced the occurrence of at least a new vert@@ ebral frac@@ ture by 47 % ( Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at 7.9 % compared to Pla@@ z@@ ebo 15.@@ 0 % ) . &quot;
the mean oral bio@@ availability of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate in women 0.@@ 64 % for doses between 5 and 70 mg after nigh@@ tly fasting and two hours before taking a standardized breakfast .

&quot; in oste@@ opor@@ os@@ stages , Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate was effective if it was taken at least 30 minutes before the first meal or drinking of the day . &quot;
&quot; in healthy volunteers , the administration of oral pre@@ d@@ nis@@ one ( 20 mg three times daily over five days ) led to no clin@@ ically significant change in oral bio@@ availability of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate ( increase in the range from 20 % to 44 % ) . &quot;

&quot; ex@@ cre@@ tion In case of radio@@ active lab@@ elled vitamin D3 in healthy subjects , the mean ex@@ cre@@ tion of radio@@ activity in the urine after 48 hours was 2.4 % , in the subject after 4 days 4.9 % . &quot;
&quot; characteristics in patients pre@@ clinical studies have shown that the proportion of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate , which is not depos@@ ited in bones , is quickly ex@@ cre@@ ted over urine . &quot;
&quot; although there are no clinical data about it , however , it is likely to reck@@ on that the ren@@ al elimination of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate as in the animal tests will also be reduced in patients with reduced kidney function . &quot;

adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f is administered to adult patients who have been transplan@@ ted kidney or liver to prevent rejection of transplan@@ ted organ by the immune system .
&quot; since Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus and Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft are already used in the EU , the company has presented the results from previously conducted studies with Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft as well as data from published literature . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , the results of a clinical study were presented to 6@@ 68 patients with kidney transplan@@ t , whereby the application of Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f was compared with Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft or C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in . &quot;
the main indicator of the efficacy was the number of patients in which the transplan@@ t was exp@@ elled after a treatment duration of one year ( for example examined how often a renewed organ transplan@@ t or res@@ ump@@ tion of di@@ aly@@ sis was required ) .
&quot; in addition , more recent studies were conducted on 119 patients with kidney transplan@@ tation and 129 patients with liver transplan@@ tation and examined how adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f is absorbed by the body compared to Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft . &quot;

&quot; in patients with any hyper@@ sensitivity ( allergy ) against tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , macro@@ li@@ de antibiotics ( such as er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin ) or any other component , advoc@@ ate ra@@ f may not be applied . &quot;
patients and doctors must be careful if other ( especially some herbal ) medicines should be taken at the same time with adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f as the adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f dose or the dose of the simultaneously taken medication must be adjusted accordingly .

only doctors who are familiar with immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy and treatment of transplan@@ t patients should prescri@@ be this medicine or make changes in immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy .
&quot; due to clin@@ ically relevant differences in system@@ ic exposure of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , this can lead to transplan@@ t rep@@ ul@@ sions or to an increased incidence of side effects , including under@@ - or immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression . &quot;
patients should always maintain the same tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus formulation and the corresponding daily dosage ; alter@@ ations of the formulation or regime should only be carried out under the close mes@@ hing control of a physician experienced in the transplan@@ t ( see sections 4.4 and 4.8 ) .
&quot; as a result of a transition to an alternative formulation , therapeutic pharmaceutical monitoring and appropriate dose adjustments must be carried out to ensure that the system@@ ic exposure of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus remains intact . &quot;
the dosage of adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f should be based primarily on the clinical evaluation of rep@@ ul@@ sion and toler@@ ability in individual cases and on blood @-@ mirror regulations ( see below )
&quot; after conversion from Pro@@ gra@@ f to Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f , the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus Tal@@ ks should be controlled before the conversion and over two weeks after conversion . &quot;
&quot; on Day 4 , system@@ ic exposure , measured as a valley mirror , was comparable with both form@@ ulations both in ni@@ er@@ - and liver transplan@@ ted patients . &quot;
careful and repeated checks of the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus Tal@@ ks are recommended during the first two weeks following transplan@@ tation in adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f to ensure appropriate substance exposure in the immediate post @-@ transplan@@ tation phase .
&quot; since Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus is a substance with low Clear@@ ance , an adaptation of the adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f can take several days before the steady state is reached . &quot;
&quot; if the condition of the patient in the first post@@ operative phase does not allow oral consumption of medicines , the tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus treatment can be introduced intra@@ ven@@ ously ( Pro@@ gra@@ f 5 mg / ml concentrate for the production of an in@@ fusion fluid ) with a dose of ca . &quot;
&quot; duration of application For the supp@@ ression of the transplan@@ t rep@@ ul@@ sion , immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression must be maintained ; consequently , a maximum duration of oral treatment cannot be specified . &quot;
dosage recommendations - kidney transplan@@ tation proph@@ yla@@ xis of transplan@@ t rep@@ ul@@ sion The oral adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f therapy should begin with 0.@@ 20 - 0.@@ 30 mg / kg / day as once daily gift in the morning .
further dose adjustments may be necessary later as the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can change during the course of stabili@@ zation of the patient after transplan@@ tation .
dosage recommendations - liver transplan@@ tation proph@@ yla@@ xis of transplan@@ t rep@@ ul@@ sion The oral adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f therapy should begin with 0.@@ 10 - 0.@@ 20 mg / kg / day as once daily gift in the morning .
dosage recommendation - conversion from Pro@@ gra@@ f to Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f must undergo a transplan@@ t receiver of twice daily dosage of Pro@@ gra@@ f capsules to one once daily intake of Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f to take place in relation to 1 : 1 ( mg : mg ) to the whole daily dose .
kidney and liver transplan@@ tation after a conversion from other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ si@@ va to Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f once daily must begin treatment with the oral initi@@ al@@ do@@ sis recommended for the proph@@ yla@@ xis of transplan@@ tation .
cardi@@ ac Tran@@ splan@@ tation For adult patients who are converted to Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f is an oral initi@@ al@@ do@@ sis of 0.@@ 15 mg / kg / day at once daily .
&quot; other transplan@@ t recipients , although there are no clinical experience with adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f in lung , pancre@@ atic and intest@@ ine transplan@@ ts , came in an oral initi@@ al@@ dose of 0.@@ 10 - 0,15 mg / kg / day , in an oral initi@@ al@@ dose of 0.3 mg / kg / day and in an oral initi@@ al@@ do@@ sis of 0.3 mg / kg / day . &quot;
dosage adjustment in special patient groups patients with reduced liver function to maintain blood levels in the targeted area can be required in patients with severe liver function disorders a reduction of the dose .
patients with reduced kidney function Da the kidney function exer@@ ts no influence on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can be assumed that a dose adaptation is not required .
&quot; due to the ne@@ phr@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic potential of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , however , careful monitoring of the kidney function ( including a regular determination of the ser@@ um canc@@ at@@ in@@ insp@@ iegel , a calculation of the cre@@ at@@ in@@ inc@@ ur@@ ance and a monitoring of the ur@@ inary volume ) is recommended . &quot;
conversion from C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in to Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f In the conversion of a C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in to a Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus based therapy caution is advised ( see sections 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
recommendations on the level of seb@@ um in the whole blood The dose should be primarily based on the clinical evaluation of rep@@ ul@@ sion and toler@@ ability in individual cases under the help of thorough@@ bred Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus tal@@ level controls .
&quot; it is recommended to perform frequent checks of the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus test mirror during the first two weeks following transplan@@ tation , followed by peri@@ odic checks during maintenance therapy . &quot;
&quot; blood @-@ tal@@ low of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus should also be controlled after conversion from Pro@@ gra@@ f to Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f , dose adaptation , changes of immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy or while applying substances , which could change the tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus whole blood concentration ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; since adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f is a drug with a low clearance , adap@@ tations of the dose may require several days until the steady state has occurred . &quot;
&quot; the data in clinical trials suggest that successful treatment is possible in most cases , if the level of the level in the blood is 20 ng / ml . &quot;
&quot; in clinical practice , the heart mirror of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus in the first time after liver transplan@@ ts usually lie in the range of 5 - 20 ng / ml and random@@ ised and heart transplan@@ ted patients at 10 - 20 ng / ml . &quot;
&quot; during the following maintenance therapy of liver , kidney and cardi@@ ac transplan@@ ts , blood concentrations were usually used in the range of 5 - 15 ng / ml . &quot;
&quot; this has resulted in serious adverse events , including transplan@@ t rep@@ ul@@ sions or other side effects caused by tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus under@@ - or over@@ exposure . &quot;
patients should always maintain the same tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus formulation and the corresponding daily dosage ; alter@@ ations of the formulation or regime should only be carried out under the tight control of a physician experienced in the transplan@@ t ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 4.8 ) .
&quot; 5 For the treatment of adult patients with transplan@@ t rep@@ ul@@ sion , which proved to be effective against other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ s@@ ants , there are still no clinical data for the re@@ tar@@ ded formulation adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f . &quot;
&quot; for the proph@@ yla@@ xis of transplan@@ t rep@@ ul@@ sion in adult heart transplan@@ ts and transplan@@ t recipients in childhood , there are still no clinical data for the re@@ tar@@ ded formulation adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f . &quot;
&quot; because of possible interactions , which can lead to a reduction of the tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus mirror in the blood and a weak@@ ening of the clinical effect of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , the intake of herbal supplements , the cur@@ rant ( hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) , or other herbal remedies can be avoided during treatment with adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients with di@@ arr@@ ho@@ ea , a particularly careful monitoring of the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus concentrations in the blood is offered , as the tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus blood levels may be subject to considerable fluctu@@ ations in such circumstances . &quot;
&quot; in rare cases under Pro@@ gra@@ f , a chamber or sep@@ tum hyper@@ tro@@ phy was observed under Pro@@ gra@@ f which can therefore occur under Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f . &quot;
&quot; other factors that increase the risk of such clinical disorders are an already existing heart disease , a treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ o@@ ids , hyper@@ tension , kidney or liver function disorders , infections , fluid over@@ load and oil . &quot;
&quot; as with other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ si@@ va , the exposure of sunlight or UV light should be restricted due to possible risk mal@@ ign@@ ant skin changes due to appropriate clothing or use of a sun protection by means of a high protection factor . &quot;
&quot; if patients who are taking Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , symptoms for PRE@@ S such as head@@ aches , changing levels of consciousness , conv@@ ul@@ sions and visual distur@@ bances , should show a radi@@ ological examination ( e.g. &quot;
&quot; since adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f hard capsules , re@@ tar@@ ded , l@@ act@@ ose contain , is necessary in patients with the rare her@@ edit@@ ary Gal@@ act@@ ose intoler@@ ance , l@@ act@@ ase deficiency or glucose @-@ gal@@ act@@ ose @-@ mal@@ absorption . &quot;
&quot; simultaneous application of medicines or herbal remedies known as inhibit@@ ors or induc@@ tors of C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 can influence the metabolism of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , and thus increase or decrease blood levels of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus . &quot;
&quot; it is therefore advisable to monitor the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus blood mirror with simultaneous use of substances that can change the C@@ YP@@ 3A metabolism , and to adjust the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus dose for maintaining uniform concentrations ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; a strongly distinctive interaction was associated with anti @-@ tim@@ y@@ cot@@ ics such as k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole , flu@@ con@@ az@@ ole , it@@ rac@@ on@@ az@@ ole and vor@@ icon@@ az@@ ole as well as with the Macro@@ eyel@@ id @-@ Anti@@ biotic Er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin and HIV prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors ( z . &quot;
&quot; pharmaceutical studies have resulted in the increase in blood levels mainly from the increased oral bio@@ availability of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , caused by inhibit@@ ing the g@@ astro@@ intestinal metabolism . &quot;
&quot; high dos@@ ed pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ one or meth@@ yl pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ on , as is used for acute rejection reactions , can increase or decrease the concentration of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus in the blood . &quot;
the effect of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus on the metabolism of other drugs Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus is known as C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ or ; therefore the simultaneous application of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus with medicines that are met@@ ab@@ oli@@ zed by C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 can imp@@ air their metabolism .
&quot; as Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can reduce the Clear@@ ance of ster@@ oid contrac@@ ep@@ tiv@@ a , and thus increase the hormone exposure , it is particularly careful when making decisions about recep@@ tive measures . &quot;
the results of animal experiments have shown that Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can potentially reduce the clearance of pent@@ ob@@ arb@@ ital and phen@@ az@@ one and extend its half @-@ value .
the results of a small number of transplan@@ t patients have no indication that under Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus compared to other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ si@@ va there is an increased risk of adverse events related to the course and the outcome of pregnancy .
&quot; in uter@@ o exposure , there is an observation of the new@@ born to any harmful effects of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus ( especially with regard to its effect on the kid@@ neys ) . &quot;
&quot; there is the risk of premature birth ( &lt; week 37 ) and a hyper@@ k@@ ali@@ a@@ emia of the new@@ born ( incidence 8 of 111 new@@ born , i.e. : &quot;
the side effect profile of immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ si@@ va is often difficult to determine because of the underlying disease of the patient and the simultaneous treatment with a variety of other medicines .
&quot; the side effects after their frequency in descending order are frequently performed ( ≥ 1 / 100 , ≤ 1 / 10 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , ≤ 1 / 100 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , ≤ 1 / 100 ) , very rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , ≤ 1 / 100 ) , very rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , ≤ 1 / 100 ) , very rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , ≤ 1 / 100 ) , very rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , ≤ 1 / 100 ) , very rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , ≤ 1 / 100 ) , very rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , ≤ 1 / 100 ) , very rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , ≤ 1 / 100 ) , very rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , ≤ 1 / 100 ) , very rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , ≤ 1 / 100 ) , very rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , ≤ 1 / 100 ) , very rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , ≤ 1 / 100 ) , very rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , ≤ 1 / 100 ) , very rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , ≤ 1 / 100 ) , very rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , ≤ 1 / 100 ) , very rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , ≤ 1 / 100 ) , very rare (

cases of BK @-@ Virus @-@ associated ne@@ ph@@ rop@@ athy and J@@ C virus associated progressive multi@@ focal leu@@ ko@@ encephal@@ opathy ( P@@ ML ) were reported in patients with immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy including therapy with Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f .
it has been reported about ben@@ ign or mal@@ ign@@ ant Ne@@ oplas@@ ms including EB@@ V@@ - associated lymp@@ ho@@ prolifer@@ ative diseases and skin tum@@ ors associated with the treatment with Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus .
&quot; due to its high molecular weight , its low water solu@@ bility and the high binding of er@@ y@@ thro@@ cy@@ tes and plasma proteins , Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus is not di@@ aly@@ zer . &quot;
&quot; action mechanism and pharmac@@ o@@ dynamic effects On the molecular level , the effects of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus should be medi@@ ated by its binding to a cy@@ tos@@ ol@@ ean protein ( F@@ KB@@ P@@ 12 ) that is responsible for the enrich@@ ment of the connection in the cell@@ ulose . &quot;
this leads to a cal@@ ci@@ um@@ dependent in@@ hibition of signal trans@@ duction procedures in the T cell and thus prevents the tran@@ scription of a certain range of lymph@@ oma genes .

&quot; overall , the safety profile of oral Pro@@ gra@@ f in these published studies correspon@@ ded to the observations in the major studies where Pro@@ gra@@ f was used for liver , kidney and heart transplan@@ t to primary immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression . &quot;
&quot; lung transplan@@ tation in an interim analysis via a recently conducted , multi @-@ centric study with oral Pro@@ gra@@ f received over 110 patients who received either Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus or C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in as part of a 1 : 1 random@@ ization . &quot;
&quot; chronic transplan@@ t rep@@ ul@@ sion , the bron@@ chi@@ oli@@ tis obl@@ iter@@ ate syndrome , was less frequently observed in the first year after transplan@@ tation ( 2.@@ 86 % versus 8.@@ 57 % ) . &quot;
&quot; survival rate after one year was 8@@ 0.8 % in the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus and 83 % in the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in group ( Tre@@ ede et al . , 3rd IC@@ I San Diego , USA , 2004 ; Abstract 22 ) . &quot;

&quot; the number of cases where C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in had to be converted to Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus ( n = 13 ) , was significantly bigger ( p = 0.0@@ 2 ) ( Ke@@ en@@ an et al . , Ann Thor@@ ac@@ ic Sur@@ g 1995 ; 60 : 580 ) . &quot;
&quot; the number of cases in which no acute gra@@ ft rejection occurred after 6 months ( 5@@ 7,@@ 7 % versus 45.@@ 8 % ) and after 1 year ( 50 % versus 33.@@ 3 % ) in the transplan@@ ted patients of the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus group ( Tre@@ ede et al . , J Heart L@@ ung Tran@@ splan@@ t 2001 ; 20 : 511 ) . &quot;
&quot; in a study , the incidence of a bron@@ chi@@ oli@@ tis obl@@ iter@@ ated syndrome was significantly lower in patients treated with tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus . &quot;
a multic@@ ent@@ ric study conducted with oral Pro@@ gra@@ f under@@ went 205 patients who were at the same time undergo a pancre@@ atic and kidney transplan@@ tation that were random@@ ised after a random@@ ised procedure Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus ( n = 103 ) or C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( n = 102 ) .
the oral initi@@ al@@ do@@ sis ( per protocol ) of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus was 0.2 mg / kg / day and was subsequently reached the target level of 8 to 15 ng / ml on 5 .
&quot; the published clinical results of a mono@@ centric study with oral pro@@ gra@@ f as the primary immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ s@@ ant after intestinal transplan@@ tations showed a current survival rate of 75 % after 1 year , 5 % after 5 years and 42 % after 10 years . &quot;

factors such as low hem@@ at@@ oc@@ rit@@ es and low protein concentrations which lead to an increase in the un@@ bound group of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus or a strengthening of metabolism of cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ o@@ ids should be responsible for the higher Clear@@ ance rates observed after transplan@@ tation .
&quot; this can be concluded that Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus is almost completely met@@ ab@@ oli@@ zed before ex@@ cre@@ tion , whereby ex@@ cre@@ tion is carried out mainly via the bile . &quot;
&quot; in case of stable patients suffering from Pro@@ gra@@ f ( twice daily ) to Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f ( once daily ) in relation 1 : 1 ( mg : mg ) , the system@@ ic exposure of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus ( AU@@ C@@ 0 @-@ 24 ) was approximately 10 % lower than under Pro@@ gra@@ f . &quot;
&quot; it is recommended to perform frequent checks of the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus test mirror during the first two weeks following transplan@@ tation , followed by peri@@ odic checks during maintenance therapy . &quot;

advoc@@ ate is used to treat and prevent ble@@ eding in patients with ha@@ em@@ op@@ hili@@ a A ( a blood cl@@ ot@@ ting disorder caused by the lack of factor VIII ) .
the dosage and frequency of the application are directed to whether Adv@@ ances are used to treat hem@@ or@@ rh@@ ages or to prevent ble@@ eding in surgical procedures .
&quot; patients with hem@@ op@@ hili@@ a A suffer from a factor VIII deficiency , causing blood cl@@ ot@@ ting problems such as ble@@ eding in joints , muscles or inner organs . &quot;
&quot; oc@@ to@@ co@@ g al@@ fa is not extracted from human plasma , but produced according to a method called &quot; re@@ combin@@ ant DNA technology &quot; : &quot;
&quot; it is produced by a cell , into which a gene ( DNA ) was introduced , which is capable of forming the human co@@ ag@@ ulation factor VIII . &quot;
&quot; advoc@@ ate is similar to another medicine approved in the European Union called Rec@@ om@@ bin@@ ate , but is otherwise produced so that the medicine does not contain proteins or animal origin . &quot;
&quot; in three additional studies in patients with severe to moderate ha@@ em@@ op@@ hili@@ a A , including a study with 53 children under six years , the application of the drug was examined for prevention of ble@@ eding and surgical procedures . &quot;
&quot; in the main study , the efficacy of advances in the prevention of ble@@ eding in 86 % of 510 new anti@@ sep@@ tic periods with &quot; &quot; excellent &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; good &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of Adv@@ ance ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are di@@ zz@@ iness , head@@ aches , py@@ re@@ x@@ ie ( fever ) and the formation of antibodies against factor VIII . &quot;
&quot; advoc@@ ate may not be applied to patients who are possibly hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic to the human scent factor VIII , mouse or ham@@ ster protein or any of the other ingredients . &quot;
&quot; in March 2004 , the European Commission issued a permit for the company B@@ ax@@ ter AG to promote advoc@@ acy in the whole European Union . &quot;
dosage The dosage and duration of sub@@ stitution therapy depend on the sever@@ ity of the factor VIII @-@ defici@@ encies depending on the location and the extent of the blood and the patient &apos;s clinical condition .
&quot; in the following hem@@ or@@ rh@@ ag@@ ic events , the factor VIII @-@ activity should not fall under the specified plasma levels ( in % of the norm or in I.@@ E. / dl ) . &quot;
injection every 12 @-@ 24 hours ( 8 @-@ 24 hours in patients under 6 years ) for 3 @-@ 4 days or longer repe@@ ating until the pain and acute imp@@ air@@ ment are removed .
repeat all 8 @-@ 24 hours ( 6 @-@ 12 hours in patients under 6 years ) repeat until the risk of the patient is over .
&quot; during the treatment course , an appropriate determination of the factor VIII @-@ plas@@ m@@ ble should be recommended for controlling the dose and frequency of inj@@ ections . &quot;
individual patients can differ in their response to factor VIII different in vi@@ vo recovery and have different half @-@ time periods .
3 proph@@ yla@@ xis On long @-@ term proph@@ yla@@ xis of hem@@ or@@ rh@@ ages in patients with severe hem@@ op@@ hili@@ a A should be given doses between 20 and 40 I.@@ E. by factor VIII per kg body weight within 2 @-@ 3 days .
&quot; if the expected factor VIII @-@ plasma activity is not reached or if the amount of blood is not controlled with an appropriate dose , a test must be carried out to detect an inhibit@@ or if necessary . &quot;
&quot; in patients with high intra@@ ocular values , it is possible that the factor VIII @-@ therapy is not effective , so that other therapeutic measures need to be weigh@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; the rate of administration should be directed according to the condition of the patient , whereby a maximum injection rate of 10 ml / min should not be exceeded . &quot;
the formation of neutr@@ alizing antibodies ( inhibit@@ ors ) against factor VIII is a well @-@ known complic@@ ation in the treatment of patients with ha@@ em@@ op@@ hili@@ a A .
these inhibit@@ ors are always opposed to the pro@@ ko@@ ag@@ ul@@ atory activity of factor VIII . Ig@@ G immun@@ og@@ lob@@ ul@@ ins which are quanti@@ fied in Be@@ thes@@ da units ( B.@@ E. ) per ml plasma using modified Be@@ thes@@ da ass@@ ay .
&quot; the risk of developing inhibit@@ ors cor@@ relates to the extent of exposure to the factor VIII , whereby the risk within the first 20 exposure days is the greatest and depends on genetic and other factors . &quot;
&quot; in untreated patients ( PT@@ Ps ) with more than 100 ex@@ positions and an@@ am@@ nes@@ tically well @-@ known inhibit@@ or development , after switching from a re@@ combin@@ ant factor VIII product to another , the recur@@ rence of ( lowest ) inhibit@@ ors observed . &quot;
&quot; due to the rare occurrence of ha@@ em@@ op@@ hili@@ a A in women , there are no experiences on the application of factor VIII during pregnancy and lac@@ tation . &quot;
&quot; patients appearing in the largest number of patients were inhibit@@ ors against factor VIII ( 5 patients ) , which showed a higher risk to the formation of inhibit@@ ors , head@@ aches ( 5 patients ) , fever and di@@ zz@@ iness ( 3 patients each ) . &quot;
&quot; very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , often ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 to &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 to &lt; 1 / 100 ) , very rare &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) , not known ( frequency on basis of available data not estimated ) . &quot;
a ) The percentage of patients was calculated based on the sum of the individual patients ( 234 ) . the unexpected drop of the blood co@@ ag@@ ulation factor VIII @-@ Spi@@ eg@@ els occurred post@@ oper@@ atively ( 10 - 14 post@@ operative day ) in a patient under continuous A@@ DV@@ ATE In@@ fusion .
the blood cl@@ ot@@ ting was maintained throughout the period and both the factor VI@@ II@@ - mirror in the plasma as well as the Clear@@ ance rate showed sufficient values again on the 15th of post@@ operative day .
in clinical trials with A@@ DV@@ ATE to 145 children and adults 2 with diagnostic he@@ avier to moderate ha@@ em@@ op@@ hili@@ a A ( F@@ VIII ≤ 2 % ) and previous exposure to factor VI@@ II@@ - concentr@@ ates ( ≥ 150 days ) only one patient showed a low inhibit@@ or ( 2.4 B.@@ E. in the modified Be@@ thes@@ da approach ) .
&quot; in addition , none of the 53 pa@@ edi@@ atric patients with an age of less than 6 years and diagnosed with severe to moderate ha@@ em@@ op@@ hili@@ a A ( F@@ VIII ≤ 2 % ) were observed after previous exposure to factor VI@@ II@@ - concentr@@ ates ( ≥ 50 days ) a F@@ VIII inhibit@@ or . &quot;
&quot; in previously untreated patients of an ongoing clinical trial , 5 out of 25 ( 20 % ) with A@@ DV@@ ATE treated patients inhibit@@ ors against factor VIII . &quot;
&quot; the patient &apos;s immune response to traces of contaminated proteins was analyzed by examining the antibody ti@@ ters against these proteins , laboratory parameters and reported side effects . &quot;
&quot; a patient showed both a statisti@@ cally significant upward trend as well as a persistent peak of antibody levels against anti @-@ CH@@ O cell proteins , otherwise there were no signs or symptoms indicating an allergic reaction or hyper@@ sensitivity . &quot;
&quot; four patients were reported about the occurrence of Ur@@ tik@@ aria , Pr@@ ur@@ itus , r@@ ash and increased number of e@@ os@@ in@@ oph@@ ile gran@@ u@@ lo@@ sis in several repeated product tex@@ tual positions within the study . &quot;

&quot; based on the data available since the initial approval , CH@@ MP has continued to consider the benefit of risk @-@ weighing as positive , but considering that the safety profile must be closely monitored for the following reasons : &quot;
&quot; therefore , CH@@ MP on the basis of the safety profile of A@@ DV@@ ATE , which necess@@ it@@ ates a submission of PS@@ UR@@ s every 6 months , decided that the approval holder should apply for another renewal procedure in 5 years . &quot;
December 2008 Gen@@ du@@ x Molecular Limited announced the Committee on Medic@@ inal Products for Medic@@ inal Products for Medic@@ inal Drugs ( CH@@ MP ) that the company res@@ umes its application for the treatment of re@@ incar@@ nations for the treatment of Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer .
&quot; normally , however , the breast , the brain , the bones or the tissues ( tissues that un@@ ites other structures in the body , surro@@ unds and supports ) are affected . &quot;
this is a kind of virus that has been gene@@ tically modified to carry a gene into the cells of the body .
&quot; the virus in Adv@@ ex@@ in is a &quot; &quot; A@@ den@@ o@@ virus &quot; , &quot; which has been modified in such a way that there are no copies of itself and therefore no infection can be solved with humans . &quot;
Adv@@ ex@@ in would have been inj@@ ected directly into the tum@@ ors and thus enable the cancer cells to form the normal p@@ 53 protein again .
&quot; the p@@ 53 protein , which is formed from the p@@ 53 gene that is not defective in the human body , usually contributes to the recovery of damaged DNA and to kill cells when DNA can not be recovered . &quot;
&quot; with Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer , with which the p@@ 53 @-@ gene is defective , the p@@ 53 protein does not work properly , and the cancer cells can continue to grow and share . &quot;
&quot; the company presented data from a study involving a patient , with the Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer in the field of under@@ mining , bones and brain . &quot;
&quot; after the CH@@ MP had checked the answers of the company on the questions asked , there were still some questions un@@ answered . &quot;
&quot; based on the examination of the initial documents submitted , the CH@@ MP will generate a list of questions sent to the company . &quot;
the CH@@ MP view was not sufficiently demonstrated that the injection of Adv@@ ex@@ in in Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i @-@ Tum@@ ore has benefits for patients .
&quot; the committee also had concerns about the treatment of the drug in the body , the type of administration and the safety of the drug . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the company did not sufficiently prove that Adv@@ ex@@ in can be manufactured in a reliable way and that it is neither for the environment nor for people who come in close contact with the patient . &quot;
the company did not notice the CH@@ MP whether the recall has consequences for patients who are currently participating in clinical trials or &quot; Com@@ passionate @-@ Use &quot; programs with Adv@@ ex@@ in .
&quot; changed active substance release &quot; means that the tablets are so composite , that one of the effective components is released instantly and the other slowly over a few hours . &quot;
&quot; aer@@ ina@@ ze is used to treat the symptoms of seasonal allergic r@@ hin@@ itis ( h@@ ay fever , caused by an allergy to p@@ ollen caused by inflammation of the nas@@ al path@@ ways ) in patients with nas@@ al swelling ( c@@ logged nose ) . &quot;
&quot; in adults and adol@@ escents aged 12 and older , the recommended dose of aer@@ ina@@ ze is twice daily a tablet that should be taken with a glass of water with or without food . &quot;
&quot; the duration of the treatment should be as short as possible and terminated as soon as the symptoms , especially swelling of the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a ( c@@ logged nose ) , are abbrevi@@ ated . &quot;
a treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended because the effects of the drug can be trac@@ ed to the con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose .
the main efficacy measures were the changes in the sever@@ ity of the h@@ ay fever symptoms reported by the patients prior to the beginning of treatment and during the 15 @-@ day treatment .
&quot; during the study , patients wore their symptoms every 12 hours in a diary and evaluated with a standard scale , how difficult the symptoms were in the last 12 hours . &quot;
&quot; when considering all h@@ ay fever symptoms in addition to con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose , patients who took the aer@@ op@@ last@@ y reported a decrease in the symptoms of 46.@@ 0 % , compared to 35.@@ 9 % in patients receiving pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine alone . &quot;
&quot; if only the swelling of the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a was observed , patients under Aer@@ op@@ ze showed a decrease in the symptoms by 37.@@ 4 % compared to 26.@@ 7 % in patients receiving the Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin alone . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of aero@@ bic ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia ( heart j@@ ars ) , mouth drying , di@@ zz@@ iness , head@@ ache , fatigue , in@@ som@@ nia ( sle@@ e@@ pl@@ ess@@ ness ) , som@@ n@@ ol@@ ence ( drow@@ sin@@ ess ) , sleep disorders and nerv@@ ousness . &quot;
&quot; may not be applied to patients who are possibly hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic to des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine or one of the other ingredients , against adren@@ ergi@@ c agents or Lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine ( another medicine for the treatment of allergi@@ es ) . &quot;
&quot; may also not be used in patients who suffer from an@@ gled glau@@ coma ( hyper@@ tension ) , hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ sis ( hyper@@ tension ) , hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ sis ( hyper@@ tension ) , hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ sis ( hyper@@ tension caused by brain ha@@ em@@ or@@ rh@@ age ) or have a risk of hem@@ or@@ rh@@ ag@@ ic stroke . &quot;
&quot; on 30 July 2007 , the European Commission informed the company SP Europe a permit for the launch of Aer@@ op@@ olis in the entire European Union . &quot;
&quot; the tablet can be taken with a glass of water , but is swal@@ lowed whole ( i.e. without breaking , breaking or ch@@ ew@@ ing ) . &quot;
&quot; due to the lack of data for harm@@ lessness and efficacy ( see Section 5.1 , it should not be used for children under 12 years of age . &quot;
the duration of the application is as short as possible and should not be continued after the symptoms of the symptoms .
&quot; it is recommended to limit the application duration to 10 days , since long @-@ term application can decrease the activity of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine with time . &quot;
&quot; after the swelling of the mu@@ c@@ ous membran@@ es in the upper respiratory tract , treatment can be continued as a mon@@ otherapy if required . &quot;
&quot; da aer@@ ina@@ ze pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine contains , the medicine is also contra@@ indicated in patients treated with a mono@@ amine oxid@@ ase ( MA@@ O ) inhibit@@ ors respectively within the two weeks after finishing such a therapy . &quot;
&quot; this is attri@@ but@@ able to al@@ ph@@ am@@ im@@ etic activity in combined use of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine with other vas@@ o@@ con@@ stric@@ tors such as bro@@ mo@@ cri@@ pi@@ tin , Per@@ go@@ id , Lis@@ ur@@ id , Cab@@ ac@@ olin , Er@@ got@@ amine , D@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ erg@@ ot@@ amine , eph@@ edr@@ ine , Ox@@ y@@ met@@ az@@ olin , Nap@@ haz@@ olin etc . ) . &quot;
the safety and effectiveness of this combination therapy have not been checked for this patient lesson and the data are not sufficient to give appropriate recommendations on dosage .
the safety and efficacy of the aer@@ op@@ olis have not been tested in patients with kidney or liver dysfunction and the data are not sufficient to give appropriate recommendations on dosage .
&quot; patients need to be informed that the treatment in case of hyper@@ tension or t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia or pal@@ pit@@ ations , heart rhythm disorders , nau@@ sea or any other neurolog@@ ical symptoms ( such as head@@ ache or ampli@@ fication of head@@ aches ) must be removed . &quot;
&quot; patients with hyper@@ tension • Patients with hyper@@ tension • Patients with hyper@@ tension • Patients with hyper@@ tension • Patients with a m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction in an@@ am@@ nes@@ ia , diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , bladder neck contrac@@ tion or bron@@ ch@@ os@@ pas@@ m in an@@ am@@ nes@@ ia . &quot;
&quot; Aer@@ op@@ sis is at least 48 hours before performing der@@ mat@@ ological tests , since anti@@ hi@@ stam@@ ines can otherwise reduce positive reactions to indicators for skin reactions and reduce them to their extent . &quot;
&quot; in addition to clinical trials with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin , where er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were additionally administered , no clin@@ ically relevant interactions or alter@@ ations of the plas@@ mac@@ ular concentration of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin were observed . &quot;
&quot; the results of the psych@@ omot@@ or test showed no significant differences between the patients treated with the des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine and the patients treated with plac@@ ebo , regardless of whether it was taken alone or with alcohol . &quot;
&quot; the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine has not yet been identified , so that interactions with other medicines cannot be excluded completely . &quot;
&quot; Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin does not inhi@@ bit in vi@@ vo C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 , and in @-@ vitro studies have shown that the drug C@@ YP@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 is not inhi@@ bited and neither a sub@@ strate nor an inhibit@@ or of the P gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ eins is . &quot;
&quot; the harm@@ lessness of the use of aero@@ bic acid during pregnancy is not secured , experiences gained from a large number of pregnant women , however , no increase in the frequency of ab@@ norm@@ alities compared to frequency with the normal population . &quot;
&quot; since reproductive studies on animals cannot always be transferred to humans , and due to the vas@@ o@@ con@@ stric@@ tor properties of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine , aer@@ ina@@ ze should not be applied in pregnancy . &quot;
&quot; patients should be informed , however , that in very rare cases it may come to a ligh@@ the@@ ade@@ dness that can lead to an imp@@ air@@ ment of the imp@@ air@@ ment or the ability to serve machines . &quot;
&quot; symptoms may vary between a CN@@ S depression ( sed@@ ation , ap@@ nea , decreased mental al@@ ert@@ ness , cy@@ an@@ ose , coma , cardiovascular collapse ) and a CN@@ S stimulation ( sle@@ e@@ pl@@ ess@@ ness , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations , tre@@ mor , conv@@ ul@@ sions ) with possible let@@ tu@@ gs . &quot;

&quot; a CN@@ S stimulation is especially prob@@ able in children , as well as at@@ rop@@ ine @-@ typical symptoms ( mouth @-@ dro@@ ught , pu@@ pill@@ ary ar@@ re and - dil@@ ation , skin red@@ ness , hyper@@ ther@@ mia and g@@ astro@@ intestinal symptoms ) . &quot;
&quot; these include both the in@@ hibition of the release of inflammatory cy@@ tok@@ ines such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human mast cells / bas@@ oph@@ il@@ en as well as the in@@ hibition of the expression of the adhesion molecules P @-@ sel@@ ec@@ tin on end@@ othel@@ ial cells . &quot;
&quot; with an adult dose study with adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine 5 mg showed no influence on standard measuring ranges of the gli@@ der including the rein@@ forcement of subjective drow@@ sin@@ ess or the tasks associated with flying . &quot;
&quot; in controlled clinical studies , the recommended dosage of 5 mg daily was not found to have increased frequency of drow@@ sin@@ ess compared to plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; the oral application of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine in the recommended dosage can cause further sympath@@ om@@ im@@ etic effects , such as an increase in blood pressure , a t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia or manifestation of a CN@@ S arous@@ al . &quot;
&quot; there were 1,@@ 248 patients aged between 12 and 78 years with seasonal allergic r@@ hin@@ itis , where 414 patients received Aer@@ ol@@ ze tablets . &quot;
&quot; in both studies the hi@@ stam@@ ine antagon@@ istic effectiveness of Aer@@ op@@ ze tablets , determined by the total scores for the symptoms ( except nas@@ al membran@@ es ) , was significantly higher than under a mon@@ otherapy with pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine during the 2 @-@ week treatment period . &quot;
&quot; the efficacy of aero@@ bic tablets with regard to the swelling effect , determined by the nas@@ al body swelling , was significantly higher than under a mon@@ otherapy with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin over the 2 @-@ week treatment period . &quot;
&quot; the effectiveness of the Aer@@ op@@ ze tablets showed no significant differences with regard to sex , age or ethnic affili@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; as part of a single dose study for the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of the aer@@ op@@ ole , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin is det@@ ectable within 30 minutes after administration in the plasma . &quot;
&quot; after the per@@ or@@ al application of aer@@ ina@@ ze in healthy volunteers over 14 days , the flow equilibrium of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin , 3 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine and pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine was reached on day 10 . &quot;
&quot; in the context of a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic multi @-@ dose study , which was conducted with the formulation as a tablet of healthy adult subjects , it was found that four subjects Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin badly metabol@@ ised . &quot;
a component interaction study shows that the exposure ( C@@ MA@@ x and AU@@ C ) of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine after the sole administration of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ in bio@@ equivalent was for exposure to the gift of an aer@@ ina@@ ze tablet .
&quot; based on conventional studies on safety har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in re@@ peti@@ tive gift , for gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and reproductive toxic@@ ity , the prec@@ lin@@ ical data with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine do not reveal any particular haz@@ ards for the human being . &quot;
&quot; the combination had no greater toxic@@ ity than its individual components , and the observed effects were generally related to the substance pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine . &quot;
in reproductive @-@ toxic@@ ological studies the combination of Lor@@ at@@ adin / Pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine was not ter@@ ato@@ genic in a dosage of up to 150 mg / kg / day and rab@@ bits in a dosage of up to 120 mg / kg / day not ter@@ ato@@ genic .
March 2007 and in module 1.@@ 8.1 of the application application described pharmaceutical vig@@ il@@ ance system is established and works before and while the product is on the market .
anti@@ hi@@ stam@@ ines contribute to the alle@@ vi@@ ation of allergic symptoms by preventing hi@@ stam@@ ine and a body &apos;s substance to un@@ fold its effect .
&quot; aero@@ bic tablets alle@@ vi@@ ate symptoms associated with seasonal allergic r@@ hin@@ itis ( h@@ ay fever ) , such as ni@@ otic , running or ju@@ icy nose and tears or itch eyes while con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose . &quot;

&quot; after the launch of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin , very rarely has been reported about cases of severe allergic reactions ( breathing , wh@@ ist@@ ling breathing , it@@ ching , n@@ ett@@ le r@@ ash and swelling ) or r@@ ashes . &quot;
&quot; cases of pal@@ pit@@ ations , heart j@@ ars , stomach pain , nau@@ sea , v@@ om@@ iness , di@@ zz@@ iness , di@@ zz@@ iness , di@@ zz@@ iness , di@@ zz@@ iness , sleep disorders , muscle pain , sei@@ zur@@ es , rest@@ lessness with increased physical activity , about cases of liver inflammation and over cases of con@@ spic@@ uous liver values , was also very rare reported . &quot;
&quot; it is available as 5 mg tablet , 5 m@@ g@@ - Ly@@ oph@@ il@@ is@@ ate for intake ( soluble tray ) , 2.5 m@@ g@@ - and 5 mg melting tablets ( tablets that are dissolved in the mouth ) , 0.5 mg / ml @-@ sy@@ rup and as 0.5 mg / ml solution for intake . &quot;
&quot; for children from one to five years , the dose is 1.@@ 25 mg once daily , which is in the form of 2.5 ml sy@@ rup . &quot;
&quot; for children between six and eleven years , the dose is 2.5 mg once daily , either in the form of 5 ml of sy@@ rup or sy@@ rup . &quot;
A@@ eri@@ us was examined in eight studies with about 4 800 adults and adol@@ escents with allergic r@@ hin@@ itis ( including four studies on seasonal allergic r@@ hin@@ itis and two studies in patients who also had as@@ thma ) .
&quot; the effectiveness has been measured by identifying the symptoms ( it@@ ching , number and size of quad@@ r@@ elling , imp@@ air@@ ment of sleep and performance on day ) before and after six @-@ week treatment . &quot;
&quot; further studies have been submitted to prove that the body utili@@ zes the sy@@ rup , the solution to the intake and the enam@@ el tablets in the same way as the tablets and the application in children is harmless . &quot;
&quot; in case of allergic r@@ hin@@ itis , if the results of all studies were taken together , the two @-@ week treatment with 5 mg A@@ eri@@ us resulted in an average decrease of the symptom ( symptom score ) by 25 to 32 % , compared to the decrease of 12 to 26 % in patients receiving a plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in the two studies in Ur@@ tik@@ aria , the decrease of the symptom was obtained after six @-@ week treatment with A@@ eri@@ us 58 and 67 % compared to 40 and 33 % in patients treated with plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; A@@ eri@@ us may not be used in patients who are possibly hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , lau@@ ri@@ ad@@ ine or any of the other components . &quot;
&quot; in January 2001 , the European Commission informed the company SP Europe a permit for the transport of A@@ eri@@ us throughout the European Union . &quot;
&quot; one tablet once daily , with one or without a meal , to alle@@ vi@@ ate symptoms of allergic r@@ hin@@ itis ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent allergic r@@ hin@@ itis ) and ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
there are limited experience from clinical studies to effectiveness in the application of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine in young people aged 12 to 17 ( see Sec@@ tions 4.8 and 5.1 ) .
the treatment of the inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic r@@ hin@@ itis ( occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks ) should be carried out according to the previous disease progression and may be res@@ um@@ ed after the end of the symptoms and can be res@@ um@@ ed in their res@@ ume .
in the persist@@ ing allergic r@@ hin@@ itis ( occurrence of symptoms of 4 or more days a week and more than 4 weeks ) the patient can be recommended during the allergy time a continuous treatment .
clin@@ ically relevant interactions have not been found in clinical trials with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin tablets where er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were also administered ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; in a clin@@ ically @-@ pharmac@@ ological study , the effects of alcohol are not ampli@@ fied while taking A@@ eri@@ us and alcohol ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
&quot; however , patients should be informed that in very rare cases it may come to ligh@@ the@@ ade@@ dness , which can lead to an imp@@ air@@ ment of the imp@@ air@@ ment or the ability to serve machines . &quot;
&quot; clinical trials in various indications , including allergic r@@ hin@@ itis and chronic idi@@ opathic Ur@@ tic@@ aria , were reported at the recommended dose of 5 mg daily 3 % more side effects in patients with A@@ eri@@ us than in patients treated with plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; the most frequent side @-@ effects reported more frequently than plac@@ ebo were fatigue ( 1.2 % ) , mouth dr@@ y@@ ness ( 0.8 % ) and head@@ aches ( 0.6 % ) . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical trial with 5@@ 78 young patients from 12 to 17 years , the most common secondary effect was head@@ ache , this occurred at 5.9 % of patients treated with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin and with 6.9 % of patients treated with plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in a multi @-@ dose study , at which up to 45 mg of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin ( nin@@ ety clinical dose ) were administered , no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed . &quot;
&quot; this includes both the in@@ hibition of the release of inflammatory cy@@ tok@@ ines such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human mast cells / bas@@ oph@@ il@@ en as well as the in@@ hibition of the expression of the adhesion molecules P @-@ sel@@ ec@@ tin on end@@ othel@@ ial cells . &quot;
&quot; in the framework of a clinical trial with multiple doses , administered in the Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin in a dosage of up to 20 mg daily for 14 days , no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described . &quot;
&quot; in a clin@@ ically @-@ pharmac@@ ological study , administered in the Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin in a dosage of 45 m@@ g. a day ( the Ne@@ un@@ fold of the clinical dose ) was administered over ten days , there was no pro@@ long@@ ation of the Q@@ t@@ c interval . &quot;
&quot; in case of a single dose study involving adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine 5 mg showed no influence on standard measuring ranges of the gli@@ der including the rein@@ forcement of subjective drow@@ sin@@ ess or the tasks associated with flying . &quot;
&quot; in patients with allergic r@@ hin@@ itis , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in alle@@ vi@@ ating symptoms such as Ni@@ esen , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , lac@@ ri@@ mal flow and red@@ ness of the eyes as well as it@@ ching on the pal@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the established classification in seasonal and per@@ ennial , allergic r@@ hin@@ itis can be divided into inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic r@@ hin@@ itis and persistent allergic r@@ hin@@ itis . &quot;
inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic r@@ hin@@ itis is defined as the occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks .
persist@@ ing allergic r@@ hin@@ itis is defined as symptoms of 4 or more days a week and more than 4 weeks .
&quot; as shown by the overall result of the questionn@@ aire for quality of life in Rhin@@ o @-@ conjunction ec@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us effectively reduces the strain caused by seasonal allergic r@@ hin@@ itis . &quot;
&quot; chronic idi@@ opathic Ur@@ tic@@ aria was also a substitute for further forms of the Ur@@ tic@@ aria , since the underlying path@@ ophysi@@ ology is similar in the different forms , and chronic patients can be easily pro@@ spec@@ tively recru@@ ited . &quot;
&quot; since hist@@ ology is a caus@@ ative factor in all ur@@ tic@@ ari@@ al diseases , it is expected that Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine also leads to an improvement in the symptoms in other forms of the Ur@@ tic@@ aria ; this is confirmed by the recommendations of clinical guidelines . &quot;
&quot; in two plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with chronic idi@@ opathic Ur@@ tic@@ aria , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in improving pr@@ ur@@ itus and the reduction of size and number of squares at the end of the first dose interval . &quot;
&quot; as in other studies with anti@@ hi@@ stam@@ ines in chronic idi@@ opathic Ur@@ tic@@ aria , the minority of patients who did not re@@ acted to anti@@ hi@@ stam@@ ines from the study was excluded . &quot;
an improvement of it@@ ching by more than 50 % was observed in 55 % of patients treated with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin compared to 19 % of patients treated with plac@@ ebo .
&quot; the treatment with A@@ eri@@ us reduced the distur@@ b@@ ance of sleep and growth , as measured by a 4 @-@ point scale for evaluating these variables . &quot;
&quot; in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics study , in which patients were comparable with the general seasonal allergic r@@ hin@@ itis population , a higher concentration of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine was achieved in 4 % of patients . &quot;
there are no indications for clin@@ ically relevant cum@@ ulation after once daily use of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin ( 5- 20 mg ) over 14 days .
&quot; however , the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin has not yet been identified so that interactions with other medicines are not completely eliminated . &quot;
Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin inhi@@ bits in @-@ vi@@ vo not C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 and in @-@ vitro studies have shown that the drug C@@ YP@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 is not inhi@@ bited and neither a sub@@ strate nor an inhibit@@ or of the P gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ eins is .
&quot; in a single dose study with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin in a dosage of 7,5 mg meals ( fatty , cold @-@ rich breakfast ) did not affect the availability of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin . &quot;
&quot; the prec@@ lin@@ ical studies carried out with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin and Lor@@ at@@ adin showed no qualitative or quantitative differences regarding the toxic@@ ity profile of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin , and Lor@@ at@@ adin . &quot;
&quot; based on conventional studies on the safety har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated administration , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and reproductive toxic@@ ity , the prec@@ lin@@ ical data with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine do not identify any particular haz@@ ards for the human being . &quot;
&quot; color@@ less film ( contains l@@ act@@ ose mon@@ ohydr@@ ate , hy@@ pro@@ m@@ eric , titanium dioxide , Macro@@ go@@ l 400 , Indi@@ go@@ car@@ min ( E 132 ) ) , color@@ less film ( contains hy@@ pro@@ m@@ eric , Macro@@ go@@ l 400 ) , car@@ nau@@ ba wax , light wax . &quot;
&quot; A@@ eri@@ us can be taken independent of meals , to alle@@ vi@@ ate symptoms of allergic r@@ hin@@ itis ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent allergic r@@ hin@@ itis ) and ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
prescri@@ bing doctor should be aware that most cases of r@@ hin@@ itis in children under 2 years are caused by infection ( see section 4.4 ) and that there are no data that support a treatment of inf@@ ectious r@@ hin@@ itis with A@@ eri@@ us .
&quot; in addition to the exclusion of upper respiratory infections or anatom@@ ical an@@ om@@ ali@@ es , the an@@ am@@ nes@@ is , physical examinations and appropriate laboratory and skin examinations should play a role in the diagnosis . &quot;
about 6 % of adults and children from 2 to 11 years of age are met@@ ab@@ oli@@ zing des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine and experience higher sub @-@ tolerance ( see section 5.2 ) .
&quot; the safety of A@@ eri@@ us sy@@ rup in children between 2 and 11 years , which is fully met@@ ab@@ oli@@ zed , is identical to those with children who are normally met@@ ab@@ oli@@ zing . &quot;
&quot; this medicine contains su@@ cro@@ se and sor@@ bit@@ ol , therefore patients should not take with her@@ edit@@ ary problems of fru@@ ct@@ ose intoler@@ ance , glucose g@@ act@@ ose absorption or sac@@ char@@ ase is@@ om@@ alt@@ as@@ e- in@@ suffici@@ ency of this medicine . &quot;
clin@@ ically relevant interactions were not found in clinical trials with A@@ eri@@ us tablets where er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were also administered ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; in a clin@@ ically @-@ pharmac@@ ological study , while taking A@@ eri@@ us tablets and alcohol was not ampli@@ fied the performance @-@ reducing effect of alcohol ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
the total frequency of adverse events in children between 2 and 11 years was similar to the A@@ eri@@ us Sir@@ up Group as the plac@@ ebo group .
&quot; clinical trials involving adults and adol@@ escents in different indications , including allergic r@@ hin@@ itis and chronic idi@@ opathic Ur@@ tic@@ aria , were reported with the recommended dose 3 % more side effects in patients with A@@ eri@@ us than in patients treated with plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in a multi @-@ dose study in adults and adol@@ escents , at which up to 45 mg of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin ( nin@@ ety clinical dose ) were administered , no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed . &quot;
&quot; children aged between 1 and 11 years , who were asked for an anti@@ hi@@ stam@@ ine therapy , received a daily Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ indo@@ sis of 1.@@ 25 mg ( aged between 1 and 5 years ) or 2.5 mg ( aged between 6 and 11 years ) . &quot;
&quot; because of the course of allergic r@@ hin@@ itis / chronic idi@@ opathic Ur@@ tic@@ aria and the profile of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine in adults and children , the efficacy data of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine in adults can be ex@@ trap@@ ol@@ ated to the children &apos;s population . &quot;
&quot; in the framework of a clinical trial with multiple doses of adults and adol@@ escents , in the Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin used in a dosage of up to 20 mg daily for 14 days , no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described . &quot;
&quot; in a clin@@ ically @-@ pharmac@@ ological study of adults and adol@@ escents , in the Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin in a dosage of 45 m@@ g. a day ( the Ne@@ un@@ fold of the clinical dose ) was applied over ten days in adults , there was no pro@@ long@@ ation of the Q@@ t@@ c interval . &quot;
&quot; in controlled clinical studies , recommended dosage of 5 mg daily for adults and adol@@ escents was not found to have increased incidence of drow@@ sin@@ ess compared to plac@@ ebo . &quot;
for a single @-@ day dose of 7.5 mg A@@ eri@@ us tablets in adults and adol@@ escents in clinical studies have no imp@@ air@@ ment of the psych@@ omot@@ or .
&quot; in clinical @-@ phar@@ ma @-@ pharmac@@ ological studies in adults , the intake of alcohol was neither too a rein@@ forcement of alcohol @-@ induced imp@@ air@@ ment nor an increase in drow@@ sin@@ ess . &quot;
&quot; in adult and y@@ outh@@ ful patients with allergic r@@ hin@@ itis , A@@ eri@@ us tablets were effective in alle@@ vi@@ ating symptoms such as ni@@ eces , nose secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , lac@@ ri@@ mal flow and red@@ ness of the eyes as well as it@@ ching on the pal@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; as shown by the overall result of the questionn@@ aire for quality of life in Rhin@@ o @-@ conjunction tivi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us tablets effectively reduce the caused by seasonal allergic r@@ hin@@ itis . &quot;
&quot; in two plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with chronic idi@@ opathic Ur@@ tic@@ aria , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in improving pr@@ ur@@ itus and the reduction of size and number of squares at the end of the first dose interval . &quot;
&quot; the spread of this limited met@@ ab@@ oli@@ zing phen@@ otype was comparable to adults ( 6 % ) and children between 2 and 11 years ( 6 % ) and in both populations larger at bl@@ acks ( 18 % adults , 16 % children ) than with Kau@@ k@@ asi@@ ans ( 2 % adults , 3 % children ) . &quot;
similar pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic parameters were observed in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic multi @-@ dose study with si@@ r@@ action in children between 2 and 11 years with allergic r@@ hin@@ itis which are fully met@@ ab@@ oli@@ zed .
&quot; after 3 to 6 hours , the load ( AU@@ C ) was about 6@@ times higher and the C@@ MA@@ x was about 3 to 4 times higher with a terminal half @-@ time time of approximately 120 hours . &quot;
there are no indications for clin@@ ically relevant active substance cum@@ ulation after once daily use of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin ( 5- 20 mg ) for 14 days in adults and adol@@ escents .
12 In various individual dose studies it showed that AU@@ C@@ - and C@@ MA@@ x values were comparable with pedi@@ atric patients with the recommended doses compared to those of adults who received the Des@@ cor@@ at@@ adin sy@@ rup in a dosage of 5 mg .
&quot; however , the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine has not yet been identified so that interactions with other medicines cannot be excluded completely . &quot;

&quot; immediately prior to the application , the bli@@ ster must be carefully opened and the dose of the ly@@ op@@ hili@@ c can be removed without dam@@ aging it . &quot;
clin@@ ically relevant interactions were not found in clinical trials with A@@ eri@@ us tablets where er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were additionally applied ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; clinical trials in various indications , including allergic r@@ hin@@ itis and chronic idi@@ opathic Ur@@ tic@@ aria , were reported at the recommended dose of 5 mg daily 3 % more side effects in patients with A@@ eri@@ us tablets , than in patients treated with plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in a multi @-@ dose study , with which up to 45 mg of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin ( nin@@ ety clinical dose ) were used , no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed . &quot;
&quot; in two single dose studies , A@@ eri@@ us Ly@@ oph@@ il@@ is@@ at was well toler@@ ated ; this was documented by clinical laboratory results , medical examinations , vital signs and EC@@ G intervals . &quot;
&quot; in the framework of a clinical trial with multiple doses , in which Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin was applied in a dosage of up to 20 mg daily for 14 days , no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described . &quot;
&quot; in a clin@@ ically @-@ pharmac@@ ological study , in which des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin was applied in a dosage of 45 m@@ g. a day ( the Ne@@ un@@ fold of the clinical dose ) was applied over ten days , there was no pro@@ long@@ ation of the Q@@ t@@ c interval . &quot;
&quot; in controlled clinical studies , the recommended dosage of 5 mg daily was not found to have increased frequency of drow@@ sin@@ ess compared to plac@@ ebo . &quot;

there are limited experience from clinical studies to effectiveness in the application of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine in young people aged 12 to 17 ( see Sec@@ tions 4.8 and 5.1 )
&quot; immediately before application , the bli@@ ster must carefully open and remove the dose of the enam@@ el tablet without dam@@ aging it . &quot;
the efficacy and harm@@ lessness of A@@ eri@@ us 2.5 mg of enam@@ el tablets in the treatment of children under 6 years have not been proven .
the total frequency of side effects between the Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine Sir@@ up@@ - and the plac@@ ebo group was equal and declined significantly from the safety profile identified in adult patients .
at the recommended dose A@@ eri@@ us enam@@ el showed itself as a bio@@ equivalent to the A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg conventional tablet formulation and the A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg Ly@@ oph@@ il@@ is@@ ate for the decre@@ asing formulation of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin .
&quot; in the framework of a clinical trial with multiple doses , in which Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin was applied in a dosage of up to 20 mg daily for 14 days , no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically significant &quot;
&quot; with an adult dose study with adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurement sizes of the gli@@ der including the rein@@ forcement of subjective drow@@ sin@@ ess or the tasks associated with flying . &quot;
&quot; the spread of this badly met@@ ab@@ oli@@ zing phen@@ otype was comparable to adult ( 6 % ) and pa@@ edi@@ atric patients between 2 and 11 years ( 6 % ) , and under Black ( adults 18 % , children 16 % ) greater than with Kau@@ k@@ asi@@ ans ( adults 2 % , children 3 % ) , the safety profile of these patients was not devi@@ ating from that of the general population . &quot;
in individual dose @-@ crossover studies from A@@ eri@@ us melting tablet with A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg conventional tablets or A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg Ly@@ oph@@ il@@ is@@ at to intake were the form@@ ulations bio@@ equivalent .
&quot; A@@ eri@@ us 2.5 mg tablets were not studied in pedi@@ atric patients , but in connection with the dose @-@ finding studies in children , however , the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data for A@@ eri@@ us melting tablets support the use of the 2.5 mg dosage in children from 6 to 11 years . &quot;

&quot; at the recommended dose , A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg of enam@@ el tablets proved to be a bio@@ equivalent to the A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg conventional tablet formulation and the A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg Ly@@ oph@@ il@@ is@@ ate for the decre@@ asing formulation of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin . &quot;
&quot; in the framework of a clinical trial with multiple doses , in which Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin was applied in a dosage of up to 20 mg daily for 14 days , no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described . &quot;
&quot; at a 30 single dose study with adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurement sizes of the gli@@ der including the rein@@ forcement of subjective drow@@ sin@@ ess or the tasks associated with flying . &quot;
&quot; in patients with allergic r@@ hin@@ itis , A@@ eri@@ us tablets were effective in alle@@ vi@@ ating symptoms such as ni@@ eces , nose secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , lac@@ ri@@ mal flow and red@@ ness of the eyes as well as it@@ ching on the pal@@ ate . &quot;
in individual dose @-@ crossover studies from A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg of enam@@ el tablets with A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg conventional tablets or A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg Ly@@ oph@@ il@@ is@@ at to intake were the form@@ ulations bio@@ equivalent .
overall analysis of the pre@@ clinical and clinical tests for the enam@@ el tablet revealed that this formulation represents an unlikely risk for local irrit@@ ations in clinical application .
&quot; the safety of lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine in children between 2 and 11 years , which is fully met@@ ab@@ oli@@ zed , is identical to those with children who are normally met@@ ab@@ oli@@ zing . &quot;
&quot; this medicine contains sor@@ bit@@ ol , therefore patients should not take with her@@ edit@@ ary problems of fru@@ ct@@ ose intoler@@ ance , glucose g@@ act@@ ose absorption or sac@@ char@@ ase is@@ om@@ alt@@ ase in@@ suffici@@ ency of this medicine . &quot;
the total frequency of adverse events in children between 2 and 11 years was similar to the plac@@ ebo group .
&quot; minor children between 6 and 23 months were the most common side effects reported more frequently than plac@@ ebo , di@@ arr@@ ho@@ e ( 3.7 % ) , fever ( 2,3 % ) and sle@@ e@@ pl@@ ess@@ ness ( 2,3 % ) . &quot;
&quot; in an additional study , no side effects in patients aged between 6 and 11 years were observed in an additional study of 2.5 mg of Des@@ cor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine . &quot;
&quot; among the recommended doses , the plas@@ mac@@ ular concentrations of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine ( see section 5.2 ) were comparable in the children &apos;s and adult population . &quot;
&quot; in controlled clinical studies , recommended dosage of 5 mg daily for adults and adol@@ escents was not found to have increased incidence of drow@@ sin@@ ess compared to plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the established classification in seasonal and per@@ ennial , allergic r@@ hin@@ itis may be dependent on the duration of symptoms alternatively also in inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic r@@ hin@@ itis and &quot;
&quot; as shown by the overall result of the questionn@@ aire for quality of life in Rhin@@ o con@@ junc@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us tablets effectively reduce the strain caused by seasonal allergic r@@ hin@@ itis . &quot;
&quot; the spread of this limited met@@ ab@@ oli@@ zing phen@@ otype was comparable to adults ( 6 % ) and children between 2 and 11 years ( 6 % ) and in both populations larger at bl@@ acks ( 18 % adults , 16 % children ) than with Kau@@ k@@ asi@@ ans ( 2 % adults , 3 % children ) . &quot;
&quot; since A@@ eri@@ us solution for taking the same concentration on Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin , no bio@@ equivalent study was required and it is expected that it corresponds to the sy@@ rup and the tablets . &quot;
&quot; in various individual dose studies , AU@@ C@@ - and C@@ MA@@ x values were comparable with pedi@@ atric patients with the recommended doses compared to those of adults who received the Des@@ cor@@ at@@ adin sy@@ rup in a dosage of 5 mg . &quot;

June 2008 Nov@@ arti@@ s V@@ acc@@ ines and Diagnostics S.@@ r.@@ l. officially shared the CH@@ MP &apos;s Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Medic@@ inal Products for Medic@@ inal Products for Medic@@ inal H@@ 5@@ N@@ 1 influ@@ enza in adults and older people .
A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov should be used in adults and elderly people to protect against flu caused by the strain ( type ) H@@ 5@@ N@@ 1 of the influ@@ enza A virus .
this is a special type of vacc@@ ine that is supposed to protect from a trunk of the flu virus that could cause a future pan@@ de@@ mic .
&quot; influ@@ enza pan@@ de@@ mic breaks out when a new trunk of the flu virus appears , which can easily be spread from human to human beings , because people still have no immun@@ ity ( no protection ) against it . &quot;
&quot; after administration of the vacc@@ ine , the immune system det@@ ects the parts of the flu virus contained in the vacc@@ ine as &quot; &quot; physical &quot; &quot; and forms antibodies against it . &quot;
&quot; in this way , the immune system will later be able to form an antibody quicker in contact with a flu virus . &quot;
&quot; subsequently , the membrane covering of the virus with the &quot; surface anti@@ gens &quot; ( proteins on the membrane surface , which recognizes the human body as a body @-@ alien ) , was puri@@ fied , cleaned and used as a component of the vacc@@ ine . &quot;
inspection of some of the study sites showed that the study was not carried out according to the &quot; good clinical practice &quot; ( G@@ CP ) .
this results in the scope of the clinical data base for evaluating the safety of the vacc@@ ine in order to meet the requirements of the EME@@ A guidelines for pre @-@ pan@@ de@@ mic vacc@@ ines .
&quot; should you take part in a clinical trial and require further information about your treatment , please contact your doctor &apos;s doctor . &quot;
&quot; if you would like more information on the basis of CH@@ MP recommendations , please read the scientific discussion ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) . &quot;
&quot; it is used in combination with other anti@@ viral drugs for the treatment of adults and children over four years , which are infected with the human immun@@ ode@@ fici@@ ency virus of type 1 ( HIV @-@ 1 ) , which causes the acquired immun@@ ode@@ fici@@ ency syndrome ( AIDS ) . &quot;
&quot; for patients who cannot swal@@ low the capsules , A@@ generator is available as a solution for taking , but this cannot be taken together with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r because the safety of this combination has not been studied . &quot;
&quot; generic drugs should only be prescribed if the doctor has examined what anti@@ viral drugs the patient has previously taken , and the lik@@ el@@ ihood has assessed the virus to appeal to the medicine . &quot;
&quot; the recommended dose for patients over twelve years is 600 mg twice daily , which together with twice daily 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and with other anti@@ viral drugs . &quot;
&quot; for children between four and twelve years and in patients with a body weight of less than 50 kg , the recommended dose of A@@ gener@@ a depends on the body weight . &quot;
A@@ gener@@ a reduces the HIV amount in the blood when combined with other anti@@ viral medicines and keeps them at a low level .
&quot; AIDS does not cure , however , can delay the damage of the immune system and thus also the development of associated infections and diseases . &quot;
&quot; A@@ gener@@ a was studied in combination with other anti@@ viral drugs , but without Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , in two main studies with 7@@ 36 HIV @-@ infected adults who had previously not been treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; the drug used with low dos@@ ed Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r was compared with 206 adults who used previously prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , compared to other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors . &quot;
the main indicator of efficacy was the proportion of patients with un@@ proven concentrations of HIV in the blood ( viral load ) or the change of viral load after treatment .
&quot; in the studies involving patients who had previously no prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , more patients had a viral load under 400 copies / ml compared to plac@@ ebo , but A@@ gener@@ ase was less effective than in@@ din@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; in children , A@@ gener@@ a also reduced the viral load , but of the children who were previously treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , only very few responded to the treatment . &quot;
&quot; in the study involving adults , previously treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , the drug used with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r increased the viral load after 16 @-@ week treatment as effective as other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors : &quot;
&quot; in patients with HIV , which was resistant to four other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , it came under A@@ gener@@ ase along with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r to increase viral load after four weeks as in patients receiving their previous prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors : &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of aden@@ asis ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) are head@@ aches , di@@ arr@@ ho@@ ea ( di@@ arr@@ ho@@ ea ) , flat@@ ul@@ ence ( v@@ om@@ iting ) , nau@@ sea ( nau@@ sea ) , v@@ om@@ iting , r@@ ash and fatigue ( fatigue ) . &quot;
2 / 3 A@@ gener@@ a must not be applied to patients who are possibly hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r or any of the other components .
&quot; A@@ gener@@ a must also not be used in patients , the cur@@ rant ( a herbal supplement for the treatment of depression ) or medicines that are degra@@ ded in the same way as aden@@ asis and are in high concentrations in the blood health @-@ harmful . &quot;
&quot; as with other medicines for HIV , patients who are taking A@@ gener@@ a are the risk of a li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy ( changes in the distribution of body fat ) or an immune re@@ activation syndrome ( symptoms of infection caused by the immune system ) . &quot;
the Committee on Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of A@@ generation in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs for the treatment of HIV @-@ 1 infected adults and children over four years out@@ weigh the risks .
&quot; generic A@@ gener@@ a is usually taken together with the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic amplifier Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , but the committee set out that the benefit of sugar@@ s in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients who previously did not have prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , is not proven . &quot;
&quot; A@@ gener@@ a was originally admitted under &quot; &quot; exceptional circumstances &quot; &quot; because only limited information is available at the time of approval for scientific reasons . &quot;
&quot; in October 2000 , the European Commission granted the Company G@@ lax@@ o Group Limited a permit for asylum in the entire European Union . &quot;
&quot; A@@ gener@@ a is shown in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines for the treatment of HIV @-@ 1 infected , prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors ( PI ) pre @-@ treated adults and children from 4 years . &quot;
&quot; usually , A@@ gener@@ a capsules should be administered to the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic booster of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r along with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( see section 4.2 and 4.5 ) . &quot;
the use of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r should take place considering the individual viral resistance pattern and pre@@ treatment of the patient ( see section 5.1 ) .
the bio@@ availability of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r as a solution to intake is 14 % lower than am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r as capsule ; therefore A@@ gener@@ a capsules and solution are not inter@@ changeable on a milli@@ gram per milli@@ gram basis ( see section 5.2 ) .
the recommended dose for A@@ xi@@ ase capsules amounts to 600 mg of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r twice a day together with 100 mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
&quot; 2 If A@@ gen@@ ase capsules are applied without the rein@@ forcing addi@@ tive of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( booster ) , higher doses of A@@ generation ( 1200 mg twice daily ) must be applied . &quot;
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ a Cap@@ sules is 20 mg of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs up to a daily dose of 2400 mg am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r which should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics , efficacy and safety of gases in combination with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors were not studied in children . &quot;
&quot; A@@ gener@@ a is not recommended for use in children under 4 years , due to the lack of data for harm@@ lessness and efficacy ( see section 5.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; based on pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data , the dose of A@@ gener@@ a capsules should be reduced to 450 mg twice daily and in patients with severe liver function disorders to 300 mg twice daily . &quot;
&quot; the simultaneous application is to be treated with caution in patients with mild or moderate liver function disorder , in patients with severe liver dysfunction , it is contra@@ indicated ( see section 4.3 ) . &quot;
A@@ gener@@ a must not be given simultaneously with medicines that have a low therapeutic width and also represent sub@@ str@@ ates of the cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 @-@ I@@ so@@ enzyme 3@@ A4 ( C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 ) .
herbal supplements containing Johann@@ is@@ kr@@ aut ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) may not be applied due to the risk reduced plasma concentrations and a dimin@@ ished therapeutic effect of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r during the intake of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( see section 4.5 ) .
patients should be advised that A@@ gener@@ a or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy does not lead to a cure of HIV infection and that they can continue to develop opportun@@ ist infections or other complications of HIV infection .
the current anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including treatment with A@@ gener@@ a does not prevent the risk of transferring HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood .
&quot; usually , A@@ gener@@ a capsules should be used together with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot;
patients suffering from chronic hepatitis B or C and treated with anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy have increased risk of severe liver side effects with potentially le@@ thal course .
&quot; for the case of simultaneous anti@@ viral treatment of hepatitis B , or C , please read the relevant specialist information of this medicine . &quot;
patients with pre @-@ existing hep@@ atic function including chronic @-@ active hepatitis show increased frequency of liver function disorders under an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy and should be monitored according to clinical practice .
&quot; simultaneous application of A@@ gener@@ a and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r with Flu@@ tic@@ as@@ one or other glu@@ co@@ co@@ ster@@ o@@ ids that will be metabol@@ ised via C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 , is not recommended unless the potential benefits of treatment over@@ weigh the risk of system@@ ic cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ o@@ co@@ ster@@ o@@ ids including Mor@@ bus Cus@@ hing and Supp@@ ression of the adren@@ al function ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; since the metabol@@ isation of the H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ A @-@ reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin strongly depend on C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 , a simultaneous administration of v@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin is not recommended because of the increased risk of my@@ opath@@ ies including r@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ oly@@ sis . &quot;
&quot; 4 For some medicines that can cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects , such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ arb@@ ital , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ de@@ press@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under supervision of the International Norm@@ alised R@@ atio ) , are available methods for determining the concentration of active ingredients . &quot;
patients who are taking this medicine at the same time can be less effective due to decreased plas@@ m@@ atism of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( see section 4.5 ) .
&quot; due to the possibility of met@@ abolic interactions with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , the effectiveness of hormon@@ al contrac@@ ep@@ tives may be altered , but the information is not sufficient to assess the type of interactions . &quot;
&quot; if meth@@ ad@@ one is given simultaneously with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , patients should therefore be monitored for op@@ ium removal symptoms , especially if also low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r are given . &quot;
&quot; due to the possible risk of toxic@@ ity due to the high level of propylene gly@@ col@@ o@@ hal@@ ts , this formulation is contra@@ indicated in children under an age of four years and should be used with caution in certain other patient groups . &quot;
A@@ gener@@ a should be set up in duration 5 if a r@@ ash is accompanied by system@@ ic or allergic symptoms or the mu@@ c@@ ous membran@@ es are involved ( see section 4.8 ) .
&quot; patients receiving anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors were reported on the occurrence of diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia , or an exac@@ erb@@ ation of an existing diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus . &quot;
&quot; many of the patients had other diseases , to which therapy medications were needed , which are associated with the development of diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia . &quot;
&quot; B . higher age , and with drug @-@ dependent factors , such as a longer lasting anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and associated met@@ abolic disorders . &quot;
Hem@@ oph@@ ile patients ( type A and B ) treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors are reports of an increase in ble@@ eding including spontaneous ha@@ em@@ at@@ oms and hem@@ mar@@ thro@@ sis .
&quot; at the time of initi@@ ating an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) , HIV @-@ infected patients may develop an inflammatory response to asy@@ mpt@@ om@@ atic or residual opportun@@ ist infections resulting in severe clinical conditions or deteri@@ oration of symptoms . &quot;
&quot; although a multi@@ fact@@ orial eth@@ ology is accepted ( including use of cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ o@@ ids , alcohol consumption , severe immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression , higher Body @-@ Mass Index ) , cases of oste@@ on@@ ek@@ rose were reported in particular in patients with advanced HIV infection and / or long @-@ term application of an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) . &quot;
C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 sub@@ str@@ ates with low therapeutic width A@@ generation must not be given at the same time with medicines that have a low therapeutic width and also represent sub@@ str@@ ates of the cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 @-@ I@@ so@@ enzyme 3@@ A4 ( C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 ) .
&quot; C@@ YP@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 sub@@ str@@ ates with low therapeutic width A@@ generation with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r must not be combined with medicines , which are mainly metabol@@ ised via C@@ YP@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and are associated with serious and / or life @-@ threatening side effects . &quot;
&quot; it was shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in caused a 82 % reduction in the AU@@ C of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , which can lead to a vi@@ rolog@@ ical failure and lead to resistance . &quot;
&quot; in trying to compens@@ ate the reduced plasma levels by a dose increase of other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , very often undes@@ irable effects on the liver were observed . &quot;
Johann@@ is@@ kr@@ aut ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) The ser@@ um mirror of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r can be reduced by the simultaneous application of herbal preparations with Johann@@ is@@ kr@@ aut ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) .
&quot; if a patient already adop@@ ts Johann@@ is@@ kr@@ aut , the ampl@@ itude level and , if possible , examine the viral load and remove the car@@ ob cab@@ b@@ age . &quot;
dosage adjustment for one of the medicine is not required when nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r is administered together with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( see also E@@ f@@ avi@@ r@@ enz below ) .
&quot; 508 % increases , however , reduced by 30 % for C@@ MA@@ x , when Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) is administered in combination with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials , dos@@ ages of 600 mg of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r are applied twice a day and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice daily , which demonstrate the efficacy and harm@@ lessness of this treatment scheme . &quot;
52 % lower if Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 750 mg twice daily ) is administered twice daily in combination with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg of Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) .
&quot; the C@@ min values of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in plasma , which were achieved twice a day with the combination of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) , are approximately 40 to 50 % lower than when Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) is administered twice daily in combination with 100 mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice a day . &quot;
&quot; dosage recommendation for simultaneous administration of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Kal@@ et@@ ra can not be given , but a close @-@ mes@@ hed surveillance is recommended as the efficacy and harm@@ lessness of this combination is not known . &quot;
&quot; there was no pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study carried out in combination with Di@@ dan@@ os@@ in , but is recommended for at least one hour due to the an@@ ta@@ zi@@ dis component of Di@@ dan@@ os@@ in ( see An@@ ta@@ zi@@ da below ) . &quot;
&quot; therefore , in combination with ampl@@ avi@@ r@@ enz in combination with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) no dose adaptation is required . &quot;
the treatment with E@@ f@@ avi@@ r@@ enz in combination with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Sa@@ qu@@ in@@ avi@@ r is not recommended as the exposure of both prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors would lower .
the effect of Ne@@ vir@@ ap@@ in to other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors and existing limited data suggest that Ne@@ vir@@ ap@@ in reduces the ser@@ um concentration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
&quot; if these medicines should be used at the same time , caution is advisable because Del@@ avi@@ r@@ din could be less effective because of the reduced or possibly sub@@ therapeutic plasma level . &quot;
&quot; if these medicines are applied together , caution is required ; a thorough clinical and vi@@ rolog@@ ical monitoring should be made , since a precise predic@@ ting of the effect of the combination of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on del@@ avi@@ r@@ din is difficult . &quot;
the simultaneous administration of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin led to an increase in plasma concentration ( AU@@ C ) by Ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin by 193 % and thus to an increase in the side effects associated with Ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin .
&quot; if it is necessary for clinical reasons to admini@@ ster Ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin along with A@@ gener@@ a , it is recommended to reduce the dosage of ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin at least half of the recommended dose , although there are no clinical data . &quot;
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic studies with A@@ gen@@ ase in combination with er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin have not been performed but could increase the plasma levels of both drugs in the case of simultaneous administration .
the simultaneous application of 200 mg of F@@ os@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r and 100 mg of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole once daily led to an increase in the C@@ MA@@ x of K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole once daily without a simultaneous application of F@@ os@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
&quot; other medicines , which are listed below , including sub@@ str@@ ates , inhibit@@ ors or induc@@ tors of C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 , may result in potentially inter@@ dependen@@ cies . &quot;
patients should therefore be monitored for toxic reactions which are associated with these medicines when they are used in combination with A@@ gener@@ a .
&quot; based on the data of other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , it is advisable that An@@ ta@@ zi@@ da is not taken at the same time as A@@ gener@@ a since it can come to res@@ or@@ ption disorders . &quot;
&quot; simultaneous application of anti@@ conv@@ ul@@ ants known as enzymes ( phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , phen@@ ob@@ arb@@ ital , carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine ) , with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r can lead to a degra@@ dation of the plasma level of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; the ser@@ um concentrations of calcium channel block@@ ers such as Am@@ lo@@ di@@ pine , Dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em , Fel@@ odi@@ pine , Ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@
&quot; con@@ current intake with as@@ gener@@ a can considerably increase their plasma concentrations and strengthen with PD@@ E@@ 5 inhibit@@ ors in connection with related side effects , including hyp@@ ot@@ en@@ sion , visual distur@@ bances and pri@@ ap@@ ism ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical trial , in which Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg capsules were given twice daily together with 50 µ@@ g flu@@ tic@@ as@@ on@@ pro@@ pi@@ on@@ ate in@@ tran@@ as@@ al ( 4 times daily ) over 7 days of subjects , the endo@@ genous cor@@ ti@@ sol decreased by about 86 % ( 90 % -@@ Con@@ fi@@ dence interval 82 to 89 % ) . &quot;
&quot; consequently , the simultaneous administration of sugar@@ s with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r along with these glu@@ co@@ co@@ ids is not recommended unless the possible benefit of a treatment out@@ weighs the risk of system@@ ic kor@@ ean@@ ic ero@@ id effects ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; with H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ A @-@ reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors such as Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin , whose metabol@@ isation is strongly dependent on C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 , distinct increases of plasma levels are expected in con@@ current administration of A@@ gener@@ a . &quot;
&quot; as plasma level increases of these H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors lead to my@@ opathy , including a r@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ oly@@ sis , the combined use of these drugs is not recommended with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; a more frequent monitoring of therapeutic concentrations is recommended to stabili@@ ze the mirror , as the plasma concentrations of Cy@@ clos@@ por@@ in , Rap@@ am@@ y@@ cin and Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can be increased by the simultaneous administration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; therefore , A@@ gener@@ a must not be applied together with or@@ ally taken Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am ( see section 4.3 ) , while con@@ genital Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am should be cau@@ ti@@ ously advisable . &quot;
data for simultaneous use of par@@ enter@@ al mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am with other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors point to a possible increase in plasma levels from Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am to 3 @-@ 4 @-@ fold .
&quot; if meth@@ ad@@ one is administered together with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , patients should therefore be monitored for op@@ ium removal symptoms , especially if also low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r are administered . &quot;
&quot; because of the low reliability of historical compar@@ isons , there is currently no recommendation to be given as the am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r dose is to be adjusted if am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is administered at the same time with meth@@ ad@@ one . &quot;
&quot; while offering war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants together with A@@ gener@@ a , increased control of the IN@@ R ( International Norm@@ alised R@@ atio ) is recommended because of the possibility of weak@@ ening or rein@@ forcing the anti@@ thro@@ mb@@ otic effect ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; the effect of an additional administration of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on hormon@@ al contrac@@ ep@@ tive is not predic@@ table , so alternative methods for contrac@@ eption are recommended . &quot;
careful monitoring of therapeutic effects and side effects of tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ de@@ press@@ ants ( for example Des@@ i@@ pr@@ amine and Nor@@ tr@@ yp@@ ti@@ lin ) is recommended by A@@ gener@@ a ( see section 4.4 ) .
&quot; during pregnancy , this medicine may only be used after careful weighing of possible benefits for the mother compared to possible risks for the fet@@ us . &quot;
&quot; in the milk lac@@ tation rats , am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r @-@ related substances have been proven , but it is not known whether am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r passes into breast milk in humans . &quot;
&quot; a reproduction study of pregnant rats , which was administered by the ni@@ st@@ ling in the uter@@ us to the end of the lac@@ tation period , showed a dimin@@ ished increase in the 12 body weight in the seed . &quot;
the further development of the descendants including fertility and reproductive capacity was not affected by the administration of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r to the mother animal .
A@@ gener@@ a &apos;s harm@@ lessness has been studied in adults and children from 4 years in controlled clinical studies in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs .
&quot; most of the side effects associated with the A@@ gener@@ ase treatment were mild to moderate , occurred early and frequently led to the treatment of treatment . &quot;
&quot; many of these events are not clari@@ fied whether or not they are used in connection with the intake of A@@ gener@@ a or another at the same time to the HIV treatment , or whether they are a consequence of the disease . &quot;
&quot; most of the side effects mentioned below come from two clinical trials ( PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 1 , PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 6 ) , in which patients with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors received 1200 mg of A@@ gener@@ ase twice daily . &quot;
&quot; events ( grade 2 to 4 ) , which were evaluated by the investig@@ ators as in connection with study medi@@ ation , and were performed with more than 1 % of patients , as well as under the treatment occurring laboratory alter@@ ations ( Grade 3 to 4 ) . &quot;
&quot; anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy was associated with a re@@ distribution of body fat ( li@@ po@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy ) in HIV patients , including a loss of peripher@@ al and vis@@ cer@@ al fatty tissue , hyper@@ tro@@ phy of breasts and dor@@ so@@ cer@@ vi@@ cal fat accumulation . &quot;
&quot; under 113 anti@@ retro@@ viral not pre@@ treated persons treated with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in combination with Lam@@ iv@@ ud@@ din / Zi@@ do@@ v@@ u@@ din for a medium duration of 36 weeks , only one case ( cr@@ acking ) ( &lt; 1 % ) was observed . &quot;
&quot; in the study PRO@@ AB 300@@ 6 patients were presented at 245 N@@ R@@ TI@@ R 7 cases ( 3 % ) compared to 27 cases ( 11 % ) in 241 patients under in@@ din@@ avi@@ r , in combination with various N@@ R@@ TI@@ s for a mean duration of 56 weeks ( p &lt; 0,@@ 001 ) . &quot;
&quot; skin r@@ ashes were usually mild to moderate , er@@ y@@ them@@ at@@ ous or ma@@ ku@@ lo@@ pap@@ ules nature , with or without it@@ ching and occurred spont@@ aneously within two weeks without having to cancel the treatment with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; cases of oste@@ opor@@ osis were reported in particular in patients with commonly known risk factors , advanced HIV infection or long @-@ term treatment of anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) . &quot;
&quot; at the time of initi@@ ating an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) , HIV @-@ infected patients may develop an inflammatory response to asy@@ mpt@@ om@@ atic or residual opportun@@ istic infections ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; with PI pre @-@ treated patients receiving 600 mg of A@@ generation twice daily together with low dos@@ ed Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) , were kind and frequency of side effects ( grade 2 to 4 ) and laboratory alter@@ ations ( Grade 3 and 4 ) , which were observed in patients who received A@@ gener@@ ase together with low dos@@ ed Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , very frequently . &quot;
&quot; in case of over@@ dosage , the patient is to observe signs of an in@@ toxic@@ ation ( see Section 4.8 ) if necessary , necessary supporting measures . &quot;
&quot; Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r bin@@ ds to the active centre of HIV @-@ 1 prot@@ ease , thereby preventing the processing of viral g@@ ag@@ - and g@@ ag @-@ pol@@ - poly@@ prot@@ ein@@ vor@@ es with the result of formation im@@ mature , non inf@@ ectious viral particles . &quot;
&quot; the anti@@ viral activity of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in vitro against HIV @-@ 1 II@@ IB was examined both in acute and chronic lymp@@ ho@@ blas@@ tic cell lines ( MT @-@ 4 , CE@@ M @-@ C@@ CR@@ F , H@@ 9 ) and peripher@@ al blood lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes . &quot;
the 50 % hem@@ m@@ concentration ( IC@@ 50 ) of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r lies in the range of 0.0@@ 12 to 0.0@@ 08 µ@@ M with acute infected cells and amounts to 0.@@ 41 µ@@ M for chronic infected cells .
the connection between the activity of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r against HIV @-@ 1 in vitro and the in@@ hibition of HIV @-@ 1 rep@@ lication in humans is not yet defined .
in the treatment anti@@ retro@@ viral not previously treated patients with the currently approved F@@ os@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r dos@@ ages were observed - as with other Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r fet@@ ched treatment schemes with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors - the described mut@@ ations rarely observed .
&quot; in six@@ teen of 434 anti@@ retro@@ viral not pre@@ treated patients receiving 700@@ mg F@@ os@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r with 100mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice a day in the study ES@@ S@@ 100@@ 7@@ 32 , a vi@@ rolog@@ ical failure occurred up to week 48 , whereby 14 isol@@ ates could be gen@@ otyp@@ ically examined . &quot;
&quot; gen@@ otyp@@ ic analysis of the isol@@ ate of 13 out of 14 children , with which a vi@@ rolog@@ ical failure occurred within the 59 patients with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , showed resistance patterns that were similar to those in adults . &quot;
&quot; L@@ 10@@ F / I / V , V@@ 11@@ I , I@@ 13@@ V , K@@ 20@@ R , V@@ 32@@ I , L@@ 33@@ F , M@@ 46@@ I / L , I@@ 47@@ V , V@@ 77@@ I , V@@ 82@@ A / I , I@@ 84@@ V , I@@ 85@@ V , L@@ 90@@ M and I@@ 93@@ L / M . &quot;
in the AP@@ V@@ 300@@ 03 study and its extension AP@@ V@@ 300@@ 05 ( 700 mg F@@ os@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r / 100 mg of F@@ os@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r / 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily : N = 107 ) performed in patients with vi@@ rolog@@ ical failure over 96 weeks following prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors :
gen@@ otyp@@ ical interpre@@ tations based on gen@@ otyp@@ ical resistance testing can be applied to estimate the activity of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or F@@ os@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors isol@@ ates .
&quot; current ( July 2006 ) AN@@ RS @-@ AC @-@ 11 algorithm for F@@ os@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r defines resistance as the presence of mut@@ ations V@@ 32@@ I + 147@@ A / V , or I@@ 50@@ V , V@@ 82@@ A / C / S / T / V , I@@ 84@@ V , V@@ 82@@ A / C / F / G , I@@ 84@@ V and L@@ 90@@ M with a reduced probability of vi@@ rolog@@ ical response ( resistance ) . &quot;
&quot; the conclusions regarding relevance of certain mut@@ ations or mut@@ ation patterns may be subject to changes by additional data , and it is recommended to always draw up the current interpretation systems for analysis of the results of resistance tests . &quot;
phen@@ otyp@@ ic evaluation systems based on phen@@ otyp@@ ical resistance testing can be used in conjunction with gen@@ otyp@@ ical data for estim@@ ating the activity of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors isol@@ ates .
companies that exp@@ el diagnostic resistance tests have developed clin@@ ically @-@ phen@@ otyp@@ ic cut @-@ off@@ s ( separ@@ ators ) for F@@ PV / R@@ TV which can be used to interpret the results of a resistance test .
&quot; each of these four with a reduced sensitivity to am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r associated genetic patterns creates a certain cross @-@ resistance to Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , the sensitivity to in@@ din@@ avi@@ r , nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r and Sa@@ qu@@ in@@ avi@@ r remains generally preserved . &quot;
&quot; there are currently data on the cross @-@ resistance between Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors for all 4 F@@ os@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r resistance paths , either alone or in combination with other mut@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; on the basis of twenty @-@ five anti@@ retro@@ viral not pre@@ treated patients , with which a F@@ os@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( one of 25 isol@@ ates ) , in@@ din@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 isol@@ ates ) , Sa@@ qu@@ in@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 isol@@ ates ) , Sa@@ qu@@ in@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 isol@@ ates ) and Ti@@ p@@ ran@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( four of 24 isol@@ ates ) . &quot;
&quot; conver@@ sely , Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r reserves its activity against some other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors ; the preservation of this activity appears to be dependent on the number and type of resistance mut@@ ations in the isol@@ ates . &quot;
early abor@@ tion of a stag@@ gering treatment is recommended to keep the accumulation of a variety of mut@@ ations within limits that can affect the subsequent treatment .
&quot; evidence of effectiveness of A@@ gener@@ a in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice daily is based on the study PRO@@ 300@@ 17 , a random@@ ized open study , in which with PI pre @-@ treated adults after vi@@ rolog@@ ical failure ( 100 mg twice daily ) and a standard therapy ( standard of care , SO@@ C ) with a PI , predominantly with low @-@ dos@@ ed Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r &quot; &quot; geb@@ oo@@ st@@ ert &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; one hundred and sixty ( n = 163 ) patients with proven virus sensitivity towards A@@ gener@@ a , at least one other PI and at least one N@@ RT@@ I were included in the study A of PRO@@ 300@@ 17 . &quot;
the primary analysis set the non @-@ sub@@ ority of AP@@ V / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r compared to the SO@@ C @-@ PI group in the viral load ( A@@ AU@@ C@@ MB ) in the viral load ( HIV @-@ 1 RNA ) in the viral load ( HIV @-@ 1 RNA ) in the viral load of 0.4 log@@ 10 copies / ml .
&quot; evidence of the efficacy of un@@ bi@@ ased A@@ generation is based on two un@@ controlled studies with a total of 288 HIV @-@ infected children aged 2 to 18 , of which 152 were pre@@ treated with PI . &quot;
&quot; in studies , A@@ gener@@ a solution for intake and capsules in doses of 15 mg / kg three times daily , 20 mg / kg three times daily , 20 mg / kg twice daily , 20 mg / kg twice daily and 2@@ 2.5 mg / kg twice daily , with the majority of patients received 20 mg / kg twice daily . &quot;
no low dos@@ ed rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r was given at the same time ; the majority of patients treated with PI previously had at least one ( 78 % ) or two ( 42 % ) of the N@@ R@@ TI@@ s administered together with A@@ gener@@ a .
&quot; after 48 weeks , approximately 25 % of patients included in the study had a plasma HIV @-@ 1 RNA concentration &lt; 10,000 copies / ml and 9 % &lt; 400 copies / ml with a medi@@ an increase in CD@@ 4 cell count of 26 cells / mm ³ ( n = 74 ) compared to the initial value . &quot;
&quot; 19 Based on these data , treatment optimisation should be taken into account in the treatment optimisation with PI pre @-@ treated children of the expected benefit of &quot; un@@ born &quot; A@@ gener@@ a . &quot;
&quot; after oral submission , the average duration ( T@@ max ) is about 1 to 2 hours for the capsule and about 0.5 to 1 hour for the solution . &quot;
&quot; 508 % increase , by contrast to C@@ MA@@ x by 30 % , when Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered together with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) . &quot;
&quot; the administration of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r with a meal leads to a 25 % decrease in AU@@ C , but has no effect on the concentration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r 12 hours after dosage ( C@@ 12 ) . &quot;
&quot; therefore , minimal concentration in the steady state ( C@@ min , ss ) remained un@@ affected by food intake , although the simultaneous intake of food influences the extent and rate of res@@ or@@ ption . &quot;
the apparent distribution volume amounts to approximately 430 l ( 6 l / kg at a weight of 70 kg ) and can be connected to a large distribution volume as well as an un@@ ob@@ struc@@ ted penetration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r from the blood@@ stream into the tissue .
&quot; this change leads to a decrease in the overall concentration of the active ingredient in the plasma , with the amount of un@@ bound am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r that represents the active part , probably remains unchanged . &quot;
&quot; while the absolute concentration of un@@ bound am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r remains constant , the percentage of free active components during the dosing interval varies depending on the overall drug concentration in the Ste@@ ady State over the range of C@@ MA@@ x , ss to C@@ min , ss . &quot;
&quot; this is why pharmaceuticals that can in@@ duce or inhi@@ bit C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 must be administered with caution when given at the same time ( see sections 4.3 , 4.4 and 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; the gift of A@@ gener@@ a Cap@@ sules , either 20 mg / kg twice or 15 mg / kg three times daily , leads to a similar daily Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r exposure as in adults with a dosage of 1200 mg twice daily . &quot;
&quot; Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is 14 % less bio@@ compatible than the capsules ; therefore , A@@ gener@@ a solution and A@@ gen@@ ase capsules are not inter@@ changeable on a milli@@ gram basis . &quot;
&quot; also , the ren@@ al Clear@@ ance of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is neg@@ li@@ gible , so the effect of kidney function disorder should be low on the elimination of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
these treatment schemes lead to am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r plasma cutting comparable to those achieved in healthy volunteers after a dose of 1200 mg of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r twice a day without simultaneous administration of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
&quot; in long @-@ term studies on the car@@ cin@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r to mice and rats , aden@@ omas ben@@ ign hep@@ at@@ ome cellular aden@@ omas occurred with dos@@ ages , which correspon@@ ded to the 2.0 @-@ fold ( mice ) or 3,@@ 8@@ - fold ( rat ) exposure to humans , after twice daily administration of 1200 mg of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
the 21 underlying mechanism for the development of hep@@ at@@ oc@@ ell@@ ular aden@@ omas and car@@ cin@@ omas has not yet been elu@@ ci@@ dated and the relevance of these observed effects for man is uncle@@ ar .
&quot; however , little evidence of the assumption of a clinical relevance of these findings arose from the present exposure data on humans , both from clinical trials and therapeutic use . &quot;
&quot; in a standard battery of In @-@ vi@@ vo@@ - and In @-@ vitro @-@ Gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity tests , the bacterial reverse mut@@ ation tests ( Am@@ es @-@ Test ) , micro@@ kernel test of rats and chromos@@ om@@ al ab@@ err@@ ation test on human peripher@@ al lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes , am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r was neither mut@@ ually nor gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic . &quot;
&quot; this liver toxic@@ ity can be monitored and detected in the clinical routine by measuring AST , AL@@ T and the activity of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase . &quot;
&quot; until now , clinical trials have not observed significant liver toxic@@ ity in patients , neither during the administration of A@@ gener@@ a nor after the end of treatment . &quot;
studies on toxic@@ ity in young animals treated at an age of 4 days showed high mort@@ ality in both the control and the animals treated with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
&quot; however , a number of minor changes including thy@@ mus el@@ ong@@ ation and minor skel@@ etal alter@@ ations were observed , which indicate a delayed development . &quot;
&quot; 24 If A@@ gen@@ ase capsules are applied without the rein@@ forcing addi@@ tive of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( booster ) , higher doses of A@@ generation ( 1200 mg twice daily ) must be applied . &quot;
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ a Cap@@ sules is 20 mg of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs up to a daily dose of 2400 mg am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r which should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; the simultaneous application is to be treated with caution in patients with weak or light liver function distur@@ b@@ ance , in patients with severe liver dysfunction , it is contra@@ indicated ( see section 4.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; 26 For some medicines that can cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects , such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ arb@@ ital , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ de@@ press@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under supervision of the International Norm@@ alised R@@ atio ) , are available methods for determining the concentration of active ingredients . &quot;
A@@ gener@@ a should be removed in duration 27 when a r@@ ash of system@@ ic or allergic symptoms is accompanied or the mu@@ c@@ ous membran@@ es are involved ( see section 4.8 ) .
&quot; increased risk of li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy was associated with individual factors , such as higher age , and with drug addic@@ tive factors , such as a longer lasting anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and associated met@@ abolic disorders . &quot;
&quot; it was shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in caused a 82 % reduction in the AU@@ C of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , which can lead to a vi@@ rolog@@ ical failure and lead to resistance . &quot;
&quot; 508 % increases , however , reduced by 30 % for C@@ MA@@ x , when Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) is administered in combination with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) . &quot;
&quot; the C@@ min values of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in plasma , which were achieved twice a day with the combination of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) , are approximately 40 to 50 % lower than when Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) is administered twice daily in combination with 100 mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice a day . &quot;
&quot; dosage recommendation for simultaneous administration of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Kal@@ et@@ ra can not be given , but a close @-@ mes@@ hed surveillance is recommended as the efficacy and harm@@ lessness of this combination is not known . &quot;
the treatment with E@@ f@@ avi@@ r@@ enz in combination with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Sa@@ qu@@ in@@ avi@@ r is not recommended as the exposure of both prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors would lower .
&quot; if these medicines are applied together , caution is required ; a thorough clinical and vi@@ rolog@@ ical monitoring should be made , since a precise predic@@ ting of the effect of the combination of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on del@@ avi@@ r@@ din is difficult . &quot;
&quot; if it is necessary for clinical reasons to admini@@ ster Ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin along with A@@ gener@@ a , it is recommended to reduce the dosage of ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin at least half of the recommended dose 31 , although there are no clinical data . &quot;

&quot; while offering war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants together with A@@ gener@@ a , increased control of the IN@@ R ( International Norm@@ alised R@@ atio ) is recommended because of the possibility of weak@@ ening or rein@@ forcing the anti@@ thro@@ mb@@ otic effect ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
the simultaneous administration of Or@@ th@@ o @-@ Nov@@ um 1 / 35 ( 0.0@@ 35 mg E@@ thin@@ yl est@@ ol plus 1.0 mg of Nor@@ eth@@ ind@@ ron ) led to a decrease in AU@@ C and C@@ min by Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r by 22 % respectively .
&quot; during pregnancy , this medicine may only be applied after careful weighing of possible benefits for the mother compared to possible risks for the fet@@ us . &quot;
&quot; a reproduction study of pregnant rats , which was administered by the ni@@ st@@ ling in the uter@@ us to the end of the lac@@ tation period , showed a dimin@@ ished increase in weight in the seed . &quot;
A@@ gener@@ a &apos;s harm@@ lessness has been studied in adults and children from 4 years in controlled clinical studies in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs .
&quot; in case of over@@ dosage , the patient is to observe signs of an in@@ toxic@@ ation ( see Section 4.8 ) if necessary , necessary supporting measures . &quot;
&quot; the anti@@ viral activity of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in vitro against HIV @-@ 1 II@@ IB was examined both in acute and chronic lymp@@ ho@@ blas@@ tic cell lines ( MT @-@ 4 , CE@@ M @-@ C@@ CR@@ F , H@@ 9 ) and peripher@@ al blood lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes . &quot;
the 50 % hem@@ m@@ concentration ( IC@@ 50 ) of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r lies in the range of 0.0@@ 12 to 0.0@@ 08 µ@@ M for acute infected cells and amounts to 0.@@ 41 µ@@ M for chronic infected cells ( 1 µ@@ M = 0.@@ 50 µ@@ g / ml ) .
&quot; conver@@ sely , Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r reserves its activity against some other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors ; the preservation of this activity appears to be dependent on the number and type of resistance mut@@ ations in the isol@@ ates . &quot;
&quot; based on these data , treatment optimisation should be taken into account with PI pre @-@ treated children of the expected benefit of &quot; un@@ born &quot; A@@ gener@@ a . &quot;
&quot; while the absolute concentration of un@@ bound am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r remains constant , the percentage of free active components during the dosing interval varies depending on the overall drug concentration in the Ste@@ ady State over the range of C@@ MA@@ x , ss to C@@ min , ss . &quot;
&quot; this is why pharmaceuticals that can in@@ duce or inhi@@ bit C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 must be administered with caution when given at the same time ( see sections 4.3 , 4.4 and 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; also , the ren@@ al Clear@@ ance of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is neg@@ li@@ gible ; therefore , the effect of a kidney function disorder should be low on the elimination of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; in long @-@ term studies on the car@@ cin@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r to mice and rats , ben@@ ign hep@@ at@@ ome cellular aden@@ omas occurred with dos@@ ages , which correspon@@ ded to the 2.0 @-@ fold ( mice ) or 3,@@ 8@@ - fold ( rat ) exposure to humans after twice daily administration of 1200 mg of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
the underlying mechanism for the development of hep@@ at@@ oc@@ ell@@ ar aden@@ omas and car@@ cin@@ omas has not yet been elu@@ ci@@ dated and the relevance of these observed effects for man is uncle@@ ar .
&quot; however , there is little evidence for the adoption of a clinical relevance of these findings from the present exposure data on humans , both from clinical trials and therapeutic use . &quot;
&quot; in a standard battery of In @-@ vi@@ vo@@ - and In @-@ vitro @-@ Gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity tests , the bacterial reverse mut@@ ation tests ( Am@@ es @-@ Test ) , micro@@ kernel test of rats and chromos@@ om@@ al ab@@ err@@ ation test on human peripher@@ al lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes , Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r was neither mut@@ ually nor gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic . &quot;
studies on toxic@@ ity in young animals treated at an age of 4 days showed high mort@@ ality in both the control and the animals treated with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
&quot; these results suggest that in juven@@ ile the Met@@ abol@@ ism path@@ ways are not fully mature , so am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r or other critical components of the formulation ( z . &quot;
&quot; in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines for treating HIV @-@ 1 @-@ infected , prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors ( PI ) pre @-@ treated adults and children from 4 years are shown . &quot;
&quot; the benefit of patients with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r &quot; &quot; oo@@ ster@@ ols &quot; &quot; A@@ gener@@ a solution to intake was not occupied neither with PI pre @-@ treated patients nor with PI pre @-@ treated patients . &quot;
the bio@@ availability of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r as a solution to intake is 14 % lower than am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r as capsule ; therefore A@@ gener@@ a capsules and solution are not inter@@ changeable on a milli@@ gram per milli@@ gram basis ( see section 5.2 ) .
patients should as soon as they are able to swal@@ low the capsules before taking the solution to intake ( see section 4.4 ) .
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ a solution amounts to 17 mg ( 1.1 ml ) am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight three times a day in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs up to a daily dose of 2800 mg am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r which should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; additionally , since no dosage recommendation can be given for simultaneous application of A@@ gener@@ a solution to intake and low dos@@ ed Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , this combination can be avoided in these patient groups . &quot;
&quot; although a dose adaptation for am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is not considered necessary , an application of A@@ gener@@ a solution is contra@@ indicated in patients with ren@@ al failure ( see section 4.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; due to the potential risk of a toxic reaction as a result of the high propylene gly@@ col@@ o@@ ge@@ hal@@ ts , A@@ generic solution is contra@@ indicated in pregnant women , in patients with reduced liver function or liver failure and in patients with kidney failure . &quot;
simultaneous administration can lead to a competitive in@@ hibition of the metabol@@ isation of these drugs and possibly cause serious and / or life @-@ threatening side effects such as heart rhythm disorders ( z .
patients should be advised that A@@ gener@@ a or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy does not lead to a cure of HIV infection and that they continue to develop opportun@@ ist infections or other complications of HIV infection .
the current anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including treatment with A@@ gener@@ a does not prevent the risk of treating HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood .
&quot; for some medicines that can cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects , such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ arb@@ ital , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ de@@ press@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under supervision of the International Norm@@ alised R@@ atio ) , are available methods for determining the concentration of active ingredients . &quot;

based on data to 54 other C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors are expected significantly higher plasma concentrations of Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am after oral administration of Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am .
the potential risk for humans is not known . A@@ gener@@ a solution to intake may not be used during pregnancy due to possible toxic reactions of the fet@@ us to the included propylene gly@@ col ( see section 4.3 ) .

&quot; the application frequency and duration of treatment with Al@@ dar@@ a depend on the condition to be treated : • In case of small bas@@ al cell car@@ cin@@ omas , the cream is to apply five weeks weekly . &quot;
the cream is dil@@ uted before bed@@ time to apply dil@@ uted to the affected skin surfaces so that they remain sufficiently long ( about eight hours ) on the skin before it is washed off .
&quot; in all studies , Al@@ dar@@ a was compared to a plac@@ ebo ( the same cream , but without the active ingredient ) . • Al@@ dar@@ a was tested in four main studies of 9@@ 23 patients with war@@ ts in the genital area for 16 weeks . &quot;
• Al@@ dar@@ a was also examined in 7@@ 24 patients with small bas@@ al cell car@@ cin@@ oma in two studies where patients were treated for six weeks and Al@@ dar@@ a or plac@@ ebo had to be performed either a day or five times a week .
the main indicator of the efficacy was the number of patients with complete healing of the tum@@ ors after twelve weeks . • Al@@ dar@@ a was also tested in two studies of 505 patients with ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ oses .
&quot; • In all studies , Al@@ dar@@ a was more effective than plac@@ ebo . • The complete healing rate in all four main studies was 15 % up to 52 % in patients treated with plac@@ ebo . • The results of the two studies on bas@@ al cell car@@ cin@@ oma showed a complete healing rate of 66 % to 80 % in patients treated with Al@@ dar@@ a compared to 0 % to 3 % in the plac@@ ebo group . &quot;

treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream is so long to continue until all visible war@@ ts have disappeared in the genital or peripher@@ al area or up to a maximum of 16 weeks per treatment period .
an inter@@ ruption in the treatment process described above should be considered when intensive local inflammation reactions occur ( see section 4.4 ) or when an infection is observed in the treatment area .
&quot; if after the follow @-@ up examination 4 to 8 weeks after the second treatment period , the treated les@@ ions are only incomplete , another therapy should be started ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; if a dose was om@@ itted , the patient sol@@ ves the cream as soon as he / she notices it and then proceed with the usual therapy plan . &quot;
&quot; I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream is applied in a thin layer and rub@@ bed into the puri@@ fied , contaminated skin area until the cream is completely absorbed . &quot;
&quot; in these patients , it should take place between the benefits of treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od and the risk associated with a possible wor@@ sen@@ ing of their auto@@ immune disease . &quot;

&quot; with an application of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream in higher than one recommended doses , there is an increased risk of severe local irrit@@ ations ( see section 4.2 . ) In rare cases , severe local skin irrit@@ ations have been observed , which made a treatment necessary and / or caused by temporary physical imp@@ air@@ ment . &quot;
&quot; in cases where such reactions occurred at the exit of the ureth@@ ra , some women had difficulty passing urine , which necess@@ it@@ ated emergency cath@@ eter@@ isation and treatment of the affected area . &quot;

&quot; limited data point to an increased rate of inc@@ lin@@ ation reduc@@ tions in HIV positive patients , I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream has shown a lower effectiveness in this patient group with regard to elimin@@ ating the war@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; the treatment of the bas@@ al cell car@@ cin@@ oma with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od within 1 cm around the eyel@@ ids , nose , lips , or hair attachment has not been studied . &quot;
&quot; local skin reactions are frequent , but the intensity of these reactions decreases in general during therapy or the reactions form after completion of treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream . &quot;
&quot; if it is necessary due to the dis@@ comfort of the patient or due to the sever@@ ity of the local skin reactions , a treatment break can be made of several days . &quot;
the clinical result of the therapy may be assessed after the regeneration of the treated skin approximately 12 weeks after the end of the treatment .
&quot; since there are currently no data on long @-@ term healing rates of more than 36 months after the treatment , other suitable therapeutic forms should be considered in super@@ fi@@ zi@@ al bas@@ al cell car@@ cin@@ oma . &quot;
&quot; in patients with recur@@ rent and pre @-@ treated BC@@ Cs , there are no clinical experiences , so the application is not recommended in pre @-@ treated tum@@ ors . &quot;
data from an open clinical study point out that at large tum@@ ours ( &gt; 7.@@ 25 c@@ m2 ) there is a lower probability of response to I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od therapy .
&quot; I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od was not studied for the treatment of ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ oses on eyel@@ ids , inside the nose or the ears or on the lip area inside the lip . &quot;
there are only very limited data on the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od for the treatment of ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ oses in anatom@@ ical places outside the face and the scal@@ p .
&quot; the available data on the ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ ose on the for@@ ear@@ ms and hands support the effectiveness in this application , therefore such an application is not recommended . &quot;
&quot; local skin reactions frequently occur , but these reactions normally take in the course of therapy to intensity or go back after the treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream . &quot;
&quot; if the local skin reactions cause large dis@@ comfort to the patient or are very strong , treatment may be exposed for a few days . &quot;
&quot; from the data of an open clinical trial , patients with more than 8 active les@@ ions showed a lower total healing rate than patients with less than 8 les@@ ions . &quot;
&quot; due to the immune stimul@@ atory properties , I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream should be used with caution in patients receiving immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive treatment ( see 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; animal studies do not go directly or indirectly harmful effects on pregnancy , the embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , the withdrawal or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; although neither after one @-@ time nor after several top@@ ical top@@ ical application quanti@@ fiable ser@@ um levels ( &gt; 5@@ ng / ml ) have been reached , no recommendation can be applied during breast@@ feeding . &quot;
the most frequent contribut@@ ors and possibly or possibly with the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream related side effects in studies with three times weekly treatment were local reactions in the place of treatment of the treatment war@@ ts ( 33.@@ 7 % of patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od ) .
the most frequently reported and possibly likely or possibly with the application of the I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream related side effects include complaints at the application site with a frequency of 28.@@ 1 % .
the bas@@ ali@@ om patients treated by 185 with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream from a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled clinical study of Phase III reported side effects are shown below .
the most frequent occurrence as likely or possibly with the application of the I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream related side effects were in these studies a response to the application site ( 22 % of patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od ) .
the side effects obtained from 252 in plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled clinical trials of phase III with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream treated patients with acute ker@@ at@@ ose are listed below .
&quot; these plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled clinical studies with three @-@ week treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream frequently lead to local skin reactions including Er@@ y@@ thema ( 61 % ) , ero@@ sion ( 30 % ) , excav@@ ation / sc@@ aling ( 23 % ) and Ö@@ dem ( 14 % ) ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; the evaluation of clinical signs anticipated according to the test plan shows that in these studies with five times weekly treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream very often resulted in severe er@@ y@@ topics ( 31 % ) , severe ero@@ sions ( 13 % ) , and too heavy sh@@ red@@ ding and c@@ abling ( 19 % ) . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials to investigate the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od for the treatment of the ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ ato@@ sis , al@@ op@@ eci@@ a was determined with a frequency of 0.4 % ( 5 / 12@@ 14 ) at the treatment centre or in the surrounding area . &quot;
&quot; acci@@ dental unique oral acceptance of 200 mg of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od , which corresponds to the content of approximately 16 bags , could lead to nau@@ sea , v@@ om@@ iting , head@@ ache , my@@ al@@ gia and fever . &quot;
&quot; the clin@@ ically serious side effect , which occurred after several oral doses of &gt; 200 mg , consisted in hyp@@ ot@@ ony , norm@@ alized after oral or intra@@ ven@@ ous fluid . &quot;
&quot; in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic investigation , increasing system@@ ic concentrations of alpha @-@ interfer@@ ons and other cy@@ tok@@ ines were detected after the top@@ ical application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od . &quot;
&quot; in 3 pi@@ vot@@ al phase 3 efficacy studies , the efficacy in relation to complete curing of the appropri@@ ations in an I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od treatment is clearly superior over 16 weeks of plac@@ ebo treatment . &quot;
&quot; with 60 % of the total of 119 patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od , the inc@@ lin@@ ers healed completely ; this was the case with 20 % of the 105 patients treated with plac@@ ebo treated patients ( 95 % CI ) . &quot;
complete healing could be achieved at 23 % of 157 with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od treated male patients compared to 5 % of 161 with plac@@ ebo treated male patients ( 95 % CI :
the efficacy of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od in five @-@ time application per week for 6 weeks was examined in two double @-@ blind plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled clinical trials .
the target tum@@ ors were hist@@ ologically confirmed single primary super@@ fi@@ zi@@ al bas@@ al cell car@@ cin@@ omas with a minimum size of 0.5 c@@ m2 and a maximum diameter of 2 cm .
&quot; data from an open , un@@ controlled long @-@ term study after four years show that approximately 7@@ 9.3 % &#91; 95 % CI ( 7@@ 3.7 % , 8@@ 4.9 % ) &#93; of all treated patients were clin@@ ically cured and this remained for 48 months . &quot;
&quot; the efficacy of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od with three weeks of weekly application in one or two treatment periods of 4 weeks , interrupted by a four @-@ week treatment period , was examined in two double @-@ blind , plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled clinical studies . &quot;
&quot; patients had clin@@ ically typical , visible , dis@@ crete , non hyper@@ trop@@ hic , non hyper@@ trop@@ hic ac@@ ne les@@ ions within a related 25 c@@ m2 treatment area on the un@@ ha@@ iry scal@@ p or in the face . &quot;
the one @-@ year data from two combined observation studies show a recur@@ r@@ di@@ vari@@ ability of 27 % ( 35 / 128 patients ) for patients with clinical healing after one or two treatment periods .
&quot; the approved indications external war@@ ts , ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ ose and super@@ fi@@ zi@@ al bas@@ al cell car@@ cin@@ oma do not generally occur in pa@@ edi@@ atric patients and therefore were not examined . &quot;
&quot; Al@@ dar@@ a Cream was examined in four random@@ ized , double @-@ blind plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled studies of children aged 2 to 15 with M@@ oll@@ us@@ cum cont@@ agi@@ os@@ um ( I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od n = 576 , plac@@ ebo n = 313 ) . &quot;
the efficacy of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od could not be shown in these studies in the dos@@ ages examined there ( 3x / week for a period of ≤ 16 weeks ) .
a minimal system@@ ic absorption of the 5 % I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream through the skin of 58 patients with ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ ato@@ sis was observed in the three @-@ week weekly application during 16 weeks .
&quot; the highest drug concentrations in the ser@@ um at the end of the week 16 were observed between 9 and 12 hours and bet@@ ru@@ gen 0.1 , 0.2 and 1.6 ng / ml when applying in the face ( 12.5 m@@ g. , 1 bag ) , on the scal@@ p ( 25 mg , 2 bags ) and on the hands / arms ( 75 mg , 6 sach@@ ets ) . &quot;
the calculated half @-@ value time was approximately 10 times higher than the 2@@ hour half @-@ time period following the sub@@ cut@@ aneous application in an earlier study ; this indicates an extended retention of the drug in the skin .
the data for system@@ ic exposure showed that the res@@ or@@ ption of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od after top@@ ical application on MC @-@ dise@@ ased skin of patients aged 6 @-@ 12 was low and comparable to healthy adults and adults with ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ ose or super@@ fi@@ denti@@ al bas@@ al cell car@@ cin@@ oma .
&quot; in a four @-@ month study on the der@@ mal toxic@@ ity in the rat , doses of 0.5 and 2.5 mg / kg kg lead to significantly reduced body weight and increased mil@@ z weight ; a study conducted for the paint application also resulted in the mouse not similar effects . &quot;
a two @-@ year study on car@@ cin@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity in mice during the mal@@ er administration of three days a week induced no tum@@ ors at the application point .
&quot; the corresponding mechanism is not known , but since I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od has only a low system@@ ic absorption from the human skin and is not mut@@ ed , there is a risk for man due to the system@@ ic exposure to be very low . &quot;
&quot; the tum@@ ours occurred in the group of mice treated with the active cream , earlier and in greater numbers than in the control group with low U@@ VR . &quot;
&quot; it may harm other people , even if these same symptoms have as you . − If one of the listed side effects will significantly affect you or you notice side effects that are not stated in this use information , please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist . &quot;

Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me is used to treat patients with a diagnosis of a Mu@@ cop@@ ol@@ ys@@ ac@@ chari@@ do@@ sis I ( M@@ PS I ; α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase deficiency ) to treat the un@@ neurolog@@ ical manifest@@ ations of the disease ( symptoms that are not associated with brain or nerves ) .
&quot; this means that certain substances ( gly@@ cos@@ amin@@ og@@ ly@@ cans , g@@ ags ) are not degra@@ ded and thus accum@@ ulate in most organs in the body and damage them . &quot;
&quot; the following non @-@ neurolog@@ ical symptoms of M@@ PS I can occur : enlarged liver , sti@@ ff joints , the movements difficult , decreased lung volume , heart and eye diseases . &quot;
treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should be monitored by a doctor who has experience in the treatment of patients with M@@ PS I or other her@@ edit@@ ary met@@ abolic diseases .
&quot; the administration of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should take place in a hospital or clinic with re@@ vit@@ alisation devices , and patients may need appropriate medicines prior to the administration to prevent an allergic reaction . &quot;

&quot; the study was focused mainly on the safety of the drug , but it has also been measured by its effectiveness ( by analy@@ zing the effect regarding the reduction of the G@@ AG concentrations in the urine and in relation to the size of the liver ) . &quot;
&quot; in children under the age of five , Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me decreased the G@@ AG concentrations in the urine by about 60 % , and half of the treated children showed a normal large liver at the end of the study . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in patients aged over five years ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) are head@@ aches , nau@@ sea , abdominal pain , skin r@@ ash , ar@@ thro@@ path@@ y ( joint pain ) , heat sensation , fever and reactions to the in@@ fusion site . &quot;
&quot; very common side effects in patients under five years are elevated blood pressure , decreased oxygen satur@@ ation ( a measure of pul@@ mon@@ ary function ) , t@@ ach@@ y@@ kar@@ des ( accelerated heart rate ) , fever and ch@@ ills . &quot;
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me may not be used in patients who may be highly hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase or one of the other components ( an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ tic reaction ) .
&quot; each year , the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( EME@@ A ) will review all new information that may be known , and if necessary update this summary . &quot;
&quot; the manufacturer of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me will receive patients who receive al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , with regard to the reactions to in@@ fusion and the development of antibodies . &quot;
&quot; in June 2003 , the European Commission issued a permit for the company Gen@@ zy@@ me Europe B.V. to sell Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me to the entire European Union . &quot;
&quot; Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is a re@@ combin@@ ant form of human α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase and is produced using re@@ combin@@ ant DNA @-@ technology using CH@@ O @-@ mam@@ mal cell cultures ( Chinese ham@@ ster O@@ vary , eggs of Chinese ham@@ sters ) . &quot;
&quot; Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me is indicated for long @-@ term enzyme therapy in patients with a diagnosis of a Mu@@ cop@@ ol@@ ys@@ ac@@ chari@@ do@@ sis I ( M@@ PS I , α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase deficiency ) in order to treat the non @-@ neurolog@@ ical manifest@@ ations of the disease ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should take place by a doctor who has experience in the treatment of patients with M@@ PS I or other her@@ edit@@ ary met@@ abolic diseases .
the initial in@@ fusion rate of 2 E / kg / h can be increased if the patient helps to increase every 15 minutes in single steps to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h .
the safety and efficacy of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in adults over 65 years has not been identified and for these patients no dosing schedule can be recommended .
&quot; the safety and efficacy of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in patients with kidney or liver failure has not been identified , and no dosing schedule is recommended for these patients . &quot;
patients treated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me can develop in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions which are defined as any side effect occurring during in@@ fusion or until the end of the in@@ fusion day ( see section 4.8 ) .
&quot; for this reason , especially those patients should continue to be closely monitored and the in@@ fusion of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should only be carried out in an appropriate clinical environment , in which re@@ bel facilities are available for medical emer@@ gen@@ cies . &quot;
&quot; due to the clinical phase 3 study , nearly all patients are Ig@@ G antibodies against lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase , usually within 3 months from the start of treatment . &quot;
patients who develop antibodies or symptoms of an in@@ fusion @-@ related reaction must be treated with caution when applying Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me ( see section 4.3 and 4.8 ) .
&quot; because there is little experience regarding res@@ ump@@ tion of treatment after prolonged inter@@ ruption , due to the theore@@ tically increased risk of a hyper@@ sensitivity reaction after an inter@@ ruption of the treatment has to be cau@@ tious . &quot;
treat 60 minutes before the beginning of in@@ fusion with medication ( anti@@ hi@@ stam@@ ines and / or anti@@ py@@ re@@ tika ) to minim@@ ise potential in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions .
&quot; in case of a slight or moderate in@@ fusion @-@ related reaction , the treatment with anti@@ hi@@ stam@@ ines and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen should be weigh@@ ed and / or a reduction of in@@ fusion rate to half of the in@@ fusion rate in which the reaction occurred . &quot;
&quot; in case of a single , severe in@@ fusion @-@ related reaction the in@@ fusion must be stopped until the symptoms are reduced , a treatment with anti@@ hi@@ stam@@ ines and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen is to consider . &quot;
in@@ fusion can be res@@ um@@ ed back with a reduction of in@@ fusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the in@@ fusion rate in which the reaction occurred .
3 ( anti@@ hi@@ stam@@ ines and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen und / or cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ o@@ ids ) as well as a reduction of in@@ fusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the in@@ fusion rate in which the preceding reaction occurred .
&quot; Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should not be applied simultaneously with chlor@@ o@@ qu@@ ine or Proc@@ ine , because a potential risk of interference with the in@@ trac@@ ell@@ ular intake of lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase exists . &quot;
&quot; experimental studies do not result in direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth and post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; since no data of new@@ bor@@ ns , which were exposed to lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase over the mother &apos;s milk , is recommended to not satisfy even during treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me . &quot;
&quot; the adverse events in clinical studies were mainly classified as in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions , which were observed in 53 % of patients in the phase 3 study ( treatment duration up to 4 years ) and 35 % of patients in the study involving participants under 5 years ( treatment duration up to 1 year ) . &quot;
adverse drug reactions in connection with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me observed during the Phase 3 study and their pro@@ long@@ ation in a total of 45 patients aged 5 years or older during a treatment duration of up to 4 years are frequently performed ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) .
&quot; in some patients with severe M@@ PS @-@ I @-@ related involvement of the upper respiratory tract and lungs in the pre@@ history , severe reactions , including bron@@ ch@@ os@@ pas@@ mus , breathing still@@ stand and facial oils ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; children unwanted drug interactions in connection with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , which were reported during a Ph@@ as@@ e- 2 study with a total of 20 patients at the age of 5 , with mainly severe trial form and a treatment duration up to 12 months , reported are listed in the table . &quot;
&quot; 100 E / kg intra@@ ven@@ ously once a week ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intra@@ ven@@ ously once a week , 200 E / kg intra@@ ven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intra@@ ven@@ ously every 2 weeks . &quot;
&quot; most patients had a ser@@ o@@ con@@ version within 3 months after the treatment was started , with a severe delay in patients aged less than 5 years ( average after 26 days over 45 days in patients aged 5 and older ) . &quot;
&quot; until the end of the Phase 3 study ( or up to a premature departure from the study ) , 13 / 45 patients had no det@@ ectable antibody responses ( RI@@ P ) ass@@ ay det@@ ectable antibodies , including 3 patients with whom it never came to Ser@@ o@@ kon@@ trial . &quot;
&quot; patients with low to low antibody levels showed a robust reduction of the G@@ AG spi@@ eg@@ els in the urine , while patients with high antibody ti@@ ters showed a variable reduction of G@@ AG in the urine . &quot;
four patients ( three in phase 3 study and one in phase 2 study ) showed a mar@@ ginal to low neutr@@ alizing inhibit@@ ory effect on enzy@@ matic lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase activity in vitro that did not affect clinical efficacy and / or reducing G@@ AG in urine .
&quot; the presence of antibodies did not seem to be associated with the incidence of unwanted drug reactions , although the occurrence of undes@@ irable drug reactions typically coinci@@ ded with the formation of Ig@@ G antibodies . &quot;
&quot; for the hydro@@ ly@@ sis of the accumulated sub@@ strate and preventing further accumulation of enzyme activity , the reason@@ ing for the enc@@ ap@@ sul@@ ated sub@@ strate and the prevention of further accumulation is sufficient . &quot;
&quot; after intra@@ ven@@ ous in@@ fusion , lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is quickly removed from the circulation and absorbed by cells into the ly@@ s@@ os@@ omes , most likely via Mann@@ ose @-@ 6 @-@ Phosph@@ ate recept@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; the safety and efficacy of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me were examined in a random@@ ised , double @-@ blind , plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled Phase 3 study to 45 patients aged 6 to 43 . &quot;
&quot; although patients were recru@@ ited for the study , which showed the entire disease spectrum , the majority of patients were from the mean phen@@ otype and only one patient showed the severe phen@@ otype . &quot;
patients were recru@@ ited if they had a forced exp@@ ir@@ atory volume ( FE@@ V ) of less than 80 % of the expected value and they had to be able to stand 6 minutes and go 5 meters .
the primary end@@ points for the effectiveness were the percentage change of the FE@@ V to be expected and the absolute distance in the 6 @-@ minute drive .
&quot; all patients were subsequently recru@@ ited for an open @-@ label extension study , where they received another 3.5 years ( 182 weeks ) each week 100 E / kg Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me . &quot;
&quot; after 26 weeks of therapy , patients treated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me compared to the plac@@ ebo group improved lung function and the en@@ vi@@ ability shown in the following table . &quot;
the open renewal study showed an improvement and / or maintenance of these effects of up to 208 weeks in the Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group and 182 weeks in the plac@@ ebo / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group as shown in the following table .
the decrease of the expected percentage FE@@ V is clin@@ ically not significant over this period and the absolute pul@@ mon@@ ary volume increased further proportional to the height of the children .
&quot; of the 26 patients with a hep@@ atom@@ eg@@ aly before treatment , 22 ( 85 % ) reached a normal liver size until the end of the study . &quot;
&quot; within the first 4 weeks , a clear waste of the G@@ AG mirror was found in the urine ( µ@@ g / mg of Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in ) that remained constant until the end of the study . &quot;
&quot; in terms of hetero@@ geneous disease manifest@@ ations between the patients that were taken into account by using a combined end@@ point , the clin@@ ically significant changes of the shoulder joint ( 58 % ) , no change in 10 patients ( 22 % ) and a deteri@@ oration in 9 patients ( 20 % ) . &quot;
a one @-@ year open phase 2 study was conducted in which the safety and pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me were examined for 20 patients at the time of their inclusion in the study under 5 years of age ( 16 patients with severe progression @-@ form and 4 with middle course form ) .
&quot; in four patients , the dosage was increased to 200 E / kg due to increased G@@ ag@@ - mirror in the urine in week 22 in the last 26 weeks . &quot;
&quot; in several patients a size growth ( n = 7 ) and a weight gain ( n = 3 ) showed a normal mental development speed for this age group ( &lt; 2,5 years ) and all 4 patients with the middle course form showed a normal mental development speed , whereas in older patients with severe progression , only limited or no progress in cognitive development was observed . &quot;
&quot; in a phase 4 study , studies on pharmac@@ o@@ dynamic effects of various al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me dosage schemes were carried out on the G@@ AG mirror in the urine , the liver volume and the 6 @-@ minute walk test . &quot;
&quot; 100 E / kg intra@@ ven@@ ously once a week ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intra@@ ven@@ ously once a week , 200 E / kg intra@@ ven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intra@@ ven@@ ously every 2 weeks . &quot;
&quot; the dosing schedule with 200 E / kg intra@@ ven@@ ously every 2 weeks can represent a reasonable alternative in patients who have difficulties with weekly in@@ fusion , but it is not proven that the long @-@ term clinical efficacy of these two dosage schemes is equal . &quot;
&quot; the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( EME@@ A ) will evaluate any new information available annually , and if necessary , the summary of the features of the drug will be updated . &quot;
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic profile in patients aged under 5 was similar to patients suffering from older and less severely affected patients .

&quot; within the given period , the holder of the permit for placing on the market has to complete the following degree program whose results are the basis for the annual evaluation report for the benefit @-@ risk ratio . &quot;
&quot; this register will include long @-@ term safety and efficacy information for patients treated with al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , as well as data on the natural progression of the disease in patients without this treatment . &quot;
&quot; in patients suffering from M@@ PS I , there is an enzyme called α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase , which spl@@ its certain substances in the body ( gly@@ cos@@ amin@@ og@@ ly@@ kan@@ e ) , either in a small amount before or this enzyme is missing completely . &quot;
if you are allergic to one of the components of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me or if you have a severe allergic reaction to lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase .
an in@@ fusion @-@ related reaction is any side effect occurring during in@@ fusion or until the end of the in@@ fusion day ( see section 4 &quot; What side effects are possible &quot; ) .
&quot; when using Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me with other medicines , please inform your doctor if you take medicines that contain Chlor@@ o@@ qu@@ ine or Proc@@ ain because a possible risk of a dimin@@ ished effect of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me . &quot;
&quot; please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you take other medicines or have recently taken , including non prescription drugs . &quot;
hint for handling - di@@ lution and application The concentrate for the production of an in@@ fusion fluid has to be dil@@ uted prior to application and is provided for intra@@ ven@@ ous application ( see information for doctors or medical personnel ) .
the initial in@@ fusion rate of 2 E / kg / h can be increased if the patient carries it up to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h every 15 minutes .
&quot; in some patients with severe M@@ PS @-@ I@@ - un@@ conditional participation of the upper respiratory tract and lungs in the pre@@ history , however , severe reactions occurred , including bron@@ ch@@ os@@ pas@@ mus , breathing still@@ stand and facial oils . &quot;

preparation of the Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in@@ fusion ( using as@@ ep@@ tic technique ) • to determine the number of di@@ lu@@ ent pier@@ cing bottles after body weight of the individual patient .
&quot; A@@ lim@@ ta is used together with cis@@ pl@@ atin ( another medicine against cancer ) in patients who are not res@@ et@@ able ( medicines for cancer ) , and &quot; mal@@ ign@@ ant &quot; ( cancer against cancer ) has already spread to other parts of the body . • advanced or metastatic &quot; non @-@ small &quot; lung cancer , which does not attack the epithel@@ ial cells . &quot;
&quot; A@@ lim@@ ta is used for patients who have not yet been treated before , in combination with cis@@ pl@@ atin and in patients who previously received other chemotherapy regim@@ ens than any therapy . &quot;
&quot; to reduce side effects , patients should take a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid and foli@@ c acid ( vitamin ) during treatment with A@@ lim@@ ta and inj@@ ections of vitamin B@@ 12 . &quot;
&quot; if A@@ lim@@ ta is administered together with cis@@ pl@@ atin , before or after the administration of cis@@ pl@@ atin , a &quot; anti@@ em@@ e@@ tikum &quot; ( medicines for v@@ om@@ iting ) and liquids ( to prevent liquid deficiency ) should be given . &quot;
&quot; in patients whose blood pattern changes or where certain other side effects occur , the treatment should be postpon@@ ed , removed or reduce the dose . &quot;
the active form of p@@ emet@@ ric x@@ ed thus slow@@ s down the formation of DNA and RNA and prevents the cells to divide .
&quot; the conversion of p@@ emet@@ ric x@@ ed into its active form is easier to equi@@ p in cancer cells than in healthy cells , which leads to higher concentrations of the active form of the medicine and a longer lifetime in cancer cells . &quot;
&quot; for the treatment of the mal@@ ign@@ ant ple@@ ur@@ am@@ es@@ othel@@ i@@ oma , A@@ lim@@ ta was examined in a major study of 456 patients who had previously received chemotherapy against their disease . &quot;
&quot; in the treatment of non @-@ small cell lung cancer , the effects of A@@ lim@@ ta were compared to 5@@ 71 patients with local advanced or metastatic disease , which had previously been treated with chemotherapy with the effects of doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el ( another medicine against cancer ) . &quot;
&quot; A@@ lim@@ ta was also compared with gem@@ cit@@ ab@@ ine ( another medicine against cancer ) , both in combination with cis@@ pl@@ atin in a study to 1 7@@ 25 patients who previously had not received chemotherapy for lung cancer . &quot;
&quot; patients treated with A@@ lim@@ ta and cis@@ pl@@ atin survived at an average of 12.@@ 1 months , compared to 9.3 months at the sole administration of cis@@ pl@@ atin . &quot;
patients who had previously received chemotherapy were the average survival time with A@@ lim@@ ta 8.3 months compared to 7.9 months with doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el .
&quot; in both studies , however , patients in which cancer did not attack the epithel@@ ial cells during which A@@ lim@@ ta administered longer survival times than with the comparative medicine . &quot;
&quot; in September 2004 , the European Commission issued a permit for the company Eli Lil@@ ly Neder@@ land B.V. to permit asylum in the whole European Union . &quot;
each pier@@ ced bottle has to be dissolved with 4.2 ml 0.9 % sodium chlori@@ de injection ( 9 mg / ml ) resulting in a solution of 25 mg / ml .
the corresponding volume of the necessary dosage is taken from the pier@@ ced bottle and dil@@ uted with 0.9 % sodium chlori@@ de injection ( 9 mg / ml ) to 100 ml ( see section 6.6 ) .
AL@@ IM@@ TA is shown in combination with cis@@ pl@@ atin for first @-@ line treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic non @-@ small bron@@ chi@@ al car@@ cin@@ oma ( see section 5.1 ) .
AL@@ IM@@ TA in mon@@ otherapy is indicated for treatment in second @-@ line treatment of patients with melan@@ chol@@ y advanced or metastatic non @-@ small bron@@ chi@@ al car@@ cin@@ oma ( see section 5.1 ) .
the recommended dose of AL@@ IM@@ TA 500 mg / m ² of body surface ( KO@@ F ) is administered as intra@@ ven@@ ous in@@ fusion for a period of 10 minutes on the first day of every 21 day treatment cycle .
the recommended dose of cis@@ pl@@ atin is 75 mg / m ² KO@@ F as in@@ fusion over a period of 2 hours about 30 minutes after completion of the P@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed@@ - in@@ fusion on the first day every 21 day treatment cycle .
&quot; in patients with non @-@ small bron@@ chi@@ al car@@ cin@@ oma after previous chemotherapy , the recommended dose of AL@@ IM@@ TA 500 mg / m ² KO@@ F is administered as intra@@ ven@@ ous in@@ fusion for a period of 10 minutes on the first day of every 21 day treatment cycle . &quot;
&quot; to reduce the frequency and sever@@ ity of skin reactions , a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ o@@ id must be given on the day before and on the day after the treatment . &quot;
&quot; during the seven days before the first dose of P@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed , at least 5 doses of foli@@ c acid must be taken and the intake must be continued throughout the therapy period and for another 21 days after the last P@@ em@@ etry dose . &quot;
patients must also receive an in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular injection of vitamin B@@ 12 ( 1000 micro@@ grams ) during the week before the first P@@ em@@ etry dose and after each third beam handling cycle .
&quot; in patients receiving tel@@ em@@ etry , a complete blood @-@ image should be created before each gift , including a differentiation of leu@@ co@@ cy@@ tes and a thro@@ m@@ bo@@ cy@@ te count . &quot;
&quot; alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase ( AP ) , as@@ part@@ at trans@@ amin@@ ase ( AST or S@@ GO@@ T ) and Alan@@ in @-@ Trans@@ amin@@ ase ( AL@@ T or SG@@ PT ) should be ≤ 3 times the upper limit value . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of a new treatment cycle , a dose @-@ examination must take place under consideration of the N@@ adi@@ r &apos;s blood balance or the maximum non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity of the predic@@ tive therapy cycles . &quot;
&quot; after recovery , patients need to be treated according to the indications in tables 1 , 2 and 3 , which are applied to AL@@ IM@@ TA as mon@@ otherapy or in combination with cis@@ pl@@ atin . &quot;
these criteria correspond to the definition of National Cancer Institute Common Tox@@ ic@@ ity C@@ rit@@ eria ( C@@ TC v@@ 2.0 ; N@@ CI 1998 ) ≥ C@@ TC Grad 2 Blut@@ ung .
&quot; should patients not develop hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity ≥ grade 3 ( except neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity ) , the therapy must be interrupted with AL@@ IM@@ TA until the patient has the value prior to treatment &quot;
treatment with AL@@ IM@@ TA must be canc@@ eled if in patients after 2 doses of dose a hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity or non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity degree 3 or 4 occurs or so@@ - on the occurrence of degree 3 or 4 neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity .
&quot; clinical trials have no indication that in patients aged 65 years old , or in comparison to patients aged 65 years , there is an increased side effect ris@@ i@@ - ko . &quot;
AL@@ IM@@ TA is not recommended for use in children under 18 years of age due to insufficient data relating to harm@@ lessness and efficacy .
in clinical trials patients with a cre@@ atine Clear@@ ance of ≥ 45 ml / min have no dose adjustments that go beyond the dose adjustments that are recommended for all patients .
the data situation in patients with a cre@@ atine Clear@@ ance of less than 45 ml / min was not sufficient ; therefore the application is not recommended ( see section 4.4 ) .
&quot; however , patients with liver function restriction of &gt; the 1.5 @-@ fold of the upper limit value and / or trans@@ am@@ inas@@ en@@ values of &gt; the 3.0 @-@ fold of the upper limit value ( in abor@@ tion of liver metast@@ ases ) or &gt; 5,0 @-@ fold of the upper limit value ( in the presence of liver metast@@ ases ) were not specifically studied in the studies . &quot;
patients must be monitored in terms of bone @-@ marking supp@@ ression and P@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed must not be administered to patients before their absolute neutr@@ ality rate has reached a value of ≥ 1500 cells / mm ³ and the thro@@ m@@ bo@@ cy@@ tic value again a value of ≥ 100,000 cells / mm ³ . &quot;
&quot; dose reduction for further cycles is based on the N@@ adi@@ r of absolute neutr@@ ality , thro@@ m@@ bo@@ cy@@ tic value and maximum non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity , as observed in previous treatment cycles ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; a lower toxic@@ ity and a reduction in grade 3 / 4 hem@@ at@@ ologic and ni@@ chth@@ on@@ ous toxic@@ ity such as neut@@ ro@@ pen@@ ie , f@@ eb@@ r@@ ile neut@@ ro@@ pen@@ ie and infection with grade 3 / 4 neut@@ ro@@ pen@@ ie was observed if a pre @-@ treatment with foli@@ c acid and vitamin B@@ 12 had taken place . &quot;
&quot; therefore , all patients treated with tel@@ em@@ etry must be dependent on foli@@ c acid and vitamin B@@ 12 as proph@@ yl@@ actic measures to reduce treatment @-@ related toxic@@ ity ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot;
patients with mild to medium kidney in@@ suffici@@ ency ( cre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance 45 to 79 ml / min ) must avoid simultaneous use of non@@ ster@@ o@@ idal anti@@ ph@@ log@@ is@@ tika ( &gt; 1.3 g daily ) for at least 2 days before the therapy and at least 2 days after therapy with P@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed ( see section 4.5 ) .
&quot; all patients , for which a therapy with p@@ emet@@ ric x@@ ed is provided , must avoid taking N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds with a long half @-@ value for at least 5 days prior to therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after therapy with p@@ emet@@ ric x@@ ed ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; many patients in which these events occurred , had appropriate risk factors for the occurrence of ren@@ al events , including de@@ hydr@@ ation , pre @-@ existing hyper@@ tension or diabetes . &quot;
&quot; therefore , in patients with clin@@ ically significant fluid accumulation in the trans@@ cellular space , a drainage of the ergometer in front of the tel@@ em@@ etry treatment should be considered . &quot;
&quot; 5 Major kar@@ di@@ ov@@ as@@ cul@@ ars , including m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction , and cer@@ eb@@ rov@@ ascular events were occasionally reported in clinical trials with p@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed occasionally , if this ingredient is usually administered in combination with another cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic substance . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , the simultaneous application of atten@@ u@@ ated life @-@ vacc@@ ines ( except yellow fever , this vacc@@ ination is contra@@ indicated ) is not recommended ( see section 4.3 and 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; since the possibility of ir@@ reversible harm to reproductive capacity is made by p@@ emet@@ ric x@@ ed , men should be advised in front of the treatment centre to obtain advice regarding the locking of semen . &quot;
&quot; in patients with normal kidney function ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance ≥ 80 ml / min ) , high doses of non @-@ ster@@ oid anti@@ ph@@ log@@ is@@ tika ( N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds , such as i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen &gt; 1600 mg / day ) and acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid in high doses ( ≥ 1,3 g per day ) can lead to a reduced breakdown of side effects with the result of increased occurrence of side effects . &quot;
&quot; therefore caution is advisable , if in patients with normal kidney function ( cre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance ≥ 80 ml / min ) high doses of N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds or acet@@ yl sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid can be applied in high doses . &quot;
&quot; I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen or acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ yl@@ - acid in high doses should be avoided for at least 2 days prior to therapy , on the day of therapy and mind@@ es- at least 2 days after therapy with p@@ emet@@ ric x@@ ed ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; since no data is available in terms of interaction with N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds with long half @-@ value such as Pi@@ ro@@ - x@@ ic@@ am or Ro@@ f@@ ec@@ oxi@@ b , the simultaneous application with p@@ emet@@ ric x@@ ed must be avoided at least 5 days prior to therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after therapy with p@@ emet@@ ric x@@ ed . &quot;
the great in@@ tra @-@ individual vari@@ ability of co@@ ag@@ ulation status during the disease and the possibility of interactions between oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants and ant@@ ine@@ oplas@@ tic chemotherapy requires an increased monitoring frequency of IN@@ R ( International Norm@@ alised R@@ atio ) when the decision was made to treat the patient with oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants .
&quot; there are no data for the use of p@@ emet@@ ric acid in pregnant women , but as with an@@ de@@ - ren an@@ tim@@ etab@@ ol@@ ite , severe birth defects are expected in the pregnancy . &quot;
&quot; p@@ em@@ etry should not be applied during pregnancy , except if strictly - demanding and after careful weighing of the benefit for the mother and the risk for the fet@@ us ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; since the possibility of ir@@ reversible damage to reproductive capacity is made by p@@ emet@@ ric x@@ ed , men should be advised before the treatment start to obtain advice regarding the sperm count . &quot;
it is not known whether P@@ em@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed passes into the mother &apos;s milk and unwanted effects in the Asc@@ ended sa@@ wing cannot be ruled out .
the following table shows the incidence and sever@@ ity of undes@@ irable effects reported in &gt; 5 % of 168 patients with mes@@ othel@@ i@@ oma and the random@@ ized cis@@ pl@@ atin and P@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed and 163 patients with mes@@ othel@@ i@@ oma who were random@@ ised cis@@ pl@@ atin as mon@@ otherapy .

&quot; the clin@@ ically relevant laboratory toxic@@ ity degree 3 and 4 was similar to the results of three single tel@@ em@@ etry studies ( n = 164 ) of phase 2 similar to the Phase 3 phase @-@ phase mon@@ other@@ api@@ ds , except neut@@ ro@@ pen@@ ie ( 12.@@ 8 % compared to 5.3 % ) and an increase of the Alan@@ ine trans@@ amin@@ ase ( 15.@@ 2 % compared to 1.9 % ) . &quot;
&quot; these differences are likely to lead to differences in the patient population , since the P@@ ha@@ - se 2 studies include both chem@@ on@@ ai@@ ve and clearly pre @-@ treated breast cancer patients with existing liver metast@@ ases and / or ab@@ normal starting values of liver function tests . &quot;

AL@@ IM@@ TA ( P@@ em@@ y@@ em@@ x@@ ed ) is an anti@@ bacterial anti @-@ fol@@ ate that performs its effect by inter@@ rup@@ ting important consequ@@ ential consequ@@ ential met@@ abolic processes necessary for cell rep@@ lication .
in vitro studies showed that P@@ em@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed acts as anti @-@ fol@@ ate with several attacks by blocking the thy@@ mi@@ dy@@ lat@@ syn@@ th@@ ase ( TS ) and gly@@ cin@@ am@@ i@@ dri@@ bon@@ u@@ cle@@ ot@@ id@@ for@@ - m@@ yl@@ transfer@@ ase ( GAR@@ FT ) that are fol@@ ate @-@ dependent key enzymes from the de nov@@ o Bios@@ yn@@ thesis of thy@@ mid@@ - and pur@@ inn@@ u@@ cle@@ oti@@ ds .
&quot; EMP@@ H@@ AC@@ IS , a multi @-@ centric , random@@ ised , easy @-@ blind phase 3 study of AL@@ IM@@ TA plus cis@@ pl@@ atin against cis@@ pl@@ atin in chem@@ on@@ ai@@ ven patients with mal@@ ign@@ ant ple@@ ur@@ am@@ es@@ othel@@ i@@ oma showed that patients with AL@@ IM@@ TA and cis@@ pl@@ atin have had prolonged survival compared to those patients who were only st@@ acked with cis@@ pl@@ atin . &quot;
the primary analysis of this study was performed in the population of all patients receiving investig@@ ational medications ( random@@ ised and treated ) in the treatment arm .
a statisti@@ cally significant improvement of clin@@ ically relevant symptoms ( pain and dy@@ sp@@ nea ) in connection with the mal@@ ign@@ ant ple@@ ur@@ am@@ es@@ othel@@ i@@ om was shown in the AL@@ IM@@ TA / Cis@@ pl@@ atin @-@ arm ( 212 patients ) compared to the common cis@@ pl@@ a tin @-@ arm ( 218 patients ) .
the differences between the two arms were improved by improving the lung function parameters in AL@@ IM@@ TA / Cis@@ pl@@ atin arm and a deteri@@ oration of lung function over time in the controller .
&quot; a multi @-@ centric , random@@ ised , open phase III study with AL@@ IM@@ TA against doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el in patients with locally advanced or metastatic N@@ SC@@ LC in patients treated with AL@@ IM@@ TA ( Int@@ ent to treat Pop@@ ulation n = 283 ) and 7,@@ 9 months with doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el treated patients ( IT@@ T n = 288 ) . &quot;
&quot; an analysis of the impact of hist@@ ology on the overall survival fell to favour of AL@@ IM@@ TA in patients with N@@ SC@@ LC with a predominantly non @-@ plate epi@@ th@@ eli@@ alen hist@@ ological type ( n = 172 , 6.2 versus 8.0 months , adjusted HR = 0.@@ 78 ; 95 % CI = 1,@@ 08 @-@ 2,@@ 26 , p = 0.0@@ 18 ) . &quot;
limited data of a separately random@@ ized controlled Phase 3 study show that efficacy data ( survival and progression @-@ free survival ) for p@@ emet@@ ric x@@ ed between patients with ( n = 41 ) and without ( n = 540 ) pre @-@ treatment are similar to doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el .
the efficacy analyses of P@@ Q Pop@@ ulation are consistent with IT@@ T Pop@@ ulation Analy@@ ses and support the non @-@ superi@@ ority of AL@@ IM@@ TA Cis@@ pl@@ atin combination compared to gem@@ cit@@ ab@@ ine cis@@ pl@@ atin combination .

&quot; the analysis of the impact of N@@ SC@@ LC Hist@@ ology on survival showed clin@@ ically relevant differences according to hist@@ ology , see the table below . &quot;
CI = Con@@ fi@@ dence interval ; IT@@ T = intent @-@ to @-@ treat ; N = Size of the total population a statisti@@ cally significant for non @-@ security with a total contrast interval for HR ( = Haz@@ ard ratio ) clearly below the non @-@ submission limit of 1.@@ 17@@ 645 ( p &lt; 0.0@@ 01 ) .
&quot; patients treated with AL@@ IM@@ TA and cis@@ pl@@ atin require less trans@@ fu@@ sions ( 16.@@ 4 % versus 28.@@ 9 % , p &lt; 0.0@@ 01 ) , er@@ y@@ thro@@ cy@@ t@@ transfer@@ s@@ fu@@ sions ( 1.8 % versus 4.5 % , p = 0.0@@ 002 ) . &quot;

the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of P@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed after gift as a mon@@ otherapeu@@ tic agent were examined for 426 cancer patients with various solid tum@@ ors in doses of 0.2 to 8@@ 38 mg / m ² in in@@ fu@@ si@@ - ones for a period of 10 minutes .
tel@@ em@@ etry is mainly ex@@ cre@@ ted in the urine and 70 % to 90 % of the administered dose will remain unchanged in the urine from 24 hours after application .
&quot; P@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed has a total capacity of 9@@ 1,8 ml / min and half @-@ time in plasma is 3.5 hours in patients with normal kidney disease ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance 90 ml / min ) . &quot;

&quot; the resulting solution is clear and the col@@ oring ranges from colour@@ less to yellow or green@@ ish yellow , without affecting the quality of the sample . &quot;
&quot; it is used for over@@ weight adults with a body mass index ( Body Mass Index - BM@@ I ) of ≥ 28 kg per square meter in combination with low cal@@ orie , fat @-@ induced nutrition . &quot;
patients who are taking All@@ i and no weight loss after 12 weeks should contact their doctor or pharmac@@ ist .
&quot; if these enzymes are inhi@@ bited , they can &apos;t dis@@ assemble some fats in the food , resulting in about a quarter of the fats led by food di@@ gest@@ ed the intest@@ ines . &quot;
&quot; in a third study , All@@ i was compared to 391 over@@ weight patients with a BM@@ I between 25 and 28 kg / m2 with plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in the two studies in patients with a BM@@ I of ≥ 28 kg / m2 had patients who recorded All@@ i 60 mg , after one year , recorded an average weight loss of 4.8 kg , compared to 2.3 kg when taking plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in the study with All@@ i in patients with a BM@@ I between 25 and 28 kg / m2 , no weight loss could be observed in patients with relevant weight loss . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of All@@ i ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) are o@@ ily spots on after , fl@@ atus ( win@@ ch ) with stu@@ d@@ lab@@ y , stu@@ d strand , o@@ ily / o@@ ily stool , ab@@ duct ö@@ ligen secre@@ tion ( drums ) , flat@@ ul@@ ence ( wind ) and soft stools . &quot;
it must not be applied to patients who are treated with c@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( to prevent organ rejection in transplan@@ tation patients ) or with medicines such as war@@ far@@ in to prevent blood cl@@ ots .
&quot; it may also not be applied to patients suffering from a long @-@ term mal@@ absorption syndrome ( in which not enough nutrients are absorbed from the diges@@ tive tract ) or to chol@@ est@@ ase ( liver disease ) , and in pregnant women or in breast@@ feeding mothers . &quot;
&quot; in July 2007 , the European Commission granted the Company G@@ lax@@ o Group Limited a permit for placing Or@@ list@@ at G@@ SK in the entire European Union . &quot;
&quot; all@@ i is indicated for weight reduction of adults with over@@ weight ( Body @-@ Mass @-@ Index BM@@ I ≥ 28 kg / m2 ) , and should be used in conjunction with a slightly hypo@@ critical , fat @-@ induced nutrition . &quot;
&quot; all@@ i must not be applied by children and adol@@ escents under 18 , since there is not enough data for efficacy and safety . &quot;
&quot; however , since Or@@ list@@ at is only minim@@ ally res@@ or@@ ated , the dosage is necessary for elderly and patients with reduced liver and / or kidney function . &quot;
• hyper@@ sensitivity to the active substance or any of the other components • Pre@@ mature treatment with C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( see section 4.5 ) • Chronic Lyme absorption syndrome • chol@@ est@@ ase • pregnancy ( see section 4.6 ) • Pre@@ mature treatment with war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants ( see section 4.5 and 4.8 )
the probability of occurrence g@@ astro@@ intestinal symptoms ( see section 4.8 ) may increase when all@@ i is taken together with a fat @-@ rich individual meal or o@@ bes@@ e nutrition .
&quot; because the weight reduction in diabetes can be accompanied with improved met@@ abolic control , patients who take a medicine against diabetes should consult a doctor or pharmac@@ ist before starting a therapy with all@@ i , because the dosage of the anti@@ di@@ ab@@ etic should be adjusted . &quot;
patients who use all@@ i as well as medicines for high blood pressure or elevated cholesterol should consult their doctor or pharmac@@ ist if the dosage of these medicines needs to be adjusted .
it is recommended to take additional fluctu@@ ating measures to prevent the possible failure of oral contrac@@ eption in case of severe di@@ arr@@ ho@@ ea ( see section 4.5 ) .
both in a study on drug interactions and in several cases with simultaneous use of or@@ list@@ at and C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in a lowering of the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in plas@@ m@@ ble was observed .
&quot; in the application of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants in combination with or@@ list@@ at , the quick @-@ values ( internationally standardized ratio , IN@@ R ) could be affected ( see section 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; in most patients treated in clinical trials up to 4 full years with or@@ list@@ at , the concentrations of vitamins A , D , E and K as well as beta car@@ ot@@ ins remained in the normal range . &quot;
&quot; however , patients should be advised to take a complementary mul@@ tiv@@ it@@ amin supplement before bed@@ time to ensure sufficient vitamin absorption ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; after the administration of a single @-@ mal@@ do@@ sis A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ on was observed in a limited number of volunteers , who received or@@ list@@ at at the same time , a minor decrease of A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ one plasma concentration . &quot;
&quot; experimental studies showed no direct or indirect effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; the side effects of or@@ list@@ at are mainly g@@ astro@@ intestinal nature and are associated with the pharmac@@ ological effect of the drug , since the absorption of absorbed fat is prevented . &quot;
the g@@ astro@@ intestinal side effects were obtained from clinical trials with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg for a duration of 18 months to 2 years and were generally mild and temporary .
&quot; the frequency is defined as follows : very frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) , not known ( frequency on basis of available data is not estimated ) . &quot;
the incidence of the known side effects reported after the launch of or@@ list@@ at is not known since these events were voluntarily reported by a population of unknown magnit@@ ude .
† It is plau@@ sible that treatment with all@@ i can lead to lem@@ ony in terms of possible or actual g@@ astro@@ intestinal side effects .
&quot; single doses of 800 mg of or@@ list@@ at and multiple doses of up to 400 mg three times a day were administered over a period of 15 days to normal and over@@ weight subjects , without significant clinical findings . &quot;
&quot; in the majority of cases reported by or@@ list@@ at over@@ dosage , no side effects or similar side effects were reported as at the recommended dose of or@@ list@@ at . &quot;
&quot; based on research on humans and animals , a rapid retreat of any system@@ ic effects caused by the li@@ pi@@ ous properties of or@@ list@@ at can be assumed . &quot;
the therapeutic effect sets in the l@@ umen of stomach and the upper small intest@@ ine through co@@ valent bond to the active ser@@ ine @-@ rest of the ga@@ str@@ isch and p@@ ank@@ re@@ atic li@@ ds .
clinical studies were derived that 60 mg Or@@ list@@ at was taken three times a day to block the absorption of about 25 % of the food fat .
&quot; two double @-@ blind , random@@ ised , plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled studies on adults with a BM@@ I ≥ 28 kg / m2 demonstrate the efficacy of 60 mg Or@@ list@@ at , which was taken three times a day in combination with a hypo@@ kal@@ ine , fat @-@ induced nutrition . &quot;
&quot; the primary parameter , the change of body weight compared to the initial value ( at the time of random@@ ization ) , was assessed as follows : as a change in body weight in the course of study ( Table 1 ) and as a percentage of those who have lost more than 5 % or more than 10 % of their initial weight ( Table 2 ) . &quot;
&quot; although in both studies the weight reduction was observed over 12 months , the greatest weight loss occurred in the first 6 months . &quot;
the average change in the Gesamt@@ cholester@@ in amounted to with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg -@@ 2.4 % ( initial value 5.@@ 20 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and plac@@ ebo + 2.8 % ( initial value 5.@@ 26 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
the average change of L@@ DL cholesterol was 60 mg -@@ 3.5 % ( initial value 3.@@ 30 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and plac@@ ebo + 3.8 % ( initial value 3.@@ 41 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
&quot; during wa@@ ist measurement , the average change was -@@ 4.5 cm with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg ( starting point 10@@ 3.7 cm ) and with plac@@ ebo -@@ 3,6 cm ( starting point 10@@ 3.5 cm ) . &quot;
plas@@ mac@@ concentrations of non met@@ ab@@ oli@@ zed or@@ list@@ at were not meas@@ urable 8 hours after oral administration of 360 mg Or@@ list@@ at ( &lt; 5 ng / ml ) .
&quot; 7 In general , not met@@ ab@@ oli@@ zed or@@ list@@ at in plasma could only be spor@@ adi@@ cally and at extremely low concentrations ( &lt; 10 ng / ml or 0.0@@ 2 µ@@ mo@@ l ) and without signs of a cum@@ ulation . &quot;
&quot; in a study involving adi@@ p@@ ous patients that the minimum system@@ ically res@@ or@@ ated dose was administered , two major met@@ ab@@ oli@@ ths , namely M1 ( in position 4 hydro@@ ly@@ sed Lac@@ ton@@ ring ) and M3 ( M1 after spl@@ itting the N @-@ Form@@ yl leu@@ c@@ ine group ) , were identified , which presented approximately 42 % of the total plas@@ mac@@ ular concentration . &quot;
&quot; based on conventional studies on safety har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated administration , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity , car@@ cin@@ ogen@@ ic potential and reproduction toxic@@ ity , the prec@@ lin@@ ical data cannot be identified as a particular threat to the human being . &quot;
&quot; pharmaceutical vig@@ il@@ ance system The owner of the approval for the market must ensure that the pharmac@@ o@@ vig@@ il@@ ance system , according to the version of July 2007 , is described , applied and works before and while the product is available on the market . &quot;

&quot; Alo@@ xi is used in chem@@ otherap@@ ies which are strong trig@@ gers for nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting ( like cis@@ pl@@ atin ) , as well as in chem@@ otherap@@ ies , the moderate trigger for nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting ( like cy@@ clo@@ phosph@@ amide , d@@ ox@@ or@@ u@@ bic@@ in or carb@@ op@@ l@@ atin ) . &quot;
the effectiveness of Alo@@ xi can be increased by adding a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ o@@ ids ( a medicine that can be used as anti@@ em@@ e@@ tical ) .
&quot; the application in patients under 18 years of age is not recommended , as the effects in this age group do not have enough information . &quot;
&quot; this means that the active substance prevents the binding of a chemical substance in the body , 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin ( 5@@ HT , also known as ser@@ oton@@ in ) , to the recept@@ ors in the intest@@ ines . &quot;
&quot; Alo@@ xi was studied in three main studies of 1 8@@ 42 adults who received chemotherapy regim@@ ens , which are strong or moderate trig@@ gers for nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting . &quot;
&quot; in case of chem@@ otherap@@ ies that are strong trig@@ gers for nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting , 59 % of patients treated with Alo@@ xi showed no v@@ om@@ iting in 24 hours after chemotherapy ( 132 of 223 ) , compared to 57 % of patients treated with On@@ dan@@ set@@ ron ( 126 of 221 ) . &quot;
&quot; in case of chem@@ otherap@@ ies , the moderate trigger for nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting , 81 % of patients treated with Alo@@ xi showed no v@@ om@@ iting in 24 hours after chemotherapy ( 153 of 189 ) , compared to 69 % of patients treated with On@@ dan@@ set@@ ron ( 127 of 185 ) . &quot;
in comparison with Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron these values were 63 % for Alo@@ xi ( 119 of 189 patients ) and 53 % for Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron ( 101 of 191 patients ) .
&quot; in March 2005 , the European Commission granted Helsinki Bi@@ rex Pharmaceuticals Ltd . approval for the market launch of Alo@@ xi in the entire European Union . &quot;
al@@ op@@ xi is indicated : to prevent acute nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting with severe em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy due to cancer illness and to prevent nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting with moderate em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy due to cancer .
the effectiveness of al@@ op@@ xi to prevent nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting caused by strong em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy may be reinforced by adding a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ o@@ ids given before chemotherapy .
&quot; since Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can extend the col@@ on massage , patients should be closely monitored with an@@ am@@ ne@@ sty ob@@ sti@@ p@@ ation or signs of a sub@@ acute I@@ le@@ us after injection . &quot;
&quot; however , as with other 5@@ HT@@ 3 antagon@@ ists , caution is offered with simultaneous administration of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron with medicines that extend the Q@@ T interval or for patients with whom the Q@@ T interval is prolonged or which tend to have such an extension . &quot;
&quot; except in connection with another chemotherapy regim@@ en , Alo@@ xi will not be used in the days following chemotherapy , nor for the treatment of nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting . &quot;
&quot; in prec@@ lin@@ ical studies Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron inhi@@ bited the activity of the five investigated chem@@ otherapeu@@ tics ( Cis@@ pl@@ atin , Cy@@ clo@@ phosph@@ amide , Cy@@ clo@@ phosph@@ amide , Cy@@ clo@@ phosph@@ amide , Cy@@ clo@@ phosph@@ amide , D@@ ox@@ or@@ u@@ bic@@ in and Mit@@ om@@ y@@ cin C ) . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical trial , there was no significant pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic interaction between a single intra@@ ven@@ ous dose of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron and a steady @-@ stat@@ e- concentration of oral met@@ oc@@ lo@@ pr@@ am@@ ids , a C@@ YP@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ or . &quot;
&quot; in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic analysis based on a population based pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic analysis , the simultaneous administration of C@@ YP@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 induc@@ tors ( D@@ exam@@ eth@@ as@@ one , C@@ im@@ eti@@ dine , D@@ ox@@ or@@ u@@ bic@@ in , Par@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , Ser@@ tr@@ alin and Ter@@ bin@@ af@@ in ) had no significant effect on the Clear@@ ance of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron . &quot;
&quot; experiences for the use of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in human gest@@ ures do not occur , so Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron should not be applied in pregnant women unless it is considered necessary by the attending physician . &quot;
&quot; clinical trials were the most common with a dose of 250 mc@@ g. to observe side effects ( altogether 6@@ 33 patients ) , at least possibly with al@@ op@@ xi in connection , head@@ aches ( 9 % ) and ob@@ sti@@ p@@ ation ( 5 % ) . &quot;
&quot; very rare cases ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) of hyper@@ sensitivity reactions and reactions at the venue ( burning , har@@ dening , dis@@ comfort and pain ) were reported in post @-@ marketing experience reports . &quot;
in the group with the highest dosage there were similar frequencies of adverse events as in the other dosage groups ; there were no dose @-@ active relationships to be observed .
&quot; there were no di@@ aly@@ sis studies carried out , however , because of the large distribution volume , a di@@ aly@@ sis is probably no effective therapy with a force of alo@@ xi@@ - over@@ dosage . &quot;
&quot; in two random@@ ised double @-@ blind studies , a total of 1,@@ 132 patients receiving chemotherapy with ≤ 50 mg / m2 Cis@@ pl@@ atin , carb@@ op@@ l@@ atin , ≤ 1,500 mg / m2 cy@@ clo@@ phosph@@ amide and 250 micro@@ grams of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron ( half @-@ value 4 hours ) or 100 mg Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron ( half @-@ time 7.3 hours ) were given , which was intra@@ ven@@ ously given on day 1 . &quot;
&quot; in a random@@ ized double @-@ blind study , a total of 667 patients received a highly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy with ≥ 60 mg / m2@@ Cis@@ pl@@ atin , &gt; 1,500 mg / m2 cy@@ clo@@ phosph@@ amide and D@@ ac@@ arb@@ az@@ ine , as well as 250 or 750 micro@@ grams of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron , received intra@@ ven@@ ously on day 1 . &quot;
results of studies with moderate em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy and the study with highly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy are summar@@ ized in the following tables .
&quot; in clinical trials for the indication of chemotherapy @-@ induced nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting ( C@@ IN@@ V ) , the effects of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron on blood pressure , heart rate and EC@@ G parameters including the Q@@ t@@ c interval were comparable with the corresponding effects of On@@ dan@@ set@@ ron and Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron . &quot;
&quot; following the findings of pre @-@ clinical studies , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron possesses the ability to block the ion@@ ic channels involved in v@@ entri@@ cular de@@ - and rep@@ ol@@ ar@@ isation and extend the duration of the action potential . &quot;
&quot; the aim of the study conducted at 221 healthy subjects was the assessment of the EC@@ G effects of i.@@ v. administered pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in single doses of 0,25 , 0.@@ 75 and 2.@@ 25 mg . &quot;
res@@ or@@ ption After intra@@ ven@@ ous administration follows an initial decrease of the plasma concentrations a slow elimination from the body with an average termin@@ al half @-@ time of approximately 40 hours .
the average maximum plasma concentration ( C@@ MA@@ x ) and the area under the concentration period curve ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) are generally dos@@ is@@ proportional to the whole dose range of 0.@@ 3- 90 μ g / kg in healthy and cancer patients .
&quot; after intra@@ ven@@ ous gift from Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron 0.25 mg every second day for a total of 3 doses , the mean medium ( ± SD ) was measured between day 1 and day 5 ( ± SD ) in the Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron plasma concentration at 42 ± 34 % . &quot;
&quot; pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic simul@@ ations indicate that once daily intra@@ ven@@ ous administration of 0.25 mg Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron was comparable to 3 consecutive days , overall exposition ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) achieved after one @-@ time intra@@ ven@@ ous administration of 0.@@ 75 mg measured ; however , the C@@ MA@@ x was 0.@@ 75 mg higher . &quot;
about 40 % are eliminated by the kid@@ neys and about another 50 % are converted into two primary metabol@@ ites compared to Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron over less than 1 % of the antagon@@ istic effect on the 5@@ HT@@ 3 recep@@ tor .
&quot; in vitro studies for metabol@@ isation have shown that C@@ YP@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and , in lower dimensions , I@@ so@@ enzymes C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 and C@@ YP@@ 1@@ A2 are involved in Met@@ abol@@ ism by Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron . &quot;
&quot; elimination After an intra@@ ven@@ ous single dose of 10 micro@@ grams / kg &#91; 14@@ C &#93; -@@ Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron , about 80 % of the dose were found in the urine from 144 hours in the urine , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron as unchanged active ingredient made about 40 % of the given dose . &quot;
after a one @-@ time intra@@ ven@@ ous intra@@ ven@@ ous injection the total body is 173 ± 73 ml / min and ren@@ al Clear@@ ance 53 ± 29 ml / min .
&quot; although in patients with severe liver dysfunction , the termin@@ ale elimination alb@@ eit and the average system@@ ic exposure with pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron increases , however , a reduction of the dose is not justified by this . &quot;
&quot; in pre @-@ clinical studies , effects were observed only after ex@@ positions which are considered sufficient above the maximum human therapeutic exposure , suggest@@ ing a low relevance for clinical use . &quot;
10 from prec@@ lin@@ ical studies suggest@@ ing that Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can only block in very high concentrations of ion@@ ic channels that are involved in v@@ entri@@ cular de@@ - and rep@@ ol@@ ar@@ isation and extend the action of action .
&quot; high doses Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron ( each dose correspon@@ ded in approximately the 30@@ fold of the therapeutic exposure to humans ) , which were given daily over two years , led to an increased incidence of liver tum@@ ours , endo@@ cr@@ ine Ne@@ oplas@@ ms ( in thy@@ roid , pit@@ u@@ itary , pancre@@ as , adren@@ al spinal cord ) and skin tum@@ ors in rats , but not in mice . &quot;
&quot; the underlying mechanisms are not fully known , but due to the high doses and since Alo@@ xi is intended for unique use , the relevance of these results is low as for the human being . &quot;

June 2006 the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) adopted a negative opinion in which the approval of the approval for the treatment of the drug intended for the treatment of hepatitis C was recommended by Al@@ ph@@ eon 6 million IE / ml In@@ j@@ ection solution .
this means that Al@@ ph@@ eon should resem@@ ble a biological medicine called Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A with the same drug @-@ effective ingredient that is already approved in the EU ( also called &quot; reference drug &quot; ) .
Al@@ ph@@ eon is intended to treat adult patients with chronic ( long @-@ lasting ) hepatitis C ( a liver disease caused by virus infection ) .
&quot; in a micro@@ sc@@ opic investigation , the liver tissue has damage , in addition , the values of the liver enzyme Alan@@ ine Amin@@ ot@@ ran@@ s@@ fer@@ ase ( AL@@ T ) are increased in the blood . &quot;
&quot; it is produced by a yeast into which a gene ( DNA ) was introduced , which stimul@@ ates the formation of the active substance . &quot;
&quot; the manufacturer of Al@@ ph@@ eon presented data that demonstrate the comparison of Al@@ ph@@ eon with Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A ( substance structure , composition and purity of the drug , mode of action , safety and efficacy in hepatitis C ) . &quot;
&quot; in the study of patients with hepatitis C , the efficacy of al@@ ph@@ eon was compared to the efficacy of the reference drug to 455 patients . &quot;
&quot; the study was measured how many patients responded to 12 of a total of 48 treatment weeks , and 6 months after the treatment of the treatment ( i.e. no signs of the virus in the blood ) . &quot;
( 44 @-@ 20 ) 74 18 84 00 Fax ( 44 @-@ 20 ) 74 18 84 16 E @-@ mail : mail @ em@@ e@@ a.@@ eu@@ .@@ int http : / / www.@@ em@@ e@@ a.@@ eu@@ .@@ int http : / / www.@@ em@@ e@@ a.@@ eu@@ .@@ int http : / / www.@@ em@@ e@@ a.@@ eu@@ .@@ int http : / / www.@@ em@@ e@@ a.@@ eu@@ .@@ int http : / / www.@@ em@@ e@@ a.@@ eu@@ .@@ int http : / / www.@@ em@@ e@@ a.@@ eu@@ .@@ int
&quot; furthermore , concerns have been expressed , that the data for the stability of the drug and the drug may not be sufficient . &quot;
&quot; the number of patients with hepatitis C , which responded to the treatment with Al@@ ph@@ eon and Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A , was similar in the clinical trial . &quot;
&quot; after setting the treatment with Al@@ ph@@ eon , the disease re@@ tar@@ ded in more patients than with the reference drug ; moreover , Al@@ ph@@ eon had more side effects . &quot;
&quot; apart from this , the test used in the study to investigate the question to what extent the medicine forms an immune response ( i.e. the body forms antibodies - special proteins - against the medicine ) , not adequ@@ ately vali@@ dated . &quot;
&quot; it can be used to treat Im@@ pe@@ tig@@ o ( a skin infection associated with cr@@ ust formation ) and small infected la@@ inc@@ ers ( cr@@ acks or chi@@ ves ) , abra@@ sions and se@@ wn wounds . &quot;
Al@@ tar@@ go is not to be used to treat infections that have been proven or probably caused by meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in@@ resistant Stap@@ hy@@ lo@@ co@@ cc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) because Al@@ ar@@ go may not work against this type of infection .
&quot; Al@@ tar@@ go can be applied to patients from the age of nine months , but in patients under the age of 18 , the skin surface must not be more than 2 % of the body surface . &quot;
&quot; if the patient does not respond to treatment after two or three days , the doctor should examine the patient again and consider alternative treatments . &quot;
it works by blocking the bacterial ri@@ bos@@ omes ( the parts of the bacterial cells in which proteins are produced ) and thereby inhi@@ bits the growth of bacteria .
the main indication of efficacy was in all five studies the proportion of patients whose infection was after the end of the treatment .
119 ( 8@@ 5.6 % ) of 139 patients under Al@@ tar@@ go and 37 ( 5@@ 2.1 % ) of 71 patients under plac@@ ebo spoke to the treatment .
&quot; in the treatment of infected skin wounds , Al@@ tar@@ go and C@@ ef@@ al@@ ex@@ in showed similar response rates : when the results of both studies were taken together in Hau@@ tw@@ ound , about 90 % of the patients of both groups responded to the treatment . &quot;
&quot; however , in these two studies , however , Al@@ tar@@ go was not effective enough in treating ab@@ sc@@ esses ( ice @-@ filled c@@ avi@@ ties in the body tissue ) or of infections caused by MR@@ SA , not effective enough . &quot;
the most common side effect with Al@@ tar@@ go ( which was observed in 1 to 10 out of 100 patients ) is a irrit@@ ation at the job site .
&quot; the Committee on Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of Al@@ tar@@ go out@@ weigh the risks of the following super@@ ficial skin infections : • Im@@ pe@@ tig@@ o , • infected small Laz@@ ores , abra@@ sions or bru@@ ised wounds . &quot;
&quot; in May 2007 , the European Commission issued a permit for the company G@@ lax@@ o Group Ltd . &quot;
&quot; patients , in which no improvement is shown within two to three days , should be examined again and considered alternative therapy ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
in the case of a sensi@@ tization or serious local irrit@@ ation by applying Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be the treatment should be canc@@ eled off the o@@ int@@ ment carefully and an appropriate alternative therapy of infection is commen@@ ced .
ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin should not be used to treat infections where MR@@ SA is known or suspected ( see section 5.1 ) .
clinical trials in secondary and open wounds was the efficacy of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin in patients with infections caused by a meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in @-@ resistant Stap@@ hy@@ lo@@ co@@ cc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) .
alternative therapy should be considered if after 2- or 3 @-@ day treatment no improvement or deteri@@ oration of the infected place occurs .
the effect of simultaneous use of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin and other top@@ ical resources on the same skin surface has not been studied and the simultaneous application of other top@@ ical drugs is not recommended .
&quot; due to the low plasma concentrations achieved in humans according to top@@ ical application on slo@@ ping skin or infected super@@ ficial wounds , a clin@@ ically relevant in@@ hibition in vi@@ vo is not to be expected ( see section 5.2 ) . &quot;
3 After simultaneous oral gift of 2 times daily 200 mg k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole increased the mean ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) and C@@ MA@@ x after top@@ ical application of 1 % ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin o@@ int@@ ment on a me@@ ag@@ onal skin of healthy adult men by 81 % .
due to the low system@@ ic exposure to top@@ ical application in patients dose adjustments are not required when top@@ ical ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is applied during a system@@ ic treatment with C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors .
animal studies have shown a reproductive toxic@@ ity after oral intake and are in@@ adequate in relation to a statement on the effects on the birth and the fet@@ al / post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin o@@ int@@ ment should be applied only during pregnancy if a top@@ ical anti@@ bacterial therapy is clearly indicated and the application of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is prefer@@ able to the gift of a system@@ ic antibiotic .
&quot; when deciding whether breast@@ feeding continues to be terminated or the therapy with Al@@ tar@@ go continues to be terminated , it is between the benefit of breast@@ feeding for inf@@ ant and the benefit of al@@ tar@@ go therapy for the woman . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials of 2@@ 150 patients with super@@ ficial skin infections , which Al@@ tar@@ go used , the most frequently reported adverse effect of irrit@@ ation at the date of the date , which was about 1 % of patients . &quot;
&quot; mode of action ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is a semi @-@ synthetic deri@@ v@@ ative of leu@@ ro@@ mu@@ ti@@ lin , a substance isolated by fermentation from C@@ lit@@ op@@ il@@ us pass@@ ag@@ eri@@ anus ( formerly Ple@@ ur@@ ot@@ us pass@@ ag@@ eri@@ anus ) . &quot;
the function mechanism of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is based on selective inhibit@@ ing of bacterial protein synthesis through interaction at a specific binding point of the 50@@ S sub@@ unit of the bacterial ri@@ bos@@ om which differs from the ties of other ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al inter@@ acting anti@@ bacterial substances .
data point out that the Bind@@ ungs@@ stelle ri@@ bos@@ om@@ ales Protein L3 is involved and is located in the region of the ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al P @-@ Bind@@ ungs@@ stelle and the Pep@@ ti@@ dy@@ l@@ transfer@@ ase Center .
&quot; binding on this binding site , P@@ leu@@ ro@@ mu@@ ti@@ line inhi@@ bits the pep@@ ti@@ dy@@ l@@ transfer , block partial P @-@ bonds interactions and prevent the normal formation of active 50@@ S ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al sub@@ units . &quot;
&quot; due to the local pre@@ val@@ ence of resistance the application of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin in at least some infection forms should be conceivable , a consultation by experts should be aimed . &quot;
&quot; no differences were found in the In @-@ vitro activity of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin compared to S.@@ au@@ re@@ us , regardless of whether the isol@@ ate were sensitive or resistant to meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in . &quot;
&quot; in case of non @-@ response to treatment at S.@@ au@@ re@@ us , the presence of tribes with additional vir@@ ul@@ ence factors ( such as PV@@ L = P@@ anton @-@ Valent@@ ine Leu@@ co@@ ci@@ din ) should be considered . &quot;
&quot; res@@ or@@ ption In a study involving healthy adults , 1 % ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin o@@ int@@ ment was applied daily under occ@@ lu@@ sion on intact and on s@@ worn skin for up to 7 days . &quot;
&quot; of 516 patients ( adults and children ) , who received 1 % ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin o@@ int@@ ment twice a day for 5 days to top@@ ical treatment of secondary infected traumatic wounds , individual plas@@ map@@ ro@@ bes were obtained . &quot;
sampling was performed on days 3 or 4 in adult patients before medi@@ ation and in children from 0 @-@ 12 hours after the last application .
&quot; however , the maximum individual system@@ ic absorption of man after top@@ ical application of 1 % o@@ int@@ ment on 200 c@@ m2 was reduced to 200 c@@ m2 ( C@@ MA@@ x = 22 ng / ml ; AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) = 238 ng · h / ml ) 660 times lower than the ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin IC 50 for the P@@ GP in@@ hibition . &quot;
&quot; metabolism in vitro @-@ oxid@@ ative metabolism of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin in human liver micro@@ som@@ es was primarily medi@@ ated by C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 , with less involvement of C@@ YP@@ 2@@ C8 and C@@ YP@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; in studies on oral toxic@@ ity on rats ( 50 , 150 or 450 mg / kg ) , performed over 14 days , there were signs of adap@@ tive liver and thy@@ roid les@@ ions . &quot;
in @-@ vitro investigation on gene mut@@ ation and / or chromos@@ om@@ al effects in the mouse lymph@@ oma test or in cultures of human peripher@@ al blood lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes as well as in the rats micro@@ kernel test for in @-@ vi@@ vo examination of chromos@@ om@@ al effects .
&quot; there was neither male nor female rats signs of limited fer@@ til@@ arity in oral doses of 50 , 150 or 450 mg / kg / day , resulting in a maximum estimated exposure to humans ( top@@ ical application on 200 c@@ m2 shiel@@ ded skin ) : &quot;
&quot; in an embry@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity study on rats were observed in oral dosing of ≥ 150 mg / kg / day ( according to the ≥ 3 @-@ fold of estimated human exposure ( see above ) ) , development toxic@@ ity ( reduced body weight of fet@@ us and delayed oscill@@ ation ) and mat@@ ern@@ ally toxic@@ ity . &quot;

&quot; it must not be applied in the eyes , in the mouth or on the lips , in the nose or in the female genital area . &quot;
&quot; if the o@@ int@@ ment from se@@ per@@ ing on one of these surfaces , wash the place with water and ask your doctor for advice if symptoms occur . &quot;
&quot; after applying the o@@ int@@ ment , you can cover the affected area with a sterile association or a gaz@@ elles , unless your doctor advised you to cover the area . &quot;

&quot; Ambi@@ rix is used to protect against hepatitis A and hepatitis B ( diseases affecting the liver ) in children aged between 1 and 15 years , which are not immune to these two diseases . &quot;
&quot; Ambi@@ rix is used as part of a vacc@@ ine consisting of two doses , whereby a protection against hepatitis B may only be achieved after the second dose is administered . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , Ambi@@ ent may only be used if immun@@ ization is a low risk of hepatitis B infection and is ensured that the vacc@@ ine can be carried out from two doses . &quot;
&quot; if a refres@@ her dose is desirable for hepatitis A or B , Ambi@@ rix or other hepatitis A or B vacc@@ ine can be given . &quot;
&quot; vacc@@ ines work by contributing to the immune system ( the natural defense of the body ) , &quot; as it can fight against a disease . &quot;
&quot; after a child has received the vacc@@ ine , the immune system det@@ ects viruses and surface anti@@ gens as &quot; alien &quot; and produces antibodies against it . &quot;
Ambi@@ rix contains the same ingredients as the vacc@@ ine approved in 1996 and the ino@@ x vacc@@ ine approved since 1997 .
&quot; the three vacc@@ ines are used to protect against the same diseases , however tw@@ ins and Twin@@ rix are administered as part of a vacc@@ ine existing out of three doses . &quot;
&quot; because Ambi@@ rix and Twin@@ rix adults contain identical ingredients , some of the data , which support the application of Twin@@ rix adult , were also used as proof of the application of Ambi@@ rix . &quot;
the main indicator of the efficacy was the share of vacc@@ inated children who had developed a protective antibody concentration a month after the last injection .
&quot; in an additional study involving 208 children , the efficacy of the vacc@@ ine was compared with a six @-@ month and a 12 @-@ month gap between the two inj@@ ections . &quot;
&quot; between 98 and 100 % of vacc@@ inated children , Ambi@@ rix led to the development of protective antibodies against hepatitis A and B between 98 and 100 % of the vacc@@ inated children . &quot;
the additional study showed that the degree of protection of Ambi@@ rix was similar in a six @-@ month gap between the inj@@ ections .
&quot; the most common side effects of Ambi@@ rix ( observed in more than 1 of 10 vacc@@ ine doses ) are head@@ ache , loss of appetite , pain at the injection point , red@@ ness , mat@@ eness ( fatigue ) as well as irrit@@ ability . &quot;
&quot; ambient mood may not be applied to patients who are possibly hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to the active ingredients , one of the other ingredients or ne@@ om@@ y@@ cin ( an antibiotic ) , do not be applied . &quot;
August 2002 the European Commission issued a permit for the company G@@ lax@@ o@@ S@@ mith@@ K@@ line Biolog@@ icals .
&quot; the vacc@@ ination plan for the basic vacc@@ ination with Ambi@@ rix consists of two vacc@@ ines , whereby the first dose is administered at the date of choice and the second dose between six and twelve months after the first dose . &quot;
&quot; if a refres@@ her is desired both for hepatitis A and hepatitis B , vacc@@ ines or combination vacc@@ ines can be vacc@@ inated with the corresponding mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ent vacc@@ ines . &quot;
the anti @-@ hepatitis A virus ( anti @-@ H@@ B@@ s@@ A@@ g ) and anti @-@ hepatitis A virus ( anti @-@ H@@ B@@ s@@ A@@ g ) and anti @-@ hepatitis A virus ( anti @-@ H@@ B@@ s@@ A@@ g ) and anti @-@ hepatitis A virus ( anti @-@ H@@ B@@ s@@ A@@ g ) and anti @-@ hepatitis A virus ( anti @-@ H@@ B@@ s@@ A@@ g ) are in the same magnit@@ ude as after vacc@@ ination with the respective mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ents vacc@@ ines .
&quot; it is not yet fully assured whether immun@@ o@@ competent individuals who have responded to a vacc@@ ine vacc@@ ination is necessary , since they are also protected by immun@@ ological memory in no longer det@@ ectable antibodies . &quot;
&quot; 3 As with all injection vacc@@ ines , appropriate possibilities for medical treatment and monitoring should always be available for the rare case of an an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ tic reaction after the administration of the vacc@@ ine . &quot;
&quot; if a fast protection against hepatitis B is required , the standardi@@ zation scheme is recommended using the combination vacc@@ ine that contains 360 ELISA units form@@ al@@ in@@ active hepatitis A virus and 10 µ@@ g of re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen . &quot;
&quot; in case of hem@@ at@@ aly@@ sis patients and persons with disorders of the immune system , no adequate anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ H@@ Bs antibody is achieved in such cases , so that in these cases the gift of further vacc@@ ines can be required . &quot;
&quot; since intra@@ der@@ mal injection or in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular administration could lead to a sub@@ optimal imp@@ etus , these inj@@ ections should be avoided . &quot;
&quot; with thro@@ m@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ enia or blood cl@@ ot@@ ting disorders , however , Ambi@@ ent can be inj@@ ected as an exception sub@@ cut@@ aneous as it can occur in these cases after in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular offering to ble@@ eding . &quot;
&quot; if Ambi@@ rix was administered in the second year of life in the form of a separate injection , tet@@ anus , ac@@ ell@@ ular per@@ t@@ uss@@ is@@ - , in@@ activated poli@@ omyel@@ i@@ tis@@ - and ha@@ em@@ oph@@ il@@ us influ@@ enza vacc@@ ine , the immune response was sufficient to all anti@@ gens ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
patients with immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy or in patients with immun@@ ity defects must be assumed that there is possibly no adequate immune response .
&quot; in a clinical study involving 3 vacc@@ ine doses of this formulation in adults , the frequency of pain , red@@ ness , swelling , mat@@ ernal , g@@ astro@@ ent@@ eri@@ tis , head@@ aches and fever was comparable to the frequency that was observed in earlier Thi@@ omer@@ sal@@ - and preser@@ v@@ ative @-@ containing vacc@@ ine formulation . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials , 20@@ 29 vacc@@ ine doses have been administered to a total of 10@@ 27 vacc@@ ines aged 1 to 15 years . &quot;
&quot; in a study with 300 participants aged 12 to 15 , the toler@@ ability of Ambi@@ rix was compared to that of the 3 @-@ liter combination vacc@@ ine . &quot;
&quot; only exceptions were the higher frequencies of pain and mat@@ ousness on a calculation basis per vacc@@ ine ambi@@ rix , but not on a basis of calculation per person . &quot;
&quot; pain was observed after the administration of Ambi@@ rix in 50,@@ 7 % of the subjects , compared to 39.@@ 1 % in the subjects after the gift of a dose of 3 doses of combination vacc@@ ine . &quot;
&quot; after the complete vacc@@ ination cycle , 6@@ 6,@@ 4 % of the subjects were given to the Ambi@@ rix , about pain , compared to 6@@ 3.8 % in the subjects , which were vacc@@ inated with the 3 @-@ dose combination vacc@@ ine . &quot;
&quot; however , the frequency of mat@@ ernal ity was compar@@ atively high ( i.e. over the entire vacc@@ ine cycle at 39.@@ 6 % of the subjects who received ambi@@ tions compared to 36.@@ 2 % in the subjects who received the 3 @-@ liter combination vacc@@ ine ) . &quot;
the incidence of pronounced pain and pain was low and comparable to which was observed after administration of the combination vacc@@ ine with the 3 @-@ dose vacc@@ ine .
&quot; in a comparative study at 1 @-@ 11 @-@ year @-@ old vacc@@ ines , the incidence of local reactions and general reactions in the Ambi@@ ri@@ x@@ Group was comparable to that which was observed when administered with the 3 @-@ liter combination vacc@@ ine with 360 ELISA units form@@ al@@ in@@ activated hepatitis A virus and 10 µ@@ g of re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen . &quot;
&quot; however , with the 6@@ - to 11 @-@ year @-@ old , however , after vacc@@ ination with Ambi@@ rix a frequent occurrence of pain ( at the injection point ) per dose , not per specimen , was reported . &quot;
&quot; the share of vacc@@ ines , which reported serious side effects during the 2 @-@ liter vacc@@ ine with Ambi@@ rix or during the 3 @-@ liter vacc@@ ine with the combination vacc@@ ine with 360 EL@@ IS@@ A- units , in@@ activated hepatitis A virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen was not statisti@@ cally different . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials carried out at the age of 1 and including 15 years , the Ser@@ o@@ conversion rates for anti @-@ H@@ AV 99.@@ 1 % were one month after the first dose and 100 % one month after the second dose ( i.e. in month 7 ) . &quot;
&quot; the Ser@@ o@@ conversion rates for anti @-@ H@@ Bs were 7@@ 4.2 % one month after the first dose and 100 % one month after the second dose , for month 6 administered dose ( i.e. in month 7 ) . &quot;
&quot; 7 In a comparative study carried out at 12@@ - to including 15 @-@ year @-@ old , 142 two doses received Ambi@@ rix and 147 the standard combination vacc@@ ine with three doses . &quot;
&quot; in the 289 individuals whose immun@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity was evaluated , the Ser@@ op@@ rot@@ ection rates ( SP in the table below ) were significantly higher against hepatitis B in the month 2 and 6 after giving the 3 @-@ dose vacc@@ ine significantly higher than with Ambi@@ rix . &quot;
&quot; in the following table , the immun@@ ity answers , which were obtained in a clinical comparative study at 1 @-@ 11 @-@ year @-@ old one month after the completion of the full vacc@@ ination series ( i.e. in month 7 ) , are listed in the following table . &quot;
in both studies the vacc@@ ines received either a 2 @-@ dose vacc@@ ine with Ambi@@ rix or a 3 @-@ dose vacc@@ ine with a combination vacc@@ ine with 360 ELISA units form@@ al@@ in@@ activated hepatitis A virus and 10@@ µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen .
&quot; in people who were aged between 12 and 15 years old , the persist@@ ence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ H@@ Bs antibody could be detected at least 24 months after immun@@ ization with Ambi@@ rix in the 0 @-@ 6 month vacc@@ ine . &quot;
the immune response observed in this study was comparable to those observed after vacc@@ ination of 3 doses with a combination vacc@@ ine consisting of 360 ELISA units form@@ al@@ in@@ activated hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen in a dose volume of 0.5 ml .
&quot; in a clinical trial at 12@@ - to including 15 @-@ year @-@ old , it could be shown that the persist@@ ence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ H@@ Bs @-@ antibodies were comparable 24 months after immun@@ ization in the 0 @-@ 6 months vacc@@ ine . &quot;
&quot; if the first dose of Ambi@@ rix was administered in the second year of life with the combination of a combined di@@ ph@@ th@@ eri@@ e- , tet@@ anus , ac@@ ell@@ ular per@@ t@@ uss@@ is@@ - , in@@ activated poli@@ omyel@@ i@@ tis@@ - and 8 Ha@@ em@@ oph@@ il@@ us influ@@ enza vacc@@ ine , the immune response was sufficient to all anti@@ gens . &quot;
a clinical study conducted with 3 doses of current formulation in adults showed similar ser@@ op@@ rot@@ ection and ser@@ o@@ conversion rates as for earlier formulation .
the vacc@@ ine is examined both before and after the res@@ us@@ pen@@ ing of any foreign particles and / or physical visible changes .

&quot; the hepatitis A virus is commonly transmitted by virus containing foods and beverages , but can also be transmitted by other ways such as swimming in the waters contaminated by wast@@ ewater . &quot;
&quot; you can feel very tired , have a dark urine , a bli@@ ster face , yellow skin and / or eyes ( j@@ aun@@ dice ) and other symptoms that may require a stationary treatment . &quot;
&quot; as with all vacc@@ ines , Ambi@@ rix can not fully protect from infection with hepatitis A or hepatitis B virus , even if the complete vacc@@ ination series with 2 doses has been completed . &quot;
if you / your child are already infected with hepatitis A or Hepatitis B virus from the administration of both vacc@@ ine doses ( although you / your child may not feel uncomfortable or ill / feels ) a vacc@@ ination may not prevent disease .
&quot; protection against other infections caused by liver damage or symptoms , which are similar to those after hepatitis A or hepatitis B infection can not be convey@@ ed . &quot;
• if your child has already shown an allergic reaction to ambient mood or any component of this vacc@@ ine including ne@@ om@@ y@@ cin ( an antibiotic ) .
&quot; an allergic reaction can manifest through it@@ chy r@@ ashes , breath or swelling of the face or tongue . • If you have an allergic reaction to an earlier vacc@@ ination against hepatitis A or hepatitis B , if you / your child have a severe infection with fever . &quot;
• If you want to quickly have a protection against hepatitis B ( i.e. within 6 months and before the usual administration of the second vacc@@ ine dose ) .
&quot; at a possible risk of infection with hepatitis B between the first and second vacc@@ ination , the doctor will advise you / your child from a vacc@@ ination with Ambi@@ rix . &quot;
instead he will recommend three inj@@ ections of a combined hepatitis A / hepatitis B vacc@@ ine with a reduced content of effective constitu@@ ents per vacc@@ ine ( 360 ELISA units of a form@@ al@@ in@@ active hepatitis B virus and 10 micro@@ grams of a re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface anti@@ gens ) .
the second vacc@@ ine of this vacc@@ ine with reduced content of effective ingredients is usually administered one month after the first dose and should give you / your child a vacc@@ ination against end of the vacc@@ ine series .
&quot; sometimes Ambi@@ ent is inj@@ ected in people who suffer from severe blood cl@@ ot@@ ting disorders , under the skin and not into the muscle . • If you / your child are weak@@ ened due to illness or treatment in your body &apos;s defense , or if you / your child undergo a hem@@ at@@ aly@@ sis . &quot;
&quot; ambi@@ rix can be given in these cases , but the immune response of those individuals on vacc@@ ination may not be sufficient so that a blood test can be required to see how strongly the reaction to vacc@@ ination is . &quot;
21 Tell your doctor if you / your child take other medicines ( including those who have been vacc@@ inated without prescription ) or if you / your child were recently vacc@@ inated / has been given / has or this is planned in the near future .
&quot; however , it may be that in this case the immune response is not sufficient to the vacc@@ ine and the person is therefore not protected against one or both hepatitis A and B viruses . &quot;
&quot; if another vacc@@ ine has to be given at the same time with ambient mood , should be vacc@@ inated in separate places and as different limbs as possible . &quot;
&quot; if Ambi@@ ani should be administered at the same time or shortly before or after an injection of immun@@ og@@ lob@@ ul@@ ins , it is likely that the reaction to the vacc@@ ine is still sufficient . &quot;
&quot; usually , Ambi@@ rix will not be administered pregnant or breast@@ feeding women unless it is urg@@ ently needed that they are vacc@@ inated against hepatitis A as well as hepatitis B. &quot;
important information about certain other ingredients of Ambi@@ rix Please tell your doctor if your child has already shown an allergic reaction to ne@@ om@@ y@@ cin ( antibiotic ) .
&quot; if you miss the agreed date for the second vacc@@ ination , talk to your doctor and make a new appointment as soon as possible . &quot;
♦ very common ( more than 1 case per 10 dec@@ im@@ ated doses ) : • Pain or dis@@ comfort at the gro@@ ov@@ ing or red@@ ness • Mat@@ work • irrit@@ ability • head@@ ache • lack of appetite
♦ frequently ( up to 1 case per 10 dise@@ ased doses ) : • swelling of the injection point • fever ( more than 38 ° C ) • ligh@@ the@@ ade@@ dness • Ga@@ stro @-@ intestinal complaints
&quot; other side effects , the days or weeks after vacc@@ ination with comparable combination or single vacc@@ ines against hepatitis A and hepatitis B very rare ( less than 1 case per 10,000 ver@@ im@@ planted doses ) are reported : &quot;
&quot; these include local limited or extended explo@@ sions that can be it@@ chy or blos@@ som @-@ shaped , swelling of the eyel@@ ids and the face , difficult breathing or swal@@ lowing , sudden blood pressure drop and un@@ consciousness . &quot;

23 Read your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if one of the listed side effects you / your child will significantly affect you or you notice side effects that are not stated in this package .
Ambi@@ rix is available in packs of 1 and 10 with or without need@@ les and in packs to 50 without need@@ les .
&quot; on the basis of the data , which has become known since issu@@ ing the first approval for the market , the CH@@ MP with@@ drew the opinion that the benefit @-@ risk relationship for Ambi@@ rix remains positive . &quot;
&quot; however , since Ambi@@ rix was put into circulation only in a Member State ( in the Netherlands since May 2003 ) , the available safety data for this drug is limited due to the low patient exposition . &quot;
ammon@@ ium can also be used in patients aged over a month with in@@ complete enzyme defect or hyper@@ ammon@@ ium @-@ based encephal@@ opathy ( brain damage due to high ammon@@ ia concentrations ) in the pre@@ history .
&quot; ammon@@ ium is - split into several single doses at meals - swal@@ lowed , mixed under the food or via a Gast@@ ro@@ stom@@ ia esch@@ l@@ auch ( through the abdominal wall into the stomach of leading tube ) or a nas@@ al probe ( through the nose into the stomach of leading tube ) . &quot;
&quot; there was no comparative study , since ammon@@ aps could not be compared with another treatment or plac@@ ebo ( a pseu@@ do @-@ drug , i.e. without substance ) . &quot;
&quot; ammon@@ ium can also cause loss of appetite , a ab@@ normal aci@@ dity in the blood , depression , irrit@@ ability , head@@ ache , impot@@ ence , nau@@ sea , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , skin r@@ ash , unpleasant body od@@ or or weight gain . &quot;
the Committee on Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that ammon@@ aps in patients with disorders of the ure@@ a cycle are effectively prevented by high ammon@@ ia values .
&quot; Ammon@@ ium was approved under &quot; &quot; exceptional circumstances &quot; &quot; because of the rar@@ ity of the disease at the time of approval only limited information on this medicine . &quot;
&quot; the use is indicated in all patients , in which a complete lack of enzyme is already manifested in new@@ bor@@ ns ( within the first 28 liver age ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients with a late @-@ manifest form ( incomplete enzyme defect , which mani@@ f@@ ests itself after the first month of life ) , an indication exists for the use when hyper@@ ammon@@ ish encephal@@ opathy exists in an@@ am@@ nes@@ is . &quot;
&quot; for babies , for children who are not able to swal@@ low tablets or for patients with swal@@ lowing problems , AM@@ MONA@@ PS is also available in gran@@ ulate form . &quot;
the daily dose is calculated individually considering the protein intoler@@ ance and the daily protein intake of the patient .
&quot; according to previous clinical experience , the normal daily dose sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9,@@ 9 - 13,@@ 0 g / m ² / day in children with a body weight of over 20 kg , as well as for adol@@ escents and adults . &quot;
the sub@@ stitution of cit@@ rul@@ line or ar@@ gin@@ ine in a dosage of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day is required .
patients with an ar@@ gin@@ ine deficiency syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase deficiency must receive ar@@ gin@@ ine in a dosage of 0.4 - 0.7 g / kg / day or 8.@@ 8 - 15.@@ 4 g / m ² / day .
&quot; AM@@ MONA@@ PS tablets may not be administered with swal@@ lowing disorders , as there is a risk for the formation of o@@ es@@ oph@@ ag@@ us@@ ul@@ cer@@ a if the tablets do not immediately get into the stomach . &quot;
&quot; each tablet AM@@ MONA@@ PS contains 62 mg ( 2,@@ 7 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium , corresponding to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per 20 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate , which corresponds to the maximum daily dose . &quot;
&quot; therefore , AM@@ MONA@@ PS should therefore be used only with caution in patients with con@@ ges@@ tive heart failure or severe kidney failure . &quot;
&quot; since metabolism and ex@@ cre@@ tion of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate is carried out over the liver and kid@@ neys , AM@@ MONA@@ PS should be applied only with extreme caution in patients with liver or kidney failure . &quot;
the importance of these results regarding pregnant women is not known ; the use of AM@@ MONA@@ PS during pregnancy is therefore contra@@ indicated ( see 4.3 ) .
&quot; in case of sub@@ cut@@ aneous administration of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate at young rats in high doses ( 190 - 474 mg / kg ) , there was a slow@@ down of neur@@ onal multip@@ lication and increased loss of neur@@ ons . &quot;
there was also a delayed matur@@ ation of cer@@ ebral syn@@ ap@@ ses and a reduced number of functional nerve damage in the brain and thus a disability of brain growth .
&quot; it could not be determined whether phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is ex@@ cre@@ ted in humans into breast milk , and for this reason the use of AM@@ MONA@@ PS is contra@@ indicated during lac@@ tation ( see 4.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials with AM@@ MONA@@ PS , 56 % of patients had at least an undes@@ irable event ( AE ) and at 78 % of these adverse events was assumed that they were not associated with AM@@ MONA@@ PS . &quot;
&quot; frequency is defined as follows : very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , often ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) and occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1.000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) . &quot;
&quot; a likely toxic reaction to AM@@ MONA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by a 18 year old an@@ or@@ ec@@ tic patient , which developed a met@@ abolic encephal@@ opathy in conjunction with Lak@@ tat@@ azi@@ tin , heavy hypo@@ kal@@ emia , ar@@ mor@@ y@@ top@@ enia , peripher@@ al neu@@ rop@@ athy and pancre@@ atitis . &quot;
a case of over@@ dose occurred in a 5 month old inf@@ ant with an acci@@ dental single dose of 10 g ( 13@@ 70 mg / kg ) .
&quot; these symptoms occur with the accumulation of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate , which showed a dose @-@ limiting neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity in intra@@ ven@@ ous dosage of doses up to 400 mg / kg / day . &quot;
phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is an in@@ trin@@ si@@ cally active compound that con@@ jug@@ ates with glut@@ amine to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine that is ex@@ cre@@ ted above the kid@@ neys .
&quot; as a result , phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is comparable ( both compounds contain 2 nitrogen at@@ oms ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore suitable as alternative carriers for ex@@ cre@@ tion of excess nitrogen . &quot;
5 patients with dys@@ functions of the ure@@ a cycle can be assumed that for each gram sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at produced between 0.@@ 12 and 0.@@ 15 g phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine nitrogen .
it is important that the diagnosis is set early and the treatment is started immediately to improve survival chances and clinical outcome .
the pro@@ g@@ nosis of the early manifest form of the disease with the occurrence of the first symptoms in new@@ bor@@ n@@ age was almost always inf@@ lic@@ ated and the disease itself led to death even in treatment with per@@ it@@ one@@ al di@@ aly@@ sis and essential amino acids or with their nitrogen @-@ free analog@@ a within the first year of life .
&quot; hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis , the utilization of alternative ways of nitrogen ex@@ cre@@ tion ( sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at , sodium ben@@ zo@@ ate and sodium phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate ) , protein @-@ reduced food and possibly sub@@ stitution of essential amino acids , it was possible to increase the survival rate of new@@ bor@@ ns in post@@ part@@ al ( but within the first month of life ) to increase to 80 % . &quot;
patients whose disease was diagnosed in the course of pregnancy and which were already treated before the first occurrence of hyper@@ ammon@@ ic encephal@@ opathy was the survival rate of 100 % but even in these patients it occurred with many to mental disabilities or other neurolog@@ ical defic@@ its .
&quot; in patients with a late @-@ manifest form of the disease ( including female patients with the hetero@@ zy@@ g@@ otic form of the or@@ ni@@ thin@@ is@@ arb@@ am@@ y@@ las@@ e deficiency ) , which were treated permanently with sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at and a protein @-@ reduced diet , the survival rate was 98 % . &quot;
already existing neurolog@@ ical defic@@ its are hardly reversible in treatment and in some patients a further deteri@@ oration of the neurolog@@ ical state may occur .
&quot; it is known that phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate is ox@@ idi@@ zed to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate , which is con@@ jug@@ ated in liver and kidney enzyme with glut@@ amine , with phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine . &quot;
&quot; the concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at and its metabol@@ ites in plasma and urine were measured according to a single dose of 5 g. of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at in so@@ ber healthy adults and in patients with disorders of the ure@@ a cycle , hem@@ og@@ lob@@ al metabolism and with liver cir@@ rho@@ sis of oral doses of up to 20 g / day ( un@@ controlled trials ) . &quot;
the behaviour of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at and its metabol@@ ites was also studied in cancer patients after intra@@ ven@@ ous gift of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at ( up to 2 g / m ² ) or phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate .
after an oral single dose of 5 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at in tablet form 15 minutes after intake meas@@ urable plasma concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate were detected .
&quot; after different doses of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at ( 300 @-@ 650 mg / kg / day up to 20 g / day ) , the majority of patients with a ure@@ a @-@ cycli@@ cal disorder ( 300 @-@ 650 mg / kg / day up to 20 g / day ) was no phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate in the plasma . &quot;
&quot; three out of six patients with liver cir@@ rho@@ sis treated with sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at ( 20 g / day oral in three single doses ) , the mean phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate concentrations in the plasma level were five times higher than after the first gifts . &quot;
ex@@ cre@@ tion The medication is ex@@ cre@@ ted within 24 hours to about 80 - 100 % in the form of the con@@ jug@@ ated product phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine about the kid@@ neys .
&quot; according to the results of Mic@@ ron@@ u@@ cle@@ us tests , sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at had no cl@@ ast@@ ogen@@ ic effects ( examination 24 and 48 h after oral administration of a single dose of 8@@ 78 to 2800 mg / kg ) . &quot;
AM@@ MONA@@ PS gran@@ ules are either taken or@@ ally ( inf@@ ants and children who can not swal@@ low any tablets or patients with swal@@ lowing disorders ) or via a Gast@@ ro@@ stom@@ i@@ esch@@ l@@ auch or a Nas@@ en@@ son@@ de .
&quot; according to previous clinical experience , the normal daily dose sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in new@@ bor@@ ns , inf@@ ants and children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9,@@ 9 - 13,@@ 0 g / m ² / day in children with a body weight of over 20 kg , as well as for adol@@ escents and adults . &quot;
&quot; the concentration of ammon@@ ia , ar@@ gin@@ ine , essential amino acids ( especially bran@@ ched @-@ chain amino acids ) , car@@ nit@@ ine and ser@@ um proteins in plasma should be kept within the normal range . &quot;
the sub@@ stitution of cit@@ rul@@ line or ar@@ gin@@ ine in a dosage of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day is required .
&quot; AM@@ MONA@@ PS gran@@ ules contains 124 mg ( 5,@@ 4 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per gram of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate , corresponding to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per 20 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate , which corresponds to the maximum daily dose . &quot;
&quot; when rat fl@@ utes were exposed before the birth of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate ( active met@@ ab@@ oli@@ t of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at ) , it came to les@@ ions in the pyramid cells of the cor@@ tex . &quot;
&quot; a likely toxic reaction to AM@@ MONA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by a 18 year old an@@ or@@ ec@@ tic patient , which developed a met@@ abolic encephal@@ opathy in conjunction with Lak@@ tat@@ azi@@ tin , heavy hypo@@ kal@@ emia , ar@@ mor@@ y@@ top@@ enia , peripher@@ al neu@@ rop@@ athy and pancre@@ atitis . &quot;
&quot; as a result , phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is comparable to ure@@ a ( both compounds contain 2 nitrogen at@@ oms ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore suitable as alternative carriers for ex@@ cre@@ tion of excess fat &quot;
on the basis of investigations on the ex@@ cre@@ tion of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine in patients with disorders of the ure@@ a cycle can be assumed that for each gram sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at produced between 0.@@ 12 and 0.@@ 15 g phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine nitrogen .
&quot; already existing neurolog@@ ical defic@@ its are hardly reversible in treatment , and in some patients a further deteri@@ oration of the neurolog@@ ical state may occur . &quot;
after an oral single dose of 5 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at in gran@@ ular form 15 minutes after intake meas@@ urable plasma concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate were detected .
&quot; during the duration of durability , the patient may store the finished product unique for a period of 3 months at a temperature of not exceeding 25 ° C. &quot;
&quot; this procedure contains the small measuring spo@@ on 0,@@ 95 g , the medium measuring spo@@ on 2,@@ 9 g and the large measuring spo@@ on 8,@@ 6 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at . &quot;
&quot; if a patient has to receive the medication over a probe , AM@@ MONA@@ PS can also be dissolved in water before use ( the solu@@ bility of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at amounts to 5 g in 10 ml of water ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients with these rare diseases , certain liver enzymes are missing , so that they accum@@ ulate the sti@@ cky waste products that accum@@ ulate in the body after eating proteins . &quot;
&quot; if you are carried out lab tests , you must tell the doctor that you are taking AM@@ MONA@@ PS as sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at can influence the results of certain laboratory tests . &quot;
&quot; when taking AM@@ MONA@@ PS with other medicines , please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you take other medicines or have recently taken , even if it is not prescription drugs . &quot;
&quot; during lac@@ tation period , you may not take AM@@ MONA@@ PS as the drug may go into breast milk and harm your baby . &quot;
&quot; in rare cases , confusion , head@@ ache , taste distur@@ bances , dis@@ orientation of the ear , dis@@ orientation , memory distur@@ bances and a deteri@@ oration of existing neurolog@@ ical conditions were observed . &quot;
&quot; if you notice any of these symptoms , contact your doctor immediately or with the emergency exit of your hospital for the purpose of an appropriate treatment . &quot;
&quot; if you have forgotten the dose of AM@@ MONA@@ PS , take the appropriate dose as soon as possible with the next meal . &quot;

please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if any of the listed side effects will significantly affect you or you notice any side effects that are not stated in this utility .
you can no longer use AM@@ MONA@@ PS according to the exp@@ ir@@ ation date on the cart@@ on and the container .
&quot; as AM@@ MONA@@ PS looks and content of the package AM@@ MONA@@ PS tablets are of whi@@ tish color and oval shape , and they are provided with the &quot; &quot; U@@ CY 500 &quot; &quot; em@@ bos@@ sing . &quot;
&quot; 30 If laboratory tests are carried out , you must tell the doctor that you are taking AM@@ MONA@@ PS as sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate can influence the results of certain laboratory tests . &quot;
&quot; when taking AM@@ MONA@@ PS with other medicines , please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you take other medicines or have recently taken , even if it is not prescription drugs . &quot;
you should take AM@@ MONA@@ PS in equal single doses or take over a gast@@ ric fi@@ st@@ el ( condu@@ it that runs through the abdominal wall directly into the stomach ) or a nas@@ al probe ( condu@@ it that is led through the nose to the stomach ) .
&quot; 31 • Take from the container a he@@ aped measuring spo@@ on gran@@ ules . • Place a straight edge , e.g. a knife back over the upper edge of the measuring spo@@ on to remove excess gran@@ ules . • App@@ ly the recommended amount of measuring spo@@ on gran@@ ules from the container . &quot;
&quot; angi@@ ox is used to treat adult patients with acute cor@@ on@@ ary syndrome ( AC@@ S , reduced blood supply to the heart ) , for instance in un@@ stable ang@@ ina ( a form of pain in the chest with different strength@@ es ) or m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction ( heart attack ) without &quot; stres@@ sing &quot; ( an an@@ om@@ al measurement value in the electro@@ cardi@@ ogram or EC@@ G ) . &quot;
&quot; if angi@@ ox is used to prevent blood cl@@ ots in patients receiving a PCI , a higher dose is administered and the in@@ fusion can be continued up to four hours after the procedure . &quot;
this can help in patients with ang@@ ina or heart attack to maintain blood flow to the heart and increase the effectiveness of a PCI .
&quot; nearly 14 000 patients participated in the main study on the treatment of AC@@ S , in which the effect of angi@@ ox was compared to a gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ ein @-@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or ( GP@@ I , another drug to prevent blood cl@@ ots ) with the conventional combination treatment with He@@ par@@ in ( another antibody ) and a GP@@ I . &quot;
&quot; during the PCI , patients frequently became a st@@ ent ( a short tube , which remains in the ar@@ tery to prevent a sh@@ utter ) , and they also received other medicines to prevent blood cl@@ ots , such as Ab@@ ci@@ xim@@ ab and aspir@@ in . &quot;
&quot; the treatment of AC@@ S was angi@@ ox - with or without a gift of GP@@ I - in preventing new events ( deaths , heart attacks or re@@ as@@ cul@@ ari@@ zation ) after 30 days or a year as effective as conventional treatment . &quot;
&quot; in patients who undergo a PCI , An@@ gi@@ ox was just as effective as He@@ par@@ in , except for severe ble@@ eding , in which it was significantly more effective than He@@ par@@ in . &quot;
&quot; angi@@ ox may not be applied to patients who are possibly hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic to bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din , other sh@@ ud@@ ine or any of the other ingredients . &quot;
&quot; it may not be applied to patients who recently had ble@@ eding , as well as in people with severe hyper@@ tension or severe kidney problems or cardi@@ ac infection . &quot;
the Committee on Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that An@@ gi@@ ox is an acceptable replacement for He@@ par@@ in during the treatment of AC@@ S and during one PCI .
&quot; in September 2004 , the European Commission issued a permit for the Company The Medic@@ ines Company UK Ltd for the launch of An@@ gi@@ ox in the entire European Union . &quot;
&quot; for the treatment of adult patients with acute cor@@ on@@ ary syn@@ dro@@ mes ( inst@@ ab@@ ile Ang@@ ina / non @-@ ST @-@ lifting inf@@ ar@@ ction ( IA / N@@ STE@@ MI ) ) , or if an early intervention is planned . &quot;
the recommended initi@@ al@@ do@@ sis of angi@@ ox in patients with AC@@ S is an intra@@ ven@@ ous bolt of 0.1 mg / kg followed by an in@@ fusion of 0.25 mg / kg / h .
&quot; if the patient is performed in another row , an additional bolt of 0.5 mg / kg should be given and the in@@ fusion for the duration of the surgery to 1.@@ 75 mg / kg / h should be increased . &quot;
&quot; according to the PCI , the reduced in@@ fusion dose of 0.25 mg / kg / h can be recorded for 4 to 12 hours . &quot;
&quot; immediately before the procedure , a bolt release of 0.5 mg / kg is administered , followed by an in@@ fusion of 1.@@ 75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the intervention . &quot;
the recommended dosage of angi@@ ox in patients with a PCI consists of an initial intra@@ ven@@ ous bolt release of 0.@@ 75 mg / kg body weight and an intra@@ ven@@ ous in@@ fusion with a dose of 1.@@ 75 mg / kg body weight / h at least for the duration of the surgery .
the safety and efficacy of an all@@ u@@ vial Bol@@ us administration of An@@ gi@@ ox has not been studied and is not recommended even if a short PCI intervention is planned .
&quot; if this value ( ACT after 5 minutes ) is reduced to less than 225 seconds , a second bolt of 0.3 mg / kg / body weight should take place . &quot;
&quot; in order to reduce the occurrence of low ACT values , the re@@ conditioned and dil@@ uted medicine should be carefully mixed before the application and the Bol@@ us@@ do@@ sis is quickly administered intra@@ ven@@ ously . &quot;
&quot; once the ACT value is more than 225 seconds , another monitoring is no longer required , provided that the 1.@@ 75 mg / kg in@@ fusion dose is administered correctly . &quot;
&quot; in patients with moderate kidney function restriction ( G@@ FR 30 @-@ 59 ml / min ) , which are subjected to a PCI ( whether with bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din treated against AC@@ S or not ) , a lower in@@ fusion rate of 1,4 mg / kg / h should be used . &quot;
&quot; if the ACT @-@ value is less than 225 seconds , a second Bol@@ us@@ do@@ sis of 0.3 mg / kg is to be administered and the ACT repeated 5 minutes after the second Bol@@ us@@ do@@ sis . &quot;
&quot; in patients with moderate kidney damage , which were included in the II@@ I@@ - PCI study ( RE@@ PLA@@ CE @-@ 2 ) , which were included in the phase II@@ I@@ - PCI study ( RE@@ PLA@@ CE @-@ 2 ) , the ACT value was 5 minutes after the Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din Bol@@ us with an average of 366 ± 89 seconds . &quot;
3 For patients with severe kidney damage ( G@@ FR &lt; 30 ml / min ) and also in di@@ aly@@ sis @-@ based patients angi@@ ox is contra@@ indicated ( see section 4.3 ) .
treatment with angi@@ ox can be initiated 30 minutes after completion of the intra@@ ven@@ ous administration of un@@ fac@@ tional He@@ par@@ in or 8 hours after the sub@@ cut@@ aneous administration of low @-@ molecular He@@ par@@ in .
• Sever@@ al hyper@@ tension against the active substance or any other component or against Hir@@ ud@@ ine • active ble@@ eding or increased blood risk due to a distur@@ b@@ ance of the hem@@ ost@@ asis system and / or ir@@ reversible bacterial endo@@ cardi@@ tis . • severe kidney damage ( G@@ FR &lt; 30 ml / min ) and for di@@ aly@@ sis
&quot; patients are carefully monitored during treatment with regard to symptoms and signs of ble@@ eding , especially if bi@@ valent is administered in combination with another anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ans ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; even if the most ble@@ eding in arter@@ ial point positions occurs under bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din , patients who undergo per@@ cut@@ aneous cor@@ on@@ ary intervention ( PCI ) may occur during the treatment , in principle , occur everywhere ble@@ eding . &quot;
&quot; in patients who are taking war@@ far@@ in and treated with bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din , a monitoring of the IN@@ R value ( International Norm@@ alised R@@ atio ) should be considered to ensure that the value after treatment with Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ ine returns the level before the treatment . &quot;
&quot; starting from the knowledge about the action mechanism of anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants ( He@@ par@@ in , War@@ far@@ in , Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ oly@@ tic or Th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ te aggreg@@ ates ) , it can be assumed that these substances increase the risk of blood . &quot;
&quot; in the combination of bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ ine with thro@@ m@@ bo@@ cy@@ te aggreg@@ ates or anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants , clinical and biological hem@@ ost@@ asis parameters can be checked regularly in any case . &quot;
&quot; the experimental studies are in@@ adequate regarding the effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , the withdrawal or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; 46@@ 12 were random@@ ised to Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din alone , 46@@ 04 were random@@ ised to Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din plus G@@ PI@@ I@@ b / II@@ I@@ a In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or and 46@@ 03 were random@@ ised to either un@@ fr@@ active He@@ par@@ in or E@@ no@@ x@@ apar@@ in plus G@@ PI@@ I@@ b / II@@ I@@ a In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or . &quot;
both in the bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din group as well as in the comparative groups treated with He@@ par@@ in as well as in patients over 65 years more often suffered adverse events than in male or younger patients .
severe ble@@ edings were defined according to A@@ cu@@ ity and Tim@@ i scales for severe ble@@ eding as in the foot@@ notes of table 2 .
both light and severe ble@@ eding occurred significantly less frequently than in the groups with He@@ par@@ in plus G@@ PI@@ I@@ b / II@@ I@@ a @-@ In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or plus G@@ PI@@ I@@ b / II@@ I@@ a In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or ( see table 2 ) .
&quot; an A@@ cu@@ ity heavy ble@@ eding was defined as one of the following events : in@@ trac@@ ran@@ ial , retro@@ per@@ it@@ one@@ al , intra@@ ocular hem@@ og@@ lob@@ al mirror of ≥ 3 g / dl with well @-@ known blood stream , re@@ operation due to a ble@@ eding , application of blood products for trans@@ fusion . &quot;
&quot; further , less frequently observed blood cl@@ auses that occurred with more than 0.1 % ( occasionally ) were &quot; other &quot; point positions , retro@@ per@@ it@@ one@@ al , g@@ astro@@ intestinal , ear , nose or throat . &quot;
the following information about side effects are based on the data of a clinical trial with bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ ine in 6000 patients receiving a PCI .
&quot; both in the Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ ine group as well as in the comparative groups treated with He@@ par@@ in as well as in patients over 65 years more often , adverse events than in male or younger patients . &quot;
both light and severe ble@@ eding occurred significantly less often than in the comparison group under He@@ par@@ in plus G@@ PI@@ I@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or .
&quot; the following side effects , which are not listed above , were reported after extensive use in practice and are summar@@ ized in Table 6 according to system organ classes . &quot;
&quot; in case of over@@ dosage , the treatment with Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ ine is immediately breaking off and the patient is close mes@@ hed with regard to signs of ble@@ eding . &quot;
&quot; An@@ gi@@ ox contains Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din , a direct and specific Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in@@ inhibit@@ or , which bin@@ ds both at the cataly@@ tic centre and the an@@ ions region of thro@@ mb@@ in , regardless of whether Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in is bound in the liquid phase or on bar@@ ley . &quot;
&quot; the binding of Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din to Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in , and hence its effect , is reversible , because Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in s@@ lashes on the one hand the binding of Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din @-@ AR@@ G3 @-@ Pro@@ 4 slowly , thus re@@ generates the function of the active center of Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in . &quot;
&quot; in addition , by Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din with Ser@@ um of patients , in which patients had come to he@@ par@@ in@@ duce thro@@ m@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ enia / he@@ par@@ in@@ induced thro@@ m@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ enia ( H@@ IT / H@@ IT@@ TS ) , did not in@@ duce thro@@ m@@ bo@@ cy@@ tes . &quot;
&quot; in healthy subjects and in patients Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din shows a dose and concentration dependent an@@ tic@@ ag@@ ul@@ atory effect obtained by the extension of ACT , a@@ PT@@ T , PT , IN@@ R and TT . &quot;
&quot; if a PCI was performed in the following cases , an additional Bol@@ us of 0.@@ 5mg / kg Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din should be given and the in@@ fusion for the duration of the surgery to 1.@@ 75@@ mg / kg / h should be increased . &quot;
&quot; in the arm A of the A@@ cu@@ ity study , un@@ frac@@ tion@@ ated He@@ par@@ in or E@@ no@@ x@@ apar@@ in was administered in accordance with the relevant guidelines for treating acute cor@@ on@@ ar@@ syndrome ( AC@@ S ) in patients with un@@ stable ang@@ ina / non @-@ ST Heb@@ gen inf@@ ar@@ ction ( IA / N@@ STE@@ MI ) . &quot;
patients in arm A and B were also random@@ ized to obtain a G@@ PI@@ I@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or either before beginning of angi@@ ography ( at the time of random@@ ization ) or in the PCI .
&quot; in the A@@ cu@@ ity study , the characteristics of high @-@ risk patients , which required angi@@ ography within 72 hours , were ev@@ enly distributed over the 3 arms . &quot;
&quot; approximately 77 % of patients had a recur@@ rent isch@@ emia , 70 % had dynamic EK@@ G@@ - changes or increased cardi@@ ac biom@@ ar@@ kers , 28 % had diabetes and about 99 % of all patients under@@ went an@@ angi@@ ography within 72 hours . &quot;

&quot; A@@ pi@@ dra is used to treat adults , adol@@ escents and children from six years onwards with diabetes , which require treatment with insulin . &quot;
&quot; A@@ pi@@ dra is inj@@ ected sub@@ cut@@ aneous ( under the skin ) into the abdominal wall , the upper thig@@ h or the upper arm or as continuous in@@ fusion with an insulin pump . &quot;
diabetes is a disease in which the body does not produce enough insulin to regulate the glucose level ( sugar ) in the blood or not process insulin effectively .
&quot; insulin resistance differs very slightly from human insulin , and the change means that it works faster and shorter active duration has as a short @-@ acting human insulin . &quot;
A@@ pi@@ dra was used in combination with a long @-@ acting insulin in patients with type 1 diabetes in which the body cannot produce insulin in two studies with a total of 1 549 adults and in a study with 5@@ 72 children aged between four and 17 years .
A@@ pi@@ dra was studied in a study with 8@@ 78 adults in type 2 diabetes .
the main indicator of the efficacy was to change the concentration of the substance gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) in the blood that indicates how well the blood sugar is set .
&quot; in the first study involving adults with type 1 diabetes , a reduction of 0.@@ 14 % ( from 7.@@ 60 % to 7.@@ 46 % ) was found compared to a reduction of 0.@@ 14 % in insulin exp@@ ires . &quot;
in adults with type 2 diabetes the lowering of H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c concentration was 0.@@ 46 % after six months with A@@ pi@@ dra compared to 0.@@ 30 % of human normal insulin .
&quot; A@@ pi@@ dra must not be applied to patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive to insulin or any of the other components , or in patients suffering from hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia . &quot;
the doses of A@@ pi@@ dra may be adjusted if it is administered together with a number of other medicines that can affect the blood glucose levels .
&quot; in September 2004 , the European Commission issued a permit for the company San@@ of@@ i @-@ Av@@ enti@@ s Deutschland GmbH to appro@@ ve A@@ pi@@ dra in the whole European Union . &quot;
&quot; A@@ pi@@ dra is used as a sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection either in the area of the abdominal wall , the thig@@ h or the del@@ ta , or sub@@ cut@@ aneous by continuous in@@ fusion in the area of the abdominal wall . &quot;
&quot; due to the reduced insulin capacity and reduced insulin metabolism , insulin needs to be reduced in patients with a limitation of liver function . &quot;
&quot; every change of the active strength , the brand ( creator ) , the insulin type ( normal , N@@ PH , zinc @-@ delayed etc . ) , the type of insulin ( animal insulin ) and / or the manufacturing method can draw a change in insulin needs . &quot;
&quot; 3 An in@@ adequate dosage or abor@@ tion of treatment , especially in patients with insulin @-@ based diabetes , may result in hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and a di@@ ab@@ etic k@@ eto@@ aci@@ do@@ sis ; these conditions are potentially life threatening . &quot;
the conversion of a patient to another insulin type or insulin from another manufacturer should take place under strict medical supervision and can make a change of dosage necessary .
the time of occurrence of hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia depends on the active profile of the insulin used and can therefore change with the conversion of the treatment scheme .
&quot; the substances that increase blood sugar levels and increase the inc@@ lin@@ ation of hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia are oral anti@@ di@@ abe@@ tics , angi@@ ot@@ ens@@ in converting enzyme ( MA@@ O ) inhibit@@ ors , Pent@@ ox@@ if@@ y@@ line , pro@@ po@@ xy@@ ph@@ s , sal@@ ic@@ yl@@ ates and sul@@ phon@@ amide antibiotics . &quot;
&quot; in addition , under the effect of sympath@@ oly@@ tics such as beta block@@ ers , cl@@ oni@@ ine , Gu@@ an@@ eth@@ i@@ din and Reser@@ pin the symptoms of adren@@ ergi@@ c anti@@ gens may be weak@@ ened or ab@@ sent . &quot;
&quot; experimental studies on reproductive toxic@@ ity showed no differences between In@@ su@@ - ling@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in and human insulin in relation to pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; it is not known whether insulin insulin is transferred into human breast milk , but in general insulin does not occur in breast milk , nor is it res@@ or@@ ated after oral application . &quot;
&quot; following are listed in clinical studies which are known from clinical trials , group@@ ed according to system organs and ordered by decre@@ asing frequency of their occurrence ( very common : ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ; rare : ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ; very rare : &lt; 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ; very rare : &lt; 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ; very rare : &lt; 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ; very rare : &lt; 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ; very rare : &lt; 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ; very rare : &lt; 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ; very rare : &lt; 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ; very rare : &lt; 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ; very rare : &lt; 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ; very rare : &lt; 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ; very rare : &lt; 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ; very rare : &lt; 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ; very rare : &lt; 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ; very rare : &lt; 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ; very rare : &lt; 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ; very rare : &lt; 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ; very rare : &lt; 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ; very rare : &lt; 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ; very rare : &lt; 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ; very rare : &lt; 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ; very rare : &lt; 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ; very rare : &lt; 1

severe hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia with un@@ consciousness can be treated by an in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of glucose ( 0.5 to 1 mg ) treated by an appropri@@ ately trained person or by an intra@@ ven@@ ous gift of glucose by a doctor .
&quot; following an injection , the patient should be monitored in a hospital to determine the cause of the heavy hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia and avoid similar epis@@ odes . &quot;
insulin lowers blood sugar levels by stimulating the peripher@@ al glucose absorption ( especially through skel@@ etal mus@@ cul@@ ature and fat ) as well as by inhibit@@ ing glucose production in the liver .
studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that sub@@ cut@@ aneous Ga@@ - be of insulin sensitivity occurs faster and the time shorter is shorter than at hu@@ - man@@ em normal insulin .
&quot; in a study involving 18 male persons aged 21 to 50 years with type 1 diabetes mel@@ li@@ - tus demonstrated insulin resistance in the therapeutic relevant dosage range of 0.0@@ 75 to 0.@@ 15 E / kg a di@@ spro@@ por@@ tion@@ ate glu@@ cos@@ es@@ thetic effect , just like Human@@ insulin . &quot;
insulin insulin has twice as fast response as normal human insulin and achieves the full glu@@ cos@@ es@@ thetic effect approximately 2 hours earlier than human insulin .
the data was evident that a similar post@@ p@@ ran@@ di@@ al gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control was achieved in an application of insulin treatment 2 minutes before the meal is treated like a normal insulin which is given 30 minutes before the meal .
&quot; in 2 minutes before meal , insulin intake was reached in 2 minutes before the meal , a better post@@ p@@ ran@@ di@@ al control was achieved than with human normal insulin , which was given 2 minutes before the meal . &quot;
&quot; if insulin is turned 15 minutes after the start of the meal , a similar gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control is achieved as with human normal insulin , which is given 2 mi@@ ds before the meal ( see Figure 1 ) . &quot;
insulin ins@@ ulator in gift 2 minutes ( G@@ LU@@ L@@ IS@@ IN - before ) before the start of the meal was given in comparison to human normal insulin which was given 30 minutes ( NOR@@ MA@@ L - 30 min . ) before the start of the meal ( Fig 1A ) as well as compared to human normal insulin which was given 2 minutes ( NOR@@ MA@@ L - before ) before a meal ( Figure 1@@ B ) .
insulin ins@@ ulator in gift 15 minutes ( G@@ LU@@ L@@ IS@@ IN - after ) after the start of the meal compared to human nor@@ - mal@@ insulin which was given 2 minutes ( NOR@@ MA@@ L - before ) before the beginning of the meal ( figure 1C ) .
