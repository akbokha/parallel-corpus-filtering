<seg id="4">"it is available as a 5 mg, 10 mg, 15 mg and 30 mg tablets, as 10 mg, 15 mg and 30 mg of enamel tablets (tablets that are dissolved in the mouth), as a solution to intake (1 mg / ml) and as an injection solution (7,5 mg / ml)."</seg>
<seg id="5">"B. wirres thinking and speaking, hallucinations (hearing or seeing of things that are not present), distrust and insanity; • bipolar-I disorder, a mental illness, in which patients manage manic episodes (periods anormal high tuning) with periods of normal mood."</seg>
<seg id="6">Abilify is used to treat moderate to severe manic episodes and to prevent manic episodes in patients who have addressed the medicine in the past.</seg>
<seg id="7">"the injection solution is used for rapid monitoring of increased disturbance or behavioural disturbances, if the oral intake of the medicine is not possible."</seg>
<seg id="8">"in both diseases, the solution can be used for taking one or the enamel tablets in patients, which prepares the swallowing of tablets."</seg>
<seg id="9">"in patients who take other medicines at the same time, which are exactly as Abilify, the dose of Abilify should be adapted."</seg>
<seg id="10">"this impairs the signal transmission between brain cells through" neurotransmitters, "i.e. chemical substances that allow the communication of nerve cells among themselves."</seg>
<seg id="11">Aripiprazol probably mainly acts as a "partial agonist" for the receptors for neurotransmitters dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamin (also called serotonin).</seg>
<seg id="12">"this means that Aripiprazol like 5-hydroxytryptamin and dopamine, but in less degree than the neurotransmitters acts to activate the receptors."</seg>
<seg id="13">"da Dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamin play a role in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, Aripiprazol contributes to normalizing the activity of the brain, reducing mental or manic symptoms and preventing its recurrence."</seg>
<seg id="14">Abilify's effectiveness to prevent recurrence of symptoms has been studied in three studies for up to one year.</seg>
<seg id="15">"the efficacy of the injection solution was compared in two studies at 805 patients with schizophrenia or similar diseases, which were suffering from stricken unrest, over a period of two hours with a placebo."</seg>
<seg id="16">"in another study Abilify was compared to 347 patients with Haloperidol, in another study the efficacy of Abilify and placebo to prevent recurrence of 160 patients, in which the manic symptoms had already been stabilized with Abilify."</seg>
<seg id="17">The efficacy of Abilify injection solution was in a study of 301 patients with bipolar disorder that suffered from stricken unrest with which Lorazepam (another anti-psychotic medication) and placebo compared to a period of two hours.</seg>
<seg id="18">"in all studies, the change in the patient's symptoms was examined using a standard scale for bipolar disorder or the number of patients who responded to the treatment."</seg>
<seg id="19">The company also conducted studies to investigate how the body resorted the enamel tablets and the solution to intake.</seg>
<seg id="20">"in the two studies with the injection solution showed patients who received Abilify in doses of 5.25 mg, 9,75 mg or 15 mg, a significantly stronger reduction in symptoms of increased unrest than the patients receiving a placebo."</seg>
<seg id="21">"when applying for treatment of bipolar disorder, Abilify decreased in four of the five short-term studies of manic symptoms more effective than placebo."</seg>
<seg id="22">Abilify also prevented the recurrence of manic episodes in previously untreated patients up to 74 weeks and if it was also administered to an existing treatment.</seg>
<seg id="23">Abilify injections in 10- or 15 mg cans also reduced more effective than placebo the symptoms increased unrest and were similarly effective as Lorazepam.</seg>
<seg id="24">"the most common side effects of Abilify for taking (observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients) are extrapyramidal disturbances (uncontrollable), drowsy, nausea (drowsiness), saliva hypersecretion (increased saliva production), saliva hypersecretion, restlessness, insomnia (insomnia) and anxiety."</seg>
<seg id="25">"the Committee on Medicinal Products (CHMP) concluded that Abilify's advantages in treating schizophrenia and moderate to severe manic episodes in bipolar-I disorder, as well as in the prevention of a new manic episode in patients who mainly talked to the treatment with Aripiprazol, outweigh the risks."</seg>
<seg id="26">"in addition, the committee came to the conclusion that the benefits of injection solution in patients with schizophrenia or in patients with manic episodes in bipolar-I disorder, if oral therapy is not suitable, outweigh the risks."</seg>
<seg id="27">"in June 2004, the European Commission submitted a permit to the company Otsuka Pharmaceutical Europe Ltd. a permit for the transportation of Abilify throughout the European Union."</seg>
<seg id="28">Abilify is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe manic episodes of bipolar disorder and for the prevention of a new manic episode in patients who had mainly manic episodes and their manic episodes on treatment with Aripiprazol (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="29">The recommended starting dose for Abilify is 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day daily regardless of meals.</seg>
<seg id="30">Increased effectiveness when dosages over a daily dose of 15 mg has not been proven although individual patients can benefit from a higher dose.</seg>
<seg id="31">The recommended starting dose for Abilify is 15 mg once a day regardless of meals as monotherapy or combination therapy (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="32">The efficacy of Abilify in the treatment of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder in patients ≥ 65 years has not been proven.</seg>
<seg id="33">"with regard to the greater sensitivity of this patient group, a lower initial dose should be considered if clinical factors justify this (see section 4.4)."</seg>
<seg id="34">"if the CYP3A4 induction is removed from combination therapy, the aripiprazol dose should be reduced to the recommended dose (see section 4.5)."</seg>
<seg id="35">The occurrence of suicide behavior is part of psychotic disorders and affective disorder and was reported in some cases after the beginning or after the change of an antipsychotic therapy also in treatment with Aripiprazol (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="36">Results of an epidemiological study showed that in patients with bipolar disorder there was no increased suicide risk associated with aripiprazol compared to other antipsychotics.</seg>
<seg id="37">"Aripiprazol should be used with care in patients with known cardiovascular disease (myocardial infarction, cardiac insufficiency, cardiac insufficiency, hypertension, treatment with blood pressure lowering medicines) or hypertension (including aczelerated and malignant form)."</seg>
<seg id="38">"3 Spätdyskinesia: in clinical trials, which lasted a year or less, there were occasional reports on during treatment with Aripiprazol appearing dyskinetry."</seg>
<seg id="39">"if patients treated with Abilify, signs and symptoms of a late dyskinetry should be considered, should be considered to reduce the dose or break the treatment."</seg>
<seg id="40">"if a patient develops signs and symptoms that indicate to a mns, or has unclear high fever without an additional clinical manifestation of mns, all antipsychotics, including Abilify, must be removed."</seg>
<seg id="41">"therefore, Aripiprazol should be used in patients with seizures in anamnesia or at conditions related to seizures in connection with caution."</seg>
<seg id="42">"56 - 99 years) with Aripiprazol in patients with psychosis who are associated with Alzheimer's disease, had patients treated with Aripiprazol, an increased risk of death compared to placebo."</seg>
<seg id="43">"however, there was in one of these studies, a study with fixed dosage, a significant relationship between dosage and response to unwanted cerebrovascular events with aripiprazol treated patients."</seg>
<seg id="44">"hyperglycemia, in some cases extremely and associated with ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar coma or death, was reported in patients treated with atypical antipsychotic agents, including Abilify."</seg>
<seg id="45">There are no exact risk assessments for hyperglycemia-related unwanted events with Abilify and other atypical antipsychotic agents treated patients who allow direct comparisons.</seg>
<seg id="46">"polydipsy, polycarbonate, polyphagia and weakness) are observed and patients with diabetes mellitus or with risk factors for diabetes mellitus should be monitored regularly regarding a deterioration of glucose levels."</seg>
<seg id="47">"weight gain is generally observed in schizophrenic patients and in patients with bipolar Mania because of comorbidities, the use of antipsychotics where weight gain is known as side effects, or an unhealthy lifestyle and could lead to serious complications."</seg>
<seg id="48">"due to the primary effect of Aripiprazol on the central nervous system, caution is advised if Aripiprazol is used in combination with alcohol or other central effective medicines with outlying side effects such as sedation (see section 4.8)."</seg>
<seg id="49">"the H2-antagonist Famotidin, a gastric acid blocker, reduces the resorption rate of Aripiprazol, but this effect is considered clinically not relevant."</seg>
<seg id="50">"in a clinical trial with healthy volunteers, a highly effective CYP2D6 inhibitor (Chinidine) increased the AUC of Aripiprazol by 107%, while the CMAx remained unchanged."</seg>
<seg id="51">"it is expected that other highly effective inhibitors of CYP2D6, such as fluoxetine and paroxetine, have similar effects and therefore should be made similar dose reductions."</seg>
<seg id="52">"with CYP2D6 'bad' (=" poor ") metabolisers, the common application with highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4 in higher plasma concentrations of Aripiprazol results in compared to CYP2D6 extensive metabolisers."</seg>
<seg id="53">"considering the common gift of ketoconazole or other highly effective CYP3A4 inhibitors with Abilify, the potential benefits should prevail for the patient."</seg>
<seg id="54">Other highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4 such as itraconazole and HIV protease inhibitors are likely to have similar effects and therefore similar dose reductions should be made.</seg>
<seg id="55">"after placing the CYP2D6- or 3A4 inhibitor, Abilify dosage should be lifted to the dose height prior to the start of the accompanying therapy."</seg>
<seg id="56">Diltiazem or Escitalopram) or CYP2D6 together with Abilify can be calculated with a moderate increase in Aripiprazol- concentrations.</seg>
<seg id="57">"in clinical studies, doses of 10-30 mg Aripiprazol per day showed no significant effect on metabolism of the substrates of CYP2D6 (dextromethorphan / 3-methoxymorphinan ratio), 2C19 (Omeprazol) and 3A4 (dextromethorphan)."</seg>
<seg id="58">Patients should be advised to notify their doctor if they are pregnant or plan a pregnancy during treatment with Aripiprazol.</seg>
<seg id="59">"due to the insufficient data situation for human beings and due to the concerns caused in reproductive studies at the animal, this drug may not be applied in pregnancy unless the potential benefits justifies the potential risk of fetus."</seg>
<seg id="60">"however, as with other antipsychotics patients should be warned against dangerous machines, including motor vehicles, until they are certain that Aripiprazol has no negative influence."</seg>

<seg id="70">"increased CPK (creatine-phosphokinase), generally temporary and asymptomatic, were observed in 3.5% of patients treated with aripiprazol compared to 2.0% of patients treated with placebo."</seg>
<seg id="71">"the side effects associated with an anti-psychotic therapy are the malignant neuroleptic syndrome, spätdyspinetic events and increased mortality in older dementia patients, hyperglycemia and diabetes mellitus (see section 4.4)."</seg>
<seg id="72">"in clinical trials and since the launch of the market, unintentional or deliberate acute overdose with Aripiprazol alone is observed in adult patients with estimated doses of up to 1260 mg and without death sequence."</seg>
<seg id="73">"although there is no information about the effectiveness of a hemodialysis in the treatment of an overdose with Aripiprazol, it is unlikely that haemalysis is beneficial in the treatment of overdosage as Aripiprazol has a high plasma rotation."</seg>
<seg id="74">It is assumed that the efficacy of Aripiprazol is mediated in schizophrenia and bipolar-I disorder about the combination of a partial agonist effect on dopamine D2- and serotonin 5HT1a- receptors and an antagonistic effect on serotonin 5HT2a receptors.</seg>
<seg id="75">"in vitro, Aripiprazol showed a high affinity to the dopamine D2- and D3 receptor as well as an even affinity to the dopamine D4-, for serotonin 5HT2c- and 5HT7-, for alpha-1-adrenergic and for histamine-H1receptor."</seg>
<seg id="76">"with the gift of Aripiprazol in dosages of 0.5 to 30 mg once daily over 2 weeks of healthy volunteers, the Positron emission tomography showed a dose-dependent reduction in the binding of 11C racloprid, a D2 / D3 receptor ligands, at nucleus caudatus and at the putamen."</seg>

<seg id="82">"in two placebo-controlled monotherapy studies with flexible dosing over 3 weeks with patients with a manic or mixed episode of bipolar I disorder, Aripiprazol showed superior efficacy in reducing manic symptoms over 3 weeks."</seg>
<seg id="83">In a placebo-controlled monotherapy study over 3 weeks with fixed dosage with patients with a manic or mixed episode of bipolar I disorder Aripiprazol showed no superior efficacy compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="84">"in two placebo and actively controlled monotherapy studies for 12 weeks in patients with a manic or mixed episode of a bipolar I disorder, with or without psychotic characteristics, Aripiprazol showed superior efficacy in week 3 and a conservation effect that was comparable to that of lithium or Haloperidol in week 12."</seg>
<seg id="85">Aripiprazol also showed a comparable proportion of patients with symptomatic remission of the Mania as lithium or semi-idol in week 12.</seg>
<seg id="86">"in a placebo-controlled trial for 6 weeks with patients with a manic or mixed episode of a bipolar I disorder, with or without psychotic characteristics, which sometimes referred to lithium or valproate monotherapy in therapeutic serum mirrors, the companion therapy with Aripiprazol showed superior efficacy in reducing manic symptoms compared to monotherapy with lithium or valproate."</seg>

<seg id="749">Abstract of the EPAR to the public The present document is a summary of the European Public Service Report (EPAR) which explains how the Committee for Medicinal Products (CHMP) has judged the conducted studies to get recommendations regarding the use of the drug.</seg>
<seg id="750">"Actos is used to treat type 2 diabetes (also known as non-insulin-dependent diabetes). • It can be used alone (monotherapy) in patients (especially overweight patients), where metformin (a diabetes medication) is not shown."</seg>
<seg id="751">"it can be applied in addition to metformin in patients (especially overweight patients), which cannot be satisfactory with metformin alone in the highest tolerable dose."</seg>
<seg id="752">"in combination with a sulfonic acid or insulin, the previous dose of sulphonyl harnitine or insulin can be retained with the start of the acetylphenemia (low blood sugar); in this case, the dose of sulfoncemia or insulin should be reduced."</seg>
<seg id="753">This means that the body's insulin can be better utilized and the blood sugar level sinks so that type 2 diabetes is better adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="754">"in more than 1,400 patients the efficacy of Actos in Tripletherapy was examined; the patients received a combination of metformin with a sulphonyl substance, in addition, they received up to 3.5 years either Actos or placebo."</seg>
<seg id="755">"in the studies, the concentration of a substance in the blood (glycosylated hemoglobin, HbA1c) was measured, indicating how well the blood sugar is set."</seg>
<seg id="756">"Actos led to a reduction in the HbA1c value, which allows blood glucose levels to be reduced by 15 mg, 30 mg and 45 mg."</seg>
<seg id="757">"at the end of the Tripletherapy study, the effect of the additional gift of Actos for the existing treatment with metformin and a sulphonate resin in a decrease of HbA1c values was 0.94%, while the additional administration of placebo led to a decrease of 0.35%."</seg>
<seg id="758">"in a small study where the combination of Actos and insulin was examined in 289 patients, the patients, the Actos increased in addition to insulin, reduced the HbA1c values of 0.69% after 6 months compared to 0.14% in patients who also took placebo."</seg>
<seg id="759">"the most common side effects associated with Actos were visual disorders, infections of the upper respiratory tract (colds), weight gain and hypoanaesthesia (reduced sensitivity to stimuli)."</seg>
<seg id="760">"Actos may not be applied in patients who are possibly hypersensitive (allergic to pioglitazone or one of the other components), or in patients with liver problems, heart failure or diabetic ketoacidosis (high ketone level - acid levels - in the blood)."</seg>
<seg id="761">It has been decided that Actos should serve as an alternative to standard treatment with metformin in patients with metformin.</seg>
<seg id="762">"October 2000, the European Commission issued Takeda Europe R & D Centre Limited approved an approval for Actos in the whole European Union."</seg>

<seg id="764">Pioglitazone is also indicated for the combination with insulin in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus whose blood sugar is inadequate with insulin and is unsuitable for metformin due to contraindications or intolerance (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="765">"to use pioglitazone in patients under 18 years of age, no data is available, so the application in this age group is not recommended."</seg>
<seg id="766">"in patients suffering from the presence of at least one risk factor (e.g. earlier heart attack or symptomatic coronary heart disease), the doctor should start treatment with the lowest available dose and increase the dose gradually."</seg>
<seg id="767">"patients should be observed in signs and symptoms of heart failure, weight gain or oedema, especially those with reduced cardiac reserve."</seg>

<seg id="775">"in clinical trials with pioglitazone, a dose-dependent weight gain has been detected, which can be caused by fat deposits and in some cases associated with fluid retention."</seg>
<seg id="776">"as a result of hemodilution, a minor reduction in the mean hemoglobin values (relative reduction by 4%) and hematocrits (relative reduction by 4.1%) occurred under the therapy with Pioglitazone."</seg>
<seg id="777">Similar changes were observed in patients under Metformin (relative reduction of hemoglobin by 3-4% and hematocrits by 1-2% and hematocrits by 1-3.2%).</seg>
<seg id="778">"as a result of increased insulin sensitivity, patients suffering from pioglitazone as oral two-fold or triple combination therapy with insulin, or as a dual combination therapy with insulin, is the risk of dose-dependent hypoglycemia."</seg>

<seg id="785">"studies for the investigation of the interactions have shown that Pioglitazon does not exercise relevant effects on pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics of digooxin, warfarin, phenprocoumon and metformin."</seg>
<seg id="786">"drug interactions that are metabolized by these enzymes, e.g. oral contraceptiva, cyclosporin, calcium channel blocker and HMGCoA reductase inhibitors are not expected."</seg>
<seg id="787">Simultaneous application of pioglitazone with gemfibrozil (cytochrom P450 2C8- Inhibitor) resulted in an increase in the AUC of Pioglitazon by 3 times.</seg>
<seg id="788">The simultaneous application of Pioglitazon with Rifampicin (a cytochrom P450 2C8-inductor) resulted in a reduction in the AUC of Pioglitazone by 54%.</seg>
<seg id="789">This is due to the fact that in the treatment with Pioglitazon the hyperglycemia and increased insulin resistance of the maternity reduced and thereby decreasing the availability of the metabolic substrates for the fetal growth.</seg>

<seg id="796">"in the ProActive study conducted over a period of 3.5 years, fractures occurred at 44 / 870 (5.1%) patients treated with pioglitazone patients, compared to 23 / 905 (2.5%) in patients treated with comparative medications."</seg>
<seg id="797">"when taking the reported maximum dose of 120 mg / day over four days, then 180 mg / day over seven days no symptoms occurred."</seg>
<seg id="798">"Pioglitazon appears to act on the activation of specific nuclear receptors (Peroxisome Proliferator) Receptor-γ (PPAR-γ)), which leads to an increased insulin sensitivity of liver, fat and skeletal muscle cells."</seg>
<seg id="799">It could be shown that Pioglitazone reduces glucoseproduction in the liver and increases the peripheral glucose levels in case of insulin resistance.</seg>
<seg id="800">A clinical trial with Pioglitazon versus Gliclazid as monotherapy was continued over two years to investigate the time until after leaving the therapeutic effect (defined as HbA1c ≥ 8.0% after the first 6 months of treatment).</seg>
<seg id="801">"at the time after two years after the start of therapy, blood glucose control (defined as HbA1c &lt; 8.0%) could be maintained by pioglitazone at 69% of patients treated (compared to 50% of patients under Gliclazid)."</seg>

<seg id="807">"in clinical trials over a period of up to two years, Pioglitazon reduced the total plasmas glyceride and free fatty acids and increased the HDL cholesterol levels."</seg>
<seg id="808">"compared to placebo, no statistically significant increase in LDL cholesterol was found under Pioglitazon, while metformin and Gliclazid have been observed."</seg>
<seg id="809">"in a study of 20 weeks, Pioglitazon reduced not only the triglyceride levels, but also improved the postprandial increased triglyceride levels, this has an effect on triglyceride absorption and the hepatic triglyceride synthesis."</seg>
<seg id="810">"in the ProActive study, a cardiovascular outcome study, 5238 patients were randomised with type 2 diabetes mellitus and pre-existing makrovascular disease in groups, who received either Pioglitazon or placebo over a period of up to 3.5 years."</seg>
<seg id="811">"after oral application, Pioglitazone is quickly resorted, with the top concentrations of unmodified pioglitazone in plasma usually 2 hours after application."</seg>
<seg id="812">"on this basis, the contribution of M-IV is equivalent to the effectiveness of pioglitazone, whereas the relative effectiveness of M-II is minimal."</seg>
<seg id="813">"in interaction studies, Pioglitazon has no relevant effect on pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics of digooxin, warfarin, phenprocoumon and metformin."</seg>
<seg id="814">The simultaneous application of pioglitazone with gemfibrozil (cytochrom P450 2C8- Inhibitor) or with Rifampicin (a cytochrom P450 2C8-inductor) increases and lowers the plasma concentration of Pioglitazon (see section 4.5).</seg>

<seg id="864">"Actraphane was examined in a total of 294 patients with type 1 diabetes, where the pancreas does not produce insulin, and type 2 diabetes in which the body is unable to use insulin effectively."</seg>
<seg id="865">The study was measured after 12 weeks the concentration of a substance (glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) which indicates how well the blood sugar is set.</seg>
<seg id="866">"Actraphane led to a decrease in the HbA1c mirror, indicating that blood sugar levels were similar to another human insulin."</seg>
<seg id="867">"Actraphane should not be applied to patients, possibly hypersensitive (allergic) to human insulin (rDNA) or one of the other components."</seg>
<seg id="868">"in addition, the doses of Actraphane must be adjusted if it is administered together with a number of other medicines that may affect the blood sugar (see the complete list is the package insert)."</seg>
<seg id="869">The Committee on Medicinal Products (CHMP) concluded that the benefits of Actraphane are outweighing in the treatment of diabetes against the risks.</seg>
<seg id="870">"in October 2002, the European Commission issued a permit for the company Novo Nordisk A / S for the launch of Actraphane in the entire European Union."</seg>
<seg id="871">"pre-mixed insulin products are normally used once or twice daily, if a quick initial action is desired along with a longer lasting effect."</seg>

<seg id="876">"some patients, in which hypoglycemic reactions occurred after a change from animal to human insulin, reported that the early warning symptoms of hypoglycemia were less pronounced or different than in their previous insulin."</seg>
<seg id="877">"travelling across multiple time zones, the patient should be advised to pick up the advice of his physician, as such journeys may cause insulin and meals to be used or taken at other times."</seg>

<seg id="886">"however, hypoglycemia can develop gradually: • Light hypoglycemia can be treated by oral intake of glucose or sugary foods."</seg>
<seg id="887">• Heavy hypoglycemias with unconsciousness are treated with intramuscular or subcutaneous injection of glucagon (0.5 to 1.0 mg) by an intramuscular or subcutaneous injection of glucagon (0.5 to 1.0 mg) by an intramuscular or subcutaneous injection of glucose (0.5 to 1.0 mg).</seg>
<seg id="888">"the effect starts within half an hour, the active maximum occurs within 2 to 8 hours and the entire duration of the activity is up to 24 hours."</seg>
<seg id="889">Resorption The resorption profile lies in the fact that it is a mixture of insulin products with fast or delayed resorption.</seg>
<seg id="890">A number of splitting (hydrolysis) places on the human insulin molecule were considered; none of the metabolites formed by splitting is active.</seg>
<seg id="891">"based on conventional studies on the safety harmacology, toxicity in repeated administration, genotoxicity, to carcinogenic potential and for reproductive toxicity, the preclinical data cannot be identified for the human being."</seg>

<seg id="1894">Aflunov should be used in adults and elderly people to protect against flu caused by the strain (type) H5N1 of the influenza A virus.</seg>
<seg id="1895">This is a special type of vaccine that is supposed to protect from a trunk of the flu virus that could cause a future pandemic.</seg>
<seg id="1896">"influenza pandemic breaks out when a new trunk of the flu virus appears, which can easily be spread from human to human beings, because people still have no immunity (no protection) against it."</seg>
<seg id="1897">"after administration of the vaccine, the immune system detects the parts of the flu virus contained in the vaccine as" "physical" "and forms antibodies against it."</seg>
<seg id="1898">"in this way, the immune system will later be able to form an antibody quicker in contact with a flu virus."</seg>
<seg id="1899">"subsequently, the membrane covering of the virus with the" surface antigens "(proteins on the membrane surface, which recognizes the human body as a body-alien), was purified, cleaned and used as a component of the vaccine."</seg>

<seg id="1910">"AIDS does not cure, however, can delay the damage of the immune system and thus also the development of associated infections and diseases."</seg>
<seg id="1911">"Agenera was studied in combination with other antiviral drugs, but without Ritonavir, in two main studies with 736 HIV-infected adults who had previously not been treated with protease inhibitors."</seg>
<seg id="1912">"the drug used with low dosed Ritonavir was compared with 206 adults who used previously protease inhibitors, compared to other protease inhibitors."</seg>

<seg id="1922">The Committee on Medicinal Products (CHMP) concluded that the benefits of Ageneration in combination with other antiretroviral drugs for the treatment of HIV-1 infected adults and children over four years outweigh the risks.</seg>
<seg id="1923">"generic Agenera is usually taken together with the pharmacokinetic amplifier Ritonavir, but the committee set out that the benefit of sugars in combination with Ritonavir in patients who previously did not have protease inhibitors, is not proven."</seg>

<seg id="1970">"dosage recommendation for simultaneous administration of Amprenavir and Kaletra can not be given, but a close-meshed surveillance is recommended as the efficacy and harmlessness of this combination is not known."</seg>
<seg id="1971">"there was no pharmacokinetic study carried out in combination with Didanosin, but is recommended for at least one hour due to the antazidis component of Didanosin (see Antazida below)."</seg>
<seg id="1972">"therefore, in combination with amplavirenz in combination with amprenavir (600 mg twice daily) and Ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) no dose adaptation is required."</seg>
<seg id="1973">The treatment with Efavirenz in combination with Amprenavir and Saquinavir is not recommended as the exposure of both protease inhibitors would lower.</seg>
<seg id="1974">The effect of Nevirapin to other protease inhibitors and existing limited data suggest that Nevirapin reduces the serum concentration of amprenavir.</seg>
<seg id="1975">"if these medicines should be used at the same time, caution is advisable because Delavirdin could be less effective because of the reduced or possibly subtherapeutic plasma level."</seg>
<seg id="1976">"if these medicines are applied together, caution is required; a thorough clinical and virological monitoring should be made, since a precise predicting of the effect of the combination of amprenavir and Ritonavir on delavirdin is difficult."</seg>
<seg id="1977">The simultaneous administration of Amprenavir and Rifabutin led to an increase in plasma concentration (AUC) by Rifabutin by 193% and thus to an increase in the side effects associated with Rifabutin.</seg>
<seg id="1978">"if it is necessary for clinical reasons to administer Rifabutin along with Agenera, it is recommended to reduce the dosage of rifabutin at least half of the recommended dose, although there are no clinical data."</seg>
<seg id="1979">Pharmacokinetic studies with Agenase in combination with erythromycin have not been performed but could increase the plasma levels of both drugs in the case of simultaneous administration.</seg>
<seg id="1980">The simultaneous application of 200 mg of Fosamprenavir and 100 mg of ketoconazole once daily led to an increase in the CMAx of Ketoconazole once daily without a simultaneous application of Fosamprenavir with Ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="1981">"other medicines, which are listed below, including substrates, inhibitors or inductors of CYP3A4, may result in potentially interdependencies."</seg>

<seg id="1988">"consequently, the simultaneous administration of sugars with Ritonavir along with these glucocoids is not recommended unless the possible benefit of a treatment outweighs the risk of systemic koreanic eroid effects (see section 4.4)."</seg>
<seg id="1989">"with HMG-CoA-reductase inhibitors such as Lovastatin and Simvastatin, whose metabolisation is strongly dependent on CYP3A4, distinct increases of plasma levels are expected in concurrent administration of Agenera."</seg>
<seg id="1990">"as plasma level increases of these HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors lead to myopathy, including a rhabdomyolysis, the combined use of these drugs is not recommended with amprenavir."</seg>
<seg id="1991">"a more frequent monitoring of therapeutic concentrations is recommended to stabilize the mirror, as the plasma concentrations of Cyclosporin, Rapamycin and Tacrolimus can be increased by the simultaneous administration of amprenavir (see section 4.4)."</seg>
<seg id="1992">"therefore, Agenera must not be applied together with orally taken Midazolam (see section 4.3), while congenital Midazolam should be cautiously advisable."</seg>
<seg id="1993">Data for simultaneous use of parenteral midazolam with other protease inhibitors point to a possible increase in plasma levels from Midazolam to 3-4-fold.</seg>
<seg id="1994">"if methadone is administered together with amprenavir, patients should therefore be monitored for opium removal symptoms, especially if also low doses of Ritonavir are administered."</seg>
<seg id="1995">"because of the low reliability of historical comparisons, there is currently no recommendation to be given as the amprenavir dose is to be adjusted if amprenavir is administered at the same time with methadone."</seg>
<seg id="1996">"while offering warfarin or other oral anticoagulants together with Agenera, increased control of the INR (International Normalised Ratio) is recommended because of the possibility of weakening or reinforcing the antithrombotic effect (see section 4.4)."</seg>
