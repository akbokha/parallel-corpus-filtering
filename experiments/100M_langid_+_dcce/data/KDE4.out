&quot; package &amp; package ; includes different modules for &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; despite their small size , they offer some additional functions and simplify the use of some functions of &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; by making these easier available . &quot;
further information on the use of &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; and the built @-@ in functions can be found in the manual on &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ;
&quot; to load these modules in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or , select Settings extensions ... Open the card Tools and select the modules you want . &quot;
this is a list of standard setup modules from the package k@@ de ; add@@ ons . please note that any more modules are on your system if you have installed additional software .
&quot; you should install the k@@ de@@ base package , which contains &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or , before comp@@ iling this package . &quot;
&quot; to use the crash module , click in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; on extras stor@@ my . then you can view the page , the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; to crash , or the list of crashes , if available , delete . &quot;
the module An@@ gle Filter ( also called Ord@@ ner@@ filter ) can be reached in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; menu bar under Extras An@@ gle Filter . with the module you can filter &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; &apos; s current working directory in different ways .
&quot; to use DO@@ M tree view in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; to use , select Tools DO@@ M tree ... and open a new window with DO@@ M of the currently displayed website . as default , the display begins with the root node of the document , example : document@@ element , all other no@@ des are sub @-@ elements of this root node . &quot;
the &amp; FS@@ View module ; for &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; displays another view for objects with the MI@@ ME type in@@ ode / directory in local files . it can be used as an alternative for the different symbol and text views to view the content of your local file system .
the peculi@@ arity of &amp; FS@@ View ; consists of showing ne@@ sted folder hierarch@@ ies using a so @-@ called tree map . tree @-@ maps allow to display the size of objects in ne@@ sted structures . this size must have the property that the sum of the sizes of the subordin@@ ate objects of an object is smaller or equal to the size of the object .
&quot; with &amp; FS@@ View ; the size of a file or folder shows the size of a folder as the sum of the size of the entries is set in it . accordingly , large files , even then easily recognized , can be easily recognized if they are far below in the folder hierarchy . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; FS@@ View , a rect@@ angle that represents a file or folder in your files@@ ystem is a rect@@ angle that represents a file or folder in your file system . &quot;
&quot; the color of a rect@@ angle , which is switched over view color mode , can be either deep for easy detection of the ne@@ sting depth or the illustration of another file property , such as name , owner , group or MI@@ ME type . &quot;
&quot; a rect@@ angle can be lab@@ eled with the different properties of the respective file or folder . for each property you can specify whether it is displayed at all , or whether the area of subordin@@ ate rect@@ angle should be used ( where , therefore , the relative position of the let@@ tering is indicated in the rect@@ angle ) . &quot;
&quot; in case of Tre@@ emap in &amp; FS@@ View ; this goal is not always comp@@ lied with . in the Tre@@ emap in &amp; FS@@ View , this goal is not always kept . note that less space for the frame is lost when the rect@@ angle is square . &quot;
&quot; as division of the area of an entry is done for the subordin@@ ate entries , the implementation is left to the implementation . here , it is always advantageous for the label and avo@@ idance of space losses due to frames that are as square as possible . the best methods in this regard are rows , columns or rec@@ ur@@ sive branches . &quot;
&quot; you can specify the minimum displayed area for an entry above the menu entry View . instead , a diamond pattern is drawn into the area of the arranged entry to indicate that this area is actually occupied by a subordin@@ ate entry . &quot;
originally was &amp; FS@@ View ; used as a small test application and introduction to using the Tre@@ e@@ Map wid@@ gets designed for the application K@@ C@@ ach@@ egr@@ ind .
you can find the picture gallery in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ menu under Extras Photo Gallery ... or with Ctr@@ l ; I .

&quot; &amp; digi@@ came ; contains a fast image processing with basic image processing tools . you can use these to view , comment , evaluate and correct your photos . the processing capabilities can easily be expanded with K@@ DE Image plugins interface ( manual ) modules . &quot;
&quot; although &amp; digi@@ came ; easy to use , it provides dozens of professional skills . it works completely in 16 @-@ bit color space and all available modules support the raw conversion via li@@ bra@@ w , DNG export and ICC color management workflow . &quot;
&quot; improved database with much more metadata , such as &amp; eg ; about the camera or lens , which can be searched . &quot;
&quot; like all &amp; k@@ de ; programs is also &amp; digi@@ came ; an open source project . that means it depends on the support of the end user . therefore , you should report problems and improvements . &quot;
&quot; if you are in the program , the Help menu contains an entry problems or wishes to report .... This opens a dialogue with a under@@ lined link . if you are using this link , your web browser will open a page in the error reporting system . &quot;
&quot; and digi@@ came ; is a project that is supported by a community . that is , the user and developer will help each other . if you are a regular user of &amp; digi@@ came ; then we would like to answer any questions of other users . in this mailing list , English is spoken , you should therefore be powerful in this language . &quot;
you can also call the digi@@ m@@ ist ; homepage to visit news about shared versions and other information about &amp; digi@@ came ; to learn .
the best start to participate in &amp; digi@@ came ; to participate is the registration in the developer mailing list . instructions to report in the developer mailing list of &amp; digi@@ came ; .
&quot; when you start &amp; digi@@ came ; for the first time , you &apos;ll be asked where you want to save your images and your database . you can enter a local , remote or remote folder here . simply enter the path name or click the folder icon icon to select a folder . &quot;
&quot; in the second field , you need to specify a local folder on your computer . here , the data ab@@ n@@ k is stored . this path remains the same for all image folders . &quot;
&quot; later , you can add as many folders as you would like to add . &amp; digi@@ came ; will also be used as an aging library . &quot;
&quot; if you already have a picture collection on your hard drive , you can specify the top folder that contains pictures as a base folder . &quot;
&quot; &amp; digi@@ came ; dur@@ es recur@@ sively the library path in all its depth . you cannot exclude sub@@ folders , unless it is i@@ ste in hidden folders . &quot;
&quot; if you take an existing folder with photos as a base folder , you will notice that the albums in My Al@@ ben@@ list will not have photographs as symbols . you can change them by using any photo from the album and this will be used as an album symbol . for more details , please refer to the albums section . &quot;
&quot; once you have configured the root folder , you can set up your digital camera . then you should learn how to use My Albums and My keywords to manage your photos in the albums . &quot;
&quot; raw file support : if you use the raw mode of your camera , so &amp; digi@@ came ; maybe it &apos;s possible to handle it . if you want to find out if a special camera is supported , you will find a list of supported shell cameras in the Help shell support menu . &quot;
how to set up this and work with raw files is described in the sections Ro@@ h @-@ Decoder settings and Ro@@ h workflow .
&quot; more than 1,000 digital cameras are supported by the library g@@ photo@@ 2 . more than 1000 digital cameras are supported by the library g@@ photo@@ 2 . of course , each medium and each card reader , supported by your operating system , will work with &amp; digi@@ 2 ; together . &quot;
modern digital cameras are characterized by the use of Compact and Flash ; Memory Cards and USB or Fire@@ Wire ( IEE@@ E @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) for data transmission .
&quot; g@@ Photo@@ 2 also supports the Picture Transfer Protocol , a widely used protocol developed by the International Imaging Industry Association . g@@ Photo@@ 2 also supports the transmission of images from digital cameras to computers and other peripher@@ als without the need for additional drivers . &quot;
&quot; many old digital cameras are using the serial interface for their communication with the computer . as photos in general are large files and tran@@ smissions via the serial port are slow , this connection is now obsol@@ ete . &quot;
&quot; lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 has to have been created with li@@ be@@ x@@ if support to read the preview images of digi@@ K@@ am reliably . if the Exif support is not available in lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 , you may be able to see thumb@@ nails or the creation could be very slow . &quot;
one of the most beautiful things at &amp; digi@@ came ; is how easy it can expand its functionality by modules :
&quot; K@@ IP@@ I modules : the K@@ DE Image plugins Interface Project ( manual ) is an approach to develop a common module structure for &amp; digi@@ came ; , K@@ Photo@@ Album , Sho@@ wi@@ mg and G@@ wen@@ view . the goal is to provide the modules for all graphics programs . the settings for the K@@ IP@@ I modules are described in this section . &quot;
&quot; modules can manipul@@ ate images in virtually any way , as it can also be a user . their advantage is that it is much easier , &amp; digi@@ came ; by writing a small module to add a function as the changes in &amp; digi@@ came ; themselves . &quot;
&quot; to simplify the window , you can either remove the page bars with &amp; L@@ MB ; remove or switch in full screen mode with F@@ 11 or Ctr@@ l + Shift + F . &quot;
&quot; drag and drop images works everywhere : you can place an image in another part of the Al@@ ben@@ tree , above the horizontal divi@@ ding line or in another application window . the only restriction is that a picture is not in terms of keywords , data list or search . &quot;
&quot; - a file selection allows you to exit the most common : JPEG , PNG , TIFF , Ro@@ h , movies and audio &quot;
&quot; the text filter is used only for the fields used in the symbol view . thus , the filter on the file name is displayed only if this ind &apos;s symbol view is displayed . which fields can be displayed in the dialog of the setting settings . &quot;
&quot; view &amp; quot ; My Al@@ ben@@ li@@ ste@@ quot ; provides an organized view of your photo albums . all photos , which were saved by &amp; digi@@ came ; after the name of their collection , are sorted by the name of their collection in the al@@ ps properties or after the date that the album was first created , sorted . the date can be changed in the properties of the album . &quot;
&quot; if you have set up a scanner , you can also scan a photo directly into an album . &quot;
&quot; to copy or move an image from an album to another , you can move the photo with the mouse onto the target album and drop it down . you can move or copy several photos on the same way . simply select all photos and move them to the target album . &quot;
&quot; an album contains a collection of photos and the album properties allow you to enter information about this collection . to access the album properties , you must click on the album and edit album properties in the context menu . &quot;
&quot; Alb@@ um@@ - Coll@@ ections : are a method to highlight your albums , so that you can be group@@ ed by a common name . if you want to add or delete new collections , you can make this in the settings for collections . &quot;
the Album Date : will be used when you sort your albums by date with view albums by date .
&quot; the El@@ ders , average , new test@@ ers : they set the date on the oldest , the most recent picture or that of the average of the album . first , the average of the images from their EX@@ IF information is first attempted . if this fails , the date of the last modification of each file is used in this folder . &quot;
&quot; if you first have an album in &amp; digi@@ kam ; open the first picture in the album as a symbol for the &amp; quot ; My Al@@ ben@@ li@@ ste@@ quot ; chosen , this will help you to remember the photos in the album . sometimes the first photo in the album is not representative and you might want to select another photo as a symbol . &quot;
&quot; in order to select another photo as an album icon , you must click the image with the right mouse button and in the context menu &amp; quot ; Select as album preview . additionally , you can drag the photo to the album in the list to set it as a symbol . &quot;
an album can always be included in a collection and collections cannot be desp@@ ised .
&quot; the collection collections have a different effect . the collection includes all photos of the album . of course , you can use both methods to organize your photos . &quot;
&quot; the picture window provides you with the main view of your photos . if you select an album , all pictures are displayed in this album in the image window . each photo is displayed in a preview , you can customize the size of these preview using the two magni@@ fying buttons in the toolbar . &quot;
&quot; when you open an album the first time , you need to wait shortly , while the thumb@@ nails will be generated . you can avoid this in which you can re@@ produce all thumb@@ nails in the Tools menu . &quot;
&quot; information about each image is displayed below the corresponding preview . what information is this , you can digi@@ p@@ ate about settings . select the albums page and adjust the thumb@@ nails to your wishes . &quot;
the thumb@@ nails feature help windows that appear . if you leave the mouse cursor a moment over a picture . the help shows the most important features including all the keywords of a photo . the screen@@ shot above in the section introduction to the main window displays such an help window .
&quot; photos and keywords allow you to organize your pictures as it suits you . the image processing shows your photos and allows you to create a number of improvements to this . you can select all the functions that are available with &amp; digi@@ came ; you can choose between the viewing of the images , a slide show or editing the pictures . &quot;
&quot; you can open image editing with a photo by clicking either F@@ 4 Image Edit ... or the context menu of the image with the right mouse button , and edit ... &quot;
&quot; it may happen that &amp; digi@@ arrived ; the functionality you need is not provided . you can open a photo in another program by opening the context menu with the right mouse button and select the program from the sub@@ menu of the file type . to do this , and how to customize it to your needs if your program is not listed , find information in &amp; k@@ de ; manual . &quot;
&quot; you should note that after processing other image processing programs can occur with the metadata contained in the image . some programs do not save this data when you save the modified image . thus , this information is lost from the EX@@ IF@@ - and IP@@ TC data , such as orientation , aper@@ ture , etc . &quot;
&quot; the simpl@@ est is to click on the thumb@@ nail to preview and rotate . in the sub @-@ menu , you can specify the degree of rotation . &quot;
&quot; to change the file name of a photo , right click on the preview and select F2 Ren@@ ame from the context menu . note that you have the extension ( .jpg , .@@ tif , &amp; etc ; ) . &quot;
&quot; if you delete a photo from &amp; digi@@ kam , it will be moved into the m@@ ash bin of &amp; k@@ de ; move . F@@ 8 Photo Del@@ ete or Del@@ ete If you prefer to really delete , you can use this by using Shift ; Del@@ ete . &quot;
&quot; the View &amp; quot ; My Dat@@ um@@ sli@@ ste@@ quot ; organiz@@ es your photos on the basis of the data . &amp; digi@@ came ; use either the EX@@ IF date or , if it is not available , the date of last modification of the file . &quot;
&quot; if you select a month from the list , all photos of this month will be displayed in the picture view . you can select days or weeks in the data sheet below in the data review so that you can only show the photos of the selected days . &quot;
photos with keywords provide a flexible and powerful way to organize and catalogue your photos . tags are sti@@ ckers which can be assigned to individual photos or whole groups . once a keyword has been assigned to a photo the photo can be found by selecting this keyword or a search .
&quot; if a keyword is selected , all the photos marked with this keyword will be displayed . &quot;
&quot; tags can be sorted in a hierarch@@ ical tree . this allows you to organize your keywords log@@ ically . you can also make parts of the tree &amp; quot ; My keywords li@@ ste@@ quot ; to fold , so you can easily find the keywords you are looking for . &quot;
&quot; the keywords are stored in a database for quick access and assigned keyword in the IP@@ TC data fields of the image , at least for JPEG , so you can re @-@ import your keywords in other programs . &quot;
&quot; you can add new keywords by clicking with the right mouse button , either on &amp; quot ; My keywords . &quot;
&quot; you can delete a keyword by clicking on the keyword with the right mouse button and del@@ eting . if you delete a keyword , the photo itself will not be deleted . only the keyword will be removed from this photo . &quot;
you can change the position of a keyword by drag@@ ging it to the desired position in the tree and place there . then a menu that gives you the possibility to move the keyword . a keyword can only be in the tree at a time .
you can change the properties of a keyword by clicking on the right mouse button and edit the keyword in the context menu . you can change the keyword name and the icon in the tree &amp; quot ; My keywords .
&quot; to select another photo as an album icon , select the image with the right mouse button and select as album preview . in addition , you can drag the photo to the album in the list to set it as a symbol . &quot;
&quot; if you have selected the photos you want to use with a keyword , you can click on the appropriate keyword in the tree &amp; quot ; drag and drop them . alternatively , you can select them with the right mouse button on the preview of the pictures and select keyword sel@@ ections from the contex@@ tual menu . &quot;
&quot; you can select a photo with any number keywords . the photo is displayed as soon as you select one of the keywords to it assigned keywords . this way , you can assign a keyword for each person on a photo , one for the place where the photo was made , one for the event where it was made etc . &quot;
&quot; once you have provided a photo with keywords , it will appear in the main window under the preview of the image . &quot;
&quot; you can delete a keyword , in which you can select the context menu of the photo with the right mouse button and remove from the keywords menu . the menu only displays the keywords assigned to the photo . &quot;
&quot; the tim@@ eline view shows a time @-@ dependent hist@@ ogram of the number of images per time unit . a selection frame can be moved through this hist@@ ogram . in order to select a time frame , you only have to click on the bottom rect@@ angle of the dial frame which displays the time unit . thus , all related images are displayed in the main window . &quot;
in the field below you can enter a title and save your selection . it will then appear in the list below .
&quot; include all elements of the database : names , ratings , keywords , keywords , albums , collections , date stamps and in the future even more . &quot;
&quot; if you click here , the filtering will be deleted and all images are displayed again . if the search has nothing found , then the lamp will be red . &quot;
&quot; the advanced search tool is hidden in the tab in the left side@@ bar with the bin@@ o@@ cul@@ ars . if you open this , you can save a simple search box as described above . &quot;
&quot; if you are satisfied with your selection , press the OK button and the search is done . the results will be displayed in my search list in the main window . if you want to change your search again , you only need to select the corresponding entry from my search list and select an option in its context menu . &quot;
&quot; for more information , see The Tools for Advanced Search . &quot;
&quot; if you want to delete an existing search from the list , select Search in the context menu . &quot;
&quot; the Advanced Search will provide you with an expanded search form with many search parameters , which you can search in certain fields of &amp; digi@@ came ; s database . &quot;
&quot; the list of the search rules is used to set the options for a search query in the album database . all rules are displayed in line by operators . each option can be added to the search group / search group . each option can be added to the search group / search group . in addition , you can add Search of Type &amp; quot ; AND NI@@ CH@@ T@@ quot ; . &quot;
&quot; the smaller the difference between two sig@@ natures , the more they correspond . this technique is applied in three areas . &quot;
&quot; similar entries : this is an area in which you can drop every picture to find a similar one . by means of a sw@@ ell@@ ert , the result selection can be enlarged or res@@ ized . if you push a picture from somewhere over the icon of un@@ seen search in the left side@@ bar , then it will open and you can drop it there . &quot;
sket@@ ch : hand @-@ hand sket@@ ch : draw a fast sket@@ ch and &amp; digi@@ came ; finds the right pictures . even here a threshold value can be set .
this tab provides an intuitive map search tool based on the Mar@@ ble Mini@@ program . you can move it in or out with the mouse wheel . press Ctr@@ l ; left mouse button to move a square . all images within these coordinates are fil@@ tered and displayed .
in the field below you can specify a name for your ge@@ o filter . this will then be added for later use of the list below . it works like a live Geo@@ Fol@@ der .
&quot; &amp; digi@@ came ; provides a lumin@@ aire in a separate window with which you can easily compare images . it works with all supported image file formats , including raw files . &quot;
select one or more images from any view in the main window and then use Ctr@@ l ; L D@@ em illuminated button from the context menu .
&quot; from the preview panel , you can drag and drop the images you want to compare in the left or right pane of the window . if you preview images from the toolbar and perform the zoo or im@@ position operations on one of the images , then you will be able to compare the same area of the two images . &quot;
&quot; another mode is better suited to select from a series of images . when you navigate from the toolbar , the two first images will be automatically loaded into the areas of the same image . the right adjacent image is displayed in the right pane . this simpli@@ fies it through a series of similar images . &quot;
&quot; of course , the normal dele@@ tion actions also work directly from the lumin@@ aire , e.g. F@@ 4 file Edit ... &quot;
&quot; all image information from the right side@@ bar of the main window is available for both preview images in the lumin@@ aire . for example , this makes it easy to connect visual differences with exposure data . &quot;
&quot; in the lower end of each section you will find a built @-@ in swivel function , which you can see on the crossed arrows . &quot;
zoom Zoom works just like in other views . simply use the zoom knob under the images or Ctr@@ l ; mouse wheel to zoom into the image and zoom out . this happens in both pictures when you preview in the mode Preview .
&quot; what is a digital inventory management - apart from the fashion word ? digital inventory management considers any part of the process followed after the image has been taken up to the final issue and permanent storage . each of the photos records , sc@@ ans or digital photos stores a form of digital inventory management . most of us do not do this in a systematic and efficient way . &quot;
&quot; we give you a tool , a plan and practical tips on how to back up your pictures , find , protect , and use photos again . we will focus on the process for digital photographers die &amp; digi@@ kam ; use . we consider downloading , ren@@ aming , backup , re@@ group@@ ing , archiving , optimi@@ zing , maintenance , and ex@@ porting image files . &quot;
&quot; &amp; quot ; Digital inventory management takes up , index@@ ed , categ@@ orized , sec@@ ures , searches , transformed , conf@@ ected , and exports content that have a mon@@ et@@ arian or cultural value . &quot;
metadata is defined as data on data . metadata is stored in accordance with your definition data that provide information on or a documentation of other data that are managed by an application or environment .
&quot; if you don &apos;t even know how many photos you have , then you don &apos;t need to find a specific photo without inventory administration . if you don &apos;t even know how many photos you have , then use it certainly not &amp; digi@@ came ; . the approach to store metadata both in a database as well as in the image files guarantees very fast searches and secure archiving that you can freely access with other programs , platforms and formats . &quot;
&quot; the first thing you need to do and know before you want to incorporate anything into your system is the structure of information structure in contrast to data structure . you must decide to have other access to your photos , whether you want to save them to a reserved drive , or on a network drive &amp; etc . note that you have to switch to a bigger drive some@@ time . &quot;
&quot; if you have enough photos , then you will be able to organize sub@@ folders such as &amp; eg ; 2008 @-@ 01 , 2008 @-@ 02 &amp; etc ; use . export is then a folder for images you can print or publish on a website . &quot;
&quot; professional photographers have other requirements such as version@@ ing photos , archiving , workflow , constant supply of images on different themes and a large number of everything . within 10 years 95 % archives and 5 % work files will not want to re@@ organize your structure for this content . &quot;
which types of files fit together ? the separation of file types makes the batch processing easier . separate new from old files .
the separation of original and work files simpli@@ fies a backup strategy and migration . you will always know if you are looking for an original or a deri@@ v@@ ative image .
&quot; we also recommend the option to store metadata in the settings page of the metadata in &amp; digi@@ came ; this ensures that EX@@ IF@@ - and IP@@ TC data can be written to the file . if you forget this , then you can subsequently save the metadata from the database in the files by selecting the corresponding item from the menu . &quot;
&quot; now you have a lot of information in your database , but what happens if you want to change which changes ? &quot;
&quot; now the real work starts , as you should now select every photo keywords , lab@@ eling and a rating . of course , you can choose all the images that need the same attribute and then set the value . this makes sense as you can concentrate on the best photos at the next work . &quot;
all three are syn@@ ony@@ ms for the same thing .
&quot; when you import cat@@ alo@@ gu@@ ed images from another source with embedded keywords , then &amp; digi@@ came ; automatically mount the tree for you and paste the images to the right place . changing the hierarchy within the tree is not a problem and can easily be done by drag@@ ging a sub @-@ tree to another . &quot;
&quot; this is a very coar@@ se representation , since each block of metadata is in truth from many sections . fil@@ en@@ ames and calendar data are features of all images . &quot;
&quot; enough of the keywords - the next section refers to cap@@ tions or comments , the third important tool to cat@@ alog@@ ize your metadata . &quot;
&quot; you don &apos;t want to let anyone know your photos just , you want to share them with your friends , your family , other photographers and agencies . &quot;
&quot; look at this panorama . from af@@ ar it is not even a beautiful beach panorama . if you look at it closer , then you start to see some details , people , the place . &quot;
&quot; and now I tell you that this is the landing field of the Al@@ lies &amp; quot ; O@@ ma@@ ha Beach@@ quot ; in French Nor@@ mand@@ y 60 years after landing . wow ! you start to dream associations , you may even hear silence . so the inscription has changed your perception of this panorama . &quot;
&quot; for others who look at your photos , the title may be more important than the image itself to create an interest . if you show pictures you should commit a story . remember , the key is to convey the meaning to the viewer to help him understand what you understand . &quot;
it is fine if an image is not perfect if it has the strength only to work with a label for itself alone .
&quot; you can even set it for a selection of images at the same time . if you export your images to web galleries , you can even export it for a selection of pictures at the same time . &quot;
&quot; remember the times before GPS ? when you had to find another town without navigation system ? was it not Earth a boring planet in front of Goo@@ g@@ le@@ Earth ? well , because with pictures the train of the spatial presentation continues with speed of light . &quot;
&quot; the possibilities to use ge@@ ol@@ ocation are already inn@@ umer@@ able and will still be deep@@ ened in the future . I am sure that one day , in the near future , you can also export to G@@ aller@@ y@@ 2 , Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web , Fli@@ ck@@ r &amp; etc ; with the Goo@@ g@@ le@@ Maps Viewer . &quot;
&quot; copy@@ left is a word play with copyright and design@@ ates the practice of using copy@@ rights to remove restrictions on the distribution and modification of copies . the same fre@@ edoms are also valid in all amended versions , so also for the works of others . &quot;
the following description tells you which information in the setup page of &amp; digi@@ came ; as information should be depos@@ ited :
&quot; author ( syn@@ onym for creator and author ) : this field should include your name , or the name of the person who has created the photo , for example , to use the name of the photographer , for example , to use the name of the photographer , then the name of a company or organization may not be changed . this field does not support either comm@@ as or sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ ons as separ@@ ator . &quot;
&quot; author title ( syn@@ onym for fas@@ cia line ) : associated with the author . this field contains the work name of the photographer . examples for this can be titles such as : photographer , freel@@ ance photographer or independent commercial photographer . since this is a reference to the author field , this must be completed as well . &quot;
&quot; if the photographer is working for a news agency such as Reu@@ ters or Associ@@ ated Press , these organizations can be listed here that offers the picture to others . if the picture is a bearing photo , then the group / agency that offers the picture will be shown here . &quot;
&quot; for individuals , this is very important for most of your photos . for individuals , this protection is very important to the majority of your photos . for professionals and semi @-@ professionals , this protection is very important . &quot;
the digital water@@ mark is unique per picture . &amp; digi@@ came ; will provide such a module for batch processing in the near future .

&quot; of course , we don &apos;t talk about CDs that have been lost on the street or a fire . this kind of losses are the same ones that can also happen to you in traditional paper photos or neg@@ atives . in this section , it is about problems with the so @-@ called new media . &quot;
&quot; K@@ roll on@@ Track , the largest data recovery company in the world , has some interesting statistics which causes a loss of data . &quot;
&quot; to fight the problem with CDs / DVDs , these must be treated cau@@ tious and you can no longer trust you than a few years . of course you can also buy CDs and DVDs in archive quality which claim a lifetime of 100 years for yourself . whether you believe it is in your discretion space . &quot;
&quot; CD / DVD discs can be un@@ readable , but you can reduce this risk in which you can use good discs and good recording devices and store them in the right way . the best DVD Record Devices are not much more expensive than the cheapest , but you write much more reliable . &quot;
&quot; 75 % of the data are only effective data , the rest we need for format@@ ting and control sums . despite this massive protection it is used by chemical aging , ultra@@ violet light , scrat@@ ches , dust , etc . &quot;
&quot; for defective CDs and DVDs , there is an inexpensive program called I@@ so@@ Bu@@ ster that seems to work wonders with CDs and DVDs . it runs under Windows and &amp; Linux , but is not yet available for Mac@@ s . there are similar applications to read damaged data from damaged disks , hard drives , flash drives , USB drives , etc . &quot;
optical media : Blu @-@ ray Dis@@ ks seem to win the format war against HD DVD . a dual layer Blu @-@ ray disc can save 50 GB and thus almost six times the capacity of a dual layer DVD with 8.5 GB .
&quot; do not forget to copy the data to the next generation of media . do not forget to copy the data to the next generation of media , before reading the last piece of hardware or software that can read these media . &quot;
&quot; your manufacturer &apos;s warran@@ ties include a new disk , but not data . &quot;
&quot; in short : disks keep the longest if they are operated in the temperature range from 35 ° C to 45 ° C . some of the controllers are the most common error cause , SMAR@@ T cannot determine the im@@ pending failure . &quot;
&quot; this is only the complete loss due to over@@ voltage . of course , you can also loss data loss due to a power loss before you have secured the files , but these losses can normally be recovered without major problems . &quot;
&quot; while most electrical appliances are not so much , this can cause serious damage to devices with computer chips and high @-@ speed processors . thus , these an@@ om@@ ali@@ es can cause serious damage , complete data loss , hardware alter@@ ation , destroyed mother@@ boards and other defects . so protect yourself from the unavoid@@ able that leads to a loss of time and money . &quot;
&quot; the most widespread protection against current tips is an over@@ voltage protection . this is a device that absor@@ bs part of the energy heat and det@@ ects the rest . however , it is usually available in the form of a connector bar . &quot;
&quot; if you are looking for an over@@ voltage protection , then you should ensure that it fulfil@@ s the UL 14@@ 49 standard . this guarantees a certain minimum of protection . &quot;
&quot; as an over@@ voltage of any cable can be used to your computer , you should ensure that even all peripher@@ als connected to your system are protected . some manufacturers provide over@@ voltage distribution , which also includes a telephone connection for your modem . others offer connectivity options for the co@@ axial cable of the cable mode@@ ms and the TV card . &quot;
&quot; if you have a not@@ ebook , you will need a portable over@@ voltage protection . a variety of these devices are specially developed for not@@ ebooks and therefore very small and you also include protection for the modem . &quot;
&quot; while an over@@ voltage protection protects your system from smaller fluctu@@ ations in the power lines , it will not really help you in a complete failure . even a failure of a few seconds can lead to the loss of irre@@ plac@@ eable data . it can therefore make sense to invest in a non @-@ stop power supply . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the protection against over@@ voltage , these devices can automatically adjust battery energy when a power out@@ age occurs . some models allow them to continue to work down until the current is running . furthermore , the lifetime of the battery and the accompanying software is interesting . &quot;
&quot; consider the potential risk that your computer system is exposed and and compare its security in current problems with the cost to avoid this . a high quality over@@ voltage protection can take you up to &amp; euro ; 40 . this is just a small price difference if you consider how well your computer is protected with it . at the end , you should always remember all cables before you go to vacation . &quot;
&quot; the Amazon Web service includes S3 - Sim@@ ple Storage Service - a simple storage service . with the right configuration , you can use it as a drive under &amp; Linux ; , Mac , and Windows . Google shared storage is another popular offer to store any amount of data . &quot;
&quot; however , they are expensive compared to the hard drives at home but very expensive - 40 GB cost &amp; dollar ; 75 per year and 400 GB cost &amp; dollar ; 500 . in addition , you need to send the data via the compar@@ atively slow internet . &quot;
&quot; the solutions are therefore only suitable as a solution against a local data loss of the most important images . this is not a bad solution , but it is not a general backup solution . &quot;
&quot; Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web ( Google ) , Fli@@ ck@@ r ( Yahoo ) and the photo community 23@@ h@@ q@@ .com make online storage services available on photos . your free memory is limited to 1 GB and you will not want to have your pictures in full resolution online . &quot;
&quot; from the point of view of data backup , the web solutions are very secure . transmission errors are automatically cleaned thanks to the TCP protocol and with the large companies it is included in the offer a backup and a distributed storage . &quot;
the diagram illustrates the elements of the transmission chain in the machine . all transfers are sus@@ cep@@ tible to transmission errors . the file system Z@@ FS and B@@ tr@@ fs at least ensure data integrity between operating system and hard drive .
&quot; the worst thing is that nobody tells you when a transmission error occurred , not when it occurred in your hardware . &quot;
un@@ reliable power supplies are another source of transmission losses as they generate inter@@ mitt@@ ances within the data streams . in normal files@@ ystems these errors remain un@@ noticed .
&quot; even if you are not particularly affected by transmission problems , you should look into the future . already in 2010 you will see thousands of mistakes per year . &quot;
&quot; it is open source , with many patents and is available under a GPL @-@ compatible license for Solaris and Leopard . we can only hope that it is soon also available for Linux and Windows . please read this article in English . &quot;
Oracle has launched an own initiative with its B@@ tr@@ f file system . it is still in alpha @-@ status . it uses the same protection mechanisms that Z@@ FS is used and is also available for Linux ; it is still not part of the kernel .
do not under@@ estimate this ! these two factors are responsible for 86 % of data loss at the not@@ ebook and 46 % in the work@@ station systems .
&quot; data loss due to viruses is less common than most of the most . it causes less damage , such as theft or new installations . and it is currently limited to Microsoft systems ; Apple users only know very few viruses and under &amp; Linux ; no longer has been spot@@ ted for a long time . &quot;
&quot; open source file systems are less sus@@ cep@@ tible to data loss as proprietary systems : wrong , NT@@ FS is minimal better than ext@@ 3 , Reiser@@ FS , J@@ FS and X@@ FS to name the common file systems . &quot;
&quot; journ@@ aling files@@ ystems prevent corrupt data and data loss : incorrect , only the speed of the investigation process during a sudden stop during surgery is higher and an un@@ defined status is avoided . however , if a file was not completely stored before the problem occurred , it is lost . &quot;
&quot; viruses are the biggest threat to digital data : wrong , theft and human errors are the main causes of data loss . &quot;
sensors from digital cameras are 1 @-@ 2 aper@@ ture settings from fundamental physical limits . it is meant that while the technology is further developed there is a natural limit for this progress . sensitivity and noise characteristic for all types of light sensors are not far away from this limit .
&quot; today &apos;s cameras go towards 10 meg@@ api@@ xel sensors . even if this resolution is too high for compact cameras and the end result , the optimum for compact cameras . even DSLR cameras have your limit at 10 @-@ 12 meg@@ api@@ x@@ els . for higher resolutions you need a full @-@ format sensor ( 24x@@ 36@@ mm ) or larger formats . &quot;
&quot; 6 % of all PCs are affected by a data loss every year . so secure your data often according to a plan and test this backup before you do anything more dangerous than installing your operating system , replacing disks or res@@ izing disks . &quot;
&quot; suppose you make daily your f@@ uses on an external SATA drive . if , then one day , a lightning strikes you luck if the drive was not connected at the moment . &quot;
&quot; a disaster strikes local and destro@@ ys a lot . forget aviation gap : fire , water , electricity , children and theft are dangerous for your data . they usually concern a whole room or the complete house . &quot;
&quot; therefore , your aster@@ isk is always a non @-@ local storage . bring your back@@ ups up the stairs to the neighboring house , into your office or a similar . &quot;
&quot; there is another advantage of physical separation : as mentioned above , a common reason for a data loss despite backing the panic . if you have a backup that is not available immediately , then you can save that one day . &quot;
complete backup : a complete backup of all files to be backed up . it is a snap@@ shot without history and represents a complete copy at a time .
differential Backup : a backup of the files that have been changed since the last complete backup . this creates a complete snap@@ shot of two time points : one of the complete backup and the last differential backup .
incre@@ mental backup : a backup of the files that have been changed since last backup . you can restore the original status at any time when such a backup has been made .
r@@ sync is a wonderful little tool that you can easily set up on your machines . unlike script @-@ controlled FTP sessions or other types of file transfer scripts r@@ sync only copies the difference between files that were really changed . this happens compressed and if you want to increase security over ss@@ h .
secure important images directly after you have stored them on your computer onto a DVD or another optical medium .
&quot; at the same time , you have a complete daily version of the last 7 @-@ 14 days , a weekly snap@@ shot for at least one month and a snap@@ shot for every month . &quot;
&quot; metadata , stored in the image file stored IP@@ TC information , associated X@@ MP files , original retained , memory , scal@@ ability , media , re@@ inv@@ enting images and metadata , copy images to the next generation of media , applications , operating systems , virtualization , vision devices , ... , use of the Internet . &quot;
&quot; thus valuable images survive the next 40 years , that is about the time span in which you really are interested in you because they remind you of your childhood and youth , there are two strategies that should be considered : &quot;
&quot; as the future is un@@ predic@@ table due to your nature , you need to look at everything today with caution and re@@ assess the time . unfortunately , there is no other option than the current system backward compatible . the less variations you have used in the past , the easier it is to evaluate the issues of the future . &quot;
this question should actually be answered by explanations in this document . use or switch to open standards that are supported by many applications .
&quot; virtualization is now available for everyone . so if you have an old system that is important for reading your pictures , then keep it up and install it in a virtual machine for later use . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , the Council is quite simple : every time you change your computer architecture , memory and backup technology , or your file format , you should check your library and if necessary to convert to a newer standard . stay in open standards . &quot;
scal@@ ability is the specialist expression for the possibility to change a system in its size . this actually means increasing .
let &apos;s assume that you have planned scal@@ ability and the area you want to enlarge on a dedicated disk or partition . for * nix systems like &amp; Linux ; you can copy this area and reloc@@ ate to a new disk :
&quot; check with the command d@@ mes@@ g if your new record was detected by the system , but don &apos;t hang them . &quot;
&quot; &amp; dollar ; dd if = / dev / s@@ db &#91; # &#93; of = / dev / s@@ db , the new record is / dev / s@@ db , the new record is / dev / sd@@ c &amp; dollar ; Part@@ ed res@@ ize / dev / sd@@ c@@ 1 0 &amp; lt ; res@@ iz@@ e@@ 2@@ fs / dev / sad@@ c@@ 1 # change the size of the tour if necessary &quot;
&quot; open source standards have the big advantage of an open specification . even if one day does not exist any software you can read , then you can create it yourself . this task will be easier from year to year . &quot;
&quot; GIF is a proprietary , patented format that slowly dis@@ appears from the market . therefore , you should not use it anymore . &quot;
&quot; PNG can store gam@@ ma@@ - and Chrom@@ ati@@ city data for improved color assignments at hetero@@ geneous platforms . the dis@@ advantage is that there is relative many administrative information , but not as many as TIFF requires and has a slow compression . &quot;
&quot; TIFF was widely used as picture format . TIFF can be saved in un@@ compressed form or in a container with a los@@ s@@ less compression algorithm ( DE@@ FL@@ ATE ) . however , a problem is that this format has been adapted by many people . there are therefore more than 50 different types and not all applications can work with all types . &quot;
DNG The Digital Neg@@ ative File Format is a licensed and open raw image format developed by Adobe Systems . DNG was developed by Adobe Systems . it is based on the TIFF / EP format and is committed to using metadata .
&quot; this may be one of the reasons why , in 2001 , Adobe has introduced its XML @-@ based X@@ MP technology to embed the &amp; quot ; image@@ resource block quot ; technology of the n@@ ine@@ ties ; the file information is stored with the extension &amp; quot ; .@@ x@@ mp@@ quot ; stored for XML / R@@ DF . &quot;
&quot; many photographers prefer to archive it before an original of your recording , mostly in the raw format . X@@ MP adap@@ ts because it stores metadata separately from the image file . so you should think about whether you use DNG as a container and put everything together . &quot;
&quot; the Dublin Core Metad@@ ata Initiative is an open organisation dedicated to fully compatible online metadata standards supporting a wide range of applications and business models , annual conferences and workshops , standard connections and educational efforts to achieve extensive acceptance of metadata standards and practices . &quot;
&quot; import images from the camera , the card reader or the scanner . as long as the images on the camera are edited , you can use this as a temporary backup . &quot;
convert raw files to DNG and save them in your raw archive . this function is not yet implemented .
&quot; for fine @-@ lay@@ ered editing , you can use external programs . if you re@@ write the images again , then you should add the metadata again . &quot;
&quot; protect the processed images for copyright with a digital water@@ mark . export them into web galleries , code in MPEG , use in contact sheets , print &amp; etc ; &quot;
&quot; the camera interface is not the only way to get your photos in &amp; digi@@ came ; see a description of how you can add photos that you already have on your hard disk . however , the camera interface provides you with many advanced settings for im@@ porting images to your album database . &quot;
&quot; to use your digital camera with &amp; digi@@ arrived , connect it to the computer , switch the camera to display mode and turn on . another description can be found in the manual of your camera . &quot;
&quot; some cameras do not display thumb@@ nails at the bottom of the camera . some cameras do not display thumb@@ nails . if this is the case , the filename and a symbol for file association settings are displayed for each file , photos , movies , music etc. on the camera . &quot;
&quot; before you download the photos on your computer , you may need the camera information for each entry . with the features and metadata from the camera interface , you can see the properties of an entry and its metadata . &quot;
this dialog shows file properties and photo information to be stored internally from the camera . a symbol indicates that the image has not yet been downloaded to your computer . note that in some digital cameras not all information is available .
&quot; the tab metadata displays the internal metadata , such as Exif , manufacturer &apos;s notice , GPS etc. of the image . this information is the same as with the metadata side@@ bar from the main window of &amp; digi@@ came ; or image processing . note that this metadata is not available in some digital cameras . &quot;
the easiest way to download photos on your computer is the click on the download button and then download the selection of all .
&quot; if you don &apos;t want to download all photos , you can only select the desired with the standard selection methods from &amp; k@@ de ; select the download button and then Sel@@ ected Sel@@ ected . the Sel@@ ected button will be downloaded as long as you selected some photos . &quot;
&quot; if your camera supports this , an option New download is available . these images have not yet been downloaded from &amp; digi@@ came ; in this case the new images are downloaded with a star in the preview window . if you choose this option , only the new images will be downloaded . &quot;
&quot; if you want to download the buttons All or select Sel@@ ected folders , a dialog with which you can select the target album , displayed in the My Albums tab . then select the target album from the list and press OK . &quot;
&quot; after you have selected the target album , press OK , and &amp; digi@@ came ; loads the photos from the camera to the album . &quot;
&quot; once you have downloaded the desired photos , you can delete them from the camera . &quot;
&quot; please note that there is no way to restore photos that you deleted from the camera . so you should carefully check if the photos are successfully deleted from the camera . if you want to delete them from the camera . if you want to delete them from the camera . if you want to completely delete the camera , this is much faster . &quot;
&quot; the file names are usually re@@ used after the photos were deleted from the camera . this can be useful , the date and time when the image has been made to integrate into the filename . &quot;
&quot; in the next section , you will find options for turning and mir@@ r@@ oring the image and for date @-@ based signature . if you use this latter option , a folder will be created per day . &quot;
&quot; the options Dur@@ ing the transfer opens three other options to be performed before the photos are stored on the disk . if you select this , the corresponding entries are copied from the Exif information to the IP@@ TC fields . with the last option you can correct date &amp; time for all downloaded pictures . &quot;
&quot; if you wish to use another date format as the default format , you can use the pre@@ fix fot@@ o- % Y@@ - % m@@ - % d % H : % M : % S . for further adjustments you should read the command str@@ f@@ time . &quot;
&quot; if you use the option of camera file names , you have the option to download the filename in lo@@ wer@@ case . or in upper@@ case if you prefer this . &quot;
&quot; the new file name , the &amp; digi@@ came ; used for a photo , is displayed below the name that the camera is available in the preview . your settings for ren@@ aming are saved and automatically used if you open the next time the camera window . &quot;
&quot; &amp; digi@@ came ; can use all the information about the orientation of the camera at the time point of recording to perform an automatic rotation during the download . not all cameras provide this information . in the page side@@ bar metadata , you can read more details about the information that your camera embedded in the photo . &quot;
&quot; automatic rotation is usually switched on , and if your camera does not supply this information , the photo in its original orientation . if you want to turn off the automatic rotation , use the Advanced button and select the automatic rotation in the bottom of the window . &quot;
&quot; when your camera provides information about the date that the photo was made available , it can be used to automatically download sub@@ scriptions on the target album . not all cameras provide this information . &quot;
&quot; this option is usually switched off , and in this case , &amp; digi@@ came ; the photos directly in the target album . if you want to change this , you need to switch this option . use the Advanced tab and select the date @-@ based signature at the bottom of the window . &quot;
the easiest way to load photos from your computer to your camera is the button Download . then select Upload . the file selection dialog &amp; k@@ de ; appears where you can select the files that are to be uploaded . you can also select more than one file with the standard &amp; k@@ de ; methods .
&quot; after the image selection is done , asks &amp; digi@@ arrived ; you where the images should be uploaded . a folder selection dialog for the camera appears . select the desired folder here and press OK to start up@@ loading . the images will not be deleted from your computer . &quot;
&quot; GPS ( Global Posi@@ tioning System ) is used as a general term in this document . thus , a position which is indicated in length and width gra@@ ds and which can be displayed on a map . determining the data can be performed by the American GPS , the Russian GLO@@ NAS , the European GAL@@ I@@ LE@@ O or any other system . &quot;
&quot; not only for professional photographers , it can be interesting to link a picture with a precise geographical location . not everyone uses a plane to mapping an area by automatic recording of the GPS data . environment planners , military , police , architecture offices and real estate agents can use this capability . &quot;
&quot; if you have forgotten later where exactly the photo was made , you can open a browser that shows the area . if you want to send a postcard to another &amp; digi@@ ous ; users who want to document the location of the photos , or simply want to document this aspect , it is good to store the position data of a photo . &quot;
&quot; the question is , how do the GPS data come into the picture ? first , you should know that ex@@ i@@ 2 supports many GPS data fields such as direction , saddle and map references . &quot;
&quot; as far as we know , there is currently no camera that has integrated a GPS unit . but there are a few working with GPS recei@@ vers . either as a card module or by transmitt@@ ing the data with a cable or Bluetooth . &quot;
cameras with GPS interface : Co@@ y@@ ot@@ e@@ Eye i@@ PA@@ Q I@@ ke Ko@@ da@@ k D@@ CS Pro Nikon DSLR Ric@@ oh Pro G3 Sony
&quot; downloading the GPS data from one device can be done using g@@ ps@@ man or g@@ ps@@ b@@ abel . however , you must store these data in g@@ px format as this is the only format supported by the module for geographic assignment . &quot;
there are various programs for &amp; Windows ; and Mac OS which can extract and cor@@ relate data from images and GPS . on the following page you can do the same under &amp; Linux ; make : g@@ ps@@ Cor@@ r or g@@ ps@@ Photo
&quot; if you know the long@@ itude and latitude or other data , then you can use this script that works with the Ex@@ if@@ Tool by Phil Harv@@ ey . it uses the preferred coordinates , which are created e.g. by map@@ s.@@ goo@@ gle . &quot;
&quot; here are some European sites , at least in French , German and Spanish , which show all the navigation details for Europe . &quot;
the Settings dialog is divided into eight pages . you can switch between them by clicking on the icons of the left side .
select action can be displayed on embedded thumb@@ nail or image editing . you set the default behavior of &amp; digi@@ came ; notice when you click on an entry in the main view .
&quot; this page contains , as shown below , the standar@@ dis@@ ation and copyright data . these data are automatically written to the corresponding IP@@ TC data fields when the option is selected when downloading from the camera interface . &quot;
&quot; title is a syn@@ onym for fas@@ cists : this field should include the profession of photographer , freel@@ ance photographer or independent , commercial photographer . as this is a more detailed description of the author , this must also be filled . &quot;
&quot; publisher is a syn@@ onym for vendors : use this field to specify the photo . this does not have to be the author if this is a photo agency , such as Reu@@ ters or Associ@@ ated Press , then the group or agency should be listed here . &quot;
the IP@@ TC actions store the data in the corresponding IP@@ TC ri@@ ms . this means that the metadata is permanently contained in the picture and not only available in the database of &amp; digi@@ came ; and this metadata is also available to other programs and can be imported in &amp; digi@@ came ; imported without being lost .
&quot; image lab@@ eling as embedded cap@@ tions ( J@@ FI@@ F ) in JPEG images : this synchron@@ izes the comments you add to your photos , with the inscription embedded in the pictures . &quot;
&quot; the Settings page contains all the options for the information displayed when the cursor is in the main window over a file . depending on the chosen option , this information is displayed or not . &quot;
&quot; &amp; # 160 ; digi@@ came ; supports a number of different image formats and some video and audio formats . to determine which file types &amp; digi@@ came ; to display , you can add and remove the file extensions of this list ; alb@@ um@@ folder that has none of these extensions , from &amp; digi@@ came ; ignored . &quot;
the default settings can be reset again by pressing the button refres@@ h to the right of each category .
&quot; some pictures have different sizes and the synchron@@ ous mode is then not available . however , some pictures have different sizes and the synchron@@ ous mode is not available . if you have one , then you can get better picture results . &quot;
&quot; by default , image processing uses a black background behind the displayed photos . if you prefer a different color , you can select it here . you can turn off the toolbar when you use image editing in full screen mode . &quot;
over@@ - and under@@ exposed areas of an image can be marked with dar@@ ker or bright color in the picture . these colors are set here . in the image processing this picture mode can be switched on and off with F@@ 10 and F@@ 11 .
Chro@@ ma sub@@ sampling is meant to be enco@@ ded in a higher resolution of lumin@@ ance than in colour information . please read this article in Wikipedia for the near@@ er explanation .
&quot; with the setting PNG @-@ compression you can reduce the size of PNG files . this operation does not reduce the image quality since PNG requires a los@@ s@@ less algorithm . if you have a quick calcul@@ ator , you can set this value to a high compression . this means 1 : a low and 9 a high compression . &quot;
&quot; with the TIFF file option , you can comp@@ ress the DE@@ FL@@ ATE compression algorithm for TIFF photos . this reduces the size of TIFF photos . it does not affect the image quality since the DE@@ FL@@ ATE algorithm works los@@ s@@ less . &quot;
&quot; when you select the los@@ s@@ less JPEG 2000 files , you can save los@@ s@@ less . even if you select the los@@ s@@ less settings , the ratio between quality loss and file size is far better than normal JPEG . when this paragraph is written , metadata was not yet supported , but was in planning . &quot;
&quot; in the previous versions of &amp; digi@@ came , image editing was just a picture viewer for photos . currently , it develops very quickly to a tool for manipul@@ ating your photos . with this dialog you can change the settings of image editing . &quot;
&quot; the default sampling is that all green pixels are equal . if the random green pixels of the CCD sensor react with sensitive to ultra@@ violet light than the pixels with odd lines , this difference creates a grid pattern in output . this option draws the image a little soft , elimin@@ ates the 2x@@ 2 grid pattern with the V@@ N@@ G@@ - or A@@ HD quality method . &quot;
&quot; if this option is set , the white balance of the camera is used . otherwise , if set , the automatic ink balance is used . &quot;
&quot; this setting is only used when the white balance is not set . standard is to use a fixed colour balance , which was photograph@@ ed on a white card that was photograph@@ ed in the sunlight . &quot;
this setting is only supported for Fu@@ ji Super CCD SL@@ R cameras . using the second sensors has the effect that under@@ exposed images will get more details in the top lights . for other cameras this option is ignored .
&quot; the standard is the pointed @-@ lights , so the parts of your images are burned to consider as continuous white . use the setting of continuous white in the settings . the setting colors will generate some unusual results as it displays the top lights in various ros@@ at@@ ars . finally , you can try to re@@ construct some parts of the missing information from the top lights . &quot;
&quot; this is possible because blue pixels are generally not as fast as green and red . &amp; digi@@ came ; and dc@@ raw try to re@@ construct the missing green and red portions of the still non @-@ saturated blue pixels . of course , this is a question of how much color or white you want . &quot;
&quot; if you select the option to re@@ construct , you get the possibility to set a level . here is a value of three a compromise and can / should therefore be individually adapted for each image . &quot;
&quot; put the lumin@@ ance value according to your taste . you probably need to set it slightly higher than the standard 1 . however , this can be done later in the image options of the &amp; digi@@ ous ; image processing . in order to keep the time for the Dem@@ os@@ a@@ icing , you should proceed conserv@@ atively . &quot;
&quot; a Dem@@ os@@ a@@ icing algorithm is a digital image process to calculate a complete picture of the sub @-@ raw data obtained from the color @-@ fil@@ tered image sensor , which has many cameras and that provides a matrix of coloured pixels . this algorithm is also known as CF@@ A inter@@ pol@@ ation or colour reproduction . &quot;
&quot; after some tests , it looks as if A@@ HD inter@@ pol@@ ation ( variable number of gra@@ dients ) was used . V@@ NG inter@@ pol@@ ation ( variable number of gra@@ dients ) was the first algorithm used by D@@ c@@ raw . it produces color art@@ ef@@ acts on edges . bil@@ ine@@ ar is interesting if you are looking for a quick solution with an acceptable result . &quot;
&quot; if you know the color devi@@ ation of your lenses , you can set the red and blue correc@@ tions here . this is certainly the best method for a color adjustment correction , since you are carried out during raw conversion . &quot;
&quot; a profile transl@@ ates the color information and gives instructions how to be returned . there is also L@@ CMS and &amp; digi@@ came ; information such as the color information from a color space to translate into the other , so that the colors are as exact as possible . &quot;
behaviour issues when an image is opened in image processing / color management module with raw files .
&quot; click here to save the folder , such as / usr / share / color / ICC or / home / user / .@@ color / ICC , where you can store all your profiles . &quot;
settings of ICC profiles you have here the possibility &amp; quot ; standard squ@@ ad ; for your profiles to deposit . everything can be changed when opening the raw file later .
the colour management view is an alternative to X@@ cali@@ b or Ar@@ gy@@ ll . here only your pictures are color managed not the entire screen .
&quot; the input profiles should be adapted to the camera manufacturer and model you can use . not all profiles are created in the same way . currently , dc@@ raw g@@ amma is not corrected for conver@@ sions at 16 bit depth . this means that you need to carry out the color mapping yourself . &quot;
&quot; there are other options such as the Soft Pro@@ of Profile , which you can em@@ ulate as your image can be returned from a device . this is very useful before you can print the picture as your printer has a smaller color range than your camera and some colors can be very saturated , instead of getting on the blind algorithm of your printer . &quot;
&quot; for most cameras , it is pretty obvious which colour profile is intended for what is intended for . unfortunately , there is a table of cameras and profiles that fit together . of course , this answer is in@@ official : &quot;
&quot; the Canon profile expansion leaves the style for the goal : F for a precise style , L for landscapes , N for neutral , P for portrait and S for the standard style . &quot;
K@@ IP@@ I is the &amp; k@@ de ; Image Plugin interface . it is an interface that is supported by a series of &amp; k@@ de ; image viewing and image editing ; many modules support that are written to work with any program that supports the K@@ IP@@ I interface .
&quot; if your distribution has the K@@ IP@@ I modules installed , you will see a list of available modules . &quot;
short commands for tasks performed by modules can be set in the menu under Settings short@@ cuts .
further information ( in English ) about K@@ IP@@ I modules can be obtained via the K@@ IP@@ I project at http : / / www.@@ ki@@ pi @-@ plug@@ ins@@ .org or in the manuals of the K@@ IP@@ I modules .
&quot; the settings of the slide show should be easy to understand . the upper knob adju@@ sts the time between the image transi@@ tions , usually 4 @-@ 5 seconds good . the other check@@ boxes switch the metadata on or off , which are displayed at the lower end of the images during the display . &quot;
&quot; the camera properties appear on the left side a list of all the currently supported cameras . on the right side there is a button Automatic detection , which is trying to identify a camera that is connected to the computer . below are the port settings . currently , serial , USB and USB / Fire@@ Wire storage are currently supported . &quot;
&quot; at the lower end , you can set the path for USB and Fire@@ wire ( IEE@@ E @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) mass storage cameras . you have to specify the path , / m@@ nt / camera or / m@@ nt / Rem@@ ov@@ able , where you mount your camera . &quot;
&quot; to use your digital camera with &amp; digi@@ p ; to use , you need to connect the camera to your computer , bring it into display mode and turn on . &quot;
&quot; select whether &amp; digi@@ came ; the camera automatically det@@ ects . if not , you can set camera model and port manually . after you have set up your camera , your camera appears in the camera . &quot;
&quot; you can select any name for your camera . if you own more than one camera , you can insert all of them here . &quot;
&quot; with the option of confirmation dialog for moving &gt; Images in the tr@@ ash bin , you can set the conversation of &amp; digi@@ came ; when del@@ eting a photo in an album . in the sections del@@ eting a photo and del@@ eting an album you will find more details . &quot;
the editorial changes due to the right side@@ bar can be tac@@ itly used by &amp; digi@@ came ; apply if you use the option to apply changes in the right side@@ bar without any queries . otherwise you need to save the changes with the button changes .
&quot; you can also include the display of the welcome screen from &amp; digi@@ came ; when starting , this acceler@@ ates the starting process of &amp; digi@@ came ; . &quot;
&quot; setting The Start after new photos are forcing &amp; digi@@ came ; the base folder for new or deleted albums / photos are looking for . this pro@@ lon@@ gs the start time of &amp; digi@@ came ; . if something was deleted from the base folder , it asks &amp; digi@@ came ; you , if it is to delete it from the database . &quot;
different color schemes can be used in &amp; digi@@ ous ; used to customize the main window to your taste . these settings can be selected from the toolbar settings . a preview of the available designs is listed below :
&quot; these designs have been defined in simple text files . if you are interested in creating a new design for &amp; digi@@ came ; to create , you will find more information in this tutorial . &quot;
&quot; the image editing can be started by clicking with the left mouse button on the preview of an image , or by the context menu of the preview and selection of the edit entry / edit entry . &quot;
&quot; the image processing contains a number of tools to improve your pictures . some of them are available as modules in &amp; digi@@ came ; so , you may not be part of your distribution . you can find more information about the K@@ IP@@ I modules in the editing section . &quot;
&quot; a status bar at the bottom of the window , the filename , current file number , magni@@ fication factor and the current image size indicates . &quot;
a menu bar at the top and below the toolbar for quick access to the most frequently needed functions .
&quot; the editing functions of image processing change your photos . however , none of the functions will change the original photo before you have used file storage or button saving from the toolbar . note that you can no longer restore the original photo , once you have saved the picture . &quot;
so you should possibly create a copy of your image before you change it . this can be done with file Save as .
&quot; as long as you have not saved the photo , you can restore the original image by using the File Recovery or button The button Rec@@ over the image processing re@@ produce in the toolbar . you then lose each change you have done in the photo since the last Save . &quot;
virtually any action of image processing can be revers@@ ed or restored . the last action you can und@@ o by selecting editing or restor@@ ing items from the menu .
&quot; if you frequently use this , you should make the short@@ cut short@@ cut , Ctr@@ l ; -@@ Z to und@@ o and Ctr@@ l ; -@@ Shift @-@ Z to re@@ produce . &quot;
&quot; if you select the &amp; L@@ MB ; for a moment longer press the return or restore button in the toolbar , you will receive a context menu . if you select one of the menu items , all actions are revers@@ ed or restored . &quot;
&quot; once you have started editing , you can move between the photos on the same album or the same keyword by using the navigation buttons in the toolbar , image high , image down or the entries in the File menu . if you have made changes to the current photo , you &apos;ll be asked if you want to save it . &quot;
you can zoom in and out in the picture in which you are using Ctr@@ l ; mouse wheel or the icons in the toolbar or the entries in the An@@ si@@ diary menu .
&quot; to adjust a photo to the window size , you can use this button in the toolbar : choose the magni@@ fication factor automatically &quot;
view full screen mode shows the picture in full screen mode . you come to the normal view where you can use the Es@@ c key .
&quot; if you want to print the current image , you can select the image in the File menu and get the default &amp; k@@ de ; print dialog . you can adjust the settings here before printing your photo . &quot;
&quot; from the main menu you can print single pictures or entire pro@@ positions . all image templates can be selected from your selection . you only need to select the pictures with the standard methods and select the printing wizard from the menu . if you follow the wizard , you only need to make your choice . &quot;
&quot; the main window has a side@@ bar on the right edge , which provides important information and actions for the selected images . the same page bar is available without the navigation arrows , even in image processing . it is displayed when one of the five riders is cli@@ cked : &quot;
multiple Click on the same tab lets the side@@ bar appear or disappear again to the edge .
the text is UT@@ F @-@ 8 compatible . the text is UT@@ F @-@ 8 compatible . this means that all special characters are allowed . the inscription is copied into the EX@@ IF@@ - and IP@@ TC fields so that you can be used by other programs .
the IP@@ TC data only support ASCII characters and are limited to 2000 characters . all comments will be cut off after 2000 characters and special characters are turned up@@ . if you want to use the IP@@ TC labelling system in other applications you should observe these limitations .
&quot; after which you have commented on , use either the App@@ ly button or switch to the next picture , the cap@@ tions are then saved . &quot;
&quot; besides the user button , there is a button More . with this you can read additional metadata from the selected file or database . however , you can also write metadata in the files . however , this is always performed if you have selected a metadata setting that is always written in the pictures . &quot;
&quot; the rating from the page bar is applied only to a single click on the 5 stars in the side@@ bar or with the keyboard short@@ cut Ctr@@ l + 0 ... 5 . to evaluate several images at the same time , select them and use the context menu . &quot;
the evaluation is written in the IP@@ TC field . encoding follows the scheme in the following table :
&quot; the keyword view shows a search box for filtering the keywords , the keyword tree and a selection box with the keywords used previously in this &amp; digi@@ me ; -@@ session used keywords . &quot;
the keyword tree is dynam@@ ically adjusted to the given search word . you can quickly limit the number of options when searching for a keyword . this ability is particularly useful if you have many keywords .
&quot; the input field at the bottom end is a further simpli@@ fication when entering keywords in a series of images . if you have entered various keywords , they are stored for quick access . &quot;
keywords can also be set by marking the appropriate check@@ boxes in the tree . all keywords of an image are stored in the IP@@ TC field keyword .
&quot; if you select several images in the main view and select a keyword in the keyword tree , this is only applied to the highlighted image and not to the entire selection , if you want to have a selection with a keyword , please read the keyword filter section . &quot;
&quot; the page bar keyword filter is used to change the selection of the images displayed in the main window . normally , the left side bar with their album is used . if additionally one or more keyword filters are used from the right side , only the intersection of these two is displayed . all created keywords are available . &quot;
&quot; you can also drag and drop keywords . suppose you have selected several images in the main view . if the keyword already exists , you can simply drag it from the right side bar and put it on the selection . then a dialog appears that asks you if you want to set the keyword . &quot;
&quot; in the upper example , the main window displays the pictures on a cal@@ ender tag . the keyword filter is shown on no keywords , which reduces the amount to three images . &quot;
this search for changes takes place at any start of the program .
&quot; if you have a rule with and created and determine that it should be one or its , you can easily change this by double @-@ clicking on the text and in the control section . &quot;
&quot; ( 1 ) : the entry after which is searched in the database . this can be an album , name , keyword , image , keyword , etc . &quot;
( 3 ) : the argument for the operator that is a name or string that is already set in the database .
&quot; for example , you can set an Advanced Search for all the elements of the database using the following options : &quot;
&quot; if you want to group options , you only need to use the check box at the end of the rule and then the button group@@ ing . the options are then as follows : &quot;

this article / tutorial was written mainly by El@@ le Stone . special thanks to El@@ le for this work . I mainly adapted it to &amp; digi@@ came ; s concrete implementation .
&quot; the reason you set up a color @-@ managed workflow is that the colors that come from your camera or scanner are a predic@@ table devi@@ ation from the actually photograph@@ ed or sc@@ anned colors . with a color @-@ managed workflow , you can achieve that the colors on your monitor are equal to those of your camera or scanner and the colors that you print or publish on the web to them from your digital dark@@ room . &quot;
&quot; if the theme is based on color management , everyone wants to know what buttons he needs to press for the results he wants . unfortunately , color management means to provide you with sufficient background information about color management . &quot;
&quot; if your image workflow meets all six criteria listed below , you don &apos;t have to worry about color management . &quot;
you work on a monitor that is calibr@@ ated to the s@@ RGB colour space . ( see below )
&quot; your only other image editions are by email or web , where s@@ RGB is the de @-@ fac@@ to standard . &quot;
&quot; so if s@@ RGB works so well and makes life easier for everyone , why should you use another color space and have to worry about color spo@@ ol@@ ding ? &quot;
&quot; a visual example of the limitation of s@@ RGB in comparison to the colors that we can really see is presented below . it shows a 2 @-@ dimensional representation of all colors that we can see , the hor@@ ses@@ ho@@ e @-@ shaped region , and colors in the s@@ RGB colour space , the tri@@ angular district . &quot;
&quot; if you want to compare the 2 @-@ dimensional representation of s@@ RGB with some bigger color spaces , visit Bruce Lind@@ blo@@ oms excell@@ ente page and then click Info and then on Information About RGB Working Sp@@ aces . &quot;
do I have to cal@@ li@@ fy my monitor if I decided to work only in the s@@ RGB colour space ?
&quot; yes ! whether you work in the s@@ RGB colour space or not , you have to cal@@ li@@ fy your monitor since s@@ RGB is leaving your monitor to s@@ RGB , then you must either use your monitor to the s@@ RGB @-@ standard cal@@ li@@ ze , use a matching monitor profile or both . &quot;

this tool provides five automatic correc@@ tions that can improve a picture in most cases . therefore use it before you attempt a further manual processing .
&quot; the functions norm@@ alize , identical , automatic tran@@ scen@@ ding and contrast extend from the menu Cor@@ rig@@ ation Automatic correction attempt automatically from your colors to make the best . you will have to experiment with these effects to see which works best in your photo . &quot;
norm@@ alize : this method sc@@ ans the lumin@@ ous values over the entire image so that the dark@@ est point is black and the bri@@ ghtest dot as bright as possible without changing its shade . this function is often a magic correction for images that are dark or washed .
&quot; the same number of pixels has the same number of pixels , sometimes it produces very good results in improving the contrast of an image , sometimes it produces very good results in improving the contrast of an image , sometimes it produces only rub@@ b@@ ish . it is a very powerful operation that either causes miracles in a picture or destroyed it . &quot;
&quot; automatic balance : this method maxim@@ izes the color range in the red , green and blue channel . you determine the dark and bright tones and adjust the red , green and blue channels to the complete hist@@ ogram range . &quot;
contrast : this method improves the contrast and brightness of the RGB values of an image by moving the lowest and highest values to the greatest possible range and a re@@ ji@@ of all values in between . this is only visible in selected images and can be a good correction for bad pictures .
the white balance of &amp; digi@@ kam ; is a semi @-@ automatic tool to perform the white balance of a photo .
&quot; if you are too far from the original image , areas with over@@ exposure may occur . if you are too far from the original image , areas with over@@ exposure may occur . if you can perform the white balance in raw mode , which works in 16 @-@ bit mode , your possibilities for correction will be improved . &quot;
this tool is based on a white balance algorithm which is protected by Pa@@ wel T. J@@ och@@ ym . you start it using the menu entry colors white balance of image processing .
&quot; the preview window can be adjusted in size . on the left , both the original image and preview of the target picture can be seen . &quot;
the preview of the target photos has a red marker . the lumin@@ ance of the pixel under this marker is shown as vertical line in the hist@@ ogram .
&quot; at the top right a hist@@ ogram shows that dynam@@ ically changes as soon as you change a parameter . this hist@@ ogram is very helpful , even in well lit pictures , most pixels are very small L@@ umin@@ ance values . with one button , you can decide whether one of the three colors or your sum is indicated . the sum is called L@@ umin@@ ance . &quot;
&quot; the contrast of your result depends on shadow , satur@@ ation and g@@ amma . adjust the shadow details of your photos or di@@ m down . &quot;
&quot; to play with the above controls , you should use the color temperature pi@@ p@@ ette . click on this button and then somewhere on the picture preview to use selected color to calculate the color temperature of the white balance . this way , the temperature and green values are set automatically . &quot;
&quot; in addition , you can set the white balance with the list of pres@@ ets . the following settings are available : &quot;
the over@@ exposure indicator increases the colors when more than one color channel of the pixel is over@@ exposed .. You will see the combined result in the white balance . this is displayed as a pure indicator and has no effect on the final image .
&quot; the buttons Save As and Lo@@ ading do exactly this . each setting of the white balance you have set , you can save it to a text file and load it later . &quot;
&quot; the Pre@@ ferences button returns all filter values back to their default values and the associated neutral white balance . note that even neutral settings will result in another picture as your original . if you save this , your original image will change . &quot;
&quot; you can set the encoding depth per colour channel of the edited image . 8 @-@ bit encoding is better suited for high quality images . this coding requires more disk space , time time and is only available for formats PNG , PN@@ M , TIFF and DNG . &quot;
this tool opens the same dialog as for the processing of blan@@ ks . it uses the change and assignment of color profiles . colour mapping can be done by the sub @-@ window for the brightness . a detailed guide for using color profiles allows you to rate the chapter of color management .
&quot; another important tool is to find in the menu under Color Ton@@ wert@@ correction . this tool provides an integrated way to adjust multiple color channels at the same time , allowing you to always use your settings so that you will always need the same correction . &quot;
a very powerful possibility to correct exposure problems is the tool for gra@@ dation that you can find under colors gra@@ dation in the menu .
&quot; the &amp; digi@@ ous ; tool color effects provide you four color effects , a solar installation effect , a Vel@@ via filter , a Ne@@ on effect and an edge filter . &quot;
&quot; the coloured , dar@@ ker areas protected the delicate phot@@ op@@ aper from the extra light . this had the effect that the lighter areas were dar@@ ker and the colors were inver@@ ted by the second illumination . the result was a partial neg@@ atively of the image . this tool allows you to adjust this interesting effect fine . &quot;
&quot; the intensity control the Solar@@ isation . at about 50 % intensity , the image shows what is chem@@ ically possible . another increase eventually creates a negative image that does not produce photo paper . &quot;
this is an example of the Solar@@ isation effect . the original image is the ( 1 ) and that processes the ( 2 ) . the applied intensity is 30 % .
the Vi@@ vid filter simul@@ ates the so @-@ called &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vi@@ aqu@@ ot ; effect . it differs from satur@@ ation by making it a stronger contrast effect that makes the colors brilliant and brilliant . try it to em@@ bell@@ ish many photos .
the name is a composition of &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vet Medi@@ aqu@@ ot ; and thus a reference for its smooth image structure . Vel@@ via offers very saturated colours with daylight and high contra@@ sts .
&quot; the Ne@@ on@@ Filter simul@@ ates ne@@ on@@ light on the contrast edges . the parameter level controls the brightness of the result and the sli@@ ders re@@ ps the strength of the ne@@ on light . at large pictures , the filter can load the entire CPU for a moment . &quot;
digital cameras often have problems with lighting conditions and it is therefore not unusual that you want to correct the color contrast and the lumin@@ osity of the photos .
&quot; even in this case , the tool for brightness / satur@@ ation is a good choice to reduce satur@@ ation instead of increasing it . even in this case , the tool for brightness / satur@@ ation is a good choice to see satur@@ ation instead of increasing it . if you like the result , you can confirm the changes with O@@ k . &quot;
&quot; between the complex mold gra@@ dation and the simple lumin@@ ous intensity / contrast / g@@ amma , the tool sound correction is set to improve the exposure . even if the dialog for this tool works very complicated , you need only the scope of the slide . concrete the three slides below the hist@@ ogram . &quot;
&quot; the window contains a graph of intensity values , a hist@@ ogram , the active channel or the selected area . under the graph , three slides can be cli@@ cked into the image and which can be moved to change the intensity values of the image . the left side represents the dark and the right side the bright areas . &quot;
the easiest way to learn how to use it is to shift the control and take care of how the image changes .
&quot; on the right hand side , the original and preview of the image can be viewed . the preview will be dynamic , based on the settings of the image , updated . the following options are available on the left @-@ hand side . &quot;
sc@@ aling : with this selection box can be set whether the hist@@ ogram is represented with a linear or log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic Y axis . in case of images of a constant color the linear hist@@ ogram is dominated by a single column . in this case the log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic classification is more useful .
&quot; three controls : the top for the dark tones , the middle for the bright tones and the lowest for the middle tones , often called gam@@ ma@@ sts . &quot;
&quot; the three color pin@@ stripes can be used in the preview of the original image to automatically adjust the input values of shadows , middle and bright tones . furthermore , there is a button for a fully automatic adjustment . &quot;
output values : the output values allow the selection of manual values for each area . there are also two controls that can be used to change the output values as the background . for example the compression of the output values can be used to create a hidden image as background while something else is in the foreg@@ round .
automatically : with this button the image values are automatically set depending on the intensity values of the image .
save as and load : with these buttons the set values in the file system can be saved and re@@ charged later . the Gim@@ p Levels Format is used .
&quot; if you use this mode and the three color pi@@ pet@@ tes , the input values will be automatically adjusted for all shadows , means and sun shades . activate the color pi@@ p@@ ette you want to use and click on thumb@@ nails to set the input values of the hist@@ ogram for red , green , blue and the lumin@@ ance channels . &quot;
&quot; the option over@@ exposure indicator controls all color channels to find over@@ exposed pixels and show you the combined result of all channels . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only in preview and there is no effect to see the final result . &quot;
&quot; below you can see an example of the adjustment of input values applied to red , green and blue channel of a photo . intensity and alpha channel , as well as the output values are unchanged . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and the corrected picture with ( 2 ) . &quot;
the preview will be updated dynam@@ ically depending on your settings . the following options are available on the right @-@ hand side :
modified channel : this selection box allows to specify the channel that is modified by the module :
&quot; in addition to this box , there are two symbols to switch between a linear and a log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic view . for images that have been recorded with a digital camera , linear mode creates a wide beam . in this case log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic mode helps . &quot;
&quot; for example , if you shift a curve to the right , for example the bright tones , then you can see that these bright tones correspond with dar@@ ker output holes and that dar@@ ker the associated image pixel . &quot;
&quot; on the preview of the original photos is a red marker to see . if you want to change this marker to the area you want to change , a matching line will be displayed on the curve representing the original value . &quot;
save as and load : with these buttons you can do exactly this . each curve that you created can be saved in the file system and loaded later . the file format is the Gim@@ p curve format .
&quot; if you create this method and the three color pi@@ p@@ ette buttons automatically create the control points of the curve for all channels of shadow , middle and sunny tones . activate the color pi@@ p@@ ette you want to use and click on the original image to set the control points for the red , green , blue and L@@ umin@@ ance curve . &quot;
&quot; the option over@@ exposure indicator controls all color channels to display over@@ exposed pixels . if in more than one channel over@@ exposed pixels , you get the combined result . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only in preview and there is no effect to see the final result . &quot;
below you can see a black @-@ and @-@ white photo that was corrected in the L@@ umin@@ ance Channel . shadow and sun shades were set with the color pi@@ p@@ ette and applied to the curves . the original image is ( 1 ) and the corrected ( 2 ) .
the channel mixer of the &amp; digi@@ came ; image processing is a tool to improve the color channels or change the color sh@@ ading of the photos .
the channel mixer is another highly developed tool to mix the colors of the images . you can edit it from the menu colors channel mixer of image processing .
&quot; with the channel selection box , you can select the color for hist@@ ogram : this gives you a first indication of how you can correct the channels by viewing the relative distribution and r@@ ash . the left pane of the window shows you a preview . the original can be viewed for comparison with your own rider . &quot;
&quot; the preview of the target picture has a red marker . if you position it in the image , a vertical line in the hist@@ ogram shows you to display the corresponding color value . &quot;
&quot; controls for the module are right below : controls for red , green and construction allow you to mix these channels . if you activate L@@ umin@@ ance , the image will retain the general brightness , as the channel mixer then is THE tool for generating magnificent black and white conver@@ sions of your photos . try to reduce the green channel for black and white portraits . &quot;
&quot; sometimes , especially when mixing mon@@ ochro@@ me , the reduction of a color comes to a visible noise that comes from the far@@ brau@@ er . if that is the case , you can improve your Mon@@ ochro@@ me conversion in which you can reduce your mon@@ ochro@@ me conversion . &quot;
the saving as and loading buttons are used exactly for this purpose . any mixer settings can be saved for later and then load . the file format used is the Gim@@ p channel mixer format .
&quot; the option over@@ exposure indicator controls all color channels to find over@@ exposed pixels and show you the combined result of all channels . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only in preview and there is no effect to see the final result . &quot;
below you can see a photo in which the blue channel has been re@@ adjusted . the L@@ umin@@ ance option is checked . the original image is under ( 1 ) and the edited picture below ( 2 ) .
&quot; black / white photography was always fascinating because of your ab@@ straction ability . with the development of digital photography , black / white is a work step , as color images can be easily converted to the computer . also with a set of movie roll profiles . &quot;

&quot; green filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with a green lens filter . this looks good , with all scen@@ eries and fits particularly well to portraits against the sky . so similar to 004 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) green filter . &quot;
&quot; Oran@@ ge@@ filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with an orange lens filter . this improves landscapes , maritime scenes and aerial photos . so similar to the 002 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) orange filter . &quot;
Rot@@ filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with a red lens filter . this creates dramatic cel@@ esti@@ al effects and can simul@@ ate mo@@ on@@ light scenes at the time of the day . so similar to 003 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) Rot@@ filter .
yellow filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with an yellow lens filter . this is the most natural color tone correction and improves the contrast . it is ideal for landscapes and thus similar to the 001 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) yellow filter .
&quot; Sep@@ i@@ aton : produces warm light and medium tones while it adds a bit cold to the sh@@ ading tones . this is very similar to the process of the failure of a pressure and the re@@ development in a sep@@ i@@ at@@ onic . this is typical for the photos of your grand@@ mother , and therefore similar to the 005 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) Sep@@ i@@ af@@ il@@ ter . &quot;
with the &amp; digi@@ ous ; apply tool texture you can apply decorative tex@@ tures to a picture .
&quot; adding a texture to your image , regardless of whether it is a color image or not , you can make it look like an oil painting on a canvas , the stit@@ ch of an old master , a pop art portrait of enlarged points or like a wall picture on a wall . &quot;
relief : moving this parameter to the right increases the appearance of the depth or three dimension@@ ality of texture on the picture .
a paper texture effect has been applied on the photo below . the original picture is ( 1 ) and the changed under ( 2 ) to see . the parameter relief has been set to 200 .
with the &amp; digi@@ me ; add tool frame a decorative frame can be added to a picture .
keeping the eye of a viewer in the limits of a photo is not an easy task . a possibility to keep his attention is to set the image a decorative frame . this is a psychological barrier for the sc@@ atter@@ ing eye . under image frame the module can be started from the image processing .
&quot; type : with this parameter , set the desired frame type for your image . penet@@ rating the image with a thin line and a wide frame ( ideal for black and white pictures ) , bev@@ elled it with a nice three @-@ dimensional frame that is ideal for a button@@ hole and decorative element adding a decorative frame with patterns . &quot;
width : indicates the width of the frame in percent . the value range for the width is limited from 1 % to 50 % .
&quot; the target picture with the frame will be bigger than the original , but the same aspect ratio . this is important to print the images , especially if you have used the tool after aspect ratio beforehand . &quot;
&quot; with this handy tool , you can insert simple one format@@ ted text into a picture at any place . this also goes in several places if you need it . &quot;
&quot; this tool is very intuitive to use . just enter text direction , orientation , color from the color space and character set with its properties as you need it . finally , simply select a frame around the text and / or a semi @-@ transparent background . &quot;
&quot; each setting you have chosen for your text can be changed until you press the button &quot; &quot; OK &quot; . &quot; once the image has been saved , the text is part of the picture . it can no longer be changed . &quot;
with the &amp; digi@@ me ; tool template you can put a template over a picture .
the Image template menu apply in image processing can be used to place st@@ encils via a picture .
&quot; for the template , there are no limitations regarding size and orientation . however , you need to take the PNG file format and should work with maximum compression ( 9 ) to reduce the file size of the template . &quot;
&quot; if you use this tool for the first time , you need to set your sten@@ cil folder with the button root folder in the dialog . select the folder in which you have copied the sten@@ cil files . these settings will be noted for the next start . &quot;
&quot; after the root folder for the templates has been set , a tree view that reflects the folder structure of the sten@@ cil folder . selecting a folder updates the template &apos;s thumb@@ nail automatically . &quot;
under the preview there are three buttons with which you can change the magni@@ fication factor and the position of your image .
enlarge : this button enlar@@ ges the underlying image . it is centered around the mouse position . check it with the left mouse button .
&quot; smaller : this button minim@@ izes the image below . it is centered around the mouse position . if you want to apply the template to the whole picture , you must res@@ ize the image accordingly . check it with the left mouse button . &quot;
move this button to move it under the template . take the picture and place it at the desired position .
use OK if you want to apply the template to your image . the image will then be automatically adjusted to the preview size .
&amp; digi@@ came ; provides three different tools for shar@@ pen@@ ing . each one of you has advantages in other areas .
&quot; shar@@ pen@@ ing is a traditional tool for shar@@ pen@@ ing . it is very fast and easy , however , especially in dark areas , gran@@ ular images . &quot;
the algorithm has been taken from Gim@@ p and it is copy@@ ri@@ ghted by W@@ inst@@ on Ch@@ ang .
&quot; re@@ focus is possibly the best of the three , since it really improves the sharp@@ ness . it is a bit more complicated in its application and has different parameters for adjustment . &quot;
photos without focus as well as most digi@@ ti@@ sed pictures need a correction of sharp@@ ness . this is because of the digit@@ alization process colors with minimal differences to a color point . the same phenomenon can be observed when color points are printed on paper . SL@@ R cameras normally require more afterwards shar@@ pen@@ ing than normal cameras for private users .
&quot; at JPEG pictures , a camera is often used in internal shar@@ pen@@ ing . pictures in the shell format , on the other hand , must always be shar@@ pen@@ ed during processing . &quot;
&quot; some sc@@ anners apply a field of focus already during reading the image . if you disable this , you will get control of your image . &quot;
in some situations you can get useful results by shar@@ pen@@ ing a photo with the field of shar@@ pen@@ ing .
&quot; you should be careful , however , because the results are not very natural : the shar@@ pen@@ ing increases the sharp@@ ness of the edges , but also ampli@@ fies the noise . in general , you can re@@ focus the tool to shar@@ pen a picture . under re@@ focus you will find further information and a comparison of all techniques for shar@@ pen@@ ing . &quot;
sometimes you have the opposite problem : a picture is too cr@@ un@@ chy . the solution to draw the image a little soft is much easier than it to shar@@ pen . use the tool for a soft sign with the menu entry Cor@@ rig@@ ate soft draw and experiment with settings . the preview window on the right side of the dialog shows you the effect on your photo .
the filter bl@@ ur is a very good tool to remove vei@@ ls from your photos . a demonstration you can see here .
the original image and preview help edit the image . the preview window displays the output of the filter with the current settings .
&quot; there are two important parameters , the radius and the amount . the standard values often produce good results and should first be tried . an increase in the radius or the amount enhances the effect . if you make the im@@ sharp@@ est mask too strong , noise and the impression of ridges are created near sharp edges . &quot;
the radius turns one as many pixels on each side of a channel affected by the filter . high resolution images allow larger radi@@ i .
the amount represents the percentage of the original and the bl@@ urred image that is added to the original . this will set the strength of the sharp@@ ness .
&quot; the threshold value is a fraction of the maximum RGB value and the applicable difference amount . in this way , areas with a soft change between the tones are exemp@@ t from the shar@@ pen@@ ing and hence avoided beauty errors in faces , sk@@ ies and water surfaces . &quot;
&quot; this is an example of bl@@ ur@@ ry mas@@ king filter . the original image is the ( 1 ) and the modified image is the ( 2 ) . bl@@ urred mas@@ king was applied with radius = 6.0 , amount = 0.5 and a threshold = 0.0 . &quot;
the &amp; digi@@ came ; tool re@@ focuss@@ ed a picture by improving the sharp@@ ness . it used the copyright protected design filter algorithm by Ernst Li@@ ppe .
this tool tries a picture to &amp; quot ; re@@ focuss@@ ed . this is better approach than just trying to shar@@ pen the photo . this is better approach than just trying to shar@@ pen the photo . you can start using a technique called FI@@ R Vi@@ enn@@ ese movie . you can start it from the menu by re@@ focus colors in the image processing .
&quot; in practice , the circular devi@@ ation works much better than the Gau@@ ß &apos;s folding . the Gau@@ ß &apos;s folding has a very long tail , which means that the mathematical result is also influenced by the source pixel , which is far from the original pixel . &quot;
&quot; this is the radius of the circular circuit . it is the most important parameter for using this module . for most images , the default value should yield 1 good results . &quot;
correlation : an increase in correlation can help to reduce art@@ ef@@ acts . the correlation can be chosen from 0 @-@ 1 . usable values are 0.5 and the values near 1 , &amp; eg ; 0.@@ 95 and 0.@@ 99 . a high value for correlation reduces the sharp@@ ly effect of the module . &quot;
&quot; noise filter : an increase in noise filter can help you reduce art@@ ef@@ acts . however , values higher than 0.1 are rarely helpful . if the noise filter is too low , the image quality is very bad . &quot;
&quot; Gau@@ ß &apos;s sharp@@ ness : this is the radius for the pal@@ ate &apos;s sharp@@ ness . if you use this parameter to avoid anno@@ ying art@@ ef@@ acts . in most cases , you should use this value to zero to avoid anno@@ ying art@@ ef@@ acts . &quot;
&quot; matrix size : this value determines the size of the transformation matrix . an increase in the size of the matrix can generate good results , especially if you choose large values for the circular sharp@@ ness or the gauge of the sharp@@ ness . in most cases , you should choose a value in the range of 3 @-@ 10 . &quot;
the saving as and loading buttons are used exactly for this purpose . any re@@ focused parameter you set will be saved for later and can then be loaded .
&quot; try to perform all the cutting , color and intensity correction on the image before using the module . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , you should use the module before you change the image otherwise . the reason for this is that many operations make changes that are not immediately visible , but later leave unpleasant arti@@ facts . &quot;
&quot; when you read and comp@@ ress images , &amp; eg ; as JPEG , you should apply the module to the un@@ compressed picture . &quot;
&quot; generally , bl@@ urred mas@@ king produces better results than shar@@ pen@@ ing . this could be caused by bl@@ urred mas@@ king a larger neighborhood used as shar@@ pen@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; in theory , bl@@ ur@@ ry mas@@ king always has to produce art@@ ef@@ acts . even under optimal conditions , it can never remove the effect of the sharp@@ ness . the FI@@ R Vi@@ enn@@ ese filter is almost as good as the Un@@ shar@@ per Mask . the FI@@ R Vi@@ enn@@ ese filter is often better for processing small details . &quot;
&quot; below you can see a comparison between the different filters , on a small un@@ focused image , see : &quot;
the original un@@ sharp colour picture has to be corrected . this image has been made with an analogue camera . the un@@ focused result is due to in@@ adequate light for the car focus lens .
&quot; for more information on the methods of shar@@ pen@@ ing in digital images , you can read a technical comparison in English at this address . &quot;
the smooth@@ ness of the knob sets the sharp@@ ness of the range of dark@@ ened to create a more natural pu@@ pi@@ l .
&quot; the ink @-@ tin@@ te allows an adapted color for the pu@@ pi@@ l . if you want blue eyes instead of dark , then you can adjust this here . &quot;
the tool image error correction is one of the most advanced tools to remove unwanted art@@ ef@@ acts with unprecedented speed .
the painting algorithm has been developed by I@@ MAG@@ E team of the Gre@@ c CN@@ RS laboratories in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
this tool contains various pres@@ ets as starting points to simplify the restoration . the available pres@@ ets are listed below :
&quot; if you want to adjust the filter settings in case of fine adjustment , you can use the tab smoothing and advanced settings . &quot;
&quot; detail holding p &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this controls the preservation of details . a small value leads to an even smoothing over the picture . a value of 0.9 should keep details so that no shar@@ pen@@ ing is necessary . &quot;
&quot; directional dependen@@ cy Alpha &#91; 0,@@ 100 &#93; : a small value smooth@@ es ev@@ enly in all directions , whereas a value close to 1 is smooth@@ ed in one direction . JPEG art@@ ef@@ acts are best eliminated with a value near 1 . &quot;
&quot; fl@@ atten &#91; 0 , 500 &#93; : this sets the maximum smoothing factor above all@@ . p then defines the relative smoothing . &quot;
&quot; regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter affects larger structures . the higher this value is set , the more is smooth@@ ed . even if you want to create a &apos; van Gog@@ h &apos; turbul@@ ence effect , it must be set higher than 3 . &quot;
re@@ peti@@ tions : speci@@ fies how often the algorithm is going through . normally here is 1 or 2 .
&quot; angle incre@@ ments since &#91; 5 , 90 &#93; : angle @-@ dependent integration of an@@ is@@ otrop@@ ic Alpha . if Alpha is small , please note that small angles create a long run@@ time . so you should choose this value as much as possible and acceptable to your needs . &quot;
&quot; integral stri@@ de width &#91; 0,1 , 10 &#93; : integral stri@@ de width in pixels . you should set the value of smaller 1 to avoid sub @-@ pixel smoothing and never greater than 2 . &quot;
linear inter@@ pol@@ ation use : the more quality that you receive by choosing this option is only low . it dou@@ bles the run@@ time . we therefore recommend him to permit him .
the buttons Save as and Load exactly this . each setting of image errors can be corrected in a text file and re@@ charged later .
&quot; correct image errors are compar@@ atively very fast at work . however , it can take a long time and get a high CPU load . therefore , you can cancel the calculation at any time using the Cancel button . &quot;
below you can see how to remove picture error with small art@@ ef@@ acts . the module is applied to a photo that was created in Guatemala City with an analogue camera . the original picture is under ( 1 ) to see and the corrected picture below ( 2 ) .
the &amp; digi@@ ous ; noise reduction is a very powerful tool to l@@ essen image exchange . it uses a copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorithm by Peter Heck@@ ert .
&quot; this tool provides sel@@ ectable image filters to remove spots and other art@@ ef@@ acts , e.g. dust or hair on the lens . it can also be used to remove sensor noise from the camera or Mo@@ i@@ re@@ acute ; effects of sc@@ anned images from books or magazines . &quot;
&quot; if you need more information about digital cameras from digital cameras , you can read them in English in this tutorial . &quot;
the screen@@ shot above shows a typical scene made with a digital camera and high ISO sensitivity . it shows a gran@@ ular noise that can be removed successfully with this tool .
&quot; below you will find a complete description of all parameters . in most cases , you only need the sub @-@ window details and the sub@@ window Advanced Settings can remain in default settings . &quot;
&quot; radius controls the window size , from 1 ( 3x@@ 3 ) to 20 ( 4@@ 1x@@ 41 ) , which is used for the filter . &quot;
&quot; sharp@@ ness : controls the sharp@@ ness level . this value sets the pixel spac@@ ing that the filter looks forward to see lumin@@ ance changes . if the value is too high , the adap@@ tive filter picture details can no longer be obtained and noise or sm@@ elling occurs again . &quot;
edges : controls the edge accuracy for the sharp@@ ness . this value improves the frequency response of the filter . if it is too strong cannot the entire noise be removed or noise tips can occur . set it to a value near the maximum if you want to remove a weak noise or JPEG art@@ ef@@ acts without losing details .
light density : controls the lumin@@ ance tolerance of the image . we recommend either color or lumin@@ ance to change to improve a picture . these settings do not influence the smoothing process that is controlled by the details settings .
color : controls the color toler@@ ances of the picture . we recommend to change colour or lumin@@ ance to improve a picture . these settings do not influence the smoothing process that is controlled by the details settings .
&quot; g@@ amma : controls the g@@ mat@@ ance tolerance of the image . this value can be used to increase the tolerance values of the dar@@ ker areas , which are typically more strongly tap@@ ed to increase . however , it also contam@@ in@@ ates the shadow areas . &quot;
&quot; atten@@ uation : controls the adju@@ dic@@ ation of the phase j@@ itter d@@ amping . this value defines how quickly the adap@@ tive filter radius re@@ acts on variations of the lumin@@ ance . if it is increased , the edges may appear smo@@ other when it is too high , noise and phase j@@ itter appear on the edges . it can remove noise peaks and is the recommended method for it . &quot;
store under and load : these buttons are used exactly for this . all parameters for noise reduction you have set can be stored in the files@@ ystem and loaded later .
this is an example of how noise reduction can change your life . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and the corrected with ( 2 ) . the noise reduction was applied with the default settings .
sometimes a picture is too cr@@ un@@ chy for your purpose . the solution to draw the image a little soft is fortunately much easier than a picture to shar@@ pen . use the tool for the soft@@ mark with the menu entry Cor@@ rig@@ ate soft draw and experiment with the smoothing . the preview window on the right side of the dialog shows the effect of this operation on your photo .
the &amp; digi@@ ous ; photo restoration is definitely one of the most advanced tools to reduce photo art@@ ef@@ acts .
&quot; this filter for restoration gives you the opportunity to remove a lot of unwanted art@@ ef@@ acts from your pictures . it is very well adapted to remove Gau@@ ß &apos;s noise , film grades , scrat@@ ches , compression art@@ ef@@ acts and local errors that occur in digital , original or retro@@ spec@@ tively digi@@ ti@@ sed pictures . &quot;
&quot; the same algorithm can be used for color and texture reduction . the texture composition is developed with a different tool , the image error correction . the algorithm for restoration has been developed by the I@@ MAG@@ E team of the Gre@@ c CN@@ RS laboratories in Ca@@ en / Fran@@ n@@ k@@ reich and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project . &quot;
&quot; JPEG art@@ ef@@ acts reduce : compression of JPEG is not perfect , in some areas even very far away from it . as a los@@ sy compression algorithm , it creates some compression &amp; quot ; Art@@ ef@@ ak@@ te@@ quot ; - small standards that can be seen in un@@ compressed picture . &quot;
the buttons Save as and Load exactly this . each setting of photo restoration can be saved to a text file and re@@ charged later .
&quot; photo restoration is compar@@ atively very fast at work . however , it can take a long time and get a high CPU load . therefore , you can cancel the calculation at any time using the button Finish . &quot;
below you can be restored like a photo with uni@@ form@@ ly noise . the module is applied to a black and white photo that with a Min@@ ol@@ ta ( t@@ m ) 700@@ Si camera on an Il@@ ford ( t@@ m ) HP @-@ 5 movie with a sensitivity of 3200 ISO has been taken . the original picture is under ( 1 ) and the corrected under ( 2 ) .
below you can see another example of the photo restoration . this time tex@@ tures have been reduced to an old color photo that was read using a scanner . the original image is under ( 1 ) to see and the corrected picture below ( 2 ) .
the &amp; digi@@ ous ; tool Hot@@ pixel allows you to remove Hot@@ pixel from photos that were connected to a CCD camera . it uses algorithms from the JP@@ EG@@ Pix@@ i project that are copy@@ ri@@ ghted by Martin Dick@@ opp .
&quot; bright , dead or hot pixels are a problem particularly in high @-@ quality raw mode photos , as many cameras with JPEG compression have a built @-@ in supp@@ ression for hot pixels . &quot;
&quot; this tool can be used to remove &amp; quot ; hot Pix@@ el@@ quot ; and &quot; quot ; bright Pix@@ el@@ quot ; and &quot; quot ; bright Pix@@ el@@ quot ; on a photo with a dark image extraction method . there is currently no manual method to select the bad pixels .
download this file in the wizard with the dark@@ picture button . the tool will automatically recognize the hot and light pixels . these are highlighted in the preview preview .
&quot; if you have an old digital camera , it is important that you can record the dark image directly to detect new hot or light pixels using CCD defects . &quot;
&quot; first , as described in the previous section , you should find the right dark image to the image to be corrected . an automatic processing of the dark image will find the bad pixels . note that the wizard shows up the last dark picture and will automatically download it in the next session . &quot;
the image area and preview help you correct the result within the image . the preview window displays the output of the filter with the current settings . bad pixels are raised in all preview areas .
select an area around the defective pixel on the preview and see the results of the filter . then select the best filter method to inter@@ pol@@ ate these pixel blocks . these are the filters available :
&quot; Dur@@ ision : it is determined an average of the neigh@@ bor pixel . the resulting color is assigned to all defective pixel in the block . for a 1 @-@ dimensional inter@@ pol@@ ation , this is done separately for the horizontal and vertical line . &quot;
linear : all pixels that have a distance of 1 from pixel block are drawn to the calculation of a bi @-@ linear surface ( 2 @-@ di@@ m ) or a group of linear curves ( 1 @-@ di@@ m ) . these are then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the defective pixel in the block .
square : this is the default filter method . all pixels with a distance of 2 or less to pixel block are drawn to calculate a bi @-@ square surface ( 2 @-@ di@@ m ) or a group of square curves ( 1 @-@ di@@ m ) that is then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the pixels in the block .
&quot; cubic : all pixels with a distance of 3 or less are drawn to calculate a bi @-@ cubic surface ( 2 @-@ di@@ m ) or a group of cubic curves ( 1 @-@ di@@ m ) , which is then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the defective pixel in the block . &quot;
below you can see the Hot@@ pixel correction on a color photo from a defective digital camera with a sensitivity of 200 ISO and long exposure . the original image has been enlarged to 300 % ( 1 ) and the corrected picture is under ( 2 ) .
&quot; the &amp; digi@@ ous ; vig@@ net@@ ting correction is a tool to correct the vig@@ net@@ ting , i.e. under@@ exposed corners , of an image . &quot;
&quot; wide angle lenses , especially the medium and large photo format , can often not illumin@@ ate the entire sensor range . instead &amp; quot ; vig@@ net@@ tier@@ en@@ quot ; ( sh@@ aded ) they reduce the corners and edges of the picture by reducing the light that reaches the sensor . Tel@@ e@@ lenses also show this behavior . &quot;
&quot; many center filters need a factor 1.5 or 2 with the aper@@ ture filter , which increases the necessary sh@@ utter speed under certain circumstances . wide angle lenses should also be used with center filters , an aper@@ ture of f / 16 or smaller , since otherwise unwanted effects are caused by movement . &quot;
&quot; with the great exposure area of today &apos;s film and film sc@@ anners , it is possible to simul@@ ate the effect of an Center@@ filter by using an equi@@ val@@ ente transformation in a rough image that was made without this filter . the tool vig@@ net@@ ting correction is used to transform the transformation with an Center@@ filter on an image . the algorithm is protected by copyright by John Walker . &quot;
&quot; with three regul@@ ators , you can control the vig@@ net@@ ting correction filter and with three more expos@@ ures of the target image . &quot;
&quot; density : this parameter controls the degree of light ampli@@ fication at the point of the greatest density the filter . the standard density is 2.0 , resulting in an optical filter with an aper@@ ture of 1 , or by chance to compens@@ ate a greater degree of vig@@ net@@ ting , reduce it by a small degree to compens@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; lumin@@ ous intensity , contrast and g@@ amma settings : editing an image with the vig@@ net@@ ting correction reduces the brightness of the pixels . you need to re @-@ adjust the exposure of the target image using these options . the controls provide only positive values , as you only need to increase the settings . &quot;
&quot; if you want a fin@@ er read@@ ju@@ stment of the target image , let the values for lumin@@ osity / contrast / g@@ amma at zero and use the gra@@ dation from the &amp; digi@@ came ; image editing from the Color Gra@@ dation menu . &quot;
this is an example of the vig@@ net@@ ting correction to a picture . the original image ( 1 ) shows the vig@@ net@@ ting in the corners and ( 2 ) the corrected image . a lumin@@ ous and contrast correction was also performed in the image with this tool .
the &amp; digi@@ came ; lens distortion is a tool to correct the impact of spher@@ ical lenses on photos . it uses a copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorithm by David Hod@@ son .
this tool works with geometric distor@@ tions . colour distor@@ tions cannot be corrected with this tool .
the coefficient of the second degree covers the general geomet@@ rical distortion of the lens and can correct the conc@@ ave or con@@ ve@@ x form of the image .
&quot; the coefficient of the third degree has a similar round effect , but fla@@ p on the edges . this correction is not applied in the tool . &quot;
the coefficient fourth gra@@ des fixes the distant corners opposite to that of the second gra@@ der . if you combine these two can almost eliminated any geomet@@ rical distortion .
&quot; general : this value controls the strength of distortion second gra@@ ding . with negative values , ton@@ ical distor@@ tions can be corrected and positive values can be distor@@ ted . &quot;
corner : this value controls the strength of distortion fourth gra@@ dient . this value appears more strongly at the edges than in the middle of the picture . for most lenses the &apos; corners parameter has the inver@@ ted character of the parameter .
zoom : this value re@@ scales the image size and thus creates a correction of the first gra@@ der . negative values increase while positive the image dimin@@ ishes .
note : this value adju@@ sts the brightness in the corners of the picture . negative values decrease the brightness of the image in the corners while positive values increase it .
&quot; to help you find the best filter settings , the dialog shows the distortion correction . the values you use for your image are saved and used as default values at the next start . &quot;
&quot; the correction should be performed before all trimm@@ ing or size changes . in case you re @-@ cut a picture and then perform a ton @-@ shaped correction , the effect would be obvious to the false . &quot;
&quot; to help you find the best correction , this tool provides you with a vertical and horizontal guide . move it to an important place like e.g. the sea edge or a building wall , in your picture and press the left mouse button to fix the lines at this point . &quot;
&quot; if you correct a cushion @-@ like distortion , the resulting image will have black corners . you can remove them with the cutting tool in the Edit menu transformation from image processing or via the Zoom slider of this dialog . &quot;
&quot; for most pictures , the ton@@ ical correction is enough . the next logical step for some motives , such as photos from the front , frame and paintings , is to correct the perspective so that all angles in the picture have 90 degrees . &quot;
this is an example of the ton@@ ical correction applied to a church in Norway . the original image is under ( 1 ) and the corrected picture below ( 2 ) .
&quot; the algorithm is based on a method for simul@@ ating infrared film of the G@@ imp@@ Gur@@ u@@ .org website that is available under this URL . the filter re@@ produces the known Il@@ ford ( t@@ m ) SF@@ X@@ 200 I@@ infr@@ ar@@ ot@@ film , see this URL . this film has a sensitivity range of 200 @-@ 800 ISO . &quot;
&quot; in the left side of the window , you can select the area for preview . if you move the red rect@@ angle with the mouse , you can view the effect on different parts of the image . &quot;
below the preview you can set two parameters of film gran@@ ularity and film sensitivity ( ISO ) . the ISO regulator changes the amount of film gran@@ ularity and domin@@ ance of colour green ( chlor@@ ophy@@ ll in nature ) . green meadows are white like snow !
&quot; since the filter color channels are mixed to re@@ produce infrared film , especially the green channel makes no sense to apply the effect on black / white photos as the colour information is missing . &quot;
this is an example of the infrared film type applied to a landscape foto from New Zealand . the original image is under ( 1 ) and the edited picture below ( 2 ) . the sensitivity of the film was set to ISO 400 . higher ISO values generate a kind of au@@ ra in the top lights .
&quot; this is known by classic high @-@ speed films such as the B / W Ko@@ da@@ k Tr@@ i @-@ X . to increase the sensitivity of the films , the manufacturers mix large silver grains of photo@@ emul@@ sion . &quot;
&quot; the screen effect gives your photo a certain mood or seems to move back into the past . the treated image gets a timeless atmosphere detached from everyday life . if you want to use this special , gallery @-@ like , stre@@ ak view especially in your mon@@ ochro@@ me photos , you have to use this filter . &quot;
&quot; the controller can calibr@@ ate the ISO sensitivity to control the intensity and gran@@ ularity of the grains . if you need more grains , you can apply the filter several times . &quot;
this is an example of the screen saver effect applied to a black / white picture . the original image is the ( 1 ) and that worked the ( 2 ) . the used film sensitivity corresponds to ISO @-@ 1600 .
the &amp; digi@@ ous filter oil paintings creates the appearance of an oil painting . it uses a protected algorithm by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
the &amp; digi@@ ous filter oil painting gives your digital images a nice look like an oil painting . nature pictures and still life are good for this effect .
&quot; there are two kno@@ bs to influence this effect . the upper el@@ ects the brush size between one and five . th@@ icker brushes are better for large pictures . smoothing the smooth@@ ness or , seen from the other side , the hin@@ ge . &quot;
this is an example of the oil painting effect . the original picture is marked with the ( 1 ) and the processing is marked with the ( 2 ) . brush size for this 640 Pixel size is 1 and smooth@@ ed 17 .
&quot; the &amp; digi@@ came ; filter coal drawing uses color and intensity gra@@ dients to create a carbon sket@@ ch . therefore , images whose gra@@ dients are slowly changing are not ideal for this effect . it is helpful if you imagine what scene you would have chosen to sket@@ ch you . this would be good pictures to start with it . &quot;
there are two controllers with a value range from 1 to 100 to control this effect . the upper controller sel@@ ects the pin size and the lower adju@@ sts the contrast ( smooth@@ ed ) .
this is an example of the char@@ coal drawing filter . the original image ( 1 ) and the modified image ( 2 ) . the default settings of 30 and 10 were used . the result can be further improved by adjusting the intensity value .
the &amp; digi@@ came ; Filter Grav@@ ur shapes your image in 3 @-@ D as if it was st@@ amped in wax . it uses a copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorithm of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
the filter uses the differences between color and intensity to transform the image into a gray and mon@@ dar@@ ing landscape .
&quot; the depth allows to adjust the contrast of the filtration . a value of 30 , corresponds to 10 % , is the default setting . &quot;
this is an example of the engraving filter . the original ( 1 ) and the processed picture ( 2 ) . the used depth is 10 % .
with this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a work of art using distortion effects . it uses protected algorithms from Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
wave Blocks 1 : divide the image into cells and look like it is viewed through glass blocks .
wave Blocks 2 : analog@@ ous to the wave blocks 1 the image is distor@@ ted here with another version of glass blocks .
some effects need a long time to calculate and generate a high CPU load . you can cancel these effects at any time using the button Finish .
with this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a work of art using Un@@ shar@@ pen@@ ing Effects . it uses copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorithms from Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
zoom Un@@ shar@@ fe : bl@@ urred the image along star @-@ shaped lines that eman@@ ate from one center . this simul@@ ates the sharp@@ ness of a zo@@ oming camera and thus creates a dynamic expression of the often shown in sports photography .
radi@@ al sharp@@ ness : bl@@ urred the image by turning the pixels at a center . this simul@@ ates the sharp@@ ness of a rotating camera .
distance shar@@ pen@@ ing : wi@@ pe the picture to create the effect of a non @-@ focused camera lens . the object seems to step back into the background .
&quot; motion bl@@ urred : bl@@ urred the image by horizontal movements of pixels . this simul@@ ates the sharp@@ ness of a linear moving , z : B : from a car or train photographer , camera . &quot;
&quot; soft@@ ness : bl@@ urred the image sof@@ tly in the dark and strong in the bright tones . this creates photos with a dre@@ amy and shiny soft focus effect ( Hamilton effect ) . this is ideal for creating romantic portraits , gl@@ am@@ our photos or adding a warm and subtle light . &quot;
sharp@@ ness : bl@@ urred the image by acci@@ dental shift of pixels and thus simul@@ ates the sharp@@ ness of a random@@ ly moving camera .
intelligent Un@@ shar@@ pen@@ ing : finds the tank in the picture and wi@@ pe them without changing the rest .
&quot; mos@@ aic : divi@@ des the photo into rectangular cells and then creates it , by filling with an average pixel value , new . &quot;
some effects need a long time to calculate and cause a high CPU load . you can therefore cancel this calculation at any time using the button Finish .
the ra@@ ind@@ ro@@ ps are a nice little tool to make ra@@ ind@@ ro@@ ps on your image . this gives it natural to your images a wet look . it uses one of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorithm .
dro@@ ple@@ t size allows to change the size of the drops . since the size of the dro@@ ple@@ t is not automatically growing with the size of the image it is often necessary to decrease the size for small images . number changes the number and density of drops .
&quot; you can use the &amp; digi@@ me ; image processing to hold an area free of ra@@ ind@@ ro@@ ps . use the selection tool to select the area , e.g. a face that should remain free . if you then start the filter ra@@ ind@@ ro@@ ps the area will remain free of rain drops . &quot;
this is an example of the rain drops Fil@@ ters . the original image ( 1 ) shows a quiet sunset and the edited picture ( 2 ) indicates a sunset after a storm . the default values were used for this example .
&quot; if the photo has the wrong orientation , you can bring it through mirrors or turning into the right direction . the tools can be found in the Edit menu Transformation or transforming mirrors . &quot;
infl@@ ating is definitely one of the most advanced tools to enlarge a photo with a minimal loss of image quality .
the big question is how can you infl@@ ate a picture and keep the details sharp ? how can you zoom in a picture when the limits of the resolution are reached ? how can you re @-@ locate the missing information or guess it ? the C@@ Im@@ g algorithm that is used here makes a good work here . try it and you will see it yourself .
&quot; if a photo has the wrong size , you can scale it to the desired size with the tool size . choose transform@@ ative size change in the menu and specify the target values . the dialog is to be seen below . &quot;
&quot; the tool to change size uses a linear inter@@ pol@@ ation method to t@@ weak the pixels . if you want to enlarge a small picture with a better quality , try the tool for blowing . &quot;
&quot; many image processing programs use a kind of inter@@ pol@@ ation , e.g. spl@@ ine inter@@ pol@@ ation to enlarge an image . &amp; digi@@ came ; uses a further developed approach . the underlying algorithm photo was developed by the I@@ MAG@@ E team of the Gre@@ c CN@@ RS laboratories in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project . &quot;
you must tell the tool how you want to change the size . these settings are available in the tab New Size and are listed below :
&quot; if this setting is enabled , the aspect ratio of the original image is retained when entering the new size . &quot;
&quot; regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter affects larger structures . the higher this value is set , the more is smooth@@ ed . even if you want to create a &apos; van Gog@@ h &apos; turbul@@ ence effect , it must be set higher than 3 . &quot;
&quot; buttons Save As and Lo@@ ading are used exactly for this purpose , and each one can be enlarged as a text file , and can be re@@ charged later . &quot;
&quot; infl@@ ating is very fast with what it does , but it can take a long time and pull a high CPU load . you can cancel the calculation at any time using the button Finish . &quot;
you can see below an example of photo bub@@ bles by enlar@@ ging a small color on the double size . the original is ( 1 ) and the enlarged picture ( 3 ) . the preview ( 2 ) is the result of linear standard magni@@ fication .
&quot; the editing of a photo is not only a frequently performed surgery , but also a frequently under@@ estimated tool to create a picture . the image processing allows you to create a picture with the mouse , by pressing the mouse button and drag@@ ging the rect@@ angle , then you will see this rect@@ angle while you move the mouse . &quot;
&quot; when you release the mouse button again , the area of the photos will be cut off . you can change the size of the area to be cut by drag@@ ging on the corners of the rect@@ angle . create a new rect@@ angle by simply pressing the left mouse button . &quot;
&quot; once you are satisfied with the cutting , use the button The C@@ utting button of image editing in the toolbar and the photo is cut ( Ctr@@ l ; + X ) . &quot;
&quot; in the preview area , you can change the size of the rect@@ angle by drag@@ ging the corners with the mouse . the aspect ratio that you have defined in the dialog remains . &quot;
&quot; in the mold After the aspect ratio , you can specify orientation as portrait format or landscape format . in the portrait mode , the larger value of the height and in the landscape format is assigned to the width . &quot;
&quot; this means that it is always the same regardless of whether you use centimet@@ ers , inch or any other physical size . you can e.g. see below a list of traditional sizes for photo paper and their aspect ratio . &quot;
&quot; at the right end of the dialog , there are two buttons to automatically center the selection horizont@@ ally or ver@@ tically . &quot;
&quot; in the dialog box below , you can use the Max @-@ ratio button to cut the area to the maximum possible , depending on the chosen ratio and orientation . &quot;
&quot; the tool after aspect ratio automatically saves its settings depending on the image orientation ( horizontal or vertical ) . if you use the cutting tool the next time , these settings are stored as default values in the EX@@ IF tables , so that the EX@@ IF data will reflect the cut image and not the original image . &quot;
the settings of the co @-@ operation help allow you to f@@ ade assistance so that you can better put your pictures together . these help are :
harmon@@ ic triangle : harmon@@ ic divisions are based on the principle of simil@@ arity .
&quot; golden centre : the golden centre is a division which is based on various natural growth patterns , such as the spiral of Nau@@ til@@ us shell or the flower leaves of a sun@@ flower . it appears in all sorts of things that we feel as beautiful . &quot;
&quot; the golden division is the Ir@@ ration@@ ale number 1,6@@ 18@@ 03@@ 39@@ 88 ... and you have been used by the ancient Egyptians and Greeks , so that your temples and pyram@@ ids constructed it in all times when you put your pictures , buildings and even photos to give your creations a natural order and beauty . &quot;
&quot; the number is derived from the Fi@@ bon@@ acc@@ i sequence 1 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 , 8 , 13 , 21 , 34 &amp; etc . the resulting divi@@ der is 1 : 1.6@@ 18 the golden centre . the resulting divi@@ der is considered visually harmonious . &quot;
the golden centre provides liquid auxiliary lines when you put together a picture . these aids are listed below :
&quot; the golden spiral will bring you to your goal good results for your photos . compared to the third rule , the golden spiral produces a liquid line that can follow the eye through the image . this type of composition leads the gaze of the viewer along the line of the spiral and creates a symm@@ etrical visual flow . &quot;
&quot; another rule is the rec@@ tan@@ gles of the golden spiral , also called golden rec@@ tan@@ gles . &quot;
&quot; the Golden tri@@ angles are also derived from the golden spir@@ als discussed above . their ver@@ tices are the middle points of the sides of the golden rect@@ angle . note that , unlike the harmon@@ ic tri@@ angles , golden tri@@ angles are no simultaneous tri@@ angles . &quot;
&quot; if you use golden tri@@ angles to break your frame , you create an effect of the dynamic symm@@ etry of professional photographers . try to place your image focus on one of the intersection and other visual information in the tri@@ angles . the result is a very attractive composition that you cannot achieve differently . &quot;
the horizontal mirror and vertical mirror options can be used to reflect the harmon@@ ic divisions .
&quot; with the button color you can set the color of the auxiliary lines . if you have a picture with many colors and a high contrast , the guides can be invisible . this way you can adjust the color of lines to your current image . &quot;
the Free Rotation is a tool to rotate an image around any angle .
&quot; if you make a photo , it happens easily that you don &apos;t hold the camera exactly ver@@ tically or horizont@@ ally . this creates a picture in which things are rot@@ ated by an angle . you can do this with the &amp; digi@@ ous ; image editing and the tool free rotation . select Trans@@ action Free Rotation and adjust the target angle . &quot;
rotate your picture with the slider angle . the values on this slider are set in degrees . a preview of the rotation is available on the right side of the window . a preview of the rotation is displayed on the right side of the window . the new dimensions of the image are shown at the top right of the window .
&quot; for your help , the Free Rotation module provides a horizontal and vertical line . move the mouse cursor in the image preview to position the two lines . after you have moved it over an important point of the image , you can fix it with a pressure on the left mouse button . now adjust the angle as described in previous section . &quot;
&quot; once you shot a picture you will find unwanted tri@@ angular holes in the corners . a way to repair it , it is the function transform@@ ating cutting from the image processing . &quot;
an elegant way to trim the picture is automatic cutting . choose one of the following options :
&quot; the anti @-@ ali@@ asing option smooth@@ es the image a bit after rotation , but notice the above warning . &quot;
all perspective trans@@ formations are performed around a fixed point of the so @-@ called reference point . this point is in the middle of the picture and is represented by a red circle .
&quot; to change the perspective , you need to use the red squares at the corners of your image . the preview will then be automatically re @-@ calculated . on the right side of the dialog you will find some information that will help you change the perspective : &quot;
&quot; new width : displays the width of the new image , including the empty areas created by the transformation , in pixels . &quot;
&quot; new height : indicates the height of the new image , including the empty areas created by the transformation , in pixels . &quot;
angle left above : displays the current angle in degrees at the top left corner of the transformed area .
angle on the right : displays the current angle in degrees at the upper right corner of the transformed area .
angle left below : displays the current angle in degrees at the lower left corner of the transformed area .
angle on the right : displays the current angle in degrees at the lower right corner of the transformed area .
&quot; after adjusting the perspective , the image becomes a little dirty . for a single adaptation , this effect is small but two adap@@ tations generate twice as strong effect and you should avoid this if possible . &quot;
&quot; once you have adapted the perspective , you will get unwanted tri@@ angular holes at the corners . one way to regret it is to cut the picture with trans@@ formations from the image processing . &quot;
&quot; with other words , a rect@@ angle is distor@@ ted into a parall@@ el@@ ogram . in other words , a rect@@ angle is turned into a parall@@ el@@ ogram . you can start this module about trans@@ formers . &quot;
&quot; adjust your image by using the horizontal angle and vertical angle . if you click on pres@@ ets , the angle will be reset to zero . a preview of the effect will be displayed to you and the new dimensions of the target picture will be displayed on the right of the preview area . &quot;
&quot; your help will move a vertical and horizontal line . move the mouse to an important point , such as the lake , a wall from a building on your picture and press the left mouse button to fix the lines . you can now use the tool to adjust your image . &quot;
&quot; after you have done the she@@ ar , the image becomes a bit wi@@ ped . for a single she@@ ar this effect is usually neg@@ li@@ gible , but two she@@ ar causes twice as much confusion and therefore you should avoid this . &quot;
&quot; after she@@ ering , the picture has un@@ beautiful tri@@ angular holes in the corners . one way to eliminate it is to cut the picture with trans@@ formations from the image processing . &quot;
&quot; the available formats depend on your system and , in some cases , by the way these libraries have been compiled . in most distri@@ butions you will be able to edit a large number of formats with &amp; digi@@ ous ; &quot;
&quot; because of this dependence on other libraries , it is impossible to give a list of all file formats available on their system . however , they will always find JPEG and TIFF below . &quot;
&quot; if the extension is listed in the list , this is done by means of the file extension and a comparison of those with a pre@@ defined list . if the extension is listed in the list , the file extension will be displayed . in the configuration section you can find more information about this . &quot;
almost all digital cameras store photos in one of two formats : JPEG or TIFF . some cameras even allow you to select the format to be used . a more detailed description of these file formats can be found in Wikipedia . &amp; digi@@ came ; supports both formats .
image compression is the application of data compression procedures to digital images . redund@@ ant information is reduced to save the image data in a more efficient way .
&quot; JPEG 2000 is also supported . generally , there is better , smo@@ other results than JPEG in the same compression ratio . the 200@@ 0s version can also be saved los@@ s@@ less when specified in the settings . &quot;
&quot; if you want to learn more about the raw image format , please refer to Wikipedia , The L@@ umin@@ ous Land@@ scape and Cambridge in Colour very helpful instructions in English . &quot;
&quot; the table below shows a short list of shell formats that are supported by &amp; digi@@ came , supported : &quot;
many digital cameras support the recording of short films . these clips are often saved in the A@@ VI@@ - or MPEG format .
go forward to the previously visited album in the Chron@@ icle . you can only go forward if you have gone back before .

all configured cameras are listed here . you can add the entry camera from the menu to add a new camera to the list .
K@@ IP@@ I module has a series of images exported to a K@@ ML @-@ structure . K@@ ML files can be opened and displayed with Goo@@ g@@ le@@ Earth .
&quot; if you exchange steps 4 and 5 , what you can do well if the initial contrast was already very good , then you can carry out the first four adjustments with the white balance module . &quot;
many tools you need the photo processing are included in &amp; digi@@ came ; included . your description follows here .
&quot; all image processing tools such as shar@@ pen@@ ing , soft symbols , noise supp@@ ression , re@@ focus , bl@@ urred mas@@ king , &amp; etc ; . use a uniform dialog type that displays the effect in a preview before the filter is applied to the current picture . below you can see &amp; quot ; Tex@@ ture applic@@ ations@@ quot ; in this dialog : &quot;
( 1 ) : this progress bar shows the status of the filter to the current picture . to the left of it allow five buttons to change the comparison mode of the preview area . these modes are :
the left pane shows the original and the right shows the filter applied to the right of the selected preview area .
horizontal parts without dup@@ licate . the upper range indicates the original and the bottom shows the filter applied to the area below the selected preview area .
the left pane shows the original and the right to compare the effect of the filter .
horizontal divide . the upper area shows the original and the lower relative to the effect of the filter .
&quot; mouse over &apos; -@@ Style : shows the preview if the mouse is not in the preview area , and otherwise the original . &quot;
( 2 ) : there are two buttons that you can turn on to show over@@ - and under@@ exposure . the used colors can be adjusted in the general setting page .
( 3 ) : the frame to select the preview . you can drag this frame with the mouse inside the image and place on the part of the picture you want to preview . preview in the left part of the dialog is immediately updated .
( 5 ) : in the lower left corner : here is a help and the possibility to reset all buttons to your default values . all settings from the last use of the module are noted .
the page bar features the essential information about the selected image and is largely self @-@ explan@@ atory . it is group@@ ed in the following sections :
photographic characteristics : shows a summary of the most important parameters in shooting the photos . these data origin@@ ate from the EX@@ IF data when they are available .
this tab provides an intuitive map search tool based on the Mar@@ ble Mini@@ program . you can move it in or out with the mouse wheel . press Ctr@@ l ; left mouse button to move a square . all images within these coordinates are fil@@ tered and displayed .
&amp; k@@ color@@ edit ; is an editor for pall@@ ets files . the application can be used to edit color pal@@ ettes and for selecting and marking colors .
&quot; the pall@@ ets files used by &amp; k@@ de ; can be installed either for the entire system or only one user . in the latter case , they are in your Personal folder for &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ settings and hot user defined color and last used colors . &quot;
&quot; in the dialog box , you can select from a list of installed pall@@ ets or browse the folders for files . &quot;
the cursor is shown in the pallet view as line . it can be moved by clicking on the area next to a color .
it shows the colour next to it . the color is described under the pallet view . here the color name can also be changed .
&quot; to create such a selection , click on the area next to a color to move the cursor there . then move the mouse over pressed left mouse button . &quot;
&quot; if the check@@ box is past@@ ed under the button color , the color is inserted from the color table on the cursor . the color is either inserted or over@@ writes another ; depending on whether the mode over@@ write is selected . you can set this mode by selecting the check@@ box over@@ write under Bei@@ m cursor . &quot;
&quot; a selection that was created as described in the last section , can be used together with the actions copying , cutting and inser@@ ting . &quot;
&quot; use the following format for data in the clip@@ board : for each color three values for the portions of red , green and blue and an optional color name followed by a new@@ line sign , if another color follows . if there are three numerical values in the clip@@ board , these can be inserted as a color in &amp; col@@ edit ; &quot;
the colors in the palette and the output of colors can be drag@@ ged with the mouse .
select a color somewhere on the screen and then find them in the color selection on the left .
&amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; is a K@@ DE program for viewing &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; programs are free layout programs . so far there was no modern &amp; GUI ; program to visu@@ alize graphs . the programs that include &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; programs are based on the program author ( s &amp; X@@ 11 ; - or &amp; t@@ cl@@ t@@ k ; programs with only a few functions .
the &amp; k@@ Graph@@ viewer ; project aims to replace these programs with a modern and user @-@ friendly graphical interface with all functions of a well integrated &amp; k@@ de ; program .
&amp; k@@ Graph@@ viewer ; is a K@@ DE program for viewing &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ dot ; graphs ; Graph@@ ene ; Graph@@ ene ; Graph@@ ene with all possibilities of a well integrated &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ program in a modern and user @-@ friendly &amp; GUI ; an . it has the following functions :
integration into &amp; unique ; and &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; ( so that a change of the graph is in &amp; makes ; the graph is re @-@ calculated and in &amp; k@@ graph@@ ic@@ viewer ; )
menu to open the graph in &amp; are ; to open or open the graph in &amp; k@@ graph@@ Viewer ; in a &amp; unique ; -@@ component to open

&quot; other needed software : &amp; k@@ graph@@ ic@@ viewer ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ program , which pres@@ upp@@ oses the &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ Tool &amp; dot ; required for depic@@ tion of graphs . &quot;
&quot; the main window displays the opened graphs , each in its own sub @-@ window . initially , if you start &amp; k@@ graph@@ ed ; without starting an argument , the toolbar only contains the symbol file and the ( empty ) list contains last opened files . click on the first icon to open the dialog file . &quot;
&quot; after you have selected one or more &amp; dot files , the main window looks like in the lower screen shot : &quot;
&quot; as you can see , an overview is displayed in the corner if the graph is larger than the canvas . &quot;
&quot; use the mouse wheel ( high and down without special keys , left and right with pressed &amp; alt ; key ) ; &quot;
zoom is limited in both directions by the factor 10 . below you can see the maximum reduction of a graph .
&quot; when the file is currently in &amp; k@@ graph@@ viewer ; loaded file has been modified by another program , the following window will be displayed : &quot;
&quot; you can choose whether the graph should be re@@ charged or if you want to ignore the change . if you want to change your decision later , you can change the menu item Settings k@@ Graph@@ Viewer ; setup ... use , see also . &quot;
&quot; when you open a graph file outside a running &amp; k@@ graphical user ; instance open , &amp; eg ; in the file browser or at the command line , you have the choice if you want to open a new &amp; k@@ graph@@ ic@@ viewer ; instance , or wish to display the graphs in a sub @-@ window of the already running instance . &quot;
&quot; as with the last option , you can save your choice permanently , but also change it afterwards with the Setup dialog . &quot;
&quot; with the program start , you can re@@ open all graphs of your last session . again , you can save your choice both save and later . &quot;
you can also specify how the graph should be split up to several pages . the number of horizontal and vertical sides can be freely chosen .
&quot; if you use multiple pages , you can choose whether the parts of the graph will be adapted to this page . if you keep the aspect ratio , the pages may not be filled from the respective parts of the graph . &quot;
side preview with a graph distributed on several pages without head@@ line and with another font
&quot; the Renew@@ able Store site speci@@ fies the ability to specify behavior when a file has been modified on the hard drive , &amp; eg ; from another program . you can set a default behavior ( automatically rel@@ o@@ ad or ignore the changes ) or let the program ask for each time . &quot;
opening gives the possibility to specify the behavior of &amp; k@@ graph@@ viewers ; specify when a graph is opened outside a running session . you can set a default behavior for this case ( open the graphs in a new window or in a sub@@ window of the already running session ) or determine that each time is asked .
the session management page gives the possibility to specify the starting behavior of &amp; k@@ graph@@ viewers ; specify a default behavior ( open or not open the files of the last session or not ) or determine if you want to be asked at any start .
&quot; the context menu , which normally appears with a click in the main window with the &amp; R@@ MB@@ n ; opens further options : &quot;
here you can choose between different &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; layout algorithms . the entries as described on the website of &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; are :
&quot; the algorithm lays the edges in the same direction ( from top to bottom or from left to right ) , trying to produce as short edges and as few edge overl@@ aps as possible . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; ne@@ ato ; algorithm is the standard for ung@@ eri@@ zed graphs . it produces represent@@ ations according to the spring model . thereby , the Kam@@ ada Ka@@ wa@@ i algorithm is used , which is syn@@ onymous with statistical multi @-@ dimensional sc@@ aling . &quot;
the &amp; fd@@ p ; algorithm generates a spring@@ spring model layout for un@@ eri@@ zed graphs . it uses the Fru@@ cht@@ man Rein@@ gold @-@ He@@ uris@@ tics and includes a multi @-@ grid trigger for the treatment of large and clu@@ ster@@ ly graphs .
&quot; the &amp; Cir@@ co ; algorithm calcul@@ ates the no@@ des circular in line with the description of Six and Tol@@ lis , 1999 , and K@@ auff@@ man and Wiese , 2002 . it is useful for certain diagrams of multiple cycli@@ c structures . &quot;
&quot; open a dialog where you can specify a layout command , which is then executed by a shell . with such a layout command you can select &amp; eg ; den &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ algorithms can change special options , or change the graphs with a filter before it is drawn . &quot;
determines the type of graph ( directed or un@@ balanced ) and uses the default algorithm for the respective type ( dot ; for directional &amp; ne@@ ato ; for non @-@ aller@@ genic graphs ) .
&quot; if this setting is enabled , the overview is displayed if necessary . otherwise it will not be displayed and the positioning menu is in@@ active . &quot;

read the K@@ IP@@ I Module Images for extrac@@ ting new images and calibr@@ ate them .
this module can be used to read and store new images from external sources . currently two sources can be used :
scan images : use the K@@ oo@@ ka interface to read images from a scanner that supports the SAN@@ E project or another source such as Video Stre@@ ams .
&quot; when you open the menu item images , a dialog box that lets you select between all available sources on your computer . select the source from which you want to pick up the image . you can also set the default source for the next time . &quot;
&quot; after that , the K@@ oo@@ ka window appears by sub@@ stit@@ uting the default value duc@@ ed to select your image accordingly . see the preview and adjust the image to your needs before clicking with the button scanning the image . the estimated file size will be displayed in the right , lower corner . in the K@@ oo@@ ka manual you will find more information . &quot;
&quot; make sure that the window will be displayed completely , as some settings otherwise may not be displayed . &quot;
&quot; after you have pressed the button scanning , you have to wait until the scan is finished and the window to set the options of the image file appears . please remember that the BMP file is not compressed and therefore very large files are created . you must also select the folder &amp; # 160 ; select or create the image saved . &quot;
screen@@ shots you can create after you have selected in the menu Import &gt; Screen Picture ... a window appears in which you can set the different screen photography :
select the complete work area to read a single window under the mouse .
&quot; if your own program window is selected , the calling program will disappear so you can see other screens and windows . otherwise , after a short delay , read the currently visible work@@ station , only the window under the mouse will be read . &quot;
&quot; the delay controls how long screen shot will wait before it starts . if you need to switch to other des@@ kt@@ ops , you should select this delay high enough to have the time to navigate . &quot;
&quot; after the screen@@ shot was made , the dialog offers options for the target image with the options described above . &quot;

&quot; the K@@ IP@@ I module for geographic loc@@ alization allows to add and edit GPS coordinates in the metadata of an image , and the geographical data is stored in the EX@@ IF key and the loc@@ alization can be displayed in a map in an external browser . &quot;
&quot; the K@@ IP@@ I module for geographic location makes tools available to locate images geograph@@ ically in the spher@@ ical coordinate system used by GPS and Galil@@ eo , to locate height , long@@ itude and latitude . &quot;
to cor@@ relate your pictures with geographic data you need a GPS Track as XML file in g@@ px format . g@@ ps@@ b@@ abel and g@@ ps@@ man can download and convert the data for you from your GPS device .
image Geo@@ graphic loc@@ alization cor@@ rel@@ ator . this interface can lead a number of previously selected images with a GPS track .
&quot; select the images you want to cor@@ relate in the main window and call the menu . to run a possible correlation over time and loc@@ alization , you need to load a track file with GP@@ X file . of course , this file contains data that were recorded at the same locations as the pictures of your camera . &quot;
&quot; when the file is loaded , an automatic correlation performs the coordinates in red . GPS track data are recorded in GMT time and therefore the camera time must be converted to GMT . this can be done with the time zone . set your camera line here . &quot;
&quot; the setting for the maximum time devi@@ ation indicates an upper devi@@ ation for the GPS @-@ time and camera time . if the devi@@ ation below , the data is merged . the maximum value for this is 2000 seconds . &quot;
if you don &apos;t have track data from a place for pictures you can edit the g@@ px file manually and add to the pictures . the time difference of 2000 seconds will cor@@ relate all images in this area .
&quot; the options inter@@ pol@@ ation and difference in minutes can be used if you don &apos;t have matching data . if you know that in reality a loc@@ alization lies between camera and GPS , you can set these limits here and then press the button cor@@ relations to inter@@ pol@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; the coordinates can be set manually with this dialog . this is useful when you have a number of photos on the same place . as the dialog shows the coordinates from one call to the next , you only need to use the button OK to set the data in the current photo . &quot;
&quot; the location can also be selected and set by the displayed map . select the relevant region and enlarge it again and again , until you have reached an adequate accuracy . the card can be selected manually between map mode , satellite image and a mixed mode . &quot;
&quot; completely outside of the K@@ IP@@ I module , there are possibilities to attach the GPS data to the pictures . here is a small script that the ex@@ i@@ ft@@ ool is used to provide a stack of images with GPS data . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I module picture gallery is a tool to export a set of albums as HTML pages .
this module can export your albums into a gallery from HTML pages to version 4.0@@ 1 . you can select the albums that are exported as HTML pages and specify the parameters for the HTML pages . the character set is enco@@ ded UT@@ F @-@ 8 to allow the best internation@@ alization possible .
&quot; with the three buttons on the right , you can quickly select a large number of albums . with the three buttons on the right , you can quickly select a large number of albums . &quot;
&quot; the tab image defines the general appearance and layout for each page . this tab is largely self explan@@ atory . if you click on a picture , a new page will be opened in which the image will be displayed . otherwise , the picture will be displayed directly to your standard picture viewer , &amp; eg ; Ku@@ ick@@ show &quot;
&quot; the Tab@@ s album defines the settings where and how the gallery should be saved with all your related images . select a folder on which you have write permission . a sub@@ folder named K@@ IP@@ I@@ HTML@@ Export , which contains everything , will be created there . &quot;
&quot; if you select the JPEG file format , the EX@@ IF information of your original images will also be saved in the new pictures . &quot;
&quot; with other color depth , you can change the default color depth . the file size also influences the file size . all other settings are self explan@@ atory . &quot;
&quot; the rider &apos;s thumb@@ nails allow you to customize some of the settings from the album tab for the thumb@@ nails , these are small images which are displayed in the gallery . &quot;
a progress window shows the user how far the action is . press Cancel to break the process .
&quot; if the module generates the pages , the window will not be closed automatically . therefore , you can read the program messages to determine if errors occur during production . the web browser will automatically start to preview the gallery . press Close to close the module . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I picture viewer is a very fast and flexible Open@@ GL @-@ based tool to view images .
&quot; the K@@ IP@@ I picture viewer allows you to view a selection of pictures and perform basic operations such as rotation , zo@@ oming , or sliding . the viewer can be used with short commands and folders . it has been developed for fast frame display and quick access to its functions . &quot;
&quot; after the start , an image is displayed by default in full screen mode . this can be changed into a window mode . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I JPEG Los@@ s@@ less module is a tool to change images without compromising your quality .
&quot; this module allows to store images in JPEG format for the actions below , without the usual loss of quality or metadata . &quot;
&quot; the consequence of loss @-@ free storage is that the file size increases , since no compression of color information takes place . this can be found in PNG format . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I module digital camera client is a tool to connect your computer to a digital camera .
the K@@ IP@@ I module digital camera client has no documentation yet . if you are interested in writing this please contact the mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I team at k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de.@@ or@@ g. Attention : the participants of this list speak English .
the K@@ IP@@ I module metadata editor currently has no documentation . if you want to change this situation please contact the mailing list k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .org of the K@@ IP@@ I team .
&quot; with the import function of metadata module , you can copy data from one image to another . then select the image you want to copy in the main program and then call the file selection dialog with which you want to copy the target image , so the image to which you want to copy the metadata . the data will be copied after clicking OK . &quot;
&quot; this function does not work with all image formats . you can copy from anywhere , but not in any target format . JPEG is supported when writing . please refer to ex@@ iv@@ 2 to see which formats are supported . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I MPEG Co@@ di@@ ver Module is a tool to convert a series of images into a MPEG video in the form of a slideshow .
&quot; the MPEG Co@@ dec module can be used to convert selected images into a MPEG video , with a defined length , to convert . this module uses the pack@@ ets M@@ jp@@ eg@@ Tools and Image@@ Mag@@ ick . you can also add an audio file in MP@@ 2 or WAV of the slideshow . &quot;
all images are automatically sc@@ aled to the correct size for the selected video format . additionally you can create a background color for the slide show . with this module it is possible to create the formats DVD / X@@ VCD / SV@@ CD / VCD for your DVD player . you can finally use the K@@ 3@@ b program to burn the medium .
&quot; first you need to select the images you want to pack into the MPEG Di@@ asch@@ au . after that , you can start using Extras MPEG Di@@ asch@@ au to start the module . &quot;
the images you select are then listed under image files in the Portfolio . there you can also change the images or the contents of the list .
&quot; when you are satisfied with your list , you should adjust the other settings . the video format can be selected from various formats , DVD , X@@ VCD , SV@@ CD and VCD . PAL is pres@@ et and most probably the right choice for Europe . &quot;
&quot; in the next step , you should specify the time in seconds the one image is indicated . the speed of the image transition is defined below . a low value generates very sudden , a high contrast very smooth image change . &quot;
&quot; the background color can be set next . in doubt , you should leave them black . you can set the name and path of the generated file under Name of the MPEG output file . &quot;
&quot; if you specify an audio file with the name of the audio source file , this will be integrated into the movie . after you have adjusted all the settings to your wishes , you can now start drinking a coffee with the button and enjoy the slideshow when you return back . &quot;
&quot; if an indication appears that Ko@@ di@@ erer or tools is missing , you can adjust the paths to the programs of the M@@ jp@@ eg@@ Tools and Image@@ Mag@@ ick Pack@@ ages through the button settings on the right . &quot;
the printing wizard allows you to print multiple images on a sheet of paper together in standard photo sizes . the combined pictures can also be automatically opened with the image processing g@@ im@@ p . this is for example : make sense to improve you or print it with the Gim@@ p module for direct expression .
&quot; with this K@@ IP@@ I module you can import and convert your images stored in RAW format in one of three formats , JPEG , TIFF , or P@@ PM formats . &quot;
&quot; the conversion is based on Dave Coff@@ in command line tool . an original quote from him is : do not expect dc@@ raw to produce the same results as the software from your camera manufacturer . sometimes , you get better results using dc@@ raw ! &quot;
first select the raw file you want to be converted and launch the module . the Raw Image Converter window appears in the mode for a single image . with the preview you can view the effect of your current settings on the picture .
&quot; you can now adjust the values to optimize the conversion process . the first option determines whether the camera settings should be used for the white balance . the main parameters such as g@@ amma , brightness and red / blue ampli@@ fiers can be adjusted . if the result is not optimal , you can edit the image later . &quot;
a four @-@ colour R@@ GB@@ G conversion can be selected so you can use the contrast information . if your camera operates in RGB mode the R@@ GB@@ G switch has no effect .
&quot; once you are satisfied with the preview , you can choose one of the three output formats and save the conversion result . the file name remains the same and only the extension will be adjusted accordingly . JPEG uses a los@@ s@@ less algorithm and produces the smallest file sizes . &quot;
&quot; the Tagged Image Format , TIFF , keeps all the information of your image and uses the los@@ s@@ less L@@ Z@@ W compression . &quot;
&quot; if you are planning to process your pictures frequently or later use it later , you should not select the JPEG format , since there is only a limited number of operations allowed before the image quality is deteri@@ or@@ ated . TIFF and P@@ PM are better adapted to keep the original data . &quot;
&quot; if you select JPEG as a storage format , the metadata contained in the RAW file are stored in the JPEG file in the Exif information . &quot;
&quot; if you have adapted your settings , you can start converting the conversion button . if you want to cancel this process again , you can use Cancel . &quot;
&quot; batch processing mode allows you to convert different images at once . therefore , use this mode if you are sure , e.g. by testing on a single image , which are the best settings . &quot;
&quot; the available settings are almost identical to the version for individual pictures . however , you have the possibility to automatically over@@ write an existing file . a preview is not available . the progress bar shows how far the conversion is advanced . &quot;
this module can be used to comp@@ ress all images in an album . it uses the program convert from the Image@@ Mag@@ ick package . the following image formats are supported :
&quot; this module can be used to ren@@ ame all images of an album . you can set the pre@@ fix , start number and tim@@ est@@ amp of the album . &quot;
this module can be used to change the size of multiple images of a picture collection . it uses the convert program from the Image@@ Mag@@ ick package . you can reduce or enlarge the image . in addition four types of picture change are provided :
proportional ( 1 Dim . ) : normal size change in a dimension . the width or height of the image is selected automatically depending on the image orientation . the aspect ratio remains unchanged .
proportional ( 2 Dim . ) : size change in two dimensions . here the aspect ratio remains unchanged . you can use this option e.g. to adjust your picture to the screen format .
non proportional : proportional scale change in two dimensions . the aspect ratio is changed with this option .
&quot; pre @-@ print preparation : prepar@@ es the image for photo printing . the user can adjust the print resolution and the size of the photo paper . the target image , including background size , edge size and background color , is adapted accordingly . &quot;
with this K@@ IP@@ I module you can send selected images with your preferred email program .
&quot; once you have started the module , the image window will be displayed with the selected images . you can add additional images via the button . for the last selected picture , a preview will be displayed on the right . &quot;
you can also drag and drop images to the picture list to add the list of images to be sent .
with the button pictures remove the selected images from the list of images to be sent .
after you have selected all the images you can open the new message window of your e @-@ mail client with the OK button . you only have to add the addresses and the subject .
make sure not to send too many images at once . most e @-@ mail accounts have limitations for the size of e @-@ mails to send . it may be a good idea to send several mails if you want to send many pictures .
the e @-@ mail window is used to change settings for sending the images . your configuration is saved and used every time until you change it .
&quot; select your email client from the menu . if you select Thunder@@ bird , you must specify the right path for your installation in the input field below . &quot;
&quot; if you use the Google Mail Service , you must install the G@@ mail Agent on your computer beforehand . you can download it here . &quot;
&quot; after selecting comments in an attached file , the comments to the images are added to a text file and the mail is attached . &quot;
&quot; the PNG format from the File format menu is not very suitable to reduce the size of photo files , but it is best adapted to the loss @-@ free formats such as TIFF . you should therefore use PNG if you have a fast internet connection and the photo quality should not be changed . otherwise , we recommend the JPEG format . &quot;
&quot; if you select JPEG in images file format and are the original files in JPEG format , then the original ex@@ i@@ fer data will be added to the sending images . &quot;
&quot; if the process is done , the window will not automatically shut down so you can view the status messages , in search of errors . &quot;
&quot; after starting the module Advanced Di@@ asch@@ au , a window will appear with questions like you want to display your slide show . you can choose between the selected and all images of the album . &quot;
&quot; the Open@@ GL option in the presentation uses very elegant image transi@@ tions using Open@@ GL . however , you have to have a corresponding graph card , otherwise the slideshow will be very slow . &quot;
the file name option indicates that the filename of the images in the lower left corner will be displayed during the presentation .
the loop option ensures that the presentation is displayed in a loop loop . you can then manually cancel with Es@@ c ; Cancel .
the pictures random@@ ly select that the images are displayed in random order . so it is not used the order of the pictures in the album .
the best distance depends on your computer and the chosen transition effect . the best distance depends on your computer and the chosen transition effect .
there are more than a dozen transition effects between which you can select . random sel@@ ects a different effect for each transition between images .
&quot; during the slide show , you can access a toolbar at the top left of the screen . move the mouse into this corner to turn you on . &quot;
&quot; with this toolbar , you can stop the presentation and restart , jump to the previous and next picture and stop the slideshow . &quot;
&quot; on the left lower edge of the screen , you can see the current file name , the position of the current image and the total number of images in your presentation . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I module time &amp; date currently does not have any documentation . if you are interested in writing this please contact the mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I team at k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de.@@ or@@ g. Attention : the participants of this list speak English .
the K@@ IP@@ I module background image is a tool to set an image as a wallpaper for the desktop .
&quot; this module uses the currently selected image , depending on the selected option of the sub@@ menu , as background for your K@@ DE desktop interface . &quot;
&quot; as soon as you have provided your pictures and videos with comments , you can share with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; by these brow@@ ses , see picture . as you can see through a comparison with the image , are now available in each group , so in people , places and in group keywords entries . &quot;
in the browser window you can see the categories you entered when you have entered your images and videos with ann@@ ot@@ ations . in addition there are entries to look for EX@@ IF @-@ based information to view the folder structure on your hard disk and of course viewing the current thumb@@ nails .
&quot; if you press the mouse over the entry , the view of the browser changes . see picture . &quot;
&quot; if you select another person , only the images are displayed on which both persons are to be seen . by this selection method , you can limit the number of images displayed from a few thousand images to a few images . &quot;
&quot; if you have selected all persons , places and other settings , you can view thumb@@ nails to view the images of your activity . &quot;
&quot; in the picture , each person has the same symbol in front of their name . you can save with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; however , for each person you can save a preview image , this also applies to places , keywords and other categories you have defined yourself . see the picture . &quot;
&quot; in order to display images next to the name , select the button located on the right side of the toolbar . &quot;
&quot; you have to define the image for each individual . in order to do this , you will need to open the picture image window ( in closer detail ) and select the image for the appropriate person . in the view window you can customize the magni@@ fication factor according to your wishes and select which part of the image will be displayed or cut off . &quot;
&quot; when you access the search in the main window , a dialog will be displayed that is very similar to the dialog for setting the image properties . this dialog allows you to view this dialog again . &quot;
&quot; if you enter a string in the inscription or description , the inscription and descriptions of the images are searched for this text . if you would like , you can also enter a date , i.e. , for example 1971 , or the complete date . you can also use a section of two data , such as 1971 @-@ 1980 . &quot;
&quot; with the options in the lower part of the window , you can browse all images according to certain names , as you can see in the picture . here , after pictures on which Jes@@ per , but not Anne Hel@@ ene are depicted . &quot;
&quot; this is the user manual for &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; . if you don &apos;t like to read manuals , but rather try to try new features , you have the following alternatives to this manual : &quot;
&quot; go to the homepage of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album , and take a look at the quick entry , the screen@@ shots and the introduc@@ tory videos . &quot;
&quot; start &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; and in the first dialog , select the demo , if you start &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; for the first time , or select the menu entry k@@ photo@@ album ; demo . then some sample images will be loaded and you can try the functions of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; try it out . &quot;
&quot; if you prefer to print this manual , you will find it on the homepage of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; as a coher@@ ent HTML document to download . &quot;
&quot; at the bottom of the main window of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; see the tim@@ eline . a picture of this bar can be seen here : . as the name suggests , this bar shows you date statistics about the images in your database . &quot;
&quot; the tim@@ eline can display several different time units . each bar then displays another unit . you can switch between the units years , months , weeks , hours and 10 minutes . on the picture you can see a part of a database by indicating only 10 @-@ minute sections . &quot;
&quot; the tim@@ eline can be used inter@@ actively in the following ways : you can preview the displayed entries from the database ( if you select a date , the first image of this date will be displayed in the preview window ) and the tim@@ eline displays the current date of the currently displayed images when you navigate in the Preview view . &quot;
&quot; you can also select a section of the tim@@ eline by holding the mouse button down and drag the mouse over the ruler of the tim@@ eline , i.e. the time data . you can cancel the selection by clicking on a bar of the tim@@ eline . &quot;
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; introduces you two ways to create HTML web pages with your pictures . the one is integrated in &amp; photo@@ album ; integrated and the other available as module ( see ) .
&quot; before creating HTML pages , you need to make some settings . these are divided into the three areas content , layout and destination . in the following , each area is described more precisely . &quot;
first enter the title of the article and a description that the HTML file should contain later . on k@@ photo@@ album ; HTML example pages you can see an example of these settings .
&quot; next , select if a &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; -@@ export file is to be created to see the view page . more information about export files can be found in . &quot;
&quot; finally , you can select which information is to be displayed on the HTML pages . this allows you to avoid information displayed on the viewer without description . for example , that all pictures from a party are exported . you can therefore not use this setting to hide specific images from certain viewers . &quot;
&quot; in this section , you can specify how the HTML pages should look like . most settings are unique , which is why it is not specifically addressed . &quot;
&quot; at the bottom of the page you can set different resolutions for the images . therefore , those who are viewing your website and have a monitor that supports the maximum resolution 800@@ x@@ 600 , no longer download images that have a resolution of 1600@@ x@@ 1200 . &quot;
&quot; the viewers of your site may change the resolution at any time you have specified . so he can search your images with low resolution , which leads to a lower transmission time . if he wants to get an image bigger , he changes to higher resolution . &quot;
&quot; in this setting , place the different folders and the URL where your website is stored . &quot;
&quot; best , select a root folder for all your HTML files and a new sub@@ folder for each subsequent set . &quot;
&quot; first you need to select the root folder where all your pictures are stored . this folder is saved and automatically added to the next time . here you can either select a folder , or a protocol supported by K@@ DE , for example : &quot;
&quot; after you have created your pictures , you can check if these really are all visible to the viewer . if you select a URL for the base folder , a web browser , after the pages are created , should be this folder . otherwise , the web browser will start in the wrong folder . &quot;
&quot; this is not the sub@@ folder of the current files , but the base folder in which all sub@@ folders are located . &quot;
&quot; the currently described settings have all three related to base folders or URLs . in these , a sub@@ folder is created , whose name you specify in output folders . &quot;
&quot; if you are on a family celebration , a meeting in the company , a conference or somewhere else , with other users of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; you may of course create an HTML page for viewing images . &quot;
with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; you can export a copy of your images into a .@@ k@@ im file . you can import others to your database . the image properties are exported with ex@@ - and imported .
&quot; there are two different types of .@@ k@@ im files , internal and external . &quot;
&quot; you can create a .@@ k@@ im file either directly from the File Export ... or along with HTML pages , see , create . if you create a .@@ k@@ im file together with an HTML file , this will be an external .@@ k@@ im file . &quot;
&quot; an external .@@ k@@ im file searches the images in two ways . first , it searches the images that are in the file of the .@@ k@@ im file . this is of course only possible if you created your .@@ k@@ im file using the HTML export . &quot;
&quot; in the following , the dialog for ex@@ porting images is described , which you can access via the File Export menu ... &quot;
the most important option of this dialog is whether it should be internal or external .@@ k@@ im files . the following three choices are available :
&quot; with the manual option to copy the .@@ k@@ im file , you need to copy the images to the same folder as the .@@ k@@ im file . &quot;
with the option Automatic to copy the .@@ k@@ im file copy &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the images automatically for you .
.@@ k@@ im files are normal Zip files . as most of the pictures have been compressed with JPEG and the XML file itself is very small it is usually not worthwhile to comp@@ ress the files .
&quot; the last option of this page is to limit the maximum image size . if you want to send images to your friends , you might not want to send images in full size as the .@@ k@@ im file would otherwise be very big . here you can limit the size by saying that each image should be maximum 800 pixels high and wide . &quot;
&quot; if you select a file with the extension .@@ k@@ im from the web browser or from the File Import ... select , will &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the exported database as described in described . &quot;
&quot; the wizard for im@@ porting is made up of four steps . first , you need to select which images you want to import , then , in which folder the import images are to be copied . &quot;
&quot; it may be that you person@@ alize the category persons of the file to be imported ( if you are a domain ) while this category is named in your database . therefore , you are asked in the third dialog box which categories of the imported file are to be imported and which categories they match in your database . &quot;
&quot; in the fourth step , you can compare the categories of the file to be imported with the categories of your current database . an example of this can be seen in the picture . &quot;
&quot; it must be easy to browse images and view : when you see images , you often want to jump inside of different picture groups . if you look for example pictures of your Italy vacation and discover an image with your friend , you might want to see all the pictures on which this friend shows . &quot;
&quot; in this manual , you will find the different steps from ( 1 ) capture of information about your images , via ( 2 ) browsing and watching , up to ( 3 ) advanced subjects and custom@@ ization options . &quot;
&quot; K@@ Photo@@ Album has been started as a program to manage your pictures . however , it has been extended and today it takes care of your videos . at many places in this manual is talked about pictures , but often this includes videos with one . &quot;
&quot; it is a simple XML file that lets you copy with a program of your choice , e.g. Nor@@ mal backup tools , copy to a flo@@ ppy or re@@ visions in CVS , where they want . &quot;
&amp; photo@@ album ; notice the folder where your images are stored and use it automatically for future starts . if you want to read another folder in &amp; photo@@ album ; use the -@@ c option . for example : k@@ photo@@ album -@@ c ~ / company / images / index@@ .@@ x@@ ml .
in the following section of the user manual you will find the different settings options .
&quot; to the left you can see six different symbols , which allows you to preview and view options for the viewer . for each setting , a detailed help is available which you can call through a button press to the F1 key and click on the desired option . &quot;
&quot; you can also create your own groups such as objects , animals or albums . &quot;
&quot; see the dialog which is used to edit existing groups . for each group , you can select a cap@@ tion and a symbol . &quot;
&quot; sub@@ categories have already been mentioned in the section . in the dialog options , you can set up complete member groups , i.e. all members of a group at once in a group , rather than explaining all groups of a member . &quot;
in the left half of the window you can select the category you want to configure . in the left half of the window you will find a list of the current category and in the right a list of sub@@ categories .
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; shares its modular system with other graphic applications such as digi@@ K@@ am and G@@ wen@@ view . this module system is called K@@ IP@@ I and means &amp; k@@ de ; image plugin interface . more information on this can be found on the homepage of Ki@@ pi .
&quot; the modules can be called via the menu modules . the modules can not be described in this manual because they are not part of &amp; photo@@ album ; however , most modules have a help page that you can call through the modules themselves . &quot;
&quot; since the modules of multiple applications are shared among each other , it may be that the modules with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; only very little have been tested . therefore , you should always test new modules with the demo database before using them using the command &gt; k@@ photo@@ album demo &lt; user@@ input \ &gt; or via the Help menu . do not tell me , I would not have warned you ! &quot;
&quot; the applications that use the modules via K@@ IP@@ I are very different , making it possible that some modules with &amp; photo@@ album ; do not work . this is the dis@@ advantage if you share functions with different applications . &quot;
&quot; the biggest difference between &amp; photo@@ album ; and other applications that also use K@@ IP@@ I , is that the other applications are using their pictures in albums . even though &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; this kind of order isn &apos;t supported , it simul@@ ates the order by albums , so you can use the functions with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album . &quot;
&quot; this simul@@ ates &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the current album that simply corresponds to the current view , so all the images that show you the picture show at the moment . &quot;
&quot; next to the current album , &amp; photo@@ album has to be delivered ; the modules also have a list of albums . here &apos;s &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; as follows : &quot;
&quot; if &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; s browser displays the content of a category , for example , all persons , then each entry of this category represents an album for the module . &quot;
&quot; or it will be the category you have set in the Settings dialog as category for virtual albums . so , for example , use the category people , will do &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; so , so whether you have selected persons to view and pass on to the module . &quot;
&quot; since some modules with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album are not compatible , you can remove them from the list of modules . &quot;
on the picture you can see an example of a start screen as soon as you start &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; start with your own pictures .
&quot; as you are used by any other K@@ DE application , you can see the window with which you can browse your image database . currently , it does not contain a lot of information as you do not have any information about your images . &quot;
&quot; one of the main functions of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; is the possibility to have any picture with ann@@ ot@@ ations . this includes information about the persons shown on the picture , where the image has been taken . &quot;
&quot; all these comments can be used for searching and browsing , as you can read in the section . if you want , you can see these notes if you use the built @-@ in viewer . &quot;
&quot; these are a very important part of &amp; photo@@ album ; as you will always use them again , when you enter information about your pictures . &quot;
&quot; the following idea is to reloc@@ ate images within the list : for example , if you have a family celebration and shown on all 50 pictures the same 5 @-@ 10 people , you can , so that the names used are moved upwards to find and arrange people faster . &quot;
&quot; if you prefer to get an alphabetical list of sorted list , click on the sorting icon by date under the list . &quot;
&quot; if you have selected ann@@ ot@@ ations for each image individually , you may want to edit all selected images and add these images with notes . in this case simply click on the above and back buttons , which are located under the thumb@@ nail of the picture on the right . &quot;
&quot; if you have several images , e.g. with the same person , then it can be more convenient to mark all these images and add the menu item multiple entries at once with a note . &quot;
&quot; Las Vegas , San Francisco , Los Angeles and California are all located in the USA . in addition , San Francisco and Los Angeles are located in California . &quot;
&quot; on the picture you can see a browser window that shows the USA as an over@@ board . to show you that it is an over@@ board , a special symbol is displayed . &quot;
&quot; in the context menu of the comment list , it is possible to add an entry to an existing or new over@@ - or sub@@ category . in addition , you can also simply drag an entry to a category and place there in order to sort this item in alphabetical order . &quot;
&quot; you can move the individual elements of the comment list by clicking and moving the bar , which form the upper edge of the frame , click and move it . you can also make your own window from a frame by drag@@ ging it outside the window area . &quot;
&quot; if you have adapted the look of the window so to your requirements that you are satisfied with the settings , click on the Options ... which offers you among other things the possibility to store the current structure and look of the window . &quot;
&quot; you can also hide a frame completely . if you want to view this window later , use the button Options ... and then window a window . this process can be seen in the picture . &quot;
&quot; you can view the size of thumb@@ nails , by simply clicking drag@@ ging the mouse with the middle mouse button , configure . try it . &quot;
&quot; if you drop a picture on the background of your desktop , this image is set up as a wallpaper for your desktop . &quot;
&quot; once you click on a picture , this will appear in the picture viewer . if you have not yet opened a window with a picture viewer , a new display window will be created . &quot;
&quot; you can also delete images in the preview preview . simply select the appropriate images from which you want to delete , and press either the delete button or select the Edit menu . now , the window will appear you can see in the picture . &quot;
&quot; for this problem , you can use &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; you can also use images without having saved on your hard drive . of course , you need to record the pictures somewhere , so that &amp; k@@ photo@@ album . in the picture you can see the view of &amp; photo@@ album ; if not all the required images can be downloaded from the hard drive . &quot;
&quot; images in which the right upper corner is cut off are not saved on the hard drive . however , for pictures 5 @-@ 9 , however , the thumb@@ nails are present , so &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; you can also view these images with the image viewer . &quot;
&quot; as you can see , this function requires that you want to copy files from folders and copy it back . so , if you want to avoid anno@@ ying on your pictures , please buy a larger hard disk to save all pictures . &quot;
&quot; in the menu picture you will find a sub@@ menu with the name of privacy . if you want to have a little more privacy , filter the images so that at the end you can open all the images that you may see for others and click on the menu entry Any@@ thing except current view lock . &quot;
&quot; so you have specified which images should be hidden in the case of the case . if you want to lock the laptop now your little sister , simply select the menu entry images to be hidden . if you want to get the pictures displayed again , click on lock . &quot;
&quot; it is also possible to specify a password that must be entered for blocking the images . to set up this password , simply select password in the privacy menu . &quot;
&quot; please bear in mind that this picture protection is by no means very secure . on the one hand , everyone can access index@@ .@@ x@@ ml file , read or delete the password as un@@ encrypted text . this type of password protection is only for those who are familiar with &amp; photo@@ album ; not very familiar with respect to private images . &quot;
&quot; the reason you all your pictures with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; manage and spend hours over hours to describe it is natural that you want to look at them some@@ time . for this reason , it has a picture _ and video viewer . you can preview it from the preview as described in . &quot;
&quot; you can see the viewer in the picture . of course he shows the picture , but additional information you have to enter through the picture , such as who is on the picture , when and where was it done , etc . &quot;
&quot; if the Info@@ box on the upper part of the picture you want to see , you can simply drag and drop it . you can also configure which information is displayed and whether information is displayed . all of these options are available after a right click on the viewer . &quot;
&quot; a few words in the Info@@ box are under@@ lined . if you click here , the browser , see the matching entries to this display . so if you click on Anne Hel@@ ene , the browser shows you all the images of Anne Hel@@ ene . as if you have selected persons from the browser and then Anne Hel@@ ene . &quot;
&quot; if you have uploaded several images in the viewer , you can switch between them before and back by using the keys image high and image . you can jump to the first and last picture with Pos@@ 1 and end . these functions can also be reached from the context menu . &quot;
&quot; if multiple images are loaded in the viewer , you can run it as slideshow . how often a new image can be checked by pressing the Ctr@@ l key and Plus or minus . &quot;
&quot; in this mode , the viewer uses the entire place on the screen . simply use the entry button to switch to full@@ screen mode and back . &quot;
&quot; when you use the viewer , you can enter into the picture and zoom out . with the mouse button you can zoom out the Plus button in the middle of the picture . shows how a zoom rect@@ angle is selected and shows the result of the zoom . &quot;
&quot; with the dot button , you can reset your zoom , so that the image is not zo@@ omed . with the unit key sets the zo@@ oms , so that each pixel corresponds to a pixel of the image . &quot;
&quot; note that the only zoom operations that work with videos , that come in and out with the plus and minus key . &quot;
&quot; with the scrip@@ ting functions from the context menu , you can rotate the image . this does not work with videos . you can make notes to the current picture with the menu item notes from the context menu . &quot;
&quot; when you look at images it can happen that you &apos;ll find a picture with a person whose name you have forgotten on the picture . at the moment you can view it and open configuration dialog of the image to enter that name . however , you may prefer to select the image and view more pictures . &quot;
&quot; another situation is that you want to send a number of images to a printer to get the pictures on paper . to see what photos you want , you can start the viewer with the pictures and select them as good or bad as you look one after another . &quot;
&quot; for the two examples above , the viewer gives you the possibility to view images with characteristics while watching them . characteristics are the letters A to Z and you can make a characteristic by pressing the corresponding letters . in see a picture where the features A , B and C are set . &quot;
&quot; as soon as you have placed the features on your pictures , these are available in your browser . so if you have all the images you edit , print or whatever you &apos;ve selected , you simply have to use a module to copy the selected images to a CD or whatever you want to do . &quot;
&quot; categories and special features can be displayed in the preview view . if you can view categories in the preview view , then you can add features to the pictures by simply pressing the letter for the characteristic after selecting the picture . this can be seen here : &quot;
&quot; sometimes it is not clear what you want to show on a picture . in this case , you will allow &amp; k@@ photo@@ album to paint on the image . &quot;
&quot; the mixture is not stored with the image , but in the database . &quot;
in order to finish the painting from the context menu . to finish the painting simply press the cross in the toolbar at the top of the window .
&quot; to be able to work with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; you must not fully control the application of the program &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray , but the documentation on &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; should you be read and understood . &quot;
&quot; in the object tree , you can select individual objects . then their properties are displayed in the object properties , and the object in the wire mod@@ ell@@ - views are displayed yellow . &quot;
&quot; you can also select multiple objects at the same time . but not the object of an already selected object , since all objects are already selected with the object . &quot;
&quot; to insert a new object into the object tree , select the location where you want to insert the object and click the icon in the toolbar or select a menu entry in the menu . &quot;
&quot; there are several possible positions , the following drop @-@ down menu is displayed , so that you can choose the right position : &quot;
&quot; with del@@ eting either from the menu bar under Edit or from the context menu of the right mouse button , you can remove selected objects from the scene . &quot;
&quot; if you have modified properties , click App@@ ly to take these changes . if you have entered invalid values , a message will be displayed with an error description . then you can correct the input eh@@ ler and click App@@ ly again , or disc@@ ard the changes with Cancel . &quot;
&quot; if you enter the path to &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; -@@ user documentation in the Setup dialog , you can call the &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; reference to the displayed object with help . &quot;
&quot; you need the &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g or 3.5 H@@ M@@ TL user documentation to use this feature . if this documentation is not included in your distribution , you can download it here . &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; 3.5 already contains the user documentation . &quot;
&quot; if you edit a texture or part of a texture , you can see a preview in your own view . &quot;
&quot; click Preview in the Properties View and a small example of the scene is rendered with the selected texture . as default , the entire texture is rendered , even if you want to render a sub@@ divided item ( for example , a texture within a texture map and not the entire texture map ) , check locally . &quot;
the screen shot shows the control points of the camera . you can move these control points with the mouse button and thereby change the position and direction of the camera .
&quot; when a transformation is chosen , the control points disappear and there will be a small cross in the wire model view . this cross marks the center for sc@@ aling and rotation as well as the position for shifts . you can change the shift by drag@@ ging with the mouse inside the entire window . &quot;
each object has a visual level as a wire model . you can specify this value relative to the level of visibility of the superior object or as absolute value . objects are displayed only when they are selected or their visibility stage is smaller or equal to the visual stage of the scene selected in the toolbar .
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; has a window arrangement as default . the object tree and the view of the object properties are displayed on the left and the four graphical views on the right .
&quot; if you do not like the default window arrangement or if you need a different arrangement , you can set it as desired . you can also store multiple window arrangements and simply switch between different arrangements . &quot;
&quot; to anchor a window above or under an existing view , drag the connection water to the top or bottom of a view . a rect@@ angle then shows the new position . &quot;
&quot; to create a new column , drag the b@@ ypass to the right or left side of a view . the new view is then anch@@ ored to the right or left side of this view and extends across the entire height . &quot;
&quot; if you want to arrange several views over each other , drag the b@@ ypass in the middle of another view . you can then switch between the views by clicking on the card driver at the top of the views . &quot;
&quot; the last possible window arrangement are suspended views : views that are not anch@@ ored in the main window . in order to solve a view from the anch@@ oring , drag the start water to the desktop or click on the small left pointing arrow in the list bar . &quot;
&quot; to close a view , click on the small cross in the list bar . to prevent the closing , click on the small square between the arrow and the cross . &quot;
&quot; you can insert additional views into the main window . in the View menu you will find entries for any type of views . new views are floating , you can anchor them at any location . &quot;
the current window view can be saved with the View Window System ... saving . it will display a dialog where you can save the window arrangement under an existing or new name .
&quot; if you have created a scene , you can ren@@ ew it . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; used &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g for rendering , this program has to be properly installed . as this manual was written , this version is not supported in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; version 1.0 is not supported . &quot;
&quot; to render the current scene , click on the rendering symbol Ren@@ ders in the toolbar or select the scene in view scene . &quot;
&quot; a render mode corresponds to the entries in &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; s ini files . it determines the image size and the quality of rendering . if you want to render a scene in different image sizes and quality levels , you can paste as many render modes , from a quick preview to full images of the highest quality . &quot;
if you click on the render settings icon in the toolbar or select R@@ ender Mo@@ di ... the following dialog will be opened :
&quot; each render mode has a name . you can input any name , but it makes sense to see a name that can be recognized by the characteristics of the mode . &quot;
&quot; in the map size you can enter the width and height of the illustrated picture . if you want to ren@@ ew only a small area of the image , select the section sub@@ section and enter the image section for rendering into the input fields . &quot;
&quot; in combination field quality you can select the properties , the &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; used for rendering . this goes from a very simple color and light model to a model with complex diff@@ user re@@ lexi@@ ons lighting . a detailed description of the render properties can be found in the user &apos;s guide to &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; . &quot;
&quot; if a picture is rendered with only one ray per pixel , various errors can occur . these pictures often have a Mo@@ ir@@ è pattern or step effects in curves and lines , and sometimes details are not displayed if they are smaller than a pixel . this effect is ali@@ asing . &quot;
&amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; uses a technique called anti @-@ ali@@ asing to l@@ essen the influence of these errors . in general pictures with this feature are better .
&quot; if you switch off anti @-@ ali@@ asing , calcul@@ ates and connects &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; more than one beam per pixel . this technique is super @-@ sampling . &quot;
&amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; supports two methods of super @-@ sampling . as standard is an adap@@ tive non @-@ recur@@ sive method ; adap@@ tive because the super @-@ sampling the neighboring pixels with included . the second method is adap@@ tive @-@ recur@@ sive ; recur@@ sively because each pixel is always separated again and adap@@ tively because the rec@@ ur@@ sion depth depends on the calculated color values .
&quot; when you choose the first method , POV @-@ Ray tracks a ray per pixel . if you adjust the depth value to 4 , a grid of 4x4 additional points will be calculated , with a depth value of 5 then 5x@@ 5 ( 25 ) additional rays per pixel . &quot;
&quot; the difference between two pixels is calculated as follows : R 1 , g 1 and b 1 are the values for red , green and blue of the first pixel , r 2 , g 2 and b 2 are the values for red , green and blue of the second pixel . the difference is then : &quot;
di@@ ff = abs ( r 1 -@@ r 2 ) + abs ( g 1 -@@ g 2 ) + abs ( b 1 -@@ b 2 )
&quot; the recur@@ sive method starts with 4 rays each pixel . if the difference between the color values exceeds the given threshold , the pixel is divided into 4 sub@@ pixel , which are individually followed and checked for further sub@@ division . the maximum depth of recur@@ sion can be set with the depth value . &quot;
&quot; another way to reduce ali@@ asing effect is to generate noise for the ray process , called j@@ itter@@ ing . if you switch J@@ itter@@ ing , changed &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; the rays around a tiny amount to avoid regular patterns . &quot;
the last setting for quality of rendering is diff@@ use reflection . this is an experimental feature of &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; the diff@@ use light reflex@@ ion is calculated . it takes very long to calculate a scene with this property .
on this card you can adjust if the alpha channels are to be calculated by POV @-@ Ray . a pixel is then transparent if the associated rays have no object .
&quot; opens a new window for displaying the &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; console output . if &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; un@@ expect@@ edly terminated , you can find the reason for it here . &quot;
&quot; to import a &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; scene file , select Import File Import ... and select a file in the dialog window . &quot;
&quot; currently supports &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; not yet the full command circum@@ ference of &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; . if error messages or war@@ nings occur when im@@ porting error messages or war@@ nings , a dialog window displays a list of all messages . &quot;
if you do not support source code in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; import this source code between the two special comments / / * PM@@ Ra@@ w@@ Beg@@ in and / / * PM@@ Ra@@ w@@ End .
&quot; you can drag objects from object tree to the editor to export the source text for &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; to import objects to the scene , simply select the source code in the editor and drag it into the object tree . &quot;
copy and paste in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; and in your editor you can add source text for &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; also .
the POV @-@ Ray command is called when &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; a scene ren@@ ders . usually this is po@@ v@@ ray or x @-@ po@@ v@@ ray .
&quot; click here the path to your retention and version . support versions 3.@@ 1@@ g and 3.5 . &quot;
&amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; searches for external files ( for example al@@ field data ) in the paths to the &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; libraries .
the color for the wire models . the second color is used for displaying selected objects .
the color for the control points . the second color is used for displaying selected control points .
the color of the rect@@ angle for the view field in the camera view and in the window type labels .
&quot; you can set the object @-@ range of points to the grid in the context menu of the wire model views . here , you can set the grid separately for shifts , sc@@ aling and rotation . &quot;
&quot; larger values result in more accurate wire model and therefore better approxim@@ ation for the displayed objects , but require more time for rendering . for some objects such as the ball you can set the detail level for two directions separately . &quot;
&quot; when you cross high detail fi@@ del@@ ity for extended proj@@ ections , all wire model views are further divided , if the camera uses an extended projection . enhanced proj@@ ections are all proj@@ ections with exceptions from perspective and vertical proj@@ ections . this property gives a better approach for proj@@ ections , but requires more time to ren@@ ew . &quot;
&quot; when you cross a wall , a wall is rendered behind the objects . the wall is represented in a box pattern made of two adjustable colors . &quot;
&quot; when you cross the floor , a bottom is rendered below the objects . the floor is represented in a chess board pattern made of two adjustable colors . &quot;
&quot; if you activate edge smoothing , the non @-@ recur@@ sive anti @-@ ali@@ asing method is used for rendering the scenes . you can set the values for depth and threshold value . more detailed information about the parameters can be found in the R@@ ender @-@ Mo@@ di section . &quot;
&quot; on this page you can change existing window frames or create new window arrangements . in the window arrangement , you will explain how you can create and store window orders . &quot;
the standard window arrangement : displays all existing window arrangements . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; uses the selected window arrangement when starting the program .
the list of existing window arrangements displays all existing window arrangements . a new arrangement allows you to create with the Add button and delete a selected arrangement with the button Rem@@ ove .
every window arrangement is identified by the name . the name must be clear and must not be empty .
the list below shows all views for the selected window arrangement . new views can be created with the Add button and delete selected views with the button Rem@@ ove .
&quot; with New column you create a new column on the right side of the existing window , with Un@@ ten anchor the window under the existing window , with card card you get a map view together with the previous view and floating the view not in the main window , but creates a separate window . &quot;
&quot; so you just have &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; and &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; installed and now you want to begin without more precise knowledge of the two programs . if you follow all steps in this guide , you should create the ultimate but simple scene , among beginners very popular : a sphere at a level . &quot;
&quot; but you should consider the following war@@ nings carefully before compl@@ aining that you only receive a black screen as a result . if you use a 3D program for the first time , you should consider these important rules : &quot;
&quot; if you do not set a camera , no rules can be applied to rendering , as a result you get a black image . &quot;
&quot; if you do not include light sources , your whole scene is in the dark and you just get a black image . &quot;
&quot; if you have installed everything flaw@@ lessly , you will see at the first start of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; the following pres@@ et window arrangement : &quot;
&quot; take a little time to get to know the menus and the existing symbols of the toolbar . please read the documentation , so that you can get an appropriate idea of what you can expect from this program . &quot;
&quot; you will need to use these menus and symbols now , so you should remember the menus and symbols and their application . &quot;
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; starts with a simple scene . to follow this guide you must first remove all objects from the object tree . then select the scene and then select the Edit menu entry .
the view of the scene from the perspective of the camera . this shows you the result of the rendering of the scene .
&quot; the object tree now contains a new entry with the name camera . if you click on it , see the contents of the object properties in which the different parameters of the camera can be found . in the user documentation to &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray , please refer to further details . &quot;
&quot; do not change the basic settings of the camera , this is reserved later instructions , but note that the camera in view points to change the target point of the camera . just click on a control point with the left mouse button and drag it to the desired location . &quot;
&quot; if you press the user button or press Enter , the wire model views and the object tree immediately change according to these settings . as a result , they see the scene from the perspective of the camera . &quot;
&quot; there are many ways to create the ground for the scene . for example , you could insert a header ( inser@@ ting final bodies header ) and the size to x = 100 , y = 0 and z = 100 , but that is a complicated method to solve this task . &quot;
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; actually provides a simpler way . you can use an infinite plane as a floor :
&quot; a good advice : select the layer in the object tree , change the name and then press the user button or Enter . in the object tree the new name will be displayed immediately . &quot;
&quot; the wire model view now displays the level , even at the moment only as a limited fin@@ ite level . if you render the scene , the plane extends to the horizon . &quot;
&quot; in this case , you will see the different parameters of the object . in this case you will see only the standard options for each new object : sc@@ aling , rotation and displacement . select one of these options , change the possible settings in view of object properties . &quot;
&quot; in this scene you should move the floor to exercise a unit under the horizontal line , only to get to know some of these parameters . select shifting and adjust the values as follows : &quot;
&quot; first select the floor to adjust its material properties . there are many different materials , but choose something simple at the moment . &quot;
&quot; in both cases , a dialog where you can select how the object should be inserted . the pigment will then be displayed in the object tree . you can preview the name in the property view ( name = bottom pigment ) , with a click on the button preview you see how the pigment looks now . &quot;
&quot; of course , the preview of the pigment will show only a matte black material because you have to re @-@ examine settings for the pigment at any time by clicking thumb@@ nail . &quot;
&quot; if you don &apos;t see any color on Qu@@ ader and ball in preview , click App@@ ly on the App@@ ly button and then call the preview . &quot;
&quot; the material for the floor is now set correctly . if you render your picture now with a click on the symbol , you should get the following result : &quot;
&quot; in the color list you need to enter two new attributes . in the color list you need to enter two new attributes , called Uni@@ coloured . then edit this entry twice ( you can do this more frequently , but the chess board @-@ colorful list can only be used with two colors ) : &quot;
choose the object tree each time and change colors in view of object properties :
&quot; you should simply run this step , as you should have the basic working method of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; already understood . the ball is just as easy as the floor : &quot;
&quot; in view of the object properties , you can immediately change the settings . set the value for the radius : on 1 ( do not forget to press Enter or the App@@ ly button ) , so the ball would float above the floor as you have moved the floor to move down one unit down . &quot;
&quot; of course , the rendering now yields a strange result : as you can see before , the ball surface appears like a matte black material . put a suitable material in the following step . &quot;
&quot; if you have selected the ball , you can now assign a material to you . as already on the floor , enter the ball a pigment as a color : &quot;
&quot; first , select Sub@@ ject and change the name for example in Sphere Pig@@ ment . click the Pig@@ ment button , then select Uni@@ coloured and set the values as follows : &quot;
&quot; but you can achieve interesting effects , if you take the time to set some finish features : &quot;
then change the values as in the following screen@@ shots and click App@@ ly or press Enter .
&quot; the settings gloss @-@ effect and reflection are already partly good visual effects , perfect for glass or chrome @-@ plated surfaces , even if metal : not yet selected : &quot;
&quot; you should now have a good impression of what possibilities you have &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; it offers . hopefully , you &apos;ve learned so much that you can create simple but beautiful scenes . &quot;
Ray@@ trac@@ y@@ cing is a R@@ ender method to create a two @-@ dimensional image of a three @-@ dimensional scene or a model .
&quot; when you ra@@ y@@ trac@@ ing a scene , the ren@@ derer is shooting hyp@@ othe@@ tical rays from the viewer &apos;s perspective ( i.e. from the camera that ren@@ ders the scenes ) through each pixel in the scene and how atmospheric effects such as fog affect . so the scene pixels are processed for pixels . &quot;
&quot; as you can imagine , you will not see anything without a camera , the camera is your eye with which you look at the scene . without a light source you don &apos;t see anything , the picture is simply black . obviously every scene needs to be rendered , some light sources and at least one camera . &quot;
&quot; in the usual file dialog , you can select your file . Po@@ v@@ ray files usually have the file extension * .@@ po@@ v or * .@@ inc . &quot;
opens a file . in the default file dialog you can select a file you previously created with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ;
&quot; whenever you open or create a new model , the file will be inserted into this sub @-@ menu and replaces the oldest entry in the list . &quot;
&quot; if you have already saved the model , it will be stored under the same name . if it is a new file , you need to enter a name and space . &quot;
reco@@ vers the scene in the last saved version . all changes since the last saved storage are disc@@ ar@@ ded .
this menu entry can only be selected if you do not have saved changes in the scene .
repeat the last und@@ one @-@ made command . this menu entry can only be selected if you have used editing .
saves the current window arrangement and opens a dialog where you can enter a name for a new arrangement or over@@ write an existing order .
&quot; in this menu you will find options for setting &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; , here you can change the appearance , the short@@ cut and the default behavior . &quot;
opens a dialog to change keyboard short@@ cuts . you can use this option pres@@ et short@@ cuts for &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; change commands or add new ones .
opens a dialog to set up the toolbar . you can use this option tool@@ tip for &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; add and remove commands .
a b@@ ump map is a way to pret@@ end rough surfaces without having to model any diff@@ r@@ action on the surface separately and without changing the geometric shape of the object itself .
it is custom@@ ary to use the same file for both b@@ ump map as well as a texture map .
basic bodies are simple geometric shapes that you can use as modules : very complex 3D models are created from dozens or even hundreds of these base bodies . these models are then processed further to give them a more realistic appearance .
a texture map is a way to give the surface of an object color to pixel basis by using an image file as a color chart .
&amp; Cu@@ ick@@ show ; is a convenient picture viewer and browser . the application has a file browser in which you can select images to display .
images can be displayed either in a separate window in the size of the image or in full screen mode .
the use of &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; is very easy . the file browser lists files that you can click with Click &amp; L@@ MB@@ n ; or the Return button .
&quot; you can set whether each image should be displayed in your own window , or whether all pictures should always use the same window . &quot;
&quot; if you are looking for a specific file , just type the first sign of the filename in the browser window . if a matching filename is found , the file will be highlighted . you can leave the input field by pressing Return or &amp; Es@@ c . &quot;
&quot; in the dialog box - &amp; Cu@@ ick@@ show ; there are five cards . in three of them , General and editing and slideshow , you can set the mode of operation of &amp; Cu@@ ick@@ show ; in the two other , short@@ cuts for the display window and short@@ cuts for the browser , the short@@ cuts can be specified for each window . &quot;
&quot; if the image is not large enough to fill the screen , the rest of the display area is filled with the background color that can be set further down . default is not full screen mode . &quot;
&quot; this point is enabled , loads &amp; ski@@ p show ; already the next picture in the folder while you still watch the current picture . this reduces the delay if you choose the next picture , and is especially suitable for a slideshow . &quot;
this option saves &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; closing the name of the last opened folder . next start opens &amp; ski@@ p show ; this folder in the browser window .
&quot; click on the colored bars to select a background color . if in window mode the window is larger than the picture , the background is filled with the selected color . &quot;
&quot; you can &amp; ski@@ p show ; set up only some of the file types , which can display the program . &quot;
this option increases the display window to the full screen for large images . this option is turned on as default .
specify whether the slideshow should start with the first image in the folder or with the selected image .
&quot; to change the value , you can enter a new value in the input field or use the slider or the small arrows to the right next to the input field . the default is 3 seconds . &quot;
&quot; the number of re@@ peti@@ tions . if this value is set to 0 , the slide show will be repeated until it is canc@@ eled by the user . to change the value , you can enter a new value into the input field or use the small arrows to the right next to the input field . default is 1 . &quot;
change the short@@ cuts for different operating modes of &amp; Cu@@ ick@@ show ; in the cards short@@ cuts for the display window and short@@ cuts for the browser .
with this option switch between the two @-@ part view of the files@@ ystem ( a window for the sub@@ folders and a window for the files ) and the one @-@ piece view of the file system with folders and files in a window .
displays large icons for the files in the folder . this display is only possible in short presentation .
displays small icons for the files in the folder . this display is only possible in short presentation .
displays preview images for the files in the folder . this display is only possible in short presentation .
the image decreases by 10 % . the factor refers to the current size of the image .
enlarge the image by 10 % . the factor refers to the current size of the image .
closes the display window for the pictures . &amp; Cu@@ ick@@ show ; will also be closed if no browser window is open .
view the picture in original size . this is only useful if automatic sc@@ aling is enabled .
&quot; opens the input field for completion . enter the first characters of the file name you are looking for . if the file is found , it will be selected . &quot;
&amp; show@@ photo ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; photo editing based on the &amp; digi@@ came ; image processing . &amp; show@@ photo ; is part of the &amp; digi@@ kam ; project .
&amp; show@@ photo ; is a fast image processing with some powerful basic tools . you can use it to view your photos and perform correc@@ tions and changes .
&quot; like the rest of &amp; k@@ de ; is &amp; show@@ photo ; an open source project . this means it depends on the user contributes its part , at least problems and possible improvements . &quot;
&quot; this shows a dialog with a link . if you are also in the program , the menu contains an entry reports of problems or requests . if you are using it , your browser will open a page for reports of problems and wishes . all required information is already completed , and you can simply follow the instructions to send your message . &quot;
&amp; show@@ photo ; is a project that is supported by a community . that means that users and developers are helping each other .
&quot; the best start to participate in &amp; show@@ photo ; to participate , it is the developer mailing list to join . instructions for joining the developer mailing list of &amp; show@@ photo ; . &quot;
&quot; the settings dialog is divided into eight pages , and you can switch between them by pressing the icons of the left side . &quot;
&quot; in the area of exposure indicator , you can select the color that is displayed when the under@@ - or over@@ exposure indicator is selected . dex@@ ter@@ ity should display the colors with what you should display in contrast . sub exposure should display a bright color and over@@ exposure a dark color . &quot;
the main window of &amp; show@@ photo ; has a side@@ bar on the right edge that provides you with important information and actions to the selected images . you can also view them in which you click on one of the five riders :
&amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; is an application to scan images that no longer makes them scan and calibr@@ ate .
&amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; is a simple application to scan images that are no longer able to scan and store images .
you can check the status of your scanner &apos;s support on the SAN@@ E project page by entering the necessary information on this search page : http : / / www.s@@ ane @-@ proj@@ ect@@ .org / c@@ gi @-@ bin / dri@@ ver@@ .pl .
&quot; a standard scanner can be set on the command line of &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; using the command sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite -@@ d &#91; device name &#93; in the terminal . if this scanner cannot be opened or if no standard scanner is specified , a dialog for selecting the scanner will be opened . &quot;
the user can select the scanner to use and press OK to open the scanner . Cancel App@@ ly &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; Cancel .
the other settings contain more detailed options of the driver . &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; ( lib@@ ks@@ ane ) does not treat these options particularly .
&quot; to view a picture , the user can only start a preview and then scan the scanning area for the final scan . the preview can be started by the preview button . &quot;
&quot; to select the picture better , the user can zoom into the image and zoom out of the current selection . it can also adjust the zoom in so that the complete preview fits into the window . &quot;
if the image has been selected then the final image can be read using the scan button .
&quot; when saving a preview displayed in the settings , then the image will appear in a preview window , as shown below . when saving is pressed , then the image will be saved and Sch@@ lie ? s leads to a crash and you will return to the main window . &quot;
the Settings button opens the same name dialog before the main window . you can change the most important settings here .
&quot; the user can view the image if desired , before saving . in this case the option must be displayed before saving a preview . if this preview is not requested by the user , the option must be selected . &quot;
&quot; this setting allows you to select the type such as &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; save images . open dialog to save each image opens the dialog before any sc@@ anned image . if &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite , you need to save it automatically with a generated name in a previously defined folder , then you need to select Save without asking for a filename . &quot;
&quot; if the images are stored after each scan , then this folder is used as default for dialog for saving . the default value is your home directory and you can change this with the button ... &quot;
this parameter defines an image pre@@ fix for the automatically saved images and is furthermore the suggested name for the image in the dialog for saving . the automatically saved image gets a numerical suff@@ ix of each time being saved . the character string # # # is replaced by the numbers .
&quot; the user can adjust the image quality to save . this value also changes the compression value while saving . if select the image quality not selected , then the default value of Q@@ t is used . &quot;
the button Help starts the K@@ DE help with the &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; manual . the button Over starts the K@@ DE over dialog for &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; . the button Settings displays the dialog for the settings and closing can be used to finish &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite .
&amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; is licensed under the GPL and the lib@@ ks@@ ane library used by &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; used under L@@ GPL . caution : li@@ bs@@ ane is licensed under the GPL with an exception .
you can set up a list of this short@@ cut and function . you can set up a short@@ cut of short@@ cuts by clicking on the right mouse button in the player window and set the Global button short@@ cut by clicking the right mouse button in the player window and select short@@ cuts .
&quot; you can set up existing multimedia keys so that they act as &amp; Amar@@ ok , short commands . this makes your keyboard a &amp; Amar@@ ok ; control center . &quot;
&quot; the D@@ CO@@ P interface from Amar@@ ok has many general functions that can mostly be found in other K@@ DE programs . this section consists of six parts and is intended to describe the D@@ CO@@ P functions of collection , context browser , player , playlist , play@@ lists browser and scripts . &quot;
Amar@@ ok supports command line options from Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de ; . in addition Amar@@ ok has some own command line options .
&quot; you should give the user a feedback , if the script cannot be executed because of missing dependen@@ cy . please check in your script to see if all required modules are present and use k@@ dialog , so that the user knows why a script does not work . &quot;
begin require &apos; Kor@@ und@@ um &apos; rescue Lo@@ ad@@ Error Error = &apos; Kor@@ und@@ um ( K@@ DE bind@@ ings for ruby ) from k@@ deb@@ ind@@ ings V@@ 3.4 is required for this script . &apos; &apos; k@@ dialog --@@ sorry &apos; # { error } &apos; &apos; exit end
in the scripts / templates you will find a lot of template scripts in many different languages . you can use them as the basis for your own scripts or simply extend it to the required functions . you will quickly find that writing scripts is relatively simple .
&quot; using D@@ CO@@ P , your scripts can exchange data with Amar@@ ok and control Amar@@ ok . the easiest way is to use the d@@ co@@ p command , which should help each K@@ DE installation . &quot;
most scrip@@ ting languages allow exec@@ uting of external programs and commands . this usually uses the ex@@ ec ( ) function . in this way d@@ co@@ p &gt; can be called relatively easily . here &apos;s an example in Python :
&quot; &amp; Amar@@ ok ; sends noti@@ fications to all running scripts . for this reason , scripts should constantly monitor their default input and react accordingly to events . of course , a script can even ignore the events if there is no use for it . &quot;
&quot; configure Swit@@ ches the script to display the Setup dialog . if a script is started , Amar@@ ok sets the folder to the folder where all data should be stored . &quot;
&quot; track@@ Change Sign@@ alizes that a new piece is played . the script could now be &amp; z@@ b ; with D@@ CO@@ P features more information about the new piece ( for example , the metadata or the piece length ) . &quot;
volume Change new@@ volume sign@@ alizes a change in volume . the new volume is an integer between 0 and 100 .
custom@@ Men@@ u@@ Cli@@ cked : sub@@ menu it@@ em@@ Title paths Inclu@@ des the path to the selected files of the playlist when a user @-@ defined menu item is cli@@ cked . to remove an entry you can use d@@ co@@ p Amar@@ ok script pad@@ Custom@@ Men@@ u@@ Item ( sub@@ menu it@@ em@@ Title ) .
&quot; before &amp; Amar@@ ok ; stop , or when the user stops a script , sends &amp; Amar@@ ok ; the signal SI@@ G@@ TER@@ M to the script . this signal should be processed , e.g. storing data or configuration settings . &quot;
Amar@@ o@@ ks script management can also install script packages that the user &amp; z@@ b ; downloaded from a web server . we recommend an archive name such as e.@@ amar@@ ok@@ scrip@@ t.@@ amar@@ ok@@ scrip@@ t.@@ tar@@ .@@ bz@@ 2 so that the user can clearly see the archive as a Amar@@ ok script package .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; 1.3 will accept only script packages with the default amar@@ ok@@ script . for this reason you should design@@ ate your script packages .
&quot; the main rip@@ t must be exec@@ utable ( + x ) , the remaining loaded modules should not be exec@@ utable . use the T@@ ar parameter -@@ p to get the file rights : &quot;
&quot; if your script package is done , you can click on www.k@@ de @-@ app@@ s.org and attach the link to the W@@ iki Scrip@@ ts page of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; for your entry on k@@ de @-@ apps you should use the category Amar@@ ok ; scripts . &quot;
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is an audio player for &amp; k@@ de ; . &amp; Amar@@ ok ; has many useful and powerful features and is still surprisingly easy to use .
&quot; with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; you can simply drag music into the playlist , rather than having to go through endless menus . maybe you &apos;re looking for a very specific title for thousands in your collection . with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; &apos;s collection browser and quick search you will find the piece within seconds . &quot;
&quot; maybe you already have some play@@ lists , but can never decide which you want to hear ? then the play@@ lists browser is exactly the right thing for you . and if the decision is still difficult , the dynamic mode and smart play@@ lists automatically choose the right music according to certain criteria . &quot;
&quot; Amar@@ ok has an excellent support for Apple &apos;s iPod , i@@ Ri@@ vers if@@ p and many generic USB devices . this and many other useful features make Amar@@ ok the most advanced audio player . Amar@@ ok is intelligent , sexy and chic - just the right one to re@@ discover your music ! &quot;
&quot; usually , in the base folder of the Amar@@ ok sources , you have to enter the following to compile and install Amar@@ ok : &quot;
&quot; da &amp; Amar@@ ok ; auto@@ conf and autom@@ ake uses , you should have no difficulties while comp@@ iling . if you encounter problems , please report them in den &amp; k@@ de ; mailing lists . &quot;
&quot; &amp; Amar@@ ok ; like most applications , has some options to enable or disable compile time with the configure script . this is a list of available options . &quot;
&quot; for some of the compilation options , certain dependen@@ cies need to be met so that they can be used . details can be found in the System Requirements section . &quot;
&quot; enabled de@@ bug@@ ging symbols . you have the choice between yes , no and full . if you want to help in the development of &amp; Amar@@ ok , you should use full . &quot;
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; it is easy to setup the Setup dialog . the Setup dialog has several cards to set up the various functions of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; .
&quot; player window displays the player window in addition to the playlist , or when the option is switched off , only the play@@ lists window will be displayed . &quot;
use m@@ ood@@ bar@@ ometer : this function is only available if &amp; Amar@@ ok ; compiled with support for m@@ ood@@ bar . the option switches the experimental function of the mood bar@@ ometer .
design : this function is only available if &amp; Amar@@ ok ; compiled with support for m@@ ood@@ bar . this changes the color scheme used for the mood bar@@ ometer .
&quot; create mood files for music files : this feature is only available if &amp; Amar@@ ok ; compiled with support for m@@ ood@@ bar . otherwise , the .@@ mood files are stored in the Settings folder of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; stored ( normally ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Amar@@ ok / m@@ ood@@ bar / ) . &quot;
external Browser : lets you choose which browser from &amp; Amar@@ ok ; should be started when a browser is needed .
other browsers : here you can specify the path to another browser which is not in the list above .
&quot; save the playlist when loading , stores the current playlist automatically when moving &amp; Amar@@ ok ; . enable this option if you don &apos;t want to lose the current playlist when you finish . &quot;
&quot; relative paths for manually stored play@@ lists : if you activate this setting , use Amar@@ ok ; relative paths to the music files , starting from the location of the playlist , use . otherwise , the absolute position of music files is stored . &quot;
&quot; up @-@ to @-@ date piece when changing the piece change causes the play@@ lists window to be opened / off , to keep the current piece always in the visible window zone . &quot;
switching to context browsers automatically displays the context browser as soon as the next piece is played .
in the Ap@@ pear@@ ance section you can customize &amp; Amar@@ ok ; s appearance . the section is divided into three parts .
&quot; in the fonts section you can set the use of different fonts in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; select fonts for the following area : select play@@ lists windows , player window and context browser . click Select ... , so you can select a desired font from the selection dialog . &quot;
&quot; with the choice of user defined color scheme , you have the choice of choice and can set your own color scheme . use the color cho@@ col@@ ates for foreg@@ round and background color . &quot;
&quot; playback starts at the start , that &amp; Amar@@ ok ; after the program start , playback automatically continues with the piece at the place , with which it stopped during the last ending . &quot;
&quot; setting up the on @-@ screen display enables you to turn on the O@@ SD . if on @-@ screen display is attached , a preview of the O@@ SD is displayed and you can view the effect of all settings in this preview . &quot;
the first option is the font . click Select ... to select from the dialog the desired font for the O@@ SD . the box shadow causes the text to be sh@@ aded in the O@@ SD .
&quot; your own colors use the option to customize the O@@ SD colors for font and background . clicking on the color surfaces opens the dialog for color selection . if your own colors are not enabled , the pres@@ et &amp; k@@ de colours are used . &quot;
&quot; the Display Text input field displays the text displayed in the O@@ SD . by entering wild@@ cards , the O@@ SD can be adapted to your needs . below is a list of available plac@@ eholders and what they mean . &quot;
the screen option is intended for X@@ iner@@ ama users . this allows you to define on which screen of a multiple @-@ screen environment the O@@ SD is to appear .
the card card audio output lets you select an audio driver from the drop @-@ down box . some drivers also enable further adjustment possibilities in this map card .
the card collection is used to set up all settings for your collection . this includes the folder and type of database for the collection .
&quot; here you can select the folder , the &amp; Amar@@ ok ; according to music files . to include a folder in the collection , select the check box next to its name . &quot;
&quot; Browse the sub@@ folder recur@@ sively : this causes &amp; Amar@@ ok , to browse both the requested and their sub@@ folders after music . &quot;
&quot; monitor changes : allows &amp; Amar@@ ok to monitor the selected folders on changes ( e.g. , if music files are added or deleted ) . in addition , an incre@@ mental search is performed to make the necessary changes to your collection . &quot;
import play@@ lists : causes &amp; Amar@@ ok to add all play@@ lists found in your collection folders ( .@@ pl@@ s- and .@@ m@@ 3@@ u files ) to your collection . the automatically added play@@ lists will then appear later in the play@@ lists browser .
&quot; the part collection database is used to select a database for the collection . the combination field driver : lets you choose between S@@ q@@ l@@ ite or My@@ S@@ q@@ l . if My@@ S@@ q@@ l is selected , further set up in the sub@@ window My@@ S@@ q@@ l is necessary . &quot;
&quot; the My@@ S@@ q@@ l device is used to set the database for &amp; Amar@@ ok ; using the computer , the computer is entered , where the My@@ S@@ q@@ l database is entered , where the database is accessible . name : is the database name to which the connection is established . &quot;
use username : and password : to enter the data that need to be used for connection to the database .
the card card last@@ .@@ f@@ m supports the support for last@@ .@@ f@@ m . &amp; Amar@@ ok ; can transmit the names of played pieces to a last@@ .@@ f@@ m server and create music recommendations regarding the current piece .
&quot; here , enter your username and password for your Last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile . if you do not have a profile , you can register one on the last@@ .@@ f@@ m website . &quot;
send broken pieces and update the profile : this setting makes it possible &amp; Amar@@ ok ; to transmit the names of the played pieces to your last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile .
&quot; similar interpre@@ ters call : after activ@@ ating this setting , &amp; Amar@@ ok ; a list of similar interpre@@ ters to the each played play . note : you can view the list in the context browser . note : you don &apos;t need a last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile to use this feature . &quot;
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is an audio player for Unix systems ( like &amp; z@@ b ; Linux ) . for more information see the summary of the features and the gallery with screen@@ shots .
Amar@@ ok only needs the package k@@ deli@@ bs and otherwise no other K@@ DE packages . you need to have k@@ deli@@ bs so installed ( including the included programs because &amp; Amar@@ ok ; requires some of them to find e.g. modules or scripts ) . we have written a small guide on how to compile k@@ deli@@ bs .
&quot; some features such as the O@@ SD pres@@ upp@@ ose that your window manager maintains the relevant standards of fre@@ ed@@ es@@ kt@@ op@@ .org . Gn@@ ome will work , but flu@@ x@@ box will work for example difficulties . we try to support Amar@@ ok on all platforms , so we use k@@ deli@@ bs and Q@@ t because they provide an excellent development environment . &quot;
probably one of your files will get a bug in the tag@@ lib library for days . you can locate the file in ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Amar@@ ok / collection _ sc@@ an@@ .@@ log . after that you can delete the file and create the collection again .
please report this bug to the tag@@ lib developers at bug@@ s.@@ k@@ de@@ .org .
if you use MySQL as a database then try SQ@@ Lite . support for this in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; is something more mature .
&quot; make sure all of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; used libraries are compiled with the same comp@@ iler version . if e.g. &amp; Amar@@ ok ; with G@@ CC 3.4 , tag@@ lib but compiled with G@@ CC 3.@@ 3.@@ X , this leads to crashes when editing the Meta information . &quot;
&quot; if you use K@@ DE with art@@ s@@ d then de@@ activate automatic . switch off when in@@ active for ... in setting the sound system , or at least don &apos;t use a value of 1 second . &quot;
&quot; you can also send us the back@@ trace via e @-@ mail ( the e @-@ mail automatically opens at a crash ) . if it is a frequently occurring crash and send us a good back@@ trace , the bug is guaranteed . &quot;
&quot; this is because many programs write data as UT@@ F @-@ 8 to the Meta information , but do not mark it as a Uni@@ code . the following Perl script fixes the problem . &quot;
# ! / usr / bin / per@@ l die &quot; The file $ AR@@ GV &#91; 0 &#93; does not exist unless -@@ f $ AR@@ GV &#91; 0 &#93; ; use MP3 : : M@@ p@@ lib ; my $ mp3 = MP3 : : M@@ p@@ lib ; my $ v@@ 2@@ tag ; print _ v@@ 2@@ tag ( $ v@@ 2@@ tag ; amp ; UT@@ F@@ 8 ) ;
this script requires the Perl module MP3 : : m@@ lib . it can be installed with this command : Perl -@@ M@@ CP@@ AN -@@ e &apos; install MP3 : : M@@ p@@ lib &apos;
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; s symbols in the status bar ( Rand@@ om / Dynamic Play@@ list ) are always active in K@@ DE 3.@@ 4.0 . this is a known bug in K@@ DE 3.@@ 4.0 .
if you get this error : amar@@ ok@@ app : symbol look@@ up error : amar@@ ok@@ app : un@@ defined symbol : _ Z@@ N@@ 11@@ K@@ System@@ Tra@@ y@@ 9@@ set@@ Pix@@ map@@ ER@@ K@@ 7@@ Q@@ Pix@@ map then check if Amar@@ ok uses the correct Q@@ t library . this can be seen with ld@@ d &apos; which amar@@ ok@@ app &apos; _ BAR _ gre@@ p q@@ t .
&quot; to fix this error , you may need to remove any col@@ li@@ di@@ fying Q@@ t version or / etc / ld@@ .@@ so@@ .@@ conf so that Amar@@ ok finds the right version first . &quot;
there are some ways . most installation problems are easiest by using an expert for your Unix or Linux distribution . you can also use the forum and the IR@@ C under ir@@ c.@@ fre@@ en@@ ode@@ .net in the channel # Amar@@ ok .
&quot; sorry , this entry is only available in Deutsch . &quot;
after the start of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; appears just a blank playlist . how do music work there now ?
this is simple . use the file browser on the left and open the desired folder . then drag the files to the right part of the playlist .
&quot; to intui@@ tively keep the surface , the start window was converted to the statisti@@ c window . you can find it under Extras Statistics . &quot;
the meaning of these symbols has changed with Amar@@ ok 1.4 Fast For@@ ward : stars are for evaluation by the user while the points are automatically calculated .
&quot; to evaluate pieces , the review column needs to be displayed in the playlist . click on the title bar of the playlist and select column . you can also use the short@@ cuts Windows + &#91; 1 @-@ 5 &#93; . this also works if Amar@@ ok is in the background . &quot;
select the files you want to remove and then press Del on your keyboard . or click with the right mouse button on your selection and then select From playlist to remove from the drop down menu .
&quot; drag a playlist file with your mouse to the playlist , and let it fall , just like you would do it with other files . that &apos;s how easy it is : - ) &quot;
&quot; in the toolbar of the playlist , right next to the addition button , you can save the playlist playlist . click on it . &quot;
&quot; presum@@ ably , the program x@@ mm@@ s @-@ config . install the x@@ mm@@ s @-@ de@@ vel package and install &amp; Amar@@ ok ; new . also look to lib@@ visual , this package contains many very nice visu@@ aliz@@ ations . &quot;
the equ@@ ali@@ zer is located in the context menu ( via the right mouse button ) . you can also find it via the menu bar under Extras E@@ quali@@ zer ....
&quot; yes , this really is true ! no ! &amp; Amar@@ ok ; used one from the back@@ end independent approach , so the real question is to support G@@ stre@@ amer / x@@ ine / Arts / N@@ MM / MAS / K@@ DE@@ mm ? . as you can see , we can even de@@ code text and PNG ! &quot;
&quot; it may ! maybe you use Fed@@ ora / Red Hat Linux , so that in default no MP3 decoder can be supplied ( for patent law reasons ) . the solution : Alt @-@ F2 , g@@ g : Red@@ Hat mp3 k@@ de , input &quot;
start the Ya@@ ST Online Update and install the &apos; Multimedia Option Pack 1 &apos; .@@ na so ... &amp; Amar@@ ok ; plays MP3 &apos;s off : - )
&quot; if you use the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver with the al@@ sa sink , the device has to provide a bl@@ ender . a mixer allows multiple applications to use the device at the same time and can be achieved using the d@@ mix module for al@@ sa ( e.g. SB@@ Live ) or through the d@@ mix module for al@@ sa ( Software @-@ Mixer ) . &quot;
&quot; the output of this command should help you search for the problem matter and a solution . for G@@ Stre@@ amer , you may need to specify a different sink ( such as a sink ) . &quot;
&quot; G@@ Stre@@ amer is the best choice for most people . G@@ Stre@@ amer is the best choice for most people . G@@ Stre@@ amer is the best choice for most people . G@@ Stre@@ amer is reading the file , de@@ code it and sends the PC@@ M data to AL@@ SA . just like X@@ M@@ MS . &quot;
&quot; X@@ M@@ MS also de@@ codes the data first . G@@ Stre@@ amer can output directly to AL@@ SA , just like x@@ ine . &quot;
&quot; use either the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver ( really great ! ) or optimize the settings of the Arts . open Control Center Sound &amp; Multimedia Sound System . enable sound server with highest priority ( real @-@ time priority ) and increase the size of the sound buffer ( warning , see next point of the FAQ ! ) . make sure art@@ s@@ wr@@ apper su@@ id is set : &quot;
at K@@ DE 3.@@ 2.@@ x there are problems with K@@ DE@@ Multimedia co@@ dec@@ s that can cause imp@@ aired reproduction . read this error report . the mag@@ nific@@ ant of the sound buffer in your AL@@ SA setup file .@@ as@@ o@@ und@@ rc can also help .
&quot; either do not use the Arts driver , but instead G@@ Stre@@ amer or x@@ ine , or install K@@ DE @-@ Multimedia completely to get the faster arts co@@ dec@@ s ( li@@ bar@@ ts _ mp@@ eg@@ li@@ b.@@ so &amp; etc . ) . &quot;
&quot; probably use the Arts Driver . use another driver ( the x@@ ine driver has been greatly optimized for analy@@ zer ) , or reduce the size of the Arts buffer in the control center and sound &amp; multimedia , sound system . &quot;
&quot; G@@ Stre@@ amer is installed , but if I want to switch to G@@ Stre@@ amer driver , crashes &amp; Amar@@ ok ; off . why ? &quot;
&quot; after installing G@@ Stre@@ amer , you need to register all the components . perform g@@ st register to register all G@@ Stre@@ amer components . &quot;
read the G@@ Stre@@ amer FAQ . if that doesn &apos;t help you can also ask the IR@@ C channel # g@@ stre@@ amer .
&quot; try this ( exit Amar@@ ok before ! ) : - Download ff@@ m@@ peg , compile and install it . then run g@@ st @-@ register , once as a system administrator and once as your normal user . then delete the module folder with g@@ st @-@ config / g@@ stre@@ amer @-@ config ) and run the g@@ st register again . start now &amp; Amar@@ ok ; . &quot;

&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is an album of the British Mike Old@@ field . I like it very and find that the name sounds good . in addition the name contains the magic K ... : )
&quot; thanks to D@@ CO@@ P , this is already possible . set an alarm in your calendar program and let it run with the alarm this command : d@@ co@@ p Amar@@ ok player play &quot;
&quot; this command lets &amp; Amar@@ ok ; playback starts . make sure that &amp; Amar@@ ok ; running before you go to bed , then you will be wo@@ ken by the gentle tones of the music that you have stopped before going to bed . &quot;
how to get the current in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; learn current titles when you are on another computer ?
&quot; if a working SS@@ H environment is present , you can proceed as follows . this command gives you interpreter and title of the current piece : SS@@ H -@@ i ~ / .@@ ss@@ h / id _ r@@ sa ih@@ re@@ IP d@@ co@@ p --@@ user their username Amar@@ ok player now@@ Pl@@ aying &quot;
replace IP address with your IP and your username with your username . this pres@@ upp@@ oses your identification in the ~ / .@@ ss@@ h / id _ r@@ sa file .
&quot; visu@@ aliz@@ ations can be separated from &amp; Amar@@ ok ; click on the keyboard and the current analy@@ zer opens in an independent , in the size variable window . &quot;
the combination of Ctr@@ l + right mouse button puts a piece in the click order in the queu@@ e . by pressing the Enter key after a search in the playlist the first search result is played and the search is reset .
&quot; OK , the player window and the playlist have tri@@ cky functions , but how does it look with the symbol in the control bar system section ? &quot;
&quot; click with the &amp; R@@ MB@@ n ; on the title of a browser . in the context menu , you can select which browsers should be displayed . &quot;
my Personal folder $ HOME is on a NFS drive . after the start of Amar@@ ok the collection database can not be created and on the console many error messages appear . what now ?
the internal SQ@@ Lite database from &amp; Amar@@ ok ; does not work with NFS . either you need to link ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Amar@@ ok to a local drive or use Amar@@ o@@ ks MySQL support .
&quot; in the wa@@ v folder , select a few pieces and drag them to the desired destination folder in a con@@ quer@@ or window . for automatic coding , take files from folders mp3 or og@@ g instead . &quot;

&quot; basically , this adju@@ sts the previous assessment with a dimin@@ ishing value , based on how often the piece was played . the more often the piece was played , the less impact every single assessment has on the overall result . &quot;
&quot; you can select the evaluation for a piece yourself by clicking with the right mouse button on a column header in the playlist window . then select the rating of a piece as well , by clicking with the right mouse button on the piece and edit : select rating or pressing F2 . you can also edit the evaluation in the dialog metadata . &quot;
developers do not want to tell you when you want to publish a stable version of Amar@@ ok . this means : K@@ DE packages have a specified publishing plan that is not put together with the short @-@ term plan of Amar@@ ok .
this is a new feature in Amar@@ ok that some users can also find anno@@ ying . des@@ elect the option icon while playing animations in the general settings .

audi@@ osc@@ rob@@ bler is a free service to the information on which pieces are played on an independent server . the service is free and you only need a free username and password .
if you want to use AL@@ SA please use the latest available version . old AL@@ SA versions have a lot of crashes and therefore also caused a lot of error reports .
probably became &amp; Amar@@ ok ; compiled before you installed x@@ ine or g@@ stre@@ amer . therefore the . / configure routine does not compile these output modules . you need to re@@ configure and install these output modules .
&quot; now I have &amp; Amar@@ ok ; new installed , but the output modules still do not appear . and now ? &quot;
&quot; you probably have to install the package g@@ stre@@ amer @-@ de@@ vel . the same is true for x@@ ine , you need to install x@@ ine @-@ de@@ vel . then you have to re@@ compile and install x@@ ine @-@ de@@ vel . &quot;
I get the error G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ CR@@ IT@@ I@@ CAL * * : factory for &apos; Ad@@ der &apos; has no type .. How can I fix this ?
&quot; your version of G@@ Stre@@ amer was compiled with P@@ rel@@ inking , which is in@@ compatible with G@@ Stre@@ amer . you need to compile G@@ Stre@@ amer without P@@ rel@@ inking . a tip from mer@@ lin @-@ t@@ c : don &apos;t use L@@ DF@@ LA@@ GS if you compile Amar@@ ok . &quot;
&quot; I get the error message There is no element present to handle the file &apos;s mim@@ et@@ ype audi@@ a / mp4 , although the module g@@ stre@@ amer fa@@ ad is installed . &quot;
&quot; to play mp4 or m@@ 4@@ a files with G@@ Stre@@ amer , the g@@ stre@@ amer @-@ quick@@ time module must be installed next to g@@ stre@@ amer @-@ fa@@ ad . &quot;
you will receive the mistake There is no element present to handle the stream &apos;s mim@@ et@@ ype audio / m@@ peg .
&quot; you play an MP3 stream , but the g@@ stre@@ amer @-@ mad module is not installed . install the module and then run as a system administrator g@@ st register . then restart Amar@@ ok . &quot;
I have a second sound card and use AL@@ SA . how to use Amar@@ ok the second sound card ?
set under Settings Amar@@ ok ... audio output you enter the device . typical is e.g. h@@ w : 0 for the default sound card and h@@ w : 1 for the second .
here you can see an example of ~ / .@@ as@@ o@@ und@@ rc on a machine with an on@@ board AC@@ 97 co@@ dec and a USB audio device :
p@@ cm@@ .@@ intel@@ 8x@@ 0 { type plug sl@@ av@@ e.@@ p@@ cm &quot; h@@ w : 0 &quot; } c@@ tl@@ .@@ intel@@ 8x@@ 0 { type h@@ w card 0 } p@@ cm@@ .@@ us@@ b @-@ audio { type h@@ w card 0 } p@@ cm@@ .@@ us@@ b @-@ audio { type h@@ w card 1 }
&quot; in the x@@ ine setup dialog , enter us@@ b @-@ audio , and the output takes place on the USB sound@@ card . so @-@ lib takes care of the conversion of sample rate , channels and so on . &quot;
&quot; if you want to use a virtual d@@ mix device , de@@ activate the tick on sound@@ card m@@ map . &quot;
&quot; sorry , but the audio output with Arts is not supported further . you may naturally like to take this problem even into your hand ! if you want , you can become the new so much needed car@@ egi@@ ver for the arts : ) &quot;
&quot; listening to music should be quite simple ! for this reason , there is the setup wizard , which will be shown at the first start of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; if you don &apos;t like your collection later , then this quick start guide will help you . with her help you will have set up &amp; Amar@@ ok ; in just a few minutes . &quot;
&quot; creating a playlist is very simple . drag the mouse to the playlist in the playlist . if you are satisfied with the playlist , you can save them with the help of the pop @-@ up playlist . you can find this button in the toolbar of the playlist window . &quot;
&quot; when you have own play@@ lists , you can add them to the play@@ lists browser . if the playlist is included in the folder of your collection , and you will find the option to import play@@ lists . by clicking on a playlist , you will find different ways to load the playlist . &quot;
&quot; to play an audio CD , please choose actions audio CD in the menu bar . it opens a file browser with multiple folders and CD pieces in WAV format . drag the WAV files into the playlist and then press the playback button . &quot;
the audio CD function uses the audio CD protocol : / and is not compatible with all available drivers .
the burning function is also available in the playlist . just click on an entry with the right mouse button and follow the Burn Menu . you have several options for burning a CD .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; requires the installation of some software packages . the necessary packages are listed below . there are also some additional packages listed below that make work with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; more enjoyable .
&quot; if you install these packages via a package management system ( e.g. RPM or apt ) , you also need to install the development versions of these packages ! &quot;
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is a versatile multimedia player . it offers many different ways to keep your music collection under control . like any normal multimedia player also has &amp; Amar@@ ok ; a player window with the most important features .
&quot; this chapter explains how all the functions of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; used , including creating a collection and a playlist . &quot;
&quot; the player window is your one @-@ click &amp; Amar@@ ok ; Control Centre . at the top of the window , there is a running text display showing the current play , bit@@ rate and sam@@ pl@@ er@@ ate of the current piece . clicking on this area changes the display of the already ex@@ pi@@ red playing time to the remaining time of the play . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the player window contains a selection of audio analy@@ sers , also under the running text display . you can switch by the available analy@@ zer by clicking with the left mouse button on the area . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; Amar@@ ok ; Analy@@ zer can be separated from the player window . press d on your keyboard and the current analy@@ zer is displayed in an independent , larger window . &quot;
&quot; under the running text display , the buttons PL and E@@ Q . the PL button activ@@ ates or de@@ activ@@ ates the playlist window , while the E@@ Q button is used for setting E@@ quali@@ zers . &quot;
&quot; the rest of the player window consists of playback buttons , volume control and play @-@ position slider . use the slider to set the play position or volume . with the playback buttons you can start playback / stop and move to the next or previous piece . &quot;
&quot; the use of the built @-@ in E@@ quali@@ zer is simple and works with all audio drivers . there are 17 pres@@ ets , from classic to techn@@ o , and you can easily create your own preferences . &quot;
&quot; to display the equ@@ ali@@ zer , use Extras E@@ quali@@ zer from the main menu or click on the E@@ Q button in the Player window . once you select the E@@ quali@@ zer check box , the equ@@ ali@@ zer is in operation . &quot;
the Play@@ list of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; is the wid@@ est developed playlist of all available multimedia players .
&quot; the playlist itself can be divided into two main areas , on the left side is the navigation area . in the navigation pane you will find some of the excellent functions of the playlist , such as the context browser . &quot;
&quot; the context browser displays various information about the current piece . its appearance can be matched with the help of context browser designs . the context browser contains three sub windows : music , text and interpreter . &quot;
&quot; if you already have earlier versions of &amp; Amar@@ ok , you might notice that the sub@@ window will drop off . the information presented there will now be distributed to other parts of &amp; Amar@@ ok . furthermore , the information can be collected in the statistics window ( Extras statistics ) . &quot;
&quot; the sub@@ window music shows information about the currently running piece , as well as the performers and the album . &quot;
&quot; the first area in this sub@@ window displays information about the piece . in the title is the name of the piece , artist and the album . below you see the cover image of the album and next to it a Musi@@ c@@ Bra@@ in@@ z icon . click on this icon to check the piece in the Musi@@ c@@ Bra@@ in@@ z database . &quot;
under the Musi@@ c@@ Bra@@ in@@ z symbol you will find further information about the current piece . you see here how often and when the piece was played for the first and last time as well as its evaluation .
&quot; the images can have arbitr@@ ary names , but pictures with the word front in the name are treated preferred . the context browser will also display cover images , which are either downloaded with the Cover administration or embedded in ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 2 tags . &quot;
&quot; the next section , recommended pieces , lists several recommended pieces . if you click on one of these pieces , it will be played immediately . &quot;
among the recommended pieces are the favourite pieces of this artist . this section shows the five highest rated pieces of the current interpreter .
you can set up which information in the music window should be displayed . right click anywhere in the sub@@ window and select from the context menu .
&quot; the last section , albums of the artist , lists all albums of the current artist you have in your collection . if you click on an album , it will work up and you see the content of the album . &quot;
you can click on all the pieces in the individual areas to immediately start playing . you can also click on it with the right mouse button on it and then select one of the options for adding the piece or album to the playlist .
&quot; note also the chapter for writing scripts . once you click on the text sub@@ window , this function is very flexible and it is possible to download the text for the piece from the Internet . if no text script runs , you can choose which should be started . &quot;
the Edit button allows you to edit the lyrics . the modified version is then stored in &amp; Amar@@ ok &apos;s collection database . no running text script is required .
the Find button opens a search for google.com according to the lyrics for the current piece ( in an external browser window ) .
&quot; group@@ ing interpreter - group@@ ed only the top level , each piece is displayed directly below the interpreter . albums or gen@@ res are left aside . &quot;
&quot; if you want to see compositions or sound@@ track albums , this is the best view of your collection - these albums are shown at the beginning of the list under Differ@@ ent Interpre@@ ters . &quot;
&quot; group Interpre@@ t / Year - Album - Sor@@ ted to Interpre@@ t and then after the year of the album in descending order ( the latest first ) . if the year for an album is unknown , the default 0 - alb@@ um@@ name is related . &quot;
group@@ ing Album - All albums of your collection are sorted alphabe@@ tically by each other . the performer is ignored .
group@@ ing Genre / Interpre@@ t - your pieces will first be sorted by genre and among them by interpre@@ ts .
&quot; group@@ ing genre / performer / album - this setting works just like the above , but is additionally sorted by album below the performer . &quot;
&quot; with the help of the remaining buttons , you can customize and combine the group@@ ing according to your wishes . &quot;
&quot; with the last button , you can change the settings to the collection . note : &amp; Amar@@ ok ; will automatically capture your collection once you have something on the selected folders . if you own many pieces , this might take a while . &quot;
&quot; directly under the toolbar , there is a search filter . it is the same in the list view as well as in the tree view . for the use of this filter , refer to the playlist in this manual section . &quot;
&quot; the search filter is a selection field with which you can filter the most recently added pieces to your collection . you can also choose your total collection , from the last 24 hours up to one year . &quot;
&quot; by clicking with the right mouse button on an entry in the collection browser , you will receive the following options . &quot;
load - This le@@ es the current playlist and inserts the selected pieces in the currently valid order in playback .
&quot; to attach to the playlist , add the selected pieces of the current playlist . by double @-@ clicking on an entry you can reach the same effect . &quot;
set pieces in queu@@ e - This function adds the selected pieces to the queu@@ e . this will be played next .
save as a playlist ... - Stor@@ es the selected pieces as a playlist . you will be asked for a name under which the list should be stored .
&quot; for more details , refer to the Media Player browser section for more details . &quot;
&quot; burn all pieces of this interpreter / burn on CD - This will be broadcast the selected pieces to K@@ 3@@ b and either burned as data or as an audio CD . if K@@ 3@@ b is not installed , this option will not be displayed . &quot;
edit metadata ( for n pieces ) ... - Op@@ ens the dialog for piece information and lets you change tags for one or more pieces .
&quot; if you confirm this , the selected files will be deleted from your computer . &quot;
&quot; mark the compilation - Select the selected album as a compilation , and it will appear in different interpre@@ ters . &quot;
lifting up a compilation - Change a compilation of marked album back into a normal album . the album is then no longer displayed under different interpre@@ ters but again under the respective interpreter .
&quot; the play@@ lists browser makes it easy to handle many play@@ lists . among other things , it also contains Intelligent play@@ lists . &quot;
the lower part of the play@@ lists browser contains the smart play@@ lists . these use &amp; Amar@@ ok ; s built @-@ in database to automatically create some useful play@@ lists at run@@ time . the smart play@@ lists consist of :
never played : a playlist with the pieces in your collection that have never been played .
&quot; even created smart play@@ lists are possible . click Smart Play@@ list to open the dialog to create a new Smart playlist , where you can enter all the required criteria for your new playlist . &quot;
&quot; the Media Player sub@@ window will be used for the connection of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; for example , to use your iPod with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; in / m@@ nt / i@@ pod . if &amp; Amar@@ ok ; started , find the pieces on your iPod to Interpre@@ t sorted in the top list view of the media player browser . &quot;
&quot; to transfer pieces to your iPod , drag the desired titles from the playlist and drop them on the list interpreter . if you &apos;re finished , click App@@ ly . if the transfer is complete , exit &amp; Amar@@ ok ; and trigger the disk connection for your iPod . &quot;
&quot; under the toolbar , there is a search area where you can search for a file . the search is especially useful in folders with very many files because in the file list all files are hidden , which do not match your search criteria . &quot;
&quot; for example tar : / home / mi@@ ke / musik@@ .@@ tar@@ .g@@ z enter and press Enter , you can access music in the music .@@ tar@@ .g@@ z file . now you can drag and drop music from there into the playlist . &quot;
&quot; if the playlist is longer than in the window , the attachment of files can be difficult . in the case the holding down of the Shift key may be helpful : this will automatically be inserted at the end of the list , and not at the mouse position . &quot;
&quot; you can change the order by simply adding the entries to the desired location . once you enter letters , only the pieces will be displayed which contain the letters . to reset the filter , press the back button until the text field is empty again . &quot;
&quot; if you enter by space @-@ separated search terms , &amp; Amar@@ ok ; search for entries that contain all search terms . if you enter for example one two three , the search will find all entries that contain one , two and three . &quot;
&quot; for example , one OR two OR three . in this example , all pieces are found that contain one or two or three ( or a combination thereof ) . &quot;
&quot; if you want to search for entries that contain spaces , then close the search term with go@@ ose feet : Mike Old@@ field , but not by entries such as Mike J. Old@@ field . &quot;
&quot; if you specify a specific search column , you can also search for larger or smaller ones . for example : rating : &gt; 50 . this is searching for pieces that have a higher rating than 50 . &quot;
&quot; if you want to search for a piece that does not contain a specific keyword , set a minus sign before the search term : -@@ something looks for pieces that do not contain something . &quot;
&quot; you can combine these syntax variations according to exposure . example : Mike Old@@ field OR score : &gt; 50 comment : bad . this is searching for all pieces that have either Mike Old@@ field , or have a higher rating than 50 and not include the comment bath . &quot;
you can set the sequence of entries by pressing the Ctr@@ l key and then click on the right mouse button in the desired order to the entries . the number corresponds to the order in which the pieces are reproduced .
&quot; the toolbar of the playlist is located at the bottom of the window . it contains buttons for some functions of the playlist . on the left side , you will find the Add button that you can add to the playlist . &quot;
&quot; next , the buttons follow und@@ o and restore . thus , you can rever@@ t or restore changes to the playlist . &quot;
&quot; in the middle of the toolbar , there is a unique , magni@@ fied analy@@ zer . the refres@@ h rate can be adjusted by clicking the right mouse button on the analy@@ zer . &quot;
the last button in the toolbar is menu . it opens the same menu like that which you are displayed in the player window over the right mouse button . over this menu you can set up &amp; Amar@@ ok ; &apos;s configuration .
&quot; there are many more available buttons for the toolbar , for example video control and volume control . you can set up the displayed buttons by clicking on the menu and set up toolbar buttons . &quot;
&quot; the status bar displays the title of the current piece , the number of pieces and the total game time of all pieces . in addition , the status for random mode and retri@@ eval is shown . the status for random mode and retri@@ eval can be changed simply by clicking twice in the appropriate display area . &quot;
&quot; you can also hide the status bar , and disable the status bar option in general settings . &quot;
&quot; the context menu can be reached by clicking with the right mouse button in the player window , or by clicking on the menu in the playlist . through this menu , you can reach the Settings of &amp; Amar@@ ok . &quot;
a click on this entry will open the visu@@ alisation plug @-@ ins window . there you can select the visu@@ aliz@@ ations of &amp; Amar@@ ok .
&quot; behind this entry , there is a sub @-@ menu with links to this document and other information about &amp; Amar@@ ok ; . &quot;
the cover administration is a useful tool for managing your cover images . you can start it by selecting actions cover management in the collection browser .
the cover administration contains a list view of all albums in your collection . you can view all albums of an interpreter in your collection by selecting the performer on the left side .
&quot; with the View menu , you can choose what is to be displayed in the Cover administration . choose from : &quot;
&quot; the queu@@ e management received your big move in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; 1.3 . with this feature , you have even more control over the playlist . this number represents the order in which &amp; Amar@@ ok ; the pieces will be played : 1 is played first , 2 as second , and so on . &quot;
&quot; if you want to add a piece to the queu@@ e , select the piece in the playlist and then click + . &quot;
&quot; there are three types of dynamic play@@ lists , two of which are already pre@@ determined ( the details to set up these are followed later ) . &quot;
&quot; fills your playlist with random pieces from your entire collection , adding more random pieces while playing . &quot;
add pieces based on Last@@ .@@ f@@ m recommendations ( earlier : audi@@ osc@@ rob@@ bler ) . this mode requires that some pieces are already in your playlist . you don &apos;t need a Last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile to this dynamic playlist .
&quot; in this way , your current playlist will be saved by the new playlist . so you should save the old playlist right under certain circumstances ! &quot;
the two pres@@ et modes Rand@@ om Mix and Play@@ lists mix immediately complete your playlist and you have to add at least one piece itself from your collection . the recommended pieces will be added at least one piece itself from your collection . therefore your playlist will only be filled at the end of the first piece .
&quot; if you want to keep the current playlist , activate the latest possible dynamic mode : settings Dynamic Mode . this will use your existing playlist as start point . using the same menu entry , dynamic mode can also be de@@ activated again . &quot;
the Edit button fills the current playlist and adds new pieces according to the dynamic mode . edit the playlist to edit the playlist and you can change the appropriate settings .
&quot; with a right click on a dynamic playlist , you have the option to click Edit . then the dialog opens to edit the playlist settings . &quot;
&quot; enter any name for the playlist . however , the name should be unique to avoid confusion . &quot;
&quot; if this setting is not active , your playlist will continue to grow , the setting for upcoming pieces will be ignored and they will not be heard twice in this playlist . however , if the setting is active , the played pieces will be removed while resp@@ ecting the settings played . &quot;
&quot; played pieces - this is the number of played pieces , which are to be kept at the beginning of the playlist . thus , you can easily see which pieces have been played recently . &quot;
&quot; this is the number of pieces that are to be added after each played piece to the playlist . if you click here more than 1 , the playlist will grow continuously , because only one piece can be played and removed . &quot;
&quot; the settings on the right side are already described in the previous section . on the left side of the dialog , you can select from already existing play@@ lists or smart play@@ lists . if you cross multiple play@@ lists , you can add random pieces from any of the play@@ lists . &quot;
some scripts allow your own settings . you can customize the settings by starting the script and then click on setup .
&quot; you can install new &amp; Amar@@ ok script by installing on script . once you have installed the script , a new entry will appear in the list . you can also install new scripts directly from the Internet . &quot;
&quot; if you do not want to use a script longer , you can delete it . select the script to delete , then click Un@@ install . &quot;
&quot; if you are looking for information on how to write your own script , please refer to the Scrip@@ ts section . &quot;

&amp; c@@ dr@@ da@@ o ; : this program burns audio or data CD tracks in a run ( also called disk @-@ at @-@ once mode or DA@@ O ) based on a text description of the CD content ( TO@@ C file ) .
&quot; &amp; cd@@ record ; / m@@ kis@@ of@@ s ; : burn all kinds of CD @-@ R@@ s . &amp; cd@@ record ; has all the functions that also &amp; c@@ dr@@ da@@ o ; usually automatically &amp; cd@@ record ; for burning CDs . in some cases , &amp; c@@ dr@@ da@@ o ; but a higher quality with burned audio CDs . &quot;
cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia : a program to read digital audio data from a CD ( CD@@ DA - Compact Disc Digital Audio ) .
O@@ GG Vor@@ bis Library : O@@ GG Vor@@ bis is a completely open , patented and professional technology for audio encoding and for dealing with audio data streams . O@@ GG Vor@@ bis benefits from open source and stands in direct competition to MP3 . this library is used by O@@ g@@ g Vor@@ bis de@@ oder@@ - and encoder modules . &quot;
&quot; M@@ ad : this is a high quality MPEG audio decoder . it currently supports MPEG @-@ 1 , MPEG @-@ 2 and MPEG 2.5 . all three audio layers Layer I , Layer II , and Layer III ( e.g. MP3 ) are fully supported . this library is used by the MP3 decoder module . &quot;
l@@ ame : a well developed MP3 decoder that can compete in terms of quality and speed with commercial enco@@ ders . l@@ ame is used by the MP3 encoder module .
FLA@@ C : a free open source co@@ dec for los@@ s@@ less audio compression and de@@ compression . it is used by FLA@@ C decoder module and the external audio encoder module to read and write FLA@@ C files .
&quot; li@@ bs@@ nd@@ file , FF@@ m@@ peg , FLA@@ C , Mus@@ ep@@ ack Decoder : other libraries for processing different audio formats . with FF@@ m@@ peg , it is possible for example to de@@ cryp@@ t w@@ ma files to burn them to an audio CD . &quot;
SO@@ X : an aid program that can convert and convert between different audio formats . SO@@ X is used by the So@@ X audio encoder module .
trans@@ code : a command line program for video processing . you will need it if you want to read a DVD .
&quot; V@@ CD@@ Im@@ ager : a fully featured author system for editing , dis@@ assem@@ bling and analy@@ zing video CDs and Super Video CDs . &quot;
&quot; norm@@ alize : this tool is used to adjust the volume of music files to a standard level , for example , for creating mixed CD &apos;s and M@@ p@@ 3 collections . without Norm@@ alize , the different recording levels of the different albums can lead to the un@@ happy effect , which the music pieces can be played differently lou@@ dly . &quot;
e@@ Movi@@ x : this is a very small Linux distribution . it contains the necessary software to start from CD and automatically return all videos in the base folder of the CD .
this is a convenient method to re@@ charge newly opened projects . the associated sub @-@ menu contains a list of these projects . one click on an entry will open the project .
&quot; saves the current project . once the project has been saved , the previously created file will be over@@ written , otherwise it will be asked for a new file name . &quot;
save the current project under a new filename . K@@ DE &apos;s Dialog save is displayed where you can select folder and file name for the project file .
saves all opened projects . that is the same as if you were to save for each single project file .
&quot; if a project has been modified and not saved , ask &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; after what is to happen . you can then disc@@ ard between saving and changes . furthermore , you can also cancel the closing and keep the project opened . &quot;
&quot; closes all opened projects . &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; will ask for any project stored for each project , just as if you were called for each project file closing . &quot;
closes all opened projects and termin@@ ates &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; . for each non @-@ stored project will be asked what should happen as if you called File Close .
&quot; when you visit this entry , you can select files to add to the project via the appearing dialog . if the current project is a data CD , the files added will appear in the base folder of the CD . &quot;
&quot; open the dialog &quot; &quot; Burn &quot; &quot; for the current project . this dialog is basically the same as the Properties dialog of the project . the only difference is the additional button burning , the &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; for burning the medium , the burning dialog can only be opened if the project already contains data . &quot;
&quot; opens the Properties dialog for the current project . here you can make many project @-@ related settings . each project type has different possible settings , most of which are described using the What is that ? help ( accessible via the right mouse button ) . &quot;
this entry will only appear in an active data CD / DVD or video DVD project . it is useful when you import files for a multi @-@ session CD . it is useful for you to see files for a multi @-@ session CD . it is useful for you to see the files and folders already existing on the medium .
this entry will only appear in an active data CD / DVD or video DVD project . this function causes &amp; k@@ 3@@ b to remove imported files from the current project .
&quot; it also allows you to copy a copy of a CD to another medium without a project file . alternatively , you can also only create a copy of a CD instead of normal copying . you should also prefer cl@@ oning if you want to copy CDs with broken sectors or video CDs . &quot;
&quot; alternatively , you can only create a copy of a DVD to another medium . alternatively , you can also only create a copy of a DVD with the help of copying dialog , so the target medium must be large enough to be able to record the entire ( video ) data of the source medium in the original form . &quot;
opens the dialog for dele@@ tion of a CD @-@ RW . this allows you to delete all contents or parts of a CD @-@ RW .
&quot; open the dialog for format@@ ting a DVD . with this dialog you can format a DVD ± R ( W ) , making the content completely deleted . &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; lets you choose between the writing modes over@@ write and incre@@ mental . &quot;
&quot; the dialog asks you for a * .@@ is@@ o , * .@@ cue or * .@@ to@@ c file as data source , which can then be burned immediately by pressing the burning button . ( Ner@@ os * .n@@ r@@ g files are currently not supported , but you need to use other tools such as Nr@@ g@@ 2@@ I@@ so . ) &quot;
&quot; burn a previously created DVD image . the dialog asks you for a * .@@ is@@ o file as a source of data , which can then be burned immediately by pressing the burning button . &quot;
&quot; this dialog window usually appears after reading a DVD in the table of contents , but can also be used everywhere . it contains information about the read video , encoding settings and even ways to change the size and to cut black edges . &quot;
&quot; displays information about the inserted medium . this information is presented in the table of contents and includes properties of the medium , such as size and title length of CD or DVD . &quot;
&quot; displays a list of tool@@ bars by &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; . if an entry is checked , the toolbar currently appears in the main window . &quot;
&quot; if this is crossed , a small bar is displayed at the bottom of the window . it contains information about the status of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; and its activities . if this is not checked , the status bar is hidden . &quot;
&quot; the folder view shows an overview of your folder and CD / DVD drives . if the content view is enabled , its contents will be displayed in the table of contents . CD / DVD drives also have a context menu with functions such as media information , locks and blocking of the disk or ej@@ ection of the medium . &quot;
&quot; the content view enables selecting and drag@@ ging files into the project view . the table of contents is also the interface to read audio or video CDs , if a drive was selected with a corresponding CD / DVD in the folder view . &quot;
&quot; the head bar is a narrow area , which is only visible when the project view contains open projects . the head guard does not have a real function , it only looks pretty and separates the project view clearly from the rest of the views . &quot;
&quot; this opens a dialog window for changing the key assignments for &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; . after you have chosen one of the available commands in the upper part , you can adjust the keyboard mapping for it below . &quot;
&quot; this starts the k@@ 3@@ b ; setup wizard . this allows you to set the correct per@@ missions for burning CDs and DVDs , so you need to enter the password for the administrator ( root ) when starting the wizard . &quot;
opens the settings of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; here general program settings can be made . almost all functions of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; should work on startup . this dialog is intended for person@@ alizing and fine tuning of the program .
&quot; &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; is like many other &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ applications also , equipped with a &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; interface . using this interface , parts of the functionality can be controlled using a shell script . &quot;
&quot; to use the &amp; D@@ CO@@ P functions , you can either use the command line program d@@ co@@ p , or the somewhat more convenient program K@@ d@@ co@@ p . both programs are identical in functionality , so it &apos;s rather your taste and the type of your task is crucial to which the enclosed programs will give you the default . &quot;
&quot; in this chapter we assume that you can use the command line d@@ co@@ p . to use the &amp; D@@ CO@@ P functions , you must make sure that &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; started . then enter something like the following to the console : &quot;
&quot; in addition to the general &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; functions that have all &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ program painted , supported &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; mainly two more parts described below . &quot;
&quot; the standard D@@ CO@@ P interface of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; provides functions such as copy@@ cd , format@@ ted DVD and other features for creating new projects . &quot;
D@@ CO@@ P@@ Ref cre@@ ate@@ Data@@ CD@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Ref cre@@ ate@@ Video@@ CD@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Ref cre@@ ate@@ Video CD@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Ref cre@@ ate@@ Video CD@@ Project ( ) void copy@@ left ( ) void er@@ ase@@ C@@ dr@@ w ( ) void er@@ ase@@ C@@ dr@@ w ( ) void bur@@ n@@ C@@ d@@ Image ( K@@ URL ur@@ l ) void bur@@ n@@ D@@ v@@ d@@ Image ( K@@ URL ur@@ l )
&quot; as a result of such a cre@@ ate@@ XX@@ X@@ Project method , you get a D@@ CO@@ P reference to the newly created project : D@@ CO@@ P@@ Ref ( k@@ 3@@ b , K@@ 3@@ b@@ Project @-@ 0 ) Altern@@ atively you can get a reference to the project using # d@@ co@@ p k@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b@@ Interface curr@@ ent@@ Project Th@@ rough using this reference it is possible to change the project via K@@ 3@@ b@@ Proj@@ ect@@ Interface . &quot;
K@@ 3@@ b offers the above @-@ mentioned K@@ 3@@ b@@ Proj@@ ect@@ Interface and the powerful K@@ 3@@ b@@ Data@@ Proj@@ ect@@ Interface which is only applicable on data projects ( CD and DVD ) :
&quot; void cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der ( Q@@ String name ) void ad@@ dur@@ l ( Q@@ String name , Q@@ String parent ) void ad@@ dur@@ l ( K@@ URL : : list ur@@ ls , Q@@ String parent ) void ad@@ dur@@ l ( Q@@ String path ) void ren@@ ame@@ Item ( Q@@ String path , Q@@ String new@@ name ) void set@@ Volum@@ e@@ ID ( Q@@ String id ) &quot;
&quot; for example , the following script creates a data project , multiple folders and then add files to the new folder : &quot;
# ! / bin / b@@ ash PRO@@ J@@ ECT = $ ( d@@ co@@ p k@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b@@ Interface cre@@ ate@@ Data@@ CD@@ Project ) d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der bar / fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT ad@@ dur@@ l / home / tru@@ eg / som@@ ef@@ il@@ e.@@ txt / fo@@ o / bar
&amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; is an audio CD ; -@@ reader for &amp; k@@ de ; . with it you can easily read audio CD ; s can be read out and saved in MP@@ 3- or O@@ GG files . other formats are also possible depending on the encoder installed on the computer .
&amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; is the interface from cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia ( for reading &amp; CD ; data in WAV files on hard disk ) and by many co@@ ders that coding these wa@@ v files ( compression @-@ free compression ) . other enco@@ ders can be added to the program ( if they have been installed ) .
first the title of the &amp; CD ; read out and saved in wa@@ v files on the computer ( los@@ s@@ less and compressed ) ; and then
&quot; in a second step , these WAV files ( usually one per title ) are compressed into the mp3 or O@@ GG format or in other formats like the los@@ s@@ less FLA@@ C . &quot;
&quot; for the first step , reading the &amp; CD ; , it is used by &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . almost every distribution has compiled a pre @-@ compiled package ; if this is not installed yet , this must now be done . &quot;
&quot; for the second step l@@ ame must be installed ( for MP3 ) , og@@ g@@ pre ( for O@@ GG ) or other co@@ dec . however , all these programs are usually not necessary for any Linux distri@@ butions . &quot;
&quot; which encoding / file format should be used ? the chapter Wel@@ cher Ko@@ di@@ erer gives a small introduction about code , audio quality and compression factors . &quot;
&quot; a word for copying protected audio CD ; s : as already said , used &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia for reading the audio data from the &amp; CD ; . if not the firmware of the CD ; / DVD device can handle the protection , it is not possible to use a protected audio CD ; even avoid buying copy @-@ protected audio CD ; s ! &quot;
&quot; while the setup must be made only once ( the setup dialog can be called so often until a suitable configuration has been found ) , the daily handling of reading a &amp; CD ; this leads ( hopefully ) to understand the slim approach of the user interface , which you often stum@@ ble at the beginning . &quot;
&quot; can convert into many formats - depending on which coding programs are installed ( MP3 , O@@ GG , FLA@@ C &amp; etc ; ) &quot;
&quot; can &amp; CD ; collect information from the Free@@ DB from the Internet or can work completely without network , and everything is manually collected . &quot;
this is just a short list of the commands of the main window . on the page step by step example you will find more information about how this program is used as well as screen@@ shots with descriptions of the tab@@ s for the configuration of the program .
&quot; starts the CD@@ DB request of the CD @-@ data according to the setup of request in the CD@@ DB tab . ( this can be local or online , in the latter case the connection to the Internet must first be established . ) &quot;
start reading and - when a encoder is configured in the Code Settings tab in the Setup Catalogue - encoding .
opens a sub @-@ menu with a list of available En@@ coder so that the selection can be read with another encoder than the default . it is to note that previously the encoder was configured in the Code Settings tab in the Setup dialog .
opens the file manager so that an already read file is selected instead of a complete &amp; CD ; read and encoding .
&quot; opens the Setup dialog to configure the type of noti@@ fications ( such as protocols , pi@@ ep@@ sen ) for program events ( such as reading the &amp; CD ; ex@@ pi@@ red ) . &quot;
&quot; opens the main setup dialog from &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; with various card cards ( such as En@@ coder , to set up the encoder ) . here you have to go before the program can be used successfully ! &quot;
&quot; this chapter describes sound quality , coding and compression rates and helps you choose the right coding . &quot;
&quot; if no audio information is to be lost , a los@@ s@@ less audio format is required . besides FLA@@ C there are other such as &apos; shor@@ ten &apos; or &apos; monkey &apos; that may be available for this distribution . &quot;
&quot; among the audio formats that lose information through data compression depending on their psycho@@ acousti@@ cally model , MP3 and O@@ GG may have a slight advantage over MP3 in the audio quality at lower bit@@ rates ( up to 128 k@@ bps ) , but above this bit@@ rate the differences are less important since both Ko@@ di@@ ers generate very good audio quality . &quot;
&quot; O &apos; not &apos; free , l@@ ame is provided free of charge with most distri@@ butions , but there are open license questions &quot;
+ High to very high audio quality ( high bit rates ) but slightly lower quality compared to O@@ GG .
O@@ GG - if only music belongs to a computer or computer based music system and / or if one of the few existing O@@ GG play@@ sets exists .
&quot; MP3 - if music should also be heard on other devices , such as standard DVD players , portable devices ( USB stick , memory card , hard disk ) or special auto stereo systems . today - initially 2009 - these devices usually only support MP3 format . &quot;
a short list of parameters for audio quality and resulting compression rates for &apos; l@@ ame &apos; ( MP@@ 3s ) ( see &apos; l@@ ame --@@ help &apos; for further parameters ) :
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et medium &apos; = This setting gives good visibility for most people and most of the music
&quot; --@@ pres@@ et standard &apos; = This setting should usually offer acceptable transparency for most people and most music pieces , and has already quite high quality . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo systems with high quality . &quot;
&quot; --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; = 224 to 256 k@@ bps V@@ BR , compression rate up to 6.3 . needs up to 320 k@@ bps for complex music pieces and somewhat less for less complex parts of the piece . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo systems with high quality . this is the preferred choice . &quot;
&quot; --@@ pres@@ et extreme -@@ b 256 &apos; = 256 k@@ bps C@@ BR , compression rate about 5.5 . requires always 256 k@@ bps for complex and less complex pieces of a title . some older devices need C@@ BR@@ s . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo systems with high quality . &quot;
&quot; -@@ h &apos; = 128 k@@ bps C@@ BR common stereo , compression rate about 11 128 k@@ bps for all pieces of a title . good En@@ ough for music of you@@ ths , portable devices and auto @-@ elev@@ ators . but not good enough for better hi @-@ fi stereo systems . &quot;
&quot; --@@ pres@@ et Ins@@ ane &apos; = 320@@ k@@ bps C@@ BR . this setting will be exagger@@ ated for most people and most environments , but if you absolutely want to have the absolute highest quality without regard to the file size , then select this setting . &quot;
the CD ; information which is manually entered or fet@@ ched by the program from the Free@@ DB will be available in the program as a list of parameters . you can pass / used with &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; and the coding program to generate the folder and file names as well as the properties of the music files .
&quot; in connection with coding programs , there is often a combination of program settings for the Ko@@ di@@ erer and these parameters here . the manual or the help to the co@@ ders explain the switches for these programs . &quot;
&quot; for example , to add the &amp; CD ; titles to the keywords ( English : tag ) when MP@@ 3s are enco@@ ded with l@@ ame , the switch -@@ TT by l@@ ame and the title parameter of &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; added . the result looks like this : &apos; ... -@@ TT { title } ... &apos; . &quot;
this is a summary of &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; parameters that can be used ( = button name in the assistant ) :
&quot; this is what the Free@@ DB is : a free database where people can read / enter the audio CDs , so that all others can download this information instead of entering into the computer . it is to note that here only text is spoken : &amp; CD ; Title , Artist , names of pieces &amp; etc ; , not of the audio file itself . &quot;
&quot; yes , it should be legal , but I ( note of the translation ) is not lawyer . however , no one can prevent you from the &amp; CD ; more or less worth@@ less so neither the artist nor the music company may be damaged . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; is active to select a check box ( sending an address ) . in this way of configuration , it seems that the email address is not used when retri@@ eving the data from the server ( This may only know the program@@ mer who has checked the code . ) &quot;
&quot; there are copies of the main database in many countries . if &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; to use Free@@ DB , the geograph@@ ically closest mirror server is to be used . this saves bandwidth on the network and compar@@ es the load between the hosts . &quot;
a visit to fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org provides a current list of mirror servers for online retri@@ eval of &amp; CD ; information during reading a &amp; CD ; or alternatively the complete database can be downloaded or ( usually created monthly ) only the updates of the database .
which reading program is used to store pieces from CD ; in wa@@ v files on my computer ?
&quot; there are rum@@ ors that cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia is used ; who wants to know more exactly , search in the source code .... This was always the best choice for reading audio CD ; see note that the cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia package must first be installed from the appropriate distribution if this is not yet done . &quot;
&quot; to save the selected wa@@ v files , the code can be selected for l@@ ame ( MP@@ 3s ) , og@@ gen@@ c ( O@@ g@@ gs ) and FLA@@ C ( a los@@ s@@ less compression for audio data ) on the tab to set up the encoding . other enco@@ ders can be added to this tab . &quot;
&quot; the Ko@@ di@@ erer package must be installed by the Linux distribution , before the Ko@@ di@@ erer can be used . further information on Ko@@ di@@ ers is found in the chapter Wel@@ cher Ko@@ di@@ erer . &quot;
&quot; after installing a encoder , you can get more information about its switches by entering a command such as l@@ ame -@@ help or l@@ ame --@@ help in a console window ( eg ; console ) . &quot;
&quot; this can have many causes . check the device name of the &amp; CD ; / DVD drive , write and read genuine on it and whether both cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia and the audio co@@ effici@@ ents of your choice ( l@@ ame for MP@@ 3s , og@@ gen@@ c for O@@ g@@ gs , fla@@ c &amp; etc ; ) are installed . this could give a hint to what is wrong . &quot;
check if you don &apos;t want to read a copy @-@ protected audio CD ; check out the cover of the &amp; CD ; this will not succeed !
&quot; there is a chapter with a step by step example . even if you use other settings , this can give tips on how to proceed . &quot;
&quot; have you read the complete manual , understood everything but are somehow still unsure what to do ? well , no problem , follow this step @-@ by @-@ step example , and you &apos;ll get enough information to set up those areas that make the program exactly what you want . &quot;
&quot; in this example , we will start the program for the first time , set up everything and read our first &amp; CD ; read extreme &apos; to create MP@@ 3s with a V@@ BR ( variable bit rate ) from 224 to 256 k@@ bps on average and ID@@ 3@@ V1 keywords . &quot;
&quot; cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia and l@@ ame must already be installed on your computer . both programs should be found as pre @-@ compiled packages for your Linux distribution . however , it is not necessary to compile the source files , which you can of course always do . &quot;
please make sure that the directory / usr / share / cd exists and that you have write privileges on it ( eg ; by trying to copy something inside ) .
&quot; the first section covers the basic set @-@ up of &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; , something which is probably only done once and &quot;
the second section describes how to proceed to read a &amp; CD ; what needs to be repeated for each reading &amp; CD .
here we determine the code to be used for compression of music ( l@@ ame ) as well as the audio format ( MP3 ) as well as the resulting sound quality ( --@@ pres@@ et extreme = &gt; V@@ BR 224 to 256 k@@ bps ) .
&quot; although we can change these settings at any time , we will probably not be able to change it at any time reading a &amp; CD ; change once the appropriate settings are found . &quot;
the device name is passed to the reading program so that it can read the &amp; CD ; -@@ data / pieces .
&quot; often / dev / c@@ drom is a symbolic link to the actual device name of your drive . if this does not work or if more than a CD ; / DVD drive exists , you can also get a look at the file / etc / f@@ stab and an attempt with the existing entries of the device desig@@ nations for the &amp; CD @-@ ROM ; and / or DVD drives . &quot;
&quot; the map card General Settings . here is not much to do . here , an additional conversion can be defined . in our example everything will be as c@@ logged / entered as shown in the screen@@ shot . &quot;
&quot; only in case of incomplete information , please select , so that you will be informed when information on the creation of keywords ( tags ) are missing . &quot;
the card @-@ card CD ; settings . just select both entries . we are comfortable and let the &amp; CD ; data automatically download via the Internet from a Free@@ DB computer .
note : the computer must be connected to the Internet during reading the &amp; CD ; so that it can access the Free@@ DB server .
&quot; the second drop @-@ down box is easier , a &amp; CD ; entry is found , immediately starts reading the &amp; CD ; the directory entry and the resulting directory names / filename or tag entries , can be easily changed . the directory or filename is changed with Kon@@ quer@@ or &gt; and the ID@@ 3 tags with K@@ id@@ 3 , the &amp; k@@ de ; Tag@@ ger . &quot;
&quot; apart from this example , please note : if you want to manually enter everything manually , you can use Free@@ DB locally in offline mode if you want to use the database before . however , you can choose to use Free@@ DB in offline mode if you want to use Free@@ DB in offline mode , at least the first . the mode is set up on the following map card . &quot;
&quot; CD@@ DB is for us Free@@ DB . these are settings for the data query , for retri@@ eving the &amp; CD ; information from the Free@@ DB server over the Internet . how does the system know which data to get the CD ? read the section about Free@@ DB . &quot;
&quot; mode : we have not downloaded the database , we just want to work with the remote database on the Internet server . &quot;
&quot; CD@@ DB server : please go to the fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org page and look for a mirror server in your area . on this way , the load is distributed between the hosts . however , this setting will work as a first attempt . &quot;
&quot; both work equal to the server , as many fire@@ walls boot up the protocol 88@@ 80 , there may be more luck with the protocol 80 because the &amp; HTTP protocol is usually open to surf on the internet . &quot;
&quot; in this example , we do not want to send any &amp; CD ; data to the Free@@ DB server . the first check box should be de@@ activated . &quot;
just take the settings from the screen@@ shot . ( make sure the folder / tmp exists on your computer )
&quot; number of simultaneously tap@@ ing pieces : sorry , there is one reason why more than one at the same time with just an existing drive ? parallel reading and coding ? the author does not know it , so simply try themselves . &quot;
CD ; after reading the last piece : check this to check the &amp; CD ; at the end of the process .
&quot; custom folder for temporary files : if you tick this , then / must be specified the path / folder where the wa@@ v files are stored . if the field is not enabled , the files are created in the private folder . don &apos;t forget this folder if you want to do something with WAV files . &quot;
&quot; just type it on the screen@@ shot . the command is a bit long , under certain circumstances something must be fed to the right to see everything . &quot;
&quot; --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; defines the audio quality of MP@@ 3s . as previously mentioned , this is a setting for very good audio quality , even for very good hi @-@ fi stereo systems . the resulting bit@@ rate is 6.3 . this is a good balance between audio quality and memory consumption . &quot;
note the entry &apos; --@@ id@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 @-@ only &apos; for restric@@ ting the creation of tags to version V1 / V@@ 1.@@ 1. &apos; ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 2 &apos; tags may be deleted if necessary . % f and % o are internal variables for the name of the input file ( including the full path ) and the output file ( including the full path ) .
set the rest as in the screen@@ shot . some comments for future use outside this example :
&quot; number of WAV files at the same time : with a dual core or Quad@@ core or even a multi @-@ processor machine , you can try to consoli@@ date more than a WAV file at the same time . &quot;
&quot; that &apos;s it , we just finished the basic setup of &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; ex@@ pi@@ red . this configuration is used as a standard for each reading a &amp; CD ; if you have chosen the organizational structure of your music , you never need to change it again . &quot;
&quot; in this section , it is described how the process of reading the &amp; CD ; the disk structure , the way the music is organized on the hard disk , was described in the previous section , as we are comfortable and the CD ; data from the Free@@ DB will be drawn . the process that is described in this section must be repeated for each reading &amp; CD . &quot;
&quot; as we use a CD , which is not yet contained in Free@@ DB , the screen@@ shots will see a little different from the data fet@@ ched from Free@@ DB . therefore , you will learn the CD ; data manually , rather than retri@@ eving it from the Internet . comments will point to the differences . &quot;
try not to find the &amp; CD ; this example is a &apos; special &apos; output of the author of this manual .
&quot; if this is not yet done , then the &amp; CD must now be inserted into the drive , which was defined in the main window . &quot;
&quot; after a short moment , the pieces and their length should be listed in the window , as in the screen@@ shot . this only when the CD ; as an audio CD ; can be identified and can be read by cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . &quot;
&quot; if this is not done , look for questions and answers to the Help or go back to the previous section regarding the basic settings . &quot;
&quot; attention : if the CD ; successfully retri@@ eved from the Free@@ DB , all tracks of the pieces are already filled and the name of the artist and the album are shown . &quot;
&quot; for the event that there is more than one entry in the database with the &apos; unique &apos; &amp; CD ; key for your &amp; CD ; there is a window displayed , and you can select the database entry that is best suited to your &amp; CD ; &quot;
&quot; if you have not selected the check box for the automatic retri@@ eval of Free@@ DB ( on the page &amp; CD ; settings in the dialog for Settings ) , you can also manually trigger this by choosing the first button in the toolbar . if you don &apos;t have a local database , but get the data from the Internet , you need the connection to the Internet . &quot;
e 1.2 Step 02 : the CD editor - input of the CD @-@ data and the title of the first piece
&quot; enter the data for your &amp; CD ; according to the pattern on the next screen shot . the title of the piece in the first line of the input field &apos; Current Title &apos; , the rest of the data in the input field &apos; Album &apos; . &quot;
&quot; the artist no longer has to be entered in the &quot; &quot; Current Title &quot; &quot; input field unless you have a compilation with different artists for each piece . &quot;
&quot; the lower comment field can be used for the individual comments in@@ vidu@@ al per piece , the comment field of the album will be used for comments that apply to all pieces of the CD . &quot;
&quot; note : after the successful retri@@ eval of the data from the Free@@ DB , the CD editor is not empty , but it is always a good idea to check the contents of the CD editors ( e.g. whether all words start with capital letters or not ... ) , but also to check if there are any undes@@ irable remarks . &quot;
&quot; note : in this example , we only use ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 tags . this limits the length of the fields to 30 characters for the artist , album and title of a piece and on only 28 characters for the commentary area . &quot;
&quot; you can change the tag information of the generated files at any time using the tag editor . K@@ id@@ 3 is a good tool for MP3 files , with it you can also re@@ build ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 2 tags . &quot;
tags are not supported by all enco@@ ders or file formats .
&quot; for more information go to the website of fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org and read the information about the categories . pop or rap , for example , can be found under rock . &quot;
after choosing &apos; OK &apos; you come back to the main window . just click on the line with the second piece .
&quot; the CD editor window appears again and you see that the fields for the album are already filled with the entered data , which we recorded for the first piece . simply enter the items for the items in the current piece . &quot;
click on the next line in the main window and proceed in the same way until you have entered all the title data of the &amp; CD ;
note : this window does not appear if you have downloaded the data from the Free@@ DB file . it is already sorted into one of these categories of the database .
it is the third button of the toolbar . note that the artist and the album are displayed above the piece list .
&quot; note that there is a check mark before each line of a piece . only the titles that are so marked are read out . a simple click on the line switches the selection of the piece , or press the button All pieces select at the bottom of the screen to select all the pieces at once . &quot;
&quot; by clicking on the button select the reading process , this window appears for confirmation . click OK and then we will take a look at the window with the orders and track what runs out . &quot;
&quot; click on the tab Or@@ ders to switch on the order window . it is in the left upper half of the window , directly under the buttons of the toolbar . &quot;
this is the window to check the orders . the first piece is just read on the hard drive . the status of the program is shown in the left lower part of the window in the status bar .
this error message can be seen if you try to work with a co@@ dec you have not yet installed . pieces that have not been successfully coded are marked with a red &apos; X &apos; in the order list .
&quot; by the way , the folder for the T@@ MP file and the destination folder are not what we have entered here in the example . have you checked if you have typ@@ ed access to the temporary files and the destination folder ? ; - ) &quot;
now it is clear why the error occurred right after the end of the reading of the first piece .
&quot; the order 1 reads the first piece , it is finished . but we have a new record : order 4 is the coding of piece 1 into the format MP3 . this makes reading and encoding in parallel . note the status message in the lower part of the window , it is now improved . &quot;
&quot; the author of the program has no configuration settings to supp@@ ress this behavior . the only thing that seems configur@@ able is the number of parallel processes for reading and coding . in high @-@ performance machines , the result is uncle@@ ar . the computer used with a AM@@ D@@ 64 does not seem to have a problem during simultaneous reading and coding ( of however , two different pieces ) . &quot;
&quot; now the last title is read , while another piece is enco@@ ded and a third order is written in the queu@@ e of the coding . after the last piece is enco@@ ded , a small window will appear with a message for a short time in the upper left part of the window . &quot;
&quot; for the successful use of &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; , you need &amp; k@@ de ; 3.@@ x. or 4.@@ x and cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . if you want to create compressed audio files like MP3 or O@@ GG , you need the coding of your choice . &quot;
&quot; if you are familiar with CVS , you can download an anonymous copy from there . most distri@@ butions include a pre @-@ compiled package , da &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; a part of an important &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ package is . if you are reading this , you probably have already done it ... &quot;
&quot; this section is aimed at persons compiled by source files , and not for users who use a pre @-@ compiled package of their distribution . &quot;
&quot; if you are looking for help as the program can be adjusted to your needs , then the following is correct for you : &quot;
&quot; a program that calls for many different programs , has many variations of settings . best read the step by step example to get to know the options and settings . it shows screen@@ shots of the different map maps of the settings and also contains comments for options that are not used in the example . &quot;
&quot; Hi , always read on ? even if only the help menu has been cli@@ cked out after the first start of the program , without any c@@ lue as it should go on from this somehow empty screen ( especially if there is no audio CD ; in the drive ) , or from the unusual short menu ? &quot;
what is it about ? who reads this has probably already started the program . it should look something like this :
a bad example : unfortunately no e @-@ mail . the author cannot maintain this manual . it is intended as the first version for a manual too &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator .
&quot; strange if you have managed to get the source file from &amp; k@@ de ; SV@@ N , then you don &apos;t need these information , but ... &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mid ; is the MI@@ DI@@ - and Kara@@ ok@@ esp@@ iel@@ er von &amp; k@@ de ; and besides others , he also has some features with real @-@ time graphics and kar@@ a@@ oke real @-@ time high@@ lighting of texts too , the other &amp; UNIX ; -@@ MIDI players don &apos;t have . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mid ; runs under &amp; Linux ; and FreeBSD . it builds on the O@@ SS system , so it should work on all systems with O@@ SS - and &amp; k@@ de ; support also support the &amp; Linux ; Ultr@@ as@@ ound project driver needed for G@@ US cards . AL@@ SA is included as soon as it supports a sequ@@ encer . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mid ; displays the lyrics on the screen with changing color , making it easy to follow the piece . &quot;
graphic display of the activity of each MIDI channel by high@@ lighting the pressed keys on the ( virtual ) keyboard .
drag &amp; Drop so that you can drag in &amp; k@@ de ; any MIDI file from one &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; drag window to K@@ Mid .
supports the two existing standards to store text in MIDI files ( rec@@ itals or tex@@ tual events ) . K@@ Mid automatically determines the procedure used .
&quot; seat support . if you finish &amp; k@@ de ; during the playback of a song , K@@ Mid starts again with the same song again next time . &quot;
&quot; supports external MIDI syn@@ thesizer , AW@@ E , FM and G@@ US cards ( for the latter you need the LU@@ P driver and g@@ us@@ d ) . &quot;
&quot; first , you can select opening ... from the File menu . it appears the usual file dialog with which you can select the desired song . &quot;
you can also drop a file from one &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ Windows into the &amp; k@@ mid ; window will drop . this also works with multiple songs simultaneously .
&quot; to play a piece of music , open it and press the button play in the toolbar , select the entries from the menu item or press the space bar . &quot;
&quot; please note that &amp; k@@ mid ; a piece automatically starts , as soon as you move it to the &amp; k@@ mid ; window . ( for several pieces , they are added to a collection and then played after each other . ) &quot;
&quot; once &amp; k@@ mid ; playing a piece , you can jump to any place by using the middle mouse button and drive back and forth . &quot;
&quot; if you find that a song is played too fast or too slow , you can click on the arrows left and right of the tempo ad and thus change the speed . to return the original speed , double click on the Tem@@ po@@ - LCD . &quot;
&quot; the space bar has two tasks : when a piece is played , a pressure affects the space bar as a pressure on the button breaks or selecting the menu entry break in the menu item , so breaks the play . press the space bar while no play is played , starts &amp; k@@ mid ; playback . &quot;
&quot; lyrics can be stored in two ways in one piece of music . some pieces use tex@@ tual property , others use lyrics and other both . some pieces have no text : - ) &quot;
&quot; in &amp; k@@ mid ; you can set what events are to be displayed and even better : the event type is automatically selected , so you have to set up a song so you don &apos;t have to set anything manually . however , you still have the possibility to change this if you want to see the other way . &quot;
&quot; if you want to set an event type , select the entries from the Settings menu and select the entries from the menu . the same function also have buttons 1 and 2 . &quot;
&quot; a collection is a list of MIDI files , which you can summar@@ ize . in this section , how you can use collections efficiently . &quot;
&quot; to create a collection , first open the collection manager . you will find this in the menu item under the point Organ@@ ize . click New and enter the name for the collection . &quot;
you can also copy an existing collection by clicking on Copy and then specify the name for the new collection . this collection will contain the same songs as the original .
&quot; if you have more than one collection , you can set the f@@ ake in the collection manager . &quot;
&quot; in the temporary collection , all the songs you want to add to any other collection . &quot;
&quot; when applying the application , this collection is not stored . consider when you add a lot of pieces . &quot;
&quot; to add songs to a collection , it must be selected in the collection manager . there you can add a song with the Add button . in turn , you can select the file dialog with which you can select the song you want . &quot;
a second method to add a song depends on the setting of automatic adding to the collection .
&quot; when automatic adding to the collection is enabled , a piece is automatically added to the active collection when opening ( using File opening or drag &amp; drop ) . &quot;
&quot; if automatic adding to the collection is not enabled , the temporary collection will be activated and emp@@ tied when opening a piece . this collection will then be added to the newly opened pieces . &quot;
&quot; to remove a song from a collection , you need to open the collection manager , select the collection and the desired song and then click Rem@@ ove . &quot;
&quot; you can select the order in which the songs are played . if you select the sequence from the sub@@ menu of the menu collections , the songs are played in the order , as they were added to the collection . &quot;
&quot; when you add or remove songs or select random order in the menu , the order will be re@@ defined . &quot;
&quot; to play a song , select it in the collection manager , or use the selection list above the kar@@ a@@ oke text . &quot;
&quot; to jump to a song , select the Next song , the entry next song from the menu item or press the arrow on the right . &quot;
&quot; to reverse a song , select the Previous piece , the entry previous piece from the menu item or press the arrow on the left . &quot;
&quot; to delete a collection , open the collection manager , select the collection to delete and click the Del@@ ete button . &quot;
&quot; the temporary collection cannot be deleted . however , it does not matter , since it is not saved when leaving &amp; k@@ mid . &quot;
&quot; this is absolutely necessary for syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers , which are not general @-@ MIDI @-@ capable . in this case , the MIDI @-@ Map General @-@ MIDI events translate into events that the syn@@ thesizer understands . &quot;
&quot; for example , you can create a MIDI Map that trans@@ forms all the events of the Change patch to B@@ right Piano in events of the Change patch to Tru@@ mp@@ et type and thus always lets a trumpet sound if originally a piano should play . &quot;
&quot; if you have only one sound card , you don &apos;t need a MIDI map because all sound cards are GM ( incl . A@@ we - and G@@ US cards , FM devices and so on ) . &quot;
&quot; there are , unfortunately , no programs to create MIDI maps . so you need to edit the corresponding file manually ( with your favorite editor ) . &quot;
a MIDI @-@ Map is a text file that saves all the necessary translations for the playback of a piece .
&quot; each section may only appear once , except the key@@ map section , which may appear as often as desired . however , the condition for this is that each occurrence has a different tex@@ ti@@ d ( see below ) . &quot;
Def@@ ine PAT@@ CH@@ MAP ... EN@@ D Def@@ ine Key@@ map &quot; Name of Key@@ map ... &quot; EN@@ D Def@@ ine Key@@ map &quot; A further key@@ map ... &quot; EN@@ D Def@@ ine CHAN@@ N@@ EL@@ MAP ... EN@@ D OP@@ TION@@ S ... EN@@ D
you see that def@@ ine is used to indicate that a section starts ( except for OP@@ TION@@ S ) and EN@@ D that the end of a section is reached .
please send me your Map file as an email so I can offer in future versions of &amp; k@@ mid ; support can provide for devices that are not General MIDI @-@ compatible .
this section describes how the patches of General MIDI are displayed on your specific keyboard . general usage looks as follows :
&quot; please note that the left side of the equal sign is ignored . it is assumed that the GM @-@ patches are in the correct order ( from 0 to 127 ) , so you may not change the order and not leave any row for one of the 128 instruments . &quot;
&quot; the optional All@@ Key@@ s@@ To M is needed to put all the sounds that this instrument need to place on the sound with the number M . if your keyboard is not supported ( GM @-@ Patch 127 ) , you can use a drum ( e.g. with sound 60 ) , which is similar to a gun shot . &quot;
&quot; so if a MIDI file is to play a note with patch 127 ( gun shot ) , it takes patch 100 ( the drum on your keyboard ) and plays the sound 60 , regardless of which sound is in the MIDI file . &quot;
&quot; please note that here with the term &quot; &quot; drum patch &quot; &quot; the patch is meant in which each sound represents another percussion instrument ( drum , cy@@ mb@@ al , mar@@ ac@@ as &amp; etc ; ) and not the one where the sound means the pitch of the same drum ( like some key@@ boards ) . &quot;
the Key@@ map section is used to specify how sounds are displayed on a specific channel or instrument . the use is :
&quot; like the PAT@@ CH@@ MAP section , the sequence of lines is very important , as well as its presence . so you have to create 128 entries . &quot;
you can define several key@@ maps for each channel and instrument . you only have to use different names in the first line .
key@@ maps are mainly used to depic@@ t sounds on the percussion channel . take a look at the provided key@@ maps as an example .
&quot; this section can be used to make some channels down to others . for example , if you want to s@@ wap the first and the second channel , simply check out the CHAN@@ N@@ EL@@ MAP section . &quot;
&quot; however , these settings are useful for key@@ boards , which have the percussion on a specific channel ( General MIDI to Channel 10 , others need channels 16 or 9 ) . &quot;
&quot; Midi devices need 16 channels , the CHAN@@ N@@ EL@@ MAP section has 16 lines , numbered from 0 to 15 , based on the following pattern : &quot;
&quot; if you use the For@@ ce@@ Patch option , all events will be ignored . if you use the For@@ ce@@ Patch option , all events will be ignored to change the patch on this channel . in this case , the patch x is always used . &quot;
the For@@ ce@@ Patch option may be useful for example to always use the per@@ c@@ ussions patch on the percussion channel .
&quot; the value for Pit@@ ch@@ Ben@@ der@@ R@@ atio speci@@ fies in which ratio Pit@@ ch @-@ Ben@@ der events are multiplied . if a MIDI file sends a Pit@@ ch @-@ Ben@@ der event with the value n , this is then used with the n * ( r / 40@@ 96 ) and then only for@@ warded . the value 40@@ 96 is used so that in the map file no dec@@ im@@ al comm@@ as are available ) . &quot;
&quot; this setting is needed because GM has given that a keyboard which is supposed to play a pitch higher with the value 40@@ 96 , a tone higher . unfortunately , some key@@ boards will try to play two notes up to one oc@@ tave higher . to find the right value on your keyboard , you &apos;ll need to try a bit with &amp; k@@ mid ; &quot;
&quot; to use a MIDI @-@ map , simply open the MIDI settings dialog . &quot;
the channel view is a window with a whole series of keyboard ( one for each MIDI channel ) . on these key@@ boards you see which sounds are being played .
&quot; you can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a specific channel . for each channel , there is a selection list where you can select an instrument . if you change an instrument , the button lights no more green but red to indicate that no longer the original instrument is used . &quot;
the channel view ( until now ) has two different views to display the played sounds . view the Settings menu under the point channel view : settings
&quot; the tempo @-@ LCD displays the speed with which a song is played . the higher the number , the greater the speed . &quot;
&quot; you can change the tempo of a song . so if you find , for example , a song is too fast to follow the text , you can slow down it . to change the pace , use the arrows to the left and right of the LCD . &quot;
&quot; a MIDI file is a file that contains information about how to play a piece of music . it contains the notes , the rhythm , speed , &amp; etc ; . this allows the same MIDI file to be played on two different devices , just like two different musicians perform the same notes in very different ways . &quot;
&quot; well , I can &apos;t force anyone , &amp; k@@ mid ; but a typical MIDI file needs about 50 KB , while an mp3 file needs 4 MB ( a compression ratio of 1 : 80 ) and with a good syn@@ thesizer you can also change the individual instruments , speed &amp; etc ; you have control over everything . &quot;
&quot; that can happen if you have a binary distribution ( rpm , de@@ b ) by &amp; k@@ mid ; that happens because &amp; k@@ mid ; without AW@@ E support compiled . to eliminate the problem you need to download and install a source distribution ( for example by k@@ mid ; &apos;s home page ) &quot;
&quot; I would like to add a whole folder to a collection , but I don &apos;t want to add all files individually . &quot;
&quot; accept , therefore support &amp; k@@ mid ; drag &amp; drop . just open the folder you want to add in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; , select all the files and drag them to the &amp; k@@ mid ; window . &quot;
&quot; in advance , enable automatic adding to the collection . otherwise , the files will be added to the temporary collection . &quot;
&quot; you can press the arrow key on the left of the Tem@@ po@@ - LCD to slow down playback . to restore the standard tempo , you can double click on the LCD . &quot;
I have on a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Desktop a &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ Windows with my MIDI folder and &amp; k@@ mid ; on this desktop ( if I want to play a kar@@ a@@ oke file ) or if I want to play a kar@@ a@@ oke file .
&quot; if you want to listen quickly to a file without adding them to a collection , switch the automatic adding to the collection , and the new ; file will be added to the temporary collection . opening files &quot;
&quot; let &apos;s assume you have the MIDI files A.@@ mid , B.@@ mid and C.@@ mid@@ . first you just want to play the first file . so , set the Automati@@ cally Add to the collection and open A.@@ mid@@ . your temporary collection then contains exactly this one MIDI file . &quot;
then decide to play B.@@ mid and C.@@ mid and create a collection with all three files . how do you do that ?
&quot; these people have sent me MIDI files or post@@ cards . thank you ! if I hear these songs or see the postcard , this anim@@ ates me to program on &amp; k@@ mid ; to program . &quot;

&quot; in addition to this , &amp; k@@ mid ; also found on his homepage , which is located at http : / / www.@@ ar@@ rak@@ is.@@ es / ~ r@@ lar@@ rosa / k@@ mid@@ .html . you can also find links to pages with other kar@@ a@@ oke songs , &amp; etc . &quot;
a sound card . I recommend you a good sound card or an external syn@@ thesizer because the sound quality depends essentially on your sound card . it is not the same if you use a FM radio or a AW@@ E card .
&quot; if you don &apos;t have a sound card , you need to compile &amp; k@@ mid ; compile with the MO@@ DE _ DE@@ MO _ ON@@ LY@@ VIS@@ U@@ AL parameter , except that you could not listen to music . &quot;
&quot; if problems occur , contact one of the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ mailing lists or send an error message directly to me . &quot;
&quot; the program is used to play video files supported by M@@ Player or Ph@@ on@@ on supported formats , as well as playback DVD s , VCD s or TV and camera . &quot;
the documentation for &amp; k@@ app@@ name ; was not finished yet than &amp; k@@ de ; installed on this computer .
&quot; for additional help please check the page The K@@ DE website on new versions , or send the question to The &amp; k@@ de ; User Mail@@ ing list . &quot;
&quot; the application window is made of so @-@ called and@@ shock@@ able windows . there is always the window with the central view . optionally , there is a window with the playlist . and finally there is an information window that is only displayed when information is displayed in it . &quot;
&quot; it is possible to save the preferred connections under the menu book@@ marks , but these are single entries . if you want to create a list of entries that are played after each other , you should use the category Perman@@ ent playlist . &quot;
&quot; of course , you can add groups to groups to receive an additional hierarchy level . if you keep an entry , its group and all its sub@@ groups will be copied to the current category and playback begins with the attached entry . &quot;
&quot; the various files in the directory ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / KM@@ Player / , can be changed by using an editor , but also by application itself . just click on a name of a category click on it from the View menu and as next editing mode . by clicking a sub@@ group , only the XML content of this part is displayed . &quot;
&quot; after modi@@ fying XML files , a playlist must be selected from the menu and select either the editing mode , or select another category . &quot;
all changes are lost when the editing mode left or another group will be selected without equal to the playlist .
&quot; as a result of the author &apos;s convenience , some functions can only be enabled by changing the XML configuration files . &quot;
&quot; the animation in starting and ending can be de@@ activated by editing ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / km@@ Play@@ err@@ c and modi@@ fying &#91; General Options &#93; No in@@ tro = 0 above option to &apos; 1 &apos; . if the option is not present , it can be easily inserted . &quot;
it is also possible to activate another animation . &amp; KM@@ Player ; will notice the files ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / KM@@ Player / intro@@ .@@ x@@ ml and ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / KM@@ Player / ex@@ it@@ .@@ x@@ ml . the format must be a supported XML file .
&quot; the animation during startup doesn &apos;t need to be short , it is automatically terminated by opening another source . this would be anno@@ ying at the end animation , the user can therefore end the application a second time . &quot;
&quot; a simple example of a start animation can be the ad of a favorite photos : &amp; lt ; sm@@ il@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / sm@@ il@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / sm@@ il@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / sm@@ il@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / sm@@ il@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / sm@@ il@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / sm@@ il@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / sm@@ il@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / sm@@ il@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / sm@@ il@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / sm@@ il@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / sm@@ il@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / sm@@ il@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / sm@@ il@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / sm@@ il@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / sm@@ il@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / sm@@ il@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / sm@@ il@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / sm@@ il@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / sm@@ il@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / sm@@ il@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / sm@@ il@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / sm@@ il@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / sm@@ il@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / sm@@ il@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / sm@@ il@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / sm@@ il@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / sm@@ il@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / sm@@ il@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / sm@@ il@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / sm@@ il@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / sm@@ il@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / sm@@ il@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / sm@@ il@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / sm@@ il@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / sm@@ il@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / sm@@ il@@ gt ;
there is a tab for the configuration of M@@ Player in the configuration dialog of &amp; KM@@ Player ; . here you can set the path from the M@@ Player and the clip@@ board size of the data stream from the network and other things .
&quot; another tool for troubleshooting is the button &apos; console &apos; in the toolbar of KM@@ Player . here , the output of m@@ player is visible . &quot;
&quot; there is no rider for this playlist in the config dialog of &amp; KM@@ Player ; everything must be configured by manual editing of the file ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / km@@ Play@@ err@@ c , just like setting the back@@ end per mim@@ et@@ ype . here &apos;s an example like a flash &apos; with the sw@@ f@@ dec @-@ mo@@ z@@ illa module : &quot;
&apos;@@ Flash &apos; can be played within &amp; KM@@ Player ; it can even embed the special field embed for YouTube in the playlist XML .
&quot; thus the &amp; KM@@ Player ; &apos; flash &apos; can be played in HTML pages , the &amp; KM@@ Player ; module as service provider for the M@@ ime type application / x @-@ shock@@ wave flash is specified in the Setup dialog file Zu@@ ordin@@ ances of K@@ DE . &quot;
&quot; the Kon@@ quer@@ or or &amp; KM@@ Player ; is to run in a con@@ soles application and search for error messages regarding loading the browser module library . if there are no errors here , the back@@ end output within &amp; KM@@ Player ; ( view , console , or console from the context menu ) . &quot;
&quot; thus always a given back@@ end for a certain M@@ ime type is taken ( of course only if this has been determined ) , this must be done by manual changing of the file ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / km@@ Play@@ err@@ c . for example , Ph@@ on@@ on should play all og@@ g files : &quot;

&quot; for configur@@ ing the V@@ DR ( Video Data Recorder ) settings in the KM@@ Player , the dialog in the settings under - &gt; Qu@@ el@@ le- &gt; V@@ DR@@ - &gt; X@@ Video Port must be detected ( e.g. it is PAL for West Europe ) , the correct name probably has a DV@@ B in it . &quot;
&quot; since the V@@ DR support for S@@ ME can only use X@@ Video , X@@ Video is also supported ( probably this type of playback of video devices under Linux is the only one that works ) . for the X@@ Free@@ 86 server , this must be included in its configuration file ( / etc / X@@ 11 / XF@@ 86@@ Con@@ fig ) &quot;

Q@@ T ; : &amp; Q@@ t ; is a library for C + + for creating graphical user interfaces and network support and is required to compile &amp; k@@ ile ;
Lat@@ ex ; : a professional writing application . under Unix @-@ like systems will probably be res@@ or@@ ted to the package &amp; tex@@ live ; or &amp; tet@@ ex ; ( for older systems ) .
most of these components can be included in the used &amp; Linux distribution . for installation the documentation of the distribution or installation CD ; / DVD should be drawn .
the &amp; k@@ ile ; project includes some already compiled packages of &amp; k@@ ile ; for various distri@@ butions . these allow easy installation without further comp@@ iling and are contained in the k@@ ile ; website .
&quot; this manual is for everyone - regardless of the experience with &amp; latex ; , &amp; k@@ de ; , &amp; k@@ ile ; or &amp; Linux ; . &quot;
&quot; advanced users must hardly read this manual . however , all proposals for documentation are taken into account . if the support for this project or its documentation is desired , the contact should be made via the tile ; website . &quot;
&quot; if you have questions about or when comp@@ iling &amp; k@@ ile ; on or if extensions desired , this should be addressed to the mailing list k@@ ile @-@ de@@ vel @ list@@ s.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ ile ; is an integrated &amp; latex ; -@@ environment for the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ working area . &amp; k@@ ile ; offers the possibility to use all &amp; latex ; functions in a graphical interface and within this a simple , immediate and tailor @-@ made access to all &amp; latex ; programs . finally , the easy to use assistant , the &amp; latex ; reference and the powerful project management . &quot;
&quot; to learn more about &amp; understand ; and its possibilities to experience , the manual should be drawn up to Kate . users of &amp; k@@ ile ; can start there directly with reading the chapter working with the editor of &amp; works ; begin . &quot;
&quot; for latex ; is the correct selection : L@@ ay @-@ TECH . choose the original &amp; tex ; difficult to use , can also use a La@@ ity ( engl@@ . lay ) &amp; latex ; -@@ mac@@ ros . a less demanding but more realistic explanation is that it desc@@ ends from the sur@@ name of Les@@ lie La m@@ port . &quot;
&quot; while here is only a good Ã ¤ n@@ esday to &amp; latex ; given , it is not the ultimate book about it . for example H. Kop@@ ka / P. W. D@@ aly , A Guide to &amp; latex ; : document Prepar@@ ation for Beg@@ inners and Advanced Users , 3rd Edition , 1999 d@@ af@@ Ã ¼ r . &quot;
&quot; the introduction contains at least the command \ \ document@@ class , the Cologne starts with the command \ \ begin { document } and must be closed with the command \ \ begin { document } and must be closed with the command \ \ end { document } . &quot;
the fast @-@ entry wizard from &amp; k@@ ile ; is a useful feature for fast creation of a document in &amp; k@@ ile ; . the selection of the wizard ( menu ) offers some possibilities for the creation of the document .
&quot; document classes : hereby the type of document to be created : article ( article ) , book &#91; book &#93; , report &#91; letter &#93; , article ( DIN ) &#91; scr@@ art@@ cl &#93; , book ( DIN ) &#91; scr@@ art@@ cl &#93; , projector &#91; projector &#93; , slides &#91; Prosp@@ er &#93; , or custom @-@ defined . &quot;
&quot; coding : hereby the string encoding is set . modern systems are increasingly using UT@@ F @-@ 8 encoding as standard . at best , UT@@ F @-@ 8@@ X should be used ( for correct processing of &amp; latex ; documents ) . &quot;
&quot; this list contains the most commonly used add @-@ on packages for &amp; latex ; for the integration , they only have to be selected in the check box . &quot;
&quot; article ( DIN ) , book ( DIN ) , report ( DIN ) , letter ( DIN ) : the documentation classes of KO@@ MA @-@ Script ( to comply with German DIN regulations ) . &quot;
new users are not worried anymore . it is merely a brief description of the functions and further information about this will be given in the section .
&quot; &amp; k@@ ile ; provides - just like other source editors - the high@@ lighting of the commands , settings and elements ( as well as the un@@ suitable ) . by &amp; k@@ ile ; it is likely that any mathematical environment is not closed . however , it is possible to save you through the modest appearance of the output file . however , it will save you by high@@ lighting time and us@@ ur@@ ger . &quot;
&quot; the automatic ampli@@ fication of the environments is generated when entering a new command ( e.g. \ \ begin { command } ) by &amp; k@@ ile ; automatically generates a blank line ( for the input of the text ) , and the corresponding line to the layout of the command ( e.g. \ \ end { command } ) . &quot;
all documents are usually sub@@ divided into some elements . &amp; latex ; allows the divi@@ ding of the document into the following elements ( part is the highest and sub@@ paragraph the lowest item ) :
&quot; in view of the document in the structure view , the individual elements can be changed and viewed by a single mouse click . &quot;
&quot; when creating your own &amp; latex ; -@@ files can be very helpful for backup . once a DVI ; file has been created , jumps &amp; k@@ ile ; by clicking with the middle mouse button in the DVI ; viewer to the appropriate line in &amp; latex ; source code . &quot;
&quot; a DVI ; file contains a description of the format@@ ted document and also other information like the font and is next to PDF the available output of &amp; tex ; or &amp; latex ; . there are many tools for view , conversion and printing of DVI ; files for various systems and devices . &quot;
&quot; when using the backup search , the elements of the DVI ; file have been cli@@ cked with the editor , and as soon as an item in the DVI ; file was cli@@ cked ; the default search is the exact opposite of it . as soon as a section in &amp; latex ; source text is cli@@ cked , the corresponding point will be saved in the DVI ; viewer . &quot;
master document : this feature is used when working with multiple files . with a master document the work with other included .@@ tex files is simplified . when using a project a project @-@ wide master document can be set over project project settings .
quick construction : the &amp; latex ; source text is compiled and the result is automatically displayed ( if there are no errors in the source code ) .
&quot; surveillance : in this mode , the DVI ; file is used on the us@@ u@@ â ¬ â ¬ â ¬ â ¬ â ¬ ter@@ â ¬ â ¬ - and there is no call from &amp; Ok@@ ular ; after the fast construction . &quot;
&quot; when viewing the Edit tool bar , the three large selection fields should be noticeable . the selection fields were developed for rapid integration of the document into parts , chapters , sections , ... The ver@@ itable &amp; latex ; -@@ commands for sub@@ division are : &quot;
&quot; the drop @-@ down sel@@ ector is available for displaying articles , such as keywords , fusion no@@ des , or references . &quot;
&quot; description : with this command , a designation for a section , a picture or other element is created . &quot;
reference : is used for reference to a specified term ( choose a selection field ) .
&quot; when using c@@ itation , a selection list with literary entries is displayed . for the editing of &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; files are necessary only if the file is accessible to a project . the author has good experiences with &amp; k@@ bi@@ b@@ tex ; and &amp; k@@ bi@@ b ; . the &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; files can also be written in &amp; k@@ ile ; by hand . &quot;
&quot; the last drop @-@ down box with the name Gr@@ Ã ¶ Ã ¤ e is used for the definition of the written size . it can be set the written letters for the main text , the fusion no@@ des , etc . &quot;
&quot; when calling &amp; k@@ ile , two choices are available : 1 . the wizard for creating a new document by selecting the document type and setting up the settings . 2 . the document can be written down with the hand . &quot;
&quot; the brackets after the command \ \ document@@ class contain the settings for the command . the setting &#91; 12@@ pt &#93; determines the written record . if the written record is not set at the beginning , this can also be done in the text . &quot;
&quot; once the above source text sample has to be entered , the &amp; latex ; source code must be compiled . the easiest way to do this is to use the menu build or the button of rapid construction . &quot;
the source code must be stored before comp@@ iling . &amp; k@@ ile ; for saving the storage automatically .
&quot; if the comp@@ iling of the document is missing , the logs should be searched for errors . when using fast construction should be started &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; if this is not the case , the logging should also be observed . &quot;
&quot; an environment ( engl@@ . environment ) is a text that will be treated differently from the rest of the document . for example , a report with the written record is created and only a few columns should have a different written size . &quot;
the changes are covered only within the environment ( from \ \ begin { environment } to \ \ end { environment } ) . there is no limit ( number ) for changes within a environment .
&quot; there are many possibilities to increase the read@@ ability and ease of use of the document . for example , certain types of fonts , grease pressure , passive pressure , sub@@ missions , etc. can be added . these commands send either with the command \ \ end or automatically at the end of the environment . &quot;
\ \ begin { emp@@ h } : this command is for the intensive pressure and is closed until it is closed with a \ \ end { stamp } or another environment . a single word in one proposition can be displayed in a phrase using \ \ emp@@ h { word } .
\ \ quote : creates a quote in the document . the quote begins with \ \ begin { ratio } and ends with \ \ end { ratio } .
&quot; after the background for writing the source text with the &amp; latex ; drawing language is displayed , a step @-@ by @-@ step guide for creating a document in &amp; k@@ ile ; . &quot;
&quot; once in the wizard a bit of text was entered , a few adjustments for the better read@@ ability of the document should be completed . &quot;
&quot; once the document has been viewed , the editor @-@ view or Ctr@@ l E can be returned to the editor ( internal viewer ) . &quot;
&quot; once the DVI ( file has been created , the document can be printed out or converted to a &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF file . simply try out and have fun . &quot;
&quot; DVI ; is an independent file format ( D e V ice I n@@ dependent ) . these files are created by &amp; tex ; or &amp; latex ; for the read@@ ability of some drivers of the computer , there are many different types of .@@ d@@ vi outputs such as printer , &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF converter or computer screens . &quot;
&quot; for the printing of a &amp; DVI ; file is the same steps as for the creation of the document ( see ) . at the 7th step - after clicking on DVI , the document can then be printed out by file ( in the viewer ) ( if the printer is set correctly ) . &quot;
&quot; the tool@@ bars allow the transformation of the DVI ; file to other formats . once the DVI ; file from the &amp; latex ; source code was created , the conversion can begin into known other formats using the button in the toolbar . &quot;
the search option allows the direct jump from the editor to the corresponding position inside the DVI ; file .
&amp; k@@ ile ; offers a corresponding setting for all &amp; latex ; bin@@ aries . this only needs to set up Modern under Settings C@@ ile ... Tools Construction is selected .
&quot; to exclude the search , the cursor must be positioned in a line of the source text and cli@@ cked on pre @-@ search . the jump to the appropriate place in the DVI ; viewer then takes place . &quot;
with this function in &amp; Ok@@ ular ; with a click of the middle mouse button in the DVI ; document the corresponding &amp; latex ; -@@ document from &amp; k@@ ile ; open and jump to the corresponding line . to do this need to set &amp; k@@ ile ; in &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; set as text editor ( setup ey@@ epi@@ ece ... editor )
&quot; should errors occur during the use of fast construction of the &amp; DVI ; if an error occurs , this is indicated in the logging file or in the message window . &quot;
the logging file reco@@ vers the error source in the source code . in the editor you can click on the error in the bug . in order to view the error in error it must be cli@@ cked to the error in logging and &amp; k@@ ile ; jumps to the faul@@ ty line .
&quot; when cli@@ cked on the corresponding button in the toolbar , a window appears to select the template to be used for the document . the pres@@ et possibilities are : &quot;
&quot; in the selection of empty document , a document can be written either from scratch or the wizard for fast creation of a new document . further information can be found in the section . &quot;
&quot; common users of &amp; latex ; usually use the same introduction for almost all documents . templates can be created , saved and loaded to facilitate the creation of a new document . &quot;
&quot; to create a new template , either an existing &amp; tex ; - / latex ; file must be opened or created a new file . &quot;
&quot; when creating a new document from a template using a file New , some strings are replaced by other data ( e.g. name or string coding ) . these variables can set up settings in settings tile ... &quot;
&quot; when creating your own template , it is necessary to know which strings are replaced by which variables : &quot;
$ $ DO@@ CU@@ MEN@@ TC@@ LA@@ S@@ SO@@ P@@ TION@@ S $ $ : this string is sub@@ stituted by entering document class . typically it is used as follows : \ \ document@@ class &#91; $ $ DO@@ CU@@ MEN@@ TC@@ LA@@ S@@ SO@@ P@@ TION@@ S $ $ &#93; { article } .
the simpl@@ est way to create a template is the use of the wizard and the associated entry of commands in the editor . once the document has been created in this way :
&quot; when creating a new document , your own template can then be selected instead of the standard ones . &quot;
a template can be created from any &amp; latex ; files are created . a simple way to create a template should be searched for one on the Internet and searched under the steps described below .
&amp; to@@ ile ; used &amp; lic@@ ences ; as an internal editor . &amp; therefore ; is a text editor for programm@@ ers with the possibility of reading and choosing from many different types of text files ( including also &amp; latex ; and &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; ) . many settings for &amp; are therefore made directly from &amp; k@@ ile ; out .
&quot; to learn more about it ; and to experience its possibilities , the manual should be drawn up to Kate . users of &amp; k@@ ile ; can directly start reading the chapter working with the editor of &amp; are therefore . &quot;
&amp; k@@ ile ; offers a very practical &amp; latex ; command reference which can be accessed via the La@@ Te@@ X reference menu . it contains a detailed description of almost all commands that can be found in &amp; latex ; use and their syntax .
double @-@ click with a pressed Ctr@@ l key to select the &amp; tex ; this means that in this way you click \ \ par \ \ big@@ ski@@ p \ \ par \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \
&quot; when drag@@ ging the text with pressed left mouse button , the selected text is automatically copied to the clip@@ board . &quot;
&quot; when using the arrow keys with twi@@ sted Shift , parts of the source text can be selected in the editor window . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ ile ; has the possibility to browse the various types of source tex@@ tures and highlight them . for example , the &amp; latex ; -@@ commands of normal text and also mathematical formul@@ as are highlighted by another color . &quot;
&quot; many assist@@ ants can enter additional jump mark@@ ers . this is an own kind of book@@ marks inside the text . the menu items are highlighted within the text . the menu items are highlighted , so that they are automatically deleted when entering a character . &quot;
&quot; editing is probably one of the main aspects when using a program such as &amp; k@@ ile ; . although &amp; works ; already excellent possibilities , have been added in &amp; k@@ ile ; special commands for their selection . under Edit items , the following commands are included in the text selection : &quot;
&quot; this extended meaning also includes tables , &amp; latex ; commands and all other lines of the source text . the only explo@@ iting thing in &amp; k@@ ile ; is thus that the wast@@ es are separated by two blank lines . &quot;
select the word under the current cursor position . this selection also has an extended meaning since this command also contains &amp; latex ; commands with a return line ( \ \ ) and an additional star ( * ) at the end .
&quot; for the removal of a part of the document , it is possible to remove this first and remove by pressing the Del@@ ete key . &amp; to@@ ile ; offers the short@@ cut Ctr@@ l ; K with which the entire row is removed . &quot;
remove a complete paragraph . the definition for a paragraph in &amp; k@@ ile ; is included in the description to edit paragraph .
it has already been clari@@ fied that environments play a central role in &amp; latex ; play . that &apos;s why it offers &amp; k@@ ile ; for further orders under editing environment for easy work with &amp; latex ; .
this command will jump to the beginning of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cursor is placed directly in front of the command to open the environment .
this command will jump to the end of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cursor is placed directly behind the command to the setting of the environment .
&quot; if the cursor is located before or within the \ \ begin { area } command , then jump to the end of the environment ( or vice versa ) . &quot;
&quot; when entering many ne@@ sted environment commands , the over@@ sight may be lost quickly . this command closes the last modified environment so that the ne@@ sted environment structure is not destroyed . &quot;
&amp; k@@ ile ; also offers special commands for the &amp; latex ; -@@ groups which are determined by brackets { ... } . under Edit Te@@ X group are some important commands that comply with the editing environment .
this command will jump to the beginning of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cursor is placed right in front of the cur@@ sing bracket .
this command will jump to the end of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cursor is placed directly behind the soft closing bracket .
&quot; if the cursor is in front of or behind the cur@@ sed clas@@ p of a &amp; tex ; -@@ group # , will jump to the other end of the group ( or vice versa ) . &quot;
&quot; during the input of many welded group cl@@ amps it is possible to quickly lose sight over the over@@ sight . this command was the last modified group , so that the ne@@ sted structure of the &amp; tex ; -@@ groups are not destroyed . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; latex ; two simple quotes are used as a substitute . for the purpose to use it is used in &amp; k@@ ile ; the sign &quot; for two simple quotes is used . also for the end of the application , the sign is used . &quot;
this automatic entry of double quotes can set up in settings tile ... La@@ Te@@ X can be switched on and off .
&quot; it can also be used to use specific settings ( e.g. n@@ german or french ) , so that German or French suits are also used . there are also many other languages available . &quot;
&quot; if the current position is located within a list environment ( such as en@@ umer@@ ate or it@@ em@@ ize ) , the current position is located within a list environment ( such as en@@ umer@@ ate or it@@ em@@ ize ) , not only a line break but also the command \ \ item . &quot;
&quot; within a table area , the current line with \ \ \ \ ends with an end @-@ end line break . &quot;
even better - &amp; k@@ ile ; is intelligent enough to support pre @-@ set &amp; latex ; - or custom environments . these can be hidden under settings ... La@@ Te@@ X is added .
&quot; some users want to classi@@ fy the columns in tables environments and thereby all E@@ t characters ( amp ; ) to match each other . while pressing Shift ; Alt ; amp ; searches &amp; k@@ ile ; after the next tab in the next line . &quot;
&quot; although &amp; lic@@ ences ; already a good source code promise has been added , this in &amp; k@@ ile ; for special orders ( mostly for latex ; ) are added . all these modes can be set for automatic processing . &quot;
&quot; when starting a new environment by means of the command \ \ begin { environment } , &amp; k@@ ile ; automatically add the command \ \ end { surrounding } after an empty line ( for the text ) . &quot;
&quot; when pressing the back button , the last character of the input will be removed , and thus the list can be enlarged . on the other hand , the list can also be smaller by entering another letter . &quot;
&quot; all commands are written with a short description of their parameters . alternatively , the descriptions are available in the selection of a command . alternatively , an easy jump to these positions is possible by editing the N@@ Ã ¤ n@@ ste Spr@@ ung@@ brand and the desired parameters can be recovered . &quot;
&quot; settings k@@ ile ; set up ... k@@ ile ; you can make various settings for these lists . you can choose various exec@@ ut@@ ters for &amp; tex ; - and &amp; latex ; -@@ commands , as well as wi@@ gs of the general language use . &quot;
&quot; command mode is not useful for the use of environments . there are always a few letters with \ \ begin entered and the call for the default mode will be used as often , that &amp; k@@ ile ; a special mode for understanding the environments . &quot;
&quot; when calling the extended environment or the key Alt + Shift key , the command for the setting of the environment is automatically included and it appears \ \ begin { . afterwards , the environment can be continued in the simpl@@ est way and will be terminated by pressing the input key . &quot;
&quot; once this is done , the environment will be closed automatically . once &amp; k@@ ile ; det@@ ects that it is a list environment , it is even a first \ \ item command . &quot;
&quot; settings k@@ ile ; setup ... k@@ ile ; you can perform settings on these lists . this mode uses the watch@@ list of the completion mode for &amp; tex ; - and &amp; latex ; -@@ commands . &quot;
&quot; the lists can be set up under Settings C@@ ile . the lists can be set up under Settings C@@ ile . for example , the file ex@@ amp@@ le@@ .c@@ w@@ l , for example , contains the file ex@@ amp@@ le@@ .c@@ w@@ l , in which the item L = \ \ La@@ Te@@ X is included . &quot;
&quot; for example , if the character L entered and the word is introduced to the Edit command or the short@@ cut Ctr@@ l + Alt empty button , the character L will be replaced by the string \ \ La@@ Te@@ X . &quot;
&quot; large wi@@ per holes are not helpful for automatic renewal . however , it has been noted that many wishes in a document are written more than once . thus , &amp; k@@ ile ; the complete satisfaction for all already written documentation . &quot;
&quot; this mode can be set up in the settings tile ... tile , fully shiel@@ ded . here , the threshold for the display of the completion can be specified here . &quot;
&quot; the comprehen@@ sible files can be installed in the sub@@ folder ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / k@@ ile / complete / mode / the Persian home folder . mode is for Ab@@ brevi@@ ation , Dictionary ( dictionary ) or tex . &quot;
the graphics capture shapes the inser@@ tion of graphics as easy as possible . to the over@@ sight of the basics to the graphic formats the sections should be followed .
&quot; PS files are not as known as PDF files , but offer an excellent basis for changes and re@@ visions of pages . if the PDF output is used , the pages can be re@@ arranged with a few &amp; Post@@ Script ; tools and then converted to a PDF file with ps@@ 2@@ pdf . &quot;
&quot; in order to be able to pay attention to the result of the work , the source code must be compiled . all construction tools are group@@ ed together in the menu create comp@@ iling , creating converting and creating view . &quot;
&quot; for comp@@ iling the source text for viewer such as &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; or the other transformation can be used by using Alt ; 3 , using Alt ; 4 the DVI ; file can be converted to a PS file and by Alt ; 5 the PS file . &quot;
&quot; when using the command fast construction , a viewer is usually called after comp@@ iling . if no built @-@ in viewer should be used , each time a new window will open . &quot;
a new project is about the project New Project .... By this the following information is requested for the project :
&quot; when selecting the filename window , the relative path must be specified by the .@@ kil@@ ep@@ r project file . &quot;
the script function of &amp; k@@ ile ; allows the script to run by EC@@ MA@@ Script code . the scripts can be managed across scripts in the vertical bar .
the API scripts are not yet fully developed and can be used in other versions of &amp; k@@ ile ; or else .
first it must be said that the execution environment of the scripts in &amp; k@@ ile ; a system @-@ wide object ( = k@@ ile ) with the following methods :
&quot; &amp; latex ; is a quite sophisticated system , in which the basic functions can be expanded by a variety of additional packages . &amp; k@@ ile ; offers a lot of different aids for the support of users . &quot;
&amp; tet@@ ex ; and &amp; tex@@ live ; delivered with many documents . there is a documentation for the contained packages and another &amp; latex ; reference .
&quot; a complete Ref@@ ern@@ z for &amp; tex ; and its us@@ â us@@ â ¬ ees , but rather a complete instruction manual for the &amp; latex ; -@@ commands are included and is thus ideal for searching for a specific format@@ ting . since it is a very large document , it is divided into &amp; k@@ ile ; in three important book@@ marks . &quot;
&quot; because of the amount of documents with those &amp; tet@@ ex ; / tex@@ live ; delivered , finding the right document is not always easy . &quot;
&quot; all documents are divided into categories and the biggest advantage is the search for pack@@ et names or keywords . by &amp; k@@ ile , only the results will be displayed . &quot;

&amp; s@@ sig ; is a graphic editor to manage many different sig@@ natures for e @-@ mails . with the command line interface you create random sig@@ natures or daily sig@@ natures from a list . this command line interface provides the sig@@ natures for external e @-@ mail programs such as &amp; k@@ mail ; .
&quot; for random sig@@ natures , an arbitr@@ ary signature from the sig@@ natures file is read from &amp; k@@ sig ; through many sig@@ natures with different quot@@ ations , styles and information you can make your e @-@ mails varied and unique . &quot;
&quot; for day sig@@ natures , the same signature is read from the sig@@ natures file for the whole day . for each day you use different sig@@ natures , as with the random sig@@ natures , create unique e @-@ mails . &quot;
&quot; to create a new signature , select Ctr@@ l ; N file New . this gives you a lt ; empty signature ; in the sig@@ natures section . &quot;
&quot; you can create as many sig@@ natures . then you have a list of sig@@ natures for e @-@ mail programs such as &amp; k@@ mail ; . if you use e @-@ mails at home or professionally , there are always plenty of sig@@ natures . &quot;
&quot; to delete a signature , select it first and then remove the File menu or click the icon with the red cross removal in the toolbar . &quot;
&quot; here you can select short commands for menu items . in order to change a short@@ cut , select an action from the list . click the User &apos;s button on the right side and enter the new command line by pressing the button or key combination . &quot;
&quot; to use &amp; k@@ sig ; is &amp; k@@ de ; 3.5 required . to attach sig@@ natures to your emails , you need a program like &amp; k@@ mail ; or another program that can insert the sig@@ natures from the output of a command . &quot;

&quot; version 3.2 of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; contains many new &amp; XML ; tools and functions . these tools are unique in their integration in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; all these tools use Kom@@ mander as surface and lib@@ x@@ ml@@ 2 and lib@@ x@@ s@@ lt as a base layer . the combination results in fast , efficient , complete and productive tools . &quot;
&quot; everyone who has worked with the &amp; k@@ de ; documentation has worked , pro@@ c and how outstanding it is . let &apos;s lift it a piece , we give it a graphical surface ! no more rely on a terminal ; simply cli@@ cked the icon for the XML processor and finished ! &quot;
&quot; this application expects an index@@ .@@ doc@@ book in the folder . if index@@ .@@ doc@@ book is in the shared folder , then leave the current working folder . if not , then remove the selection of current working folders and enter the desired folder in the field of other folders . &quot;
output files are stored in the same folder as the source files . all previous &amp; HTML files are deleted every time you started pro@@ c .
&quot; as already said , everyone who has worked on the &amp; k@@ de ; documentation has already worked , knows how helpful this application is . and with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us , there is now a great graphical surface for it . &quot;
&quot; if the currently open file index@@ .@@ doc@@ book is , then simply select the current working folder . if not , then select the current folder and enter the folder where index@@ .@@ doc@@ book is to be found . &quot;
&quot; when it comes to an output on the screen , its file is flaw@@ ed . please check the reported error and try again . &quot;

&quot; for use of a &amp; DT@@ D ; specified in the &amp; XML ; file , select &amp; DT@@ D ; ( External ) , otherwise &amp; DT@@ D ; ( External ) and specify the location of the &amp; DT@@ D ; ( External ) and specify the location of the &amp; DT@@ D ; ( External ) and specify the definition URI ; in file selection . &quot;
&quot; yes , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; also has a &amp; X@@ SL processing tool ! this uses the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c tool from lib@@ x@@ ml@@ 2 library . &quot;
&quot; should the file to be processed in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; already marked , then they can be selected simply . if not , remove the selected file and select the file to be processed using the other file selection . &quot;
&quot; enter the name of the file , as the result should be named , and the file is usually stored in your home folder . &quot;
&quot; the plug @-@ ins , the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; may have little to do with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the plug @-@ in system will immediately benefit and do not have to wait until someone uses the f@@ ake in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the plug @-@ ins can be used in a large number of &amp; GUI ; elements . &quot;
&quot; to install a plugin or a part , we start with the Edit menu . this will open the following dialog : &quot;
this dialog allows to manage all the plugins contained and add new ones . we describe each &amp; GUI ; element in it :
here you can enter the search path . when adding plugins without a location used &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; this path to search for the plug @-@ in .
often work on a project several persons in a sort of hierarch@@ ical relationship to each other . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; supports the specification of team members and they can be configured with Shift ; F@@ 7 Project Project Properties dialog .
the name and email entries are self @-@ explan@@ atory . Nick@@ name is the nick@@ name of the user and is used for un@@ ambig@@ uous identification .
&quot; a member can have multiple roles in the project , such as team leaders as well as sub@@ project leaders . &quot;
the user can search for himself from the list of team members who he is . this happens by looking out the team member from the list and pressing the S@@ etze button . the currently selected member ( their identity ) appears bold after you are : text .
nick@@ names and attitudes of your own identity are important in terms of news and comments . see for further information on remarks .
&quot; in addition to an overview of your team , there is another advantage by collecting the members of the team : it can be an event for information on the team leaders when something specific happens . see for further information . &quot;
&quot; event actions are actions that are executed when something specific happens in the project . an example would be the recording of the opening and closing of the project , so that later a file is saved or a script that plays a file into CVS as soon as it is added to the project &amp; etc ; &quot;
&quot; on page Event configuration of the Shift ; F@@ 7 Project Project Settings dialog , events can be created , edited and deleted . &quot;
an email will be sent to the addres@@ see selected in the recipient list . the addres@@ see can be a team or sub@@ project manager .
notes are special comments in the documents . they differ from ordinary comments by the following things :
you can either select the ann@@ ot@@ ation entry from the editor context menu or enter the @ ann@@ ot@@ ation keyword in a comment area followed by comment text .
&quot; notes can be sent to a specific member of the team . in this case , the syntax @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( nick@@ name ) or @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( role ) , where nick@@ name of the team member , sub@@ project leader , should be given the respective area or sub@@ project names , as in the following examples below . &quot;
nick@@ names and roles names are independent of upper@@ case or lo@@ wer@@ case but spaces around the brackets and the : make the note invalid .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is a development environment for scrip@@ ting and format@@ ting languages supported by DT@@ D agnos@@ tic and supports web @-@ based format@@ ting and scrip@@ ting languages .
&quot; the settings are accessible via the Settings menu . here , only above &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ specific settings are treated , a short description for the other can be found in . &quot;
the settings can be set up by means of settings Qu@@ anta . this dialog covers some pages that are treated with one another .
&quot; the behavior of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; regarding tags , including car completion , can be changed . the entries are : &quot;
&quot; upper@@ case of tags : large / lo@@ wer@@ case of automatically inserted tags . normal large / lo@@ wer@@ case means , the tags are inserted as described in tag@@ XML files . &quot;
&quot; large / de@@ preci@@ ation of attributes : large / de@@ preci@@ ation of automatically inserted attributes . normal bulk / lo@@ wer@@ case means , the attributes are inserted as described in tag@@ XML files . &quot;
&quot; optional tags automatically close : if attached , for tags , for which the closing tag is optional , this immediately after &amp; gt ; inserted . &quot;
not include optional tags : as above for all other tags except for simple tags .
&quot; automatically update Start@@ - and Off @-@ Tag : if enabled , the corresponding closing tag will be changed and vice versa . &quot;
automatic setting of acc@@ ent characters : controls the automatic conversion of acc@@ entu@@ ated characters into the corresponding coding during entry .
MI@@ ME types : mim@@ et@@ yp@@ es to detect different types of files . by using the Standard button the default preferences can be restored .
default character encoding : encoding of newly created or otherwise file @-@ opened files ( where encoding of the file can be over@@ c@@ locked ) . this setting here will be ej@@ ected by the same in the project properties if a project is loaded .
&quot; default DT@@ D : the selected DT@@ D is used for newly created files , or for files whose DT@@ D is not recognized . this setting here will be ej@@ ected by the same in the project properties if a project is loaded . &quot;
&quot; create a backup copy : &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; regularly creates backup copies , so that in case of a power failure or crash during the next start of the program the document can be recovered from this backup . &quot;
&quot; the preview and documentation can be viewed either in the editing pane or in your own view ( or the documentation in a card driver ) , which makes it possible to preview the documentation , preview and the source text at the same time . &quot;
set the default window settings for the next start is useful when the user interface has changed by modi@@ fying the M@@ DI modes and and@@ o@@ cks / dependen@@ cies of views on each other . it corresponds to the --@@ res@@ et@@ Layout command line parameters .
the warning message area serves to control the possibility to disable the display of war@@ nings by h@@ acks of non @-@ inqu@@ ire .
&quot; the place to change the behavior of &amp; V@@ PL ; to change the display of symbols instead of scripts , as well as the synchron@@ ization behavior of the V@@ PL@@ - and the source text view in shared mode . &quot;
&quot; here , the par@@ ser and the structure tree , representing the figure of the par@@ ser node in the document , can be set in details . &quot;
&quot; in the mou@@ sec@@ lick on the structure tree , the following action is possible to change the action solved by clicking the structure tree . &quot;
&quot; in the structure tree settings the visibility of no@@ des in the tree can be shut down automatically when editing and how deep in a change in the structure tree , empty lines are empty spaces in the text , while empty groups are those in which no element has been found in the current document . &quot;
&quot; abbrevi@@ ations are in groups , each one can be un@@ folded for multiple &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s . abbrevi@@ ations are in groups , each can be valid for multiple &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s . this means there can be a valid group for PHP in which the if@@ clause abbrevi@@ ation means something different than in a group valid for Javascript . &quot;
&quot; plugins are K@@ Part applications from third page , which can be re@@ used by any K@@ Part @-@ capable application , the most known &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; . when inser@@ ting a plug @-@ in , the following must be specified : &quot;
address : the path to the plugin if it is not located at a default location like $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / lib .
&quot; input : this information is passed to the plugin when starting , so it can open the current file , the associated folder ( path of the current file ) or the project folder . &quot;
&quot; load the component in the &quot; &quot; read @-@ only &quot; &quot; mode : check if the plugin ref@@ uses to load the load . only @-@ L@@ ese @-@ K@@ Parts usually refuse to load when this option is not selected . &quot;
&quot; check the plug @-@ in : if this is enabled , then test &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; if the specified information is correct . then select the saving of the entry even if the plugin is not available at the moment , but it should be installed later . &quot;
&quot; for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; from version 3.3 , troubleshooting was completely new . the support for the built @-@ in &amp; PHP ; ( 3 ) Deb@@ ug@@ ger has been set , as well as the support for the D@@ BG de@@ bu@@ gger . instead , a de@@ bu@@ gger plugin concept has been implemented , which allows various implem@@ ent@@ ations via plug @-@ ins . &quot;
currently only a plugin is available that adds support to the use of &amp; gu@@ bed ; inqu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ;
the use of the de@@ bu@@ gger for a project starts with selecting a suitable de@@ bu@@ gger plug @-@ in in the project settings . using the Options button next to the Deb@@ ug@@ ger plug @-@ in box the specific settings can be changed .
&quot; if a de@@ bu@@ gger is enabled for a project , some additional elements appear in the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; UI : &quot;
a view where the contents of monitored variables are displayed . usually appears in the left dock .
&quot; a view where all holding points are listed , with line numbers and conditions . usually appears in the lower dock . &quot;
a view in which the output ( as shown in HTML ) of the de@@ bu@@ gger . usually appears in the lower dock .
&quot; depending on the supported functions of the de@@ bu@@ gger , everything or part of the following functionality is available . &quot;
&quot; with this action , the connection to de@@ bu@@ gger if required , or it shares the plug @-@ in with to listen to de@@ bug requirements . this action is triggered by default when a project is opened , which requires a de@@ bu@@ gger , so that in the normal case it is not necessary to pay attention . &quot;
the counter@@ part to de@@ bug@@ ging session starts the session . closes the connection to de@@ bu@@ gger or termin@@ ate the sounds according to requirements .
sends a HTTP request to the server to start a de@@ bug request . this is equivalent to the use of a browser to view the current document . the output of this request is displayed in the de@@ bu@@ gger view .
&quot; instruc@@ ts the de@@ bu@@ gger to start exec@@ uting the script and send information about the monitoring variables as well as the currently executed line . if this happens while the script is stopped , the execution starts . if it is started , the execution starts with the request . &quot;
&quot; instruc@@ ts the de@@ bu@@ gger to start exec@@ uting the script without sending information to super@@ vised variables and the current line number . if this happens while a script is set , the execution starts , as soon as a requirement is placed . &quot;
the de@@ bu@@ gger exec@@ utes the next instruction in the script without entering into the functions or Inclu@@ des .
&quot; the de@@ bu@@ gger exec@@ utes the next instruction in the script , where possible in functions and include include errors . &quot;
instruc@@ ts the de@@ bu@@ gger to pass the statement and go to the next as if there was the current one .
opens a dialog where a variable or an expression can be entered . the monitored value appears in the variable view .
with this dialog a variable can be entered or set a new value of a variable .
&amp; k@@ x@@ s@@ l ; is a work of Keith Is@@ dale as well as this part of the documentary . &amp; k@@ x@@ s@@ l ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; front end and a part of x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g that can be found at http : / / x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g.@@ sf@@ .net with many more works by Keith .
this chapter describes how you can adapt &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us to your needs and how to help &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; help to become better .
&quot; document Type Edi@@ ting Pack@@ ages ( D@@ TE@@ P ; s ) are used in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; they enable &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; skills such as car completion and knot@@ ted rooms . their simplicity and flexibility makes it from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; a fast , user @-@ friendly &amp; IDE ; for web developers , easy to use and productive . &quot;
&quot; &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s are available in two types , family 1 , the Mark@@ up languages and family 2 , the script languages and &amp; CSS ; and Tag@@ XML files with the extension .@@ tag@@ . tool@@ bars are handy , symbolic buttons of picture buttons ( above the editor window ) , insert text and instructions more quickly into a document than one user could ever . &quot;
&quot; &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s can be created manually ( see below ) , downloaded or automatically created from an existing DT@@ D . see for details of conversion . &quot;
&quot; this document describes how Tag@@ XML files are to be created , then the &amp; descrip@@ tion@@ rc ; and also tool@@ bars . short , one &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; . &quot;
&quot; Tag@@ XML files ( .@@ tag ) define both the specific attributes for tags as well as the layout and contents of the properties dialog , the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; for the day it shows the rules and information of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P . &quot;
tag folder is nothing but folder . you only contain the file descrip@@ tion@@ rc ; and the Tag@@ XML files . tag folders bear the name of the descrip@@ tive language and version so available . ( for example , html @-@ 4.0@@ 1 @-@ strict ) &quot;
&quot; the table below lists the elements of Tag@@ XML and declar@@ ing whether they are necessary , or not . although not all necessary , it is advisable to use as many as possible so that other users have a better insight and more information in working with them . &quot;
the following chapter describes each element in detail . everything about the possibilities and limits is explained in a simple way .
&quot; this is the root element of a Tag@@ XML document . it can only occur once in a document . it can contain the definition of many tags , but contains only one element type about itself otherwise nothing . &quot;
the type of tag is a script function . when used &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; is an argument of the function . ( only family 2 )
only valid for the class type class . the name of the base class for this class . ( family 2 )
only valid for type method . speci@@ fies the name of the class where this method belongs . ( family 2 )
&quot; if yes , the day has a common attribute group and the attributes within this tags may be added to any other day . ( family 1 ) &quot;
sets a text in the dialog . this text is determined by the &amp; lt ; text &gt; tag . this is a single element type element .
&quot; describes an attribute of a tag . this element can only occur once for each attribute . it speci@@ fies the name and type of attribute . in addition , it contains other tags that describe how this attribute is to be displayed &amp; etc ; This is a only element type element . &quot;
returns the source code used for filling in tag editing dialog and attribute tree
requires source = d@@ co@@ p . the d@@ co@@ p interface inside &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is used to achieve source data .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p and the name of an interface . the d@@ co@@ p method name within &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is used to achieve the data source .
&quot; requires source = d@@ co@@ p , an interface and a method name . the arguments passed to the method can be empty or % tag@@ name % , which means the name of the current tag . &quot;
a container tag is group@@ ed together with the elements of a list . it can only happen for an attribute description . it is a single element type element .
speci@@ fies the position of the attribute text within a dialog . this tag may occur for each attribute in a dialog only once ( for example for each attribute ; att@@ r &gt; tag ) . the element is empty .
gives the position and the size of a field in the dialog . this tag should be present for each field in the dialog box ( e.g. one for each &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; and &amp; lt ; label &gt; Tag ) . this item is empty .
speci@@ fies a list of elements that may occur within the defined tags . this element is an element type .
speci@@ fies a list of elements that end a tag . this element is an element type .
all Tag@@ XML files must start with one &amp; XML ; -@@ Declaration : &amp; lt ; ? XML version = 1.0 encoding = UT@@ F @-@ 8 ? &gt; and must be properly ch@@ ained and closed .
&quot; spaces do not influence anything , but pay attention to &amp; lt ; characters . these should be replaced by &amp; amp ; tool@@ tip &gt; , &amp; lt ; wh@@ ats@@ this &gt; , and lt ; wh@@ ats@@ this &gt; , and lt ; text &gt; to be sub@@ stituted , but some pieces of work would disappear . &quot;
&quot; to check the Tag@@ XML files , the Tools dialog is shown at the top of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; window to start and select Tag@@ X@@ ML@@ . a further dialog will appear to follow its simple instructions . &quot;
this function is currently not available . currently the check is only when loading the Tag@@ XML files in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; .
in the following an example of a family 1 Tag@@ XML file . this file describes the &amp; lt ; schema &gt; element of the &amp; W3@@ C ; &amp; XML ; schema . the filename for this Tag@@ XML file should be schem@@ a.@@ tag .
in the following an example of a working family 2 Tag@@ XML file . in this file a &amp; PHP ; over@@ loading function is described . the filename of this Tag@@ XML file should be over@@ load@@ .@@ tag .
&amp; lt ; ? XML version = &quot; 1.0 &quot; encoding = &quot; UT@@ F @-@ 8 &quot; ? &gt; &amp; lt ; tag &gt; &amp; lt ; tag name = &quot; over@@ load &quot; type = &quot; void &quot; &gt; &amp; lt ; tag = &quot; string &quot; status = &quot; optional &quot; / &gt; &amp; lt ; / tag &gt; &amp; lt ; / tags &gt;
the &amp; descrip@@ tion@@ rc ; file is just as simple and there is an editor to access via DT@@ D Edit DT@@ D Settings . for a newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; for a newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; for a newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; should be created a simple &amp; descrip@@ tion@@ rc ; with the following entries :
&#91; general &#93; version = Use 1 for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; version &amp; lt ; = 3.@@ 1.2 and 2 for each higher version . name = DT@@ D statement . ( - / / W3@@ C ; / / DT@@ D HTML 4.0@@ 1 Transi@@ tional / / EN ) Nick@@ name = The simplified name of DT@@ D . ( HTML 4.0@@ 1 Transi@@ tional ) . if not specified the name is used as a nick@@ name .
an action can be created with settings actions ... click Create new action to the same dialog :
&quot; the button short@@ cut that this action is assigned . with clicking the Custom button , a short@@ cut can be assigned ; with K@@ one the current short@@ cut can be removed . &quot;
the simpl@@ est actions . a text can be entered in the detailed settings and when exec@@ uting the action this text is inserted in the document at the current cursor position . see the example below .
&quot; this is the most powerful action type . with the help of this action , external applications ( usually scripts , but it is not limited ) , which change the document or use as input ( or parts of the document ) , are started . examples from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; themselves are the quick@@ start dialog or the different See in ... Ac@@ tions for the ( X ) HTML @-@ D@@ TE@@ Ps . &quot;
&quot; first , the name of the script and the interpreter must be specified . example : SH / home / my@@ Home / my@@ Scrip@@ t.@@ sh . &quot;
&quot; although qualified paths are allowed , it is recommended to use the % scrip@@ t@@ dir variable in command line , such as sh % scrip@@ t@@ dir / my@@ Scrip@@ t.@@ sh@@ . in this way : $ K@@ DE@@ HOME / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / scripts in their path : $ PAT@@ H There are other special variables that can be used in the command line : &quot;
% f : we replace the URL of the current document . in case of a local document file : / from the document name is removed .
&quot; pi@@ d : is replaced with the PID of the current &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; if by &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; only one instance runs , the text is unique to the PID number . this is useful when D@@ CO@@ P is used to control &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; it is used by the external script . &quot;
&quot; the parameters for this event , usually the filename of the current document or the path to the project file . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the methods listed above , a script can be submitted by &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; in the input field you can determine what is to be sent to the default input . possibilities are : &quot;
selected text : the selected area of the document is sent to the script . the % input variable is usually only useful with this setting .
&quot; according to the input , the output of the executed application can also be re@@ directed . there are two types of output : normal output , written to the standard output ; error messages , written to the standard output . it can be specified , what is to be done with the text written to the standard output : &quot;
&quot; if there are many tags in the mark@@ up language , it is recommended to sub@@ divide the tags in logical groups . in any case , it is not too many , so you can create a toolbar with the name of the market . &quot;
&quot; once a toolbar has been added , you need to add and configure actions . select Settings actions . &quot;
the parts of this window are pretty self @-@ explan@@ atory . pressing the New Action button at the bottom of the window starts editing mode .
fill in all the required fields and add the tag to the appropriate toolbar .
&quot; complete everything and , if the tag has attributes and plan their use , enable &quot; &quot; Edit day &quot; &quot; dialog when available so that an input when using the action is possible . &quot;
Ig@@ itt ! is this an ug@@ ly symbol . who should remember the action in connection with this symbol ? we replace it before we have difficulty .
&quot; to create a symbol that the action is better represented , we will use &amp; ki@@ con@@ edit ; use . select from the &amp; K@@ Menu ; , Graphics more programs ( or where else it is located in their distribution ) . &quot;
&quot; &amp; ki@@ con@@ edit ; uses default 3@@ 2x@@ 32 pixels , but we need 22@@ x@@ 22 . to change this , select Edit size others . &quot;
&quot; please note that the created symbol does not only help you to remember what the action does , but also to all other users of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P . &quot;
&quot; with regard to the start of the day , I decided to create a start button as a symbol . by using green ( green is usually referred to as loose , star@@ ed , further interpreted ) , or should at least , a message to the user will signal that clicking this symbol is a &amp; lt ; start@@ gt ; -@@ Tag in the current document will be inserted . &quot;
&quot; after the creation of the symbol it must still be connected with the action . this is done via the menu with settings actions ... ( in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; ) and selecting the desired action . besides the text box is a button , press it . &quot;
&quot; select the folder where the saved icon is located , select it and confirm with OK . &quot;
&quot; press the App@@ ly button and continue with other tags , so it still exists , or confirm with OK to complete . &quot;
suppose you want to add some common &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; functions to the toolbar or it should set it to a better overview by some separ@@ ator into several groups . make sure the desired toolbar can be selected .
&quot; after selecting the element , which is to be added to the toolbar , press the arrow key to the right . this adds the element to the toolbar . &quot;
&quot; for example , I would like to have a quick way to view the Kon@@ quer@@ or preview . I will select it and add it to the toolbar . &quot;
&quot; please note how the separ@@ ator support the group@@ ing . someone , who doesn &apos;t know my toolbar , could believe that the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ knob is the opposite of the start button . &quot;
the new toolbar must be tested by sampling of all symbols to ensure that everything works .
&quot; if Rest@@ e@@ XML does not exist , it will create im@@ bal folders , but your toolbar ( s ) should be saved in the right folder , so that your toolbar ( s ) will be loaded ( s ) when a file is opened by the appropriate type . &quot;
perhaps the most not@@ orious extension of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; for the normal user is the possibility to add documentation for the scrip@@ ting language or the format@@ ting language you like most . this is why this chapter describes how I create a &amp; PHP application tree for my personal use .
&quot; before you start your own documentation , you could check in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; Rep@@ osit@@ ory check if someone has done it for you . &quot;
&quot; there are two parts in this process . first you need to create an existing documentation for the format@@ ting / script / etc ; language . then , you need to create the do@@ cr@@ c file . &quot;
&quot; # K@@ DE configuration file &#91; Tree &#93; Doc dir = path , relative to this file , to the documentation HTML files e.g. php@@ 42 / # elements in the Main Index Top element = your description for these document@@ ations e.g. &amp; PHP ; 4.2 Documentation Section 1 = Sec@@ tion@@ 1.@@ html Sec@@ 2.2 = Sec@@ 2.@@ 3.@@ html &quot;
&quot; the tree section defines the visible part of the documentation in the documentation tree . for example , see the &amp; PHP documentation for example : &quot;
&quot; # K@@ DE Con@@ fig File &#91; Tree &#93; Doc dir = php@@ 42 / # top level elements Top element = PHP 4.2 documentation PHP 4.2 documentation = Table of contents , # Get@@ ting Start@@ ed , # Language Reference Table of Contents = index.html Get@@ ting Start@@ ed = Introduction , ... Basic syntax = langu@@ age@@ .@@ basic @-@ syn@@ tax@@ .html ... &quot;
note the # before Get@@ ting Start@@ ed and Language Reference . this indicates that it is sub@@ folders in the tree with its own content . there is no known border for the depth of the box ( except through reason ) m@@ d@@ ash ; but try it yourself .
&quot; note that the contents directory is refer@@ enced directly to a file ( and consequently , at the top end of the tree view &amp; m@@ d@@ ash ; folder will be displayed ! ) . &quot;
spaces do not influence anything but pay attention to &amp; lt ; characters . these should be replaced by &amp; amp ; and &amp; lt ; in all &amp; XML ; -@@ based &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; resources to be replaced .
&quot; for example , when writing a &amp; PHP script , the documentation for the my@@ sql _ fetch _ array function is to be displayed . by marking the function name and pressing Ctr@@ l ; H for context help the documentation would be displayed directly . there are only two types of entries here : the context list ( Cont@@ ext@@ List ) and the file connection lines . &quot;
&quot; a simple list of contex@@ tual elements that should be available ( for &amp; PHP ; , these are the functions of &amp; PHP ; ) . &quot;
&quot; now , you can save your file do@@ cr@@ c to $ HOME / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / doc for local or global use . &quot;
&quot; if you are sure that these are good and worth to be shared , send your do@@ cr@@ c files with a description of important information , e.g. which documentation was used to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ Rep@@ osit@@ ory for use by the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; community . they will not be rich , but proud to have worked with the best web development platform . &quot;
&quot; with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; you are not alone . it is possible to share the separated resources ( D@@ TE@@ P pack@@ ets , tool@@ bars with actions , scripts , templates ) with others . there are two ways to do this : &quot;
&quot; the resources can be sent by email to friends , partners or else to whom . at different locations , you will send an email menu entry , such as DT@@ D DT@@ D package ( D@@ TE@@ P ) with email , in the context menu of files and folders in the templates and in the script tree . &quot;
&quot; the resources can be uploaded to our main archive , from where all other &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; users can download them . &quot;
&quot; when you upload your pas@@ sp@@ hr@@ ase for your private GP@@ G key ( the pas@@ sp@@ hr@@ ase will not be saved ) , or in the event that you have multiple keys , the input fields have to be filled out ( URL preview can remain empty ) and click OK to upload the upload . &quot;
&quot; up@@ loading can be uploaded from the DT@@ D DT@@ D package ( D@@ TE@@ P ) menu , tool@@ bars toolbar , and started in the context menu of files and folders in the templates and scripts tree . &quot;
&quot; after downloading a resource still before installation , we investigate &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the integrity of the resource by checking the integrity and the signature . if the integrity is given and the resource is correctly signed , a message appears with the indication of the resource of the resource . &quot;
&quot; it is possible to work in XML languages that are currently not supported by &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; however , the creation can be time @-@ consuming because hundreds of tag files could be needed in tag@@ XML format . there is the simpler way to automatically convert a DT@@ D into a D@@ TE@@ P package . &quot;
&quot; the conversion can be started from the DT@@ D Load and Convert DT@@ D menu . select the .@@ dt@@ d file with the DT@@ D description , which should be used . after that , the following dialog appears : &quot;
target directory name : the newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; is written in the $ K@@ DE@@ HOME / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / d@@ te@@ p folder .
! doc@@ type definition line : the string that appears in the ! Doc@@ type tag like HTML PU@@ B@@ LI@@ C - / / W3@@ C / / DT@@ D HTML 4.0@@ 1 Transi@@ tional / / EN http : / / www.@@ w@@ 3.@@ org / TR / HTML@@ 4 / loos@@ e.@@ dt@@ d
&quot; fine adjustment of the D@@ TE@@ P after conversion : if enabled , brings &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; after conversion the &amp; descrip@@ tion@@ rc ; editor , with the details of the newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; it is recommended to use this option . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us , there are some key concepts . in order to understand these and full benefit from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us , you must first famili@@ ari@@ ze yourself with these fundamental concepts , without their understanding &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us , the working area is divided into three areas : global , local and project @-@ related . this distinction affects a number of components in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; &quot;
&quot; global elements are available for anyone who uses &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; uses , available . by tool bars about actions , everything is mark@@ eted as global , in the common folder structure of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; stored . this allows the group of administrators to secure different tool@@ bars , actions and patterns in the global tree , which will then be available to everyone in a multi @-@ user environment . &quot;
local elements represent a personal collection of web development agents for a single user . these are user @-@ specific patterns and tool@@ bars . local elements are stored in the user &apos;s directory so that they can only use this user personally .
&quot; project @-@ related items are only available within a specific project . this can be anything from &amp; CSS ; samples to toolbar with special actions specially for the files of a particular project . simply , this is the most restricted size . all elements are em@@ o@@ unced in the folder tree of the project , which em@@ o@@ unding the sharing of special tools and patterns of all employees within the project . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ M@@ DI ; consists of some main areas : the editor window , the building man@@ ners with information and the toolbar . &quot;
&quot; you can click the card driver with the right mouse button to get a context menu with the current document matching entries , such as closing , delete , or upload the document , jump to a book@@ marks or execution of CVS commands to the current document . &quot;
&quot; right @-@ click in the editor area will lead to a further context menu concerning the edited documentary content , such as basic processing steps ( cutting / copying / paste / paste ) , editing the tags on the mouse poin@@ ter or opening the file if the string is called a file under the mouse poin@@ ter . &quot;
&quot; at the top end of the editor window , are the toolbar of the editor . currently , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; &amp; HTML ; 4.0@@ 1 Transi@@ tional as a standard , for which a set of tool@@ bars is shown . &quot;
&quot; the use of tool@@ bars is really easy . if you want to insert a single day , e.g. &amp; lt ; in your document , then click the icon that has several attributes ( like anchor ) , you can fill in a dialog with different fields . &quot;
&quot; the building man@@ ners ( Q@@ IT ; ) make it possible to navigate to &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; navigate , open them and strip them . in the presentation with card gri@@ ds are available for files , project , sample templates , document structure , scripts , attributes and documentation building man@@ ners . &quot;
&quot; project management is a powerful tool that provides &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; this view shows all the files in the project and allows managing the files in the project by right mouse click . actions such as adding , removing , up@@ loading or dele@@ tion of files from storage media can be performed using the context menu displayed . &quot;
&quot; another possibility of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is the use of templates . almost everything can be a template : images , program parts , a whole website &amp; etc ; There are all possibilities open to you . &quot;
&quot; templates can be divided into three categories depending on what context they are used . global templates are always available , local templates only usable for the respective user and templates in projects can only be used in the project . &quot;
&quot; here you can find information about the available scrip@@ ting languages . by clicking with the left mouse button , you can retrieve the available information to a script . &quot;
&quot; this view shows the internal structure of the active document . by clicking on an element , the cursor is set to the position of the element . by right @-@ clicking an element , a list of commands in relation to navigation and refres@@ h of the tree opens . &quot;
this tree appears under the other parts of the building . with it you can quickly change attributes and nam@@ esp@@ aces . the content aligned to the content allows the change of all available attributes with just a few mouse clicks .
&quot; here is the complete documentation of the web technology for your development . there can be pre @-@ packed documentation for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; from the qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; &apos; Documentation site you can create your own documentation , and by adding a folder doc to a project , project @-@ specific documentation can be edited , edited and considered . &quot;
&quot; by default , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; two card drivers at the bottom of the window , can be reached via the useful information : the message window and the problem window . &quot;
this card driver shows information about each script running in Qu@@ anta . for example the DT@@ D of the current document and all changes to the DT@@ D are shown .
&quot; this card driver shows all errors in the mark@@ up of the current document . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; scripts , which are executed , give all error messages ( as there is ) in this window . &quot;
the tool@@ bars are extensive expanded and easy to understand . show them on a symbol and they get the corresponding command . the toolbar of the toolbar can be defined as symbols in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; to define .
another function of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is the ability to send a toolbar via e @-@ mail .
&quot; it is reasonable if you want to customize the location of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; files on your system . for this , auto@@ conf has a number of options that can be passed to the configure script . to get a complete list of all options , specify . / configure --@@ help . &quot;
if you have problems when starting &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; you should check if your path contains the &amp; k@@ de ; 3 bin folder . also you should make sure that is no older version of &amp; k@@ de ; 3 in PAT@@ H in front of its bin folder . the same applies to &amp; Q@@ t ; .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is a web development tool for the K@@ DE surface . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; has been optimized for a rapid web development and combines an advanced development environment with a variety of powerful functions .
&quot; while trying to create the best &amp; HTML editor , the developers of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us began to deal with a nearby idea : what if &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; an independent , exp@@ and@@ able mark@@ up language editor would ? well , this would make him the absolutely greatest web development tool for &amp; k@@ de ; so it was done . &quot;
&quot; no longer limited to pure &amp; HTML ; restricted , is &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; now far on the way to a general and comprehensive web development tool . summar@@ ized : if you can define it in &amp; XML , then it should be &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; for it the appropriate &amp; IDE . &quot;
&quot; now , to the above claim needs to be held that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; as a product based on the outstanding efforts of the entire &amp; k@@ de ; development community is based . &quot;
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; enables web developers to use an intuitive and powerful multi @-@ document interface ( M@@ DI ; ) . this can increase productivity dramatically . by means of self @-@ kn@@ itted actions , scripts and tool@@ bars , autom@@ ating almost every task is possible . &quot;
&amp; Qu@@ anta ; Plus ; is a web development environment for HTML and related languages . it has been designed for fast web development and quickly became an advanced editor with many powerful features .
&amp; Qu@@ anta ; Plus is in no way connected with commercial versions of &amp; Qu@@ anta ; the original developers left the GPL licensed version and produced a commercial program .
&quot; more detailed documentation is available with help : / Qu@@ anta , either this URL in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; enter , or k@@ help@@ center help : / Qu@@ anta . &quot;
&amp; Qu@@ anta ; is currently being developed and maintained by Eric L@@ aff@@ oon Sequ@@ it@@ ur @ k@@ de@@ .org and Andr@@ as Man@@ tia am@@ anti@@ a @ k@@ de@@ .org .
&quot; a quick access list of files that you have opened . this list changes every time you open a file that is not on it , where the oldest entry is removed . &quot;
&quot; this allows you to save code parts and whole files as templates for later use . if you are trying to save the selected file / text outside the local / project template folder , only one error is reported . &quot;
&quot; converts special characters to &amp; HTML when inser@@ ting from the clip@@ board , so that they appear correctly and not mis@@ understood by the browser as a format@@ ting reference . &quot;
converts the text from the clip@@ board in &amp; URL ; description which is the correct way to insert special characters and spaces in &amp; URL ; s . primarily used for inser@@ ting &amp; URL ; s in the anchor tag .
switches off or off . this allows you to select text blocks using the &amp; Shift ; key .
go directly to a line number . this is very helpful if your &amp; PHP script gives error messages !
search a string or regular expression in the selected directory . a kind gre@@ p or sed with GUI and pre@@ defined expressions to help you .
displays the message window or not . this is the window where you can see the display of script partitions and the de@@ bu@@ gger .
trig@@ gering and switching the problem repor@@ ter at the bottom of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; main window . the problem repor@@ ter is activated once you switch to the structure tree .
displays the symbol column on the left of the main window . this column allows you to set book@@ marks with a mouse click .
&quot; if there is book@@ marks in the current file , they will appear in the menu together with the entries Previous or Next , depending on the cursor position in the document . &quot;
book@@ marks from other open documents appear in the menu group@@ ed according to the file name of the other documents .
opens an existing project from the hard drive . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ Projects are stored with the file extension .@@ web@@ pr@@ j .
presents a dialog for past@@ ing files to the current project . the selected files will then be copied to the project directory .
searches the project directory for new files that might be there . this allows you to copy graphics files to your project folder or sub@@ folder and then add them to the project .
download the files in your project on the server . the list of available transport methods depends on your version of &amp; k@@ de ; from and whether you have downloaded more input / output modules ( K@@ IO slaves ) .
settings such as &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the project manages . in the chapter &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ Projects you will find details .
loads a project toolbar . these are stored in Project Dir / Tool@@ bars and are only available in this menu if you have assigned them to this project .
&quot; a dialog to save your tool@@ bars , allows you to select the type of toolbar : local or project . &quot;
&quot; opens a dialog to add a new toolbar . this creates only the name . actions must be saved by means of settings ... or you will be asked if you want to save the toolbar . &quot;
&quot; delet@@ es a toolbar from the field of view . this does not delete it from the hard drive . if you haven &apos;t yet saved the toolbar , you &apos;ll be asked if you want to do it . &quot;
this allows you to send your own toolbar to someone ( perhaps the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ Team for the toolbar to be present in the next release ) . the menu item opens a new email message with the toolbar as attachment .
&quot; allows up@@ loading of tool@@ bars to the main server , where everyone else can access it . see in . &quot;
load one &amp; DT@@ D ; that has made you or anyone else and convert to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; own description format .
&quot; load / refres@@ h the entities from the &amp; DT@@ D ; it is useful if the entities from the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P are to be refres@@ hed , without the whole &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; to ren@@ ew . if this is global and a write permission in the global K@@ DE folder is not present , the store fails . &quot;
&quot; this menu contains a list of tags available in the currently loaded toolbar . if the standard ( HTML ; ) toolbar is loaded , there is a sub@@ menu standard in the Tags menu , which contains the list of tags / actions on this toolbar . &quot;
&quot; allows access to the current tag settings dialog when there is one . this entry is always present in the menu item , followed by &amp; DT@@ D ; -@@ specific sub@@ menus . &quot;
activ@@ ates or de@@ activ@@ ates the intelligent insert of tags . currently this only works with ( X ) HTML DT@@ Ds . intelligent inser@@ tion means that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; inser@@ ting using tool bar if this day is contrary to the rules .
&quot; in the plug @-@ in menu , the available plugins are listed under the menu items listed above . click on it . click on an activated plug @-@ in disabled . &quot;
sel@@ ects the syntax highlight mode for the current file . the list of available her@@ edit@@ ary schem@@ ata depends on the unique ; -@@ version .
&quot; select the type of line identi@@ fier . very useful if you know people using other OS platforms for developing . choose Unix , Windows / DOS or Macintosh . &quot;
checks the syntax of the current document based on the selected &amp; DT@@ D ; using the external application ti@@ dy .
&quot; instant switching between the different types of user interface . due to some restrictions in the K@@ DE libraries it can sometimes need time or create un@@ nice graphics . it is recommended that the card sheet mode , which is also the default setting , or the sub @-@ window mode that corresponds to the display in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; 3.2 and earlier . &quot;
&quot; in addition , this menu provides an entry for each open sub @-@ window . selecting an entry will activate the corresponding sub@@ window . &quot;
switches the display of the status bar at the bottom of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; main window .
&quot; the changes in this dialog affect every application that uses the K@@ HTML part , including the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ Web@@ browser . &quot;
direc@@ ts the behavior of the editor window . in the documentation of &amp; works ; you will find details .
&quot; a dialog appears where you can delete entries from the toolbar , or which you can add and modify sequences . &quot;
&quot; this should create a help according to the environment of the mouse poin@@ ter , but it is not implemented yet . &quot;
&quot; and qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is a high quality product that is freely available and free licensed , but as with any open source project developers can always use help . if they want to support the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; development in financial form , they find the way here . &quot;
&quot; the fields are self @-@ explan@@ atory and should be filled out from top to bottom , as for example after completing the project name , the entire directory structure for the rest of the project will be completed automatically . all these paths and author information fields can later be configured with Shift ; F@@ 7 Project Project Properties . &quot;
&quot; here is the name for the project to enter , for example fo@@ o . when entering Name , file is automatically filled out . &quot;
this is the name of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; project file . by default it has the name of the project in lo@@ wer@@ case letters and without spaces with extension web@@ pr@@ j ( e.g. f@@ oo@@ .@@ web@@ pr@@ j ) . this file is stored in the project directory .
&quot; here you can see the server address of the machine you want to access , except you edit local data . either a name ( host@@ nam@@ e.@@ exemplary ) or an IP address ( 12@@ 7.0@@ .0@@ .1 ) are possible . &quot;
&quot; if you leave this field blank , the default settings of the chosen protocol will be used . depending on the setting of the remote host , an adjustment could be necessary . &quot;
&quot; this is the folder where templates for the project are stored . it is a relative path to the project and templates . if a common collection of files is used for different projects , this folder should be set instead of the standard . &quot;
&quot; this is the folder where the toolbar can be stored for the project . it is a relative path to the project and by default tool@@ bars . if a common collection of files is used for various projects , this folder should be set instead of the standard . &quot;
this allows files to be inserted from the local files@@ ystem to the project . multiple files or entire folders can be selected .
&quot; this setting is great if you have static web content you want to download and change . if you have failed scripts ( e.g. &amp; PHP ; , Python , &amp; etc ; ) you have to proceed differently . &quot;
&quot; if files , which are located somewhere in the main folder of the project , should be hoo@@ ked up . if a project is started from scratch , not hook . &quot;
&quot; with this option , all files and folders within the main folder will be displayed and you can make an accurate selection of good th@@ inners . &quot;
&quot; this shows a list of files in the root folder . you can select the files you want by clicking or , by removing the tick , clips from the project . &quot;
the last screen of the new project wizard contains three settings that simplify your work . these settings can be uploaded to the menu with project project properties in the sub@@ window profile or using the Shift ; F@@ 7 keyboard short@@ cut .
some settings correspond to those in project assist@@ ants and are described in detail . the additional entries are explained below .
&quot; a list of fil@@ en@@ ames ( plac@@ eholders are possible ) , which will be ignored in project @-@ related operations such as project folders . &quot;
&quot; additional option to top , also files listed in .c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore are excluded from the project . &quot;
&quot; the project view , which is loaded when opening the project , can be read more about project views . &quot;
this allows you to select the desired de@@ bu@@ gger . currently only Gu@@ bed is supported . more information about Gu@@ bed can be found in . the Deb@@ ug@@ ger plugin can be set with the Options button .
&quot; in the Profile Profile , upload profiles ( see in ) can be set , as well as the display of a tree view for the contents of the server for each profile , by showing an own tree view for each profile . &quot;
&quot; in the sub@@ window Team configuration , project members can be added , edited or deleted as well as a mailing list . see the details . &quot;
&quot; in the event configuration , you can switch event actions and add these actions , change or delete these actions . event actions are executed when a previously specific event occurs , such as the backing of a file . see the details . &quot;
&quot; by default , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the last project that was opened . &quot;
to open another project select Project Open Project ... from the Project Project or the Symbol Project Open from the toolbar . the Project Open Project will open and allows the selection of a project . projects have .@@ web@@ pr@@ j as an extension .
&quot; when &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; closed , the project file will be automatically saved . you &apos;ll be asked if you want to save changes before leaving if &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; changed files . the same happens when you load a new project . &quot;
the project manager gives free access to the files in the project . there the files can be managed in the current project .
&quot; folders beha@@ ves as well , but the entries are missing and open with ... in the context menu call@@ able with the right mouse button : &quot;
here you can select different profiles . the profile contains information about the location of the uploaded files . see .
&quot; allows removing the current profile . if only a profile exists , the button ends to prevent the removal . &quot;
this option is useful when frequent up@@ loading of files is needed and the rather uns@@ af@@ e password on the disk will not come into question .
this will stop the transmission or simply leave the dialog when you change your mind before up@@ loading .
&quot; in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us , many high loading profiles can be created and thus the project ( or parts of the project ) can be uploaded to different servers . when editing or creating a profile , this dialog is displayed : &quot;
this is the server &apos;s name to which the files should be copied . either a fully qualified domain name or an IP address will work .
&quot; the transfer protocol for up@@ loading . the list depends on the version of &amp; k@@ de ; and the installed ki@@ o slaves . at least , you should choose from &amp; FTP ; , file ( local ) and n@@ fs . &quot;
&quot; the port for transfer . normally , this does not have to be changed unless the network administrator does not operate a service at the usual port . &quot;
&quot; depending on your anxiety , this is either a time @-@ saving function or a danger . use them at your discretion . the password is stored on the disk , so it can not be read easily , but everyone with programming skills can easily be seen in plain text . &quot;
&quot; a project view is only a set of files and tool@@ bars . there can be many views in a project , i.e. by simply drag@@ ging the view , various files and tool@@ bars can be loaded and replace the currently opened files and tool@@ bars . &quot;
&quot; views can be saved , opened or deleted from the Project or Project Tool@@ bar in the Project or Project Tool@@ bar . &quot;
&quot; this chapter describes the parts of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; with which one has to do most . this helps not only increase productivity , but also allows the adaptation of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; to the own way of working . &quot;
&quot; as mentioned above , tool bars in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; preferably st@@ ably designed over the menu . use and adding differ . adding tool rails is treated below in the addition of tool@@ bars . &quot;
&quot; the toolbar and the symbols on it can be set by using context menu ( right click on the toolbar ) , in which with New Action , a New toolbar can be executed , which can be specified in the dialog where it can be specified , which actions on this or other toolbar can be visible . &quot;
&quot; by calling the context menu to an action ( icon ) on a toolbar , the entries will be removed and action edited , which are self @-@ explan@@ atory . &quot;
the toolbar and the actions on them can set up menu buttons in the menu ... and set settings actions ..
&quot; templates are basically documents skel@@ et@@ ons , code sc@@ opes and files to link . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; uses templates basically like a usual files@@ ystem with extended organization and interfaces . templates have in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; in about the restrictions you imagine for the files@@ ystem . &quot;
some with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; provided templates have conditions for their use . please read the conditions specified at the beginning of each template before use .
binary templates are usually inserted in documents using links ( e.g. pictures with img src = / src / ur@@ l ) . some examples can be found in the storage space under global templates .
&quot; documents can be written by any text document type . based on these templates , new documents can be created . &quot;
&quot; this kind of templates is useful if not a new document should always be inserted into the documents based on a template , but the same text area . you can find everything from a comment via a final note to a complete menu system on Javascript or Perl base . see for more information on templates tree . &quot;
&quot; as the name says , these templates are used for whole websites as templates . they are a collection of different documents organized in a folder structure , summar@@ ized in a compressed tar archive . currently there are no examples in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us . &quot;
&quot; create a document structure according to Beli@@ eving ( XML ; , &amp; HTML ; , Doc@@ Book &amp; etc ; . ) and select File As template save as local template ... &quot;
&quot; once this has happened , you notice that ( even if it was saved as a project template ) the template is not visible in the project tree . &quot;
&quot; select text in your document and click File As template save selection as local / project template . alternatively , the selection can easily be drag@@ ged with drag and drop to the tree view templates . &quot;
&quot; creating binary templates is simple : the file can only be copied to a template folder . all file management functions can be used for it , such as drag and drop or inser@@ ting over the file tree of Kon@@ quer@@ or . &quot;
&quot; you can click on a folder on the right in the file tree or in the project file , select a name for the template . by default , it is saved in the project folder , but of course it can be saved as a local or global template . &quot;
&quot; project templates enable a very target @-@ oriented approach . you can submit head@@ lines and foot@@ ers or dynam@@ ically with &amp; PHP ; create , insert files or link them with them . in addition , you can keep track of some things when using templates in projects . &quot;
the template structure in the sub@@ window templates is based on the files placed in $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / templates and $ HOME / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / templates .
&quot; to specify the behavior of a folder , click the right mouse button on the folder and select Properties in the context menu . the following dialog appears : &quot;
&quot; a selection box with the three previously described types ; files , text or templates . &quot;
&quot; this is enabled by default and fits for everything except the tri@@ bal folders in the template . if a root folder is set so , the bl@@ ah would appear with something like text module . if nothing appears , you probably find yourself in a root folder . &quot;
allow pre@@ text or text for templates in this folder . this could be general head@@ lines or foot@@ ers for all templates for a specific project and allows to furnis@@ h a complete presentation with the matching head@@ lines / foot@@ ers by copying contents .
&quot; in addition , you have the context menu ( pointing to press right mouse button ) over a complete command collection for adding folders or copying and inser@@ ting templates from one place to another . &quot;
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; offers two modes : V@@ PL ; editor and V@@ PL ; &amp; source editor that can be reached via the View menu . the first mode replaces the editor window in two parts : the source text editor and the V@@ PL ; editor .
the V@@ PL ; editor works as follows : it loads a document like a normal &amp; HTML ; - or &amp; XHTML ; -@@ page and a cursor .
&quot; when working with the V@@ PL ; editor in a document that contains &amp; PHP ; it is not possible to edit it directly with the V@@ PL ; source code . it is not possible to edit it directly with the V@@ PL ; editor . to edit &amp; PHP ; there are no plans to change this behavior . &quot;
&quot; the second mode works exactly like the first , except that at the same time changes both in the source text editor and in the V@@ PL ; editor synchron@@ ously running . pressing F@@ 9 is activated , this mode is already active , the button press will move the active cursor from one window to another , whereby the position in the document is maintained . &quot;
&quot; the synchron@@ ization distance between the V@@ PL ; editor and the source text editor can be adjusted via Settings Qu@@ anta . depending on your choice of V@@ PL , you can choose between synchron@@ ization after one click or automatically . &quot;
&quot; the document properties dialog is also called when a new document is created with the V@@ PL ; editor will be called , as soon as a new document with the V@@ PL ; editor is created . &quot;
met@@ a tags allow storing information about the document itself e.g. keywords for Internet search engines . met@@ a elements can be added or removed by pressing the two buttons at the bottom . a click into the list allows to change the content such as keywords on the column name and keyword keyword 2 on the content column .
CSS rules are the new way of creating the appearance of pages in your browser . you can add or delete CSS rules using the buttons under the list . editing of CSS rules is currently not supported .
it is possible to include an external CSS style template by pressing the File button and select the corresponding file .
&quot; the use of the cursor is like in a word processor , by moving with arrows , possible . under rare circumstances the cursor beha@@ ves as usual . &quot;
&quot; inser@@ ting tags will be done in the same way on the toolbar , as in the source text editor . it is to note that inser@@ ting tags previously already existing identical tags not removed e.g. when an anchor tag , surrounded with text , must be removed any other surrounding anch@@ ors tag . &quot;
&quot; some tool boxes such as the tables wizard or lists assistant are disabled . they will later work in &amp; V@@ PL ; work , in this release , the tables or lists must be used . &quot;
&amp; x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g ; is a tool for studying style sheets . in contrast to other style sheets the search for specific elements is possible and the style of the style template can be pursued .
&quot; to compile &amp; x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g ; successfully compile , except &amp; k@@ de ; still libraries lib@@ x@@ s@@ lt , li@@ be@@ x@@ s@@ lt and lib@@ x@@ ml , which are already present at a typical installation of &amp; k@@ de ; already existing . &quot;
&quot; new in x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g 3.@@ 1.4 : in g@@ db pati@@ bility mode , or@@ phan@@ ed stops can be set in a specific file and line number and later activated . &quot;
x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g returns the full path from a file name without path name . fil@@ en@@ ames in the same folder as the upper@@ most loaded style template file name with relative path to the working folder con x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g Is for example a style file file . / en / x@@ sl@@ doc@@ .@@ x@@ s@@ l is possible the following entry is possible :
&quot; in this command , a partial or complete agreement with a scale called QNAP or a specified model name is checked . &amp; eg ; template matches with any QNAP NAS , which contains the template template . &quot;
every nam@@ esp@@ ace in the specified &quot; QNAP &quot; will be extended according to the rules defined by the nam@@ esp@@ ace defined in the X@@ SL file name : test@@ 1 &amp; eg ; extended to http : / / www.@@ w@@ 3.@@ org / 199 / X@@ SL / Trans@@ form : test@@ 1

there are many graphical tools to compare . why so &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ? let me briefly explain why I wrote .
&quot; the merger was very complicated , because one of the contribut@@ ors had changed many changes and at the same time corrected the ind@@ entation at many places . a further program@@ mer had changed a lot of text in the same file . the result was numerous conflicts when mer@@ ging . &quot;
&quot; the program used by me showed me only the changed lines , but I could not see what had changed exactly within these lines . and there was no indication of the places where perhaps only the ind@@ entation had changed . the mer@@ ging of these changes was a small night@@ mare . &quot;
this was the beginning . the first version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; could represent differences within a line and changes to white signs . later a lot of other useful functions were added later .
&quot; for example , if you want to compare text quickly , simply copy it to the clip@@ board and add it in one of the comparison window . &quot;
&quot; a function that made a lot of work was the compar@@ isons and mer@@ ging of folders . this function turned &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 , almost into a fully @-@ fle@@ dged file browser . &quot;
&quot; also 3 @-@ way merge is fully supported . this is useful when two people work independently of one piece of code and make changes . in this editor , you can even edit the result . in this editor , you can even edit the result directly . the screen@@ shot shows three source files when mer@@ ging : &quot;
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; also helps you in compar@@ isons and mer@@ ging complete folder . this screen@@ shot shows &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; when mer@@ ging :
&quot; &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; shows exact differences and re@@ jects the possibilities of present color monitors . if you need to check code frequently , you will like this feature . &quot;
&quot; differences in white signs and tab@@ ul@@ ators are shown visible . if lines differ only in a certain number of white signs , one can see that at a glance at the summary in the column at the left side . ( no more anno@@ y@@ ance if nobody changes the ind@@ entation . ) &quot;
&quot; when a file is equal , and the other differs in one line , then the color indicates which file is different . red color means that both files differ . &quot;
&quot; if all the files have the same name but are located in different folders , then you can make the Ti@@ p@@ par@@ b@@ eit easier by using only the file name of the first file . example : &quot;
2 Ord@@ ner@@ 2 Ord@@ ner@@ 2 Ord@@ ner@@ 2 Ord@@ ner@@ 2 Ord@@ ner@@ 2 Ord@@ ner@@ 2 Ord@@ ner@@ 2 Ord@@ ner@@ 2 Ord@@ ner@@ 2 Ord@@ ner@@ 2 Ord@@ ner@@ 2 Ord@@ ner@@ 2 Ord@@ ner@@ 2 Ord@@ ner@@ 2 Ord@@ ner@@ 2 Ord@@ ner@@ 2 Ord@@ ner@@ 2 Ord@@ ner@@ 2 Ord@@ ner@@ 2 Ord@@ ner@@ 2 Ord@@ ner@@ 2 Ord@@ ner@@ 2 Ord@@ ner@@ 2 Ord@@ ner@@ 2 Ord@@ ner@@ 2 Ord@@ ner@@ 2 Ord@@ ner@@ 2 Ord@@ ner@@ 2 Ord@@ ner@@ 2 Ord@@ ner@@ 2 Ord@@ ner@@ 2 Ord@@ ner@@ 2 Ord@@ ner@@ 2 Ord@@ ner@@ 2 Ord@@ ner@@ 2 Ord@@ ner@@ 2 Ord@@ ner@@ 2 Ord@@ ner@@ 2 Ord@@ ner@@ 2 Ord@@ ner@@ 2 Ord@@ ner@@ 2 Ord@@ ner@@ 2 Ord@@ ner@@ 2 Ord@@ ner@@ 2 Ord@@ ner@@ 2 Ord@@ ner@@ 2 Ord@@ ner@@ 2 Ord@@ ner@@ 2 Ord@@ ner@@ 2 Ord@@ ner@@ 2 Ord@@ ner@@
&quot; opening dialog allows manual typ@@ ing of file names , selecting from the file browser ( file ... ) or selecting a recently opened file from the drop @-@ down list . you do not need to specify a third file ; if you leave the entry for C , the analysis of differences will be performed with two files . &quot;
&quot; if you choose a folder , the compar@@ isons and merge of folders will be initiated . if a file is selected , for B and C , a folder , then uses &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the file name from A in the two other folders . &quot;
&quot; if mer@@ ging is enabled , the input field is active for the target and can be processed . however , it is not necessary to specify a output file immediately . you can do this step later while saving . &quot;
the Setup button opens a dialog with settings . here you can set options before starting with the compar@@ isons / merge .
&quot; sometimes you don &apos;t want to compare a whole file , but only parts of a text . &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; allows you to select text parts from the clip@@ board into the active comparison window . &quot;
you can also drag and drop them : simply drag a file from a file manager or selected text from an editor and let it fall over a comparison window .
&quot; what is the idea behind it ? sometimes a file contains several similar functions . if you want to figure out how similar these functions are , it would be a relatively big effort . &quot;
&quot; note : currently , you cannot extract anything from &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; only the drop of text into a comparison window will be supported . &quot;
warning : some editors interpret the drag and drop of text into another program as cutting and inser@@ ting ( instead of copying and inser@@ ting ) . in such a case your original data could be lost .
&quot; the info line of the source window contains the characters A , B or C , the filename and line number of the first visible line in the window . ( note that window C is optional . ) E@@ ach info line has a different color . ( note that window C is optional ) . &quot;
&quot; the three source windows are the letters A , B and C . a has the color blue , B the color green and C is mag@@ enta . ( these pres@@ ets can be changed via the Settings menu . ) &quot;
&quot; when a difference is detected , one sees in the color which file differs . if both files differ , the default color is red . ( color for conflicts in the settings ) . the color scheme is particularly useful when you compare three files . this is in the next section ( merge ) good to see . &quot;
&quot; in some programming languages where white characters are not so important , it is useful to see only the relevant changes . ( for C / C + + , for example , white characters are only relevant in strings and comments , for the pre@@ processor and in few rare cases relevant . ) &quot;
&quot; the vertical line separ@@ ating the composition column from the text is interrupted at the places where the respective source file has no lines . if the line break is activated , the line is dotted with broken lines . &quot;
&quot; the result window ( among the compar@@ isons ) also has an info line with the inscription output : , the filename and &#91; changed &#93; if you have edited the result . usually it contains by automatic coll@@ ision already text , but often it also contains conflicts . &quot;
! ! ! until all conflicts are dissolved the Save is de@@ activated ! ! ! ( use the Jump Jump to find the dissolved / un@@ resolved conflict around the remaining conflicts . )
&quot; if only two compar@@ isons are used , each difference must be solved manually at the same time . &quot;
&quot; by clicking with the left mouse button in one of the windows , the group belonging to the group will be displayed in all windows and the first line of the group will be displayed . &quot;
&quot; this text appears neither in the final saved file , nor in a marker that you might want to copy and paste elsewhere . &quot;
&quot; text &amp; lt ; merge @-@ merge ; however , appears in the clip@@ board , if you copy such text from the result window . go carefully with this function . &quot;
&quot; note : when selecting the sources the options ignore or Ign@@ ori@@ ere C / C + + comments are enabled , changes in numbers or comments are also treated like white signs . &quot;
&quot; when you click in one of the windows , you can use the arrow keys left , right , high , down , side down , side down , start , end , Ctr@@ l @-@ start and Ctr@@ l @-@ End , Si@@ w as you can also use it from other programs . &quot;
&quot; in the output window , you can also use the other buttons to edit . with the Insert button , you can switch between inser@@ tion and over@@ write mode . ( default is the plug @-@ in mode . ) &quot;
a click with the left mouse button in one of the summar@@ ies synchron@@ izes the view of all windows to the beginning of the respective group ( as already in section merge and the edi@@ table display window has been explained ) .
&quot; the toolbar contains seven buttons to navigate with which you can jump to the current / first / last difference , to the next / previous conflict ( Ctr@@ l @-@ Image ward / Ctr@@ l @-@ image down@@ wards ) or to the next / previous conflict ( Ctr@@ l @-@ Picture Leave / Ctr@@ l @-@ Picture ) . &quot;
&quot; to copy the marker to the clip@@ board , you need to copy the Copy button ( Ctr@@ l @-@ C or Ctr@@ l Insert ) . if this is activated , whatever you mark , automatically copied to the clip@@ board and copy the manual copy . be careful with this option , because you may acci@@ dentally over@@ write the contents of the clip@@ board . &quot;
&quot; new@@ lines are stored according to the underlying operating system . Unix flavors use a new@@ line \ \ r \ . K@@ Diff@@ 3 does not retain the new@@ line of the source files , so you should use &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; also not using bin@@ aries . &quot;
the options and the list of the last used files will be automatically saved when they are finished and restored to the next start . ( menu Setup - &gt; K@@ Diff@@ 3 set up ... )
&quot; choose a font with fixed width . ( on some systems , the dialog also provides fonts with variable width to choose , but you should not use them . ) &quot;
&quot; if you activate this option , differences are displayed in ital@@ ics . if the chosen font does not support this display , nothing happens . &quot;
&quot; in systems with only 16 or 256 colors , some colors could not be available in their pure form but would be displayed straight . on these systems , the button preferences automatically displays an odd colour . &quot;
&quot; if this option is enabled , the corresponding number of spaces will be inserted when pressing the tab key . otherwise , a tab@@ ulator character is inserted . &quot;
&quot; if you press Enter or Return , the return of the previous line will be used automatically for the next line . &quot;
&quot; when this option is enabled , each selection will be automatically copied to the clip@@ board . manually copy the manually into the clip@@ board . &quot;
you can select which line type you prefer to save . the default value is the generally usual selection on the operating system used .
&quot; while comparing files , white signs can be ignored . only during this first step , white signs can be ignored . the second step compar@@ es each line . in this step , white signs are not ignored . even when mer@@ ging white signs are ignored . &quot;
&quot; some editors ( on some systems ) save a stroke reset &apos; \ \ r &apos; and a line feed &apos; \ &apos; at the end of a line , but then files with different sizes in the page @-@ to @-@ page comparison will look identical , but like a white sign . during mer@@ ging , this option must be de@@ activated . &quot;
&quot; in the first part of the analysis , numbers and associated signs ( &apos; 0 &apos; - &apos; 9 &apos; , &apos; . &apos; , &apos; - &apos; ) are ignored . &quot;
&quot; in default , this option is disabled . changes in comments are treated like changes in white signs . &quot;
&quot; the option is enabled in default . it is effective in complicated and large files , but slowly with very large files . &quot;
&quot; in automatic mode @-@ jumping mode , this setting determines how long the result of the selection will be displayed before the next un@@ resolved conflict is going forward . &quot;
&quot; automatically trig@@ gers automatic all conflicts in white signs by using the selected file as a source . ( default is manual selection . ) This is useful when white characters in many files are less important . if you need this only from time to time , then use the functions Select A / B / C for all un@@ resolved white conflicts from the mer@@ ging menu . &quot;
these options are discussed in the chapter to scan folder and run a merge . look for details under documentation about the directory comparison and merge .
&quot; if a file is stored and an older version exists , the original version is attached to the suff@@ ix .@@ ori@@ g . if such a backup file exists with the suff@@ ix .@@ ori@@ g , it will be deleted without further backup . &quot;
adap@@ ting this option does not affect the current running program . you need to stop &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; exit and restart to change the change . ( this option is available in the K@@ DE version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; not available because the language is set globally over the control center . )
&quot; the following code settings can be set separately for each entry . if you activate this option , the upper setting is used for all entries . &quot;
the selection fields for encoding appears a short notice about what the local encoding is . ( this cannot be changed here and has a purely informal character . )
&quot; adjust the file encoding for source files . this influences how special characters are treated and interpreted . since encoding for each file is individually adjustable , files can be compared and merged with different encoding . &quot;
&quot; if you have edited a file , you can specify which coding should be used for saving . &quot;
&quot; if you define pre @-@ processing commands , you may not work with your co@@ dec . ( for example , your files may be 16 @-@ bit Uni@@ code , but the pre@@ processor command can only deal with 8 @-@ bit ASCII ) . &quot;
( note : this also applies to changes in numbers or comments when the options ignore numbers or ignore Ign@@ ori@@ ere C / C + + comments . )
&quot; this selection is only available if you compare three files . in normal mode , you may only see the differences between two of three files . &quot;
sometimes you prefer to use the space available on the screen for long lines . simply send the less important windows . ( this option is in the window menu . )
this can also be useful for displaying long lines . ( this option is in the window menu . )
&quot; sometimes , consider the differences and then suddenly decide to merge the files . a simple click starts the merge and uses the file name of the last source file as pres@@ et names for output file . ( if this function is used to restart the merge , then the name of the last used output file will be retained . ) &quot;
&quot; when reading a file , it is first given to this external command . in &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 , the output of the command will be visible , and not the file itself . you can use this function for example to cut dis@@ rup@@ tive parts or to correct the ind@@ entation . &quot;
&quot; when reading a file , it is first given to this external command . if a normal pre@@ processor command is specified ( see above ) , the output of the command is used only for line equ@@ ations . you can write your own pre@@ processor that meets your requirements . each input line must have a corresponding output line . &quot;
&quot; the idea behind it is to give the user more flexibility in setting up the di@@ ff results . however , an external program is needed , and most users do not want to program it themselves . however , the good news is that in most cases sed or per@@ l are sufficient . &quot;
use this pre@@ processor command for line arrows to convert the input in upper@@ case : sed &apos;s / \ \ ( . * \ \ ) / \ \ U \ \ 1 / &apos; This . \ \ 1 in the creation string refers to the found text in the first clamp pair . the \ \ U converts the found text in upper@@ case .
CVS and other version control systems use some key words to insert automatically generated strings ( info : / c@@ vs / keyword sub@@ stitution ) .
&quot; while you experiment with sed , you might begin to understand it and maybe you like these regular expressions . they are very useful because there are many programs that support very similar things . &quot;
&quot; ignor@@ ing numbers is actually an already built @-@ in function in K@@ Diff@@ 3 , but it is good as an example for another pre@@ processor command for new@@ lines . sed &apos;s / &#91; 0@@ 123@@ 45@@ 678@@ 9.@@ - &#93; / / g &apos; E@@ ach character between &apos; &#91; &apos; and &apos; &#93; &apos; is a hit , and each hit is replaced by nothing , so almost deleted . &quot;
sometimes you may want to perform several replac@@ ements at one time . then you can use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on &apos; ; &apos; use to separate the compositions from each other . example :
&quot; instead of sed you can also use some other such as per@@ l -@@ p -@@ e -@@ e &apos;s / RE@@ GE@@ XP / replacing / SCH@@ AL@@ TER &apos; How@@ ever , per@@ l needs some details . where sed \ \ ( and \ \ ) needs per@@ l only ( and ) without the preceding &apos; \ \ &apos; . example : &quot;
the data after the normal pre@@ processor will be retained for viewing and mer@@ ging . the further operations only change the data that the line ab@@ ode al@@ gor@@ y@@ th@@ m looks .
&quot; note : in rare cases when using a normal pre@@ processor , the new@@ line pre@@ processor sees the output of the normal processor as input . &quot;
&quot; pre@@ processor commands are very useful , but like any function that changes text or hidden differences , you may acci@@ dentally not notice certain differences and in the worst case important data destroy important data . &quot;
&quot; often programm@@ ers need to edit many files in a folder . for this reason , you can compare and merge with &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; whole folder recur@@ sively . &quot;
... makes a proposal for each object to merge ; you can adjust the suggestion before the start
can simul@@ ate mer@@ ging and displays simul@@ ated changes without really performing it
... &quot; performs selected actions either with all ( F@@ 7 key ) , or only with selected objects ( F@@ 6 key ) , &quot;
this is very similar to comparing and mer@@ ging individual files . you only need to open folders on the command line or in the dialog file .
&quot; if three folders are merged , folder 1 is used as a base . if no destination folder is specified , use &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; folder 3 as destination folder . &quot;
&quot; note that only the comparison of folders automatically starts , not the mer@@ ging . to start the merge , you need to select the appropriate menu entry or press the F@@ 7 key . ( more details follow . ) &quot;
&quot; while reading the folder , you will be informed a small news window on current progress . if you cancel the scanning of the folder , only the files are listed , which were compared until then . &quot;
&quot; when scanning the folder is finished , shows &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; a list window with the results on the left ... &quot;
each file and folder that was found during the scan is displayed here in a tree . you can select an object with a simple mouse click .
&quot; the folder structure is usually folded together . you can double click a folder by clicking on + / - , or double click on the object . &quot;
&quot; if you double @-@ click on a file , the file comparison is started and it appears a comparison window . &quot;
the symbol in the column name reflects the file type in the first folder ( A ) . these types are possible :
&quot; if the file type is different in the other folders , then this is visible in the columns A / B / C and in the details pane to the selected object . in such a case , the mer@@ ging action cannot be selected automatically . if the merge operation is started , you will be informed about problems of this type . &quot;
&quot; as shown in the picture above , the colors red , green , yellow and black are used in the columns A / B / C . &quot;
&quot; in case of identical sub@@ missions , however , the color is also identical , even if the age of the entries is different . &quot;
&quot; folders are considered identical if their entire content is identical . then also folders have the same color . for folders , the age is in@@ significant for its color . &quot;
&quot; the idea for this color scheme is based on dir@@ di@@ ff . the colors reflect the colors of a leaf , which is only green , then yellow becomes and later , when it is old , red becomes red . &quot;
... &quot; A and C are identical , but not B : copy of B ( or if B does not exist , delete the target if it exists ) &quot;
... &quot; A and B are identical , but not C : copy of C ( or if C does not exist , delete the target if it exists ) &quot;
&quot; B and C are identical , but not A : copy of A ( or if A does not exist , delete the target if it exists ) &quot;
... &quot; A , B and C do not have the same file type ( e.g. if A is a folder and B a file ) : error : contradic@@ tory file types . as long as such faul@@ ty objects exist , the merge may not be started . &quot;
... A and B do not have the same file type ( e.g. if a A folder and B is a file ) : error : conflic@@ ting file types . as long as such faul@@ ty objects exist , the mer@@ ging cannot be started . &quot;
&quot; the mode for synchron@@ izing is active , if only two folders and no explicit target folder have been specified and if the option directories are synchron@@ ized . then select &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the necessary action , so that both folders are identical . if for an entry ... &quot;
... A and B exist but not identical : merge and save the result in both folders . ( the user sees as visible file names for output file only B ; directly after mer@@ ging &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; B to A. )
&quot; if two folders are merged together and select the new file instead of merge ( unsure ) , then check &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the date of the files and suggests the same date , then an error message appears : files are different , but the date is identical .. If such errors are not removed , the mer@@ ging of the folders cannot be started . &quot;
&quot; during the mer@@ ging , a file will be processed after the other . the status column shows skill when the merger has been successful , and corresponding messages if something unexpected occurred . if the merger is completed , you should make a final review and see if the status is fine everywhere . &quot;
&quot; if in the Setup dialog the file comparison method is selected full @-@ time analysis , K@@ Diff@@ 3 will display more columns . these contain the number of un@@ resolved , deleted , non @-@ white and white conflicts . ( the column for solved conflicts is only displayed when three folders are compared or merged . ) &quot;
&quot; you can either merge the currently selected entry ( file or odd ) , or all entries at once . if you have selected all inter@@ connection actions ( also in all sub@@ folders ) , you can start mer@@ ging . &quot;
&quot; please note : if you don &apos;t have a destination folder , it will be used as a target in the three @-@ folder merge mode C as the target and when synchron@@ izing A and / or B is used as a target . &quot;
&quot; if you have selected a destination folder , please check that all entries that should be in the destination folder can also be displayed in the folder structure . check these options to avoid unpleasant surprises : &quot;
to merge all entries : select Directory Fol@@ ders start / continue in the directory -@@ menu or press F@@ 7 ( the short@@ cut ) . to perform only the current entry : select action of the current element or press F@@ 6 .
&quot; if by conflic@@ ting data types still exist invalid merge actions , a message appears on the defective elements . you can then select a valid action for them . &quot;
&quot; when you merge all entries , a dialog window will appear with options , simul@@ ating and breaking . &quot;
select Sim@@ ulate if you want to see what would happen without the real changes . you will then get a detailed list of all actions .
&quot; &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then performs certain actions with all entries . if a manual intervention is necessary ( merge a single file ) , then a merge window will open ( note the screen@@ shot ) . &quot;
&quot; if you are finished with a file , select again folder merge / continue or press F@@ 7 . if you have not yet saved , a corresponding dialog appears . then , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; his work with the next entry continues . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the list , you will see some error messages that will help you select the cause of the problem . in the end of the list , you will see some error messages that will help you select the cause of the problem . &quot;
&quot; if some entries have been merged together , remember &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; these entries ( in the current session ) will not be combined again . even if the merger has been ski@@ pped or not saved , these entries are considered completed . only if you change the merge action , these entries will be merged again . &quot;
the Settings menu of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ( Set Settings - &gt; K@@ Diff@@ 3 ... ) has now has a section called directory merge with these options :
only files that match the specified pattern are displayed in the element tree . separate patterns with a sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; . valid plac@@ eholder : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . ( e.g. * .c@@ pp ; * .@@ h ) . default is * . folders do not have to match this pattern .
&quot; files and folders that match this pattern are not displayed in the element tree . it can be more than a pattern entered , use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as separ@@ ator . valid plac@@ eholder : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ ori@@ g ; * .@@ o . &quot;
&quot; files and folders that match this pattern are not displayed in the element tree . it can be more than a pattern entered , use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as separ@@ ator . valid plac@@ eholder : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ ori@@ g ; * .@@ o . &quot;
ignor@@ es files that would also be ignored by CVS . many aut@@ mati@@ cally generated files are ignored by CVS . the big advantage is that this can be specified folder specific with a .c@@ v@@ indication file . ( look at info : / c@@ vs / c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore . )
&quot; in some files@@ ystems , files have a hiding attribute . in other file systems , a prec@@ ursor is marked as hidden . this option lets you decide whether these files should be displayed in the element tree or not . this option is enabled in default . &quot;
&quot; in case of links to files : when the option is disabled , symbolic links are compared . if the option is switched on , the files will be compared to which the links show . this is de@@ activated in default . &quot;
&quot; if the option is disabled , the links like normal folders will be treated and recur@@ sively searched . a link to a folder that contains a link to yourself would lead to a continuous loop and &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; crashes . ) This option is switched off in default . &quot;
&quot; the complete analysis is slower than a simple binary analysis , and much slower when applied to files containing no text . ( enter a corresponding anti @-@ pattern . ) &quot;
&quot; if you compare large folders over a slow network , it may be faster to compare only the change date and file size . however , this speed advantage will cost you a certain amount of security . please use caution . this option is switched off in default . &quot;
&quot; similar to the date of change , there is no real comparison instead . the files are considered identical if they are equal to . this can be useful for example when copying the modification date . please use caution . this option is switched off in default . &quot;
activ@@ ates synchron@@ izing mode when two folders are compared and no destination folder is specified . the results of mer@@ ging files are saved in both folders . this option is switched off in the default setting .
&quot; if there are differences , instead of mer@@ ging , copying the newer file is suggested as an action . ( this is considered in@@ secure , because it is assumed that the other file has not been changed . ) This option is switched off in any case . ) This option is switched off . &quot;
&quot; if a file or folder is replaced or deleted by another , then the original version is ren@@ amed and gets the extension .@@ orig@@ . if an old backup file is already existing with the .@@ ori@@ g extension , this will also affect the normal merge of individual files , not only the merge of entire folders . this option is switched on in default . &quot;
&quot; normally , the folder mer@@ ging view remains visible to the mer@@ ging of individual files ; you can switch the window divi@@ der with the mouse . if you do not want it , you can switch the main window in the window menu and switch between the two views by changing the directory &amp; text window . &quot;
&quot; you probably prefer to compare a file with double @-@ click . however , there is also a corresponding menu entry in the directory -@@ menu . once you save the result , the status will be set to er@@ mon , and the file will not be merged again if you start the folder merge . &quot;
&quot; however , this status is lost if you read the directory again : directory menu : &quot;
K@@ DE supports network transparency using K@@ IO slaves . K@@ Diff@@ 3 uses this to read files and folders . in this way you can specify files and folders to open which are located on local or remote hosts .
the first command line compar@@ es a local file with one on an FTP server . the second command line compar@@ es a folder inside a compressed archive with a local folder .
a URL has a different syntax than local files and folders . a few things should be observed :
&quot; a path may be relatively und@@ . or .. included . this is not possible with URLs , these are always absolutely . &quot;
&quot; special characters must be mas@@ ked . ( # - &gt; % 23 , blank &gt; % 20 , etc . ) . for example , a file named / # fo@@ o # the URL file : / % 23@@ fo@@ o % 23 . &quot;
&quot; sometimes due to the file system on the server , sometimes by the protocol used . it follows a short list of limitations : &quot;
&quot; or it cannot be distinguished whether a link appears on a file or a folder . then a file is always accepted as a link target . ( FTP : , s@@ ft@@ p : ) . &quot;
&quot; there is no way to edit per@@ missions or change date . therefore , the per@@ missions or change date from the original . ( note the option of Con@@ fi@@ dence of the size . ) ( This is only possible with local files . ) &quot;
&quot; the main purpose is currently as a difference viewer in K@@ DE@@ VEL@@ OP . K@@ DE@@ VEL@@ OP always starts the built @-@ in difference viewer . to start K@@ Diff@@ 3 , press the right mouse button on the difference viewer and then select In K@@ Diff@@ 3@@ Part from the context menu . &quot;
&quot; normally , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; two complete input files . if it is applied as a part , the input file is a patch file in unified format . at least one of the two files must exist . then start &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the patch to restore the missing file . &quot;
&quot; in the Kon@@ quer@@ or , you can click on a patch file and preview it from the context menu . please note that this doesn &apos;t work if none of the original files exist . furthermore , this is un@@ reliable if the original files have changed since the patch file has been created . &quot;
&quot; if &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; as part is executed , it only supports comparing two files , a very small toolbar and menu . mer@@ ging or comparing folders is not supported in the K@@ Part mode . &quot;
&quot; tools with the name K@@ Di@@ ff and K@@ Diff@@ 2 ( now Hei@@ st es Comp@@ are ) are already available . furthermore , the name K@@ Diff@@ 3 already points out that it can merge together like the program diff@@ 3 from the Di@@ ff tool collection . &quot;
I &apos;ve been using GPL programs very long and have learned a lot by looking into the sources of other programs . this is my thank you to all programm@@ ers who have gone this way or going to it .
&quot; you have compiled the program from the sources and probably not have the right pre@@ fix to K@@ DE . in default configure configure in / usr / local , but then K@@ DE can &apos;t find the resources for the user interfaces ( e.g. k@@ diff@@ 3@@ u@@ i.@@ rc ) . in the RE@@ A@@ DM@@ E file you will find more information on this topic . &quot;
&quot; if only a number of white signs is different , these lines are treated as identical ; if only a non @-@ white sign is different , the line will be treated as not identical . if similar lines are often next to each other , this mode is often the case . &quot;
&quot; the editor notices for any difference in the files where it starts and where it ends . however , this important information is lost if the result is simply stored as a text file and it is too much effort to create an extra file format that could save this information . &quot;
the expense for this has so far been too big . you can always restore a specific version by selecting a source A / B / C . to edit larger quantities of text a different editor should be used .
&quot; after removing text is suddenly lt ; no src has left ; released , and the text cannot be deleted . what does that mean and how can that be removed ? &quot;
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; uses already many colors to highlight differences . even more high@@ lighting would be conf@@ using and l@@ acks the purpose . please use another editor .
many good ideas and bug reports came from colleagues and many people from the Wild Wild Web . thank you !
&quot; to use all functions of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 , you need &amp; k@@ de ; 3.1 or later . &quot;
information on how to use K@@ Diff@@ 3 on other platforms without K@@ DE can be found on the homepage .
a list of recent changes can be found at http : / / k@@ diff@@ 3.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net / Ch@@ ange@@ Log or in Ch@@ ange@@ Log in the Qu@@ ell package .
&quot; to compile and install on a system with &amp; k@@ de ; to compile and install , use the following command in the base folder of the &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; -@@ Distribution : &quot;
&quot; K@@ DE @-@ dir marks the folder in your system installed in the K@@ DE . if you are unsure , you will find more details in the RE@@ A@@ DM@@ E file . &quot;
&quot; da &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; auto@@ conf and autom@@ ake uses , you should have no problems when comp@@ iling . however , if difficulties pers@@ ist , please report on the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ mailing lists of it . &quot;
cut out ( Ctr@@ l @-@ X or Shift @-@ Rem@@ ove ) copies to the clip@@ board and delet@@ es the selected text . insert ( Ctr@@ l @-@ V or Shift inser@@ tion ) inserts the text from the clip@@ board to the current cursor position or replaces the current mark .
&quot; show only differences : files identical in all folders do not appear in the folder structure , and therefore not in the destination folder . &quot;
&quot; ( in the current program version , you will need to re @-@ read the folder with the function after changes to these options ) . &quot;
&quot; if the destination folder does not already contain these files , they will not be copied to the destination folder . if the destination folder does not already contain these files , they are missing after mer@@ ging . ( the behavior is probably changed in a later program version ) . &quot;
&quot; note the buttons to select the source with the label A , B and C below the menu bar . if you click on one of the buttons , the rows from the corresponding window will be attached to the end of the selected group in the result window ( if they are not already available ) . if the lines are already present , they will be removed again when clicking the button again . &quot;
&quot; in default , this option is de@@ activated . differences in individual characters ( such as &apos; A &apos; and &apos; a &apos; ) are treated like differences in white signs . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; shows a mini preview of all virtual des@@ kt@@ ops . it is quite convenient to see the running programs on the desktop , to change their size , to stop them or move them . this works both inside a desktop and at several . &quot;
the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; can display all virtual des@@ kt@@ ops and applications running in it . applications can be selected and even moved on the desktop and on the other .
&quot; with the middle mouse button , windows can be moved within &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; movement is possible both within a desktop and on other working areas . &quot;
&quot; the context menu depends on where the right mouse button cli@@ cked : when cli@@ cked on the empty background of &amp; K@@ p@@ ager , the context menu only has to set up the two entries P@@ ager . if however , the icon and the name of the application as well as the entries minim@@ ise , Maxim@@ ize , On Desktop and Finish . the commands effect the following : &quot;
maxim@@ izes the application window to the full size of the desktop . only appears when cli@@ cked on an application .
sends the application to the selected virtual desktop . only appears when cli@@ cked on an application .
&quot; if this check box is selected , Windows can be moved within the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; s with the middle mouse button on the desktop and also moved to other des@@ kt@@ ops . &quot;
&quot; if this field is checked , in &amp; K@@ p@@ ager , the names of virtual des@@ kt@@ ops are displayed . &quot;
&quot; cross this field leaves the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; show the numbers of the virtual des@@ kt@@ ops . if it is shown together with name , the names are indicated with the order numbers , &amp; eg ; 1 . desktop . &quot;
&quot; if this field is checked , the background of each desktop will also be displayed as background in the &amp; box . &quot;
&quot; if this field is checked , the running programs are displayed as small windows in &amp; box ; otherwise only the empty work surfaces are displayed to enable their selection . &quot;
here the view of the program window is selected . simply displays simple rec@@ tan@@ gles with the proportions of the program window . icon displays the window with its default symbol and Pix@@ map shows a small view of the actual program window . note : Pix@@ map is recommended only for very fast systems .
&quot; here , the arrangement of the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; main window can be determined : classi@@ cally , &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; in a 2x@@ n @-@ grid , like P@@ ager applications appear in some other window managers ; horizont@@ ally displays all virtual des@@ kt@@ ops in a vertical row , which is very good for viewing later@@ ally on the desktop . &quot;
the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; can be used as an alternative to the P@@ ager mini program in the control bar . it has the advantage that it can be changed in size that can display and move windows as symbols or with its contents . in addition it runs outside the control bar .
click the right mouse button within &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; and then set up sel@@ ector switch ... allows the dialog to appear .
&quot; currently , this cannot be changed in the dialog settings . however , you can do this manually : &quot;
&quot; open the file $ K@@ DE@@ HOME / share / config / k@@ pag@@ err@@ c with any text editor like e.g. &amp; ke@@ dit ; or vi@@ . if you do not have a write permission for the file , you must login to your system administrator . &quot;

&quot; this application is interesting for different users : these include artists , web designers and people with a visual disability . this documentation should be a complete manual for the use of &amp; k@@ mag . &quot;
&amp; k@@ mag ; is a very powerful application that is constantly expanded with new functions . it is optimized for use on high @-@ performance machines .
&quot; when you start &amp; k@@ mag , a window appears as above . the main window of &amp; k@@ mag ; shows the enlarged area of the screen . in the following , this window appears as a magni@@ fying window . &quot;
&quot; in the default setting increases &amp; k@@ mag ; the area around the mouse poin@@ ter like a moving magni@@ fying glass . alternatively , you can make a selected screen area in the magni@@ fying window ( selection box mode ) or the surroundings of the mouse poin@@ ter at the edge of the screen ( eg ; on the left margin of the screen ) . &quot;
&quot; you want to avoid the mouse poin@@ ter in the enlarged window , select the mouse cursor setting . please note that &amp; k@@ mag ; currently not able to detect the shape of the mouse poin@@ ter . this is always the standard k@@ de ; / Q@@ t ; mouse poin@@ ter . &quot;
&quot; in the selection box mode , you can adjust the selection window to your own needs . you can move it with the arrow keys and mouse buttons and change its size . this can be done in the following way : &quot;
&quot; move the cursor in the magni@@ fying window and hold the left mouse button pressed , so you can capture and move the contents of the magni@@ fying window . this also works with the arrow keys . &quot;
&quot; if you additionally press the &amp; Shift ; push button or the &amp; M@@ MB ; use , you can move the selection window . &quot;
&quot; with this combination , you can change the size of the selection window . note that the upper left corner of the selection window remains firm and only the lower right corner is to move . &quot;
&quot; you can send the enlarged picture directly to the printer , save to a file to paste into the clip@@ board ( to insert it later into other applications ) , rotate the image and much more . &quot;
starts or stops the update of the display . stopping the update causes the required CPU time against 0 .
&quot; choose the update rate ( Very low , Ger@@ ing , Medium , High , Very High ) . the higher the refres@@ h rate , the more CPU time is needed . &quot;
in this mode a selection window will appear . the selected area is displayed in a window .
&quot; &amp; k@@ mag ; automatically uses your set short@@ cuts to save files , opening a new window , printing , ne@@ ul@@ ads ( with the button Pu@@ t document in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; ) , En@@ large and Re@@ duction &amp; etc . &quot;
&quot; also known as &amp; k@@ magni@@ fier ; is a screen saver . you can use &amp; k@@ magni@@ fier ; use an area of the screen to view the small print in a newspaper or a photo . this application is for different people of use : from research or artist to web designer or visually handic@@ apped . &quot;
&quot; more detailed user documentation can be found with help : / k@@ mag ( enter this URL in the address bar of &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or , or run k@@ help@@ center help : / k@@ mag ) . &quot;
&amp; k@@ magni@@ fier ; was developed by Olaf Schmidt o@@ j@@ sch@@ midt @ k@@ de@@ .org and Sar@@ ang Lak@@ are Sar@@ ang @ user@@ s.@@ sf@@ .net and Michael For@@ ster for@@ ester @ f@@ mi@@ .@@ uni @-@ pass@@ au@@ .de .
&amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; em@@ ulates a mouse click once the mouse poin@@ ter a@@ waiting a while at the same place . it is meant to help people suffering from the R@@ SI syndrome ( Rep@@ eti@@ tive Stra@@ in In@@ jury syndrome ) and which each mouse click pain@@ s .
&quot; it is intended to help people who suffer from the Rep@@ eti@@ tive Stra@@ in In@@ jury ( R@@ SI ) syndrome and which each mouse click pain@@ s pain . furthermore , it can em@@ ulate the pulling with the mouse . this requires a little exercise . &quot;
&quot; suffer from pain associated with the use of your computer , you should consult a doctor if this is not yet done . &quot;
&quot; to make it even clear@@ er : even if &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; avoiding pain , which is caused by clicking with the mouse , it is useless against pain caused by moving the mouse , and as with all ergonomic auxiliary equipment : the result can be different for everyone . &quot;
the use of &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; is simple : &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; super@@ vis@@ es your mouse movements and takes a mouse click as soon as you break the movement shortly .
&quot; the intelligent move activ@@ ates , makes &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; pause after it em@@ ulates the pressing of the mouse button . this way you can drag the drag@@ ging with pressed mouse button . the intelligent move requires a little exercise , but you get used quickly . &quot;
&quot; this extension period must pass after the end of the mouse movement , before &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; a mouse click exp@@ ires . &quot;
&quot; here the time is set , the &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; after pressing the mouse button wa@@ its , before releasing the mouse button again , if there is no evidence of the mouse . &quot;
&quot; these movements are saved in the file $ K@@ DE@@ HOME / share / config / km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool _ stro@@ k@@ es.@@ txt , if &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; the first time is started , but they can be changed later . &quot;
&quot; when the sound is delayed , you can &amp; k@@ de ; move the response time to shor@@ ten . open the Sound System and here the tab . there is a slider sound buffer that you set to a lower value to shor@@ ten the response times . &quot;
&quot; this setting is marked , is &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; at each start of &amp; k@@ de ; started . this function is currently only under &amp; k@@ de ; available . at G@@ NO@@ ME or other window environments , please consult the respective documentation to find out how to start a program automatically . &quot;
&quot; set all settings to the values that were set when opening the dialog . if you have already pressed the user button , the settings are reset to the date after the last pressing of App@@ ly . &quot;
&quot; best use &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; first with the pres@@ ets . in particular , the smart move should first be switched off . if you get used to the automatic mouse click , you can later move the smart move . &quot;
&quot; if you use the audi@@ ble click , it is necessary to reduce the response times of &amp; k@@ de ; with sounds . &quot;
you can therefore park your mouse in such places until you want to use it again .
&quot; if your mouse bu@@ cks , you should clean your mouse . that &apos;s usually pretty simple . the trick is that you can not only clean the mouse h@@ emisph@@ ere , but also the rollers that come into contact with the mouse . &quot;
&quot; first you need to remove the mouse button . as this happens , mouse to mouse is different . however , it should be quick to see if you look at the bottom of the mouse . &quot;
&quot; if you have removed the ball , you would have to see the rolls . these are located on the sides of the hole in which the ball was inserted . the dirt and the dirt can easily scr@@ ape with a flat blade or the f@@ ing@@ ern@@ ail . &quot;
&quot; in very rare situations , the operating system breaks the execution of &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; if you &apos;re using the smart move , this means that &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; the operation cannot be stopped by releasing the mouse button . &quot;
this happens if you use &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; use under another window manager and move a window .
&quot; the solution for this problem is that you can execute a mouse click . this will return the status of &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool , and you can continue working as usual . &quot;
&quot; problem : if you enter text , try &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; continue to execute mouse clicks and put the cursor to another place . &quot;
&quot; solution : use the mouse to place the cursor there where you want to have it . however , you can &apos;t use the mouse on a neutral area of the desktop when you want to have a keyboard input . secure zones for the mouse poin@@ ter are &amp; eg ; the gray surfaces around the toolbar and menus and the head@@ lines of windows . &quot;
&quot; I try to work with the smart move , but I don &apos;t manage to edit text . &quot;
&quot; the intelligent shift is an advanced function of &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; and it takes its time before you want to handle it . it is very probably possible to copy it to the clip@@ board , to copy it to the clip@@ board . but it will probably only get problems with you . here are some advice : &quot;
&quot; do not use the smart move if you just start using it . instead , select a mouse click on the end of the text area and hold down the Shift key while you move the cursor to the other end of the text and press the mouse button again . &quot;
&quot; use the audi@@ ble mouse click . thus every time , when &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; the mouse button supp@@ resses a sound like a mouse click . so you know exactly when you move the shifting time when you move your smart move . however , you can use the smart move even without the audi@@ ble mouse click . but this requires some practice . &quot;
&quot; to use &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; use the X@@ test extension for &amp; X Window , which should be the case on most systems . &quot;
the functionality of the audi@@ ble mouse clicks is only available when the system has a sound card and a speaker and is properly set up .
&quot; &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; pressing the mouse button once the mouse cursor is short , this program has been developed for people suffering from the R@@ SI syndrome and those who suffer the pressing of the Mau@@ sta@@ sten pain . &quot;
&amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; can also be configured so that there is a certain time waiting for a pulling process begins before the mouse button is released . in this way also drag@@ ging and laying with the mouse can be performed .

&amp; k@@ mouth ; is a program that can let silent users talk to their computer for themselves .
&quot; with the program &amp; k@@ mouth , dum@@ b users can let the computer speak for themselves . the user can choose from a list of phrases that are to be discussed again . &quot;
&quot; on the first page of the wizard ( left screen shot ) , enter the command that will be used later for the speech output of text . for more details see the description of the installation catalogue . &quot;
&quot; on the second page , select the standard text pass@@ age@@ book . from the text@@ box books you can often choose text passages without having to type them . the passages can be edited naturally . &quot;
&quot; on the third page ( right screen shot ) you determine the dictionary for the dictionary . &amp; k@@ mouth ; reads the K@@ DE documentation of the selected language to determine the frequency of each word . in addition , you can synchron@@ ize the word@@ lists with an Open@@ Offic@@ e.org dictionary , so that only correctly sp@@ elled words can be recorded in the dictionary . &quot;
the main window of &amp; k@@ mouth ; is clearly arranged and essentially contains a input field for the keyboard input of your pro@@ positions ( the lower white field in the screen@@ shot ) and a running memory of the already spoken pro@@ positions ( the upper white field in the screen@@ shot ) .
&quot; in the input field , you can enter the sentences you want to hear . each spoken proposition is attached to the cache . you can choose sentences which are to be spoken once again . &quot;
&quot; with the menu entry settings k@@ mouth ; set up ... open the Settings dialog from &amp; k@@ mouth ; . this dialog contains two cards , voice output and settings , page word@@ - and the page K@@ TT@@ SD language service . &quot;
&quot; in the text@@ box input field , enter the command to call the language generator . in the drop @-@ down box below the input field , you specify the string encoding , with the text passed to the language generator . &quot;
&amp; ts@@ mouth ; knows two ways to pass the text . select the check box if the text remains unchanged as default input to the language generator .
&quot; if the check box is not selected , the text will be passed as parameters . you can use the following plac@@ eholders : &quot;
&quot; of course , the command will depend on your language generator . you will find this command in the documentation about your language generator . examples for this can be found in the app@@ endix . &quot;
&quot; if this is successful , the further settings on this page will be ignored . the kt@@ s@@ d language service is a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ D@@ äm@@ on , the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ applications are a standardized interface for voice output . the option of this option is useful , even if K@@ TT@@ SD is not installed . &quot;
&quot; with the first selection field action after selecting a text passage you determine which action is triggered by the keyboard short@@ cut , or by selecting a text passage in the text@@ box book or in the bar for text passages . &quot;
&quot; when selecting In the input field , the selected text passage is inserted directly into the input field . with the selection of In the input field , the selected text passage is entered at first only in the input field . &quot;
&quot; with the second selection field closing of the editing window for text passages , you can determine if the text pass@@ age@@ book is to be automatically saved when closing the editing window . &quot;
&quot; when you choose to store text passages , the book is saved . if you select any changes , the text@@ book &apos;s text@@ book will not be saved . select Before Save , will &amp; k@@ mouth ; ask if the text pass@@ book @-@ book is to be saved . &quot;
&quot; page Wor@@ ter@@ gän@@ ger contains a list of dic@@ tion@@ aries for the dictionary . in the main window next to the input field indicates &amp; k@@ mouth ; a drop @-@ down box , if this list contains more than one dictionary . with this drop @-@ down box , you can choose the currently used dictionary for the dictionary . &quot;
&quot; with the buttons on the right side of the page you can delete or add dic@@ tion@@ aries , change the order of the books or export them to a file . below the list , you can set the language for the dictionary in the input field . &quot;
&quot; in addition , you can compare the word@@ list with an Open@@ Offic@@ e.org dictionary to insert correctly written words into the new dictionary . &quot;
&quot; with this option , you can merge the available dic@@ tion@@ aries . &amp; k@@ mouth ; ask which dic@@ tion@@ aries are merged , and how they should be weigh@@ ted . &quot;
&quot; this option lets you create a new , empty dictionary without entries . da &amp; k@@ mouth ; newly entered words automatically add to the dictionary , create a dictionary with your vocabulary . &quot;
the main area of the window to edit text passages is divided into two . in the upper part the text passages are represented as tree structure .
&quot; in the lower part you can edit a selected entry . if you select a text passage , you can change the text passage or the associated keyboard short@@ cut . if you select a text passages , you can only change its name . &quot;
&quot; add actions such as new passages or books , or delete selected text passages and books , you can either access the menu bar , toolbar , or a drop @-@ down menu . &quot;
the order of text passages or passages can be changed by drag@@ ging with the mouse to the new location or with the arrow keys and the &amp; Alt ; key .
&quot; the selected text is cut out and copied to the clip@@ board . if a text section is selected in the input field , it will be used , otherwise the selected areas of the repository . &quot;
&quot; the selected text is copied to the clip@@ board . if a text section is selected in the input field , it will be used , otherwise the selected areas of the repository . &quot;
&quot; the currently active sentence is spoken . if text is in the input field , it is used , otherwise the selected pro@@ positions of the repository . &quot;
&quot; the toolbar is displayed by default over the editing pane , directly under the menu bar . by clicking on the hat@@ ched left side and drag@@ ging the toolbar can be moved to another location . &quot;
&quot; if this menu entry is enabled , a narrow bar is displayed in the lower part of the main window with indications of the status of &amp; k@@ mouth ; shown if not checked , this status bar is hidden . &quot;
&quot; the bar is arranged by default over the editing window directly under the toolbar . by clicking on the hat@@ ched left side and drag@@ ging , the toolbar can be moved to another location . &quot;
&quot; probably you have not entered the command for voice output correctly or not completely . open Pre@@ ferences , open the General Settings page and enter the command for voice output on the card voice output . ( see Setting dialog for voice syn@@ thesizer for more details . ) &quot;
&quot; Festival is a voice @-@ overs system from the University of Edinburgh . currently only English , Spanish and Spanish are supported . &quot;
&quot; to show an example of the command line for setting the voice output , it is assumed that the festival is installed in / usr / local / festival . the command for voice output is : &quot;
Free@@ T@@ TS is a language generator written in &amp; Java . currently it only supports the English language . the license allows it to use Free@@ T@@ TS for free and to spread without restrictions .
&quot; to show an example of the command line for setting up the voice output , it is assumed that Free@@ T@@ TS is installed in the / usr / local / fre@@ etts file . the voice output is then possible with one of the three following command examples : &quot;
&quot; for the third example , the option must be switched on as default input . ( this is the recommended example for the application of Free@@ T@@ TS . ) &quot;
&quot; MB@@ RO@@ LA is a language generator for many languages . it converts a list of phon@@ em@@ es into a Wav@@ ed@@ at@@ ei , so you need an additional program to break the text in phon@@ em@@ es . the license allows it to use MB@@ RO@@ LA for free for non @-@ commercial and non @-@ military applications . &quot;
&quot; in our example , H@@ adi@@ fax is used to convert German text to Ph@@ on@@ eme for MB@@ RO@@ LA , assuming that H@@ adi@@ fax and MB@@ RO@@ LA are installed in / usr / local / hadi@@ fax and / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately H@@ adi@@ fax likes to swal@@ low the last character of the text , so an additional character has to be added . therefore , the full command is more elaborate than in the other examples : &quot;
( Cat - ; echo quot ; &amp; quot ; ) _ BAR _ / usr / local / hadi@@ fax / t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o -@@ f _ BAR _ / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA / MB@@ RO@@ LA -@@ e / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v ; r@@ m / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v
all parts of the command must be written in one line . the option to send data as default input must be enabled .
&quot; the voice @-@ out dem@@ on of &amp; k@@ de ; ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) is a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ further language service , which provides a standard interface for voice output . K@@ TT@@ SD is currently being developed in SV@@ N . it uses modules to support different voice output systems . &quot;
&quot; since the language generator setting is only done in the K@@ TT@@ SD , you only need to use possible kt@@ d as a language service in &amp; k@@ mouth . &quot;
&quot; to setup , use the K@@ TT@@ SD language service , which appears in the settings dialog from &amp; k@@ mouth ; appears when K@@ TT@@ SD is installed . &quot;
&quot; around &amp; k@@ mouth ; successfully use , you need a language generator ( and of course &amp; k@@ de ; 3.@@ x ) . &amp; k@@ mouth ; requires about 15 MB memory ( and additionally memory for the language generator ) , which depends on your computer and its configuration . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an application , with the people who cannot speak text by the computer . it is saved a list of already spoken pro@@ positions , which the user can always make new editions . &quot;
note that &amp; ts@@ mouth ; no voice syn@@ thesizer . on the computer a voice syn@@ thesizer must be installed .
&quot; more detailed user documentation can be found with help : / k@@ mouth ( enter either this URL in the address bar of &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or , or start k@@ help@@ center help : / k@@ mouth ) . &quot;
&amp; kt@@ ops ; - the voice output system of &amp; k@@ de ; - is a module of existing service that allows any application to read text about the &amp; D@@ Bus ; interface .
&amp; kt@@ ops ; is a sub @-@ system in &amp; k@@ de ; for voice output ( T@@ TS ) . it provides a common application interface for &amp; k@@ de ; programm@@ ers ready to be equipped with their applications with T@@ TS capability . users also offer interesting opportunities .
&quot; reading texts ( or parts thereof ) in the text editor &amp; are therefore , even if &amp; are therefore ; in other &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ applications embedded . &quot;
&quot; speech speech takes place via the speech speech dispens@@ er , which uses different background program such as e@@ Speak , festival , &amp; etc . &quot;
enables the generation of language editions on the command line ( or with shell scripts ) via the &amp; q@@ d@@ bus ; tool .
&quot; in ZU@@ K@@ UN@@ FT : support for Speech mark@@ up languages such as Vo@@ ic@@ e@@ XML , S@@ able , &amp; Java ; Speech @-@ Mark@@ up @-@ Language ( J@@ SML ) , and Speech @-@ Mark@@ up @-@ Meta @-@ Language ( SM@@ ML ) . &quot;
&quot; the voice @-@ overs service of &amp; k@@ de ; , an application without visible windows , the T@@ TS services over &amp; D@@ Bus ; offers . &quot;
an application with &amp; GUI ; for configuration and setup of kt@@ ts@@ d over kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr in the system section .
a module for web browser &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; for reading the texts of a web page or parts thereof .
&quot; a module for the text editor &amp; are therefore , with which a text file can be read completely or partially . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the Bug@@ z@@ illa database of &amp; k@@ de ; ( http : / / bug@@ s.@@ k@@ de@@ .org / ) , discussions about &amp; kt@@ ts ; in the k@@ de @-@ based mailing list place . subscribe to the list via https : / / mail@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org / mail@@ man / list@@ info / k@@ de @-@ Kommentar . you can also find the developer at IR@@ C ( ir@@ c.@@ k@@ de@@ .org , channel # k@@ de ) . &quot;
&quot; before you use &amp; kt@@ ts ; use , you need to install program speech dispens@@ ers and adjust properly . see also &quot;
&quot; at the first start of t@@ ts@@ m@@ gr or as long as no speakers are set up , the card card speaker is displayed . see also . if you have set up at least one speaker , the map card is displayed in general . see . &quot;
&quot; most T@@ TS syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers offer different languages and voices , as well as different male or female , or those that differ in volume or speed . you should at least set up a speaker before you use &amp; kt@@ ts ; use , since the program speed Dis@@ pat@@ cher otherwise uses the standard speaker . &quot;
different speakers for the same syn@@ thesizer are comparable to several printers for the same printer .
&quot; if you click on the card driver speaker in kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr , the card card is displayed . it will then automatically appear when you start stor@@ ts@@ m@@ gr and no speaker is set up . &quot;
all already furnished speakers appear in this list . the preferred speakers appear at the top of the list . the top speaker is used for voice output if an application does not exist .
&quot; select a speaker from the list by clicking on this button , and click this button to remove the speaker from the list . &quot;
&quot; with a mouse click , select a speaker from the list and click on this button to change the settings . see below . &quot;
&quot; with a mouse click , select a speaker from the list , and click on this button to move the speaker in the list below . the order of the speakers in the list also determines their priority . &quot;
click on one of these buttons to apply your changes to the current &amp; kt@@ ops ; system .
&quot; select a type of voice here , there are three male and three female voices as well as a boys and girls voice . &quot;
&quot; if you click here , the new speaker will appear on the map speaker . to change the settings of this speaker , click Edit . &quot;
now you can use &amp; kt@@ ops ; already almost use . go back to the map General and check if language output is enabled ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) is enabled so that the T@@ TS service from &amp; k@@ de ; start . see . now you can use &amp; kt@@ ts ; use to read and manage text orders . see .
&quot; if you have at least one speaker set up , you can start the language output system from &amp; k@@ de ; click on the map tab General to open this map . here you can set some general options . &quot;
&quot; check this check box to activate the &amp; kt@@ ops ; this starts the K@@ DE @-@ T@@ TS service ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) . if this start is successful , the Map card will be displayed and you can create text orders and read the T@@ TS system from &amp; k@@ de ; de@@ activated . &quot;
&quot; when t@@ ts@@ m@@ gr is terminated , runs &amp; kt@@ ts ; next , if the field is enabled ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) . &quot;
&quot; if this check box is marked and kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr will appear automatically in the system area of the control bar , it dis@@ appears once the pre @-@ read is completed . &quot;
&quot; with the buttons in this row you can start text orders , cancel , stop and res@@ ume . &quot;
&quot; with the buttons in this series , you can read the current text in the &amp; k@@ de ; clip@@ board , or open a text file to read . you can also change the speaker for an order . &quot;
&quot; click App@@ ly or OK , then all changed settings are taken on all sides . &quot;
&quot; the card card orders will only be displayed when K@@ TT@@ SD is started . to start K@@ TT@@ SD , click on the General tab and check out language output ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; , the web browser of &amp; k@@ de ; , you can read the text of the displayed web page . then check the text you want to read , and select the text you want to read in the main menu . after a short time , the voice output should begin . &quot;
&quot; it is almost always useful to mark the desired text of a website . you can also ski@@ p this step , but then many &amp; HTML ; -@@ pre@@ tension lines and other invisible brands are also read . &quot;
&quot; then check the text you want to read , and select the text you want to read , and select the language output from the main menu . then the voice output should begin . &quot;
&quot; this also works if &amp; are therefore ; embedded in other applications , such as &amp; eg ; in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; or in &amp; Qu@@ anta ; . &quot;
K@@ Noti@@ fy is the news system of &amp; k@@ de ; you will be notified of events specified by you . you can read the text of these messages also by &amp; kt@@ ops .
&quot; in &amp; kon@@ vers@@ ation ; , the IR@@ C program by &amp; k@@ de ; , you can set up different types of messages . for example , set up a message where your nick@@ name occurs . with &amp; kt@@ ops , you can then read the IR@@ C message text . &quot;
&quot; support a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ program K@@ not@@ fy , appears a menu entry noti@@ fications in the Settings menu of this program . the settings for K@@ Noti@@ fy differ depending on the application . &quot;
&quot; the file k@@ mail@@ .@@ x@@ ml , which is sent to the delivery of &amp; kt@@ ts ; is a good example . you remove the tags br and b from the messages sent by mail , and also the expression / local / in@@ box , as it can be accepted as provided in most cases as provided . &quot;
filters are one of the advanced capabilities of &amp; kt@@ ops ; . for normal work with &amp; kt@@ ops ; filter is not required .
&quot; in filters , text is edited before being sent to the program speech dispens@@ er . they are useful for improving the pr@@ on@@ unciation to replace wron@@ g@@ ly spoken words or abbrevi@@ ations , to select a suitable language and speaker , or to b@@ ypass certain short@@ com@@ ings of voice synthesis and their voices . &quot;
&quot; to understand the functioning of filters , it is important to know how the program &quot; speech dispens@@ ers &quot; works with a text . &amp; kt@@ ts ; differenti@@ ates four types of texts . &quot;
&quot; the output of screen re@@ a@@ ders has the highest priority . it is preferred to all other orders and keeps these orders . if the output of the screen reader is read , the orders are continued . &quot;
war@@ nings have the next priority . this level is important news as &amp; eg ; processor becomes too hot . a warning has priority and keeps the output of messages and normal text .
&quot; News have the next priority . a message inter@@ rup@@ ts normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example of an application that uses messages . while you are &amp; eg ; you can welcome a long text on a website , you can also welcome someone who is entering the room . &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ noti@@ fications are also messages . &quot;
&quot; the rest are simple text orders . each order you receive from the card card is a word order . K@@ Say@@ it is an example of a applications that uses text orders . text orders are intended for the output of longer texts , which have no special ur@@ gency . &quot;
&quot; all four orders are processed in queu@@ es , with the exception of the output of screen re@@ a@@ ders . if an application sends the output of a screen reader , while &amp; kt@@ ts ; just one such reads , this issue is stopped and terminated . &quot;
&quot; first you need to know that filters are never applied to the output of screen re@@ a@@ ders . they are applied to normal war@@ nings , messages and text orders as well as on &amp; k@@ de ; messages . &quot;
filter edit the text and pass it on to the next filter . currently there are three types of filters .
filters are designed as modules . in the future there can be further types of filters .
&quot; strings replace parts of a text by other text . the parts to replace can be supplied either as words or as regular expressions . &amp; kt@@ ts ; will be delivered with pre@@ defined string er@@ ections , which enable the creation of chat em@@ oti@@ cons such as : - ) by text or for converting messages from &amp; con@@ vers@@ ation ; or &amp; k@@ mail ; in a better intel@@ li@@ gible form . &quot;
&amp; XML ; conver@@ ters use an X@@ SL@@ T file ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) to convert &amp; XML ; from a format to another format .
&quot; for example , if you have set a female voice on the card speaker , you can read text from K@@ DE news about it . read about it . &quot;
&quot; each of these filters has adjustable rules , according to which it is applied to a voice output . if the filter determines that its rules are not applicable , it remains unchanged to the next filter . &quot;
&quot; when a text order , a message , warning or a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ noti@@ fications to &amp; kt@@ ts ; sent , it is edited by all filters activated on the page . editing by the filter takes place in the order in the list from top to bottom . &quot;
&quot; this shows the list of normal filters . if a filter is not enabled , it is not activated and is not used . &quot;
click here to insert a new filter . select the type of filter and the following setup di@@ alogs are shown below .
&quot; for setting strings template filters , you need to enter a list of words or regular expressions as comparison patterns . if these patterns are found in the text , the text is exchanged against the associated replacement text . &quot;
&quot; enter a name for your filter . you can choose this name as you want , it must be different from the names of the other filters . &quot;
this is the list of words and regular expressions . the filter compar@@ es the text with the strings in the column agreement and replaces it in accordance with the string from the column . the list is processed in the order from top to bottom .
click here to move the selected word or the regular expression in the list .
&quot; with these buttons you can load a list of words or regular expressions from a file , save or delete the current list . upload a list from a file , the entries from the file are app@@ ended to the existing list . &quot;
&quot; if a language is entered here , the filter is applied only if the spokes@@ man speaks for the text order one of the languages listed here . you can also select multiple languages if you click the &amp; Ctr@@ l key while clicking the button . &quot;
&quot; here a value is entered , the filter is applied only if the text comes from one of the specified applications . you can type several programs separated by comm@@ as . example : conversation , k@@ mail &quot;
&quot; the application ID running programs is available with the program q@@ d@@ bus ; . the &amp; D@@ Bus ; -@@ numbers must be om@@ itted . if for example &amp; q@@ d@@ bus ; the application ID copied @-@ 34@@ 32 indicates , you may only enter copied . &quot;
&quot; the string input filter is applied only to the text when all conditions apply with an entry in the box Di@@ esen Filter when matching . if all input fields are empty , the filter is applied to all texts . &quot;
&quot; in comparison of words , the string replace filter uses regular expressions in the form \ \ s word \ \ s. the words must therefore be limited by separ@@ ators ( spaces ) on both sides . &quot;
in this manual you will find no instructions for writing regular expressions . if you have installed the &amp; k@@ de ; Editor &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; expressions installed and # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; expressions can be found in the package k@@ deu@@ ti@@ ls .
&quot; X@@ SL@@ T ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) is a W3@@ C standard for such conver@@ sions . however , it can only be applied to well @-@ formed XML . x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c utility must be installed on your system . &quot;
&quot; enter the path for the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c program . if x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is accessible via the environment variable PAT@@ H , x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is also sufficient . &quot;
&quot; with the speaker select filter you can send text to a specific speaker , which is set up on the card speaker , or to a speaker with specific features . for example , you can specify that texts by k@@ mail should be read by a female voice . &quot;
&quot; the speaker is selected based on the speaker features , which gives the text to &amp; kt@@ ts ; sends , and the features of the speaker set up on the map card speaker . with the speaker select filter you can over@@ write the selected speaker . &quot;
&quot; if the text is entered here , the filter is applied if the text contains the entered regular expression . is installed on your system of the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Editor &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; expressions installed , you can access it by clicking on the button to get help when entering . &quot;
&quot; to achieve a faster processing , you should try to anchor the regular expression at the beginning of the string , i.e. , start the regular expression with &lt; ! &#91; CD@@ ATA &#91; ^ &#93; &#93; &gt; . &quot;
&quot; click on the button to the right , to display the dialog box selection . &quot;
use these buttons to save or load your speaker settings or delete all settings .
the selection dial filter is applied only to the text if all conditions apply with an entry in the box Di@@ esen Filter when applicable . you must enter at least one condition .
&quot; the voice @-@ overs API , by &amp; k@@ de ; , can give programm@@ ers their applications T@@ TS skills . applications communicate with K@@ TT@@ SD via &amp; D@@ Bus ; . &quot;
&quot; the K@@ TT@@ SD module API , added with the voice syn@@ thesizer to K@@ TT@@ SD , so that &amp; kt@@ ts ; this syn@@ thesizer can be used . &quot;
the following section contains a short description of the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ D@@ Bus ; interface of the language output API of &amp; k@@ de ; . the complete documentation for both AP@@ Is can be found on the k@@ de ; Acces@@ sibility website ( http : / / acc@@ essi@@ bil@@ ity.@@ k@@ de@@ .org ) .
applications demand voice output via the &amp; D@@ Bus ; -@@ Interface from &amp; k@@ de ; from the program kt@@ ts@@ d via the object K@@ Speech .
&quot; text of the text for reading and option is a language code such as &amp; eg ; en , de &amp; etc ; &quot;
there are even more commands that you can use . for a list of all commands you enter
open Two &amp; Con@@ sole ; -@@ Windows . first run t@@ ts@@ d in a window and then t@@ ts@@ m@@ gr on the other .
none of the known voice syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers supports my language . where can I get a syn@@ thesizer for my language ?
&quot; I have set up the &amp; HTML ; -@@ XML ; -@@ re@@ form@@ er@@ filter , but when using the module for festival websites are not read . &quot;
&quot; because of an error in festival 1.@@ 95 beta you need to install the ( male British ) voice ra@@ b _ di@@ phone , so SA@@ BLE can work at all . you must also make sure that the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is installed and can be found via the environment variable PAT@@ H . &quot;
&quot; certain signs or punc@@ tu@@ ation marks seem to cause errors in syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers , so all pro@@ positions are ski@@ pped or only b@@ anded jewels . what can I do against it ? &quot;
&quot; first , make sure that the string coding option is set to the correct language for the corresponding language . if there are problems with certain characters or words , these may be fixed by a string creation filter . see . &quot;

&quot; the voice syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers used by &amp; kt@@ ops ; have their own license , which you can find in the related documentation or on the respective websites . there are also voices that have their own license . &quot;
&quot; if you have access to the K@@ DE source code archive , you can download the package with &amp; kt@@ ops ; from it you can download the package . furthermore , you will find the source code of k@@ de@@ centralized under ft@@ p : / / ft@@ p.@@ k@@ de@@ .org / pub / k@@ de / . &quot;

&quot; K@@ T@@ TS works with any voice syn@@ thesizer , which can be started on the command line in a &amp; console . &quot;
&quot; the list of languages above can be incomplete or de@@ prec@@ ated . therefore , consult the description of the syn@@ thesizer to the supported languages . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; speech @-@ Dis@@ pat@@ cher &quot; program uses an adap@@ table module architecture for voice syn@@ thesizer . if you would like to extend &amp; kt@@ t ; for the use of another syn@@ thesizer , contact the developer team . &quot;
Debian users can install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c with the apt @-@ get install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c command .
&quot; to compile , you need a current development environment of K@@ DE ( version 3.4 or newer ) including packages k@@ deli@@ bs and the development files for the program &quot; speech dispens@@ er . &quot; &quot;
&quot; if you have downloaded the source code from &amp; kt@@ ts ; from the source code archive for k@@ de@@ code , or download the T@@ arb@@ all the night currently created , compile and install the program using the following commands : &quot;
&quot; before you use &amp; kt@@ TS , first check if speech dispens@@ ers work properly with your voice syn@@ thesizer . to do this , you can use the shell script sp@@ d @-@ conf . &quot;
&amp; kt@@ ops ; in &amp; k@@ de ; 4.4 is the first version of &amp; kt@@ ops ; the program t@@ ms@@ gr is to be developed so that the setting of speech dispens@@ ers is directly possible and the script sp@@ d @-@ conf is no longer required .
&quot; a long text is divided into individual pro@@ positions . the user can go back to sentence or set @-@ up , repeat , pause or cancel the issue . &quot;
&quot; for example , if you have set up a speaker whose language is English and its gender is female , it is used , otherwise the best matching speaker is chosen . if you want to know more about how &amp; kt@@ ops ; select a speaker , see in . &quot;
&quot; if you click Add button on the map , and in order to insert a speaker into the list or click Edit , the map card speaker setup will be displayed . for example , the setup of the module for Festival Interactive is shown below . details of the modules can be found below . &quot;
&quot; enter the path to the exec@@ utable festival program . if the path to the festival is included in PAT@@ H , you just have to enter festival . &quot;
&quot; select the encoding for text that is passed to the festival . for voices , the &amp; kt@@ ops ; known , this setting is done automatically . generally , Western languages are using ISO 8859 @-@ 1 , Eastern languages like Czech or Slovak use ISO 8859 @-@ 2 . &quot;
&quot; with these sli@@ ders , you can adjust the volume , speech speed and pitch of the synthetic language . if you cannot select a number of controllers and display this gray , the voice you choose does not allow you to select these settings . &quot;
&quot; some votes such as Multi@@ Sy@@ n votes need several seconds to load . if you mark this check box , these voices are already loaded at the start of K@@ TT@@ SD so that ( higher memory usage ) the first set will be syn@@ thes@@ ized faster . &quot;
&quot; if this check box cannot be selected , you have not yet set up a speaker ( or forgot to click App@@ ly ) . &quot;
&quot; if this check box is selected , the program window is displayed in the start of kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr . otherwise , after starting the symbol t@@ m@@ gr is visible in the system section , but not the program window . click on the icon in the section section to view the program window . &quot;
&quot; if this check box is marked and kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr does not yet run , it appears in the system area as soon as K@@ TT@@ SD reads a text . thus , you have the possibility to stop reading or otherwise control . &quot;
&quot; here are all orders listed in the queu@@ e , along with the application that has set the order , the current status of the order , the number of pro@@ positions and the just processed phrase . the or@@ ator ID corresponds to the column ID on the card speaker . &quot;
&quot; with the buttons in this row , you can proceed on the order that is selected in the list below , pre@@ - or return . ( but not every order consists of several sentences ) . &quot;
with a click on the OK all changes in the settings ( also on the other cards ) are taken over and t@@ ts@@ m@@ gr will be reduced to the symbol in the system section . then click on this icon to display the program window .
&quot; if the sound system &amp; arts ; not installed , but instead AL@@ SA , G@@ Stre@@ amer or a@@ Ko@@ de , click on the audio card audio . see also . &quot;
&quot; here only text orders are listed and managed . issues of screen re@@ a@@ ders , war@@ nings and messages will not be displayed . more information about the news types of &amp; kt@@ ops ; find in . &quot;
&quot; select the type of audio output here . if a component cannot be selected , then &amp; kt@@ ts ; either compiled without support for the corresponding audio module or &amp; Desktop ; may not load the necessary libraries . &quot;
&quot; if you want to use G@@ stre@@ amer or a@@ Ko@@ de for audio output , select the audio output here . if no output modules are displayed in the list , you have to install at least one module . if you have selected AL@@ SA , select the PC@@ M device here . &quot;
&quot; set the intercom speed here . 50@@ nbsp ; % corresponds roughly half and 200@@ g ; % roughly the double normal speaking speed . in order to enable these settings to be implemented , the program must be so@@ x installed . &quot;
click App@@ ly to take over the new settings for the current &amp; Desktop .
the list of AL@@ SA devices includes all PC@@ M devices and modules installed in your system . most of them will not work . you need to find out which device works with you . in doubt choose standard .
&quot; on this card , you can set up special actions that will always be executed when the text order is interrupted by a message with higher priority . &amp; kt@@ ts ; handles four types of language assignments : &quot;
&quot; the output of screen re@@ a@@ ders has the highest priority . it is preferred to all other orders and keeps these orders . after the output of the screen reader has been read , the orders received will be res@@ um@@ ed . &quot;
war@@ nings have the next priority . this level is important news as &amp; eg ; processor is reserved to hot . a warning keeps the output of messages and normal text .
&quot; News have the next priority . a message inter@@ rup@@ ts normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example of an application that appe@@ als to messages . if you want to read a long text on a website , you can welcome to &amp; k@@ mouth ; nevertheless , welcome someone who is entering the room . &quot;
&quot; a text order is interrupted by a message , warning or output of a screen reader , adds &amp; kt@@ ts ; the audio output to the queu@@ e . &quot;
&quot; this audio file is always played when a normal word order is interrupted . if both introduc@@ tory sound and introduc@@ tory message are active , the introduc@@ tory sound is played before the introduc@@ tory message . &quot;
&quot; the settings on this map only apply to normal text orders . for news , war@@ nings and the issues of screen readers , there are no special promotions , if they are interrupted by a message with higher priority . &quot;
&quot; to start with &amp; kt@@ ops ; to read K@@ not@@ fy news , start kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr and click noti@@ fications . &quot;
&quot; mark this check box to switch off &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Noti@@ fications to switch off . if this setting is not selected , the remaining settings are de@@ activated and &amp; kt@@ ts ; do not read noti@@ fications . &quot;
&quot; this setting is marked , noti@@ fications where a sound is played , by &amp; kt@@ ts ; not read . &quot;
&quot; use these buttons to add events to the list or delete it . if you click on the Add button , a dialog appears where you can select the application and the event you want to add to the list . &quot;
&quot; this event reads the message , the &amp; con@@ vers@@ ation ; sent when someone men@@ tions your nick@@ name in an IR@@ C message . &quot;
&quot; all events , for which nothing else is specified in the list , are ignored ; ignored . &quot;
use this box to specify what &amp; kt@@ ops ; do when an event arrives . you have the following choices :
&quot; if you have selected user @-@ defined text , enter the text you want . you can use the following plac@@ eholders : &quot;
&quot; you can enter the characteristics of the desired speaker here . standard sel@@ ects the speaker , which is displayed in the list on the card speaker as the top entry . &quot;
&quot; note that there are three levels for events . if an action is specified for a particular event , it is executed . otherwise , the action is executed for all other events of the particular application . &quot;
&quot; the event All noti@@ fications for the application default ( all other events cannot be deleted from the list . for this purpose , you can set the noti@@ fications as follows : &quot;
&quot; use the Save button to save the settings for noti@@ fications to a file . the loaded events will be merged with the events in the list . if you want to start with an empty list , click Del@@ ete . all entries except All Noti@@ fications are deleted . &quot;
&quot; the Speech Syn@@ thesis Mark@@ up Language ( SS@@ ML ) is a W3@@ C standard to mark text for voice output , volume , volume , number of voice and pitch . ss@@ ML is a part of the Vo@@ ic@@ e@@ XML specification , another W3@@ C standard . &quot;
currently supports &amp; kt@@ ts ; SS@@ ML only partially and only in basic functions . the following restrictions are available :
&quot; you need to install the ra@@ b _ di@@ phone voice ( bri@@ tish male ) , as this is the standard voice , the festival is used for the output of SS@@ ML . &quot;
&quot; if the settings for speed or pitch in the festival configuration dialog are not set to 100@@ nbsp ; % , SS@@ ML text is usually spoken very mon@@ oton@@ ous . &quot;

&quot; there are two types of filters - normal filters and pro@@ posi@@ tional recogni@@ tions filter ( SD@@ B filter ) . SB@@ Ds can start writing text into single sentences , not the entire word order . this allows you to pre @-@ read or restart orders on the map card , even if the voice syn@@ thesizer does not directly support this . &quot;
&quot; here you can see the pro@@ posi@@ tional recognition filter . at the first start of &amp; kt@@ ts ; it is automatically set up as a pres@@ by@@ line recognition filter . you can change its settings or add additional pro@@ posi@@ tional recognition filters , but beginners will get rid of it . &quot;
&quot; in the simpl@@ est way , you will learn how to set up the speaker selection by trying out . switch off the speaker selection and select some properties and check the speaker &apos;s selection . you must naturally have more than one speaker set up , otherwise the filter is in@@ effective . &quot;
&quot; the first set has to be processed and not the whole text block , which can take a long time , &quot;
&quot; you can order or cancel text orders on the map card , even if the voice syn@@ thesizer does not support this function . &quot;
&quot; for these reasons , the normal movement limit@@ er filter is automatically set up when you start kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr for the first time . it cannot be switched off , only be removed . do not change anything at this filter unless you know what you are doing . &quot;
text with a regular expression for the stat@@ ute and insert a tab symbol ( dec@@ im@@ al code 8 ) at the set limits ( tab characters are automatically removed from the text before filtering ) . note that the default set @-@ up recognition filter will keep the character set @-@ up .
&quot; S@@ BD filters are never applied to &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ messages ( k@@ notify ) , war@@ nings , messages or output of screen re@@ a@@ ders . &quot;
&quot; if you have removed the normal set @-@ up filter by default , you can insert it again by loading the standard _ s@@ b@@ dr@@ c file . &quot;
on the Map Speech Selec@@ tor you can over@@ write the speaker settings for the application . the card card is displayed when selecting the card .
use of the standard speaker ( the top one on the map card speaker ) . in other words : no speaking characteristics are specified .
&quot; if you do not delete or edit the settings of the speaker , select &amp; kt@@ ts ; this speaker out . otherwise select &amp; kt@@ ts ; the speaker that most likely corresponds to the originally set properties . &quot;
select the method to enter the desired response properties by clicking on one of the selection buttons .
&quot; select the characteristics of the desired microphone here . if this feature doesn &apos;t matter , do nothing . &quot;
tick this check box if the property should have priority over other properties . you can also set several mark@@ ings .
&quot; since the language is a critical factor in understanding the output , it is always treated as a priority property . you will rarely use this feature . the only case where you may want to specify the attribute language , if you know that a particular application is sent in another language than the one in the working environment . &quot;
&quot; to use all the features in the area Spe@@ aker , which is most likely to delete the following , click on the standard speaker select button and then use the speaker that best meets the following . &quot;
in this case 0 stands for the last word order in the queu@@ e . you can also specify a order number . ( without order number the input is required ) .
&quot; stor@@ ts@@ m@@ gr immediately crashes when it is started . I compiled de@@ bug support , but I do not get trac@@ e@@ ability . &quot;
G@@ Stre@@ amer is crashed and &amp; kt@@ ts ; it was finished . probably you have to register G@@ Stre@@ amer . if the problem is not solved it may be a non compatible version of G@@ Stre@@ amer . you can try to update or uninstall G@@ Stre@@ amer .
&quot; the audio output via AL@@ SA doesn &apos;t work when I play music simultaneously with another application . if I get a text order , freezes &amp; kt@@ ts ; one . on the console , a message appears : unable to open PC@@ M . &quot;
&quot; on your system there is the problem that conflicts occur at AL@@ SA , which prevent simultaneous opening of multiple PC@@ M devices . for possible solutions , please refer to the website of the AL@@ SA project ( d@@ mix ) at www.al@@ sa @-@ proj@@ ect@@ .org . &quot;
I downloaded an additional voice for festival from the internet . I installed it and can &apos;t use it in festival but t@@ ts@@ m@@ gr does not show this voice .
&quot; in the file $ K@@ DE@@ HOME / share / apps / kt@@ ts@@ d / fes@@ tival@@ int / voices the new voice is added . if that is successful , please send a patch along with the URL ; on which you found the voice , to the developers . &quot;
&quot; on the card audio , there is an adjustment speed . in order to do this , the program must be installed so@@ x and can be trac@@ eable via the environment variable PAT@@ H . some syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers module such as Festival Interactive provide a setting for speed . depending on the selected voice , this is active or in@@ active . &quot;
&quot; the settings for the talk speed are ignored if &amp; kt@@ ts ; &amp; HTML ; pre@@ reads .

I don &apos;t manage websites to be read with a female voice . I &apos;ve set up a female festival speaker but &amp; kt@@ ts ; reads the websites with a male voice .
&quot; at Festival 1.@@ 95 beta , the day SA@@ BLE GEN@@ DER doesn &apos;t seem to work . so that festival does not produce mistakes , the x@@ s@@ l file re@@ jects SS@@ ML to S@@ aber the GEN@@ DER tags . the same applies to VO@@ ICE tags . &quot;
&quot; I added a separate string added filter and now I can go back in &amp; kt@@ ops ; no more throughput , the order is displayed , the order consists only of one set . what am I doing wrong ? &quot;
&quot; you may not filter punc@@ tu@@ ation marks ( point , question mark , ex@@ clam@@ ation marks , comm@@ a and sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ) . instead , use a filter for pro@@ posi@@ tional recognition instead . &quot;
AL@@ SA ( Advanced &amp; Linux ; Sound Architecture ) . AL@@ SA is on most systems with &amp; Linux ; already installed . ( www.al@@ sa @-@ proj@@ ect@@ .org )
note : make sure the modules are registered for G@@ Stre@@ amer by calling the command g@@ st register before using G@@ Stre@@ amer . ( http : / / g@@ stream@@ er.@@ fre@@ ed@@ es@@ kt@@ op@@ .org )
&quot; some users experience in connection with AL@@ SA conflicts with the audio output . if your system also counts , you cannot simultaneously play music and start reading a text . &quot;
&quot; as of July 2005 , a@@ Ko@@ de does not support any real breaks . if you hold a text order in &amp; kt@@ ops , the current set will be read even more . &quot;
&quot; the audio program so@@ x is used for general setting of speech speeds , but is not necessarily required . Debian users can install so@@ x using the apt @-@ get install so@@ x command . &quot;
&quot; if you have downloaded t@@ arb@@ all ( with tar @-@ packed archive ) , login as normal user and un@@ zip the t@@ arb@@ all into a suitable folder . switch to this folder and enter the following commands : &quot;
in &amp; k@@ de ; 4 the module &amp; arts ; probably removed or at least created at least on request .
the following modules for voice syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers are created by default . some of them possess a run@@ time dependen@@ cy of non @-@ free software . ( non @-@ free according to the Debian distribution guidelines ) .
&quot; in / opt / k@@ de@@ 3 , this folder is not listed in the environment variable $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ RS , you must specify the --@@ pre@@ fix = destination option . for example &quot;
on Debian systems / usr / local is the right folder for programs translated from sources .
CD k@@ de@@ www echo t@@ d &gt; in@@ st @-@ apps make -@@ f Mak@@ ef@@ il@@ e.@@ c@@ vs . / configure cd kt@@ ts@@ d make su make install
&quot; before you use &amp; kt@@ ts ; use , first check if your voice syn@@ thesizer works correctly . follow the instructions you received with the syn@@ thesizer . &quot;
&quot; Festival is one of the best free T@@ TS syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers whose source code is obvious . the quality of the voices is generally good , and there are several voices and languages supported . &quot;
&quot; you have to install at least one language . you will find help in the instructions provided with the festival . if you want to read web pages , you need to install the ( male British ) voice ra@@ b _ di@@ phone . &quot;
&quot; for these voices you need to compile an additional module , so you need the source code from the festival . the German voices are subject to restrictions on passing on . &quot;
&quot; the voice is still in an early stage of development . un@@ pack the software in festival / lib / voices / rus@@ sian / . if you set up the Russian voices , you must enter for the voices MS@@ U _ ru _ N@@ SH _ di@@ phone . select a C@@ yr@@ il@@ lic ( 8 @-@ bit ) encoding as for example KO@@ I@@ 8 @-@ R . &quot;
&quot; the festival is usually included in the &amp; Linux distri@@ butions , so select the festival first on the CDs of your distribution . &quot;
&quot; if you want to use Polish , Hungarian or Czech languages , the option must be set to ISO 8859 @-@ 2 . &quot;
&quot; if you want to use the Russian voice , the option code must be set to 8 @-@ bit cy@@ mb@@ als such as KO@@ I@@ 8 @-@ R . &quot;
Festival can be used together with the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ® syn@@ thesizer . then Festival takes over lex@@ ical analysis and &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; this creates the audio output . the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; -@@ program and the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; -@@ voices can be downloaded from
&quot; note that &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; no complete language output system is . &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; generates additional software to create this Di@@ ph@@ one@@ . Festival creates these Di@@ ph@@ one@@ . t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o can also generate Di@@ ph@@ one@@ . t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o can also be created from German texts , Di@@ phone . &quot;
&quot; in this procedure , additional wr@@ apper code will be added to the festival to use &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; -@@ Vo@@ ices for voice synthesis . note that the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; voice files are not installed in the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA file , but in the folder festival / lib / . instructions can be found at &quot;
&quot; I@@ MS German Festival is a modified version of the festival for German &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; it is required either Festival version 1.@@ 4.1 or Festival 2.0 ( 1.@@ 95@@ beta ) . first , install Festival and &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; then download MS German Festival from &quot;
&quot; instructions can be found in the RE@@ A@@ DM@@ E file in the package you have downloaded . ( for use with festival 2.0 , playback of the error correc@@ tions is not required , you only need to re@@ compile the festival ) . then add the following lines to the file festival / lib / sit@@ ein@@ it@@ .@@ sc@@ m . &quot;
&quot; ( voice location &quot; german _ de@@ 1 _ os &quot; &quot; / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA / de@@ 1 &quot; &quot; German Female , I@@ MS Festival de@@ 2 &quot; &quot; / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA / de@@ 3 &quot; &quot; German Female , I@@ MS Festival de@@ 3 &quot; &quot; ) &quot;
&quot; on some systems , you need to edit the / etc / fes@@ tiv@@ al.@@ sc@@ m file . just add the lines for your installed German voices . replace the correct path in / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA / . at the time of creating this manual , the German de@@ 4 , de@@ 5 , or de@@ 6 voices are not working with I@@ MS German Festival . &quot;
this process uses special code to give the language of the festival with a Czech &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; record and install at first Festival and &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; and make sure both work . then download Festival @-@ Czech by
un@@ zip the program with tar in a suitable folder and create the enc@@ y@@ clo@@ pedia . the exec@@ utable file festival must lie in your PAT@@ H .
download the CZ@@ 2 voice file from the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA site and un@@ zip them with un@@ zip in the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA file .

&quot; Festival Lite is a free , qu@@ el@@ lo@@ ff@@ ener voice syn@@ thesizer , which currently only supports a limited number of voices and languages at the moment . it is a simple voice syn@@ thesizer with even sufficient voice quality . &quot;
Fl@@ ite is usually included in the &amp; Linux distri@@ butions . therefore search fl@@ ite as first on the CDs of your distribution .
&quot; H@@ adi@@ fix is a two @-@ stage voice syn@@ thesizer , which works with Di@@ ph@@ ons . the program t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o transl@@ ates text into Di@@ phone and the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; the voice syn@@ thesizer sounds good , but the support is currently limited to few languages . you can adjust voice , pitch , speech speed and volume over t@@ ts@@ m@@ gr . &quot;
download at least one German language file from the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA site and un@@ zip it into the / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA file .
&quot; copy either t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ phor@@ c to ~ / .t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ phor@@ c , or to / etc / t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o , here the rc must be removed at the end of the file name . &quot;
&quot; on the card box device , select a voice and put the paths to &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; and t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o correctly . &quot;
&quot; EP@@ OS is a free , qu@@ el@@ lo@@ ff@@ ener voice syn@@ thesizer for the Czech and Slovak language . it is a simple voice syn@@ thesizer with even sufficient voice quality . with &amp; kt@@ ts ; you can only adjust the volume with this voice syn@@ thesizer . &quot;
&quot; click Add . select the Czech or Slovak language and ep@@ s T@@ TS language syn@@ thesizer . if the ep@@ s don &apos;t stand in your PAT@@ H , enter additional parameters for the programs . enter in a console ; ep@@ os -@@ h or say -@@ h to get more information . &quot;
&quot; Free@@ T@@ TS is a free , qu@@ el@@ lo@@ ff@@ ener voice syn@@ thesizer written in &amp; Java ; i.e. you must install the &amp; Java ; Virtual Machine on your system . with &amp; Java ; you can neither adjust pitch , volume or voice speed . &quot;
&quot; the command module allows you to use &amp; kt@@ ops ; with any voice syn@@ thesizer , which can be controlled in a console ; on the command line . &quot;
&quot; best use a command , which writes the voice output to a temporary audio file ( wa@@ v ) instead of sending the output directly to the audio device &quot;
&quot; this manual explains the installation and use of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; , a module for the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; enabling the management of network interfaces , routing and DNS settings . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; allows the user to manage a set of system and desktop settings via a unified , integrated interface . the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; can be accessed by selecting K Menu k@@ contro@@ l@@ center . &quot;
the &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; package was developed to allow users to manage the TCP / IP network settings in the same way as other settings from the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; create a simple interface for the user :
&quot; after installation , a new module network settings are displayed in the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; the module network settings ( k@@ net@@ work@@ .@@ conf ; ) can be started by selecting k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; Internet &amp; network network settings in &amp; K@@ Menu . &quot;
&quot; it is important to understand that &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; network hardware cannot be installed . physical devices and their drivers have to be installed and configured , thus &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf@@ . &quot;
&quot; in most cases , drivers for network hardware and other devices while installing &amp; Linux ; installed and setup . if network devices later added , the drivers need to be loaded by adap@@ ting the following files , according to the kernel version . &quot;
the network settings module is loaded when the option of network settings in the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; -@@ index is selected . when starting the module network settings this will automatically detect the platform used on the system .
&quot; if the platform cannot be recognized , the manual selection is offered . it is the platform from the list to choose which the distribution and release reti@@ re is best . by marking the setting of non @-@ once questions , the definition can be set permanently . &quot;
&quot; changing the network settings is only possible in system administration mode . before all options are displayed gray , which means the settings can only be considered , the change is not possible . &quot;
&quot; in the system administration mode , the entire functionality of the module is available . this is divided into three tab@@ s : &quot;
the rider network interfaces are used to manage the network devices of the system . all available network devices are shown . the following tasks can be performed from the rider network interfaces :
the settings displayed on display can be set up by selecting the desired device in the list and clicking the button@@ hole interface ... setup in the Device dialog box .
&quot; by default , only basic TCP / IP settings are available . clicking the button Advanced Settings displays the dialog with further options . &quot;
&quot; with the selection Automati@@ cally , the TCP / IP settings are taken from a DH@@ CP server or BO@@ O@@ TP server . in automatic mode , the TCP / IP settings are required for each system start , so no further adjustment is required . in the selection list can be selected either DH@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP , according to the system . &quot;
&quot; with the selection Manual , the TCP / IP configuration can be made without DH@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP . in the input field IP address the desired TCP / IP address must be specified . in the input field network mask , the sub@@ net mask is specified . &quot;
&quot; if this setting is selected , the system initi@@ alizes the network interface when bo@@ oting . if the initi@@ alization is not desired , this option should not be activated . &quot;
the values entered in this dialog are displayed as properties of the device in the device list .
&quot; it should be ensured that the IP address in the network is not already used . entering an already existing IP address would lead to a TCP / IP conflict . with ping in the console , you can determine if the desired address is already in use . in doubt , the network administrator should be asked . &quot;
&quot; depending on your needs , network devices can be activated or switched off . switch on a switched network device can be activated by selecting from the list and clicking interface .... &quot;
&quot; depending on your needs , network devices can be activated or switched off . disable an activated network device by selecting from the list and clicking interface .... &quot;
sets the IP address of the host in the local sub@@ net that convey@@ s the physical connection to remote networks and is used by default for TCP / IP communication with computers in other sub@@ nets .
&quot; if there is more than one network interface on the computer , the interface must be selected to the network in which the gateway computer is located . &quot;
&quot; a computer with DNS support replaces a complete domain name by the corresponding IP address . this is necessary because computers can only be able to understand IP addresses . if the computer needs only IP addresses , DNS trig@@ gers this name into an IP address like 12@@ 3.@@ 45.@@ 67@@ 8.@@ 90 . &quot;
&quot; the machine for nam@@ ing part of the rider name resolution allows easy management of this list . entries can be added , removed or changed . DNS records can be sorted by selecting an entry and up or down@@ gra@@ ding in the list with buttons up or down@@ wards in priority . &quot;
clicking the button Add ... from the group calcul@@ ator to the name resolution can be added to a DNS server . it will be added to the New Nam@@ eser@@ ver dialog .
first you need to enter the IP address of the DNS server and then click the Add button . the entry is then inserted in the list .
&quot; from the group calcul@@ ator to the name resolution , select an entry and then click the Edit button . the Edit dialog will be displayed . &quot;
&quot; the list of names known by name calcul@@ ator describes host@@ name @-@ to @-@ IP address references for the TCP / IP sub@@ system . it is primarily used for bo@@ oting if no DNS server is available . in small , closed networks , it can replace DNS servers . &quot;
&quot; normally , the list contains known hosts some entries , the &amp; ap@@ os ; loc@@ al@@ host@@ ap@@ os ; and some special IP@@ v@@ 6 addresses support . this still is still in the test version of IP should be replaced in future version 4 . &quot;
enter the IP address of the known computer and click Add .... The New Ali@@ as dialog will be displayed .
&quot; enter the name of the known computer and click the Add button . if the known computer has several alias names , press the Add button several times and enter the other alias names . &quot;
select an entry of a known computer from the list and select Edit ... Edit the Default Calcul@@ ator dialog .
&quot; it can be executed one of the following tasks , then click OK to update the list of static hosts . &quot;
&quot; the settings made in the module network settings are not immediately effective in the system . in order to activate the changes , the following command must be set . &quot;
the homepage of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; is http : / / k@@ net@@ work@@ conf@@ .@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net from which you can download the latest version of the source code .
for the installation of binary distri@@ butions ( usually rpm @-@ packages ) it is enough if &amp; k@@ de ; and Q@@ t are installed .
the installation of the finished version is recommended for less experienced users . it &apos;s easy to download the rpm package and install it in a console ; with rpm as follows :
&quot; alternatively , a tool can be used with graphical interface like k@@ package or the installation tool of their distribution . &quot;
&quot; for this case , the installation of Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de is sufficient ; not , but in addition the development packages with libraries and other things are needed . &quot;
&quot; this is only recommended by experienced users . however , it is not difficult to compile and compile the following commands . &quot;
&quot; in the first section of this chapter , important information is given on basic network technology , in the second all configuration files are discussed . &quot;
this section can not replace advanced knowledge of IP networks . in this attachment only basic information about the integration of the PC into a small ( home ) network is medi@@ ated .
IP networks are currently operated with TCP / IP version 4 ( IP@@ v@@ 4 ) . IP@@ v@@ 5 has never been widely spread . IP@@ v@@ 6 is expected to continue in the near future .
&quot; one of the most important information is to assign the IP address of a network interface . in foreign networks , at &amp; eg ; workplace , the network administrator is the contact point to assign a valid IP address or , if available , the IP address cannot be chosen arbit@@ rar@@ ily ! &quot;
&quot; when setting up your own small ( home ) network , the IP address should be selected from a specific area reserved for this purpose to avoid IP address conflicts with the global ( Internet ) network . &quot;
&quot; of course , access to the Internet for such machines can be enabled by setting up a gateway . &quot;
&quot; for smaller networks , addresses in the area of 19@@ 2.@@ 16@@ 8.@@ 1.1 to 19@@ 2.@@ 16@@ 8.@@ 1.@@ 254 are used . the area is large enough for networks up to 250 computers . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the net mask is usually set on 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.0 , so that all hosts are in the same sub@@ net . &quot;
&quot; some addresses are reserved for special things , 0.0@@ eg ; .0@@ .0 and 12@@ 7.0@@ .0@@ .1 . the first is the so @-@ called standard route , the second is the lo@@ op@@ back address ( loc@@ al@@ host = the own computer ) . the default route is required for IP forwarding . &quot;
&quot; the net address 12@@ 7.0@@ .0@@ .1 is reserved for the IP traffic in the local machine . normally , the address 12@@ 7.0@@ .0@@ .1 is assigned to an own so @-@ called lo@@ op@@ back interface , which works like a closed circle . &quot;
this section contains the configuration files that are affected by &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ s.@@ conf and where they are stored in the various distri@@ butions .
&quot; this file is sometimes dynam@@ ically altered in DSL connections , so it will not be surprised if a different content is found in the case of active DSL connections . &quot;
&quot; for &amp; Su@@ SE , it is known that this file is om@@ itted by the scripts in Su@@ SE@@ config . another stand as expected can therefore occur . &quot;

&quot; it appears the default k@@ de ; -@@ printer dialog . if you select shut@@ ters , you can see that there are two additional &amp; k@@ cr@@ on ; -@@ specific options in the printer dialog . &quot;
print the c@@ ron@@ tab of all users on the system . this option is only accessible to users who own advanced per@@ missions .
&quot; cr@@ on , for example Vi@@ x@@ ie @-@ cr@@ on . &amp; k@@ cr@@ on ; uses the command c@@ ron@@ tab to change the time sched@@ ules of the users . &quot;
&quot; a PO@@ SIX @-@ compliant &amp; UNIX ; , for example with gli@@ b@@ c . &amp; k@@ cr@@ on ; uses standard commands from &amp; UNIX to learn time and date . &quot;
&amp; k@@ dat ; is a backup program for tape drives on the basis of tar . it offers the possibility to create multiple archives on a tape ; the first consisted in creating a surface for tar which presented my wife : how much longer does it take to secure ?
&quot; before a band can be used , it must be included by &amp; k@@ dat ; this can happen in three ways : &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ dat ; return the tape back and reads the pre @-@ tension@@ ing information of the band . recognize &amp; k@@ dat ; the pre@@ tension on the tape , you &apos;ll be asked if the tape is to be format@@ ted . &quot;
&quot; det@@ ects &amp; k@@ dat ; the default , searches it according to the matching index on your disk . can it not be found , you &apos;ll be asked if the band index should be recre@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; everything went smoothly , the symbol for the tape drive is changing . in the status bar a corresponding message appears . the contents of the tape can now be searched by folding the entry for the band . &quot;
&quot; before ej@@ ecting the belt , the integration must first be solved . there are three methods to accomplish this : &quot;
&amp; k@@ dat ; indicates a change in the symbol for the tape that the integration for the band has been solved and displays a corresponding message in the status bar . the tape can now be ej@@ ected without danger .
&quot; before a band of &amp; k@@ dat ; can be used , it must be format@@ ted by &amp; k@@ dat ; &quot;
&quot; one band type must be format@@ ted before you can be used for saving data . this procedure does not correspond to format@@ ting at &amp; k@@ dat ; . if your tape drive requires a format@@ ting of the tape drive , DAT drives do not require format@@ ting of the tape drive . &quot;
after entering the band name and the capacity goes &amp; k@@ dat ; with the format of the strap . all data on the tape are lost ! after completion of the format@@ ting process the tape is automatically integrated and is ready for use .
&quot; before you start the backup process , you need to select the files to be secured . this can happen in three ways : &quot;
select a file or folder in the local file tree . it will only backup this file or folder .
select a backup profile in the tree . only the files specified in profile are backed up .
select files in the local file tree with a tick . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders are backed up .
right click on the local file tree and select Save ...
&quot; once the backup has been launched , the dialog opens for backup . in this dialog you can check the selected files again and change the settings for backup . &quot;
&quot; when you confirm the settings , the dialog will display . the dialog shows the progress of the backup process including the data rate and the remaining time . &quot;
select a file or folder in one of the archives in the entry for the drive . it will only check the selected file or folder .
select the files in one of the archives in the entry for the band with a tick . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders are checked .
right click on one of the archives and select the menu entry ...
&quot; once the test procedure has been started , the dialog will display settings for checking . in this dialog you can check your selection and change the work folder for review . &quot;
&quot; if you confirm the settings for the review , the dialog will appear . this dialog shows the progress of the audit process as well as the throughput and the time remaining . &quot;
&quot; before you can initiate re@@ manufacturing , the files that are to be restored must be marked . this can be done in two ways : &quot;
select a file or folder in one of the archives that belong to the tape drive . it will only restore the selected file or sub@@ folder .
select the files you want from one of the archives with a tick . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders will be restored .
right click on a file or folder in one of the archives and select Rest@@ ore from the menu ....
&quot; once the recovery process has been started , the dialog for Rest@@ ore dialog appears . in this dialog you can check your selection and change the folder for restor@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; when you confirm the settings for restor@@ ing , the dialog will appear again . this dialog shows the progress of recovery process as well as data throughput and time . &quot;
sometimes it proves to be necessary to recre@@ ate the band index file using the tape content . this process delet@@ es all existing index files for this volume .
this creates a backup profile with the currently selected files and the default settings . you can make the following settings for a backup profile :
the current working folder in which the backup should take place . the list of files to be secured is automatically updated according to the currently selected work folder .
&quot; for all folders listed in the backup files , only the files that are located on the same file system , such as the folder . folders that are located on other file systems , can be placed separately under backup files . each entry is viewed by tar regardless of the others . &quot;
&quot; to determine which files have changed since the last incre@@ mental backup , a snap@@ shot file is used . only the files that have changed since then . &quot;
the name of the file used to determine the changes since the last incre@@ mental backup .
delete the snap@@ shot file before calling tar . this causes all files to be backed up and a new snap@@ shot file is created for the next backup .
the functionality of the buttons files &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; lt ; files were not fully implemented at the time of creating this documentation .
&quot; the settings can be set up via the menu item &quot; &quot; K@@ D@@ at ... &quot; &quot; in the Settings menu . you can make the following settings : &quot;
the complete path to the device file for the tape drive ( normally / dev / tape ) . this path must refer to the non @-@ recur@@ ring option of the tape device .
&quot; this setting is active , transmitted &amp; k@@ dat ; before the tape is included the command mt load to the drive . in some drives , this is necessary before reading or write operations can be performed . &quot;
&quot; if the option is enabled , try &amp; k@@ dat ; to lock the drop in the tape drive . possibly , this setting does not work with all tape drives . &quot;
&quot; if the option is enabled , when releasing the &amp; k@@ dat attachment , the tape is automatically disc@@ ar@@ ded . do not use this option on flo@@ ppy streaming . &quot;
&quot; the option enabled , tries &amp; k@@ dat ; the hard@@ war@@ es@@ ei@@ ver block size for the tape drive . not all drives support variable block sizes . no matter if this setting is active or not , you need to share the block size for your tape drive . &quot;
&quot; if &amp; k@@ dat ; a tape format@@ ted , it writes a file to the beginning of the tape . this file should only cover a memory block on the tape . the content of the file is composed as follows : &quot;
&quot; the format of this string is machine name : seconds , where host@@ name is the full name of the system on which the tape was format@@ ted . seconds is the number of seconds that has passed since the period in which the band has been format@@ ted . &quot;
the band ID will be used to find a file with the same name in the $ HOME / .@@ k@@ dat file .
&quot; the remaining files on the tape are pure tar archives , which can be managed directly with &amp; GNU . even other tar versions should work as long as it is not incre@@ mental back@@ ups . &quot;
check the contents of a backup tape . this symbol is only active when a band is involved .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; viewer for system logs . the program is suitable for inexperienced users who do not know where to get information about your system or where the system provides the various protocol files .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; helps users understand what your computer is in the background . the task of &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; is a simplified representation of the protocol files of your own system . the program is suitable for inexperienced users who do not know where to get information about your system or where the system leaves the different protocol files .
&quot; furthermore , &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; experienced users provide quick access for example on information about problems that occur on their server . therefore , some advanced functions are provided that can be fil@@ tered and analysed using the protocol @-@ files of certain programs . &quot;
in the current version 0.@@ 4.1 has &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; a number of useful functions . these include :
support for many different types of log files for the format of the Sy@@ slo@@ g server and for Sam@@ ba
many other functions are also included and are explained in the further chapters of this manual .
&quot; as you see in the following screen@@ shot , provides &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; features available with which the individual protocol lines of a log file can easily filter and sort . the individual options for sorting and filtering are shown in the next chapter of this manual . &quot;
&quot; after the start , try &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; first of all , the main protocol file of the system - the system protocol - to open the system protocol . &quot;
&quot; you can also filter the filter strip to filter after a selected criterion or after typ@@ ed strings . in the default setting , the selection field is displayed next to the filter list . &quot;
&quot; you can , of course , select another entry at this point . in the protocol @-@ file system protocol , select the column process only with the entries in the corresponding column , so show you &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; all the protocol lines that were sent or created by this process . &quot;
this option is enabled in the default setting and helps you detect the important protocol lines . minutes &apos; lines of level error are shown with a show@@ y color as protocol lines of the level indication . the color display of protocol lines can be turned off .
&quot; if you want to show only certain process ( e.g. in the system protocol or in the C@@ ron protocol ) , you can then use the process identification ( PID ) in the column process . this can , for example , be useful if you want to examine the output of a particular command such as the start of the Sam@@ ba server . in this case , use the filter strip . &quot;
&quot; in addition , you can use the option to jump to new lines in the main window context menu to display all new added protocol lines . &quot;
&quot; to use this feature , use the entries in the menu window to open and manage additional sub windows . once you have selected a sub @-@ window , select a log in the menu . &quot;
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; has its own website at http : / / k@@ system@@ log@@ .@@ forum @-@ softw@@ are@@ .@@ or@@ g. D@@ ort you will find further up @-@ to @-@ date information on the sources of &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; also find in the following folder of the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Subversion Archives : k@@ system@@ log ; im &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Archive
&quot; welcome to the &amp; k@@ de ; System V In@@ it Editor , rather known ( and in the following as named ) as &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; . this section introduces some concepts and describes what you can do with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v . &quot;
&quot; system V In@@ it is rapidly becoming a standard for the control of the program starts when running the system in the &amp; Linux ; world . and that &apos;s because it is easier to use , more powerful and at the same time more flexible than the traditional BSD @-@ In@@ it . &quot;
I will not go further into historical aspects here ( e.g. because I know nothing about it : - ) .
&quot; the In@@ it binary file is under / s@@ bin and not under / etc . this is therefore important because maybe someone might attempt to switch a machine to System V In@@ it without re@@ installing and reform@@ at@@ ting it . therefore , you need to make sure that the old In@@ it was removed from there , if there was one . &quot;
&quot; the Sy@@ s@@ V In@@ it differs from the BSD In@@ it , that the configuration files in a sub@@ folder of / etc are located directly in / etc . this folder is called r@@ c.@@ sy@@ sin@@ it and the following additional folders : &quot;
&quot; system services include such things such as network , NFS , &amp; Send@@ mail ; , htt@@ pd &amp; etc ; system services do not include such things such as set@@ serial , which is only once started . such calls are to r@@ c.@@ local . &quot;
&quot; you can also create a r@@ c.@@ serial in / etc / r@@ c.@@ d , if you want to run a r@@ c.@@ serial in / etc / r@@ c.@@ d , if you want to run a r@@ c.@@ serial in / etc / r@@ c.@@ d , if you want to do something with the serial port . &quot;
the kernel searches in different places after the program in@@ it and starts the first one finds .
the default run@@ level is entered in / etc / in@@ itt@@ ab . you should see a line like the following :
&quot; at this point you can take a look at the second column and probably determine that the default run@@ level 3 is . if you want to change it , then you can fix it by re@@ boot the system and execute the following : &quot;
&quot; but how does it start all the right scripts ? if you enter ls -@@ l in r@@ c@@ 3.@@ d , then you &apos;ll probably see something like the following : &quot;
&quot; you will notice that there are no real files in this folder . instead , each entry is a short@@ cut to one of the scripts in the init@@ .@@ d directory . &quot;
how to start and stop in@@ it actually system services ? quite simple : each of the scripts is written in such a way that it is an argument like start and stop . you can actually start these scripts by hand on the command line as follows :
&quot; this would stop the htt@@ pd server . in@@ it reads the name , and when the one K includes , the script is inv@@ oked with the argument stop . if it includes an S , the script will start with the argument start . &quot;
&quot; some people want a simple way to set machines for many purposes . I could &amp; eg ; a server run@@ level that only lets htt@@ pd , &amp; Send@@ mail ; , Network &amp; etc ; running . in addition , I could also have a user run@@ level that starts &amp; eg ; &amp; k@@ d@@ m ; , Network &amp; etc . &quot;
here you learn how to use &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; it should not be very difficult because the program was created as user @-@ friendly as possible .
the use of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; with a mouse or another poin@@ ter is simple to not say tri@@ vial : simply drag an entry from the range of available system services to one of the six run@@ ways to start it on this level ( or stop ) .
you can also move scripts between Run@@ level@@ n or change the position within a level by drag@@ ging it somewhere else . this will only happen if they draw an entry from the range of available system services .
&quot; note : entries are moved if you move them into a new area . to simply copy them to a new run@@ level , you must explicitly copy from the Edit menu or from the context menu and insert them into the target area -- even if the same entry already exists in the target area of the action . &quot;
&quot; the sorting number of an entry can sometimes not be calculated . in such a case , you need to edit the sorting numbers of the surrounding entries before you can try again to insert the system service . &quot;
&quot; note : currently , there is no way to restore entries thrown into the rec@@ ycle bin . so be careful . &quot;
&quot; you can use the tab@@ ulator key to activate the different work@@ spaces ( available system services , run@@ level 1 start , run@@ level 1 stop &amp; etc ; ) as well as the cursor keys to make a selection above or below the previous one . &quot;
&quot; to move an entry to another run@@ level , move it into the clip@@ board ( you can also use Ctr@@ l ; X ) and insert it into the desired run@@ level with insert ( with Ctr@@ l ; V ) . &quot;
&quot; to change the sorting number or name of an entry manually , press Enter key to change the properties dialog . close the tab key to accept the changes , or press Es@@ c to disc@@ ard the changes . &quot;
&quot; because of the risk of data loss , all entries in the File menu will require confirmation before running . &quot;
&quot; all settings are stored in $ K@@ DE@@ HOME / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ rc . default settings are taken from the global file ( $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ rc ) , if it is available . otherwise , they will be saved by &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; stored in a local k@@ sy@@ sv@@ rc . &quot;
&quot; I experim@@ ented with the standard Run@@ level@@ n , and now the machine boots up constantly . what can I do ? &quot;
enter linux single on the LI@@ LO -@@ Pro@@ mp@@ t linux single and press Enter key to start in single @-@ user mode . then edit the file / etc / in@@ itt@@ ab and change the default run@@ level to a reasonable value ( 3 should normally be in order ) .
&quot; I have some system services provided with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; for implementation under Run@@ level X , but they are not executed . &quot;
&quot; if you are using &amp; Su@@ SE ; or Del@@ ix ( DL@@ D ) , you need to edit additional files in / etc that are only available in these distri@@ butions . please read the details in the manual of the distribution . &quot;
&quot; the way system services are started in these distri@@ butions , simpli@@ fies configuration for the proprietary installation programs of these distri@@ butions , but does not correspond to any standard . the authors of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; are planning an extension of the program for this approach . &quot;
&quot; if you use another distribution , please check if all configuration files are provided ( and whether they are in the right directory ) . some services ( such as &amp; eg ; Apache or htt@@ pd ) are simply quit without notice when their configuration files are not available or incor@@ rectly installed . &quot;
&quot; the meaning of the &amp; Linux ; Run@@ level varies from distribution to distribution , can even be different from version to version . if you use another distribution , please send me information about the run@@ level to allow this manual to be added to this manual . &quot;
this documentation refers to &amp; k@@ user ; 1.0 . with this program you can manage the users and groups of your system .
&quot; to start with &amp; k@@ user ; to start , it is sufficient to read the chapter adaptation of &amp; k@@ user ; to read . &quot;
&quot; after you have made changes , you need to save it . either you can use the corresponding icon of the toolbar or save the entry in the File menu . &quot;
&quot; the main window consists of two cards , the user and the user group list . to edit , select the desired user or group with a double click on the entry . &quot;
&quot; some map cards are only displayed if you have advanced system settings . only if you have enabled space restrictions ( quot@@ a ) for users , a card card will be created if Shadow Pass@@ words or e.g. / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d are installed like in BSD Uni@@ xes . &quot;
&quot; the card map Password Management appears when Shadow Pass@@ words , or for example , / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d are installed like in BSD Uni@@ xes . &quot;
&quot; this map only appears if for at least a built @-@ in file system restriction ( Qu@@ ota ) is activated and initi@@ alized ( recogni@@ zable at the file quot@@ a.@@ user / quot@@ a.@@ group on the files@@ ystem ) . here you can change parameters for each user , with the limited restrictions in KB are : &quot;
these parameters can be individually set for each files@@ ystem . the current files@@ ystem is selected using the File System field with space restriction .
&quot; the card card groups inform about group affili@@ ations of the selected user . the standard group , which the user owns , can be found in the field Prim@@ ary Group . furthermore , the user can become a member of other groups by marking them in the large field . &quot;
&quot; the Group &apos;s dialog properties include a list of all users . to add a user to the group , select this user in the list . &quot;
&quot; to add a user or group , select Add from the User or Group or click the appropriate Add button of the toolbar . editing or dele@@ tion of the selected user or the selected group functions analog . &quot;
&quot; with this module you can install the LI@@ LO System Selec@@ tor , remove and change the boot password , remove and change the time to boot of the standard operating system , remove , remove , change operating systems , remove , change , and more . &quot;
