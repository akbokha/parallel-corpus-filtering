<seg id="11">The module Angle Filter (also called Ordnerfilter) can be reached in the & konqueror; menu bar under Extras Angle Filter. with the module you can filter & konqueror; 's current working directory in different ways.</seg>
<seg id="12">"to use DOM tree view in & konqueror; to use, select Tools DOM tree... and open a new window with DOM of the currently displayed website. as default, the display begins with the root node of the document, example: documentelement, all other nodes are sub-elements of this root node."</seg>
<seg id="13">The & FSView module; for & konqueror; displays another view for objects with the MIME type inode / directory in local files. it can be used as an alternative for the different symbol and text views to view the content of your local file system.</seg>
<seg id="14">The peculiarity of & FSView; consists of showing nested folder hierarchies using a so-called tree map. tree-maps allow to display the size of objects in nested structures. this size must have the property that the sum of the sizes of the subordinate objects of an object is smaller or equal to the size of the object.</seg>
<seg id="15">"with & FSView; the size of a file or folder shows the size of a folder as the sum of the size of the entries is set in it. accordingly, large files, even then easily recognized, can be easily recognized if they are far below in the folder hierarchy."</seg>
<seg id="16">"in & FSView, a rectangle that represents a file or folder in your filesystem is a rectangle that represents a file or folder in your file system."</seg>
<seg id="17">"the color of a rectangle, which is switched over view color mode, can be either deep for easy detection of the nesting depth or the illustration of another file property, such as name, owner, group or MIME type."</seg>
<seg id="18">"a rectangle can be labeled with the different properties of the respective file or folder. for each property you can specify whether it is displayed at all, or whether the area of subordinate rectangle should be used (where, therefore, the relative position of the lettering is indicated in the rectangle)."</seg>
<seg id="19">"in case of Treemap in & FSView; this goal is not always complied with. in the Treemap in & FSView, this goal is not always kept. note that less space for the frame is lost when the rectangle is square."</seg>
<seg id="20">"as division of the area of an entry is done for the subordinate entries, the implementation is left to the implementation. here, it is always advantageous for the label and avoidance of space losses due to frames that are as square as possible. the best methods in this regard are rows, columns or recursive branches."</seg>
<seg id="21">"you can specify the minimum displayed area for an entry above the menu entry View. instead, a diamond pattern is drawn into the area of the arranged entry to indicate that this area is actually occupied by a subordinate entry."</seg>

<seg id="74">Modern digital cameras are characterized by the use of Compact and Flash; Memory Cards and USB or FireWire (IEEE-1394 or i-Link) for data transmission.</seg>
<seg id="75">"gPhoto2 also supports the Picture Transfer Protocol, a widely used protocol developed by the International Imaging Industry Association. gPhoto2 also supports the transmission of images from digital cameras to computers and other peripherals without the need for additional drivers."</seg>
<seg id="76">"many old digital cameras are using the serial interface for their communication with the computer. as photos in general are large files and transmissions via the serial port are slow, this connection is now obsolete."</seg>
<seg id="77">"libgphoto2 has to have been created with libexif support to read the preview images of digiKam reliably. if the Exif support is not available in libgphoto2, you may be able to see thumbnails or the creation could be very slow."</seg>
<seg id="78">One of the most beautiful things at & digicame; is how easy it can expand its functionality by modules:</seg>
<seg id="79">"KIPI modules: the KDE Image plugins Interface Project (manual) is an approach to develop a common module structure for & digicame;, KPhotoAlbum, Showimg and Gwenview. the goal is to provide the modules for all graphics programs. the settings for the KIPI modules are described in this section."</seg>
<seg id="80">"modules can manipulate images in virtually any way, as it can also be a user. their advantage is that it is much easier, & digicame; by writing a small module to add a function as the changes in & digicame; themselves."</seg>
<seg id="81">"to simplify the window, you can either remove the page bars with & LMB; remove or switch in full screen mode with F11 or Ctrl + Shift + F."</seg>

<seg id="145">"what is a digital inventory management - apart from the fashion word? digital inventory management considers any part of the process followed after the image has been taken up to the final issue and permanent storage. each of the photos records, scans or digital photos stores a form of digital inventory management. most of us do not do this in a systematic and efficient way."</seg>
<seg id="146">"we give you a tool, a plan and practical tips on how to back up your pictures, find, protect, and use photos again. we will focus on the process for digital photographers die & digikam; use. we consider downloading, renaming, backup, regrouping, archiving, optimizing, maintenance, and exporting image files."</seg>
<seg id="147">"& quot; Digital inventory management takes up, indexed, categorized, secures, searches, transformed, confected, and exports content that have a monetarian or cultural value."</seg>
<seg id="148">Metadata is defined as data on data. metadata is stored in accordance with your definition data that provide information on or a documentation of other data that are managed by an application or environment.</seg>
<seg id="149">"if you don't even know how many photos you have, then you don't need to find a specific photo without inventory administration. if you don't even know how many photos you have, then use it certainly not & digicame;. the approach to store metadata both in a database as well as in the image files guarantees very fast searches and secure archiving that you can freely access with other programs, platforms and formats."</seg>
<seg id="150">"the first thing you need to do and know before you want to incorporate anything into your system is the structure of information structure in contrast to data structure. you must decide to have other access to your photos, whether you want to save them to a reserved drive, or on a network drive & etc. note that you have to switch to a bigger drive sometime."</seg>
<seg id="151">"if you have enough photos, then you will be able to organize subfolders such as & eg; 2008-01, 2008-02 & etc; use. export is then a folder for images you can print or publish on a website."</seg>
<seg id="152">"professional photographers have other requirements such as versioning photos, archiving, workflow, constant supply of images on different themes and a large number of everything. within 10 years 95% archives and 5% work files will not want to reorganize your structure for this content."</seg>
<seg id="153">Which types of files fit together? the separation of file types makes the batch processing easier. separate new from old files.</seg>
<seg id="154">The separation of original and work files simplifies a backup strategy and migration. you will always know if you are looking for an original or a derivative image.</seg>
<seg id="155">"we also recommend the option to store metadata in the settings page of the metadata in & digicame; this ensures that EXIF- and IPTC data can be written to the file. if you forget this, then you can subsequently save the metadata from the database in the files by selecting the corresponding item from the menu."</seg>
<seg id="156">"now you have a lot of information in your database, but what happens if you want to change which changes?"</seg>

<seg id="304">This setting is only supported for Fuji Super CCD SLR cameras. using the second sensors has the effect that underexposed images will get more details in the top lights. for other cameras this option is ignored.</seg>
<seg id="305">"the standard is the pointed-lights, so the parts of your images are burned to consider as continuous white. use the setting of continuous white in the settings. the setting colors will generate some unusual results as it displays the top lights in various rosatars. finally, you can try to reconstruct some parts of the missing information from the top lights."</seg>
<seg id="306">"this is possible because blue pixels are generally not as fast as green and red. & digicame; and dcraw try to reconstruct the missing green and red portions of the still non-saturated blue pixels. of course, this is a question of how much color or white you want."</seg>
<seg id="307">"if you select the option to reconstruct, you get the possibility to set a level. here is a value of three a compromise and can / should therefore be individually adapted for each image."</seg>

<seg id="309">"a Demosaicing algorithm is a digital image process to calculate a complete picture of the sub-raw data obtained from the color-filtered image sensor, which has many cameras and that provides a matrix of coloured pixels. this algorithm is also known as CFA interpolation or colour reproduction."</seg>
<seg id="310">"after some tests, it looks as if AHD interpolation (variable number of gradients) was used. VNG interpolation (variable number of gradients) was the first algorithm used by Dcraw. it produces color artefacts on edges. bilinear is interesting if you are looking for a quick solution with an acceptable result."</seg>
<seg id="311">"if you know the color deviation of your lenses, you can set the red and blue corrections here. this is certainly the best method for a color adjustment correction, since you are carried out during raw conversion."</seg>

<seg id="378">"if the theme is based on color management, everyone wants to know what buttons he needs to press for the results he wants. unfortunately, color management means to provide you with sufficient background information about color management."</seg>

<seg id="388">This tool provides five automatic corrections that can improve a picture in most cases. therefore use it before you attempt a further manual processing.</seg>
<seg id="389">"the functions normalize, identical, automatic transcending and contrast extend from the menu Corrigation Automatic correction attempt automatically from your colors to make the best. you will have to experiment with these effects to see which works best in your photo."</seg>
<seg id="390">Normalize: this method scans the luminous values over the entire image so that the darkest point is black and the brightest dot as bright as possible without changing its shade. this function is often a magic correction for images that are dark or washed.</seg>
<seg id="391">"the same number of pixels has the same number of pixels, sometimes it produces very good results in improving the contrast of an image, sometimes it produces very good results in improving the contrast of an image, sometimes it produces only rubbish. it is a very powerful operation that either causes miracles in a picture or destroyed it."</seg>
<seg id="392">"automatic balance: this method maximizes the color range in the red, green and blue channel. you determine the dark and bright tones and adjust the red, green and blue channels to the complete histogram range."</seg>
<seg id="393">Contrast: this method improves the contrast and brightness of the RGB values of an image by moving the lowest and highest values to the greatest possible range and a rejiof all values in between. this is only visible in selected images and can be a good correction for bad pictures.</seg>
<seg id="394">The white balance of & digikam; is a semi-automatic tool to perform the white balance of a photo.</seg>
<seg id="395">"if you are too far from the original image, areas with overexposure may occur. if you are too far from the original image, areas with overexposure may occur. if you can perform the white balance in raw mode, which works in 16-bit mode, your possibilities for correction will be improved."</seg>
<seg id="396">This tool is based on a white balance algorithm which is protected by Pawel T. Jochym. you start it using the menu entry colors white balance of image processing.</seg>
<seg id="397">"the preview window can be adjusted in size. on the left, both the original image and preview of the target picture can be seen."</seg>
<seg id="398">The preview of the target photos has a red marker. the luminance of the pixel under this marker is shown as vertical line in the histogram.</seg>
<seg id="399">"at the top right a histogram shows that dynamically changes as soon as you change a parameter. this histogram is very helpful, even in well lit pictures, most pixels are very small Luminance values. with one button, you can decide whether one of the three colors or your sum is indicated. the sum is called Luminance."</seg>
<seg id="400">"the contrast of your result depends on shadow, saturation and gamma. adjust the shadow details of your photos or dim down."</seg>
<seg id="401">"to play with the above controls, you should use the color temperature pipette. click on this button and then somewhere on the picture preview to use selected color to calculate the color temperature of the white balance. this way, the temperature and green values are set automatically."</seg>
<seg id="402">"in addition, you can set the white balance with the list of presets. the following settings are available:"</seg>
<seg id="403">The overexposure indicator increases the colors when more than one color channel of the pixel is overexposed.. You will see the combined result in the white balance. this is displayed as a pure indicator and has no effect on the final image.</seg>
<seg id="404">"the buttons Save As and Loading do exactly this. each setting of the white balance you have set, you can save it to a text file and load it later."</seg>
<seg id="405">"the Preferences button returns all filter values back to their default values and the associated neutral white balance. note that even neutral settings will result in another picture as your original. if you save this, your original image will change."</seg>
<seg id="406">"you can set the encoding depth per colour channel of the edited image. 8-bit encoding is better suited for high quality images. this coding requires more disk space, time time and is only available for formats PNG, PNM, TIFF and DNG."</seg>
<seg id="407">This tool opens the same dialog as for the processing of blanks. it uses the change and assignment of color profiles. colour mapping can be done by the sub-window for the brightness. a detailed guide for using color profiles allows you to rate the chapter of color management.</seg>
<seg id="408">"another important tool is to find in the menu under Color Tonwertcorrection. this tool provides an integrated way to adjust multiple color channels at the same time, allowing you to always use your settings so that you will always need the same correction."</seg>
<seg id="409">A very powerful possibility to correct exposure problems is the tool for gradation that you can find under colors gradation in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="410">"the & digious; tool color effects provide you four color effects, a solar installation effect, a Velvia filter, a Neon effect and an edge filter."</seg>
<seg id="411">"the coloured, darker areas protected the delicate photopaper from the extra light. this had the effect that the lighter areas were darker and the colors were inverted by the second illumination. the result was a partial negatively of the image. this tool allows you to adjust this interesting effect fine."</seg>
<seg id="412">"the intensity control the Solarisation. at about 50% intensity, the image shows what is chemically possible. another increase eventually creates a negative image that does not produce photo paper."</seg>
<seg id="413">This is an example of the Solarisation effect. the original image is the (1) and that processes the (2). the applied intensity is 30%.</seg>
<seg id="414">The Vivid filter simulates the so-called & quot; Velviaquot; effect. it differs from saturation by making it a stronger contrast effect that makes the colors brilliant and brilliant. try it to embellish many photos.</seg>
<seg id="415">The name is a composition of & quot; Velvet Mediaquot; and thus a reference for its smooth image structure. Velvia offers very saturated colours with daylight and high contrasts.</seg>
<seg id="416">"the NeonFilter simulates neonlight on the contrast edges. the parameter level controls the brightness of the result and the sliders reps the strength of the neon light. at large pictures, the filter can load the entire CPU for a moment."</seg>
<seg id="417">Digital cameras often have problems with lighting conditions and it is therefore not unusual that you want to correct the color contrast and the luminosity of the photos.</seg>
<seg id="418">"even in this case, the tool for brightness / saturation is a good choice to reduce saturation instead of increasing it. even in this case, the tool for brightness / saturation is a good choice to see saturation instead of increasing it. if you like the result, you can confirm the changes with Ok."</seg>
<seg id="419">"between the complex mold gradation and the simple luminous intensity / contrast / gamma, the tool sound correction is set to improve the exposure. even if the dialog for this tool works very complicated, you need only the scope of the slide. concrete the three slides below the histogram."</seg>
<seg id="420">"the window contains a graph of intensity values, a histogram, the active channel or the selected area. under the graph, three slides can be clicked into the image and which can be moved to change the intensity values of the image. the left side represents the dark and the right side the bright areas."</seg>
<seg id="421">The easiest way to learn how to use it is to shift the control and take care of how the image changes.</seg>
<seg id="422">"on the right hand side, the original and preview of the image can be viewed. the preview will be dynamic, based on the settings of the image, updated. the following options are available on the left-hand side."</seg>
<seg id="423">Scaling: with this selection box can be set whether the histogram is represented with a linear or logarithmic Y axis. in case of images of a constant color the linear histogram is dominated by a single column. in this case the logarithmic classification is more useful.</seg>
<seg id="424">"three controls: the top for the dark tones, the middle for the bright tones and the lowest for the middle tones, often called gammasts."</seg>
<seg id="425">"the three color pinstripes can be used in the preview of the original image to automatically adjust the input values of shadows, middle and bright tones. furthermore, there is a button for a fully automatic adjustment."</seg>
<seg id="426">Output values: the output values allow the selection of manual values for each area. there are also two controls that can be used to change the output values as the background. for example the compression of the output values can be used to create a hidden image as background while something else is in the foreground.</seg>
<seg id="427">Automatically: with this button the image values are automatically set depending on the intensity values of the image.</seg>
<seg id="428">Save as and load: with these buttons the set values in the file system can be saved and recharged later. the Gimp Levels Format is used.</seg>
<seg id="429">"if you use this mode and the three color pipettes, the input values will be automatically adjusted for all shadows, means and sun shades. activate the color pipette you want to use and click on thumbnails to set the input values of the histogram for red, green, blue and the luminance channels."</seg>
<seg id="430">"the option overexposure indicator controls all color channels to find overexposed pixels and show you the combined result of all channels. this is an indicator, i.e. you get the effect only in preview and there is no effect to see the final result."</seg>
<seg id="431">"below you can see an example of the adjustment of input values applied to red, green and blue channel of a photo. intensity and alpha channel, as well as the output values are unchanged. the original image is marked with (1) and the corrected picture with (2)."</seg>
<seg id="432">The preview will be updated dynamically depending on your settings. the following options are available on the right-hand side:</seg>
<seg id="433">Modified channel: this selection box allows to specify the channel that is modified by the module:</seg>
<seg id="434">"in addition to this box, there are two symbols to switch between a linear and a logarithmic view. for images that have been recorded with a digital camera, linear mode creates a wide beam. in this case logarithmic mode helps."</seg>
<seg id="435">"for example, if you shift a curve to the right, for example the bright tones, then you can see that these bright tones correspond with darker output holes and that darker the associated image pixel."</seg>
<seg id="436">"on the preview of the original photos is a red marker to see. if you want to change this marker to the area you want to change, a matching line will be displayed on the curve representing the original value."</seg>
<seg id="437">Save as and load: with these buttons you can do exactly this. each curve that you created can be saved in the file system and loaded later. the file format is the Gimp curve format.</seg>
<seg id="438">"if you create this method and the three color pipette buttons automatically create the control points of the curve for all channels of shadow, middle and sunny tones. activate the color pipette you want to use and click on the original image to set the control points for the red, green, blue and Luminance curve."</seg>
<seg id="439">"the option overexposure indicator controls all color channels to display overexposed pixels. if in more than one channel overexposed pixels, you get the combined result. this is an indicator, i.e. you get the effect only in preview and there is no effect to see the final result."</seg>
<seg id="440">Below you can see a black-and-white photo that was corrected in the Luminance Channel. shadow and sun shades were set with the color pipette and applied to the curves. the original image is (1) and the corrected (2).</seg>
<seg id="441">The channel mixer of the & digicame; image processing is a tool to improve the color channels or change the color shading of the photos.</seg>
<seg id="442">The channel mixer is another highly developed tool to mix the colors of the images. you can edit it from the menu colors channel mixer of image processing.</seg>
<seg id="443">"with the channel selection box, you can select the color for histogram: this gives you a first indication of how you can correct the channels by viewing the relative distribution and rash. the left pane of the window shows you a preview. the original can be viewed for comparison with your own rider."</seg>
<seg id="444">"the preview of the target picture has a red marker. if you position it in the image, a vertical line in the histogram shows you to display the corresponding color value."</seg>
<seg id="445">"controls for the module are right below: controls for red, green and construction allow you to mix these channels. if you activate Luminance, the image will retain the general brightness, as the channel mixer then is THE tool for generating magnificent black and white conversions of your photos. try to reduce the green channel for black and white portraits."</seg>
<seg id="446">"sometimes, especially when mixing monochrome, the reduction of a color comes to a visible noise that comes from the farbrauer. if that is the case, you can improve your Monochrome conversion in which you can reduce your monochrome conversion."</seg>
<seg id="447">The saving as and loading buttons are used exactly for this purpose. any mixer settings can be saved for later and then load. the file format used is the Gimp channel mixer format.</seg>
<seg id="448">"the option overexposure indicator controls all color channels to find overexposed pixels and show you the combined result of all channels. this is an indicator, i.e. you get the effect only in preview and there is no effect to see the final result."</seg>
<seg id="449">Below you can see a photo in which the blue channel has been readjusted. the Luminance option is checked. the original image is under (1) and the edited picture below (2).</seg>
<seg id="450">"black / white photography was always fascinating because of your abstraction ability. with the development of digital photography, black / white is a work step, as color images can be easily converted to the computer. also with a set of movie roll profiles."</seg>

<seg id="454">Rotfilter: simulates a black / white film exposure with a red lens filter. this creates dramatic celestial effects and can simulate moonlight scenes at the time of the day. so similar to 003 Cokin (tm) Rotfilter.</seg>
<seg id="455">Yellow filter: simulates a black / white film exposure with an yellow lens filter. this is the most natural color tone correction and improves the contrast. it is ideal for landscapes and thus similar to the 001 Cokin (tm) yellow filter.</seg>
<seg id="456">"Sepiaton: produces warm light and medium tones while it adds a bit cold to the shading tones. this is very similar to the process of the failure of a pressure and the redevelopment in a sepiatonic. this is typical for the photos of your grandmother, and therefore similar to the 005 Cokin (tm) Sepiafilter."</seg>
<seg id="457">With the & digious; apply tool texture you can apply decorative textures to a picture.</seg>
<seg id="458">"adding a texture to your image, regardless of whether it is a color image or not, you can make it look like an oil painting on a canvas, the stitch of an old master, a pop art portrait of enlarged points or like a wall picture on a wall."</seg>
<seg id="459">Relief: moving this parameter to the right increases the appearance of the depth or three dimensionality of texture on the picture.</seg>
<seg id="460">A paper texture effect has been applied on the photo below. the original picture is (1) and the changed under (2) to see. the parameter relief has been set to 200.</seg>
<seg id="461">With the & digime; add tool frame a decorative frame can be added to a picture.</seg>
<seg id="462">Keeping the eye of a viewer in the limits of a photo is not an easy task. a possibility to keep his attention is to set the image a decorative frame. this is a psychological barrier for the scattering eye. under image frame the module can be started from the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="463">"type: with this parameter, set the desired frame type for your image. penetrating the image with a thin line and a wide frame (ideal for black and white pictures), bevelled it with a nice three-dimensional frame that is ideal for a buttonhole and decorative element adding a decorative frame with patterns."</seg>
<seg id="464">Width: indicates the width of the frame in percent. the value range for the width is limited from 1% to 50%.</seg>
<seg id="465">"the target picture with the frame will be bigger than the original, but the same aspect ratio. this is important to print the images, especially if you have used the tool after aspect ratio beforehand."</seg>
<seg id="466">"with this handy tool, you can insert simple one formatted text into a picture at any place. this also goes in several places if you need it."</seg>
<seg id="467">"this tool is very intuitive to use. just enter text direction, orientation, color from the color space and character set with its properties as you need it. finally, simply select a frame around the text and / or a semi-transparent background."</seg>
<seg id="468">"each setting you have chosen for your text can be changed until you press the button" "OK". "once the image has been saved, the text is part of the picture. it can no longer be changed."</seg>
<seg id="469">With the & digime; tool template you can put a template over a picture.</seg>
<seg id="470">The Image template menu apply in image processing can be used to place stencils via a picture.</seg>
<seg id="471">"for the template, there are no limitations regarding size and orientation. however, you need to take the PNG file format and should work with maximum compression (9) to reduce the file size of the template."</seg>
<seg id="472">"if you use this tool for the first time, you need to set your stencil folder with the button root folder in the dialog. select the folder in which you have copied the stencil files. these settings will be noted for the next start."</seg>
<seg id="473">"after the root folder for the templates has been set, a tree view that reflects the folder structure of the stencil folder. selecting a folder updates the template's thumbnail automatically."</seg>
<seg id="474">Under the preview there are three buttons with which you can change the magnification factor and the position of your image.</seg>
<seg id="475">Enlarge: this button enlarges the underlying image. it is centered around the mouse position. check it with the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="476">"smaller: this button minimizes the image below. it is centered around the mouse position. if you want to apply the template to the whole picture, you must resize the image accordingly. check it with the left mouse button."</seg>
<seg id="477">Move this button to move it under the template. take the picture and place it at the desired position.</seg>
<seg id="478">Use OK if you want to apply the template to your image. the image will then be automatically adjusted to the preview size.</seg>
<seg id="479">& digicame; provides three different tools for sharpening. each one of you has advantages in other areas.</seg>
<seg id="480">"sharpening is a traditional tool for sharpening. it is very fast and easy, however, especially in dark areas, granular images."</seg>
<seg id="481">The algorithm has been taken from Gimp and it is copyrighted by Winston Chang.</seg>
<seg id="482">"refocus is possibly the best of the three, since it really improves the sharpness. it is a bit more complicated in its application and has different parameters for adjustment."</seg>
<seg id="483">Photos without focus as well as most digitised pictures need a correction of sharpness. this is because of the digitalization process colors with minimal differences to a color point. the same phenomenon can be observed when color points are printed on paper. SLR cameras normally require more afterwards sharpening than normal cameras for private users.</seg>
<seg id="484">"at JPEG pictures, a camera is often used in internal sharpening. pictures in the shell format, on the other hand, must always be sharpened during processing."</seg>
<seg id="485">"some scanners apply a field of focus already during reading the image. if you disable this, you will get control of your image."</seg>
<seg id="486">In some situations you can get useful results by sharpening a photo with the field of sharpening.</seg>
<seg id="487">"you should be careful, however, because the results are not very natural: the sharpening increases the sharpness of the edges, but also amplifies the noise. in general, you can refocus the tool to sharpen a picture. under refocus you will find further information and a comparison of all techniques for sharpening."</seg>
<seg id="488">Sometimes you have the opposite problem: a picture is too crunchy. the solution to draw the image a little soft is much easier than it to sharpen. use the tool for a soft sign with the menu entry Corrigate soft draw and experiment with settings. the preview window on the right side of the dialog shows you the effect on your photo.</seg>
<seg id="489">The filter blur is a very good tool to remove veils from your photos. a demonstration you can see here.</seg>
<seg id="490">The original image and preview help edit the image. the preview window displays the output of the filter with the current settings.</seg>
<seg id="491">"there are two important parameters, the radius and the amount. the standard values often produce good results and should first be tried. an increase in the radius or the amount enhances the effect. if you make the imsharpest mask too strong, noise and the impression of ridges are created near sharp edges."</seg>
<seg id="492">The radius turns one as many pixels on each side of a channel affected by the filter. high resolution images allow larger radii.</seg>
<seg id="493">The amount represents the percentage of the original and the blurred image that is added to the original. this will set the strength of the sharpness.</seg>
<seg id="494">"the threshold value is a fraction of the maximum RGB value and the applicable difference amount. in this way, areas with a soft change between the tones are exempt from the sharpening and hence avoided beauty errors in faces, skies and water surfaces."</seg>
<seg id="495">"this is an example of blurry masking filter. the original image is the (1) and the modified image is the (2). blurred masking was applied with radius = 6.0, amount = 0.5 and a threshold = 0.0."</seg>
<seg id="496">The & digicame; tool refocussed a picture by improving the sharpness. it used the copyright protected design filter algorithm by Ernst Lippe.</seg>
<seg id="497">This tool tries a picture to & quot; refocussed. this is better approach than just trying to sharpen the photo. this is better approach than just trying to sharpen the photo. you can start using a technique called FIR Viennese movie. you can start it from the menu by refocus colors in the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="498">"in practice, the circular deviation works much better than the Gauß's folding. the Gauß's folding has a very long tail, which means that the mathematical result is also influenced by the source pixel, which is far from the original pixel."</seg>
<seg id="499">"this is the radius of the circular circuit. it is the most important parameter for using this module. for most images, the default value should yield 1 good results."</seg>
<seg id="500">Correlation: an increase in correlation can help to reduce artefacts. the correlation can be chosen from 0-1. usable values are 0.5 and the values near 1, & eg; 0.95 and 0.99. a high value for correlation reduces the sharply effect of the module. "</seg>
<seg id="501">"noise filter: an increase in noise filter can help you reduce artefacts. however, values higher than 0.1 are rarely helpful. if the noise filter is too low, the image quality is very bad."</seg>
<seg id="502">"Gauß's sharpness: this is the radius for the palate's sharpness. if you use this parameter to avoid annoying artefacts. in most cases, you should use this value to zero to avoid annoying artefacts."</seg>
<seg id="503">"matrix size: this value determines the size of the transformation matrix. an increase in the size of the matrix can generate good results, especially if you choose large values for the circular sharpness or the gauge of the sharpness. in most cases, you should choose a value in the range of 3-10."</seg>
<seg id="504">The saving as and loading buttons are used exactly for this purpose. any refocused parameter you set will be saved for later and can then be loaded.</seg>
<seg id="505">"try to perform all the cutting, color and intensity correction on the image before using the module."</seg>
<seg id="506">"otherwise, you should use the module before you change the image otherwise. the reason for this is that many operations make changes that are not immediately visible, but later leave unpleasant artifacts."</seg>
<seg id="507">"when you read and compress images, & eg; as JPEG, you should apply the module to the uncompressed picture."</seg>
<seg id="508">"generally, blurred masking produces better results than sharpening. this could be caused by blurred masking a larger neighborhood used as sharpening."</seg>
<seg id="509">"in theory, blurry masking always has to produce artefacts. even under optimal conditions, it can never remove the effect of the sharpness. the FIR Viennese filter is almost as good as the Unsharper Mask. the FIR Viennese filter is often better for processing small details."</seg>
<seg id="510">"below you can see a comparison between the different filters, on a small unfocused image, see:"</seg>
<seg id="511">The original unsharp colour picture has to be corrected. this image has been made with an analogue camera. the unfocused result is due to inadequate light for the car focus lens.</seg>
<seg id="512">"for more information on the methods of sharpening in digital images, you can read a technical comparison in English at this address."</seg>
<seg id="513">The smoothness of the knob sets the sharpness of the range of darkened to create a more natural pupil.</seg>
<seg id="514">"the ink-tinte allows an adapted color for the pupil. if you want blue eyes instead of dark, then you can adjust this here."</seg>
<seg id="515">The tool image error correction is one of the most advanced tools to remove unwanted artefacts with unprecedented speed.</seg>
<seg id="516">The painting algorithm has been developed by IMAGE team of the Grec CNRS laboratories in Caen / France and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="517">This tool contains various presets as starting points to simplify the restoration. the available presets are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="518">"if you want to adjust the filter settings in case of fine adjustment, you can use the tab smoothing and advanced settings."</seg>
<seg id="519">"detail holding p [0, 100]: this controls the preservation of details. a small value leads to an even smoothing over the picture. a value of 0.9 should keep details so that no sharpening is necessary."</seg>
<seg id="520">"directional dependency Alpha [0,100]: a small value smoothes evenly in all directions, whereas a value close to 1 is smoothed in one direction. JPEG artefacts are best eliminated with a value near 1."</seg>
<seg id="521">"flatten [0, 500]: this sets the maximum smoothing factor above all. p then defines the relative smoothing."</seg>
<seg id="522">"regularity: [0, 100]: this parameter affects larger structures. the higher this value is set, the more is smoothed. even if you want to create a 'van Gogh' turbulence effect, it must be set higher than 3."</seg>
<seg id="523">Repetitions: specifies how often the algorithm is going through. normally here is 1 or 2.</seg>
<seg id="524">"angle increments since [5, 90]: angle-dependent integration of anisotropic Alpha. if Alpha is small, please note that small angles create a long runtime. so you should choose this value as much as possible and acceptable to your needs."</seg>
<seg id="525">"integral stride width [0,1, 10]: integral stride width in pixels. you should set the value of smaller 1 to avoid sub-pixel smoothing and never greater than 2."</seg>
<seg id="526">Linear interpolation use: the more quality that you receive by choosing this option is only low. it doubles the runtime. we therefore recommend him to permit him.</seg>
<seg id="527">The buttons Save as and Load exactly this. each setting of image errors can be corrected in a text file and recharged later.</seg>
<seg id="528">"correct image errors are comparatively very fast at work. however, it can take a long time and get a high CPU load. therefore, you can cancel the calculation at any time using the Cancel button."</seg>
<seg id="529">Below you can see how to remove picture error with small artefacts. the module is applied to a photo that was created in Guatemala City with an analogue camera. the original picture is under (1) to see and the corrected picture below (2).</seg>
<seg id="530">The & digious; noise reduction is a very powerful tool to lessen image exchange. it uses a copyrighted algorithm by Peter Heckert.</seg>
<seg id="531">"this tool provides selectable image filters to remove spots and other artefacts, e.g. dust or hair on the lens. it can also be used to remove sensor noise from the camera or Moireacute; effects of scanned images from books or magazines."</seg>
<seg id="532">"if you need more information about digital cameras from digital cameras, you can read them in English in this tutorial."</seg>
<seg id="533">The screenshot above shows a typical scene made with a digital camera and high ISO sensitivity. it shows a granular noise that can be removed successfully with this tool.</seg>
<seg id="534">"below you will find a complete description of all parameters. in most cases, you only need the sub-window details and the subwindow Advanced Settings can remain in default settings."</seg>
<seg id="535">"radius controls the window size, from 1 (3x3) to 20 (41x41), which is used for the filter."</seg>
<seg id="536">"sharpness: controls the sharpness level. this value sets the pixel spacing that the filter looks forward to see luminance changes. if the value is too high, the adaptive filter picture details can no longer be obtained and noise or smelling occurs again."</seg>
<seg id="537">Edges: controls the edge accuracy for the sharpness. this value improves the frequency response of the filter. if it is too strong cannot the entire noise be removed or noise tips can occur. set it to a value near the maximum if you want to remove a weak noise or JPEG artefacts without losing details.</seg>
<seg id="538">Light density: controls the luminance tolerance of the image. we recommend either color or luminance to change to improve a picture. these settings do not influence the smoothing process that is controlled by the details settings.</seg>
<seg id="539">Color: controls the color tolerances of the picture. we recommend to change colour or luminance to improve a picture. these settings do not influence the smoothing process that is controlled by the details settings.</seg>
<seg id="540">"gamma: controls the gmatance tolerance of the image. this value can be used to increase the tolerance values of the darker areas, which are typically more strongly taped to increase. however, it also contaminates the shadow areas."</seg>
<seg id="541">"attenuation: controls the adjudication of the phase jitter damping. this value defines how quickly the adaptive filter radius reacts on variations of the luminance. if it is increased, the edges may appear smoother when it is too high, noise and phase jitter appear on the edges. it can remove noise peaks and is the recommended method for it."</seg>
<seg id="542">Store under and load: these buttons are used exactly for this. all parameters for noise reduction you have set can be stored in the filesystem and loaded later.</seg>
<seg id="543">This is an example of how noise reduction can change your life. the original image is marked with (1) and the corrected with (2). the noise reduction was applied with the default settings.</seg>
<seg id="544">Sometimes a picture is too crunchy for your purpose. the solution to draw the image a little soft is fortunately much easier than a picture to sharpen. use the tool for the softmark with the menu entry Corrigate soft draw and experiment with the smoothing. the preview window on the right side of the dialog shows the effect of this operation on your photo.</seg>
<seg id="545">The & digious; photo restoration is definitely one of the most advanced tools to reduce photo artefacts.</seg>
<seg id="546">"this filter for restoration gives you the opportunity to remove a lot of unwanted artefacts from your pictures. it is very well adapted to remove Gauß's noise, film grades, scratches, compression artefacts and local errors that occur in digital, original or retrospectively digitised pictures."</seg>
<seg id="547">"the same algorithm can be used for color and texture reduction. the texture composition is developed with a different tool, the image error correction. the algorithm for restoration has been developed by the IMAGE team of the Grec CNRS laboratories in Caen / Frannkreich and is part of the CImg project."</seg>
<seg id="548">"JPEG artefacts reduce: compression of JPEG is not perfect, in some areas even very far away from it. as a lossy compression algorithm, it creates some compression & quot; Artefaktequot; - small standards that can be seen in uncompressed picture."</seg>
<seg id="549">The buttons Save as and Load exactly this. each setting of photo restoration can be saved to a text file and recharged later.</seg>
<seg id="550">"photo restoration is comparatively very fast at work. however, it can take a long time and get a high CPU load. therefore, you can cancel the calculation at any time using the button Finish."</seg>
<seg id="551">Below you can be restored like a photo with uniformly noise. the module is applied to a black and white photo that with a Minolta (tm) 700Si camera on an Ilford (tm) HP-5 movie with a sensitivity of 3200 ISO has been taken. the original picture is under (1) and the corrected under (2).</seg>
<seg id="552">Below you can see another example of the photo restoration. this time textures have been reduced to an old color photo that was read using a scanner. the original image is under (1) to see and the corrected picture below (2).</seg>
<seg id="553">The & digious; tool Hotpixel allows you to remove Hotpixel from photos that were connected to a CCD camera. it uses algorithms from the JPEGPixi project that are copyrighted by Martin Dickopp.</seg>
<seg id="554">"bright, dead or hot pixels are a problem particularly in high-quality raw mode photos, as many cameras with JPEG compression have a built-in suppression for hot pixels."</seg>
<seg id="555">"this tool can be used to remove & quot; hot Pixelquot; and" quot; bright Pixelquot; and "quot; bright Pixelquot; on a photo with a dark image extraction method. there is currently no manual method to select the bad pixels.</seg>
<seg id="556">Download this file in the wizard with the darkpicture button. the tool will automatically recognize the hot and light pixels. these are highlighted in the preview preview.</seg>
<seg id="557">"if you have an old digital camera, it is important that you can record the dark image directly to detect new hot or light pixels using CCD defects."</seg>
<seg id="558">"first, as described in the previous section, you should find the right dark image to the image to be corrected. an automatic processing of the dark image will find the bad pixels. note that the wizard shows up the last dark picture and will automatically download it in the next session."</seg>
<seg id="559">The image area and preview help you correct the result within the image. the preview window displays the output of the filter with the current settings. bad pixels are raised in all preview areas.</seg>
<seg id="560">Select an area around the defective pixel on the preview and see the results of the filter. then select the best filter method to interpolate these pixel blocks. these are the filters available:</seg>
<seg id="561">"Durision: it is determined an average of the neighbor pixel. the resulting color is assigned to all defective pixel in the block. for a 1-dimensional interpolation, this is done separately for the horizontal and vertical line."</seg>
<seg id="562">Linear: all pixels that have a distance of 1 from pixel block are drawn to the calculation of a bi-linear surface (2-dim) or a group of linear curves (1-dim). these are then used to interpolate the defective pixel in the block.</seg>
<seg id="563">Square: this is the default filter method. all pixels with a distance of 2 or less to pixel block are drawn to calculate a bi-square surface (2-dim) or a group of square curves (1-dim) that is then used to interpolate the pixels in the block.</seg>
<seg id="564">"cubic: all pixels with a distance of 3 or less are drawn to calculate a bi-cubic surface (2-dim) or a group of cubic curves (1-dim), which is then used to interpolate the defective pixel in the block."</seg>
<seg id="565">Below you can see the Hotpixel correction on a color photo from a defective digital camera with a sensitivity of 200 ISO and long exposure. the original image has been enlarged to 300% (1) and the corrected picture is under (2).</seg>
<seg id="566">"the & digious; vignetting correction is a tool to correct the vignetting, i.e. underexposed corners, of an image."</seg>
<seg id="567">"wide angle lenses, especially the medium and large photo format, can often not illuminate the entire sensor range. instead & quot; vignettierenquot; (shaded) they reduce the corners and edges of the picture by reducing the light that reaches the sensor. Telelenses also show this behavior."</seg>
<seg id="568">"many center filters need a factor 1.5 or 2 with the aperture filter, which increases the necessary shutter speed under certain circumstances. wide angle lenses should also be used with center filters, an aperture of f / 16 or smaller, since otherwise unwanted effects are caused by movement."</seg>
<seg id="569">"with the great exposure area of today's film and film scanners, it is possible to simulate the effect of an Centerfilter by using an equivalente transformation in a rough image that was made without this filter. the tool vignetting correction is used to transform the transformation with an Centerfilter on an image. the algorithm is protected by copyright by John Walker."</seg>
<seg id="570">"with three regulators, you can control the vignetting correction filter and with three more exposures of the target image."</seg>
<seg id="571">"density: this parameter controls the degree of light amplification at the point of the greatest density the filter. the standard density is 2.0, resulting in an optical filter with an aperture of 1, or by chance to compensate a greater degree of vignetting, reduce it by a small degree to compensate."</seg>
<seg id="572">"luminous intensity, contrast and gamma settings: editing an image with the vignetting correction reduces the brightness of the pixels. you need to re-adjust the exposure of the target image using these options. the controls provide only positive values, as you only need to increase the settings."</seg>
<seg id="573">"if you want a finer readjustment of the target image, let the values for luminosity / contrast / gamma at zero and use the gradation from the & digicame; image editing from the Color Gradation menu."</seg>
<seg id="574">This is an example of the vignetting correction to a picture. the original image (1) shows the vignetting in the corners and (2) the corrected image. a luminous and contrast correction was also performed in the image with this tool.</seg>
<seg id="575">The & digicame; lens distortion is a tool to correct the impact of spherical lenses on photos. it uses a copyrighted algorithm by David Hodson.</seg>
<seg id="576">This tool works with geometric distortions. colour distortions cannot be corrected with this tool.</seg>
<seg id="577">The coefficient of the second degree covers the general geometrical distortion of the lens and can correct the concave or convex form of the image.</seg>
<seg id="578">"the coefficient of the third degree has a similar round effect, but flap on the edges. this correction is not applied in the tool."</seg>
<seg id="579">The coefficient fourth grades fixes the distant corners opposite to that of the second grader. if you combine these two can almost eliminated any geometrical distortion.</seg>
<seg id="580">"general: this value controls the strength of distortion second grading. with negative values, tonical distortions can be corrected and positive values can be distorted."</seg>
<seg id="581">Corner: this value controls the strength of distortion fourth gradient. this value appears more strongly at the edges than in the middle of the picture. for most lenses the 'corners parameter has the inverted character of the parameter.</seg>
<seg id="582">Zoom: this value rescales the image size and thus creates a correction of the first grader. negative values increase while positive the image diminishes.</seg>
<seg id="583">Note: this value adjusts the brightness in the corners of the picture. negative values decrease the brightness of the image in the corners while positive values increase it.</seg>
<seg id="584">"to help you find the best filter settings, the dialog shows the distortion correction. the values you use for your image are saved and used as default values at the next start."</seg>
<seg id="585">"the correction should be performed before all trimming or size changes. in case you re-cut a picture and then perform a ton-shaped correction, the effect would be obvious to the false."</seg>
<seg id="586">"to help you find the best correction, this tool provides you with a vertical and horizontal guide. move it to an important place like e.g. the sea edge or a building wall, in your picture and press the left mouse button to fix the lines at this point."</seg>
<seg id="587">"if you correct a cushion-like distortion, the resulting image will have black corners. you can remove them with the cutting tool in the Edit menu transformation from image processing or via the Zoom slider of this dialog."</seg>
<seg id="588">"for most pictures, the tonical correction is enough. the next logical step for some motives, such as photos from the front, frame and paintings, is to correct the perspective so that all angles in the picture have 90 degrees."</seg>
<seg id="589">This is an example of the tonical correction applied to a church in Norway. the original image is under (1) and the corrected picture below (2).</seg>
<seg id="590">"the algorithm is based on a method for simulating infrared film of the GimpGuru.org website that is available under this URL. the filter reproduces the known Ilford (tm) SFX200 Iinfrarotfilm, see this URL. this film has a sensitivity range of 200-800 ISO."</seg>
<seg id="591">"in the left side of the window, you can select the area for preview. if you move the red rectangle with the mouse, you can view the effect on different parts of the image."</seg>
<seg id="592">Below the preview you can set two parameters of film granularity and film sensitivity (ISO). the ISO regulator changes the amount of film granularity and dominance of colour green (chlorophyll in nature). green meadows are white like snow!</seg>
<seg id="593">"since the filter color channels are mixed to reproduce infrared film, especially the green channel makes no sense to apply the effect on black / white photos as the colour information is missing."</seg>
<seg id="594">This is an example of the infrared film type applied to a landscape foto from New Zealand. the original image is under (1) and the edited picture below (2). the sensitivity of the film was set to ISO 400. higher ISO values generate a kind of aura in the top lights.</seg>
<seg id="595">"this is known by classic high-speed films such as the B / W Kodak Tri-X. to increase the sensitivity of the films, the manufacturers mix large silver grains of photoemulsion."</seg>
<seg id="596">"the screen effect gives your photo a certain mood or seems to move back into the past. the treated image gets a timeless atmosphere detached from everyday life. if you want to use this special, gallery-like, streak view especially in your monochrome photos, you have to use this filter."</seg>
<seg id="597">"the controller can calibrate the ISO sensitivity to control the intensity and granularity of the grains. if you need more grains, you can apply the filter several times."</seg>
<seg id="598">This is an example of the screen saver effect applied to a black / white picture. the original image is the (1) and that worked the (2). the used film sensitivity corresponds to ISO-1600.</seg>
<seg id="599">The & digious filter oil paintings creates the appearance of an oil painting. it uses a protected algorithm by Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="600">The & digious filter oil painting gives your digital images a nice look like an oil painting. nature pictures and still life are good for this effect.</seg>
<seg id="601">"there are two knobs to influence this effect. the upper elects the brush size between one and five. thicker brushes are better for large pictures. smoothing the smoothness or, seen from the other side, the hinge."</seg>
<seg id="602">This is an example of the oil painting effect. the original picture is marked with the (1) and the processing is marked with the (2). brush size for this 640 Pixel size is 1 and smoothed 17.</seg>
<seg id="603">"the & digicame; filter coal drawing uses color and intensity gradients to create a carbon sketch. therefore, images whose gradients are slowly changing are not ideal for this effect. it is helpful if you imagine what scene you would have chosen to sketch you. this would be good pictures to start with it."</seg>
<seg id="604">There are two controllers with a value range from 1 to 100 to control this effect. the upper controller selects the pin size and the lower adjusts the contrast (smoothed).</seg>
<seg id="605">This is an example of the charcoal drawing filter. the original image (1) and the modified image (2). the default settings of 30 and 10 were used. the result can be further improved by adjusting the intensity value.</seg>

<seg id="610">With this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a work of art using distortion effects. it uses protected algorithms from Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="611">Wave Blocks 1: divide the image into cells and look like it is viewed through glass blocks.</seg>
<seg id="612">Wave Blocks 2: analogous to the wave blocks 1 the image is distorted here with another version of glass blocks.</seg>
<seg id="613">Some effects need a long time to calculate and generate a high CPU load. you can cancel these effects at any time using the button Finish.</seg>
<seg id="614">With this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a work of art using Unsharpening Effects. it uses copyrighted algorithms from Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="615">Zoom Unsharfe: blurred the image along star-shaped lines that emanate from one center. this simulates the sharpness of a zooming camera and thus creates a dynamic expression of the often shown in sports photography.</seg>
<seg id="616">Radial sharpness: blurred the image by turning the pixels at a center. this simulates the sharpness of a rotating camera.</seg>
<seg id="617">Distance sharpening: wipe the picture to create the effect of a non-focused camera lens. the object seems to step back into the background.</seg>
<seg id="618">"motion blurred: blurred the image by horizontal movements of pixels. this simulates the sharpness of a linear moving, z: B: from a car or train photographer, camera."</seg>
<seg id="619">"softness: blurred the image softly in the dark and strong in the bright tones. this creates photos with a dreamy and shiny soft focus effect (Hamilton effect). this is ideal for creating romantic portraits, glamour photos or adding a warm and subtle light."</seg>
<seg id="620">Sharpness: blurred the image by accidental shift of pixels and thus simulates the sharpness of a randomly moving camera.</seg>
<seg id="621">Intelligent Unsharpening: finds the tank in the picture and wipe them without changing the rest.</seg>
<seg id="622">"mosaic: divides the photo into rectangular cells and then creates it, by filling with an average pixel value, new."</seg>
<seg id="623">Some effects need a long time to calculate and cause a high CPU load. you can therefore cancel this calculation at any time using the button Finish.</seg>
<seg id="624">The raindrops are a nice little tool to make raindrops on your image. this gives it natural to your images a wet look. it uses one of Pieter Voloshyn copyrighted algorithm.</seg>
<seg id="625">Droplet size allows to change the size of the drops. since the size of the droplet is not automatically growing with the size of the image it is often necessary to decrease the size for small images. number changes the number and density of drops.</seg>
<seg id="626">"you can use the & digime; image processing to hold an area free of raindrops. use the selection tool to select the area, e.g. a face that should remain free. if you then start the filter raindrops the area will remain free of rain drops."</seg>
<seg id="627">This is an example of the rain drops Filters. the original image (1) shows a quiet sunset and the edited picture (2) indicates a sunset after a storm. the default values were used for this example.</seg>
<seg id="628">"if the photo has the wrong orientation, you can bring it through mirrors or turning into the right direction. the tools can be found in the Edit menu Transformation or transforming mirrors."</seg>
<seg id="629">Inflating is definitely one of the most advanced tools to enlarge a photo with a minimal loss of image quality.</seg>
<seg id="630">The big question is how can you inflate a picture and keep the details sharp? how can you zoom in a picture when the limits of the resolution are reached? how can you re-locate the missing information or guess it? the CImg algorithm that is used here makes a good work here. try it and you will see it yourself.</seg>
<seg id="631">"if a photo has the wrong size, you can scale it to the desired size with the tool size. choose transformative size change in the menu and specify the target values. the dialog is to be seen below."</seg>
<seg id="632">"the tool to change size uses a linear interpolation method to tweak the pixels. if you want to enlarge a small picture with a better quality, try the tool for blowing."</seg>
<seg id="633">"many image processing programs use a kind of interpolation, e.g. spline interpolation to enlarge an image. & digicame; uses a further developed approach. the underlying algorithm photo was developed by the IMAGE team of the Grec CNRS laboratories in Caen / France and is part of the CImg project."</seg>
<seg id="634">You must tell the tool how you want to change the size. these settings are available in the tab New Size and are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="635">"if this setting is enabled, the aspect ratio of the original image is retained when entering the new size."</seg>
<seg id="636">"regularity: [0, 100]: this parameter affects larger structures. the higher this value is set, the more is smoothed. even if you want to create a 'van Gogh' turbulence effect, it must be set higher than 3."</seg>
<seg id="637">"buttons Save As and Loading are used exactly for this purpose, and each one can be enlarged as a text file, and can be recharged later."</seg>
<seg id="638">"inflating is very fast with what it does, but it can take a long time and pull a high CPU load. you can cancel the calculation at any time using the button Finish."</seg>
<seg id="639">You can see below an example of photo bubbles by enlarging a small color on the double size. the original is (1) and the enlarged picture (3). the preview (2) is the result of linear standard magnification.</seg>
<seg id="640">"the editing of a photo is not only a frequently performed surgery, but also a frequently underestimated tool to create a picture. the image processing allows you to create a picture with the mouse, by pressing the mouse button and dragging the rectangle, then you will see this rectangle while you move the mouse."</seg>
<seg id="641">"when you release the mouse button again, the area of the photos will be cut off. you can change the size of the area to be cut by dragging on the corners of the rectangle. create a new rectangle by simply pressing the left mouse button."</seg>
<seg id="642">"once you are satisfied with the cutting, use the button The Cutting button of image editing in the toolbar and the photo is cut (Ctrl; + X)."</seg>
<seg id="643">"in the preview area, you can change the size of the rectangle by dragging the corners with the mouse. the aspect ratio that you have defined in the dialog remains."</seg>
<seg id="644">"in the mold After the aspect ratio, you can specify orientation as portrait format or landscape format. in the portrait mode, the larger value of the height and in the landscape format is assigned to the width."</seg>
<seg id="645">"this means that it is always the same regardless of whether you use centimeters, inch or any other physical size. you can e.g. see below a list of traditional sizes for photo paper and their aspect ratio."</seg>
<seg id="646">"at the right end of the dialog, there are two buttons to automatically center the selection horizontally or vertically."</seg>
<seg id="647">"in the dialog box below, you can use the Max-ratio button to cut the area to the maximum possible, depending on the chosen ratio and orientation."</seg>
<seg id="648">"the tool after aspect ratio automatically saves its settings depending on the image orientation (horizontal or vertical). if you use the cutting tool the next time, these settings are stored as default values in the EXIF tables, so that the EXIF data will reflect the cut image and not the original image."</seg>
<seg id="649">The settings of the co-operation help allow you to fade assistance so that you can better put your pictures together. these help are:</seg>
<seg id="650">Harmonic triangle: harmonic divisions are based on the principle of similarity.</seg>
<seg id="651">"golden centre: the golden centre is a division which is based on various natural growth patterns, such as the spiral of Nautilus shell or the flower leaves of a sunflower. it appears in all sorts of things that we feel as beautiful."</seg>
<seg id="652">"the golden division is the Irrationale number 1,618033988... and you have been used by the ancient Egyptians and Greeks, so that your temples and pyramids constructed it in all times when you put your pictures, buildings and even photos to give your creations a natural order and beauty."</seg>
<seg id="653">"the number is derived from the Fibonacci sequence 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34 & etc. the resulting divider is 1: 1.618 the golden centre. the resulting divider is considered visually harmonious."</seg>
<seg id="654">The golden centre provides liquid auxiliary lines when you put together a picture. these aids are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="655">"the golden spiral will bring you to your goal good results for your photos. compared to the third rule, the golden spiral produces a liquid line that can follow the eye through the image. this type of composition leads the gaze of the viewer along the line of the spiral and creates a symmetrical visual flow."</seg>
<seg id="656">"another rule is the rectangles of the golden spiral, also called golden rectangles."</seg>
<seg id="657">"the Golden triangles are also derived from the golden spirals discussed above. their vertices are the middle points of the sides of the golden rectangle. note that, unlike the harmonic triangles, golden triangles are no simultaneous triangles."</seg>
<seg id="658">"if you use golden triangles to break your frame, you create an effect of the dynamic symmetry of professional photographers. try to place your image focus on one of the intersection and other visual information in the triangles. the result is a very attractive composition that you cannot achieve differently."</seg>
<seg id="659">The horizontal mirror and vertical mirror options can be used to reflect the harmonic divisions.</seg>
<seg id="660">"with the button color you can set the color of the auxiliary lines. if you have a picture with many colors and a high contrast, the guides can be invisible. this way you can adjust the color of lines to your current image."</seg>
<seg id="661">The Free Rotation is a tool to rotate an image around any angle.</seg>
<seg id="662">"if you make a photo, it happens easily that you don't hold the camera exactly vertically or horizontally. this creates a picture in which things are rotated by an angle. you can do this with the & digious; image editing and the tool free rotation. select Transaction Free Rotation and adjust the target angle."</seg>
<seg id="663">Rotate your picture with the slider angle. the values on this slider are set in degrees. a preview of the rotation is available on the right side of the window. a preview of the rotation is displayed on the right side of the window. the new dimensions of the image are shown at the top right of the window.</seg>
<seg id="664">"for your help, the Free Rotation module provides a horizontal and vertical line. move the mouse cursor in the image preview to position the two lines. after you have moved it over an important point of the image, you can fix it with a pressure on the left mouse button. now adjust the angle as described in previous section."</seg>
<seg id="665">"once you shot a picture you will find unwanted triangular holes in the corners. a way to repair it, it is the function transformating cutting from the image processing."</seg>
<seg id="666">An elegant way to trim the picture is automatic cutting. choose one of the following options:</seg>
<seg id="667">"the anti-aliasing option smoothes the image a bit after rotation, but notice the above warning."</seg>
<seg id="668">All perspective transformations are performed around a fixed point of the so-called reference point. this point is in the middle of the picture and is represented by a red circle.</seg>
<seg id="669">"to change the perspective, you need to use the red squares at the corners of your image. the preview will then be automatically re-calculated. on the right side of the dialog you will find some information that will help you change the perspective:"</seg>
<seg id="670">"new width: displays the width of the new image, including the empty areas created by the transformation, in pixels."</seg>

<seg id="674">Angle left below: displays the current angle in degrees at the lower left corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="675">Angle on the right: displays the current angle in degrees at the lower right corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="676">"after adjusting the perspective, the image becomes a little dirty. for a single adaptation, this effect is small but two adaptations generate twice as strong effect and you should avoid this if possible."</seg>
<seg id="677">"once you have adapted the perspective, you will get unwanted triangular holes at the corners. one way to regret it is to cut the picture with transformations from the image processing."</seg>
<seg id="678">"with other words, a rectangle is distorted into a parallelogram. in other words, a rectangle is turned into a parallelogram. you can start this module about transformers."</seg>
<seg id="679">"adjust your image by using the horizontal angle and vertical angle. if you click on presets, the angle will be reset to zero. a preview of the effect will be displayed to you and the new dimensions of the target picture will be displayed on the right of the preview area."</seg>

<seg id="1656">A MIDI-Map is a text file that saves all the necessary translations for the playback of a piece.</seg>
<seg id="1657">"each section may only appear once, except the keymap section, which may appear as often as desired. however, the condition for this is that each occurrence has a different textid (see below)."</seg>

<seg id="1660">Please send me your Map file as an email so I can offer in future versions of & kmid; support can provide for devices that are not General MIDI-compatible.</seg>
<seg id="1661">This section describes how the patches of General MIDI are displayed on your specific keyboard. general usage looks as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1662">"please note that the left side of the equal sign is ignored. it is assumed that the GM-patches are in the correct order (from 0 to 127), so you may not change the order and not leave any row for one of the 128 instruments."</seg>
<seg id="1663">"the optional AllKeysTo M is needed to put all the sounds that this instrument need to place on the sound with the number M. if your keyboard is not supported (GM-Patch 127), you can use a drum (e.g. with sound 60), which is similar to a gun shot."</seg>
<seg id="1664">"so if a MIDI file is to play a note with patch 127 (gun shot), it takes patch 100 (the drum on your keyboard) and plays the sound 60, regardless of which sound is in the MIDI file."</seg>
<seg id="1665">"please note that here with the term" "drum patch" "the patch is meant in which each sound represents another percussion instrument (drum, cymbal, maracas & etc;) and not the one where the sound means the pitch of the same drum (like some keyboards)."</seg>
<seg id="1666">The Keymap section is used to specify how sounds are displayed on a specific channel or instrument. the use is:</seg>
<seg id="1667">"like the PATCHMAP section, the sequence of lines is very important, as well as its presence. so you have to create 128 entries."</seg>
<seg id="1668">You can define several keymaps for each channel and instrument. you only have to use different names in the first line.</seg>
<seg id="1669">Keymaps are mainly used to depict sounds on the percussion channel. take a look at the provided keymaps as an example.</seg>
<seg id="1670">"this section can be used to make some channels down to others. for example, if you want to swap the first and the second channel, simply check out the CHANNELMAP section."</seg>
<seg id="1671">"however, these settings are useful for keyboards, which have the percussion on a specific channel (General MIDI to Channel 10, others need channels 16 or 9)."</seg>
<seg id="1672">"Midi devices need 16 channels, the CHANNELMAP section has 16 lines, numbered from 0 to 15, based on the following pattern:"</seg>
<seg id="1673">"if you use the ForcePatch option, all events will be ignored. if you use the ForcePatch option, all events will be ignored to change the patch on this channel. in this case, the patch x is always used."</seg>
<seg id="1674">The ForcePatch option may be useful for example to always use the percussions patch on the percussion channel.</seg>
<seg id="1675">"the value for PitchBenderRatio specifies in which ratio Pitch-Bender events are multiplied. if a MIDI file sends a Pitch-Bender event with the value n, this is then used with the n * (r / 4096) and then only forwarded. the value 4096 is used so that in the map file no decimal commas are available)."</seg>
<seg id="1676">"this setting is needed because GM has given that a keyboard which is supposed to play a pitch higher with the value 4096, a tone higher. unfortunately, some keyboards will try to play two notes up to one octave higher. to find the right value on your keyboard, you'll need to try a bit with & kmid;"</seg>
<seg id="1677">"to use a MIDI-map, simply open the MIDI settings dialog."</seg>
<seg id="1678">The channel view is a window with a whole series of keyboard (one for each MIDI channel). on these keyboards you see which sounds are being played.</seg>
<seg id="1679">"you can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a specific channel. for each channel, there is a selection list where you can select an instrument. if you change an instrument, the button lights no more green but red to indicate that no longer the original instrument is used."</seg>
<seg id="1680">The channel view (until now) has two different views to display the played sounds. view the Settings menu under the point channel view: settings</seg>
<seg id="1681">"the tempo-LCD displays the speed with which a song is played. the higher the number, the greater the speed."</seg>
<seg id="1682">"you can change the tempo of a song. so if you find, for example, a song is too fast to follow the text, you can slow down it. to change the pace, use the arrows to the left and right of the LCD."</seg>
<seg id="1683">"a MIDI file is a file that contains information about how to play a piece of music. it contains the notes, the rhythm, speed, & etc;. this allows the same MIDI file to be played on two different devices, just like two different musicians perform the same notes in very different ways."</seg>
<seg id="1684">"well, I can't force anyone, & kmid; but a typical MIDI file needs about 50 KB, while an mp3 file needs 4 MB (a compression ratio of 1: 80) and with a good synthesizer you can also change the individual instruments, speed & etc; you have control over everything."</seg>
<seg id="1685">"that can happen if you have a binary distribution (rpm, deb) by & kmid; that happens because & kmid; without AWE support compiled. to eliminate the problem you need to download and install a source distribution (for example by kmid; 's home page)"</seg>

<seg id="2038">"if there are many tags in the markup language, it is recommended to subdivide the tags in logical groups. in any case, it is not too many, so you can create a toolbar with the name of the market."</seg>

<seg id="2043">Igitt! is this an ugly symbol. who should remember the action in connection with this symbol? we replace it before we have difficulty.</seg>

<seg id="2057">Perhaps the most notorious extension of & quantaplus; for the normal user is the possibility to add documentation for the scripting language or the formatting language you like most. this is why this chapter describes how I create a & PHP application tree for my personal use.</seg>
<seg id="2058">"before you start your own documentation, you could check in & quantaplus; Repository check if someone has done it for you."</seg>
<seg id="2059">"there are two parts in this process. first you need to create an existing documentation for the formatting / script / etc; language. then, you need to create the docrc file."</seg>
<seg id="2060">"# KDE configuration file [Tree] Doc dir = path, relative to this file, to the documentation HTML files e.g. php42 / # elements in the Main Index Top element = your description for these documentations e.g. & PHP; 4.2 Documentation Section 1 = Section1.html Sec2.2 = Sec2.3.html"</seg>
<seg id="2061">"the tree section defines the visible part of the documentation in the documentation tree. for example, see the & PHP documentation for example:"</seg>
<seg id="2062">"# KDE Config File [Tree] Doc dir = php42 / # top level elements Top element = PHP 4.2 documentation PHP 4.2 documentation = Table of contents, # Getting Started, # Language Reference Table of Contents = index.html Getting Started = Introduction,... Basic syntax = language.basic-syntax.html..."</seg>
<seg id="2063">Note the # before Getting Started and Language Reference. this indicates that it is subfolders in the tree with its own content. there is no known border for the depth of the box (except through reason) mdash; but try it yourself.</seg>
<seg id="2064">"note that the contents directory is referenced directly to a file (and consequently, at the top end of the tree view & mdash; folder will be displayed!)."</seg>
<seg id="2065">Spaces do not influence anything but pay attention to & lt; characters. these should be replaced by & amp; and & lt; in all & XML; -based & quantaplus; resources to be replaced.</seg>
<seg id="2066">"for example, when writing a & PHP script, the documentation for the mysql _ fetch _ array function is to be displayed. by marking the function name and pressing Ctrl; H for context help the documentation would be displayed directly. there are only two types of entries here: the context list (ContextList) and the file connection lines."</seg>

<seg id="2070">"with & quantaplus; you are not alone. it is possible to share the separated resources (DTEP packets, toolbars with actions, scripts, templates) with others. there are two ways to do this:"</seg>
<seg id="2071">"the resources can be sent by email to friends, partners or else to whom. at different locations, you will send an email menu entry, such as DTD DTD package (DTEP) with email, in the context menu of files and folders in the templates and in the script tree."</seg>
<seg id="2072">"the resources can be uploaded to our main archive, from where all other & quantaplus; users can download them."</seg>
<seg id="2073">"when you upload your passphrase for your private GPG key (the passphrase will not be saved), or in the event that you have multiple keys, the input fields have to be filled out (URL preview can remain empty) and click OK to upload the upload."</seg>
<seg id="2074">"uploading can be uploaded from the DTD DTD package (DTEP) menu, toolbars toolbar, and started in the context menu of files and folders in the templates and scripts tree."</seg>
<seg id="2075">"after downloading a resource still before installation, we investigate & quantaplus; the integrity of the resource by checking the integrity and the signature. if the integrity is given and the resource is correctly signed, a message appears with the indication of the resource of the resource."</seg>
<seg id="2076">"it is possible to work in XML languages that are currently not supported by & quantaplus; however, the creation can be time-consuming because hundreds of tag files could be needed in tagXML format. there is the simpler way to automatically convert a DTD into a DTEP package."</seg>
<seg id="2077">"the conversion can be started from the DTD Load and Convert DTD menu. select the .dtd file with the DTD description, which should be used. after that, the following dialog appears:"</seg>

<seg id="2084">Local elements represent a personal collection of web development agents for a single user. these are user-specific patterns and toolbars. local elements are stored in the user's directory so that they can only use this user personally.</seg>
<seg id="2085">"project-related items are only available within a specific project. this can be anything from & CSS; samples to toolbar with special actions specially for the files of a particular project. simply, this is the most restricted size. all elements are emounced in the folder tree of the project, which emounding the sharing of special tools and patterns of all employees within the project."</seg>

<seg id="2087">"you can click the card driver with the right mouse button to get a context menu with the current document matching entries, such as closing, delete, or upload the document, jump to a bookmarks or execution of CVS commands to the current document."</seg>
<seg id="2088">"right-click in the editor area will lead to a further context menu concerning the edited documentary content, such as basic processing steps (cutting / copying / paste / paste), editing the tags on the mouse pointer or opening the file if the string is called a file under the mouse pointer."</seg>

<seg id="2091">"the building manners (QIT;) make it possible to navigate to & quantaplus; navigate, open them and strip them. in the presentation with card grids are available for files, project, sample templates, document structure, scripts, attributes and documentation building manners."</seg>

<seg id="2283">"the program used by me showed me only the changed lines, but I could not see what had changed exactly within these lines. and there was no indication of the places where perhaps only the indentation had changed. the merging of these changes was a small nightmare."</seg>
<seg id="2284">This was the beginning. the first version of & kdiff3; could represent differences within a line and changes to white signs. later a lot of other useful functions were added later.</seg>

<seg id="2968">How to start and stop init actually system services? quite simple: each of the scripts is written in such a way that it is an argument like start and stop. you can actually start these scripts by hand on the command line as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2969">"this would stop the httpd server. init reads the name, and when the one K includes, the script is invoked with the argument stop. if it includes an S, the script will start with the argument start."</seg>
<seg id="2970">"some people want a simple way to set machines for many purposes. I could & eg; a server runlevel that only lets httpd, & Sendmail;, Network & etc; running. in addition, I could also have a user runlevel that starts & eg; & kdm;, Network & etc."</seg>
<seg id="2971">Here you learn how to use & ksysv; it should not be very difficult because the program was created as user-friendly as possible.</seg>
<seg id="2972">The use of & ksysv; with a mouse or another pointer is simple to not say trivial: simply drag an entry from the range of available system services to one of the six runways to start it on this level (or stop).</seg>
<seg id="2973">You can also move scripts between Runleveln or change the position within a level by dragging it somewhere else. this will only happen if they draw an entry from the range of available system services.</seg>
<seg id="2974">"note: entries are moved if you move them into a new area. to simply copy them to a new runlevel, you must explicitly copy from the Edit menu or from the context menu and insert them into the target area -- even if the same entry already exists in the target area of the action."</seg>
<seg id="2975">"the sorting number of an entry can sometimes not be calculated. in such a case, you need to edit the sorting numbers of the surrounding entries before you can try again to insert the system service."</seg>
<seg id="2976">"note: currently, there is no way to restore entries thrown into the recycle bin. so be careful."</seg>
<seg id="2977">"you can use the tabulator key to activate the different workspaces (available system services, runlevel 1 start, runlevel 1 stop & etc;) as well as the cursor keys to make a selection above or below the previous one."</seg>
<seg id="2978">"to move an entry to another runlevel, move it into the clipboard (you can also use Ctrl; X) and insert it into the desired runlevel with insert (with Ctrl; V)."</seg>
<seg id="2979">"to change the sorting number or name of an entry manually, press Enter key to change the properties dialog. close the tab key to accept the changes, or press Esc to discard the changes."</seg>
<seg id="2980">"because of the risk of data loss, all entries in the File menu will require confirmation before running."</seg>
<seg id="2981">"all settings are stored in $KDEHOME / share / config / ksysvrc. default settings are taken from the global file ($KDEDIR / share / config / ksysvrc), if it is available. otherwise, they will be saved by & ksysv; stored in a local ksysvrc."</seg>
<seg id="2982">"I experimented with the standard Runleveln, and now the machine boots up constantly. what can I do?"</seg>
<seg id="2983">Enter linux single on the LILO -Prompt linux single and press Enter key to start in single-user mode. then edit the file / etc / inittab and change the default runlevel to a reasonable value (3 should normally be in order).</seg>
<seg id="2984">"I have some system services provided with & ksysv; for implementation under Runlevel X, but they are not executed."</seg>
<seg id="2985">"if you are using & SuSE; or Delix (DLD), you need to edit additional files in / etc that are only available in these distributions. please read the details in the manual of the distribution."</seg>
<seg id="2986">"the way system services are started in these distributions, simplifies configuration for the proprietary installation programs of these distributions, but does not correspond to any standard. the authors of & ksysv; are planning an extension of the program for this approach."</seg>
<seg id="2987">"if you use another distribution, please check if all configuration files are provided (and whether they are in the right directory). some services (such as & eg; Apache or httpd) are simply quit without notice when their configuration files are not available or incorrectly installed."</seg>
<seg id="2988">"the meaning of the & Linux; Runlevel varies from distribution to distribution, can even be different from version to version. if you use another distribution, please send me information about the runlevel to allow this manual to be added to this manual."</seg>
<seg id="2989">This documentation refers to & kuser; 1.0. with this program you can manage the users and groups of your system.</seg>
<seg id="2990">"to start with & kuser; to start, it is sufficient to read the chapter adaptation of & kuser; to read."</seg>
<seg id="2991">"after you have made changes, you need to save it. either you can use the corresponding icon of the toolbar or save the entry in the File menu."</seg>
<seg id="2992">"the main window consists of two cards, the user and the user group list. to edit, select the desired user or group with a double click on the entry."</seg>
<seg id="2993">"some map cards are only displayed if you have advanced system settings. only if you have enabled space restrictions (quota) for users, a card card will be created if Shadow Passwords or e.g. / etc / master.passwd are installed like in BSD Unixes."</seg>
<seg id="2994">"the card map Password Management appears when Shadow Passwords, or for example, / etc / master.passwd are installed like in BSD Unixes."</seg>
<seg id="2995">"this map only appears if for at least a built-in file system restriction (Quota) is activated and initialized (recognizable at the file quota.user / quota.group on the filesystem). here you can change parameters for each user, with the limited restrictions in KB are:"</seg>
<seg id="2996">These parameters can be individually set for each filesystem. the current filesystem is selected using the File System field with space restriction.</seg>
<seg id="2997">"the card card groups inform about group affiliations of the selected user. the standard group, which the user owns, can be found in the field Primary Group. furthermore, the user can become a member of other groups by marking them in the large field."</seg>
<seg id="2998">"the Group's dialog properties include a list of all users. to add a user to the group, select this user in the list."</seg>
<seg id="2999">"to add a user or group, select Add from the User or Group or click the appropriate Add button of the toolbar. editing or deletion of the selected user or the selected group functions analog."</seg>
