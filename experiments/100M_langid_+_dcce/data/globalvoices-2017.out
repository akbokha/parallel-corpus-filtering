&quot; although I had visited the USA at least once a year since 2012 , I would live there for the first time . &quot;
and that was very exciting for me .
my love for America is extra@@ ordin@@ arily large .
&quot; as many of my generation I grew up with American movies , I d@@ anced to American music , read American writers and run their sport . &quot;
&quot; in fact , this country had such a profound effect on me that I was mainly a journalist because of an American film . &quot;
&quot; as a 14 @-@ year @-@ old , I saw the great D@@ enz@@ el Washington , how he played the Gray Gran@@ th@@ am in The Pel@@ ican letter , a fear@@ less repor@@ ter who wanted to occupy the mur@@ der@@ ous conspir@@ acy of an oil @-@ mag@@ n@@ ate with the help of Julia Rober@@ ts as a Jura @-@ student . &quot;
I was im@@ pris@@ oned .
&quot; according to Method Man , &quot; me it was as if this is the absolute truth , forget everything else , that &apos;s what I want to do with my life . &quot;
&quot; and the year I lived in Arizona , my admir@@ ation for the USA had only strengthened . &quot;
&quot; I always said , &quot; &quot; America is the only country in which I have ever lived , whose diversity is so inviting that you can always be who you are and it is easy to find acceptance in a community of like minded people . &quot;
I even wrote a very sham@@ anic love letter about his size .
then Donald Tru@@ mp came .
much has been written about x@@ en@@ opho@@ bia and rac@@ ism of this man .
the most extraordinary aspect of his as@@ cen@@ sion is for me as he walks with his narrow @-@ min@@ de@@ dness .
he never thinks behind the mountain as you say so beautiful .
&quot; he tells exactly what he thinks of how a former colleague expressed it , and openly declares his cont@@ emp@@ t for Muslims , Lat@@ inos , Af@@ ro@@ americ@@ ans and women . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , people responded to his statements and tuned in pairs for him . &quot;
the 13 million votes he won in the republi@@ can elections was the highest number ever reached by the Party nomin@@ ee nomin@@ ee .
I was spe@@ ech@@ less .
&quot; who are the Americans who support this big@@ ot person , I asked myself ? &quot;
I could not bring Tru@@ mp and his vot@@ ers to tune with the people that I met during my time in Phoenix .
&quot; as for example , my professor , Dr. Bill Sil@@ cock , director of the journ@@ alistic program that takes people from all over the world , a deep beli@@ ever , with whom I could talk about Islam and his past . &quot;
&quot; also , Tru@@ mps &apos;s Welt@@ anschau@@ ung did not correspond with the current publisher of the &quot; C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati In@@ qu@@ ir@@ er . &quot; &quot;
Bh@@ ati@@ a and I met with our common love for basketball and we spent many hours watching the &quot; Phoenix Suns . &quot;
&quot; Tru@@ mps intoler@@ ance is also in contrast to gener@@ osity that I experienced at Sand@@ y B@@ ahr who fought the environment for their lives , and their husband Dave , my host family , who treated me like their son . &quot;
&quot; she still fits to the commitment of Krist@@ i Kapp@@ es , who always helped me with a lot of patience and grace to me and my colleagues to get used to the complexity of the American life . &quot;
&quot; then there were Andrew Leck@@ ey , Kath@@ r@@ yn Mc@@ Man@@ us and Re@@ tha Hill , my ment@@ ors , whose wise advice helped me a lot in my career . &quot;
these people and the values em@@ bodied by them deep@@ ened my love of America .
&quot; while Tru@@ mp failed his way to the nominal republi@@ can presidential candidate , they gave me a stop and the counter@@ part to his limited vision of America . &quot;
&quot; however , it turned out that they were the exception of the rule . &quot;
&quot; on November 8 , 2016 more than 50 million Americans , mostly white , the pres@@ idency of a man , despite - or perhaps because of his cont@@ emp@@ t against non @-@ white people . &quot;
&quot; the debate with the idea that people have voted for Tru@@ mp because they either shared their rac@@ ism and fan@@ ati@@ cism , or because they were willing to over@@ look these things , almost broke my heart . &quot;
perhaps it is un@@ fair to call the Tru@@ mp vot@@ ers as Ras@@ si@@ sten .
&quot; to classi@@ fy people , said one of my friends , is exactly what led us to this situation . &quot;
this is super@@ ficial and resp@@ ect@@ ful and indicates an in@@ ability to understand those who act in another way and think .
it shows people that their wor@@ ries and fears are not taken into account of the hec@@ tic changes in their communities .
&quot; could it be that these vot@@ ers , most of whom are white , voted for Tru@@ mp because they want to reg@@ ain control of a country that she has disappointed ? &quot;
&quot; in other words , they might say they are still important in this America ? &quot;
maybe .
&quot; however , one can hardly forget the words of David Rem@@ nick , who comments the cruel decision to raise a man who looks down with cont@@ emp@@ t to those who look different than he . &quot;
&quot; this &quot; &quot; Whit@@ el@@ ash &quot; &quot; ( note ) : as much as &quot; &quot; rebel@@ lion of the wh@@ ites against all other eth@@ ni@@ cities &quot; ; &quot; word play from white in all@@ usion to the Wh@@ ites and whi@@ pl@@ ash , as called the great Van Jones , has killed exactly what America did so great . &quot;
&quot; millions of people around the world appreciate the American ideal - regardless of whether myth or reality , it is nevertheless a powerful idea - what faith or background you may have , America welcomes everyone . &quot;
&quot; for this land chose as its President , twice the son of a Ken@@ yan , whose story he himself says , nowhere else in the world would be possible . &quot;
&quot; however , with the choice of Donald Tru@@ mps , there is a huge part of the white Americas on this promise and says : to Hell with diversity , freedom of religion and the whole concept of pl@@ ur@@ alism . &quot;
&quot; in America after 9 / 11 , the white man is back at the helm , they say . &quot;
&quot; in all this I have to think of K@@ hi@@ z@@ r Khan , the father of a soldier who is in Iraq , and what he said on the eve of election . &quot;
&quot; on a demonstration for Hill@@ ary Clinton , Mr. Khan had a change of word with the crowd . &quot;
&quot; Donald Tru@@ mp , would have my son , captain Hu@@ may@@ un K@@ ahn , a place in your America ? &quot; asked Mr. Khan . &quot;
the crowd answered with a loud &quot; No ! &quot;
&quot; would Muslims have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; &quot; ro@@ ared the crowd . &quot;
&quot; do Lat@@ inos have a place in your Americas ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; &quot; they said . &quot;
do A@@ fr@@ o Americans have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; they cried , and their voices became lou@@ der . &quot;
&quot; if anyone , who is not like you , a place in your America ? &quot;
he received a unanim@@ ous and loud &quot; NO &quot; !
&quot; Mr. Khan concluded with the words : &quot; thank God , Mr. Tru@@ mp , is that not your America . &quot; 36 hours later he was corrected . &quot;
&quot; the land for whom his son had fallen , sent him a message . &quot;
&quot; that is now Tru@@ mps country , the message said . &quot;
&quot; and all the people that look like Mr. Khan , could find no place in this new America . &quot;
and that breaks my heart .

from the mis@@ ery of the stars : these Latin American children cannot spoil their love for music by rub@@ b@@ ish

what is the Mexican music school of the Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero community in the province of O@@ ax@@ aca together with the children of the par@@ agu@@ an city Cat@@ eur@@ a ?
&quot; the music , which is played in both places , not only changed the life of the children , but also a very close connection with ... &quot;
music that lives with the waste
&quot; Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero is located on the edge of a large g@@ arb@@ age dump , only 16 Kilomet@@ ers south of O@@ ax@@ aca &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; an old colonial town , which is very popular among tourists - but worlds away from the nearby pre@@ Colum@@ bian ruins and its world @-@ famous kitchen . &quot;
&quot; for several years now , the La b@@ anda de M@@ ú@@ sica ( music ban@@ de ) has been playing in the congregation : a symph@@ ony orchestra consisting of children and adults , which has a possibility to overcome the surrounding poverty with their musical instruments . &quot;
a music school with 100 students has become a central interest in the municipality of Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero in O@@ ax@@ aca .
the UK newspaper The Guardian wrote about this project :
&quot; the community , located in one of the poor@@ est provinces of Mexico , is known for its drug abuse and gangs of violence . &quot;
but this changed after a random encounter with a French pilot who started a musical project and offered young people a rare g@@ limmer of hope .
&quot; the young band members take their commitments to the music group seriously , writes the local press Not@@ ici@@ as O@@ ax@@ aca N@@ VI : &quot;
&quot; once they come from school , they run back home and immediately after lunch they run through the du@@ sty streets to pursue their great passion . &quot;
&quot; they are always laugh@@ ing and with shiny eyes and play in the bu@@ stle you learn day for day trumpet , tro@@ mb@@ one , pic@@ colo , clarinet , obo@@ e , flute , wood@@ horn , tim@@ pan@@ i , b@@ ong@@ os and the Con@@ ga . &quot;
music from g@@ arb@@ age
&quot; more than 7,@@ 000 kilometres south of Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero , the children of Cat@@ eur@@ a - a village that is practically located at the largest waste dump of As@@ unci@@ ón in Paraguay &apos;s capital - on instruments made of recycled waste material : &quot;
&quot; music with re@@ treated instruments that consist of local solid waste materials , made in a workshop for musical instruments in Cat@@ eur@@ a , where the recycl@@ er began to turn parts of the waste into instruments under the direction of F@@ avi@@ o Ch@@ á@@ vez . &quot;
&quot; instruments im@@ itate viol@@ ins , viola , cel@@ los , double b@@ asses , guitars , fl@@ utes , sax@@ oph@@ ones , trump@@ ets , tro@@ mb@@ ones and percussion , all produced from the tr@@ ash . &quot;
&quot; the repertoire includes classical music , folk music , par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an and Latin American music as well as music of the Beat@@ les , by Frank Sin@@ atra , etc . &quot;
&quot; in an article in the Los Angeles Times F@@ avi@@ o Ch@@ á@@ vez , a local ec@@ ologist and musician of the children of Cat@@ eur@@ a , rec@@ alls the early days : &quot;
first it was very difficult because we had no place for rehear@@ sals and we had to teach at the same place where the parents did not know music and it was very difficult to contact parents because many of them do not live with their children .
this changed as F@@ avi@@ o something he had never seen before : a violin produced from waste .
&quot; today there is a whole orchestra , which plays on instruments from re@@ treated material and called The Recycl@@ ed Orchestra . &quot;
a documentary called &quot; Land@@ fill Harmon@@ ic &quot; ( Harmon@@ ic Müll@@ de@@ pon@@ y ) draws the musical performance to :
the world generates about one billion tons of g@@ arb@@ age every year .
&quot; those who live with him and of him are the poor@@ est - like the people of Cat@@ eur@@ a , Paraguay . &quot;
and here they turn it into something beautiful .
Land@@ fill Harmon@@ ic follows the orchestra with his inspir@@ ational drama from g@@ arb@@ age music around the world .
the orchestra even played his music before Pope Francis :
these Eastern African countries demonstrate how technology and team@@ work can successfully fight illegal fishing
photo © F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa - a project that comb@@ ats wild illegal fishing .
&quot; this post , written by Emma Br@@ yce , was originally published by En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that specifically reports about international , practi@@ sed solutions for environmental problems . &quot;
the re@@ publication occurs within the framework of an agreement with Global Vo@@ ices for sharing content .
&quot; in West Africa , it was known that this ship had already practi@@ sed illegal fishing in the Liby@@ an waters before it visited the other coast of Africa . &quot;
the East African countries were up@@ set accordingly and little inclined to welcome a criminal off@@ ense of this kind at their coasts .
&quot; Kenya , Tanzania , Mauritius , the Com@@ or@@ os , Moz@@ ambi@@ que and the Seych@@ elles quickly mobili@@ zed against the ship . they refused to enter one of their har@@ bours and refused to give him a fish@@ eries property . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; suddenly the prime minister was surrounded by countries that you simply denied all &quot; , &quot; Bene@@ dict Ki@@ il@@ u , an executive of the Ken@@ yan fishing authority , is a part of a team that discovered and persec@@ uted the ship at that time . &quot;
&quot; in 2013 , the ship was driven out of the waters of the region : it was not able to catch fish there . &quot;
&quot; ultimately , it was forced to pay $ 2 million to Liberia , because of lo@@ oting the country &apos;s fish stocks . &quot;
&quot; the core of this initiative , which crosses criminal practices and protects resources , was F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa : a network of countries , 2012 from the NGO Stop Il@@ legal Fishing ( halt Il@@ legal fishing ) . &quot;
&quot; alongside Somalia and Madagascar , the members of this network are the six countries which then had driven the prime minister out of their waters . &quot;
&quot; this project offers F@@ ISH @-@ i technical support to F@@ ew Char@@ itable Tru@@ sts Project En@@ ding Il@@ legal Fishing . this project offers F@@ ISH @-@ i technical support .
illegal fishing is un@@ regulated by definition : what is caught will be conce@@ aled from which it is extremely difficult to detect . therefore illegal fishing is a major cause of over@@ fishing by regions .
&quot; by deliber@@ ate dis@@ regard of existing laws , by which certain habit@@ ats and species are to be protected , the illegal fishing ecos@@ ystems can harm ecos@@ ystems that have a delicate equilibrium . &quot;
&quot; but during actions against illegal fishing once been hin@@ dered by bureaucr@@ atic hur@@ d@@ les and also by the sn@@ ail emp@@ o , with the information between individual countries , the actions happen in real @-@ time , with trac@@ eable to F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s digital communication platform . &quot;
&quot; for example , the individual countries can exchange lists of existing licenses , news on suspic@@ ious activities or details that one notices or experienced during a harbour inspection . &quot;
&quot; fish @-@ i tracks the activities of ships also very attentive when they move on the open sea , by means of satellite data . &quot;
&quot; this enables the authorities to mark ships that fish in forbidden areas - such as such , which indicate that a ship will load its caught fish on the way to other ships . &quot;
&quot; ideally , such studies show whether the participating ships have a fishing license , where they were on the way and possibly , if they have a criminal law . &quot;
&quot; countries that are against illegal fishing can then refuse to accept such vessels in their ports . what means that ships cannot sell their cargo , and that they can even be forced to pay pun@@ ishments , as in the case of prime minister . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s about considerable financial losses for the owner , which means that illegal fishing is no longer worthwhile . &quot;
&quot; this is what we want to achieve , &quot; &quot; says Per Erik Ber@@ gh , director of n@@ f@@ ds Africa . the latter is a consultant company committed to the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also supported F@@ ISH @-@ i . &quot;
a closed front
&quot; the already mentioned platform was created to reg@@ ain about 20 million USD of lost revenue , which will lose the eight members of the H@@ ISH @-@ i network each year because of illegal fishing that penet@@ rates into East African waters . &quot;
East Africa has one of the most productive t@@ una fish@@ eries since the region attracts commercial fishing from all over the world . among these also un@@ even illegal fishermen .
&quot; other activities include sailing under false flag , f@@ ake license papers , st@@ ating fan@@ ta@@ sies , fish @-@ protected species and fish in nature reserves . &quot;
&quot; &quot; they specifically use the lack of international cooperation and make use of the weaknesses of a non @-@ complete organized control system , &quot; &quot; says Long . &quot; &quot; previously a ship could fish illeg@@ ally and a country could then say &quot; You &apos;re not going to run my port . &quot; &quot;
&quot; yet another country could say &apos; Come to Me &apos; . &quot; &quot; and this legal lo@@ op@@ hole tries to close F@@ ISH @-@ i now . &quot;
&quot; until now , the closed front functions . &quot;
&quot; since its inc@@ eption , F@@ ISH @-@ i was involved in more than 30 studies of suspic@@ ious ships . &quot;
it has revealed criminal networks that had spread f@@ ake licenses in Tanzania . it discovered ships that used several frau@@ dul@@ ent identi@@ ties and it has persec@@ uted and found wing@@ ed ships .
&quot; due to its collaboration with INTER@@ PO@@ L , the international authority to fight crimes , F@@ ISH @-@ i can share information on illegal fishing over long distances . &quot;
&quot; &quot; some of our investigations lead us quite far into the networks of organized crime , &quot; says Ber@@ gh . &quot;
it builds a system that will help F@@ ISH @-@ i to detect suspected ships more precisely .

&quot; fish @-@ i &apos;s satellite system , which will always be further developed , helps protect the illegal ships that would like to hide . &quot;
&quot; &quot; the illegal fishermen use very sophisticated techniques to hide their activities and their position . and we try to cross , &quot; &quot; says Dun@@ can Cop@@ eland , Chief Analy@@ st at Tr@@ y@@ g@@ g Mat Tracking , a NGO which also deals with fish@@ eries data and F@@ ISH @-@ i technical support . &quot;
&quot; some of the ships , for example , turn off their automatic identification systems , which they cannot be loc@@ alized by satellites . &quot;
Cop@@ eland therefore helps to build a system that connects different levels of information together . it should help F@@ ISH @-@ i to find crimin@@ ally acting vessels with greater precision .
a model program
but F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s team of African nations can actually influence the undoubtedly global problem of illegal fishing ?
&quot; John A@@ mos , President of the NGO &apos;s Sky@@ truth , believes that . &quot;
&quot; recently , Sky@@ Truth has opened the Global Fishing Watch platform together with Google and the Maritime Organization Oc@@ e@@ ana : a platform that offers satellite data and can be displayed anywhere in the world by means of the position of every single track@@ able ship . &quot;
&quot; &quot; join together with the neighbours to get a better picture of who is doing - that simply makes sense , &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; here &apos;s a chance for countries to unite and bund@@ le their resources . &quot;
&quot; we should do this on a global scale . &quot; &quot; P@@ ew Char@@ itable Tru@@ sts has a similar project to run where a global system permits the persecution of ships . &quot;
&quot; there are signs that F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s activities not only detect crimin@@ als , but also frigh@@ ten them . &quot;
ships that previously f@@ ished without a license and hardly had to reck@@ on with consequences know that they are observed .
&quot; according to Ki@@ il@@ u , some of the countries participating in F@@ ISH @-@ i have now reached a 33 % increase in fishing turnover , since fishing boats have more lic@@ ences . &quot;
&quot; after F@@ ISH @-@ i Somalia had helped to spy Gre@@ ko 1 , the inspec@@ tors found tow@@ ing nets on board whose use is prohibited . &quot;
photo courtesy of F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa .
&quot; other countries also notice these successes . &quot; &quot; the effect is so strong that we now also copy other countries , &quot; &quot; says Ki@@ il@@ u . &quot; &quot; we are a study object . &quot; &quot; in West Africa several hundred million dollars disappear every year through illegal fishing . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 , six countries joined together , to the so @-@ called West Africa Task Force . they are now fighting illegal fishing , according to the same model as F@@ ISH @-@ i@@ . &quot; &quot; with certainty the goal is to make even more such initiatives and structures in other regions too , &quot; &quot; says Cop@@ eland . &quot;
&quot; recently F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s youngest member country Somalia was able to report its first big triumph : in October , Gre@@ ko 1 , a ship , who was on the road under false flag . and not only the ship was on the road without a license and were used as tow@@ ing nets , which are now prohibited . &quot;
&quot; the ship was also entered into forbidden waters , which were reserved for fishermen from Somalia . &quot; &quot; with the behaviour of measures against Gre@@ ko 1 , they set a strong sign that they proceed against illegal fishing , &quot; &quot; says Ber@@ gh . &quot;
&quot; for F@@ ISH @-@ i , this is another success of many . and at the same time proof that such a special , collaborative approach to protect the oceans actually works across the world . Emma Br@@ yce is freel@@ ance journalist and lives in London . &quot;

road movements in Venezuela seem to be just the beginning of a wave of violent demonstrations .
they are considered a protest against the government &apos;s decision to stop the referendum on the revival of President Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro .

&quot; after the government of Venezuela had rejected the motion of the opposition to a referendum on a referendum , the Venezu@@ el@@ ans responded to the negotiations on the political and economic crisis of the country into emp@@ tin@@ ess by congreg@@ ating on the streets . &quot;
&quot; under the h@@ ash@@ tag # La@@ Tom@@ a@@ De@@ Venezuela ( e.g. , the return order of Venezuela ) can be found both pictures of these demonstrations and arguments for and against them . &quot;
&quot; the debate will also be held in other parts of the country - among other things in the low@@ land region of Bar@@ inas , in the Andes regions of Mé@@ ri@@ da and T@@ á@@ ch@@ ira , in the central north of the Bundestag Car@@ ab@@ ob@@ o and on Isla Margar@@ ita in the Federal State of Nu@@ eva E@@ spart@@ a . &quot;
the political and economic situation of the country is wor@@ sen@@ ing continuously what makes itself noticeable in the daily life of the Vene@@ tians by an acute lack of food and medicines .
&quot; many representatives of the opposition saw the revival of the current president Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro a chance for a fundamental change , but ultimately the holding of a new election was blocked by the official authorities . &quot;
&quot; Mari@@ anne D@@ í@@ az , contribut@@ or at Global Vo@@ ices in Venezuela , summar@@ ises the context of the government decision as follows : &quot;
&quot; in the context of the social , political and economic crisis , in which the inflation and power rates are among the highest in the world ( the inflation rate is estimated at 500 % to the end of the year ) and in which a serious and far @-@ reaching lack of food and medicine , the referendum was regarded as the only way to reg@@ ain its institutional structures and to close a new government alliance . &quot;
&quot; the elec@@ toral alliance Mes@@ a de la Uni@@ dad Democr@@ á@@ tica or shortly MU@@ D ( about : round table of the Democratic Unit ) , in which the opposition parties and political groups were joined together , the demonstr@@ ators planned to continue to support the National Assembly , and a march to the Mi@@ ra@@ fl@@ ores Palace , the Venezu@@ el@@ an Government , planned on 3 November , should continue to pers@@ ist the referendum of the referendum . &quot;
the call was commented on Twitter as follows :
&quot; it is so far Venezuela : tomorrow National Assembly , Friday country @-@ wide civil strike and on November 3 all went to Car@@ ac@@ as to Mi@@ ra@@ fl@@ ores Palace . &quot;

&quot; the Re@@ conquest of Venezuela &quot;
&quot; the first demonstration in the framework of the Action Plan &quot; &quot; The Re@@ duction of Venezuela &quot; &quot; took place on Wednesday , October 26 . &quot;
&quot; the pictures of the mart@@ yrs who are published in real time testify among other things an overwhelming participation of people in numerous areas of the country , but also disputes with polic@@ emen as well as advoc@@ ates of the government . &quot;
one of the most common images shows a demonstr@@ ator calling through the shield : &quot; will you kill me because I am hungry ?
&quot; will you kill me , because I have hunger ? &quot; &quot; from this Vene@@ z@@ ol@@ an . &quot;
&quot; it is enough , without sh@@ it . &quot;

&quot; on Twitter there are images that relate to con@@ front@@ ations , as well as reports of repression and mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment . &quot;
especially large waves beat the news about police repression in the centrally located town of Mar@@ ac@@ ay .
the demonstr@@ ators went back to the local cathedral to protect themselves according to their own statement before the police and armed supporters of the government .
&quot; hours later they were able to leave the cathedral safely , but the protests continued . &quot;
&quot; in other parts of the country , some prot@@ esters tried to stop the police forces , including this woman in the An@@ den@@ state of T@@ á@@ ch@@ ira : &quot;
&quot; the women in T@@ á@@ ch@@ ira do not carry sk@@ irts , because otherwise one could see something that many national gar@@ ages don &apos;t have ! &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , an info@@ graphic already makes the round that forms the amount of repression a day : &quot;
thus the dictatorship has supp@@ ressed the country .
many representatives of the government ques@@ tioned the validity of the demand for a district court proceedings - it has now been proven in the eyes of many people by the presence of inn@@ umer@@ able people .
My@@ t@@ eks Media Labs for this :
Nicol@@ ás and Di@@ os@@ dado claim that 1 % of sig@@ natures are fal@@ si@@ fied .
here is your removal !
on the road !
&quot; others consider these protests as a further step in the fight against a government , which has taken a little effort against the devast@@ ating economic crisis and preferred to c@@ log critical voices : &quot;
you have taken us so much - but also the fear !
the mar@@ ches are increasing more and more in frequency and intensity .
&quot; some Venezu@@ el@@ ans reported the media , they were too hungry to participate in a strike instead of working or shopping . &quot;

&quot; this is an adapted version of an interview given by Ale@@ jo G@@ ó@@ me@@ z with Luis Qui@@ j@@ ano , which was published on 23 August 2016 on D@@ ía a D@@ ía , an Argent@@ ine@@ an news page . &quot;
the interview was translated into English and is published here with friendly permission .
&quot; when he was 15 years old , Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was forced by his father to watch the atro@@ cities in La Per@@ la , a secret prison in the Argent@@ inian city of Cór@@ doba . &quot;
&quot; as an meanwhile adult man , Qui@@ j@@ ano , now in the part of the great La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ bera process , said in the province of Cór@@ doba , against his father . &quot;
&quot; the trial concluded on 24 August 2016 , were examined crimes committed during the Argent@@ ine@@ an military dictatorship . &quot;
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano has not chosen his life .
&quot; starting with the burden of wearing the same name as his father , to the brutal military operations in the prison La Per@@ la , which he observed at the age of 15 , he suffered enough . &quot;
for 34 years he kept the family secret for himself .
&quot; in the situation at that time , I believed that was fine . &quot;
I felt like a secret .
&quot; as a child with 15 years , one does not notice that one is manipul@@ ated by his father . &quot;
&quot; at that time I could not recognize that my father was a th@@ ief , torture and mur@@ derer . &quot;
&quot; Luis had no choice : his father Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was G@@ end@@ arm@@ eri@@ e@@ Offic@@ ers . during the Argent@@ ine@@ an military dictatorship from 1974 to 1983 , a period of state terrorism , his father was dep@@ uty commander of the Secret Service Department 141 in prison La Per@@ la . &quot;

Archives .
&quot; but this is not the story of Luis Qui@@ j@@ ano , the op@@ pressor , who was charged with kid@@ n@@ apping in 158 cases , torture , murder in almost 100 cases and the kid@@ n@@ apping of a 10 @-@ year @-@ old child . &quot;
&quot; no , this is the story of Luis Qui@@ jan@@ os son , a man who , over the years , recognised the extent of atro@@ cities he had witnessed as a boy , and who said before a federal court against his own father . &quot;
his story shows what great power has a parent over his child and how this child chose a way of salvation .
from the sports hall to the military base
&quot; when my father began to take me to the military base , I often went to the sports hall . there I had friends with a boy who made mar@@ tial arts . &quot;
everyone named him &quot; K@@ ent . &quot;
I told my father of him and a few days later he showed me a black @-@ and @-@ white photo and called me to identify my friend on it .

&quot; you are a as@@ sh@@ ole , you have found yourself with one of the ERP friends . &quot;

&quot; that &apos;s why he for@@ bid me to go back to the sports hall again . some days later , he took me to work on the military base . &quot;
&quot; he told me , I would become a secret . &quot;
I was 15 years old and in the situation I thought that would be fine .
&quot; on the military base , I had to destroy papers that had heard the prisoners . &quot;
&quot; these were all possible documents : university degrees , hand@@ written notes , literature , certificates , propaganda material , books , just everything . &quot;

&apos;@@ Then the prisoners are tor@@ tured &apos;
my father took me a total of four times to La Per@@ la - all in 1976 .
at the first and last time he left me at the entrance in the car .
&quot; when he took me the second time he ordered me to get out . he led me to a bar@@ racks , in the cars , furniture , television , fri@@ dges - just everything possible - stood . &quot;
everything was stolen .
&quot; he gave me a little bag wrapped in a blan@@ ket , and ordered me to wear it to the car . when I opened it , I saw that there was a great deal of silver in it . &quot;
&quot; this day I went to the other end of the bar@@ racks , where the stolen items were shut down and kept me with a guard . &quot;
suddenly he pointed to an open space and said :
the prisoners are tor@@ tured .
&quot; and I saw in it , and saw a couch in which men were tor@@ tured . &quot;
she looked like a field bed and metal springs .
&quot; later , I found out that they attached the end of a cable . the other end was fast@@ ened to the person &apos;s body , which was just tied up there . &quot;
&quot; they scar@@ c@@ ely hold a man with hand@@ cu@@ ffs to the bed , poured it with water and ch@@ ased him a charge of 220 volts into the gen@@ itals . &quot;

the st@@ ench there was horri@@ ble ... like a dirty wind .
&quot; years later , when my father was under house arrest , the same smell came out of his room . &quot;
I realized the smell immediately and I realized that the smell of a body is in need .
I could never forget this smell .
and I asked myself : how is it possible that a person can do so much suffering from another ?
I knew that these people were killed
&quot; when my father took me to work for the third time , he led me to the entrance of La Cu@@ ad@@ ra - the area where the prisoners were captiv@@ ated with hand@@ cu@@ ffs and were carrying eye band@@ ages . &quot;
&quot; he spoke with &quot; Ch@@ u@@ bi &quot; Lop@@ ez ( Jose L@@ ó@@ pez , a civilian who was also indic@@ ted in the trial ) and I took the opportunity to take a look at La Cu@@ ad@@ ra . &quot;
&quot; in the background , I saw a series of matt@@ resses on which naked men lay down with the face down - all were captiv@@ ated by hands and feet . &quot;
&quot; near the entrance , people kept quiet on the matt@@ resses . &quot;
&quot; when my father noticed that I saw the prisoners , he said , &quot; &quot; What do you do so , as@@ sh@@ ole ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; why did you come to me ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
I knew that these people were killed .
they were thrown into a pit and were killed and buried by soldiers .
I know that because my father told me about it .
&quot; in addition to La Cu@@ ad@@ ra , some rooms were designated as offices . &quot;
I know that &quot; Pal@@ ito &quot; Rom@@ ero beat a man there and killed a man .
&quot; ( according to the survi@@ vors of the civil war Jor@@ ge Rom@@ ero , who was also indic@@ ted in La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ bera , was accused of death by the students Ra@@ ú@@ l Mat@@ eo Mol@@ ina . &quot;
&quot; the following video shows Emi@@ lio Fes@@ sia , the leader of the La Per@@ la Memorial , through the former torture chambers . &quot;
the way you came in here is also the way on which the kid@@ n@@ apping came here .
&quot; if you look on the map , you see that they took about this way and then were tor@@ tured for the first time . &quot;
here their names were changed and they were assigned a number as part of the process of de@@ human@@ ization .
&quot; when they survived torture , the prisoners were thrown into the cu@@ ad@@ ra until the arrangement from above came that they should be laid . &quot;
this was the lie - eu@@ ph@@ em@@ ism - for the shooting of men and the dis@@ appearance of their bodies in most cases .
the &apos; Dest@@ iny &apos;
my father brought all sorts of stolen things home .
&quot; back then at the age I had no idea what the &quot; &quot; war &quot; &quot; - as they knew - was . &quot;
&quot; but when I was at the military later , I was in the g@@ end@@ ar@@ mer@@ ie - it became clear to me that war yield is a bay@@ on@@ et or perhaps military sign that one strikes an enemy that one fought against . &quot;

&quot; but if one goes into a house and the refrigerator , the turn@@ table , clothes , paintings , money ... ste@@ als , then this is not war @-@ prey but v@@ and@@ alism . &quot;
this is theft .
&quot; I have always wonder@@ ed how my father , the chief of the security forces , could join this v@@ and@@ alism . &quot;
I just don &apos;t understand it .
I was also an officer at the G@@ end@@ ar@@ mer@@ ie and I would never like to enter a house and ste@@ al everything in it .
I don &apos;t understand how my father could do that .
&quot; once he called me a criminal , and I rep@@ lied , &quot; &quot; And you , who ste@@ ered cars on the road ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
you are not a criminal ?
&quot; he explo@@ ded against anger , struck me and cried : &quot;
&quot; if you go so far , then I will find you and kill you . &quot;
&quot; for this , we don &apos;t need anyone else ! &quot;
so my father was .
I don &apos;t have a single good memory of him .
&quot; when I said in the process , I showed a photo of back then , on which I wore a jacket and a Roll@@ kr@@ agen@@ pul@@ lover made of wool . both had my father from La Per@@ la . &quot;
&quot; we were not poor , but he still brought clothes to home . &quot;
&quot; at that time , the defence accused me of being a conspir@@ at@@ orial with this crime . I said , no problem , they can put me to load what they wanted . &quot;
I was there anyway to cancel .
&apos;@@ The dis@@ appearance of the dead is the last abom@@ in@@ able act &apos;
&quot; now , where I am older , I feel regre@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; when one has children first , one recognizes the value of a life . &quot;
one develops further and realis@@ es that it is false to kill .
I even went so far to say :
&quot; well , so you did execute people during the dictatorship . but why did the cor@@ p@@ ses leave ? &quot;
why children kid@@ n@@ apped ?
&quot; one day my father brought a girl home , whose mother was killed . &quot;
&quot; she was like our pet , almost like a dog - only that this was a little girl . &quot;
&quot; I always asked the question : they were tor@@ tured , but why were they killed ? &quot;
they could just have put them in j@@ ail .
&quot; I guess it was simply decided to kill these people , but why did their bodies disappear ? &quot;
did these people do not have families to be handed over to their mort@@ al remains ?
the dis@@ appearance of the dead is the last abom@@ in@@ able act that one can do to a man .
&quot; my father told me when democracy was re@@ introduced , they took machines to eliminate the mort@@ al remn@@ ants of the prisoners . &quot;
&quot; they were crus@@ hed and somewhere dispos@@ ed of - no idea where . &quot; &quot; one will never find anything , &quot; &quot; said my father . &quot;
but something remains of course always .
I have seen how you killed people !
just to make it clear : I have nothing against the military .
I was even at the G@@ end@@ ar@@ mer@@ ie .
I just told the truth about 20 crimin@@ als - including my father .
&quot; the thought of showing my father arose during a conversation , when he was under house arrest . &quot;
I made him accus@@ ations about all the atro@@ cities I had to experience for him .
&quot; then he said suddenly : &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know . I didn &apos;t kill anyone . &quot;
&quot; I felt in@@ war@@ dly abandoned and asked myself why the whole exagger@@ ated patri@@ ot@@ ism and the &quot; Western and Christian feelings , &quot; which they allegedly def@@ ended were actually good . &quot;
then I cried :
how can you tell me something about me ?
I have seen how you killed people !
you have committed terrible crimes and you have forced me as a child to participate .
&quot; he only said , &quot; &quot; Well , show me . &quot; &quot; &quot;
that &apos;s what I did .
&quot; in 2010 , I paid the first advertisement . &quot;
I finally realized that he was a criminal .
no one can repro@@ ach me that I am pre@@ occupied . I finally said against my own father .

a translation error makes elderly people in Kyoto zu &quot; terrible car drivers &quot;
the sign with the translation error in a Kyoto centre in which one can pro@@ long his driver &apos;s license .
the photo was spread in the social media .
edited by Joshua Lev@@ ine .
&quot; in the Kyoto Japanese city , customers of a newly opened centre in which one can pro@@ long their driving license last month , witnessed a very un@@ successful translation . &quot;
&quot; on a shield , the Japanese word was &quot; &quot; older drivers &quot; , &quot; the &quot; &quot; el@@ der car driver &quot; &quot; means , but perhaps also with bad background thoughts &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; as &quot; &quot; terri@@ bly motor@@ ists &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the wrong translation was to read on electronic displays at the entrance area and in the building itself from 1 to 20 September .
&quot; adaptation of the original photos by Joshua Lev@@ ine , which has been widely shared in the social media . &quot;
&quot; the mistake was noticed by the translator Julian Hol@@ mes , a inhabit@@ ant of Ky@@ ot@@ os . he was also aware of the local newspapers . &quot;
the daily newspaper Kyoto Shim@@ bu@@ n wrote in Kyoto :
&quot; &quot; &quot; how could there be such an English translation ? &quot;
this proves that no one has read the translation correction .
&quot; this is an ins@@ ult to elderly people and in an international city like Kyoto is simply un@@ acceptable , &quot; &quot; said Hol@@ mes . &quot;
&quot; the faul@@ ty English translation was first removed . the term &quot; &quot; terrible drivers &quot; &quot; was replaced later by the appropriate , although gram@@ mati@@ cally not quite correct term &quot; el@@ der drivers &quot; ( German : &quot; older drivers &quot; ) . &quot;
&quot; the Kyoto Pre@@ f@@ ecture has ap@@ olog@@ ated for translation errors . furthermore , she explained that the error was already contained in the text they had received from the translator and that the translation was not checked for its accuracy before it was published . &quot;
a blo@@ gger reported about the exc@@ use :
&quot; we are sorry that older people felt insul@@ ted by the in@@ adequate correction ( the translation ) , &quot; &quot; said the police . &quot;
&quot; the Japanese online news service J @-@ Cast News was a bit more detailed with the phenomenon of &quot; &quot; terrible &quot; &quot; older drivers in Japan and wrote : &quot;
&quot; the word &quot; terrible &quot; was den@@ o@@ unced as an in@@ appropriate description of older drivers . according to the police , the proportion of older drivers , who are involved nation@@ wide in accidents , is quite a cause for concern . &quot;
&quot; in the Kyoto pre@@ f@@ ecture , for example , 1,9@@ 41 of 19.@@ 460 accidents were caused by sen@@ iors in 2005 . this corresponds to a share of 10 % . &quot;
&quot; ten years later , in 2014 , sen@@ iors 1.8@@ 03 from a total of 11,@@ 850 accidents . &quot;
this increased their share to 17.@@ 7 % .
&quot; while the number of accidents decreased overall , the proportion of accidents caused by sen@@ iors increased in the same period . &quot;
the name not named repor@@ ter brought comments to the light published in the Yahoo version of the article showing what pre@@ judi@@ ces are some Japanese apparently against older drivers :
&quot; the article on Yahoo for translation errors , among other things , received the following comments : &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; is this ( &quot; &quot; terrible driver &quot; &quot; ) about not reality ? &quot;
&quot; - &quot; &quot; So flaw@@ ed is the translation actually not , isn &apos;t it ? &quot;
- &quot; I don &apos;t find that this is a true translation error . &quot;
there are not a few such comments .

the reasons for the wide distribution of translation errors are manifold .
&quot; for transl@@ ating , you need two important skills : passive language skills in order to understand the source text and active language skills in order to transfer him to the target language . &quot;
the latter requires the active domination of the target language - something that is the case with native speakers . in general the conviction that trans@@ lators should be in the target language - not in the native language - native speakers .
&quot; for example , a French native speaker should translate from English into French - not from French to English . &quot;
photo of Fli@@ ck@@ r user Karl Baron .
&quot; many Japanese companies don &apos;t employ people with English as mother tongue , who could produce translations into English . this may be due to the lack of understanding for transl@@ ating , cost reasons or the relatively small number of English native speakers who learn Japanese . &quot;
&quot; some companies , who don &apos;t have foreign employees , nevertheless make translations to the company . then the Japanese employee , whose English skills are valued as the best , become trans@@ lators - no matter how good or bad his language skills are really . &quot;
photo of Fli@@ ck@@ r user Karl Baron .
machine translations are also widely used - often with funny results .
&quot; the confused and pu@@ zz@@ ling sentences , which arise by machine translation , show that this technique can &apos;t replace a human translator for a long time . this applies to some languages very special . &quot;
&quot; some of the most strange English phrases in Japan , including the mysterious prints , which often decor@@ ate t @-@ shirts or bags , are used only for styl@@ istic reasons - not to be read or even understood . &quot;
photo by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Joseph Br@@ ent .
translation errors may be acceptable or at least harmless . but by large companies or by the government that have the means to ensure higher standards you can expect more careful translations .
&quot; in the future , the city of Kyoto will hopefully use a more serious source for their translations . &quot;
Venezuela : taking protests and cens@@ or@@ ship on the internet and television
&quot; main page of the &quot; &quot; Nav@@ egar con Liber@@ t@@ ad &quot; &quot; ( Frei@@ es Sur@@ fing ) of the IP@@ YS ( Institu@@ to Pr@@ ens@@ a y Soci@@ ed@@ ad , Institute for Press and Society ) . &quot;
&quot; on Friday morning , 7 April , Venezu@@ el@@ an Internet users reported that they had no access to Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay online channel . &quot;
&quot; later , other users wrote that the Internet appearances of V@@ P@@ IT@@ V and El Capit@@ oli@@ o TV were no longer accessible . &quot;
&quot; other online channels also transm@@ its recordings of the protests in Car@@ ac@@ as , which were organized by op@@ posi@@ tional groups , who oppose the government Nicol@@ ás Ma@@ du@@ ros . &quot;
&quot; the protests started at the beginning of April , after the Supreme Court dissolved the parliament and transferred the Parliament &apos;s duties to the executive and the Supreme Court itself . &quot;
&quot; Luis Carlos D@@ í@@ az , journalist and author at Global Vo@@ ices , published the results of a Trac@@ er@@ ou@@ tes . he pointed out that the connection was connected , and recommended the users to use VPN ( virtual private networks ) to get access to the Internet . &quot;
# cens@@ or@@ ship : activ@@ ates your VPN .
it seems that websites Venezu@@ el@@ an providers are once again locked .
this is from the page of @ Vi@@ vo@@ Play@@ Net .
&quot; offers such as Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay are popular with the Venezu@@ el@@ ans with Internet access , especially in times of un@@ rest . &quot;
&quot; traditional media have been rel@@ uc@@ t@@ ant to reporting on protests since 2014 . at that time , the Commission threatened with fin@@ es and closing statements when they continue to report on the demonstrations , as the Commission viewed this as a &quot; call to violence . &quot; &quot;
without cable TV and informative national TV channels I registered with @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net again .
&quot; surprisingly , that is still cheaper than buying two liters of lem@@ on@@ ade . &quot;
&quot; the local NGO VE@@ in@@ filtr@@ tro later confirmed that not only Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay is in@@ accessible through a blocking of the Domain Name System ( DNS ) , but also two more online channels . &quot;
&quot; earlier research conducted by the Institute for Press and Society ( IP@@ YS ) , a research group for digital rights in Venezuela , had shown that the local Internet providers sometimes use DNS . &quot;
&quot; if a web site is blocked by the DNS , the server respon@@ ds or ref@@ uses to call such a web page . &quot;
&quot; we confirm a DNS @-@ lock : @ el@@ capit@@ oli@@ ot@@ v , @ V@@ P@@ IT@@ V and @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net &quot;
&quot; at V@@ P@@ IT@@ V , a third chann@@ eled channel , the transmission was stopped on Thursday , April 6 , when the V@@ P@@ IT@@ V cam@@ er@@ aman El@@ vis Flor@@ es , who carried the protests in Car@@ ac@@ as live , was det@@ ained . &quot;
Flor@@ es was defeated while he was in police custo@@ dy .
&quot; eight hours later he was released , and V@@ P@@ IT@@ V went on stream again . &quot;
&quot; although some channels are still accessible via YouTube , it was also reported that the government regul@@ ates the Internet connections : that means that the Venezu@@ el@@ ans access multimedia coverage of the current events in the country more and more difficult . &quot;
in Paraguay a lot of girls become slaves to get an education
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was a cri@@ adi@@ ta as a child . now she visits the house in which she worked for years .
&quot; today , Tina fights for the rights of children and coll@@ ects witnesses of other Cri@@ adi@@ ans who have been victims of abuse and discrimination . &quot;

the following article is the shor@@ tened version of a cor@@ dial report published by Global Vo@@ ices with kind permission of the authors .
&quot; the article is part of a series titled &quot; Vac@@ as que v@@ u@@ el@@ an , es@@ cu@@ el@@ as que CA@@ EN &quot; ( &quot; Flying C@@ ows , Rand@@ om Schools &quot; ) , which is edited and re @-@ released by Global Vo@@ ices Latin America . &quot;
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a lived eight years in a household where she was not allowed to eat together with the family who lived there .
shortly before she graduated from the university she returned to the house and heard how the owner of the house spoke full of pride about her . &quot; she is like a daughter for us .
&quot; she who has become something , &quot; she said . &quot;
but Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was never treated like a daughter in this house .
&quot; when she was ten years old , she began to work as Cri@@ adi@@ ta for the family . in Paraguay the more than 46@@ ,000 boys and girls who are forced to work to go to school . &quot;
&quot; the business is quite simple : a big family with little money passes her min@@ e@@ years son or her min@@ der@@ age daughter to another , rich family . in exchange , the child gets food , training and a roof over the head . &quot;
&quot; however , what is not mentioned is that the children have to do so inn@@ umer@@ able days of house@@ work that will never be paid and victims of abuse and abuse - and all that within the framework of a contract that cannot be raised . &quot;
&quot; this practice , called Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go , is widespread in Paraguay because of the participation and acceptance by large parts of society and despite numerous complaints from human rights organisations . &quot;
&quot; after completing her studies , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked for a few years for an organization fighting for the rights of boys and girls . &quot;
&quot; she spoke with Cri@@ adi@@ tas , especially young girls affected by the practice of the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go - collected testim@@ onies , resear@@ ched and den@@ o@@ unced . &quot;
&quot; she tried to name things in the name , because the feeling of gratitude that is vacc@@ inated to the Cri@@ adi@@ tas guarantees in general silence . &quot;
&quot; the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go is based on a double illusion , &quot; says Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a . &quot;
&quot; on the one hand , the family who is their daughter in the belief that they conclude their education , improve their position in society and &quot; &quot; make something out of themselves &quot; &quot; to another family . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , the family who res@@ umes the girl and justi@@ fies their exploitation with faith that they would give someone a chance that would otherwise have no training , and perhaps even star@@ ved . &quot;
the victims of the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go
&quot; when the girl is mi@@ stre@@ ated , his family will be experienced only many years later . &quot;
sometimes they never experience it .
&quot; in January 2016 , the relatively unknown phenomenon that occurs in exile in par@@ agu@@ ay@@ ian households , but a face . &quot;
&quot; when Carolina Mar@@ ín got into the hospital in Ca@@ agu@@ az@@ ú , her body showed traces of heavy blow@@ s . shortly afterwards she died . &quot;
she was 14 years old .
she was Cri@@ adi@@ ta in the household of the former military person Tom@@ ás Fer@@ rei@@ ra and his wife Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo who works as a civil servant at the Einwohn@@ er@@ mel@@ de@@ amt .
&quot; Mar@@ ín lived with them in their house in V@@ aqu@@ er@@ ía , a small town with only 3,000 inhabitants 250 kilometers east of the capital As@@ unci@@ ón . &quot;
&quot; at the end of January 2016 , Fer@@ rei@@ ra proposed a stick to Mar@@ ín until they suffered deadly injuries . &quot;
this should be the last punishment in the life of the young girl .
a few days later the media reported about the incident .
they stressed that the murdered child was a cri@@ adi@@ ta .
organizations such as UN@@ IC@@ EF or Call@@ es@@ cu@@ ela made the deep in the Paragu@@ ay@@ an society rooted in the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go &apos;s death for the death of the girl .
they called the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go as &quot; a modern form of slavery . &quot;
several dozen people came together to protest demonstrations and demanded that there should be no further Carolina &quot; in Paraguay .
the name of the girl and photos were widely used in social media .
&quot; in Paraguay , more cows are registered as children , &quot; said Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a . &quot;
&quot; without papers , it is much easier to hurt the rights of children . &quot;
&quot; without official documents it is very difficult to control , under which conditions boys and girls live . &quot;
the neighb@@ ors of the married couple and almost 60 civil society organisations called for a prompt investigation of the case .
&quot; they want Tom@@ ás Fer@@ rei@@ ra and Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo for the murder of the girl who was her Cri@@ adi@@ ta , sentenced to 30 years in prison . &quot;
&quot; if the case occurs in court , the case of Carolina Mar@@ ín could be landmark - if for the first time in the history of Paraguay a case of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go arrives in court . &quot;
the everyday life of a cri@@ adi@@ ta
&quot; the Cri@@ adi@@ tas are exploited not only as workers , they also live isolated from other girls at their age . &quot;
&quot; Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was ten years old when the farmer , in which her father worked , had to register bank@@ rup@@ t@@ cy and her father lost his work . &quot;
&quot; their brothers now had to go all work and began selling swe@@ ets on the street , or on the market to earn money . &quot;
but they all went to school .
only Tina was sent as a Cri@@ adi@@ ta to the capital As@@ unci@@ ón .
&quot; in the house of her employers , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked between four and six hours every day . &quot;
they had to divide the time in such a way that you still have time to learn .
it was at five o &apos;clock in the morning and prepared the breakfast for their employers .
&quot; for example , it cle@@ ans@@ ed the fridge , clean the living room , polished the furniture and dis@@ infected the floor . &quot;
&quot; when the school ended , she went home again and had time to learn . &quot;
&quot; the more she finished with learning , the more leisure time she had . &quot;
but even this time was limited because they had to make dinner for their employers .
&quot; Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a says she never had to star@@ ve , but didn &apos;t get unlimited food . &quot; I was allowed to pick up more books from the library &apos;s library as food from the fridge , &quot; she rec@@ alls . &quot;
&quot; the library was well equipped and belonged to the landlord , a former military and sympath@@ iser of Parti@@ do Liber@@ al , a liberal party , which was in power during the dictatorship of Al@@ fre@@ do Stro@@ ess@@ ner , who was in power from 1954 to 1989 . &quot;
&quot; at some evenings the landlord Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a , next to him , to stand alongside him and to read articles from Op@@ posi@@ tional newspapers such as Sender@@ o &quot; or &quot; El Pu@@ eb@@ lo . &quot; &quot;
he tried to persu@@ ade them to give no faith to the reports of the official media about the dict@@ ator &apos;s regime .
&quot; he kept them intellig@@ ently , but didn &apos;t stay with her . &quot; &quot; the house@@ keeper had found someone who listened while talking about politics , &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; they didn &apos;t often allow me to visit my family because they thought I would be able to learn &quot; bad habits &quot; there , so they supposed that Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a , who belonged to the indigenous group of the Guar@@ an@@ í , would return home to their native language Guar@@ an@@ í . &quot;
&quot; their Lord feared that they would lose the education they had allowed to lose , she explains . &quot;
&quot; she was completely clear , however , that she had paid for everything she got from them , with her hard work . &quot;

&quot; in January 2015 , a woman published the following text in a Facebook group , where you can share job advertisements for cleaning staff and children &apos;s girls in Paraguay . &quot;
&quot; the group &apos;s administrators are Pep@@ a Kos@@ ti@@ an@@ ov@@ sky , a city counc@@ ill@@ or in As@@ unci@@ ón . &quot;

please contact you .
starting from Monday if possible .
the ad received five &quot; likes &quot; and many comments .
a woman from the place Ñ@@ em@@ by wrote that she had a el@@ f@@ old girl and gave her telephone number .
&quot; another woman , who also came out of Ñ@@ em@@ by , offered her 15 @-@ year @-@ old ni@@ ece . &quot; she likes small children and is very pretty , &quot; she wrote . &quot;
&quot; in the third comment , &quot; a girl from the interior who wants to work . &quot; &quot;
then the summary of the ad then turned out once again :
&quot; dear friends , I found one . I think it works with it . &quot;

draft legislation dict@@ ates Egyptian users of social media to register with the government
&quot; image from Pix@@ ab@@ ay , modified by Global Vo@@ ices . &quot;
published under the Public Domain CC@@ 0 .
&quot; sixty Egyptian parliam@@ ent@@ arians have recently agreed to draft law on &quot; &quot; regul@@ ating the use and use of social networks . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; if he is accepted by Parliament , users and users of social media must register in Egypt with a government authority to use social media including Facebook and Twitter . &quot;
&quot; on the basis of the law , a place would then be established that is tas@@ ked with making citizens a permit to share social media . &quot;
&quot; within six months of acceptance of the law , users and users would have to register on the site of the site with their right names and identity numbers to use social networks . &quot;
&quot; if it fails to do so , it could bring a penalty of up to six months of det@@ ention or a fine of money . &quot;
&quot; the bill , consisting of six Par@@ ag@@ ra@@ ins and in local media including You@@ m@@ 7 and Egypt Independent cur@@ ses , defines social media as &quot; any application that runs through the Internet and is used to communicate with others by means of voice , vide@@ ophone and text . &quot;
&quot; it is uncle@@ ar how the law is en@@ forced when it is accepted , since the draft has no indication of how Egyptian authorities are not able to register with the registration , considering the fact that the Egyptian government is currently unable to guarantee the regulation at the level of social media companies . &quot;
&quot; Ri@@ y@@ ad Ab@@ dul Satt@@ ar , Member of Parliament and promot@@ er of the bill , told the magazine Al @-@ Monitor , registered users and users received a username and password to get through the fire@@ wall that blocked Facebook . &quot;
&quot; this could mean that Egypt is planning to create a fire@@ wall on a national level around Facebook . because of them , it would be necessary for Egyptians to submit information on their identity to access the network . &quot;
but it is not known until now that such plans exist .
experts on site are scep@@ tical about the technical feasi@@ bility of the proposal .
&quot; Ram@@ y Ra@@ o@@ of , Senior Research Techn@@ ologist ( in German &quot; conducting research techn@@ ologist &quot; ) of the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights ( E@@ IP@@ R , in German &quot; Egyptian initiative for personal rights &quot; ) , told Global Vo@@ ices : &quot;
I doubt the technical capacity and understanding of any authority in Egypt regarding things related to technology .
&quot; in my opinion , they imagine that just as they are violent in physical public and private spaces it could also be done online . &quot;
&quot; if I take them seriously , it means that they will set up a powerful monitoring system to filter citizens who seek approval or not . and that means a crazy system to monitor the activity of people and also to bring them to a trial process . &quot;
&quot; this is technically by no means realistic , but everything is possible in Egypt . &quot;
&quot; in order to be adopted as a law , the draft must first be deb@@ ated by the Parliament &apos;s legislative and constitutional committee before it enters the plenary debate . &quot;
&quot; whether his assumption and enforcement will be successful or not , the draft is in line with a pro @-@ military mind@@ set in parliament , in which the control is maxim@@ ized and ensuring that no other nar@@ ration is present on the image area , &quot; says Ra@@ o@@ of . &quot;
&quot; last year , the Tam@@ er El @-@ Sh@@ ah@@ aw@@ y held a bill against cy@@ ber crime , in which a life @-@ long prison term was intended for those who are found guilty of threatening the &quot; public order &quot; and &quot; to protest &quot; to protest . &quot;

high up in the mountains of the Kur@@ dist@@ an region in the northeast of Iraq work the veter@@ an H@@ ana Ah@@ med R@@ aza and her team of scientists of the non @-@ governmental organization Nature Iraq to protect the gh@@ ost@@ ly Persian le@@ op@@ ards .
&quot; a sub@@ type of the larger family of le@@ op@@ ards fought through Africa and Asia belong to the Persian le@@ op@@ ards ( Pan@@ ther@@ a par@@ dus sax@@ ic@@ ol@@ or ) . in total , there are between 800 and 1,000 animals , so the International Union for Conservation of Nature . &quot;
why is this particular type of le@@ op@@ ard so important ?
&quot; as R@@ aza shows in the video , &quot; the Persian le@@ op@@ ard is the only remaining pre@@ dat@@ or in the Kur@@ dish ecos@@ ystem &quot; and the health and the growth of the ecos@@ ystem depends also on the fact that a large pre@@ dat@@ or is present . &quot;
&quot; the chance to see a Persian le@@ op@@ ard actually in the free game is low and goes against zero . when the team in the video shows that they have a shot of a big cat in the camera , R@@ aza breaks in pure joy . &quot;
&quot; as a trained Biolog@@ in , R@@ aza likes to passion@@ ately reveal a different side of her country , which consists not only of war and conflict . &quot;
she has been involved in field studies on wild animals and educational programs of Nature Iraq for six years .

&quot; at the beginning of March 2017 , the daily K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ imp@@ o , the daily newspaper K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ imp@@ o , documented the progress made in the last six years to re@@ build the lives of those affected by the &quot; triple disaster &quot; of March 2011 . a huge earthquake , a ts@@ un@@ ami and an atom accident in Fu@@ kus@@ him@@ a had triggered the catastrophe . &quot;
&quot; the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ ingu@@ o newspaper has its headquarters in Sen@@ da@@ i , which is located in Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i Pre@@ f@@ ecture . the pre@@ f@@ ecture of Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was a real pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures in Japan &apos;s northeast , which had to experience both the earthquake and the ts@@ un@@ ami . &quot;
hundreds of thousands of people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and the neighbouring pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures Fu@@ kus@@ him@@ a and I@@ w@@ ate were inevitable because the ts@@ un@@ ami had left whole coastal towns from the map .
&quot; in addition , Fu@@ kus@@ him@@ a pre@@ f@@ ecture has experienced a nuclear accident , already alone , 160 000 inhabitants had to leave their homes . &quot;
the special report of the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ imp@@ o shows which progress was reached six years later in order to re@@ build the life of local residents .
the detailed report of the newspaper contains both the statistics of the Japanese re@@ building authority as well as survey results of those affected themselves .
&quot; housing construction in Fu@@ kus@@ him@@ a , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate &quot;
&quot; the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ ingu@@ o newspaper reported that up to December 2015 , 77 percent of the planned replacement houses ( the second @-@ of @-@ the @-@ second , the sa@@ ig@@ ai k@@ ou@@ ei ju@@ ut@@ ak@@ u ) were finished in the Fu@@ kus@@ him@@ a , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures . &quot;
&quot; Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i recorded the biggest success among the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures , here 80 percent of the planned replacement houses were completed . &quot;
&quot; I@@ w@@ ate has completed 75 percent of these buildings , whereas Fu@@ kus@@ him@@ a with 70 percent represents the final light . &quot;
&quot; even six years after the catastrophe , even six years after the catastrophe , ev@@ acu@@ ated von Beh@@ el@@ fs@@ under@@ mines ( us@@ ef@@ ac@@ su ju@@ ut@@ ak@@ u ) to settle into final replacement houses . &quot;
after the three @-@ fold catastrophe nearly 80 000 people were forced to live in shel@@ ters .
&quot; in December 2016 more and more 36@@ ,000 people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , Fu@@ kus@@ him@@ a and I@@ w@@ ate lived in such homes . &quot;
&quot; almost 40 percent of the years in 2011 were still living in emergency shel@@ ters , whereas Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was more successful . &quot;
&quot; for I@@ w@@ ate , the number is 34 percent . &quot;
the stand of work and everyday life in the three affected pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures
&quot; as the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ imp@@ o newspaper could determine , 10@@ 74 of 1100 schools that were affected by mis@@ fortune , opened their doors until December 2016 , which accounts for almost 98 percent of the schools of the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures . &quot;
six years later the industrial re@@ building in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures is far more difficult .
&quot; while almost 100 percent of the fishing ports in I@@ w@@ ate and Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i are now in operation , only 30 percent of the fishing ports have res@@ um@@ ed their operations in Fu@@ kus@@ him@@ a . &quot;
&quot; the ts@@ un@@ ami and the atomic accident , have large area in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures of agr@@ arian land . &quot;
&quot; Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i could recover 93 percent of its agricultural land , with only 66 percent of agricultural land in I@@ w@@ ate and less than 50 percent destroyed agricultural land in Fu@@ kus@@ him@@ a . &quot;
&quot; it is unlikely that this is only a consequence of nuclear accident , because only 690 hectares of 5 400 hectares of land @-@ destroyed land of Fu@@ kus@@ him@@ a are located in the &quot; nuclear barrier zone . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in two of the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures the tourism has recovered largely , but also here Fu@@ kus@@ him@@ a remains far away . &quot;
&quot; the tourist figures in Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate are up to 90 percent on the same level as before the mis@@ fortune . Fu@@ kus@@ him@@ a , on the other hand , can only have 75 percent . &quot;
&quot; however , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ ingu@@ o newspaper reported that since the catastrophe almost half of the coastal inhabitants , it is more difficult to earn their li@@ vel@@ ihood . &quot;
is the native population prepared for the next big earthquake ?
&quot; in order to determine the overall picture , the newspaper conducted numerous surveys among the local population and among the ev@@ ac@@ uation . she asked her about the status of reconstruction and also how its emp@@ athy has changed compared to the ts@@ un@@ ami risk . &quot;
&quot; in their introduction of the article , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ imp@@ o newspaper explains : &quot;
the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ imp@@ o conducted a survey to learn more about the ts@@ un@@ ami awareness among the native population .
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; however , 55.@@ 9 percent of respon@@ dents are found that still haven &apos;t been done enough in disaster prevention . &quot;
how it is about those who had to be ev@@ acu@@ ated from the Fu@@ kus@@ him@@ a pre@@ f@@ ecture
&quot; in their edition commemor@@ ating the anniversary of the earthquake , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ imp@@ o newspaper has also focused their attention on the situation of the ev@@ ac@@ uation from Fu@@ kus@@ him@@ a . &quot;
&quot; Fu@@ kus@@ him@@ a had not only had to witness the tremendous earthquake and devast@@ ating ts@@ un@@ ami , no , Fu@@ kus@@ him@@ a pre@@ f@@ ecture has also witnessed the worst , dis@@ astro@@ us , nuclear accident that Japan had ever experienced . &quot;
&quot; of 160 000 ev@@ ac@@ uation from Fu@@ kus@@ him@@ a , nearly 63 000 people were reloc@@ ated to areas outside the pre@@ f@@ ecture . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of 2016 some more than 23 000 people had been reloc@@ ated to Fu@@ kus@@ him@@ a , in permanent replacement houses . &quot;
&quot; after 2017 , there are still 4@@ 0,000 inhabitants of Fu@@ kus@@ him@@ a outside their home pre@@ f@@ ecture . &quot;
&quot; in the disaster areas , most of the ev@@ ac@@ uation centres still exist in homes , older than 50 years old . these are building projects that are part of the Olympic Games , which are part of the Olympic Games , which will take place in Tokyo in 2020 . &quot;
the world is small : our pod@@ cast &quot; In@@ to the Deep &quot;
&quot; when people meet people from other countries who speak a different language , the differences seem to be greater than the simil@@ arities . &quot;
&quot; after a while , however , one often recognizes that one more connects than it seems at first sight . &quot;
&quot; these global connections are important since they challenge our pre@@ judi@@ ces , expand our perspectives and remind us that the world is ultimately very small . &quot;
&quot; in this episode of In@@ to the Deep , the Global Vo@@ ices Pod@@ cast , we look closely to these global connections . in our In@@ to the Deep Pod@@ cast , we treat issues that often get less attention in reporting than they deserve . &quot;
we speak with five Global Vo@@ ices members who recall a moment in which they have felt very strongly connected to someone about language and country borders .
Ver@@ on@@ iki Kri@@ kon@@ i talks about the simil@@ arities of Greek and Turkish ; Tor@@ i E@@ gher@@ man explains how the love of music has strengthened the lack of shared language skills during a trip in rural China ; and Jo@@ ey Ay@@ ou@@ b looks back on his experiences he has collected in a small village in Madagascar .

a Brazilian student at the age of 33 was delivered to the intensive care station last Friday .
Mat@@ eus Fer@@ rei@@ ra da Silva who studies social sciences at the University of Go@@ i@@ ás has suffered a skull @-@ brain trau@@ ma and several frac@@ tures .
doctors operated him this Saturday and have now moved him into an artificial comm@@ a .
his condition is considered to be critical .
the local image journalist Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z made photos of the attack on Mat@@ eus that quickly spread within a few days rapidly in Brazil .
on the pictures is also the face of the police officer who attacked with a stroke . the man was identified as August@@ o S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o .
&quot; after the incident , the military police in the Brazilian state of Go@@ i@@ ás announced that S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o had been suspended from the active ministry until the end of the investigation . &quot;
the pictures show the police officers as he suggests in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia with his stroke on the face of the student Mat@@ eus Fer@@ rei@@ ra ( photos : Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z ) .
&quot; if a police officers were beaten by a demonstr@@ ator and land on the intensive care station , his face would be seen for six months in television and the entire repression would be justified . &quot;
&quot; the Facebook page &quot; Des@@ neur@@ aliz@@ ador , &quot; a press channel by media activists from Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia , shared the video taken by Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z , in which you see how Mat@@ eus attacked by the police officer and hur@@ ry several plum@@ bers shortly afterwards . &quot;
&quot; another video with the same scenes , but fil@@ med from another perspective , is also immersed in social networks . &quot;
in the clip shown below you can see the attack on Mat@@ eus starting at 50@@ th second .
&quot; for the family of Mat@@ eus , who lives in another state , Internet users have meanwhile donated 10.000 Brazi@@ li@@ ans ( about 2,@@ 700 euros ) to cover some of the costs for medical treatment and enable his family to stay in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia while he is in hospital . &quot;
&quot; be brave , Mat@@ eus . &quot;

&quot; on Facebook , Professor Pablo Ort@@ ell@@ ado calls for further violence against activists in Go@@ i@@ ás : &quot;
&quot; Go@@ i@@ ás experiences a wave of political power : here the activ@@ ist Gu@@ il@@ her@@ me Irish was murdered by his father , because he was killed by a W@@ hat@@ s@@ App group , where he was attacked by a police officer , who was attacked by a police officer , who struck him with a stroke . &quot;
password :
&quot; Go@@ i@@ ás was not the only state in Brazil , in which it came to brutal police operations against demonstr@@ ators last Friday . &quot;
&quot; police officers used protests in the centre of Rio de Janeiro , where demonstr@@ ators had built a stage for speakers , Gum@@ mig@@ en@@ rade and Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as . &quot;
&quot; the MP Fla@@ vio Ser@@ af@@ ini , Socialist and Peace Party ( P@@ SO@@ L ) , asked the police to reno@@ unce violence against demonstr@@ ators via loud@@ speakers . &quot;
&quot; this also includes a report in Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo , one of the oldest newspapers throughout the country . &quot;
&quot; once again , the Brazilian media watched street protests by ste@@ aling the focus on another unexpected protagon@@ ist : a window disc . &quot;
the Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo and Est@@ ado de S. Paulo were specifically reported on a broken glass window to illustrate their titles illustr@@ atively with a photo .
&quot; on the other hand , the O Glob@@ o preferred a title story with a set @-@ up bus . &quot;
there is no plau@@ sible journ@@ alistic background to report more about a broken wind@@ screen than the protests of thousands of people who serve the defense of a special thing .
you have to recognize this also if you are strictly against any form of damage .
&quot; here too , the term &quot; v@@ and@@ alism &quot; is an absurd , di@@ spro@@ por@@ tion@@ ate meaning , and the typical violent acts of the military police are dealt with by head@@ lines with the title &quot; demonstr@@ ators on con@@ front@@ ational discourse with the police . &quot; &quot;
the Vill@@ ages forgotten by the Ab@@ indu@@ str@@ alization in Cuba
&quot; with the introduction of the law of Á@@ l@@ varo Re@@ yn@@ oso , almost hundreds of sugar cane factories in all Cuba closed doors ( Photo : Juli@@ o B@@ ati@@ sta ) &quot;
&quot; the Volks@@ gemeinde Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ é Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich , located in the Western Cu@@ ban province of May@@ abe@@ que , is commonly known as el Central - in Spanish sugar mill - regardless of the fact that there is no significant sugar harvest on site . &quot;
it is two years ago when the activities were paraly@@ sed in the sugar cane factories .
&quot; after experiencing the sugar cane industry stood still in the region , and the factory lost its plants until only the ru@@ mor of steel and concrete remained . &quot;
approximately 272 workers had to inv@@ ent themselves .
some changed the work .
&quot; others res@@ igned and comm@@ uting daily to the factories , which still gr@@ ind . &quot;
&quot; N@@ ene , a soldier veter@@ an , who breaks every day at 4 : 00 a.m. , the crisis in the sugar cane industry does not ro@@ b his sleep . &quot;
he heard that there are sugar cane factories in the east of the region that are in operation after a long in@@ active time because they were received .
that was something he did not expect .
&quot; N@@ ene is a reminder to have heard that in Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich the sugar cane factory would be preserved , but the promise was not kept . &quot;
&quot; the sugar cane industry has already resist@@ ed pl@@ agues , the fall of socialism , low market prices , in@@ efficiency , bad management decisions and climate change . &quot;
&quot; in 2016 , the production amounted to 1.6 million tonnes of sugar , less than the 1910 produced . &quot;
&quot; the message would have been a motive for the country for a few decades , but the bad harv@@ ests are no more news . &quot;
why was the Cu@@ ban sugar cane industry switched off ?
the old railway platform of the church already saw better times .
( photo : Juli@@ o B@@ ati@@ sta )
the reduction of the sugar cane industry was an economic necessity : the 155 sugar cane factories were technically de@@ prec@@ ated and hardly competitive they became unbe@@ ar@@ able for the country .
&quot; the initial idea was to focus production on the most efficient factories , the annual production objective was 4 million tonnes . &quot;
&quot; they left only the factories , which can produce sugar for a maximum of 4 Cent@@ av@@ os ( 0,@@ 03 Euro ) . &quot;
the solution to unemployment ?
the motives which led to such measures were the low productivity of sugar cane plant@@ ations and the sugar crisis on the world market .
&quot; nevertheless , the sugar price rose again about a decade ago . &quot;
&quot; from 2017 to 2025 , the price of un@@ refined sugar@@ s between 15 and 16 Cent@@ av@@ os per pound must remain , according to the 2016 report of the &quot; Rural Development Prosp@@ ects &quot; by the OECD and FA@@ O , the Agricultural and Food Organization of the United Nations . &quot;
&quot; if the current production would reach the level of 2001 ( 3.6 million tonnes ) , raw sugar exports would generate about 85 million dollars for the country . &quot;
not everything went well
&quot; the present day will certainly go into history , &quot; these were the first words of the Cu@@ ban President Fi@@ del Castro during his speech on October 21 , 2002 at the sugar factory in Lav@@ ander@@ o . &quot;
&quot; from then on , the process of restructuring in the sugar industry began . &quot;
&quot; in the following years , a total of 98 sugar cane mills , more than 65 million people , got their full sal@@ aries for further education . &quot;
the same thing happened in the sugar cane factory Greg@@ orio Ar@@ l@@ ée Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich on May 14 2004 .
Luis Alberto Pé@@ rez worked in the factory since 1967 .
&quot; when N@@ ene , as he is known as a soldier , talks about the closure of the factory , the word he is most repeated is &quot; sc@@ am . &quot; &quot;
almost all respon@@ dents are in the same opinion : not one of them was informed that the factory would be shut down .
&quot; in order to preserve the place , they formed a full @-@ time working group . &quot;
&quot; before the first leg of the year , the first letters began to come . &quot;
&quot; it was officially conf@@ isc@@ ated documents , which would only differ in relation to the parts that would be removed , the addres@@ see and the date . &quot;
&quot; all of them were signed by Ul@@ an Ros@@ ales del Toro , only the Minister could appro@@ ve any withdrawal . &quot;
&quot; from then on , the responsibility was taken over and the letters were getting more and more frequent . &quot;
&quot; Juan Carlos River@@ o was responsible for the shut @-@ down factory for two years and he was one who received the letters . &quot; &quot; the country had no money for the sugar cane factories operated in operation , &quot; he ass@@ ures . &quot;
&quot; Ed@@ dy Re@@ yes , 64 years , wa@@ its for retirement in another plant , the Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma . &quot;
&quot; he was involved in the construction of the factory , whose construction he helped . &quot;
&quot; with each part he removed , he disman@@ tled one of his 31 years of work . &quot;
the most advanced industrial area of Cuba and the most important workplace producer has been wi@@ ped out .
&quot; in many cases , there were no alternatives for jobs and services rendered in the communities in which they were located . &quot;
&quot; we will never know if during the Mam@@ mut speech of October 21 , 2002 , the former President looked into the eyes of the persons present when he guaranteed that for the areas whose factories were no longer in operation , everything would run well . &quot;
the price of the population for the closure of the sugar cane factories
since 2004 sugar cane is extracted only high by grinding .
( photo : Juli@@ o B@@ ati@@ sta )
&quot; after two years , the Volks@@ gemeinde Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ é Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich learned that many things change , but not always for the better when a factory is closed . &quot;
&quot; when the sugar cane factory closed , or better said than they began to aver@@ t them , they also stopped to asp@@ hal@@ ve the road , dis@@ advant@@ aged by other farms . &quot;
&quot; without work in the region , and with advanced age , N@@ ene and Ed@@ dy had to look for other factories . &quot;
they became spare parts .
&quot; without a future perspective , many young people also left the region . &quot;
&quot; in the area , a food factory was created , whose production is not even used for the supply of the community . &quot;
the ruins of the factory behind the new plant are still imposing .
&quot; at the end of 2016 , N@@ ene returned to the factory Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma , the ruins of the place where he started working . &quot;
forty @-@ nine harv@@ ests bring a pension of two thousand Pes@@ o per month to spend the years retired in Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich .
&quot; Mr. N@@ ene , a man of black skin color , small , with few teeth and clear voice , is not a night @-@ bearing person , but he does not forgive the lies you told him . &quot;
they have tor@@ ment him for ten years .
&quot; N@@ ene goes back with 65 years in pension , not because it lack strength , but because it is bit@@ tern@@ ess . &quot;

young people of the First Nations communities across Canada deal with topics that are important to them . they do it by means of hip @-@ hop thanks to a number of walking workshops .
&quot; as part of the N &apos;@@ we J@@ in@@ an @-@ Tour , workshop leaders have been bringing workshops and youth centres directly to schools and youth centres in order to teach youth groups song@@ writing , recording , audio and video production and live performances . &quot;
&quot; the original workshops were led by the ped@@ ago@@ gue David Hod@@ ges , who lives in Montreal and worked in North Quebec with ten Cre@@ e communities and then collabor@@ ated with the Cre@@ e Hip @-@ Hop group The North@@ Star . &quot;
&quot; the workshop assumes that the young participants engage in talks on topics such as &quot; cultural identity , language , debate , love , self @-@ acceptance , &quot; or whatever comes to mind . &quot;
these questions are inspiration for songs and videos in which teenagers are the main actors .
&quot; because the workshops were so popular , the team also worked with other First Nations communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and was invited to organize similar workshops with the tribe of the Win@@ ne@@ b@@ ago in Neb@@ ras@@ ka . &quot;
&quot; this video of the school &apos; Na Ak@@ sa Gy@@ il@@ ak &apos; Yo@@ o in the area of the tribe of the Kit@@ sum@@ kal@@ um First Nation in British Columbia , for example , tells the story of Highway 16 , also called Highway of T@@ ears , a road section in western Canada , where almost two dozen mostly indigenous young women disappeared or murdered . &quot;
the cases were largely un@@ explained .
the next video of the Nem@@ as@@ ka Cre@@ e First Nation uses the motif of a video player to convey how important the preservation of traditional customs and customs despite the influences caused by glob@@ alisation .
&quot; many of the songs appeared in indigenous languages , although the young people have not always ma@@ stered the languages of the First Nations . &quot;
&quot; in the following song , that the Wh@@ ap@@ mag@@ oo@@ stu@@ i Cre@@ e First Nation has recorded , the chor@@ us will be sung on Cre@@ e . &quot;
the young people involved got some help from Gary J@@ olly from the North@@ star Hip @-@ Hop group who gave them a stop@@ per in the Eastern James Bay Cre@@ e dial@@ ect .
&quot; on the Facebook page of N &apos;@@ we J@@ in@@ an , the verse is available in circulation , as well as a translation into English , which is translated into German : &quot;
sometimes I feel like nobody would ever be interested in myself
but I try to continue my days on Earth
that is the day when you will take our cry out
because we as youth have lost our way in life
but I believe that we will rise up one day
I don &apos;t want to see how they live a bad life
this is how they can grow and also lead to our youth .
so they can do what they intended for the Creator .
&quot; in the commentary part , the reader and pro@@ pon@@ ent of the Cre@@ e @-@ Language Kevin Bro@@ us@@ se@@ au also make a contribution and adds the verse to the sy@@ rup ( which is also published on his blog and published here with permission ) : &quot;
plastic dishes are not only shown in the restaurant in Japan
&quot; plastic dishes ( the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; restaurants ) outside of a typical restaurant in Japan . &quot;

in Japan you can see plastic dishes almost every restaurant .
&quot; to show potential customers what is exactly on the menu , are displayed near the entrance sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin san@@ pur@@ u ( the &quot; &quot; Plas@@ tics models of the dishes &quot; &quot; ) of each food served in this restaurant . &quot;
the customers look at these plastic dishes and then decide whether they enter the restaurant or go on .
there is a whole industry dedicated to the manufacture of these plastic dishes .
&quot; in the to@@ ki@@ oter district of Kapp@@ ab@@ ashi , there are a variety of these small enterprises that produce precisely those plastic dishes that the German film@@ maker W@@ im Wen@@ ders documented in his film Tokyo @-@ G@@ a more than 20 years ago . &quot;
&quot; for most Japanese , these plastic dishes are so ordinary that they don &apos;t even notice them even more . however , a new trend will turn them into show@@ y mobile accessories and other gad@@ gets today . &quot;
N@@ aver Mat@@ omas published the Blog@@ ger it@@ ini@@ i range of social media links and photos that show this unusual twist with the sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin san@@ pur@@ u .
&quot; now in special sale : new with plastic courts decorated mobile phone bands , as shown in the Ki@@ chi@@ jo@@ ji Tok@@ y@@ u department store . &quot;
&quot; many of these artificial foods have been turned into kit@@ sch@@ y collective objects , as in this case , refrigerator mag@@ nets : &quot;
here are a few Sho@@ ku@@ hin refriger@@ ators for a new exhibition in Tokyo Station .
the new boom in essenti@@ als is becoming increasingly more complex .
&quot; in this case , an emper@@ or @-@ don ( a popular rice dish with seafood ) was turned into a cell phone stand . &quot;
for this tri@@ angular bowl ( lo@@ l ) we found a good use as a mobile phone stand .
we also made this part for the exhibition in Tokyo Station .
here is an apple that holds your mobile phone :
&quot; designed to look like an apple , with a not@@ ch for the mobile phone , this is already a great design . &quot;
and this is just the beginning of an increasing flight into the Com@@ ic .
&quot; some cell phone support and mobile designers allow you to make your own work of art . in this case ik@@ ura or Lach@@ s@@ aber is used , a popular t@@ opping that is served with white rice . &quot;
on Twitter some users had their doubts :
&quot; is there someone who would say : &quot; wow , cool , now can I decor@@ ate my mobile phone with laughter ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think I will be the only one .
&quot; this interest in plastic courts can also take a less appe@@ tiz@@ ing form , in order to surprise some colleagues or family members un@@ pleas@@ antly . &quot;
our latest mobile phone stand has the form of mel@@ ted ice .
&quot; in addition , there are also rice balls ( On@@ ig@@ iri ) , earrings and hand@@ y@@ belts made of dried salmon . &quot;
&quot; more sk@@ ur@@ r@@ ile plastic dishes can be viewed at : it@@ ini@@ i &apos;s N@@ aver Mat@@ ome blog post . or follow on Twitter the h@@ ash@@ tag # , &quot; &quot; us@@ ury &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; if you like to learn more about the origin of this trend , this video gives you an insight into the district of Kapp@@ ab@@ ashi , dedicated to the supply of the restaurant industry . for example , with sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin san@@ pur@@ u . &quot;
the following video shows how Japanese plastic dishes are actually made .
a Mexican project tells stories of the survi@@ vors of the struggle against organised crime
&quot; for the victims of the fight against drug traff@@ ick@@ ers . &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; in reports of domestic and foreign media about the not@@ orious &quot; fight against drug traff@@ icking &quot; in Mexico , the suspic@@ ion and killing regularly appear in statistics . however , these reflect not the extent of the human tragedy that this struggle ent@@ ails . &quot;
&quot; the report on drug abuse such as El Chap@@ o Gu@@ z@@ m@@ án , the Chief of the Sin@@ alo@@ a @-@ Kart@@ ell , pressed the stories of the victims of the conflict completely into the background . &quot;
&quot; on the day after a violent incident , there is hardly anyone looking at the mour@@ ning or the churches that have learned to live with the pain . &quot;
&quot; behind each cor@@ p@@ se , behind every bone fund in the hundreds of secret tom@@ bs , the stories of countless parents , sons and daughters , friends and partners , whose wounds may never be healed . &quot;
&quot; this is why the Mexican news portal Animal Pol@@ í@@ tico has launched the digital project &quot; &quot; ap@@ render a Vi@@ vir Con El Nar@@ co &quot; &quot; ( German : &quot; &quot; to live with drug traff@@ icking &quot; &quot; ) , telling these victims a voice and tells stories of people who got into battle between the law enforcement authorities and cart@@ els . &quot;
animal Pol@@ í@@ tico describes the project so :
organised crime cannot only be feared for our lives .
the effects are far more profound .
&quot; for example , when shops close because they are threatened by traff@@ ick@@ ers and all municipalities therefore have to drive many kilometres to buy something such as milk . &quot;
the Pain of the Sac@@ ri@@ fice
&quot; a video with the title &quot; Vi@@ das que Cam@@ bian p@@ or el mi@@ edo &quot; ( German : &quot; as fear lives , &quot; ) tells exactly these stories . &quot;
&quot; a main character is Guadal@@ upe , a father looking for secret tom@@ bs every weekend . &quot;
&quot; or Emma Vel@@ eta Ro@@ dr@@ í@@ gu@@ ez , who lost her father only one day , her four si@@ bl@@ ings , her husband and two of her ne@@ ph@@ ew . &quot;
&quot; priests : &quot; &quot; as every Sunday , we prepare ourselves again today for the task which we have placed to go and search for gra@@ ves , according to the people we have loved . &quot;
Guadal@@ upe Con@@ tr@@ eras : &quot; my son is called Antonio Ivan Con@@ tr@@ eras Mat@@ a .
he was 28 when he disappeared .
he has three children .
he worked in an electric shop in El Nar@@ an@@ jo .
on 13 October he left the house .
&quot; Emma Vel@@ eta : &quot; it &apos;s very difficult for me , because I am now alone with three children who need a training . &quot;
&quot; there is also my mother , who is here with me too . &quot;
at the moment they have no income .
&quot; you stand the insurance of my father , but they won &apos;t pay them out because they require a death certificate . &quot;
where should we get them ? &quot;
the editors of &quot; ap@@ render a vi@@ vir con el Nar@@ co &quot; explain why the project is so important :
&quot; we must not only show the faces of those who are afraid . we have to show the international community the conflicts , frag@@ ility and state leadership . &quot;
the project is based on stories of readers and reports of journalists in high @-@ risk areas .
here are some excer@@ pts from the stories .
&quot; K@@ Y@@ HB , a reader of Animal Pol@@ í@@ tico , wrote this post from Tax@@ co , in the state of Gu@@ err@@ ero in central Mexico . &quot;
&quot; their contribution reminds us that violence should never be regarded as normal , no matter what form it occurs : &quot;
I have been aware of the disease and sens@@ ational journ@@ alism for several years now .
I am coming to newspaper ki@@ os@@ ks every day and see the cover pages with images that can only origin@@ ate from a text@@ book for crimin@@ ology or from acts of specialists .
it brings me out of the version .
&quot; sometimes I feel as if I am the only one who is disgu@@ sting or sad . it works , like a lack of respect for the person who once belonged to this body . &quot;
I cannot be indiffer@@ ent or consider this as normal .
she continues to write :
&quot; no , it &apos;s not normal that my 10 @-@ year @-@ old cous@@ in thinks he wants to become Nar@@ co ( German : drug dealers ) if he is great . and it is also not normal that people hear songs about the &quot; hero@@ ic deeds &quot; of the offen@@ ders when they go through the streets . &quot;
&quot; for me it is as if they ridi@@ cu@@ le those who have lost someone , and those who fear that something happens to them . &quot;
I see our weakness when stories become mere numbers in a statisti@@ c .
&quot; the crime of people is incredible for me when the death of six people and the dis@@ appearance of 43 students in a neighboring village are justified , that they were &quot; &quot; inc@@ ess@@ ant &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; I think they try to say that they remain spar@@ ed by such trage@@ dies , if they are not stir@@ ring and still . &quot;
&quot; Mari@@ bel L. from Mexico City wrote the article &quot; Four month black@@ mail in the Haupt@@ stadt@@ district , &quot; as a family with threats was pl@@ under@@ ed . &quot;
you think of everything you have lost and how some people can completely change your whole life in just a few days .
&quot; the pain of it never goes , the trau@@ ma remains , the fear comes up high when you are alone . &quot;
&quot; habits have changed , telephone numbers too . &quot;
we only contact us if it is absolutely necessary .
&quot; the more we are from each other , the better . &quot;
she closed her report with the words :
&quot; we want the others to be arrested , because you don &apos;t know when they are kid@@ n@@ apped or killed . &quot;
&quot; I asked myself in these terrible days if we@@ eping would resolve my deeply rooted feelings , but the answer is no , because I forgot how to we@@ ep . I must learn to live with the pain . &quot;
journalist Mario Gu@@ ti@@ ér@@ rez Vega released the article &quot; The forgotten children of Ci@@ ud@@ ad Ju@@ á@@ rez : a generation signed by violence . &quot;
&quot; in the introduction , he raises questions like : who cares for the child of a missing wife and a man murdered by organised crime ? &quot;
how is it to grow up in a settlement on the outskirts of the most dangerous city of Mexico ?
&quot; he is not like other boys of his age , whose parents take care of them . &quot;
&quot; Br@@ yan is a orph@@ an and he tells he had to teach himself how to cook a egg , potatoes , tor@@ till@@ as warm and &quot; Chi@@ chi &quot; for the babies who live with him . this is his name for making bottles with water , sugar and milk powder . &quot;
he tells of the nine sc@@ ars on his left leg - one for each year of life .
but they are in@@ significant compared to the pain in his eyes - un@@ speak@@ ably for a boy for whom all life consists of violence and who had to learn to live with it .
&quot; when he was five years old , he told him that his mother had disappeared . &quot;
but this was not the day when his inf@@ ancy ended .
&quot; his childhood was past two years earlier , when he was just a few blocks away from his home , the bloody body of his father , who had been shot by armed men from a passing car . &quot;
&quot; when Br@@ yan was born , the situation in Ju@@ á@@ rez looked like this : &quot;
&quot; Br@@ yan was born in 2006 , when violence was mixed by organised crime and the fight against the existing social problems in Ju@@ á@@ rez . &quot;
&quot; in 2008 , 2009 and 2010 Ju@@ á@@ rez was the most dangerous city in the world due to the number of mur@@ ders according to the state council for public security and the government of the Government of the United States . &quot;
&quot; in 2010 alone , the Prosec@@ utor &apos;s Office counted 3@@ 103 Mor@@ de . this corresponds to an average of 8.5 mur@@ ders per day . &quot;
these are just a few of hundreds of thousands of stories that leave the organised crime in Mexico and enter into the soul of the country .
&quot; only a few stories live in the face of new head@@ lines , but this project reminds us of those we must not forget . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the project &quot; ap@@ render a Vi@@ vir Con El Nar@@ co , &quot; Animal Pol@@ í@@ tico has launched the data journ@@ alism project Nar@@ co@@ data , whose goal is to portra@@ y the complex information behind the failed struggle against drug traff@@ icking in the last four decades . &quot;
when an image is worth a thousand un@@ true words
&quot; sharing is Car@@ ing &quot; by the Fli@@ ck@@ r user Ni@@ kl@@ as Wik@@ ström ( CC @-@ BY @-@ NC 2.0 ) WAR@@ N@@ ING : this post and the pages he links , contain images on which violence is represented . &quot;
the fact check is important in a moment when it comes to up@@ lift a rum@@ our or expose a for@@ gery .
&quot; but how is the years after something the first time emerged ? content in social media , no matter whether true or un@@ true , tends to pers@@ ist . &quot;
take this photo of a terrible accident seven years ago in the Democratic Republic of Congo ( DR Congo ) .
&quot; since its first publication , it has been mis@@ leading to illustrated trage@@ dies that have actually occurred in Nigeria or Myanmar . &quot;
&quot; this false coupling of picture and event - &quot; false description &quot; or &quot; wrong context &quot; in termin@@ ology of Global Vo@@ ices or First Dra@@ ft News - does not deny the fact that there is ample careful reporting of events in the DR Congo , Myanmar and Nigeria . &quot;
but it raises questions about our desire for images to messages .
what happened in the Democratic Republic of Congo
&quot; in 2010 , a tank wagon crossed the village of S@@ ange in the east of the DR Congo , til@@ ted around and explo@@ ded . 230 people came to life . &quot;
&quot; after the civil war , Africa &apos;s second largest country had been neglected and devast@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; trag@@ ically , the tank car dropped to the victim . &quot;
&quot; officials of the authorities described a fire@@ ball , the dozens of houses wrapped up , including a cinema nearby , which was full of people watching the soccer world championship . &quot;
houses pl@@ ast@@ ered and char@@ ded cor@@ p@@ ses were scattered in the streets .
many people were burned to di@@ vin@@ ity .
&quot; a picture with the title &quot; This is Nigeria . &quot; by Im@@ g@@ ur user My@@ sti@@ cal Mon@@ key , 12 January 201@@ 5.@@ Sever@@ al photos of the incident form the horri@@ ble scenes of this day . &quot;
above is an example of this .
it shows numbers of char@@ ded bodies lined up on the floor while people look at them .
but here the story is not their end .
&quot; over the years the same photo has been presented several times on social media , blogs and other platforms , and unfortunately not attributed to real but not related trage@@ dies , especially events in Nigeria and Myanmar . &quot;
what happened not in Nigeria and Myanmar
&quot; on 3 January 2015 , Bo@@ ko Har@@ am attacked the remote Nig@@ eri@@ an villages of B@@ aga and Dor@@ o G@@ ow@@ on . &quot;
ye@@ witnesses reported dr@@ astic of atro@@ cities before they had to flee .
houses and shops were burned down and dead bodies were in streets and bus@@ hes .
&quot; there were reports , according to which 150 to 2,000 people were massac@@ red . &quot;
&quot; but the numbers could not be confirmed . &quot; &quot; no one stayed back to count cor@@ p@@ ses , &quot; &quot; said a population of Human Rights Watch . &quot;
&quot; many were crus@@ hed , shot or burned . &quot;
&quot; only on the basis of satellite images , the follow @-@ up time could be illustrated . &quot;
the reason for the attack was also uncer@@ tain but the army base in B@@ aga was a permanent conflict between the military Nig@@ eri@@ as and the attempt of Bo@@ ko Har@@ am to win land ( examples from 2013 and 2015 ) .
and here the image from the DR Congo appeared once more than evidence of the fact and the possible extent of the attack was presented :
that is Nigeria .
&quot; a massac@@ re of 2,000 people took place in Paris for two days . &quot;
they are not Charlie .
they are dead .
&quot; in fact , this mis@@ use of the image from the DR Congo is only one in a series of mis@@ de@@ preci@@ ation ; Africa Check has been documented in Nigeria since 2014 . &quot;
&quot; in all these cases , the image was presented as evidence of mass kill@@ ings . &quot;
&quot; one step further , personal comments such as this may fal@@ sely fal@@ si@@ fy the image from the DR Congo with sources of mass media in connection to provide arguments . &quot;
the image from S@@ ange also appeared in connection with the deadly pursu@@ it of the Muslim Roh@@ ing@@ ya in Myanmar .
&quot; according to a flash announcement , published by the United Nations , those who were able to flee blow@@ s , rape and some dead , some through burning . &quot;
&quot; while others reported about the violence against the Roh@@ ing@@ ya , posts such as the following appeared , which brought these descriptions with photos from the DR Congo : &quot;
&quot; this picture comes from an Saudi Arabian news site , which , in 2012 , claimed that President Myanmar &apos;s Th@@ ein Sein have said , monks and politicians would have taken part in the assass@@ ination of Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . in addition , they had used the image from the DR Congo to visu@@ alize this information . &quot;
&quot; the original contribution , which was recently accessed on 26 April 2017 , can be accessed here . &quot;
&quot; other news organizations , which AF@@ P recognized as their source , had also wron@@ g@@ ly attributed to that statement , but had not linked the image from the DR Congo . &quot;
the worldwide range of false data
traces of these false coupling dates back to the years 2011 and 2012 and are actually coming from anywhere around the world .
&quot; using an &quot; &quot; reverse search &quot; &quot; you can see how far information can exceed limits . &quot;
&quot; an inver@@ ted picture search with the search engine Tin@@ eye has found 344 pictures below 18.@@ 8 billion images ( as of May 3 , 2017 ) 344 pictures which are very similar to the said image from DR Congo . &quot;
&quot; they come from a mixed mass of private pages , platforms of social media and community as well as national publications and are available in many different languages such as English , Russian , Spanish , Arabic , Dutch , German , Greek and Portuguese . &quot;
&quot; some have for@@ warded false reports , some have tried to expose the for@@ geri@@ es . &quot;
&quot; we have conf@@ isc@@ ated examples of mis@@ use and associated them with the respective countries , based on what page they have been published . thus , we want to represent the reach more clearly than by the language alone . &quot;
&quot; from the countries listed below ( which were also related to each other in some cases ) , several examples can be used for mis@@ use . &quot;
here are some cases which can now be fully ti@@ pped ( on the map in orange ) :

&quot; as a reminder , the source of the image is the Democratic Republic of Congo ( in blue ) . &quot;
&quot; Algeria , 2012 . &quot; what happens in Burma - Myanmar ? &quot; a link to the image from the DR Congo was posted in an online discussion forum ( addressed to Algeri@@ ans and interested Arabs ) as part of a thread to the &quot; war of Budd@@ hi@@ sts against Muslims . &quot; &quot;

&quot; Malaysia offers two extreme example for mis@@ use of the image from the DR Congo , on the one hand a twe@@ et , the sympathy across the Nig@@ eri@@ an massac@@ re , and on the other hand the attempt of a blo@@ gger , the claims that Roh@@ ing@@ ya are persec@@ uted , since the photos were ab@@ used . &quot;

&quot; this post , directed to the members of the Russian Orthodox Church , clearly states that the image of DR Congo does NOT show Muslims to kill Christians . &quot;
&quot; Saudi Arabia , 2012 / 2014 . &quot;
this news page unfortunately claimed that the President of Myanmar Th@@ ein Sein have admitted that monks and politicians were involved in killing the Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims and brought the story together with the image of S@@ ange .
the article was updated in 2014 and at the time of this publication the picture will continue to contain .
&quot; Spain , 2015 / 2016 . &quot;
&quot; this article from 2014 on students who had been killed by Bo@@ ko Har@@ am , published by the now deleted , the Catholic near@@ ing news site An@@ á@@ lis@@ is Digital , has expressly declared that the image is not derived from the kill@@ ings , but it claims it &apos;s a &quot; similar &quot; ji@@ hadi@@ st attack . &quot; &quot;
&quot; when the picture later came into circulation with the Bo@@ ko Har@@ am massac@@ re , the newspaper El Pa@@ is tried to refu@@ te that there were connections to Nigeria . &quot;

&quot; they wanted to achieve greater attention to these events , the presum@@ ed in the name of Islam . &quot;
&quot; USA , 2015 . &quot;
&quot; the image was wit@@ ched as evidence of the massac@@ re of Bo@@ ko Har@@ am in 2015 ( and more than 9,@@ 300 times saved ) . but the messages connected with it were not taken up in any religious context . &quot;
&quot; instead , the goal was to pay attention to the relative number of deaths and a comparison of the media coverage compared to Nigeria and the attack on Charlie Heb@@ do . &quot;
&quot; Vietnam ( Vietnam@@ ese ) , 2014 . &quot;
&quot; after a message , which was report@@ edly written by a &quot; Father Juan Carlos Mar@@ tos &quot; on the Nig@@ eri@@ an massac@@ re , there were discussions like this on Vietnam@@ ese and explained it to fal@@ seh@@ ood . &quot;

&quot; there are other confirmed examples of a faul@@ ty use of the image from Sweden , Poland , Belgium , the Netherlands and Argentina . &quot;
&quot; Tin@@ eye also points to other accounts , aggreg@@ ators and sites in the following countries ( on the portfolio in grey ) , but are no longer fully trac@@ eable : Czech Republic , Australia , India , Peru , Netherlands , Ethiopia , Sri Lanka , Azerbaijan , Japan and possibly China . &quot;
( data entries with URLs and time / date stamps exist on the craw@@ ler and occasionally they have picture file names related to Nigeria or Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . )
&quot; in all these cases , which appeared only clearly after the original return of 2010 , the picture may eventually result in a correct description , but the original contribution is not available or accessible . &quot;
frames and pictures
there are two strong themes or frames ( frames ) that go through these posts . the first frame focuses on religion .
the photograph was used in relation to greater discussions about silence in connection with the assass@@ inations of Christians by Muslims or - to defend the Muslims - the murder of Roh@@ ing@@ y@@ as by Budd@@ hi@@ sts .
a second fr@@ aming uses the image to discuss how an African life is under@@ valued compared to a European or French life .
&quot; to understand religion and the value of human life is important both . therefore , it is worthwhile to examine how images are used in connection with these efforts . &quot;
&quot; however , a deeper question is what happens if readers can no longer believe these pictures . &quot;
&quot; with social media , there are tens of people who are acci@@ dental to share the water around a tragedy . &quot;
&quot; this mood of mis@@ - and false information suggests that actual atro@@ cities are un@@ true and the actual horror of what is actually happening in the DR Congo , Nigeria and Myanmar ? &quot;
the spread of violent images has already been deb@@ ated extensively ( here for example ) .
&quot; one argument is that ref@@ using images of a ref@@ usal to acknowledge the tragedy , and sometimes these images are even demanded by the victims themselves . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , the concern that for@@ ci@@ ble images readers and viewers are des@@ en@@ si@@ tiz@@ ing and taking them the ability to feel emp@@ athy ( such as this study , which examined how violent media work to help others ) . &quot;
&quot; while there is a lot to discuss about violent represent@@ ations in the news media , there is fact that they are indispensable for today &apos;s news reporting . &quot;
&quot; techn@@ ologists experim@@ enting with algorithms to support the fight against &quot; &quot; F@@ ake News &quot; . &quot; they will have to think thoroughly about the situation in which a picture suggests something , which can actually be replaced by the context or completely ab@@ used . &quot;
&quot; however , each examination of false al@@ ten@@ ders should also take into account how international they can be . &quot;

the &quot; Un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able &quot; Blog reveals the uniqu@@ eness of smaller languages
photo by Andy S@@ imm@@ ons used in accordance with CC BY @-@ ND 2.0 license .
&quot; a blog with the name Un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able ( e.g. un@@ matched ) endeav@@ ors to offer language enthusiasts a selection of words from all over the world , which are difficult or not to translate . &quot;
such words are in every language : they express certain situations or feelings that are often very complex or specific .
some of these conf@@ using words are already well @-@ known today ( such as the famous Portuguese aci@@ dic ) and others that are deeply rooted in a special culture ( for example the Spanish so@@ bre@@ mes@@ a ) .
but they all resist stu@@ b@@ born every attempt of a simple translation .
&quot; a word or expression is not enough , why a full explanation and sometimes something context is necessary to understand exactly what is meant by this one word . &quot;
these unique words have been collected in an online list for a whole time .
&quot; most of these lists cover Japanese , German , French , Portuguese or Finnish words , while the author and lingu@@ ist of &quot; Un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able &quot; Steven Bird decided to focus on small languages . &quot;
&quot; in the blog you can find for example words from the Mw@@ ot@@ lap language of Van@@ u@@ atu , such as : &quot;
v@@ ak@@ ast@@ eg@@ lo@@ k - settle for your parents in recognition of how to keep you in your younger years .
&quot; words in the H@@ uns@@ rik language spoken in parts of Brazil , such as : &quot;
k@@ w@@ adi &quot; - The convenience or la@@ zin@@ ess you feel after having been war@@ med in the sun during the cold days .
in Birds own words from his blog About :
&quot; they emp@@ ower other cultures , reveal other thoughts and ar@@ ouse our curiosity . &quot;
&quot; sometimes you influence how we analyze the world around us and classi@@ fy the lingu@@ ists on this site even more of these &quot; conf@@ using words , &quot; and show how different , valuable and impres@@ sively these small languages are . &quot;
&quot; speakers of the &quot; &quot; Treasure Langu@@ ages &quot; &quot; that are highly appreciated by Un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able are invited to upload their favorite words here . &quot;

how Sri Lanka is dealing with the worst flood disaster of the decade
the island state of Sri Lanka is currently facing the worst flood and floo@@ ds in this decade .
&quot; triggered by the mon@@ soon , which normally starts at the end of May , the rivers Kal@@ u , Kel@@ ani , G@@ in , Nil@@ wal@@ a and At@@ tan@@ ag@@ al@@ u O@@ ya joined the banks in 15 districts in the south and west of the country . &quot;
&quot; according to a statement by the Sri L@@ ank@@ an event of 28 May 2017 , 126 people were killed and nearly hundreds of people are missing because of the floo@@ ds and mud camps . &quot;
more than 400 000 people have been affected since last Friday ( 26 May ) and approximately 100 000 people have been brought to 304 safe places .
&quot; the ra@@ inf@@ alls left on Saturday ( May 27 ) , and the floo@@ ds in some areas went slowly . &quot;
health and hygiene levels of the population represent a massive challenge in the affected and still in@@ accessible areas .
the following pictures and videos convey an impression of the extent of the flood disaster :
flood in Ta@@ wal@@ ama town with water levels of up to 7.5 meters . Twitter users like A@@ zz@@ am A@@ me@@ en and Sri Lanka twe@@ et deliver regular updates to flood life .
many use the h@@ ash@@ tag # F@@ loo@@ d@@ SL to monitor the extent of the catastrophe .
Sri Lanka &apos;s deadly floo@@ ds wor@@ sen the Den@@ gu@@ e@@ fi@@ eb@@ erk@@ crisis war@@ ns Save the Children after further ra@@ inf@@ alls are already on their way .
&quot; today the nel@@ u@@ wa bus stood in high water , water level up to 6 meters . village Mor@@ ago@@ da near G@@ alle also floo@@ ded because of the water peg@@ yl@@ ons of Mor@@ og@@ oda El@@ a . &quot;
the Air Force has provided five planes for rescue operations and further five are completed for the transport of emergency supplies for the residents included in their floo@@ ded villages .
various organizations and startups have also developed to help .
Facebook pages such as Help Flo@@ od Vic@@ tims in Sri Lanka and 2017 Dis@@ aster Relief - Information Des@@ k@@ - Sri Lanka provide important information on flood situation and humanitarian assistance .
&quot; if any search and rescue teams require dr@@ ones for their operations , please call the number 0@@ 77@@ 48@@ 4@@ 46@@ 39 . &quot;
for all who want to don@@ ate dry food and life @-@ necessary goods for flood victims -
we are today in the area around Kel@@ eni@@ ya and Him@@ but@@ ana .
please call the number 0@@ 77@@ 74@@ 49@@ 7@@ 29 or 0@@ 77@@ 78@@ 4@@ 38@@ 41 if animals need help in this area .
the Tax@@ ir@@ u@@ f @-@ App Pick@@ Me ( Sri Lanka ) asks people to share their location data with the help of the app so that the Kat@@ ast@@ oph@@ ile is informed .
&quot; last year after the disaster of the tropical storm Ro@@ an@@ u , Pick@@ Me introduced a &quot; flood aid &quot; button that allowed users to call a vehicle for the pick up of assistance and donations . &quot;
&quot; they also introduced a &quot; SOS &quot; button , which resulted in more than thousands of requests and 150 successful bo@@ ating actions for flood and land@@ slide people . &quot;
&quot; the combined efforts of the government and the civilian population of Sri Lanka , where several social media platforms are fully exploited , bring residents in need of security and provide assistance . &quot;
&quot; this has prevented the loss of further human life , whereby the population of Sri Lanka is now the long way to restore norm@@ ality . &quot;

&quot; we are in a sea of umbr@@ ellas and people , some keep the icon@@ ic picture of a woman with head@@ scarf high , bound from an American flag , others sk@@ ol@@ ding slo@@ gans against anti @-@ Islam hos@@ tility . &quot;
&quot; my girl@@ friend looks at me and says , &quot; &quot; These things do not concern you , or ? &quot; &quot; why , because I am not Muslim ? &quot; &quot; I ask . &quot;
I have already guided this conversation .
&quot; people with whom I work or people who have known me for years - the Sah@@ ar , whom they know - from the widespread concept of &quot; Muslims , &quot; which has built up in their conception . &quot;
they rep@@ licate me .
there are 1.7 billion Muslims around the world .
we do not see all the same .
we practice our religion differently .
&quot; we identify ourselves to be a Muslim , in different ways . but somehow we are all infected in the same Muslim drawer . &quot;
&quot; this drawer is so well constructed in our collective idea that as soon as Muslims , as I do not fit there , are ab@@ sent . &quot;
to be mus@@ li@@ mis@@ ed
I don &apos;t stand alone with it .
&quot; this is even the poet , whose poetry is most sold in America : Rum@@ i . &quot;
which images come to mind when you think of him ?
love ?
peace ?
&quot; as I was now , Jal@@ alu@@ d@@ din Rum@@ i was as old as I am now , he was an Orthodox mus@@ li@@ mic pre@@ acher and schol@@ ar . &quot;
&quot; Islam , the Quran and Prophet Muhammad were up to the day when he died , the centre of his poetry . &quot;
&quot; but in Western conception , the religion of Rum@@ is was extingu@@ ished , as is the most popular translations of his poetry . &quot;
this del@@ eting makes a large part of the history of the 1.7 billion Muslims of this world .
another is in the reduc@@ tion@@ ist images of Muslims who have been colon@@ ising Western books for centuries .
this entic@@ ing image language is determined by the dark man that you should fear and the exotic woman you should save .
the ground@@ breaking Palestinian @-@ American scientist Edward S@@ aid dis@@ assembled the story behind these pictures in the 1970s .
but these pictures also rise further today .
&quot; our politicians , the news industry and Hollywood continue to ste@@ al them . &quot;
&quot; I worked in the news industry for thir@@ teen years , and I saw how this powerful , flaw@@ ed narrative domin@@ ate our news@@ feeds . &quot;
&quot; this Nar@@ r@@ ative over@@ shadows the reality , which in the last three decades had led nine Muslim women to their countries , while the US could not even choose their first female presidential candidate . &quot;
&quot; this narrative fails to acknowledge that if French , Muslim women are prevented from wearing their head@@ scarf in public buildings and to cover Saudi Arabia , Muslim women by their government to cover their entire body , which are both sides of the same coin . &quot;
a powerful group exercises its &quot; control &quot; on the &quot; other . &quot;
&quot; this strong nar@@ rowing weak@@ ens Muslim women , the movements for change . &quot;
&quot; it also sees that the first Muslim prayers were spoken on American soil by Afri@@ cans , who were brought here with slave ships . &quot;
it delet@@ es the existence of que@@ er @-@ Muslims .
&quot; this narrative has so deeply and er@@ ron@@ eous our collective imagination , that often Si@@ kh @-@ men and children become the target of anti @-@ Muslim attacks and chic@@ an@@ ings . &quot;
&quot; because of these stories we tell and because of the way we tell them , Islam@@ opho@@ bia is not just fear of Islam , religion , but it is fear of the &quot; others . &quot; &quot;
among the 1.7 billion belong
in the news industry we do more than telling stories based on facts .
or on alternative facts .
we also create fol@@ r@@ atives that help us to understand the world .
and my industry has failed to capture the narrative of the 1.7 billion .
&quot; and we are here , where seven million Muslims constitute the highest degree of &quot; &quot; diverse &quot; &quot; religious group in America . &quot;
more than one third of the entire Muslim population is African @-@ American Americans .
&quot; six out of ten American Muslims are among the immigrants of the first generation , coming from 77 countries . &quot;
the author &apos;s parents in 1976 in New York .
use approved .
four decades ago my immig@@ rated parents came to New York to live their American dream .
&quot; my mother laid her first jewelry design on 5th Avenue and my father worked hard in the sky@@ sc@@ rap@@ ers of New York ; sky@@ sc@@ rap@@ ers were made possible by the Muslim , American St@@ ati@@ ker from Bangladesh with the name Faz@@ l@@ ur Rah@@ man Khan . &quot;
&quot; at that time when Khan was re@@ thinking the sky@@ lines of the world , my parents were innocent Muslims and Americans . &quot;
but am I now innocent Muslims and Americans ?
&quot; sometimes people ask me why I don &apos;t eat pork meat , I say - instead of bringing out my Muslim recipes or wearing my hand@@ some hand@@ ker@@ chiefs that all Muslims carry with themselves - &quot; &quot; out of respect for Pep@@ pa W@@ utz . &quot;
&quot; I jo@@ king , we do not carry all of the hand@@ ker@@ chiefs with us . &quot;
we must also be not the@@ ological experts to be &quot; Muslim &quot; or to be selected almost always for additional security checks at the airport .
&quot; there are hundreds of outstanding Muslim scholars , Muslim activists and inter@@ religious activists who try to fight widespread lies about Islam . &quot;
&quot; these lies are produced in the current band from a well @-@ lubric@@ ated Islam@@ opho@@ bes@@ disorder with don@@ ors , think tanks and experts for false information , which is our already faul@@ ty image of what a Muslim is ; or what Islam is , manipul@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; because of the stories we tell and because of the way we tell them , Islam hos@@ tility in more than just a stranger , who r@@ ents a woman the head@@ scarf . &quot;
&quot; or as the frigh@@ tening map of attacks on mos@@ ques throughout the USA , see below . &quot;

Islam hos@@ tility in its ug@@ ly forms acc@@ esses our affili@@ ation .
&quot; it attacks our identity , which is so expan@@ sive , so versatile and complex that it is impossible to fit into a drawer . &quot;

I would like to explain that .
&quot; I was born as a Muslim , but to be a Muslim first was born into my imagination when I was four years old , in a provis@@ ional mos@@ que in the basement of a pres@@ by@@ ter@@ ian church in New York . &quot;
&quot; if social scientists describe religious life , they return to the following terms : faith , behavior and affili@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; my Muslim faith and behavior may not always be visible , but they are there . &quot;
&quot; maybe my girl@@ friend , my neigh@@ bor , my neigh@@ bor , my rock in the br@@ anding view that I am Muslims if they could look through the 15 meters of concrete and air that separate our houses . &quot;
&quot; she would see the nigh@@ tly ritual with my daughter , when I wi@@ eld her in my arms and whis@@ per her the Arabic verses to protect the Kor@@ an and called the Q@@ ul@@ s . &quot;
each of them I repeat three times .
&quot; I ask that they are protected from evil , the evil one can see and the evil one cannot see . &quot;
&quot; my Muslim faith may not always be visible , but my Muslim affili@@ ation is always part of my shadow . &quot;

&quot; belonging to my grand@@ mother , belonging to her sisters , is the picture of my grand@@ mother with her sisters , how she won a contest of the art of the flower arrangement in Kar@@ achi two decades ago . &quot;
&quot; it is the picture of her that I can see at this moment when I close my eyes : Nano , surrounded by her completed and un@@ finished paintings painted Su@@ fi saint ; and a Qur &apos;@@ an with many book@@ marks , a book with one hundred and fourteen chapters , which she can almost mem@@ ori@@ ze . &quot;
to be Muslims means to speak the prayers they had said to me when I have a bad day .
&quot; being Muslims is how they taught me to refer to God : Allah Mi@@ an , what God means , my only Lord . &quot;
&quot; for a nation that has been colon@@ ised through a &quot; Empire &quot; through a &quot; Empire , &quot; which was founded by a company called Hon@@ worthy Bri@@ tische Ost@@ ini@@ dien Kom@@ pan@@ ie , it has a deep meaning to call God my only master . &quot;
the author in 1987 with her grand@@ father .
use approved .
&quot; belonging to this means to grow up and hear that men do not cry , but at the same time to see that my acc@@ laimed grand@@ father we@@ pt . &quot;
&quot; in between , while he writes books on modern Islam and the independence of K@@ ash@@ mir , N@@ ana J@@ aan we@@ pt around his family in India ruled by K@@ ash@@ mir , family , which he could not close to his arms in half a century . &quot;
&quot; belonging to this is to know that there are millions of Kur@@ ds and Palestinians whose families , as with my grand@@ father , were torn apart by col@@ oni@@ alists who have divided the Muslim world as at the game risk . &quot;
&quot; to be Muslim means knowing that over the last two centuries Europeans have all &quot; &quot; col@@ oni@@ alized &quot; &quot; all up to four Muslim countries . &quot;
it means knowing that the first pilot bomb of history was rejected by a Muslim country a century ago .
&quot; it means knowing that at the same time the grand@@ father of my grand@@ mother , an Indian , k@@ asch@@ mir tan of the British empire , was referred to as &quot; dangerous &quot; by the newspapers of his time as he was the first mos@@ que in England . &quot;
&quot; before there were planes , he travelled to more parts of the world when I was ever and preached the radical word of love , peace and social justice . &quot;

&quot; to my Muslim tribe of the 1.7 billion , go back deeply into our unforgettable family trees ; our un@@ restricted history . &quot;
&quot; it means remember@@ ing that fourteen years ago , the most powerful military in the world , with troops distributed over every continent apart from the Ant@@ arc@@ tic , went to Iraq to hunt mass destruction weapons that did not exist . &quot;
it means knowing that more than half million Ira@@ q@@ is buried under the ruins of war .
to be an American Muslim means knowing that the su@@ icide rate among veter@@ ans has increased by more than 32 per cent since 2001 .
&quot; it means knowing that when a tragedy is ha@@ unted by the United States and the susp@@ ect bears a Muslim name , history is reported four times more than a story with a white attack . &quot;
&quot; it means knowing that four hundred years ago , the first prayer call , the Az@@ aan , was called by a liber@@ ated black slave named Bil@@ al . &quot;
&quot; it means knowing that two hundred years ago , an African Islamic schol@@ ar named Bil@@ ali Muhammad was ens@@ l@@ aved and brought to this country . &quot;
it means name Mal@@ col@@ m X to name an American hero .
it is the warmth that I feel as humans filled the airports to fight against Muslim be@@ ep .
it is the hope that I feel when we stand up for our dreams and when we say black life .
&quot; being an American , a Pak@@ ist@@ ani , a P@@ ah@@ ari , a P@@ ah@@ ari , a Pun@@ j@@ abi , a Muslim and a journalist means the inherent inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality of our identi@@ ties acci@@ dentally , but to fail to communicate them to others . &quot;
&quot; the narrative of the 1.7 billion contains more possibilities than a magic cube , but it is represented in the reduced ambig@@ u@@ ity &quot; &quot; we &quot; &quot; against &quot; them . &quot; &quot;
&quot; being a mother means to care for my child and all Muslim children , knowing that powerful and privileged persons set up structural Islam@@ opho@@ bia on this ambig@@ u@@ ity . &quot;
structural anti @-@ Islam hos@@ tility exists in Muslim societies that began with President Bush and were wi@@ dened under President Obama .
it consists of continuous monitoring of mos@@ ques .
it consists in the immigration officer who takes a five year old child in hand@@ cu@@ ffs .
it is in a country that exclu@@ des its borders against people from just countries that are bombar@@ ded .
&quot; it is a false and ne@@ bul@@ ous &quot; no @-@ fly @-@ list , &quot; which largely accepts Arabs and Muslims . &quot;
&quot; it is the wars that we carry and the bombs , which we reject in Muslim countries . &quot;
&quot; because of the stories we tell and because of those we do not tell , we are here today . &quot;
&quot; in a study entitled Asc@@ ent of Man , scientists of North@@ western University showed a scienti@@ fic@@ ally in@@ accurate picture and asked them to judge groups on a scale ranging from 1 to 100 concerning evolution . &quot;
Muslims received the lowest score .
the conversations we have to carry out
we are too deep to enth@@ use the Muslim or the &quot; others . &quot;
we are decades back to recognise the roots of our fears and the faul@@ ty and dangerous expressions that we ste@@ al in our news editors .
&quot; at least there is a growing movement , led by American Muslims within the media industry , trying to capture our multiple identi@@ ties and forgotten history . &quot;
&quot; Pod@@ cast Lake Som@@ e@@ thing , S@@ ay Som@@ e@@ thing by Bu@@ zz@@ feed ; the vir@@ ale video series Secret Li@@ ves of Muslims ; Sap@@ elo Square over black , American Muslims ; Simon &amp; amp ; Schu@@ ster Sal@@ am Re@@ ads , Muslim , American super@@ hero - all this makes me hope . &quot;

but I am concerned with this difficult global time point in which we are .
and this moment has consequences beyond the 1.7 billion .
there is one reason that conspir@@ acy the@@ or@@ ists who existed in the dark corners of the Internet now lead the White House .
&quot; they have grown expon@@ enti@@ ally , because they have made Muslims &quot; others . &quot; &quot;
&quot; there is another group that has grown expon@@ enti@@ ally by creating the &quot; &quot; other &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; a few years before , they had not yet given them ; now they domin@@ ate large areas in Syria and Iraq . &quot;
&quot; I am concerned about the realities and the history , which I was not aware of when I was so old , as it was my daughter now , but who made me a non @-@ embrac@@ ed Muslim today . &quot;
things I left here like a bread@@ cru@@ m@@ b in my speech .
&quot; things that perhaps ar@@ ouse memories , as in all the inter@@ sections which our humanity makes , a story may lie where someone is made to another . &quot;
&quot; right now , at the other side of the bridge in Berkeley Con@@ vers@@ ations take place within the 8th Annual Conference on Islam hos@@ tility . &quot;
&quot; more than a hundred ac@@ adem@@ ics speak about our problems with the &quot; &quot; other &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; structural rac@@ ism &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; American militar@@ ism . &quot; &quot; &quot;

we all need to ask ourselves why ?
&quot; why do I tell this here at this TE@@ D@@ x Talk 2017 in Stan@@ ford , where Edward S@@ aid , the man who has shown us how wars are being led and people were enth@@ ron@@ ed by the creation of the &quot; other &quot; in public performance , four decades ago himself scientist of Stan@@ ford . &quot;
&quot; we have to ask ourselves uncomfortable questions about the role of it , consciously and un@@ consciously to consoli@@ date the &quot; other , &quot; as my girl@@ friend and I have been bombar@@ ded in the rain during the Women &apos;s March , as we have no President , while he has already broken countries and &quot; to others &quot; made &quot; people bom@@ bed , &quot; goes far beyond the visible and invisible 1.7 billion . &quot;
it starts here with all of us .
initiative for narrative art aims to preserve urban diversity
&quot; story story , by Fli@@ ck@@ r @-@ User Daniele Rossi , using the CC BY @-@ NC @-@ ND 2.0 license . &quot;
can there be a possibility to connect here and now in spite of a language barrier with someone ?
&quot; Steven Bird and Rob@@ yn Perry , founder of the Treasure Language Stor@@ yt@@ elling ( T@@ LS ) initiative , is the counting of stories in their original language a possible answer . &quot;
&quot; global Vo@@ ices reported recently about another initiative of Steven Bird , the insur@@ moun@@ table blog . &quot;
&quot; here , however , the focus of T@@ LS is not on the written word but on the spoken word . it is an attempt to preserve and appreciate the diversity of language from major cities . &quot;
&quot; in fact , in urban areas such as Melbourne and Darwin in Australia or O@@ ak@@ land in the United States , where T@@ LS has held events since 2015 , the risk that small and not quite so small languages are not passed on to the children born there . &quot;
for the makers of the project :
the mass ext@@ inction of the languages of the world can be avoided when we create cities that accept diversity - safe spaces where inhabitants don &apos;t have to forget who they are to belong to .
&quot; while listening is often associated with understanding , &quot; &quot; these events &quot; &quot; rather &quot; &quot; listen to &quot; &quot; the listening to feel , to feel . &quot;
in this format stor@@ yt@@ ellers first introduce their history in their own language and translate or explain it in English .
&quot; even though the participants are not professional stor@@ yt@@ ellers , their devot@@ ion and their presentation lead to the fact that the list@@ ener can take care of it . &quot;
they evoke laughter and emotions as if the language is no longer a barrier .
&quot; the following video shows , for example , a traditional story from Burkina Faso , which is told in the language D@@ af@@ ing . during this round , the stor@@ yt@@ eller Ras@@ si@@ dat@@ ou Kon@@ ate takes the opportunity to explain the traditions typical for their country . &quot;
&quot; in another event , John Ny@@ am@@ us@@ ara tells the F@@ abel of the Has@@ en and the P@@ avian in the language of Sh@@ ona from Zimbabwe : &quot;
&quot; after explaining the meaning of his be@@ ak , John Ny@@ am@@ us@@ ara is asked : &quot; how is it to speak to an audience that doesn &apos;t understand your language ? &quot; with a wide gr@@ in he shares his feeling of inclu@@ si@@ veness : &quot;
they have listened !
they were attentive ...
they were with me !
&quot; to date , the events of Treasure Language Stor@@ yt@@ elling have taken place in three cities , and the organizers hope to extend this . all those who are inspired by the project can contact T@@ LS to organize their own history stories . &quot;
Puerto Rico calls for the United States re @-@ establishment of public debt
&quot; with the aim of a new checking out of the public debt of Puerto Rico , which amounted to 72 million US dollars , the march started at the capital Capit@@ ol , the government building of the capital , and went up to the Plaza de Col@@ ón in the old town of San Ju@@ an . &quot;

this is their requirement :
&quot; the people of Puerto Rico require the politicians , bank@@ ers and government agencies responsible for debt , for their corruption . &quot;
&quot; we ask for a financial review and a Ste@@ ering Committee without personal interests in public debt , with a firm , our working conditions corresponding remun@@ eration , which acts in favour of the economy . &quot;
we will be pressed and supp@@ ressed .

&quot; the Syrian @-@ Palestinian web developer Bass@@ el Kh@@ art@@ ab@@ il , also known as Bass@@ el Saf@@ adi , has been missing for over a year . &quot;
but he is not forgotten .
&quot; more than five years after he was arrested by the Syrian regime , his supporters and members continue the campaign for his freedom and recall the contributions he made for an open net . &quot;
&quot; at this year &apos;s re : Publi@@ ca , the annual conference on digital culture , hosted in Berlin , an event dedicated to the # Free@@ Bass@@ el campaign . &quot;
&quot; Mé@@ lan@@ ie D@@ ul@@ ong de Ros@@ n@@ ay , a scientist of the CN@@ RS Institute for Communication Sciences , and Barbara R@@ üh@@ ling , a publisher of book Spr@@ ints , a publisher of book Spr@@ ints , a publisher of the book Cost of Freedom : a Coll@@ ective In@@ quiry ( The Cost of Freedom : a collective research ) . &quot;
&quot; the book published last year and is licensed under licence , contains a number of articles dealing with the free culture in the face of oppression . &quot;
it is a tribute to Bass@@ el and his work .
in the introduction it is called :
this book would like to discuss how movements are built for free knowledge and what are the real costs associated with .
&quot; activists , artists , designers , developers , researchers and authors who are involved in the movements for free knowledge , have worked on page to find out about the fog that surro@@ unds our news@@ feeds and to create something meaningful from our different experiences . &quot;
&quot; this book is an attempt to free Bass@@ el Kh@@ art@@ ab@@ il , the beloved and acc@@ laimed Internet volunteers who have been det@@ ained in Syria since 15 March 2012 . &quot;
his name was removed from the directory of the A@@ dra prison where he sat on 3 October 2015 .
&quot; since then , we have no information about his current state or residence . &quot;
&quot; the introduc@@ tory part of his book with the title collective memory gives his friends and family a voice that wants to release his release and who want to know him back in his normal life and in freedom , and immediately . &quot;
&quot; seeing how Bass@@ el pays a high price for his participation in a free culture , many of us have let us start thinking about their own dest@@ in@@ ies , actions and decisions . &quot;
why are we here today ?
what did we choose ?
what have we given up in this process of sometimes extreme beliefs ?
the web developer for open source and digital assets has been in the custo@@ dy of Syrian government authorities since March 2012 .
&quot; in October 2015 Bass@@ el from the A@@ dra prison , a non @-@ military institution , was transferred to an unknown location . &quot;
&quot; his wife , the writer and lawyer N@@ our@@ a G@@ haz@@ i , reported that the &quot; Military Police Bass@@ el had taken on the basis of a &quot; strictly secret &quot; command of the military court from his cell in A@@ dra . &quot;
&quot; G@@ haz@@ i reported that she was contacted by persons on 12 November 2015 , who presented themselves as in@@ si@@ ders of the Assad administration and informed them of an alleged death sentence against her husband . &quot;
&quot; however , his place of stay and state remain unknown . &quot;
&quot; a pioneer of creative comm@@ ons in Syria and actively involved in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia , Bass@@ el played a crucial role in expanding access to the Internet and knowledge for the public in Syria . &quot;
&quot; Barry Thre@@ w , a designer , techn@@ ologist and currently the director of New Pal@@ my@@ ra , a project that founded Bass@@ el , writes on pages 10 and 11 of the book : &quot;
&quot; perhaps none of Bas@@ sels was more predic@@ table than the work that he began with a group of archae@@ ologists and 3D artists around 2005 , to virtually reconstructed the ancient ruins of Pal@@ my@@ ra . &quot;
&quot; Pal@@ my@@ ra , one of the most important archaeological sites in the world , was the cross@@ roads of numerous civi@@ liz@@ ations and here mer@@ ging Greek @-@ Roman architectural types with local traditions and Persian influences . &quot;
&quot; at that time Bass@@ el was not able to know that ten years after he began working with this work , the IS would put all this architecture , which is not only em@@ bodied by the cultural heritage of Sy@@ s@@ ri@@ ens but of the world . &quot;
this strip in digital archae@@ ology and conservation has created a time capsule that will be in@@ valuable to the public as well as for scientists and artists in the future .
&quot; sorry , there is no translation for this news @-@ article . &quot;
N@@ our@@ a G@@ haz@@ i also contributed to the book and writes about the passion of her husband to share his knowledge with others even during his time in j@@ ail :
&quot; I spent my entire life with it , dre@@ aming of freedom and b@@ ass@@ el taught me to embrace them . &quot;
I am overwhel@@ med when I call his name .
Bass@@ el taught me English even when he was in det@@ ention .
&quot; I learned to read , write and speak English well . &quot;
he has always shared his knowledge with everyone who asked . he has taught other prisoners to read and speak English .
Bass@@ el opened the door to technology . he taught me to use both computers and smartphones .
he brought me the internet .
&quot; he taught other prisoners how they use computers , at least theore@@ tically , without actually holding one in their hands . &quot;
&quot; G@@ haz@@ i is also the author of Wa@@ iting ( War@@ ten ) , a Pro@@ sab@@ uch that she wrote in the years 2012 to 2015 , when he was in custo@@ dy . &quot;
Bass@@ el and N@@ our@@ a worked together in the book for a year .
&quot; she sm@@ ug@@ gled the lyrics to him , when she visited him and he translated it from Arabic into English . &quot;
the book is freely available .
book cover from Y@@ ous@@ se@@ f Ab@@ dal@@ ki .

here is an excerpt from the book of Nor@@ a with the title &quot; It happens &quot; :
&quot; it happens during each visit , &quot;
that I sink in the world of your lovely eyes
that I lose my mind at the moment in which we embrace
that I don &apos;t care about any of the dangers
&quot; each of the f@@ ences , sh@@ ackl@@ es and guards &quot;
I forget the j@@ ail of the prison
&quot; and I put in every detail of your voice , and my words &quot;
which I wear with passion with me
when your eyes f@@ are@@ well
and I will leave another piece of my soul with you ...
I quickly return to my lon@@ el@@ iness ;
to rec@@ laim all the moments
and about your absence to cry and smile .
I testify to myself that I will return soon ...
G@@ haz@@ i wrote on the first anniversary of the imprisonment of Bass@@ el :
&quot; one year passes , my soul &quot;

&quot; I in your cage , &quot;
and you are still In the cage of monsters
Bas@@ sels story is not unique in Syria .
&quot; since the beginning of the protests in 2011 against the Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad regime , more than 6@@ 5,000 people have disappeared according to the Syrian Network for Human Rights ( Syrian Network for Human Rights ) . &quot;
those who were arrested or disappeared under violence by the regime were tor@@ tured or even executed .
&quot; until 2016 , according to the international human rights organisation Am@@ ne@@ sty International has died at least 17.@@ 7@@ 23 Syri@@ ans in custo@@ dy since 2011 . &quot;
the stories of many other people remain unknown .
the Global Vo@@ ices community has been calling for the release of Bass@@ el since 2012 .
we repeat our call today in the hope we have to do so for the last time .
Moz@@ ambi@@ que : due to corruption convic@@ ted director after release of det@@ ention again on previous post
&quot; Moz@@ ambi@@ que re@@ acted with anger against a corruption incident , where a member of the government returned to the workplace in the state apparatus , where corruption was committed . &quot;
&quot; this is Di@@ od@@ ino Cam@@ b@@ aza , which was arrested in 2008 and was sentenced to 22 years in prison together with four other def@@ end@@ ants due to the un@@ tre@@ ati@@ fication of 54 million Me@@ tik@@ al ( about 800 000 euros ) . &quot;
&quot; the money came from public funds from the airports of Moz@@ ambi@@ que , whose council stood at Cam@@ b@@ aza between 2005 and 2008 . &quot;
&quot; Cam@@ b@@ aza was released in 2016 because of good leadership and immediately called for his return to the company , which happened on 19 April . &quot;
&quot; in accordance with an opinion of the Republic &apos;s At@@ tor@@ ney General , who evaluated the application , there would be no obstacle to Cam@@ b@@ aza , again to refer to his old posts , since the company did not carry out any disciplinary approach after his det@@ ention . &quot;
&quot; however , many inhabitants do not call the action well . &quot;
&quot; the Centre for Public Integr@@ ity ( Centro de Int@@ eg@@ ri@@ da@@ de P@@ ú@@ bli@@ ca , short C@@ IP ) , a local institution that advoc@@ ates public transparency in an interview with the Deutsche Welle , condemned the decision of the company to restore the director : &quot;
&quot; represents a set@@ back in the fight against corruption and illustrates the lack of transparency , and is even a back@@ step with regard to the efforts of our legal system , so the C@@ IP . &quot;
what we are aware of is that the company should also introduce a disciplinary approach against the conflic@@ ting question .
&quot; however , the company apparently did not show reasonable legal steps for the application of the corresponding functions . &quot;
&quot; Eg@@ í@@ dio V@@ az , an important voice in the Moz@@ ambi@@ que social media , also rejected this behaviour and considers the case as &quot; &quot; disgu@@ sting &quot; &quot; : &quot;
&quot; if Cam@@ b@@ aza would be a competent type , he would be advis@@ er after he was sentenced to a prison sentence and half of them had lo@@ wered . &quot;
&quot; he could hold paid lectures and motiv@@ ating speeches , he could advise and polish his image . &quot;
&quot; but since he is in@@ competent , he has cons@@ ented to be re@@ integrated into the company , which he helped to inf@@ lict damage . &quot;
therefore it is obvious : Cam@@ b@@ aza is gladly paid for his silence .
disgu@@ sting !
&quot; Bit@@ one Vi@@ age , young Moz@@ ambi@@ que and student of political science in Brazil says the director has no moral : &quot;
&quot; Cam@@ b@@ aza is rewarded by the state because he insul@@ ted him , I cannot believe that one reward someone in such a way that has already insul@@ ted the state . &quot;
&quot; Cam@@ b@@ aza is missing mor@@ ality to return and serve the state , * he already had a unique opportunity to serve the state , but instead only served by the state . &quot;
&quot; Cam@@ b@@ aza had used the state as hand@@ ing it for an in@@ exhaus@@ tible source of money , and the state itself became tired of this man who was pr@@ elo@@ aded and finally sentenced to a long prison term . &quot;
&quot; hon@@ estly , I don &apos;t know why this man was so rewarded . &quot;
&quot; Fran@@ c@@ ey Ze@@ ú@@ te pre@@ fers to remind the Prime Minister of Moz@@ ambi@@ que , Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el to remind that a th@@ ief is in prison : &quot;
&quot; thi@@ eves belong to the prison of Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el , not only to remain remembered as the first independent president , but also as a sharp , one @-@ t@@ apping and - inci@@ dentally - proph@@ etic speaker . &quot;
&quot; one of his most famous oral presentations was when he confirmed that &quot; an ambitious person is capable of all , even the fa@@ ther@@ land for his ambi@@ tions , his own individual interest to sell . &quot;
&quot; Sam@@ ora also said , &quot; I don &apos;t know if an ambitious person changes , my experience shows that it is not so . he changes tactics , but he does not turn away from his ambi@@ tions . &quot;
an ambitious human being is crimin@@ ally at the same time . &quot;
&quot; in Twitter , the reactions were also similar : &quot;
&quot; Cam@@ b@@ aza was sentenced to 22 years in prison , he sat 10 years and was free . &quot;
&quot; and today , the company , with which he promised money , is again under contract . # As@@ sim@@ V@@ ai@@ OM@@ eu@@ Pa@@ is - Agrit@@ echni@@ ka ( @ az@@ mal _ Raf@@ ik ) 12th May 2017 &quot;

Facebook blocks the rac@@ ist word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; in Myanmar and cens@@ ored many users wron@@ g@@ ly
the Bur@@ m@@ ese word &quot; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &quot; means chick@@ pe@@ as or spl@@ its .

&quot; according to Facebook users in Myanmar , the well @-@ known social network took their posts from the net because they contained the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; . &quot;
&quot; although the origin of the word is still being discussed , it is usually used to refer to people of East @-@ Indian origin or generally used as ad@@ j@@ ective &quot; Indian . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Facebook cens@@ ored the word &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; Second &quot; &quot; ( in Bur@@ m@@ ese script ) as part of an initiative to tackle the widespread problem of hate speech in Burma in the social network . &quot;
&quot; in recent years , the rise of radical nation@@ alist movements gave the word an extremely ab@@ sent con@@ notation . &quot;
&quot; in particular , it is a word that is mostly used by ultra @-@ nation@@ alists as hate speech against Muslims who represent a minority of the population in Myanmar . &quot;
&quot; but in the effort to fight hate speech in Myanmar , the company has cens@@ ored a lot of meaningful content on its platform . &quot;
&quot; Kal@@ ar &apos;s may normally be associated with rac@@ ism , but the word itself does not automatically generate hate speech . &quot;
&quot; the context is important &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; many people have reported that even posts , in which they have discussed the use of the word , have been cens@@ ored for their use . &quot;
&quot; moreover , there are several Bur@@ m@@ ese words with basic mean@@ ings that have the same letter as &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; . &quot;
&quot; for example , chair is written on Bur@@ m@@ isch also &apos; Kal@@ ar h@@ ta@@ ing &apos; , which contains the same letters as well as other words like &apos; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &apos; ( spl@@ itting b@@ ens ) , &apos; Kal@@ ar O@@ AT &apos; ( cam@@ el ) or &apos; kal@@ ar@@ ka@@ ar &apos; ( curtain ) . &quot;
the Fac@@ ebook@@ user A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at explained the various mean@@ ings of words with the sound of &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; :
a post of one of my friends was deleted today because he contained the word Kal@@ ar .
&quot; however , he had asked his friends in a spiritual way whether they knew how to alle@@ vi@@ ate his back pain by making a word play . &quot;
&quot; the phrase ku la - &quot; &quot; He@@ aling &quot; &quot; ( a ) + the question word ( la ) in Bur@@ m@@ ese - resem@@ bles the rac@@ ist expression very , but the context is completely different . &quot;
there were different reactions to the initiative of Facebook .
&quot; Z@@ in Win H@@ tet is the opinion that she will l@@ essen the hate speech of radical nation@@ alists , but also emphas@@ ised that Facebook should be more analytical before it dis@@ sol@@ ves all posts that were suspected to dis@@ semin@@ ate rac@@ ism . &quot;
Facebook does not delete the word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; manually .
it automatically filters the word automatically .
the automati@@ sm will not understand what you write on Fac@@ ob@@ ook .
&quot; what it should do instead , is to carefully analyze the post and check it by checking the words by the next . &quot;
&quot; for example , &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar H@@ t@@ ine &quot; &quot; ( chair ) and &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the good is that these dirty nation@@ alists , who spread hate speech , receive a pretty good lesson . &quot;
now it is time to circum@@ cise their nation@@ alism .
&quot; while the action may send a strong signal to everyone who dis@@ semin@@ ates hate speech , the efficiency of this strategy may not stop long . &quot;
&quot; the experiences of social networks in China such as S@@ ina Wei@@ bo and We@@ Chat have proven that the cens@@ or@@ ship of keywords often becomes a cat and mouse game , whereby the users of social networks simply will start using a new word or alternative sp@@ elling of cens@@ ored word to express their views . &quot;
&quot; the author ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at described how Facebook began to delete his posts , when he wanted to tell his friends only that the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; is ban@@ ished from the social network : &quot;
&quot; when I was aware of this new policy of Facebook , I made a post to tell my Facebook friends that the word is locked . &quot;
&quot; iron@@ ically , my post was removed from Facebook and I was told the li@@ ken , post and parts of content for 24 hours because the post &quot; &quot; Facebook Community Standards refused . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Facebook has a variety of posts from people who do not have any negative intentions or who simply try to show their opinion against the hate speech of radical nation@@ alists .
Patrick Mur@@ phy wrote that his post was removed who has nothing to do with hate speech :
post without hate speech from Facebook .
&quot; in the post , the author shared his opinion about why extreme nation@@ alism and religious fundament@@ alism in the country are bad . &quot;
&quot; Ch@@ an My@@ ae Kh@@ ine believes that Facebook should have done more before the start of the initiative , for example the Bur@@ m@@ ese Internet community to ask advice : &quot;
&quot; Facebook may have a ben@@ evol@@ ent intention to l@@ essen rac@@ ism in Burma through its platform , but it does not work . &quot;
cens@@ or@@ ship such words will only bring more hatred within the different communities .
&quot; in addition , it seems as if they have started this without local context or technical support , and as words like &quot; &quot; chair &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; pe@@ as curr@@ y &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; even when they found that they made mistakes , they did not try to correct the wron@@ g@@ ly deleted posts . &quot;
&quot; if they had only a little more respect for the 15 million benefits they had a big turnover , that would be great . &quot;
lap@@ tops automatic cens@@ or@@ ship ensured a lot of ridi@@ cu@@ le amongst users .
&quot; instead of taking it seriously , users now make fun via Facebook and consciously write the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; not in the context of hate speech to see if their posts are taken from the net . &quot;
&quot; here you can see some screen@@ shots of Facebook posts that have no hate speech contained , but still removed : &quot;
used with permission .
the Bur@@ m@@ ese text is &quot; I want to sit on a chair and eat pe@@ as curr@@ y and watch an Indian film .
just to try out whether Facebook removes the mail containing the word Kal@@ ar .

&quot; the mail says &quot; If you are a doctor , do you cure people ? &quot;
screen@@ shot used with permission .
&quot; in the past five years , extreme nation@@ alist ide@@ ologies and religious fundament@@ alists who have used social networks to expand their voices and their influence . &quot;
&quot; among other things , hate speech in social networks should additionally heat violence in the communities in Myanmar , especially in Rak@@ h@@ ine area , where disputes between Muslims and Budd@@ hi@@ sts have forced thousands to flee . &quot;
Facebook was cri@@ tici@@ zed for his failure to bring out the balancing hate speech on his Bur@@ m@@ ese sides .
&quot; but instead of just cens@@ oring the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; , it would have been better running , more focused on context than on code concentr@@ ating initiatives and learned from them . &quot;

the child marriage is now illeg@@ ally illegal in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago .
&quot; on 9 June 2017 , Parliament of the country unanim@@ ously approved a law to prohi@@ bit this practice , so that the age @-@ capable age is 18 . &quot;
&quot; at that time , Brother Har@@ ry@@ pers@@ ad Mahar@@ aj , the leader of the Inter@@ religious Organisation ( IR@@ O ) , a group representing representatives of the various religious groups of the country , said that the state should not be interfer@@ ed , since that , age does not determine maturity . &quot;
&quot; this happened in spite of the fact that Trinidad and Tob@@ ago is a contract partner of the United Nations Children &apos;s Rights Convention , the min@@ ors as , , every person under 18 years . &quot;
&quot; statistics of the UN for the years 2002 @-@ 2012 indicate that the proportion of children , who were already married in 15 , was 2.8 percent in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago , and with 18 were 8.1 percent . &quot;
&quot; in 2011 , the State Statistical Office confirmed that more than 8@@ 400 girls and 1300 boys were married to 19 in 1997 @-@ 2007 . &quot;
&quot; online peti@@ tions and social media movements that were anx@@ ious to abol@@ ish laws for chil@@ d@@ birth , followed at the foot and gr@@ ati@@ fying themselves great support . without doubt , they helped to bring about this result . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , not everything went smoothly . &quot;
&quot; for example , a Hind@@ u leader , for example , had no concerns to tell the critics of the children &apos;s marriage , they should , condemned to take care of their own affairs . &quot;
&quot; this kind of religious opposition provided tensions in this really un@@ complicated thing , and at some point there were doubts as to whether the opposition would agree to the bill at all . &quot;
&quot; but at the beginning of 2017 , the draft law was decided against the child &apos;s marriage - despite 4 sen@@ ators ( including a woman ) of the opposition and an independent , which could be discussed in the House of Represent@@ atives , where a simple majority would make him a law . &quot;
now only the President of the country must agree and announce the law .
one of the country &apos;s sen@@ ators posted a status update on Facebook which posted Les@@ lie @-@ Ann Bo@@ is@@ elle on Inst@@ agram :
Mr. Sen@@ ator Clar@@ ence Ram@@ b@@ har@@ at : the bill against the child marriage was voted in the House of Represent@@ atives with 35 votes for this and not one single against it .
&quot; after having previously decided in the Senate , the draft can now become a law . &quot;
the majority of the social media users was thr@@ illed because the laws were finally changed to the child before .
&quot; Facebook member Lov@@ ell Francis , who suff@@ ers a minist@@ erial post in the Ministry of Education , said : &quot;
&quot; it has needed too much time and unnecessary talk , which conce@@ als the core of the matter , but do you know what ? the child marriage is now illegal in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago , and that &apos;s almost every price . &quot;
&quot; while Abel Jackson thought it was definitely long enough to abol@@ ish the practice , L@@ ara Qu@@ entr@@ all @-@ Thomas was over@@ jo@@ yed that the day was finally come : &quot;
&quot; public status update on Facebook from L@@ ara Qu@@ entr@@ all@@ - Thomas , which states : , , Excellent News ! &quot;
the E@@ H@@ eg@@ es@@ etz has been decided .
&quot; minimum age - 18 , Vo@@ ices - 35 - 0 on the other ! ! ! ! &quot;
&quot; Fol@@ ade Mut@@ ota , which belongs to the Women &apos;s Institute for Alternative Development ( WIN@@ AD ) , a civil society group that openly spoke about how important the adoption of the law was , noted : &quot;
the marriage @-@ capable age in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago is now independent of the religious affili@@ ation 18 years .
&quot; the draft for amend@@ ment of the sp@@ ouses was decided today , on 9 June 2017 . &quot;
there are 41 members of the House of Represent@@ atives and 35 were present at the vote .
all de@@ pu@@ ties voted against have voted for the law .
the child marriage is legally no longer allowed in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago .
it was a long battle ( ... ) # chil@@ d@@ marri@@ ag@@ ei@@ dab@@ use .
many thanks to all activists who have challenged him .

a thanks to our de@@ pu@@ ties .
&quot; but a possible catch comes in the form of Sat Mahar@@ aj therefore , the Secretary @-@ General of San@@ atan D@@ har@@ ma Mah@@ a Sab@@ ha , the most famous Hind@@ u organisation of the country . &quot;
&quot; months ago Mahar@@ aj proc@@ laim@@ s his intention to take judicial steps , should the law be passed , and he seems to be able to rede@@ em his promise . &quot;
&quot; during the General At@@ tor@@ ney General Paris Al ra@@ wi , a pro@@ pon@@ ent of the law , said it was quite legitimate , if Mahar@@ aj would advance against the law , most social media users wished to deal with the debate on the subject . &quot;
Patricia Wor@@ rell defeated :
&quot; dear Sat , if we , instead of talking about the discussion as general , in a way that can only evoke panic and dis@@ grace , that the state , our daughters against them , would be ab@@ used , &quot; would you then be ready to continue the discussion ? &quot;
or do you think it is not a problem ?
&quot; however , whether it comes to a judicial action against the law or not , this legislation is an important step - however , there are still places in the world where the children are legally or still the norm , although there are laws that prohi@@ bit them . &quot;
h@@ acker Tro@@ l@@ les the Office of the Prosec@@ utor in front of country @-@ wide protests at the Russian National Day
screen printing of the message posted on Sunday early on the website of the Public Prosec@@ utor of the Yar@@ os@@ lav@@ l district .
&quot; on the eve of national demonstrations against corruption , which coinci@@ des with the day of Russia - the Russian national holiday - the website of the Public Prosec@@ utor of Yar@@ os@@ lav@@ l was h@@ acked . h@@ ackers have left a funny message &quot; &quot; Stay at home &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; or we bring you into the cr@@ ast instead of Dim@@ on . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the h@@ acker posted the YouTube video &quot; He is not a Dim@@ on for you &quot; on the Public Prosec@@ utor &apos;s website with the following comment : &quot; &quot; the Office of the Prosec@@ utor does not call on the citizens to follow the pro@@ vocation and keep away from all non @-@ sanc@@ tioned events ! &quot;
&quot; at 11.15 , the message was removed from the side - but in the interim storage it remained . &quot;
it is # gently van@@ ished
&quot; on Sunday , the Office of the Prosec@@ utor informed the local news service Yar@@ News that they were h@@ acked . &quot;
&quot; through the mirrors of web pages , Turkish users can view Wikipedia content again &quot;
&quot; the Wikipedia page was published on January 18 , 2012 , contrary to the SO@@ PA ( Stop Online Privacy Act ) and P@@ IP@@ A copyright legislation in the USA , internationally dark@@ ened . &quot;
created by Wikipedia ( CC BY @-@ SA 3.0 )
&quot; for more than a month , Turkey has now blocked the popular and crow@@ d@@ sourcing principle based enc@@ y@@ clo@@ pedia Wikipedia . &quot;
&quot; day by day , it becomes clear@@ er how important the platform for users is to find and share useful information as well as reliable information . &quot;
both students and repor@@ ters and fans of TV series defend themselves against blocking .
&quot; although many technologies @-@ based Internet users are acc@@ u@@ stom@@ ed to using conversion tools for blocked sites ( an actual article from the New York Times reported that Turkey has the third largest VPN pre@@ val@@ ence in the world ) , most ordinary Wikipedia users do not fall into this category . &quot;
&quot; although Turkey has been publishing articles from Wikipedia as recently in a published report by Ber@@ k@@ man Klein Center for Internet &amp; amp ; Society at Harvard University , regular block@@ ages of the internet have been held since 2007 after the Internet Act ( No. 56@@ 51 ) was adopted . &quot;
&quot; according to China , Turkey is the most known country in the world when it comes to the massive cens@@ or@@ ship of Wikipedia . &quot;
&quot; while the platform remains locked , there are now several mir@@ ror@@ sides ( pages that reflect the contents of Wikipedia and frequently updated ) . &quot;
&quot; a solution came from IP@@ FS ( Inter@@ planetary File System ) , as the platform used all Turkish Wikipedia sites on its de@@ centralized pe@@ er @-@ to @-@ pe@@ er network ( i.e. host computer connections ) , which is not based on the system of domain names and thus makes a complete cens@@ or@@ ship difficult . &quot;

a Nep@@ al@@ ese wildlife photographer uses his camera to draw attention to the need for nature conservation
&quot; a su@@ hl@@ y r@@ hin@@ o@@ cer@@ os , Ch@@ it@@ wan . &quot;
photo of Sag@@ ar Gir@@ i .
with permission .
Sag@@ ar Gir@@ i was never satisfied with the photos he saw around him . they were bl@@ urred with badly positioned motifs and washed colours .
this motivated him to carry a camera and try to commit the situation .
at that time he was still a child .
&quot; today , at the age of 28 , Sag@@ ar , N@@ ept@@ une , endeav@@ ours to bring Nepal to the international stage . &quot;
&quot; his hom@@ etown right next to the Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , offers him the perfect opportunity to shoot photos that draw attention to Nepal &apos;s wildlife . &quot;
he described Facebook as this first @-@ class situation in his work helps :
&quot; I live at the edge of Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , a world natural heritage . what could be better for a passionate game wildlife photographer ! ! &quot;
I just rested at home when suddenly re @-@ inv@@ oked Navar@@ re ( the manager of Ch@@ it@@ wan G@@ aida Lodge ) . he had received a call from my father that on the banks of the Rap@@ ti river would be a le@@ op@@ ard .
the river dam is only a few minutes away from the tourist resort of Sau@@ ra@@ ha .
immediately I ran away with my camera and was there in a few minutes .
&quot; my father observed him and showed me the place on the other river side , where the le@@ op@@ ard was and I immediately began to cr@@ ashing pictures ! ! &quot;
Sag@@ ar seeks to cooperate with the authorities in order to gain global recognition for Nepal &apos;s nature and would like to deep@@ en the understanding that wild animals are not so frigh@@ tening as they look .
&quot; and he should know it , for he stood opposite to Tig@@ ers face to face : &quot;
a tiger can not be bot@@ her@@ ed by the opinion of the sheep when sleeping ! !
late in the evening . the light is too weak .
sleeping time for all animals and birds .
&quot; also , because of the darkness on the way home , when suddenly the king of the bu@@ ke appeared . he immediately starts to see us and he star@@ es me through the S@@ al trees ! ! &quot;
&quot; to promote the protection of wild animals , Sag@@ ar placed the logo &quot; &quot; I click for conservation &quot; &quot; ( lit . : I click for environmental protection ) on his photos . &quot;
&quot; however , his passion for the promotion of Nep@@ ali nature and wildlife is not always easy . &quot;
he waited for 22 days and mostly lived in a tent to take photographs of Ot@@ tern in the Bar@@ dia National Park . up to 12 days it took until he could photograph a tiger and six to seven days for the perfect photo of birds that live near the tourist accommodations .
see some of these photos below .

&quot; this post was written by Kay@@ on@@ a@@ az K@@ aly@@ an@@ wal@@ a and originally appeared on Video Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers , an award @-@ winning international community media organization from India . &quot;
a revised version has been published here as part of a content sharing agreement .
&quot; in many parts of India , women have the greatest care to prono@@ unce the name of their hus@@ bands or even older men in the family . &quot;
instead they use a prono@@ uns or say &quot; father of my child . &quot;
&quot; from Ch@@ hat@@ tis@@ gar@@ h to Mahar@@ ash@@ tra and U@@ tt@@ ar Pra@@ des@@ h women give women to respect the husband because of their social pressure , as well as fear of the consequences they should dis@@ regard the norm to get this practice alive . &quot;
&quot; last year , Mal@@ ati Mah@@ at@@ oto was convic@@ ted of the Indian state of O@@ dish@@ a by a court court and viol@@ ated by her family and the village community after she had addressed a married relative with names . &quot;
&quot; the tradition of its wives also does not give name to the name , is also widespread among men . however , they have far fewer assur@@ ances to fear , if at all , they should not follow this practice . &quot;
&quot; in the small village of Wal@@ he in the district of P@@ une , in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra , nine women , including health personnel as well as house@@ wives , a unique club and were thus quickly became the main theme of the city . &quot;
it is a place only for them alone in which they can discuss and discuss the intri@@ c@@ acies of the Patri@@ arch@@ ate .
&quot; as one of 56 clubs in 13 Indian states , he is part of the campaign # K@@ hel@@ Bad@@ al , which is operated by the Community Video Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers and sett@@ les for the exploitation of the patri@@ archy . &quot;
Roh@@ ini Pa@@ ola has been working with her video camera for seven years with the help of her video camera on the discovery of practices such as child marriage and the exile of HI@@ V@@ - and AIDS @-@ infected .
it reports how these clubs have created a safe place for these women and at the same time made them amb@@ ass@@ ad@@ ors of change .
&quot; the first video that Roh@@ ini showed in her discussion round , acted by women who did not call her hus@@ bands by name . &quot;
she chose this subject because she wanted to talk about the patri@@ archy with a problem with which women can easily identify .
&quot; the name of their hus@@ bands does not speak out loud , is a custom that they all maintain and never ques@@ tioned . &quot;
Roh@@ ini says :
this tradition testi@@ fies that a woman respects her husband and wishes him a long life .
a woman who does not stop this will be considered as c@@ unning as woman without mor@@ als .
tradition is so deeply rooted that we have never thought about this discussion .
&quot; at the beginning , Roh@@ ini , who had never called her husband by name , wanted to try out at home , as it is running . &quot;
she showed the video of the discussion round her husband and her mother @-@ in @-@ law .
Roh@@ ini says :
my mother @-@ in @-@ law and my husband still silent after the video was over .
&quot; Prak@@ ash , my husband , turned to me and said I should call him from now on his name . &quot;
&quot; with this self @-@ confidence in the luggage , Roh@@ ini started their first discussion club . &quot;
&quot; many women had never heard the word &quot; patri@@ archy &quot; before . some believed that it was a good thing , because it meant that the younger members of a family , especially girls and women , would be protected . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the round , Roh@@ ini showed a video about the problem in U@@ tt@@ ar Pra@@ des@@ h . &quot;
&quot; after the video projection , the women tried to get the discussion with an exercise . &quot;
&quot; Roh@@ ini asked each participant to say the name of her husband with different feelings - happy , angry , sad , loving and so on . &quot;
&quot; then they all asked , &quot; &quot; If we cannot tell the name of our hus@@ bands , but they can call us how they want it means that they do not respect us ? &quot;
should it not be equivalent ? &quot;
&quot; some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day when they brought the name of her hus@@ bands on their lips , &quot; &quot; says Roh@@ ini Pa@@ war of the village of Wal@@ he in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra on the breaking of an age @-@ old tradition in which married women should never prono@@ unce the name of her hus@@ bands . &quot;
Roh@@ ini says :
&quot; a woman was so shy that during the whole exercise , she was just before him , and another decided to release the whole fru@@ stration against him and his family by cur@@ sing him . &quot;
the expression on their faces was ec@@ static .
I think I will never forget it again .
&quot; even in the adren@@ alin rush to have broken with an ancient custom , the women decided that they would actually try to name their hus@@ bands in the name . &quot;
and they kept their word .
&quot; in the next few days , Roh@@ ini received a variety of reports . &quot;
the husband of a woman called Roh@@ ini and asked what ideas she put the women in her head : his wife couldn &apos;t stop saying his name .
another club member decided to do it for dinner in front of the whole family .
&quot; when her mother @-@ in @-@ law she star@@ ed , she got scar@@ ed and said that it was a mistake . &quot;
another woman said : &quot; Roh@@ ini said I should do it . &quot;
a husband of a participant was less understanding and the situation art@@ ed in violence .
&quot; Roh@@ ini reports how women have tried to stop other practices , such as wearing the cin@@ no@@ ber@@ red dot on the foreh@@ ead , indicating the Eh@@ est@@ atus : &quot;
why only women have to show that they are married ?
&quot; I said to my husband , that I would wear the cin@@ no@@ ber@@ red point if he did it . &quot;
he laugh@@ ed only and I stopped wearing it .
&quot; the other women did not completely listen to it , but think they are now in a better position to choose not to wear it on some days . &quot;
&quot; for many women , the discussion club is a safe place where they can exchange their opinions and goals . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we make a trip for every deb@@ ating club . &quot;
normally we pack lunch and water and go out to the field .
&quot; I don &apos;t want the women to worry about who could hear something , &quot; she says . &quot;
during the last months she celebrated her own birth@@ days with cakes for the first time in her life ; she d@@ anced and sang about things that she never thought about before .
Roh@@ ini says :
&quot; I have been working on these problems for so many years and yet I also have talked about some things , for example how our identi@@ ties are linked to our hus@@ bands , have never been so honest . &quot;
&quot; it feels great to be able to say certain things loud , no matter how small they occur . &quot;
in a discussion round we talked about the concept of honor and how it is connected to the clothing .
some women in the group have only supported Sar@@ is since their marriage .
&quot; for most of them this is okay , but some wanted to wear a sal@@ a @-@ c@@ ta , a wide shirt over a pants , they have not dar@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; after much dispute and discussion about the advantages of their own han@@ di@@ cap , mor@@ ality connected with the sar@@ is and much more , Roh@@ ini sm@@ ug@@ gled her own couple of Kur@@ tas ( upper hem@@ den ) into a discussion round , so that the women could carry them . &quot;
&quot; next , they decided to plan a trip to Go@@ a in which they can wear jeans and Roh@@ ini is confident that they will succeed . &quot;
&quot; on the question of whether in the five months since its first discussion club has changed something , Roh@@ ini confirms that things are slowly coming into play : &quot;
we have only made small steps so far .
&quot; some women tried it a few times , but then stopped to say the name of her husband . &quot;
&quot; some , including me , make it yet , but only if they are alone and not other family members . &quot;
only one or two continues to say the name of their hus@@ bands ; only one or two women are now wearing Zin@@ no@@ ber@@ rot on their foreh@@ ead at any time .
the women in the discussion club know that the changes they want to achieve in their lives - such as catching up more freedom of movement or choice - at the end of a difficult navig@@ ating river .
&quot; by giving each other self @-@ confidence , they are aware that they are sitting in the same boat . &quot;
how Roh@@ ini declares :
each of us is a victim of the patri@@ archy .
I am also .
but this club gives each of us the confidence that something will change .
and I know that it is not limited to 30 families . there will be a chain reaction when every woman goes home in the club and told other people about what we are talking about and what we do .
we all sit in the same boat .

the Beat@@ les at their landing in Japan .
screen@@ shot of the official YouTube channel of the Beat@@ les .
&quot; on June 29 of this year , the H@@ ash@@ tag was to be found in the japan@@ ese Twitter trend , with which many fans exchanged memories and shared their appreciation for the Beat@@ les . &quot;
the visit to the Beat@@ les in 1966 in Japan is considered a revers@@ al in the Japanese culture of the post @-@ war period .
&quot; the first Japanese journalist , Hos@@ hi@@ ka Rum@@ iko , who inter@@ viewed the Beat@@ les 1964 in London , marked the 50@@ th anniversary of the first visit : &quot;
&quot; for just about five days , the Beat@@ les were in the country , but this was enough to let the Japanese go through . &quot;
the people here are quite quickly clear that they had no choice but to receive the Beat@@ les with open arms .
many well @-@ known Japanese sizes had reached its zen@@ ith when the Beat@@ les came to Japan for the first time in 1966 .
&quot; the music of the cult band is &quot; more than just a universal language like English , &quot; Ry@@ u@@ ich@@ i Is@@ aka said , President of the retailer Seven &amp; amp ; i Hol@@ dings , the online magazine Nik@@ k@@ ei Asian Review . &quot;
&quot; good morning ! &quot; &quot; Today is the Beat@@ les Memorial Day in Japan . &quot; &quot; -@@ 51 years ago , they were here in Tokyo . &quot;
&quot; also today , songs are sung by the Beat@@ les in Japanese kar@@ a@@ oke bars and in English classes at Japanese mid@@ ges . &quot;
the kit@@ sch of the Beat@@ les survived everything .
today is Beat@@ les Memorial Day .
we all love the Beat@@ les in our house .
I don &apos;t know if this &quot; W@@ inn@@ ie the P@@ oo@@ h &quot; doll should represent John L@@ enn@@ on or not .
&quot; and as it belongs to fans , Japanese naturally also make pilgri@@ m@@ ages to the well @-@ known places associated with the band . &quot;
&quot; if you love the Beat@@ les , this is your 5 places you absolutely need to visit ! &quot;
1 ) Abbey Road
2 ) Math@@ ew Street ( in Liverpool )
3 ) Stra@@ w@@ berry F@@ ields ( memorial in New York )
4 ) P@@ enny Lane
&quot; 5 ) ( From link ) The Beat@@ les Story ( Museum ) , Liverpool &quot;
pilgri@@ m@@ ages can sometimes not be bizar@@ re enough :
good morning together .
today is Beat@@ les Memorial Day .
&quot; exactly today in 1966 , the Beat@@ les came to Japan the first time . &quot;
the characters from the movie K @-@ On ! arose on a pilgrimage to London and ran over the Abbey Road .
the same we did last year .
&quot; and of course , some companies also use the fan community , such as this R@@ amen @-@ Shop ( R@@ amen are Japanese no@@ od@@ les ) in Tokyo . &quot;
&quot; good morning , here is Mut@@ ah@@ iro Ko@@ ya R@@ amen ! - Today is Beat@@ les Memorial Day . &quot;

&quot; a new system of kid@@ n@@ apping of gl@@ atz@@ kö@@ ping people for the organ trade , presum@@ ably for super@@ sti@@ tious purposes , distur@@ bing the police of Z@@ amb@@ é@@ zia , a province in Moz@@ ambi@@ que . the local government now called a number of operations to stop the practice . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the month , three men were killed in the region of Mil@@ k , a few kilometers from the border to Malawi . &quot;
one of the victims was found be@@ headed and part of the organs had been taken out .
two men were arrested and subsequently they conf@@ essed that the organs of sham@@ ans in Tanzania and Malawi were used .
&quot; there is the local super@@ sti@@ tion that the head of a man of Gl@@ atz@@ kö@@ p@@ man could carry out gold stays or wealth , the police spokes@@ man of Z@@ amb@@ é@@ zia declared the BBC . &quot;
it is the first time that succ@@ essive attacks on gl@@ atz@@ kö@@ pf@@ ige men were registered in Moz@@ ambi@@ que .
&quot; another group , the goal of murder trials for obsc@@ ure purposes , are people with al@@ bin@@ ism . &quot;
this led to a mission in the South African country to investigate this practice in the South African country .
&quot; the persecution of people with al@@ bin@@ ism is common in other countries of southern Africa , especially in neighbouring Tanzania where the government developed campaigns to fight this super@@ sti@@ tion and pre@@ judi@@ ces . &quot;
U@@ kom@@ be We@@ ya lives in the city of Map@@ uto .
he warned those who plan to travel to the country :
&quot; attention to k@@ ah@@ le men who travel to Moz@@ ambi@@ que are target ritual attacks , warned the mos@@ ambi@@ que police after the latest assass@@ inations of three Gl@@ atz@@ kö@@ p@@ frequent men due to their body parts . &quot;
&quot; two susp@@ ects were arrested in the district of Mil@@ ange , where the assass@@ inations took place . &quot;
&quot; Hus@@ sen@@ e Al@@ gy Ad@@ amo , student and inhabitants of the city of In@@ ham@@ bane in the south of Moz@@ ambi@@ que , said that the local police are already following the case : &quot;
PR@@ M believes that the sham@@ ans are involved in the death of the Gl@@ atz@@ kö@@ ping men .
&quot; the persecution and murder of Gl@@ atz@@ kö@@ p@@ ige individuals for the extraction and sale of their organs in the district of Mor@@ ru@@ mb@@ ala , for presum@@ ably super@@ sti@@ tious ritu@@ als , has commissioned the police of the Republic of Moz@@ ambi@@ que ( PR@@ M ) , which also indicates that a belief existed , according to which the victims were in the head of power , the riches . &quot;
&quot; in recent days , three men with hair loss problems were murdered in this part of the country . &quot;
Angela Fer@@ rei@@ ra Sam@@ an@@ tha told Facebook the chron@@ icles of the blog@@ gers poor Sn@@ ai@@ pp@@ a who suggested that the problem is part of the bigger social difficulty facing Moz@@ ambi@@ que :
&quot; I would like to urge E@@ IN MO@@ SAM@@ BI@@ K , TH@@ AT SI@@ CH , a country where people would have shame to go on the streets , or even take their lives to get their bread , a country where neither the Al@@ bin@@ os nor bald for super@@ sti@@ tious purposes or &quot; &quot; black magic &quot; &quot; are hun@@ ted to reach their own wealth . &quot;

&quot; free Bass@@ el : Ne@@ ti@@ zen Under Seri@@ ous Thre@@ at , December 2012 ( in English ) New reactions of the international community for the medical treatment of Nobel Prize winners and Dis@@ sident Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o &quot;
&quot; a photo by Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o and Li@@ u X@@ ia , probably just recently made . &quot;
&quot; this story was originally published on July 8 , 2017 at Hong Kong Free Press . &quot;
the following version will be published as part of a partnership agreement via Global Vo@@ ices .
the case of the im@@ pris@@ oned Chinese Dis@@ sident Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o has attracted attention in the international community after his lawyer had announced at the end of June that he had been admitted to hospital for liver cancer at the end of June .
&quot; in 2009 , Li@@ u was sentenced to eleven years in prison for &quot; Subversion &quot; ( state endanger@@ ing ) after being involved in the draft of the Charter 08 , a manifest@@ o that demanded the democratic reforms in China . &quot;
he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010 .
&quot; the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in China referred to Li@@ us case as an &quot; &quot; internal matter &quot; &quot; and tells a spokes@@ man , he did not consider it as &quot; &quot; not necessary to discuss this thing with any other country . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , China continues to release calls from the international community , the Nobel Prize winner and his wife , poet Li@@ u X@@ ia , or permit him to be treated abroad . &quot;
&quot; while some countries have critic@@ ised the strict treatment of the couple in Beijing , others are completely wi@@ ped out of the subject . &quot;
Hong Kong Free Press has summar@@ ised some reactions from abroad .
United Nations
&quot; Zei@@ d R@@ a @-@ ad al @-@ Hussein , the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights , met Chinese officials at the end of June to discuss the case of Li@@ u . &quot;
&quot; however , a spokes@@ man refused to comment whether the United Nations should exercise pressure to allow Li@@ u abroad to be treated abroad . &quot;
Norway
Norway &apos;s Prime Minister Er@@ na Sol@@ berg and Foreign Minister B@@ ør@@ ge Br@@ ende refused to answer questions about Li@@ us release .
&quot; the relationship between China and Norway gr@@ asp@@ ed after the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to Li@@ u in 2010 , although the Norwegian government told that this was ultimately nothing to do with the decision . &quot;
&quot; diplomatic relations continued until December last year . only in June Norway signed an agreement to res@@ ume the salmon farms to China , as exports since 2010 were largely blocked . &quot;
&quot; after spreading the message that Li@@ u was seriously ill , the Nobel Committee expressed his hope for un@@ conditional release and invited Li@@ u to pick up his prize in Oslo . &quot;
&quot; due to his imprisonment , he was unable to accept his prize . &quot;
during the ceremony Li@@ u was represented by an empty chair .
European Union
&quot; on July 6 , the European Parliament adopted a decision to free Li@@ u and his wife immediately from house arrest and permit him to seek medical support wherever he wants . &quot;
&quot; the top diplom@@ at of the EU , Feder@@ ica Mo@@ gher@@ ini , also called for China to release Li@@ us , as she reported in an explanation on 30 June : &quot;
&quot; at the same time , we expect China to raise all restrictions of Mr. Li@@ us wife and family members . &quot;
&quot; they should meet and receive all visits they desire , and be able to communicate freely with the outside world . &quot;
USA
&quot; U.S. ambassador Terr@@ y Bran@@ stad told him that the Americans would like him to have the possibility of treating abroad , in so far as he could help him with his recovery . &quot;
&quot; a spokes@@ woman in the US emb@@ assy in China , Mary Beth Pol@@ ley , announced that the message agency AF@@ P announced on 27 June that the emb@@ assy asked the Chinese authorities to release not only Li@@ u , but also to free his wife Li@@ u X@@ ia from her house arrest . &quot;
&quot; the invitation of the US emb@@ assy drew a fur@@ ious response from China to itself , with the utter@@ ance of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , that &quot; no country has the right to inter@@ fere in a single and ir@@ responsible statement on Chinese internal affairs . &quot;
Pol@@ ley told us that China should offer the couple the following :
&quot; protection and freedom such as travel freedom and access to the medical care of his choice , which they claim according to the Chinese constitution and legal system , as well as international obligations . &quot;
&quot; the U.S. Sen@@ ators Marco Ru@@ bio , Jeff Merk@@ ley and Ted Cruz launched a decision in Congress to press the Chinese government on it , Li@@ u and his wife un@@ condition@@ ally release . &quot;
&quot; I urge China to release the Nobel Prize W@@ inner # Li@@ u@@ Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o un@@ condition@@ ally , so that he can go to proper medical treatment . http : / / bit.ly / 2@@ t@@ E@@ 6@@ k@@ U@@ o &quot;
Germany
&quot; German government spokes@@ man Steffen Sei@@ bert wrote on July 3 , Berlin , hope that Li@@ u gets all the medical support he needs and that &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; humanitarian solution for Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o should be the highest priority . &quot;
the Chinese President Xi J@@ in@@ ping appeared on the G@@ 20 Summit in Hamburg on 7 and 8 July .
&quot; previously , diplomatic sources reported in Beijing &apos;s news agency Reu@@ ters that China had great concerns if the vor@@ tex could over@@ shadow the visit to Hamburg . &quot;
Canada
&quot; on 28 June , Canadian Ambassador John Mc@@ Call@@ um requested China to provide adequate medical care and give him the opportunity to take care of his family . &quot;
&quot; AF@@ P previously told AF@@ P that Li@@ u &apos;s wife , Li@@ u X@@ ia , could visit him every day , but the police always monitor the room in the hospital and that there is Li@@ u not allowed to talk to someone outside , including his lawyers , to talk and contact . &quot;

&quot; Canada demands China to uph@@ old its international human rights obligations , including freedom of expression , and freedom of expression for the exercise of these rights . &quot;
France
&quot; in an Declaration on 29 June , France &apos;s Department of Foreign Affairs urged China to release Li@@ u for humanitarian reasons : &quot;
&quot; all necessary measures must be taken to ensure that Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o receives all treatments which he , regardless of where , needs . furthermore , his wife and his family should have contact with him . &quot;
&quot; although the news channel France Info already reported that the French government would welcome Li@@ u in the country , the Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced that there is no further information out whether France will eventually record it . &quot;
Taiwan
&quot; the Council of the mainland matters in Taiwan demanded China to release Li@@ u on June 27 , and show a greater tolerance towards those who use peaceful means to demand political reforms and democratic development . &quot;
the Tai@@ wan@@ ese legisl@@ ature Yu M@@ ei @-@ nu by the ruling Democratic Progressive Party also urged China to allow the sick intellectual Li@@ u to be treated in Taiwan .
Dalai Lama
&quot; the spiritual leader in Tibet , the Dalai Lama , was very concerned about Li@@ u in an explanation on June 28 , and gave him that many asked him to pray for Li@@ us well @-@ being . &quot;
he said about Li@@ u :
&quot; it is my belief that the initiatives he took and had been severely punished for which he had been severely punished , to a more harmonious , more stable and prosper@@ ous China , which in turn would have contributed to a more peaceful world . &quot;
&quot; I felt personally very moved and also encouraged when I saw hundreds of Chinese intellectu@@ als and affected citizens , inspired by Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o , who signed Charter 08 , which stands for democracy , freedom and rule of law in China . &quot;
Singapore : city or country ?

is Singapore a city or country ?
&quot; the question may seem stup@@ id@@ ly , as Singapore is recognized on an international level as an independent state . &quot;
&quot; but according to the Minister of Justice K. Shan@@ m@@ ug@@ am , Singapore should be considered as a city . &quot;
this re@@ mark has triggered a debate in the blog@@ osphere .
&quot; during the meeting on the occasion of a meeting of the international branch of the Union of New York , the Minister noted that many people critic@@ ised the domin@@ ance of the only political party of Singapore because they compared Singapore with other countries . &quot;
he supported Singapore as a city .
no one ques@@ tioned whether New York is a democracy ...
this is where most people commit a mistake .
I have tried to explain that we are different .
we are a city .
we are not a country .
&quot; the blog Cav@@ al@@ ier@@ io accused the Minister of Justice to &quot; &quot; turn the logic &quot; &quot; to defend the existing author@@ it@@ arian exercise of power in Singapore . &quot;
&quot; and then , after all our efforts and sacrifices to create this valuable land , we hear that we are ultimately not a country . &quot;
&quot; it so@@ unded so vul@@ gar , it had the appearance of an escape from the responsibilities , a breach of duty . &quot;
&quot; Singapore , if you are not my country , whose land is it then ? &quot;
&quot; the reasons cited by Shan@@ m@@ ug@@ am were not very no@@ bel : he def@@ ended an idea , according to which one could not measure the political system of Singapore with other &quot; normal countries &quot; in the face of that , he inevitably appeared un@@ democratic . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , he def@@ ended the idea that Singapore should be compared to cities such as Chicago , San Francisco or New York , equally cities that are permanently run by a party . &quot;
these cities are democratic .
&quot; as soon as one reaches the core of the subject , the good old bodies of the author@@ it@@ arian rulers appear to be able to be democr@@ ats , leaving the distor@@ ted logic , as they are better suited to their power . &quot;
&quot; in the last week of Shan@@ m@@ ug@@ am , the answers to his American guests regarding our press , our ju@@ dic@@ ative , our political system were really non @-@ answers . &quot;
he would like to have appropriate questions with non @-@ responses of rational nature .
Rachel Z@@ eng invites Shan@@ m@@ ug@@ am to clarify his opinion as they did not understand this conclusion .
I personally find it a bit difficult to swal@@ low .
&quot; when Singapore is not a country , but a city , so to which country belongs to our city ... &quot;
&quot; short , I don &apos;t understand anything . &quot;
&quot; I would be very grateful if our wer@@ ter K Shan@@ m@@ ug@@ am would take the effort to clarify this point , as long as he was paid up to be part of the Government of the city of Singapore . &quot;
&quot; comment@@ ing on his comment on the blog , he pointed out about the criticism that one should start reading the entire participation of the conference , so that one could better understand the context of the statements made by Shan@@ m@@ ug@@ am , according to which Singapore was a city and not a country . &quot;
read the tran@@ scription .
&quot; when he said that Singapore was rather a &quot; city &quot; than a country , &quot; he explained why the Singapore elections were so un@@ ev@@ asive , even if we enjoy free and fair elections . &quot;
he compar@@ es Singapore with cities in the USA ( and how many of these cities have seen a party for decades ? ) .
&quot; when he said , Singapore &quot; was not a country , &quot; he obviously didn &apos;t mean it in this sense ! &quot;
&quot; Cl@@ ement T@@ an shows his dis@@ appointment about Shan@@ m@@ ug@@ am , who is a leader of a growing generation , which makes such a pol@@ em@@ ic statement . &quot;
I am very embarrass@@ ed about what the Minister of Justice of Singapore has said ...
&quot; at least I knew with Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew and the members of the old guard , what awaits me - I agree with them or not , but that is another thing . &quot;
&quot; but with K. Shan@@ m@@ ug@@ am , a member of the new generation of the political leaders of Singapore , I doubt and I am not even sure if he really believes it is true and aware of what he def@@ ends . &quot;
the TE@@ MA@@ SEK Review spl@@ its the weak points of Shan@@ m@@ ug@@ am &apos;s arguments :
did Mr. Shan@@ m@@ ug@@ am committed a mistake or was it a Fre@@ ud@@ scher spokes@@ man ?
&quot; if Singapore is not a country , we are only regarded as an independent and sovereign state ? &quot;
&quot; if not , in which country do the sovereign rights of the city of Singapore go back ? &quot;
&quot; Singapore is unique , it is equally land and city . &quot;
&quot; since he plays an important role in the government cabinet , the statements of Mr. Shan@@ m@@ ug@@ am are of serious importance . &quot;
&quot; why do the people of Singapore afford their military service , do they only defend their city but not their country ? &quot;
who needs to pay back our prime minister invo@@ ices ?
what is the value of our pink identity card ?
are we the citizens of a country or the inhabitants of a city ?
&quot; the magazine Journey of a Dec@@ ade for Be@@ j@@ ah@@ ung , Singapore is and has always been a city : &quot;
I did not say what I said ...
this sentence seems to have anno@@ yed many people of Singapore ...
no one ever said that Singapore is a country .
we were always a city .
we have always been a city / island state .
&quot; I can understand that we often hear statements like &quot; &quot; the defence of the country above all &quot; , &quot; etc . , but that is not quite correct . &quot;
we should rather speak of the defense of the city .
the My@@ th of the &quot; cute Can@@ adi@@ ers &quot;
the Canadian N@@ ed Flanders .
screen@@ shot from a YouTube video .
&quot; recently , Global Vo@@ ices asked about his editors : what is the most mis@@ understood aspect of your home country or homeland ? &quot;
their answers are published here as part of an ongoing series with the ru@@ mo@@ urs covering certain parts of the world and another fac@@ et is to be shown .
&quot; the latest part of this series comes from Nev@@ in Thom@@ p@@ son , editor for Global Vo@@ ices Japan , who lives in Canada and Japan . &quot;
the question I am most asked in Japan is : &quot; are you Americans ? &quot;
&quot; no , I &apos;m sorry , &quot; I answer . &quot; I &apos;m from Canada . &quot; since 1994 I live and back in Japan . &quot;
&quot; depending on what situation the conversation takes place , it is considered cour@@ te@@ ous to show interest in his conversation partner by asking personal questions . &quot;
&quot; my clari@@ fication then follows the default answer : &quot; Oh , Rocky Mountains , ice hock@@ ey , nature . &quot; many can@@ adi@@ ans perhaps cook in@@ war@@ dly with anger , when they are kept for Americans , but I don &apos;t b@@ other me . &quot;
&quot; for someone who doesn &apos;t know himself , there is little one distingu@@ ishes us Canadian from Americans . &quot;
this is one of the reasons why so many Can@@ adi@@ ans get a Canadian flag well visible at their back@@ pack when they travel .
everyone loves Can@@ adi@@ ans .
American on the other hand ... .
&quot; so it was already when I began to travel through the world twenty years ago - before Donald Tru@@ mp , before the invasion of Iraq and before September 11 . &quot;
Can@@ adi@@ ans have always worn small map@@ le leaves on their luggage to distinguish themselves from their American neighbours .
we have a free health care system !
there are no weapons with us !
same @-@ sex marri@@ ages have been legal in Canada since 2005 !
&quot; all seem to think , Canada is so great . &quot;
we are pol@@ ite .
&quot; we obviously say very often &quot; &quot; exc@@ use &quot; . &quot; &quot;
Canada is said to be the most toler@@ ant country against ethnic groups .
we are not as these types south of the border .
we Canadian are nice .
I hate that .
&quot; first , I have many American friends whom I admire very much . &quot;
it wouldn &apos;t matter if you were confused with Johnny from Dallas .
with Marc from Austin .
with Adam from San Francisco .
or with Michael from Hon@@ ol@@ ulu .
but there are also some problems with the stamp &quot; nice . &quot;
&quot; first , being called &quot; nice &quot; means to be idle - just like the ben@@ evol@@ ent , gentle , but trag@@ ically in@@ significant figure N@@ ed Flanders from &quot; Die Simp@@ sons &quot; ( which has its own Canadian Doppel@@ gän@@ ger ) . &quot;
&quot; if Canada really would be a nation full of people like N@@ ed Flanders , this would indeed be a step forward . but the real problem is that &quot; nice &quot; has no personality . &quot;
&quot; there are no ver@@ tices and edges , nothing you can encounter . &quot;
being harmless means being in@@ con@@ spic@@ uous and un@@ interesting and no attention to deserve .
&quot; this can be a good thing if you want to stay un@@ noticed in the background , far away from things that happen around one . &quot;
&quot; I would even go to say that the desire to be free and alone , is a major part of the Canadian . &quot;
we tend to take care of our own affairs only .
&quot; what out@@ si@@ ders call &quot; &quot; nice &quot; &quot; is perhaps just cool courtesy . &quot;
Can@@ adi@@ ans do not often talk about the fence with the neighb@@ ors .
&quot; we lack the warm @-@ heart@@ ed , open kindness , which I now connect with my American friends . &quot;
&quot; fortunately for us ( and for the rest of the world ) Jus@@ tin Tru@@ deau entered the stage to show that Can@@ adi@@ ans are more than just &quot; nice . &quot; our prime minister has made Canada sexy . &quot;
music video of a pop @-@ band par@@ odi@@ ert Thail@@ ands Jun@@ ta
&quot; one in Thailand famous pop @-@ band has released a music video that the Jun@@ ta par@@ odi@@ ert , which seized power in 2014 , and despite its promise to restore the civil government , the country still reig@@ ns . &quot;
&quot; the new song &quot; Dic@@ t@@ ator Girl &quot; ( P@@ ha@@ det Girl ) of the band Tattoo Colour describes a young man who tells him what rules he makes his girl@@ friend .
&quot; although not expressly political , the music video refers indirectly to the continued military rule of the Jun@@ ta . &quot;
the band was praised by many fans and other Internet users for their courage to describe the country &apos;s situation .
the video of the song was a huge success .
&quot; within the first three days , the video uploaded to Facebook was shared 1,@@ 254 times and received 8,@@ 800 Li@@ kes . &quot;
&quot; last month , the Charlie Chap@@ lin video &quot; The Dic@@ t@@ ator &quot; in Thailand was blocked after a group of activists asked the public to watch this video . &quot;
&quot; the video can be interpreted as a creative and entertaining introduction to Thai politics , especially with the situation of the country under the Jun@@ ta reign . &quot;
take a look at these recordings of the video that relate to some of the political topics that Thailand has persist@@ ently pursued over the past three years .
&quot; the &quot; 44 rules of girls &quot; may refer to the dra@@ con@@ ian section 44 of the provis@@ ional Constitution , which gives absolute decision @-@ making authority over important national issues . &quot;
&quot; the 11th rule : &quot; change your attitude &quot; refers to the not@@ orious program for the &quot; setting change &quot; of journalists , students , scientists , activists , politicians and other people who are considered by the Jun@@ ta as critics . &quot;
&quot; the picture above reflects the introduction of the law on computer crimin@@ ality , whose v@@ ague and uncle@@ ar regulations are often exploited by the authorities to arrest activists and other critics of the state . &quot;
&quot; for this purpose a new unit in the army was set up , the online content super@@ vis@@ es and persons accused of being prosec@@ uted , the monarchy is prosec@@ uted , prosec@@ uted . &quot;
Thailand uses a strict programme against &quot; L@@ ese Maj@@ este &quot; ( Maj@@ estic ) .
&quot; on 20 May 2014 , the law was issued in Thailand . &quot;
two days later it came to a coup of the army .
&quot; one of the problems that the Jun@@ ta continues to pursue is their decision to buy expensive sub@@ mar@@ ines , although security experts warned them that the purchase is unnecessary and a waste of tax money . &quot;
&quot; in the video , it is even shown how people are thrown into a black delivery van before putting them into a dormit@@ ory , another problem . &quot;
&quot; some journalists are in prison because they allegedly &quot; &quot; confusion &quot; &quot; caused in society and Internet users are threatened with long term pen@@ alties , they should off@@ end the monarchy . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , the te@@ aser of the song showed members of the band who im@@ pris@@ oned the Sal@@ ut from &quot; The Tri@@ bute von Pan@@ em &quot; who was already used by Put@@ sch opponents during the protests in 2014 . &quot;
life goes on in the ruins of the ghost towns in eastern Ab@@ ch@@ asia

&quot; the following article , written by D@@ mit@@ ri Stat@@ ey@@ nov , was first published on the OC Media website and published here with friendly permission . &quot;
&quot; the post@@ war society reco@@ vers itself very slowly in East Asia Minor , especially in the district of T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al . &quot;
&quot; now more than 20 years have passed since the Georgi@@ an @-@ ab@@ ch@@ as@@ hic war has been officially ended , but its sc@@ ars are still visible in this part of the Republic . &quot;
the abandoned villages of the northern district in T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al show striking pictures .
&quot; villages such as D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha , Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , Py@@ at@@ aya Shak@@ ht@@ a , Poly@@ ana and K@@ har@@ chil@@ ava are located in the coal basin of Ab@@ ch@@ asia . &quot;
&quot; ethnic groups such as Russians , Greeks , explo@@ sives , Georgi@@ ans and Armen@@ ians lived and worked together in the Soviet countries . &quot;
many of them had to leave their houses during the war .
&quot; today , the largest part of Russians and ch@@ ases live in the area . &quot;
such settlements are also called gh@@ ost@@ ages in Ab@@ ch@@ asia .
&quot; in the pre @-@ war period , more than 10,000 people lived here , today there are only a few hundred people living in these ghost towns . &quot;
this phenomenon is characteristic of T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al .
&quot; since 2011 , the total population of the district amounted to 16@@ ,000 people , after barely a decade . &quot;
&quot; in 1989 , about 43@@ .000 people lived in this district . &quot;

&quot; all this is a consequence of war &quot;
&quot; the empty five @-@ storey blocks of the Soviet Union from the early 1960s , called K@@ hr@@ us@@ h@@ k@@ kov@@ kas , stand symbo@@ lic@@ ally for the decline and devast@@ ation of the region . &quot;
the buildings are fallen and very rare they are inhabited by more than two families .

at the entrance of the village D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha I met a native older man .
he starts talking and it is difficult to finish this .
&quot; all this is a consequence of the war . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; can I talk to you ? &quot; &quot; why talk ? &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , it is unique . &quot;
before the war the village was full of life .
&quot; there were communal centres , schools and kinder@@ gart@@ ens , which served all of the community . &quot;
now there is only paved road with burnt splend@@ or buildings .
the people who once lived on this place and made their contribution to the central economy of the Soviet Union have left the district .
&quot; in the ghost town of D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha , about fifty inhabitants live . &quot;
&quot; about 38 people live in Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , in the other villages it looks similar . &quot;
&quot; the K@@ hr@@ us@@ h@@ ka kas , which still accommodate one or two families , can be seen at the balconies , where laundry is dried . &quot;
&quot; two young girls , both seven years old , look out of the window of a destroyed home . &quot;
&quot; when they discover me with the camera in the hand , they immediately withdraw . &quot;
&quot; our mother has forbidden us to take pictures , &quot; &quot; says one of the girls . &quot;
&quot; why ? &quot; &quot; it is simply forbidden to us , that &apos;s all . &quot;
the girl whis@@ pers her girl@@ friend something and suddenly she leaves the destroyed building and disappear .
many people in the area work for a small Turkish mining company called T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al@@ ug@@ ol .
&quot; families are also involved in the sub@@ sist@@ ence economy ( cultivation of agricultural products for self @-@ consumption ) , such as cattle breeding , be@@ eke@@ eping and vegetable cultivation . &quot;
it is difficult to get over the l@@ aps .
&quot; in winter , the district administration provides free candles and bread to the villages . &quot;

&quot; I don &apos;t know what will happen , but we will build cour@@ get@@ tes &quot;
&quot; about ten years ago an older woman named Gal@@ ina ( or T@@ ante GAL@@ Y@@ A , as it is called in the neighborhood ) from Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a to Dsch@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha . &quot;
&quot; in spite of her oldest daughter , who lives in France , Gal@@ ina did not leave Ab@@ ch@@ asia to live with her . &quot; my heart will remain forever in Ab@@ ch@@ asia , &quot; she tells . &quot;
Gal@@ ina does not want to receive financial help from her daughter and insist@@ ed that she supported her young grand@@ children instead .
Gal@@ inas monthly pensions are just nine dollars .
&quot; if you have neither a vegetable garden nor a house , it is very difficult to survive , &quot; she adm@@ its . &quot;
aunt GAL@@ Y@@ A tells that she and other vill@@ agers try to meet regularly and celebrate holidays together .

&quot; a 90 @-@ year @-@ old woman and a young family and I live in this building .
&quot; when vac@@ ations are , we visit . &quot;
but we cannot constantly do this - everyone is busy with his own problems . &quot;
&quot; while she tells her story , a younger neigh@@ bor appears on the balcony . &quot;
&quot; Nat@@ ascha , &quot; T@@ ante GAL@@ Y@@ A calls her . &quot; they said we could build cour@@ get@@ tes . &quot;
I have already prepared the ground .
&quot; I don &apos;t know what will happen , but we will build cour@@ get@@ tes . &quot;
&quot; you can get used to everything &quot;
&quot; G@@ aly@@ as convers@@ ant Nat@@ ascha , together with her husband and the five common children , lived in her house for some time . &quot;
Nat@@ ascha was 11 years old when the war began .
every day she rec@@ alls the village life before the war .
&quot; despite the relatives living in central Russia , Os@@ se@@ tia and Georgia ( the country of Ab@@ ch@@ ha@@ zia was simply gone away ) , they did not have the opportunity to leave it . &quot;

&quot; we bought recently land in Su@@ k@@ hum@@ i ( administrative capital in Ab@@ ch@@ asia ) .
&quot; we want to build a house there , but it will take some time , &quot; she explains . &quot;
Nat@@ ascha receives approximately $ 9 children &apos;s money for each child .
her husband works in the coal mine .
the young family has their own farm .
&quot; near the house , where Nat@@ ascha &apos;s kinder@@ garten was once found , they keep pigs , cows , co@@ cks and chick@@ ens . &quot;
it tells us that it was a very frigh@@ tening situation when many people left the village after the war .
but over time she lost her anx@@ ie@@ ties .

&quot; we have no fear of the dark street or the few people .
you can get used to everything .
many people believe that these buildings were destroyed during the war .
&quot; in fact , it has more to do with lo@@ oting . &quot;
after the war there was little work and all lived as it was right .
every day I remember how the city and the war were once .
&quot; when our conversation bows to the end , a small boy runs over us . &quot;
it runs through the window of a destroyed building and hi@@ des itself .
a ball flies out of the window and another boy hun@@ ts him back .
he plays with the ball that rolls up the hill .
a group of children now pursu@@ es the ball .
&quot; while they run , some of them throw stones on the lost buildings . &quot;
these ruins are a part of their childhood who cares for in@@ genu@@ in@@ eness in their lives .

&quot; in Mexico &quot; &quot; Mama Africa &quot; &quot; is home to migrants on their long journey &quot;
&quot; Concep@@ ci@@ ón Gon@@ z@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez leads a small hotel in Tap@@ ach@@ ula , in the state of Chi@@ ap@@ as , at the border of Mexico to Guatemala . &quot;
photo : A@@ my Br@@ acken .
this article by A@@ my Br@@ acken was published on the website of our partner PRI@@ .org on 19 April 2017 and is published here with friendly permission .
&quot; on the way of migrants entering Europe or Latin America , certain places are known for their hospitality . &quot;
&quot; I have visited one of these places in the Mexican town of Tap@@ ach@@ ula , it is located on the border to Guatemala . &quot;
it is a very simple hotel close to the city center .
&quot; it is led by a 59@@ - year @-@ old Mex@@ ic@@ an@@ erin , a small woman with a coral @-@ pink Br@@ illen@@ gestell and gold@@ tone earrings in ted@@ dy bears . &quot;
she is called Concep@@ ci@@ ón Gon@@ z@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez and was born in Tap@@ ach@@ ula and grew up there . nevertheless they know many of the name Mama Africa .
this nick@@ name is the fact that the hotel ( or rather it ) has become a destination for Afri@@ cans and Hai@@ tians who are on transit .
the hotel has no charm .
&quot; for about 2.50 dollars the night sleep the guests in simple rooms , with bare , cru@@ m@@ bling walls and beds made of metal . &quot;
in the anter@@ oom there is a par@@ rot in a cage .
there is no sign to the hotel - anyway hundreds of African and Hai@@ tian migrants come here .
&quot; sometimes , Ms Ram@@ í@@ rez , people in full mini@@ buses and from the upper part of the coast begin to cry out : &quot; Mama Africa ! &quot;
where did you find Mama Africa ? . &quot;
&quot; at the moment , it is rather quiet , but this year Ram@@ í@@ rez has received 200 guests at the same time . &quot;
there are only 24 rooms ; some have also slept on cardboard .
you don &apos;t want to reject anyone .
&quot; she also helps them and brings her to the hospital when she is sick , she bu@@ ys them drugs that they can &apos;t pay , she mass@@ ages them with a bal@@ m that exhausted from the long journey . &quot;
&quot; Ty@@ chi@@ que Sebas@@ ti@@ ao , originally from Angola , has arrived recently . &quot;
I asked him if Mama Africa was a reasonable nick@@ name for Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez .
the Sebas@@ ti@@ ao family ( with her daughter Mer@@ ru@@ i who has a yo@@ gh@@ ur@@ st ) pos@@ ing with Concep@@ ci@@ ón Gon@@ z@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez .
the family came from Angola to Brazil and hopes to go to Boston .
photo : A@@ my Br@@ acken .
&quot; yes , yes , &quot; he replies with a smile . &quot; I really feel that it suits her because African women are very nice women . &quot;
very aff@@ ection@@ ate .
she has the warmth of a mother ...
we feel very comfortable here . &quot;
&quot; Sebas@@ ti@@ ao travels with his sister , who hopes to go to Boston to find her husband and the three children . &quot;
&quot; they have already lived in Brazil , but it is for some Afri@@ cans who are on the way to the United States to make normal a first stop in South America and then move towards north . &quot;
&quot; the family had heard of other companions from Mama Africa . &quot; &quot; Mama Africa is a well @-@ known name on the track , &quot; &quot; explains Felix Michel@@ et , a guest from Haiti . &quot;
he tells us that the Hai@@ tians and the Afri@@ cans are often travelling together and that Afri@@ cans already speak to W@@ hat@@ s@@ app by Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez .
&quot; like many of his companions , Michel@@ et had previously lived in Brazil and worked as a construction worker on building sites of the Olympic Games and the World Cup . &quot;
&quot; when the Brazilian economy was weaker , he began his trip to the United States . &quot;
he has been guest at Mama Africa for months : he sells SIM cards to save the money needed to buy the bus ticket to Ti@@ juana .
I wonder if he will contact Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez in the future .
&quot; Mama Africa is our mother and we never let it go again , &quot; he respon@@ ds sm@@ iling . &quot; we will always stay in touch . &quot;
&quot; Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez tells her guests to send her often text messages when they went to greet her , or to report her about the course of her journey . &quot;
she explains that her Christian faith is the drive of her work .
&quot; she doesn &apos;t know much about Africa , but her guests have taught her to prepare chicken as in Ghana . &quot;
&quot; Ms. Ram@@ í@@ rez is perhaps very well known here , but she is not the only spark of hope for migrants travelling through Tap@@ ach@@ ula . &quot;
at the other end of the city a dead end leads to Jes@@ ú@@ s Valen@@ zu@@ ela .
&quot; in this winter , Valen@@ zu@@ ela and his family have res@@ um@@ ed migrants in their small house . &quot;
he is a polic@@ eman and has found that the bus tickets to numerous African immigrants are sold too expensive .
&quot; he has begun to help them get a reasonable price , then he offered them his house for a dollar the night . &quot;
&quot; at the moment , 25 people are there , mainly Hai@@ tians . &quot;
&quot; some sleep on the floor , but at least they have electricity , a washing machine and a cooking place outside . &quot;
Valen@@ zu@@ ela explains that he knows what the guests go through .
&quot; I lived in the United States , &quot; he says . &quot; I have seen what they experience . &quot;
I crossed the border crossing the desert and we suffered .
there are places where people can help and others not help . that &apos;s the reason why I give them my support .
&quot; after he lived for three years , he was exp@@ elled from the United States after a raid on his work place . &quot;
&quot; the majority of migrants travelling through Tap@@ ach@@ ula comes from Central America , other inhabitants also open doors of their homes for them . &quot;

China : X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang residents are forced to install a surveillance app on their mobile phones .
a check @-@ point for personal communication devices in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang from Twitter users in the us@@ urer
&quot; the inhabitants of X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang , an ethnic minorities region in the West of China , are forced to install a spy@@ ware on their mobile phones . &quot;
&quot; on July 10 , the mobile phone users in the Ti@@ an@@ shan district of the town Uru@@ m@@ qi received a mobile phone notification in which it instruc@@ ts the district government to install a surveillance app called J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang ( or &quot; Web Cleaning &quot; ) . &quot;
&quot; in the communication , it is said that the app &quot; &quot; prevent access to terrorist information &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; however , the authorities would also want to use the app for more than the fight against terrorism . &quot;
&quot; according to an exclusive report by Radio Free Asia , 10 Kaz@@ ak@@ h women were arrested in the autonomous I@@ li Kaz@@ ak@@ h pre@@ f@@ ecture , because they had installed the app shortly after they had installed the app , exchanged messages with a private We@@ Chat group . &quot;
&quot; in the announcement of the police , the app was able to identify and track the sources and distribution channels of the terrorists , along with &quot; illegal religious &quot; activities and &quot; harmful information &quot; including videos , pictures , e@@ Books and documents . &quot;
J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang@@ s website describes the app as follows :
J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang is a protection service with system categories for children and adults introduced by Ji@@ angs@@ u Telec@@ om .
&quot; the main function is blocking porno@@ graphic websites , from online sc@@ ams , tro@@ j@@ ans and ph@@ ishing pages to make users aware how much time they spend online , and to remotely control their own home network . &quot;
this app with the filters for min@@ ors is intended to help children develop a healthy lifestyle .
an app with these functions can of course be used in a variety of ways .
&quot; for example , the &quot; remote control &quot; could enable state actors or even h@@ ackers to manipul@@ ate or ste@@ al the home network of a person . &quot;
this introduction is consistent with other measures to control digital activities in this region .
&quot; while messages about digital cens@@ or@@ ship in China mostly focus on the experiences of users in the larger cities in the east and south , reality is very often glo@@ omy for those living in remote , crowded ethnic minority regions such as X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang and Tibet . &quot;
&quot; to limit un@@ rest and dis@@ content in conflict areas , the authorities often arrange extreme cases and surveillance measures as well as routine internet de@@ position . &quot;
&quot; the media outlet on Twitter based media outlet &quot; Images from In China , &quot; the cens@@ ored news in China published , showed photos of a checkpoint , where polic@@ emen checked the vill@@ agers whether they installed the surveillance app . &quot;
the authorities in X@@ inj@@ ian make sure people use the official J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang App .
a mobile alert required that people install the app within 10 days .
&quot; if you are discovered on a checkpoint with a device without this software , they could be im@@ pris@@ oned up to 10 days . &quot;
this is a set@@ back for technological development .
they have forced the people to use devices that are intended for older people .
this is a form of imprisonment by the recovery technology .
we are back in Ma@@ os China .
&quot; images from &quot; &quot; China &quot; &quot; ( SH@@ IP ) also released a J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang product description , resulting from the fact that the software can lift the license requirements of a Windows operating system and therefore receives un@@ restricted access to the hard drive of the computer . &quot;
&quot; after installing J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang , computers and mobile phones in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang become electronic hand@@ cu@@ ffs . &quot;
the provisions in J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang may be a response to the instructions of the City Party Council to minimize the dis@@ semination of illegal content .
&quot; all government branches , authorities and associated institutions including universities and research institutions are obliged to follow the instructions of Cyber@@ security Office when operating their computers and communications devices . &quot;
&quot; an up @-@ to @-@ date report from Freedom House , an American Human Rights Organisation , also mentioned these new monitoring methods : &quot;
&quot; in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang , the authorities published a directive on 27 June in a district of the regional capital of Uru@@ m@@ qi by order to register their &quot; personal ID cards , mobile phones , external drives , portable hard drives , not@@ ebooks and media memory cards &quot; at the local police . &quot;
&quot; the intention is obviously any &quot; terrorist videos &quot; to identify and destroy . however , this action viol@@ ates the personality rights of Uru@@ m@@ qu@@ is three million inhabitants and gives them punishment for a whole host of other possible off@@ ences , including those relating to peaceful religious or political messages . &quot;
&quot; sleep or death , part 1 : everything cri@@ es after death &quot;
a single cell in Old Du@@ b@@ bo Ga@@ ol .

&quot; this is the first of six reports in the series of &quot; &quot; sleep or death &quot; &quot; in which the activ@@ ist Sar@@ mad Al J@@ il@@ ane describes his experiences in a Syrian prison . &quot;
&quot; far from our blue , virtual world you look at and imagine that you are all alone in a place where everything is important . &quot;
&quot; everything has gradually dissolved and revealed a truth , which is clearly recogni@@ zable from both inside and outside . &quot;
one that makes their name all honour .
one that has kno@@ cked down into a list of feelings and expressions that do not allow met@@ aph@@ ors .
&quot; but when the reality brings you back and you look behind the scenes - beyond the acting , the beautiful scenes and the performer - the characters transform themselves into being of flesh and blood , and all cri@@ es after death . &quot;
&quot; all doubt dis@@ solve in smoke and you will be aware of your existence , even if the Earth is on the axis of evil . you realize that you are caught between the walls that have built your parents , and before them your grand@@ parents , stone around stone . &quot;
&quot; they have arrested me and my father three times , but that wasn &apos;t enough for me to learn &quot; my lesson , &quot; as the chief of the security servant formulated it - with the promise that the fourth time would be a pleasure . &quot;
he demonstrated his power over us by even destroying the simpl@@ est concepts we knew .
five young people were torn apart during a peaceful protest like we@@ eds from the beautiful garden of our revolution .
&quot; it was enough for the city to cr@@ ush the darkness of the night with &quot; &quot; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &quot; &quot; scre@@ ams . &quot;
&quot; all the neighbor@@ hoods cov@@ eted , just my own not . &quot;
&quot; for the first time it was quiet , rainy , at the wrong time , even though I did not put high demands on a city that is stuff@@ ed up to the arter@@ ies with state security organisms and their ac@@ compli@@ ces . &quot;
&quot; in the third night things had cal@@ med down , after the power supply stopped functioning in the neighborhood . &quot;
&quot; I broke the silence by scre@@ aming several times &quot; &quot; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &quot; &quot; from my home roof . &quot;
I heard my voice ev@@ oked by silence .
a few minutes later some of my friends felt cour@@ age@@ ous enough to find together .
I was not alone .
&quot; many friends , true friends joined me ; we joined us to a magnificent picture that filled my expectations completely and entirely . &quot;
&quot; in such a moment , you are aware that you fre@@ ed the spirit from the lamp , but it is simply not interested in the least . &quot;
&quot; I received a call from my father : &quot; &quot; make you ready , we meet us at the Military Security Building . &quot;
he put on .
then I learned the following : no matter how much honey you can swal@@ low - nothing can give you back your voice after you have put it all the way up to the office of security service out of the body .
I arrived there .
the Colonel Gh@@ ass@@ an stood there with several of his men ; my father was already there as I was now .
&quot; the Colonel Gh@@ ass@@ an starts to speak : &quot; &quot; let me hear how you scre@@ am &quot; &quot; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &quot; &quot; or you are only brave enough to scre@@ am if we are not close . &quot;
his water @-@ filled eyes set themselves on me .
and you dare to look into my eyes and not on the ground !
what I did then has nothing to do with courage .
&quot; I was 18 years old , it was the fourth time that I stood before this building . &quot;
&quot; perhaps it was on my fol@@ ly , van@@ ity ; perhaps in the revolution . &quot;
I was so sure of my thing when I rep@@ lied : &quot; I wouldn &apos;t have thought that you have forgotten my voice since yesterday .
&quot; and I think I have never stopped to look into the eyes , so why should I do it now ? &quot;
&quot; it was the shortest entertainment that could have such fatal consequences for me , and yet I do not regret the word of what I said . &quot;
&quot; put him in sol@@ itary confin@@ ement , and his father alike . &quot;
&quot; his father , same with that . &quot;
the con@@ tention of this accur@@ sed sentence is up to this day in the nose .
&quot; he became a &quot; &quot; syndrome &quot; , &quot; a mental torture which I was exposed to months . &quot;
I went through the yard .
in the first office I leave everything I wear with myself .
&quot; then again through the yard and into the second office , which leads through a course to the individual cells . &quot;
I appro@@ ve all the details before I super@@ vised the room .
otherwise they have allocated a larger cell to me this time .
&quot; I have to share them with only one another prisoner , and must immediately put me at ease without waiting for their permission . &quot;
&quot; after a few minutes that felt like a whole life , the officials left the cell , and I handle an old @-@ tried method of communication : to beat the f@@ ist against the wall . &quot;
&quot; I learned that my C@@ ellen@@ ic Com@@ rade was a &quot; &quot; first prisoner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; after a long hes@@ itation , he answered me finally . &quot;
&quot; apparently in none of the surrounding cells there was a respected man middle aged man , who looks similar to me and called &quot; the doctor . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in perfect darkness , no prominent fac@@ tions can be seen in me , and doctors do not exist here ; we are all only numbers . &quot;
maybe someone whose voice sounds like mine ?
all the answers are linked to his existence .
perhaps he was moved to one of the big cells .
maybe he will stop immediately .
&quot; the investig@@ ator had insured me , they would release him if I remain . &quot;
li@@ ars .
I &apos;d like to have had a scar@@ ec@@ row to drive out all these crow@@ s that were lying on the fruits in my head &apos;s garden .
&quot; from af@@ ar I still hear them scre@@ aming &quot; &quot; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; it must be about 10 o &apos;clock in the evening ; always at this time the scre@@ ams , every day . &quot;
the door opens .
&quot; I was always convinced that black was the color of per@@ dition , until I saw the yellow light that presented us the horror in person : the Ra@@ ad ( about : &quot; Don@@ ner , &quot; all@@ usion to 13 S@@ ure des Kor@@ an ) . &quot;
they are here to be heard .
&quot; this was the secret of the secret : to protect state security in front of us and prevent the betra@@ yer and the terrorists in us , they speak in the Alban@@ ian dial@@ ect - so they played their denom@@ in@@ ational black@@ mail and betra@@ yed the narrow view of their world view . &quot;
&quot; this is not a house here , which is not a country ; it is a curse that they call co@@ existence to transform the crimin@@ als of their clan into a hero . &quot;
&quot; I cared for the inter@@ rog@@ ation room and meet Abu I@@ mad , a slender and stock@@ y man ; at least he seems to me . &quot;
&quot; he starts a &quot; pleasant &quot; conversation , in spite of the expressions that gli@@ de to him : &quot; my boy , you are still young , you can start so much more important with your life than to protest this day and protest on demonstrations , which will soon be an end anyway . &quot;
I didn &apos;t answer .
I have acc@@ u@@ stom@@ ed to answering them .
I can really no longer tell exactly when ins@@ ults and blow@@ s have become a common means of communication for me .
when and how it happened was un@@ important .
&quot; one voice in me said that I had to get used to it , punished , punished , even though I had done nothing to earn this punishment . &quot;
punishment in all its diversity .
his command is to tear me as much meat as possible from the body .
he calls the lov@@ ingly &quot; con@@ fession . &quot;
it starts with a plastic pipe which probably origin@@ ates from the clo@@ ak@@ ings .
your hang@@ man came to your cry .
give him the pleasure ; you cannot measure yourself with him and you cannot keep your scre@@ ams back .
&quot; my scre@@ ams were not enough for him , so why they exchanged the pipe through a cable . &quot;
&quot; during my first arrest , I asked if the investig@@ ator had previously worked as a g@@ arb@@ age collector or whether it belonged to the normal working equipment . &quot;
&quot; they had four cables inter@@ tw@@ ined in order to present us , from their point of view , great invention of a huge cable . &quot;
&quot; within one hour three of them changed , while I was still in the row . &quot;
&quot; I had lost all feeling in my body - and also my voice , which is why I stopped crying . &quot;
the exec@@ ution@@ er re@@ marked the cooling and didn &apos;t find any favor on it so that he accessed an electri@@ cally loaded rod as a neighbour .
&quot; electricity flow@@ ed my whole body , enough to supply my whole quarter . &quot;
&quot; my semi @-@ naked body , lying on the ground , was the perfect conductor . &quot;
the num@@ b@@ ness disappeared and the pain was back .
after two terrible hours he decided that he had fulfilled his duty for that night .
it must have been around midnight .
I decided to fall asleep again ; let &apos;s say that was my only option .
a few hours passed away that occurred to me as minutes .
then the call to the morning prayer .
&quot; the door opens and the morning light ful@@ fills the room . &quot; &quot; R@@ aus with you , as@@ sion@@ ist . &quot;
&quot; I answer with the voice of an exhausted young man : &quot; &quot; my Lord , my father must be fear@@ ful . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; be quiet , and walk away , you will be laid . &quot;
this was new .
otherwise they had always been released .
where do they lead me ? !
&quot; the Jord@@ anian R@@ apper Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ d@@ ai@@ b talks about the rights of LGB@@ T@@ Q + community , freedom of expression and resistance &quot;
Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ d@@ ai@@ b smo@@ kes a cigar@@ ette in his studio .
&quot; the photo was taken by A@@ man Mad@@ an , the original author of this text . &quot;
&quot; Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ d@@ ai@@ b sp@@ ends most of his time indo@@ ors ; sometimes he sli@@ ps to his screen , sometimes to his computer , and again to his couch . &quot;
but what one can rely on is a cigar@@ ette between his fingers or his with ni@@ cot@@ ine stain@@ ed lips .
&quot; he lives in the top floor of his family house , which has belonged to them since 1967 ; the year in which Israel completed his occupation of the West Bank and forced H@@ d@@ ai@@ bs family to flee from their village in Palestine , in which they had lived as fel@@ ah@@ ye@@ a ( e.g. : farmers ) . &quot;
&quot; for six years , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b has been a passionate activ@@ ist who confron@@ ts the conservative majority and ques@@ tioned their old @-@ proven opinions on gender roles , sexu@@ ality and freedom of expression through art and rape . &quot;
&quot; with his music , which often deals with themes such as ori@@ ent@@ alism , rac@@ ism and the situation of Palestinian refugees , he also demands the core of the entire Arab world . &quot;
&quot; with his 25 years , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b sees himself as someone who is not restricted in his thinking through borders , and he can feel with the people who suffer from the devast@@ ating consequences of foreign interventions in countries such as Iraq , Yemen , Syria and Libya . &quot;
&quot; even though he does not openly admit it , he won a special inc@@ lin@@ ation against the American foreign policy . &quot;
H@@ d@@ ai@@ b considers his art in his studio in Am@@ man .
recorded by the author .
&quot; H@@ d@@ ai@@ b does not believe that his compassion for those who try to survive in war zones , have something to do with his identity as &quot; Palestinian &quot; refugees in the second generation , even though he was born in Jordan and has never been in Palestine . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t think about my own circumstances , &quot; says H@@ d@@ ai@@ b . &quot;
&quot; then he adds : &quot; &quot; I think so because I am a man , &quot; while he dissolved in water N@@ esc@@ af@@ é in two cups . it is the holy month Ram@@ ad@@ an ; at that time it is intended for Muslims to fast from sunrise to sunset . &quot;
the Jord@@ anian law also states that public consumption of food during Ram@@ ad@@ an is illegal .
&quot; obviously , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b has a certain weakness to break with ancient traditions ; on the other hand , a cup of coffee in a sen@@ sing hot young day has little to do with protest against Islam . &quot;
&quot; basically , the war@@ ms are lu@@ k@@ ew@@ arm coffee and the go@@ ads of the K@@ ent cigar@@ ette in the nose primarily speak of freedom . &quot;
&quot; sometimes Jordan feels like a prison under the open sky , especially if one thro@@ ws a look into neighbouring countries . &quot;
&quot; therefore , it is easy to do basic things - as in the public during Ram@@ ad@@ an water to drink - not to land in prison . &quot;
&quot; recently , the Interior Ministry of Jordan did a gig in the band M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos; Lei@@ la , already for the second time . &quot;
&quot; some parliam@@ ent@@ arians who support the Islamic Action Front - the Jord@@ anian branch of the Muslim Brotherhood - argu@@ ed that the sexual orientation of the hom@@ os@@ exual tribute , Ham@@ ed Sinn@@ o , contradic@@ ts the cultural and traditional norms of the country and the main reason for the concert evening . &quot;
&quot; the dep@@ uty and former spokes@@ person of the Islamic coalition , Dim@@ a Tah@@ bou@@ b , said in an interview with CN@@ N that the concert was cancelled &quot; just &quot; because of the sexual orientation of the singer . &quot;
&quot; many also argue that the engagement of the band in matters such as the Arab Spring , human rights and freedom of expression in the Arab world is dangerous activ@@ ism , which ques@@ tioned the well @-@ established legitim@@ acy of author@@ it@@ arian regimes in the entire region . &quot;
&quot; in a public statement , M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos; Lei@@ la appreciated the Jord@@ anian people as &quot; progressive supporters of human rights , &quot; which still op@@ poses &quot; for intellectual and cultural pl@@ ur@@ alism . &quot; &quot;
&quot; this statement may not be simply sil@@ ly rh@@ et@@ oric , but in fact an increasingly clear @-@ crystall@@ ising reality reflected in Jordan , which appears clearly in H@@ d@@ ai@@ b &apos;s work . &quot;
&quot; in 2016 , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b recovered traditional line@@ age to be a body by ab@@ using his vision of the fate of Arab women who have had sex . &quot;
&quot; the picture shows the skel@@ eton of an apparently tr@@ unc@@ ated unknown woman , whose arms and legs stretch up to the corners of the canvas . &quot;
&quot; it is surrounded by a red lake , perhaps the blood of the inn@@ umer@@ able women who lost their lives through the hands of those whom they should actually trust . &quot;
&quot; over the past few years , the number of &quot; &quot; Honor@@ ary Mor@@ ning &quot; &quot; has taken place in Jordan - the un@@ official outside . &quot;
&quot; according to Human Rights Watch , the number of honor@@ ary kill@@ ings reached its peak in 2016 ; however , it is still more difficult to support Jordan &apos;s institutional infrastructure to support women victims tried murder or domestic violence . &quot;
&quot; according to a law to fight against crime from the year 1954 , women , who are exposed to the risk of family violence , are often a long @-@ term bureaucr@@ atic effort , as well as the guarantee provided by the family , that the woman is not going to happen . &quot;
H@@ d@@ ai@@ bs music also enjoys great popularity and is known to not shy away from themes that are long tab@@ oo in his country .
&quot; H@@ d@@ ai@@ b den@@ ies that his work is political , but adm@@ its that he puts his music , which is full of explicit all@@ u@@ sions on sexu@@ ality , freedom and expression , cannot separate from politics . &quot;
&quot; I come from the Middle East , man . &quot;
&quot; politics was saying , &quot; &quot; he says . &quot;
in a song called &quot; Edward Sa &apos;@@ ed &quot; H@@ d@@ ai@@ b takes the question of the Palestinian identity .
in &quot; Law@@ la al 3@@ ai@@ b &quot; and in &quot; gh@@ are@@ eb &quot; the focus is on poverty .
the list of the songs that are political in the core can be continued .
in March 2016 H@@ d@@ ai@@ b published a song entitled &quot; Sant@@ and@@ ano . &quot;
in this song a verse repe@@ ats itself often :
&quot; you are free , and everyone else is it . &quot;
&quot; in the course of the song H@@ d@@ ai@@ b describes the world as a kind of market where you can , in his words , &quot; that can get what you want &quot; - be faith or non @-@ belief , hetero@@ - or homosexu@@ ality . &quot;
he noted that hardly anyone in Jordan talks about the rights of gay and les@@ bi@@ ans and that comments on equality of LGB@@ T@@ Q + individuals were still cens@@ ored in 2014 .
&quot; in 2014 , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b conducted an interview for the popular Jord@@ anian online program Ro@@ ya , to mark later that his comments were torn out of the context , distor@@ ted and had been cens@@ ored . &quot;
&quot; on Youtube it was uploaded without cuts , but was only a modified version , &quot; he says . &quot;
H@@ d@@ ai@@ b acqu@@ ires H@@ d@@ ai@@ b openly for the Arab LGB@@ T@@ Q + community and believes that intoler@@ ance towards homosexu@@ als does not speak to Islam .
&quot; he men@@ tions Abu Nu@@ what , a poet of the eighth century , who still remains in memory thanks to its homo@@ erotic poems . &quot;
&quot; H@@ d@@ ai@@ b asks : if Abu Nu@@ des , who later should work on behalf of Cali@@ ph , could write openly about homosexu@@ ality in the eighth century , why can Jord@@ an@@ ier not ? &quot;
&quot; the real problem , so H@@ d@@ ai@@ b , have nothing to do with M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos; Lei@@ la or the fact that the concert was canc@@ eled . &quot;
&quot; in the h@@ ash@@ em@@ i@@ tic kingdom , it is nothing new that the government sanc@@ tioned attacks on freedom of expression and that progressive voices will be sil@@ enced . &quot;
&quot; recently , in January 2017 , the Jord@@ anian news service held several former members of government and members of the teacher &apos;s association , with the reason that they had a critical impact on comment@@ aries in social media , which are related to the problems rooted in the country . &quot;
&quot; in view of this , H@@ d@@ ai@@ bs &apos;s concert is only the tip of the ic@@ eberg - the real challenge is to create a structural change in the next generation of the Jord@@ an@@ ier . &quot;
&quot; in Jordan , M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos; Lei@@ la has denied entry for the second time in a row , but the way of progress - this is H@@ d@@ ai@@ b - consists of slow , thou@@ ght@@ ful and internal changes . it is certain that these changes will take place from day to day in the heart of Jord@@ anian society . &quot;
&quot; finally H@@ d@@ ai@@ b dreams , like millions of other Arabs , from an Arab world without intervention from abroad . &quot;
&quot; he does not only dream of bringing his work to Bag@@ h@@ dad , Jerusalem and Damascus , but also of it &quot; to experience it . &quot; &quot;
&quot; perhaps the region will be crow@@ ned by music , art and literature of a genuine and fundamental openness - and not by bombs , cluster mun@@ itions and artificial nature . at least he hopes that . &quot;
&quot; until it is ready , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b will continue and therefore also resist . &quot;

Neb@@ uta in A@@ om@@ ori is one of the 3 largest festivals in Japan .
these big extravag@@ ant war@@ ri@@ bs are so fantastic ! ! !
there are numerous theories regarding the origin of the Neb@@ uta festival .
&quot; one susp@@ ects that it is a variant of the Tan@@ ab@@ ata Festival , which is usually also celebrated in August in many areas of T@@ oh@@ ok@@ us . another theory states that the fort@@ resses , the drums and dancing were mar@@ ched over more than a thousand years in order to force the indigenous inhabitants of the region , the E@@ mis@@ hi , to the knees . &quot;
we are at the Neb@@ uta Festival in A@@ om@@ ori .
&quot; we were able to grab some great seats , so we have a great view . &quot;
you can only imagine how big these parts are ...
&quot; a community centre in the capital , Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en , hosted a two @-@ month exhibition on W@@ a no Ak@@ ari ( literally ) . &quot;
I have been looking for the Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en for a long time : two fe@@ asts are just to be seen .
&quot; nevertheless , for many people who take the trip to A@@ om@@ ori , the Neb@@ uta festival is the only true - and still a breathtaking way to spend his summer : &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Y@@ att@@ em@@ are &quot; &quot; ! &quot;
Y@@ att@@ em@@ are ! &quot; # Sommer@@ festival in the north of the country .
I was there and watched the # Neb@@ ut@@ a@@ Festival .
the sight of a 18 @-@ metre @-@ high carriage was incredible .
let &apos;s enjoy the rest of the summer !
young Peru@@ ans exchange weapons against scis@@ sors and raz@@ ors

&quot; outside appearance and body care were as important as in this story , because they help to keep the Peru@@ vian youth away from crime and promote a legitimate profession like that of the hair@@ dres@@ ser . &quot;
&quot; El Call@@ ao , Per@@ us &apos;s most important port , is located on the coast of the Pacific Ocean , near the historic center of Lima - a region with a very high crime rate , where street noise and illegal drug traff@@ icking are daily . &quot;
a survey published in April 2017 showed that 5@@ 1.5 percent of the population of this region will not feel safe .
&quot; at the same time , Peru - like many other Central and South American countries - is experiencing increasing demand for aesthetic services for men . &quot;
&quot; the trend , appearance and thus also the unusual hair@@ styles of famous athletes such as Paolo Gu@@ err@@ ero ( Peru ) , Ar@@ tur@@ o Vi@@ dal ( Peru ) , or N@@ ey@@ mar ( Brazil ) , has led to becoming more and more normal in the experienced hands of hair@@ dres@@ sers who can recre@@ ate these elaborate hair@@ styles . &quot;
&quot; the unprecedented demand for hair@@ styles that go to the extreme limits of fantasy and creativity has even inspired an annual event , the competition of Fris@@ eure &quot; Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os , &quot; which has been taking place since 2014 . &quot;
&quot; there are experts in front of each other to show who among them can create the most ec@@ centric lenses , as you can see in the following video ( more videos about current competitions are available on the Facebook profile Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os ) . &quot;
&quot; educational institutions such as the school August@@ o Sal@@ azar Bon@@ dy , who are located in El Call@@ ao , found here an opportunity to exchange their weapons against hair@@ dressing tools and receive training in hair@@ dres@@ sers , which allows them to find work . &quot;
motivated by this activity and the opportunities offered have seen dozens of young people that they can take a job that is currently in fashion .
the school had special training workshops before the school year beginning in March and reported about some of its achievements :
&quot; in 1995 we were the only school in the community and the district where we are very proud , because we have built this educational community out of love for the children . &quot;

this is precisely this question the two young Colom@@ bian activists Leonardo P@@ ár@@ rag@@ a from the Young Youth Foundation and inspired them to the Cart@@ as p@@ or la Rec@@ on@@ cili@@ aci@@ ón ( letter to reconciliation ) to encourage young people to write gu@@ err@@ illa fighters .
only recently their country was the scene of a historic event and they wanted to contribute their part : after years of negoti@@ ation the Colom@@ bian government had concluded a peace treaty with the gu@@ err@@ illa defl@@ ection F@@ ARC ( German : revolutionary Forces of Colombia ) which forms the summit of the longest armed conflict in Latin America .
&quot; internationally , the sig@@ nat@@ ory of the Peace Treaty was so significant that the Colom@@ bian President José Manuel San@@ tos was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his mer@@ its . &quot;
&quot; before the Colom@@ bian , however , there is still a long way to speak of a real reconciliation and peace . &quot;
&quot; gu@@ err@@ illa fighters who have lived in illegal camps for many years , having been exposed to war rh@@ et@@ oric and carrying their weapons around the clock must now be integrated into the lives of civilians . &quot;
&quot; the Colom@@ bian society in turn , which had become acc@@ u@@ stom@@ ed to life in constant fear and in some cases of deep hatred against gu@@ err@@ illa fighters , must now take them into their ranks and support them in building a new life . &quot;
Leonardo and Cr@@ isti@@ an were convinced that young Colom@@ bi@@ ans would close together and help with the integration process .
and that &apos;s exactly what they did : until now thousands of young people have already written letters - love messages to former gu@@ err@@ illa fighters to welcome them back in society .
the aim of the campaign is 69@@ 00 letters - one for every former gu@@ err@@ illa fighter - which should then be handed over personally .
Valent@@ ine &apos;s Day as an inspiration for the campaign
&quot; the idea for the letters to reconciliation was created on the world summit of Nobel Peace Lau@@ re@@ ates , which took place in Bog@@ ot@@ á in February 2017 . there , Leonardo and Cr@@ isti@@ an had the opportunity to talk to K@@ ail@@ ash Sat@@ yar@@ thi , awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014 . &quot;
&quot; this explained that we love the people we love to write thousands of love letters on Valent@@ ine &apos;s Day , but those who need them much more unnecessary . &quot;
&quot; he plans to share his love with people this year , who needed the most urgent response . &quot;
&quot; so the plan was to write letters full of hope and support for former war@@ ri@@ ors of the F@@ ARC , who now have their place in society and to build a new life . &quot; the letters will show that the Colom@@ bian society is ready to make the discourse of a history of war on a common history of peace . &quot; &quot;
so far more than 2000 letters were collected during the campaign .
&quot; the initiative is represented in all major cities of Colombia like Cal@@ i , Man@@ iz@@ ales , Med@@ ell@@ ín , Bar@@ ran@@ qu@@ illa and Bog@@ ot@@ á . &quot;
I never thought someone would forgive me
the first 500 letters were handed over to one of the UN camps in the Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca region on 19 March .
&quot; a group of 40 students from the University of J@@ aver@@ iana in Cal@@ i , two members of the Municip@@ ality of Cal@@ i and Leonardo from the Bog@@ ot@@ Art Foundation travelled to the camp to personally transfer the letters personally . &quot;
the members of the F@@ ARC set themselves up as they had done earlier in order to accept the orders of their leaders .
&quot; but this time they received no orders , but letters full of support from people from all over the country . &quot;
&quot; it was a very moving moment for everyone involved . &quot; it &apos;s incredible how many different feelings one can go through in just a few hours - from fear to happiness and all that is in between , &quot; said the political scientist Manu@@ ela Jim@@ é@@ ne@@ z Av@@ ila later . &quot;
&quot; Sandra Par@@ ra , an employee of the province of Valle del Cau@@ ca described this unforgettable experience as follows : &quot;
&quot; after we had passed the letters , a former war@@ rior led me through the camp of the gu@@ err@@ illa fighters . &quot;
&quot; when I saw in one of the &quot; Cam@@ bu@@ ches &quot; ( a kind of hut in which the gu@@ err@@ illa fighters are living ) , I saw a gu@@ err@@ illa fighter who wrote something . &quot;
&quot; I was afraid to go down , for next to him on the bed lay a M@@ GL gran@@ ulate , a deadly weapon in the Sle@@ eping Beauty . &quot;
&quot; and I said , &quot; &quot; Hi , what do they do ? &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; I answer a letter which someone has written to me . &quot;
it is a very nice and hop@@ eful letter .
&quot; never in my life someone has written something so beautiful , so I answer it . suddenly the tears ran over the che@@ eks . &quot;
I embrac@@ ed him completely and sat down beside the pom@@ eg@@ ran@@ ates .
&quot; perhaps he was sorry for the war , sorry , all the years of faithful companions to be this fighter , and wanted to help him write this letter . &quot;
&quot; the man told me more about his life . he never expected anything else from life as a war . to join the F@@ ARC , it was the only way to keep him and his six brothers in front of the hunger death . &quot; I never thought someone would forgive me for my mistakes . &quot;
&quot; but now I know that there is a society there , waiting for us with open arms . &quot;
&quot; until now , I only learned how to deal with weapons . &quot;
&quot; but now where peace reig@@ ns , I can learn many things and work in dignity . &quot;
new voices
&quot; at the start , students and some leaders of the F@@ ARC were invited to a discussion round . &quot;
the students were all grown up as already war and the F@@ ARC already acted in secret .
&quot; this is why the leaders of the F@@ ARC declared the history of the organization , their ide@@ als and gave insight into their views on the peace process : &quot; &quot; for many years we have experienced how social injus@@ tice on the part of the State worked for the whole Colom@@ bian people . &quot;
&quot; for a target of this magnit@@ ude , it is worthwhile to overcome all obstacles , &quot; one of them said . &quot;
Manu@@ ela was impressed :
&quot; to hear these people who have never been hearing and had no elec@@ tive right , and to realize that the people that I have often seen as monsters and even hate them , were also only people with beautiful feelings , which were turned up@@ side by their circumstances and their environment , was very painful for me . &quot;
&quot; the reality in which the country lives , hur@@ ts me . &quot;
&quot; but it comfor@@ ted me that all men - even those who have killed and so much hurt , can teach us something and give us a smile and a hu@@ g . &quot;
many former fighters have responded to the letters .
&quot; Gust@@ av@@ o Gon@@ z@@ á@@ lez , the commander of the camp in Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca , wrote the example Dar@@ ío de Jes@@ ú@@ s Mon@@ sal@@ ve , the Arch@@ bishop of the city of Cal@@ i , the following letter : &quot;
the Colom@@ bian was prophes@@ ied that after dis@@ ar@@ ming peace would rule .
but this is not the case .
&quot; as long as ine@@ quality , hunger and a lack of education , health care and employment opportunities , there will always be people willing to attack the weapons and protest for their rights . and that is also completely justified ( ... ) . &quot;
&quot; we of the F@@ ARC are now putting on peace , on a policy without weapons . &quot;
&quot; that is why we call on all def@@ enders of peace - regardless of the race , religion or ideology - to rise above all those who dream of a country in war . &quot;
&quot; we give you our word , make our contribution and bring sacrifice , as we know from our own experience that nothing is simple . those among us who defend life as the basis of existence will face many difficulties . &quot;
&quot; on our way there will be many obstacles , but together we will overcome them . &quot;

&quot; hom@@ os@@ exual and que@@ er people living in the Cau@@ cas@@ us region are exposed to a wide range of dangers , including discrimination , physical and sexual violence and black@@ mail . &quot;
&quot; with horror , activists have witnessed the reporting of recent months on the persecution of gay men in Ch@@ echn@@ ya . &quot;
but the threat that hangs like a D@@ amo@@ cles on the dor@@ sal LGB@@ T@@ Q community did not come about overnight .
&quot; OC Media had the opportunity to talk to a trans@@ sexual woman from Gros@@ ny , who shared some of her experiences with us and talked to us what is currently happening in the Republic . &quot;
&quot; the LGB@@ T@@ Q legal situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya has conquered the international head@@ lines several months ago after reports have been published , which addressed the deport@@ ation , torture and killing of que@@ er men in the Republic . &quot;
the first report was published by journalist Elena Mil@@ asch@@ ina in the Now@@ aya Gaz@@ eta ; she threw a light on the methods of the Che@@ chen authorities who arrested more suspic@@ ious que@@ er men and put them in secret pris@@ ons in ar@@ gun .
&quot; they have brought a monster to the world &quot;
&quot; Sabrina , a trans@@ wife , was born in Gros@@ ny and grew up there . &quot;
since her childhood she felt that she was a woman in reality .
&quot; when she grew up , she became aware that Ch@@ echn@@ ya was not a safe place for her , why she moved to Moscow . &quot;
&quot; after a group of Tsch@@ et@@ sch@@ enen had experienced by the gender equality of their land@@ lady , the hunt was opened on Sabrina . &quot;
she moved to the USA from fear for her life .
Sabrina : I was working as an honor@@ ary hel@@ per in a human rights organization .
one day I told me that someone needed my help .
&quot; it was a friend of D@@ age@@ stan , a trans@@ duc@@ er who put into trouble . &quot;
&quot; she had no money , so I took her without hes@@ itation . &quot;
&quot; while I tried to help her , someone from whom I thought he would be a friend , a copy of my documents and spread her everywhere on the internet , with my phone number and a picture of me . &quot;
&quot; after that , the photos of my documents went through the W@@ hat@@ s@@ App . &quot;
on 10 October 2015 I was attacked .
&quot; when I was doing a few shopping bags from the back seat of my car , I heard a male voice saying , &quot; Here is a gift for you from your unc@@ le . &quot;
&quot; when I turned around , I felt something in my body , but I did nothing to hurt . &quot;
&quot; then I heard a sentence , but this time in Ch@@ echn@@ ya : &quot; how long will you still honor the family , you che@@ er ? &quot;
I didn &apos;t know the person .
&quot; I only know that it was a young man , no 30 years old . &quot;
then I lost consciousness and wo@@ ke up again at the hospital .
&quot; apparently , some women had everything to get involved and started to scre@@ am . &quot;
the man had fled .
the women had called an ambul@@ ance .
&quot; in the hospital , I learned that I had two stit@@ ches in my right lung . &quot;
&quot; OC Media : in which sick@@ nesses have you been put , in which the men or women ? &quot;
Sabrina : my documents are de@@ prec@@ ated because my male name is still on it ; but the doctor understood and put me to the women .
I am very thank@@ ful to him .
&quot; when I read his name for the first time at his office door , I got it with fear ; it was a Muslim , a cau@@ c@@ astic name . &quot;
but he turned out to be a good man .
I am grateful to him that he has been resp@@ ect@@ ful with me .
I spent more than a month in the hospital .
last February I received threats .
&quot; they called me , wrote me - relatives , stran@@ gers , some completely unknown . &quot;
that was the beginning of a night@@ mare .
my family was visited by neighb@@ ors and some distant relatives .
&quot; they demanded to send me back to Ch@@ echn@@ ya , to prove that all this was a lie . &quot;
&quot; some said to me , I had to prove it by running through the streets ; others wanted me to appear on the official television in Gros@@ ny and say that I didn &apos;t change my gender that everything was only bad speech , and Photos@@ hop . &quot;
I have grain size C - what should I have to say on TV ?
OC Media : how did your family try to deal with this pressure ?
Sabrina : it is still hard for her .
some elderly people once said my mother on the street .
&quot; they said to her , &quot; You have brought a monster to the world that has not only been your family , but the entire republic . &quot;
&quot; we cannot touch you because you are a pi@@ ous woman , but you have to disappear from here . &quot;
my mother was too much and she lay a sn@@ are around her neck .
luck@@ ily the neighb@@ ors came and saved them .
at the time I had to change the apartment several times a day .
I moved to an apartment and a few hours later the window stood under the window a car with dark@@ ened wind@@ screens and a number sign with a 95 .
&quot; after it happened for the third time , it became clear to me that there was something la@@ zy . &quot;
my human rights friends checked the num@@ eric signs - it turned out that I was persec@@ uted .
OC Media : how did you fly ?
Sabrina : with the help of activists .
&quot; for security reasons , I don &apos;t want to give up their names , but I want to say that I remember them all ; they really helped me . &quot;
&quot; with her help I left the country , but then something incredible happened . &quot;
I can still not understand how it could be .
shortly before my departure from Moscow I bought a new SIM card to call my mother once I arrived .
&quot; I bought them without registering myself , without ID , without anything . &quot;
I broke my old SIM card and threw it into the g@@ arb@@ age .
arrived and checked in to the hotel .
the number was registered on a stranger .
I put the SIM card into my cell phone .
&quot; at the moment when I wanted to call my mother via W@@ hat@@ s@@ App , I got a message : &quot; you don &apos;t think you would be in security just because you left the country ? &quot;
our people know in which hotel you hide . you even know your number of rooms .
only to prove you : it is the number 115 .
can you imagine this ? !
that was actually my number .
OC Media : are you still in contact with your family ?
Sabrina : only with my mother and my sisters .
&quot; however , we don &apos;t talk about the gender equality , this is a tab@@ oo subject . &quot;
I still wear some traditional C@@ auc@@ asi@@ an elements in me .
&quot; as much as I wish , I can &apos;t overcome this mental barrier . &quot;
&quot; I always say that as long as my mother is alive , I will do my best to avoid it . &quot;
&quot; when we chat with camera , I really take trouble to see how the person looks at which she rec@@ alls from her past - so to my male form . &quot;
but that is very difficult .
OC Media : do you know something about the current situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya ?
&quot; what do your friends , those who have stopped ? &quot;
Sabrina : I submitted a report in Washington last week .
I needed up @-@ to @-@ date information about the situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
I spoke to someone who spent one and a half months in ar@@ gun .
&quot; he told us that during Ram@@ ad@@ an there were no people arrested and tor@@ tured , but also that all the end of Ram@@ ad@@ an could hardly wait , and he did not lock a new wave . &quot;
most likely they will focus on family and relatives .
&quot; that mean I , they probably invite the relatives , they take care of the problem with the person concerned and at the end require a proof that the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; honour &quot; &quot; has experienced by blood satisfaction . &quot;
OC Media : are also gay men in these secret pris@@ ons ?
Sabrina : a friend of me says it is not so many .
&quot; if , then , especially those who have no rich relatives or who were dropped by their relatives in order to face Kad@@ y@@ rows &apos;s court . &quot;
&quot; as far as I know , they are recorded there so that they can be presented as terrorists later . &quot;
&quot; say , &quot; &quot; If they are killed , they will show their bodies on television and claim they would have attacked any village or military base . &quot;
do you understand ?
&quot; as if these people were not simply disappeared , but specifically di@@ pped in order to radic@@ alise themselves . &quot;
&quot; OC Media : is this only a mut@@ ation , or do you have a source of this information ? &quot;
Sabrina : I just quote someone who was im@@ pris@@ oned in ar@@ gun one and a half months .
he says that many people in this prison have disappeared after their be@@ ard grew .
there was nothing new since then .
they simply took them along .
&quot; and this so @-@ called Lord , this person was even when these people were taken . &quot;
&quot; until now , they were not presented as ban@@ dits , but there were no reports yet . we suppose that such actions are quite possible . &quot;
why else could it not have been allowed to sh@@ ave to these people ?
&quot; do you know if these persec@@ utions and ab@@ duc@@ tions of people , who belong to a so @-@ called &quot; non @-@ traditional &quot; orientation , have already happened in the past ? &quot;
Sabrina : I always wore my hair long .
in Ch@@ echn@@ ya I had a Bob .
&quot; I think , before 2003 , I was already known in the whole of Gros@@ ny , when I was still living there - and I never had problems . &quot;
in earn@@ est !
&quot; even from 1998 to 1999 , when the Sh@@ aria was considered , I had never had problems . &quot;
&quot; on the contrary , it was much safer than now . &quot;
&quot; Russia originally wanted to introduce us to &quot; &quot; civil@@ isation &quot; , &quot; but ultimately brought us back to the Stone Age . &quot;
OC Media : how is this possible under Sh@@ aria law ?
&quot; Sabrina : my eyeb@@ rows were pl@@ u@@ cked ; I had dy@@ ed eyelashes , wore tu@@ bular jeans and short tops . &quot;
the Ministry of Security of Sh@@ aria has never bent my hair .
&quot; in front of the Russian theatre in Gros@@ ny , there was a place where every evening , especially at weekends , a whole group of people like me met . &quot;
&quot; it was a small place where several benches were standing , and the whole city knew about it ; they knew why men , young people , met there . &quot;
we were never off@@ ended .
in the Che@@ chen language there is a saying : K@@ har@@ da ma K@@ har@@ da . that means &quot; Sp@@ ree not about the mis@@ fortune of another . &quot;
it is often said to be children when they make fun of the sick .
&quot; OC Media : so they simply shut their eyes closed before you , because they believed you are sick ? &quot;
Sabrina : yes .
&quot; they have never insul@@ ted me , never hun@@ ted and never defeated . &quot;
OC Media : how long did this grace period last ?
Sabrina : as long as Kad@@ y@@ row stepped on the plan .
&quot; when he was appointed Prime Minister in 2005 , he began to speak about mor@@ ality in television . &quot;
&quot; he spoke not about us per se , but primarily about the behaviour of women . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , you could feel how people started to change in the city . &quot;
&quot; he who had sm@@ iled and laugh@@ ed before , saw you at once with suspic@@ ion . &quot;
in the time I left Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
&quot; but every time I came back home , I could feel how the situation in the republic was ever worse . &quot;
OC Media : what activity do you work now ?
Sabrina : I work as a wa@@ it@@ ress .
I do not earn much - 700 to 800 dollars per month are not much in the US .
&quot; apart from that , I am still active as an activ@@ ist . &quot;
&quot; currently , I am responsible for 15 Muslim women . &quot;
I commun@@ e with them as a kind of psych@@ ologist .
&quot; we organize te@@ et@@ re@@ ff , gather@@ ings , I join them to the hospital and help them get food cards . &quot;
I have no c@@ ents for that .
I discovered these people myself when I cl@@ apped them .
I am Muslims and wants to help those who need help .
OC Media : do you wear a Hid@@ den@@ ab ?
Sabrina : this is al@@ bern .
&quot; so nature , it has nothing to do with religion . &quot;
&quot; this is exactly the same as ch@@ equ@@ es who want to prophes@@ y with foam in front of the mouth , that there is no sw@@ aying with them . &quot;
&quot; the D@@ age@@ men have those who have the Cab@@ ard@@ ines who , the Russians , too , and on all the planet they are - but &quot; not in Ch@@ echn@@ ya . &quot; &quot;
&quot; I come from there , so it is unpleasant to hear something like that . &quot;
I meet so many men from the Cau@@ cas@@ us .
many of them - practicing Muslims who go to the mos@@ que and fasting during Ram@@ ad@@ an - live together with men .
&quot; you know , many think for men who love men , and they believe that you change his sex to make more intimate experiences . but that &apos;s a failure . &quot;
&quot; these are two different things - two different ways of feeling , to be accurate , different life settings . &quot;
for me it is the most important thing to feel in my own skin and not to be ashamed of my body .
not whether I have a partner or not .
&quot; sorry , that I am so personal here , but my last intimate relationship is now longer than a year ago . &quot;
and I &apos;m not sad at all - I just know that I am now myself .
local groups warn against an increase of su@@ icide within the im@@ pover@@ ished Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i community in Iran
the Iranian Ah@@ wa@@ z region suff@@ ers from an un@@ usually high unemployment rate and poverty rate within the native Arab population .
&quot; since the last few months , there has been a strong increase in su@@ icide . &quot;
the photo of the Arab workers in Iran was provided by the Patri@@ otic Arab Democratic Movement in Ah@@ wa@@ z .
photo : use with permission .
&quot; the self @-@ burning of a man named J@@ assi@@ m Mor@@ amaz@@ i on 27 August recovered the des@@ perate situation of the Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i community in Iran , which is shaped by poverty and unemployment , in the spotlight . &quot;
Mor@@ amaz@@ i was married and had a child ; he lived in Al @-@ Tha@@ w@@ ra in the Ah@@ wa@@ z region in the southwest of Iran .
&quot; he suffered from anxiety , depression , and he was ashamed of his own hel@@ pl@@ ess@@ ness that could arise for his family , so Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i human rights groups who want to work in Ah@@ wa@@ z and remain anonymous . &quot;
a video shared on YouTube held the moments after he had kind@@ led himself .
&quot; some people quickly managed to extingu@@ ish the fl@@ ames , and Mor@@ amaz@@ i was brought to the Tal@@ eg@@ hani hospital in the city of Ah@@ wa@@ z . &quot;
according to local sources the burns were so strong that the doctors could do nothing more .
he died a short time later .
&quot; it was not the only su@@ icide that occurred in August within the Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i minority , and activists on the spot warn that even more men could take life . &quot;
&quot; Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i Centre for Human Rights reported that this month some others - Ham@@ id Mani@@ at , Ali Haz@@ ba@@ wi , S@@ ayed Fal@@ ah M@@ ous@@ sa@@ wi and Sh@@ ah@@ ab Ban@@ i Tam@@ im . &quot;
&quot; their stories have one thing in common : they were all family fathers who felt hel@@ pl@@ ess and incap@@ able of feeding their families , because of persecution by the Iranian government , hel@@ pl@@ ess and incap@@ able of carrying out their families . &quot;
&quot; Arabic Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i suffer from poverty , unemployment and discrimination &quot;
&quot; the region , in which a large part of the Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i community living in Iran , has been sh@@ aken by a profound economic crisis that makes it difficult for the native Arab population to deny its living . &quot;
&quot; in a century ago , the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ z was a predominantly autonomous region in Iran until the P@@ ahl@@ avi monarchy acquired power and made big efforts in 1925 to termin@@ ate ethnic autonomy in Iran . &quot;
&quot; in the Ah@@ wa@@ z region , there are some of the largest oil and gas fields in Iran , as well as some of the most valuable and most valuable useful areas for Iranian agriculture . &quot;
&quot; in spite of these valuable resources , the regional economy continues to develop slowly , and the local population receives little from this wealth . &quot;
&quot; it is often victims of untreated diseases , hunger and de@@ priv@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; the Iranian regime uses the Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i Arabs systematically jobs in the local oil , gas and petro@@ chemical industries . &quot;
&quot; the government has also built a variety of tr@@ unks , the waters of the Arab regions in the Persian areas , where the provinces are Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Y@@ az@@ d , Ker@@ man and G@@ ho@@ m . &quot;
these dam@@ s have only led to wor@@ sen the devast@@ ation caused in the region and destroy local agriculture as well as the fish and pal@@ ms industry .
the unemployment rate among the Arab a@@ Mo@@ haw@@ zi @-@ adol@@ escents now rose to 81 % .
&quot; N@@ our Mohammed P@@ ur , the Iranian general director for co@@ oper@@ atives , work and social welfare , reported that 5 % of Ah@@ w@@ az@@ is who have completed work , completed 55 % a secondary school and 45 % have a university degree . &quot;
a &quot; systematic strategy ... aims to destroy the spirit of national resistance &quot;
&quot; Kar@@ im Doh@@ im@@ i , an Iranian Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i human rights activ@@ ist with residence in London , told Global Vo@@ ices that the present situation , a mixture of poverty , unemployment and rac@@ ist ethnic discrimination , leads to a &quot; high rise &quot; of the number of su@@ icide among the young Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i males . &quot;
Doh@@ im@@ i said that especially unemployment has become worse . the reason for this is a combination of a high number of ethnic Per@@ sians and an anti @-@ Arab discrimination in the process of setting :
&quot; as officials and institutions prefer not to employ Arab workers , the local Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i will depri@@ ve of access to employment opportunities in all sectors . &quot;
&quot; this is part of a systematic policy of the ruling regime , aimed at destroying the spirit of national resistance of young Arabs and forcing them to earn their living from their homeland Ah@@ wa@@ z . &quot;
&quot; there are people who had to change their first name and sur@@ name to hide their belonging to Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i , as even Arab names at the workplace are not toler@@ ated , let alone the speaking of Arabic language or wearing Arab clothing . &quot;
&quot; given the circumstances that the Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i have to end@@ ure , human rights activ@@ ist alarm attacks before the situation is explosive . &quot;
it remains to be seen whether the world is w@@ aking up and aware of it .
the main reason for su@@ icide is untreated depression .
depression is treat@@ able and su@@ icide is avoid@@ able .

&quot; why I don &apos;t identify myself with femin@@ ism , even with the inter@@ sec@@ tional not &quot;
detail of a photo . recorded by : Pix@@ ab@@ ay . published under the CC@@ 0 Creative Commons License .
the following article is an revised version of the statement issued by Ay@@ om@@ ide Zur@@ i and originally published on Af@@ ro@@ f@@ é@@ min@@ as &apos;s website . the article was subject to several discussions where many different positions were expressed .
you can read in the comments below the original text .
&quot; if I say I am not a femin@@ ist , many women react - especially white women who call themselves as inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ale femin@@ ists - with fru@@ stration . &quot;
they wonder why I am not part of the movement .
they even put well thought @-@ out scientific and social arguments in front of me why I should be femin@@ ist and why we should be all femin@@ ist in general .
&quot; for example , women still earn less money in spite of equal education than men . &quot;
that women still stand still under strict observation when it comes to what they are allowed to do with their bodies .
violence against women is a global epide@@ mic .
&quot; or that cultural and social norms are still to ensure that women sooner or later come across a glass ceiling in various areas of life , and that discrimination on account of gender is still drawn across the many different countries and beliefs . &quot;
all this is aware and known to me .
I am convinced and I suffer double and thre@@ ef@@ ly below .
I am a black woman .
&quot; and yet : when I get to talk on skin color , on rac@@ ism , on black female women , on black women in the LGB@@ TI community or on black women from the Dias@@ por@@ a ; when I mention how we have always been ab@@ used under r@@ acial seg@@ reg@@ ation and discrimination , both in and outside the femin@@ ist movement , many white femin@@ ists , and white inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ists have been silent . &quot;
&quot; but nevertheless all agree that women - all women should come together in order to &quot; &quot; lift up their voices and &quot; &quot; K@@ umb@@ aya , my lord &quot; &quot; to achieve equal rights ( some ) of women . &quot;
&quot; but they don &apos;t want to talk about that in addition to sexu@@ alized violence , there is an institution@@ alised form of rac@@ ist motiv@@ ating violence that we are exposed to black women in two times . &quot;
&quot; in addition , black women and women of other eth@@ ni@@ cities and countries of origin deserve less than white men and women . &quot;
&quot; that black girls and girls with migration background are referred to school more often than white girls , due to obvious integration problems . &quot;
&quot; or that women in black spheres and women are exposed to a higher risk of mig@@ rant background , domestic violence and violence in partnership , as white women . &quot;
&quot; on the one hand , I want that all men and all men and all men should not have equal rights at all ; on the other hand , I can &apos;t connect myself as a black woman , in whose center is the white woman who ref@@ uses to take into account injus@@ tices in their thinking , which refers both to the sex and the skin color of a person . &quot;
I am exhausted and won &apos;t fight for my membership in a white @-@ femin@@ ist sphere that has always rejected me and countless other black women .
&quot; in 18@@ 51 So@@ jour@@ ner compl@@ ained in her speech , &quot; &quot; Am I not a wife ? &quot; &quot; and I also refuse to maintain an ideology in which the black woman is a poor and margin@@ alized being in historical terms . &quot;
&quot; I refuse to join group@@ ings , which also absor@@ bs our customs and customs through cultural inc@@ lin@@ ation , in order to advance their ego@@ centric program . &quot;
&quot; I will no longer try to suggest white women to suggest the importance of overl@@ apping of skin colour and sex . some of them will continue to silence the importance of black women for femin@@ ist movement , no matter how many black women try to reward them for the better . &quot;
&quot; although inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ism was founded in order to give women of different information a home and distinguish themselves from white femin@@ ism , the word &quot; femin@@ ism &quot; is still in its name . &quot;
&quot; I prefer to release myself fully and completely from femin@@ ism and to join the movement of wom@@ an@@ ism , which is so persistent for my dark skin and my status as a woman , which is so stu@@ b@@ born that inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality is celebrated as a novel phenomenon . &quot;
&quot; now it is more important than ever before , that we will define black women according to our own ideas and enter into the spheres which are created by us for us . &quot;
&quot; Cl@@ en@@ ora Hudson @-@ We@@ ems , the author of the book Afri@@ cana wom@@ anism : rec@@ laim@@ ing ourselves ( about : Africa @-@ Wom@@ an@@ ismus : as we rec@@ ap@@ ture ourselves ) speaks of how we can defend ourselves in this way , in which they are completely safe and in which the cultural , spiritual , spiritual , physical , and even the spiritual elements can be rever@@ ed to the black woman . &quot;
&quot; although some white and inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ists will immediately call separ@@ atism and exclusion , after reading these lines , I ask you to inform yourself about hypo@@ cris@@ y and the contradictions of femin@@ ist movement , of which the black woman is concerned . &quot;
&quot; in a wom@@ an@@ istic environment , I can lift up black women and women from other cultures , as in this paradig@@ m I exist . &quot;
I will be recognized as part of this paradig@@ m because of my dark skin and my existence as a woman .
&quot; I , a black woman , can blo@@ om in an environment where my life is neither exagger@@ ated nor ignored , nor rejected . &quot;
p@@ add@@ ling against pollution : the mission of a man to protect the rivers in Iraq for future generations
&quot; this post by To@@ dd Reu@@ bold was originally published on En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that reports in particular about international efforts to solve environmental problems . &quot;
&quot; as part of a content sharing agreement , this article will be published here again . &quot;
&quot; Nab@@ il Mus@@ a repeatedly travelled over the past 7 years , mostly with sur@@ f@@ board or in the can@@ oe - with a special concern through the Kur@@ dist@@ an region in Iraq . his mission aims to make people aware of the importance of clean waters for present and future generations . &quot;
in this documentary by E@@ mil@@ y Kin@@ sk@@ ey we follow Mus@@ a who explains his relationship with the rivers of the region and the impact of pollution on his church .
&quot; I wanted to do something for the river that we had lost when I was a child , &quot; Mus@@ a tells . &quot;
&quot; scientists from all over the country fear that the decades of war , the construction of dam@@ s , pollution and un@@ controlled development led to a direct water crisis in Iraq . &quot;
&quot; Mus@@ a is a member of the non @-@ governmental organisation Water@@ ke@@ epers Iraq - a subsidiary of Water@@ man Alliance - which is committed to protecting the rivers , streams and water@@ ways in Iraq , as well as supporting local communities in the sustainable use of these natural resources . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the video , Mus@@ a summar@@ izes the ur@@ gency and importance of his work in a matter : &quot; if we had no water , how would we survive ? &quot;
&quot; this video was fil@@ med and edited for En@@ sia by E@@ mil@@ y Kin@@ sk@@ ey , a documentary film based in Er@@ bil , in Iraq , and multimedia journ@@ alism . &quot;
&quot; the focus of her work lies on persec@@ uted , little appreci@@ ative sub@@ cultures and is characterized by the use of cooperative vide@@ ography and new multimedia techniques , with their help supp@@ ressed churches that can tell their stories in their way . &quot;
Paraguay &apos;s women and their difficult fight against violence

the following article is the shor@@ tened and edited version of the article &quot; The wave of violence against women in Paraguay &quot; by Kur@@ tural .
most names were changed to protect the affected individuals .
&quot; a police commission@@ er said A@@ da B@@ á@@ ez that she could do nothing against Luis Bal@@ bu@@ ena , her partner , who had become violent against her . &quot;
&quot; since the end of her relationship , some time had passed and the police said that her statement would be put to the files , but more could not be done . &quot;
&quot; as another Mrs. Bal@@ bu@@ ena showed for mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment , the acc@@ laimed display of A@@ da B@@ á@@ ez didn &apos;t use anything . &quot;
&quot; a few days later , the second woman returned to her ad . &quot;
breaking the vi@@ cious circle of violence against women is difficult .
&quot; if women ever display ads at all , they generally do not receive support from the state . &quot;
&quot; in many cases , women are also financi@@ ally dependent on men who abuse them . this also explains why only 20 % of all women who admit to be victims of violence can be reported at all in the law enforcement authorities . &quot;
&quot; content 1 Strike and Statisti@@ c 2 In@@ visible mal@@ functions and a legal system that does not under@@ line Paraguay &apos;s laws : good approach , defective implementation pun@@ ches and statistics &quot;
&quot; it is difficult to determine how many women really are ab@@ used , says My@@ rian Gon@@ z@@ á@@ lez , researcher for gender questions at Centro de Docum@@ ent@@ aci@@ ón y E@@ studios , a social science research institution in Paraguay . &quot;
&quot; however , the numbers available are al@@ ar@@ ming . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 , there were 9@@ 600 ads for domestic violence at the At@@ tor@@ ney Office . at 70 % of this , there was violence against women . &quot;
86 % of the ads in the police came from women .
there were more than 5000 ads due to domestic violence in the peace courts . here too 86 % of women &apos;s ads arrived here .
&quot; in the ads , 40 % of women claimed that they were physically mi@@ stre@@ ated , 55 % of women spoke of psych@@ ic abuse . &quot;
&quot; however , these statistics do not show the true extent of violence against women in Paraguay . &quot;
&quot; according to the Paragu@@ ay@@ an women &apos;s minister Ana Bai@@ ardi , only a few of these crimes are actually shown . &quot; &quot; for every woman who is ref@@ unded in Paraguay because of psych@@ ic abuse , 9 women who do not do this . &quot;
&quot; on any woman , which is ref@@ unded because of physical abuse , two women who do not do so , declared it at the end of 2014 . &quot;
&quot; because women &apos;s murder in Paraguay is not an own criminal record , the prosecution authorities cannot adequ@@ ately document how many women are murdered by their current or former partners every year . &quot;
&quot; only until August 2016 , journalists counted at least 12 cases of su@@ icide in the country . &quot;
the Co@@ ordin@@ ator for Human Rights in Paraguay documented at least 37 cases where women were murdered by their current or former partners .
according to their estimates in Paraguay every ten days a woman dies because of violence by men .

invisible mal@@ functions and a legal system that under@@ takes nothing
&quot; before Mari@@ ana Br@@ í@@ te@@ z was the firm friend of Carlos Vera , he insist@@ ed that she called him the name of all her former friends . &quot;
&quot; in the beginning she didn &apos;t want to do that , but then she said . &quot;
&quot; today , Mari@@ ana is 28 years old and no longer with Carlos . but for two years she earned the mental force on the one hand - one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time the most difficult recogni@@ zable : &quot;
I never thought I would be a victim of ill @-@ treatment .
&quot; when I read it earlier , I always thought that only women are going to be sub@@ mis@@ sive because they let themselves be decei@@ ved by violent men . &quot;
I was convinced that this would never happen to me .
Mari@@ ana used social media to report about the abuse by Carlos Vera .
&quot; without name , she wrote posts on Facebook in which she described his ins@@ ults and various attacks during her two @-@ year relationship and told how he had isolated her . &quot;
&quot; many people responded to their contributions , including Carlos himself . he asked rh@@ et@@ or@@ ical if he ever raised his hand against them and refused to admit that his behaviour was also a form of ill @-@ treatment . &quot;
other Facebook users asked Mari@@ ana why they had fallen by Carlos for so long and did not leave it earlier .
&quot; it seemed almost like they wanted to say that victims of abuse , at least , had a certain complic@@ ity in it . &quot;
&quot; Victoria San@@ tos , which was not from Paraguay , fought almost eight years with the authorities in Paraguay to prove that her former partner she had been ill @-@ treated . &quot;
Victoria is a member of the Y@@ o te cre@@ o network ( I believe you &quot; ) that consists of women who are all victims of abuse .
&quot; in the group , they can talk to others about their experiences , listen to each other and support each other . &quot;
they do what many others do not do : they take the statements of women seriously .
in Vict@@ ori@@ as case everything started with psych@@ ic mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment .
her wealthy partner finally managed to convince her that she was worth@@ less .
then he began to beat them .
&quot; Vict@@ ori@@ as ads with the authorities remained without result and also from their relatives , they did not get any support . &quot;
&quot; it led a process against its former partner who developed into an imper@@ cep@@ tible j@@ uri@@ di@@ cal struggle between Paraguay and its home country , in which it was mainly about money , power and the influence of her former partner . &quot;
&quot; Paragu@@ ays La@@ ws : good approach , in@@ adequate implementation &quot;
&quot; in Paraguay there are many laws that are very good , but not being applied . &quot;
&quot; the display of abuse is a way full of resistance and a fight against corruption in the judi@@ ci@@ ary , &quot; says Victoria San@@ tos . &quot;
&quot; Carmen Ech@@ au@@ ri , a representative of the UN organization for women in Paraguay , also sees great problems in applying the laws in the country . &quot;
&quot; on 10 August 2016 , a bill was discussed in the Par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an Parliament , which was known under the h@@ ash@@ tag # Por@@ el@@ las ( # for@@ ge ) . &quot;
this h@@ ash@@ tag and the Movement # Ni@@ Un@@ a@@ Men@@ os ( # Non@@ Ein@@ e@@ Wen@@ iger ) are part of a campaign on Twitter supported by Am@@ ne@@ sty International .
the original draft of the law fores@@ ees to explain Fem@@ izi@@ d into an independent criminal case and pun@@ ish har@@ dens as it is already in the neighbouring countries of Argentina and Bolivia .
&quot; in this way , the legisl@@ ated text was changed in some respects , in order to prevent the de@@ crimin@@ alisation of abor@@ tions , which is generally forbidden in Paraguay and sentenced to five years imprisonment . &quot;
&quot; the original bill had planned , the majority of the ( bureaucr@@ atic and economic ) proced@@ ural costs that have to bear the victims of violence at the present time , if they simply reimbur@@ se themselves and would like to receive a safe place to impose the state . &quot;
Ech@@ au@@ ri argu@@ ed that the law is not effective if the legisl@@ ature does not provide sufficient financial resources for it :
in Paraguay mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment is seen as part of inter@@ personal relationships .
&quot; here , a re@@ thinking must take place so that violence is no longer considered something normal . &quot;
&quot; who is silent about these facts , complic@@ ates and contributes to the fact that the perpet@@ rators will escape . &quot;
we have to refund for a long time until mal@@ treatment is no longer considered normal .
&quot; on 10 November 2016 , the law was adopted in the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an Senate . previously , parts of the law had been changed . &quot;
the opinions on the changes are dealt with .
the section concerning reconciliation was seen as an opportunity for the aggres@@ sor to attack his victim again .
&quot; the fil@@ ing of words &quot; gender , &quot; &quot; political force &quot; and &quot; sexual har@@ ass@@ ment &quot; from parts of the law applies however as a great set@@ back . &quot;
this article is the shor@@ tened and edited version of the article &quot; The wave of violence against women in Paraguay &quot; by Kur@@ tural .

independent media in Oman another year after the ban of a newspaper continue to attack attacks
&quot; this website was blocked due to a resolution issued by the Minister of Information &quot; &quot; on the homepage of the forbidden newspaper Az@@ am@@ n . &quot;
&quot; more than one year ago , the Hungarian authorities have closed the independent Arabic @-@ language newspaper Az@@ am@@ n because of their reporting on corruption in the sult@@ ant . &quot;
&quot; You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j , one of the editors of the newspaper , is still in prison , where he is a prison term . &quot;
&quot; two other editors of Az@@ am@@ n , I@@ bra@@ him Al @-@ Ma@@ amar@@ i and zah@@ er Al @-@ Abr@@ i , were also arrested and placed in court , but later returned . &quot;
&quot; Oman has been ruled by Sult@@ an Q@@ ab@@ us i@@ bn S@@ aid , who came to power after having completed his father , S@@ aid i@@ bn T@@ aim@@ ur , by a coup d &quot; é@@ tat . &quot;
&quot; since then , he has been suffering as the only Sult@@ an , the most important offices in the country : Prime Minister , Defence Minister , Supreme Commander of the Ar@@ med Forces , Minister of Foreign Affairs , Foreign Minister , Chairman of the Supreme Council for the Planning and President of the Central Bank . &quot;
&quot; the Sult@@ an &apos;s rule is characterized by the persist@@ ing efforts of security forces , in particular the domestic secret service , restric@@ ting public fre@@ edoms , including press freedom , including press freedom , blo@@ gger and other activists , to be inti@@ mid@@ ated and im@@ pris@@ oned . &quot;
&quot; the authorities limit peaceful and legitimate activities in the field of human rights systematically and hin@@ der citizens , including activists , to express their views on public affairs of the country , such as corruption in authorities and institutions , both online and offline . &quot;
&quot; the attack on the Az@@ am@@ n newspaper , its closure and the imprisonment three of its editors last year is a hard blow to press freedom in the country . &quot;
Az@@ am@@ n is an independent newspaper reported on corruption in Oman since its foundation in 2007 until it was banned by the authorities in August 2016 .
&quot; on 28 July 2016 , security forces I@@ bra@@ him Al @-@ Ma@@ amar@@ i , chief editor of Az@@ am@@ n , fixed an article entitled &quot; High @-@ level parties &quot; hands of the judi@@ ci@@ ary . &quot;
&quot; in the report , government officials accused of having put judges of the Supreme Court in Oman under pressure to raise a ver@@ dict in an inheritance dispute . &quot;
&quot; issue of the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n on July 26 , 2016 with a report on the title page with the heading : &quot; high @-@ ranking parties bind hands to justice . &quot; &quot;
photo source : Facebook page of Az@@ am@@ n
&quot; on 3 August 2016 , zah@@ er Al @-@ Abr@@ i , member of the editorial board , was charged by ISS before the special department and arrested by the security forces upon his arrival . &quot;
&quot; on 9 August 2016 , the ISS took the dep@@ uty head @-@ editor You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j , who had acted as editor @-@ in @-@ chief after Al @-@ Ma@@ amar@@ is arrest . &quot;
&quot; the newspaper was closed inde@@ fin@@ itely after the Minister of Information had given the statement that &quot; the publication and dis@@ semination of the newspaper is prohibited on any way , including online , from 9 August 2016 . &quot;
&quot; on 26 September 2016 , the first trial took place in Mas@@ kat &apos;s trial against Al @-@ Ma@@ amar@@ i , Al @-@ Ha@@ j and Al @-@ Abr@@ i . &quot;
the Court sentenced the three journalists to prison sentences and also ordered the final closing of the newspaper .
&quot; al @-@ Ma@@ amar@@ i and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were both condemned , among other things , because of distur@@ b@@ ance of the public order , &quot; abuse of the Internet &quot; and &quot; under@@ mining of the state . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in addition , Al @-@ Ha@@ j was found guilty of a violation of a prohibition of publication and s@@ lander . &quot;
&quot; al @-@ Ma@@ amar@@ i and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were sentenced to three years of imprisonment and fin@@ es in the amount of 3,000 Messi@@ anic Ri@@ al ( 7@@ 800 US dollars ) . &quot;
&quot; al @-@ Abr@@ i was sentenced to a year of imprisonment and a fine of 1000 Ri@@ al ( 2,@@ 600 US dollars ) after he was found guilty of the use of &quot; an information network for the dis@@ semination of material that could pose a threat to public order . &quot; &quot;
&quot; for Al @-@ Abr@@ i a damages deposit of 5,000 om@@ an Ri@@ al ( 13 000 US dollars ) was arrested and he was released from prison on 22 August 2016 . &quot;
&quot; the Appe@@ als Court rejected Al @-@ Abr@@ i at a hearing on 26 December 2016 , but Al @-@ Ha@@ j sentenced to six months in prison for one year and Al @-@ Ma@@ amar@@ i . &quot;
al @-@ Ma@@ amar@@ i was dismis@@ sed from central prison on 10 April 2017 . al @-@ Ha@@ j is still in prison where he stab@@ bed his imprisonment sentence .
the Appe@@ als Court also highlighted the decision of the Ministry of Information to close the newspaper &quot; Az@@ am@@ n . &quot;
&quot; despite the decision of the Court to allow Az@@ am@@ n again , the newspaper looks like attacks by the om@@ an government . &quot;
&quot; on 8 January , the Minister of Information issued a statement with which the closing of &quot; &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; &quot; was extended for three months . &quot;
&quot; on 8 May 2017 , the Minister of Information personally signed a further statement in which the closing of &quot; &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; &quot; was extended by three additional months and with which the Minister presented himself once more against the decision of the Appe@@ als Court , to restore the publication of the newspaper . &quot;
the permanent closure of Az@@ am@@ n and the attacks on journalists of the newspaper are not the only cases in which Oman has been viol@@ ated in recent times the freedom of the press .
&quot; other injuries include the closure of the website of the Independent magazine M@@ ow@@ atin and the exercise of pressure on Al@@ bal@@ ad , the first independent online newspaper of the country to cease operation . &quot;
&quot; due to the continuous closure of the Az@@ am@@ n and the det@@ ention of journalist Al @-@ Ha@@ j , the impression that the Iranian authorities are still not ready to end the extensive violation of press freedom . &quot;
&quot; the Gulf Centre for Human Rights ( Gulf Centre for Human Rights , G@@ CH@@ R ) calls for the Italian authorities to : &quot;
1 . how to release You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j immediately and un@@ condition@@ ally ;
2. create a safe environment for the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n so that their journalists can follow their work ;
3 . to protect the freedom of the press in the country and
&quot; 4 . under all circumstances ensure that human rights def@@ enders and journalists in Oman have imp@@ eded their legitimate human rights work without fear of ret@@ ali@@ ation , including judicial cl@@ ots . &quot;
&quot; the Gulf Centre for Human Rights ( Gulf Center for Human Rights , G@@ CH@@ R ) is an independent , non @-@ profit and non @-@ governmental organization that supports human rights def@@ enders ( also independent journalists , blog@@ gers , lawyers , etc . ) in the Gulf region and the right to gather peace and provide protection . &quot;

medical research in Africa : opportunities and mis@@ understand@@ ings
Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier 2016 in Zambia takes place with his consent
medical research in Africa is rarely mentioned in the media . it is a growing area that addresses one of the most urgent needs of the continent .
&quot; there are two reasons for the need for medical research conducted on site : firstly , there are many medicines and vacc@@ ines to cover the special medical need on the African continent . &quot;
&quot; diseases such as AIDS , tu@@ ber@@ cu@@ lo@@ sis and mal@@ aria are far more serious in the poor@@ est countries of Africa than elsewhere , and lack of investments for the research of these diseases by the pharmaceutical companies are a major problem . &quot;
&quot; second , research , which is carried out by African scientists , helps build its own research capacities in Africa . a larger role in science and technology can only be condu@@ ci@@ ve to the economic growth of the continent . &quot;
&quot; Dr. Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier is Director of the Central Department at the Centre for Inf@@ ectious Disease Research in Zambia ( Centre for Inf@@ ectious Disease Research in Zambia , CI@@ DR@@ Z ) . &quot;
&quot; he grew up in Lus@@ aka , Zambia in the 1990s , especially when the AIDS epide@@ mic showed the first serious impact on national health . &quot;
&quot; he left Zambia for a study in the United States , first in Lou@@ is@@ iana , later in Indi@@ ana . &quot;
&quot; as a Post@@ doc at the University of Pennsylvania , he was resear@@ ching HIV virus before he decided to go back home to support the Serbian healthcare system . &quot;
&quot; with Global Vo@@ ices , Dr. war@@ rier discussed the future of medical research in Zambia and about mis@@ understand@@ ings of the media about this research . &quot;
( Disclaimer : Dr. War@@ rier speaks as a private person ) .
global Vo@@ ices ( GV ) : what is your research topic ?
Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier RW : at the moment my work focuses on the application of research results . I support the Serbian national program for anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy ( ART ) with laboratory tests .
&quot; in addition , I just launched a research program for the development of molecular diagnostic tests for HIV , TB and other relevant path@@ o@@ gens . &quot;
Q : what are your opinion about the important current science topics in your country and in general in Africa ?
how do they differ from those in Western countries ?
RW : there are no basic research here . we only use solutions that have been developed elsewhere .
&quot; this has to change , otherwise we will always remain recipient instead of being M@@ acher . &quot;
&quot; the solutions we get are often not suitable in our environment , and sometimes it is even impossible to use them here . &quot;
GM : where does financing and support come from ?
is it sufficient ?
how simple or difficult is it to find suitable scientists for the projects ?
RW : from the USA and Europe .
the projects are supported differently well .
&quot; it is difficult to find people who want to come back or go here , as financing and development chances are better in other countries . &quot;
GM : how is the research infrastructure ?
which obstacles are there in your routine research work you did not previously had ?
&quot; RW : the basic infrastructure does not meet the standards in developed countries . it costs a lot of money to have a continuous supply of electricity , water and internet . &quot;
&quot; laboratory material is expensive , and it takes months to import it from other countries . &quot;
GM : what is the opinion of the public about science and scientists in Africa ?
&quot; RW : there are already interest , but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods . &quot;
I would suggest that critical thinking and scientific methods should be taught in schools to improve the situation .
&quot; GM : how big is your opinion the potential of scientific research in Africa , what should it focus and how can we support development ? &quot;
RW : the potential is amazing .
I have seen great students of all ages .
&quot; there is need for special scientific training , starting at any age . &quot;
&quot; social sciences , computer science , big data , study of space , health care ( non @-@ transfer@@ able and cont@@ ag@@ ious diseases ) and efficiency of traditional medicine will benefit from this . &quot;
Q : can you describe the advantages and dis@@ advantages of life as a scientist in Africa towards Western countries based on your experience ?
&quot; RW : often , it is the limited speed to do things , and the difficult access to scientific expertise that challenges these challenges . &quot;
&quot; the system that magazines are only accessible against payment ( the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; Pay@@ wall &quot; &quot; ) , also limited the amount of available information and the speed of research . &quot;
from the USA to India : how &quot; open source &quot; seed producers change global food production
&quot; this post by Rachel C@@ ern@@ an@@ sky was originally published on the website En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine which reports about solutions for environmental problems worldwide . &quot;
Frank Mort@@ on has been bred in the USA since the 1980s .
&quot; its company offers 114 varieties , such as Out@@ fit , the first plant that has been cultivated and consumed by NA@@ SA a@@ stron@@ au@@ ts in space . &quot;
&quot; for almost 20 years , Mort@@ on &apos;s work was limited only by its own sei@@ z@@ ure and the question of how many sal@@ ads it can get . &quot;
&quot; but at the beginning of the 200@@ 0s , he noted that more and more sal@@ ads were patented and that he could not use them further for breeding . &quot;
&quot; patents g@@ aged not only for individual varieties , but also for certain properties , such as resistance to disease , special red or green or curved leaves . &quot;
&quot; in recent years more and more such patents have been registered to more and more plants such as cer@@ eal or cardboard varieties . due to this trend , plant bre@@ eders , environ@@ ment@@ alists and experts ensure food security for the future of food production . &quot;
&quot; as a passionate representative of a mill@@ en@@ nia @-@ old tradition , Mort@@ on still preser@@ ves salad , but it takes longer since his work becomes more and more complicated by ever more restrictions . &quot;
it is as if in a river a b@@ oulder is lying around which I must d@@ ull .
&quot; so we have to do this now , but it &apos;s a break with the breeding tradition , &quot; he says . &quot; I think these patents go too far . &quot;
&quot; and if they stand before judgment , no one can breed a new kind of salad because all features are already patented . &quot;
&quot; however , he is very careful and endeav@@ ored to use no material protected as intellectual property . &quot;
he has also joined a movement that is getting bigger in the USA and everywhere in the world : open Source Bre@@ eding ( &quot; Open Source &quot; breeding ) .
a@@ stron@@ au@@ ts of the International Space Station ISS have bred and eaten red ro@@ ast salad of the variety Out@@ fit in the &quot; greenhouse &quot; of the station . there it is tested whether plants can be grown in space .
photo : NA@@ SA
it is no coinci@@ dence that this name sounds rather as if the movement from the IT sector would come from and not from the field of plant breeding .
the Open Source Se@@ ed Initiative ( initiative for &quot; open source &quot; seeds ) is inspired by the free &quot; open source &quot; software that provides alternatives to copy@@ ri@@ ghted software .
it was launched in order to ensure that some plant species and genes are not protected as intellectual property and are thus permanently usable for plant bre@@ eders .
&quot; within the framework of the initiative , called short Os@@ si , US bre@@ eders can commit themselves to free use of the seeds they bred . &quot;
&quot; however , this does not mean that they do not continue to do business with their seeds and sell it . &quot; open source &quot; bre@@ eders only allow others to breed their seeds , and not immediately trop@@ hies - two aspects that are banned or prescribed by many plant patents . &quot;
dozens of bre@@ eders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since its launch in 2014 .
glo@@ omy views
&quot; Professor at the University of Wis@@ cons@@ in @-@ Ma@@ di@@ son and Os@@ si board member Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg have control over the seeds and the opportunity to breed new plants , both important for food security and environmental protection . &quot;
&quot; according to seed , seed plays a role in larger contex@@ ts such as biodiversity , rights of farmers , control over the food system and use of chemicals in agriculture . independent bre@@ eders would try to use the latter not or only little by breeding seed with natural resistance . &quot;
Klo@@ pp@@ enburg stresses that the &quot; open source &quot; movement does not deal with gene@@ tically modified plants .
&quot; all kinds of plants could be patented , whether vegetables , grain , gene@@ tically modified or not , from ecological agriculture or not . &quot;
food sovereignty without seed sovereignty is not possible . &quot;
the members of the Open Source Se@@ ed Initiative are committed to keep their seeds available free of charge .
photo by Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg .
&quot; Os@@ si supporters argue that the future of food supply is endangered as the available gene pool is due to the increasingly numerous intellectual property rights on plant material , which is thus becoming increasingly available , continuously shr@@ ink . &quot;
&quot; Cla@@ ire Lu@@ by , executive director of Os@@ si , has engaged in her PhD thesis with a genetic variation in car@@ rots and their availability . &quot;
&quot; for other plants , there are not such estimates , but experts like Lu@@ by susp@@ ect that mas@@ sively grown plants like wheat are still pat@@ inated in a larger style than let@@ tu@@ ce or car@@ rots . &quot;
a question of view
plants are cultivated so that they can target targeted characteristics - from those through which their taste or color improves through to such because they thri@@ ve in certain environments and resist threats such as p@@ ests or diseases .
&quot; opponents of patents on plant properties point out that the available plant material for bre@@ eders is increasing by more and more patents . currently , genetic diversity is more unnecessary than ever since the changed conditions by climate change are much worse predic@@ table . &quot;
&quot; in an email , Mon@@ san@@ to spokes@@ person Car@@ ly S@@ ca@@ du@@ to recognis@@ es that genetic diversity is generally important and crucial for Mon@@ san@@ to &apos;s activities . &quot;
&quot; however , it contradic@@ ts that intellectual property holds other bre@@ eders , as &quot; patents and the protection of plant variations innovation promote . &quot; &quot; a patent is basically a plan that everyone can follow as soon as the patent has ex@@ pi@@ red . &quot;
often these instructions help others to come with another method to the same result .
&quot; such protection does not inhi@@ bit innovation , but promotes them by making more material and know @-@ how available to the public . &quot;
&quot; Mort@@ on looks different : 20 years to wait , until a patent exp@@ ires , certainly does not promote innovations . &quot;
&quot; and if you have to wait so long to breed plants that have been adapted to the changed environment conditions , you would have lost the struggle already . &quot;
&quot; however , the main argument for Mort@@ on is that genetic resources have always been a general good and should remain : &quot; independent plant bre@@ eders do not have time nor money for such form@@ alities , and monetary incen@@ tives are not attractive for us . &quot;
we want to make farmers their work easier .
&quot; this is what drives us , and it becomes impossible for us to continue to use the best and newest genetic resources . &quot;
&quot; overall , Mort@@ on interfer@@ es with the concept of pat@@ enting plant features : &quot; we don &apos;t really create the characteristics themselves . &quot;
&quot; the plants form it themselves , and as bre@@ eders , we have no idea how the plants do that . &quot;
a mystery of nature . &quot;
&quot; for C@@ aro@@ l Dep@@ pe , plant bre@@ eders in the US State Oregon and Os@@ si board member , there is another important aspect of plant breeding : &quot; those who breed a variety also breed his own values into them . &quot;
those who believe in industrial agriculture with large farms and mono@@ cultures are required for their cultivation of mas@@ cul@@ ine her@@ b@@ ici@@ des that breed in its varieties of this concept of agriculture .
my concept is exactly opposite . &quot;
&quot; while some medium @-@ sized companies ( such as Mon@@ san@@ to are ) patents , most smaller seed companies , even without survi@@ ving patents - they either reject pat@@ enting or they consider it too expensive and therefore not re@@ warding or both is the case . &quot;
the independent plant bre@@ eder Frank Mort@@ on is looking for sal@@ ads in his breeding garden .

&quot; Mort@@ on also believes that bre@@ eders would be more innovative by avoiding plant pat@@ enting : &quot; &quot; it looks like I am with my efforts to produce something new , stronger than companies that patented . &quot;
&quot; I need constantly new material for my catalogue , since I know that my competitors are selling my varieties in a few years themselves , &quot; he says . &quot; with a patent , you are protected for 20 years before competition , so that in my opinion it is quite easy . &quot;
&quot; although the USA seem to be leaders in the &quot; open source &quot; breeding , the concept is now spreading rapidly across the globe . &quot;
&quot; in India , the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture ( &quot; Centre for Sustainable Agriculture &quot; ) , which describes itself as a professional organization in the field of resources , is a &quot; open source &quot; seed programme . &quot;
it also assi@@ sts them to come to &quot; Open Source &quot; seeds and sell their own .
&quot; the German organization Agre@@ col is working on an open source license , which is ultimately a form of formal and legally binding form of the Os@@ si obligation for bre@@ eders in the European Union . &quot;
&quot; ( regulations for breeding differ from country to country , thus the Os@@ si obligation cannot simply be taken over one in Europe or other parts of the world . ) &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of November 2016 , the executive of the European Union , the European Commission , declares that conven@@ tionally bred plants should not be pat@@ ent@@ able . thus , she speaks against the current practice of the European Patent Office , which permits patents on conven@@ tionally bred plants . &quot;
&quot; however , an explanation is not a law ; now it is to the governments of the Member States to bring the Patent Office to implement this new line . &quot;
&quot; in October 2016 , the Dutch organisation Hi@@ v@@ os organized a conference on &quot; open source &quot; seed systems in Ethiopia , farmers , operators of seed banks and representatives of governments , non @-@ governmental organisations and seed companies from all over East Africa to learn about the &quot; open source &quot; seed movement and the global trend towards the pat@@ enting of seeds . &quot;
&quot; Willy Dou@@ ma , responsible for the Hi@@ v@@ os &apos; program for &quot; open source &quot; seed systems , declares that the organization is currently building a global alliance for &quot; open source &quot; seed systems , for the planned next year of official start @-@ up . &quot;
&quot; an association of environmental protection and development aid groups ( including Hi@@ v@@ os , the international non@@ profit development aid organization US@@ C Canada and the action group on ero@@ sion , Technology and Con@@ centr@@ ation ) has compiled a database of seeds and biodiversity worldwide to publish the Se@@ ed Map Project , a seed map . &quot;
&quot; in September , the Global Alliance for the Future of Food , the global alliance for the future of eating - a network of aid organizations such as the W@@ K Kel@@ log@@ g Foundation , the Mc@@ Knight Foundation and others - has published a report . &quot;
&quot; the report also emphas@@ ises the importance of a diverse , local supply of seeds for sustainable food systems - a context that Lu@@ by von Os@@ si hopes that soon more people will be recognized . &quot;
&quot; the movement for regional and ecological foods particularly focused on where and how something is cultivated , and seed systems have hardly played a role , &quot; says Lu@@ by . &quot; we are now trying to make people clear@@ er that there is even more behind their food . &quot;

human rights organization and blog are the newest goals of cens@@ or@@ ship in Egypt
the Egyptian authorities still un@@ lock content on the internet .
this time it met the website of a human rights organization and the blog of a colum@@ n@@ ist .
&quot; on the weekend of the 5th of August , the Egyptian government blocked the website of the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information ( AN@@ HR@@ I ) , which documents human rights violations in Egypt and the Arab world . &quot;
&quot; in August , the network published an opinion on Facebook where the Egyptian authorities critic@@ ised this step and promised to continue the work and efforts of human rights in the region . &quot;
&quot; the Arabic Network for Human Rights information remains committed to defending freedom of expression and human rights in the Arab world , so it has never been as important as it is now . AN@@ HR@@ I has never been as important as it is now . AN@@ HR@@ I has never been as important as it is now . we ins@@ ist on fulfilling our task . &quot;
&quot; AN@@ HR@@ I is regarded as the first licensed website of a human rights organization in Egypt , after the authorities blocked 21 websites more than two months ago , including the independent news site M@@ ada Mas@@ r , Arabic @-@ language edition of the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post and the Al J@@ az@@ e@@ era network from Qatar due to alleged &quot; support of terrorism . &quot;
# Egypt : 1 . human rights organisation of the wave of web site locks to victims . @ an@@ hr@@ i one of the main data sources for human rights in Arabic language https : / / t.@@ co / NI@@ Z@@ m@@ Op@@ DS@@ 5@@ K
&quot; in addition to AN@@ HR@@ I , the blog of the colum@@ ni@@ sts and human rights researcher Ah@@ med Gam@@ al Zi@@ ada has no access to Egypt . &quot;
&quot; Zi@@ ada used his blog for the dis@@ semination of columns and articles , which he writes for in Egypt not accessible websites and media . &quot;
&quot; now the blog you set up in order to circum@@ vent the cens@@ or@@ ship of the Egyptian government , even the goal of an attack . &quot;
&quot; blog@@ gers , the provider of which is also home to Zi@@ adas blog , is further accessible . &quot;
&quot; Zi@@ ada , a former photo journalist , spent nearly 500 days in captivity after he reported in December 2013 by Egyptian security forces while he reported about the student protests and recorded a video how the police exercised physical violence against two students . &quot;
his articles revol@@ ve mainly around politics and the human rights situation in Egypt .
&quot; in a Facebook comment , Zi@@ ada commented on the blocking through the government and reflected what this means for him : &quot;
&quot; to block blogs is very old , however , in the era of Ab@@ del@@ fat@@ tah al @-@ S@@ isi , priority ; and even if the blocking of blogs may not be significant for the world , then it is for two reasons for me : &quot;
&quot; 1 ) It is possible to give me the feeling of a si@@ ege of si@@ ege , an arrest , an attempt of murder , loading at the National Security Council , blocking blogs as well as any other web page for which I worked . &quot;
&quot; 2 ) You have proven that I did not write for nothing . in other words , my words have influence , though only to a small audience . &quot;
I want to mention that this blog was an archive for me .
first I used it to post articles in order to circum@@ vent the cens@@ or@@ ship .
&quot; but now , after they have locked him and that they are afraid of words , I still can change the link or create a second blog . &quot;
the cour@@ age@@ ous will follow the path up to the end .
&quot; according to the Association for Freedom of Th@@ ought and Expression ( AF@@ TE ) , Egyptian authorities blocked from 24 May to 06 August 133 websites . this resulted in technical tests on the networks of various Internet Service Provi@@ ders ( ISP ) , including Orange , Vod@@ af@@ one and Eti@@ sal@@ at . &quot;
&quot; AF@@ TE also documented the blocking of providers , possible through the conversion of internet cens@@ or@@ ship and private surfing , so called Virtual Private Networks ( V@@ PN@@ s ) &quot;
AF@@ TE reported in her research :
&quot; on Monday , 12 June we noticed how the blocking of web pages that V@@ PN@@ s began . &quot;
such a practice points to the government &apos;s intention to continue blocking and filtering the content on which Egyptian users could have access .
&quot; the situation is additionally exac@@ erb@@ ated by the fact that the cens@@ or@@ ship decisions are made behind closed doors , whereby the Egyptian population has no legal basis , with which it can proceed against trial against these actions . &quot;
now the question arises : how far is the Egyptian government ready to go with cens@@ or@@ ship and who will attack it next ?
is Rio de Janeiro in war ?

&quot; day by day newspapers in Brazil with glo@@ omy head@@ lines from Rio de Janeiro , the second largest city in the country and home of numerous postcard motifs . &quot;
some of these head@@ lines are as follows :
&quot; 14 @-@ year @-@ old shot in school , &quot; &quot; E@@ very second day a police officer in Rio de Janeiro has assass@@ inated , &quot; &quot; thi@@ eves smoke pharmacy with military weapons , &quot; &quot; President Tem@@ er sends 8@@ 500 soldiers of the army , Navy and Air Force to Rio . &quot;
&quot; in the middle of the economic crisis and in a ten@@ se financial situation , the wave of violence in Rio reached the highest level in Rio for 10 years . &quot;
the Brazilian non @-@ governmental organisation Global Justice even called the United Nations to interv@@ ene .
reports like these have become everyday and this is un@@ acceptable &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; at least find the manager of a local newspaper .
&quot; the magazine &quot; &quot; Extra &quot; &quot; published for the detailed coverage of violence in Rio on 16 August published the editorial &quot; &quot; This is not normal &quot; &quot; in which she announced a new section called &quot; &quot; War in Rio &quot; . &quot; &quot;
all reports on violence in the city are now published there .
the motives for their decision explained the paper as follows :
&quot; it will continue to report about crimes that happen in every metropolis on the world such as murder , rob@@ ber@@ y , sexual breach , etc . everything , however , devi@@ ates from the civili@@ zed standard and what happened only in Rio will be published in the section &quot; &quot; War in Rio &quot; . &quot; ( ... ) This is our way to call : this is not normal ! &quot;
this is the only alternative so that we as journalists do not close our eyes to cru@@ el@@ ty .
&quot; in a four @-@ minute video shared on Facebook , Oc@@ t@@ á@@ vio Gu@@ edes , editor @-@ in @-@ chief of the newspaper declared that this decision was not an occasion for pride , but rather a sign of failure : &quot;
extra is probably the only newspaper around the world with a ru@@ bri@@ k in a country that does not recognise the war at all .
&quot; in the same video , a journalist of the newspaper explains that according to the Institute for Internal Security in Rio de Janeiro , there are 8@@ 43 areas controlled by criminal organisations . &quot;
&quot; in the editorial article , the newspaper writes : &quot;
&quot; we are aware that a war discourse , when it is distor@@ ted , can also be used to cover atro@@ cities of the police , who only sho@@ ots and then ask questions to cover . &quot;
&quot; but we defend the war based on information and the fight against corruption in the police , whose aim is not the civilian population , but the economic power of the Maf@@ ia and its partners . &quot;
does the term &quot; war &quot; harm more than it ?
&quot; in an article on the news portal The Inter@@ cept Brasil , the journalist Cec@@ í@@ lia Oli@@ v@@ eira argu@@ ed to design@@ ate the violence as a &quot; war . &quot; &quot;
this is not a war .
&quot; this is the result of corruption and poor planning - as an extra in the analysis of military operations in Rio itself - in combination with insufficient investments in personnel , education and a historical and self @-@ sufficient negl@@ ect of public service . &quot;
to remember : the state of Rio de Janeiro is bigger than just his capital .

&quot; according to Cec@@ í@@ lia , Rio de Janeiro is wrong : &quot; 22 of the 30 most violent cities in Brazil lie according to statistics of 2015 in the north and north @-@ east of the country . these are the most up @-@ to @-@ date data . &quot;
none of these cities is located in the federal state of Rio de Janeiro .
&quot; if we look at the mor@@ ale rates per state , Rio is in place 16 , &quot; she writes . &quot;
&quot; extra belongs to the company Glob@@ o , the largest media company in South America , that , as Cec@@ í@@ lia stresses , has been repe@@ ating the state &apos;s security policy for many years . &quot;
&quot; these security policy measures also included the founding of the U@@ PP ( Uni@@ da@@ de de Pol@@ í@@ cia Paci@@ fic@@ ad@@ ora ) , a police unit established by the Federal State of Rio in 2003 , whose aim is to conquer a F@@ av@@ ela by employing a massive police record and permanently station@@ ing a unit there . &quot;
&quot; in the beginning , this actually led to a decrease of violent death cases . for several years , the U@@ PP has become increasingly under attack after several reports on chic@@ ane and re@@ pres@@ sions against the poor communities who were supposed to protect the newly created police unit . &quot;
&quot; on his Facebook page , the journalist Jo@@ ão Paulo Char@@ le@@ aux cited from one of his articles from 2010 in which he explains why violence in Rio does not meet the criteria set out by the Geneva Convention - criteria for the term &quot; civil war . &quot; &quot;
he writes :
&quot; in addition to legal issues , the classification of the situation in Rio as a war also draws serious consequences for the people . &quot;
&quot; this requires the state to use means and paths that are typical of a war . for this , penetration into the territory of a &quot; enemy , &quot; in which a civil war is an inde@@ fin@@ ite point in the landscape and becomes the object for &quot; coll@@ ateral damage &quot; and &quot; lost spheres . &quot; &quot;
&quot; war back or forth , the fact is that the residents of the F@@ av@@ el@@ as in Rio continue to suffer . &quot;
one week it is now that the police climb@@ ed the mountain with the F@@ av@@ ela Jac@@ are@@ zin@@ ho to av@@ enge the death of a polic@@ eman .

Quelle : Can@@ Do@@ Action
&quot; since the beginning of the Syrian revolution in 2011 and in the subsequent civil war , many Syrian cities suffer brutal si@@ ege and block@@ ades , mainly by Assad &apos;s regime against loyal troops . &quot;
&quot; according to vic@@ tories Watch , a joint initiative of the Peace Organization PA@@ X and the Research Institute The Syria Institute , H@@ oms , Dei@@ r E@@ zz@@ or and Id@@ lib are currently around one million Syri@@ ans in a state of si@@ ege . &quot;
&quot; the region east Gh@@ out@@ a , where an attack with chemical weapons on 21 August 2013 demanded the lives of hundreds of civilians . &quot;
&quot; many governments , international organizations and the Syrian opposition assume , based on the United Nations investigations and other human rights organisations , that the massac@@ re of the Assad regime has been committed . &quot;
&quot; since 2013 , these rebels controlled areas outside Damascus have stood under si@@ ege , which led to local residents , or by tun@@ nels and control points of lubric@@ ated foods . &quot;
&quot; through the years of block@@ ade , traditional foods such as meat have become indispensable for large parts of the population . &quot;
&quot; as a counter@@ part , a group of Syrian humanitarian aid and ac@@ adem@@ ics teaches the inhabitants of East Gh@@ out@@ as , how they can plant their own fung@@ i as &quot; life @-@ saving food source . &quot; &quot;
they call themselves Gh@@ ir@@ as Al@@ nah@@ da and carry out the project together with the NGO Al Ad@@ ala .
&quot; fung@@ i do not belong to the common foods planted in Syria , and are only extremely rare in the Syrian cuisine . however , it makes it an attractive food source for many residents of the besieg@@ ed East Gh@@ out@@ a . &quot;
&quot; the Direct of the project , Ab@@ o Nab@@ il , said to the French news agency AF@@ P : &quot;
&quot; we decided to cultivate mushrooms because they have a high nutritional value , similar to meat , and because you can plant them in houses and cellars . &quot;
&quot; Dr. Ah@@ med Lei@@ la , one of the organizers , reports Global Vo@@ ices that has been fighting for three years to announce this project and expressed its relief that it gains more and more promin@@ ence . &quot;
&quot; to collect money for the initiative , we use the humanitarian Crow@@ d@@ funding platform Can@@ Do in consultation with the NGO Gh@@ ir@@ as Al@@ nah@@ da . &quot;
&quot; it is planned to convey 125 families knowledge to pl@@ anting mushrooms , such as Dr. Lei@@ la to Global Vo@@ ices . &quot;
&quot; at the time of the constitution of this article , they have reached over 100 % of their expected target of around 12,@@ 700 € , but will still collect donations to Can@@ do until Monday , 04 September 2017 . &quot;
the initiative is dependent on generators that keep temperatures stable at 25 ° C and humidity at 80 % .
&quot; because of the fuel short@@ age , locally produced fuels are used in plastic to supply the generators with the necessary energy . &quot;
&quot; Dr. Lei@@ la said Global Vo@@ ices that they began with the &quot; &quot; production of mushroom seeds &quot; &quot; coming from regions before they checked their quality and whether they are suitable for consumption . &quot;
&quot; then they planted a small mushroom farm in a tub . as this succeeded , they used a larger pan . and so on . &quot;
now they have designed a &quot; educational farm for the region . &quot;
&quot; since the beginning of the project and after another 3 months , they have distributed fung@@ i throughout East Gh@@ out@@ a for free . &quot;
Dr. Lei@@ la explained that it is part of a larger movement .
&quot; we want to teach people the fung@@ al breeding for various reasons : frac@@ ture of si@@ ege .
provision of a new food source on the market .
&quot; spread of a culture of self @-@ suffici@@ ency by eating food resi@@ dues ( such as paper , tea , coffee , cardboard , etc ) for the extraction of new foods . &quot;
&quot; creation of new jobs , especially for women who work at home . &quot;
creation of new jobs for people with disabilities connected to their homes .
he said : &quot; we hope to spread this idea all over the world so that our success and our fight against hunger and si@@ ege will be visible .
we want our experience to inspire people in crisis areas and we can help humanity .

Portuguese demand justice for the victims of the fires of 2017
several hundred people prot@@ ested on 21 October in many districts in Portugal and called for justice for the victims of the fires that were gr@@ ass@@ ed in the north of Portugal last week .
forty @-@ two persons died and around 70 were injured as a result of the forest fires of 15 and 16 October . this led to the fact that the government cancelled the last week of solidarity with the victims for 3 days a state of state .
fires were also registered in the Gal@@ icia region in Spain where there were 4 deaths .
&quot; it is estimated that there were more than 500 fire break@@ outs spread in the northern and central regions of the country , and about 250 million hectares of forest and numerous villages reached . &quot;
&quot; in June Ped@@ r@@ ó@@ g@@ ão Grande occurred a similar tragedy , where there were 64 deaths and more than 200 injured . &quot;
&quot; according to the European forestry monitoring system , which monitors the forest areas by satellite photos alone , about 500,000 hectares of forest are burned in Portugal alone - an area of the size of the Lisbon district . &quot;
so that you can make a better picture of the seri@@ ousness of the situation : there is no fire in 4 districts .
&quot; all Portugal is burning in the tru@@ est sense of the word # Pra@@ y@@ For@@ Portugal - nat@@ a ( @ a _ at@@ aner ) October 15 , 2017 &quot;
some of Twitter users shared images :
this is Br@@ aga tonight . # Pra@@ y@@ For@@ Portugal # Br@@ aga # F@@ og@@ os@@ PT
numerous videos spread on the web and show images that allow better insights into what is happening :
the fores@@ e@@ eable tragedy
the aim of the protests from Saturday was the demand for better prevention and fire fighting measures by the state .
people wonder@@ ed why civil protection was unable to cur@@ b the extent of the tragedy as far as possible .
Jo@@ ão Sover@@ al from Portugal Con@@ federation declared the newspaper P@@ ú@@ bli@@ co :
after Ped@@ r@@ ó@@ g@@ ão streets and villages were ev@@ acu@@ ated for everything and nothing .
this Sunday they did not do this anywhere : there are dozens of open roads surrounded by fire .
&quot; in the forest of Lei@@ ria , a similar tragedy would have happened in June since the streets were closed very late . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , construction permits are ques@@ tioned in locations with high fire risk . &quot;
&quot; a far @-@ reaching proposal for the roll @-@ out , which the government had brought into serious fires in 2003 and 2005 , was obj@@ ected by the municipalities that saw the new rules as an obstacle to investments . &quot;
&quot; the government led a loos@@ ening of the law , which allowed construction activity in case the applicant had funds for self @-@ protection - that was an open back@@ door so that everything could be built , &quot; says Jo@@ ão Sor@@ val in the same article in the newspaper P@@ ú@@ bli@@ co . &quot;
&quot; the environmental organization Quer@@ cus pointed out that large surfaces with eu@@ calyp@@ tus , trees made of readily combus@@ tible wood , themselves , as in a vi@@ cious circle , continues to spread further . &quot;
&quot; these problems are added that the website of the Civil Defence of Portugal on 15 and 16 October , when residents sought information or tried to contact relatives , was offline . &quot;
it was a private initiative that provided the population with information : they used their own civil protection data using the f@@ og@@ os@@ .@@ pt and informed the population in real time about the location and spread of the fires .
&quot; the project was launched in 2015 by the developer Jo@@ ão P@@ ina in order to simplify the work of the fire bri@@ g@@ ade and was so crucial in October that the server failed to withstand the ons@@ lau@@ ght of 400@@ ,000 users who followed the fires : the website counted more than half a million hits . &quot;
even the founder asked for help :

&quot; in a night in autumn 1994 , the conquest of Afghanistan began by the Taliban . &quot;
&quot; two years earlier , a terrible civil war broke out between the various Mu@@ j@@ ah@@ edi@@ n group@@ ings , which had defeated the short @-@ lived pro @-@ Soviet government . thus , Afghanistan became a country of terror and desp@@ air . &quot;
&quot; at that time A@@ shar@@ k Bar@@ ati was sitting , a 13 @-@ year @-@ old boy who belongs to the ethnic group of Haz@@ ara , in the province of G@@ haz@@ ni in central Afghanistan for the last time with his family at dinner . &quot;
&quot; even if his mother didn &apos;t say it at that time , she knew she would not see her son for a long time - maybe even more . &quot;
&quot; in the dawn , the boy should burst . &quot;
his unc@@ le would pick him up and bring him to the Schle@@ p@@ pern .

&quot; Ab@@ dul Ali Maz@@ ari , the leader of the He@@ z@@ b @-@ e @-@ Wah@@ dat party dominated by Haz@@ ara , had just been murdered by the Taliban and many Haz@@ ara felt uns@@ ett@@ led . &quot;
the Taliban known for their hatred for Haz@@ ara came closer and closer .
many Haz@@ ara left the country towards Pakistan or Iran .
&quot; a few days after his escape , A@@ shar@@ k found himself in Pakistan . &quot;
for a few years he worked in a coal mine . the work was heavy and made him sick .
&quot; then he took that which was left of his small reward , and went to Iran . once again , he was in a foreign country together with other refugees and drag@@ ged sacks with mort@@ ars that were he@@ avier than himself , in order to earn his living . &quot;
&quot; at that time , as today , the life of Afgh@@ an refugees in Iran was characterised by mis@@ ery and exploitation . &quot;
&quot; it was really tough , &quot; A@@ shar@@ k remembered in an interview with Global Vo@@ ices . &quot; we ( Afgh@@ an refugees ) lived in an empty building on the construction site , on which we also worked . &quot;
there was no services there and no heating . we hung n@@ ylon in front of the open windows so that we could not be frozen at night .
&quot; after four years , A@@ shar@@ k left his life without papers in Iran and made herself ready for the journey to Europe . &quot;
&quot; during the dangerous passage on the sea , he suffered ship@@ w@@ reck and str@@ anded on a small , un@@ inhabited Greek island . &quot;
&quot; after the Greek authorities rejected asylum application , A@@ shar@@ k came to Italy in 2002 . &quot;
&quot; some time ago , A@@ shar@@ k was hom@@ eless , running alone through the streets of Rome , slept in parks and went to a church that distributed twice a day food to aid . &quot;
&quot; it is true that Italy is a second chance for ex@@ pi@@ red asylum seek@@ ers due to relatively high resolution quot@@ as . however , it is true that the conditions for asylum seek@@ ers in the country are cat@@ astrop@@ hic . &quot;
&quot; the Human Rights Organisation Civil Liber@@ ties Union for Europe writes , the system suff@@ ers under a general lack of transparency . &quot;
&quot; the large majority of asylum seek@@ ers are housed in more than 3000 &quot; &quot; special reception centres &quot; . &quot; they are impro@@ vised facilities in the hands of un@@ qualified and un@@ prepared personnel . &quot;
&quot; according to Italian law , asylum seek@@ ers can only be allocated to a reception centre if they officially have submitted an application to asylum . &quot;
&quot; until then people who have no money for accommodation , either rely on the hospitality of friends or have to sleep on the street . &quot;
so it was A@@ shar@@ af .
&quot; but his un@@ w@@ alled li@@ vel@@ ihood helped A@@ shar@@ af , soon to free himself from these conditions . &quot;
&quot; after spending several years in the construction industry for several years , A@@ shar@@ k put his entire savings into the establishment of a host@@ els in Venice . &quot;
this went so well that after a while he still opened a second hostel and a quick bite .
&quot; A@@ shar@@ k Bar@@ atis &apos;s success story is now theme of the documentary &quot; Beh@@ ind Venice Luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ( German : &quot; behind Venetian luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ) of the director A@@ min Wah@@ id@@ i . &quot;
&quot; the film won the Venice City Award in 2017 , which was presented for the 24th time in 2017 . &quot;

the conditions for entrepreneurs in Italy - especially for non @-@ Itali@@ ans - are very difficult .
&quot; much bureaucracy , high taxes and conditions for loans are just a few of the obstacles . &quot;
&quot; according to the official estimates , about 20,000 Afgh@@ ans live in Italy . &quot;
&quot; for many of them , the country is a transition solution to other European countries . &quot;
&quot; in recent years , some of Afgh@@ an operating companies , including tail@@ ors , travel agencies , hotels and restaurants have been created . &quot;
some Afgh@@ an restaurants were even praised in the Italian press for their excellent cuisine .
&quot; in Venice , Ham@@ ed Ah@@ mad@@ i had the idea of his restaurant Oriental Experience , where the wa@@ iters and the kitchen staff are mostly refugees from different parts of the world . &quot;
&quot; the menu of the restaurant nar@@ rates the history of their trip to Italy by the various Afgh@@ an , Iraqi , Turkish and Greek courts . &quot;
the Afgh@@ an entrepren@@ eur Ali Khan Q@@ al@@ and@@ ari opened in Pa@@ dua the restaurant Peace &amp; amp ; Sp@@ ice and also behind the Pizzeria Kab@@ u@@ log@@ na in Bologna and a Sus@@ hi Restaurant in Rome also are Afgh@@ ans .
&quot; A@@ shar@@ af@@ s aims , however , far beyond Italian gastronomy and retail and go back to the country which he had to leave as teen@@ ager . &quot;
&quot; where a risk is , there are also ways , &quot; says A@@ shar@@ k with a smile . &quot; I want to invest in Afghanistan . &quot;
I have never forgotten my country and I cannot live happily when I know my people suffer .
&quot; I plan a project for farmers from the poor@@ est provinces of the country , especially for women . &quot;
they represent half of society and have to get the same possibilities as all others .
&quot; A@@ shar@@ af also forged plans for the opening of a factory in Kab@@ ul in which people can learn packaging and conservation techniques . &quot; &quot; thus , they can sell their crop yields on the market and improve their financial situation , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; the development of the successful entrepreneurs was a journey through uncertainty and doubt , but at the end there are stability and prosperity . &quot;
A@@ shar@@ k has made this journey self . now he wants to help other Afgh@@ ans on this road .
&quot; Ne@@ ti@@ zen report : alleg@@ ations of Egypt permit shut@@ down of social networks Mah@@ m@@ oud Abu Z@@ aid , aka Sha@@ w@@ kan , for more than 900 days in det@@ ention . &quot;
&quot; he reported about the clearance of the camp Rab@@ a &apos;@@ a el Ada@@ we@@ ya in Cairo , which prot@@ ested against the de@@ composition of President Mohamed Mor@@ si . &quot;

&quot; global Vo@@ ices Adv@@ oc@@ ac@@ ys Ne@@ ti@@ zen report is an international snap@@ shot , the challenges , vic@@ tories and emerging trends in global Internet rights &quot;
&quot; the Egyptian Parliament checks a bill , which shows that users can use social media like Twitter or Facebook only after registration with a government authority . &quot;
&quot; users would have to register in order to use social networks , register within six months following the deadline of the law on the website of the authority , indicating its full name as well as its ID number . &quot;
those who miss this step could be sentenced to up to six months of imprisonment or the termination of a rep@@ ay@@ ment .
&quot; the law , which was promoted by sixty members of the Parliament , is currently on the legislative and constitutional committee of the Parliament and is to be deb@@ ated there . &quot;
&quot; in May , a further member of parliament submitted a legislative proposal to be introduced in the tough@@ er pen@@ alties for the off@@ ence of the President or a high officials . &quot;
&quot; under Egyptian law , the abuse of the President and state institutions is already pun@@ ish@@ able . however , under the law proposal , such action would be punished with prison and fin@@ es , as legal experts of Tah@@ ri@@ r Institute for Middle East Policy . &quot;
&quot; should the law be approved , this can mean up to three years in j@@ ail for the judges . &quot;
&quot; in addition , this would support a political climate in which the right to freedom of expression and freedom of assembly is in danger already for many years . &quot;
&quot; an example is the case of the Egyptian photographer Mah@@ m@@ oud Ab@@ o Z@@ ID ( known as Sha@@ w@@ kan ) who was arrested on 13 August 2013 when he held violence against demonstr@@ ators , who demonstrated against the military coup that had led to the revival of elected president Mohammed Mor@@ si . &quot;
&quot; Sha@@ w@@ kan waited , just like more than 700 protest participants , who had been arrested by the same incident , four years in j@@ ail for a trial date . &quot;
&quot; recently , his trial was postpon@@ ed to the 20th of May , because the prison administration failed to bring the accused from prison to the cour@@ tro@@ om . &quot;
&quot; Sha@@ w@@ kan threat@@ ens the death penalty due to one , so many human rights groups agree , hypo@@ cris@@ y burden from among others weapons , illegal assembly , murder and trial murder . &quot;
&quot; in another case , a Criminal Court in G@@ iza called two journalists H@@ any Sal@@ ah @-@ el @-@ De@@ en and Mos@@ ad Al @-@ barb@@ ary . they were indic@@ ted for their reporting on the pro @-@ Mor@@ si seat block@@ ade at Rab@@ a &apos;@@ a Al @-@ Ada@@ wi@@ ya Square in Cairo . &quot;
&quot; the court also reduced the punishment of journalists Ab@@ dul@@ lah al @-@ Fak@@ har@@ any , Sam@@ hi Must@@ afa and Mohamed al @-@ Ad@@ ly , who were also arrested by the previously mentioned incident , from 25 years to 5 years . &quot;
Tunis@@ ian activists to inter@@ rog@@ ated documents
&quot; May , Tunis@@ ian authorities spent six hours with the Ver@@ hö@@ r of Sam@@ i Ben G@@ har@@ bia , who is co @-@ founder of the independent media platform Na@@ wa@@ at and the Global Vo@@ ices advoc@@ acy project . &quot;
&quot; Ben G@@ har@@ bia was princip@@ ally inter@@ rog@@ ated to an en@@ su@@ ed action plan . owned by the President of the Republic , according to the plan expressly granted a controversial draft bill , the business@@ men and during the former regime by dict@@ ator Z@@ ine el @-@ Abi@@ dine Ben Ali accused the corruption of Official am@@ ne@@ sty . &quot;
&quot; the document published on April 21 , published on the site of Na@@ wa@@ at , sheds light on how the pre@@ dict@@ ated plans to support the legislative situation look like . &quot;
&quot; Ben G@@ har@@ bia rejected the name of his sources under specification of Article 11 of the Tunis@@ ian press code , which safegu@@ ards journalists the right to protect their sources . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , he entered the District Court in Tunis on May 09 as a witness . &quot;
does China want to force the users of social media to suggest their identity ?
&quot; according to new provisions of the State Council of the People &apos;s Republic of China , the users of social media in China need permission before writing or sharing messages in social media . &quot;
&quot; in the pres@@ crip@@ tions , it is also stated that registration with the full real name will be required . &quot;
analysts susp@@ ect that this elimin@@ ates the elimination of anonymous comments in sub @-@ conversations within social networks . it is up to now uncle@@ ar how the authorities will apply these regulations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Chinese citizens have proposed in social media to en@@ force these regulations only selective in order to protect civil journ@@ alism and independence . &quot;
let &apos;s see ourselves in &quot; We@@ Chat &quot; ?
not in Russia !
&quot; in May , the state cens@@ or@@ ship of Russia opened the access to the latest Chinese Mess@@ aging App We@@ Chat . &quot;
&quot; according to Ros@@ kom@@ nad@@ z@@ or , We@@ Chat failed to register in the state government as the &quot; organis@@ er of the prolifer@@ ation of information . &quot; &quot;
&quot; this term is part of a law from 2014 , thanks to which the Russian government provides a list of online services that will organize the &quot; publication of information . &quot; the law also allows the government to be responsible for removal of content and to force them upon request to susp@@ end user data . &quot;
&quot; these websites currently include websites such as V@@ kontak@@ te and Od@@ no@@ sche@@ ni@@ ki ( Russia &apos;s two most popular social networks ) , the Image Board 2.@@ ch@@ .@@ h@@ k , e @-@ mail service mail@@ .@@ ru and dozens of other services . &quot;
Turkish court has lock Wiki@@ pedi@@ as
&quot; a Turkish court had the block@@ age Wiki@@ pedi@@ as in Turkey after Wikipedia administrators refused to delete two English @-@ language articles , the data , Turkey supported the ji@@ hadi@@ sts in Syria . &quot;
&quot; the Turkish Ministry of Transport , maritime affairs and communication gave to , the site was closed because it was a source of information that collabor@@ ates with groups to point out a political diffusion campaign against Turkey . &quot;
&quot; it is the first time that Turkey has completely blocked the website . it is thus , alongside others , China , one of the few countries around the world where access to Wikipedia is not possible . &quot;
great Britain cannot stop dro@@ pping down
&quot; following this week , the UK government is in the midst of a targeted consultation regarding increased surveillance authorities that would force Internet service providers to monitor communications in real time and to install back@@ door programs that de@@ cryp@@ t data encryption . &quot;
&quot; the government has consul@@ ted telecommunications companies and intelligence services regarding the proposal , but has left other technology companies and the civilian population outside . &quot;
&quot; despite all this , the consultation runs until May 19 . reactions and proposals by members of the public can be for@@ warded to the Ministry of the Interior . &quot;
