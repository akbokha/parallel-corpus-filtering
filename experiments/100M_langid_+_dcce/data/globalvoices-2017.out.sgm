<seg id="1">"although I had visited the USA at least once a year since 2012, I would live there for the first time."</seg>
<seg id="2">And that was very exciting for me.</seg>
<seg id="3">My love for America is extraordinarily large.</seg>
<seg id="4">"as many of my generation I grew up with American movies, I danced to American music, read American writers and run their sport."</seg>
<seg id="5">"in fact, this country had such a profound effect on me that I was mainly a journalist because of an American film."</seg>
<seg id="6">"as a 14-year-old, I saw the great Denzel Washington, how he played the Gray Grantham in The Pelican letter, a fearless reporter who wanted to occupy the murderous conspiracy of an oil-magnate with the help of Julia Roberts as a Jura-student."</seg>
<seg id="7">I was imprisoned.</seg>
<seg id="8">"according to Method Man," me it was as if this is the absolute truth, forget everything else, that's what I want to do with my life. "</seg>
<seg id="9">"and the year I lived in Arizona, my admiration for the USA had only strengthened."</seg>
<seg id="10">"I always said," "America is the only country in which I have ever lived, whose diversity is so inviting that you can always be who you are and it is easy to find acceptance in a community of like minded people."</seg>
<seg id="11">I even wrote a very shamanic love letter about his size.</seg>
<seg id="12">Then Donald Trump came.</seg>
<seg id="13">Much has been written about xenophobia and racism of this man.</seg>
<seg id="14">The most extraordinary aspect of his ascension is for me as he walks with his narrow-mindedness.</seg>
<seg id="15">He never thinks behind the mountain as you say so beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="16">"he tells exactly what he thinks of how a former colleague expressed it, and openly declares his contempt for Muslims, Latinos, Afroamericans and women."</seg>
<seg id="17">"nevertheless, people responded to his statements and tuned in pairs for him."</seg>
<seg id="18">The 13 million votes he won in the republican elections was the highest number ever reached by the Party nominee nominee.</seg>
<seg id="19">I was speechless.</seg>
<seg id="20">"who are the Americans who support this bigot person, I asked myself?"</seg>
<seg id="21">I could not bring Trump and his voters to tune with the people that I met during my time in Phoenix.</seg>
<seg id="22">"as for example, my professor, Dr. Bill Silcock, director of the journalistic program that takes people from all over the world, a deep believer, with whom I could talk about Islam and his past."</seg>
<seg id="23">"also, Trumps's Weltanschauung did not correspond with the current publisher of the" Cincinnati Inquirer. ""</seg>
<seg id="24">Bhatia and I met with our common love for basketball and we spent many hours watching the "Phoenix Suns."</seg>
<seg id="25">"Trumps intolerance is also in contrast to generosity that I experienced at Sandy Bahr who fought the environment for their lives, and their husband Dave, my host family, who treated me like their son."</seg>
<seg id="26">"she still fits to the commitment of Kristi Kappes, who always helped me with a lot of patience and grace to me and my colleagues to get used to the complexity of the American life."</seg>
<seg id="27">"then there were Andrew Leckey, Kathryn McManus and Retha Hill, my mentors, whose wise advice helped me a lot in my career."</seg>
<seg id="28">These people and the values embodied by them deepened my love of America.</seg>
<seg id="29">"while Trump failed his way to the nominal republican presidential candidate, they gave me a stop and the counterpart to his limited vision of America."</seg>
<seg id="30">"however, it turned out that they were the exception of the rule."</seg>
<seg id="31">"on November 8, 2016 more than 50 million Americans, mostly white, the presidency of a man, despite - or perhaps because of his contempt against non-white people."</seg>
<seg id="32">"the debate with the idea that people have voted for Trump because they either shared their racism and fanaticism, or because they were willing to overlook these things, almost broke my heart."</seg>
<seg id="33">Perhaps it is unfair to call the Trump voters as Rassisten.</seg>
<seg id="34">"to classify people, said one of my friends, is exactly what led us to this situation."</seg>
<seg id="35">This is superficial and respectful and indicates an inability to understand those who act in another way and think.</seg>
<seg id="36">It shows people that their worries and fears are not taken into account of the hectic changes in their communities.</seg>
<seg id="37">"could it be that these voters, most of whom are white, voted for Trump because they want to regain control of a country that she has disappointed?"</seg>
<seg id="38">"in other words, they might say they are still important in this America?"</seg>
<seg id="39">Maybe.</seg>
<seg id="40">"however, one can hardly forget the words of David Remnick, who comments the cruel decision to raise a man who looks down with contempt to those who look different than he."</seg>
<seg id="41">"this" "Whitelash" "(note): as much as" "rebellion of the whites against all other ethnicities"; "word play from white in allusion to the Whites and whiplash, as called the great Van Jones, has killed exactly what America did so great."</seg>
<seg id="42">"millions of people around the world appreciate the American ideal - regardless of whether myth or reality, it is nevertheless a powerful idea - what faith or background you may have, America welcomes everyone."</seg>
<seg id="43">"for this land chose as its President, twice the son of a Kenyan, whose story he himself says, nowhere else in the world would be possible."</seg>
<seg id="44">"however, with the choice of Donald Trumps, there is a huge part of the white Americas on this promise and says: to Hell with diversity, freedom of religion and the whole concept of pluralism."</seg>
<seg id="45">"in America after 9 / 11, the white man is back at the helm, they say."</seg>
<seg id="46">"in all this I have to think of Khizr Khan, the father of a soldier who is in Iraq, and what he said on the eve of election."</seg>
<seg id="47">"on a demonstration for Hillary Clinton, Mr. Khan had a change of word with the crowd."</seg>
<seg id="48">"Donald Trump, would have my son, captain Humayun Kahn, a place in your America?" asked Mr. Khan. "</seg>
<seg id="49">The crowd answered with a loud "No!"</seg>
<seg id="50">"would Muslims have a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="51">"no!" "roared the crowd."</seg>
<seg id="52">"do Latinos have a place in your Americas?"</seg>
<seg id="53">"no!" "they said."</seg>
<seg id="54">Do Afro Americans have a place in your America? "</seg>
<seg id="55">"no!" they cried, and their voices became louder. "</seg>
<seg id="56">"if anyone, who is not like you, a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="57">He received a unanimous and loud "NO"!</seg>
<seg id="58">"Mr. Khan concluded with the words:" thank God, Mr. Trump, is that not your America. "36 hours later he was corrected."</seg>
<seg id="59">"the land for whom his son had fallen, sent him a message."</seg>
<seg id="60">"that is now Trumps country, the message said."</seg>
<seg id="61">"and all the people that look like Mr. Khan, could find no place in this new America."</seg>
<seg id="62">And that breaks my heart.</seg>

<seg id="69">What is the Mexican music school of the Vicente Guerrero community in the province of Oaxaca together with the children of the paraguan city Cateura?</seg>
<seg id="70">"the music, which is played in both places, not only changed the life of the children, but also a very close connection with..."</seg>
<seg id="71">Music that lives with the waste</seg>
<seg id="72">"Vicente Guerrero is located on the edge of a large garbage dump, only 16 Kilometers south of Oaxaca & # 8212; an old colonial town, which is very popular among tourists - but worlds away from the nearby preColumbian ruins and its world-famous kitchen."</seg>
<seg id="73">"for several years now, the La banda de Música (music bande) has been playing in the congregation: a symphony orchestra consisting of children and adults, which has a possibility to overcome the surrounding poverty with their musical instruments."</seg>
<seg id="74">A music school with 100 students has become a central interest in the municipality of Vicente Guerrero in Oaxaca.</seg>
<seg id="75">The UK newspaper The Guardian wrote about this project:</seg>
<seg id="76">"the community, located in one of the poorest provinces of Mexico, is known for its drug abuse and gangs of violence."</seg>
<seg id="77">But this changed after a random encounter with a French pilot who started a musical project and offered young people a rare glimmer of hope.</seg>
<seg id="78">"the young band members take their commitments to the music group seriously, writes the local press Noticias Oaxaca NVI:"</seg>
<seg id="79">"once they come from school, they run back home and immediately after lunch they run through the dusty streets to pursue their great passion."</seg>
<seg id="80">"they are always laughing and with shiny eyes and play in the bustle you learn day for day trumpet, trombone, piccolo, clarinet, oboe, flute, woodhorn, timpani, bongos and the Conga."</seg>
<seg id="81">Music from garbage</seg>
<seg id="82">"more than 7,000 kilometres south of Vicente Guerrero, the children of Cateura - a village that is practically located at the largest waste dump of Asunción in Paraguay's capital - on instruments made of recycled waste material:"</seg>
<seg id="83">"music with retreated instruments that consist of local solid waste materials, made in a workshop for musical instruments in Cateura, where the recycler began to turn parts of the waste into instruments under the direction of Favio Chávez."</seg>
<seg id="84">"instruments imitate violins, viola, cellos, double basses, guitars, flutes, saxophones, trumpets, trombones and percussion, all produced from the trash."</seg>
<seg id="85">"the repertoire includes classical music, folk music, paraguayan and Latin American music as well as music of the Beatles, by Frank Sinatra, etc."</seg>
<seg id="86">"in an article in the Los Angeles Times Favio Chávez, a local ecologist and musician of the children of Cateura, recalls the early days:"</seg>
<seg id="87">First it was very difficult because we had no place for rehearsals and we had to teach at the same place where the parents did not know music and it was very difficult to contact parents because many of them do not live with their children.</seg>
<seg id="88">This changed as Favio something he had never seen before: a violin produced from waste.</seg>
<seg id="89">"today there is a whole orchestra, which plays on instruments from retreated material and called The Recycled Orchestra."</seg>
<seg id="90">A documentary called "Landfill Harmonic" (Harmonic Mülldepony) draws the musical performance to:</seg>
<seg id="91">The world generates about one billion tons of garbage every year.</seg>
<seg id="92">"those who live with him and of him are the poorest - like the people of Cateura, Paraguay."</seg>
<seg id="93">And here they turn it into something beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="94">Landfill Harmonic follows the orchestra with his inspirational drama from garbage music around the world.</seg>

<seg id="96">These Eastern African countries demonstrate how technology and teamwork can successfully fight illegal fishing</seg>
<seg id="97">Photo © FISH-i Africa - a project that combats wild illegal fishing.</seg>
<seg id="98">"this post, written by Emma Bryce, was originally published by Ensia.com, a magazine that specifically reports about international, practised solutions for environmental problems."</seg>
<seg id="99">The republication occurs within the framework of an agreement with Global Voices for sharing content.</seg>
<seg id="100">"in West Africa, it was known that this ship had already practised illegal fishing in the Libyan waters before it visited the other coast of Africa."</seg>
<seg id="101">The East African countries were upset accordingly and little inclined to welcome a criminal offense of this kind at their coasts.</seg>
<seg id="102">"Kenya, Tanzania, Mauritius, the Comoros, Mozambique and the Seychelles quickly mobilized against the ship. they refused to enter one of their harbours and refused to give him a fisheries property."</seg>
<seg id="103">"" "suddenly the prime minister was surrounded by countries that you simply denied all", "Benedict Kiilu, an executive of the Kenyan fishing authority, is a part of a team that discovered and persecuted the ship at that time."</seg>
<seg id="104">"in 2013, the ship was driven out of the waters of the region: it was not able to catch fish there."</seg>
<seg id="105">"ultimately, it was forced to pay $2 million to Liberia, because of looting the country's fish stocks."</seg>
<seg id="106">"the core of this initiative, which crosses criminal practices and protects resources, was FISH-i Africa: a network of countries, 2012 from the NGO Stop Illegal Fishing (halt Illegal fishing)."</seg>
<seg id="107">"alongside Somalia and Madagascar, the members of this network are the six countries which then had driven the prime minister out of their waters."</seg>
<seg id="108">"this project offers FISH-i technical support to Few Charitable Trusts Project Ending Illegal Fishing. this project offers FISH-i technical support.</seg>
<seg id="109">Illegal fishing is unregulated by definition: what is caught will be concealed from which it is extremely difficult to detect. therefore illegal fishing is a major cause of overfishing by regions.</seg>
<seg id="110">"by deliberate disregard of existing laws, by which certain habitats and species are to be protected, the illegal fishing ecosystems can harm ecosystems that have a delicate equilibrium."</seg>
<seg id="111">"but during actions against illegal fishing once been hindered by bureaucratic hurdles and also by the snail empo, with the information between individual countries, the actions happen in real-time, with traceable to FISH-i's digital communication platform."</seg>
<seg id="112">"for example, the individual countries can exchange lists of existing licenses, news on suspicious activities or details that one notices or experienced during a harbour inspection."</seg>
<seg id="113">"fish-i tracks the activities of ships also very attentive when they move on the open sea, by means of satellite data."</seg>
<seg id="114">"this enables the authorities to mark ships that fish in forbidden areas - such as such, which indicate that a ship will load its caught fish on the way to other ships."</seg>
<seg id="115">"ideally, such studies show whether the participating ships have a fishing license, where they were on the way and possibly, if they have a criminal law."</seg>
<seg id="116">"countries that are against illegal fishing can then refuse to accept such vessels in their ports. what means that ships cannot sell their cargo, and that they can even be forced to pay punishments, as in the case of prime minister."</seg>
<seg id="117">"" "it's about considerable financial losses for the owner, which means that illegal fishing is no longer worthwhile."</seg>
<seg id="118">"this is what we want to achieve," "says Per Erik Bergh, director of nfds Africa. the latter is a consultant company committed to the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also supported FISH-i."</seg>
<seg id="119">A closed front</seg>
<seg id="120">"the already mentioned platform was created to regain about 20 million USD of lost revenue, which will lose the eight members of the HISH-i network each year because of illegal fishing that penetrates into East African waters."</seg>
<seg id="121">East Africa has one of the most productive tuna fisheries since the region attracts commercial fishing from all over the world. among these also uneven illegal fishermen.</seg>
<seg id="122">"other activities include sailing under false flag, fake license papers, stating fantasies, fish-protected species and fish in nature reserves."</seg>
<seg id="123">"" they specifically use the lack of international cooperation and make use of the weaknesses of a non-complete organized control system, "" says Long. "" previously a ship could fish illegally and a country could then say "You're not going to run my port." "</seg>
<seg id="124">"yet another country could say 'Come to Me'." "and this legal loophole tries to close FISH-i now."</seg>
<seg id="125">"until now, the closed front functions."</seg>
<seg id="126">"since its inception, FISH-i was involved in more than 30 studies of suspicious ships."</seg>
<seg id="127">It has revealed criminal networks that had spread fake licenses in Tanzania. it discovered ships that used several fraudulent identities and it has persecuted and found winged ships.</seg>
<seg id="128">"due to its collaboration with INTERPOL, the international authority to fight crimes, FISH-i can share information on illegal fishing over long distances."</seg>
<seg id="129">"" some of our investigations lead us quite far into the networks of organized crime, "says Bergh."</seg>
<seg id="130">It builds a system that will help FISH-i to detect suspected ships more precisely.</seg>
<seg id="131">Photo courtesy of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="132">"fish-i's satellite system, which will always be further developed, helps protect the illegal ships that would like to hide."</seg>
<seg id="133">"" the illegal fishermen use very sophisticated techniques to hide their activities and their position. and we try to cross, "" says Duncan Copeland, Chief Analyst at Trygg Mat Tracking, a NGO which also deals with fisheries data and FISH-i technical support. "</seg>
<seg id="134">"some of the ships, for example, turn off their automatic identification systems, which they cannot be localized by satellites."</seg>
<seg id="135">Copeland therefore helps to build a system that connects different levels of information together. it should help FISH-i to find criminally acting vessels with greater precision.</seg>
<seg id="136">A model program</seg>
<seg id="137">But FISH-i's team of African nations can actually influence the undoubtedly global problem of illegal fishing?</seg>
<seg id="138">"John Amos, President of the NGO's Skytruth, believes that."</seg>
<seg id="139">"recently, SkyTruth has opened the Global Fishing Watch platform together with Google and the Maritime Organization Oceana: a platform that offers satellite data and can be displayed anywhere in the world by means of the position of every single trackable ship."</seg>
<seg id="140">"" join together with the neighbours to get a better picture of who is doing - that simply makes sense, "" he says. "" here's a chance for countries to unite and bundle their resources. "</seg>
<seg id="141">"we should do this on a global scale." "Pew Charitable Trusts has a similar project to run where a global system permits the persecution of ships."</seg>
<seg id="142">"there are signs that FISH-i's activities not only detect criminals, but also frighten them."</seg>
<seg id="143">Ships that previously fished without a license and hardly had to reckon with consequences know that they are observed.</seg>
<seg id="144">"according to Kiilu, some of the countries participating in FISH-i have now reached a 33% increase in fishing turnover, since fishing boats have more licences."</seg>
<seg id="145">"after FISH-i Somalia had helped to spy Greko 1, the inspectors found towing nets on board whose use is prohibited."</seg>
<seg id="146">Photo courtesy of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="147">"other countries also notice these successes." "the effect is so strong that we now also copy other countries," "says Kiilu." "we are a study object." "in West Africa several hundred million dollars disappear every year through illegal fishing."</seg>
<seg id="148">"in 2015, six countries joined together, to the so-called West Africa Task Force. they are now fighting illegal fishing, according to the same model as FISH-i." "with certainty the goal is to make even more such initiatives and structures in other regions too," "says Copeland."</seg>
<seg id="149">"recently FISH-i's youngest member country Somalia was able to report its first big triumph: in October, Greko 1, a ship, who was on the road under false flag. and not only the ship was on the road without a license and were used as towing nets, which are now prohibited."</seg>
<seg id="150">"the ship was also entered into forbidden waters, which were reserved for fishermen from Somalia." "with the behaviour of measures against Greko 1, they set a strong sign that they proceed against illegal fishing," "says Bergh."</seg>
<seg id="151">"for FISH-i, this is another success of many. and at the same time proof that such a special, collaborative approach to protect the oceans actually works across the world. Emma Bryce is freelance journalist and lives in London."</seg>
<seg id="152">"their articles appear in the Wired Magazine, TED Education, the New York Times and the Guardian. situation in Venezuela escalates further: demonstrations in several cities with the aim of winning the country"</seg>

<seg id="161">"many representatives of the opposition saw the revival of the current president Nicolás Maduro a chance for a fundamental change, but ultimately the holding of a new election was blocked by the official authorities."</seg>
<seg id="162">"Marianne Díaz, contributor at Global Voices in Venezuela, summarises the context of the government decision as follows:"</seg>
<seg id="163">"in the context of the social, political and economic crisis, in which the inflation and power rates are among the highest in the world (the inflation rate is estimated at 500% to the end of the year) and in which a serious and far-reaching lack of food and medicine, the referendum was regarded as the only way to regain its institutional structures and to close a new government alliance."</seg>
<seg id="164">"the electoral alliance Mesa de la Unidad Democrática or shortly MUD (about: round table of the Democratic Unit), in which the opposition parties and political groups were joined together, the demonstrators planned to continue to support the National Assembly, and a march to the Miraflores Palace, the Venezuelan Government, planned on 3 November, should continue to persist the referendum of the referendum."</seg>

<seg id="229">'Then the prisoners are tortured '</seg>
<seg id="230">My father took me a total of four times to La Perla - all in 1976.</seg>
<seg id="231">At the first and last time he left me at the entrance in the car.</seg>
<seg id="232">"when he took me the second time he ordered me to get out. he led me to a barracks, in the cars, furniture, television, fridges - just everything possible - stood."</seg>
<seg id="233">Everything was stolen.</seg>
<seg id="234">"he gave me a little bag wrapped in a blanket, and ordered me to wear it to the car. when I opened it, I saw that there was a great deal of silver in it."</seg>
<seg id="235">"this day I went to the other end of the barracks, where the stolen items were shut down and kept me with a guard."</seg>
<seg id="236">Suddenly he pointed to an open space and said:</seg>
<seg id="237">The prisoners are tortured.</seg>
<seg id="238">"and I saw in it, and saw a couch in which men were tortured."</seg>
<seg id="239">She looked like a field bed and metal springs.</seg>
<seg id="240">"later, I found out that they attached the end of a cable. the other end was fastened to the person's body, which was just tied up there."</seg>
<seg id="241">"they scarcely hold a man with handcuffs to the bed, poured it with water and chased him a charge of 220 volts into the genitals."</seg>

<seg id="243">The stench there was horrible... like a dirty wind.</seg>
<seg id="244">"years later, when my father was under house arrest, the same smell came out of his room."</seg>
<seg id="245">I realized the smell immediately and I realized that the smell of a body is in need.</seg>
<seg id="246">I could never forget this smell.</seg>
<seg id="247">And I asked myself: how is it possible that a person can do so much suffering from another?</seg>
<seg id="248">I knew that these people were killed</seg>
<seg id="249">"when my father took me to work for the third time, he led me to the entrance of La Cuadra - the area where the prisoners were captivated with handcuffs and were carrying eye bandages."</seg>
<seg id="250">"he spoke with" Chubi "Lopez (Jose López, a civilian who was also indicted in the trial) and I took the opportunity to take a look at La Cuadra."</seg>
<seg id="251">"in the background, I saw a series of mattresses on which naked men lay down with the face down - all were captivated by hands and feet."</seg>
<seg id="252">"near the entrance, people kept quiet on the mattresses."</seg>
<seg id="253">"when my father noticed that I saw the prisoners, he said," "What do you do so, asshole?" ""</seg>
<seg id="254">"why did you come to me?" ""</seg>
<seg id="255">I knew that these people were killed.</seg>
<seg id="256">They were thrown into a pit and were killed and buried by soldiers.</seg>
<seg id="257">I know that because my father told me about it.</seg>
<seg id="258">"in addition to La Cuadra, some rooms were designated as offices."</seg>
<seg id="259">I know that "Palito" Romero beat a man there and killed a man.</seg>
<seg id="260">"(according to the survivors of the civil war Jorge Romero, who was also indicted in La Perla-Ribera, was accused of death by the students Raúl Mateo Molina."</seg>
<seg id="261">"the following video shows Emilio Fessia, the leader of the La Perla Memorial, through the former torture chambers."</seg>
<seg id="262">The way you came in here is also the way on which the kidnapping came here.</seg>
<seg id="263">"if you look on the map, you see that they took about this way and then were tortured for the first time."</seg>
<seg id="264">Here their names were changed and they were assigned a number as part of the process of dehumanization.</seg>
<seg id="265">"when they survived torture, the prisoners were thrown into the cuadra until the arrangement from above came that they should be laid."</seg>
<seg id="266">This was the lie - euphemism - for the shooting of men and the disappearance of their bodies in most cases.</seg>
<seg id="267">The 'Destiny'</seg>
<seg id="268">My father brought all sorts of stolen things home.</seg>
<seg id="269">"back then at the age I had no idea what the" "war" "- as they knew - was."</seg>
<seg id="270">"but when I was at the military later, I was in the gendarmerie - it became clear to me that war yield is a bayonet or perhaps military sign that one strikes an enemy that one fought against."</seg>

<seg id="274">This is theft.</seg>
<seg id="275">"I have always wondered how my father, the chief of the security forces, could join this vandalism."</seg>
<seg id="276">I just don't understand it.</seg>
<seg id="277">I was also an officer at the Gendarmerie and I would never like to enter a house and steal everything in it.</seg>
<seg id="278">I don't understand how my father could do that.</seg>
<seg id="279">"once he called me a criminal, and I replied," "And you, who steered cars on the road?" ""</seg>
<seg id="280">You are not a criminal?</seg>
<seg id="281">"he exploded against anger, struck me and cried:"</seg>
<seg id="282">"if you go so far, then I will find you and kill you."</seg>
<seg id="283">"for this, we don't need anyone else!"</seg>
<seg id="284">So my father was.</seg>
<seg id="285">I don't have a single good memory of him.</seg>
<seg id="286">"when I said in the process, I showed a photo of back then, on which I wore a jacket and a Rollkragenpullover made of wool. both had my father from La Perla."</seg>
<seg id="287">"we were not poor, but he still brought clothes to home."</seg>
<seg id="288">"at that time, the defence accused me of being a conspiratorial with this crime. I said, no problem, they can put me to load what they wanted."</seg>
<seg id="289">I was there anyway to cancel.</seg>

<seg id="295">"well, so you did execute people during the dictatorship. but why did the corpses leave?"</seg>
<seg id="296">Why children kidnapped?</seg>

<seg id="298">"she was like our pet, almost like a dog - only that this was a little girl."</seg>
<seg id="299">"I always asked the question: they were tortured, but why were they killed?"</seg>
<seg id="300">They could just have put them in jail.</seg>
<seg id="301">"I guess it was simply decided to kill these people, but why did their bodies disappear?"</seg>
<seg id="302">Did these people do not have families to be handed over to their mortal remains?</seg>
<seg id="303">The disappearance of the dead is the last abominable act that one can do to a man.</seg>
<seg id="304">"my father told me when democracy was reintroduced, they took machines to eliminate the mortal remnants of the prisoners."</seg>

<seg id="306">But something remains of course always.</seg>
<seg id="307">I have seen how you killed people!</seg>
<seg id="308">Just to make it clear: I have nothing against the military.</seg>
<seg id="309">I was even at the Gendarmerie.</seg>
<seg id="310">I just told the truth about 20 criminals - including my father.</seg>
<seg id="311">"the thought of showing my father arose during a conversation, when he was under house arrest."</seg>
<seg id="312">I made him accusations about all the atrocities I had to experience for him.</seg>
<seg id="313">"then he said suddenly:" "I don't know. I didn't kill anyone."</seg>
<seg id="314">"I felt inwardly abandoned and asked myself why the whole exaggerated patriotism and the" Western and Christian feelings, "which they allegedly defended were actually good."</seg>

<seg id="346">Edited by Joshua Levine.</seg>
<seg id="347">"in the Kyoto Japanese city, customers of a newly opened centre in which one can prolong their driving license last month, witnessed a very unsuccessful translation."</seg>
<seg id="348">"on a shield, the Japanese word was" "older drivers", "the" "elder car driver" "means, but perhaps also with bad background thoughts & # 8212; as" "terribly motorists". ""</seg>
<seg id="349">The wrong translation was to read on electronic displays at the entrance area and in the building itself from 1 to 20 September.</seg>
<seg id="350">"adaptation of the original photos by Joshua Levine, which has been widely shared in the social media."</seg>
<seg id="351">"the mistake was noticed by the translator Julian Holmes, a inhabitant of Kyotos. he was also aware of the local newspapers."</seg>
<seg id="352">The daily newspaper Kyoto Shimbun wrote in Kyoto:</seg>
<seg id="353">"" "how could there be such an English translation?"</seg>
<seg id="354">This proves that no one has read the translation correction.</seg>
<seg id="355">"this is an insult to elderly people and in an international city like Kyoto is simply unacceptable," "said Holmes."</seg>
<seg id="356">"the faulty English translation was first removed. the term" "terrible drivers" "was replaced later by the appropriate, although grammatically not quite correct term" elder drivers "(German:" older drivers ")."</seg>
<seg id="357">"the Kyoto Prefecture has apologated for translation errors. furthermore, she explained that the error was already contained in the text they had received from the translator and that the translation was not checked for its accuracy before it was published."</seg>
<seg id="358">A blogger reported about the excuse:</seg>
<seg id="359">"we are sorry that older people felt insulted by the inadequate correction (the translation)," "said the police."</seg>
<seg id="360">"the Japanese online news service J-Cast News was a bit more detailed with the phenomenon of" "terrible" "older drivers in Japan and wrote:"</seg>
<seg id="361">"the word" terrible "was denounced as an inappropriate description of older drivers. according to the police, the proportion of older drivers, who are involved nationwide in accidents, is quite a cause for concern."</seg>
<seg id="362">"in the Kyoto prefecture, for example, 1,941 of 19.460 accidents were caused by seniors in 2005. this corresponds to a share of 10%."</seg>
<seg id="363">"ten years later, in 2014, seniors 1.803 from a total of 11,850 accidents."</seg>

<seg id="376">The reasons for the wide distribution of translation errors are manifold.</seg>
<seg id="377">"for translating, you need two important skills: passive language skills in order to understand the source text and active language skills in order to transfer him to the target language."</seg>
<seg id="378">The latter requires the active domination of the target language - something that is the case with native speakers. in general the conviction that translators should be in the target language - not in the native language - native speakers.</seg>
<seg id="379">"for example, a French native speaker should translate from English into French - not from French to English."</seg>
<seg id="380">Photo of Flickr user Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="381">"many Japanese companies don't employ people with English as mother tongue, who could produce translations into English. this may be due to the lack of understanding for translating, cost reasons or the relatively small number of English native speakers who learn Japanese."</seg>
<seg id="382">"some companies, who don't have foreign employees, nevertheless make translations to the company. then the Japanese employee, whose English skills are valued as the best, become translators - no matter how good or bad his language skills are really."</seg>
<seg id="383">Photo of Flickr user Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="384">Machine translations are also widely used - often with funny results.</seg>
<seg id="385">"the confused and puzzling sentences, which arise by machine translation, show that this technique can't replace a human translator for a long time. this applies to some languages very special."</seg>
<seg id="386">"some of the most strange English phrases in Japan, including the mysterious prints, which often decorate t-shirts or bags, are used only for stylistic reasons - not to be read or even understood."</seg>
<seg id="387">Photo by Flickr user Joseph Brent.</seg>
<seg id="388">Translation errors may be acceptable or at least harmless. but by large companies or by the government that have the means to ensure higher standards you can expect more careful translations.</seg>
<seg id="389">"in the future, the city of Kyoto will hopefully use a more serious source for their translations."</seg>

<seg id="423">"the business is quite simple: a big family with little money passes her mineyears son or her minderage daughter to another, rich family. in exchange, the child gets food, training and a roof over the head."</seg>
<seg id="424">"however, what is not mentioned is that the children have to do so innumerable days of housework that will never be paid and victims of abuse and abuse - and all that within the framework of a contract that cannot be raised."</seg>
<seg id="425">"this practice, called Criadazgo, is widespread in Paraguay because of the participation and acceptance by large parts of society and despite numerous complaints from human rights organisations."</seg>
<seg id="426">"after completing her studies, Alvarenga worked for a few years for an organization fighting for the rights of boys and girls."</seg>
<seg id="427">"she spoke with Criaditas, especially young girls affected by the practice of the Criadazgo - collected testimonies, researched and denounced."</seg>
<seg id="428">"she tried to name things in the name, because the feeling of gratitude that is vaccinated to the Criaditas guarantees in general silence."</seg>
<seg id="429">"the Criadazgo is based on a double illusion," says Alvarenga. "</seg>
<seg id="430">"on the one hand, the family who is their daughter in the belief that they conclude their education, improve their position in society and" "make something out of themselves" "to another family."</seg>
<seg id="431">"on the other hand, the family who resumes the girl and justifies their exploitation with faith that they would give someone a chance that would otherwise have no training, and perhaps even starved."</seg>

<seg id="438">She was Criadita in the household of the former military person Tomás Ferreira and his wife Ramona Melgarejo who works as a civil servant at the Einwohnermeldeamt.</seg>
<seg id="439">"Marín lived with them in their house in Vaquería, a small town with only 3,000 inhabitants 250 kilometers east of the capital Asunción."</seg>
<seg id="440">"at the end of January 2016, Ferreira proposed a stick to Marín until they suffered deadly injuries."</seg>
<seg id="441">This should be the last punishment in the life of the young girl.</seg>

<seg id="458">But they all went to school.</seg>

<seg id="460">"in the house of her employers, Alvarenga worked between four and six hours every day."</seg>
<seg id="461">They had to divide the time in such a way that you still have time to learn.</seg>
<seg id="462">It was at five o'clock in the morning and prepared the breakfast for their employers.</seg>
<seg id="463">"for example, it cleansed the fridge, clean the living room, polished the furniture and disinfected the floor."</seg>
<seg id="464">"when the school ended, she went home again and had time to learn."</seg>
<seg id="465">"the more she finished with learning, the more leisure time she had."</seg>
<seg id="466">But even this time was limited because they had to make dinner for their employers.</seg>
<seg id="467">"Alvarenga says she never had to starve, but didn't get unlimited food." I was allowed to pick up more books from the library's library as food from the fridge, "she recalls."</seg>
<seg id="468">"the library was well equipped and belonged to the landlord, a former military and sympathiser of Partido Liberal, a liberal party, which was in power during the dictatorship of Alfredo Stroessner, who was in power from 1954 to 1989."</seg>

<seg id="502">"sixty Egyptian parliamentarians have recently agreed to draft law on" "regulating the use and use of social networks." ""</seg>
<seg id="503">"if he is accepted by Parliament, users and users of social media must register in Egypt with a government authority to use social media including Facebook and Twitter."</seg>
<seg id="504">"on the basis of the law, a place would then be established that is tasked with making citizens a permit to share social media."</seg>
<seg id="505">"within six months of acceptance of the law, users and users would have to register on the site of the site with their right names and identity numbers to use social networks."</seg>
<seg id="506">"if it fails to do so, it could bring a penalty of up to six months of detention or a fine of money."</seg>
<seg id="507">"the bill, consisting of six Paragrains and in local media including Youm7 and Egypt Independent curses, defines social media as" any application that runs through the Internet and is used to communicate with others by means of voice, videophone and text. "</seg>
<seg id="508">"it is unclear how the law is enforced when it is accepted, since the draft has no indication of how Egyptian authorities are not able to register with the registration, considering the fact that the Egyptian government is currently unable to guarantee the regulation at the level of social media companies."</seg>
<seg id="509">"Riyad Abdul Sattar, Member of Parliament and promoter of the bill, told the magazine Al-Monitor, registered users and users received a username and password to get through the firewall that blocked Facebook."</seg>
<seg id="510">"this could mean that Egypt is planning to create a firewall on a national level around Facebook. because of them, it would be necessary for Egyptians to submit information on their identity to access the network."</seg>

<seg id="515">"in my opinion, they imagine that just as they are violent in physical public and private spaces it could also be done online."</seg>
<seg id="516">"if I take them seriously, it means that they will set up a powerful monitoring system to filter citizens who seek approval or not. and that means a crazy system to monitor the activity of people and also to bring them to a trial process."</seg>
<seg id="517">"this is technically by no means realistic, but everything is possible in Egypt."</seg>
<seg id="518">"in order to be adopted as a law, the draft must first be debated by the Parliament's legislative and constitutional committee before it enters the plenary debate."</seg>

<seg id="528">"as Raza shows in the video," the Persian leopard is the only remaining predator in the Kurdish ecosystem "and the health and the growth of the ecosystem depends also on the fact that a large predator is present."</seg>
<seg id="529">"the chance to see a Persian leopard actually in the free game is low and goes against zero. when the team in the video shows that they have a shot of a big cat in the camera, Raza breaks in pure joy."</seg>

<seg id="544">"at the beginning of March 2017, the daily Kahoku Shimpo, the daily newspaper Kahoku Shimpo, documented the progress made in the last six years to rebuild the lives of those affected by the" triple disaster "of March 2011. a huge earthquake, a tsunami and an atom accident in Fukushima had triggered the catastrophe."</seg>
<seg id="545">"the Kahoku Shinguo newspaper has its headquarters in Sendai, which is located in Miyagi Prefecture. the prefecture of Miyagi was a real prefectures in Japan's northeast, which had to experience both the earthquake and the tsunami."</seg>
<seg id="546">Hundreds of thousands of people from Miyagi and the neighbouring prefectures Fukushima and Iwate were inevitable because the tsunami had left whole coastal towns from the map.</seg>
<seg id="547">"in addition, Fukushima prefecture has experienced a nuclear accident, already alone, 160 000 inhabitants had to leave their homes."</seg>
<seg id="548">The special report of the Kahoku Shimpo shows which progress was reached six years later in order to rebuild the life of local residents.</seg>
<seg id="549">The detailed report of the newspaper contains both the statistics of the Japanese rebuilding authority as well as survey results of those affected themselves.</seg>
<seg id="550">"housing construction in Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate"</seg>
<seg id="551">"the Kahoku Shinguo newspaper reported that up to December 2015, 77 percent of the planned replacement houses (the second-of-the-second, the saigai kouei juutaku) were finished in the Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate prefectures."</seg>
<seg id="552">"Miyagi recorded the biggest success among the three prefectures, here 80 percent of the planned replacement houses were completed."</seg>
<seg id="553">"Iwate has completed 75 percent of these buildings, whereas Fukushima with 70 percent represents the final light."</seg>
<seg id="554">"even six years after the catastrophe, even six years after the catastrophe, evacuated von Behelfsundermines (usefacsu juutaku) to settle into final replacement houses."</seg>
<seg id="555">After the three-fold catastrophe nearly 80 000 people were forced to live in shelters.</seg>
<seg id="556">"in December 2016 more and more 36,000 people from Miyagi, Fukushima and Iwate lived in such homes."</seg>
<seg id="557">"almost 40 percent of the years in 2011 were still living in emergency shelters, whereas Miyagi was more successful."</seg>
<seg id="558">"for Iwate, the number is 34 percent."</seg>
<seg id="559">The stand of work and everyday life in the three affected prefectures</seg>
<seg id="560">"as the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper could determine, 1074 of 1100 schools that were affected by misfortune, opened their doors until December 2016, which accounts for almost 98 percent of the schools of the three prefectures."</seg>
<seg id="561">Six years later the industrial rebuilding in the three prefectures is far more difficult.</seg>
<seg id="562">"while almost 100 percent of the fishing ports in Iwate and Miyagi are now in operation, only 30 percent of the fishing ports have resumed their operations in Fukushima."</seg>
<seg id="563">"the tsunami and the atomic accident, have large area in the three prefectures of agrarian land."</seg>
<seg id="564">"Miyagi could recover 93 percent of its agricultural land, with only 66 percent of agricultural land in Iwate and less than 50 percent destroyed agricultural land in Fukushima."</seg>
<seg id="565">"it is unlikely that this is only a consequence of nuclear accident, because only 690 hectares of 5 400 hectares of land-destroyed land of Fukushima are located in the" nuclear barrier zone. ""</seg>
<seg id="566">"in two of the three prefectures the tourism has recovered largely, but also here Fukushima remains far away."</seg>
<seg id="567">"the tourist figures in Miyagi and Iwate are up to 90 percent on the same level as before the misfortune. Fukushima, on the other hand, can only have 75 percent."</seg>
<seg id="568">"however, the Kahoku Shinguo newspaper reported that since the catastrophe almost half of the coastal inhabitants, it is more difficult to earn their livelihood."</seg>
<seg id="569">Is the native population prepared for the next big earthquake?</seg>
<seg id="570">"in order to determine the overall picture, the newspaper conducted numerous surveys among the local population and among the evacuation. she asked her about the status of reconstruction and also how its empathy has changed compared to the tsunami risk."</seg>
<seg id="571">"in their introduction of the article, the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper explains:"</seg>
<seg id="572">The Kahoku Shimpo conducted a survey to learn more about the tsunami awareness among the native population.</seg>
<seg id="573">"Euromonitor International has over 40 years' experience of publishing market research reports, business reference books and online information systems."</seg>
<seg id="574">"however, 55.9 percent of respondents are found that still haven't been done enough in disaster prevention."</seg>
<seg id="575">How it is about those who had to be evacuated from the Fukushima prefecture</seg>
<seg id="576">"in their edition commemorating the anniversary of the earthquake, the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper has also focused their attention on the situation of the evacuation from Fukushima."</seg>
<seg id="577">"Fukushima had not only had to witness the tremendous earthquake and devastating tsunami, no, Fukushima prefecture has also witnessed the worst, disastrous, nuclear accident that Japan had ever experienced."</seg>
<seg id="578">"of 160 000 evacuation from Fukushima, nearly 63 000 people were relocated to areas outside the prefecture."</seg>
<seg id="579">"at the beginning of 2016 some more than 23 000 people had been relocated to Fukushima, in permanent replacement houses."</seg>
<seg id="580">"after 2017, there are still 40,000 inhabitants of Fukushima outside their home prefecture."</seg>
<seg id="581">"in the disaster areas, most of the evacuation centres still exist in homes, older than 50 years old. these are building projects that are part of the Olympic Games, which are part of the Olympic Games, which will take place in Tokyo in 2020."</seg>

<seg id="628">It is two years ago when the activities were paralysed in the sugar cane factories.</seg>
<seg id="629">"after experiencing the sugar cane industry stood still in the region, and the factory lost its plants until only the rumor of steel and concrete remained."</seg>
<seg id="630">Approximately 272 workers had to invent themselves.</seg>

<seg id="692">Young people of the First Nations communities across Canada deal with topics that are important to them. they do it by means of hip-hop thanks to a number of walking workshops.</seg>
<seg id="693">"as part of the N'we Jinan-Tour, workshop leaders have been bringing workshops and youth centres directly to schools and youth centres in order to teach youth groups songwriting, recording, audio and video production and live performances."</seg>
<seg id="694">"the original workshops were led by the pedagogue David Hodges, who lives in Montreal and worked in North Quebec with ten Cree communities and then collaborated with the Cree Hip-Hop group The NorthStar."</seg>
<seg id="695">"the workshop assumes that the young participants engage in talks on topics such as" cultural identity, language, debate, love, self-acceptance, "or whatever comes to mind."</seg>
<seg id="696">These questions are inspiration for songs and videos in which teenagers are the main actors.</seg>
<seg id="697">"because the workshops were so popular, the team also worked with other First Nations communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and was invited to organize similar workshops with the tribe of the Winnebago in Nebraska."</seg>
<seg id="698">"this video of the school 'Na Aksa Gyilak' Yoo in the area of the tribe of the Kitsumkalum First Nation in British Columbia, for example, tells the story of Highway 16, also called Highway of Tears, a road section in western Canada, where almost two dozen mostly indigenous young women disappeared or murdered."</seg>
<seg id="699">The cases were largely unexplained.</seg>
<seg id="700">The next video of the Nemaska Cree First Nation uses the motif of a video player to convey how important the preservation of traditional customs and customs despite the influences caused by globalisation.</seg>
<seg id="701">"many of the songs appeared in indigenous languages, although the young people have not always mastered the languages of the First Nations."</seg>
<seg id="702">"in the following song, that the Whapmagoostui Cree First Nation has recorded, the chorus will be sung on Cree."</seg>
<seg id="703">The young people involved got some help from Gary Jolly from the Northstar Hip-Hop group who gave them a stopper in the Eastern James Bay Cree dialect.</seg>
<seg id="704">"on the Facebook page of N'we Jinan, the verse is available in circulation, as well as a translation into English, which is translated into German:"</seg>
<seg id="705">Sometimes I feel like nobody would ever be interested in myself</seg>
<seg id="706">But I try to continue my days on Earth</seg>
<seg id="707">That is the day when you will take our cry out</seg>
<seg id="708">Because we as youth have lost our way in life</seg>
<seg id="709">But I believe that we will rise up one day</seg>
<seg id="710">I don't want to see how they live a bad life</seg>
<seg id="711">This is how they can grow and also lead to our youth.</seg>
<seg id="712">So they can do what they intended for the Creator.</seg>

<seg id="718">In Japan you can see plastic dishes almost every restaurant.</seg>
<seg id="719">"to show potential customers what is exactly on the menu, are displayed near the entrance shokuhin sanpuru (the" "Plastics models of the dishes" ") of each food served in this restaurant."</seg>
<seg id="720">The customers look at these plastic dishes and then decide whether they enter the restaurant or go on.</seg>
<seg id="721">There is a whole industry dedicated to the manufacture of these plastic dishes.</seg>
<seg id="722">"in the tokioter district of Kappabashi, there are a variety of these small enterprises that produce precisely those plastic dishes that the German filmmaker Wim Wenders documented in his film Tokyo-Ga more than 20 years ago."</seg>
<seg id="723">"for most Japanese, these plastic dishes are so ordinary that they don't even notice them even more. however, a new trend will turn them into showy mobile accessories and other gadgets today."</seg>
<seg id="724">Naver Matomas published the Blogger itinii range of social media links and photos that show this unusual twist with the shokuhin sanpuru.</seg>
<seg id="725">"now in special sale: new with plastic courts decorated mobile phone bands, as shown in the Kichijoji Tokyu department store."</seg>
<seg id="726">"many of these artificial foods have been turned into kitschy collective objects, as in this case, refrigerator magnets:"</seg>
<seg id="727">Here are a few Shokuhin refrigerators for a new exhibition in Tokyo Station.</seg>
<seg id="728">The new boom in essentials is becoming increasingly more complex.</seg>
<seg id="729">"in this case, an emperor-don (a popular rice dish with seafood) was turned into a cell phone stand."</seg>
<seg id="730">For this triangular bowl (lol) we found a good use as a mobile phone stand.</seg>
<seg id="731">We also made this part for the exhibition in Tokyo Station.</seg>
<seg id="732">Here is an apple that holds your mobile phone:</seg>
<seg id="733">"designed to look like an apple, with a notch for the mobile phone, this is already a great design."</seg>
<seg id="734">And this is just the beginning of an increasing flight into the Comic.</seg>
<seg id="735">"some cell phone support and mobile designers allow you to make your own work of art. in this case ikura or Lachsaber is used, a popular topping that is served with white rice."</seg>
<seg id="736">On Twitter some users had their doubts:</seg>
<seg id="737">"is there someone who would say:" wow, cool, now can I decorate my mobile phone with laughter? "" "</seg>
<seg id="738">I think I will be the only one.</seg>
<seg id="739">"this interest in plastic courts can also take a less appetizing form, in order to surprise some colleagues or family members unpleasantly."</seg>
<seg id="740">Our latest mobile phone stand has the form of melted ice.</seg>
<seg id="741">"in addition, there are also rice balls (Onigiri), earrings and handybelts made of dried salmon."</seg>
<seg id="742">"more skurrile plastic dishes can be viewed at: itinii's Naver Matome blog post. or follow on Twitter the hashtag #," "usury" ""</seg>

<seg id="749">"in reports of domestic and foreign media about the notorious" fight against drug trafficking "in Mexico, the suspicion and killing regularly appear in statistics. however, these reflect not the extent of the human tragedy that this struggle entails."</seg>
<seg id="750">"the report on drug abuse such as El Chapo Guzmán, the Chief of the Sinaloa-Kartell, pressed the stories of the victims of the conflict completely into the background."</seg>
<seg id="751">"on the day after a violent incident, there is hardly anyone looking at the mourning or the churches that have learned to live with the pain."</seg>
<seg id="752">"behind each corpse, behind every bone fund in the hundreds of secret tombs, the stories of countless parents, sons and daughters, friends and partners, whose wounds may never be healed."</seg>
<seg id="753">"this is why the Mexican news portal Animal Político has launched the digital project" "aprender a Vivir Con El Narco" "(German:" "to live with drug trafficking" "), telling these victims a voice and tells stories of people who got into battle between the law enforcement authorities and cartels."</seg>
<seg id="754">Animal Político describes the project so:</seg>
<seg id="755">Organised crime cannot only be feared for our lives.</seg>
<seg id="756">The effects are far more profound.</seg>
<seg id="757">"for example, when shops close because they are threatened by traffickers and all municipalities therefore have to drive many kilometres to buy something such as milk."</seg>
<seg id="758">The Pain of the Sacrifice</seg>
<seg id="759">"a video with the title" Vidas que Cambian por el miedo "(German:" as fear lives, ") tells exactly these stories."</seg>
<seg id="760">"a main character is Guadalupe, a father looking for secret tombs every weekend."</seg>
<seg id="761">"or Emma Veleta Rodríguez, who lost her father only one day, her four siblings, her husband and two of her nephew."</seg>
<seg id="762">"priests:" "as every Sunday, we prepare ourselves again today for the task which we have placed to go and search for graves, according to the people we have loved."</seg>
<seg id="763">Guadalupe Contreras: "my son is called Antonio Ivan Contreras Mata.</seg>

<seg id="767">On 13 October he left the house.</seg>
<seg id="768">"Emma Veleta:" it's very difficult for me, because I am now alone with three children who need a training. "</seg>
<seg id="769">"there is also my mother, who is here with me too."</seg>
<seg id="770">At the moment they have no income.</seg>
<seg id="771">"you stand the insurance of my father, but they won't pay them out because they require a death certificate."</seg>
<seg id="772">Where should we get them? "</seg>
<seg id="773">The editors of "aprender a vivir con el Narco" explain why the project is so important:</seg>
<seg id="774">"we must not only show the faces of those who are afraid. we have to show the international community the conflicts, fragility and state leadership."</seg>
<seg id="775">The project is based on stories of readers and reports of journalists in high-risk areas.</seg>
<seg id="776">Here are some excerpts from the stories.</seg>
<seg id="777">"KYHB, a reader of Animal Político, wrote this post from Taxco, in the state of Guerrero in central Mexico."</seg>
<seg id="778">"their contribution reminds us that violence should never be regarded as normal, no matter what form it occurs:"</seg>
<seg id="779">I have been aware of the disease and sensational journalism for several years now.</seg>
<seg id="780">I am coming to newspaper kiosks every day and see the cover pages with images that can only originate from a textbook for criminology or from acts of specialists.</seg>
<seg id="781">It brings me out of the version.</seg>
<seg id="782">"sometimes I feel as if I am the only one who is disgusting or sad. it works, like a lack of respect for the person who once belonged to this body."</seg>
<seg id="783">I cannot be indifferent or consider this as normal.</seg>
<seg id="784">She continues to write:</seg>
<seg id="785">"no, it's not normal that my 10-year-old cousin thinks he wants to become Narco (German: drug dealers) if he is great. and it is also not normal that people hear songs about the" heroic deeds "of the offenders when they go through the streets."</seg>
<seg id="786">"for me it is as if they ridicule those who have lost someone, and those who fear that something happens to them."</seg>
<seg id="787">I see our weakness when stories become mere numbers in a statistic.</seg>
<seg id="788">"the crime of people is incredible for me when the death of six people and the disappearance of 43 students in a neighboring village are justified, that they were" "incessant". ""</seg>
<seg id="789">"I think they try to say that they remain spared by such tragedies, if they are not stirring and still."</seg>
<seg id="790">"Maribel L. from Mexico City wrote the article" Four month blackmail in the Hauptstadtdistrict, "as a family with threats was plundered."</seg>
<seg id="791">You think of everything you have lost and how some people can completely change your whole life in just a few days.</seg>
<seg id="792">"the pain of it never goes, the trauma remains, the fear comes up high when you are alone."</seg>
<seg id="793">"habits have changed, telephone numbers too."</seg>
<seg id="794">We only contact us if it is absolutely necessary.</seg>
<seg id="795">"the more we are from each other, the better."</seg>
<seg id="796">She closed her report with the words:</seg>
<seg id="797">"we want the others to be arrested, because you don't know when they are kidnapped or killed."</seg>
<seg id="798">"I asked myself in these terrible days if weeping would resolve my deeply rooted feelings, but the answer is no, because I forgot how to weep. I must learn to live with the pain."</seg>
<seg id="799">Journalist Mario Gutiérrez Vega released the article "The forgotten children of Ciudad Juárez: a generation signed by violence."</seg>
<seg id="800">"in the introduction, he raises questions like: who cares for the child of a missing wife and a man murdered by organised crime?"</seg>
<seg id="801">How is it to grow up in a settlement on the outskirts of the most dangerous city of Mexico?</seg>
<seg id="802">"he is not like other boys of his age, whose parents take care of them."</seg>
<seg id="803">"Bryan is a orphan and he tells he had to teach himself how to cook a egg, potatoes, tortillas warm and" Chichi "for the babies who live with him. this is his name for making bottles with water, sugar and milk powder."</seg>
<seg id="804">He tells of the nine scars on his left leg - one for each year of life.</seg>
<seg id="805">But they are insignificant compared to the pain in his eyes - unspeakably for a boy for whom all life consists of violence and who had to learn to live with it.</seg>
<seg id="806">"when he was five years old, he told him that his mother had disappeared."</seg>
<seg id="807">But this was not the day when his infancy ended.</seg>
<seg id="808">"his childhood was past two years earlier, when he was just a few blocks away from his home, the bloody body of his father, who had been shot by armed men from a passing car."</seg>
<seg id="809">"when Bryan was born, the situation in Juárez looked like this:"</seg>
<seg id="810">"Bryan was born in 2006, when violence was mixed by organised crime and the fight against the existing social problems in Juárez."</seg>
<seg id="811">"in 2008, 2009 and 2010 Juárez was the most dangerous city in the world due to the number of murders according to the state council for public security and the government of the Government of the United States."</seg>
<seg id="812">"in 2010 alone, the Prosecutor's Office counted 3103 Morde. this corresponds to an average of 8.5 murders per day."</seg>
<seg id="813">These are just a few of hundreds of thousands of stories that leave the organised crime in Mexico and enter into the soul of the country.</seg>
<seg id="814">"only a few stories live in the face of new headlines, but this project reminds us of those we must not forget."</seg>
<seg id="815">"in addition to the project" aprender a Vivir Con El Narco, "Animal Político has launched the data journalism project Narcodata, whose goal is to portray the complex information behind the failed struggle against drug trafficking in the last four decades."</seg>

<seg id="823">But it raises questions about our desire for images to messages.</seg>
<seg id="824">What happened in the Democratic Republic of Congo</seg>
<seg id="825">"in 2010, a tank wagon crossed the village of Sange in the east of the DR Congo, tilted around and exploded. 230 people came to life."</seg>
<seg id="826">"after the civil war, Africa's second largest country had been neglected and devastated."</seg>
<seg id="827">"tragically, the tank car dropped to the victim."</seg>
<seg id="828">"officials of the authorities described a fireball, the dozens of houses wrapped up, including a cinema nearby, which was full of people watching the soccer world championship."</seg>
<seg id="829">Houses plastered and charded corpses were scattered in the streets.</seg>
<seg id="830">Many people were burned to divinity.</seg>
<seg id="831">"a picture with the title" This is Nigeria. "by Imgur user Mystical Monkey, 12 January 2015.Several photos of the incident form the horrible scenes of this day."</seg>
<seg id="832">Above is an example of this.</seg>
<seg id="833">It shows numbers of charded bodies lined up on the floor while people look at them.</seg>
<seg id="834">But here the story is not their end.</seg>
<seg id="835">"over the years the same photo has been presented several times on social media, blogs and other platforms, and unfortunately not attributed to real but not related tragedies, especially events in Nigeria and Myanmar."</seg>
<seg id="836">What happened not in Nigeria and Myanmar</seg>
<seg id="837">"on 3 January 2015, Boko Haram attacked the remote Nigerian villages of Baga and Doro Gowon."</seg>
<seg id="838">Yewitnesses reported drastic of atrocities before they had to flee.</seg>
<seg id="839">Houses and shops were burned down and dead bodies were in streets and bushes.</seg>
<seg id="840">"there were reports, according to which 150 to 2,000 people were massacred."</seg>
<seg id="841">"but the numbers could not be confirmed." "no one stayed back to count corpses," "said a population of Human Rights Watch."</seg>
<seg id="842">"many were crushed, shot or burned."</seg>
<seg id="843">"only on the basis of satellite images, the follow-up time could be illustrated."</seg>
<seg id="844">The reason for the attack was also uncertain but the army base in Baga was a permanent conflict between the military Nigerias and the attempt of Boko Haram to win land (examples from 2013 and 2015).</seg>
<seg id="845">And here the image from the DR Congo appeared once more than evidence of the fact and the possible extent of the attack was presented:</seg>
<seg id="846">That is Nigeria.</seg>
<seg id="847">"a massacre of 2,000 people took place in Paris for two days."</seg>
<seg id="848">They are not Charlie.</seg>
<seg id="849">They are dead.</seg>
<seg id="850">"in fact, this misuse of the image from the DR Congo is only one in a series of misdepreciation; Africa Check has been documented in Nigeria since 2014."</seg>
<seg id="851">"in all these cases, the image was presented as evidence of mass killings."</seg>
<seg id="852">"one step further, personal comments such as this may falsely falsify the image from the DR Congo with sources of mass media in connection to provide arguments."</seg>
<seg id="853">The image from Sange also appeared in connection with the deadly pursuit of the Muslim Rohingya in Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="854">"according to a flash announcement, published by the United Nations, those who were able to flee blows, rape and some dead, some through burning."</seg>
<seg id="855">"while others reported about the violence against the Rohingya, posts such as the following appeared, which brought these descriptions with photos from the DR Congo:"</seg>
<seg id="856">"this picture comes from an Saudi Arabian news site, which, in 2012, claimed that President Myanmar's Thein Sein have said, monks and politicians would have taken part in the assassination of Rohingya Muslims. in addition, they had used the image from the DR Congo to visualize this information."</seg>

<seg id="928">There are two strong themes or frames (frames) that go through these posts. the first frame focuses on religion.</seg>
<seg id="929">The photograph was used in relation to greater discussions about silence in connection with the assassinations of Christians by Muslims or - to defend the Muslims - the murder of Rohingyas by Buddhists.</seg>
<seg id="930">A second framing uses the image to discuss how an African life is undervalued compared to a European or French life.</seg>
<seg id="931">"to understand religion and the value of human life is important both. therefore, it is worthwhile to examine how images are used in connection with these efforts."</seg>
<seg id="932">"however, a deeper question is what happens if readers can no longer believe these pictures."</seg>
<seg id="933">"with social media, there are tens of people who are accidental to share the water around a tragedy."</seg>
<seg id="934">"this mood of mis- and false information suggests that actual atrocities are untrue and the actual horror of what is actually happening in the DR Congo, Nigeria and Myanmar?"</seg>
<seg id="935">The spread of violent images has already been debated extensively (here for example).</seg>
<seg id="936">"one argument is that refusing images of a refusal to acknowledge the tragedy, and sometimes these images are even demanded by the victims themselves."</seg>
<seg id="937">"at the same time, the concern that forcible images readers and viewers are desensitizing and taking them the ability to feel empathy (such as this study, which examined how violent media work to help others)."</seg>
<seg id="938">"while there is a lot to discuss about violent representations in the news media, there is fact that they are indispensable for today's news reporting."</seg>
<seg id="939">"technologists experimenting with algorithms to support the fight against" "Fake News". "they will have to think thoroughly about the situation in which a picture suggests something, which can actually be replaced by the context or completely abused."</seg>

<seg id="1155">"with the aim of a new checking out of the public debt of Puerto Rico, which amounted to 72 million US dollars, the march started at the capital Capitol, the government building of the capital, and went up to the Plaza de Colón in the old town of San Juan."</seg>

<seg id="1187">"the book published last year and is licensed under licence, contains a number of articles dealing with the free culture in the face of oppression."</seg>
<seg id="1188">It is a tribute to Bassel and his work.</seg>

<seg id="1191">"activists, artists, designers, developers, researchers and authors who are involved in the movements for free knowledge, have worked on page to find out about the fog that surrounds our newsfeeds and to create something meaningful from our different experiences."</seg>
<seg id="1192">"this book is an attempt to free Bassel Khartabil, the beloved and acclaimed Internet volunteers who have been detained in Syria since 15 March 2012."</seg>
<seg id="1193">His name was removed from the directory of the Adra prison where he sat on 3 October 2015.</seg>
<seg id="1194">"since then, we have no information about his current state or residence."</seg>
<seg id="1195">"the introductory part of his book with the title collective memory gives his friends and family a voice that wants to release his release and who want to know him back in his normal life and in freedom, and immediately."</seg>
<seg id="1196">"seeing how Bassel pays a high price for his participation in a free culture, many of us have let us start thinking about their own destinies, actions and decisions."</seg>
<seg id="1197">Why are we here today?</seg>
<seg id="1198">What did we choose?</seg>
<seg id="1199">What have we given up in this process of sometimes extreme beliefs?</seg>
<seg id="1200">The web developer for open source and digital assets has been in the custody of Syrian government authorities since March 2012.</seg>
<seg id="1201">"in October 2015 Bassel from the Adra prison, a non-military institution, was transferred to an unknown location."</seg>
<seg id="1202">"his wife, the writer and lawyer Noura Ghazi, reported that the" Military Police Bassel had taken on the basis of a "strictly secret" command of the military court from his cell in Adra. "</seg>
<seg id="1203">"Ghazi reported that she was contacted by persons on 12 November 2015, who presented themselves as insiders of the Assad administration and informed them of an alleged death sentence against her husband."</seg>
<seg id="1204">"however, his place of stay and state remain unknown."</seg>
<seg id="1205">"a pioneer of creative commons in Syria and actively involved in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia, Bassel played a crucial role in expanding access to the Internet and knowledge for the public in Syria."</seg>
<seg id="1206">"Barry Threw, a designer, technologist and currently the director of New Palmyra, a project that founded Bassel, writes on pages 10 and 11 of the book:"</seg>
<seg id="1207">"perhaps none of Bassels was more predictable than the work that he began with a group of archaeologists and 3D artists around 2005, to virtually reconstructed the ancient ruins of Palmyra."</seg>
<seg id="1208">"Palmyra, one of the most important archaeological sites in the world, was the crossroads of numerous civilizations and here merging Greek-Roman architectural types with local traditions and Persian influences."</seg>
<seg id="1209">"at that time Bassel was not able to know that ten years after he began working with this work, the IS would put all this architecture, which is not only embodied by the cultural heritage of Sysriens but of the world."</seg>
<seg id="1210">This strip in digital archaeology and conservation has created a time capsule that will be invaluable to the public as well as for scientists and artists in the future.</seg>
<seg id="1211">"sorry, there is no translation for this news-article."</seg>
<seg id="1212">Noura Ghazi also contributed to the book and writes about the passion of her husband to share his knowledge with others even during his time in jail:</seg>
<seg id="1213">"I spent my entire life with it, dreaming of freedom and bassel taught me to embrace them."</seg>
<seg id="1214">I am overwhelmed when I call his name.</seg>
<seg id="1215">Bassel taught me English even when he was in detention.</seg>
<seg id="1216">"I learned to read, write and speak English well."</seg>
<seg id="1217">He has always shared his knowledge with everyone who asked. he has taught other prisoners to read and speak English.</seg>
<seg id="1218">Bassel opened the door to technology. he taught me to use both computers and smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="1219">He brought me the internet.</seg>
<seg id="1220">"he taught other prisoners how they use computers, at least theoretically, without actually holding one in their hands."</seg>
<seg id="1221">"Ghazi is also the author of Waiting (Warten), a Prosabuch that she wrote in the years 2012 to 2015, when he was in custody."</seg>
<seg id="1222">Bassel and Noura worked together in the book for a year.</seg>
<seg id="1223">"she smuggled the lyrics to him, when she visited him and he translated it from Arabic into English."</seg>

<seg id="1230">That I lose my mind at the moment in which we embrace</seg>

<seg id="1240">And about your absence to cry and smile.</seg>
<seg id="1241">I testify to myself that I will return soon...</seg>

<seg id="1248">"since the beginning of the protests in 2011 against the Bashar al-Assad regime, more than 65,000 people have disappeared according to the Syrian Network for Human Rights (Syrian Network for Human Rights)."</seg>
<seg id="1249">Those who were arrested or disappeared under violence by the regime were tortured or even executed.</seg>
<seg id="1250">"until 2016, according to the international human rights organisation Amnesty International has died at least 17.723 Syrians in custody since 2011."</seg>

<seg id="1254">Mozambique: due to corruption convicted director after release of detention again on previous post</seg>
<seg id="1255">"Mozambique reacted with anger against a corruption incident, where a member of the government returned to the workplace in the state apparatus, where corruption was committed."</seg>
<seg id="1256">"this is Diodino Cambaza, which was arrested in 2008 and was sentenced to 22 years in prison together with four other defendants due to the untreatification of 54 million Metikal (about 800 000 euros)."</seg>
<seg id="1257">"the money came from public funds from the airports of Mozambique, whose council stood at Cambaza between 2005 and 2008."</seg>
<seg id="1258">"Cambaza was released in 2016 because of good leadership and immediately called for his return to the company, which happened on 19 April."</seg>
<seg id="1259">"in accordance with an opinion of the Republic's Attorney General, who evaluated the application, there would be no obstacle to Cambaza, again to refer to his old posts, since the company did not carry out any disciplinary approach after his detention."</seg>
<seg id="1260">"however, many inhabitants do not call the action well."</seg>
<seg id="1261">"the Centre for Public Integrity (Centro de Integridade Pública, short CIP), a local institution that advocates public transparency in an interview with the Deutsche Welle, condemned the decision of the company to restore the director:"</seg>
<seg id="1262">"represents a setback in the fight against corruption and illustrates the lack of transparency, and is even a backstep with regard to the efforts of our legal system, so the CIP."</seg>
<seg id="1263">What we are aware of is that the company should also introduce a disciplinary approach against the conflicting question.</seg>
<seg id="1264">"however, the company apparently did not show reasonable legal steps for the application of the corresponding functions."</seg>
<seg id="1265">"Egídio Vaz, an important voice in the Mozambique social media, also rejected this behaviour and considers the case as" "disgusting" ":"</seg>
<seg id="1266">"if Cambaza would be a competent type, he would be adviser after he was sentenced to a prison sentence and half of them had lowered."</seg>
<seg id="1267">"he could hold paid lectures and motivating speeches, he could advise and polish his image."</seg>
<seg id="1268">"but since he is incompetent, he has consented to be reintegrated into the company, which he helped to inflict damage."</seg>
<seg id="1269">Therefore it is obvious: Cambaza is gladly paid for his silence.</seg>
<seg id="1270">Disgusting!</seg>
<seg id="1271">"Bitone Viage, young Mozambique and student of political science in Brazil says the director has no moral:"</seg>
<seg id="1272">"Cambaza is rewarded by the state because he insulted him, I cannot believe that one reward someone in such a way that has already insulted the state."</seg>
<seg id="1273">"Cambaza is missing morality to return and serve the state, * he already had a unique opportunity to serve the state, but instead only served by the state."</seg>
<seg id="1274">"Cambaza had used the state as handing it for an inexhaustible source of money, and the state itself became tired of this man who was preloaded and finally sentenced to a long prison term."</seg>
<seg id="1275">"honestly, I don't know why this man was so rewarded."</seg>
<seg id="1276">"Francey Zeúte prefers to remind the Prime Minister of Mozambique, Samora Machel to remind that a thief is in prison:"</seg>
<seg id="1277">"thieves belong to the prison of Samora Machel, not only to remain remembered as the first independent president, but also as a sharp, one-tapping and - incidentally - prophetic speaker."</seg>
<seg id="1278">"one of his most famous oral presentations was when he confirmed that" an ambitious person is capable of all, even the fatherland for his ambitions, his own individual interest to sell. "</seg>
<seg id="1279">"Samora also said," I don't know if an ambitious person changes, my experience shows that it is not so. he changes tactics, but he does not turn away from his ambitions. "</seg>
<seg id="1280">An ambitious human being is criminally at the same time. "</seg>
<seg id="1281">"in Twitter, the reactions were also similar:"</seg>
<seg id="1282">"Cambaza was sentenced to 22 years in prison, he sat 10 years and was free."</seg>

<seg id="1286">Facebook blocks the racist word "Kalar" in Myanmar and censored many users wrongly</seg>
<seg id="1287">The Burmese word "Kalar pae" means chickpeas or splits.</seg>
<seg id="1288">"photo by Sanjay Acharya, Wikipedia Commons, Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 Unported"</seg>
<seg id="1289">"according to Facebook users in Myanmar, the well-known social network took their posts from the net because they contained the word 'Kalar'."</seg>
<seg id="1290">"although the origin of the word is still being discussed, it is usually used to refer to people of East-Indian origin or generally used as adjective" Indian. ""</seg>
<seg id="1291">"Facebook censored the word" "Kalar" "or" "Second" "(in Burmese script) as part of an initiative to tackle the widespread problem of hate speech in Burma in the social network."</seg>
<seg id="1292">"in recent years, the rise of radical nationalist movements gave the word an extremely absent connotation."</seg>
<seg id="1293">"in particular, it is a word that is mostly used by ultra-nationalists as hate speech against Muslims who represent a minority of the population in Myanmar."</seg>
<seg id="1294">"but in the effort to fight hate speech in Myanmar, the company has censored a lot of meaningful content on its platform."</seg>
<seg id="1295">"Kalar's may normally be associated with racism, but the word itself does not automatically generate hate speech."</seg>
<seg id="1296">"the context is important & # 8212; many people have reported that even posts, in which they have discussed the use of the word, have been censored for their use."</seg>
<seg id="1297">"moreover, there are several Burmese words with basic meanings that have the same letter as' Kalar '."</seg>
<seg id="1298">"for example, chair is written on Burmisch also 'Kalar htaing', which contains the same letters as well as other words like 'Kalar pae' (splitting bens), 'Kalar OAT' (camel) or 'kalarkaar' (curtain)."</seg>
<seg id="1299">The Facebookuser Aung Kaung Myat explained the various meanings of words with the sound of 'Kalar':</seg>
<seg id="1300">A post of one of my friends was deleted today because he contained the word Kalar.</seg>
<seg id="1301">"however, he had asked his friends in a spiritual way whether they knew how to alleviate his back pain by making a word play."</seg>
<seg id="1302">"the phrase ku la -" "Healing" "(a) + the question word (la) in Burmese - resembles the racist expression very, but the context is completely different."</seg>
<seg id="1303">There were different reactions to the initiative of Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="1304">"Zin Win Htet is the opinion that she will lessen the hate speech of radical nationalists, but also emphasised that Facebook should be more analytical before it dissolves all posts that were suspected to disseminate racism."</seg>
<seg id="1305">Facebook does not delete the word "Kalar" manually.</seg>
<seg id="1306">It automatically filters the word automatically.</seg>
<seg id="1307">The automatism will not understand what you write on Facobook.</seg>
<seg id="1308">"what it should do instead, is to carefully analyze the post and check it by checking the words by the next."</seg>
<seg id="1309">"for example," "Kalar Htine" "(chair) and" "Kalar pae". ""</seg>
<seg id="1310">"the good is that these dirty nationalists, who spread hate speech, receive a pretty good lesson."</seg>
<seg id="1311">Now it is time to circumcise their nationalism.</seg>
<seg id="1312">"while the action may send a strong signal to everyone who disseminates hate speech, the efficiency of this strategy may not stop long."</seg>
<seg id="1313">"the experiences of social networks in China such as Sina Weibo and WeChat have proven that the censorship of keywords often becomes a cat and mouse game, whereby the users of social networks simply will start using a new word or alternative spelling of censored word to express their views."</seg>
<seg id="1314">"the author ung Kaung Myat described how Facebook began to delete his posts, when he wanted to tell his friends only that the word 'Kalar' is banished from the social network:"</seg>
<seg id="1315">"when I was aware of this new policy of Facebook, I made a post to tell my Facebook friends that the word is locked."</seg>
<seg id="1316">"ironically, my post was removed from Facebook and I was told the liken, post and parts of content for 24 hours because the post" "Facebook Community Standards refused." ""</seg>
<seg id="1317">Facebook has a variety of posts from people who do not have any negative intentions or who simply try to show their opinion against the hate speech of radical nationalists.</seg>
<seg id="1318">Patrick Murphy wrote that his post was removed who has nothing to do with hate speech:</seg>
<seg id="1319">Post without hate speech from Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="1320">"in the post, the author shared his opinion about why extreme nationalism and religious fundamentalism in the country are bad."</seg>
<seg id="1321">"Chan Myae Khine believes that Facebook should have done more before the start of the initiative, for example the Burmese Internet community to ask advice:"</seg>
<seg id="1322">"Facebook may have a benevolent intention to lessen racism in Burma through its platform, but it does not work."</seg>
<seg id="1323">Censorship such words will only bring more hatred within the different communities.</seg>
<seg id="1324">"in addition, it seems as if they have started this without local context or technical support, and as words like" "chair" "or" "peas curry". ""</seg>
<seg id="1325">"even when they found that they made mistakes, they did not try to correct the wrongly deleted posts."</seg>
<seg id="1326">"if they had only a little more respect for the 15 million benefits they had a big turnover, that would be great."</seg>
<seg id="1327">Laptops automatic censorship ensured a lot of ridicule amongst users.</seg>
<seg id="1328">"instead of taking it seriously, users now make fun via Facebook and consciously write the word 'Kalar' not in the context of hate speech to see if their posts are taken from the net."</seg>
<seg id="1329">"here you can see some screenshots of Facebook posts that have no hate speech contained, but still removed:"</seg>

<seg id="1337">"among other things, hate speech in social networks should additionally heat violence in the communities in Myanmar, especially in Rakhine area, where disputes between Muslims and Buddhists have forced thousands to flee."</seg>
<seg id="1338">Facebook was criticized for his failure to bring out the balancing hate speech on his Burmese sides.</seg>

<seg id="1343">The child marriage is now illegally illegal in Trinidad and Tobago.</seg>
<seg id="1344">"on 9 June 2017, Parliament of the country unanimously approved a law to prohibit this practice, so that the age-capable age is 18."</seg>
<seg id="1345">"at that time, Brother Harrypersad Maharaj, the leader of the Interreligious Organisation (IRO), a group representing representatives of the various religious groups of the country, said that the state should not be interfered, since that, age does not determine maturity."</seg>
<seg id="1346">"this happened in spite of the fact that Trinidad and Tobago is a contract partner of the United Nations Children's Rights Convention, the minors as,, every person under 18 years."</seg>
<seg id="1347">"statistics of the UN for the years 2002-2012 indicate that the proportion of children, who were already married in 15, was 2.8 percent in Trinidad and Tobago, and with 18 were 8.1 percent."</seg>
<seg id="1348">"in 2011, the State Statistical Office confirmed that more than 8400 girls and 1300 boys were married to 19 in 1997-2007."</seg>
<seg id="1349">"online petitions and social media movements that were anxious to abolish laws for childbirth, followed at the foot and gratifying themselves great support. without doubt, they helped to bring about this result."</seg>
<seg id="1350">"nevertheless, not everything went smoothly."</seg>
<seg id="1351">"for example, a Hindu leader, for example, had no concerns to tell the critics of the children's marriage, they should, condemned to take care of their own affairs."</seg>
<seg id="1352">"this kind of religious opposition provided tensions in this really uncomplicated thing, and at some point there were doubts as to whether the opposition would agree to the bill at all."</seg>
<seg id="1353">"but at the beginning of 2017, the draft law was decided against the child's marriage - despite 4 senators (including a woman) of the opposition and an independent, which could be discussed in the House of Representatives, where a simple majority would make him a law."</seg>
<seg id="1354">Now only the President of the country must agree and announce the law.</seg>
<seg id="1355">One of the country's senators posted a status update on Facebook which posted Leslie-Ann Boiselle on Instagram:</seg>
<seg id="1356">Mr. Senator Clarence Rambharat: the bill against the child marriage was voted in the House of Representatives with 35 votes for this and not one single against it.</seg>
<seg id="1357">"after having previously decided in the Senate, the draft can now become a law."</seg>
<seg id="1358">The majority of the social media users was thrilled because the laws were finally changed to the child before.</seg>
<seg id="1359">"Facebook member Lovell Francis, who suffers a ministerial post in the Ministry of Education, said:"</seg>

<seg id="1393">"for more than a month, Turkey has now blocked the popular and crowdsourcing principle based encyclopedia Wikipedia."</seg>
<seg id="1394">"day by day, it becomes clearer how important the platform for users is to find and share useful information as well as reliable information."</seg>
<seg id="1395">Both students and reporters and fans of TV series defend themselves against blocking.</seg>
<seg id="1396">"although many technologies-based Internet users are accustomed to using conversion tools for blocked sites (an actual article from the New York Times reported that Turkey has the third largest VPN prevalence in the world), most ordinary Wikipedia users do not fall into this category."</seg>
<seg id="1397">"although Turkey has been publishing articles from Wikipedia as recently in a published report by Berkman Klein Center for Internet & amp; Society at Harvard University, regular blockages of the internet have been held since 2007 after the Internet Act (No. 5651) was adopted."</seg>
<seg id="1398">"according to China, Turkey is the most known country in the world when it comes to the massive censorship of Wikipedia."</seg>
<seg id="1399">"while the platform remains locked, there are now several mirrorsides (pages that reflect the contents of Wikipedia and frequently updated)."</seg>
<seg id="1400">"a solution came from IPFS (Interplanetary File System), as the platform used all Turkish Wikipedia sites on its decentralized peer-to-peer network (i.e. host computer connections), which is not based on the system of domain names and thus makes a complete censorship difficult."</seg>
<seg id="1401">The content is still available in spite of legal prohibition.</seg>
<seg id="1402">In a blog post IPFS reports about his efforts:</seg>
<seg id="1403">"after having heard the news (about the blocking of Wikipedia), we were able to take snapshots from Wikipedia to the IPFS platform. so there is the possibility to read the content on decentralized and distributed manner."</seg>
<seg id="1404">"this can help users to view at least all Wikipedia contents, even if they cannot reach the website www.wikipedia.org itself."</seg>
<seg id="1405">"IPFS also announced that this step was carried out independently of the Wikimedia Foundation, and it is merely a screenshot and no live or dynamic versions of the website."</seg>
<seg id="1406">"however, Wikimedia was involved in other efforts to bypass the lock."</seg>
<seg id="1407">"Cristian Consonni of Wikimedia Italy has produced both tr.vikiansiklopedia.com, a mirrorpage from Wikipedia, as well as WikiMirror, an open source project that anyone can use to host similar mirrorpages when Wikipedia is locked in the respective country Wikipedia."</seg>

<seg id="1415">Photo of Sagar Giri.</seg>
<seg id="1416">With permission.</seg>
<seg id="1417">Sagar Giri was never satisfied with the photos he saw around him. they were blurred with badly positioned motifs and washed colours.</seg>
<seg id="1418">This motivated him to carry a camera and try to commit the situation.</seg>
<seg id="1419">At that time he was still a child.</seg>
<seg id="1420">"today, at the age of 28, Sagar, Neptune, endeavours to bring Nepal to the international stage."</seg>
<seg id="1421">"his hometown right next to the Chitwan National Park, offers him the perfect opportunity to shoot photos that draw attention to Nepal's wildlife."</seg>
<seg id="1422">He described Facebook as this first-class situation in his work helps:</seg>
<seg id="1423">"I live at the edge of Chitwan National Park, a world natural heritage. what could be better for a passionate game wildlife photographer!!"</seg>
<seg id="1424">I just rested at home when suddenly re-invoked Navarre (the manager of Chitwan Gaida Lodge). he had received a call from my father that on the banks of the Rapti river would be a leopard.</seg>
<seg id="1425">The river dam is only a few minutes away from the tourist resort of Sauraha.</seg>
<seg id="1426">Immediately I ran away with my camera and was there in a few minutes.</seg>
<seg id="1427">"my father observed him and showed me the place on the other river side, where the leopard was and I immediately began to crashing pictures!!"</seg>
<seg id="1428">Sagar seeks to cooperate with the authorities in order to gain global recognition for Nepal's nature and would like to deepen the understanding that wild animals are not so frightening as they look.</seg>
<seg id="1429">"and he should know it, for he stood opposite to Tigers face to face:"</seg>
<seg id="1430">A tiger can not be bothered by the opinion of the sheep when sleeping!!</seg>
<seg id="1431">Late in the evening. the light is too weak.</seg>
<seg id="1432">Sleeping time for all animals and birds.</seg>
<seg id="1433">"also, because of the darkness on the way home, when suddenly the king of the buke appeared. he immediately starts to see us and he stares me through the Sal trees!!"</seg>
<seg id="1434">"to promote the protection of wild animals, Sagar placed the logo" "I click for conservation" "(lit.: I click for environmental protection) on his photos."</seg>
<seg id="1435">"however, his passion for the promotion of Nepali nature and wildlife is not always easy."</seg>
<seg id="1436">He waited for 22 days and mostly lived in a tent to take photographs of Ottern in the Bardia National Park. up to 12 days it took until he could photograph a tiger and six to seven days for the perfect photo of birds that live near the tourist accommodations.</seg>

<seg id="1470">A revised version has been published here as part of a content sharing agreement.</seg>
<seg id="1471">"in many parts of India, women have the greatest care to pronounce the name of their husbands or even older men in the family."</seg>
<seg id="1472">Instead they use a pronouns or say "father of my child."</seg>
<seg id="1473">"from Chhattisgarh to Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh women give women to respect the husband because of their social pressure, as well as fear of the consequences they should disregard the norm to get this practice alive."</seg>
<seg id="1474">"last year, Malati Mahatoto was convicted of the Indian state of Odisha by a court court and violated by her family and the village community after she had addressed a married relative with names."</seg>
<seg id="1475">"the tradition of its wives also does not give name to the name, is also widespread among men. however, they have far fewer assurances to fear, if at all, they should not follow this practice."</seg>
<seg id="1476">"in the small village of Walhe in the district of Pune, in Maharashtra, nine women, including health personnel as well as housewives, a unique club and were thus quickly became the main theme of the city."</seg>
<seg id="1477">It is a place only for them alone in which they can discuss and discuss the intricacies of the Patriarchate.</seg>
<seg id="1478">"as one of 56 clubs in 13 Indian states, he is part of the campaign # KhelBadal, which is operated by the Community Video Volunteers and settles for the exploitation of the patriarchy."</seg>
<seg id="1479">Rohini Paola has been working with her video camera for seven years with the help of her video camera on the discovery of practices such as child marriage and the exile of HIV- and AIDS-infected.</seg>
<seg id="1480">It reports how these clubs have created a safe place for these women and at the same time made them ambassadors of change.</seg>
<seg id="1481">"the first video that Rohini showed in her discussion round, acted by women who did not call her husbands by name."</seg>
<seg id="1482">She chose this subject because she wanted to talk about the patriarchy with a problem with which women can easily identify.</seg>
<seg id="1483">"the name of their husbands does not speak out loud, is a custom that they all maintain and never questioned."</seg>
<seg id="1484">Rohini says:</seg>
<seg id="1485">This tradition testifies that a woman respects her husband and wishes him a long life.</seg>
<seg id="1486">A woman who does not stop this will be considered as cunning as woman without morals.</seg>
<seg id="1487">Tradition is so deeply rooted that we have never thought about this discussion.</seg>
<seg id="1488">"at the beginning, Rohini, who had never called her husband by name, wanted to try out at home, as it is running."</seg>
<seg id="1489">She showed the video of the discussion round her husband and her mother-in-law.</seg>
<seg id="1490">Rohini says:</seg>
<seg id="1491">My mother-in-law and my husband still silent after the video was over.</seg>
<seg id="1492">"Prakash, my husband, turned to me and said I should call him from now on his name."</seg>
<seg id="1493">"with this self-confidence in the luggage, Rohini started their first discussion club."</seg>
<seg id="1494">"many women had never heard the word" patriarchy "before. some believed that it was a good thing, because it meant that the younger members of a family, especially girls and women, would be protected."</seg>
<seg id="1495">"at the beginning of the round, Rohini showed a video about the problem in Uttar Pradesh."</seg>
<seg id="1496">"after the video projection, the women tried to get the discussion with an exercise."</seg>
<seg id="1497">"Rohini asked each participant to say the name of her husband with different feelings - happy, angry, sad, loving and so on."</seg>
<seg id="1498">"then they all asked," "If we cannot tell the name of our husbands, but they can call us how they want it means that they do not respect us?"</seg>
<seg id="1499">Should it not be equivalent? "</seg>
<seg id="1500">"some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day when they brought the name of her husbands on their lips," "says Rohini Pawar of the village of Walhe in Maharashtra on the breaking of an age-old tradition in which married women should never pronounce the name of her husbands."</seg>
<seg id="1501">Rohini says:</seg>
<seg id="1502">"a woman was so shy that during the whole exercise, she was just before him, and another decided to release the whole frustration against him and his family by cursing him."</seg>
<seg id="1503">The expression on their faces was ecstatic.</seg>
<seg id="1504">I think I will never forget it again.</seg>
<seg id="1505">"even in the adrenalin rush to have broken with an ancient custom, the women decided that they would actually try to name their husbands in the name."</seg>
<seg id="1506">And they kept their word.</seg>
<seg id="1507">"in the next few days, Rohini received a variety of reports."</seg>
<seg id="1508">The husband of a woman called Rohini and asked what ideas she put the women in her head: his wife couldn't stop saying his name.</seg>
<seg id="1509">Another club member decided to do it for dinner in front of the whole family.</seg>
<seg id="1510">"when her mother-in-law she stared, she got scared and said that it was a mistake."</seg>
<seg id="1511">Another woman said: "Rohini said I should do it."</seg>
<seg id="1512">A husband of a participant was less understanding and the situation arted in violence.</seg>
<seg id="1513">"Rohini reports how women have tried to stop other practices, such as wearing the cinnoberred dot on the forehead, indicating the Ehestatus:"</seg>
<seg id="1514">Why only women have to show that they are married?</seg>
<seg id="1515">"I said to my husband, that I would wear the cinnoberred point if he did it."</seg>
<seg id="1516">He laughed only and I stopped wearing it.</seg>
<seg id="1517">"the other women did not completely listen to it, but think they are now in a better position to choose not to wear it on some days."</seg>
<seg id="1518">"for many women, the discussion club is a safe place where they can exchange their opinions and goals."</seg>
<seg id="1519">"" "we make a trip for every debating club."</seg>
<seg id="1520">Normally we pack lunch and water and go out to the field.</seg>
<seg id="1521">"I don't want the women to worry about who could hear something," she says. "</seg>
<seg id="1522">During the last months she celebrated her own birthdays with cakes for the first time in her life; she danced and sang about things that she never thought about before.</seg>
<seg id="1523">Rohini says:</seg>
<seg id="1524">"I have been working on these problems for so many years and yet I also have talked about some things, for example how our identities are linked to our husbands, have never been so honest."</seg>
<seg id="1525">"it feels great to be able to say certain things loud, no matter how small they occur."</seg>
<seg id="1526">In a discussion round we talked about the concept of honor and how it is connected to the clothing.</seg>
<seg id="1527">Some women in the group have only supported Saris since their marriage.</seg>
<seg id="1528">"for most of them this is okay, but some wanted to wear a sala-cta, a wide shirt over a pants, they have not dared."</seg>
<seg id="1529">"after much dispute and discussion about the advantages of their own handicap, morality connected with the saris and much more, Rohini smuggled her own couple of Kurtas (upper hemden) into a discussion round, so that the women could carry them."</seg>
<seg id="1530">"next, they decided to plan a trip to Goa in which they can wear jeans and Rohini is confident that they will succeed."</seg>
<seg id="1531">"on the question of whether in the five months since its first discussion club has changed something, Rohini confirms that things are slowly coming into play:"</seg>
<seg id="1532">We have only made small steps so far.</seg>
<seg id="1533">"some women tried it a few times, but then stopped to say the name of her husband."</seg>
<seg id="1534">"some, including me, make it yet, but only if they are alone and not other family members."</seg>
<seg id="1535">Only one or two continues to say the name of their husbands; only one or two women are now wearing Zinnoberrot on their forehead at any time.</seg>
<seg id="1536">The women in the discussion club know that the changes they want to achieve in their lives - such as catching up more freedom of movement or choice - at the end of a difficult navigating river.</seg>
<seg id="1537">"by giving each other self-confidence, they are aware that they are sitting in the same boat."</seg>
<seg id="1538">How Rohini declares:</seg>
<seg id="1539">Each of us is a victim of the patriarchy.</seg>
<seg id="1540">I am also.</seg>
<seg id="1541">But this club gives each of us the confidence that something will change.</seg>
<seg id="1542">And I know that it is not limited to 30 families. there will be a chain reaction when every woman goes home in the club and told other people about what we are talking about and what we do.</seg>
<seg id="1543">We all sit in the same boat.</seg>

<seg id="1626">"a photo by Liu Xiaobo and Liu Xia, probably just recently made."</seg>
<seg id="1627">"this story was originally published on July 8, 2017 at Hong Kong Free Press."</seg>
<seg id="1628">The following version will be published as part of a partnership agreement via Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="1629">The case of the imprisoned Chinese Dissident Liu Xiaobo has attracted attention in the international community after his lawyer had announced at the end of June that he had been admitted to hospital for liver cancer at the end of June.</seg>
<seg id="1630">"in 2009, Liu was sentenced to eleven years in prison for" Subversion "(state endangering) after being involved in the draft of the Charter 08, a manifesto that demanded the democratic reforms in China."</seg>
<seg id="1631">He was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010.</seg>
<seg id="1632">"the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in China referred to Lius case as an" "internal matter" "and tells a spokesman, he did not consider it as" "not necessary to discuss this thing with any other country."</seg>
<seg id="1633">"nevertheless, China continues to release calls from the international community, the Nobel Prize winner and his wife, poet Liu Xia, or permit him to be treated abroad."</seg>
<seg id="1634">"while some countries have criticised the strict treatment of the couple in Beijing, others are completely wiped out of the subject."</seg>
<seg id="1635">Hong Kong Free Press has summarised some reactions from abroad.</seg>
<seg id="1636">United Nations</seg>
<seg id="1637">"Zeid Ra-ad al-Hussein, the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, met Chinese officials at the end of June to discuss the case of Liu."</seg>
<seg id="1638">"however, a spokesman refused to comment whether the United Nations should exercise pressure to allow Liu abroad to be treated abroad."</seg>
<seg id="1639">Norway</seg>
<seg id="1640">Norway's Prime Minister Erna Solberg and Foreign Minister Børge Brende refused to answer questions about Lius release.</seg>
<seg id="1641">"the relationship between China and Norway grasped after the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to Liu in 2010, although the Norwegian government told that this was ultimately nothing to do with the decision."</seg>
<seg id="1642">"diplomatic relations continued until December last year. only in June Norway signed an agreement to resume the salmon farms to China, as exports since 2010 were largely blocked."</seg>
<seg id="1643">"after spreading the message that Liu was seriously ill, the Nobel Committee expressed his hope for unconditional release and invited Liu to pick up his prize in Oslo."</seg>
<seg id="1644">"due to his imprisonment, he was unable to accept his prize."</seg>
<seg id="1645">During the ceremony Liu was represented by an empty chair.</seg>
<seg id="1646">European Union</seg>
<seg id="1647">"on July 6, the European Parliament adopted a decision to free Liu and his wife immediately from house arrest and permit him to seek medical support wherever he wants."</seg>
<seg id="1648">"the top diplomat of the EU, Federica Mogherini, also called for China to release Lius, as she reported in an explanation on 30 June:"</seg>
<seg id="1649">"at the same time, we expect China to raise all restrictions of Mr. Lius wife and family members."</seg>
<seg id="1650">"they should meet and receive all visits they desire, and be able to communicate freely with the outside world."</seg>
<seg id="1651">USA</seg>
<seg id="1652">"U.S. ambassador Terry Branstad told him that the Americans would like him to have the possibility of treating abroad, in so far as he could help him with his recovery."</seg>
<seg id="1653">"a spokeswoman in the US embassy in China, Mary Beth Polley, announced that the message agency AFP announced on 27 June that the embassy asked the Chinese authorities to release not only Liu, but also to free his wife Liu Xia from her house arrest."</seg>
<seg id="1654">"the invitation of the US embassy drew a furious response from China to itself, with the utterance of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, that" no country has the right to interfere in a single and irresponsible statement on Chinese internal affairs. "</seg>
<seg id="1655">Polley told us that China should offer the couple the following:</seg>
<seg id="1656">"protection and freedom such as travel freedom and access to the medical care of his choice, which they claim according to the Chinese constitution and legal system, as well as international obligations."</seg>
<seg id="1657">"the U.S. Senators Marco Rubio, Jeff Merkley and Ted Cruz launched a decision in Congress to press the Chinese government on it, Liu and his wife unconditionally release."</seg>
<seg id="1658">"I urge China to release the Nobel Prize Winner # LiuXiaobo unconditionally, so that he can go to proper medical treatment. http: / / bit.ly / 2tE6kUo"</seg>

<seg id="1660">"German government spokesman Steffen Seibert wrote on July 3, Berlin, hope that Liu gets all the medical support he needs and that" "a" "humanitarian solution for Liu Xiaobo should be the highest priority."</seg>
<seg id="1661">The Chinese President Xi Jinping appeared on the G20 Summit in Hamburg on 7 and 8 July.</seg>
<seg id="1662">"previously, diplomatic sources reported in Beijing's news agency Reuters that China had great concerns if the vortex could overshadow the visit to Hamburg."</seg>

<seg id="1667">"Canada demands China to uphold its international human rights obligations, including freedom of expression, and freedom of expression for the exercise of these rights."</seg>
<seg id="1668">France</seg>
<seg id="1669">"in an Declaration on 29 June, France's Department of Foreign Affairs urged China to release Liu for humanitarian reasons:"</seg>
<seg id="1670">"all necessary measures must be taken to ensure that Liu Xiaobo receives all treatments which he, regardless of where, needs. furthermore, his wife and his family should have contact with him."</seg>
<seg id="1671">"although the news channel France Info already reported that the French government would welcome Liu in the country, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced that there is no further information out whether France will eventually record it."</seg>
<seg id="1672">Taiwan</seg>
<seg id="1673">"the Council of the mainland matters in Taiwan demanded China to release Liu on June 27, and show a greater tolerance towards those who use peaceful means to demand political reforms and democratic development."</seg>
<seg id="1674">The Taiwanese legislature Yu Mei-nu by the ruling Democratic Progressive Party also urged China to allow the sick intellectual Liu to be treated in Taiwan.</seg>
<seg id="1675">Dalai Lama</seg>
<seg id="1676">"the spiritual leader in Tibet, the Dalai Lama, was very concerned about Liu in an explanation on June 28, and gave him that many asked him to pray for Lius well-being."</seg>
<seg id="1677">He said about Liu:</seg>
<seg id="1678">"it is my belief that the initiatives he took and had been severely punished for which he had been severely punished, to a more harmonious, more stable and prosperous China, which in turn would have contributed to a more peaceful world."</seg>
<seg id="1679">"I felt personally very moved and also encouraged when I saw hundreds of Chinese intellectuals and affected citizens, inspired by Liu Xiaobo, who signed Charter 08, which stands for democracy, freedom and rule of law in China."</seg>

<seg id="1682">License: CC0 Domaine Public</seg>
<seg id="1683">Is Singapore a city or country?</seg>
<seg id="1684">"the question may seem stupidly, as Singapore is recognized on an international level as an independent state."</seg>
<seg id="1685">"but according to the Minister of Justice K. Shanmugam, Singapore should be considered as a city."</seg>
<seg id="1686">This remark has triggered a debate in the blogosphere.</seg>
<seg id="1687">"during the meeting on the occasion of a meeting of the international branch of the Union of New York, the Minister noted that many people criticised the dominance of the only political party of Singapore because they compared Singapore with other countries."</seg>
<seg id="1688">He supported Singapore as a city.</seg>
<seg id="1689">No one questioned whether New York is a democracy...</seg>
<seg id="1690">This is where most people commit a mistake.</seg>
<seg id="1691">I have tried to explain that we are different.</seg>
<seg id="1692">We are a city.</seg>
<seg id="1693">We are not a country.</seg>
<seg id="1694">"the blog Cavalierio accused the Minister of Justice to" "turn the logic" "to defend the existing authoritarian exercise of power in Singapore."</seg>
<seg id="1695">"and then, after all our efforts and sacrifices to create this valuable land, we hear that we are ultimately not a country."</seg>
<seg id="1696">"it sounded so vulgar, it had the appearance of an escape from the responsibilities, a breach of duty."</seg>
<seg id="1697">"Singapore, if you are not my country, whose land is it then?"</seg>
<seg id="1698">"the reasons cited by Shanmugam were not very nobel: he defended an idea, according to which one could not measure the political system of Singapore with other" normal countries "in the face of that, he inevitably appeared undemocratic."</seg>
<seg id="1699">"on the other hand, he defended the idea that Singapore should be compared to cities such as Chicago, San Francisco or New York, equally cities that are permanently run by a party."</seg>
<seg id="1700">These cities are democratic.</seg>
<seg id="1701">"as soon as one reaches the core of the subject, the good old bodies of the authoritarian rulers appear to be able to be democrats, leaving the distorted logic, as they are better suited to their power."</seg>
<seg id="1702">"in the last week of Shanmugam, the answers to his American guests regarding our press, our judicative, our political system were really non-answers."</seg>
<seg id="1703">He would like to have appropriate questions with non-responses of rational nature.</seg>
<seg id="1704">Rachel Zeng invites Shanmugam to clarify his opinion as they did not understand this conclusion.</seg>
<seg id="1705">I personally find it a bit difficult to swallow.</seg>
<seg id="1706">"when Singapore is not a country, but a city, so to which country belongs to our city..."</seg>
<seg id="1707">"short, I don't understand anything."</seg>
<seg id="1708">"I would be very grateful if our werter K Shanmugam would take the effort to clarify this point, as long as he was paid up to be part of the Government of the city of Singapore."</seg>
<seg id="1709">"commenting on his comment on the blog, he pointed out about the criticism that one should start reading the entire participation of the conference, so that one could better understand the context of the statements made by Shanmugam, according to which Singapore was a city and not a country."</seg>
<seg id="1710">Read the transcription.</seg>
<seg id="1711">"when he said that Singapore was rather a" city "than a country," he explained why the Singapore elections were so unevasive, even if we enjoy free and fair elections. "</seg>
<seg id="1712">He compares Singapore with cities in the USA (and how many of these cities have seen a party for decades?).</seg>
<seg id="1713">"when he said, Singapore" was not a country, "he obviously didn't mean it in this sense!"</seg>
<seg id="1714">"Clement Tan shows his disappointment about Shanmugam, who is a leader of a growing generation, which makes such a polemic statement."</seg>
<seg id="1715">I am very embarrassed about what the Minister of Justice of Singapore has said...</seg>
<seg id="1716">"at least I knew with Lee Kuan Yew and the members of the old guard, what awaits me - I agree with them or not, but that is another thing."</seg>
<seg id="1717">"but with K. Shanmugam, a member of the new generation of the political leaders of Singapore, I doubt and I am not even sure if he really believes it is true and aware of what he defends."</seg>
<seg id="1718">The TEMASEK Review splits the weak points of Shanmugam's arguments:</seg>
<seg id="1719">Did Mr. Shanmugam committed a mistake or was it a Freudscher spokesman?</seg>
<seg id="1720">"if Singapore is not a country, we are only regarded as an independent and sovereign state?"</seg>
<seg id="1721">"if not, in which country do the sovereign rights of the city of Singapore go back?"</seg>
<seg id="1722">"Singapore is unique, it is equally land and city."</seg>
<seg id="1723">"since he plays an important role in the government cabinet, the statements of Mr. Shanmugam are of serious importance."</seg>
<seg id="1724">"why do the people of Singapore afford their military service, do they only defend their city but not their country?"</seg>
<seg id="1725">Who needs to pay back our prime minister invoices?</seg>
<seg id="1726">What is the value of our pink identity card?</seg>
<seg id="1727">Are we the citizens of a country or the inhabitants of a city?</seg>
<seg id="1728">"the magazine Journey of a Decade for Bejahung, Singapore is and has always been a city:"</seg>
<seg id="1729">I did not say what I said...</seg>
<seg id="1730">This sentence seems to have annoyed many people of Singapore...</seg>
<seg id="1731">No one ever said that Singapore is a country.</seg>
<seg id="1732">We were always a city.</seg>
<seg id="1733">We have always been a city / island state.</seg>
<seg id="1734">"I can understand that we often hear statements like" "the defence of the country above all", "etc., but that is not quite correct."</seg>
<seg id="1735">We should rather speak of the defense of the city.</seg>

<seg id="1741">"the latest part of this series comes from Nevin Thompson, editor for Global Voices Japan, who lives in Canada and Japan."</seg>
<seg id="1742">The question I am most asked in Japan is: "are you Americans?"</seg>
<seg id="1743">"no, I'm sorry," I answer. "I'm from Canada." since 1994 I live and back in Japan. "</seg>
<seg id="1744">"depending on what situation the conversation takes place, it is considered courteous to show interest in his conversation partner by asking personal questions."</seg>
<seg id="1745">"my clarification then follows the default answer:" Oh, Rocky Mountains, ice hockey, nature. "many canadians perhaps cook inwardly with anger, when they are kept for Americans, but I don't bother me."</seg>
<seg id="1746">"for someone who doesn't know himself, there is little one distinguishes us Canadian from Americans."</seg>
<seg id="1747">This is one of the reasons why so many Canadians get a Canadian flag well visible at their backpack when they travel.</seg>
<seg id="1748">Everyone loves Canadians.</seg>

<seg id="1787">"the video can be interpreted as a creative and entertaining introduction to Thai politics, especially with the situation of the country under the Junta reign."</seg>
<seg id="1788">Take a look at these recordings of the video that relate to some of the political topics that Thailand has persistently pursued over the past three years.</seg>
<seg id="1789">"the" 44 rules of girls "may refer to the draconian section 44 of the provisional Constitution, which gives absolute decision-making authority over important national issues."</seg>

<seg id="1794">"on 20 May 2014, the law was issued in Thailand."</seg>

<seg id="1796">"one of the problems that the Junta continues to pursue is their decision to buy expensive submarines, although security experts warned them that the purchase is unnecessary and a waste of tax money."</seg>
<seg id="1797">"in the video, it is even shown how people are thrown into a black delivery van before putting them into a dormitory, another problem."</seg>
<seg id="1798">"some journalists are in prison because they allegedly" "confusion" "caused in society and Internet users are threatened with long term penalties, they should offend the monarchy."</seg>

<seg id="1894">"in Mexico" "Mama Africa" "is home to migrants on their long journey"</seg>
<seg id="1895">"Concepción González Ramírez leads a small hotel in Tapachula, in the state of Chiapas, at the border of Mexico to Guatemala."</seg>

<seg id="1897">This article by Amy Bracken was published on the website of our partner PRI.org on 19 April 2017 and is published here with friendly permission.</seg>
<seg id="1898">"on the way of migrants entering Europe or Latin America, certain places are known for their hospitality."</seg>
<seg id="1899">"I have visited one of these places in the Mexican town of Tapachula, it is located on the border to Guatemala."</seg>
<seg id="1900">It is a very simple hotel close to the city center.</seg>
<seg id="1901">"it is led by a 59- year-old Mexicanerin, a small woman with a coral-pink Brillengestell and goldtone earrings in teddy bears."</seg>
<seg id="1902">She is called Concepción González Ramírez and was born in Tapachula and grew up there. nevertheless they know many of the name Mama Africa.</seg>
<seg id="1903">This nickname is the fact that the hotel (or rather it) has become a destination for Africans and Haitians who are on transit.</seg>
<seg id="1904">The hotel has no charm.</seg>
<seg id="1905">"for about 2.50 dollars the night sleep the guests in simple rooms, with bare, crumbling walls and beds made of metal."</seg>
<seg id="1906">In the anteroom there is a parrot in a cage.</seg>
<seg id="1907">There is no sign to the hotel - anyway hundreds of African and Haitian migrants come here.</seg>
<seg id="1908">"sometimes, Ms Ramírez, people in full minibuses and from the upper part of the coast begin to cry out:" Mama Africa! "</seg>
<seg id="1909">Where did you find Mama Africa?. "</seg>
<seg id="1910">"at the moment, it is rather quiet, but this year Ramírez has received 200 guests at the same time."</seg>
<seg id="1911">There are only 24 rooms; some have also slept on cardboard.</seg>
<seg id="1912">You don't want to reject anyone.</seg>
<seg id="1913">"she also helps them and brings her to the hospital when she is sick, she buys them drugs that they can't pay, she massages them with a balm that exhausted from the long journey."</seg>
<seg id="1914">"Tychique Sebastiao, originally from Angola, has arrived recently."</seg>
<seg id="1915">I asked him if Mama Africa was a reasonable nickname for Mrs. Ramírez.</seg>
<seg id="1916">The Sebastiao family (with her daughter Merrui who has a yoghurst) posing with Concepción González Ramírez.</seg>
<seg id="1917">The family came from Angola to Brazil and hopes to go to Boston.</seg>

<seg id="1919">"yes, yes," he replies with a smile. "I really feel that it suits her because African women are very nice women."</seg>
<seg id="1920">Very affectionate.</seg>
<seg id="1921">She has the warmth of a mother...</seg>
<seg id="1922">We feel very comfortable here. "</seg>
<seg id="1923">"Sebastiao travels with his sister, who hopes to go to Boston to find her husband and the three children."</seg>
<seg id="1924">"they have already lived in Brazil, but it is for some Africans who are on the way to the United States to make normal a first stop in South America and then move towards north."</seg>
<seg id="1925">"the family had heard of other companions from Mama Africa." "Mama Africa is a well-known name on the track," "explains Felix Michelet, a guest from Haiti."</seg>
<seg id="1926">He tells us that the Haitians and the Africans are often travelling together and that Africans already speak to Whatsapp by Mrs. Ramírez.</seg>
<seg id="1927">"like many of his companions, Michelet had previously lived in Brazil and worked as a construction worker on building sites of the Olympic Games and the World Cup."</seg>
<seg id="1928">"when the Brazilian economy was weaker, he began his trip to the United States."</seg>
<seg id="1929">He has been guest at Mama Africa for months: he sells SIM cards to save the money needed to buy the bus ticket to Tijuana.</seg>
<seg id="1930">I wonder if he will contact Mrs. Ramírez in the future.</seg>
<seg id="1931">"Mama Africa is our mother and we never let it go again," he responds smiling. "we will always stay in touch."</seg>
<seg id="1932">"Mrs. Ramírez tells her guests to send her often text messages when they went to greet her, or to report her about the course of her journey."</seg>
<seg id="1933">She explains that her Christian faith is the drive of her work.</seg>
<seg id="1934">"she doesn't know much about Africa, but her guests have taught her to prepare chicken as in Ghana."</seg>
<seg id="1935">"Ms. Ramírez is perhaps very well known here, but she is not the only spark of hope for migrants travelling through Tapachula."</seg>
<seg id="1936">At the other end of the city a dead end leads to Jesús Valenzuela.</seg>
<seg id="1937">"in this winter, Valenzuela and his family have resumed migrants in their small house."</seg>
<seg id="1938">He is a policeman and has found that the bus tickets to numerous African immigrants are sold too expensive.</seg>
<seg id="1939">"he has begun to help them get a reasonable price, then he offered them his house for a dollar the night."</seg>
<seg id="1940">"at the moment, 25 people are there, mainly Haitians."</seg>
<seg id="1941">"some sleep on the floor, but at least they have electricity, a washing machine and a cooking place outside."</seg>
<seg id="1942">Valenzuela explains that he knows what the guests go through.</seg>
<seg id="1943">"I lived in the United States," he says. "I have seen what they experience."</seg>
<seg id="1944">I crossed the border crossing the desert and we suffered.</seg>
<seg id="1945">There are places where people can help and others not help. that's the reason why I give them my support.</seg>
<seg id="1946">"after he lived for three years, he was expelled from the United States after a raid on his work place."</seg>
<seg id="1947">"the majority of migrants travelling through Tapachula comes from Central America, other inhabitants also open doors of their homes for them."</seg>
<seg id="1948">José Antonio Cordova Meléndez tells me he fled to Honduras with his wife and his three children who wanted to blackmail him money without having a plan.</seg>
<seg id="1949">"in Tapachula, he asked for an accommodation and an unknown, a stone-drawing, offered him their roof."</seg>
<seg id="1950">"a few months later, the family still lives there and she tries to decide where the next steps should go."</seg>
<seg id="1951">Back in the house of Mama Africa is all back full of guests.</seg>
<seg id="1952">"in the courses, the travelers are quietly consulted their telephones."</seg>
<seg id="1953">"a minibus arrived today and has brought 20 new guests, a majority of Somalia."</seg>
<seg id="1954">"Mrs. Ramírez seems happy that her house is full, but she is also nostalgic, because of those who went away."</seg>
<seg id="1955">"like a proud grandmother, she presents her album with numerous photos."</seg>
<seg id="1956">"there is one of her daughter with African hair fleets, who made her a female, some photos of her grandchildren and many travelers more, boy and old."</seg>
<seg id="1957">She laughs sad while she briefly presented her.</seg>
<seg id="1958">"Ya se fueron," she repeats every time. "they have gone."</seg>
<seg id="1959">China: Xinjiang residents are forced to install a surveillance app on their mobile phones.</seg>
<seg id="1960">A check-point for personal communication devices in Xinjiang from Twitter users in the usurer</seg>
<seg id="1961">"the inhabitants of Xinjiang, an ethnic minorities region in the West of China, are forced to install a spyware on their mobile phones."</seg>
<seg id="1962">"on July 10, the mobile phone users in the Tianshan district of the town Urumqi received a mobile phone notification in which it instructs the district government to install a surveillance app called Jingwang (or" Web Cleaning ")."</seg>
<seg id="1963">"in the communication, it is said that the app" "prevent access to terrorist information". ""</seg>
<seg id="1964">"however, the authorities would also want to use the app for more than the fight against terrorism."</seg>
<seg id="1965">"according to an exclusive report by Radio Free Asia, 10 Kazakh women were arrested in the autonomous Ili Kazakh prefecture, because they had installed the app shortly after they had installed the app, exchanged messages with a private WeChat group."</seg>
<seg id="1966">"in the announcement of the police, the app was able to identify and track the sources and distribution channels of the terrorists, along with" illegal religious "activities and" harmful information "including videos, pictures, eBooks and documents."</seg>
<seg id="1967">Jingwangs website describes the app as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1968">Jingwang is a protection service with system categories for children and adults introduced by Jiangsu Telecom.</seg>
<seg id="1969">"the main function is blocking pornographic websites, from online scams, trojans and phishing pages to make users aware how much time they spend online, and to remotely control their own home network."</seg>
<seg id="1970">This app with the filters for minors is intended to help children develop a healthy lifestyle.</seg>
<seg id="1971">An app with these functions can of course be used in a variety of ways.</seg>
<seg id="1972">"for example, the" remote control "could enable state actors or even hackers to manipulate or steal the home network of a person."</seg>
<seg id="1973">This introduction is consistent with other measures to control digital activities in this region.</seg>
<seg id="1974">"while messages about digital censorship in China mostly focus on the experiences of users in the larger cities in the east and south, reality is very often gloomy for those living in remote, crowded ethnic minority regions such as Xinjiang and Tibet."</seg>
<seg id="1975">"to limit unrest and discontent in conflict areas, the authorities often arrange extreme cases and surveillance measures as well as routine internet deposition."</seg>
<seg id="1976">"the media outlet on Twitter based media outlet" Images from In China, "the censored news in China published, showed photos of a checkpoint, where policemen checked the villagers whether they installed the surveillance app."</seg>
<seg id="1977">The authorities in Xinjian make sure people use the official Jingwang App.</seg>
<seg id="1978">A mobile alert required that people install the app within 10 days.</seg>
<seg id="1979">"if you are discovered on a checkpoint with a device without this software, they could be imprisoned up to 10 days."</seg>
<seg id="1980">This is a setback for technological development.</seg>
<seg id="1981">They have forced the people to use devices that are intended for older people.</seg>
<seg id="1982">This is a form of imprisonment by the recovery technology.</seg>
<seg id="1983">We are back in Maos China.</seg>
<seg id="1984">"images from" "China" "(SHIP) also released a Jingwang product description, resulting from the fact that the software can lift the license requirements of a Windows operating system and therefore receives unrestricted access to the hard drive of the computer."</seg>
<seg id="1985">"after installing Jingwang, computers and mobile phones in Xinjiang become electronic handcuffs."</seg>
<seg id="1986">The provisions in Jingwang may be a response to the instructions of the City Party Council to minimize the dissemination of illegal content.</seg>
<seg id="1987">"all government branches, authorities and associated institutions including universities and research institutions are obliged to follow the instructions of Cybersecurity Office when operating their computers and communications devices."</seg>
<seg id="1988">"an up-to-date report from Freedom House, an American Human Rights Organisation, also mentioned these new monitoring methods:"</seg>
<seg id="1989">"in Xinjiang, the authorities published a directive on 27 June in a district of the regional capital of Urumqi by order to register their" personal ID cards, mobile phones, external drives, portable hard drives, notebooks and media memory cards "at the local police."</seg>
<seg id="1990">"the intention is obviously any" terrorist videos "to identify and destroy. however, this action violates the personality rights of Urumquis three million inhabitants and gives them punishment for a whole host of other possible offences, including those relating to peaceful religious or political messages."</seg>

<seg id="1994">"this is the first of six reports in the series of" "sleep or death" "in which the activist Sarmad Al Jilane describes his experiences in a Syrian prison."</seg>
<seg id="1995">"far from our blue, virtual world you look at and imagine that you are all alone in a place where everything is important."</seg>
<seg id="1996">"everything has gradually dissolved and revealed a truth, which is clearly recognizable from both inside and outside."</seg>
<seg id="1997">One that makes their name all honour.</seg>
<seg id="1998">One that has knocked down into a list of feelings and expressions that do not allow metaphors.</seg>
<seg id="1999">"but when the reality brings you back and you look behind the scenes - beyond the acting, the beautiful scenes and the performer - the characters transform themselves into being of flesh and blood, and all cries after death."</seg>
<seg id="2000">"all doubt dissolve in smoke and you will be aware of your existence, even if the Earth is on the axis of evil. you realize that you are caught between the walls that have built your parents, and before them your grandparents, stone around stone."</seg>
<seg id="2001">"they have arrested me and my father three times, but that wasn't enough for me to learn" my lesson, "as the chief of the security servant formulated it - with the promise that the fourth time would be a pleasure."</seg>
<seg id="2002">He demonstrated his power over us by even destroying the simplest concepts we knew.</seg>
<seg id="2003">Five young people were torn apart during a peaceful protest like weeds from the beautiful garden of our revolution.</seg>
<seg id="2004">"it was enough for the city to crush the darkness of the night with" "Allahu Akbar" "screams."</seg>
<seg id="2005">"all the neighborhoods coveted, just my own not."</seg>
<seg id="2006">"for the first time it was quiet, rainy, at the wrong time, even though I did not put high demands on a city that is stuffed up to the arteries with state security organisms and their accomplices."</seg>
<seg id="2007">"in the third night things had calmed down, after the power supply stopped functioning in the neighborhood."</seg>
<seg id="2008">"I broke the silence by screaming several times" "Allahu Akbar" "from my home roof."</seg>
<seg id="2009">I heard my voice evoked by silence.</seg>
<seg id="2010">A few minutes later some of my friends felt courageous enough to find together.</seg>
<seg id="2011">I was not alone.</seg>
<seg id="2012">"many friends, true friends joined me; we joined us to a magnificent picture that filled my expectations completely and entirely."</seg>
<seg id="2013">"in such a moment, you are aware that you freed the spirit from the lamp, but it is simply not interested in the least."</seg>
<seg id="2014">"I received a call from my father:" "make you ready, we meet us at the Military Security Building."</seg>
<seg id="2015">He put on.</seg>
<seg id="2016">Then I learned the following: no matter how much honey you can swallow - nothing can give you back your voice after you have put it all the way up to the office of security service out of the body.</seg>
<seg id="2017">I arrived there.</seg>
<seg id="2018">The Colonel Ghassan stood there with several of his men; my father was already there as I was now.</seg>
<seg id="2019">"the Colonel Ghassan starts to speak:" "let me hear how you scream" "Allahu Akbar" "or you are only brave enough to scream if we are not close."</seg>
<seg id="2020">His water-filled eyes set themselves on me.</seg>
<seg id="2021">And you dare to look into my eyes and not on the ground!</seg>
<seg id="2022">What I did then has nothing to do with courage.</seg>
<seg id="2023">"I was 18 years old, it was the fourth time that I stood before this building."</seg>
<seg id="2024">"perhaps it was on my folly, vanity; perhaps in the revolution."</seg>
<seg id="2025">I was so sure of my thing when I replied: "I wouldn't have thought that you have forgotten my voice since yesterday.</seg>
<seg id="2026">"and I think I have never stopped to look into the eyes, so why should I do it now?"</seg>
<seg id="2027">"it was the shortest entertainment that could have such fatal consequences for me, and yet I do not regret the word of what I said."</seg>
<seg id="2028">"put him in solitary confinement, and his father alike."</seg>
<seg id="2029">"his father, same with that."</seg>
<seg id="2030">The contention of this accursed sentence is up to this day in the nose.</seg>
<seg id="2031">"he became a" "syndrome", "a mental torture which I was exposed to months."</seg>
<seg id="2032">I went through the yard.</seg>
<seg id="2033">In the first office I leave everything I wear with myself.</seg>
<seg id="2034">"then again through the yard and into the second office, which leads through a course to the individual cells."</seg>
<seg id="2035">I approve all the details before I supervised the room.</seg>
<seg id="2036">Otherwise they have allocated a larger cell to me this time.</seg>
<seg id="2037">"I have to share them with only one another prisoner, and must immediately put me at ease without waiting for their permission."</seg>
<seg id="2038">"after a few minutes that felt like a whole life, the officials left the cell, and I handle an old-tried method of communication: to beat the fist against the wall."</seg>
<seg id="2039">"I learned that my Cellenic Comrade was a" "first prisoner." ""</seg>
<seg id="2040">"after a long hesitation, he answered me finally."</seg>
<seg id="2041">"apparently in none of the surrounding cells there was a respected man middle aged man, who looks similar to me and called" the doctor. ""</seg>
<seg id="2042">"in perfect darkness, no prominent factions can be seen in me, and doctors do not exist here; we are all only numbers."</seg>
<seg id="2043">Maybe someone whose voice sounds like mine?</seg>
<seg id="2044">All the answers are linked to his existence.</seg>
<seg id="2045">Perhaps he was moved to one of the big cells.</seg>
<seg id="2046">Maybe he will stop immediately.</seg>
<seg id="2047">"the investigator had insured me, they would release him if I remain."</seg>
<seg id="2048">Liars.</seg>
<seg id="2049">I'd like to have had a scarecrow to drive out all these crows that were lying on the fruits in my head's garden.</seg>
<seg id="2050">"from afar I still hear them screaming" "Allahu Akbar". ""</seg>
<seg id="2051">"it must be about 10 o'clock in the evening; always at this time the screams, every day."</seg>
<seg id="2052">The door opens.</seg>
<seg id="2053">"I was always convinced that black was the color of perdition, until I saw the yellow light that presented us the horror in person: the Raad (about:" Donner, "allusion to 13 Sure des Koran)."</seg>
<seg id="2054">They are here to be heard.</seg>
<seg id="2055">"this was the secret of the secret: to protect state security in front of us and prevent the betrayer and the terrorists in us, they speak in the Albanian dialect - so they played their denominational blackmail and betrayed the narrow view of their world view."</seg>
<seg id="2056">"this is not a house here, which is not a country; it is a curse that they call coexistence to transform the criminals of their clan into a hero."</seg>
<seg id="2057">"I cared for the interrogation room and meet Abu Imad, a slender and stocky man; at least he seems to me."</seg>
<seg id="2058">"he starts a" pleasant "conversation, in spite of the expressions that glide to him:" my boy, you are still young, you can start so much more important with your life than to protest this day and protest on demonstrations, which will soon be an end anyway. "</seg>
<seg id="2059">I didn't answer.</seg>
<seg id="2060">I have accustomed to answering them.</seg>
<seg id="2061">I can really no longer tell exactly when insults and blows have become a common means of communication for me.</seg>
<seg id="2062">When and how it happened was unimportant.</seg>
<seg id="2063">"one voice in me said that I had to get used to it, punished, punished, even though I had done nothing to earn this punishment."</seg>
<seg id="2064">Punishment in all its diversity.</seg>
<seg id="2065">His command is to tear me as much meat as possible from the body.</seg>
<seg id="2066">He calls the lovingly "confession."</seg>
<seg id="2067">It starts with a plastic pipe which probably originates from the cloakings.</seg>
<seg id="2068">Your hangman came to your cry.</seg>
<seg id="2069">Give him the pleasure; you cannot measure yourself with him and you cannot keep your screams back.</seg>
<seg id="2070">"my screams were not enough for him, so why they exchanged the pipe through a cable."</seg>
<seg id="2071">"during my first arrest, I asked if the investigator had previously worked as a garbage collector or whether it belonged to the normal working equipment."</seg>
<seg id="2072">"they had four cables intertwined in order to present us, from their point of view, great invention of a huge cable."</seg>
<seg id="2073">"within one hour three of them changed, while I was still in the row."</seg>
<seg id="2074">"I had lost all feeling in my body - and also my voice, which is why I stopped crying."</seg>
<seg id="2075">The executioner remarked the cooling and didn't find any favor on it so that he accessed an electrically loaded rod as a neighbour.</seg>
<seg id="2076">"electricity flowed my whole body, enough to supply my whole quarter."</seg>
<seg id="2077">"my semi-naked body, lying on the ground, was the perfect conductor."</seg>
<seg id="2078">The numbness disappeared and the pain was back.</seg>
<seg id="2079">After two terrible hours he decided that he had fulfilled his duty for that night.</seg>
<seg id="2080">It must have been around midnight.</seg>
<seg id="2081">I decided to fall asleep again; let's say that was my only option.</seg>
<seg id="2082">A few hours passed away that occurred to me as minutes.</seg>
<seg id="2083">Then the call to the morning prayer.</seg>
<seg id="2084">"the door opens and the morning light fulfills the room." "Raus with you, assionist."</seg>
<seg id="2085">"I answer with the voice of an exhausted young man:" "my Lord, my father must be fearful." ""</seg>

<seg id="2101">Recorded by the author.</seg>
<seg id="2102">"Hdaib does not believe that his compassion for those who try to survive in war zones, have something to do with his identity as" Palestinian "refugees in the second generation, even though he was born in Jordan and has never been in Palestine."</seg>
<seg id="2103">"I don't think about my own circumstances," says Hdaib. "</seg>
<seg id="2104">"then he adds:" "I think so because I am a man," while he dissolved in water Nescafé in two cups. it is the holy month Ramadan; at that time it is intended for Muslims to fast from sunrise to sunset. "</seg>
<seg id="2105">The Jordanian law also states that public consumption of food during Ramadan is illegal.</seg>
<seg id="2106">"obviously, Hdaib has a certain weakness to break with ancient traditions; on the other hand, a cup of coffee in a sensing hot young day has little to do with protest against Islam."</seg>
<seg id="2107">"basically, the warms are lukewarm coffee and the goads of the Kent cigarette in the nose primarily speak of freedom."</seg>
<seg id="2108">"sometimes Jordan feels like a prison under the open sky, especially if one throws a look into neighbouring countries."</seg>
<seg id="2109">"therefore, it is easy to do basic things - as in the public during Ramadan water to drink - not to land in prison."</seg>
<seg id="2110">"recently, the Interior Ministry of Jordan did a gig in the band Mashrou 'Leila, already for the second time."</seg>
<seg id="2111">"some parliamentarians who support the Islamic Action Front - the Jordanian branch of the Muslim Brotherhood - argued that the sexual orientation of the homosexual tribute, Hamed Sinno, contradicts the cultural and traditional norms of the country and the main reason for the concert evening."</seg>
<seg id="2112">"the deputy and former spokesperson of the Islamic coalition, Dima Tahboub, said in an interview with CNN that the concert was cancelled" just "because of the sexual orientation of the singer."</seg>
<seg id="2113">"many also argue that the engagement of the band in matters such as the Arab Spring, human rights and freedom of expression in the Arab world is dangerous activism, which questioned the well-established legitimacy of authoritarian regimes in the entire region."</seg>
<seg id="2114">"in a public statement, Mashrou 'Leila appreciated the Jordanian people as" progressive supporters of human rights, "which still opposes" for intellectual and cultural pluralism. ""</seg>
<seg id="2115">"this statement may not be simply silly rhetoric, but in fact an increasingly clear-crystallising reality reflected in Jordan, which appears clearly in Hdaib's work."</seg>
<seg id="2116">"in 2016, Hdaib recovered traditional lineage to be a body by abusing his vision of the fate of Arab women who have had sex."</seg>
<seg id="2117">"the picture shows the skeleton of an apparently truncated unknown woman, whose arms and legs stretch up to the corners of the canvas."</seg>
<seg id="2118">"it is surrounded by a red lake, perhaps the blood of the innumerable women who lost their lives through the hands of those whom they should actually trust."</seg>
<seg id="2119">"over the past few years, the number of" "Honorary Morning" "has taken place in Jordan - the unofficial outside."</seg>
<seg id="2120">"according to Human Rights Watch, the number of honorary killings reached its peak in 2016; however, it is still more difficult to support Jordan's institutional infrastructure to support women victims tried murder or domestic violence."</seg>
<seg id="2121">"according to a law to fight against crime from the year 1954, women, who are exposed to the risk of family violence, are often a long-term bureaucratic effort, as well as the guarantee provided by the family, that the woman is not going to happen."</seg>
<seg id="2122">Hdaibs music also enjoys great popularity and is known to not shy away from themes that are long taboo in his country.</seg>
<seg id="2123">"Hdaib denies that his work is political, but admits that he puts his music, which is full of explicit allusions on sexuality, freedom and expression, cannot separate from politics."</seg>
<seg id="2124">"I come from the Middle East, man."</seg>
<seg id="2125">"politics was saying," "he says."</seg>
<seg id="2126">In a song called "Edward Sa'ed" Hdaib takes the question of the Palestinian identity.</seg>
<seg id="2127">In "Lawla al 3aib" and in "ghareeb" the focus is on poverty.</seg>
<seg id="2128">The list of the songs that are political in the core can be continued.</seg>
<seg id="2129">In March 2016 Hdaib published a song entitled "Santandano."</seg>
<seg id="2130">In this song a verse repeats itself often:</seg>
<seg id="2131">"you are free, and everyone else is it."</seg>
<seg id="2132">"in the course of the song Hdaib describes the world as a kind of market where you can, in his words," that can get what you want "- be faith or non-belief, hetero- or homosexuality."</seg>
<seg id="2133">He noted that hardly anyone in Jordan talks about the rights of gay and lesbians and that comments on equality of LGBTQ + individuals were still censored in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2134">"in 2014, Hdaib conducted an interview for the popular Jordanian online program Roya, to mark later that his comments were torn out of the context, distorted and had been censored."</seg>
<seg id="2135">"on Youtube it was uploaded without cuts, but was only a modified version," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="2136">Hdaib acquires Hdaib openly for the Arab LGBTQ + community and believes that intolerance towards homosexuals does not speak to Islam.</seg>
<seg id="2137">"he mentions Abu Nuwhat, a poet of the eighth century, who still remains in memory thanks to its homoerotic poems."</seg>
<seg id="2138">"Hdaib asks: if Abu Nudes, who later should work on behalf of Caliph, could write openly about homosexuality in the eighth century, why can Jordanier not?"</seg>
<seg id="2139">"the real problem, so Hdaib, have nothing to do with Mashrou 'Leila or the fact that the concert was canceled."</seg>
<seg id="2140">"in the hashemitic kingdom, it is nothing new that the government sanctioned attacks on freedom of expression and that progressive voices will be silenced."</seg>
<seg id="2141">"recently, in January 2017, the Jordanian news service held several former members of government and members of the teacher's association, with the reason that they had a critical impact on commentaries in social media, which are related to the problems rooted in the country."</seg>
<seg id="2142">"in view of this, Hdaibs's concert is only the tip of the iceberg - the real challenge is to create a structural change in the next generation of the Jordanier."</seg>
<seg id="2143">"in Jordan, Mashrou 'Leila has denied entry for the second time in a row, but the way of progress - this is Hdaib - consists of slow, thoughtful and internal changes. it is certain that these changes will take place from day to day in the heart of Jordanian society."</seg>
<seg id="2144">"finally Hdaib dreams, like millions of other Arabs, from an Arab world without intervention from abroad."</seg>
<seg id="2145">"he does not only dream of bringing his work to Baghdad, Jerusalem and Damascus, but also of it" to experience it. ""</seg>
<seg id="2146">"perhaps the region will be crowned by music, art and literature of a genuine and fundamental openness - and not by bombs, cluster munitions and artificial nature. at least he hopes that."</seg>
<seg id="2147">"until it is ready, Hdaib will continue and therefore also resist."</seg>

<seg id="2150">These big extravagant warribs are so fantastic!!!</seg>
<seg id="2151">There are numerous theories regarding the origin of the Nebuta festival.</seg>
<seg id="2152">"one suspects that it is a variant of the Tanabata Festival, which is usually also celebrated in August in many areas of Tohokus. another theory states that the fortresses, the drums and dancing were marched over more than a thousand years in order to force the indigenous inhabitants of the region, the Emishi, to the knees."</seg>

<seg id="2158">"nevertheless, for many people who take the trip to Aomori, the Nebuta festival is the only true - and still a breathtaking way to spend his summer:"</seg>

<seg id="2170">"at the same time, Peru - like many other Central and South American countries - is experiencing increasing demand for aesthetic services for men."</seg>
<seg id="2171">"the trend, appearance and thus also the unusual hairstyles of famous athletes such as Paolo Guerrero (Peru), Arturo Vidal (Peru), or Neymar (Brazil), has led to becoming more and more normal in the experienced hands of hairdressers who can recreate these elaborate hairstyles."</seg>
<seg id="2172">"the unprecedented demand for hairstyles that go to the extreme limits of fantasy and creativity has even inspired an annual event, the competition of Friseure" Batalla de Barberos, "which has been taking place since 2014."</seg>
<seg id="2173">"there are experts in front of each other to show who among them can create the most eccentric lenses, as you can see in the following video (more videos about current competitions are available on the Facebook profile Batalla de Barberos)."</seg>

<seg id="2178">Colombia: letter of love to guerrilla fighters</seg>
<seg id="2179">Photo: Valentina Monsalve.</seg>
<seg id="2180">Use with friendly permission.</seg>
<seg id="2181">"the following article is the edited version of the contribution" "Love messages to guerrilla fighters", "which published the international online magazine Tea After Twelve."</seg>
<seg id="2182">The article will be published here as part of a partnership with Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="2183">Why do we only write love letters to people we know?</seg>
<seg id="2184">"is it not yet much more important, people who feel ejected to accommodate affection?"</seg>
<seg id="2185">This is precisely this question the two young Colombian activists Leonardo Párraga from the Young Youth Foundation and inspired them to the Cartas por la Reconciliación (letter to reconciliation) to encourage young people to write guerrilla fighters.</seg>
<seg id="2186">Only recently their country was the scene of a historic event and they wanted to contribute their part: after years of negotiation the Colombian government had concluded a peace treaty with the guerrilla deflection FARC (German: revolutionary Forces of Colombia) which forms the summit of the longest armed conflict in Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="2187">"internationally, the signatory of the Peace Treaty was so significant that the Colombian President José Manuel Santos was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his merits."</seg>
<seg id="2188">"before the Colombian, however, there is still a long way to speak of a real reconciliation and peace."</seg>
<seg id="2189">"guerrilla fighters who have lived in illegal camps for many years, having been exposed to war rhetoric and carrying their weapons around the clock must now be integrated into the lives of civilians."</seg>
<seg id="2190">"the Colombian society in turn, which had become accustomed to life in constant fear and in some cases of deep hatred against guerrilla fighters, must now take them into their ranks and support them in building a new life."</seg>
<seg id="2191">Leonardo and Cristian were convinced that young Colombians would close together and help with the integration process.</seg>
<seg id="2192">And that's exactly what they did: until now thousands of young people have already written letters - love messages to former guerrilla fighters to welcome them back in society.</seg>
<seg id="2193">The aim of the campaign is 6900 letters - one for every former guerrilla fighter - which should then be handed over personally.</seg>
<seg id="2194">Valentine's Day as an inspiration for the campaign</seg>
<seg id="2195">"the idea for the letters to reconciliation was created on the world summit of Nobel Peace Laureates, which took place in Bogotá in February 2017. there, Leonardo and Cristian had the opportunity to talk to Kailash Satyarthi, awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014."</seg>
<seg id="2196">"this explained that we love the people we love to write thousands of love letters on Valentine's Day, but those who need them much more unnecessary."</seg>
<seg id="2197">"he plans to share his love with people this year, who needed the most urgent response."</seg>
<seg id="2198">"so the plan was to write letters full of hope and support for former warriors of the FARC, who now have their place in society and to build a new life." the letters will show that the Colombian society is ready to make the discourse of a history of war on a common history of peace. ""</seg>
<seg id="2199">So far more than 2000 letters were collected during the campaign.</seg>
<seg id="2200">"the initiative is represented in all major cities of Colombia like Cali, Manizales, Medellín, Barranquilla and Bogotá."</seg>
<seg id="2201">I never thought someone would forgive me</seg>
<seg id="2202">The first 500 letters were handed over to one of the UN camps in the Caldono-Cauca region on 19 March.</seg>
<seg id="2203">"a group of 40 students from the University of Javeriana in Cali, two members of the Municipality of Cali and Leonardo from the BogotArt Foundation travelled to the camp to personally transfer the letters personally."</seg>
<seg id="2204">The members of the FARC set themselves up as they had done earlier in order to accept the orders of their leaders.</seg>
<seg id="2205">"but this time they received no orders, but letters full of support from people from all over the country."</seg>
<seg id="2206">"it was a very moving moment for everyone involved." it's incredible how many different feelings one can go through in just a few hours - from fear to happiness and all that is in between, "said the political scientist Manuela Jiménez Avila later."</seg>
<seg id="2207">"Sandra Parra, an employee of the province of Valle del Cauca described this unforgettable experience as follows:"</seg>
<seg id="2208">"after we had passed the letters, a former warrior led me through the camp of the guerrilla fighters."</seg>
<seg id="2209">"when I saw in one of the" Cambuches "(a kind of hut in which the guerrilla fighters are living), I saw a guerrilla fighter who wrote something."</seg>
<seg id="2210">"I was afraid to go down, for next to him on the bed lay a MGL granulate, a deadly weapon in the Sleeping Beauty."</seg>
<seg id="2211">"and I said," "Hi, what do they do?" "he said," "I answer a letter which someone has written to me."</seg>
<seg id="2212">It is a very nice and hopeful letter.</seg>
<seg id="2213">"never in my life someone has written something so beautiful, so I answer it. suddenly the tears ran over the cheeks."</seg>
<seg id="2214">I embraced him completely and sat down beside the pomegranates.</seg>
<seg id="2215">"perhaps he was sorry for the war, sorry, all the years of faithful companions to be this fighter, and wanted to help him write this letter."</seg>
<seg id="2216">"the man told me more about his life. he never expected anything else from life as a war. to join the FARC, it was the only way to keep him and his six brothers in front of the hunger death." I never thought someone would forgive me for my mistakes. "</seg>
<seg id="2217">"but now I know that there is a society there, waiting for us with open arms."</seg>
<seg id="2218">"until now, I only learned how to deal with weapons."</seg>
<seg id="2219">"but now where peace reigns, I can learn many things and work in dignity."</seg>
<seg id="2220">New voices</seg>
<seg id="2221">"at the start, students and some leaders of the FARC were invited to a discussion round."</seg>
<seg id="2222">The students were all grown up as already war and the FARC already acted in secret.</seg>
<seg id="2223">"this is why the leaders of the FARC declared the history of the organization, their ideals and gave insight into their views on the peace process:" "for many years we have experienced how social injustice on the part of the State worked for the whole Colombian people."</seg>
<seg id="2224">"for a target of this magnitude, it is worthwhile to overcome all obstacles," one of them said. "</seg>
<seg id="2225">Manuela was impressed:</seg>
<seg id="2226">"to hear these people who have never been hearing and had no elective right, and to realize that the people that I have often seen as monsters and even hate them, were also only people with beautiful feelings, which were turned upside by their circumstances and their environment, was very painful for me."</seg>
<seg id="2227">"the reality in which the country lives, hurts me."</seg>
<seg id="2228">"but it comforted me that all men - even those who have killed and so much hurt, can teach us something and give us a smile and a hug."</seg>
<seg id="2229">Many former fighters have responded to the letters.</seg>
<seg id="2230">"Gustavo González, the commander of the camp in Caldono-Cauca, wrote the example Darío de Jesús Monsalve, the Archbishop of the city of Cali, the following letter:"</seg>
<seg id="2231">The Colombian was prophesied that after disarming peace would rule.</seg>
<seg id="2232">But this is not the case.</seg>
<seg id="2233">"as long as inequality, hunger and a lack of education, health care and employment opportunities, there will always be people willing to attack the weapons and protest for their rights. and that is also completely justified (...)."</seg>
<seg id="2234">"we of the FARC are now putting on peace, on a policy without weapons."</seg>
<seg id="2235">"that is why we call on all defenders of peace - regardless of the race, religion or ideology - to rise above all those who dream of a country in war."</seg>
<seg id="2236">"we give you our word, make our contribution and bring sacrifice, as we know from our own experience that nothing is simple. those among us who defend life as the basis of existence will face many difficulties."</seg>
<seg id="2237">"on our way there will be many obstacles, but together we will overcome them."</seg>

<seg id="2244">"with horror, activists have witnessed the reporting of recent months on the persecution of gay men in Chechnya."</seg>
<seg id="2245">But the threat that hangs like a Damocles on the dorsal LGBTQ community did not come about overnight.</seg>
<seg id="2246">"OC Media had the opportunity to talk to a transsexual woman from Grosny, who shared some of her experiences with us and talked to us what is currently happening in the Republic."</seg>
<seg id="2247">"the LGBTQ legal situation in Chechnya has conquered the international headlines several months ago after reports have been published, which addressed the deportation, torture and killing of queer men in the Republic."</seg>
<seg id="2248">The first report was published by journalist Elena Milaschina in the Nowaya Gazeta; she threw a light on the methods of the Chechen authorities who arrested more suspicious queer men and put them in secret prisons in argun.</seg>
<seg id="2249">"they have brought a monster to the world"</seg>
<seg id="2250">"Sabrina, a transwife, was born in Grosny and grew up there."</seg>
<seg id="2251">Since her childhood she felt that she was a woman in reality.</seg>
<seg id="2252">"when she grew up, she became aware that Chechnya was not a safe place for her, why she moved to Moscow."</seg>
<seg id="2253">"after a group of Tschetschenen had experienced by the gender equality of their landlady, the hunt was opened on Sabrina."</seg>
<seg id="2254">She moved to the USA from fear for her life.</seg>
<seg id="2255">Sabrina: I was working as an honorary helper in a human rights organization.</seg>
<seg id="2256">One day I told me that someone needed my help.</seg>
<seg id="2257">"it was a friend of Dagestan, a transducer who put into trouble."</seg>
<seg id="2258">"she had no money, so I took her without hesitation."</seg>
<seg id="2259">"while I tried to help her, someone from whom I thought he would be a friend, a copy of my documents and spread her everywhere on the internet, with my phone number and a picture of me."</seg>
<seg id="2260">"after that, the photos of my documents went through the WhatsApp."</seg>
<seg id="2261">On 10 October 2015 I was attacked.</seg>
<seg id="2262">"when I was doing a few shopping bags from the back seat of my car, I heard a male voice saying," Here is a gift for you from your uncle. "</seg>
<seg id="2263">"when I turned around, I felt something in my body, but I did nothing to hurt."</seg>
<seg id="2264">"then I heard a sentence, but this time in Chechnya:" how long will you still honor the family, you cheer? "</seg>
<seg id="2265">I didn't know the person.</seg>
<seg id="2266">"I only know that it was a young man, no 30 years old."</seg>
<seg id="2267">Then I lost consciousness and woke up again at the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="2268">"apparently, some women had everything to get involved and started to scream."</seg>
<seg id="2269">The man had fled.</seg>
<seg id="2270">The women had called an ambulance.</seg>
<seg id="2271">"in the hospital, I learned that I had two stitches in my right lung."</seg>
<seg id="2272">"OC Media: in which sicknesses have you been put, in which the men or women?"</seg>
<seg id="2273">Sabrina: my documents are deprecated because my male name is still on it; but the doctor understood and put me to the women.</seg>
<seg id="2274">I am very thankful to him.</seg>
<seg id="2275">"when I read his name for the first time at his office door, I got it with fear; it was a Muslim, a caucastic name."</seg>
<seg id="2276">But he turned out to be a good man.</seg>
<seg id="2277">I am grateful to him that he has been respectful with me.</seg>
<seg id="2278">I spent more than a month in the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="2279">Last February I received threats.</seg>
<seg id="2280">"they called me, wrote me - relatives, strangers, some completely unknown."</seg>
<seg id="2281">That was the beginning of a nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2282">My family was visited by neighbors and some distant relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2283">"they demanded to send me back to Chechnya, to prove that all this was a lie."</seg>
<seg id="2284">"some said to me, I had to prove it by running through the streets; others wanted me to appear on the official television in Grosny and say that I didn't change my gender that everything was only bad speech, and Photoshop."</seg>
<seg id="2285">I have grain size C - what should I have to say on TV?</seg>
<seg id="2286">OC Media: how did your family try to deal with this pressure?</seg>
<seg id="2287">Sabrina: it is still hard for her.</seg>
<seg id="2288">Some elderly people once said my mother on the street.</seg>
<seg id="2289">"they said to her," You have brought a monster to the world that has not only been your family, but the entire republic. "</seg>
<seg id="2290">"we cannot touch you because you are a pious woman, but you have to disappear from here."</seg>
<seg id="2291">My mother was too much and she lay a snare around her neck.</seg>
<seg id="2292">Luckily the neighbors came and saved them.</seg>
<seg id="2293">At the time I had to change the apartment several times a day.</seg>
<seg id="2294">I moved to an apartment and a few hours later the window stood under the window a car with darkened windscreens and a number sign with a 95.</seg>
<seg id="2295">"after it happened for the third time, it became clear to me that there was something lazy."</seg>
<seg id="2296">My human rights friends checked the numeric signs - it turned out that I was persecuted.</seg>
<seg id="2297">OC Media: how did you fly?</seg>
<seg id="2298">Sabrina: with the help of activists.</seg>
<seg id="2299">"for security reasons, I don't want to give up their names, but I want to say that I remember them all; they really helped me."</seg>
<seg id="2300">"with her help I left the country, but then something incredible happened."</seg>
<seg id="2301">I can still not understand how it could be.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Shortly before my departure from Moscow I bought a new SIM card to call my mother once I arrived.</seg>
<seg id="2303">"I bought them without registering myself, without ID, without anything."</seg>
<seg id="2304">I broke my old SIM card and threw it into the garbage.</seg>
<seg id="2305">Arrived and checked in to the hotel.</seg>
<seg id="2306">The number was registered on a stranger.</seg>
<seg id="2307">I put the SIM card into my cell phone.</seg>
<seg id="2308">"at the moment when I wanted to call my mother via WhatsApp, I got a message:" you don't think you would be in security just because you left the country? "</seg>
<seg id="2309">Our people know in which hotel you hide. you even know your number of rooms.</seg>
<seg id="2310">Only to prove you: it is the number 115.</seg>
<seg id="2311">Can you imagine this?!</seg>
<seg id="2312">That was actually my number.</seg>
<seg id="2313">OC Media: are you still in contact with your family?</seg>
<seg id="2314">Sabrina: only with my mother and my sisters.</seg>
<seg id="2315">"however, we don't talk about the gender equality, this is a taboo subject."</seg>
<seg id="2316">I still wear some traditional Caucasian elements in me.</seg>
<seg id="2317">"as much as I wish, I can't overcome this mental barrier."</seg>
<seg id="2318">"I always say that as long as my mother is alive, I will do my best to avoid it."</seg>
<seg id="2319">"when we chat with camera, I really take trouble to see how the person looks at which she recalls from her past - so to my male form."</seg>
<seg id="2320">But that is very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2321">OC Media: do you know something about the current situation in Chechnya?</seg>
<seg id="2322">"what do your friends, those who have stopped?"</seg>
<seg id="2323">Sabrina: I submitted a report in Washington last week.</seg>
<seg id="2324">I needed up-to-date information about the situation in Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2325">I spoke to someone who spent one and a half months in argun.</seg>
<seg id="2326">"he told us that during Ramadan there were no people arrested and tortured, but also that all the end of Ramadan could hardly wait, and he did not lock a new wave."</seg>
<seg id="2327">Most likely they will focus on family and relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2328">"that mean I, they probably invite the relatives, they take care of the problem with the person concerned and at the end require a proof that the so-called" "honour" "has experienced by blood satisfaction."</seg>
<seg id="2329">OC Media: are also gay men in these secret prisons?</seg>
<seg id="2330">Sabrina: a friend of me says it is not so many.</seg>
<seg id="2331">"if, then, especially those who have no rich relatives or who were dropped by their relatives in order to face Kadyrows's court."</seg>
<seg id="2332">"as far as I know, they are recorded there so that they can be presented as terrorists later."</seg>
<seg id="2333">"say," "If they are killed, they will show their bodies on television and claim they would have attacked any village or military base."</seg>
<seg id="2334">Do you understand?</seg>
<seg id="2335">"as if these people were not simply disappeared, but specifically dipped in order to radicalise themselves."</seg>
<seg id="2336">"OC Media: is this only a mutation, or do you have a source of this information?"</seg>
<seg id="2337">Sabrina: I just quote someone who was imprisoned in argun one and a half months.</seg>
<seg id="2338">He says that many people in this prison have disappeared after their beard grew.</seg>
<seg id="2339">There was nothing new since then.</seg>
<seg id="2340">They simply took them along.</seg>
<seg id="2341">"and this so-called Lord, this person was even when these people were taken."</seg>
<seg id="2342">"until now, they were not presented as bandits, but there were no reports yet. we suppose that such actions are quite possible."</seg>
<seg id="2343">Why else could it not have been allowed to shave to these people?</seg>
<seg id="2344">"do you know if these persecutions and abductions of people, who belong to a so-called" non-traditional "orientation, have already happened in the past?"</seg>
<seg id="2345">Sabrina: I always wore my hair long.</seg>
<seg id="2346">In Chechnya I had a Bob.</seg>
<seg id="2347">"I think, before 2003, I was already known in the whole of Grosny, when I was still living there - and I never had problems."</seg>
<seg id="2348">In earnest!</seg>
<seg id="2349">"even from 1998 to 1999, when the Sharia was considered, I had never had problems."</seg>
<seg id="2350">"on the contrary, it was much safer than now."</seg>
<seg id="2351">"Russia originally wanted to introduce us to" "civilisation", "but ultimately brought us back to the Stone Age."</seg>
<seg id="2352">OC Media: how is this possible under Sharia law?</seg>
<seg id="2353">"Sabrina: my eyebrows were plucked; I had dyed eyelashes, wore tubular jeans and short tops."</seg>
<seg id="2354">The Ministry of Security of Sharia has never bent my hair.</seg>
<seg id="2355">"in front of the Russian theatre in Grosny, there was a place where every evening, especially at weekends, a whole group of people like me met."</seg>
<seg id="2356">"it was a small place where several benches were standing, and the whole city knew about it; they knew why men, young people, met there."</seg>
<seg id="2357">We were never offended.</seg>
<seg id="2358">In the Chechen language there is a saying: Kharda ma Kharda. that means "Spree not about the misfortune of another."</seg>
<seg id="2359">It is often said to be children when they make fun of the sick.</seg>
<seg id="2360">"OC Media: so they simply shut their eyes closed before you, because they believed you are sick?"</seg>
<seg id="2361">Sabrina: yes.</seg>
<seg id="2362">"they have never insulted me, never hunted and never defeated."</seg>
<seg id="2363">OC Media: how long did this grace period last?</seg>
<seg id="2364">Sabrina: as long as Kadyrow stepped on the plan.</seg>
<seg id="2365">"when he was appointed Prime Minister in 2005, he began to speak about morality in television."</seg>
<seg id="2366">"he spoke not about us per se, but primarily about the behaviour of women."</seg>
<seg id="2367">"nevertheless, you could feel how people started to change in the city."</seg>
<seg id="2368">"he who had smiled and laughed before, saw you at once with suspicion."</seg>
<seg id="2369">In the time I left Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2370">"but every time I came back home, I could feel how the situation in the republic was ever worse."</seg>
<seg id="2371">OC Media: what activity do you work now?</seg>
<seg id="2372">Sabrina: I work as a waitress.</seg>
<seg id="2373">I do not earn much - 700 to 800 dollars per month are not much in the US.</seg>
<seg id="2374">"apart from that, I am still active as an activist."</seg>
<seg id="2375">"currently, I am responsible for 15 Muslim women."</seg>
<seg id="2376">I commune with them as a kind of psychologist.</seg>
<seg id="2377">"we organize teetreff, gatherings, I join them to the hospital and help them get food cards."</seg>
<seg id="2378">I have no cents for that.</seg>
<seg id="2379">I discovered these people myself when I clapped them.</seg>
<seg id="2380">I am Muslims and wants to help those who need help.</seg>
<seg id="2381">OC Media: do you wear a Hiddenab?</seg>
<seg id="2382">Sabrina: this is albern.</seg>
<seg id="2383">"so nature, it has nothing to do with religion."</seg>
<seg id="2384">"this is exactly the same as cheques who want to prophesy with foam in front of the mouth, that there is no swaying with them."</seg>
<seg id="2385">"the Dagemen have those who have the Cabardines who, the Russians, too, and on all the planet they are - but" not in Chechnya. ""</seg>
<seg id="2386">"I come from there, so it is unpleasant to hear something like that."</seg>
<seg id="2387">I meet so many men from the Caucasus.</seg>
<seg id="2388">Many of them - practicing Muslims who go to the mosque and fasting during Ramadan - live together with men.</seg>
<seg id="2389">"you know, many think for men who love men, and they believe that you change his sex to make more intimate experiences. but that's a failure."</seg>
<seg id="2390">"these are two different things - two different ways of feeling, to be accurate, different life settings."</seg>
<seg id="2391">For me it is the most important thing to feel in my own skin and not to be ashamed of my body.</seg>
<seg id="2392">Not whether I have a partner or not.</seg>
<seg id="2393">"sorry, that I am so personal here, but my last intimate relationship is now longer than a year ago."</seg>
<seg id="2394">And I'm not sad at all - I just know that I am now myself.</seg>

<seg id="2396">The Iranian Ahwaz region suffers from an unusually high unemployment rate and poverty rate within the native Arab population.</seg>
<seg id="2397">"since the last few months, there has been a strong increase in suicide."</seg>
<seg id="2398">The photo of the Arab workers in Iran was provided by the Patriotic Arab Democratic Movement in Ahwaz.</seg>

<seg id="2400">"the self-burning of a man named Jassim Moramazi on 27 August recovered the desperate situation of the Arab Ahwazi community in Iran, which is shaped by poverty and unemployment, in the spotlight."</seg>
<seg id="2401">Moramazi was married and had a child; he lived in Al-Thawra in the Ahwaz region in the southwest of Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2402">"he suffered from anxiety, depression, and he was ashamed of his own helplessness that could arise for his family, so Ahwazi human rights groups who want to work in Ahwaz and remain anonymous."</seg>
<seg id="2403">A video shared on YouTube held the moments after he had kindled himself.</seg>
<seg id="2404">"some people quickly managed to extinguish the flames, and Moramazi was brought to the Taleghani hospital in the city of Ahwaz."</seg>
<seg id="2405">According to local sources the burns were so strong that the doctors could do nothing more.</seg>
<seg id="2406">He died a short time later.</seg>
<seg id="2407">"it was not the only suicide that occurred in August within the Arab Ahwazi minority, and activists on the spot warn that even more men could take life."</seg>
<seg id="2408">"Ahwazi Centre for Human Rights reported that this month some others - Hamid Maniat, Ali Hazbawi, Sayed Falah Moussawi and Shahab Bani Tamim."</seg>
<seg id="2409">"their stories have one thing in common: they were all family fathers who felt helpless and incapable of feeding their families, because of persecution by the Iranian government, helpless and incapable of carrying out their families."</seg>
<seg id="2410">"Arabic Ahwazi suffer from poverty, unemployment and discrimination"</seg>
<seg id="2411">"the region, in which a large part of the Arab Ahwazi community living in Iran, has been shaken by a profound economic crisis that makes it difficult for the native Arab population to deny its living."</seg>
<seg id="2412">"in a century ago, the Arab Ahwaz was a predominantly autonomous region in Iran until the Pahlavi monarchy acquired power and made big efforts in 1925 to terminate ethnic autonomy in Iran."</seg>
<seg id="2413">"in the Ahwaz region, there are some of the largest oil and gas fields in Iran, as well as some of the most valuable and most valuable useful areas for Iranian agriculture."</seg>
<seg id="2414">"in spite of these valuable resources, the regional economy continues to develop slowly, and the local population receives little from this wealth."</seg>
<seg id="2415">"it is often victims of untreated diseases, hunger and deprivation."</seg>
<seg id="2416">"the Iranian regime uses the Ahwazi Arabs systematically jobs in the local oil, gas and petrochemical industries."</seg>
<seg id="2417">"the government has also built a variety of trunks, the waters of the Arab regions in the Persian areas, where the provinces are Isfahan, Yazd, Kerman and Ghom."</seg>
<seg id="2418">These dams have only led to worsen the devastation caused in the region and destroy local agriculture as well as the fish and palms industry.</seg>
<seg id="2419">The unemployment rate among the Arab aMohawzi-adolescents now rose to 81%.</seg>
<seg id="2420">"Nour Mohammed Pur, the Iranian general director for cooperatives, work and social welfare, reported that 5% of Ahwazis who have completed work, completed 55% a secondary school and 45% have a university degree."</seg>
<seg id="2421">A "systematic strategy... aims to destroy the spirit of national resistance"</seg>
<seg id="2422">"Karim Dohimi, an Iranian Ahwazi human rights activist with residence in London, told Global Voices that the present situation, a mixture of poverty, unemployment and racist ethnic discrimination, leads to a" high rise "of the number of suicide among the young Ahwazi males."</seg>
<seg id="2423">Dohimi said that especially unemployment has become worse. the reason for this is a combination of a high number of ethnic Persians and an anti-Arab discrimination in the process of setting:</seg>
<seg id="2424">"as officials and institutions prefer not to employ Arab workers, the local Arab Ahwazi will deprive of access to employment opportunities in all sectors."</seg>
<seg id="2425">"this is part of a systematic policy of the ruling regime, aimed at destroying the spirit of national resistance of young Arabs and forcing them to earn their living from their homeland Ahwaz."</seg>
<seg id="2426">"there are people who had to change their first name and surname to hide their belonging to Ahwazi, as even Arab names at the workplace are not tolerated, let alone the speaking of Arabic language or wearing Arab clothing."</seg>
<seg id="2427">"given the circumstances that the Arab Ahwazi have to endure, human rights activist alarm attacks before the situation is explosive."</seg>
<seg id="2428">It remains to be seen whether the world is waking up and aware of it.</seg>

<seg id="2433">"why I don't identify myself with feminism, even with the intersectional not"</seg>
<seg id="2434">Detail of a photo. recorded by: Pixabay. published under the CC0 Creative Commons License.</seg>
<seg id="2435">The following article is an revised version of the statement issued by Ayomide Zuri and originally published on Afroféminas's website. the article was subject to several discussions where many different positions were expressed.</seg>
<seg id="2436">You can read in the comments below the original text.</seg>
<seg id="2437">"if I say I am not a feminist, many women react - especially white women who call themselves as intersectionale feminists - with frustration."</seg>
<seg id="2438">They wonder why I am not part of the movement.</seg>
<seg id="2439">They even put well thought-out scientific and social arguments in front of me why I should be feminist and why we should be all feminist in general.</seg>
<seg id="2440">"for example, women still earn less money in spite of equal education than men."</seg>
<seg id="2441">That women still stand still under strict observation when it comes to what they are allowed to do with their bodies.</seg>
<seg id="2442">Violence against women is a global epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="2443">"or that cultural and social norms are still to ensure that women sooner or later come across a glass ceiling in various areas of life, and that discrimination on account of gender is still drawn across the many different countries and beliefs."</seg>
<seg id="2444">All this is aware and known to me.</seg>
<seg id="2445">I am convinced and I suffer double and threefly below.</seg>
<seg id="2446">I am a black woman.</seg>
<seg id="2447">"and yet: when I get to talk on skin color, on racism, on black female women, on black women in the LGBTI community or on black women from the Diaspora; when I mention how we have always been abused under racial segregation and discrimination, both in and outside the feminist movement, many white feminists, and white intersectional feminists have been silent."</seg>
<seg id="2448">"but nevertheless all agree that women - all women should come together in order to" "lift up their voices and" "Kumbaya, my lord" "to achieve equal rights (some) of women."</seg>
<seg id="2449">"but they don't want to talk about that in addition to sexualized violence, there is an institutionalised form of racist motivating violence that we are exposed to black women in two times."</seg>
<seg id="2450">"in addition, black women and women of other ethnicities and countries of origin deserve less than white men and women."</seg>
<seg id="2451">"that black girls and girls with migration background are referred to school more often than white girls, due to obvious integration problems."</seg>
<seg id="2452">"or that women in black spheres and women are exposed to a higher risk of migrant background, domestic violence and violence in partnership, as white women."</seg>
<seg id="2453">"on the one hand, I want that all men and all men and all men should not have equal rights at all; on the other hand, I can't connect myself as a black woman, in whose center is the white woman who refuses to take into account injustices in their thinking, which refers both to the sex and the skin color of a person."</seg>
<seg id="2454">I am exhausted and won't fight for my membership in a white-feminist sphere that has always rejected me and countless other black women.</seg>
<seg id="2455">"in 1851 Sojourner complained in her speech," "Am I not a wife?" "and I also refuse to maintain an ideology in which the black woman is a poor and marginalized being in historical terms."</seg>
<seg id="2456">"I refuse to join groupings, which also absorbs our customs and customs through cultural inclination, in order to advance their egocentric program."</seg>
<seg id="2457">"I will no longer try to suggest white women to suggest the importance of overlapping of skin colour and sex. some of them will continue to silence the importance of black women for feminist movement, no matter how many black women try to reward them for the better."</seg>
<seg id="2458">"although intersectional feminism was founded in order to give women of different information a home and distinguish themselves from white feminism, the word" feminism "is still in its name."</seg>
<seg id="2459">"I prefer to release myself fully and completely from feminism and to join the movement of womanism, which is so persistent for my dark skin and my status as a woman, which is so stubborn that intersectionality is celebrated as a novel phenomenon."</seg>
<seg id="2460">"now it is more important than ever before, that we will define black women according to our own ideas and enter into the spheres which are created by us for us."</seg>
<seg id="2461">"Clenora Hudson-Weems, the author of the book Africana womanism: reclaiming ourselves (about: Africa-Womanismus: as we recapture ourselves) speaks of how we can defend ourselves in this way, in which they are completely safe and in which the cultural, spiritual, spiritual, physical, and even the spiritual elements can be revered to the black woman."</seg>
<seg id="2462">"although some white and intersectional feminists will immediately call separatism and exclusion, after reading these lines, I ask you to inform yourself about hypocrisy and the contradictions of feminist movement, of which the black woman is concerned."</seg>
<seg id="2463">"in a womanistic environment, I can lift up black women and women from other cultures, as in this paradigm I exist."</seg>
<seg id="2464">I will be recognized as part of this paradigm because of my dark skin and my existence as a woman.</seg>
<seg id="2465">"I, a black woman, can bloom in an environment where my life is neither exaggerated nor ignored, nor rejected."</seg>

<seg id="2467">"this post by Todd Reubold was originally published on Ensia.com, a magazine that reports in particular about international efforts to solve environmental problems."</seg>
<seg id="2468">"as part of a content sharing agreement, this article will be published here again."</seg>
<seg id="2469">"Nabil Musa repeatedly travelled over the past 7 years, mostly with surfboard or in the canoe - with a special concern through the Kurdistan region in Iraq. his mission aims to make people aware of the importance of clean waters for present and future generations."</seg>
<seg id="2470">In this documentary by Emily Kinskey we follow Musa who explains his relationship with the rivers of the region and the impact of pollution on his church.</seg>
<seg id="2471">"I wanted to do something for the river that we had lost when I was a child," Musa tells. "</seg>
<seg id="2472">"scientists from all over the country fear that the decades of war, the construction of dams, pollution and uncontrolled development led to a direct water crisis in Iraq."</seg>

<seg id="2480">The following article is the shortened and edited version of the article "The wave of violence against women in Paraguay" by Kurtural.</seg>
<seg id="2481">Most names were changed to protect the affected individuals.</seg>
<seg id="2482">"a police commissioner said Ada Báez that she could do nothing against Luis Balbuena, her partner, who had become violent against her."</seg>
<seg id="2483">"since the end of her relationship, some time had passed and the police said that her statement would be put to the files, but more could not be done."</seg>
<seg id="2484">"as another Mrs. Balbuena showed for mistreatment, the acclaimed display of Ada Báez didn't use anything."</seg>
<seg id="2485">"a few days later, the second woman returned to her ad."</seg>
<seg id="2486">Breaking the vicious circle of violence against women is difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2487">"if women ever display ads at all, they generally do not receive support from the state."</seg>
<seg id="2488">"in many cases, women are also financially dependent on men who abuse them. this also explains why only 20% of all women who admit to be victims of violence can be reported at all in the law enforcement authorities."</seg>
<seg id="2489">"content 1 Strike and Statistic 2 Invisible malfunctions and a legal system that does not underline Paraguay's laws: good approach, defective implementation punches and statistics"</seg>
<seg id="2490">"it is difficult to determine how many women really are abused, says Myrian González, researcher for gender questions at Centro de Documentación y Estudios, a social science research institution in Paraguay."</seg>
<seg id="2491">"however, the numbers available are alarming."</seg>
<seg id="2492">"in 2015, there were 9600 ads for domestic violence at the Attorney Office. at 70% of this, there was violence against women."</seg>
<seg id="2493">86% of the ads in the police came from women.</seg>
<seg id="2494">There were more than 5000 ads due to domestic violence in the peace courts. here too 86% of women's ads arrived here.</seg>
<seg id="2495">"in the ads, 40% of women claimed that they were physically mistreated, 55% of women spoke of psychic abuse."</seg>
<seg id="2496">"however, these statistics do not show the true extent of violence against women in Paraguay."</seg>
<seg id="2497">"according to the Paraguayan women's minister Ana Baiardi, only a few of these crimes are actually shown." "for every woman who is refunded in Paraguay because of psychic abuse, 9 women who do not do this."</seg>
<seg id="2498">"on any woman, which is refunded because of physical abuse, two women who do not do so, declared it at the end of 2014."</seg>
<seg id="2499">"because women's murder in Paraguay is not an own criminal record, the prosecution authorities cannot adequately document how many women are murdered by their current or former partners every year."</seg>
<seg id="2500">"only until August 2016, journalists counted at least 12 cases of suicide in the country."</seg>
<seg id="2501">The Coordinator for Human Rights in Paraguay documented at least 37 cases where women were murdered by their current or former partners.</seg>
<seg id="2502">According to their estimates in Paraguay every ten days a woman dies because of violence by men.</seg>

<seg id="2504">Invisible malfunctions and a legal system that undertakes nothing</seg>
<seg id="2505">"before Mariana Brítez was the firm friend of Carlos Vera, he insisted that she called him the name of all her former friends."</seg>
<seg id="2506">"in the beginning she didn't want to do that, but then she said."</seg>
<seg id="2507">"today, Mariana is 28 years old and no longer with Carlos. but for two years she earned the mental force on the one hand - one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time the most difficult recognizable:"</seg>
<seg id="2508">I never thought I would be a victim of ill-treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2509">"when I read it earlier, I always thought that only women are going to be submissive because they let themselves be deceived by violent men."</seg>
<seg id="2510">I was convinced that this would never happen to me.</seg>
<seg id="2511">Mariana used social media to report about the abuse by Carlos Vera.</seg>
<seg id="2512">"without name, she wrote posts on Facebook in which she described his insults and various attacks during her two-year relationship and told how he had isolated her."</seg>
<seg id="2513">"many people responded to their contributions, including Carlos himself. he asked rhetorical if he ever raised his hand against them and refused to admit that his behaviour was also a form of ill-treatment."</seg>
<seg id="2514">Other Facebook users asked Mariana why they had fallen by Carlos for so long and did not leave it earlier.</seg>
<seg id="2515">"it seemed almost like they wanted to say that victims of abuse, at least, had a certain complicity in it."</seg>
<seg id="2516">"Victoria Santos, which was not from Paraguay, fought almost eight years with the authorities in Paraguay to prove that her former partner she had been ill-treated."</seg>
<seg id="2517">Victoria is a member of the Yo te creo network (I believe you ") that consists of women who are all victims of abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2518">"in the group, they can talk to others about their experiences, listen to each other and support each other."</seg>
<seg id="2519">They do what many others do not do: they take the statements of women seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2520">In Victorias case everything started with psychic mistreatment.</seg>
<seg id="2521">Her wealthy partner finally managed to convince her that she was worthless.</seg>
<seg id="2522">Then he began to beat them.</seg>
<seg id="2523">"Victorias ads with the authorities remained without result and also from their relatives, they did not get any support."</seg>
<seg id="2524">"it led a process against its former partner who developed into an imperceptible juridical struggle between Paraguay and its home country, in which it was mainly about money, power and the influence of her former partner."</seg>
<seg id="2525">"Paraguays Laws: good approach, inadequate implementation"</seg>
<seg id="2526">"in Paraguay there are many laws that are very good, but not being applied."</seg>
<seg id="2527">"the display of abuse is a way full of resistance and a fight against corruption in the judiciary," says Victoria Santos. "</seg>
<seg id="2528">"Carmen Echauri, a representative of the UN organization for women in Paraguay, also sees great problems in applying the laws in the country."</seg>
<seg id="2529">"on 10 August 2016, a bill was discussed in the Paraguayan Parliament, which was known under the hashtag # Porellas (# forge)."</seg>
<seg id="2530">This hashtag and the Movement # NiUnaMenos (# NonEineWeniger) are part of a campaign on Twitter supported by Amnesty International.</seg>
<seg id="2531">The original draft of the law foresees to explain Femizid into an independent criminal case and punish hardens as it is already in the neighbouring countries of Argentina and Bolivia.</seg>
<seg id="2532">"in this way, the legislated text was changed in some respects, in order to prevent the decriminalisation of abortions, which is generally forbidden in Paraguay and sentenced to five years imprisonment."</seg>
<seg id="2533">"the original bill had planned, the majority of the (bureaucratic and economic) procedural costs that have to bear the victims of violence at the present time, if they simply reimburse themselves and would like to receive a safe place to impose the state."</seg>
<seg id="2534">Echauri argued that the law is not effective if the legislature does not provide sufficient financial resources for it:</seg>
<seg id="2535">In Paraguay mistreatment is seen as part of interpersonal relationships.</seg>
<seg id="2536">"here, a rethinking must take place so that violence is no longer considered something normal."</seg>
<seg id="2537">"who is silent about these facts, complicates and contributes to the fact that the perpetrators will escape."</seg>
<seg id="2538">We have to refund for a long time until maltreatment is no longer considered normal.</seg>
<seg id="2539">"on 10 November 2016, the law was adopted in the paraguayan Senate. previously, parts of the law had been changed."</seg>
<seg id="2540">The opinions on the changes are dealt with.</seg>
<seg id="2541">The section concerning reconciliation was seen as an opportunity for the aggressor to attack his victim again.</seg>
<seg id="2542">"the filing of words" gender, "" political force "and" sexual harassment "from parts of the law applies however as a great setback."</seg>

<seg id="2547">"more than one year ago, the Hungarian authorities have closed the independent Arabic-language newspaper Azamn because of their reporting on corruption in the sultant."</seg>
<seg id="2548">"Yousef Al-Haj, one of the editors of the newspaper, is still in prison, where he is a prison term."</seg>
<seg id="2549">"two other editors of Azamn, Ibrahim Al-Maamari and zaher Al-Abri, were also arrested and placed in court, but later returned."</seg>
<seg id="2550">"Oman has been ruled by Sultan Qabus ibn Said, who came to power after having completed his father, Said ibn Taimur, by a coup d" état. "</seg>
<seg id="2551">"since then, he has been suffering as the only Sultan, the most important offices in the country: Prime Minister, Defence Minister, Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces, Minister of Foreign Affairs, Foreign Minister, Chairman of the Supreme Council for the Planning and President of the Central Bank."</seg>
<seg id="2552">"the Sultan's rule is characterized by the persisting efforts of security forces, in particular the domestic secret service, restricting public freedoms, including press freedom, including press freedom, blogger and other activists, to be intimidated and imprisoned."</seg>
<seg id="2553">"the authorities limit peaceful and legitimate activities in the field of human rights systematically and hinder citizens, including activists, to express their views on public affairs of the country, such as corruption in authorities and institutions, both online and offline."</seg>
<seg id="2554">"the attack on the Azamn newspaper, its closure and the imprisonment three of its editors last year is a hard blow to press freedom in the country."</seg>
<seg id="2555">Azamn is an independent newspaper reported on corruption in Oman since its foundation in 2007 until it was banned by the authorities in August 2016.</seg>
<seg id="2556">"on 28 July 2016, security forces Ibrahim Al-Maamari, chief editor of Azamn, fixed an article entitled" High-level parties "hands of the judiciary."</seg>
<seg id="2557">"in the report, government officials accused of having put judges of the Supreme Court in Oman under pressure to raise a verdict in an inheritance dispute."</seg>

<seg id="2560">"on 3 August 2016, zaher Al-Abri, member of the editorial board, was charged by ISS before the special department and arrested by the security forces upon his arrival."</seg>
<seg id="2561">"on 9 August 2016, the ISS took the deputy head-editor Yousef Al-Haj, who had acted as editor-in-chief after Al-Maamaris arrest."</seg>
<seg id="2562">"the newspaper was closed indefinitely after the Minister of Information had given the statement that" the publication and dissemination of the newspaper is prohibited on any way, including online, from 9 August 2016. "</seg>
<seg id="2563">"on 26 September 2016, the first trial took place in Maskat's trial against Al-Maamari, Al-Haj and Al-Abri."</seg>
<seg id="2564">The Court sentenced the three journalists to prison sentences and also ordered the final closing of the newspaper.</seg>
<seg id="2565">"al-Maamari and Al-Haj were both condemned, among other things, because of disturbance of the public order," abuse of the Internet "and" undermining of the state. ""</seg>
<seg id="2566">"in addition, Al-Haj was found guilty of a violation of a prohibition of publication and slander."</seg>
<seg id="2567">"al-Maamari and Al-Haj were sentenced to three years of imprisonment and fines in the amount of 3,000 Messianic Rial (7800 US dollars)."</seg>
<seg id="2568">"al-Abri was sentenced to a year of imprisonment and a fine of 1000 Rial (2,600 US dollars) after he was found guilty of the use of" an information network for the dissemination of material that could pose a threat to public order. ""</seg>
<seg id="2569">"for Al-Abri a damages deposit of 5,000 oman Rial (13 000 US dollars) was arrested and he was released from prison on 22 August 2016."</seg>
<seg id="2570">"the Appeals Court rejected Al-Abri at a hearing on 26 December 2016, but Al-Haj sentenced to six months in prison for one year and Al-Maamari."</seg>
<seg id="2571">Al-Maamari was dismissed from central prison on 10 April 2017. al-Haj is still in prison where he stabbed his imprisonment sentence.</seg>
<seg id="2572">The Appeals Court also highlighted the decision of the Ministry of Information to close the newspaper "Azamn."</seg>
<seg id="2573">"despite the decision of the Court to allow Azamn again, the newspaper looks like attacks by the oman government."</seg>
<seg id="2574">"on 8 January, the Minister of Information issued a statement with which the closing of" "Azamn" "was extended for three months."</seg>
<seg id="2575">"on 8 May 2017, the Minister of Information personally signed a further statement in which the closing of" "Azamn" "was extended by three additional months and with which the Minister presented himself once more against the decision of the Appeals Court, to restore the publication of the newspaper."</seg>
<seg id="2576">The permanent closure of Azamn and the attacks on journalists of the newspaper are not the only cases in which Oman has been violated in recent times the freedom of the press.</seg>
<seg id="2577">"other injuries include the closure of the website of the Independent magazine Mowatin and the exercise of pressure on Albalad, the first independent online newspaper of the country to cease operation."</seg>
<seg id="2578">"due to the continuous closure of the Azamn and the detention of journalist Al-Haj, the impression that the Iranian authorities are still not ready to end the extensive violation of press freedom."</seg>
<seg id="2579">"the Gulf Centre for Human Rights (Gulf Centre for Human Rights, GCHR) calls for the Italian authorities to:"</seg>
<seg id="2580">1. how to release Yousef Al-Haj immediately and unconditionally;</seg>

<seg id="2587">Ranjit Warrier 2016 in Zambia takes place with his consent</seg>
<seg id="2588">Medical research in Africa is rarely mentioned in the media. it is a growing area that addresses one of the most urgent needs of the continent.</seg>
<seg id="2589">"there are two reasons for the need for medical research conducted on site: firstly, there are many medicines and vaccines to cover the special medical need on the African continent."</seg>
<seg id="2590">"diseases such as AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria are far more serious in the poorest countries of Africa than elsewhere, and lack of investments for the research of these diseases by the pharmaceutical companies are a major problem."</seg>
<seg id="2591">"second, research, which is carried out by African scientists, helps build its own research capacities in Africa. a larger role in science and technology can only be conducive to the economic growth of the continent."</seg>
<seg id="2592">"Dr. Ranjit Warrier is Director of the Central Department at the Centre for Infectious Disease Research in Zambia (Centre for Infectious Disease Research in Zambia, CIDRZ)."</seg>
<seg id="2593">"he grew up in Lusaka, Zambia in the 1990s, especially when the AIDS epidemic showed the first serious impact on national health."</seg>
<seg id="2594">"he left Zambia for a study in the United States, first in Louisiana, later in Indiana."</seg>
<seg id="2595">"as a Postdoc at the University of Pennsylvania, he was researching HIV virus before he decided to go back home to support the Serbian healthcare system."</seg>
<seg id="2596">"with Global Voices, Dr. warrier discussed the future of medical research in Zambia and about misunderstandings of the media about this research."</seg>
<seg id="2597">(Disclaimer: Dr. Warrier speaks as a private person).</seg>
<seg id="2598">Global Voices (GV): what is your research topic?</seg>
<seg id="2599">Ranjit Warrier RW: at the moment my work focuses on the application of research results. I support the Serbian national program for antiretroviral therapy (ART) with laboratory tests.</seg>
<seg id="2600">"in addition, I just launched a research program for the development of molecular diagnostic tests for HIV, TB and other relevant pathogens."</seg>
<seg id="2601">Q: what are your opinion about the important current science topics in your country and in general in Africa?</seg>
<seg id="2602">How do they differ from those in Western countries?</seg>
<seg id="2603">RW: there are no basic research here. we only use solutions that have been developed elsewhere.</seg>
<seg id="2604">"this has to change, otherwise we will always remain recipient instead of being Macher."</seg>
<seg id="2605">"the solutions we get are often not suitable in our environment, and sometimes it is even impossible to use them here."</seg>
<seg id="2606">GM: where does financing and support come from?</seg>
<seg id="2607">Is it sufficient?</seg>
<seg id="2608">How simple or difficult is it to find suitable scientists for the projects?</seg>
<seg id="2609">RW: from the USA and Europe.</seg>
<seg id="2610">The projects are supported differently well.</seg>
<seg id="2611">"it is difficult to find people who want to come back or go here, as financing and development chances are better in other countries."</seg>
<seg id="2612">GM: how is the research infrastructure?</seg>
<seg id="2613">Which obstacles are there in your routine research work you did not previously had?</seg>
<seg id="2614">"RW: the basic infrastructure does not meet the standards in developed countries. it costs a lot of money to have a continuous supply of electricity, water and internet."</seg>
<seg id="2615">"laboratory material is expensive, and it takes months to import it from other countries."</seg>
<seg id="2616">GM: what is the opinion of the public about science and scientists in Africa?</seg>
<seg id="2617">"RW: there are already interest, but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods."</seg>
<seg id="2618">I would suggest that critical thinking and scientific methods should be taught in schools to improve the situation.</seg>
<seg id="2619">"GM: how big is your opinion the potential of scientific research in Africa, what should it focus and how can we support development?"</seg>
<seg id="2620">RW: the potential is amazing.</seg>
<seg id="2621">I have seen great students of all ages.</seg>
<seg id="2622">"there is need for special scientific training, starting at any age."</seg>
<seg id="2623">"social sciences, computer science, big data, study of space, health care (non-transferable and contagious diseases) and efficiency of traditional medicine will benefit from this."</seg>
<seg id="2624">Q: can you describe the advantages and disadvantages of life as a scientist in Africa towards Western countries based on your experience?</seg>
<seg id="2625">"RW: often, it is the limited speed to do things, and the difficult access to scientific expertise that challenges these challenges."</seg>
<seg id="2626">"the system that magazines are only accessible against payment (the so-called" "Paywall" "), also limited the amount of available information and the speed of research."</seg>
<seg id="2627">From the USA to India: how "open source" seed producers change global food production</seg>
<seg id="2628">"this post by Rachel Cernansky was originally published on the website Ensia.com, a magazine which reports about solutions for environmental problems worldwide."</seg>
<seg id="2629">Frank Morton has been bred in the USA since the 1980s.</seg>
<seg id="2630">"its company offers 114 varieties, such as Outfit, the first plant that has been cultivated and consumed by NASA astronauts in space."</seg>
<seg id="2631">"for almost 20 years, Morton's work was limited only by its own seizure and the question of how many salads it can get."</seg>
<seg id="2632">"but at the beginning of the 2000s, he noted that more and more salads were patented and that he could not use them further for breeding."</seg>
<seg id="2633">"patents gaged not only for individual varieties, but also for certain properties, such as resistance to disease, special red or green or curved leaves."</seg>
<seg id="2634">"in recent years more and more such patents have been registered to more and more plants such as cereal or cardboard varieties. due to this trend, plant breeders, environmentalists and experts ensure food security for the future of food production."</seg>
<seg id="2635">"as a passionate representative of a millennia-old tradition, Morton still preserves salad, but it takes longer since his work becomes more and more complicated by ever more restrictions."</seg>
<seg id="2636">It is as if in a river a boulder is lying around which I must dull.</seg>
<seg id="2637">"so we have to do this now, but it's a break with the breeding tradition," he says. "I think these patents go too far."</seg>
<seg id="2638">"and if they stand before judgment, no one can breed a new kind of salad because all features are already patented."</seg>
<seg id="2639">"however, he is very careful and endeavored to use no material protected as intellectual property."</seg>
<seg id="2640">He has also joined a movement that is getting bigger in the USA and everywhere in the world: open Source Breeding ("Open Source" breeding).</seg>
<seg id="2641">Astronauts of the International Space Station ISS have bred and eaten red roast salad of the variety Outfit in the "greenhouse" of the station. there it is tested whether plants can be grown in space.</seg>
<seg id="2642">Photo: NASA</seg>
<seg id="2643">It is no coincidence that this name sounds rather as if the movement from the IT sector would come from and not from the field of plant breeding.</seg>
<seg id="2644">The Open Source Seed Initiative (initiative for "open source" seeds) is inspired by the free "open source" software that provides alternatives to copyrighted software.</seg>
<seg id="2645">It was launched in order to ensure that some plant species and genes are not protected as intellectual property and are thus permanently usable for plant breeders.</seg>
<seg id="2646">"within the framework of the initiative, called short Ossi, US breeders can commit themselves to free use of the seeds they bred."</seg>
<seg id="2647">"however, this does not mean that they do not continue to do business with their seeds and sell it." open source "breeders only allow others to breed their seeds, and not immediately trophies - two aspects that are banned or prescribed by many plant patents."</seg>
<seg id="2648">Dozens of breeders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since its launch in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2649">Gloomy views</seg>
<seg id="2650">"Professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison and Ossi board member Jack Kloppenburg have control over the seeds and the opportunity to breed new plants, both important for food security and environmental protection."</seg>
<seg id="2651">"according to seed, seed plays a role in larger contexts such as biodiversity, rights of farmers, control over the food system and use of chemicals in agriculture. independent breeders would try to use the latter not or only little by breeding seed with natural resistance."</seg>
<seg id="2652">Kloppenburg stresses that the "open source" movement does not deal with genetically modified plants.</seg>
<seg id="2653">"all kinds of plants could be patented, whether vegetables, grain, genetically modified or not, from ecological agriculture or not."</seg>
<seg id="2654">Food sovereignty without seed sovereignty is not possible. "</seg>
<seg id="2655">The members of the Open Source Seed Initiative are committed to keep their seeds available free of charge.</seg>
<seg id="2656">Photo by Jack Kloppenburg.</seg>
<seg id="2657">"Ossi supporters argue that the future of food supply is endangered as the available gene pool is due to the increasingly numerous intellectual property rights on plant material, which is thus becoming increasingly available, continuously shrink."</seg>
<seg id="2658">"Claire Luby, executive director of Ossi, has engaged in her PhD thesis with a genetic variation in carrots and their availability."</seg>
<seg id="2659">"for other plants, there are not such estimates, but experts like Luby suspect that massively grown plants like wheat are still patinated in a larger style than lettuce or carrots."</seg>
<seg id="2660">A question of view</seg>
<seg id="2661">Plants are cultivated so that they can target targeted characteristics - from those through which their taste or color improves through to such because they thrive in certain environments and resist threats such as pests or diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2662">"opponents of patents on plant properties point out that the available plant material for breeders is increasing by more and more patents. currently, genetic diversity is more unnecessary than ever since the changed conditions by climate change are much worse predictable."</seg>
<seg id="2663">"in an email, Monsanto spokesperson Carly Scaduto recognises that genetic diversity is generally important and crucial for Monsanto's activities."</seg>
<seg id="2664">"however, it contradicts that intellectual property holds other breeders, as" patents and the protection of plant variations innovation promote. "" a patent is basically a plan that everyone can follow as soon as the patent has expired. "</seg>
<seg id="2665">Often these instructions help others to come with another method to the same result.</seg>
<seg id="2666">"such protection does not inhibit innovation, but promotes them by making more material and know-how available to the public."</seg>
<seg id="2667">"Morton looks different: 20 years to wait, until a patent expires, certainly does not promote innovations."</seg>
<seg id="2668">"and if you have to wait so long to breed plants that have been adapted to the changed environment conditions, you would have lost the struggle already."</seg>
<seg id="2669">"however, the main argument for Morton is that genetic resources have always been a general good and should remain:" independent plant breeders do not have time nor money for such formalities, and monetary incentives are not attractive for us. "</seg>
<seg id="2670">We want to make farmers their work easier.</seg>
<seg id="2671">"this is what drives us, and it becomes impossible for us to continue to use the best and newest genetic resources."</seg>
<seg id="2672">"overall, Morton interferes with the concept of patenting plant features:" we don't really create the characteristics themselves. "</seg>
<seg id="2673">"the plants form it themselves, and as breeders, we have no idea how the plants do that."</seg>
<seg id="2674">A mystery of nature. "</seg>
<seg id="2675">"for Carol Deppe, plant breeders in the US State Oregon and Ossi board member, there is another important aspect of plant breeding:" those who breed a variety also breed his own values into them. "</seg>
<seg id="2676">Those who believe in industrial agriculture with large farms and monocultures are required for their cultivation of masculine herbicides that breed in its varieties of this concept of agriculture.</seg>
<seg id="2677">My concept is exactly opposite. "</seg>
<seg id="2678">"while some medium-sized companies (such as Monsanto are) patents, most smaller seed companies, even without surviving patents - they either reject patenting or they consider it too expensive and therefore not rewarding or both is the case."</seg>
<seg id="2679">The independent plant breeder Frank Morton is looking for salads in his breeding garden.</seg>
<seg id="2680">Photo by Karen Morton.</seg>
<seg id="2681">"Morton also believes that breeders would be more innovative by avoiding plant patenting:" "it looks like I am with my efforts to produce something new, stronger than companies that patented."</seg>
<seg id="2682">"I need constantly new material for my catalogue, since I know that my competitors are selling my varieties in a few years themselves," he says. "with a patent, you are protected for 20 years before competition, so that in my opinion it is quite easy."</seg>
<seg id="2683">"although the USA seem to be leaders in the" open source "breeding, the concept is now spreading rapidly across the globe."</seg>
<seg id="2684">"in India, the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture (" Centre for Sustainable Agriculture "), which describes itself as a professional organization in the field of resources, is a" open source "seed programme."</seg>
<seg id="2685">It also assists them to come to "Open Source" seeds and sell their own.</seg>
<seg id="2686">"the German organization Agrecol is working on an open source license, which is ultimately a form of formal and legally binding form of the Ossi obligation for breeders in the European Union."</seg>
<seg id="2687">"(regulations for breeding differ from country to country, thus the Ossi obligation cannot simply be taken over one in Europe or other parts of the world.)"</seg>
<seg id="2688">"at the beginning of November 2016, the executive of the European Union, the European Commission, declares that conventionally bred plants should not be patentable. thus, she speaks against the current practice of the European Patent Office, which permits patents on conventionally bred plants."</seg>
<seg id="2689">"however, an explanation is not a law; now it is to the governments of the Member States to bring the Patent Office to implement this new line."</seg>
<seg id="2690">"in October 2016, the Dutch organisation Hivos organized a conference on" open source "seed systems in Ethiopia, farmers, operators of seed banks and representatives of governments, non-governmental organisations and seed companies from all over East Africa to learn about the" open source "seed movement and the global trend towards the patenting of seeds."</seg>
<seg id="2691">"Willy Douma, responsible for the Hivos' program for" open source "seed systems, declares that the organization is currently building a global alliance for" open source "seed systems, for the planned next year of official start-up."</seg>
<seg id="2692">"an association of environmental protection and development aid groups (including Hivos, the international nonprofit development aid organization USC Canada and the action group on erosion, Technology and Concentration) has compiled a database of seeds and biodiversity worldwide to publish the Seed Map Project, a seed map."</seg>
<seg id="2693">"in September, the Global Alliance for the Future of Food, the global alliance for the future of eating - a network of aid organizations such as the WK Kellogg Foundation, the McKnight Foundation and others - has published a report."</seg>
<seg id="2694">"the report also emphasises the importance of a diverse, local supply of seeds for sustainable food systems - a context that Luby von Ossi hopes that soon more people will be recognized."</seg>
<seg id="2695">"the movement for regional and ecological foods particularly focused on where and how something is cultivated, and seed systems have hardly played a role," says Luby. "we are now trying to make people clearer that there is even more behind their food."</seg>
<seg id="2696">Rachel Cernansky is free journalist.</seg>

<seg id="2742">"according to the Association for Freedom of Thought and Expression (AFTE), Egyptian authorities blocked from 24 May to 06 August 133 websites. this resulted in technical tests on the networks of various Internet Service Providers (ISP), including Orange, Vodafone and Etisalat."</seg>
<seg id="2743">"AFTE also documented the blocking of providers, possible through the conversion of internet censorship and private surfing, so called Virtual Private Networks (VPNs)"</seg>
<seg id="2744">AFTE reported in her research:</seg>
<seg id="2745">"on Monday, 12 June we noticed how the blocking of web pages that VPNs began."</seg>
<seg id="2746">Such a practice points to the government's intention to continue blocking and filtering the content on which Egyptian users could have access.</seg>
<seg id="2747">"the situation is additionally exacerbated by the fact that the censorship decisions are made behind closed doors, whereby the Egyptian population has no legal basis, with which it can proceed against trial against these actions."</seg>
<seg id="2748">Now the question arises: how far is the Egyptian government ready to go with censorship and who will attack it next?</seg>
<seg id="2749">Is Rio de Janeiro in war?</seg>
<seg id="2750">The inhabitants quarrel.</seg>

<seg id="2753">"day by day newspapers in Brazil with gloomy headlines from Rio de Janeiro, the second largest city in the country and home of numerous postcard motifs."</seg>
<seg id="2754">Some of these headlines are as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2755">"14-year-old shot in school," "Every second day a police officer in Rio de Janeiro has assassinated," "thieves smoke pharmacy with military weapons," "President Temer sends 8500 soldiers of the army, Navy and Air Force to Rio."</seg>
<seg id="2756">"in the middle of the economic crisis and in a tense financial situation, the wave of violence in Rio reached the highest level in Rio for 10 years."</seg>
<seg id="2757">The Brazilian non-governmental organisation Global Justice even called the United Nations to intervene.</seg>
<seg id="2758">Reports like these have become everyday and this is unacceptable & # 8212; at least find the manager of a local newspaper.</seg>
<seg id="2759">"the magazine" "Extra" "published for the detailed coverage of violence in Rio on 16 August published the editorial" "This is not normal" "in which she announced a new section called" "War in Rio". ""</seg>
<seg id="2760">All reports on violence in the city are now published there.</seg>
<seg id="2761">The motives for their decision explained the paper as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2762">"it will continue to report about crimes that happen in every metropolis on the world such as murder, robbery, sexual breach, etc. everything, however, deviates from the civilized standard and what happened only in Rio will be published in the section" "War in Rio". "(...) This is our way to call: this is not normal!"</seg>
<seg id="2763">This is the only alternative so that we as journalists do not close our eyes to cruelty.</seg>
<seg id="2764">"in a four-minute video shared on Facebook, Octávio Guedes, editor-in-chief of the newspaper declared that this decision was not an occasion for pride, but rather a sign of failure:"</seg>
<seg id="2765">Extra is probably the only newspaper around the world with a rubrik in a country that does not recognise the war at all.</seg>
<seg id="2766">"in the same video, a journalist of the newspaper explains that according to the Institute for Internal Security in Rio de Janeiro, there are 843 areas controlled by criminal organisations."</seg>
<seg id="2767">"in the editorial article, the newspaper writes:"</seg>
<seg id="2768">"we are aware that a war discourse, when it is distorted, can also be used to cover atrocities of the police, who only shoots and then ask questions to cover."</seg>
<seg id="2769">"but we defend the war based on information and the fight against corruption in the police, whose aim is not the civilian population, but the economic power of the Mafia and its partners."</seg>
<seg id="2770">Does the term "war" harm more than it?</seg>
<seg id="2771">"in an article on the news portal The Intercept Brasil, the journalist Cecília Oliveira argued to designate the violence as a" war. ""</seg>
<seg id="2772">This is not a war.</seg>
<seg id="2773">"this is the result of corruption and poor planning - as an extra in the analysis of military operations in Rio itself - in combination with insufficient investments in personnel, education and a historical and self-sufficient neglect of public service."</seg>
<seg id="2774">To remember: the state of Rio de Janeiro is bigger than just his capital.</seg>

<seg id="2777">"according to Cecília, Rio de Janeiro is wrong:" 22 of the 30 most violent cities in Brazil lie according to statistics of 2015 in the north and north-east of the country. these are the most up-to-date data. "</seg>
<seg id="2778">None of these cities is located in the federal state of Rio de Janeiro.</seg>
<seg id="2779">"if we look at the morale rates per state, Rio is in place 16," she writes. "</seg>
<seg id="2780">"extra belongs to the company Globo, the largest media company in South America, that, as Cecília stresses, has been repeating the state's security policy for many years."</seg>
<seg id="2781">"these security policy measures also included the founding of the UPP (Unidade de Polícia Pacificadora), a police unit established by the Federal State of Rio in 2003, whose aim is to conquer a Favela by employing a massive police record and permanently stationing a unit there."</seg>
<seg id="2782">"in the beginning, this actually led to a decrease of violent death cases. for several years, the UPP has become increasingly under attack after several reports on chicane and repressions against the poor communities who were supposed to protect the newly created police unit."</seg>
<seg id="2783">"on his Facebook page, the journalist João Paulo Charleaux cited from one of his articles from 2010 in which he explains why violence in Rio does not meet the criteria set out by the Geneva Convention - criteria for the term" civil war. ""</seg>
<seg id="2784">He writes:</seg>
<seg id="2785">"in addition to legal issues, the classification of the situation in Rio as a war also draws serious consequences for the people."</seg>
<seg id="2786">"this requires the state to use means and paths that are typical of a war. for this, penetration into the territory of a" enemy, "in which a civil war is an indefinite point in the landscape and becomes the object for" collateral damage "and" lost spheres. ""</seg>
<seg id="2787">"war back or forth, the fact is that the residents of the Favelas in Rio continue to suffer."</seg>

<seg id="2802">"since the beginning of the Syrian revolution in 2011 and in the subsequent civil war, many Syrian cities suffer brutal siege and blockades, mainly by Assad's regime against loyal troops."</seg>
<seg id="2803">"according to victories Watch, a joint initiative of the Peace Organization PAX and the Research Institute The Syria Institute, Homs, Deir Ezzor and Idlib are currently around one million Syrians in a state of siege."</seg>

<seg id="2805">"many governments, international organizations and the Syrian opposition assume, based on the United Nations investigations and other human rights organisations, that the massacre of the Assad regime has been committed."</seg>
<seg id="2806">"since 2013, these rebels controlled areas outside Damascus have stood under siege, which led to local residents, or by tunnels and control points of lubricated foods."</seg>
<seg id="2807">"through the years of blockade, traditional foods such as meat have become indispensable for large parts of the population."</seg>
<seg id="2808">"as a counterpart, a group of Syrian humanitarian aid and academics teaches the inhabitants of East Ghoutas, how they can plant their own fungi as" life-saving food source. ""</seg>
<seg id="2809">They call themselves Ghiras Alnahda and carry out the project together with the NGO Al Adala.</seg>
<seg id="2810">"fungi do not belong to the common foods planted in Syria, and are only extremely rare in the Syrian cuisine. however, it makes it an attractive food source for many residents of the besieged East Ghouta."</seg>
<seg id="2811">"the Direct of the project, Abo Nabil, said to the French news agency AFP:"</seg>
<seg id="2812">"we decided to cultivate mushrooms because they have a high nutritional value, similar to meat, and because you can plant them in houses and cellars."</seg>
<seg id="2813">"Dr. Ahmed Leila, one of the organizers, reports Global Voices that has been fighting for three years to announce this project and expressed its relief that it gains more and more prominence."</seg>
<seg id="2814">"to collect money for the initiative, we use the humanitarian Crowdfunding platform CanDo in consultation with the NGO Ghiras Alnahda."</seg>
<seg id="2815">"it is planned to convey 125 families knowledge to planting mushrooms, such as Dr. Leila to Global Voices."</seg>
<seg id="2816">"at the time of the constitution of this article, they have reached over 100% of their expected target of around 12,700 €, but will still collect donations to Cando until Monday, 04 September 2017."</seg>
<seg id="2817">The initiative is dependent on generators that keep temperatures stable at 25 ° C and humidity at 80%.</seg>
<seg id="2818">"because of the fuel shortage, locally produced fuels are used in plastic to supply the generators with the necessary energy."</seg>
<seg id="2819">"Dr. Leila said Global Voices that they began with the" "production of mushroom seeds" "coming from regions before they checked their quality and whether they are suitable for consumption."</seg>
<seg id="2820">"then they planted a small mushroom farm in a tub. as this succeeded, they used a larger pan. and so on."</seg>
<seg id="2821">Now they have designed a "educational farm for the region."</seg>
<seg id="2822">"since the beginning of the project and after another 3 months, they have distributed fungi throughout East Ghouta for free."</seg>
<seg id="2823">Dr. Leila explained that it is part of a larger movement.</seg>

<seg id="2833">Several hundred people protested on 21 October in many districts in Portugal and called for justice for the victims of the fires that were grassed in the north of Portugal last week.</seg>
<seg id="2834">Forty-two persons died and around 70 were injured as a result of the forest fires of 15 and 16 October. this led to the fact that the government cancelled the last week of solidarity with the victims for 3 days a state of state.</seg>
<seg id="2835">Fires were also registered in the Galicia region in Spain where there were 4 deaths.</seg>
<seg id="2836">"it is estimated that there were more than 500 fire breakouts spread in the northern and central regions of the country, and about 250 million hectares of forest and numerous villages reached."</seg>
<seg id="2837">"in June Pedrógão Grande occurred a similar tragedy, where there were 64 deaths and more than 200 injured."</seg>
<seg id="2838">"according to the European forestry monitoring system, which monitors the forest areas by satellite photos alone, about 500,000 hectares of forest are burned in Portugal alone - an area of the size of the Lisbon district."</seg>
<seg id="2839">So that you can make a better picture of the seriousness of the situation: there is no fire in 4 districts.</seg>

<seg id="2852">"a far-reaching proposal for the roll-out, which the government had brought into serious fires in 2003 and 2005, was objected by the municipalities that saw the new rules as an obstacle to investments."</seg>
<seg id="2853">"the government led a loosening of the law, which allowed construction activity in case the applicant had funds for self-protection - that was an open backdoor so that everything could be built," says João Sorval in the same article in the newspaper Público. "</seg>
<seg id="2854">"the environmental organization Quercus pointed out that large surfaces with eucalyptus, trees made of readily combustible wood, themselves, as in a vicious circle, continues to spread further."</seg>
<seg id="2855">"these problems are added that the website of the Civil Defence of Portugal on 15 and 16 October, when residents sought information or tried to contact relatives, was offline."</seg>
<seg id="2856">It was a private initiative that provided the population with information: they used their own civil protection data using the fogos.pt and informed the population in real time about the location and spread of the fires.</seg>
<seg id="2857">"the project was launched in 2015 by the developer João Pina in order to simplify the work of the fire brigade and was so crucial in October that the server failed to withstand the onslaught of 400,000 users who followed the fires: the website counted more than half a million hits."</seg>

<seg id="2885">The Taliban known for their hatred for Hazara came closer and closer.</seg>
<seg id="2886">Many Hazara left the country towards Pakistan or Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2887">"a few days after his escape, Ashark found himself in Pakistan."</seg>
<seg id="2888">For a few years he worked in a coal mine. the work was heavy and made him sick.</seg>
<seg id="2889">"then he took that which was left of his small reward, and went to Iran. once again, he was in a foreign country together with other refugees and dragged sacks with mortars that were heavier than himself, in order to earn his living."</seg>
<seg id="2890">"at that time, as today, the life of Afghan refugees in Iran was characterised by misery and exploitation."</seg>
<seg id="2891">"it was really tough," Ashark remembered in an interview with Global Voices. "we (Afghan refugees) lived in an empty building on the construction site, on which we also worked."</seg>
<seg id="2892">There was no services there and no heating. we hung nylon in front of the open windows so that we could not be frozen at night.</seg>
<seg id="2893">"after four years, Ashark left his life without papers in Iran and made herself ready for the journey to Europe."</seg>
<seg id="2894">"during the dangerous passage on the sea, he suffered shipwreck and stranded on a small, uninhabited Greek island."</seg>
<seg id="2895">"after the Greek authorities rejected asylum application, Ashark came to Italy in 2002."</seg>
<seg id="2896">"some time ago, Ashark was homeless, running alone through the streets of Rome, slept in parks and went to a church that distributed twice a day food to aid."</seg>
<seg id="2897">"it is true that Italy is a second chance for expired asylum seekers due to relatively high resolution quotas. however, it is true that the conditions for asylum seekers in the country are catastrophic."</seg>
<seg id="2898">"the Human Rights Organisation Civil Liberties Union for Europe writes, the system suffers under a general lack of transparency."</seg>
<seg id="2899">"the large majority of asylum seekers are housed in more than 3000" "special reception centres". "they are improvised facilities in the hands of unqualified and unprepared personnel."</seg>
<seg id="2900">"according to Italian law, asylum seekers can only be allocated to a reception centre if they officially have submitted an application to asylum."</seg>
<seg id="2901">"until then people who have no money for accommodation, either rely on the hospitality of friends or have to sleep on the street."</seg>
<seg id="2902">So it was Asharaf.</seg>
<seg id="2903">"but his unwalled livelihood helped Asharaf, soon to free himself from these conditions."</seg>
<seg id="2904">"after spending several years in the construction industry for several years, Ashark put his entire savings into the establishment of a hostels in Venice."</seg>

<seg id="2913">"according to the official estimates, about 20,000 Afghans live in Italy."</seg>
<seg id="2914">"for many of them, the country is a transition solution to other European countries."</seg>
<seg id="2915">"in recent years, some of Afghan operating companies, including tailors, travel agencies, hotels and restaurants have been created."</seg>
<seg id="2916">Some Afghan restaurants were even praised in the Italian press for their excellent cuisine.</seg>

<seg id="2921">"where a risk is, there are also ways," says Ashark with a smile. "I want to invest in Afghanistan."</seg>
<seg id="2922">I have never forgotten my country and I cannot live happily when I know my people suffer.</seg>
