this is James Ris@@ en .
they might know him because he won the Pul@@ itzer Prize as a New York Times repor@@ ter .
&quot; long before someone had heard of Edward Snow@@ den , Ris@@ en wrote a book in which he was spectac@@ ularly published that the N@@ SA illeg@@ ally listened illeg@@ ally by Americans . &quot;
but it is another chapter that should leave a lasting impression .
&quot; in this , he describes a cat@@ astrop@@ hic US intelligence service , in which the CIA literally handed out designs for a nuclear bomb . &quot;
&quot; if that sounds crazy , read it . &quot;
it is an incredible story .
but do you know who the chapter didn &apos;t fall at all ?
the US Government .
&quot; for almost 10 years , the government has as@@ cer@@ tained against cr@@ acks and called upon him to name its alleged sources . &quot;
&quot; in this turn , he became a symbol of the pattern of the government to condem@@ n wh@@ ist@@ leb@@ lower and to spy journalists . &quot;
&quot; according to the First Constitutional Court , the media have the right to publish secret information . &quot;
&quot; but it is impossible to apply this right if media cannot get this information , and if they cannot protect the identity of the Mu@@ tigen they offer . &quot;
&quot; so when the government arrived at Ris@@ en , he did something what many cour@@ age@@ ous repor@@ ters did before him : he refused and said he would rather go to prison . &quot;
&quot; from 2007 to 2015 , Ris@@ en lived with the risk to go to prison . &quot;
&quot; but then , just days before the trial , something extraordinary happened . &quot;
&quot; suddenly , although they indicate for years that it would be essential for their case , the demands of the government were dropped to cr@@ acks . &quot;
the reason : in the time of electronic monitoring the repor@@ ters and sources can be hidden less and less .
&quot; instead of separ@@ ating and cr@@ acking tears , they could also do his digital foot@@ prints for him . &quot;
&quot; so the investig@@ ators , without his consent , have been kept secret by his telephone numbers , &quot;
&quot; just like his e @-@ mail data , finance and bank information , his credit information , and even travel advice with the list of his flights . &quot;
&quot; in the midst of this information they found evidence that they used to condem@@ n Jeff@@ rey Sterling , a CIA wh@@ ist@@ leb@@ lower and cr@@ acks . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , this is only one of many cases . &quot;
&quot; President Obama promised to protect wh@@ ist@@ leb@@ lower , but instead , the judi@@ ci@@ ary has condemned more than all US governments before him . &quot;
&quot; now you can imagine how this can be a problem , especially because the government classi@@ fies too much of its work as secret . &quot;
&quot; since September 11 , almost every article on national security was the result of a wh@@ ist@@ leb@@ lower to a journalist . &quot;
&quot; so we put the press work on the game , which is to be protected by the first constitutional complaint , because the government has more and more possibilities to spy on all . &quot;
&quot; but just as the government &apos;s technology allows to b@@ ypass the rights of repor@@ ters , the press can also use technologies to better protect their sources . &quot;
&quot; they can do that from the moment in which they receive contact , rather than in the after@@ math , in the witness stand . &quot;
&quot; today there are communication software , which didn &apos;t yet exist when Ris@@ en had written his book , and it is much safer than normal emails or phone calls . &quot;
&quot; such technology is Sec@@ ure@@ Drop , an open source transmission system for wh@@ ist@@ leb@@ lower , which was originally developed by the Internet @-@ famous Aaron S@@ wart@@ z , and is now developed by the Freedom of the Press Foundation where I work . &quot;
&quot; instead of sending an e @-@ mail , go to a news site , just like the Washington Post here . &quot;
&quot; there you can upload documents or send information , as with any ordinary contact form . &quot;
&quot; these are then encrypted and stored on a server , where only the respective news agency has access . &quot;
&quot; so the government can no longer proc@@ ure information secre@@ tly , and many of the information they would request would not be available from the outs@@ et . &quot;
but Sec@@ ure@@ Drop is only a small part of the whole to protect the freedom of the press in the 21st century .
&quot; unfortunately , governments around the world are developing new spy technologies that end@@ anger all of us . &quot;
&quot; it is important to us to ensure that not only technology in@@ separ@@ ators such as Edward Snow@@ den have a possibility to apply missions . it is just as important that we protect the next wh@@ ist@@ leb@@ lower , &quot;
&quot; who knows about gri@@ ev@@ ances in the supply of soldiers , who wants to report on over@@ crowded hospitals . or the next environmental worker , the alarm to the contaminated water of F@@ lin@@ t . or a Wall@@ street in@@ sider who war@@ ns us before the next financial crisis . &quot;
&quot; after all , these technologies were not only made for those who want to expose crimes , but to protect our fundamental rights . &quot;
thanks .
&#91; on 3 April 2016 the biggest data check of history was published . &#93; &#91; the &quot; Panama Papers &quot; reveal that Rei@@ che and M@@ ighty &#93; have hidden &#91; enormous sums of money in tax ha@@ v@@ ens &#93; . &#93; This week we were asked of news about a le@@ ak of 11 million documents of the law firm Mos@@ sack Fon@@ sec@@ a .
the publication of these documents gives a small insight into the secret world of tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
&quot; we get an impression of how customers , banks and lawyers go to companies like Mos@@ sack Fon@@ sec@@ a and say : &quot; okay , we need an anonymous company . can you set up this ? &quot;
&quot; we actually see the emails , the exchange of messages , how the whole system works as it works . &quot;
this has already led to very direct consequences .
the Prime Minister has res@@ igned .
there are also reports that an ally of the brutal Syrian dict@@ ator Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad &apos;s letter companies in tax ha@@ v@@ ens has .
&quot; it is said that a trace of $ 2 billion leads to Russia &apos;s President Vladimir Putin , over a close friend of children &apos;s days , a famous cell@@ ist . &quot;
&quot; now there will be a lot of ri@@ cher people and others who wait for the next release , and on the next reve@@ aling documents . &quot;
now it sounds like the plot of a writer or a John Gr@@ is@@ ham @-@ novel .
&quot; it seems to we@@ ep away from you , me , ordinary people . &quot;
why should that come to us ?
&quot; but the truth is : if the rich and powerful are able to hide their fortune in tax ha@@ v@@ ens and not pay all their taxes , this means less money for important public services such as health care , education , roads . &quot;
and that concerns us all .
&quot; for my organization , Global Wit@@ ness , these revel@@ ations are phenom@@ enal . &quot;
&quot; in the whole world , media and leading politicians discuss how secret tax ha@@ v@@ ens are used by some few to hide their fortune and disgu@@ ise -- something we have been discussing and reve@@ aling for ten years . &quot;
&quot; I think many people seem very conf@@ using this whole world , and it is hard to understand how these tax ha@@ v@@ ens function . &quot;
I always imagine it like a mat@@ r@@ jo@@ sch@@ kap@@ u@@ ppe .
&quot; so you have a company in another company , in another company , which makes it almost impossible to really understand who is behind these bones . &quot;
&quot; it can be very difficult for criminal prosecution and tax authorities , as well as for journalists or civil society to truly understand what matters . &quot;
I think it is also interesting that there are fewer reports on this matter in the USA .
&quot; presum@@ ably , because there were so far no prominent Americans who occurred in these revel@@ ations , this sc@@ andal . &quot;
now it is not that there are no rich Americans hiding their fortune in tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
&quot; however , by the principle of which these tax ha@@ v@@ ens work , Mos@@ sack Fon@@ sec@@ a has fewer American customers . &quot;
&quot; if we had a check from the Cay@@ man Islands or even from Del@@ aware , Wy@@ oming or Nevada , we would see much more cases and examples that have connections to the USA . &quot;
&quot; in fact , in some US states you need less information to provide less information to establish a company than to get a library card . &quot;
this type of in@@ transparency in the US allowed employees of school districts to rip school@@ children .
sc@@ amm@@ ers are allowed to rip off especially sus@@ cep@@ tible fe@@ eders .
it is this kind of behavior that concerns us all .
here at Global Wit@@ ness we wanted to find out how all this looks in practice .
how does it work ?
so we sent a cover@@ t investig@@ ator to the offices of 13 lawyers in Manhattan .
&quot; our investig@@ ator found himself as an African minister , who wanted to bring suspic@@ ious money to the United States to buy a house , a yacht , a private jet . &quot;
we really shock@@ ed that all of us made suggestions to our investig@@ ator how he could transfer his money .
&quot; none of these lawyers accepted us as clients , and of course nobody was given money to anybody . however , it shows the problem with this system . &quot;
it is also important not to consider this as individual cases .
it is not about a single lawyer who has submitted proposals to our cover@@ t investig@@ ator .
&quot; it &apos;s not about a single top politi@@ cian , wrapped in a sc@@ andal . &quot;
&quot; it is about how the system works through corruption , tax ev@@ asion , poverty and inst@@ ability . &quot;
&quot; and to cope with this , we need to change the rules . &quot;
we need to change the rules to make this type of behavior difficult .
&quot; this may sound very sad , as if we could not do anything about it ; as if nothing could have changed , as if there is always the rich and powerful . &quot;
&quot; but as a born optim@@ ist , I really see that some have begun to change . &quot;
&quot; in the last few years , we have seen more transparency regarding the owners of companies . &quot;
the topic found political attention by British Prime Minister David Cameron on the G@@ 8 summit in 2013 in Northern Ireland .
&quot; since then , the EU det@@ ects in central regi@@ sters at a national level who really is behind companies in Europe and who controls them . &quot;
one of the unpleasant facts is that the US is lag@@ ging behind .
&quot; representatives of both parties have brought a bill in both parliamentary chambers , but this does not make the progress we would like to see . &quot;
&quot; we would really like to see how these Panama revel@@ ations , this huge insight into the world of tax ha@@ v@@ ens , is used as a means to provide more transparency in the US and globally . &quot;
&quot; for us at Global Wit@@ ness , this is a moment of change . &quot;
we need ordinary people who are angry when they see how other people can hide their true identity behind bog@@ us firms .
we need leaders in the economy that stand up and say : &quot; In@@ transparency is not good for business . &quot;
we need leading politicians who recognize the problem and use it to end this type of in@@ transparency by laws .
&quot; together we can finally end the In@@ transparency , which now enables this kind of tax ev@@ asion , corruption and money la@@ under@@ ing , finally ending . &quot;
this is the story of how I almost kid@@ n@@ apped and landed in the trunk of a red Maz@@ da .
&quot; a day after I finished my design study , I made a back@@ yard sale . &quot;
a guy in the red Maz@@ da stopped and looked at my stuff .
he bought one of my works of art .
he was alone in the city and just made a road trip across the country . afterwards he would go to peace cor@@ ps .
I invited him to a beer . he told me about how he wanted to change the world .
it was late . I got tired .
&quot; while we paid the bill , I made the mistake asking him , &quot; &quot; Where do you sleep tonight ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
he made the whole thing worse : &quot; I don &apos;t know . &quot;
&quot; and I thought , &quot; Oh , man ! &quot;
what do I do now ? &quot;
who does not know the situation ?
do I have to offer a sleeping place now ?
&quot; but I just got to know him ! he said he would go to the Peace Cor@@ ps , but I don &apos;t know if he really plans it . I don &apos;t want to escape in the trunk of a Maz@@ das ! &quot;
this is a small trunk !
then I heard myself saying : &quot; I have an air mattress . you can sleep in my living room . &quot;
&quot; one voice in my head said : &quot; &quot; Oh , how please ? &quot;
&quot; at night I was lying in bed , I was star@@ ing on the ceiling and thought : &quot; Oh man ! what did I get there ? &quot;
a stranger sleeps in my living room .
what if he is crazy ?
&quot; I got such a fear that I got out of the bed , on to@@ es pointed to the door , and my bedroom door shut down . &quot;
but he was not crazy .
we are still in contact .
the work of art that he had bought by me today hangs in his classroom . he is now a teacher .
this was my first experience as a host . it has changed my point of view completely .
&quot; maybe the people who were sold to me as a stranger , really friends , who were only waiting to be discovered ? &quot;
&quot; sleeping on my air mattress was normal for me . when I moved to San Francisco , I took the air mattress . &quot;
&quot; we make a leap , two years later ... &quot;
&quot; I am unemployed , almost pl@@ ast@@ ered , my ro@@ ommate goes out and the rent is increased . &quot;
I learned that at that time there was a design conference in the city . all hotels were fully booked .
&quot; I believe , creativity can create it to turn fear into fun . &quot;
&quot; I wrote to my best friend and new ro@@ ommate Brian Ch@@ es@@ ky : &quot; Brian , I think about how we could earn something . &quot;
ha !
we created a website and established so &quot; Air Matt@@ resses and Breakfast &quot; &#91; AIR@@ Bed a@@ N@@ d Breakfast = Air@@ b@@ n@@ b &#93; .
three lucky guests were allowed to sleep for 20 dollars on the air mattress on wooden floors .
&quot; they found it great , and we too . &quot;
&quot; I am sure , our cheese @-@ ham @-@ om@@ el@@ ets ta@@ sted completely different because we made it for our guests . &quot;
&quot; we tou@@ red with them throughout the city . when we left our last guest and fell the door to the castle , Brian and me died . &quot;
had we just discovered that we could find new friends at the same time and pay our rent ?
things came to play .
&quot; my former ro@@ ommate , N@@ ate Ble@@ char@@ czy@@ k , joined us as a developer . &quot;
we wanted to find out if you could make it a business concept .
&quot; so we presented the investors : &quot; &quot; we want to create a website where people post public pictures of their private rooms , their bedrooms , their bathrooms -- the kind of rooms whose doors one closes when visiting . &quot;
over the internet they can then invite wild people to stay with them .
this will be the next big thing ! &quot;
we waited for the missi@@ le to ign@@ ite .
but they do not .
&quot; no one who is still at comfort would invest in a business , allowing stran@@ gers to sleep in apartments of other people . &quot;
why ?
because we all learned as children that stran@@ gers are dangerous .
&quot; if you have a problem , you get to the things that you can do well . we could design . &quot;
&quot; at the Kunst@@ akademie , we learned that design is much more than just look and h@@ ap@@ tics -- it is the overall experience . &quot;
&quot; we had learned how to design objects , but now we wanted to create immense trust between people who had never met before . &quot;
can design make such a thing ?
is it possible to create trust with design ?
I would like to give you a sample of what degree of confidence we sc@@ anned .
it is a 30 @-@ seconds experiment . it will force you out of your comfort zone .
thum@@ bs up when you are ready .
take your mobile into your hand .
now I want you to un@@ lock your mobile phone .
enter your un@@ locked cell phone from your left seat neighbour .
this quiet p@@ airing of panic you can now feel -- -- is exactly what hosts feel when they open the door first time .
the only thing that is more personal than your mobile phone is your home .
&quot; visitors can not only read your SMS , they see your bedroom , your kitchen , your toilet . &quot;
how does it feel to hold the un@@ locked mobile phone of a stranger in your hands ?
most sense the responsibility .
&quot; so , most of the guests feel when they stay elsewhere . &quot;
only for this reason our company can exist .
&quot; just like , who actually has Al Gor@@ es cell phone ? &quot;
could you please announce to Twitter that he is chann@@ elled for the President &apos;s office ?
you can now return the mobile phones .
you have now experienced what kind of trust we want to build . I would like to tell you of some discoveries .
what if we had changed a little detail in this experiment ?
&quot; what if your neigh@@ bor would have imagined once with his name , if he had told wh@@ ence he comes from , like his dog or his children ? &quot;
imagine you would have 150 testim@@ onies that all say : &quot; he can really hold very well un@@ locked hands ! &quot;
how would you feel if you had to give up your mobile phone ?
because a well thought @-@ out feedback system strengthens trust .
at the beginning we did some things wrong .
it was hard for the people to give negative app@@ rais@@ als .
&quot; in the end , we decided to wait until both host and guest had submitted their app@@ rais@@ als before we put them online . &quot;
last week we discovered something new .
&quot; we conducted a study with Stan@@ ford . we examined how likely it is that people trust each other , depending on how similar they are in terms of age and residence . &quot;
&quot; little surprisingly , we trust the people most similar to us . &quot;
&quot; the more differences we find , the less we trust . &quot;
this is a natural social bias .
it is exciting to add a person &apos;s call -- in our case by jud@@ gements .
&quot; if you have less than three jud@@ gements , nothing changes . &quot;
&quot; but if you have more than ten , everything changes . &quot;
a good reputation ru@@ sts simil@@ arities .
the right design can help us overcome some of our deeply rooted preference .
&quot; in addition , we learned that trust is dependent on how much one pays off . &quot;
here you can see the reactions to the first message of a guest .
&quot; if you tell too little , like &quot; &quot; Hi ! &quot; , &quot; you will not get an answer . &quot;
&quot; as for example , &quot; &quot; I have problems with my mother &quot; -- -- the request is not accepted . &quot;
&quot; so there is an optimal degree of openness , e.g. &quot; &quot; Tol@@ le Art@@ works in your apartment ! I make a vacation with my family holiday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
how can you create it with design to make this degree of openness ?
we use the size of the text field to recommend the correct amount of text . we also give tips on which topics you should write something .
our whole company builds on the hope that the right design can help overcome our pre@@ judi@@ ces against stran@@ gers .
what we did not expect was the great amount of people who were more than willing to leave these pre@@ judi@@ ces .
here you see how many people claim our offer .
you can see three things .
&quot; first , incredibly good luck . &quot;
second : the ti@@ rel@@ ess work of our team .
&quot; third , a need not previously covered . &quot;
&quot; for us , the business runs very well . &quot;
&quot; of course , there are times when not everything runs smoothly . &quot;
there were guests who celebrated un@@ lawful parties or devast@@ ated apartments .
hosts have let guests stand in the rain .
at the beginning of the project I worked with the customer service . all calls came directly to my mobile phone .
I stood at the foref@@ ront when trust was broken .
there is nothing worse than these calls . it hur@@ ts when I only think of it .
&quot; the dis@@ appointment that one h@@ ears in the voice of the call@@ ers , was and will always be our greatest motivation to further improve . &quot;
&quot; fortunately , only a fraction had a fraction of the 123 million overnight stays . &quot;
for people trust one another rightly .
&quot; when trust is working , wonderful things can arise . &quot;
one of our guests made holidays in Uruguay . there he suffered a heart attack .
his host drove him to the hospital .
he even donated blood for the necessary operation !
here is his assessment :
perfect house for travelers who tend to tend to heart attacks due to sed@@ entary activities .
the area is beautiful and equipped with sufficient hospitals .
&quot; J@@ avier and Ale@@ j@@ andra are real guar@@ dian angels who save lives , even though they don &apos;t know one at all . &quot;
&quot; you drive to the hospital in your own car when you die , and wait while you get a b@@ ypass . &quot;
&quot; because they don &apos;t want to feel lon@@ ely , they bring books past . &quot;
you can even stay longer without counting the extra nights .
I can only recommend it ! &quot;
&quot; of course , not every stay happens . &quot;
but these relationships behind the pure monetary transaction are exactly what you want to achieve with the Share Economy .
&quot; when I stum@@ bled upon this term for the first time , I asked myself : &quot;
how does the idea of sharing with money transactions fit together ?
it is an economic trade here .
&quot; but now simply to name &quot; &quot; rental industry &quot; , &quot; the thing is not fair . &quot;
share Economy describes a trade that promises human relationships .
people put a part of themselves open and that changes everything .
&quot; when you &apos;re travelling today , it &apos;s easy to compare with Fast Food . it is efficient and reliable , but less authentic . &quot;
what if travelling would be a rich buffet from local impressions ?
&quot; what would be if at any place you visited , a group there would wait to fill a thoroughly and show one in a pub craw@@ l district , of which one has never heard ; &quot;
or if you could learn cooking from a five @-@ star chef ?
&quot; nowadays , apartments are designed according to the principle of privacy . &quot;
what if we would design apartments from reason to clas@@ p together ?
what would it look like ?
what if cities would assume the thought of shared participation ?
I imagine cities that enable us society and relationships instead of sol@@ itude and de@@ preci@@ ation .
&quot; in South Korea &apos;s capital Seoul , this project has already begun . many parking places belonging to the government , &quot;
were now offered residents . students who were looking for a place to stay
&quot; were medi@@ ated to people whose children were with@@ drawn . incub@@ ator programs were started , &quot;
&quot; to finance new start @-@ ups in Share Economy , over our platform alone 7@@ 85 000 people in 191 countries will be guest at a stranger or even host . &quot;
so the idea seems to be not as crazy as it was taught us .
we did not re@@ inv@@ ent the wheel .
hospitality had already existed before .
there were similar websites in front of us .
so why did our work just work ?
&quot; apart from luck and timing , we realized that you can find the right design with the components of trust . &quot;
design can help us overcome deep @-@ rooted pre@@ judi@@ ces .
I think this is amazing .
almost overwhelming .
I have to think about it every time a red Maz@@ da is passing by .
&quot; of course , we know that design cannot solve any problem . &quot;
&quot; but if it could help us , if it had this great influence , I wonder what we will be able to use design soon . &quot;
thanks .
what do you think when you look at me ?
a beli@@ ever ? an expert ?
maybe even a sister .
&quot; or supp@@ ressed , bra@@ in@@ washed , a terrorist ? &quot;
or simply a delay in the security check at the airport .
this is actually true .
I don &apos;t give you the blame for your negative impressions .
so the media represent people who look like me .
a study revealed that 80 % of reporting on Islam and Muslims is negative .
studies show : the Americans think most would not know Muslims .
&quot; probably , people don &apos;t talk to their drivers . &quot;
for those who have never met a Muslim : it &apos;s great to get to know you .
I tell you who I am .
&quot; I am a mother , a coffee lover -- double es@@ pres@@ so , with cream extra . &quot;
&quot; I am intro@@ ver@@ ted , &quot;
a Mö@@ cht@@ eg@@ ern @-@ Fitness @-@ Fan@@ ati@@ ker@@ in
and I am a practicing spiritual Muslim .
&quot; but not like Lady G@@ aga sings , because , baby , I was not born so . &quot;
I decided to do this .
when I was 17 years old I met the decision to ou@@ ten me .
&quot; no , not as hom@@ os@@ exual human , like some of my friends but as Muslims . I decided to wear the Hi@@ j@@ ab , my head cover . &quot;
&quot; my femin@@ ist friends were horri@@ fied : &quot; &quot; why do you supp@@ ress yourself ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the funny thing was : at that time , it was a femin@@ ist declaration of independence , as opposed to the pressure I felt as 17 @-@ year @-@ old to adapt myself to a perfect and unbe@@ atable beauty ideal . &quot;
I did not only accept the faith of my parents .
I have w@@ rest@@ led with the Qur &apos;@@ an .
&quot; I read it , thought , asked , doub@@ ted and ultimately believed . &quot;
my relationship with God was not love at first sight .
it was confidence and slow devot@@ ion which deep@@ ened with every reading of the Qur &apos;@@ an .
the beauty of the rhythm sometimes brings me to cry .
I know myself in it . I feel God knows me .
&quot; do you ever feel that anyone percei@@ ves you , fully understands you , and yet in love ? &quot;
this is how it feels .
&quot; later I married and started like all the good Egyptians , my career as an engineer . &quot;
&quot; later , after my marriage , I had a child , and basically lived the &quot; Egyptian @-@ American Dream . &quot; &quot;
then came the terrible morning in September 2001 .
many of you probably remember exactly where they were there .
&quot; I sat in my kitchen , had breakfast at the end , looked up on the screen and saw the word &quot; &quot; Break@@ ing News . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; smoke , air@@ planes flew into buildings , people sp@@ rang from the buildings . &quot;
what was that ?
an accident ?
a technical distur@@ b@@ ance ?
my shock quickly turned into rebel@@ lion .
why should one do something like this ?
&quot; I switched to the TV channel and heard : &quot; ... &quot; Muslim terrorists ... &quot; ... &quot; in the name of Islam ... &quot; &quot; ... &quot; ... &quot; ... &quot; ... &quot; ... &quot; ... &quot; ... &quot;
&quot; Oh , my God . &quot;
&quot; not only my country has been attacked , but in the N@@ u the deeds of others turned me into a susp@@ ect . &quot;
the same day we had to drive through the Middle East of the USA to move into a new city and start with the post@@ graduate studies .
&quot; I remember , as we sail@@ ed -- as we sail@@ ed -- so deep it went into my seat , and I feared the first time being recognized as Muslims . &quot;
&quot; we went to our apartment this night , in a new city where it felt like a completely different world . &quot;
&quot; and then , I saw and read the war@@ nings of the national Islamic organizations saying , &quot; Be alert , &quot; &quot; Be careful , &quot; &quot; Stay careful in well @-@ lit areas , &quot; &quot; don &apos;t worry . &quot;
I stayed the whole week inside .
then it was Friday at that week -- the day when Muslims gather to pray .
&quot; and again the war@@ nings were : &quot; &quot; not on this first Friday , the mos@@ que could be a goal . &quot;
I saw the extensive coverage .
&quot; the feelings were un@@ fil@@ tered un@@ fil@@ tered , and I also heard of attacks on Muslims or of people who were considered to be free for Muslims . &quot;
there were really fire attacks on mos@@ ques .
I thought we should stay at home .
but something did not feel right .
because the people who attacked this country attacked our country .
I hit the terrorists &apos; fur@@ y against the terrorists .
imagine ! I was angry .
it is not easy to constantly explain itself .
&quot; I have nothing against questions , I love questions . &quot;
they are the accus@@ ations that are hard .
nowadays we can actually say people say : &quot; there is a problem in this country -- it is Muslims .
when will we go ? &quot;
some people want to ban@@ ish Muslims and join Mos@@ ques .
they speak of my church like a tumor in the USA &apos;s body .
only the question arises : are we mal@@ ign@@ ant or ben@@ ign ?
they know : a mal@@ ign@@ ant tumor is removed as a whole and a ben@@ ign tumour is only observed under observation .
the alternatives are point@@ less because the question is wrong .
&quot; Muslims are like all other Americans , no tumor in the body of the US , but a vital organ . &quot;
thanks !
&quot; Muslims are invent@@ ors and teachers , sth@@ and and Olymp@@ ism . &quot;
will the closure of mos@@ ques America safer ?
maybe a few parking spaces will be fre@@ ed but not stop the terror .
&quot; the regular visit of a mos@@ que leads to consider people other fai@@ ths more toler@@ ant , and to show greater ci@@ vic participation . &quot;
&quot; and as a leader of the police in Washington , DC recently told : people are actually not radic@@ alised in mos@@ ques . &quot;
they are radic@@ alised in their cellar or in bed in front of a computer .
&quot; in the radic@@ alization process , one has found that it starts online . first , the person is cut off from their church , even from their family , so that the person thinks that the person thinks that the terrorists are the true Muslims , and everyone who abh@@ ors their behavior and ideology is a tra@@ itor or of faith . &quot;
&quot; if we want to prevent radic@@ alization , we must stop the people to go to the mos@@ que . &quot;
some will still claim that Islam is a violent religion .
&quot; finally , a group like the IS establishes their brut@@ ality with the Qur &apos;@@ an . &quot;
&quot; as Muslims , as a mother , as a person , I believe that we must do everything to stop a group like the IS . &quot;
but we would add to their imagination to recognize them as representatives of 1.6 billion believers .
thanks !
the IS has so much to do with Islam as the K@@ u @-@ K@@ lux @-@ Kl@@ an with Christianity .
both groups claim their ideology on their &quot; holy book . &quot;
&quot; but when you take a look at them , it doesn &apos;t matter what they read in their &quot; Sacred Scripture . &quot; &quot;
it is their brut@@ ality that lets them read these things into Scripture .
an outstanding Ima@@ m recently told me an amazing story :
a girl came to him because she preferred to join the IS .
I was really surprised and asked him if they had been in contact with radical religious leaders .
&quot; he said that the problem was exactly the opposite . every cl@@ ergy with whom she spoke , brought her to silence , and told her that her anger , her sense of injus@@ tice in the world , would only bring it into trouble . &quot;
&quot; inspired by nothing and something that had given meaning to their fur@@ y , it was a main objective for the instrument@@ alization of extre@@ mi@@ sts that promised her a solution . &quot;
this Ima@@ m returned to God and to her church .
&quot; instead of acc@@ using them for their rage , he showed their constructive ways for real change in the world . &quot;
&quot; what they learned in the mos@@ que , they for@@ bid them to join the IS . &quot;
this was an insight into how the Islam@@ opho@@ bia concerns me and my family .
but how does it affect ordinary Americans ?
how does it affect everyone else ?
how does the 24 @-@ hour consumption of fear affect our democracy every day ?
one study -- actually several neuro@@ scientific studies -- show : if we fear us pass at least three things .
&quot; we rather accept an author@@ it@@ arian government system , conformity and pre@@ judi@@ ces . &quot;
&quot; a study shows : when one reports messages in which negative about Muslims were reported , they were rather military attacks on Muslim countries as well as the circum@@ c@@ ision of the rights of American Muslims . &quot;
this is not just an academic problem .
&quot; if you look at when the mood against Muslims was shot up -- between 2001 and 2013 -- then this happened three times , but never in connection with terrorist attacks . &quot;
it happened in the run @-@ up of Iraq war and during two elec@@ toral periods .
&quot; so Islam@@ opho@@ bia is not simply the natural reaction to Muslim terror , as I expected . &quot;
it can actually be a tool to manipul@@ ate the public in order to pol@@ lu@@ te the foundation of a free society that has reasonable and well informed citizens .
the handling of Muslims is an early warning sign .
we may feel it first but the toxic air of fear destro@@ ys us all .
the assignment of coll@@ ec@@ tivi@@ es is not only about having to explain themselves .
&quot; De@@ ah and his wife Y@@ us@@ or were a young , married couple living in Chapel Hill , North Carolina , where both went to school . &quot;
De@@ ah was an ath@@ l@@ ete .
&quot; he was talented at the dental faculty , talented , promising ... &quot;
&quot; his sister would say to me that he was the most sweet@@ est , generous person she knew . &quot;
she visited him there and he showed her his CV . she was amazed and said :
&quot; when was such a young man from my brother ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; just a few weeks after the visit of Su@@ z@@ anne with her brother and wife , her neigh@@ bor , Cra@@ ig Stephen H@@ icks , she was murdered , just like the sister of Y@@ us@@ or , Raz@@ an that was in the afternoon when he posted remarks against Muslims on his Facebook page . &quot;
he shot eight times on De@@ ah .
fan@@ ati@@ cism can not only be im@@ moral but also fatal .
so back to the beginning .
what happened after 9 / 11 ?
did we go to the mos@@ que or were we safe at home ?
&quot; we discussed it and for us it was no easy decision , because it was about which America we want to leave our children : one that would control us through fear , or one in which we can exercise our religion freely . &quot;
we decided for the mos@@ que .
&quot; with our son in the child seat , we sail@@ ed sil@@ ently , with high pressure to the mos@@ que . &quot;
&quot; I took him out , with@@ drew my shoes , went into the building hall , and what I saw was left . &quot;
the hall was completely filled .
&quot; then the Ima@@ m made an announcement , thank@@ ed and welcomed our guests , because half of the meetings were Christians , Jews , Budd@@ hi@@ sts , a@@ thei@@ sts , believers and non @-@ believers who came not to attack us , but to assist us . &quot;
&quot; at that moment , I am collap@@ sed . &quot;
these people were there because they had had courage and compassion for panic and pre@@ judi@@ ces .
what will you choose ?
what will you choose at the moment of fear and fan@@ ati@@ cism ?
will you be sure to be sure ?
or will you join those who think : we are better than those .
thank you .
thank you very much !
&quot; Helen Wal@@ ters : so , D@@ alia , you seem to have hit a nerve . &quot;
&quot; but I wonder what do you say to those who might say that you are holding a TE@@ D@@ Talk , a think tank with dr@@ au@@ ght , work in a class@@ y think factory , so an exception and not the rule . &quot;
what would you say to those people ?
&quot; D@@ alia Mog@@ ah@@ ed : I would say , don &apos;t fool you . I am completely normal . &quot;
I am not an exception .
my story is not unusual .
I &apos;m as usual as it is allowed .
&quot; when one looks at Muslims around the world , and I did this with the greatest ever study of Muslims around the world , people want normal things . &quot;
&quot; they want prosperity for the family , they want work and they want to live in peace . &quot;
so I am no exception in any respect .
&quot; if people like an exception to rule appear , then often the rule has been broken , and they are not the exception to the rule . &quot;
HW : thank you . D@@ alia Mog@@ ah@@ ed .
&quot; as a platform for handic@@ raft , it is about to become a multi @-@ billion dollar business . &quot;
&quot; control , environmental monitoring , photography , film and journ@@ alism : these are some of the possible applications for commercial dr@@ ones . &quot;
&quot; before air pack@@ ets penet@@ rated into our social consciousness , an autonomous fleet of aircraft in the F@@ RAC Centre in France has built a six @-@ meter high tower from 1 500 bricks . some years ago , they began to fly with ropes . &quot;
&quot; by connecting , air@@ planes reach high speed and acceleration in confined spaces . &quot;
you can also build self @-@ winding structures .
they have learned to carry loads to deal with turbul@@ ences and generally react to natural laws .
today we would like to show you some of our new projects .
our aim is to cross the limits of the possible in autonomous flight .
&quot; in order that a system works autonom@@ ously , it must know coll@@ ectively , where the mobile objects are in space . &quot;
&quot; in our laboratory at ETH Zurich , we often use external cameras to find objects . this enables us to concentrate on the rapid development of dynamic tasks . &quot;
&quot; for today &apos;s demo@@ s we use a new loc@@ alization technology from Ver@@ ity Studios , a publisher of our laboratory . &quot;
there are no external cameras .
each air machine has internal sensors to determine the position in the room to determine what the machine should do .
&quot; external commands can be found on the highest level , e.g. &quot; Start &quot; and &quot; land . &quot; &quot;
this is a so @-@ called reco@@ il starter .
a flying device that tries to beat two flies with a fla@@ p .
&quot; like other star@@ ters , it is efficient in a forward flight , much more efficient than helicop@@ ters in all their variations . &quot;
&quot; in contrast to most star@@ ters , it can float , and has great advantages in starting and landing , and is very versatile . &quot;
&quot; however , there is always a swe@@ eping side . &quot;
a limitation of h@@ edge @-@ star@@ ters is that they react sensi@@ tively to turbul@@ ences like wind bu@@ cks .
we develop new controllers and algorithms to improve this .
the idea behind it is that the air@@ field doesn &apos;t matter in which position the optimum position can be recovered and the performance can be improved by practicing .
okay .
&quot; during our research , we often ask ourselves fundamental abstract questions which advance to the core of the matter . &quot;
such a question would be : what is the smallest possible number of movable parts for controlled flights ?
there are practical reasons for wanting to know the answer to such a question .
helicop@@ ters are known as machines with a thousand moving parts that meet together to hurt you .
&quot; decades ago , trained pilots were able to fly remote @-@ controlled aircraft flying only two movable parts : a prop@@ eller and a stern ru@@ dder . &quot;
&quot; recently , we discovered that flies with just one works . &quot;
&quot; this is the mon@@ osp@@ inner , the mechan@@ ically remote @-@ operated flight unit . it was invented in short . &quot;
&quot; it has only a movable part , a prop@@ eller , &quot;
&quot; no fl@@ aps , hing@@ es and cross @-@ ru@@ dder , no further actuators or control surfaces , only one prop@@ eller . &quot;
&quot; although it is mechan@@ ically simple , inside life happens very much so that it can fly stable and move around in the room . &quot;
&quot; however , it does not have the elegant algorithm of the stern @-@ star@@ ters . to get it to fly , I have to throw it right . &quot;
&quot; the lik@@ el@@ ihood of throwing it right is small , so I &apos;ll show you a video that was fil@@ med yesterday evening . &quot;
&quot; if the mon@@ osp@@ inner is an exercise in pleasure , this machine is here , the Omni@@ head with its eight prop@@ ellers , an exercise in abundance . &quot;
what to do with all this abundance ?
they see that it is only symm@@ etrical .
that is why it is ambi@@ valent in its alignment .
&quot; by doing so , he receives the exceptional ability , &quot;
&quot; move in the room in all directions , no matter which direction it is rot@@ ated or even how it rot@@ ates . &quot;
&quot; of course , it is complex , mainly in the area of interactive rivers of the eight prop@@ ellers . &quot;
&quot; some can be seen in models , the rest is learned directly by flying . &quot;
let &apos;s see that .
&quot; if flying machines are to be part of our everyday life , they must be extremely safe and reliable . &quot;
this machine is made up of two separate two prop@@ ellers aircraft .
this turns in c@@ lock@@ wise direction
and the other against c@@ lock@@ wise .
&quot; when you build them together , they behave like a high @-@ performance quad@@ ro@@ cop@@ ter . &quot;
&quot; however , something wrong -- a motor or prop@@ eller drops off , the electronics or a battery -- can fly the machine further , even if restricted . &quot;
we will now demonstrate that by making one half air@@ worthy .
the last demonstration examined synthetic s@@ war@@ ms .
&quot; the large number of autonomous , coordinated units allows a range of aesthetic expression . &quot;
we took commerci@@ ally available micro @-@ quad@@ cop@@ ter -- each single weighs less than a sli@@ ce of bread -- and equi@@ p it with loc@@ alization technology and algorithms .
every unit knows where in the room it is and is self @-@ controlled . therefore there is no upper limit .
hopefully these demonstrations motiv@@ ate you to think about new revolutionary ideas .
the particularly safe machine da dr@@ ags wants to become a flying lamp@@ shade on Broadway .
&quot; of course , it is difficult to predic@@ t the influence of this technology . &quot;
for types like us is the reward in the development and the act of creation .
&quot; it serves as a reminder , how wonderful and enchanting our universe is , and that it allows creative , clever creatures to form them in such a spectacular way . &quot;
the fact that this technology has such massive commercial and economic potential is the icing on the i .
thank you .
&quot; 1.3 billion years ago , two black holes cir@@ cl@@ ed each other in a very far distant galax@@ y , they turned so the mass of three Suns in a tenth of a second in pure energy . &quot;
&quot; for this short moment , they lit bri@@ ghter than all stars together in all galax@@ ies of the whole of us known universe . &quot;
it was a very big b@@ ang .
but they did not set up their energy in the form of light --
we finally speak of black holes .
the entire energy was released into the space @-@ time structure itself and the universe explo@@ ded in gra@@ vit@@ ational waves .
let us arrange the events for the first time .
&quot; more than 1.3 billion years ago , multi @-@ cell life on Earth was created . &quot;
&quot; since then , the Earth has produced a lot : cor@@ als , fish , plants , din@@ osau@@ rs , people and -- God stands for us -- even the internet . &quot;
&quot; about 25 years ago , a group decided particularly cour@@ age@@ ous -- R@@ ai Weiss from MIT , Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne and Ron@@ ald Dre@@ ver from Cal@@ tech -- to search for gra@@ vit@@ ational waves , which are caused by col@@ li@@ ding black holes . &quot;
most of them kept them crazy .
&quot; but enough people recognized them as crazy geni@@ uses , so that the US National Science Foundation funded their idea . &quot;
&quot; after decades of development , design , design and extremely hard work , they built the detector Lig@@ o : the laser Inter@@ fer@@ omet@@ er- Gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ Ob@@ servatory . &quot;
&quot; in the following period , the precision of Lig@@ o could significantly increase what the recognition performance improved enor@@ mously . &quot;
&quot; therefore , it is now called Advanced Lig@@ o . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of September 2015 , Lig@@ o was launched for a last test run to clarify some minor , stu@@ b@@ born problems . &quot;
&quot; on 14 September 2015 , only a few days after the detection of the detector , the gra@@ vit@@ ational waves of the two col@@ li@@ ding black holes sc@@ aled through the earth . &quot;
they went through you and me
and also through the detector .
Scott Hu@@ gh@@ es : only two moments in my life were more emotional than this :
the birth of my daughter
and the f@@ are@@ well from my death @-@ sick father .
&quot; basically , these were the fruits of my life @-@ work . &quot;
&quot; AA : this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hu@@ gh@@ es , theoretical physi@@ c@@ ist at MIT . he has been investigating gra@@ vit@@ ational waves from black holes and her by observ@@ atories like lig@@ o meas@@ urable signals . but what are gra@@ vit@@ ational waves ? &quot;
a gra@@ vit@@ ational wave is a cr@@ ack in the structure of space and time .
&quot; when passing the shaft , the room and its entire contents are stretched in one direction and the other is st@@ ened . &quot;
&quot; for illustration , lec@@ turers in courses for rel@@ ativity often perform a properly al@@ ber@@ ing dance . &quot;
&quot; stretch and dust , stretch and dust . &quot;
&quot; the problem is that gra@@ vit@@ ational waves are extremely weak , even ridi@@ cul@@ ous . &quot;
&quot; on the 14th of September , for example , each of us was stretched and st@@ ened by us during the meeting of the waves . the el@@ ong@@ ation of an average man was 10 high -@@ 21 . &quot;
&quot; that means 20 zer@@ os after the comm@@ a , followed by 1 . &quot;
&quot; with a five kilometer long laser detector , and that is absurd , this length would have to be measured in less than a thous@@ and@@ th of the radius of a nuclear nucle@@ us . this is gr@@ ot@@ esque . &quot;
at the end of his classic text about grav@@ itation
&quot; Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne , a co @-@ founder of Lig@@ os , described the hunt for the waves as follows : &quot; the technical difficulties in building such det@@ ectors are enormous . &quot;
but physi@@ cists are in@@ ventive and with the support of the public will certainly overcome all obstacles . &quot;
&quot; Thor@@ ne published this 1973 , 42 years before his success . &quot;
back to Lig@@ o . Scott likes to claim that Lig@@ o is more an ear than an eye .
I want to explain what this means .
&quot; visible light has a wavel@@ ength , which is much smaller than things around us : facial features , the size of your cell . &quot;
this is quite practical . because so you can make a picture or a map of things by percei@@ ving the light coming from several points around you .
&quot; in the case of sounds , this is different . &quot;
audi@@ ble sounds have a wavel@@ ength of up to 15 meters .
&quot; that &apos;s why it is very difficult , actually impossible to produce a picture of things that mean a lot to you : &quot;
about the face of your child .
&quot; instead we listen to certain properties such as pitch and height , rhythm and volume to close the story behind it . &quot;
&quot; now is talking about Alice . &quot;
&quot; and Bob inter@@ rup@@ ts them . &quot;
&quot; sho@@ oter Bob . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the same applies to gra@@ vit@@ ational waves .
we cannot produce any simple images of objects in space with them .
&quot; but considering changes in the ampl@@ itude and frequency of the waves , we can listen to their stories . &quot;
at least for Lig@@ o the measured frequencies are in the audi@@ ble area .
&quot; so if we convert wave pattern in sound , we can literally hear the all literally . &quot;
&quot; to listen to the gravity , about the coll@@ ision of two black holes can tell us about the coll@@ ision of two black holes , which my colleague Scott has been busy for a long time . &quot;
&quot; SH : two black , non @-@ rotating holes , just run : w@@ up@@ p ! &quot;
&quot; turning the two bodies very fast , one h@@ ears the same pen with an additional sound change . that sounds like this : W@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u ! &quot;
it is a kind of movement vocabulary that shapes the wav@@ e@@ form .
&quot; AA : on September 14 , 2015 -- a date that at least I will never forget -- heard Lig@@ o : &#91; Sur@@ render &#93; No@@ body , who knows what to hear , this recognizes as a sound of -- SH : ... two black holes with 30 @-@ fold sun mass , which turn around as quickly as the rods of your mixer . &quot;
AA : let &apos;s think about what this means .
&quot; two black holes , the dens@@ est body in the universe , one with a mass of 29 Suns , the other with a mass of 36 s@@ uns , or@@ bit@@ ing a hundred times a second before they col@@ li@@ de . &quot;
imagine these forces .
fantastic .
and we know of it because we heard it .
there is the ab@@ iding significance of Lig@@ o .
Lig@@ o p@@ aves a completely new way to explore the universe as it was never possible before .
on this way we can listen to the universe and hear the invisible .
much in all we can -- practically or basically -- not see .
&quot; a super@@ nova , for example . I would like to know why m@@ asser@@ ie stars explo@@ de in super@@ nov@@ ae . &quot;
they are very useful . of them we have learned a lot about the universe .
&quot; however , the exciting physical processes happen in the core , which lies behind thousands of kilometres of iron , carbon and silicon . &quot;
we will never go through because these op@@ ak are .
&quot; gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves penet@@ rate iron , as if it were transparent glass . &quot;
&quot; using gra@@ vit@@ ational waves , it should be possible to look back to the beginning . &quot;
&quot; the most important thing : I am optim@@ istic that in all things we have never seen , which we will never see and of which we have no idea . things we only discover by listening . &quot;
&quot; in fact , Lig@@ o found things that we did not expect . &quot;
&quot; my colleague at MIT , Matt Ev@@ ans , an important member of the Lig@@ o project , says : me : the kind of stars that produce black holes , such as Lig@@ o they are watching are the din@@ osau@@ rs of the universe . &quot;
&quot; they are enormous , ancient bodies of pre@@ historic times . the black holes are the Sau@@ ri@@ erk@@ no@@ chen for our archaeological work so to speak . &quot;
&quot; Lig@@ o makes us a completely different angle on the events in space , to the emergence of the stars and ultimately on how we emerged from this chaos . &quot;
AA : the challenge now is to be as cour@@ age@@ ous as possible .
&quot; thanks to Lig@@ o , we know how to build great det@@ ectors and listen to the noise and circulation of the cos@@ mos . &quot;
we need ideas for new observ@@ atories -- a new generation of observ@@ atories on Earth and in space .
for what could be more beautiful than to listen to the Big Bang ?
now is the time of great dreams .
dream with us .
thanks .
some time ago I tried out an experiment .
&quot; for a year I would say to all &quot; &quot; Yes ! &quot; &quot; before I feared . &quot;
&quot; whether it made me nervous , brought me into unpleasant situations , I forced me to say &quot; Yes . &quot; &quot;
did I want to talk to the public ?
&quot; no , but yes ! &quot;
did I want to be live on TV ?
&quot; no , but yes ! &quot;
did I want to start playing with the show ?
&quot; no , no , no , yes , yes , yes . &quot;
&quot; and a crazy thing happened : exactly what I feared , my fear removed . &quot;
&quot; my fear to keep talking , my social anxiety -- pu@@ ff , away . &quot;
the power of a word is impressive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; yes &quot; &quot; has changed my life . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; yes &quot; &quot; changed me . &quot;
&quot; but there was a certain yes , which changed my life deeply , on an un@@ expect@@ edly kind . it began with a question of my little ones . &quot;
&quot; I have three incredible daughters , har@@ per , Beck@@ ett , and Emer@@ son . and Emer@@ son , the youngest , called all &quot; estim@@ ations , &quot; of in@@ explic@@ able reasons . &quot;
as if it were a wa@@ it@@ ress from the south .
&quot; guess , I need milk for my be@@ ak al@@ ley . &quot;
&quot; she asked me once , if I could play with her when I was on the go . and I said , &quot; Yes . &quot; &quot;
this Yes was the beginning
&quot; from there , I always swe@@ ars to play with them as soon as you ask me . no matter what I do , or where I go , I always say yes -- every single time . &quot;
&quot; almost . I &apos;m not perfect , but I am very tired . &quot;
&quot; it has a magical effect on me , my children , on our family . &quot;
&quot; but it also has an amazing side effect : only recently I understood fully that the &quot; &quot; yes &quot; &quot; say to play with my children my career . &quot;
I have a real dream job .
&quot; I am a author . I think things , aw@@ aken you to life . &quot;
dream job .
&quot; Hallo , &quot;
I am a titanium .
dream job .
I create television . I produce television .
&quot; I do television , in a great style . &quot;
in this TV season I am responsible for bringing about 70 hours of program into the world .
&quot; four TV programs , 70 hours of television . three to four shows are simultaneously in production . &quot;
each shipment contains hundreds of jobs that did not exist before .
the budget for an episode of a TV channel can be between three and six million dollars .
let &apos;s say five .
&quot; a new episode every nine days of four shows , so all nine days 20 million dollar television , four TV programs , 70 hours TV , three broad@@ casts , which simultaneously in production are four , 16 epis@@ odes : how To Get A@@ way With Mur@@ der , 10 epis@@ odes : the Cat@@ ch , 70 hours of TV , &quot;
350 million dollars for a season .
&quot; in America , my TV series run on Thursday evening . &quot;
&quot; all over the world , my series runs in 256 regions in 67 languages for 30 million viewers . &quot;
&quot; my brain is global , and 45 of these 70 TV @-@ hours are broad@@ casts that I created myself and not only produced , so still on top . I have to find time , really quiet , creative time to gather my fans around the camp fire and tell my stories . &quot;
&quot; four TV series , 70 hours television , three , sometimes four , shows at the same time in production , 350 million dollars , camp@@ fire around the world . &quot;
do you know who is still doing it ?
&quot; no one , therefore I am a titanium . &quot;
dream job .
I would not like to impress you .
&quot; I say it because I know what you think if the word &quot; &quot; author &quot; &quot; falls . &quot;
&quot; I tell you that all of you who work so hard whether you are now a company , a country or a classroom , a business or a household , take me seriously when I say : I understand that in a dream job it &apos;s not about dreams . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s all a job , all work , all reality , all blood , all sweat -- no tears . &quot;
&quot; I work much , hard and I love it . &quot;
&quot; if I &apos;m deep@@ ened in the work , there is no other feeling . &quot;
my work always creates a country out of nothing .
&quot; it is , when I set up troops , as I painted on a canvas . &quot;
&quot; as if you dream a high sound , I deliver a marathon . &quot;
you feel like Be@@ y@@ onc@@ é .
and all that at the same time .
I love to work .
&quot; it is creative , mechan@@ ically , exhau@@ sting and in@@ toxic@@ ating , funny and distur@@ bing , clin@@ ically and fool@@ ish , cruel and sensible . and the best thing about it is the sum . &quot;
there is such a change in me when working well .
&quot; a bu@@ zz starts in my head , and it grows and grows , and the bu@@ zz sounds like a busy street , I could go for it forever . &quot;
&quot; many people assume that when I declare to them the sum , that I am persu@@ aded to write to me that writing is a pleasure . &quot;
&quot; don &apos;t you understand me wrong , this does them . &quot;
&quot; but the sums -- when I began to work and to work and work , create , create and collaborate , I discovered this matter , this bu@@ zz , this energy . &quot;
the sum is more than writing .
the sum is action and activity . the sum is a drug .
the sum is music . the sum is light and air .
the sum is God &apos;s voice in my ear .
&quot; and if you have such a sum , then you cannot asp@@ ire to the size . &quot;
&quot; the feeling of being not different than to strive for size , no matter what price . &quot;
this is called the sum .
or maybe it also means to be a work@@ ah@@ olic .
maybe it &apos;s called geni@@ us .
maybe it is ego .
perhaps it is the fear of failure .
I don &apos;t know .
&quot; I only know that I am not made for failure , and I only know that I love the sum . &quot;
&quot; I just want to tell you , I &apos;m a titanium , and I know I don &apos;t want to ask it . &quot;
&quot; the more successful I will , the more broad@@ casts , the more epis@@ odes , the more work there is , the more work there , the more I write history , the more expectations there is . &quot;
&quot; the more I work to be successful , the more I have to work . &quot;
and what did I say about work ?
&quot; I love work , isn &apos;t it ? &quot;
&quot; the land that I create , the marathon that I run , the army , the linen , the high sound , the sums , the sums , the sums . &quot;
I like this sum . I love the sum .
I need the sums . I am the sum .
am I just this sum ?
and then the sums stopped .
&quot; over@@ hau@@ led , over@@ loaded , over@@ hau@@ led . &quot;
the sums stopped .
now my three daughters are acc@@ u@@ stom@@ ed to the truth that her m@@ um is just a single work .
&quot; Har@@ per tells people : &quot; my m@@ um will not be there , but you can write my N@@ anny . &quot;
&quot; Emer@@ son says : &quot; &quot; guess , I want to go to Sh@@ on@@ da . &quot;
they are the children of a Tit@@ ans .
they are baby ti@@ ters .
&quot; they were 12 , 3 and 1 when the sums stopped . &quot;
the bu@@ zz of the engine was silent .
I didn &apos;t love my job anymore . the engine was off .
the sum did not come back .
my sw@@ amp was broken .
&quot; I made the same things as ever : the same Tit@@ ans work , 15 hours @-@ days , pen@@ etr@@ able weekends , no regret , nothing deleg@@ ate , a titanium sleeps , does not exist , with full heart , clear eyes , whatever . &quot;
but there was no sum .
there was silence in me .
&quot; four TV programs , 70 hours , three productions at the same time , sometimes four . &quot;
&quot; four TV programs , 70 hours , three productions simultaneously ... &quot;
I was the perfect Titan .
&quot; I was a preview Titan , &quot;
&quot; everything was gray , I just had no fun anymore . &quot;
and that was my life .
everything I did .
I was the sum and the sum I was .
&quot; so what do you do , if that &apos;s what you do , the work you love , suddenly f@@ aded ? &quot;
&quot; I know some may think : &quot; heu@@ l dich , stupid author @-@ titanium . &quot;
&quot; but you know you do it , you do it , you work , you love to be a teacher , a ban@@ ker , a mother , a painter , Bill Gates , one loves just another and that gives a sum if you know the sum , if you stop the sum , who is you then ? &quot;
what are you ?
what am I ?
am I still a Titan ?
&quot; when the song of my heart stops , I can survive in silence ? &quot;
and then my &quot; southern states wa@@ it@@ ress &quot; poses a question .
&quot; I &apos;m on the way out , late , and she says , &quot; &quot; Mama , do you play ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I want to say no more than to be aware of two things :
&quot; first , I have to say yes to everything and secondly , she didn &apos;t call me &quot; guess . &quot; &quot;
&quot; they call no more &quot; &quot; guess &quot; . &quot; &quot;
when is that happening ?
&quot; I miss it when I &apos;m Titan and my bu@@ zz@@ ing , and here everything changes in front of my own eyes . &quot;
&quot; and so she says , &quot; &quot; Mama , do you play ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; and I say , &quot; Yes . &quot; &quot;
there is nothing special about it .
&quot; we play and her sisters come across , we laugh a lot and I read quite dramatically from the book &quot; Every@@ body Po@@ ops . &quot; &quot;
nothing extraordinary .
&quot; but it is outstanding because my pain and panic , in sol@@ itude and absence of sums , I can do nothing but fit out . &quot;
I am focused .
I am quiet .
&quot; the land I create , the marathon that I run , the army , the screen , the high sound - they no longer exist . &quot;
&quot; everything that exists are sti@@ cky fingers and mo@@ ist kis@@ ses , delicate voices , wax cra@@ y@@ ons and the song in which it comes to releasing , or whatever the girl in &quot; Die Eis@@ könig@@ in . &quot; &quot;
peace and simplicity is everywhere .
the air in this place is so scar@@ ce that I can hardly breathe .
I can hardly believe that I breathe .
playing is the opposite of works .
and I am happy .
something in me dis@@ sol@@ ves .
a mental door opens and an energy stroke comes in .
&quot; and that &apos;s not immediately , but it happens it happened . &quot;
I feel it .
the sum comes slowly .
&quot; no full volume , hardly there , it &apos;s quiet , hardly audi@@ ble , but it &apos;s there . &quot;
&quot; not the sum , but a sum . &quot;
and now I feel like I would know a magical mystery .
but let &apos;s stay with the matter .
it is love . that &apos;s all .
no magic . no secret . just love .
it is something we have forgotten .
&quot; the sum , the working sums , the titanium dioxide , this is only the replacement . &quot;
&quot; if I ask you who you are , if I tell you who I am when I describe myself by means of shows and TV @-@ hours and how functional my brain is , then I forgot what the real sum is . &quot;
the sum is not a force and it is not labour @-@ specific .
it depends on the joy .
the real sum depends on love .
the sum is the current that comes from the li@@ vel@@ ihood .
the real sum is self @-@ confidence and peace .
&quot; the real sum ignor@@ es the pressure of history , the tasks to be done , the expectation and the pressure . &quot;
the real sum is simple and original .
&quot; the real sum is God &apos;s voice in my ear , but perhaps God whis@@ per@@ ed to me the wrong words , for which God told me that I am a titanium ? &quot;
it is just love .
&quot; we all need a little more love , much more love . &quot;
&quot; once my child wants to play with me , I will say yes . &quot;
&quot; I do this as a rule , so that I can free myself from any gu@@ ilt as a work@@ ah@@ olic . &quot;
&quot; it is law , I have no choice . I have no choice unless I want to hear the sum again . &quot;
&quot; I wish it would be so easy . I &apos;m not good in playing , I don &apos;t like it . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t think about how to work , how to work . &quot;
&quot; the truth hur@@ ts , &quot;
but I don &apos;t like to play it .
I always work because I love it .
I prefer at work than at home .
&quot; this conc@@ ession is painful , because what a man is working rather than to be home ? &quot;
&quot; well , I . &quot;
&quot; hon@@ estly , I call myself &quot; Titan &quot; -- &quot;
I have to have problems .
that I am too relaxed is none of it .
&quot; we rus@@ hed around in the garden , before and back , back and forth . &quot;
&quot; we make small dance parties , &quot;
we sing and play ball .
we burst soap bub@@ bles .
&quot; I feel mostly sti@@ ff , ab@@ sent and confused . &quot;
I always get ready for my mobile phone .
but it is OK .
&quot; my children show me how to live , and the sum of the universe fills me . &quot;
I play and play until I ask myself : why have we ever stopped playing with playing ?
you can also ! do they always say yes if your child wants to play with you .
&quot; maybe you think me na@@ ï@@ ve , for a day@@ dream . &quot;
&quot; you probably have right , but you can do it too ! &quot;
you have time !
and do you know why ? they are not R@@ ih@@ anna or a Mu@@ pp@@ et show figure .
your child finds you less interesting than you think .
there are only 15 minutes .
&quot; my little ones want to play with me at a maximum of 15 minutes , until they choose to do something else . &quot;
&quot; it is wonderful 15 minutes , but just 15 minutes . &quot;
after 15 minutes a lad@@ y@@ bird or bis@@ cuit replaces me .
and talk to me my te@@ ens daughter for 15 minutes with me . am I mother of the year .
&quot; there are only 15 minutes , more do not need . &quot;
everyone can pick up 15 minutes at the track - even at a bad mood day !
15 minutes at the play !
&quot; no mobile phone , no laundry , no defl@@ ection . &quot;
the day is short : dinner to make the kids bed ready .
but 15 minutes are inside !
&quot; my children are my well @-@ being , my world . they don &apos;t have to be the children . &quot;
it &apos;s not about playing with your own children . it &apos;s about pleasure .
&quot; in order to &quot; &quot; play &quot; &quot; in general . &quot;
treat yourself to the 15 minutes !
find out what you do well .
find it out and keep it .
&quot; I am not perfect in it . I fail and I si@@ ege . meet friends , read books , enjoy the day -- &quot;
&quot; want to play ? &quot; is short for everything I gave up when I got my first TV show when I was a Titan in training , when I wanted to sur@@ pass myself more and more . &quot;
15 minutes at the track why not take full 15 minutes ?
what can be wrong about it ? nothing !
the sums came back in my spare time . the sums seem to return when I don &apos;t work .
work does not work without games .
&quot; it takes time , but after a few months a door opens , the energy flows in and I find myself in my office . I listen to new ideas . I use it in full trains and love my work again . &quot;
&quot; I like the sum , but I don &apos;t love it . &quot;
I don &apos;t need it .
&quot; I am not the sum , the sum is not me ... no more . &quot;
&quot; soap bub@@ bles and sti@@ cky fingers , dinner with friends . &quot;
this is my sum .
the bu@@ zz of life .
the sums of love .
&quot; the sums of work are part of me , but just a part . and I am so grateful . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s nice to me that I &apos;m a titanium . I &apos;ve never seen a titanium , the trip to Jerusalem . &quot;
I said yes to less work and more games .
and yet I have everything under control . my brain is still functional . my camp@@ fire is still burning .
&quot; the more I play , the happ@@ ier I and my children . &quot;
&quot; the more I play , the more I feel as a good mother . &quot;
&quot; the more I play , the clear@@ er my head . &quot;
&quot; the more I play , the better I work . &quot;
&quot; the more I play , the more I hear the sum . &quot;
&quot; the more I feel this bu@@ zz , the more this unusual , remaining , naked and new feeling of living in me wide . less titanium -- more I ! &quot;
&quot; the more I feel exactly this sum , the more I know who I am . &quot;
&quot; I am a author . I think things out , I wake up to life . &quot;
&quot; this is part of the job , which means living his dream . &quot;
&quot; this is the dream of this job , &quot;
for a dream job should be a little dre@@ amy .
I said &apos; Yes &apos; to less work and more games .
Tit@@ ans have no chance here .
&quot; do you want to play ? &quot;
thank you very much .
I am Neuro@@ surgical .
like most of my colleagues I have to do every day with human trage@@ dies .
&quot; I know how your life can change from one second to another , after a severe stroke or after a car accident . &quot;
&quot; for us neuro@@ sur@@ ge@@ ons it is very fru@@ str@@ ating that the brain , unlike other body organs , has a very low ability to self @-@ healing . &quot;
&quot; after a serious injury to the central nervous system , patients often have a permanent disability . &quot;
this is probably the reason why I became functional neuro@@ surgery .
what is a functional neuro@@ sur@@ geon ?
a doctor trying to improve the nerve functions by various surgical measures .
&quot; they certainly have heard of one of the best known , &quot; deep @-@ brain stimulation . &quot; this impl@@ anti@@ fies an electro@@ de deep in the brain to influence the circuits of neur@@ ons so that the neurolog@@ ical function has been improved . &quot;
it really is an amazing technology . it has improved the fate of patients with Park@@ inson which suffered severe trem@@ bling and severe pain .
&quot; however , neuro@@ mod@@ ulation does not mean ne@@ uro healing . &quot;
the dream of functional neuro@@ sur@@ ge@@ ons is the recovery of the brain .
in my opinion we approach this dream .
I want to show you that we are very close to it .
with some help the brain can help itself .
history began 15 years ago .
at the time I was a senior doctor and worked day and night in the emergency room .
I often supplied patients with skull @-@ brain trau@@ ma .
you have to imagine that at the skull @-@ brain trau@@ ma the brain sw@@ ells and the cran@@ ial pressure increases .
&quot; to save life , it is necessary to reduce the pressure of the skull . &quot;
sometimes you have to remove a part of s@@ wollen brain mass .
&quot; instead of throwing away the s@@ wollen brain mass , we decided to analyse the brain mass with Jean @-@ François Brun@@ et , one of my colleagues , a bi@@ ologist . &quot;
what do I mean by this ?
we wanted to let cells grow out of this tissue .
this is not an easy task .
&quot; to grow cells from a tissue , is comparable to very small children that are taken out of your families . &quot;
&quot; you have to find the right diet , temperature , moisture and the surroundings to make it thri@@ ve . &quot;
that was exactly what we had to do with these cells .
&quot; after many attempts , it made Jean @-@ François . &quot;
he saw this under his micro@@ scope .
that was a big surprise for us .
why ?
&quot; it looked exactly like a stem cell culture . with large green cells , surrounded by small , un@@ ripe cells . &quot;
&quot; you may still know from the teaching of biology , that stem cells are un@@ ripe cells that can turn into every cell type of the organism . &quot;
&quot; the adult brain has stem cells , but very few . they are hidden in deep , small ni@@ ches of the brain . &quot;
it is surprising to receive this kind of stem cells from the surface tissue of brain mass in the surgery .
we made another fascinating observation : normal stem cells are very active -- they share very quickly .
they never die ; they are immort@@ al .
but these cells beha@@ ved differently .
they shared slowly and after a few weeks they even died .
&quot; so we saw a new , strange cell population that looked like stem cells , but beha@@ ved differently . &quot;
we needed a long time to understand where they came from .
they come from these cells .
these blue and red cells are called dou@@ bl@@ ec@@ or@@ tin @-@ positive cells .
we all have them in our brain .
they make 4 % of our brain @-@ brain cells .
they play a very important role in our development .
at the stage of the fet@@ us they provide for the folding of the brain .
but why are they left us ?
we do not know this .
we believe that they participate in the healing of the brain as we find them close to brain injuries at higher concentrations .
but this is not so safe .
&quot; however , one thing is clear -- from these cells we received our stem cells . &quot;
&quot; we stand in front of a potential cell source , which enables brain healing . &quot;
we had to prove this .
so we decided to develop an experiment .
we wanted to remove a piece of brain mass from the non @-@ linguistic area and then cultivate the cells exactly as it did Jean @-@ François
and then mark them colour@@ fully to be able to track them in the brain .
&quot; in the last step , we pl@@ agu@@ ed them at the reception of the same individual . &quot;
we call the aut@@ olog@@ ous transplan@@ t -- Aut@@ ot@@ ran@@ splan@@ tation .
one of our first questions was : what happens when we mat@@ ing these cells into normal brain tissue ? and what will happen when we mat@@ ured the same cells in damaged brain tissue ?
&quot; thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rou@@ iller , we were able to work with apes . &quot;
&quot; in the first scenario we pl@@ agu@@ ed the cells into a healthy brain , and we observed that after a few weeks they were completely disappeared , they would go back home . the room is already occupied , they are not needed there , so they disappear . &quot;
in the second scenario we were able to hurt and irrit@@ ate exactly the same cells and now the cells were preserved -- they grew up to mature neur@@ ons .
here you see what we could observe under the micro@@ scope .
these are the cells that were mat@@ ured .
&quot; the evidence they show are these little points . these are the cells , which we dy@@ ed in vitro , in culture . &quot;
&quot; of course , we could not stop here . &quot;
do these cells also help a monkey to recover from a brain injury ?
so we trained monkeys with a manual skill task .
they had to take feed p@@ ellets from one tablet .
they made them very good .
&quot; when they had reached a stable level of skill , we were injured in the motor @-@ motor cor@@ tex . &quot;
&quot; then the monkeys were paraly@@ zed , they couldn &apos;t move their hand anymore . &quot;
&quot; just as it would happen with people , they recovered spont@@ aneously to a certain degree , just like after a stroke . &quot;
&quot; patients are paraly@@ sed and then they try to recover with the help of plastic brain mechanisms . they recover to some degree , just as with the ape . &quot;
&quot; when we were certain that the monkey had reached its degree of spontaneous recovery , we im@@ planted his own cells . &quot;
on the left side they see the ape that recovered spont@@ aneously .
it can provide about 40 % to 50 % of its original performance from injury .
it is not so precise and not so fast .
&quot; now see when we mat@@ ured the cells : the same monkey , two months after the matur@@ ation . &quot;
I can tell you that these were also very exciting results .
since that time we have found a lot more about these cells .
we can fre@@ eze them and use them later .
&quot; we can use them in other neu@@ rop@@ ath@@ ological models , e.g. Park@@ inson &apos;s . &quot;
but our dream is still to im@@ planted them in humans .
I really hope that I can soon show you how the human brain gives us the means to heal itself .
thank you .
&quot; Bruno Gi@@ uss@@ ani : J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne , that &apos;s wonderful , I &apos;m sure that just now , several dozen people in the audience , maybe even the majority , think : &quot; I know someone who can do that . &quot;
I definitely .
&quot; of course , the question is what the biggest obstacles are before you can start clinical trials involving human beings . &quot;
&quot; J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne Blo@@ ch : the biggest obstacles are the authorities . starting from these fantastic results , one has to fill approximately two kilo@@ grams papers and forms to undergo this kind of studies . &quot;
&quot; BG : this is understandable , the brain is very delicate , etc . &quot;
&quot; J@@ B : yes , but it takes a long time , a lot of patience and an almost professional team . &quot;
&quot; BG : looking into the future -- you have completed research and tried to get the permission to start the clinical trials . if you continue to look into the future , how many years it takes until someone can come to hospital , and this therapy will be available . &quot;
J@@ B : it &apos;s hard to say .
&quot; first , it depends on the approval of the clinical trial . &quot;
will it allow us the authority to start it soon ?
then you have to carry out this study with a small group of patients .
&quot; it takes a long time to select the patient , perform the treatments and evaluate whether it is useful to make this kind of treatment . &quot;
&quot; after that , you have to apply it to a multi @-@ centric study . &quot;
you must first really prove that it is useful before you can offer this treatment to anyone .
&quot; BG : and that it is safe , of course . J@@ B : of course . &quot;
&quot; BG : J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne , thank you for visiting TE@@ D and that you told us about it . &quot;
BG : thank you .
democracy .
we in the West make a great mistake to consider them as a matter of course .
&quot; we do not see democracy as the fragile plant which it is in reality , but as an inventory of our society . &quot;
we tend to look at them as an imm@@ utable devot@@ ion .
we believe capitalism inevitably leads to democracy .
date : 06 / 13 / 2009
&quot; Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew from Singapore and his great after@@ math in Beijing proved without doubt that it is quite possible to have a flour@@ ishing capitalism and an impressive growth , while politics remains completely un@@ democratic . &quot;
&quot; in fact , democracy dis@@ appears with us , in Europe . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the year , when I represented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- was un@@ ambig@@ uous for me as a finance minister in the Euro@@ group -- that the democratic process of our country -- our elections -- not the austerity programs that have been realized in Greece . &quot;
&quot; at this moment , I thought that there could be no better justi@@ fication for Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew or the Communist Party of China , or some of my sincere friends who told me that democracy would be abol@@ ished if it would change anything . &quot;
&quot; at this point , I would like to introduce you an economic model for real democracy . &quot;
&quot; please , together with me , to believe that Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew , the Communist Party of China and even the Euro@@ group , we could save democracy , but that we need a true and def@@ ensive democracy . &quot;
&quot; for without democracy , our societies are in common , our future dark , and our great , new technologies are w@@ asted . &quot;
&quot; on the subject of waste , I would like to point out to an interesting contradiction , which is currently under threat to our economies . &quot;
I call it the &quot; twin tops par@@ ad@@ ox . &quot;
&quot; one summit is known to you . you know and recognize him as the debt mountain , which thro@@ ws its long shadow over the USA , Europe and the whole world . &quot;
&quot; we all know the debt mountain , &quot;
but only a few recognize his twin .
&quot; a mountain of un@@ used cash , which belongs to the wealthy as@@ parag@@ us and corporations , which could be fear@@ ful , where it would be productive and income that could produce the debt , for example &quot; green &quot; energy . &quot;
I call them two numbers .
&quot; over the past 3 months , 3.4 tril@@ lion US dollars were invested in the United States , England and the Eurozone , in all the wealth produced goods such as industrial plants , machinery , office buildings , schools , roads , tracks , equipment and so on . &quot;
&quot; 3.4 tril@@ lion US dollars sounds like a lot of money until you compare it with the 5,@@ 1 tril@@ lion US dollars that were at the same time in the same countries and our financial institutions , and absolutely nothing , except the stock exchanges to aw@@ aken and the real estate prices . &quot;
&quot; thus , debts and un@@ productive capital form the tw@@ ins that cannot be compens@@ ated by the usual market mechanisms . &quot;
&quot; the result is stagn@@ ating wages , more than a quarter of 25 @-@ 54 year olds in the United States , Japan and Europe , and consequently a low demand for the p@@ essi@@ mis@@ m of investors , which could be true that his son would kill him when he is growing , &quot;
&quot; un@@ inten@@ tionally causes the circumstances , which cause Ö@@ di@@ pus k@@ ills him . &quot;
this is my shar@@ pen with capitalism --
&quot; his very wast@@ eful article All the un@@ productive capital should be used to improve our lives , develop human talents , and to finance especially all the technologies , &quot; green &quot; technologies that are crucial for the salvation of the earth . &quot;
is democracy the solution ?
&quot; but before we continue , what do we mean under democracy ? &quot;
Arist@@ ot@@ le defined democracy as the form of society in which the free and the poor as a majority control the government .
&quot; of course , Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy included too many . &quot;
&quot; women , foreigners , and of course slaves . &quot;
&quot; however , it would be a mistake to reduce the significance of Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy on account of these exclu@@ sions . &quot;
&quot; the decisive thing about the ath@@ en@@ ical democracy was and is that they imposed the working poor , not only the right to freedom of expression , but more important and decisive , which they grant them the right to political participation with the same vocal weigh@@ ting in matters of state matters . &quot;
&quot; indeed , Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy has not been held long ago -- &quot;
&quot; like a candle , which g@@ lows very bright , it is also quickly burnt out . &quot;
&quot; however , our liberal democr@@ acies do not have their roots in ancient Athens , &quot;
&quot; but in the Mag@@ na Cart@@ a , in the glorious revolution of 16@@ 88 , even in the American constitution . &quot;
&quot; while the Palestinian democracy concentrated on the free citizens and strengthening the working poor , our liberal democracy is based on the values of Mag@@ na Cart@@ a , which ultimately was a stat@@ ute for rulers . &quot;
&quot; for the liberal democracy only arose when a complete separation of politics and economy is possible and the democratic process was limited to politics , while the economy -- so the world of corporations -- became a democr@@ ati@@ zed zone . &quot;
&quot; in our modern democr@@ acies , since the time that this separation of politics and economy began , a rel@@ ent@@ less struggle between the two took place by gradually moving the policy and escap@@ es it . &quot;
do you wonder why politicians are no longer the same as before ?
it is not a de@@ generation of their DNA .
&quot; it is because it is possible to be in the government nowadays , and yet not in power , because the power of politics is immig@@ rated into the economy and the areas are separated . &quot;
I mentioned my hair with capitalism .
&quot; if you think about it , it is like a herd of car@@ ni@@ vor@@ es that are so sustain@@ ably the animals , of which they eat , dec@@ im@@ ated that they are star@@ ving at the end . &quot;
&quot; the power of the corporations is growing , political goods are being exploited , political goods are being exploited , political goods are being de@@ valued , the economic demand falls , and the directors of the corporations are too frigh@@ tened to invest the cash of their companies . &quot;
&quot; the more successful of capitalism the &quot; demo@@ s &quot; of democracy exp@@ els , the higher the twin peaks , and the greater the waste of human labour power and the well @-@ being of mankind . &quot;
&quot; if this is true , it is obvious that we must bring back the policy and the economy , and it would be better if the &quot; Dem@@ os &quot; re@@ tains control , as in ancient Athens , apart from exclusion of slaves , women and foreigners . &quot;
&quot; by the way , this is not a new idea . &quot;
the Marxist Left had already had this idea 100 years ago and it was not very good .
the teaching from the de@@ bac@@ le of the Soviet Union should be that the working poor only reg@@ ain a position as in ancient Athens without creating new species of brut@@ ality and wast@@ eful@@ ness .
but there is a solution : abol@@ ish the working poor !
capitalism does it by replacing low wage workers by automation and robots .
&quot; the problem is , as long as business and politics are separate areas , automation makes the twin peaks higher , the wast@@ eful@@ ness of a waste , and social conflicts are deeper , just as it is already very soon as I believe -- in countries like China . &quot;
&quot; so we need to transform the economy and re@@ unite the areas of economy and politics , and to ensure that we are democr@@ ati@@ zing the re @-@ unified field , otherwise we end up in a path@@ ological surveillance hyp@@ e auto@@ cr@@ acy that leaves the film &quot; Matrix &quot; as a documentary . &quot;
&quot; the question is not , whether capitalism will survive the technical achievements that he has produced , will survive -- &quot;
&quot; the most interesting question is whether capitalism is solved by a d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia , similar to the &quot; Matrix , &quot; similar to the &quot; Matrix , &quot; or something that the society is in &quot; star Tre@@ k , &quot; or in a high @-@ tech version of the ancient Ath@@ ener &quot; Ag@@ ora , &quot; in long discussions with the meaning of life . &quot;
I think we must be optim@@ istic .
&quot; so what would it be , how could it look , have this &quot; Star Tre@@ k &quot; unique utop@@ ia instead of the &quot; Matrix &quot; similar d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia ? &quot;
&quot; in practical implementation , I would like to give you some examples . &quot;
&quot; in the area of companies , please introduce a capital market where you earn money while you work and in which your capital works from one company to the next , and the company -- no matter what you currently work -- is the property of those who are currently working in the company . &quot;
then all income from capital and rede@@ em@@ ing and the concept of wage labor is completely over@@ hau@@ led .
&quot; no distinction between those who belong to the company , but who do not work in it , and employees working there , which the company does not belong to . no more exchange between capital and labour , no large gaps between investment and savings , and ultimately no open tw@@ ins . &quot;
&quot; in the field of global political economy : imagine that our national currencies would have a freely fluctu@@ ating exchange rate , in a universal , global , digital currency issued by the IMF &#91; International Monetary Fund &#93; and the G @-@ 20 &#91; group of 20 largest emerging countries &#93; , in the interests of all humanity . &quot;
&quot; imagine that the entire world trade is tra@@ ded in this currency -- we call it &quot; the cos@@ mos , &quot; in units of &quot; Cos@@ mos &quot; -- and each government pays the sum that corresponds to the trade defic@@ it or trading surplus of the respective country into a common fund . &quot;
&quot; imagine that this fund is investing in &quot; green &quot; technologies , especially in parts of the world where investment funds are rare . &quot;
this is not a new idea .
it is basically what John May@@ n@@ ard Key@@ nes proposed in the Bret@@ ton W@@ oods Conference from 1944 .
the problem was that at that time it was not the technical means to implement it .
&quot; today , we have them , especially in the background of a re@@ unified politics and economy . &quot;
&quot; the world I describe is at the same time liber@@ ated , in which they fav@@ ored privileged persons , and Marxist , because they have buried the separation of capital and labour in the womb of history , and Key@@ nes@@ ian , global key@@ n@@ esi@@ an@@ ese . &quot;
but above all else it is a world in which we can imagine real democracy .
will we aw@@ aken in such a world
or will we sink into a &quot; matrix &quot; - similar d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia ?
the answer depends on how we decide together politically .
it is in our hands and we do it better democratic .
thanks .
Bruno Gi@@ uss@@ ani : Yan@@ is ...
you write yourself in your biography itself as the liberal Marx@@ ists .
how relevant is Marx &apos;s analysis today ?
&quot; Yan@@ is Var@@ ou@@ fak@@ is : if anything of what I just said is relevant , then Marx is relevant . &quot;
&quot; the reason for the re@@ unification of politics and economy is ... Do we not do that , technological development will generate such a massive decline in macro@@ economic demand , which Lar@@ ry Sum@@ mers referred to as &quot; long @-@ term stagn@@ ation . &quot; &quot;
&quot; by transferring this crisis from a part of Earth to the next as we are experiencing it , it will not only dest@@ abil@@ ise our democr@@ acies but also the countries whose interest in liberal democracy is low . &quot;
&quot; if this analysis is true , Marx is quite relevant , &quot;
&quot; just like Hay@@ ek , that is why I am a liberal Marxist , and like Key@@ nes , and that &apos;s why I am also perfect . &quot;
&quot; BG : actually , and now we are well . &quot;
&quot; Y@@ V : if you don &apos;t , you don &apos;t think enough . &quot;
&quot; BG : this is a very Greek , a kind of philosophical statement -- Y@@ V : actually it was Ein@@ stein who said this . &quot;
would you like to repeat it here ?
Y@@ V : there is a great deal of hypo@@ cris@@ y .
in our liberal democr@@ acies we have the appearance of democracy .
&quot; as I said in my lecture , we have limited democracy to politics , while the area where most of it plays , -- the area of economy -- a totally democratic @-@ free zone . &quot;
&quot; in certain respects , if I can say so pro@@ voc@@ ative , China is similar today to the England of the 19th century . &quot;
&quot; for -- remember -- we tend to connect liber@@ alism with democracy -- this is a mistake , historically considered . &quot;
&quot; liber@@ alism , Liber@@ als , such as John Stu@@ art Mill -- &quot;
he was particularly scep@@ tical about the democratic development .
&quot; what we can see now in China is very similar to the development we had in England during the industrial revolution , especially the transition from the first to the second . &quot;

BG : I am sure that many list@@ eners are curious about your experiences as the finance minister of Greece at the beginning of the year .
Y@@ V : I thought that was coming .
BG : yes ...
how do you look back six months later on the first half @-@ year ?
&quot; Y@@ V : very exciting , from personal point of view , and very dis@@ ap@@ pointing because we had the opportunity to make a new beginning with the euro@@ zone , &quot;
&quot; not only Greece , but the Eurozone , &quot;
&quot; to say good@@ bye to us from self @-@ suffici@@ ency , and the constant den@@ ial that a massive fraud line ran through the euro@@ zone , and continues to be mas@@ sively threatened by the development of the whole European Union . &quot;
&quot; we had the opportunity , on the basis of the Greek proposal -- by the way , the first proposal that revealed this den@@ ial -- &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , the powers within the euro@@ zone , within the European group , still have chosen den@@ ial . &quot;
but you know what is coming .
this is the experience of the Soviet Union --
&quot; if you try to maintain an economic system that is not viable through political will and author@@ it@@ ari@@ anism in life , it may be delayed for a while , but when the change occurs , it happens ab@@ rup@@ tly and destructive . &quot;
BG : what change are you looking for ?
Y@@ V : there is no doubt that the Eurozone does not have a future if we do not change its structure .
BG : did you make any mistakes in your time as finance minister ?
Y@@ V : every day .
&quot; BG : for example ? Y@@ V : anyone looking back -- seri@@ ousness ... &quot;
&quot; if there is a finance minister or any minister , who is in office after 6 months in office , especially in such a ten@@ se situation , claim@@ ing that he did not make a mistake , then this is a dangerous person . &quot;
of course I made mistakes .
the greatest mistake was to sign the application for the extension of the debt programme at the end of February .
I believed that there was an honest interest in the don@@ ors to find a common solution .
but that was not .
&quot; they just wanted to bring our government down , just because they didn &apos;t want to deal with the debts that were going through the euro@@ zone . &quot;
they did not want to admit that they had been a cat@@ astrop@@ hic programme in Greece for 5 years .
we lost one third of our nominal GDP .
it is worse than during the &quot; Great Depression . &quot;
&quot; nobody from the tro@@ ika of the financi@@ ers imposed on us this policy was : &quot; &quot; this was a col@@ os@@ sal mistake . &quot;
&quot; BG : despite all this , and despite the aggressive tone of conversations , you seem to be quite pro @-@ European . &quot;
Y@@ V : absolutely .
my criticism of the European Union and the Eurozone is faced by someone who lives and loves Europe .
my biggest fear is that the Eurozone does not survive .
&quot; for if they do not survive , the liber@@ ated centri@@ fug@@ al forces will be demon@@ ic and destroy the European Union . &quot;
&quot; this will not have cat@@ astrop@@ hic consequences for Europe alone , but for the global economy . &quot;
we are probably the strongest economy in the world .
&quot; if we allow ourselves to introduce the way of a post @-@ modern 1930 , after which it seems to me it will be as bear@@ able for the future of Europeans and non @-@ Europeans . &quot;
BG : we hope that you are wrong at this point .
&quot; Yan@@ is , thank you for being at TE@@ D . &quot;
Y@@ V : thank you .
&quot; by Roy Price most of them have never heard , although he probably is responsible for 22 moderate minutes of your life on 19 April 2013 . &quot;
&quot; probably also for 22 very entertaining minutes , but not for many of you . &quot;
that goes back to the decision that Roy met three years ago .
&quot; Roy Price is Manager at Amazon Studios , &quot;
the TV production company from Amazon .
&quot; he is 47 years old , slim , has an i@@ gel@@ horn and describes himself on Twitter as &quot; films , TV , technology , tac@@ os . &quot;
Roy has a very important job because he is responsible for checking the shows and the content that Amazon will produce .
&quot; of course , this is a very hard @-@ fought sector . &quot;
there are so many TV series that Roy can &apos;t select any one .
&quot; he has to find shows that are very , very good . &quot;
&quot; in other words , he must find shows that are right on this curve . &quot;
this curve is the evaluation distribution of over 2500 TV series on the IM@@ DB website . the rating is from 1 to 10 and the height shows how many shows receive this review .
&quot; if your show is rated with nine and higher , this is a winner . &quot;
then you have a successful show .
&quot; these are shows like &quot; Break@@ ing Bad , &quot; &quot; Game of Thr@@ ones , &quot; &quot; The Wire &quot; -- all the shows that addic@@ ts addic@@ ted to where after a season has looked , your brain asks : &quot; where are there more of these epis@@ odes ? &quot;
this kind of show .
&quot; on the left side , here at this end , shows like &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ ar@@ as &quot; -- -- this should tell you enough what is going on at this end of the curve . &quot;
&quot; Roy Price does not worry about getting on the left side of the curve , because I think you already need special intelligence to sign &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ ar@@ as . &quot; &quot;
&quot; he makes more thoughts on average exc@@ itation , average television -- the shows that are neither good nor bad , they just don &apos;t inspire them . &quot;
so he must make sure that he is really on the right side .
&quot; the print is present , and of course it &apos;s the first time that Amazon is doing something , so Roy Price does not want to risk anything . &quot;
he wants to create achievements .
&quot; he needs guaranteed success , so he keeps a competition . &quot;
&quot; he takes many ideas for TV shows and cho@@ oses through an evaluation of eight candidates for TV shows , then he produces the first episode of each of these shows and makes them online , where they can look for free . &quot;
&quot; and if Amazon releases things for free , does one interv@@ ene correctly ? &quot;
millions of viewers watch these epis@@ odes .
&quot; however , they do not know they are watching when watching these shows . &quot;
they are observed by Roy and his team who record everything .
&quot; you capture when you start the show when you pause , which parts you ski@@ p and look again . &quot;
you collect millions of data to decide which show you should produce with these data .
&quot; in fact , they collect the data , process them , and this is the answer , and this is : &quot; Amazon should make a Sit@@ com about four Republi@@ can US sen@@ ators . &quot;
they made this show .
does anyone know the name of this show ?
&quot; yes , &quot; Alpha House , &quot; but it seems that not many can remember this show because it wasn &apos;t that good . &quot;
&quot; it is only an average show -- in the true sense of the word -- because the average of this curve is 7.@@ 4 and Alpha House lands at 7.5 -- so something above average , but not exactly what Roy and his team worked . &quot;
&quot; at the same time with another company another manager has placed a top show through data analysis . his name is Ted , Ted Sar@@ and@@ os , the manager for programming of Net@@ fli@@ x . just like Roy , he is always looking to find this a super show and he also uses data for it , but he makes it something different . &quot;
&quot; instead of organizing a competition , he and his team looked at the present data on Net@@ fli@@ x @-@ viewers , so the ratings they give the shows , their course , what shows they like , etc . &quot;
&quot; then they use these data to find out these little details about the audience : what shows they like , which producers , what actors . &quot;
&quot; when they had all the parts together they went to a venture and decided not to do a Sit@@ com about four sen@@ ators , but a drama series about a Sen@@ ator . &quot;
do you know this show ?
&quot; yes , &quot; House of Cards . &quot; Net@@ fli@@ x has landed a hit , at least for the first two seasons . &quot;
house of Cards &quot; gets a 9.@@ 1 review on this curve . so exactly where they wanted .
of course the question is : what happened here ?
&quot; you have two very competitive , data @-@ sealed firms . &quot;
&quot; they connect these many data together and it works great for one of them , but not for the other company . &quot;
what is that ?
because logic somehow states that it should work with everything .
&quot; if you collect millions of data , for a decision you meet , you should make a good decision . &quot;
you have 200 years of statistics as back @-@ up .
you can optimize it by a very powerful computer .
&quot; what you can expect is good television , or ? &quot;
&quot; if data analysis does not work so , it is a bit frigh@@ tening because we live in a time in which we take more and more statistics to make serious decisions , far beyond television . &quot;
does anyone know the company Multi @-@ Health Systems ?
&quot; no one . OK , this is even good . &quot;
multi @-@ Health system is a software company and I hope that no one in this room ever comes into contact with this software . come in touch with you in prison .
&quot; if someone is in prison here and asks for dismis@@ sal , it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine whether a discharge occurs or not . &quot;
&quot; just like Amazon and Net@@ fli@@ x . but instead of deciding if a show will be good or bad , it is decided whether a person will be good or bad . &quot;
&quot; moderate TV , 22 minutes , this can be real bad , but even more years in prison are worse . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , there is evidence that this data analysis , despite the many data , &quot;
not always producing the best results . this is not because a company like multi @-@ health system does not know how to use data .
also the data of the most experienced companies are wrong .
&quot; yes , even Google sometimes makes mistakes . &quot;
&quot; in 2009 , Google announced that it can predic@@ t data analysis out@@ breaks of influ@@ enza , the bad way -- through data analysis of Google searches . &quot;
it worked wonderfully and was a great news sensation . success cul@@ min@@ ated in a publication in the magazine &quot; Nature . &quot;
&quot; it worked fine , year around year , until it suddenly didn &apos;t work anymore , &quot;
and no one could say why .
&quot; it simply did not work , this was once again a sensation , including the re@@ vocation of publication in the magazine &quot; Nature . &quot; &quot;
even the data of the most experienced companies like Amazon and Google sometimes mis@@ understand something .
&quot; despite all these errors , data clearly flows into decisions of life -- at the workplace , in the legal enforcement , in medicine . &quot;
so we should rather make sure that data are helpful .
&quot; I also know many difficulties with data . I work in computer @-@ ai@@ ded gene@@ tics -- an area where some very clever people use un@@ imagin@@ able many data to make serious decisions , as the decision for a cancer therapy &quot;
or the development of a medication . over the years I recognized some patterns of the difference between successful decisions based on data and not successful decisions . this pattern should be distributed .
&quot; if you need to solve a complex problem , do basically two things : &quot;
&quot; first , you disman@@ tle this problem into its components so that you can analyze the items ; as a second , you put the items together again to make a decision . &quot;
sometimes you have to do this several times but there are always two things : take apart and put together again .
and now the most important thing : data and data analysis are just good for the first part .
&quot; data and data analysis , no matter how powerful , can only help disman@@ tle a problem and understand its parts . &quot;
they are not suitable to put the parts together again and then come to a decision .
&quot; for this , there is another tool and we all possess it : our brain . &quot;
&quot; if there is something in which the brain is good , it is parts and pieces to put together again , even if the information is incomplete , so that the information is incomplete -- especially if it is the brain of an expert . &quot;
&quot; therefore , I believe , Net@@ fli@@ x was so successful because they used data and minds , where they also belong in the process . &quot;
&quot; they use data to better understand their audience , what else they wouldn &apos;t have been able to do . but the decision on how to put all these pieces back together and make a show like &quot; House of Cards &quot; which was not in the data . &quot;
Ted Sar@@ and@@ os and his team met this decision for this show which meant they had a great personal risk with this decision .
&quot; Amazon , on the other hand , did this in the wrong way . &quot;
&quot; they used data to control all their choices , first when they compete for TV ideas , then when they selected &quot; Alpha House &quot; as a show . &quot;
&quot; it was a safe decision , because they could always say : &quot; &quot; that &apos;s what the data say to us . &quot;
it did not lead to the desired result .
&quot; data are helpful for better decisions , but I think things go wrong when data start to control our decisions . &quot;
&quot; no matter how powerful they are , data are just a tool , and in order to not forget it , this device is quite useful . &quot;
many of you will ...
&quot; before there was data , this was the device for decisions . &quot;
many know it .
&quot; it is also called &quot; &quot; Magic 8 Ball &quot; . &quot; it &apos;s amazing . for decisions using a J@@ a- or no question , you just need to shake the ball to get an answer . &quot; &quot; most likely &quot; &quot; -- right here at this moment . &quot;
I will f@@ encing it later with a technical demo .
&quot; so far I have made some decisions in my life , whereby I should have heard the ball in the after@@ math . &quot;
&quot; but , as you naturally know if you have the data available , you would like to replace them with a much more sophisticated , such as data analysis to make better decisions . &quot;
but this does not change the basic structure .
&quot; perhaps the ball is smar@@ ter and wis@@ er and wis@@ er . ultimately , it is up to us to make decisions when we want to reach something extraordinary at the end of the right curve . &quot;
&quot; and I feel this as very encouraging message that despite the large amount of data still pays off to make decisions , an expert in what you are doing and risks . &quot;
&quot; because in the end , it is not the data , but the risks that you land at the right end of the curve . &quot;
thank you very much .
