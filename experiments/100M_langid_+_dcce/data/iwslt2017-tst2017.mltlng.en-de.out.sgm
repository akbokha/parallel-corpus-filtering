<seg id="1">This is James Risen.</seg>
<seg id="2">They might know him because he won the Pulitzer Prize as a New York Times reporter.</seg>
<seg id="3">"long before someone had heard of Edward Snowden, Risen wrote a book in which he was spectacularly published that the NSA illegally listened illegally by Americans."</seg>
<seg id="4">But it is another chapter that should leave a lasting impression.</seg>
<seg id="5">"in this, he describes a catastrophic US intelligence service, in which the CIA literally handed out designs for a nuclear bomb."</seg>
<seg id="6">"if that sounds crazy, read it."</seg>
<seg id="7">It is an incredible story.</seg>
<seg id="8">But do you know who the chapter didn't fall at all?</seg>
<seg id="9">The US Government.</seg>
<seg id="10">"for almost 10 years, the government has ascertained against cracks and called upon him to name its alleged sources."</seg>
<seg id="11">"in this turn, he became a symbol of the pattern of the government to condemn whistleblower and to spy journalists."</seg>
<seg id="12">"according to the First Constitutional Court, the media have the right to publish secret information."</seg>
<seg id="13">"but it is impossible to apply this right if media cannot get this information, and if they cannot protect the identity of the Mutigen they offer."</seg>
<seg id="14">"so when the government arrived at Risen, he did something what many courageous reporters did before him: he refused and said he would rather go to prison."</seg>
<seg id="15">"from 2007 to 2015, Risen lived with the risk to go to prison."</seg>
<seg id="16">"but then, just days before the trial, something extraordinary happened."</seg>
<seg id="17">"suddenly, although they indicate for years that it would be essential for their case, the demands of the government were dropped to cracks."</seg>
<seg id="18">The reason: in the time of electronic monitoring the reporters and sources can be hidden less and less.</seg>
<seg id="19">"instead of separating and cracking tears, they could also do his digital footprints for him."</seg>
<seg id="20">"so the investigators, without his consent, have been kept secret by his telephone numbers,"</seg>
<seg id="21">"just like his e-mail data, finance and bank information, his credit information, and even travel advice with the list of his flights."</seg>
<seg id="22">"in the midst of this information they found evidence that they used to condemn Jeffrey Sterling, a CIA whistleblower and cracks."</seg>
<seg id="23">"unfortunately, this is only one of many cases."</seg>
<seg id="24">"President Obama promised to protect whistleblower, but instead, the judiciary has condemned more than all US governments before him."</seg>
<seg id="25">"now you can imagine how this can be a problem, especially because the government classifies too much of its work as secret."</seg>
<seg id="26">"since September 11, almost every article on national security was the result of a whistleblower to a journalist."</seg>
<seg id="27">"so we put the press work on the game, which is to be protected by the first constitutional complaint, because the government has more and more possibilities to spy on all."</seg>
<seg id="28">"but just as the government's technology allows to bypass the rights of reporters, the press can also use technologies to better protect their sources."</seg>
<seg id="29">"they can do that from the moment in which they receive contact, rather than in the aftermath, in the witness stand."</seg>
<seg id="30">"today there are communication software, which didn't yet exist when Risen had written his book, and it is much safer than normal emails or phone calls."</seg>
<seg id="31">"such technology is SecureDrop, an open source transmission system for whistleblower, which was originally developed by the Internet-famous Aaron Swartz, and is now developed by the Freedom of the Press Foundation where I work."</seg>
<seg id="32">"instead of sending an e-mail, go to a news site, just like the Washington Post here."</seg>
<seg id="33">"there you can upload documents or send information, as with any ordinary contact form."</seg>
<seg id="34">"these are then encrypted and stored on a server, where only the respective news agency has access."</seg>
<seg id="35">"so the government can no longer procure information secretly, and many of the information they would request would not be available from the outset."</seg>
<seg id="36">But SecureDrop is only a small part of the whole to protect the freedom of the press in the 21st century.</seg>
<seg id="37">"unfortunately, governments around the world are developing new spy technologies that endanger all of us."</seg>
<seg id="38">"it is important to us to ensure that not only technology inseparators such as Edward Snowden have a possibility to apply missions. it is just as important that we protect the next whistleblower,"</seg>
<seg id="39">"who knows about grievances in the supply of soldiers, who wants to report on overcrowded hospitals. or the next environmental worker, the alarm to the contaminated water of Flint. or a Wallstreet insider who warns us before the next financial crisis."</seg>
<seg id="40">"after all, these technologies were not only made for those who want to expose crimes, but to protect our fundamental rights."</seg>
<seg id="41">Thanks.</seg>
<seg id="42">[on 3 April 2016 the biggest data check of history was published.] [the "Panama Papers" reveal that Reiche and Mighty] have hidden [enormous sums of money in tax havens].] This week we were asked of news about a leak of 11 million documents of the law firm Mossack Fonseca.</seg>
<seg id="43">The publication of these documents gives a small insight into the secret world of tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="44">"we get an impression of how customers, banks and lawyers go to companies like Mossack Fonseca and say:" okay, we need an anonymous company. can you set up this? "</seg>
<seg id="45">"we actually see the emails, the exchange of messages, how the whole system works as it works."</seg>
<seg id="46">This has already led to very direct consequences.</seg>
<seg id="47">The Prime Minister has resigned.</seg>
<seg id="48">There are also reports that an ally of the brutal Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad's letter companies in tax havens has.</seg>
<seg id="49">"it is said that a trace of $2 billion leads to Russia's President Vladimir Putin, over a close friend of children's days, a famous cellist."</seg>
<seg id="50">"now there will be a lot of richer people and others who wait for the next release, and on the next revealing documents."</seg>
<seg id="51">Now it sounds like the plot of a writer or a John Grisham-novel.</seg>
<seg id="52">"it seems to weep away from you, me, ordinary people."</seg>
<seg id="53">Why should that come to us?</seg>
<seg id="54">"but the truth is: if the rich and powerful are able to hide their fortune in tax havens and not pay all their taxes, this means less money for important public services such as health care, education, roads."</seg>
<seg id="55">And that concerns us all.</seg>
<seg id="56">"for my organization, Global Witness, these revelations are phenomenal."</seg>
<seg id="57">"in the whole world, media and leading politicians discuss how secret tax havens are used by some few to hide their fortune and disguise -- something we have been discussing and revealing for ten years."</seg>
<seg id="58">"I think many people seem very confusing this whole world, and it is hard to understand how these tax havens function."</seg>
<seg id="59">I always imagine it like a matrjoschkapuppe.</seg>
<seg id="60">"so you have a company in another company, in another company, which makes it almost impossible to really understand who is behind these bones."</seg>
<seg id="61">"it can be very difficult for criminal prosecution and tax authorities, as well as for journalists or civil society to truly understand what matters."</seg>
<seg id="62">I think it is also interesting that there are fewer reports on this matter in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="63">"presumably, because there were so far no prominent Americans who occurred in these revelations, this scandal."</seg>
<seg id="64">Now it is not that there are no rich Americans hiding their fortune in tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="65">"however, by the principle of which these tax havens work, Mossack Fonseca has fewer American customers."</seg>
<seg id="66">"if we had a check from the Cayman Islands or even from Delaware, Wyoming or Nevada, we would see much more cases and examples that have connections to the USA."</seg>
<seg id="67">"in fact, in some US states you need less information to provide less information to establish a company than to get a library card."</seg>
<seg id="68">This type of intransparency in the US allowed employees of school districts to rip schoolchildren.</seg>
<seg id="69">Scammers are allowed to rip off especially susceptible feeders.</seg>
<seg id="70">It is this kind of behavior that concerns us all.</seg>
<seg id="71">Here at Global Witness we wanted to find out how all this looks in practice.</seg>
<seg id="72">How does it work?</seg>
<seg id="73">So we sent a covert investigator to the offices of 13 lawyers in Manhattan.</seg>
<seg id="74">"our investigator found himself as an African minister, who wanted to bring suspicious money to the United States to buy a house, a yacht, a private jet."</seg>
<seg id="75">We really shocked that all of us made suggestions to our investigator how he could transfer his money.</seg>
<seg id="76">"none of these lawyers accepted us as clients, and of course nobody was given money to anybody. however, it shows the problem with this system."</seg>
<seg id="77">It is also important not to consider this as individual cases.</seg>
<seg id="78">It is not about a single lawyer who has submitted proposals to our covert investigator.</seg>
<seg id="79">"it's not about a single top politician, wrapped in a scandal."</seg>
<seg id="80">"it is about how the system works through corruption, tax evasion, poverty and instability."</seg>
<seg id="81">"and to cope with this, we need to change the rules."</seg>
<seg id="82">We need to change the rules to make this type of behavior difficult.</seg>
<seg id="83">"this may sound very sad, as if we could not do anything about it; as if nothing could have changed, as if there is always the rich and powerful."</seg>
<seg id="84">"but as a born optimist, I really see that some have begun to change."</seg>
<seg id="85">"in the last few years, we have seen more transparency regarding the owners of companies."</seg>
<seg id="86">The topic found political attention by British Prime Minister David Cameron on the G8 summit in 2013 in Northern Ireland.</seg>
<seg id="87">"since then, the EU detects in central registers at a national level who really is behind companies in Europe and who controls them."</seg>
<seg id="88">One of the unpleasant facts is that the US is lagging behind.</seg>
<seg id="89">"representatives of both parties have brought a bill in both parliamentary chambers, but this does not make the progress we would like to see."</seg>
<seg id="90">"we would really like to see how these Panama revelations, this huge insight into the world of tax havens, is used as a means to provide more transparency in the US and globally."</seg>
<seg id="91">"for us at Global Witness, this is a moment of change."</seg>
<seg id="92">We need ordinary people who are angry when they see how other people can hide their true identity behind bogus firms.</seg>
<seg id="93">We need leaders in the economy that stand up and say: "Intransparency is not good for business."</seg>
<seg id="94">We need leading politicians who recognize the problem and use it to end this type of intransparency by laws.</seg>
<seg id="95">"together we can finally end the Intransparency, which now enables this kind of tax evasion, corruption and money laundering, finally ending."</seg>
<seg id="96">This is the story of how I almost kidnapped and landed in the trunk of a red Mazda.</seg>
<seg id="97">"a day after I finished my design study, I made a backyard sale."</seg>
<seg id="98">A guy in the red Mazda stopped and looked at my stuff.</seg>
<seg id="99">He bought one of my works of art.</seg>
<seg id="100">He was alone in the city and just made a road trip across the country. afterwards he would go to peace corps.</seg>
<seg id="101">I invited him to a beer. he told me about how he wanted to change the world.</seg>
<seg id="102">It was late. I got tired.</seg>
<seg id="103">"while we paid the bill, I made the mistake asking him," "Where do you sleep tonight?" ""</seg>
<seg id="104">He made the whole thing worse: "I don't know."</seg>
<seg id="105">"and I thought," Oh, man! "</seg>
<seg id="106">What do I do now? "</seg>
<seg id="107">Who does not know the situation?</seg>
<seg id="108">Do I have to offer a sleeping place now?</seg>
<seg id="109">"but I just got to know him! he said he would go to the Peace Corps, but I don't know if he really plans it. I don't want to escape in the trunk of a Mazdas!"</seg>
<seg id="110">This is a small trunk!</seg>
<seg id="111">Then I heard myself saying: "I have an air mattress. you can sleep in my living room."</seg>
<seg id="112">"one voice in my head said:" "Oh, how please?"</seg>
<seg id="113">"at night I was lying in bed, I was staring on the ceiling and thought:" Oh man! what did I get there? "</seg>
<seg id="114">A stranger sleeps in my living room.</seg>
<seg id="115">What if he is crazy?</seg>
<seg id="116">"I got such a fear that I got out of the bed, on toes pointed to the door, and my bedroom door shut down."</seg>
<seg id="117">But he was not crazy.</seg>
<seg id="118">We are still in contact.</seg>
<seg id="119">The work of art that he had bought by me today hangs in his classroom. he is now a teacher.</seg>
<seg id="120">This was my first experience as a host. it has changed my point of view completely.</seg>
<seg id="121">"maybe the people who were sold to me as a stranger, really friends, who were only waiting to be discovered?"</seg>
<seg id="122">"sleeping on my air mattress was normal for me. when I moved to San Francisco, I took the air mattress."</seg>
<seg id="123">"we make a leap, two years later..."</seg>
<seg id="124">"I am unemployed, almost plastered, my roommate goes out and the rent is increased."</seg>
<seg id="125">I learned that at that time there was a design conference in the city. all hotels were fully booked.</seg>
<seg id="126">"I believe, creativity can create it to turn fear into fun."</seg>
<seg id="127">"I wrote to my best friend and new roommate Brian Chesky:" Brian, I think about how we could earn something. "</seg>
<seg id="128">Ha!</seg>
<seg id="129">We created a website and established so "Air Mattresses and Breakfast" [AIRBed aNd Breakfast = Airbnb].</seg>
<seg id="130">Three lucky guests were allowed to sleep for 20 dollars on the air mattress on wooden floors.</seg>
<seg id="131">"they found it great, and we too."</seg>
<seg id="132">"I am sure, our cheese-ham-omelets tasted completely different because we made it for our guests."</seg>
<seg id="133">"we toured with them throughout the city. when we left our last guest and fell the door to the castle, Brian and me died."</seg>
<seg id="134">Had we just discovered that we could find new friends at the same time and pay our rent?</seg>
<seg id="135">Things came to play.</seg>
<seg id="136">"my former roommate, Nate Blecharczyk, joined us as a developer."</seg>
<seg id="137">We wanted to find out if you could make it a business concept.</seg>
<seg id="138">"so we presented the investors:" "we want to create a website where people post public pictures of their private rooms, their bedrooms, their bathrooms -- the kind of rooms whose doors one closes when visiting."</seg>
<seg id="139">Over the internet they can then invite wild people to stay with them.</seg>
<seg id="140">This will be the next big thing! "</seg>
<seg id="141">We waited for the missile to ignite.</seg>
<seg id="142">But they do not.</seg>
<seg id="143">"no one who is still at comfort would invest in a business, allowing strangers to sleep in apartments of other people."</seg>
<seg id="144">Why?</seg>
<seg id="145">Because we all learned as children that strangers are dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="146">"if you have a problem, you get to the things that you can do well. we could design."</seg>
<seg id="147">"at the Kunstakademie, we learned that design is much more than just look and haptics -- it is the overall experience."</seg>
<seg id="148">"we had learned how to design objects, but now we wanted to create immense trust between people who had never met before."</seg>
<seg id="149">Can design make such a thing?</seg>
<seg id="150">Is it possible to create trust with design?</seg>
<seg id="151">I would like to give you a sample of what degree of confidence we scanned.</seg>
<seg id="152">It is a 30-seconds experiment. it will force you out of your comfort zone.</seg>
<seg id="153">Thumbs up when you are ready.</seg>
<seg id="154">Take your mobile into your hand.</seg>
<seg id="155">Now I want you to unlock your mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="156">Enter your unlocked cell phone from your left seat neighbour.</seg>
<seg id="157">This quiet pairing of panic you can now feel -- -- is exactly what hosts feel when they open the door first time.</seg>
<seg id="158">The only thing that is more personal than your mobile phone is your home.</seg>
<seg id="159">"visitors can not only read your SMS, they see your bedroom, your kitchen, your toilet."</seg>
<seg id="160">How does it feel to hold the unlocked mobile phone of a stranger in your hands?</seg>
<seg id="161">Most sense the responsibility.</seg>
<seg id="162">"so, most of the guests feel when they stay elsewhere."</seg>
<seg id="163">Only for this reason our company can exist.</seg>
<seg id="164">"just like, who actually has Al Gores cell phone?"</seg>
<seg id="165">Could you please announce to Twitter that he is channelled for the President's office?</seg>
<seg id="166">You can now return the mobile phones.</seg>
<seg id="167">You have now experienced what kind of trust we want to build. I would like to tell you of some discoveries.</seg>
<seg id="168">What if we had changed a little detail in this experiment?</seg>
<seg id="169">"what if your neighbor would have imagined once with his name, if he had told whence he comes from, like his dog or his children?"</seg>
<seg id="170">Imagine you would have 150 testimonies that all say: "he can really hold very well unlocked hands!"</seg>
<seg id="171">How would you feel if you had to give up your mobile phone?</seg>
<seg id="172">Because a well thought-out feedback system strengthens trust.</seg>
<seg id="173">At the beginning we did some things wrong.</seg>
<seg id="174">It was hard for the people to give negative appraisals.</seg>
<seg id="175">"in the end, we decided to wait until both host and guest had submitted their appraisals before we put them online."</seg>
<seg id="176">Last week we discovered something new.</seg>
<seg id="177">"we conducted a study with Stanford. we examined how likely it is that people trust each other, depending on how similar they are in terms of age and residence."</seg>
<seg id="178">"little surprisingly, we trust the people most similar to us."</seg>
<seg id="179">"the more differences we find, the less we trust."</seg>
<seg id="180">This is a natural social bias.</seg>
<seg id="181">It is exciting to add a person's call -- in our case by judgements.</seg>
<seg id="182">"if you have less than three judgements, nothing changes."</seg>
<seg id="183">"but if you have more than ten, everything changes."</seg>
<seg id="184">A good reputation rusts similarities.</seg>
<seg id="185">The right design can help us overcome some of our deeply rooted preference.</seg>
<seg id="186">"in addition, we learned that trust is dependent on how much one pays off."</seg>
<seg id="187">Here you can see the reactions to the first message of a guest.</seg>
<seg id="188">"if you tell too little, like" "Hi!", "you will not get an answer."</seg>
<seg id="189">"as for example," "I have problems with my mother" -- -- the request is not accepted. "</seg>
<seg id="190">"so there is an optimal degree of openness, e.g." "Tolle Artworks in your apartment! I make a vacation with my family holiday." ""</seg>
<seg id="191">How can you create it with design to make this degree of openness?</seg>
<seg id="192">We use the size of the text field to recommend the correct amount of text. we also give tips on which topics you should write something.</seg>
<seg id="193">Our whole company builds on the hope that the right design can help overcome our prejudices against strangers.</seg>
<seg id="194">What we did not expect was the great amount of people who were more than willing to leave these prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="195">Here you see how many people claim our offer.</seg>
<seg id="196">You can see three things.</seg>
<seg id="197">"first, incredibly good luck."</seg>
<seg id="198">Second: the tireless work of our team.</seg>
<seg id="199">"third, a need not previously covered."</seg>
<seg id="200">"for us, the business runs very well."</seg>
<seg id="201">"of course, there are times when not everything runs smoothly."</seg>
<seg id="202">There were guests who celebrated unlawful parties or devastated apartments.</seg>
<seg id="203">Hosts have let guests stand in the rain.</seg>
<seg id="204">At the beginning of the project I worked with the customer service. all calls came directly to my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="205">I stood at the forefront when trust was broken.</seg>
<seg id="206">There is nothing worse than these calls. it hurts when I only think of it.</seg>
<seg id="207">"the disappointment that one hears in the voice of the callers, was and will always be our greatest motivation to further improve."</seg>
<seg id="208">"fortunately, only a fraction had a fraction of the 123 million overnight stays."</seg>
<seg id="209">For people trust one another rightly.</seg>
<seg id="210">"when trust is working, wonderful things can arise."</seg>
<seg id="211">One of our guests made holidays in Uruguay. there he suffered a heart attack.</seg>
<seg id="212">His host drove him to the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="213">He even donated blood for the necessary operation!</seg>
<seg id="214">Here is his assessment:</seg>
<seg id="215">Perfect house for travelers who tend to tend to heart attacks due to sedentary activities.</seg>
<seg id="216">The area is beautiful and equipped with sufficient hospitals.</seg>
<seg id="217">"Javier and Alejandra are real guardian angels who save lives, even though they don't know one at all."</seg>
<seg id="218">"you drive to the hospital in your own car when you die, and wait while you get a bypass."</seg>
<seg id="219">"because they don't want to feel lonely, they bring books past."</seg>
<seg id="220">You can even stay longer without counting the extra nights.</seg>
<seg id="221">I can only recommend it! "</seg>
<seg id="222">"of course, not every stay happens."</seg>
<seg id="223">But these relationships behind the pure monetary transaction are exactly what you want to achieve with the Share Economy.</seg>
<seg id="224">"when I stumbled upon this term for the first time, I asked myself:"</seg>
<seg id="225">How does the idea of sharing with money transactions fit together?</seg>
<seg id="226">It is an economic trade here.</seg>
<seg id="227">"but now simply to name" "rental industry", "the thing is not fair."</seg>
<seg id="228">Share Economy describes a trade that promises human relationships.</seg>
<seg id="229">People put a part of themselves open and that changes everything.</seg>
<seg id="230">"when you're travelling today, it's easy to compare with Fast Food. it is efficient and reliable, but less authentic."</seg>
<seg id="231">What if travelling would be a rich buffet from local impressions?</seg>
<seg id="232">"what would be if at any place you visited, a group there would wait to fill a thoroughly and show one in a pub crawl district, of which one has never heard;"</seg>
<seg id="233">Or if you could learn cooking from a five-star chef?</seg>
<seg id="234">"nowadays, apartments are designed according to the principle of privacy."</seg>
<seg id="235">What if we would design apartments from reason to clasp together?</seg>
<seg id="236">What would it look like?</seg>
<seg id="237">What if cities would assume the thought of shared participation?</seg>
<seg id="238">I imagine cities that enable us society and relationships instead of solitude and depreciation.</seg>
<seg id="239">"in South Korea's capital Seoul, this project has already begun. many parking places belonging to the government,"</seg>
<seg id="240">Were now offered residents. students who were looking for a place to stay</seg>
<seg id="241">"were mediated to people whose children were withdrawn. incubator programs were started,"</seg>
<seg id="242">"to finance new start-ups in Share Economy, over our platform alone 785 000 people in 191 countries will be guest at a stranger or even host."</seg>
<seg id="243">So the idea seems to be not as crazy as it was taught us.</seg>
<seg id="244">We did not reinvent the wheel.</seg>
<seg id="245">Hospitality had already existed before.</seg>
<seg id="246">There were similar websites in front of us.</seg>
<seg id="247">So why did our work just work?</seg>
<seg id="248">"apart from luck and timing, we realized that you can find the right design with the components of trust."</seg>
<seg id="249">Design can help us overcome deep-rooted prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="250">I think this is amazing.</seg>
<seg id="251">Almost overwhelming.</seg>
<seg id="252">I have to think about it every time a red Mazda is passing by.</seg>
<seg id="253">"of course, we know that design cannot solve any problem."</seg>
<seg id="254">"but if it could help us, if it had this great influence, I wonder what we will be able to use design soon."</seg>
<seg id="255">Thanks.</seg>
<seg id="256">What do you think when you look at me?</seg>
<seg id="257">A believer? an expert?</seg>
<seg id="258">Maybe even a sister.</seg>
<seg id="259">"or suppressed, brainwashed, a terrorist?"</seg>
<seg id="260">Or simply a delay in the security check at the airport.</seg>
<seg id="261">This is actually true.</seg>
<seg id="262">I don't give you the blame for your negative impressions.</seg>
<seg id="263">So the media represent people who look like me.</seg>
<seg id="264">A study revealed that 80% of reporting on Islam and Muslims is negative.</seg>
<seg id="265">Studies show: the Americans think most would not know Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="266">"probably, people don't talk to their drivers."</seg>
<seg id="267">For those who have never met a Muslim: it's great to get to know you.</seg>
<seg id="268">I tell you who I am.</seg>
<seg id="269">"I am a mother, a coffee lover -- double espresso, with cream extra."</seg>
<seg id="270">"I am introverted,"</seg>
<seg id="271">A Möchtegern-Fitness-Fanatikerin</seg>
<seg id="272">And I am a practicing spiritual Muslim.</seg>
<seg id="273">"but not like Lady Gaga sings, because, baby, I was not born so."</seg>
<seg id="274">I decided to do this.</seg>
<seg id="275">When I was 17 years old I met the decision to outen me.</seg>
<seg id="276">"no, not as homosexual human, like some of my friends but as Muslims. I decided to wear the Hijab, my head cover."</seg>
<seg id="277">"my feminist friends were horrified:" "why do you suppress yourself?" ""</seg>
<seg id="278">"the funny thing was: at that time, it was a feminist declaration of independence, as opposed to the pressure I felt as 17-year-old to adapt myself to a perfect and unbeatable beauty ideal."</seg>
<seg id="279">I did not only accept the faith of my parents.</seg>
<seg id="280">I have wrestled with the Qur'an.</seg>
<seg id="281">"I read it, thought, asked, doubted and ultimately believed."</seg>
<seg id="282">My relationship with God was not love at first sight.</seg>
<seg id="283">It was confidence and slow devotion which deepened with every reading of the Qur'an.</seg>
<seg id="284">The beauty of the rhythm sometimes brings me to cry.</seg>
<seg id="285">I know myself in it. I feel God knows me.</seg>
<seg id="286">"do you ever feel that anyone perceives you, fully understands you, and yet in love?"</seg>
<seg id="287">This is how it feels.</seg>
<seg id="288">"later I married and started like all the good Egyptians, my career as an engineer."</seg>
<seg id="289">"later, after my marriage, I had a child, and basically lived the" Egyptian-American Dream. ""</seg>
<seg id="290">Then came the terrible morning in September 2001.</seg>
<seg id="291">Many of you probably remember exactly where they were there.</seg>
<seg id="292">"I sat in my kitchen, had breakfast at the end, looked up on the screen and saw the word" "Breaking News." ""</seg>
<seg id="293">"smoke, airplanes flew into buildings, people sprang from the buildings."</seg>
<seg id="294">What was that?</seg>
<seg id="295">An accident?</seg>
<seg id="296">A technical disturbance?</seg>
<seg id="297">My shock quickly turned into rebellion.</seg>
<seg id="298">Why should one do something like this?</seg>
<seg id="299">"I switched to the TV channel and heard:"... "Muslim terrorists..."... "in the name of Islam..." "..."... "..."... "..."... "..."</seg>
<seg id="300">"Oh, my God."</seg>
<seg id="301">"not only my country has been attacked, but in the Nu the deeds of others turned me into a suspect."</seg>
<seg id="302">The same day we had to drive through the Middle East of the USA to move into a new city and start with the postgraduate studies.</seg>
<seg id="303">"I remember, as we sailed -- as we sailed -- so deep it went into my seat, and I feared the first time being recognized as Muslims."</seg>
<seg id="304">"we went to our apartment this night, in a new city where it felt like a completely different world."</seg>
<seg id="305">"and then, I saw and read the warnings of the national Islamic organizations saying," Be alert, "" Be careful, "" Stay careful in well-lit areas, "" don't worry. "</seg>
<seg id="306">I stayed the whole week inside.</seg>
<seg id="307">Then it was Friday at that week -- the day when Muslims gather to pray.</seg>
<seg id="308">"and again the warnings were:" "not on this first Friday, the mosque could be a goal."</seg>
<seg id="309">I saw the extensive coverage.</seg>
<seg id="310">"the feelings were unfiltered unfiltered, and I also heard of attacks on Muslims or of people who were considered to be free for Muslims."</seg>
<seg id="311">There were really fire attacks on mosques.</seg>
<seg id="312">I thought we should stay at home.</seg>
<seg id="313">But something did not feel right.</seg>
<seg id="314">Because the people who attacked this country attacked our country.</seg>
<seg id="315">I hit the terrorists' fury against the terrorists.</seg>
<seg id="316">Imagine! I was angry.</seg>
<seg id="317">It is not easy to constantly explain itself.</seg>
<seg id="318">"I have nothing against questions, I love questions."</seg>
<seg id="319">They are the accusations that are hard.</seg>
<seg id="320">Nowadays we can actually say people say: "there is a problem in this country -- it is Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="321">When will we go? "</seg>
<seg id="322">Some people want to banish Muslims and join Mosques.</seg>
<seg id="323">They speak of my church like a tumor in the USA's body.</seg>
<seg id="324">Only the question arises: are we malignant or benign?</seg>
<seg id="325">They know: a malignant tumor is removed as a whole and a benign tumour is only observed under observation.</seg>
<seg id="326">The alternatives are pointless because the question is wrong.</seg>
<seg id="327">"Muslims are like all other Americans, no tumor in the body of the US, but a vital organ."</seg>
<seg id="328">Thanks!</seg>
<seg id="329">"Muslims are inventors and teachers, sthand and Olympism."</seg>
<seg id="330">Will the closure of mosques America safer?</seg>
<seg id="331">Maybe a few parking spaces will be freed but not stop the terror.</seg>
<seg id="332">"the regular visit of a mosque leads to consider people other faiths more tolerant, and to show greater civic participation."</seg>
<seg id="333">"and as a leader of the police in Washington, DC recently told: people are actually not radicalised in mosques."</seg>
<seg id="334">They are radicalised in their cellar or in bed in front of a computer.</seg>
<seg id="335">"in the radicalization process, one has found that it starts online. first, the person is cut off from their church, even from their family, so that the person thinks that the person thinks that the terrorists are the true Muslims, and everyone who abhors their behavior and ideology is a traitor or of faith."</seg>
<seg id="336">"if we want to prevent radicalization, we must stop the people to go to the mosque."</seg>
<seg id="337">Some will still claim that Islam is a violent religion.</seg>
<seg id="338">"finally, a group like the IS establishes their brutality with the Qur'an."</seg>
<seg id="339">"as Muslims, as a mother, as a person, I believe that we must do everything to stop a group like the IS."</seg>
<seg id="340">But we would add to their imagination to recognize them as representatives of 1.6 billion believers.</seg>
<seg id="341">Thanks!</seg>
<seg id="342">The IS has so much to do with Islam as the Ku-Klux-Klan with Christianity.</seg>
<seg id="343">Both groups claim their ideology on their "holy book."</seg>
<seg id="344">"but when you take a look at them, it doesn't matter what they read in their" Sacred Scripture. ""</seg>
<seg id="345">It is their brutality that lets them read these things into Scripture.</seg>
<seg id="346">An outstanding Imam recently told me an amazing story:</seg>
<seg id="347">A girl came to him because she preferred to join the IS.</seg>
<seg id="348">I was really surprised and asked him if they had been in contact with radical religious leaders.</seg>
<seg id="349">"he said that the problem was exactly the opposite. every clergy with whom she spoke, brought her to silence, and told her that her anger, her sense of injustice in the world, would only bring it into trouble."</seg>
<seg id="350">"inspired by nothing and something that had given meaning to their fury, it was a main objective for the instrumentalization of extremists that promised her a solution."</seg>
<seg id="351">This Imam returned to God and to her church.</seg>
<seg id="352">"instead of accusing them for their rage, he showed their constructive ways for real change in the world."</seg>
<seg id="353">"what they learned in the mosque, they forbid them to join the IS."</seg>
<seg id="354">This was an insight into how the Islamophobia concerns me and my family.</seg>
<seg id="355">But how does it affect ordinary Americans?</seg>
<seg id="356">How does it affect everyone else?</seg>
<seg id="357">How does the 24-hour consumption of fear affect our democracy every day?</seg>
<seg id="358">One study -- actually several neuroscientific studies -- show: if we fear us pass at least three things.</seg>
<seg id="359">"we rather accept an authoritarian government system, conformity and prejudices."</seg>
<seg id="360">"a study shows: when one reports messages in which negative about Muslims were reported, they were rather military attacks on Muslim countries as well as the circumcision of the rights of American Muslims."</seg>
<seg id="361">This is not just an academic problem.</seg>
<seg id="362">"if you look at when the mood against Muslims was shot up -- between 2001 and 2013 -- then this happened three times, but never in connection with terrorist attacks."</seg>
<seg id="363">It happened in the run-up of Iraq war and during two electoral periods.</seg>
<seg id="364">"so Islamophobia is not simply the natural reaction to Muslim terror, as I expected."</seg>
<seg id="365">It can actually be a tool to manipulate the public in order to pollute the foundation of a free society that has reasonable and well informed citizens.</seg>
<seg id="366">The handling of Muslims is an early warning sign.</seg>
<seg id="367">We may feel it first but the toxic air of fear destroys us all.</seg>
<seg id="368">The assignment of collectivies is not only about having to explain themselves.</seg>
<seg id="369">"Deah and his wife Yusor were a young, married couple living in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, where both went to school."</seg>
<seg id="370">Deah was an athlete.</seg>
<seg id="371">"he was talented at the dental faculty, talented, promising..."</seg>
<seg id="372">"his sister would say to me that he was the most sweetest, generous person she knew."</seg>
<seg id="373">She visited him there and he showed her his CV. she was amazed and said:</seg>
<seg id="374">"when was such a young man from my brother?" ""</seg>
<seg id="375">"just a few weeks after the visit of Suzanne with her brother and wife, her neighbor, Craig Stephen Hicks, she was murdered, just like the sister of Yusor, Razan that was in the afternoon when he posted remarks against Muslims on his Facebook page."</seg>
<seg id="376">He shot eight times on Deah.</seg>
<seg id="377">Fanaticism can not only be immoral but also fatal.</seg>
<seg id="378">So back to the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="379">What happened after 9 / 11?</seg>
<seg id="380">Did we go to the mosque or were we safe at home?</seg>
<seg id="381">"we discussed it and for us it was no easy decision, because it was about which America we want to leave our children: one that would control us through fear, or one in which we can exercise our religion freely."</seg>
<seg id="382">We decided for the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="383">"with our son in the child seat, we sailed silently, with high pressure to the mosque."</seg>
<seg id="384">"I took him out, withdrew my shoes, went into the building hall, and what I saw was left."</seg>
<seg id="385">The hall was completely filled.</seg>
<seg id="386">"then the Imam made an announcement, thanked and welcomed our guests, because half of the meetings were Christians, Jews, Buddhists, atheists, believers and non-believers who came not to attack us, but to assist us."</seg>
<seg id="387">"at that moment, I am collapsed."</seg>
<seg id="388">These people were there because they had had courage and compassion for panic and prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="389">What will you choose?</seg>
<seg id="390">What will you choose at the moment of fear and fanaticism?</seg>
<seg id="391">Will you be sure to be sure?</seg>
<seg id="392">Or will you join those who think: we are better than those.</seg>
<seg id="393">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="394">Thank you very much!</seg>
<seg id="395">"Helen Walters: so, Dalia, you seem to have hit a nerve."</seg>

<seg id="397">What would you say to those people?</seg>
<seg id="398">"Dalia Mogahed: I would say, don't fool you. I am completely normal."</seg>

<seg id="407">"as a platform for handicraft, it is about to become a multi-billion dollar business."</seg>
<seg id="408">"control, environmental monitoring, photography, film and journalism: these are some of the possible applications for commercial drones."</seg>
<seg id="409">"before air packets penetrated into our social consciousness, an autonomous fleet of aircraft in the FRAC Centre in France has built a six-meter high tower from 1 500 bricks. some years ago, they began to fly with ropes."</seg>
<seg id="410">"by connecting, airplanes reach high speed and acceleration in confined spaces."</seg>
<seg id="411">You can also build self-winding structures.</seg>
<seg id="412">They have learned to carry loads to deal with turbulences and generally react to natural laws.</seg>
<seg id="413">Today we would like to show you some of our new projects.</seg>
<seg id="414">Our aim is to cross the limits of the possible in autonomous flight.</seg>
<seg id="415">"in order that a system works autonomously, it must know collectively, where the mobile objects are in space."</seg>
<seg id="416">"in our laboratory at ETH Zurich, we often use external cameras to find objects. this enables us to concentrate on the rapid development of dynamic tasks."</seg>
<seg id="417">"for today's demos we use a new localization technology from Verity Studios, a publisher of our laboratory."</seg>
<seg id="418">There are no external cameras.</seg>
<seg id="419">Each air machine has internal sensors to determine the position in the room to determine what the machine should do.</seg>
<seg id="420">"external commands can be found on the highest level, e.g." Start "and" land. ""</seg>
<seg id="421">This is a so-called recoil starter.</seg>
<seg id="422">A flying device that tries to beat two flies with a flap.</seg>
<seg id="423">"like other starters, it is efficient in a forward flight, much more efficient than helicopters in all their variations."</seg>
<seg id="424">"in contrast to most starters, it can float, and has great advantages in starting and landing, and is very versatile."</seg>
<seg id="425">"however, there is always a sweeping side."</seg>
<seg id="426">A limitation of hedge-starters is that they react sensitively to turbulences like wind bucks.</seg>
<seg id="427">We develop new controllers and algorithms to improve this.</seg>
<seg id="428">The idea behind it is that the airfield doesn't matter in which position the optimum position can be recovered and the performance can be improved by practicing.</seg>
<seg id="429">Okay.</seg>
<seg id="430">"during our research, we often ask ourselves fundamental abstract questions which advance to the core of the matter."</seg>
<seg id="431">Such a question would be: what is the smallest possible number of movable parts for controlled flights?</seg>
<seg id="432">There are practical reasons for wanting to know the answer to such a question.</seg>
<seg id="433">Helicopters are known as machines with a thousand moving parts that meet together to hurt you.</seg>
<seg id="434">"decades ago, trained pilots were able to fly remote-controlled aircraft flying only two movable parts: a propeller and a stern rudder."</seg>
<seg id="435">"recently, we discovered that flies with just one works."</seg>
<seg id="436">"this is the monospinner, the mechanically remote-operated flight unit. it was invented in short."</seg>
<seg id="437">"it has only a movable part, a propeller,"</seg>
<seg id="438">"no flaps, hinges and cross-rudder, no further actuators or control surfaces, only one propeller."</seg>
<seg id="439">"although it is mechanically simple, inside life happens very much so that it can fly stable and move around in the room."</seg>
<seg id="440">"however, it does not have the elegant algorithm of the stern-starters. to get it to fly, I have to throw it right."</seg>
<seg id="441">"the likelihood of throwing it right is small, so I'll show you a video that was filmed yesterday evening."</seg>
<seg id="442">"if the monospinner is an exercise in pleasure, this machine is here, the Omnihead with its eight propellers, an exercise in abundance."</seg>
<seg id="443">What to do with all this abundance?</seg>
<seg id="444">They see that it is only symmetrical.</seg>
<seg id="445">That is why it is ambivalent in its alignment.</seg>
<seg id="446">"by doing so, he receives the exceptional ability,"</seg>
<seg id="447">"move in the room in all directions, no matter which direction it is rotated or even how it rotates."</seg>
<seg id="448">"of course, it is complex, mainly in the area of interactive rivers of the eight propellers."</seg>
<seg id="449">"some can be seen in models, the rest is learned directly by flying."</seg>
<seg id="450">Let's see that.</seg>
<seg id="451">"if flying machines are to be part of our everyday life, they must be extremely safe and reliable."</seg>
<seg id="452">This machine is made up of two separate two propellers aircraft.</seg>
<seg id="453">This turns in clockwise direction</seg>
<seg id="454">And the other against clockwise.</seg>
<seg id="455">"when you build them together, they behave like a high-performance quadrocopter."</seg>
<seg id="456">"however, something wrong -- a motor or propeller drops off, the electronics or a battery -- can fly the machine further, even if restricted."</seg>
<seg id="457">We will now demonstrate that by making one half airworthy.</seg>
<seg id="458">The last demonstration examined synthetic swarms.</seg>
<seg id="459">"the large number of autonomous, coordinated units allows a range of aesthetic expression."</seg>
<seg id="460">We took commercially available micro-quadcopter -- each single weighs less than a slice of bread -- and equip it with localization technology and algorithms.</seg>
<seg id="461">Every unit knows where in the room it is and is self-controlled. therefore there is no upper limit.</seg>
<seg id="462">Hopefully these demonstrations motivate you to think about new revolutionary ideas.</seg>
<seg id="463">The particularly safe machine da drags wants to become a flying lampshade on Broadway.</seg>
<seg id="464">"of course, it is difficult to predict the influence of this technology."</seg>
<seg id="465">For types like us is the reward in the development and the act of creation.</seg>
<seg id="466">"it serves as a reminder, how wonderful and enchanting our universe is, and that it allows creative, clever creatures to form them in such a spectacular way."</seg>
<seg id="467">The fact that this technology has such massive commercial and economic potential is the icing on the i.</seg>

<seg id="469">"1.3 billion years ago, two black holes circled each other in a very far distant galaxy, they turned so the mass of three Suns in a tenth of a second in pure energy."</seg>
<seg id="470">"for this short moment, they lit brighter than all stars together in all galaxies of the whole of us known universe."</seg>
<seg id="471">It was a very big bang.</seg>
<seg id="472">But they did not set up their energy in the form of light --</seg>
<seg id="473">We finally speak of black holes.</seg>
<seg id="474">The entire energy was released into the space-time structure itself and the universe exploded in gravitational waves.</seg>
<seg id="475">Let us arrange the events for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="476">"more than 1.3 billion years ago, multi-cell life on Earth was created."</seg>
<seg id="477">"since then, the Earth has produced a lot: corals, fish, plants, dinosaurs, people and -- God stands for us -- even the internet."</seg>
<seg id="478">"about 25 years ago, a group decided particularly courageous -- Rai Weiss from MIT, Kip Thorne and Ronald Drever from Caltech -- to search for gravitational waves, which are caused by colliding black holes."</seg>
<seg id="479">Most of them kept them crazy.</seg>
<seg id="480">"but enough people recognized them as crazy geniuses, so that the US National Science Foundation funded their idea."</seg>
<seg id="481">"after decades of development, design, design and extremely hard work, they built the detector Ligo: the laser Interferometer- Gravitational-Observatory."</seg>
<seg id="482">"in the following period, the precision of Ligo could significantly increase what the recognition performance improved enormously."</seg>
<seg id="483">"therefore, it is now called Advanced Ligo."</seg>
<seg id="484">"at the beginning of September 2015, Ligo was launched for a last test run to clarify some minor, stubborn problems."</seg>
<seg id="485">"on 14 September 2015, only a few days after the detection of the detector, the gravitational waves of the two colliding black holes scaled through the earth."</seg>
<seg id="486">They went through you and me</seg>
<seg id="487">And also through the detector.</seg>
<seg id="488">Scott Hughes: only two moments in my life were more emotional than this:</seg>
<seg id="489">The birth of my daughter</seg>
<seg id="490">And the farewell from my death-sick father.</seg>
<seg id="491">"basically, these were the fruits of my life-work."</seg>
<seg id="492">"AA: this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hughes, theoretical physicist at MIT. he has been investigating gravitational waves from black holes and her by observatories like ligo measurable signals. but what are gravitational waves?"</seg>
<seg id="493">A gravitational wave is a crack in the structure of space and time.</seg>
<seg id="494">"when passing the shaft, the room and its entire contents are stretched in one direction and the other is stened."</seg>
<seg id="495">"for illustration, lecturers in courses for relativity often perform a properly albering dance."</seg>
<seg id="496">"stretch and dust, stretch and dust."</seg>
<seg id="497">"the problem is that gravitational waves are extremely weak, even ridiculous."</seg>
<seg id="498">"on the 14th of September, for example, each of us was stretched and stened by us during the meeting of the waves. the elongation of an average man was 10 high -21."</seg>
<seg id="499">"that means 20 zeros after the comma, followed by 1."</seg>
<seg id="500">"with a five kilometer long laser detector, and that is absurd, this length would have to be measured in less than a thousandth of the radius of a nuclear nucleus. this is grotesque."</seg>
<seg id="501">At the end of his classic text about gravitation</seg>
<seg id="502">"Kip Thorne, a co-founder of Ligos, described the hunt for the waves as follows:" the technical difficulties in building such detectors are enormous. "</seg>
<seg id="503">But physicists are inventive and with the support of the public will certainly overcome all obstacles. "</seg>
<seg id="504">"Thorne published this 1973, 42 years before his success."</seg>
<seg id="505">Back to Ligo. Scott likes to claim that Ligo is more an ear than an eye.</seg>
<seg id="506">I want to explain what this means.</seg>
<seg id="507">"visible light has a wavelength, which is much smaller than things around us: facial features, the size of your cell."</seg>
<seg id="508">This is quite practical. because so you can make a picture or a map of things by perceiving the light coming from several points around you.</seg>
<seg id="509">"in the case of sounds, this is different."</seg>
<seg id="510">Audible sounds have a wavelength of up to 15 meters.</seg>
<seg id="511">"that's why it is very difficult, actually impossible to produce a picture of things that mean a lot to you:"</seg>
<seg id="512">About the face of your child.</seg>
<seg id="513">"instead we listen to certain properties such as pitch and height, rhythm and volume to close the story behind it."</seg>
<seg id="514">"now is talking about Alice."</seg>
<seg id="515">"and Bob interrupts them."</seg>
<seg id="516">"shooter Bob." ""</seg>
<seg id="517">The same applies to gravitational waves.</seg>
<seg id="518">We cannot produce any simple images of objects in space with them.</seg>
<seg id="519">"but considering changes in the amplitude and frequency of the waves, we can listen to their stories."</seg>
<seg id="520">At least for Ligo the measured frequencies are in the audible area.</seg>
<seg id="521">"so if we convert wave pattern in sound, we can literally hear the all literally."</seg>
<seg id="522">"to listen to the gravity, about the collision of two black holes can tell us about the collision of two black holes, which my colleague Scott has been busy for a long time."</seg>
<seg id="523">"SH: two black, non-rotating holes, just run: wupp!"</seg>
<seg id="524">"turning the two bodies very fast, one hears the same pen with an additional sound change. that sounds like this: Wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu!"</seg>
<seg id="525">It is a kind of movement vocabulary that shapes the waveform.</seg>
<seg id="526">"AA: on September 14, 2015 -- a date that at least I will never forget -- heard Ligo: [Surrender] Nobody, who knows what to hear, this recognizes as a sound of -- SH:... two black holes with 30-fold sun mass, which turn around as quickly as the rods of your mixer."</seg>
<seg id="527">AA: let's think about what this means.</seg>
<seg id="528">"two black holes, the densest body in the universe, one with a mass of 29 Suns, the other with a mass of 36 suns, orbiting a hundred times a second before they collide."</seg>
<seg id="529">Imagine these forces.</seg>
<seg id="530">Fantastic.</seg>
<seg id="531">And we know of it because we heard it.</seg>
<seg id="532">There is the abiding significance of Ligo.</seg>
<seg id="533">Ligo paves a completely new way to explore the universe as it was never possible before.</seg>
<seg id="534">On this way we can listen to the universe and hear the invisible.</seg>
<seg id="535">Much in all we can -- practically or basically -- not see.</seg>
<seg id="536">"a supernova, for example. I would like to know why masserie stars explode in supernovae."</seg>
<seg id="537">They are very useful. of them we have learned a lot about the universe.</seg>
<seg id="538">"however, the exciting physical processes happen in the core, which lies behind thousands of kilometres of iron, carbon and silicon."</seg>
<seg id="539">We will never go through because these opak are.</seg>
<seg id="540">"gravitational-waves penetrate iron, as if it were transparent glass."</seg>
<seg id="541">"using gravitational waves, it should be possible to look back to the beginning."</seg>
<seg id="542">"the most important thing: I am optimistic that in all things we have never seen, which we will never see and of which we have no idea. things we only discover by listening."</seg>
<seg id="543">"in fact, Ligo found things that we did not expect."</seg>
<seg id="544">"my colleague at MIT, Matt Evans, an important member of the Ligo project, says: me: the kind of stars that produce black holes, such as Ligo they are watching are the dinosaurs of the universe."</seg>
<seg id="545">"they are enormous, ancient bodies of prehistoric times. the black holes are the Saurierknochen for our archaeological work so to speak."</seg>
<seg id="546">"Ligo makes us a completely different angle on the events in space, to the emergence of the stars and ultimately on how we emerged from this chaos."</seg>
<seg id="547">AA: the challenge now is to be as courageous as possible.</seg>
<seg id="548">"thanks to Ligo, we know how to build great detectors and listen to the noise and circulation of the cosmos."</seg>
<seg id="549">We need ideas for new observatories -- a new generation of observatories on Earth and in space.</seg>
<seg id="550">For what could be more beautiful than to listen to the Big Bang?</seg>
<seg id="551">Now is the time of great dreams.</seg>
<seg id="552">Dream with us.</seg>
<seg id="553">Thanks.</seg>
<seg id="554">Some time ago I tried out an experiment.</seg>
<seg id="555">"for a year I would say to all" "Yes!" "before I feared."</seg>
<seg id="556">"whether it made me nervous, brought me into unpleasant situations, I forced me to say" Yes. ""</seg>
<seg id="557">Did I want to talk to the public?</seg>
<seg id="558">"no, but yes!"</seg>
<seg id="559">Did I want to be live on TV?</seg>
<seg id="560">"no, but yes!"</seg>
<seg id="561">Did I want to start playing with the show?</seg>

<seg id="568">"but there was a certain yes, which changed my life deeply, on an unexpectedly kind. it began with a question of my little ones."</seg>
<seg id="569">"I have three incredible daughters, harper, Beckett, and Emerson. and Emerson, the youngest, called all" estimations, "of inexplicable reasons."</seg>
<seg id="570">As if it were a waitress from the south.</seg>

<seg id="572">"she asked me once, if I could play with her when I was on the go. and I said," Yes. ""</seg>
<seg id="573">This Yes was the beginning</seg>
<seg id="574">"from there, I always swears to play with them as soon as you ask me. no matter what I do, or where I go, I always say yes -- every single time."</seg>
<seg id="575">"almost. I'm not perfect, but I am very tired."</seg>
<seg id="576">"it has a magical effect on me, my children, on our family."</seg>
<seg id="577">"but it also has an amazing side effect: only recently I understood fully that the" "yes" "say to play with my children my career."</seg>
<seg id="578">I have a real dream job.</seg>
<seg id="579">"I am a author. I think things, awaken you to life."</seg>
<seg id="580">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="581">"Hallo,"</seg>
<seg id="582">I am a titanium.</seg>
<seg id="583">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="584">I create television. I produce television.</seg>
<seg id="585">"I do television, in a great style."</seg>
<seg id="586">In this TV season I am responsible for bringing about 70 hours of program into the world.</seg>
<seg id="587">"four TV programs, 70 hours of television. three to four shows are simultaneously in production."</seg>
<seg id="588">Each shipment contains hundreds of jobs that did not exist before.</seg>
<seg id="589">The budget for an episode of a TV channel can be between three and six million dollars.</seg>
<seg id="590">Let's say five.</seg>
<seg id="591">"a new episode every nine days of four shows, so all nine days 20 million dollar television, four TV programs, 70 hours TV, three broadcasts, which simultaneously in production are four, 16 episodes: how To Get Away With Murder, 10 episodes: the Catch, 70 hours of TV,"</seg>
<seg id="592">350 million dollars for a season.</seg>
<seg id="593">"in America, my TV series run on Thursday evening."</seg>
<seg id="594">"all over the world, my series runs in 256 regions in 67 languages for 30 million viewers."</seg>
<seg id="595">"my brain is global, and 45 of these 70 TV-hours are broadcasts that I created myself and not only produced, so still on top. I have to find time, really quiet, creative time to gather my fans around the camp fire and tell my stories."</seg>
<seg id="596">"four TV series, 70 hours television, three, sometimes four, shows at the same time in production, 350 million dollars, campfire around the world."</seg>
<seg id="597">Do you know who is still doing it?</seg>
<seg id="598">"no one, therefore I am a titanium."</seg>
<seg id="599">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="600">I would not like to impress you.</seg>
<seg id="601">"I say it because I know what you think if the word" "author" "falls."</seg>
<seg id="602">"I tell you that all of you who work so hard whether you are now a company, a country or a classroom, a business or a household, take me seriously when I say: I understand that in a dream job it's not about dreams."</seg>
<seg id="603">"it's all a job, all work, all reality, all blood, all sweat -- no tears."</seg>
<seg id="604">"I work much, hard and I love it."</seg>
<seg id="605">"if I'm deepened in the work, there is no other feeling."</seg>
<seg id="606">My work always creates a country out of nothing.</seg>
<seg id="607">"it is, when I set up troops, as I painted on a canvas."</seg>
<seg id="608">"as if you dream a high sound, I deliver a marathon."</seg>
<seg id="609">You feel like Beyoncé.</seg>
<seg id="610">And all that at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="611">I love to work.</seg>
<seg id="612">"it is creative, mechanically, exhausting and intoxicating, funny and disturbing, clinically and foolish, cruel and sensible. and the best thing about it is the sum."</seg>
<seg id="613">There is such a change in me when working well.</seg>
<seg id="614">"a buzz starts in my head, and it grows and grows, and the buzz sounds like a busy street, I could go for it forever."</seg>
<seg id="615">"many people assume that when I declare to them the sum, that I am persuaded to write to me that writing is a pleasure."</seg>
<seg id="616">"don't you understand me wrong, this does them."</seg>
<seg id="617">"but the sums -- when I began to work and to work and work, create, create and collaborate, I discovered this matter, this buzz, this energy."</seg>
<seg id="618">The sum is more than writing.</seg>
<seg id="619">The sum is action and activity. the sum is a drug.</seg>
<seg id="620">The sum is music. the sum is light and air.</seg>
<seg id="621">The sum is God's voice in my ear.</seg>
<seg id="622">"and if you have such a sum, then you cannot aspire to the size."</seg>
<seg id="623">"the feeling of being not different than to strive for size, no matter what price."</seg>
<seg id="624">This is called the sum.</seg>
<seg id="625">Or maybe it also means to be a workaholic.</seg>
<seg id="626">Maybe it's called genius.</seg>
<seg id="627">Maybe it is ego.</seg>
<seg id="628">Perhaps it is the fear of failure.</seg>
<seg id="629">I don't know.</seg>
<seg id="630">"I only know that I am not made for failure, and I only know that I love the sum."</seg>
<seg id="631">"I just want to tell you, I'm a titanium, and I know I don't want to ask it."</seg>
<seg id="632">"the more successful I will, the more broadcasts, the more episodes, the more work there is, the more work there, the more I write history, the more expectations there is."</seg>
<seg id="633">"the more I work to be successful, the more I have to work."</seg>
<seg id="634">And what did I say about work?</seg>
<seg id="635">"I love work, isn't it?"</seg>
<seg id="636">"the land that I create, the marathon that I run, the army, the linen, the high sound, the sums, the sums, the sums."</seg>
<seg id="637">I like this sum. I love the sum.</seg>
<seg id="638">I need the sums. I am the sum.</seg>
<seg id="639">Am I just this sum?</seg>
<seg id="640">And then the sums stopped.</seg>
<seg id="641">"overhauled, overloaded, overhauled."</seg>
<seg id="642">The sums stopped.</seg>
<seg id="643">Now my three daughters are accustomed to the truth that her mum is just a single work.</seg>
<seg id="644">"Harper tells people:" my mum will not be there, but you can write my Nanny. "</seg>
<seg id="645">"Emerson says:" "guess, I want to go to Shonda."</seg>
<seg id="646">They are the children of a Titans.</seg>
<seg id="647">They are baby titers.</seg>
<seg id="648">"they were 12, 3 and 1 when the sums stopped."</seg>
<seg id="649">The buzz of the engine was silent.</seg>
<seg id="650">I didn't love my job anymore. the engine was off.</seg>
<seg id="651">The sum did not come back.</seg>
<seg id="652">My swamp was broken.</seg>
<seg id="653">"I made the same things as ever: the same Titans work, 15 hours-days, penetrable weekends, no regret, nothing delegate, a titanium sleeps, does not exist, with full heart, clear eyes, whatever."</seg>
<seg id="654">But there was no sum.</seg>
<seg id="655">There was silence in me.</seg>
<seg id="656">"four TV programs, 70 hours, three productions at the same time, sometimes four."</seg>
<seg id="657">"four TV programs, 70 hours, three productions simultaneously..."</seg>
<seg id="658">I was the perfect Titan.</seg>
<seg id="659">"I was a preview Titan,"</seg>
<seg id="660">"everything was gray, I just had no fun anymore."</seg>
<seg id="661">And that was my life.</seg>
<seg id="662">Everything I did.</seg>
<seg id="663">I was the sum and the sum I was.</seg>
<seg id="664">"so what do you do, if that's what you do, the work you love, suddenly faded?"</seg>
<seg id="665">"I know some may think:" heul dich, stupid author-titanium. "</seg>
<seg id="666">"but you know you do it, you do it, you work, you love to be a teacher, a banker, a mother, a painter, Bill Gates, one loves just another and that gives a sum if you know the sum, if you stop the sum, who is you then?"</seg>
<seg id="667">What are you?</seg>
<seg id="668">What am I?</seg>
<seg id="669">Am I still a Titan?</seg>
<seg id="670">"when the song of my heart stops, I can survive in silence?"</seg>
<seg id="671">And then my "southern states waitress" poses a question.</seg>
<seg id="672">"I'm on the way out, late, and she says," "Mama, do you play?" ""</seg>
<seg id="673">And I want to say no more than to be aware of two things:</seg>
<seg id="674">"first, I have to say yes to everything and secondly, she didn't call me" guess. ""</seg>
<seg id="675">"they call no more" "guess". ""</seg>
<seg id="676">When is that happening?</seg>
<seg id="677">"I miss it when I'm Titan and my buzzing, and here everything changes in front of my own eyes."</seg>
<seg id="678">"and so she says," "Mama, do you play?" ""</seg>
<seg id="679">"and I say," Yes. ""</seg>
<seg id="680">There is nothing special about it.</seg>
<seg id="681">"we play and her sisters come across, we laugh a lot and I read quite dramatically from the book" Everybody Poops. ""</seg>
<seg id="682">Nothing extraordinary.</seg>
<seg id="683">"but it is outstanding because my pain and panic, in solitude and absence of sums, I can do nothing but fit out."</seg>
<seg id="684">I am focused.</seg>
<seg id="685">I am quiet.</seg>
<seg id="686">"the land I create, the marathon that I run, the army, the screen, the high sound - they no longer exist."</seg>
<seg id="687">"everything that exists are sticky fingers and moist kisses, delicate voices, wax crayons and the song in which it comes to releasing, or whatever the girl in" Die Eiskönigin. ""</seg>
<seg id="688">Peace and simplicity is everywhere.</seg>
<seg id="689">The air in this place is so scarce that I can hardly breathe.</seg>
<seg id="690">I can hardly believe that I breathe.</seg>
<seg id="691">Playing is the opposite of works.</seg>
<seg id="692">And I am happy.</seg>
<seg id="693">Something in me dissolves.</seg>
<seg id="694">A mental door opens and an energy stroke comes in.</seg>
<seg id="695">"and that's not immediately, but it happens it happened."</seg>
<seg id="696">I feel it.</seg>
<seg id="697">The sum comes slowly.</seg>
<seg id="698">"no full volume, hardly there, it's quiet, hardly audible, but it's there."</seg>
<seg id="699">"not the sum, but a sum."</seg>
<seg id="700">And now I feel like I would know a magical mystery.</seg>
<seg id="701">But let's stay with the matter.</seg>
<seg id="702">It is love. that's all.</seg>
<seg id="703">No magic. no secret. just love.</seg>
<seg id="704">It is something we have forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="705">"the sum, the working sums, the titanium dioxide, this is only the replacement."</seg>
<seg id="706">"if I ask you who you are, if I tell you who I am when I describe myself by means of shows and TV-hours and how functional my brain is, then I forgot what the real sum is."</seg>
<seg id="707">The sum is not a force and it is not labour-specific.</seg>
<seg id="708">It depends on the joy.</seg>
<seg id="709">The real sum depends on love.</seg>
<seg id="710">The sum is the current that comes from the livelihood.</seg>
<seg id="711">The real sum is self-confidence and peace.</seg>
<seg id="712">"the real sum ignores the pressure of history, the tasks to be done, the expectation and the pressure."</seg>
<seg id="713">The real sum is simple and original.</seg>
<seg id="714">"the real sum is God's voice in my ear, but perhaps God whispered to me the wrong words, for which God told me that I am a titanium?"</seg>
<seg id="715">It is just love.</seg>
<seg id="716">"we all need a little more love, much more love."</seg>
<seg id="717">"once my child wants to play with me, I will say yes."</seg>
<seg id="718">"I do this as a rule, so that I can free myself from any guilt as a workaholic."</seg>
<seg id="719">"it is law, I have no choice. I have no choice unless I want to hear the sum again."</seg>
<seg id="720">"I wish it would be so easy. I'm not good in playing, I don't like it."</seg>
<seg id="721">"I don't think about how to work, how to work."</seg>
<seg id="722">"the truth hurts,"</seg>
<seg id="723">But I don't like to play it.</seg>
<seg id="724">I always work because I love it.</seg>
<seg id="725">I prefer at work than at home.</seg>
<seg id="726">"this concession is painful, because what a man is working rather than to be home?"</seg>
<seg id="727">"well, I."</seg>
<seg id="728">"honestly, I call myself" Titan "--"</seg>
<seg id="729">I have to have problems.</seg>
<seg id="730">That I am too relaxed is none of it.</seg>
<seg id="731">"we rushed around in the garden, before and back, back and forth."</seg>
<seg id="732">"we make small dance parties,"</seg>
<seg id="733">We sing and play ball.</seg>
<seg id="734">We burst soap bubbles.</seg>
<seg id="735">"I feel mostly stiff, absent and confused."</seg>
<seg id="736">I always get ready for my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="737">But it is OK.</seg>
<seg id="738">"my children show me how to live, and the sum of the universe fills me."</seg>
<seg id="739">I play and play until I ask myself: why have we ever stopped playing with playing?</seg>
<seg id="740">You can also! do they always say yes if your child wants to play with you.</seg>
<seg id="741">"maybe you think me naïve, for a daydream."</seg>
<seg id="742">"you probably have right, but you can do it too!"</seg>
<seg id="743">You have time!</seg>
<seg id="744">And do you know why? they are not Rihanna or a Muppet show figure.</seg>
<seg id="745">Your child finds you less interesting than you think.</seg>
<seg id="746">There are only 15 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="747">"my little ones want to play with me at a maximum of 15 minutes, until they choose to do something else."</seg>
<seg id="748">"it is wonderful 15 minutes, but just 15 minutes."</seg>
<seg id="749">After 15 minutes a ladybird or biscuit replaces me.</seg>
<seg id="750">And talk to me my teens daughter for 15 minutes with me. am I mother of the year.</seg>
<seg id="751">"there are only 15 minutes, more do not need."</seg>
<seg id="752">Everyone can pick up 15 minutes at the track - even at a bad mood day!</seg>
<seg id="753">15 minutes at the play!</seg>
<seg id="754">"no mobile phone, no laundry, no deflection."</seg>
<seg id="755">The day is short: dinner to make the kids bed ready.</seg>
<seg id="756">But 15 minutes are inside!</seg>
<seg id="757">"my children are my well-being, my world. they don't have to be the children."</seg>
<seg id="758">It's not about playing with your own children. it's about pleasure.</seg>
<seg id="759">"in order to" "play" "in general."</seg>
<seg id="760">Treat yourself to the 15 minutes!</seg>
<seg id="761">Find out what you do well.</seg>
<seg id="762">Find it out and keep it.</seg>
<seg id="763">"I am not perfect in it. I fail and I siege. meet friends, read books, enjoy the day --"</seg>
<seg id="764">"want to play?" is short for everything I gave up when I got my first TV show when I was a Titan in training, when I wanted to surpass myself more and more. "</seg>
<seg id="765">15 minutes at the track why not take full 15 minutes?</seg>
<seg id="766">What can be wrong about it? nothing!</seg>
<seg id="767">The sums came back in my spare time. the sums seem to return when I don't work.</seg>
<seg id="768">Work does not work without games.</seg>
<seg id="769">"it takes time, but after a few months a door opens, the energy flows in and I find myself in my office. I listen to new ideas. I use it in full trains and love my work again."</seg>
<seg id="770">"I like the sum, but I don't love it."</seg>
<seg id="771">I don't need it.</seg>
<seg id="772">"I am not the sum, the sum is not me... no more."</seg>
<seg id="773">"soap bubbles and sticky fingers, dinner with friends."</seg>
<seg id="774">This is my sum.</seg>
<seg id="775">The buzz of life.</seg>
<seg id="776">The sums of love.</seg>
<seg id="777">"the sums of work are part of me, but just a part. and I am so grateful."</seg>
<seg id="778">"it's nice to me that I'm a titanium. I've never seen a titanium, the trip to Jerusalem."</seg>
<seg id="779">I said yes to less work and more games.</seg>
<seg id="780">And yet I have everything under control. my brain is still functional. my campfire is still burning.</seg>
<seg id="781">"the more I play, the happier I and my children."</seg>
<seg id="782">"the more I play, the more I feel as a good mother."</seg>
<seg id="783">"the more I play, the clearer my head."</seg>
<seg id="784">"the more I play, the better I work."</seg>
<seg id="785">"the more I play, the more I hear the sum."</seg>
<seg id="786">"the more I feel this buzz, the more this unusual, remaining, naked and new feeling of living in me wide. less titanium -- more I!"</seg>
<seg id="787">"the more I feel exactly this sum, the more I know who I am."</seg>
<seg id="788">"I am a author. I think things out, I wake up to life."</seg>
<seg id="789">"this is part of the job, which means living his dream."</seg>
<seg id="790">"this is the dream of this job,"</seg>
<seg id="791">For a dream job should be a little dreamy.</seg>
<seg id="792">I said 'Yes' to less work and more games.</seg>
<seg id="793">Titans have no chance here.</seg>
<seg id="794">"do you want to play?"</seg>
<seg id="795">Thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="796">I am Neurosurgical.</seg>
<seg id="797">Like most of my colleagues I have to do every day with human tragedies.</seg>
<seg id="798">"I know how your life can change from one second to another, after a severe stroke or after a car accident."</seg>
<seg id="799">"for us neurosurgeons it is very frustrating that the brain, unlike other body organs, has a very low ability to self-healing."</seg>
<seg id="800">"after a serious injury to the central nervous system, patients often have a permanent disability."</seg>
<seg id="801">This is probably the reason why I became functional neurosurgery.</seg>
<seg id="802">What is a functional neurosurgeon?</seg>
<seg id="803">A doctor trying to improve the nerve functions by various surgical measures.</seg>
<seg id="804">"they certainly have heard of one of the best known," deep-brain stimulation. "this implantifies an electrode deep in the brain to influence the circuits of neurons so that the neurological function has been improved."</seg>
<seg id="805">It really is an amazing technology. it has improved the fate of patients with Parkinson which suffered severe trembling and severe pain.</seg>
<seg id="806">"however, neuromodulation does not mean neuro healing."</seg>
<seg id="807">The dream of functional neurosurgeons is the recovery of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="808">In my opinion we approach this dream.</seg>
<seg id="809">I want to show you that we are very close to it.</seg>
<seg id="810">With some help the brain can help itself.</seg>
<seg id="811">History began 15 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="812">At the time I was a senior doctor and worked day and night in the emergency room.</seg>
<seg id="813">I often supplied patients with skull-brain trauma.</seg>
<seg id="814">You have to imagine that at the skull-brain trauma the brain swells and the cranial pressure increases.</seg>
<seg id="815">"to save life, it is necessary to reduce the pressure of the skull."</seg>
<seg id="816">Sometimes you have to remove a part of swollen brain mass.</seg>
<seg id="817">"instead of throwing away the swollen brain mass, we decided to analyse the brain mass with Jean-François Brunet, one of my colleagues, a biologist."</seg>
<seg id="818">What do I mean by this?</seg>
<seg id="819">We wanted to let cells grow out of this tissue.</seg>
<seg id="820">This is not an easy task.</seg>
<seg id="821">"to grow cells from a tissue, is comparable to very small children that are taken out of your families."</seg>
<seg id="822">"you have to find the right diet, temperature, moisture and the surroundings to make it thrive."</seg>
<seg id="823">That was exactly what we had to do with these cells.</seg>
<seg id="824">"after many attempts, it made Jean-François."</seg>
<seg id="825">He saw this under his microscope.</seg>
<seg id="826">That was a big surprise for us.</seg>
<seg id="827">Why?</seg>
<seg id="828">"it looked exactly like a stem cell culture. with large green cells, surrounded by small, unripe cells."</seg>
<seg id="829">"you may still know from the teaching of biology, that stem cells are unripe cells that can turn into every cell type of the organism."</seg>
<seg id="830">"the adult brain has stem cells, but very few. they are hidden in deep, small niches of the brain."</seg>
<seg id="831">It is surprising to receive this kind of stem cells from the surface tissue of brain mass in the surgery.</seg>
<seg id="832">We made another fascinating observation: normal stem cells are very active -- they share very quickly.</seg>
<seg id="833">They never die; they are immortal.</seg>
<seg id="834">But these cells behaved differently.</seg>
<seg id="835">They shared slowly and after a few weeks they even died.</seg>
<seg id="836">"so we saw a new, strange cell population that looked like stem cells, but behaved differently."</seg>
<seg id="837">We needed a long time to understand where they came from.</seg>
<seg id="838">They come from these cells.</seg>
<seg id="839">These blue and red cells are called doublecortin-positive cells.</seg>
<seg id="840">We all have them in our brain.</seg>
<seg id="841">They make 4% of our brain-brain cells.</seg>
<seg id="842">They play a very important role in our development.</seg>
<seg id="843">At the stage of the fetus they provide for the folding of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="844">But why are they left us?</seg>
<seg id="845">We do not know this.</seg>
<seg id="846">We believe that they participate in the healing of the brain as we find them close to brain injuries at higher concentrations.</seg>
<seg id="847">But this is not so safe.</seg>
<seg id="848">"however, one thing is clear -- from these cells we received our stem cells."</seg>
<seg id="849">"we stand in front of a potential cell source, which enables brain healing."</seg>
<seg id="850">We had to prove this.</seg>
<seg id="851">So we decided to develop an experiment.</seg>
<seg id="852">We wanted to remove a piece of brain mass from the non-linguistic area and then cultivate the cells exactly as it did Jean-François</seg>
<seg id="853">And then mark them colourfully to be able to track them in the brain.</seg>
<seg id="854">"in the last step, we plagued them at the reception of the same individual."</seg>
<seg id="855">We call the autologous transplant -- Autotransplantation.</seg>
<seg id="856">One of our first questions was: what happens when we mating these cells into normal brain tissue? and what will happen when we matured the same cells in damaged brain tissue?</seg>
<seg id="857">"thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rouiller, we were able to work with apes."</seg>
<seg id="858">"in the first scenario we plagued the cells into a healthy brain, and we observed that after a few weeks they were completely disappeared, they would go back home. the room is already occupied, they are not needed there, so they disappear."</seg>
<seg id="859">In the second scenario we were able to hurt and irritate exactly the same cells and now the cells were preserved -- they grew up to mature neurons.</seg>
<seg id="860">Here you see what we could observe under the microscope.</seg>
<seg id="861">These are the cells that were matured.</seg>
<seg id="862">"the evidence they show are these little points. these are the cells, which we dyed in vitro, in culture."</seg>
<seg id="863">"of course, we could not stop here."</seg>
<seg id="864">Do these cells also help a monkey to recover from a brain injury?</seg>
<seg id="865">So we trained monkeys with a manual skill task.</seg>
<seg id="866">They had to take feed pellets from one tablet.</seg>
<seg id="867">They made them very good.</seg>
<seg id="868">"when they had reached a stable level of skill, we were injured in the motor-motor cortex."</seg>
<seg id="869">"then the monkeys were paralyzed, they couldn't move their hand anymore."</seg>
<seg id="870">"just as it would happen with people, they recovered spontaneously to a certain degree, just like after a stroke."</seg>
<seg id="871">"patients are paralysed and then they try to recover with the help of plastic brain mechanisms. they recover to some degree, just as with the ape."</seg>
<seg id="872">"when we were certain that the monkey had reached its degree of spontaneous recovery, we implanted his own cells."</seg>
<seg id="873">On the left side they see the ape that recovered spontaneously.</seg>
<seg id="874">It can provide about 40% to 50% of its original performance from injury.</seg>
<seg id="875">It is not so precise and not so fast.</seg>
<seg id="876">"now see when we matured the cells: the same monkey, two months after the maturation."</seg>
<seg id="877">I can tell you that these were also very exciting results.</seg>
<seg id="878">Since that time we have found a lot more about these cells.</seg>
<seg id="879">We can freeze them and use them later.</seg>
<seg id="880">"we can use them in other neuropathological models, e.g. Parkinson's."</seg>

<seg id="882">I really hope that I can soon show you how the human brain gives us the means to heal itself.</seg>
<seg id="883">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="884">"Bruno Giussani: Jocelyne, that's wonderful, I'm sure that just now, several dozen people in the audience, maybe even the majority, think:" I know someone who can do that. "</seg>
<seg id="885">I definitely.</seg>
<seg id="886">"of course, the question is what the biggest obstacles are before you can start clinical trials involving human beings."</seg>
<seg id="887">"Jocelyne Bloch: the biggest obstacles are the authorities. starting from these fantastic results, one has to fill approximately two kilograms papers and forms to undergo this kind of studies."</seg>
<seg id="888">"BG: this is understandable, the brain is very delicate, etc."</seg>
<seg id="889">"JB: yes, but it takes a long time, a lot of patience and an almost professional team."</seg>
<seg id="890">"BG: looking into the future -- you have completed research and tried to get the permission to start the clinical trials. if you continue to look into the future, how many years it takes until someone can come to hospital, and this therapy will be available."</seg>
<seg id="891">JB: it's hard to say.</seg>
<seg id="892">"first, it depends on the approval of the clinical trial."</seg>
<seg id="893">Will it allow us the authority to start it soon?</seg>
<seg id="894">Then you have to carry out this study with a small group of patients.</seg>
<seg id="895">"it takes a long time to select the patient, perform the treatments and evaluate whether it is useful to make this kind of treatment."</seg>
<seg id="896">"after that, you have to apply it to a multi-centric study."</seg>
<seg id="897">You must first really prove that it is useful before you can offer this treatment to anyone.</seg>
<seg id="898">"BG: and that it is safe, of course. JB: of course."</seg>
<seg id="899">"BG: Jocelyne, thank you for visiting TED and that you told us about it."</seg>

<seg id="901">Democracy.</seg>
<seg id="902">We in the West make a great mistake to consider them as a matter of course.</seg>
<seg id="903">"we do not see democracy as the fragile plant which it is in reality, but as an inventory of our society."</seg>
<seg id="904">We tend to look at them as an immutable devotion.</seg>
<seg id="905">We believe capitalism inevitably leads to democracy.</seg>
<seg id="906">Date: 06 / 13 / 2009</seg>
<seg id="907">"Lee Kuan Yew from Singapore and his great aftermath in Beijing proved without doubt that it is quite possible to have a flourishing capitalism and an impressive growth, while politics remains completely undemocratic."</seg>
<seg id="908">"in fact, democracy disappears with us, in Europe."</seg>
<seg id="909">"at the beginning of the year, when I represented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- was unambiguous for me as a finance minister in the Eurogroup -- that the democratic process of our country -- our elections -- not the austerity programs that have been realized in Greece."</seg>
<seg id="910">"at this moment, I thought that there could be no better justification for Lee Kuan Yew or the Communist Party of China, or some of my sincere friends who told me that democracy would be abolished if it would change anything."</seg>
<seg id="911">"at this point, I would like to introduce you an economic model for real democracy."</seg>
<seg id="912">"please, together with me, to believe that Lee Kuan Yew, the Communist Party of China and even the Eurogroup, we could save democracy, but that we need a true and defensive democracy."</seg>
<seg id="913">"for without democracy, our societies are in common, our future dark, and our great, new technologies are wasted."</seg>
<seg id="914">"on the subject of waste, I would like to point out to an interesting contradiction, which is currently under threat to our economies."</seg>
<seg id="915">I call it the "twin tops paradox."</seg>
<seg id="916">"one summit is known to you. you know and recognize him as the debt mountain, which throws its long shadow over the USA, Europe and the whole world."</seg>
<seg id="917">"we all know the debt mountain,"</seg>
<seg id="918">But only a few recognize his twin.</seg>
<seg id="919">"a mountain of unused cash, which belongs to the wealthy asparagus and corporations, which could be fearful, where it would be productive and income that could produce the debt, for example" green "energy."</seg>
<seg id="920">I call them two numbers.</seg>
<seg id="921">"over the past 3 months, 3.4 trillion US dollars were invested in the United States, England and the Eurozone, in all the wealth produced goods such as industrial plants, machinery, office buildings, schools, roads, tracks, equipment and so on."</seg>
<seg id="922">"3.4 trillion US dollars sounds like a lot of money until you compare it with the 5,1 trillion US dollars that were at the same time in the same countries and our financial institutions, and absolutely nothing, except the stock exchanges to awaken and the real estate prices."</seg>
<seg id="923">"thus, debts and unproductive capital form the twins that cannot be compensated by the usual market mechanisms."</seg>
<seg id="924">"the result is stagnating wages, more than a quarter of 25-54 year olds in the United States, Japan and Europe, and consequently a low demand for the pessimism of investors, which could be true that his son would kill him when he is growing,"</seg>
<seg id="925">"unintentionally causes the circumstances, which cause Ödipus kills him."</seg>
<seg id="926">This is my sharpen with capitalism --</seg>
<seg id="927">"his very wasteful article All the unproductive capital should be used to improve our lives, develop human talents, and to finance especially all the technologies," green "technologies that are crucial for the salvation of the earth."</seg>
<seg id="928">Is democracy the solution?</seg>
<seg id="929">"but before we continue, what do we mean under democracy?"</seg>
<seg id="930">Aristotle defined democracy as the form of society in which the free and the poor as a majority control the government.</seg>
<seg id="931">"of course, Athenian democracy included too many."</seg>
<seg id="932">"women, foreigners, and of course slaves."</seg>
<seg id="933">"however, it would be a mistake to reduce the significance of Athenian democracy on account of these exclusions."</seg>
<seg id="934">"the decisive thing about the athenical democracy was and is that they imposed the working poor, not only the right to freedom of expression, but more important and decisive, which they grant them the right to political participation with the same vocal weighting in matters of state matters."</seg>
<seg id="935">"indeed, Athenian democracy has not been held long ago --"</seg>
<seg id="936">"like a candle, which glows very bright, it is also quickly burnt out."</seg>
<seg id="937">"however, our liberal democracies do not have their roots in ancient Athens,"</seg>
<seg id="938">"but in the Magna Carta, in the glorious revolution of 1688, even in the American constitution."</seg>
<seg id="939">"while the Palestinian democracy concentrated on the free citizens and strengthening the working poor, our liberal democracy is based on the values of Magna Carta, which ultimately was a statute for rulers."</seg>
<seg id="940">"for the liberal democracy only arose when a complete separation of politics and economy is possible and the democratic process was limited to politics, while the economy -- so the world of corporations -- became a democratized zone."</seg>
<seg id="941">"in our modern democracies, since the time that this separation of politics and economy began, a relentless struggle between the two took place by gradually moving the policy and escapes it."</seg>
<seg id="942">Do you wonder why politicians are no longer the same as before?</seg>
<seg id="943">It is not a degeneration of their DNA.</seg>
<seg id="944">"it is because it is possible to be in the government nowadays, and yet not in power, because the power of politics is immigrated into the economy and the areas are separated."</seg>
<seg id="945">I mentioned my hair with capitalism.</seg>
<seg id="946">"if you think about it, it is like a herd of carnivores that are so sustainably the animals, of which they eat, decimated that they are starving at the end."</seg>
<seg id="947">"the power of the corporations is growing, political goods are being exploited, political goods are being exploited, political goods are being devalued, the economic demand falls, and the directors of the corporations are too frightened to invest the cash of their companies."</seg>
<seg id="948">"the more successful of capitalism the" demos "of democracy expels, the higher the twin peaks, and the greater the waste of human labour power and the well-being of mankind."</seg>
<seg id="949">"if this is true, it is obvious that we must bring back the policy and the economy, and it would be better if the" Demos "retains control, as in ancient Athens, apart from exclusion of slaves, women and foreigners."</seg>
<seg id="950">"by the way, this is not a new idea."</seg>
<seg id="951">The Marxist Left had already had this idea 100 years ago and it was not very good.</seg>
<seg id="952">The teaching from the debacle of the Soviet Union should be that the working poor only regain a position as in ancient Athens without creating new species of brutality and wastefulness.</seg>
<seg id="953">But there is a solution: abolish the working poor!</seg>
<seg id="954">Capitalism does it by replacing low wage workers by automation and robots.</seg>
<seg id="955">"the problem is, as long as business and politics are separate areas, automation makes the twin peaks higher, the wastefulness of a waste, and social conflicts are deeper, just as it is already very soon as I believe -- in countries like China."</seg>
<seg id="956">"so we need to transform the economy and reunite the areas of economy and politics, and to ensure that we are democratizing the re-unified field, otherwise we end up in a pathological surveillance hype autocracy that leaves the film" Matrix "as a documentary."</seg>
<seg id="957">"the question is not, whether capitalism will survive the technical achievements that he has produced, will survive --"</seg>
<seg id="958">"the most interesting question is whether capitalism is solved by a dystopia, similar to the" Matrix, "similar to the" Matrix, "or something that the society is in" star Trek, "or in a high-tech version of the ancient Athener" Agora, "in long discussions with the meaning of life."</seg>
<seg id="959">I think we must be optimistic.</seg>
<seg id="960">"so what would it be, how could it look, have this" Star Trek "unique utopia instead of the" Matrix "similar dystopia?"</seg>
<seg id="961">"in practical implementation, I would like to give you some examples."</seg>
<seg id="962">"in the area of companies, please introduce a capital market where you earn money while you work and in which your capital works from one company to the next, and the company -- no matter what you currently work -- is the property of those who are currently working in the company."</seg>
<seg id="963">Then all income from capital and redeeming and the concept of wage labor is completely overhauled.</seg>
<seg id="964">"no distinction between those who belong to the company, but who do not work in it, and employees working there, which the company does not belong to. no more exchange between capital and labour, no large gaps between investment and savings, and ultimately no open twins."</seg>
<seg id="965">"in the field of global political economy: imagine that our national currencies would have a freely fluctuating exchange rate, in a universal, global, digital currency issued by the IMF [International Monetary Fund] and the G-20 [group of 20 largest emerging countries], in the interests of all humanity."</seg>
<seg id="966">"imagine that the entire world trade is traded in this currency -- we call it" the cosmos, "in units of" Cosmos "-- and each government pays the sum that corresponds to the trade deficit or trading surplus of the respective country into a common fund."</seg>
<seg id="967">"imagine that this fund is investing in" green "technologies, especially in parts of the world where investment funds are rare."</seg>
<seg id="968">This is not a new idea.</seg>
<seg id="969">It is basically what John Maynard Keynes proposed in the Bretton Woods Conference from 1944.</seg>
<seg id="970">The problem was that at that time it was not the technical means to implement it.</seg>
<seg id="971">"today, we have them, especially in the background of a reunified politics and economy."</seg>
<seg id="972">"the world I describe is at the same time liberated, in which they favored privileged persons, and Marxist, because they have buried the separation of capital and labour in the womb of history, and Keynesian, global keynesianese."</seg>
<seg id="973">But above all else it is a world in which we can imagine real democracy.</seg>
<seg id="974">Will we awaken in such a world</seg>
<seg id="975">Or will we sink into a "matrix" - similar dystopia?</seg>
<seg id="976">The answer depends on how we decide together politically.</seg>
<seg id="977">It is in our hands and we do it better democratic.</seg>
<seg id="978">Thanks.</seg>
<seg id="979">Bruno Giussani: Yanis...</seg>
<seg id="980">You write yourself in your biography itself as the liberal Marxists.</seg>
<seg id="981">How relevant is Marx's analysis today?</seg>
<seg id="982">"Yanis Varoufakis: if anything of what I just said is relevant, then Marx is relevant."</seg>
<seg id="983">"the reason for the reunification of politics and economy is... Do we not do that, technological development will generate such a massive decline in macroeconomic demand, which Larry Summers referred to as" long-term stagnation. ""</seg>
<seg id="984">"by transferring this crisis from a part of Earth to the next as we are experiencing it, it will not only destabilise our democracies but also the countries whose interest in liberal democracy is low."</seg>
<seg id="985">"if this analysis is true, Marx is quite relevant,"</seg>
<seg id="986">"just like Hayek, that is why I am a liberal Marxist, and like Keynes, and that's why I am also perfect."</seg>
<seg id="987">"BG: actually, and now we are well."</seg>
<seg id="988">"YV: if you don't, you don't think enough."</seg>
<seg id="989">"BG: this is a very Greek, a kind of philosophical statement -- YV: actually it was Einstein who said this."</seg>
<seg id="990">Would you like to repeat it here?</seg>
<seg id="991">YV: there is a great deal of hypocrisy.</seg>
<seg id="992">In our liberal democracies we have the appearance of democracy.</seg>
<seg id="993">"as I said in my lecture, we have limited democracy to politics, while the area where most of it plays, -- the area of economy -- a totally democratic-free zone."</seg>
<seg id="994">"in certain respects, if I can say so provocative, China is similar today to the England of the 19th century."</seg>
<seg id="995">"for -- remember -- we tend to connect liberalism with democracy -- this is a mistake, historically considered."</seg>
<seg id="996">"liberalism, Liberals, such as John Stuart Mill --"</seg>
<seg id="997">He was particularly sceptical about the democratic development.</seg>
<seg id="998">"what we can see now in China is very similar to the development we had in England during the industrial revolution, especially the transition from the first to the second."</seg>
<seg id="999">"China now accustomed to do what the West has done in the 19th century, smells mightily to hypocrisy."</seg>
<seg id="1000">BG: I am sure that many listeners are curious about your experiences as the finance minister of Greece at the beginning of the year.</seg>
<seg id="1001">YV: I thought that was coming.</seg>
<seg id="1002">BG: yes...</seg>
<seg id="1003">How do you look back six months later on the first half-year?</seg>
<seg id="1004">"YV: very exciting, from personal point of view, and very disappointing because we had the opportunity to make a new beginning with the eurozone,"</seg>
<seg id="1005">"not only Greece, but the Eurozone,"</seg>
<seg id="1006">"to say goodbye to us from self-sufficiency, and the constant denial that a massive fraud line ran through the eurozone, and continues to be massively threatened by the development of the whole European Union."</seg>
<seg id="1007">"we had the opportunity, on the basis of the Greek proposal -- by the way, the first proposal that revealed this denial --"</seg>
<seg id="1008">"unfortunately, the powers within the eurozone, within the European group, still have chosen denial."</seg>
<seg id="1009">But you know what is coming.</seg>
<seg id="1010">This is the experience of the Soviet Union --</seg>
<seg id="1011">"if you try to maintain an economic system that is not viable through political will and authoritarianism in life, it may be delayed for a while, but when the change occurs, it happens abruptly and destructive."</seg>
<seg id="1012">BG: what change are you looking for?</seg>
<seg id="1013">YV: there is no doubt that the Eurozone does not have a future if we do not change its structure.</seg>
<seg id="1014">BG: did you make any mistakes in your time as finance minister?</seg>
<seg id="1015">YV: every day.</seg>
<seg id="1016">"BG: for example? YV: anyone looking back -- seriousness..."</seg>
<seg id="1017">"if there is a finance minister or any minister, who is in office after 6 months in office, especially in such a tense situation, claiming that he did not make a mistake, then this is a dangerous person."</seg>
<seg id="1018">Of course I made mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="1019">The greatest mistake was to sign the application for the extension of the debt programme at the end of February.</seg>
<seg id="1020">I believed that there was an honest interest in the donors to find a common solution.</seg>
<seg id="1021">But that was not.</seg>
<seg id="1022">"they just wanted to bring our government down, just because they didn't want to deal with the debts that were going through the eurozone."</seg>
<seg id="1023">They did not want to admit that they had been a catastrophic programme in Greece for 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="1024">We lost one third of our nominal GDP.</seg>
<seg id="1025">It is worse than during the "Great Depression."</seg>
<seg id="1026">"nobody from the troika of the financiers imposed on us this policy was:" "this was a colossal mistake."</seg>
<seg id="1027">"BG: despite all this, and despite the aggressive tone of conversations, you seem to be quite pro-European."</seg>
<seg id="1028">YV: absolutely.</seg>
<seg id="1029">My criticism of the European Union and the Eurozone is faced by someone who lives and loves Europe.</seg>
<seg id="1030">My biggest fear is that the Eurozone does not survive.</seg>
<seg id="1031">"for if they do not survive, the liberated centrifugal forces will be demonic and destroy the European Union."</seg>
<seg id="1032">"this will not have catastrophic consequences for Europe alone, but for the global economy."</seg>
<seg id="1033">We are probably the strongest economy in the world.</seg>
<seg id="1034">"if we allow ourselves to introduce the way of a post-modern 1930, after which it seems to me it will be as bearable for the future of Europeans and non-Europeans."</seg>
<seg id="1035">BG: we hope that you are wrong at this point.</seg>

<seg id="1038">"by Roy Price most of them have never heard, although he probably is responsible for 22 moderate minutes of your life on 19 April 2013."</seg>
<seg id="1039">"probably also for 22 very entertaining minutes, but not for many of you."</seg>
<seg id="1040">That goes back to the decision that Roy met three years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1041">"Roy Price is Manager at Amazon Studios,"</seg>
<seg id="1042">The TV production company from Amazon.</seg>
<seg id="1043">"he is 47 years old, slim, has an igelhorn and describes himself on Twitter as" films, TV, technology, tacos. "</seg>
<seg id="1044">Roy has a very important job because he is responsible for checking the shows and the content that Amazon will produce.</seg>
<seg id="1045">"of course, this is a very hard-fought sector."</seg>
<seg id="1046">There are so many TV series that Roy can't select any one.</seg>
<seg id="1047">"he has to find shows that are very, very good."</seg>
<seg id="1048">"in other words, he must find shows that are right on this curve."</seg>
<seg id="1049">This curve is the evaluation distribution of over 2500 TV series on the IMDB website. the rating is from 1 to 10 and the height shows how many shows receive this review.</seg>
<seg id="1050">"if your show is rated with nine and higher, this is a winner."</seg>
<seg id="1051">Then you have a successful show.</seg>
<seg id="1052">"these are shows like" Breaking Bad, "" Game of Thrones, "" The Wire "-- all the shows that addicts addicted to where after a season has looked, your brain asks:" where are there more of these episodes? "</seg>
<seg id="1053">This kind of show.</seg>
<seg id="1054">"on the left side, here at this end, shows like" Toddlers and Tiaras "-- -- this should tell you enough what is going on at this end of the curve."</seg>
<seg id="1055">"Roy Price does not worry about getting on the left side of the curve, because I think you already need special intelligence to sign" Toddlers and Tiaras. ""</seg>
<seg id="1056">"he makes more thoughts on average excitation, average television -- the shows that are neither good nor bad, they just don't inspire them."</seg>
<seg id="1057">So he must make sure that he is really on the right side.</seg>
<seg id="1058">"the print is present, and of course it's the first time that Amazon is doing something, so Roy Price does not want to risk anything."</seg>
<seg id="1059">He wants to create achievements.</seg>
<seg id="1060">"he needs guaranteed success, so he keeps a competition."</seg>
<seg id="1061">"he takes many ideas for TV shows and chooses through an evaluation of eight candidates for TV shows, then he produces the first episode of each of these shows and makes them online, where they can look for free."</seg>
<seg id="1062">"and if Amazon releases things for free, does one intervene correctly?"</seg>
<seg id="1063">Millions of viewers watch these episodes.</seg>
<seg id="1064">"however, they do not know they are watching when watching these shows."</seg>
<seg id="1065">They are observed by Roy and his team who record everything.</seg>
<seg id="1066">"you capture when you start the show when you pause, which parts you skip and look again."</seg>
<seg id="1067">You collect millions of data to decide which show you should produce with these data.</seg>
<seg id="1068">"in fact, they collect the data, process them, and this is the answer, and this is:" Amazon should make a Sitcom about four Republican US senators. "</seg>
<seg id="1069">They made this show.</seg>
<seg id="1070">Does anyone know the name of this show?</seg>
<seg id="1071">"yes," Alpha House, "but it seems that not many can remember this show because it wasn't that good."</seg>
<seg id="1072">"it is only an average show -- in the true sense of the word -- because the average of this curve is 7.4 and Alpha House lands at 7.5 -- so something above average, but not exactly what Roy and his team worked."</seg>
<seg id="1073">"at the same time with another company another manager has placed a top show through data analysis. his name is Ted, Ted Sarandos, the manager for programming of Netflix. just like Roy, he is always looking to find this a super show and he also uses data for it, but he makes it something different."</seg>
<seg id="1074">"instead of organizing a competition, he and his team looked at the present data on Netflix-viewers, so the ratings they give the shows, their course, what shows they like, etc."</seg>
<seg id="1075">"then they use these data to find out these little details about the audience: what shows they like, which producers, what actors."</seg>
<seg id="1076">"when they had all the parts together they went to a venture and decided not to do a Sitcom about four senators, but a drama series about a Senator."</seg>
<seg id="1077">Do you know this show?</seg>
<seg id="1078">"yes," House of Cards. "Netflix has landed a hit, at least for the first two seasons."</seg>
<seg id="1079">House of Cards "gets a 9.1 review on this curve. so exactly where they wanted.</seg>
<seg id="1080">Of course the question is: what happened here?</seg>
<seg id="1081">"you have two very competitive, data-sealed firms."</seg>
<seg id="1082">"they connect these many data together and it works great for one of them, but not for the other company."</seg>
<seg id="1083">What is that?</seg>
<seg id="1084">Because logic somehow states that it should work with everything.</seg>
<seg id="1085">"if you collect millions of data, for a decision you meet, you should make a good decision."</seg>
<seg id="1086">You have 200 years of statistics as back-up.</seg>
<seg id="1087">You can optimize it by a very powerful computer.</seg>
<seg id="1088">"what you can expect is good television, or?"</seg>
<seg id="1089">"if data analysis does not work so, it is a bit frightening because we live in a time in which we take more and more statistics to make serious decisions, far beyond television."</seg>
<seg id="1090">Does anyone know the company Multi-Health Systems?</seg>
<seg id="1091">"no one. OK, this is even good."</seg>
<seg id="1092">Multi-Health system is a software company and I hope that no one in this room ever comes into contact with this software. come in touch with you in prison.</seg>
<seg id="1093">"if someone is in prison here and asks for dismissal, it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine whether a discharge occurs or not."</seg>
<seg id="1094">"just like Amazon and Netflix. but instead of deciding if a show will be good or bad, it is decided whether a person will be good or bad."</seg>
<seg id="1095">"moderate TV, 22 minutes, this can be real bad, but even more years in prison are worse."</seg>
<seg id="1096">"unfortunately, there is evidence that this data analysis, despite the many data,"</seg>
<seg id="1097">Not always producing the best results. this is not because a company like multi-health system does not know how to use data.</seg>
<seg id="1098">Also the data of the most experienced companies are wrong.</seg>
<seg id="1099">"yes, even Google sometimes makes mistakes."</seg>
<seg id="1100">"in 2009, Google announced that it can predict data analysis outbreaks of influenza, the bad way -- through data analysis of Google searches."</seg>
<seg id="1101">It worked wonderfully and was a great news sensation. success culminated in a publication in the magazine "Nature."</seg>
<seg id="1102">"it worked fine, year around year, until it suddenly didn't work anymore,"</seg>
<seg id="1103">And no one could say why.</seg>
<seg id="1104">"it simply did not work, this was once again a sensation, including the revocation of publication in the magazine" Nature. ""</seg>
<seg id="1105">Even the data of the most experienced companies like Amazon and Google sometimes misunderstand something.</seg>
<seg id="1106">"despite all these errors, data clearly flows into decisions of life -- at the workplace, in the legal enforcement, in medicine."</seg>
<seg id="1107">So we should rather make sure that data are helpful.</seg>
<seg id="1108">"I also know many difficulties with data. I work in computer-aided genetics -- an area where some very clever people use unimaginable many data to make serious decisions, as the decision for a cancer therapy"</seg>
<seg id="1109">Or the development of a medication. over the years I recognized some patterns of the difference between successful decisions based on data and not successful decisions. this pattern should be distributed.</seg>
<seg id="1110">"if you need to solve a complex problem, do basically two things:"</seg>
<seg id="1111">"first, you dismantle this problem into its components so that you can analyze the items; as a second, you put the items together again to make a decision."</seg>
<seg id="1112">Sometimes you have to do this several times but there are always two things: take apart and put together again.</seg>
<seg id="1113">And now the most important thing: data and data analysis are just good for the first part.</seg>
<seg id="1114">"data and data analysis, no matter how powerful, can only help dismantle a problem and understand its parts."</seg>
<seg id="1115">They are not suitable to put the parts together again and then come to a decision.</seg>
<seg id="1116">"for this, there is another tool and we all possess it: our brain."</seg>
<seg id="1117">"if there is something in which the brain is good, it is parts and pieces to put together again, even if the information is incomplete, so that the information is incomplete -- especially if it is the brain of an expert."</seg>
<seg id="1118">"therefore, I believe, Netflix was so successful because they used data and minds, where they also belong in the process."</seg>
<seg id="1119">"they use data to better understand their audience, what else they wouldn't have been able to do. but the decision on how to put all these pieces back together and make a show like" House of Cards "which was not in the data."</seg>
<seg id="1120">Ted Sarandos and his team met this decision for this show which meant they had a great personal risk with this decision.</seg>
<seg id="1121">"Amazon, on the other hand, did this in the wrong way."</seg>
<seg id="1122">"they used data to control all their choices, first when they compete for TV ideas, then when they selected" Alpha House "as a show."</seg>
<seg id="1123">"it was a safe decision, because they could always say:" "that's what the data say to us."</seg>
<seg id="1124">It did not lead to the desired result.</seg>
<seg id="1125">"data are helpful for better decisions, but I think things go wrong when data start to control our decisions."</seg>
<seg id="1126">"no matter how powerful they are, data are just a tool, and in order to not forget it, this device is quite useful."</seg>
<seg id="1127">Many of you will...</seg>
<seg id="1128">"before there was data, this was the device for decisions."</seg>
<seg id="1129">Many know it.</seg>
<seg id="1130">"it is also called" "Magic 8 Ball". "it's amazing. for decisions using a Ja- or no question, you just need to shake the ball to get an answer." "most likely" "-- right here at this moment."</seg>
<seg id="1131">I will fencing it later with a technical demo.</seg>
<seg id="1132">"so far I have made some decisions in my life, whereby I should have heard the ball in the aftermath."</seg>
<seg id="1133">"but, as you naturally know if you have the data available, you would like to replace them with a much more sophisticated, such as data analysis to make better decisions."</seg>
<seg id="1134">But this does not change the basic structure.</seg>
<seg id="1135">"perhaps the ball is smarter and wiser and wiser. ultimately, it is up to us to make decisions when we want to reach something extraordinary at the end of the right curve."</seg>
<seg id="1136">"and I feel this as very encouraging message that despite the large amount of data still pays off to make decisions, an expert in what you are doing and risks."</seg>
<seg id="1137">"because in the end, it is not the data, but the risks that you land at the right end of the curve."</seg>
<seg id="1138">Thank you very much.</seg>
