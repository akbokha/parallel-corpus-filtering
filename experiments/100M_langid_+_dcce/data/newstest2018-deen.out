Munich 18@@ 56 : four maps that change your view of the city
a Ir@@ ren An@@ st@@ alt where young people are to meet today .
a cryp@@ t chapel that is now du@@ g for the S @-@ Bahn tunnel .
small gar@@ den@@ ers manage the former reason of farmers .
the oldest official map of Munich encourages exciting stories to days .
it anno@@ ys when maps are not up to date .
everybody knows everybody who had to stir up because the car @-@ Nav@@ i took a green meadow instead of a walk road .
&quot; the historical maps of the digital Bavaria @-@ At@@ las@@ es , an offer of the Ge@@ op@@ ort@@ als Bayern of the State Government , are anything but up @-@ to @-@ date - but very reve@@ aling . &quot;
especially if you compare them with current online maps .
then it becomes clear how cities and municipalities have changed in the spread @-@ area of the Munich Merk@@ ur since the 19th century .
the digital Bayern Atlas is a pat@@ ch@@ work that can be recognized as such .
&quot; the large picture postcard has been incorporated into towns and communities more detailed maps , so @-@ called prototype sheets . &quot;
these were created according to the Bay@@ erische surv@@ ey@@ ing administration between 18@@ 10 and 1864 and jump from the first surv@@ ey@@ ing of Bavaria .
your client : Napoleon .
the French army leader occupied Bavaria since the spring 1800 during the Second Coalition War with Austria .
Napoleon wanted an overview of the occupied country and commissioned a top@@ ographic survey of Bavaria - of course for military purposes .
&quot; finally , when the French troops mar@@ ched with the peace of Lun@@ é@@ ville on February 9 , 18@@ 01 : today &apos;s neighbours who created the idea of a nation@@ wide Bavaria Card . &quot;
&quot; Elec@@ tor Max IV . Joseph continued the project forward , founded the &quot; Top@@ ographic Bureau , &quot; and thus the Bay@@ erische surv@@ ey@@ ing management . &quot;
the reference sheet for Munich dates back to 18@@ 56 and is like all the others on the website of the Bavarian State Library .
the comparison of Early / Today is most impressive in the example of the state capital .
the city has expanded in all directions and has grown together .
an example of this is Unter@@ sen@@ d@@ ling that appears relatively isolated in the 18@@ 56 card .
&quot; Send@@ ling was founded 21 years after the map was created , i.e. 1877 , as a Munich district . &quot;
today Unter@@ sen@@ d@@ ling is located in the middle of the city .
&quot; the houses of Unter@@ sen@@ d@@ lings are concentrated around 18@@ 56 along the present Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser@@ straße , which was named after Georg Sebastian Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser in 1878 , a leader of the Executive Board of the Bavarian peasants against Austria 17@@ 05 . &quot;
&quot; where today the West@@ park is , you can see nothing but fields - at first glance : at the Hin@@ du@@ omen there is a smaller map with dozens of lines and numbers : hand@@ writing numbered fl@@ ings from the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; original recording &quot; &quot; from which the basic tax was derived . &quot;
small plots still show no farmers today - but small gar@@ den@@ ers of the plant &quot; Land in Sun . &quot;
a large green area is located north of Unter@@ sen@@ d@@ ling .
&quot; in the 19th century Ther@@ esi@@ en@@ wi@@ ese , since 18@@ 10 , was in fact still a meadow - and no concrete desert . &quot;
&quot; on the other side of the Is@@ ar , the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiat@@ ric medicine . &quot;
&quot; in the Ur@@ posi@@ tions@@ blatt , in the area of today &apos;s au @-@ Hai@@ d@@ hausen , one reads not only the street name &quot; &quot; at Gast@@ ei@@ g &quot; &quot; or from the hill &quot; &quot; On the air &quot; &quot; - but also in large letters &quot; Ir@@ ren An@@ st@@ alt . &quot; &quot;
&quot; yes , here at Au@@ er@@ feld@@ straße you once blocked people with ins@@ ane positions . &quot;
&quot; there was in 18@@ 58 / 59 the Munich district Ir@@ ren@@ anstalt &quot; &quot; On the Au@@ er Lü@@ nen &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; from 18@@ 72 Dr. Bernhard von Gu@@ dden conducted the institution - the psychiat@@ rist , who was brought in connection with the death of King Ludwig II . &quot;
&quot; he was advanced for his time and ended , for example , the chains of the so @-@ called Ir@@ ren . &quot;
&quot; he also instruc@@ ted the staff to apply violence against the occup@@ ants , &quot; &quot; says Hermann Wilhelm , head of the Museum Hai@@ d@@ hausen , who occupied himself for an exhibition with the institution . &quot;
&quot; for 280 patients , there was first place , later on 500 places were expanded . &quot;
&quot; at some point , this capacity was no longer enough - the reason for the construction of the chal@@ ee facility in hair 1905 . &quot;
&quot; since 2006 , there is the Is@@ ar @-@ Amp@@ er @-@ Klin@@ ikum in Munich @-@ Ost , one of the largest psychiat@@ ri@@ sts in Germany . &quot;
young people meet in Munich Sal@@ esi@@ an@@ um on the premises of the former Au@@ er An@@ st@@ alt .
the Order acquired the building complex in 1920 and turned him into a youth home with training facilities .
&quot; west is the football pitch of the TS@@ V Munich East , east of residential buildings from the 1980s . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 , the children &apos;s house &quot; Casa Don Bos@@ co &quot; was built in architectural interest in the original building of the Ir@@ ren@@ anstalt , which was destroyed during the Second World War in bom@@ bing attacks . &quot;
&quot; the Mari@@ en@@ platz was listed in 18@@ 56 as &quot; &quot; main square &quot; , &quot; the Kauf@@ ing@@ erst@@ raße was called &quot; Kauf@@ inger G@@ asse . &quot; &quot;
a decisive change brought the Second World War also in the heart of Munich .
the Bom@@ bs of the Al@@ lied tears in December 1944 found a lot of holes in the inner city .
a big remained until today - at the Mari@@ enhof .
&quot; the English Institute , small business houses and a pit chapel from the Middle Ages were once on the Mari@@ enhof , where these days were the pre @-@ work and on 5 April 2017 the ground@@ breaking ceremony for the second S @-@ Bahn line . &quot;
&quot; with the slider , the old Munich @-@ card can be compared to the aerial image of today - and fill the hole at the Mari@@ enhof . &quot;
civil Rights Group publishes travel warning for Mis@@ sour@@ i
the National Association for the Promotion of Far@@ es has issued a warning for coloured people travelling to Mis@@ sour@@ i due to the discri@@ min@@ atory policy and the rac@@ ist attacks of the State .
&quot; the NA@@ AC@@ P Travel Advisory for the State of Mis@@ sour@@ i , which will take effect until 28 August 2017 , calls for special attention to Afgh@@ an American travelers , visitors and Mis@@ sour@@ i@@ ans , as a number of question@@ able , rapid @-@ based occur@@ r@@ ences occur in recent times throughout the country and be noted here , &quot; it is said in the opinion of the group . &quot;
&quot; a recently adopted law of Mis@@ sour@@ i , which makes people harder to win discri@@ min@@ ations , as well as the prosecution authorities of the state that di@@ spro@@ por@@ tion@@ ate minorities , the NA@@ AC@@ P said . &quot;
they have violations of civil rights which people pass .
&quot; they are hal@@ ted or killed because of their skin colour , they are sm@@ itten or killed , &quot; said the President of Mis@@ sour@@ i NA@@ AC@@ P , Rod Chapel , K@@ ans@@ as City Star . &quot;
we hear complaints in such a frequency that we haven &apos;t heard yet .
it is the first such warning issued by the organization for a state in the US .
&quot; the group quoted inci@@ dents such as rac@@ ist crime against black students at the University of Mis@@ sour@@ i and death of T@@ ory S@@ anders , 28 , a black man from T@@ enn@@ es@@ see . &quot;
&quot; S@@ anders also died in question@@ able circumstances at the beginning of the year , having no more gasoline on the journey through the state and taken custo@@ dy by the Mis@@ sour@@ i police , without being accused of a crime . &quot;
the Council also points to a recent report of the Office of the Mis@@ sour@@ i At@@ tor@@ ney Office in which black drivers in the state are 75 percent more common than white ones .
&quot; the recommendation is that people are aware and inform their families , friends and staff about what could happen in Mis@@ sour@@ i , &quot; &quot; said Chapel . &quot;
people must be willing to bring it to ch@@ ew@@ ing money or make relatives know that they travel through the state .
&quot; Mis@@ sour@@ i recorded 100 hate crimes in 2015 , according to the latest figures from the hate crime report of the F@@ BI , which ranks the state in terms of the number of such injuries to the 16th position of the country . &quot;
&quot; the travel warning is also an answer to a new Mis@@ sour@@ i law , which would make it harder to su@@ e a company because of housing or employment discrimination . &quot;
&quot; previously , the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union ( AC@@ L@@ U ) had issued travel war@@ nings for Texas and Arizona , having adopted immigration laws to arrest people because of immigration violations , which will contribute to the view of AC@@ L@@ U for further race profil@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; travel war@@ nings are usually issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for other countries , but l@@ ately , interest groups have used the measure in response to certain laws and trends within the United States . &quot;
electric fence project is elementary
the Fischer@@ bacher Wei@@ dez@@ au@@ n @-@ Project is a success project and will be continued in the coming year .
the CD@@ U members Peter White and K@@ ord@@ ula K@@ ov@@ ac have taken a picture on the spot .
&quot; at the court yard of the Schwen@@ de@@ mann family , representatives of the Fischer@@ bacher CD@@ U locations met together with mayor Thomas Schneider and the two de@@ pu@@ ties . &quot;
&quot; Markus Schwen@@ de@@ mann first granted glimp@@ ses into his farm , in which he cultivated 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest , 40 deci@@ du@@ ous cows and as many k@@ itt@@ ens , and housed in five apartments Feri@@ eng@@ ä@@ ste . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; &quot; Schwar@@ zw@@ al@@ d@@ milch &quot; &quot; is the alternative mark@@ eter for him for the milk of his cows , so Schwen@@ de@@ mann . &quot;
on the table of the Feri@@ eng@@ ä@@ ste only Regional .
&quot; since he is also BL@@ HV @-@ chairman of Fischer@@ bach , he called the &quot; &quot; electric fence project &quot; &quot; as &quot; &quot; element@@ ar important . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I cannot profit on such steep areas .
&quot; the green area care for a lot of work , much needed to be mach@@ ined with the brus@@ h@@ cutter . &quot;
&quot; we have here to fight with the conditions and with top@@ ography , &quot; &quot; stressed Schwen@@ de@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; in 2003 , he took over the farm and managed this without chemical plant protection and fer@@ til@@ iser , even if he does not lead bio @-@ operation . &quot;
&quot; for Mayor Thomas Schneider , it was clear : &quot; the Commun@@ e recognized the importance of the electric fence project and is glad about the leader . &quot;
&quot; at the cost of 3000 to 4000 euros per hect@@ are , farmers would have to be supported . &quot;
I hope that the so@@ lic@@ itation of the faces could be drawn up for quite a while .
&quot; the biggest treasure we have , are the people who work in agriculture and think about how they continue their business , &quot; &quot; stressed the mayor . &quot;
the farmers stand often in criticism because of the subsidies
&quot; in 2013 , a total of 25 plots of eleven participants were f@@ enced . &quot;
&quot; the surface area amounts to 40 hectares , which must not be for@@ ested until at least 2023 . &quot;
&quot; the total cost of 71 500 Euro was funded half by Le@@ aders , a quarter contributed to the municipality of Fischer@@ bach . &quot;
&quot; thus , the farmers had to invest 12 610 euros , which they had to invest in 16.@@ 2 kilometers of turn@@ out . &quot;
&quot; the big advantage is the lon@@ ge@@ vity of the f@@ ences , &quot; explained Schwen@@ de@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; K@@ ord@@ ula K@@ ov@@ ac stressed : &quot; &quot; you do a really good job , without farmers and farmers it does not go . &quot;
&quot; Peter White also stood firm : &quot; &quot; the best food is produced here . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the county administration line ( L@@ PR ) Baden @-@ Württemberg allows the government to promote pasture @-@ f@@ ences .
the goal is the disclosure of the Black Forest .
the pre@@ condition is the presence of a conveyor belt signed by the L@@ PR .
&quot; furthermore , the f@@ enced area must not be tow@@ ed ( slope above 35 percent ) and must therefore be threatened by the for@@ estation . &quot;
&quot; at the moment , the application of eight participants with 24 plots , which would like to build around 16 kilometres of fence for the &quot; &quot; Fischer@@ bacher Wei@@ dez@@ aun@@ project 2018 &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the open area corresponds to 35 hectares , the calculated costs are more than 112 000 euros . &quot;
is nothing more holy ?
now the White House of Tru@@ mp takes the Statue of Liberty
the saf@@ est sign of a regime change is when they begin to attack the statues .
the Americans appreciate these as well as any other - hence the carefully staged overthrow of Saddam Hussein at the Fir@@ dos square in Bag@@ h@@ dad in 2003 .
&quot; Stephen Miller , one of the key ide@@ ologists of the Tru@@ mp regime , certainly knew what he did when he took a symbolic ax@@ e in a heated argument with Jim A@@ co@@ sta from CN@@ N on the proposals of the President to dras@@ tically restrict legal immigration to the Statue of Liberty . &quot;
&quot; to stay fair , Miller did not handle the statue itself . &quot;
a hor@@ de of boat owners and liberty im@@ it@@ ators would have laugh@@ ed him if he had done it .
&quot; but he grab@@ bed its significance , and in particular the meaning that you have been attributed to when the famous poem by Emma Laz@@ arus 1903 , 17 years after completion of the monument , was added to his base . &quot;
&quot; as Miller A@@ co@@ sta wrote : &quot; I don &apos;t want to go into a complete thing about history here , but the Statue of Liberty is ... a symbol of American freedom that illumin@@ ates the world . &quot;
the poem you relate to that later was added and not part of the original Statue of Liberty .
&quot; Miller is appropri@@ ately correct , but as he formulated it himself , it is not really about history . &quot;
&quot; it is about the contemporary resonance on the vibr@@ ating words of Laz@@ arus , the only ones in which a state does not only invite any old immigrants , but the poor@@ est of the poor : &quot; &quot; your g@@ arb@@ age , your arms , / your afflic@@ ted masses , who desire to breathe freely , / the flowing waste of your rich coasts . &quot;
there was never a time in which the &quot; el@@ end waste &quot; was better seen on our screens .
Miller was not engaged in literary criticism - he made clear that these people are not welcome in Tru@@ mps .
&quot; this conflict , because of the significance of a statue , is part of a broader political and cultural debate : it is indeed a conflict about America &apos;s importance . &quot;
Laz@@ arus - and her friends who set themselves to place their words after their death at the base - knew very well that they did a highly political act .
the sculpture should show the connections between French and American republi@@ can by portra@@ ying the female em@@ bodi@@ ment of freedom in an un@@ used classical depic@@ tion .
&quot; Laz@@ arus has changed this meaning : in her poem , the female figure is no more abstract - she has received a voice . &quot;
and she gives herself a very different name : mother of ex@@ iles .
the connection of the poem with the image is a brilliant femin@@ ist coup and a devast@@ ating attack on the American N@@ ati@@ vis@@ m .
&quot; and just as Laz@@ arus changed the meaning of the statue , the people wanted to change from the right wing for a long time . &quot;
&quot; the great scre@@ am R@@ ush Lim@@ bau@@ gh , a kind of John the Baptist for the coming of Tru@@ mp , argu@@ ed in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty was unable to inv@@ ade anyone , but rather an early ne@@ o@@ conservative who brings the American flame into the um@@ nach@@ ted world : &quot; Lady Liberty goes forward . &quot;
it is to carry the tor@@ ch of freedom from the United States into the rest of the world .
the tor@@ ch is not supposed to enligh@@ ten the way to the United States . &quot;
Lim@@ bau@@ gh is quite unusual here on something .
the significance of the statue is entirely a question of the stand@@ point of perception .
&quot; the great imagin@@ ative de@@ ed of Laz@@ arus was to see them as seen from the exhausted , mis@@ erable , but hop@@ eful people after long and often terrible journeys on the de@@ cks of ships . &quot;
it is in the true sense to see the world from the perspective of people who seek refuge and a chance to improve their lives .
her statue speaks to them the words of hope and the welcome they have to hear .
and that is of course not the perspective that Miller and Tru@@ mp ever wanted to acknowledge .
&quot; their tor@@ ch is not supposed to illumin@@ ate the path , but the hatred that is their sole source of power . &quot;
world Championship 2017 : N@@ eil Black pra@@ ises Scottish members of the United Kingdom team
E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Do@@ yle is remin@@ is@@ cent of a time when only two vill@@ i belonged to the UK team
&quot; the performance director of the athle@@ tics of the United Kingdom , N@@ eil Black , says that the 16 @-@ member Scottish cont@@ ingent in the world championship team will make a massive contribution to the team . &quot;
a record number of Scottish athletes was selected for London 2017 that starts on Friday .
&quot; black believes that &quot; &quot; something special in Scotland &quot; &quot; and the athle@@ tics of the United Kingdom must learn something from it . &quot;
&quot; we welcome it and we try to understand it , and we will continue it until we find it out , &quot; said Black . &quot;
I talk to people in the Scottish Institute of Sports and they think it has something to do with what they have done .
the Scottish ath@@ lets think it has something to do with what they have done .
British athle@@ tics : it has something to do with what they have done .
and also with the type on the street corner .
&quot; whatever the combination of circumstances is , it is absolutely brilliant . &quot;
&quot; several of the Scottish athletes are medals , among them Laura Mu@@ ir and Andrew But@@ chart - who will compete against Sir Mo Far@@ ah at the 5,000 m distance while E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Do@@ yle was voted by the team to team captain . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; E@@ ili@@ d@@ h is rather modest . &quot;
&quot; their captain &apos;s speech was incredible , &quot; says Black . &quot;
&quot; a number of athletes , whether they were Scottish or wherever they live or train , went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motivated . &quot;
the passion and the real feeling that E@@ ili@@ d@@ h made quite natural were great .
&quot; the Com@@ mon@@ wealth Silver medal winner , who will compete in their fifth world champ@@ ionships at the 400 m hur@@ d@@ les , says that &quot; &quot; incredible &quot; &quot; is that 16 vill@@ i are in the British team . &quot;
&quot; Scotland &apos;s best total number of athletes at the World Championship was seven , which were reached in 1983 and 2015 . &quot;
the mid @-@ hau@@ l Mu@@ ir runs on this road and last year led five British and two European records .
&quot; it will take part in the 1,500 m and 5,000 m runs . &quot;
&quot; Chris O &apos;@@ H@@ are , who runs 1,500 m , is another Scot@@ sman for a great season to watch the victory at the British Team Tri@@ als and the Anniversary Games . &quot;
Do@@ yle is remin@@ is@@ cent of her first world champ@@ ionships as the only other Scot@@ sman in the Team Lee Mc@@ Conn@@ ell .
&quot; the team captain says that they are &quot; &quot; extremely proud &quot; &quot; to the fact that many of their comp@@ atri@@ ots are not only part of the team , but in some cases also be involved in the medals and the fin@@ als . &quot;
&quot; the special part of being a team captain is that it was voted by the other members of the team so that it was a great honour anyway , but knowing that my team colleagues have voted for me and have chosen me , it makes it something very special for me , &quot; she added . &quot;
&quot; obviously , I am very proud of all the vill@@ i that belong to the team . &quot;
it only shows how far we have come .
&quot; and they are here as established athletes , athletes who want to climb on podium . &quot;
what concerns my speech as captain ?
&quot; yes , I think she went well . &quot;
I just pointed out that we are very happy in this situation as we have a home world championship .
so it is really important to put on this home support and benefit from the fact that we are back at the Olympi@@ ast@@ adion .
I get a second chance to go there and compete and it will be just such a great atmosphere out there .
blocking Cri@@ tics on Facebook : do not take care of a public office if you cannot toler@@ ate the admission of vot@@ ers
the father of our country knew something of a bad press .
&quot; the Americans loved George Washington , but it didn &apos;t take long until the newspapers struck it because of everything , from domestic politics to its political principles . &quot;
&quot; he cri@@ tici@@ zed in the cri@@ tique , sure . &quot;
but he did not put his critics to silence .
&quot; for in the year 17@@ 83 , Washington said : &quot; freedom of speech can be taken away - and , sil@@ ly and dum@@ b , we are led like sheep to slaughter . &quot;
&quot; that brings me to Maryland to Gover@@ nor Lar@@ ry H@@ og@@ an , who has to work to be more like Washington . &quot;
Ho@@ gans employees have blocked and deleted the contributions of at least 450 people who have expressed their opinion on their official Facebook page .
and the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union ple@@ aded him at the beginning of this week .
&quot; the governor &apos;s staff dismis@@ sed the law@@ suit as fri@@ vol@@ ous , and the online commentary was full of a counter @-@ reaction with &quot; Na , &quot; and ? . &quot;
&quot; it is only Facebook , &quot; &quot; said many people . &quot;
but it is important .
and it is especially important when it is a type like H@@ og@@ an .
this is a republi@@ can governor in an overwhelming democratic state that is amaz@@ ingly popular .
he has the second highest consent of the 50 govern@@ ors of the nation .
H@@ og@@ an is not a reactionary H@@ itz@@ head .
he has shown a strong hand in the leadership of his state and strict observ@@ ance of the principles .
&quot; he was also very sk@@ ill@@ ful to use Facebook as a primary means to connect with his vot@@ ers , playing his ha@@ iry head after chemotherapy on his side . &quot;
&quot; this is why the blocking of persons coming to the governor &apos;s side - which is a public forum , which is designated as officially and by employees , who are paid by public tax dollars - unnecessary and ultimately dangerous . &quot;
&quot; in an interview with The Washington Post , Ho@@ gans Spe@@ aker Amel@@ ia Ch@@ asse def@@ ended the governor &apos;s actions and argu@@ ed that blocking the comments is nothing more than a moder@@ ation . &quot;
but it is too easy to use the image of troll@@ s or sp@@ amm@@ ers or hate @-@ filled people who vibr@@ ate online the whi@@ p .
the mail spoke with some of the real people blocked by H@@ og@@ an .
&quot; these are only real people speaking with their elected leaders : a teacher , an entrepren@@ eur and a priest , no troll@@ s . &quot;
&quot; they all said their comments were resp@@ ect@@ ful , thou@@ ght@@ ful and not prof@@ ane . &quot;
the past@@ or quoted the Bible in his post and appe@@ aled to Ho@@ gans Catholic faith .
&quot; attorney Lak@@ sh@@ mi Sar@@ ma Ram@@ ani of Bo@@ wie , M@@ d . , was not h@@ asser@@ tive , but she asked for hate crimes . &quot;
&quot; I was pol@@ ite that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to hate crimes and other current news , &quot; she wrote in the commentary area of the news &quot; The Post . &quot; &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t appreciate this idea , if a number of people occupy the same subject , they are dis@@ regarded by some rather than a so @-@ called collective effort and not recognized as a large group of affected citizens . &quot;
&quot; what the governor &apos;s employees referred to as &quot; &quot; concentrated spam attack &quot; &quot; would probably call another &quot; &quot; inter@@ c@@ ession &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the Facebook era makes it easy to cut a message by simply blocking a critic , or deleted a negative comment . &quot;
&quot; it is much cleaner than in earlier times , if one would have done the same that employees have been sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical articles and to arrest or arrest demonstr@@ ators . &quot;
but exactly this just happens digit@@ ally .
H@@ og@@ an is not the first public officials who cri@@ tici@@ zed Facebook and other social media .
President Tru@@ mp is su@@ ed by Twitter users that have been blocked by his Twitter feed .
one of the first mil@@ estones in this question fell last week in Virginia .
&quot; the Chairman of the Board of Super@@ vis@@ ors des Lou@@ dou@@ n County injured the First A@@ mend@@ ment , according to U.S. District Ju@@ dge James C. C@@ ach@@ er@@ is in Alexand@@ ria , when they named a vot@@ er from their Facebook page . &quot;
&quot; and in K@@ entu@@ cky , Gover@@ nor Matt Bev@@ in ( R ) also received a visit to the AC@@ L@@ U because of his use of Facebook and Twitter . &quot;
it should not be so difficult .
&quot; at the time of Washington , the time of affordable por@@ tos had a similar effect as the Internet . &quot;
&quot; the number of newspapers multip@@ lies between 17@@ 76 and 1800 , and anonymous letters proposed to his leadership . &quot;
and even back then Washington had anonymous troll@@ s .
&quot; people who used pseu@@ don@@ y@@ ms such as &quot; Jur@@ ic@@ ola , &quot; &quot; Val@@ eri@@ us , &quot; &quot; Bel@@ is@@ arius &quot; and &quot; Por@@ tius &quot; wrote all letters to newspapers , the Washington &apos;s decisions . &quot;
&quot; peti@@ tions critic@@ ised its position on am@@ ity , trade and shipping with Britain , overwhel@@ med his office , according to historical documents collected by the online papers of the George Washington Project . &quot;
but he has not brought her to silence .
&quot; freedom of speech , dis@@ agreement and dis@@ courses belong to our nation . &quot;
and true leadership means accepting that .
Ron@@ an Ra@@ ffer@@ ty hopes for home comfort in the Renaissance club
&quot; the former Europeans no . 1 Ron@@ an Ra@@ ffer@@ ty will hope for the next three days , since the Renaissance Club in East Lot@@ hi@@ an has held the 25th edition of the Scottish Senior Open . &quot;
&quot; the Nor@@ di@@ re , who in the past year led the Ar@@ cher@@ field to the final round , before leaving Paul E@@ ales , joined the new venue and acts as a tournament ambassador in the name of the founder and CE@@ Os J@@ erry Sar@@ v@@ adi . &quot;
&quot; I saw how the Renaissance club was built , and we see how he achieved its fame with this event , &quot; said Ra@@ ffer@@ ty . &quot;
&quot; the players will see this course from his best side , he is in a great condition . &quot;
J@@ erry did a great job when he set up this place .
he is a jeal@@ ous champion of this game and is proud of his performance here .
this is a great showcase for this course . &quot;
&quot; the English E@@ ales is looking forward to defending a championship for the first time , although he won the European Tour as well as the European Challenge Tour in his 32 @-@ year career . &quot;
&quot; this really feels particularly &quot; , &quot; said the player home to South@@ port . &quot;
I have not been able to defend the Extre@@ mad@@ ura Open since it was taken out of the program in the year after I had won it .
coming back to this part of the world is magical .
it is a wonderful place to play golf .
&quot; the memories from last year come back , and it was something special for me and my wife Shar@@ on to win last year . &quot;
it was a really special time and one we will always cher@@ ish .
&quot; Gary Or@@ r , who came to the European Senior Tour after his 50@@ th birthday this year , returns to the action at home . &quot;
this event will be his first Scottish performance since the Aber@@ de@@ en Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013 .
&quot; it always means a bit more when you &apos;re playing at home , &quot; Or@@ r said the man from Hel@@ ens@@ burgh . &quot;
&quot; you want to do it well , but you also feel that extra pressure . &quot;
I really enjoyed playing again and I played a solid golf .
I &apos;m happy about how it went .
&quot; with the trio in the field , the former Masters champion Ian Wo@@ os@@ nam and Senior Major Champions Paul Broad@@ hur@@ st , Roger Chap@@ man , Mark James and Mark Mc@@ N@@ eck . &quot;
&quot; OR@@ R and the former Ry@@ der Cup captain Sam Tor@@ ran@@ ce belong to the six Sc@@ ots in the field , the others are Andrew Old@@ corn , Stephen Mc@@ Alli@@ ster , Bill Long@@ mu@@ ir and R@@ oss Dru@@ m@@ mond . &quot;
&quot; the entrance is free , the parking costs £ 5 per car with a passengers and £ 10 per car with two or more passengers . &quot;
all proceeds go to Pro@@ state Cancer UK .
less lung canc@@ ers due to passive smoking
&quot; over the past two decades , fewer people have died because of passive smoking in lung cancer . &quot;
scientists from the University Hospital Hamburg @-@ E@@ pp@@ endorf ( U@@ KE ) come to this conclusion in a study .
&quot; according to our estimates , 167 lung cancer deaths are attri@@ but@@ able to passive smoking per year , &quot; said Professor Hei@@ ko Becher . &quot;
&quot; as a comparison , he drew up his own study on this issue of 1994 . &quot;
&quot; at that time , there were 400 lung cancer deaths due to pas@@ siv@@ ity per year in Germany . &quot;
the new study is published in the &quot; International Journal of Public Health . &quot;
house connections prove very complex
&quot; construction works in the Vill@@ ingen road are in full swing and are reasonably in time , &quot; says the director of the Bau@@ hof Fred Hein@@ ze . &quot;
&quot; in the field of domestic connections , the situation is more complicated than presum@@ ed , as there is much hiding in the underground , which is not noted in the plans . &quot;
&quot; traffic , which constantly ob@@ struc@@ ts construction work , represents a major problem for the b@@ aut@@ tro@@ op of the company St@@ ump@@ p . &quot;
&quot; the ignorance of the drivers in front of red lights and shut @-@ off racks is already enormous , &quot; says Hein@@ ze . &quot;
the road is closed and only the regular buses are eligible for transit .
&quot; Angelo Car@@ us@@ o , Mar@@ vin Kost@@ or@@ z and Tim Kost@@ or@@ z from the company St@@ ump@@ p have been working on the bridge for weeks . &quot;
&quot; the hot days were already quite exhau@@ sting .
&quot; but luck@@ ily we were supplied by our friend Fritz Matt with cool mineral water , &quot; &quot; says Mar@@ vin Kost@@ or@@ z . &quot;
poverty and death in the Indonesian gold@@ land
&quot; when B@@ ard@@ ina De@@ ge@@ i cook the dinner , it does not use a stove . &quot;
it even rarely uses a pot .
&quot; in its wood house in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , the capital of the Pan@@ i@@ ai shel@@ ters in the uns@@ ett@@ led Indonesian province Pap@@ ua , the house@@ wife usually places a sweet potato - locally called &quot; not@@ a &quot; - directly in the fireplace . &quot;
&quot; after half an hour , the stolen tu@@ ber is removed and worn with free@@ zing , un@@ washed hands . &quot;
&quot; De@@ ge@@ i sits on the clay floor - it has no furniture - where she also performs her daily work , for example clothes with cloudy water out of the nearby sw@@ amp . &quot;
a bucket in a hom@@ eless space serves as a lat@@ rine .
&quot; as the youngest of the four wives of her husband , no fields were assigned . &quot;
poly@@ gam@@ y is common here .
&quot; of course , too late can work dangerous : most of the vill@@ agers are unemployed , and many drink heavy , and there are the soldiers here . &quot;
&quot; nobody dar@@ es to walk around in the village after 5 pm , &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; it is a rare insight into daily life in the high@@ lands of Pap@@ ua , a former Dutch colony , which was recorded in 1969 following a controversial referendum in Indonesia , when only 1,0@@ 26 elders should vote in front of the occup@@ ying forces . &quot;
&quot; an existing movement that stir@@ red up for independence against the Dutch rule turned swi@@ f@@ tly against the government of Jak@@ arta , which prevents control of the region and exclu@@ des foreign journalists or legal ob@@ servers . &quot;
&quot; in 2003 , the province was officially distributed in Pap@@ ua and West Pap@@ ua , where the independent part of Pap@@ ua New Guinea was the eastern part of the island . &quot;
En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali is as seclu@@ ded as it is desert . the trip includes a 90 minute flight from the provincial capital of Jay@@ ap@@ ura to Nab@@ ire and then a morning 5 @-@ hour drive with the car rental .
there is no public transportation .
&quot; the city with about 19@@ ,000 inhabitants consists of wooden houses surrounded by bam@@ boo f@@ ences , and made of corrugated panels , which were converted into various yellow tones through r@@ ust . &quot;
&quot; only very few Indon@@ esi@@ ans have made their journey here , let alone journalists and practically no foreigners . &quot;
&quot; before Christian mission@@ aries arrived , Me@@ e P@@ ago Pap@@ u@@ ans became a god named U@@ ga Tam@@ ee . &quot;
there were also other changes .
&quot; we were not acc@@ u@@ stom@@ ed to wearing these clothes , &quot; said De@@ ge@@ i and points to their lively , hand@@ woven tur@@ ban , their dark shirt and their bright rock . &quot;
&quot; in the past , we had only leaves on our bodies . &quot;
Pap@@ ua is Indonesia &apos;s poor@@ est province where 28 % of people live under the poverty line and have some of the worst inf@@ ants and liter@@ acy rates in Asia .
but it is also Indonesia &apos;s Gold@@ land .
&quot; the largest and most profitable gold mine in the world , Gras@@ berg , owned by the Fre@@ ep@@ ort Mc@@ Mor@@ an from Phoenix , is located only 60 miles from Pan@@ i@@ ai , a high@@ land provincial in the size of New Jersey with 15@@ 3,000 inhabitants . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 alone , Fre@@ ep@@ ort lost gold and copper in the value of 3.1 billion US dollars . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Pap@@ ua has an estimated $ 78 billion in the value of estimated $ 78 billion . &quot;
&quot; however , these riches are a source of mis@@ ery for Pap@@ ua , making sure that Indonesia &apos;s powerful military has preserved a suff@@ oc@@ ative presence . &quot;
&quot; an investigation of 2005 in the New York Times reported that Fre@@ ep@@ ort paid local military units and units between 1998 and 2004 almost 20 million US dollars , including up to 150,000 US dollars to a single officer . &quot;
Pap@@ u@@ sian demands for greater autonomy thre@@ aten these golden gases and are treated mer@@ cil@@ ess@@ ly .
&quot; according to activists , more than 500,000 Pap@@ ua were killed and thousands have been rap@@ ed , tor@@ tured and im@@ pris@@ oned by the Indonesian military since 1969 . &quot;
&quot; according to the Asia Human Rights Commission , massac@@ res in Pap@@ u@@ as &apos;s tri@@ bal country in the 1970 @-@ s became genocide . &quot;
&quot; in the region alone , the Indonesian police arrested over 3,@@ 900 peaceful demonstr@@ ators last year . &quot;
&quot; we Adver@@ tise All verses &quot; in a report of the Bris@@ bane ore dioc@@ ese from 2016 , in which reports of atro@@ cities of the previous year contain , such as un@@ lawful execution and torture - rape and electric set@@ backs are particularly popular after another report - and the brutal supp@@ ression of peaceful demonstrations . &quot;
&quot; it is difficult to count the number of victims , as every week inci@@ dents happen , &quot; says Andreas Har@@ son@@ o , Indonesia researcher for Human Rights Watch . &quot;
the screws have increased since Pap@@ u@@ as &apos;s resources bring an influ@@ x of sett@@ lers from other parts of Indonesia .
&quot; the population of 3.5 million inhabitants of the province is up to 83 % Christian , but demographic developments are changing since Muslim mig@@ rant mig@@ rant from the population @-@ rich islands Java , Bor@@ neo , Sum@@ atra and Sul@@ awes@@ i come . &quot;
&quot; Jav@@ an@@ ese War@@ ung cant@@ e@@ ens sell ro@@ asted chicken and g@@ ado @-@ g@@ ado , a mixed vegetables with pe@@ an@@ ut sauce . &quot;
local people fight to keep up here .
&quot; the migrants have begun to sell chick@@ ens and vegetables in the traditional market cheaper than the local Pap@@ ua , &quot; says A@@ bet@@ h You , a 24 @-@ year @-@ old Pan@@ i@@ ai Local , who moved to the province capital of Jay@@ ap@@ ura . &quot;
&quot; it has the native Pap@@ ua - the Mama @-@ Mama , the women &#93; of Pap@@ ua - cost their market . &quot;
&quot; the Indonesian President Jok@@ o Wi@@ do@@ do , known as Jok@@ ow@@ i , promised ine@@ qualities and legal violations in Pap@@ ua during his election campaign in 2014 . &quot;
&quot; the former carp@@ enter secured 27 of the 29 districts of Pap@@ ua , including Pan@@ i@@ ai , on the way to the presidential palace in Jak@@ arta . &quot;
&quot; but in Pap@@ ua , little changed , and today the locals feel betra@@ yed . &quot;
&quot; our hearts are broken because we have tuned for Jok@@ ow@@ i in 2014 , with expectation that he will fulfill our hopes that justice will be restored , &quot; &quot; says You . &quot;
&quot; in fact , Pan@@ i@@ ai suffered only two months after Jok@@ ow@@ is inaugur@@ ation in October . &quot;
&quot; on December 7 , 2014 , a group of 11 children was outside and sang Christmas car@@ ols in front of a camp@@ fire in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , when two Indonesian soldiers broke through the darkness on a motorcycle . &quot;
the frigh@@ tened children told them that they should turn off their head@@ lights .
&quot; one of the soldiers picked up their tone and later came back with four soldiers , so the local past@@ or Y@@ av@@ edt T@@ eb@@ ai . &quot;
&quot; the soldiers who had drunk , hun@@ ted and beat the group with their guns , said victims and witnesses . &quot;
then one of the soldiers fired into the group of children .
&quot; a child , the 16 @-@ year old Y@@ uli@@ anus Y@@ ei@@ mo , was so badly beaten that he fell into the coma . &quot;
&quot; a few hours later , the building of the nearby Government Commission was set on fire and the things escal@@ ated the next day . &quot;
&quot; approximately 1,000 young Pap@@ ua men , women and children gathered themselves on a football pitch before the local police station and the military command center to demand justice . &quot;
they were wearing cerem@@ onial hunting @-@ arches and performed the Wa@@ ita @-@ Dance - in the circle continuously and a bird @-@ ges@@ ang im@@ it@@ ating - from Pap@@ u@@ as Me@@ e P@@ ago @-@ tribe .
some demonstr@@ ators began to tow stones on police and military posts .
&quot; when the mood was heated up , the soldiers were sent a command over an internal funk : &quot; if the masses resist more than three times , they shoot them dead , &quot; it is in an official document of TIME that has not been released to the local media . &quot;
&quot; Y@@ er@@ em@@ ias Kay@@ ame , 56 , the head of the K@@ ego Kot@@ o neighborhood of En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , saw the threatening danger and called for peace and called the crowd to return home . &quot;
nobody was able to listen in the mood .
&quot; when I turned around , I was suddenly shot into my left wrist , &quot; he said TIME on the ver@@ and@@ ah of his colorful painted wooden house . &quot;
&quot; Kay@@ ak still does not know who has fired , but says that the bul@@ let came from the ranks of the soldiers assembled here . &quot;
&quot; it was crowded , many shots were fired , &quot; he added . &quot;
&quot; the native man Al@@ fi@@ us You@@ w was hit three times , so his cous@@ in , the witness of shooting . &quot;
&quot; I ran to him and examined his body to make sure he was , &quot; &quot; said Y@@ oh@@ anes , who only bears a name like many Indon@@ esi@@ ans , the TIME in dark atmosphere . &quot;
I saw that he was dead ... I knew him .
&quot; the che@@ er spec@@ tor of the Pap@@ ua Police , Y@@ ot@@ je Men@@ de , told repor@@ ters that his officers would only &quot; &quot; secure &quot; &quot; their station because they are attacked . &quot;
&quot; we must defend ourselves when people thre@@ aten to kill us , &quot; &quot; said the spokes@@ man of the Pap@@ ua Police , Commissioner Pu@@ d@@ jo Sul@@ isti@@ yo , in 2015 . &quot;
&quot; it is about life and death . &quot;
&quot; according to Human Rights Watch , five young demonstr@@ ators were killed and many others injured . &quot;
the news of the kill@@ ings came to Jak@@ arta only the following day .
&quot; three weeks , Jok@@ ow@@ i in Jay@@ ap@@ ura held a passionate speech in which he expressed sympathy for the families of the victims and sw@@ ung the historical ab@@ uses in Pap@@ ua . &quot;
&quot; I want this case to be solved immediately so that it will no longer happen in the future , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; in October 2016 , Security Minister Wir@@ anto said that he would establish an extra@@ judicial mechanism for the settlement of historical violations of human rights . &quot;
but the exc@@ uses began almost immediately .
&quot; most injuries occurred long ago .
some were in the 90 &apos;s and the beginning of the 2000 @-@ s .
&quot; the point is that we have committed ourselves to address these violations , but there are processes that must pass through , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; then , Wir@@ anto made a retreat when he spoke to TIME on 5 June in Jak@@ arta , and said he has no plans to set up a complaint in Pap@@ ua . &quot;
&quot; instead , everything is regulated by law , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; charged with the UN for &quot; crimes against humanity &quot; which demanded more than 1,000 deaths in East Tim@@ or &apos;s bloody independence in 1999 , said that 11 cases of human rights ab@@ uses in Pap@@ ua have already been buried , including the Pan@@ i@@ ai incident . &quot;
families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai victims took such claims with fierce un@@ beli@@ ever .
&quot; I was inter@@ viewed four times over the last three years , but there was no progress , &quot; says Y@@ oh@@ anes . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m tired . &quot;
he says he still lives in fear years later .
&quot; I am afraid , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; I am afraid to be arrested by the military , afraid to be shot . &quot;
his brother Y@@ ac@@ ob@@ us repeated the view that the people in Pan@@ i@@ ai fear to discuss the incident .
he says he was beaten by the military after he helped to bury four of the victims .
&quot; after I had buried the dead , the military sought me , &quot; he says . &quot;
the fo@@ undry has not stopped .
on Tuesday the Indonesian police attacked vill@@ agers in Pan@@ i@@ ais neighborhood Dei@@ y@@ ai .
&quot; during a con@@ frontation between vill@@ agers and the manager of a B@@ auf@@ ir@@ ma who refused to bring a conscious man to the hospital , one person and 17 others were injured , including children . &quot;
&quot; the man , who was 24 @-@ year @-@ old R@@ avi@@ anus Dou@@ w , drow@@ ned when he f@@ ished at a nearby river , died on the way to the hospital . &quot;
excited vill@@ agers prot@@ ested in front of the company &apos;s sit@@ ing office .
the police said that the vill@@ agers cast stones on officers who re@@ acted by fir@@ ing warning shots .
but locals say that the mobile bri@@ g@@ ade ( Indonesian par@@ am@@ il@@ itary police ) began to shoot the crowd and killed one .
&quot; we were so in panic , we are afraid that there will be ven@@ ge@@ ance , &quot; says the 29 @-@ year @-@ old Dom@@ ing@@ g@@ u B@@ adi@@ i who lives in the vicinity of the hospital and witnessed how the injured were quickly delivered here , so the TIME . &quot;
&quot; I hid myself two days in my house . &quot;
the Dei@@ y@@ ai parliament has called to hold the officers involved and withdraw the mobile bri@@ g@@ ade from the territory .
Pan@@ i@@ ai was always a mis@@ chief for the Indonesian government .
&quot; the lack of meaningful development strengthens the dis@@ satisfaction of the tri@@ bal families of Me@@ e , Mon@@ i , Dan@@ i and dam@@ al , who live in the green high@@ lands of Pap@@ ua . &quot;
&quot; many joined the &quot; Free Pap@@ ua Movement &quot; ( O@@ PM ) , the re@@ bel army that claims to defend the rights of Pap@@ ua by cont@@ acting spor@@ adi@@ c attacks and kid@@ n@@ apping of Indonesian soldiers . &quot;
&quot; some of the top O@@ PM leaders come from Pan@@ i@@ ai , among them T@@ adi@@ us Yog@@ i and Daniel Yu@@ das Kog@@ o@@ ya . &quot;
&quot; in response to this , thousands of people in Pan@@ i@@ ai were arrested and arbit@@ rar@@ ily arrested in custo@@ dy , under the pre@@ text of &quot; safegu@@ arding national sovereignty . &quot; &quot;
some never appear again .
&quot; among the people of Pap@@ ua , Pan@@ i@@ ai is known as &quot; a tragic , forgotten place . &quot; &quot;
poverty strengthens the dis@@ satisfaction .
the little rice sold in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali is too expensive for locals .
bread is just as out of reach .
people here build everything they eat : especially not@@ a and fruit and leaf@@ y vegetables .
agriculture is the task of women who can process four or five fields of the sweet potato .
&quot; they retain most of the harvest for the family , while the rest is sold on the local market . &quot;
ten pieces of Not@@ a cost only 10.000 Indonesian ru@@ pe@@ e ( 75 c@@ ents ) .
&quot; over time , economic ine@@ qualities between the local Pap@@ ua and the new migrants have grown , which have arrived in greater numbers since the opening of new routes to Nab@@ ire airport . &quot;
the few jobs that exist in the region usually go to the better educated and weal@@ th@@ ier migrants .
Pap@@ ua rarely have capital or the necessary skills to make their own businesses competitive .
&quot; the young people are not interested in staying in the village ... for there is no jobs or money , &quot; says John Gob@@ ai , Chairman of the tri@@ bal Council of Pan@@ i@@ ai . &quot;
isolation keeps the eyes of the world far from Pap@@ ua .
&quot; in addition , restrictions of coverage of international media remain ten@@ se . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the year , French journalists Fran@@ ck Esc@@ u@@ die and Basi@@ lle Long@@ ch@@ amp were de@@ ported because of lack of coordination with related institutions from Pap@@ ua , although the rare permission to film was given . &quot;
&quot; according to P@@ hel@@ in K@@ ine , the dep@@ uty Asia @-@ director of Human Rights Watch , the promises of Jok@@ ow@@ is campaign to raise the restrictions of reporting to promote transparency and development . &quot;
&quot; there are new dangers for foreign journalists who try to report from Indonesia &apos;s rest@@ less east@@ ern@@ most provinces of Pap@@ ua and Western pap@@ ua : visa den@@ ial and a black list , &quot; he said in an explanation . &quot;
lack of press control means that international pressure on the Indonesian government is largely confined to the immediate neighbours Pap@@ u@@ as .
&quot; in March , six paci@@ fic states - T@@ ong@@ a , Nau@@ ru , Palau , Tu@@ val@@ u , the Marshall Islands and the Solomon Islands - the UN Human Rights Council to investigate the &quot; various and widespread violations &quot; in Pap@@ ua including the Pan@@ i@@ ai fo@@ undry . &quot;
the same countries have historically been supported by the O@@ PM .
&quot; the spokes@@ man of the Indonesian Ministry of Foreign Affairs , Ar@@ r@@ man@@ atha N@@ asi@@ r , pointed out the accus@@ ations of the group and said journalists in Jak@@ arta : &quot; in Indonesia , there is still a democratic system and there are free media , so it is difficult to cover the evidence for human rights . &quot;
people on the spot want more foreign governments to take note of this .
&quot; as an official delegation from the Netherlands , visited by the Human Rights Ambassador K@@ ees Van Ba@@ ar , Jay@@ ap@@ ura on May 4 , local people jour@@ ne@@ yed and urged him &quot; We want freedom , &quot; according to a source that also participated in the meeting but wants to remain anonymous . &quot;
&quot; Indonesia has another presidential election to 2019 , but the Pap@@ ua say they are unlikely to vote for Jok@@ ow@@ i . &quot;
&quot; Jok@@ ow@@ i is a person who has good intentions , but he is surrounded by the people who are involved in the Pan@@ i@@ ai shots , &quot; &quot; says Gob@@ ai , the Chairman of the tri@@ bal Council . &quot;
&quot; he wants that Jok@@ ow@@ i knows that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people , apart from that it lives under the constant threat of a pre@@ dat@@ ory military , is located in poor educational and health services . &quot;
&quot; Gob@@ ai says that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people , like other Pap@@ ua , consider their voice for Jok@@ ow@@ i as a &quot; gu@@ ilt &quot; he has to pay back . &quot;
&quot; they do not need money , they just want justice , &quot; &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; despite the threats and inti@@ mid@@ ations , families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai @-@ shot victims led to a last symbolic act of the de@@ fi@@ ance : the dead of a victim was buried in an area just opposite the police and the military station . &quot;
&quot; they know that they may never give justice to them , but at least they don &apos;t forget those responsible for their crimes . &quot;
&quot; a member of our family was killed , &quot; says Y@@ ac@@ ob@@ us with head . &quot;
&quot; what else can we do ? &quot;
fire capture the &apos; Tor@@ ch &apos; sky@@ sc@@ rap@@ ers from Dubai for the second time
&quot; on Friday , a fire found its passage in one of the highest towers of the world in Dubai and forced hundreds of inhabitants to flee from the 337 metre high , 79 @-@ storey building . &quot;
&quot; it is the second fire , which is swe@@ pt through the high @-@ rise in just two years , which is acci@@ dentally called the Tor@@ ch Tower ( tor@@ ch tower ) . &quot;
&quot; the building was ev@@ acu@@ ated , injuries were not reported and there was no direct word about the cause of the flame . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we slept and we got up with the fire alarm and when people cry . &quot;
&quot; we ran down the stairs and it took about 10 minutes to come down from the 50@@ th floor down , &quot; a resident told his name as George ang@@ ab , Reu@@ ters . &quot;
Du@@ ba@@ is civil protection authorities said that the units of fire fighting at 4.00 p.m. local time ( 00@@ .00 GMT ) extingu@@ ished the fire and cooled down the building .
the government said they work on providing accommodation for those affected .
the incident can revi@@ ve questions concerning the safety of materials used in areas of high @-@ rise buildings all over the world .
&quot; an investigation by the management of the Tor@@ ch building after its fire in 2015 revealed that most of the damage from cl@@ adding , exterior cl@@ adding for decoration or isolation , came . &quot;
&quot; in the UK , the police said that the system of panels for insulation and cl@@ adding at the London Gren@@ fell Tower could have contributed to the rapid spread of a fire in which about 80 people died . &quot;
no Davis Cup Reform : further Best @-@ of @-@ five
the president of the International Tennis Federation ( IT@@ F ) has passed through his great Davis Cup cou@@ p at the Annual General Meeting .
&quot; at the meeting in Ho Chi Min@@ h City , the proposal for this sport was not only supported by the two @-@ third majority for this sport . &quot;
&quot; although often very long , but even so much appreciated five @-@ pack classics are preserved to the traditional competition . &quot;
&quot; 6@@ 3,@@ 54 percent of member countries voted for reform , the aim of the IT@@ F President David Hag@@ ger@@ ty was therefore only scar@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; we respect this decision , but are disappointed that our members not accepted the whole reform package for the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup . &quot;
&quot; we need a change to secure the long @-@ term future of these icon@@ ic and historical competitions , &quot; said Hag@@ ger@@ ty . &quot;
you will continue to work on improving the applicant .
&quot; not only for the vote , after many in@@ consi@@ sten@@ cies , the proposal was already before the proposal to leave the final at a neutral place . &quot;
&quot; new from 2018 are only compar@@ atively small details : so , the fin@@ alists in the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup will have the host right in the first round in the next round . &quot;
&quot; in order to reduce the costs for the organis@@ ers , the requirements for training places etc. will be reli@@ eved and the players will have to do less official media appointments prior to the Davis Cup . &quot;
&quot; more than 1 of 5 US travelers bring forbidden objects to the aircraft , finding a pol@@ l &quot;
&quot; a survey conducted under flight passengers revealed that more than 20 percent aware or un@@ consciously prohibited items to the control points of the U.S. Transportation Security Administration , including at least 6 percent , who entered the aircraft , while they acci@@ dentally worn out kni@@ ves or other objects with blades . &quot;
&quot; less than 1 percent claimed that they were late discovered that they had gone mad with fire@@ arms , am@@ mun@@ ition , or explo@@ sives . &quot;
&quot; the survey conducted at more than 1,000 people - which was carried out by a jet charter service , the Str@@ at@@ os Jet Char@@ ters Inc . , also stated that younger travelers were more aware of the rules . &quot;
&quot; from the respon@@ dents who admitted that they were unknow@@ ingly trying to fly with something that was banned by T@@ SA , 19.@@ 7 percent mill@@ enni@@ als were compared to less than 15 percent , the members of the generation X were . &quot;
&quot; the most common objects that were deliberately passed by T@@ SA agents , were food and liquids . &quot;
&quot; more than 3 percent charged to have know@@ ingly worn items with blades by security control , while 2.2 percent of women surv@@ ey@@ ed and 3.7 percent of the male respon@@ dents also confirmed that they were inten@@ tionally brought on forbidden drugs into the aircraft . &quot;
&quot; the company said it was asking travelers throughout the country to find out how many acci@@ dentally sm@@ ug@@ gled goods had brought by airport security , and how many had done it inten@@ tionally . &quot;
&quot; it is no surprise that people who are most likely sm@@ ug@@ gling - know@@ ingly or unknow@@ ingly - carry security , those who were most often flying . &quot;
&quot; however , the company suggests that the T@@ SA guidelines are somewhat complicated and conf@@ using . &quot;
people are often uncer@@ tain what fluids can take them or how much of it .
so it is no surprise that the largest amount of objects conf@@ isc@@ ated by T@@ SA are prohibited fluids .
&quot; for a while , people thought that T@@ SA could look at books as sm@@ ug@@ gling . &quot;
&quot; fluids are allowed on domestic flights , but not on international flights . &quot;
El@@ on Mus@@ k doesn &apos;t matter : tens of thousands of Tes@@ la clients cancel Order
electric @-@ thous@@ end@@ s@@ ass@@ a El@@ on Mus@@ k is happy to give thanks to the huge number of pre@@ orders for his new Tes@@ la &quot; Model 3 . &quot;
&quot; so far , he has under@@ gone that a part of the customer has already with@@ drawn their non @-@ binding reservation . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the constantly triumph@@ ant numbers on sales increases and even more gigantic sales targets , Tes@@ la boss El@@ on Mus@@ k will reveal a different , less glossy figure for the first time : the cancellation of the new mass market model 3 . &quot;
&quot; in recent months , Mus@@ k frequently had more than 500,000 pre @-@ orders for the new car , whose delivery commen@@ ces . &quot;
&quot; now Mus@@ k adm@@ its : from the total 5@@ 18@@ ,000 pre @-@ orders , 63@@ .000 have been with@@ drawn back again . &quot;
critics have always pointed out that there is only non @-@ binding reservations .
&quot; in case of cancellation , Tes@@ la pays € 1000 ( in the US $ 1000 and in the UK 1000 pounds ) &quot; &quot; reservation payment &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; at present 45@@ 5,000 of such non @-@ binding reservations are available , sp@@ ati@@ fied Mus@@ k in a telephone conference with analysts . &quot;
&quot; however , the Tes@@ la boss does not believe that the cancellation of about 12 percent of all orders could become a problem . &quot;
&quot; his argument : the challenge of ambitious growth targets is not in demand , but on the production site . &quot;
&quot; last year , Tes@@ la delivered 8@@ .000 vehicles . &quot;
&quot; in 2018 , all models should be combined - 500,000 , 2020 a million . &quot;
the demand for this is obvious .
&quot; according to Mus@@ k , 1800 reservations are made per day . &quot;
&quot; who orders a &quot; Model 3 &quot; today must be expected at the earliest in the second half of 2018 - when Tes@@ la manages to drive its brand new , even never in practice tested production lines with maximum capacity utilization . &quot;
many experts doubt that this is possible .
&quot; but if it comes to major delays , then the non @-@ binding of the reservations could become a problem for Tes@@ la . &quot;
&quot; for then , the company cannot prevent dis@@ satisfied customers from running in crowds . &quot;
EPA Chef P@@ ru@@ itt moves back to reducing emissions due to the delay of the Obama @-@ Er@@ a rules
&quot; a day after he had been su@@ ed of 15 states , Scott P@@ ru@@ itt , head of the Environmental Protection Agency , with@@ drew his former decision to delay the implementation of the rules of the Obama era to reduce emissions of smo@@ g @-@ causing poll@@ ut@@ ants . &quot;
P@@ ru@@ itt presented the change when his agency proved to meet the needs of state environmental authorities as far as previous administr@@ ations .
he did not mention the complaint that was raised against his previous position in a Federal Court of Appe@@ al .
it is a period that went on October 1 for states to comply with the standards of 2015 for ground @-@ level o@@ zone .
&quot; in June , P@@ ru@@ itt announced that he would delay the compliance with a year in order to give his authority more time to study the plan and to avoid interfer@@ ing with local decisions or to hin@@ der economic growth . &quot;
&quot; P@@ ru@@ itt , who was before his appointment by President Donald Tru@@ mp &apos;s prosec@@ utor of O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma , was a reliable opponent of harsh environmental regulations for a long time . &quot;
&quot; since his arrival in Washington , P@@ ru@@ itt has repeatedly gone over to block or delay regul@@ ators which oppose the chemical industry and the industry of fossil fuels . &quot;
the sudden revers@@ al of Wednesday is the most recent legal set@@ back for the inc@@ ision of regulatory roll@@ back agenda .
&quot; last month , a federal court in Washington decided that the EPA manager exceeded its authority when he tried to delay the implementation of a rule of the Obama administration , the oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce meth@@ ane lec@@ ks . &quot;
&quot; in a statement issued on Wednesday evening , P@@ ru@@ itt proposed that his revers@@ al at o@@ zone standards simply rein@@ forces the willingness of EPA to cooperate with the States through the complex process of timely fulfillment of the new standards . &quot;
&quot; under former administr@@ ations , the EPA often has not kept the dead@@ lines for carrying out and then been accused of being indic@@ ted by activ@@ ist groups and others , and in an agreement to establish the date for execution , &quot; said P@@ ru@@ itt , who def@@ ended the EPA more than a dozen times in his previous job . &quot;
&quot; we do not believe in regulation by li@@ tigation , and we take dead@@ lines seriously . &quot;
we also take the law and authority that gives us serious .
&quot; nevertheless , the opinion of the EPA said that P@@ ru@@ itt will eventually use his &quot; authority to delay and all other legally available authority &quot; to ensure that the rules are based on a solid policy and the best available information . &quot;
the Republi@@ cans in Congress are pushing for a more comprehensive re@@ constitution of the o@@ zone rules .
a bill of legislation approved last month is intended to delay the implementation of the 2015 rules for at least eight years .
the measure was not set up in the Senate yet .
&quot; the New York At@@ tor@@ ney General Eric Schnei@@ der@@ man , who headed the Coalition of the States who had lam@@ ented the EPA in this week , said the group intended to maintain legal pressure . &quot;
the conversion of EPA - after our pl@@ agues - is an important profit for health and safety of these 6.7 million New Yor@@ kers and the more than 115 million Americans who are directly affected by the smo@@ g who flows into their communities &apos; said Schnei@@ der@@ man .
&quot; in this case , New York developed California , Connec@@ tic@@ ut , Del@@ aware , Illinois , I@@ owa , Ma@@ ine , Massachusetts , Minn@@ es@@ ota , New Mexico , Oregon , Penn@@ syl@@ van@@ ia , Rho@@ de Island , Ver@@ mont and Washington and the District of Columbia . &quot;
&quot; soil o@@ zone origin@@ ates when poll@@ ut@@ ants from cars , power plants , oil refin@@ eries , chemical plants and other sources in the atmosphere react to sunlight . &quot;
the resulting smooth@@ ness can cause serious breathing problems in sensitive groups of people and contribute to thousands of premature deaths every year .
representatives of public health care and environ@@ ment@@ alists che@@ ered for surprising course changes .
&quot; it is distur@@ bing how much pressure it takes to obtain this sensible step from the responsible for the protection of the air we inhal@@ e , &quot; said Lor@@ i Ann Bur@@ d from the Center for Bi@@ ological Di@@ versity . &quot;
we must continue fighting against the ideological crus@@ ade of the Tru@@ mp government to address environmental poll@@ ut@@ ants and their particular interests .
Tum@@ lingen celebrates 750 years of St. Hil@@ arius Church
&quot; 750 years of St. Hil@@ arius Church : on the occasion of the Jubilee of the Berg@@ kirche , the old cemetery @-@ area in Tum@@ lingen will be invited to a Ser@@ en@@ ade on Sunday , 16 July . &quot;
whether its idyllic location and beautiful views of the village is the historical St. Hil@@ arius facility a popular place to stay .
visitors to the Six@@ th Bene@@ fi@@ z seren@@ ade can be en@@ chan@@ ted by this powerful place .
the rescue and preservation of the oldest building in the village have made friends and supporters of ours to their concerns .
Walter Mart@@ ini empha@@ sizes : &quot; it is a unique d@@ ör@@ f@@ liches Klein@@ od . &quot;
in 12@@ 67 St. Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kap@@ elle was first mentioned in the Württem@@ berg@@ ischen jungle book : Count Hermann von Sul@@ z sold the mountain with the parish church at Mag@@ ister Eber@@ hard von H@@ orb and his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark silver .
&quot; according to the certificate of the certificate , on the Tum@@ linger Mountain , apart from the former parish church , there was also a magnificent courtyard where the church or the patron saint belonged , and not the other way round . &quot;
so there were also people there .
&quot; as described in the description of the Ober@@ amt &quot; &quot; Freuden@@ stadt &quot; &quot; of 18@@ 58 , it was next to Unter@@ dorf and the Ober@@ dorf , which are still visible in the local picture of Tum@@ lingen , the &quot; mountain &quot; of the third , the beautiful settlement of the village . &quot;
old maps from the time around 1600 are supporting this historical situation .
the right of pat@@ ron@@ age was created from the early medieval church law .
&quot; a Lord who built a church and occupied with a past@@ or , remained the owner of this church and could also inher@@ it this church . &quot;
&quot; in this way , the right to use a priest or to propose a new past@@ or to the bishop . &quot;
there were three alt@@ ars in the church and two bells on the tower .
the bigger ones are broken at Christmas 16@@ 73 .
&quot; the newly created bell , then first introduced in 16@@ 92 , had to be handed over later during the Second World War in 1942 . &quot;
&quot; in the 30 @-@ year @-@ old war ( 16@@ 16 to 16@@ 48 ) , the windows were wrapped and the bell parts were stolen . &quot;
the roof was le@@ aking .
17@@ 96 French troops enc@@ amped near the church .
they removed the pul@@ pit and church chairs and used them as fire@@ wood .
the remains of the church threatened in 18@@ 09 .
&quot; until 1869 , the Tum@@ linger cemetery served as the last resting place for the dead from Hör@@ schwei@@ ler . &quot;
in 18@@ 23 the cemetery was enlarged and the Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kirche was abor@@ ted .
only the church tower can be found .
in the New Year &apos;s Night in 18@@ 34 a storm split the Kir@@ cht@@ ur@@ m and half crashed .
&quot; to prevent mis@@ fortune , the tower was broken off . &quot;
only the tower @-@ guil@@ d still available today was preserved as a witness of the 750 @-@ year @-@ old church history .
today Horst K@@ allen@@ berger and Rolf @-@ Dieter Was@@ em take care of the &quot; Schaff@@ haus@@ er Rent@@ ners &quot; as the successor of Dieter Do@@ ck@@ horn the Hil@@ arius facility .
&quot; as promot@@ ers invite friends and promot@@ ers of Tum@@ lin@@ gen on Sunday , July 16 , to the sixth Ser@@ en@@ ade on the old cemetery to St. Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kap@@ elle . &quot;
this is designed by the Combo des Ke@@ pler @-@ Gymnasium Freuden@@ stadt and with ess@@ ays by Kurt Kü@@ bler and Rein@@ hold Mat@@ tei@@ s .
local Pres@@ er@@ ge@@ er Hart@@ mut Rom@@ ann speaks the final word .
the program starts at 4.@@ 30 pm .
admission is from 3 : 30 p.m .
&quot; at the end of the seren@@ ade , a trunk occurs in front of the cemetery . &quot;
&quot; enjoy a summer evening under the shadow of old trees and with a wide view over meadows towards the forest , &quot; the organizers take out the fantastic view . &quot;
the seren@@ ade takes place only in dry weather .
&quot; the organis@@ ers hope for many supporters to preserve the historical St. Hil@@ arius facility , which is of importance for tum@@ ours and list@@ eners . &quot;
&quot; friends and promot@@ ers of ours feel particularly committed to home care , such as Ser@@ en@@ ade Organis@@ ator Walter Mart@@ ini . &quot;
association wants to make approval of wind turbines
&quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim we@@ es itself &quot; &quot; does not see any legal requirement for the construction and has therefore turned to the council . &quot;
&quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim , &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim , &quot; has promp@@ ted Land@@ rat Andreas Co@@ enen ( CD@@ U ) to reg@@ ain its approval for the construction of planned wind turbines in the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette . &quot;
it is un@@ lawful .
&quot; the association ar@@ gues that at the time of approval on 30 December 2016 in the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette , no wind turbines could have been approved since at the time in Vier@@ sen , a wind force concentration zone existed only at the border of Schwal@@ m@@ tal . &quot;
&quot; within this concentration zone , construction and operation of wind turbines are generally possible , but at the same time the concentration zone causes an exclusion of wind energy for the other city area . &quot;
such zones should prevent a &quot; saving &quot; of the landscape .
&quot; the city of Vier@@ sen had decided a second wind force concentration zone in the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette , a few days earlier - but the district government of Düsseldorf had not approved , because of a lack of shape . &quot;
&quot; due to the lack of schedul@@ ing legal requirements , the granted approval is still un@@ lawful and therefore also rejected , &quot; &quot; said Christoph Er@@ k@@ ens , President of &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim . &quot; &quot;
current state of affairs : the city council again decided the wind concentration zone in the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette before the summer break ; a permit from the district government is still pending .
Er@@ k@@ ens : &quot; this is where the issu@@ ance of a permit for the establishment of wind turbines is legally excluded . &quot;
the circle confirms the entrance of the so@@ lic@@ itation .
&quot; the corresponding letters have been received by the circle of Vier@@ sen since last week , &quot; &quot; explained a spokes@@ man . &quot;
the circle takes them to the occasion to check the matter again .
&quot; however , they do not lead to the fact that the procedure is stopped . &quot;
&quot; with a view of ongoing proceedings at the Administr@@ ative Court , the circle on Thursday did not want to express itself in terms of the argument of the &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim &quot; association . &quot;
&quot; the NEW Re , a subsidiary of the NEW , plans on an area at the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette the construction of four each 200 metres high wind turbines . &quot;
&quot; last year , the company , where the city of Vier@@ sen was medi@@ able , had closed lease contracts with the owner of the approximately 65 hectares large grounds . &quot;
&quot; with the construction of the four wind turbines , electricity needs of around 11 400 households should be covered - this corresponds to approximately one fifth of the electricity needs of all four @-@ sen@@ ders . &quot;
the NEW Re aims to invest some 20 million euros .
&quot; last summer , Vier@@ sen &apos;s City Council gave green light to the purchase of three wind turbines at the Lin@@ ni@@ ch Wind@@ park near Aachen as well as a stake in a wind energy plant in Ü@@ bach @-@ Pal@@ enberg in the district Hein@@ sberg . &quot;
car and tractor crash together : woman dies in terrible accident
a terrible traffic accident occurred on the Friday morning at 10 o &apos;clock on the L 333 between Nieder@@ wall@@ men@@ ach and Bo@@ gel ( Rhein @-@ L@@ ahn @-@ Kreis ) .
a woman was deadly wounded .
two more persons were easily injured .
the provincial road was closed over hours .
&quot; after police declar@@ ations , a 17 @-@ year @-@ old young woman from Bor@@ ni@@ ch took the L 333 in the direction of Bo@@ gel with her 53 @-@ year @-@ old mother as an accompanying person . &quot;
city and tra@@ der plan &quot; Heimat @-@ Shopp@@ en &quot; weekend
&quot; in September , Bad Lan@@ gen@@ salz@@ aer and people from the region will discover shopping opportunities in the city centre . &quot;
the trade fair and city management want to use the weekend on 8 and 9 September to attract the residents to the city centre .
&quot; as the chairman of the trade association , Christian König , announced , the &quot; &quot; Heimat @-@ Shopp@@ en &quot; &quot; weekend is intended to sensi@@ tise the customers , which offers their own city away from the usual supermarket goods . &quot;
&quot; therefore , a market with regional providers is planned , similar to the weekly market . &quot;
&quot; in addition , local companies are to present themselves with their apprentic@@ es@@ hips . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the shops of the city center will invite you to &quot; &quot; midnight shopping &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in doing so , the action not only targets inhabitants of the city and the surrounding region . &quot;
&quot; in preparation be commerci@@ als on the radio , an internet video and printed bags that point to the ac@@ tional weekend , so Christian König . &quot;
municipal administration and trade unions cooperate with the Chamber of Commerce and Industry .
&quot; thus , the trade fair and the city enter a further stage of the project &quot; &quot; Attrac@@ tive City Center &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; these include new offerings such as the first &quot; &quot; active day &quot; &quot; to the well @-@ fixed Sunday , talks with all tra@@ ders and hosts to move them to active participation . &quot;
attractive offers for Saturday and reno@@ unc@@ ement on parking fees this day are part of the concept .
&quot; in addition , customer potential is to be newly developed or re@@ developed . &quot;
&quot; for this purpose , guests and tourists belong . &quot;
but many locals also lost sight of the city center shopping .
&quot; at the end , everyone would have to contribute to the city centre - to land@@ lords , the farms of all the city and clubs . &quot;
&quot; it was successful , with a network to overcome the le@@ th@@ ar@@ gy that partly broad@@ ly made , König had said in the spring . &quot;
&quot; Birgit St@@ reich , Director of the I@@ HK @-@ Centers in Mühl@@ hausen divided that the third &quot; &quot; Heimat @-@ Shopp@@ en &quot; &quot; day , for the first time , took part in five Thuring@@ ian cities . &quot;
&quot; in addition to Bad Lan@@ gen@@ sal@@ za , this is Weimar , S@@ ö@@ mmer@@ da , Heiligen@@ stadt and Blei@@ cher@@ ode . &quot;
&quot; the day should advertise for the appreciation of local trade and raise its significance for the common welfare of our cities , &quot; &quot; says St@@ reich . &quot;
the action under the leadership of the Chamber of Commerce of the Chamber of Commerce and with many partners makes it clear that every citizen can influence his / her behavior in a direct environment .
two dead and several wounded after explosion at US school
during construction it came to a gas explosion in the school building .
new people were injured .
&quot; in a gas explosion in the US @-@ town of Min@@ ne@@ apolis , two people were killed and nine others were injured , some of them hard . &quot;
&quot; according to the fire bri@@ g@@ ade , there was still a vulner@@ ability in critical condition on Wednesday ( local time ) . &quot;
a man died when a part of a school building was collap@@ sed at the explosion .
&quot; a first missed , later , was also found dead . &quot;
the dead were the employees of the school .
&quot; as a mis@@ fortune , the authorities susp@@ ect work on a gas pipeline . &quot;
only a few people were staying in the building of the Minn@@ eh@@ aha Academy .
Tru@@ mp put down tr@@ acked tran@@ scription by telephone calls Mexico under pressure because of the payment of the border wall
tran@@ scri@@ bed by telephone calls between US President Donald Tru@@ mp and the leaders of Mexico and Australia were published by the Washington Post .
&quot; on January 27 , Tru@@ mp asked in a telephone call with the Mexican President En@@ ri@@ que P@@ ena N@@ ie@@ to to publicly say that he would not pay for a planned boundary wall . &quot;
&quot; the US president accused him , because he had publicly den@@ o@@ unced the wall . according to report , he said to him , &quot; &quot; You cannot tell the press . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Tru@@ mp started his presidential campaign with the promise to build a wall on the southern border of the US , and s@@ wore to pay Mexico for the project . &quot;
tran@@ script of his first call with the Australian Prime Minister Mal@@ col@@ m Turn@@ bull were also published and revealed a ten@@ se exchange .
&quot; Mr. Tru@@ mp said Mr. Turn@@ bull that a trade for the USA emig@@ rated to take over &quot; ridi@@ cul@@ ous , &quot; &quot; &quot; bad &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; du@@ mm &quot; &quot; and that the existence of the trade , which was im@@ par@@ ted by the Obama administration , would make him look like a &quot; land@@ fill &quot; after he proposed a ban on the rel@@ ocation of refugees to the United States . &quot;
Mr. Tru@@ mp finished the call after he had said Mr. Turn@@ bull : &quot; this is the most unpleasant call for the whole day . &quot;
Mo@@ ores Ford massac@@ re : activists perform rac@@ ist Lyn@@ ch@@ act as a call for justice
&quot; a 1948 @-@ man Ford Mer@@ cury drove through a group of spectators in the rural Mon@@ roe , Georgia , and shr@@ unk to the Ford Bridge of Mo@@ ore . &quot;
&quot; before the car that had four black passengers and a white driver that could reach the bridge , a group of white men came out with guns to block his path . &quot;
the leader of the M@@ ob@@ s - a man of middle aged in a con@@ i@@ fer strip - took a long train at his cig@@ ar and looked dynam@@ ically through the wind@@ shield .
inside the occup@@ ants we@@ aken in fear .
&quot; we want this n ---- r Roger ! &quot; bru@@ te the man .
&quot; get him out of the car ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
scre@@ am torn the silence when a young black man was drag@@ ged from the passenger seat .
&quot; fortunately , this horri@@ ble scene , which was played on July 22 , is just an appointment . &quot;
&quot; but if a loop is thrown around the neck of &quot; Roger , &quot; almost all in the audience hit very real sig@@ h . &quot;
&quot; since 2005 citizens are back to Mo@@ ore &apos;s Ford Bridge to im@@ itate the night , in which two black couples - Roger and Dor@@ othy Mal@@ com and George and Ma@@ e Mur@@ ray Dor@@ sey - have been y@@ iel@@ ded by K@@ u K@@ lux Kl@@ an in 1946 . &quot;
no one was ever charged with the kill@@ ings .
&quot; it is truly unbelievable that in all these years there was no single person arrested - although we see them in our churches , although we know who they are , &quot; &quot; said Ty@@ rone Broo@@ ks , who helps with the organisation of post @-@ creation . &quot;
&quot; it is a dirt @-@ stain on a history , but it is a burden for our souls . &quot;
Broo@@ ks is a 71 @-@ year @-@ old former Con@@ gres@@ sman of the State Georgia and a life @-@ long civil law .
&quot; for him , the post@@ war serves as a dramatic call for action and represents an annual memory of the Mon@@ roe community that a injus@@ tice has never been corrected . &quot;
&quot; we want to be prosec@@ uted , we want to end , we want healing , we want reconciliation , but first we have to get justice , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; we cannot reach healing and reconciliation , until we receive justice . &quot;
a judicial physician lays a blan@@ ket over the cor@@ p@@ se of one of the victims of the Mo@@ ore @-@ Ford @-@ Lyn@@ ch on 27 July 1946 .
&quot; according to F@@ BI files received by the N@@ BC News , more than 50 men from Mon@@ roe and the surrounding gra@@ ding were suspected in the Lyn@@ ch@@ process . &quot;
but none has ever been indic@@ ted .
&quot; although the susp@@ ects remain on free foot for decades , citizens advoc@@ ate that the double motivation for the Lyn@@ ch actions throughout the city was always known : politics and sex . &quot;
&quot; in April 1946 , a decision by the Supreme Court of Justice allowed the black citizens to vote in Georgia for the first time in the summer election campaign in the summer . &quot;
&quot; about at the same time as the choice st@@ ach according to the F@@ BI the black farmer Roger Mal@@ com a white land@@ owner , Bar@@ nett H@@ ester , during a fight - allegedly because of a woman . &quot;
&quot; Broo@@ ks said that the rum@@ our in the city had been that H@@ ester slept with Mal@@ com@@ s &apos;s wife Dor@@ othy , and that the baby she wore did not stem from her husband . &quot;
&quot; on 25 July 1946 , Lo@@ y Har@@ rison , a prominent white land@@ owner , paid $ 600 to free Mal@@ com from prison , so the F@@ BI . &quot;
he was accompanied by Dor@@ othy and her cous@@ ins Ma@@ e Mur@@ ray and George Dor@@ sey .
&quot; but when they removed from prison and approaching the Mo@@ ore &apos;s Ford Bridge , a Lyn@@ ch@@ mo@@ b surrounded the car . &quot;
&quot; as it turns out , it was Har@@ rison , who prepared and ordered the kill@@ ings , &quot; conclu@@ des a F@@ BI report . &quot;
&quot; it is also obvious that there was a conspir@@ acy between the state and local law enforcement , which was not only involved in the kill@@ ings , removed evidence and has fal@@ si@@ fied the identity of witnesses . &quot;
Broo@@ ks form@@ ulates it even more conc@@ ise .
&quot; it was an elec@@ toral law massac@@ re , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; they were all killed to send a message to black people in this community : &quot; &quot; if you register and if you vote , this will happen to you . &quot;
&quot; for nearly a decade , Cass@@ andra Gre@@ ene has managed the annual appointment of the Mo@@ ore Ford Bridge Lyn@@ ch @-@ Mor@@ de . &quot;
&quot; their representation is vivid , gri@@ pping and is based in a kind of deep @-@ rac@@ ism that many people want to believe that he is no longer in America . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s hard to watch , and even more difficult to look away , but Gre@@ ene said that this is the point . &quot;
&quot; we don &apos;t want to talk about Lyn@@ x because we are confronted with its ug@@ liness in all of us , &quot; she said . &quot;
but I cannot build relationship with you if you don &apos;t want to listen to me or don &apos;t want to hear what I have done through .
&quot; the rehear@@ sals for this year &apos;s production began in June , and on the first day almost 30 actors - a dozen white and the rest bl@@ acks - into a room and listening when Gre@@ ene started a well @-@ played overview of the piece . &quot;
W@@ ade Mar@@ bau@@ gh is here Gre@@ ene Co @-@ Director .
&quot; he has played the role of Chef &apos;s member for many years , but he said that the role will never be easier . &quot;
&quot; I feel dirty because I &apos;m not that way , &quot; said Mar@@ bau@@ gh . &quot;
&quot; but I think it is very important to keep this story alive , because we do not want to return to these times . &quot;
&quot; on the other side of the room the actor Dar@@ rius Brad@@ sh@@ aw and Nick Ras@@ cona , who play Roger Mal@@ com and Bar@@ nett H@@ ester , tried their lines . &quot;
&quot; the piece starts with Mal@@ com , the H@@ ester and pushed him , fur@@ ious that he slept with his wife Dor@@ othy . &quot;
&quot; I said , n --- he , disappeared from my property ! &quot;
Ras@@ cona ref@@ utes the fire .
there is a break .
and then everyone ( at least all black actors ) breaks into laughter .
Gre@@ ene laugh@@ s at the lou@@ dest .
&quot; what ? ! &quot; , &quot; asked Ras@@ cona . &quot;
he is al@@ armed and confused .
was I too hard ?
&quot; no , &quot; Gre@@ ene said , still til@@ ting . &quot;
I simply don &apos;t think white people back then &apos; n --- he &apos; said .
&quot; but , &quot; one of the other black performers wit@@ t@@ ingly . &quot;
&quot; you only have to hit the hard &apos; R. &apos; . &quot;
&quot; and exactly there the energy shifts in space , a sense of compan@@ ionship replaces the dis@@ comfort . &quot;
&quot; everyone is busy doing this properly , not just because of the game , but also because of the memory of the four killed people . &quot;
the scene starts again .
&quot; this time , when Ras@@ cona says the N @-@ word , he says it sharp@@ ly and with im@@ print . &quot;
absolutely no one laugh@@ s .
this re@@ petition ends violent and fast .
&quot; there are scre@@ ams , shots and then silence . &quot;
&quot; a woman , dressed with a dream dress , stands above the cor@@ p@@ se of the actors and leads Bil@@ lie Holidays mour@@ ning pra@@ ises &quot; St@@ range Fruit . &quot; &quot;
your voice breaks in every second word .
&quot; about a hundred meters behind it , a group of about four dozen people caught silence and tears from the eyes . &quot;
the audience is almost ev@@ enly divided between black and white .
&quot; a couple is from I@@ th@@ aca , New York , inspired to see the performance , many come down just the street . &quot;
they have experienced all hum@@ id humidity every nearly eight hours when Broo@@ ks leads them on a pilgrimage to the tom@@ bs of Mal@@ com@@ s and Dor@@ se@@ ys .
&quot; up to this point , the mur@@ ders have remained an an@@ ec@@ d@@ ote , but now , when one stands on the same country , where the Lyn@@ ch @-@ Mor@@ de took place , the air feels sp@@ ook@@ y . &quot;
&quot; when the last notes of the song sound , Gre@@ ene invites the crowd to come closer and inspect the body name . &quot;
&quot; children ho@@ cking at their heads , register the f@@ ake blood and the silent body and whis@@ per one another . &quot;
&quot; they are not really dead , &quot; mur@@ m@@ urs a little boy , as if he wanted to remember . &quot;
&quot; after a few minutes , Gre@@ ene ow@@ es the crowd - and suddenly it is over . &quot;
the actors throw away the Lyn@@ ch rope and wi@@ pe off their tears .
&quot; Brad@@ sh@@ aw um@@ ar@@ des Mar@@ bau@@ gh , the man in the suit , who played the clan member . &quot;
Nick Ras@@ cona embr@@ aces two of his fellow players and then breaks together in her arms crying and the emotional load of the performance finally breaks with him .
&quot; it &apos;s okay , &quot; whis@@ per@@ ing one of the women . &quot;
we know that this is not in your heart .
you have done this for a reason . &quot;
&quot; later , the audience will sit together with the actors for dinner . &quot;
at a table a white pair of Atlanta gets excited about the post @-@ order with a black couple that they just got to know .
&quot; Den@@ ise Du@@ pl@@ in@@ sky fought to find words , which feeling the performance left behind . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s hard to hear these terrible words and deeds ... from people who look like you and what they do , because they look like you , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; what really does with me makes me believe that the Lyn@@ ch continues to continue , &quot; she added , &quot; today , the only police shooting is called . &quot;
&quot; in the same room , Ty@@ rone Broo@@ ks &apos;s yard holds on his table , he e@@ ats and rec@@ alls the civil rights . &quot;
he said he started planning the performance next year .
&quot; the im@@ position is inspiring in a way , because it describes the horror of what we have end@@ ure , but it is also a moment of learning , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s like we learn nothing from it , then it can happen again . &quot;
&quot; whoever does not study his own story , who doesn &apos;t know his own story , is condemned to repeat them . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Göt@@ ter@@ d@@ ämmerung &quot; &quot; reconc@@ iled the W@@ agn@@ eri@@ ans in Bay@@ reuth &quot;
&quot; in the fourth part of Richard Wagner &apos;s monumental work , director Frank Cast@@ orf put on a colorful @-@ fri@@ vol@@ e st@@ aging in front of a gigantic , six @-@ story backdrop . &quot;
&quot; the stage ( designed by Alek@@ sand@@ ar Den@@ ic ) shows a sh@@ ab@@ by street corner , including the Berlin Wall and D@@ ön@@ er@@ bu@@ de in Berlin , a &quot; paste and ivory &quot; logo from GDR times or the New York Stock Exchange . &quot;
&quot; before that , an open Mercedes classic car in which the Rhine bo@@ aters pose as Rock@@ erg@@ ir@@ ls , or alternatively an Is@@ etta . &quot;
&quot; st@@ acked oil cas@@ ks remind of Cast@@ or@@ fs Leit@@ moti@@ v - money , power and gre@@ ed - which moves through its &quot; ring &quot; st@@ aging . &quot;
&quot; the three Rh@@ en@@ ish daughters - sung by Steph@@ anie Hou@@ tz@@ e@@ el , Wi@@ eb@@ ke L@@ ehm@@ ku@@ hl and Alexandra St@@ einer - harmon@@ ize like already in the &quot; Rhein@@ gold . &quot; &quot;
&quot; K@@ ess decei@@ ves Siegfried ( Stefan Vin@@ ke ) , drag@@ ged a cor@@ p@@ se into the trunk in Hollywood @-@ Man@@ ier and enter the Kra@@ wall@@ o cli@@ que . &quot;
Stephen M@@ illing sings the wonderfully nasty Hagen that surro@@ unds the au@@ ra of a heav@@ y@@ weight box .
brutal the scene when he inv@@ ents Siegfried .
later also Gun@@ ther ( Markus oak ) has to believe on it .
the audience would like to thank the ensemble with strong appl@@ ause .
&quot; Fo@@ ster , M@@ illing , Vin@@ ke and conductor Jan@@ owski , who are humble and hands to Merkel @-@ smo@@ ked , are celebrated stor@@ my . &quot;
&quot; there is a big appl@@ ause for the festival orchestra , which shows itself on stage for the first time - given the great heat back in casual casual wear . &quot;
the performance was anticipated by Frank Cast@@ orf and his Regi@@ et@@ eam .
&quot; in 2013 , he had to leave a g@@ ell@@ ent wh@@ ist@@ le concert in 2013 , five years later , there were great rejo@@ icing in which the isolated &quot; &quot; Bu@@ h &quot; &quot; calls were under@@ going . &quot;
Fest@@ spiel@@ ch@@ ef@@ in Katharina Wagner is probably looking forward to this .
&quot; one notices that the audience has grown together with the &quot; Ring &quot; in a certain way , &quot; she had said shortly before the performance of d@@ pa . &quot;
&quot; the audience has not only made a form of peace with Cast@@ orf , but it is also an understanding of its view . &quot;
I prefer a positive res@@ ume .
max . works as a volunteer
they work at several places in their volunteer year .
where everywhere ?
&quot; quantity : usually in Stein@@ furt in the furniture exchange , once a week I help out in Gre@@ ven in the furniture bridge . &quot;
and I have also worked in the open whole day at the school .
what are your experiences with it ?
&quot; it &apos;s a nice , wide spectrum that I see here . &quot;
&quot; I have to do with different people , with young people , with refugees , with young adults . &quot;
&quot; they are now 26 years , thus a late @-@ time volunteer . &quot;
how does that come ?
quantity : I have done Ab@@ it@@ ur .
&quot; and then a civil engineer , let &apos;s say , successfully canc@@ eled . &quot;
&quot; I know for myself that it is the wrong for me , and I want to do something else , work with people . &quot;
and then I asked what you do .
&quot; make a social year , there is an insight , there you can see how it is on site , in the focal point , perhaps , really is . &quot;
and was it so ?
amount : I have collected great impressions .
&quot; in the winter semester , I will start my studies abroad . &quot;
&quot; I will study dual , probably in Ju@@ gen@@ dam@@ t Her@@ ne a social worker training and study in Ham@@ m at the University of Applied Sciences . &quot;
is it not unusual to have several different uses during the volunteer service ?
&quot; quantity : yes , it is very variable . &quot;
it always depends on where you make your FS@@ J .
it is possible to make it from Alter@@ sheim to youth work - in all possible fac@@ ets of social work .
with me it was very varied .
&quot; I was also partly in the O@@ GS , so in the afternoon care . &quot;
for me this was exactly the right thing that fascinated me .
I could recognize my own strengths and see how it really runs out .
other than in civil engineering studies ?
&quot; lot : well , here it is not about to calculate st@@ ati@@ ks . &quot;
there are always other people who have a very different story behind them .
&quot; whether a refugee , whether a teen@@ ager , who has been taken out of the family , must always be addressed individually . &quot;
very interesting .
and you did not have any reservations ?
&quot; for that , I am not the guy . &quot;
it is an area that gives a lot .
&quot; much love , great kindness . &quot;
&quot; there are also negative moments , but that &apos;s how life is . &quot;
&quot; Pear@@ son shor@@ tens another 3,000 jobs and abbrevi@@ ates the divi@@ dend to revi@@ ve the business &quot;
&quot; the British education group Pear@@ son said on Friday , they will disman@@ tle more 3,000 jobs and cut off their divi@@ dend by 72 percent since another restructuring programme is started to overcome the pressure that the company is facing . &quot;
&quot; job cuts , the general director John Fall@@ on , announced predominantly for the end of 2018 and early 2019 , comes in addition to its previous restructuring in which 4,000 places already lost . &quot;
&quot; in May , Pear@@ son announced a plan for cost reduction by another 300 million pounds ( 394 million US dollars ) in May in order to revi@@ ve a business that was hit by the fast step towards digital learning . &quot;
&quot; the company , which had expressed its stake in Pen@@ guin Rand@@ om House in Ber@@ tel@@ smann last month , said that the outlook for the fiscal year was unchanged after the first half of the year posted an increase of 1 percent to 2,@@ 05 billion pounds . &quot;
Kon@@ vo@@ i @-@ Attack of Kab@@ ul : NATO soldier killed in su@@ icide attack
&quot; a su@@ icide bom@@ ber attacked a military con@@ voy in the Afgh@@ an capital Kab@@ ul , killed a soldier of N@@ ato and injured several others , said officials . &quot;
&quot; five soldiers and one interpreter were injured , shared a NATO Declaration . &quot;
&quot; according to local reports , three civilians died at the incident in Q@@ arab@@ ag@@ h district . &quot;
the bom@@ bing is the last violence that Afghanistan has hit this month - more than 30 people were killed in a mos@@ que in Her@@ at on Tuesday .
on Monday a su@@ icide bom@@ ber killed two people near the Iraqi emb@@ assy in Kab@@ ul .
&quot; in an opinion of NATO , the explosion on Thursday evening was to happen when a common pat@@ rol with the Afgh@@ an army was attacked by a &quot; &quot; impro@@ vised &quot; &quot; explo@@ iting sentence . &quot;
the statement states that all the injured were in a stable condition and treated in the US military hospital at Bag@@ ram Air@@ field .
correspon@@ dents say that the growing strength of the Taliban and the group known as the so @-@ called Islamic State ( IS ) in Q@@ arab@@ ag@@ h is a great concern for NATO troops in the nearby Bag@@ ram .
&quot; according to the United Nations , there were at least 1,6@@ 62 civilian cas@@ u@@ alties in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017 , about 20 % in the capital . &quot;
&quot; at the end of July , a su@@ icide @-@ auto@@ om@@ be killed at least 30 people in a chi@@ ef@@ ly Shi@@ ite District of Kab@@ ul . &quot;
the Taliban said they had executed this attack .
&quot; on 31 May , a massive bombar@@ d@@ ment was killed in the centre of the city more than 150 people with the most deadly milit@@ ant attack of the country , since the US @-@ led troops forced the Taliban from power in 2001 . &quot;
&quot; the violence under@@ lines the prec@@ ari@@ ous security situation in Afghanistan , as US President Donald Tru@@ mp is weighing up the number of U.S. troops to support military and police in the country . &quot;
&quot; correspon@@ dents say that the su@@ icide bom@@ bers in Kab@@ ul have also caused a crisis of public confidence in the government , their policies and especially in the call of President As@@ hr@@ af Gh@@ ani . &quot;
EPA returns decision to delay the smooth@@ ie rule after pl@@ agues
&quot; the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has a decision to delay a regulation of the Obama administration , abol@@ ishing what the states are obliged to ins@@ ure the smo@@ g @-@ causing emissions . this was a day after 15 states accused the agency because of the step@@ per . &quot;
&quot; the EPA announced late on Wednesday to advance the decision to advance the so @-@ called &quot; o@@ zone regulations , &quot; and said they show the agency &apos;s commitment to work with states . &quot;
&quot; we believe in dialogue with and that we respond to our state partners , &quot; said EPA boss Scott P@@ ru@@ itt in an explanation . &quot;
&quot; P@@ ru@@ itt had announced the EPA &apos;s intention in June to determine o@@ zone regulations , in which poll@@ ut@@ ant emissions have to be measured in order to comply with stric@@ ter air quality standards - to delay a year by October 2018 . &quot;
&quot; a group of 15 mostly democratic states , along with the district of Colombia , filed the Tuesday law@@ suit and said that the effort was illegal . &quot;
&quot; the government of President Donald Tru@@ mp has tried to rec@@ laim a wide range of environmental issues imposed by the former President Barack Obama , as part of a broader agenda , which is to boost economic growth according to Tru@@ mp . &quot;
&quot; however , efforts have caused the set@@ backs of democr@@ ats and conservation groups that worry about the effects of larger emissions on public health . &quot;
&quot; the EPA &apos;s website says that breathing air , the o@@ zone contains &quot; reduce lung function and rein@@ force respiratory symptoms &quot; such as as@@ thma . &quot;
Gemein@@ der@@ at wants community space
&quot; at the end , the decision was clear : in two counter @-@ voices , the Municipal Council of Flu@@ orn @-@ Win@@ tw@@ ins decides to set up a communal space in the future Senior Res@@ idential Complex . &quot;
&quot; before the discussion , there is an important information : the purchase contract for the still missing part of the property was signed , reported mayor Bernhard T@@ j@@ aden . &quot;
&quot; although the church community is still owned by the church until now , there is no planning permission for the project to be st@@ em@@ med by a private investor . &quot;
there is a discussion regarding a common room .
&quot; one of the two investors who still are in the boat , offered to meet the church . &quot;
&quot; on the ground floor , it would provide a living space - about 55 square meters - and an adjacent terrace with at least 70 square meters of space for a special price . &quot;
&quot; the administration and the majority of the municipal council are floating in front of such a communal area not as a meeting place only for the residents of the sen@@ i@@ ent living , but openly in the church . &quot;
&quot; as an example , the word &quot; Stri@@ ck@@ café &quot; made the round . &quot;
the decision made by the provision of funds for the current budget has already been decided last autumn by means of funding opportunities .
the building is located in the renovation area .
&quot; the establishment of a common room would be , so T@@ j@@ aden reports , with 60 percent of 30 percent eligible . &quot;
&quot; the proposed suggestion is to signal the investor that in this respect it does not want to throw a bill@@ ets between the legs , the conclusion that both saddle - what reduces the lifting height and the construction of economic power - would be possible . &quot;
&quot; need@@ less to say , not only Wil@@ fried Soh@@ mer , be this addition . &quot;
when it helps : unanim@@ ously he happens to the body .
not as easy as the common room .
&quot; Daniela &apos;s reputation refers to the many of its own buildings , with which one does not go so well , but now you rest in the common room out of the window , she says , &quot; &quot; I am gri@@ eved . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Y@@ vonne Sta@@ iger is absolutely speaking for the common room - but absolutely against a community participation .
it sees behind it a conce@@ aled subsi@@ dy to any wealth or even foreign investors .
&quot; this is not so , because with the acquisition of the area there is no allowance , but get a real counter@@ part in the case of doubt , is the counter @-@ talk . &quot;
&quot; sta@@ ig@@ ers proposal to apply the proposal accordingly , finds three advoc@@ ates . &quot;
&quot; so it remains in two contra@@ sts with the original program that Stefan H@@ aller summar@@ izes : &quot; if we touch the decision , we make a giant step to close a huge gap in our infrastructure . &quot;
coll@@ ision by car : Rad@@ ler is thrown onto the street
&quot; while crossing the street , a 82 @-@ year @-@ old cycl@@ ist was captured on Wednesday in Gar@@ ath by a car and badly injured . &quot;
&quot; as the police hur@@ ried , the 82 @-@ year @-@ old Lan@@ gen@@ felder had been travelling with his bike on the bicycle path of the Schwar@@ zer route from the direction of Hil@@ den . &quot;
the Senior wanted to cross the road@@ way at the height of the street Am Buch@@ hol@@ zer Busch .
&quot; one in the same direction , the driver &apos;s driver , granted him priority . &quot;
&quot; when the Lan@@ gen@@ felder went on the road , he apparently did not pay attention to the traffic . &quot;
he met with a car that led a 66 @-@ year @-@ old Hil@@ den@@ erin .
the man was thrown onto the street .
he suffered severe injuries and was brought to a hospital with a retreat wagon .
FC Bayern Munich must ref@@ rain from the Super@@ cup against Bor@@ us@@ sia Dortmund on David Al@@ aba and Thi@@ ago
the Super@@ cup takes place without him : David Al@@ aba has to make the game against Dortmund .
&quot; with personnel care , the FC Bayern will travel to Dortmund for the first mandatory play of the new season . &quot;
seven professionals are missing the title def@@ ender in the Super@@ cup against the cup winner .
the personnel care at the German Football record master Bayern München are getting bigger in front of the Super@@ cup on Saturday ( 20.@@ 30 pm / ZDF and Euro@@ sport ) at Po@@ kal@@ si@@ eger Bor@@ us@@ sia Dortmund .
coach Carlo An@@ cel@@ otti does not have to do without the BV@@ B also on David Al@@ aba .
this was confirmed by the Italian on Friday .
&quot; in addition , the Mün@@ ch@@ nern Manuel Neu@@ er , James , Thi@@ ago , Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng , Ar@@ j@@ en Rob@@ ben and Juan Bern@@ at are missing . &quot;
&quot; for the five defe@@ ats in the last six trials , An@@ cel@@ otti has made the physical condition and the missing balance in the game of his team . &quot;
&quot; we know that we are not in the best physical condition , &quot; said An@@ cel@@ otti and added : &quot; the most important point is the balance in the team . &quot;
&quot; last but not least , it was not good . &quot;
but the 58 @-@ year @-@ old believes in an increase in power in the first official compulsory game of the season .
&quot; football is also tactics , strategy , personality and motivation . &quot;
I have great confidence that my team shows these qualities .
the team is ready .
&quot; we want to play intellig@@ ently , &quot; said An@@ cel@@ otti , who expects a &quot; difficult , intense game . &quot; &quot;
the du@@ el of the two German football heav@@ y@@ weights draws the fans in their spell .
&quot; the game is sold out with 8@@ 1,@@ 360 spectators , the German Football League ( DF@@ L ) announced on Friday . &quot;
hiking in the Harz Mountains to Stern
&quot; in the resin , the nation@@ wide &quot; &quot; star trail &quot; &quot; is to be created . &quot;
this is planned by the Verein Stern@@ warte Sankt Andre@@ as@@ berg .
there is a planet away in Göttingen - since 2003 .
&quot; a &quot; &quot; star trail &quot; &quot; came to meet the information needs of many visitors , it was called it . &quot;
&quot; he combines nature , science , movement and sporting performance . &quot;
the members want to set up tables along the planned route and inform about stars and con@@ stell@@ ations .
&quot; in the first phase until 2018 , the association is planning &quot; &quot; easily accessible installations at five to six locations &quot; &quot; in Ober@@ har@@ z . &quot;
&quot; ask St. Andre@@ as@@ berg , Braun@@ lage , Hoh@@ eg@@ ei@@ ß and Si@@ eber . &quot;
the information on the boards should be supplemented by the internet .
&quot; therefore , a good mobile net reception plays a role in the location selection . &quot;
accessibility is also a criterion .
&quot; later , the star trail should be extended by train . &quot;
&quot; on the path@@ way , the viewers experience a lot of knowledge , for example about the physics of the individual stars , &quot; explained the association . &quot;
&quot; in addition , they learned why stars would have different colors or why a star lighter than another , although it is much further away . &quot;
&quot; also , in which con@@ stellation you find a selected star and when it is best to see . &quot;
&quot; since 2014 , the association operates in the Berg@@ städ@@ tchen St. Andre@@ as@@ berg , the highest observ@@ atory in Northern Germany . &quot;
&quot; according to the Federal Office of Nature Conservation , the location in the middle of the Harz National Park counts as one of the six most dark@@ est regions in Germany . &quot;
often from there the Mil@@ ky Way and even the Andro@@ med@@ a galax@@ y with naked eye can be seen clearly .
&quot; in the university city , there is something similar to the planned star @-@ wer@@ g from the Plan@@ etary Path from 2003 on the initiative of the Planet@@ arium Göttingen . &quot;
&quot; starting at Geb@@ h@@ ard &apos;s hotel in the Goe@@ the@@ alle@@ e , which forms the interior of our solar system , the planet goes along with its stel@@ ae to the H@@ ain@@ berg and to the observ@@ atory - as well as an ex@@ tr@@ ater@@ restrial &quot; site in Di@@ emar@@ den ( municipality Glei@@ chen ) with the planet Sed@@ na . &quot;
the stel@@ ae with the individual planets - including the Plu@@ to D@@ warf @-@ Plan@@ ned Plu@@ to at the end point - are positioned exactly at the distance and scale of one to two billion .
&quot; the earth shr@@ inks to a sphere of 6,5 milli@@ metres in diameter , while the sun is exactly 75 metres long and measures 70 centimet@@ ers . &quot;
the entire distance of the planet is about four kilometers .
&quot; while the light from Sun takes about eight hours , pedestri@@ ans need a good hour to the st@@ ele with Plu@@ to . &quot;
pedestrian is therefore faster than the light in the universe .
the march to the next fix@@ ture however would last half a year .
&quot; MI@@ KE@@ Y Gar@@ cia and Vas@@ yl Lom@@ ach@@ enko meet for the first time , discuss a possible show@@ down &quot;
&quot; Vas@@ yl Lom@@ ach@@ enko and Mi@@ key Gar@@ cia , who should stand in a coll@@ ision course in the near future of 147 pounds , met for the first time on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; they were in separate rooms at ES@@ PN offices in Los Angeles , to Gar@@ cia , the un@@ defeated World Box@@ ing Council lightweight champion , down the cor@@ ridor to welcome Lom@@ ach@@ enko , the World Box@@ ing Organisation Super @-@ Feder@@ ated Champion . &quot;
&quot; after Gar@@ cia &apos;s victory through unanim@@ ous decision about the former four @-@ divisions world champion Adri@@ en Bron@@ er on Saturday at Show@@ time , both fighters are members of the top Five Po@@ und @-@ for Po@@ und @-@ List . &quot;
&quot; Gar@@ cia stretched out his right hand and said , &quot; &quot; How is it to you , Champion ? &quot;
I wish you a lot of luck . &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ enko def@@ ends his belt against Miguel Marri@@ aga on Saturday evening at 7 p.m. on ES@@ PN .
&quot; as the couple posed for photos , Lom@@ ach@@ enko Manager Eg@@ is Klim@@ as noted that a possible show@@ down between the fighters would be the &quot; perfect scale . &quot; &quot;
&quot; I am a former spring weight , &quot; Gar@@ cia remembered . &quot;
&quot; I grew up for the Bron@@ er &#91; on 140 pounds &#93; , but I &apos;m not so big . &quot;
I am small for 140 .
I would like to come down on lightweight .
and he must move to light weight &#91; 135 pounds &#93; and then we fight .
this is asking the fans .
let us give them that . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Lom@@ ach@@ enko said . &quot;
&quot; boxing needs this fight . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Klim@@ as asked if it should be on Pay @-@ per @-@ View , part of a strategy that Lom@@ ach@@ enko must fight with a 135 pound debut in this year ( 37 @-@ 0 , 30 kno@@ ck@@ outs ) who also has an interest in the fight against the winner of Jor@@ ge Lin@@ ares @-@ Luke Camp@@ bell after their lightweight title combat in the forum on September 23 . &quot;
&quot; this fight could take place in Pay @-@ per @-@ View mode because all fans were asked about him , &quot; &quot; said Gar@@ cia and later op@@ ted to fight on the network that offers the best financial package . &quot;
we are the best .
no other names can create this kind of attention .
whenever they are ready ... &quot;
&quot; Gar@@ cia said , he sets Lom@@ ach@@ enko as &quot; an enormous fighter , &quot; and he might take part in his Saturday fight . &quot;
&quot; but Lom@@ ach@@ enko held in the generous praise for Gar@@ cia and said that he thinks the three @-@ fight champion from River@@ side look very slowly , sorry Mi@@ key ... you wanted the co @-@ Aus . &quot;
&quot; Gar@@ cia said , the focus is to show stroke , then boxes . &quot;
&quot; both said , they could feel the momentum that was built up for its own struggle . &quot;
this is the fight that must be done .
no other fight creates so much attention and enthusiasm .
&quot; I am more than happy to work on it , &quot; &quot; said Gar@@ cia . &quot;
&quot; Lom@@ ach@@ enko said : &quot; &quot; I have been waiting for the top fighters , and this is Mi@@ key . &quot;
it will be a great fight . &quot;
four injured after tyre space
&quot; during an accident on the A7 , four people were severely injured on Thursday afternoon . &quot;
&quot; after the first information , the driver of an Opel Z@@ af@@ ira has lost its control over his vehicle at 16.@@ 30 . &quot;
the car drove to the right into the em@@ bank@@ ment where he sur@@ passed and then remained on the roof in the green stri@@ pe .
the four occup@@ ants - two adults and two children - were severely injured in the accident .
&quot; during the initial supply of the injured by the rescue service , the A7 was closed toward the north for about an hour , then traffic could be passed on the left driving strip at the accident site . &quot;
&quot; Hoffmann : &quot; &quot; triple chain works better &quot; &quot; &quot;
Andr@@ e Hoffmann hopes for the 2 : 2 to the season op@@ ener against Braunschweig that optimi@@ zing the def@@ ensive formation in Au@@ e points .
&quot; with the first season of the season Andr@@ e Hoffmann was happy with the result , as well , there weren &apos;t the two opponents at the 2 : 2 against Braunschweig . &quot;
&quot; these were two oppos@@ ites too much , and we have to fit in Au@@ e even better , &quot; &quot; says the defense player from Fort@@ una Düsseldorf . &quot;
in the Or@@ e Mountains the chain can also be further optimized .
&quot; and a gate after an off@@ shoot , the Fort@@ un@@ ae do not want to catch up . &quot;
&quot; for the future , it will be so that no more will be placed next to Michael ( R@@ ens@@ ing ) . &quot;
Hoffmann is convinced that his team is better prepared for the experience in preparation with the chain of chains than with the four @-@ chain .
&quot; I don &apos;t know how we are going to act in Au@@ e , &quot; says his coach Fried@@ helm Funk@@ el , but Hoffmann is his thing safe , &quot; because we have just in the three chain on the semi @-@ positions in Ka@@ an Ay@@ han and Nik@@ o G@@ ieß@@ el@@ mann who can build up well , &quot; said Hoffmann . &quot;
&quot; the prerequisite is , but that we harmon@@ ize even better , and we don &apos;t have so much mistakes in the building . &quot;
&quot; of course , Hoffmann also drives to Au@@ e to win the game . &quot;
&quot; but if you can speak after a draw from a mis@@ erable start , don &apos;t know . &quot;
&quot; the performance could be quite okay , &quot; said Hoffmann . &quot;
&quot; but if we can stay on Sunday with four points and we can concentrate on the cup , we will certainly be able to speak of a decent season op@@ ener . &quot;
his trainer didn &apos;t want to know anything about it .
&quot; the start into the season I judged only after six to eight playing days , &quot; said Fried@@ helm Funk@@ el , who didn &apos;t want to speak of an advantage over Au@@ e just because the game of Saxony in Hei@@ den@@ heim had to be cancelled pre@@ matur@@ ely because of an accident . &quot;
&quot; now they can start the season almost with a home game , &quot; Funk@@ el and Hoffmann believe that the players from Au@@ e might even be a bit more fresh , as they would have no heavy and complete game like Fort@@ una against an as@@ cen@@ sion favourite in the bones . &quot;
&quot; but they do not know as 100 % , where they are currently standing , &quot; says the def@@ ender of Fort@@ una . &quot;
&quot; while the guests from the Rhin@@ eland as a light favorite on Sunday , go to the meeting at last ( almost ) finished stadium of Au@@ e . &quot;
&quot; that we swe@@ ep them away , just because we are entitled to come under the first six is stup@@ idity , &quot; says Funk@@ el , whose balance is quite positive with only one defeat against Au@@ e from nine games . &quot;
&quot; there is no team in the 2nd Bundes@@ liga , which you have to beat from the start , &quot; says Fort@@ un@@ as Chef@@ coach . &quot;
&quot; such a statement would be arrogan@@ t and arrogan@@ t . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and so Funk@@ el does not want to experience his players on Sunday .
new results of Swedish asylum @-@ aged application tests published
&quot; the recent results of tests for asylum seek@@ ers in Sweden , which were subjected to a new method for medical assessment of their age , show that over 80 percent of the tested persons are older than 18 years . but not everyone believes in the accuracy of these results . &quot;
the Swedish Auth@@ orities for For@@ en@@ sic Medicine ( R@@ ät@@ ts@@ medic@@ inal@@ verk@@ et ) started carrying out tests last year .
&quot; during the asylum procedure , they should take a closer look at the assessment of the age after the Swedish migration authority ( Mig@@ r@@ ations@@ verk@@ et ) was cri@@ tici@@ zed for errors in ass@@ essing the correct age of some refugees who were inferior . &quot;
&quot; until today , Mig@@ r@@ ations@@ verk@@ et 6.@@ 880 has been sent to test cases and the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency has now published the results of a total of 2,@@ 481 tests from the period from mid March to 31 July 2017 . &quot;
&quot; eigh@@ ty percent ( 2002 ) were judged as 18 or older , while in other 25 cases the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency was judged that the person was &quot; possibly 18 years or older . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in 432 cases , the conclusion was that the person &quot; may be under 18 years old . &quot;
the tests are carried out only in cases where the age of the person is ques@@ tioned .
&quot; according to Johan Gö@@ ran@@ sson from the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency , the results have been sustained during the past few months . &quot;
&quot; we don &apos;t see a big difference in statistics of the past months , the numbers are fairly constant , &quot; he said the magazine The Local . &quot;
the high proportion of cases where the person was judged over 18 years does not necessarily mean that asylum seek@@ ers have lied about his age .
&quot; in May , the Agency released the results of 5@@ 81 tests and said that there will be 442 cases that &quot; suggest that the subjects were 18 years or older . &quot;
&quot; when the newspaper Sv@@ ens@@ ka Dag@@ bl@@ a@@ det examined the results published in 5@@ 81 , she discovered that in 243 these cases the person had said openly that she will be 18 years old this year . &quot;
&quot; the method of medical age assessment , during the X @-@ ray imaging of wisdom teeth and M@@ RI images of knee joints , which are then analysed by dentists and radi@@ ologists , was also cri@@ tici@@ zed in some areas . &quot;
&quot; a scep@@ tic is the endo@@ cr@@ in@@ ologist Claude Marcus of the Kar@@ ol@@ in@@ ska Institute , whose work embr@@ aces the evaluation of the biological maturity of humans to see if they went earlier or later as usual by pu@@ ber@@ ty . &quot;
I had reason to think about it and I don &apos;t think the type of measurement should be used .
jud@@ ging the biological age in this way is very uncer@@ tain .
&quot; if we cannot say it certainly , we should not pret@@ end as if we could , &quot; he said the newspaper metro . &quot;
&quot; Gö@@ ran@@ sson from For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency , however , def@@ ended the accuracy of the tests : &quot; in general , you can say that the risk of jud@@ ging a child as an adult is low . &quot;
&quot; the greatest risk is when the person is under 18 , in this case it is about 10 percent . &quot;
fully in the plan
works on the three bridges of the Land@@ straße 108 between Lau@@ ter@@ bach and Sch@@ ram@@ berg are progres@@ sing well .
&quot; on Wednesday , a seven tonnes of heavy concrete was installed on the bridge at the eastern entrance of Lau@@ ter@@ bach . &quot;
&quot; we are very good at the time , it runs great , &quot; says Rein@@ hold Lei@@ cht , manager at the Department of Road Systems and Transport in the Pres@@ idency of Freiburg . &quot;
&quot; in April , the work began simultaneously on all three building bridges between Sch@@ ram@@ berg and Lau@@ ter@@ bach . &quot;
the end of the building is planned for October and is sure that the schedule is maintained .
&quot; the first bridge , coming from Sch@@ ram@@ berg , leads over the Tro@@ mb@@ ach . &quot;
it is a v@@ aul@@ ted arch bridge of concrete covered with red Bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein and has a total length of 4.@@ 80 meters .
it was built in 1900 .
&quot; like the two other bridges , it has now come into the years . &quot;
&quot; in order to ensure stability and road safety , the three buildings are now thoroughly renovated . &quot;
the two other bridges lead over the Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
they are built of red Bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein .
&quot; both were built in 1939 and are twelve , respectively 10.@@ 60 meters long . &quot;
&quot; on Wednesday morning the bridge at the entrance of Lau@@ ter@@ bach has received 1,@@ 30 meters wide and seven tonnes heavy so @-@ called bridge @-@ cap on Wednesday morning . &quot;
this is a rim attachment that is also used as an operation path .
on the southern part of the bridge a 2.@@ 20 m wide bridge cap should be used on Friday .
then the pedestrian walk@@ way should go .
&quot; the special thing is that these are finished parts , a patent from the Sch@@ ram@@ berger company Di@@ zw@@ o . &quot;
the other two bridges are already equipped with the patented bridge caps .
special finger@@ tip feeling has promp@@ ted the laying of lines through the building in Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
because there is also a fibre @-@ optic cable attached to which many companies are connected .
the residents were informed in advance of the work by hand@@ writing about the project .
&quot; in addition , fish and cru@@ st@@ ace@@ ans had to be eaten . &quot;
&quot; for bridges between the building yard and the bus@@ h@@ ort in the direction of Sch@@ ram@@ berg , traffic is regulated by a traffic light . &quot;
&quot; for construction work on the bridge at the Lau@@ ter@@ bach town entrance , the street in the area of the bridge at the height of the hotels &quot; Tann@@ enhof &quot; and &quot; Seven Lin@@ den &quot; is fully blocked . &quot;
the cost of the three bridges is 700 000 euros .
the whole thing is financed by the country .
Af@@ D in Ger@@ ol@@ stein : under Prot@@ est with German Pot@@ ato Sal@@ ad
&quot; it is not so common that parties pull at one strand , but when it comes to the alternative for Germany ( Af@@ D ) comes together , which is otherwise difficult to put under a hat . &quot;
&quot; the parties represented in the Krei@@ d Vulkan@@ ei@@ fel ( CD@@ U , SPD , Grün@@ e , F@@ DP , F@@ WG , Linke ) belong to a broad alliance that is peaceful on this day , because the Af@@ D invites in the Ger@@ ol@@ st@@ einer Stadthalle Ron@@ dell to the loud poster &quot; &quot; great election campaign &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; and conf@@ essed names to the start brings - like Alice Wei@@ del , who together with Alexander Gau@@ land forms the top duo for the Bundestag election on September 24 , and the Deputy Chairman of the Beat@@ rix of Stor@@ k . &quot;
&quot; but those who are on site already hours before the start of the event do not want to listen to the Af@@ D , but demonstrate . &quot;
the motto &quot; The Eifel stays colorful . &quot;
&quot; originally the city @-@ picnic under the motto &quot; &quot; All at a table &quot; &quot; on the fountain , is now taking place on the parking lot below the R@@ ond@@ ells - and thus directly in front of the eyes of those who come to the Af@@ D event in the Stadthalle . &quot;
a colorful picture that offers .
&quot; and what Christ@@ a Kar@@ oli , chairman of the forum One World and one of the author@@ it@@ ative organizers , is really happy : &quot; great how many people have come together here . &quot;
&quot; there are music and lots of food , among them a &quot; &quot; German potato salad that could also eat Af@@ D without any problems , &quot; &quot; says the woman who brought him . &quot;
&quot; the police ordered many officials to Ger@@ ol@@ stein , it shows presence above all at the train station , which is only a few meters away from the venues . &quot;
how did Af@@ D come to Ger@@ ol@@ stein ?
&quot; Mario Hom@@ pes reported by Af@@ D Vulkan@@ ei@@ fel , he tried to make such an event and get the supplement . &quot;
&quot; the 45 year old from G@@ ön@@ ner@@ sdorf first asked in Dau@@ n , but there was a cancellation , because because of the already built Lau@@ r@@ enti@@ us@@ kir@@ mes there are not enough parking spaces available . &quot;
&quot; now the Ron@@ dell , Hom@@ pes is pleased that &quot; we can have such a nice event here . &quot; &quot;
&quot; he says : &quot; &quot; this is the good right of the people , the main thing , it remains peaceful . &quot;
&quot; this also does it : at about 8 p.m. on the R@@ ond@@ ell@@ platz , there is a band for entertainment , in the Stadthalle of various speakers , among them the rh@@ ein@@ land @-@ pf@@ äl@@ z@@ ische Af@@ D @-@ chairman Uwe Junge . &quot;
&quot; the audi@@ torium is about 200 list@@ eners , who are waiting for the leading candidate for the Bundestag election , Alice Wei@@ del , and the Deputy Chairman of the Beat@@ rix of Stor@@ ch . &quot;
&quot; the police force remains unchanged , but so far the officials had a quiet evening . &quot;
&quot; a little more than an hour , the Af@@ D event , the guests on the forec@@ our@@ t have a longer breath , but also there is short after 21 o &apos;clock . &quot;
the police can cancel - no special inci@@ dents .
tro@@ mb@@ one meets trumpet
&quot; a re@@ petition with the Wolf@@ acher Pos@@ a@@ uni@@ sten Freder@@ ic B@@ elli , in the series Has@@ l@@ acher Kloster@@ konz@@ erte tomorrow , Sunday , at 8 o &apos;clock in the monastery church . &quot;
&quot; together with Bulgarian trump@@ eter Mi@@ ros@@ lav Pet@@ kov , he gives a concert under the motto &quot; Black Sea meets Black Forest , &quot; or &quot; Bal@@ kan@@ folklore &quot; meets a classical German training with roots in brass music . &quot;
both solo@@ ists are winners and winners of numerous international competitions and have sol@@ op@@ osi@@ tions in Europe &apos;s leading orchest@@ ras .
so Pet@@ kov Sol@@ ot@@ ro@@ mp@@ eter is the famous Concer@@ t@@ geb@@ ou@@ w Orchester Amsterdam and Freder@@ ic B@@ elli is Sol@@ op@@ os@@ aun@@ ist &apos;s SWR Symphony Orchestra .
&quot; both unite the desire not only to cross the boundaries on their instruments , but also to merge the boundaries of different gen@@ res . &quot;
&quot; Johann Sebastian Bach so@@ unded like in a new garment , Daniel Schn@@ y@@ ders &quot; world music &quot; together with Bulgarian folklore , and in the piece &quot; Exchange suite &quot; of the jazz musician N@@ ils W@@ ogram , combine classical , jazz and free games to a fascinating overall artwork . &quot;
this cent@@ er@@ piece of the program was premier@@ ed this spring with a huge success in Freiburg .
the renowned composer N@@ ils W@@ ogram wrote it specifically for the two musicians and more : the Has@@ l@@ acher Klo@@ st@@ erk@@ ir@@ che with her special acousti@@ cs is consciously involved in the concert .
Kri@@ sten Stew@@ art talks about her bis@@ exu@@ ality
&quot; some people love gr@@ illed cheese and will eat it until the end of their lives .
&quot; but I want to try everything , &quot; &quot; says Kri@@ sten Stew@@ art openly about her bis@@ exu@@ ality . &quot;
&quot; once I bite into gr@@ illed cheese , I think : &apos; Oh that was cool , what comes next ? &apos; . &quot;
&quot; the most well @-@ known relationship of Hollywood stars was that of her &quot; Twi@@ light &quot; colleague Robert P@@ att@@ inson , who finally dealt with bit@@ terly . &quot;
&quot; despite all this ass@@ ures the brunette act@@ ress in relation to the &quot; &quot; Har@@ per &apos;s B@@ az@@ aar &quot; &quot; magazine : &quot; &quot; I was in love with all I had done . &quot;
&quot; or do you think , I would have played it ? &quot;
&quot; after her separation , critics admit that she was bis@@ exual : &quot; I always lived and seriously believed the du@@ alism . &quot;
so it has never been confused or hin@@ dered .
I have never been able to be taken seriously .
&quot; especially among them suffered it no@@ isy &quot; &quot; Bang Show@@ biz &quot; &quot; but in the school time when she preferred to dress like a boy : &quot; not all girls are typical girls . &quot;
that really hurt me .
&quot; when I was eleven , the children told me , I would look like a boy . &quot;
&quot; I really felt attacked , frigh@@ tened and ashamed . &quot;
&quot; now I look back and think myself : &apos; girl , be proud of you ! &apos; . &quot;
&quot; especially the public , they don &apos;t like to declare their love life : &quot; people expect you to put yourself in a certain way and that anno@@ ys me . &quot;
&quot; and perhaps some people call me un@@ grateful , but I don &apos;t like to justify myself from all the public . &quot;
West Virginia Gover@@ nor announces that he changes the party
&quot; the democratic governor of West Virginia , Jim Justice , announced Thursday evening with President Tru@@ mp that he will change the party . &quot;
&quot; whether you like it or not , the democr@@ ats have removed from me , &quot; &quot; said Gover@@ nor Justice . &quot;
&quot; today I will tell you with lots of prayers and lots of re@@ thinking ... today , I will tell you as inhabitants of West Virginia , I can &apos;t help you if I am a democratic governor . &quot;
the rally broke out in jubil@@ ation .
&quot; tomorrow I will change my registration to the Republi@@ cans , &quot; &quot; added Justice . &quot;
&quot; as a trainer , I would say it &apos;s time to play another game . &quot;
Mr. Tru@@ mp promised before a big announcement at the West Virginia rally .
Mr. Tru@@ mp won West Virginia with 42 points and Justice won &apos;t endor@@ se the democratic candidate Hill@@ ary Clinton .
&quot; according to For@@ bes , Justice , which is the only billi@@ on@@ aire in the state , was elected in 2016 . &quot;
For@@ bes states that he has coal mines in five states and inherited a coal store by his father .
it is worth $ 1.@@ 59 billion .
&quot; in the meantime , the Republi@@ can National Committee published an explanation on Thursday evening in which it said : &quot; &quot; the party change of Gover@@ nor Justice is another blow to a Democratic party that would rather hin@@ der us than to make our country great again . &quot;
&quot; with only 15 provinces and the control of the least legislative bodies in history , the announcement of Gover@@ nor Justice is merely the final rejection of a party that is from top to bottom without guidance , and is unable to find a positive , coher@@ ent message , &quot; said the R@@ NC chair@@ person Ron@@ na Mc@@ Daniel in an explanation of the C@@ BS News . &quot;
Co@@ E pra@@ ises &quot; honest &quot; Russian exc@@ use for dop@@ ing sc@@ andal
&quot; world leader of athle@@ tics , Sebastian Co@@ e , praised on Thursday what he described as an obvious exc@@ use from Russia to a dop@@ ing sc@@ andal , but he repeated it was not the moment for the country to be recorded in sports . &quot;
&quot; Russia &apos;s athle@@ tics leader D@@ mit@@ ry Sh@@ yl@@ akh@@ tin said during the I@@ A@@ AF Congress on the eve of the athle@@ tics world champ@@ ionships , that the exile of his country was correct and that he was determined to fight the dop@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; he said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m sorry for &quot; &quot; all athletes who were caught away in competitions of gold and silver medals . &quot;
&quot; despite his comments , the I@@ A@@ AF Congress was voted for the maintenance of the prohibition that was imposed in November 2015 after a report of the World Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency ( WA@@ DA ) had found evidence of state @-@ funded dop@@ ing in Russia . &quot;
&quot; I thought it was a very open answer today , a very honest presentation , &quot; said I@@ A@@ AF President Co@@ e the Repor@@ ters . &quot;
the whole council and the entire Congress were delighted that the Russian Federation has recognised by itself that it has experienced some pretty hot times and will do everything possible to make sure the Federation is re@@ designed .
&quot; Co@@ E said he was also &quot; &quot; pleased &quot; &quot; that Russia accepted the criteria for its re @-@ launch . &quot;
&quot; I think it was a very constructive day , and I think that progress was made , but Congress does not support the recommendations of the Task Force that this is not the moment to re@@ use Russia again , &quot; said Co@@ e . &quot;
we have to do everything in the next few months to norm@@ alize this situation .
&quot; the guiding principle was always that we wanted to separate the clean ath@@ l@@ ete from the cor@@ rupted system , &quot; he added &quot;
&quot; ninet@@ een Russian athletes will start at the World Athle@@ tics Championships , which begin on Friday in London , following the strict I@@ A@@ AF criteria as neutral players . &quot;
&quot; the leader of the I@@ A@@ AF Task Force , R@@ une Ander@@ sen , said on Monday that Russia must meet some of the criteria for re @-@ adjustment . &quot;
&quot; threatening tests are still in@@ adequate and prohibited coaches are still free , he said repor@@ ters in London after a lecture at the I@@ A@@ AF Council . &quot;
funer@@ al ceremony for soldiers station@@ ed in Mali
&quot; at a funer@@ al party in the North @-@ Hes@@ sian Fr@@ itz@@ lar , around 1000 people of the two have thought of a helicop@@ ter crash in Mali . &quot;
the ceremony took place on Thursday in the cathedral town under high security measures .
&quot; the Minister of Defence , Ursula von der Le@@ yen ( CD@@ U ) said nothing . &quot;
they described the two in@@ verse drivers as &quot; experts in their field . &quot;
&quot; we bow down to this highest sacrifice which they have provided in the name of the Federal Republic of Germany , &quot; &quot; she explained . &quot;
the 33 @-@ year @-@ old Major and the 47 @-@ year @-@ old Stab@@ sh@@ aup@@ t@@ mann from Nord@@ h@@ essen had died on Wednesday a week in West African Mali .
their s@@ war@@ fs were transferred to Germany and on Thursday accompanied by a dead guard of the German Army in the Fr@@ itz@@ lar@@ er Dom Saint Peter .
&quot; at noon , only the members of the church took f@@ are@@ well . &quot;
&quot; after that , the funer@@ al party began in the circle of the family , close friends , representatives of the Bundes@@ wehr as well as politics . &quot;
&quot; among them were H@@ ess@@ ens Prime Minister Volker Bou@@ ff@@ ier ( CD@@ U ) , and the general inspec@@ tor of the German army Volker Wi@@ ek@@ er . &quot;
&quot; ro@@ ses laid down ro@@ ses , the families were arm in arm on the s@@ war@@ fs . &quot;
&quot; before the church , Fr@@ itz@@ lar@@ er and numerous soldiers persec@@ uted the ceremony on a screen . &quot;
&quot; Minister of Defence from the Le@@ yen called the &quot; &quot; highly decorated &quot; &quot; soldiers as &quot; &quot; highly decorated &quot; &quot; and experienced . &quot;
the Stab@@ sh@@ aup@@ t@@ mann had built the flight operation of the helicop@@ ter tiger in Fr@@ itz@@ lar and was one of the first six trained tiger pilots of his reg@@ iment .
&quot; Volker Bau@@ ers@@ ach@@ s , commander of the reg@@ iment to which the soldiers belong , said , &quot; If this crew couldn &apos;t turn away the crash , nobody would have liked . &quot;
doubts about the UN mission in Mali did not show the minister of the Le@@ yen : the use was dangerous .
&quot; but it is also of great importance &quot; for a country , from which we are only separated by two states , &quot; she said . &quot;
after the funer@@ al the s@@ coff@@ ers were brought out of the cathedral .
&quot; when and where they are buried , the German army did not provide any information . &quot;
Prince Hen@@ rik is not wanting a grave next to his wife
&quot; the man of the Danish queen Mar@@ gre@@ the ( 77 ) , Prince Hen@@ rik ( 83 ) , doesn &apos;t want to be buried next to his wife after his death . &quot;
that was the king &apos;s house on Thursday .
&quot; traditionally , the Danish royal couple will be buried in the Dom@@ kirche by Ros@@ kil@@ de . &quot;
the sculp@@ tor Bj@@ ør@@ n N@@ ør@@ ga@@ ard already made a sar@@ cop@@ h@@ ag@@ us for the two .
the Queen may be happy with her husband &apos;s decision .
where Prince Hen@@ rik is buried is still uncle@@ ar .
but he did not intend to be buried in his French homeland .
Prince Hen@@ rik has never made a secret that he was not happy with his title .
&quot; after the enth@@ ron@@ ement of his wife Mar@@ gre@@ the in 1972 , he would be fond of king . &quot;
&quot; in 2016 , he retired and also put the title &quot; pr@@ ism . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Hen@@ rik in Denmark did not get the title and the function he wanted , he did not see himself as equivalent to his wife - even not after death , explained L@@ ene Bal@@ le@@ by , chief spokes@@ person for the Danish royal house . &quot;
&quot; where the last resting place of the 83 @-@ year @-@ old will ultimately be , is still uncle@@ ar . &quot;
&quot; but he did not intend to be buried in his French homeland , but in Denmark . &quot;
he likes the country for which he has worked for the last 50 years .
&quot; the native Henri de Labor@@ de de Mon@@ pe@@ z@@ at , son of a French aristocr@@ acy , had met Mar@@ gre@@ the 1965 in London . &quot;
at the Th@@ ames he worked in the French emb@@ assy .
&quot; during his later wife , the sympath@@ ies of the people were always flown , Prince Hen@@ rik had a heavy stand in his almost 50 @-@ year @-@ old reign . &quot;
&quot; Hen@@ rik was vo@@ iced in an auto@@ biography about the first years in Denmark : &quot; a few months after my arrival , everything I did was cri@@ tici@@ zed . &quot;
&quot; my Danish was gay , I prefer wine instead of beer , silk stock@@ ings instead of kn@@ itting so@@ cks , Citro@@ ë@@ n instead of Volvo , tennis instead of football . &quot;
&quot; even for the Gau@@ lo@@ ises , which I smo@@ ked instead of Virginia tobacco , and who had the call to be the brand of socio @-@ critical intellectu@@ als , I could not hope . &quot;
I was different .
I seemed to be happy with this position and not to be ashamed .
these were two errors ! &quot;
Minister @-@ President Wei@@ l wants rapid re @-@ election
CD@@ U and F@@ DP in front of potential majority in Lower Saxony
&quot; at Nieder@@ sach@@ sens Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) , after the loss of the red @-@ green government majority for a swi@@ ft re @-@ election of the country , he does not want to res@@ ign . &quot;
because on Friday he spoke out for the resolution of the Parliament .
&quot; previously , the surprising exit of a Gre@@ ens Group in Lower Saxony had pl@@ ung@@ ed the government of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) into a serious crisis . &quot;
&quot; five months before the official appointment of the country election , the red @-@ green coalition in Hanover lost its short @-@ vote majority in parliament to the opposition from CD@@ U and F@@ DP . &quot;
the former Gre@@ ens El@@ ke T@@ jackets founded their step with the non @-@ nom@@ ination for election 2018 in their constitu@@ ency in Rot@@ enburg ( W@@ ü@@ m@@ me ) .
&quot; I see my political future in the CD@@ U , &quot; declared it in Hanover on Friday . &quot;
CD@@ U fac@@ tion@@ head Bj@@ örn Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler wants to recommend his group to record them .
&quot; with this , CD@@ U and F@@ DP had 69 seats in the Lower Saxony Land@@ tag , SPD and Green 68 seats . &quot;
&quot; so far , the relationship was revers@@ ed . &quot;
the new Land@@ tag will be elected regular on 14 January .
&quot; Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler said , the red @-@ green country government must now decide whether they could continue to go@@ vern in this situation without a majority . &quot;
&quot; however , Stephan Wei@@ l thinks it is essential that the country tag resol@@ ves its self @-@ resolution as quickly as possible . &quot;
the CD@@ U Group is expected to decide on its further action on Tuesday .
the State Constitution also sees the possibility that the Parliament &apos;s parliament is depri@@ ved of trust and cho@@ oses a successor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; our Constitution offers several options . &quot;
&quot; these options need to be checked in a legally clean manner , &quot; said Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler . &quot;
&quot; in peace , all the questions are discussed if they are legally insp@@ ected . &quot;
&quot; Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler called &quot; &quot; T@@ west@@ ens &apos;s step &quot; &quot; but a little curious . &quot;
the politi@@ cian himself stressed : &quot; I am not a tra@@ itor .
I feel very good . &quot;
she called himself as a Charm of Black @-@ Green .
the Gre@@ ens called for the dismis@@ sed de@@ pu@@ ties for the return of their land parliament .
&quot; we assume , of course , that they have received their land@@ tag@@ sm@@ and@@ at which they have received via the green country list , with immediate effect , &quot; &quot; said Meta Jan@@ ssen @-@ Ku@@ cz and Stefan Kör@@ ner . &quot;
&quot; the Group president of the Green Anja P@@ iel said : &quot; &quot; we regret the decision of El@@ ke T@@ ests extra@@ ordin@@ arily . &quot;
she decided not to lead a pr@@ on@@ unciation in the Group .
&quot; even in the background that there were no substantial differences , we cannot compreh@@ end this step . &quot;
SPD candidate Martin Schulz condem@@ ns the transfer of the Lower Saxony Gre@@ ens El@@ ke T@@ ests to the CD@@ U as a betra@@ yal .
&quot; the behaviour of the former Green Represent@@ atives in Lower Saxony is not only betra@@ yal of vot@@ ers , but also betra@@ yal of red @-@ green , &quot; wrote the Socialists and Democrats on Friday on Facebook . &quot;
he supported the decision by Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) to quickly re @-@ elect the Parliament .
the outlet T@@ west@@ ens costs red @-@ green in Lower Saxony the majority .
&quot; the politi@@ cian &quot; &quot; in her van@@ ished van@@ ity and in her fru@@ stration her personal interests before the welfare of the country &quot; &quot; cri@@ tici@@ zed SPD @-@ General Hu@@ ber@@ tus Heil . &quot;
it is a sc@@ andal that the CD@@ U in Lower Saxony makes this dirty in@@ tri@@ gen@@ ce and tries to beat out political capital .
Nieder@@ sach@@ sens CD@@ U fac@@ tion@@ head Bj@@ örn Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler wants to recommend his de@@ pu@@ ties to record El@@ ke T@@ ests to the CD@@ U .
&quot; the SPD leader in the Bundestag , Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , designed the v@@ ests to fal@@ si@@ fy the results of the 2013 country election with personal career gifts . &quot;
&quot; the CD@@ U was in front of the SPD &apos;s strongest force , SPD and Green in the parliament but a very thin majority of a vote . &quot;
&quot; Minister of Agriculture in the Interview - How do we protect ourselves from gyp@@ sum@@ ers , Mr. Schmidt ? &quot;
Germany disc@@ usses about contaminated eggs .
how could the sc@@ andal happen ?
how can consumers protect themselves ?
Minister of Agriculture Christian Schmidt ( CS@@ U ) is in an interview with the Editorial Board Germany ( R@@ ND ) .
Mr Schmidt : how can consumers protect consumers from po@@ is@@ oned eggs ?
I can only encourage all consumers to watch the eggs in your fridge and check the stamp print .
&quot; on the consumer protection portal www.@@ food@@ war@@ n@@ ung.de , the federal states provide the latest information on the eggs concerned . &quot;
affected eggs should be destroyed or returned .
even if according to all we currently know a health haz@@ ard is practically excluded .
now Al@@ di takes the best possible crisis reaction - all the eggs out of the offer - because the central role of the enligh@@ tenment by the Federal Minister of Economic Affairs is not really perceived ?
food monitoring is the task of the federal states .
&quot; nevertheless , my house has stopped immediately and has been notified of Germany in close exchange with the authorities of the countries . &quot;
all information and risk assessment are available to consumers .
trade has just as well the manufacturers to ensure that the sold products are traffic @-@ capable and health harmless .
&quot; if the resi@@ due in eggs is exceeded of 0,@@ 00@@ 5mg / kg , these are not accessible . &quot;
un@@ contaminated eggs can however be sold and consumed .
this time is not the fault of the factories .
do production companies and consumers sit in the same boat ?
&quot; according to the state of knowledge , the production companies don &apos;t meet any immediate fault . &quot;
&quot; rather , they have to reck@@ on due to the alleged illegal practices of service companies with economic damages . &quot;
&quot; as always , there is too little control in the case . &quot;
is it only lacking in the personnel or on the conc@@ lusive jurisdiction ?
there were just the official controls that have covered the process .
&quot; the truth , however , is that food fraud and criminal energy can never be excluded 100 percent . &quot;
&quot; this is precisely why a consistent explanation of such events and the transfer to the public prosec@@ ut@@ ors in cases where crimes can exist , are of crucial importance . &quot;
I have already made a lot of clear evidence that I expect a complete education from the responsible authorities .
is regular al@@ ar@@ mis@@ m really necessary in food sc@@ and@@ als ?
consumers and consumers have the right to obtain only safe and market@@ able food .
&quot; if a non @-@ approved insec@@ ti@@ cide is used in the food industry , consumers and consumers are rightly indig@@ nant . &quot;
&quot; through the f@@ ake medium , manufacturers , retailers and consumers are in a situation that is absolutely not necessary . &quot;
&quot; basically , it must be clear : the illegal use of the insec@@ ti@@ cide Fi@@ pr@@ on@@ il in the attitude of food@@ borne animals is not acceptable and must be terminated immediately . &quot;
it must be worked on all levels consistently and with high pressure .
&quot; I expect from all the competent authorities , that the atomic fact is spe@@ ech@@ less and un@@ broken . &quot;
how to impact the financial rules of football on N@@ ey@@ mar &apos;s move to Paris
the rules aimed at preventing un@@ imp@@ eded expendi@@ tures of European football clubs will not b@@ other N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s Wel@@ tre@@ k@@ ord transfer from the Spanish Barcelona to the French Paris @-@ Saint Ger@@ main .
&quot; any consequences will come for Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main of the UEF@@ A , as the leading organization that monitors the European game has the power to ban cre@@ ws from access to the prestigious Champions League tournament . &quot;
&quot; financial Fair Play rules launched in 2011 by the UEF@@ A , mean that PSG has to point out that the transfer from N@@ ey@@ mar was financed without major losses . &quot;
&quot; Barcelona has paid 222 million euros ( 262 million dollars ) to buy the Brazilian from its contract , and N@@ ey@@ mar will receive a sal@@ ary that will amount to several tens of millions of dollars a year . &quot;
here are some of the financial aspects of N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s moving to France .
&quot; PSG can certainly make the money loose , so that N@@ ey@@ mar is under@@ writing and bringing him into a galax@@ y of other stars , given the financing of the team by the rich ruling family of Qatar . &quot;
&quot; associations are allowed to spend a lot of money for the acquisition of players , but have to counter@@ act legitimate sources of income that allow them to break the break @-@ even point in their business @-@ related business . &quot;
FF@@ P was designed by Michel Plat@@ ini following his election to the UEF@@ A President in 2007 .
&quot; the former French player believed that clubs , who had enormous debt in their quest for success , che@@ ated effectively and ris@@ ked to ruin themselves when banks or owners with@@ drew their support . &quot;
&quot; in 2011 , FF@@ P moved from concentr@@ ating on the debts of clubs to monitor their losses . &quot;
&quot; the change meant that the business model , the Roman Abr@@ amo@@ vich originally bought in Chelsea in 2003 - bought a club with potential and then invested strongly in order to improve the crew and build a global brand - to become a harder matter . &quot;
&quot; during the current three @-@ year survey period , which runs until 2018 , clubs can accept losses of EUR 30 million . &quot;
&quot; and although Plat@@ ini has fallen from the pres@@ idency in Un@@ gn@@ ade in 2015 , his UEF@@ A successor Alek@@ s@@ ander C@@ efer@@ in continues to deter him from excessive spending . &quot;
&quot; surely , FF@@ P is not dead and we will rein@@ force the rules for the future , &quot; said Andrea Tra@@ ver@@ so , who is responsible for the UEF@@ A for FF@@ P , compared to The Associ@@ ated Press last week . &quot;
&quot; although the PSG has paid the buy @-@ out clause of N@@ ey@@ mar in a package , it can distribute the amount for invo@@ icing over the duration of its contract . &quot;
&quot; N@@ ey@@ mar has signed a five @-@ year contract , so that the liqui@@ dation can be exp@@ elled for the next five years in the amount of 44.@@ 4 million euros in the annual financial statements . &quot;
&quot; the first wave of FF@@ P sanctions in 2014 , the PSG together with Abu Dhabi , owned by Manchester City , has hit the he@@ avi@@ est sanctions . &quot;
&quot; the PSG got a fine of 60 million euros ( then 82 million dollars ) , which later reduced to 20 million euros - and it was arranged that the team members for the Champions League of the season 2014 / 15 will be limited to 21 players instead of the usual 25 players . &quot;
&quot; UEF@@ A is looking for clubs that could try to over@@ see their financial supervision by rel@@ ying their income through companies linked to the owners of a club . &quot;
&quot; while a cat@@ ar@@ ic company could sponsor the PSG , if the value of sponsor@@ ing should exceed the standard market sets , the UEF@@ A would not be considered legitimate in@@ comes . &quot;
exactly what happened in 2014 when the UEF@@ A decided that the value of the P@@ SA sponsor@@ ing was infl@@ ated by the Qatar Tourism Authority .
it was reported that a part of the PSG payments to N@@ ey@@ mar could come across payments from the Organiz@@ ing Committee of the World Cup 2022 in Qatar .
but PSG and Qatar 2022 disp@@ uted that N@@ ey@@ mar P@@ WM amb@@ ass@@ ad@@ ors will be held and a poor man@@ eu@@ ver for UEF@@ A regul@@ ators could be easily figur@@ ing out .
&quot; the previous sanctions against PSG signi@@ fy that the UEF@@ A will be more attentive , every attempt to respect the rules . &quot;
&quot; the UEF@@ A had no prepared conversations with PSG via N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s Transfer , said on Thursday the people familiar with the situation . &quot;
&quot; they spoke on the condition of anony@@ m@@ ity with The Associ@@ ated Press , since they were not authorized to discuss the PSG situation . &quot;
the latest published reports show that PSG 2015 / 16 generated a profit of more than 10 million euros with a turnover of EUR 54@@ 2.4 million .
the accounts for the last fiscal year must still be published .
&quot; PSG expects N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s to arrive a blessing for sponsor@@ ing deals , merchan@@ dis@@ ing and trim purchases . &quot;
the association assumes that sales will rise by at least 30 per cent after signing .
&quot; the Spanish League was clearly irrit@@ ated to see one of the best football players , and she tried to prevent N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s move by claim@@ ing that PSG would hurt the FF@@ P . &quot;
&quot; it is a clear case of &quot; financial dop@@ ing &quot; with the club and the state , &quot; said the president of La Liga , J@@ avier T@@ eb@@ as , the Spanish daily AS with regard to Qatar &apos;s last owner . &quot;
&quot; Arsen@@ al @-@ Manager Arsen@@ e Wen@@ ger , whose association is owned by an American sport ty@@ co@@ ons , shares the reservations of La Liga against a state that finan@@ ces a society . &quot;
&quot; it is the consequence of ownership and that has completely changed the entire landscape of football in the last 15 years , &quot; said Wen@@ ger on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; once a country has an association , everything is possible . &quot;
&quot; it is very difficult to respect the financi@@ al fair@@ play , because you can have different ways or have different interests if a country has such a great actor to represent a country . &quot;
Swiss is looking for a new g@@ og@@ gi@@ ver
&quot; over the past few years , Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y has made board chocolate for the Swiss . &quot;
&quot; now , the long @-@ term cooperation is in front of a possible end : the airline is writing down the order . &quot;
Swiss @-@ Spe@@ aker Mei@@ ke Fu@@ hl@@ red confirmed on request from the news agency s@@ da a corresponding report from the newspaper &quot; Nord@@ west@@ schweiz &quot; from Friday .
&quot; according to current planning , the airline will conclude a new contract in the first half of 2018 . &quot;
the products would be checked every two to three years and subjected to a quality control .
&quot; we are very happy with the current supplier Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y , &quot; &quot; said the spokes@@ person . &quot;
around 17 million small red @-@ white chocolate boards of 14 grams are distributed per year before landing to passengers .
Swiss didn &apos;t want to provide any information about the costs .
&quot; industry in@@ si@@ ders estimate the volume of order according to &quot; &quot; Nord@@ west@@ schweiz &quot; &quot; to 1.5 to 2 million Swiss francs - the Mig@@ ros subsidiary achieves an annual turnover of approximately one billion Swiss francs . &quot;
&quot; but more importantly , the advertising effect is more important : for a chocolate company it is a prestigious job . &quot;
&quot; as many applicants are in the new tender , Swiss does not want to betra@@ y . &quot;

&quot; according to the newspaper report , Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y wants to make an effort to ren@@ ew the Treaty on Spring 2018 . &quot;
&quot; for the s@@ da , the largest Swiss chocolate manufacturer was not reachable for an opinion . &quot;

nostal@@ gia goes into &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer &quot; and &quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; into the niche
&quot; this re@@ petition of history is at the same time nostal@@ gic because of the glorious days of the characters of the 80 @-@ s , for the 90 @-@ year @-@ Gr@@ unge era ( as the pione@@ ers David W@@ ain and Michael Show@@ alter the Sk@@ et@@ ch com@@ edy &quot; The State &quot; for M@@ TV ) , and for himself - that is , for 2001 , before their stars , like Elizabeth B@@ anks , A@@ my Po@@ eh@@ ler and Paul Ru@@ dd went to greater things . &quot;
as a cultural arti@@ fact it is equally a par@@ o@@ dy and a em@@ bodi@@ ment of our Facebook @-@ capable era of permanent memories .
&quot; but as fran@@ chise , it feels like the time would be scar@@ ce . &quot;
&quot; first Day of Camp &quot; worked surprisingly well , not only because of his absurd lob@@ ster ( it contained a original story for a speaking can of vegetables that was spoken by H. Jon Benjamin ) . &quot;
&quot; by sti@@ cking to the core of the g@@ ags - middle @-@ aged actors play awesome children who are grown up - nevertheless , they managed to win the last part of the W@@ itz@@ es back . &quot;
&quot; ten Years L@@ ater , &quot; with his adults who now play adults , is less emotion@@ ally rooted and his par@@ o@@ dy goes more to the Stal@@ ker films of the 90 @-@ s years like &quot; The Hand That Ro@@ cks the Cra@@ dle &quot; ( &quot; Die Hand that schau@@ k@@ elt the cra@@ dle &quot; ) . &quot;
&quot; at one point , there is a character through an Apple power@@ book , some inline sk@@ ates and a number of other things from 1991 . &quot;
many of the central stories are the same .
&quot; the gr@@ acious C@@ oop ( Mr. Show@@ alter ) , now roman@@ esque , has still not forgotten K@@ atie ( Mar@@ gu@@ er@@ ite Mor@@ eau ) . &quot;
Victor ( Ken Marino ) has still not lost its vir@@ g@@ inity .
and there is another crazy mal@@ ign@@ ant plot involving Ron@@ ald Re@@ ag@@ an ( also Mr. Show@@ alter ) who is now supported by George H. W. Bush ( a good read by Michael Ian Black ) .
&quot; as always , the ex@@ ams are the best part of the fran@@ chise . &quot;
&quot; it is especially fun to see the eternal young Mr. Ru@@ dd , the Matt D@@ ill@@ ons &apos;s sub@@ lip style of &quot; Sing@@ les , &quot; whose former Big @-@ Man @-@ on @-@ Camp Andy feels like an old cr@@ acker . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s the moments of acci@@ dental mad@@ ness that could heat this fran@@ chise like a sort of re@@ peti@@ tive &quot; Seven Up ! &quot; series until he achieved what I saw as his logical conclusion : &quot; &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer &quot; &quot; will show how they will visit the film premiere of &quot; &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; at Amazon is now remin@@ is@@ cent of another kind of nostal@@ gia : to re@@ vit@@ alize the Cold War from &quot; The Americans , &quot; to the movie &quot; Atom@@ ic Blon@@ de &quot; and even &quot; GLO@@ W &quot; with its East @-@ West w@@ rest@@ ling icon@@ ography . &quot;
&quot; the com@@ edy with R@@ hy@@ s Thomas created by Brian Gat@@ ew@@ ood and Aless@@ andro Tan@@ aka as a director : a Romanian drama of the eigh@@ ties with the two polic@@ emen as friends , two officers from Bucharest , who fight for truth , a@@ thei@@ sm and the way of Marxism @-@ Lenin@@ ism . &quot;
the main roles - a hard @-@ ges@@ ot@@ ten@@ er Gregor and an ide@@ alistic I@@ os@@ ef - are played by Flor@@ in Pier@@ sic J@@ r. and Corn@@ eli@@ u u@@ lic@@ i whose di@@ alogues are syn@@ ced by Ch@@ anning Tat@@ um ( also a detailed producer ) and Joseph Gordon Lev@@ itt in English .
it is an ingen@@ ious idea .
but it is not much more than an idea .
there are some nice g@@ ags to watch ( the police spend the time watching chess on television as Americans may do with football ) .
&quot; and the list of famous speakers - including J@@ enny S@@ late , Nick offer@@ man , Mah@@ er@@ sh@@ ala Ali and Ch@@ lo@@ ë Se@@ vi@@ gn@@ y - provides a decent play &apos; Find out the voice &apos; . &quot;
but &quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; is involved so much for the tru@@ th@@ fulness of a des@@ perate propaganda drama - a killer who carries a Re@@ ag@@ an Mask is involved - that it often plays like a single .
&quot; in six long epis@@ odes it moves , and the com@@ edy is not fast or frequent enough . &quot;
&quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective , who was edited on a smaller length , could better deliver his ag@@ it@@ pro@@ p sati@@ re , since Gregor and I@@ os@@ ef always visit the American emb@@ assy , whose lobby is always occupied by two thick men who swal@@ low a bunch of ham@@ bur@@ gers . &quot;
the message for the imag@@ inary communist audience is that Western culture can do everything to feed for a balance .
the fic@@ ti@@ tious Romanian cre@@ ators were not wrong : we even make it with our own younger history and with thei@@ rs .
hit against drug ma@@ fia in the country
the police succeeded in a blow against the Italian Maf@@ ia in Baden @-@ Württemberg .
&quot; on Wednesday morning in the Schwar@@ zwald @-@ Ba@@ ar district , in Rot@@ t@@ weil , Kon@@ stanz , Ess@@ lingen and Stuttgart , numerous objects were searched for , as the public prosec@@ utor Kon@@ stanz dealt in on Friday . &quot;
&quot; in this case , 15 people aged between 25 and 77 years were arrested and already issued arrest warran@@ ts against them . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the officials set up larger quantities of marijuana and co@@ ca@@ ine , fire@@ arms as well as several hundred thousand Euros . &quot;
two persons were arrested at the same time in Italy .
&quot; against the two susp@@ ects of Itali@@ ans , there were German arrest warran@@ ts . &quot;
the two are probably supplied to Germany .
Italian and Bavarian investig@@ ators were involved in the action .
more than 300 polic@@ emen were in use .
&quot; the members of the Maf@@ ia are accused of organised drug crimin@@ ality , serious violence , trial murder as well as rob@@ ber@@ y and ex@@ tor@@ tion . &quot;
&quot; since summer 2016 , the public prosec@@ utor &apos;s office det@@ ects Con@@ stance against organised drug traff@@ icking in the south German area . &quot;
between the prosec@@ ut@@ ors in Kon@@ stanz and Palermo there was a lively exchange and the investig@@ ators of the Kri@@ po Rot@@ t@@ weil had almost daily contact with their colleagues in Sicily .
&quot; therefore , the great use on Wednesday morning was also accompanied by four officials from Palermo . &quot;
&quot; at the sight of the investigations , Italian nation@@ als are mainly related to the Italian ma@@ fia . &quot;
&quot; a incident on May 27 in Hü@@ fingen , where several shots were fired up in a restaurant early in the morning , should go to the bank account . &quot;
lam@@ ent large gaps in the foreig@@ ner &apos;s register lam@@ ents
&quot; &quot; &quot; data from citizens who should not appear &quot; &quot; : according to a report the foreig@@ ner &apos;s register has significant short@@ com@@ ings in Germany . &quot;
this lead to some serious mis@@ decision in asylum procedures .
&quot; according to a media report , the Commissioner for Refu@@ gee Management of the Federal Government , Frank @-@ Jürgen Weise pointed out to large gaps in the country &apos;s central register . &quot;
&quot; defects in the data recorded there could lead to some serious mis@@ decision in case of asylum procedures and deport@@ ations , in an analysis carried out by the &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung . &quot; &quot;
&quot; according to estimates , 10 million people with foreign nation@@ alities are recorded in the Register , including some 5.7 million from non @-@ EU countries . &quot;
the data is therefore managed by approximately 600 foreign country authorities in Germany .
&quot; because the data were not sufficiently maintained , the data quality in parts has not been good until now . &quot;
&quot; in individual cases , data from 1921 have been found , &quot; of people who have long been no longer alive , or of citizens who have become German citizens and should actually no longer appear in the register . &quot;
&quot; fail@@ ing data inputs can slow down back processes considerably , &quot; says the report . &quot;
&quot; in the statistics of foreign @-@ paid people , EU citizens are surv@@ ey@@ ed that would not have to travel . &quot;
&quot; however , such false orders led to a distor@@ ted debate on how to deal with the refugees , &quot; it is therefore stated in the analysis . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , the Federal Government has apparently begun to send refugee families back to Italy with 16 @-@ year @-@ old children if they are there . &quot;
&quot; this will emerge from an internal paper of the Federal Office for Migration and Refu@@ ge@@ es ( BA@@ MF ) , reports the &quot; New O@@ sn@@ abr@@ ück newspaper . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in this paper , it is said that the BA@@ MF is conducting such procedures for families with children - with the exception of inf@@ ants and small children - to Italy since 1 June 2017 . &quot;
&quot; since the end of 2014 , this was practically no longer possible , so the newspaper was referring to the difficult situation on the spot . &quot;
&quot; after the Dublin agreement , it is responsible for refugees from the EU state to reach them first . &quot;
&quot; if a mig@@ rant travels to another EU country , the state can send it back to it . &quot;
&quot; in the meantime , the office is now writing : &quot; in the meantime , the capacity for families with minor children in Italy has increased substantially . &quot;
Italy has given guarantees for the inclusion and accommodation of families .
even the European Court of Human Rights ( EG@@ MR ) considers these commitments for sufficient .
other EU states would also send refugees back to the Dublin agreement .
&quot; the internal political spokes@@ person of the left faction in the Bundestag , Ull@@ a Jel@@ p@@ ke , critic@@ ised this decision : &quot; families with children thre@@ aten human rights un@@ lawful admission conditions and a threat to child welfare . &quot;
second best result achieved
&quot; a total of 220 litres of blood from in Ober@@ rei@@ chen@@ bach , the blood donation service has already been available for other people . &quot;
&quot; at least by the twelve citizens , who were awarded on Friday . &quot;
&quot; Jürgen Gre@@ ule , who has now donated 50 litres of blood with his 100 donations in the meantime . &quot;
&quot; traditionally , the church hon@@ ors the multiple readiness to don@@ ate blood at the meeting of the municipal council . &quot;
&quot; it is brilliant how our body is created for it and we appl@@ aud the don@@ ors of respect , who provide their blood for stran@@ gers , even more in@@ trin@@ si@@ cally un@@ sel@@ fish , &quot; under@@ lined mayor Karl@@ h@@ ein@@ z K@@ ist@@ ner . &quot;
&quot; a single blood donation helps several people , &quot; explained the head of the German Red Cross ( DR@@ K ) , Holger Mais@@ enb@@ acher , as the preser@@ ves are de@@ composed into their constitu@@ ents . &quot;
&quot; in this way , three people could benefit from a blood donation . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , corn makers reported of the actions carried out in the spring in Ober@@ rei@@ chen@@ bach . &quot;
&quot; this year we achieved the second best result with 114 don@@ ors , &quot; said the DR@@ K district manager . &quot;
&quot; obviously , the change in the theatre @-@ house has led to higher number of participants a few years ago . &quot;
&quot; before that Thomas Bo@@ ck@@ stadt , Susanne Reich@@ le , Sandra Schö@@ ck , Thomas Reich@@ le and Meta Um@@ beer were counted among the multiple @-@ giving and were awarded for 50 completed blood don@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; half as many flies Herbert M@@ air and Dorothe@@ e Ri@@ ex@@ inger , while Tamar@@ a Pf@@ rom@@ mer , Petra Schle@@ eh , Stefanie St@@ oll and Uwe V@@ etter appro@@ ve ten times each 500 milli@@ liter from her life saf@@ t . &quot;
Bank of England will keep interest rates at 0.25 %
&quot; the Bank of England will probably be announced later that interest rates will remain unchanged , after the weak economic growth and the weak@@ ening of inflation have damp@@ ened spec@@ ulation over a rise . &quot;
&quot; the Bank of England has warned that economic growth will remain &quot; &quot; lugg@@ ish &quot; &quot; when they retained interest rates on family income in the middle of an intensi@@ fying pressure . &quot;
&quot; the political decision @-@ makers of the Monetary Committee ( M@@ PC ) of the Bank voted with 6 to 2 to keep interest rates to 0.25 % , whereby fewer members asp@@ ire to increase as the weak economic growth has weak@@ ened the support for an up@@ li@@ ft@@ ment . &quot;
&quot; in its quar@@ terly inflation report , the Bank reduced its growth forecasts for 2017 to 1.7 % and 2018 to 1.6 % and warned that the pressure on the bud@@ get@@ ary income would continue , with inflation expected to rise to just under 3 % in the fall . &quot;
&quot; but they sign@@ alized that in the next few years interest increases would be necessary to bre@@ w the inflation of the Bre@@ x@@ it , and she said that l@@ ending costs would have to rise more than expected to the financial markets . &quot;
members also agreed to withdraw a part of the Mam@@ mut economic package that was issued a year after the Bre@@ x@@ it .
&quot; it will demand time for the financing plan to provide cheaper funding for banks from the coming February , although it is expected that they will now provide 15 billion pounds more within the framework of this system - with 115 billion pounds ster@@ ling . &quot;
&quot; minutes after the decision on the interest rate , the Bank said : &quot; in the central pro@@ g@@ nosis of the M@@ PC the gross domestic product ( GDP ) remains weak , as the pressure on the real income of households continues to be bur@@ dened . &quot;
&quot; at the rate of interest , they repeated that &quot; a certain tigh@@ tening of monetary policy &quot; would be necessary for the cooling of inflation and a &quot; greater &quot; scale than markets expect . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; however , the Bank emphas@@ ised that increases &quot; step @-@ by @-@ step &quot; and &quot; limited &quot; would take place . &quot;
forecasts to 2019 illustrate how the market is set to change .
it has retained its growth forecast to 1.8 % in 2018 .
the pound fell after these news from the dollar and the euro .
the pound fell by 0.5 % to 1.@@ 31 US dollars and fell by 0.4 % to 1.@@ 11 Euro .
the decision to no change occurs after the recent dis@@ ap@@ pointing growth figures have damp@@ ened the increasing expectations of an interest rate and the GDP in the second quarter increased from 0.2 % in the preceding three months to 0.3 % .
&quot; growth will likely be 0.3 % in the third quarter , although it will easily recover after the end of the year . &quot;
&quot; the recent inflation report provided little enthusiasm for households that will be affected by rising inflation and low @-@ level sal@@ aries , as the tigh@@ tening is first even worse before it becomes better . &quot;
&quot; she added that monetary policy in the coming years could not &quot; &quot; prevent the income of income &quot; , &quot; but she added that wages are clearly &quot; &quot; rec@@ u@@ perate &quot; &quot; at the end of its three @-@ year forecast . &quot;
&quot; the economy is also strengthened by increasing demand for British goods , which is attri@@ but@@ able to the weak pound , which is compens@@ ated by a portion of lower consumer spending . &quot;
the decision comes one year after lowering of interest rates to 0.25 % in the last August following the shock@@ ing EU vote which caused the loss of the stick .
the Bank estimates that it will probably take four years until this will reach the prices and the economy .
&quot; before the Bank &apos;s last judgment on interest rates , the reputation of interest rates was increased , as inflation increased pressure on hard @-@ pressed households , with three policy makers in July demanded rise to 0.5 % . &quot;
&quot; sorry , this entry is only available in Deutsch . &quot;
&quot; the Bank said that in proportion to its target of 2 % , the bank would be &quot; &quot; quite &quot; &quot; to the weak pound . &quot;
&quot; Andrew Mont@@ lake , Director of Cor@@ eco Mort@@ gage Bro@@ kers said : &quot; &quot; given the recent decline in s@@ wap rates , the mort@@ gage market is likely to be more competitive again since the len@@ ders would like to search for businesses and end the year in a positive way . &quot;
&quot; the market looks particularly well for those in which the existing deals are negoti@@ ated and the new mort@@ g@@ ages are closed , and many with toll @-@ free options and low rates are becoming more and more popular . &quot;
N@@ HS ( National Health Service ) is supposed to prescri@@ be 10.000 people controversial HIV drug
patients will receive access to a &quot; transform@@ ative &quot; HIV @-@ prevention treatment in September after a fight against the High Court against the financing of the drug in N@@ HS .
&quot; N@@ HS England announced that a pre@@ ex@@ posi@@ tional proph@@ yla@@ xis ( pre@@ p ) taken prior to intercourse , which can reduce the risk of infection in high @-@ risk patients by around 86 percent , is now supplied by the health service via a first three @-@ year study for estimated 10,000 people . &quot;
&quot; he agreed to finance the trial after the Appe@@ als Court confirmed a ruling by the Supreme Court of Justice last year , which the N@@ HS had the authority to pay for the pre@@ p despite the claim that the local authorities should finance it . &quot;
&quot; the Schach@@ zug announced on Thursday was welcomed by N@@ HS England boss Simon St@@ ev@@ ens as &quot; &quot; important new intervention &quot; , &quot; during the National Aids Trust ( NAT ) called this as a &quot; decisive moment . &quot; &quot;
&quot; sexual health clinics in London , Bri@@ gh@@ ton , Manchester , Liverpool and She@@ ff@@ ield will be among the first to follow the registration of people and other clinics will follow in October before it will be introduced throughout England in April 2018 . &quot;
pre@@ ex@@ posi@@ tional proph@@ yla@@ xis ( pre@@ p ) is a result of HIV supplements that are taken before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection .
studies have shown that pre@@ p significantly reduces HIV transmission in infections .
taking pre@@ p before sexual intercourse means that just enough medicines are present in the body of a person to prevent HIV infection .
such drugs can be taken every day or so already two hours before sexual intercourse .
&quot; those who are eligible for treatment belong gay or bis@@ exual men , trans@@ sexu@@ als and individuals with HIV @-@ positive partners who have not been successfully treated . &quot;
&quot; in hospitals , suitable participants identify the study , including men , women , trans@@ gen@@ ders and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not known as well known by anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment . &quot;
people who live in England and registered at a GP can also opt @-@ in for a possible participation in their local sex clinic .
the program becomes £ 10 million and N@@ HS England signed a contract to supply the drugs this week after an international competitive procurement .
&quot; the study aims to assess the full potential of pre@@ p by collecting clinical evidence , how it is used extensively and implemented in a large scale . &quot;
St@@ ev@@ ens said : &quot; this great new intervention should complement and over@@ take the far @-@ reaching and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV .
it is another milestone in the more than three decades of ongoing progress in cop@@ ing with one of the biggest health challenges of humanity . &quot;
&quot; Deb@@ or@@ ah Gold , Chief Executive at NAT ( National Aids Trust ) said : &quot; &quot; this is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV . &quot;
&quot; pre@@ p , if targeted on need@@ y and endangered people , offers the opportunity to change the English HIV epide@@ mic . &quot;
&quot; from September onwards , people with a high HIV risk will have access to this N@@ HS @-@ funded study in England to develop a new instrument which is really controlled individually and is not subject to a negoti@@ ation with a partner , leading to the improvement of many , many lives . &quot;
we warmly welcome this announcement . &quot;
&quot; Ian Green , CEO of the Terr@@ ence Hig@@ gins Trust , said : &quot; &quot; the priority must now be that the study is carried out quickly across the country and that no one who has a risk for HIV is left behind . &quot;
&quot; now , as the pre@@ p test medicine was provided , we are on the best way to protect over 10,000 HIV infected people . &quot;
&quot; Shar@@ on Hod@@ g@@ son , Sh@@ adows Health Minister said : &quot; &quot; the beginning of the pre@@ p process is welcome and over@@ due after months of delay and hes@@ it@@ ating . &quot;
the evidence shows how transform@@ ative this drug can be as part of our approach to HIV prevention and can end the transmission of this life @-@ changing infection .
this attempt brings us a step closer to understanding the benefits of pre@@ p .
&quot; now it is important that this study is carried out as soon as possible throughout the country to protect people who are infected with HIV , and that they will contribute to the termination of the prolifer@@ ation of HIV in society . &quot;
living : me@@ zz@@ anine and clever designer tricks have transformed this small Ear@@ ls Court apartment into a spacious home
&quot; Jo@@ anne L@@ eig@@ h , a former ban@@ ker with a passion for real estate , res@@ ized in 2014 from a large house in K@@ nigh@@ ts@@ bridge to a Ear@@ ls Court Apartment . &quot;
it is on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne Terrace - and it &apos;s a proof of the new design that Jo@@ anne has not packed and sold their bags .
&quot; before that I lived with my ex in K@@ nigh@@ ts@@ bridge in a much larger space , &quot; &quot; says Jo@@ anne . &quot;
I looked for something comparable to my price .
I was shown this apartment in Ear@@ ls Court and she had the same high ceilings .
I fell in love with her and made an offer this day . &quot;
&quot; since the first visit the 1,000 square feet have been completely over@@ hau@@ led . &quot;
originally a one @-@ room estate with a ne@@ sted layout - one had to go through the kitchen to get into the bedroom - wanted to add Jo@@ anne storage room and a me@@ zz@@ anine to optimally use the generous ceiling height .
&quot; I wanted high ceilings , large windows , lots of light . &quot;
&quot; that was my requirement , &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; for this purpose , she assigned the architect and design studio Du@@ ck &amp; Sh@@ ed by Er@@ fan Az@@ adi from Not@@ ting Hill , who had 12.5 feet high ceilings and to create a home that was not only a development but also a place to live for Jo@@ anne . &quot;
&quot; the ceiling was not large enough to place two rooms over@@ thrown , so the architectural challenge was to create a me@@ zz@@ anine where one could stand . &quot;
Er@@ fan had to think cre@@ atively to solve the announcement .
&quot; the ste@@ el@@ work is quite complicated , &quot; he explains . &quot;
we had to arrange the rooms in such a way that they were st@@ acked by one another without hes@@ itation .
&quot; it was not only about building a simple platform , but to put the steel so that it had the right height for the function above or below . &quot;
this arrangement enabled Er@@ fan to place two rooms at full height - with lots of additional drama .
&quot; for the me@@ zz@@ anine , a classic copper light window of Ret@@ rou@@ vi@@ us looks down over the gl@@ amor@@ ous living area . &quot;
&quot; mir@@ r@@ ored gold furniture , silver acc@@ ents and vintage Ser@@ ge Mou@@ ille lighting set the style for the program . &quot;
&quot; the use of mirrors plays a role in adding theater , space and light . &quot;
at both ends a short cor@@ ridor is mir@@ r@@ ored to allow it to work longer .
&quot; in the kitchen , the mir@@ r@@ oring feels like a window into another room . &quot;
at the entrance there are mir@@ r@@ ored units for all the bri@@ efs and glasses of Jo@@ anne .
&quot; through the perception of a gl@@ amor@@ ous room , the beauty of the living room can close the kitchen if it is not used . &quot;
fol@@ dable kitchens are nothing new .
the special thing about this is that it is a garage door .
&quot; a bit of engineering went inside , &quot; explains Er@@ fan from the steel reinforced , vene@@ ered MDF door . &quot;
&quot; it is opposite , so that when you slide the door , very easily slide . &quot;
&quot; thanks to the clever use of space and storage space , Jo@@ anne could gain additional 16 m ² , an additional bedroom and improved layout . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the day you will sell the base area - or how your property is appreciated , &quot; says Er@@ fan . &quot;
&quot; in a ru@@ di@@ mentary form , a real estate agent will enter and calculate a calculation based on soil size . &quot;
&quot; here , they managed to enlarge the floor surface and at the same time use high @-@ quality materials that give the room its luxurious advantage . &quot;
&quot; the materials are the things that you touch and that therefore help create an emotional bond in a home , &quot; says Er@@ fan . &quot;
&quot; you do not love the electrical outlets in the walls .
&quot; these are important , but they do not play with your heart . &quot;
it shows that an apartment can transform itself through a good design and increased square meter number of slightly standard in something very astonishing .
&quot; in fact , such as Jo@@ anne , you could decide not to leave them . &quot;
brothers fight for a $ 500 million real estate @-@ empire
&quot; two brothers are four decades after their Italian family founded the dy@@ nasty , in an examination of one of the biggest real estate @-@ imperial Vict@@ ori@@ as worth more than $ 500 million . &quot;
&quot; the former director of the &apos; Carl@@ ton @-@ Football @-@ Club &apos; and developer Col@@ in De Lu@@ tis is living in a villa in To@@ or@@ ak , only three doors from his younger brother Paul . he brought him to the Supreme Court to clarify how their property and their assets are to be divided . &quot;
&quot; Paul wanted to withdraw from family business since 2014 , but a sharp debate on the separation takes place at the Supreme Court of Justice . &quot;
&quot; together with her mother Anna , the brothers have accumulated 38 real est@@ ates worth more than half a billion dollars , since the 1973 family bought a shop in Smith Street , Coll@@ ing@@ wood . &quot;
&quot; there , the West@@ co family founded jeans and grew up to a chain of 160 retail stores . &quot;
it was sold to 85 million US dollars in 1999 .
&quot; this money was invested in real estate , and the De Lu@@ tis portfolio now includes offices in the city center , the development areas of Br@@ uns@@ wick and Sor@@ ren@@ to , the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Bul@@ ler as well as shopping m@@ alls in the subur@@ b . &quot;
&quot; according to an agreement with her dec@@ eased father , Col@@ in - by Paul as &quot; main operator and the dominant personality &quot; described in the De Lu@@ tis family - about two thirds of corporate assets and Paul , about one third . &quot;
a court file states that this means that Col@@ in owns property worth $ 316 million and Paul in the value of 176 million dollars .
the division of real estate and cash has proved to be an issue for Paul .
&quot; the ass@@ essments proposed by Col@@ in have left him with what I thought for the best objects , &quot; he wrote in 2015 in a first aff@@ id@@ av@@ it . &quot;
&quot; last Friday , the first hearing of the Supreme Court took place after several failed plac@@ ements . &quot;
&quot; the brothers now also fight for control over the existing business - of which Col@@ in , as Paul claims , have ruled him . &quot;
&quot; Col@@ in argu@@ ed , this is not true , but thro@@ ws Paul to manage some pos@@ sessions in@@ competent . &quot;
&quot; in an early aff@@ id@@ av@@ it submitted by Col@@ in , he says he hoped to settle the dispute . &quot;
&quot; my Italian inheritance dict@@ ates that the family is the most important priority , &quot; he wrote . &quot;
&quot; the costs increase in the event , with hundreds of pages with Aff@@ id@@ av@@ its , e @-@ mails and reports from companies , including Del@@ o@@ itte , Pit@@ cher Partners and Charter K@@ eck Cr@@ amer , and with leading lawyers , among them Allan M@@ yers , Q@@ C , and from both parties held law firms . &quot;
Mrs. De Lu@@ tis and her late husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who run milk bars and delicacies from the late 1950 &apos;s and bought a shop in Br@@ uns@@ wick in the early se@@ ven@@ ties .
&quot; they used the security to buy the Coll@@ ing@@ wood property , in which Col@@ in opened the first Je@@ ans@@ unloading of the family . &quot;
&quot; Col@@ in says he began West@@ co there when he was &quot; &quot; in my last years of High School , when Paul was still a little child ( about 10 years old ) . &quot;
&quot; Anna De Lu@@ tis says that she and Luigi , who died in 2012 , hoped to pass their property to her sons . &quot;
&quot; Luigi often said to me that he never wanted the brothers to land in court , &quot; she wrote . &quot;
&quot; two other brothers , Mark and Luke , are no longer part of De Lu@@ tis group , where Col@@ in claims that Mark was paid 10 million dollars and Luke 26 million dollars when leaving the company . &quot;
&quot; both Luke and Mark were , so Paul says &quot; about the conditions of their financial separation . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Col@@ in was very restra@@ ined , although he was a former AF@@ L Executive Board and after a biography of the year 2015 by Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ire , the best friend of television stars . &quot;
Fair@@ fax Media contacted Col@@ in and Paul De Lu@@ tis and their lawyers .
&quot; only Col@@ in answered by SMS to say &quot; &quot; I really can &apos;t say much &quot; , &quot; because the case is before the courts . &quot;
&quot; it is very sad that my brother Paul decided to su@@ e me and draw our sur@@ name through the courts , &quot; he wrote . &quot;
&quot; in mid @-@ 2016 , Col@@ in wrote in writing to the court that he tried to meet the demands of his brother . &quot;
&quot; our father would not have wanted Paul and I would end up in our current dispute , &quot; he said , and added that he was still hoping for a solution . &quot;
on Friday this hope seemed to be over .
&quot; our affair will be solved by the courts in the near future , &quot; Col@@ in wrote . &quot;
tru@@ mp of new Chief of Staff plans to limit the media ab@@ st@@ in@@ ence of the President .
others have tried and failed .
maybe John F. Kelly can actually do it .
&quot; if so , he will be the first . &quot;
POL@@ IT@@ ICO reports that the new Chief of Staff of the White House plans to restrict the flow of information to President Tru@@ mp - including news media reports - hoping to keep the boss on a more ev@@ enly course .
here is a piece by repor@@ ter Jos@@ h D@@ aw@@ sey :
&quot; when John F. Kelly , the new Chief of Staff of the White House , met his first working day with conduc@@ tive employees , he presented a major problem in President Donald Tru@@ mps White House he wanted to repair : bad information entered into the hands of the President . &quot;
Kelly said the employees that information about him should flow - whether on paper or in brief@@ ings - because the president would make better decisions if he would receive good information .
&quot; Kell@@ ys diagnosis makes sense , but others have tried to t@@ ame Tru@@ mp by monitoring its media control . &quot;
&quot; President Tru@@ mps &apos;s relationship to television reaches decades back - and now , where he is in the White House , his TV advertisement is still strong . &quot;
&quot; when Can@@ did@@ ate Tru@@ mp was anno@@ yed because of un@@ fair reporting , it was productive to show him that he received a fair coverage of jobs that were too convincing , &quot; said the former election campaign Sam N@@ un@@ berg in February towards Poli@@ tico . &quot;
&quot; Poli@@ ti@@ cos Tara pal@@ mer@@ i wrote at the time that &quot; the key to keep the Twitter habit under control , according to six former election campaign officials , is to ensure that his personal media consumption involves a steady praise . &quot;
okay .
&quot; but the idea that Tru@@ mps &apos;s Twitter habit has ever &quot; &quot; under control &quot; &quot; is ridi@@ cul@@ ous . &quot;
perhaps these camp@@ uses know something we don &apos;t know others - that Tru@@ mps Twe@@ ets without their interventions have already contained more spark .
we will probably never learn something about the twe@@ ets that Tru@@ mp hasn &apos;t sent .
&quot; if his staff were able to keep it away from him several times , then their efforts have been worthwhile . &quot;
but nobody has consistently prevented it from causing Tru@@ mp contro@@ vers@@ y .
&quot; part of the problem is that people in a White House that are composed of competing parties , always try to present their own agenda by presenting Tru@@ mp material that may promote their views from the world . &quot;
POL@@ IT@@ ICO - very busy with this story - reported in May about the preference of advis@@ ors to provide the President for strategic reasons without dou@@ bt@@ ful information .
this was an example described by Repor@@ ter Sh@@ ane Gold@@ macher :
&quot; current and former Tru@@ mp officials say that Tru@@ mp can react like a volcano on negative press cuts , especially those with damaged le@@ aks , and that he tries to find out where these come from . &quot;
&quot; this happened at the end of February , when someone asked the president to be a printed copy of an article by Got@@ New@@ s.com , the website of the Internet Prov@@ oc@@ ate@@ urs Charles C. Johnson , who accused the dep@@ uty chief of staff K@@ atie Wal@@ sh to be &quot; the source behind a pile of le@@ aks &quot; in the White House . &quot;
&quot; although Johnson was permanently banned from Twitter because of Sch@@ ik@@ anen , or that he offered no concrete evidence , or that he had made false accus@@ ations in the past and re@@ vo@@ ke them . &quot;
Tru@@ mp read the article and began asking employees about Wal@@ sh .
&quot; Gold@@ maker added that the former Chief of Staff Rein@@ ce Pri@@ eb@@ us and General Secretary of the White House , Rob Porter , tried to implement a system to manage and document the paper@@ work and document the Tru@@ mp . &quot;
how did that work ?
Kelly tries to do the same three months later .
&quot; perhaps he will prove to be more effective manager than Pri@@ eb@@ us , but Tru@@ mp is still his impul@@ sive self , and his coun@@ sel@@ ors are still striving for influence . &quot;
these un@@ changing factors make Kell@@ ys &apos;s mission very difficult .
most searched crimin@@ als get post from Euro@@ pol
&quot; since the address is unknown , the help of the population will be wor@@ shipped and hoped . &quot;
police across Europe send post@@ cards to dangerous crimin@@ als during this summer ( virtual ) post@@ cards .
&quot; as the addresses of the sought @-@ after heavy crimin@@ als are not known naturally , references from the population will be hoped and asked . &quot;
&quot; Euro@@ pol reported on Friday from the action , which follows the &quot; &quot; EU Most W@@ an@@ ted &quot; &quot; Advent calendar from winter . &quot;
&quot; the experience would have shown that many volati@@ le of holiday destinations hide , it was called Euro@@ pol . &quot;
there are 21 post@@ cards for selected crimin@@ als from 21 EU countries .
&quot; since 2016 , the website www.@@ e@@ um@@ ost@@ wanted has been viewed more than 2.5 million times . &quot;
36 of online sal@@ ads could have been arrested at least eleven of them due to evidence after publication on the website .
travelers negotiate a dit@@ ch and return to the &apos; Milli@@ on@@ aires &apos; series
&quot; some of the weal@@ thi@@ est land@@ lords of the West Mid@@ lands are back with some more determined trav@@ eller on the base of war , which have tra@@ ded a dit@@ ch drawn from the church to rec@@ laim a field in front of their man@@ sions . &quot;
travellers have par@@ ked their 20 car@@ av@@ ans in a field outside a wealthy street of Soli@@ h@@ ull that is called the &quot; Milli@@ on@@ aire series . &quot;
&quot; they brought horses , babies and an army of v@@ ans after they were thrown out in May without being deter@@ red by a dit@@ ch excav@@ ated by the Council to prevent their accidents . &quot;
the tac@@ t@@ ful group found a gap in the defense units and pressed their vehicles through a passage that remained un@@ hin@@ dered to find a way .
&quot; angry residents have pushed the Council of Soli@@ h@@ ull , who said it was &quot; useless to deal with the problem . &quot; &quot;
&quot; an anonymous ten@@ ant said : &quot; &quot; they were drag@@ ged there on Monday evening after they were sent from Bentley He@@ ath , where they threw stones onto the pass@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; the Council must act in action by shame , as it was useless when dealing with the problem . &quot;
&quot; the travellers were there in May , were moved and are now back . &quot;
&quot; more came yesterday evening , probably today more . &quot;
&quot; she added : &quot; &quot; the Council of Birmingham knows how to deal with it by keeping long instruction to protect their parks . &quot;
I live on Stre@@ ets@@ brook Road and I &apos;m not happy to continue to pay my municipal tax if the Council cannot stop it .
&quot; a resident who didn &apos;t want to be called , said : &quot; &quot; it &apos;s ridi@@ cul@@ ous , we have just seen the last round of these travelers just to be pl@@ under@@ ed by another lap . &quot;
the numbers have increased this time and you even saw a horse in the park area . &quot;
&quot; a spokes@@ woman of the Council of Soli@@ h@@ ull said : &quot; &quot; we are aware of an un@@ authorised camp on the land beyond the Stre@@ ets@@ brook Road and work with the police of Soli@@ h@@ ul@@ ls . we take the necessary legal steps so that they move on as quickly as possible . &quot;
&quot; to support our collection of evidence , it is very important that as many residents as possible notify a anti @-@ social or criminal behavior in the police by calling 101 . &quot;
this helps to create a picture of the situation where the court must examine when we submit our case .
from Birk@@ enhof to the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise
from the former Hotel Birk@@ enhof the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise becomes .
the house in front of the gates of Freuden@@ stadt is currently being renovated and will be re @-@ opened on 1 March next year .
these are good news for the city .
&quot; because with the closure of the Hotel Birk@@ enhof due to the dam@@ aging Ambiente operating company mbH on 13 April 2014 , some 30 000 nights per year were lost and also revenue from the tourist tax . &quot;
&quot; in the fall of 2014 , in view of dramatic rising numbers of refugees coming into the district , the hotel building offered the council office as a collective accommodation , which ensured controversial discussions . &quot;
the city prevented the lodging of asylum seek@@ ers by setting up a building plan to secure the area as a hotel location .
the decision was not un@@ disp@@ uted at that time in the municipal council .
&quot; however , above all Freuden@@ stadt &apos;s mayor Julian O@@ ss@@ wald def@@ ended the hotel location and already spoke of serious interested parties at the house . &quot;
he should keep right .
&quot; the group of Lu@@ is@@ enh@@ otels with Managing Director Birgit Sch@@ erer , based in Bad Berg@@ z@@ ab@@ ern , has acquired the former Hotel Birk@@ enhof at a voluntary auction in Berlin and wants to make it a house of the three @-@ star Plus category under the name Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise . &quot;
the group has four houses with the Freuden@@ stadt object .
two of them in Bad Berg@@ z@@ ab@@ ern and one in Bad Herren@@ al@@ b .
&quot; hot Hotel Lu@@ ise , Lu@@ is@@ en@@ park , Park@@ hotel Lu@@ ise and now Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise . &quot;
&quot; at the earlier hotel Birk@@ enhof are already standing in front of the entrance , and when you enter the house , it becomes clear that extensive renovation works will be made . &quot;
&quot; the floors were torn out , ceilings were disman@@ tled , old bath@@ tu@@ bs removed from the rooms . &quot;
the entire hotel building is a single construction site .
there is still much to do until March .
&quot; it is actually a nice place , &quot; says Thomas Sch@@ erer in conversation with our newspaper . &quot;
everything is to be renewed in the Black Forest style .
&quot; the rooms are equipped with large walk @-@ in showers , the entrance area will be re@@ designed , new windows will be installed . &quot;
&quot; everything should be &quot; &quot; pretty bourgeois &quot; &quot; later , as Thomas Sch@@ erer expresses . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we want to make a piece of jewelry out . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; swimming pool , wellness area and conference room are part of the equipment . &quot;
&quot; they don &apos;t want to position themselves at the high level of the hotels in Lau@@ ter@@ bad , but already on a high @-@ level downtown level , Sch@@ erer empha@@ sizes . &quot;
&quot; the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise , with its approximately 60 rooms , wants to grow wide , explains Sch@@ erer further . &quot;
&quot; both individual vac@@ ation@@ ers , groups or business@@ men should feel comfortable in the hotel . &quot;
&quot; he has already conducted talks with O@@ B Julian O@@ ss@@ wald and tourism director Michael Kr@@ ause , so Sch@@ erer . &quot;
the idea of the city coinci@@ de with those of the hotel group .
&quot; we are on the same line . &quot;
&quot; according to the level of investment , Thomas Sch@@ erer doesn &apos;t want to define exactly . &quot;
&quot; just under a million euros , he counts . &quot;
&quot; also the external systems are brought forward to the front man , which is already clearly visible . &quot;
&quot; in a courtyard , a large terrace is created , which will be accessible from the restaurant , which is open to public . &quot;
Thomas Sch@@ erer is optim@@ istic : &quot; Freuden@@ stadt is a good market . &quot;
Russia affair : us Special Inves@@ tig@@ ator sets Grand Jury
&quot; in the Russia affair around US President Donald Tru@@ mp , special medi@@ ator Robert Mu@@ eller is supposed to have used a so @-@ called Grand Jury after a report . &quot;
&quot; over the past few weeks , the Board accepted the work , wrote the &quot; Wall Street Journal &quot; calling on the matter of familiar people . &quot;
the paper evalu@@ ates the step as a sign that Mu@@ eller has expanded and intensi@@ fied its investigations .
&quot; the CN@@ N reported , there are already preliminary charges of the Gre@@ mi@@ um in connection with a meeting between Tru@@ mps of the oldest son and a Russian attorney . &quot;
U.S. intelligence services acc@@ use the Kre@@ m@@ lin for a long time to deliberately interv@@ ene in the 2016 presidential campaign .
Mu@@ eller examines whether there were agreements between Tru@@ mp &apos;s elec@@ toral campaign team and Moscow .
the focus of the investigations shall be several men who acted as advis@@ ers of the Republi@@ cans in the election campaign .
&quot; according to reports , Mu@@ eller also took more and more Tru@@ mps priv@@ ates and business environments under the micro@@ scope . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; &quot; Washington Post &quot; &quot; wrote a few weeks ago that the Sonder@@ er Tru@@ mp personally picked up Tru@@ mp personally and investigate the repro@@ ach if the President could not hin@@ der the judi@@ ci@@ ary in the course of the affair . &quot;
the main task of Grand Jury is to examine the present evidence in possible crime cases and decide whether it is to be charged .
Grand Jur@@ ys are therefore also called the counts of the indictment .
&quot; in most cases , they are turned on when it comes to larger and controversial cases . &quot;
the procedure is always carried out behind closed doors .
the committee can also be turned on by the public prosec@@ utor to charge people for hearing under o@@ ath .
&quot; according to the radio station CN@@ N , pre @-@ inv@@ itations were issued which revol@@ ve around the encounter between Donald Tru@@ mp J@@ r. and a Russian attorney . &quot;
people who were involved in the meeting were asked for a statement called it in the report .
&quot; in addition , they should provide documents . &quot;
&quot; in addition to Tru@@ mp J@@ r. , Tru@@ mps were advis@@ ers and son @-@ in @-@ law Jar@@ ed K@@ us@@ h@@ ner as well as his former election campaign Paul Man@@ a@@ fort during the interview . &quot;
&quot; legal experts said on Thursday evening in US television that the entry indicates that Mu@@ eller would not be inti@@ mid@@ ated in his work , and that he should act quickly in his work . &quot;
&quot; however , it does not necessarily mean that the Grand Jury will be turned on at the end to decide on the collection of an indictment . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , the establishment of the committee is the beginning of a new phase in the investigations and a new reason for concern for President Tru@@ mp . &quot;
&quot; in the midst of the new revel@@ ations , the President made a speech in West Virginia to present the Russia affair as a campaign of his political opponents . &quot;
&quot; the Russia story is a total invention , &quot; &quot; said Tru@@ mp . &quot;
&quot; the topic gives the democr@@ ats a way to feel good , because they have nothing else to talk about . &quot;
his special advisor T@@ y Cob@@ b explained in an opinion that he didn &apos;t know anything about setting up a Grand Jury .
&quot; but this work usually works in secret , he stressed . &quot;
the White House for@@ bi@@ ds any measures which accelerated the work of the special agent on a &quot; fair &quot; way .
the former F@@ BI chief James Com@@ ey stated three times that not against the president .
&quot; one has no reason to assume that something changed , it was called on in the explanation . &quot;
but Mu@@ eller was only used after Tru@@ mp Com@@ ey fired .
&quot; because of this r@@ aus@@ age , accus@@ ations against Tru@@ mp had become no@@ isy , he wanted to hin@@ der the judi@@ ci@@ ary . &quot;
&quot; Com@@ ey said in June in front of a Senate Committee , Tru@@ mp asked him to recru@@ it the investigations against the national security advisor Michael Fl@@ yn@@ n . &quot;
the President stands under great pressure because of the investigation .
&quot; according to the representation of US media , the White House gathered material against the special agent and its employees . &quot;
the dissolved spec@@ ulation about whether Tru@@ mp Mu@@ eller wants to release .
&quot; unlike an independent investig@@ ator of the Congress , such as in the Wat@@ erg@@ ate affair around the later res@@ igned president Richard Ni@@ x@@ on , Mu@@ eller has a position in which he could theore@@ tically be tax@@ ed by the President of the Ministry of Justice . &quot;
several sen@@ ators of both parties want to prevent such a step .
&quot; two groups of republi@@ can and democratic sen@@ ators put laws on Thursday , after which the special medi@@ ator could no longer be dismis@@ sed . &quot;
Ant@@ arc@@ tica : giant ic@@ eberg drives in the Ant@@ arc@@ tica
&quot; in the Western Ant@@ arc@@ tic , a gigantic ic@@ eberg has been replaced by the barely seven @-@ fold size of Berlin . &quot;
this was announced by the Bre@@ mer@@ ha@@ ven@@ er Alfred @-@ Weg@@ ener @-@ Institute for Polar and Marine Research on Wednesday .
&quot; the big Kol@@ oss is driving over a tril@@ lion ton and 5@@ 800 square kilometers , and will probably need two , three years until it was mel@@ ted . &quot;
&quot; with 175 kilometres of length and a width of up to 50 kilometres , it is one of the biggest ice @-@ gi@@ ants who have registered in the past three decades . &quot;
there is no danger for people from him .
&quot; to what extent climate change has played a role in breaking the ic@@ eberg , is uncle@@ ar according to research data . &quot;
&quot; in total , however , there has been a series of unusual break@@ through@@ s in the region for about 30 years , writes the US research center for snow and ice ( N@@ SI@@ DC ) in a fact background . &quot;
&quot; according to many researchers , this could be related to global warming . &quot;
the now broken col@@ os@@ sus was a part of the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s .
Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s flo@@ ats on the sea and is fed by large gl@@ aci@@ ers .
it continues to grow into the sea and breaks regularly .
Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s is located south of South America almost at the head of the Ant@@ arc@@ tic Peninsula .
&quot; North of this pe@@ eling , the balance of w@@ axes and breaking @-@ off was disturbed several years ago . &quot;
&quot; a complete sh@@ aper is broken down there , writes A@@ WI @-@ researcher Daniela Jan@@ sen . &quot;
&quot; there is a lot to do that also the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s is in danger , as the front edge has never been with@@ drawn as far as it is . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the iron plate stands under tension and can be broken down , if at a key point a piece is broken . &quot;
the melting of Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s and Eis@@ berg does not increase sea level as they float on the water and water as much water as it yields after melting itself .
&quot; however , the loss of the shell@@ fish leads to the fact that the gl@@ aci@@ ers can flow directly into the sea and flow much faster than before . &quot;
&quot; this could possibly increase sea level , but only in low dimensions , the British research project writes to the observation of Ant@@ arc@@ tica ( Mi@@ das ) . &quot;
&quot; according to A@@ WI statements , the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s is the fourth largest sh@@ el@@ ker of Ant@@ arc@@ tica with nearly 50 000 square kilometres . &quot;
&quot; at the transition from the mainland , it is up to 700 meters thick , at the front edge to the free ocean about 200 meters . &quot;
there it breaks regularly .
&quot; although it is a natural event and no direct connection to climate change is aware of us , the ice sign comes into a dangerous position , &quot; said Martin O &apos;@@ Lear@@ y from the British S@@ wan@@ sea University . &quot;
&quot; this is the longest withdrawal since the beginning of the records , &quot; he also confirmed . &quot;
&quot; among scientists it is controversial whether the Lar@@ sen @-@ C Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s will continue to grow again or long @-@ term , and possibly collap@@ sed , his colleague Adrian Luck@@ man said : &quot; our models say that it will be less stable . &quot;
but this development will last decades .
&quot; even though these researchers are unable to decline this gigantic ic@@ eberg on climate change , many ice @-@ cho@@ vi@@ es of the Ant@@ arc@@ tic Peninsula have fallen apart over the past few decades . &quot;
this long finish of the Ant@@ arc@@ tic stretches in the direction of South America .
&quot; according to data from the research program British Ant@@ arc@@ tic Survey , the ice surface of the Ant@@ arc@@ tic Peninsula has decreased by 28 000 square kilometres since the 1950s . &quot;
&quot; as a result , the increase in temperature increased . &quot;
&quot; over the last 50 years , the Ant@@ arc@@ tic Peninsula war@@ med around three degrees and thus count towards the areas in which the temperature is fastest . &quot;
CD@@ U wants to protect Hau@@ st@@ ari@@ f in personnel
&quot; because it becomes increasingly difficult to occupy vac@@ ant positions , the CD@@ U , from the employers &apos; association , ur@@ ges to become more attractive . &quot;
&quot; only shortly before the summer break , 41 new places in the administration have been forced through the administration . &quot;
more than 1100 employees and officials work for the district administration in M@@ ett@@ mann .
&quot; now , 17 appren@@ tices left their first working day . &quot;
the apprentic@@ es@@ hips in the circle are obviously very cov@@ eted .
around 620 applications were recorded for the places that were given this year .
&quot; nevertheless , the circle still l@@ acks staff to cope with the increased requirements and tasks . &quot;
&quot; at present , there are still 50 not occupied places at the M@@ ett@@ mann district . &quot;
&quot; among other things , doctors and engineers as well as forces of general administration are sought . &quot;
the CD@@ U wants to take the initiative together with the F@@ DP and the U@@ WG and oppose the short@@ age of skilled workers in the administration .
&quot; according to the wish of the parties , the administration will develop a concept for recru@@ iting personnel and personnel development . &quot;
&quot; the aim is to not only cover short @-@ term requirements for skilled workers , but to counter@@ act forward @-@ looking scar@@ city short@@ ages , it is said . &quot;
&quot; the overall concept should be oriented towards the inside and the outside , showing concrete measures for cross star@@ ters and involve an education offensive , demand CD@@ U , F@@ DP and U@@ WG . &quot;
this sounds like a good approach .
because the circle has to do with personnel problems that you did not know earlier .
other cities promote good officials and employees and offer more attractive conditions .
&quot; the speech is of a real &quot; &quot; competition for public employers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; in addition , a high number of employees , the disease or age caused by the service , comes from the service . &quot;
so the highest time for action so that no more places remain un@@ occupied .
&quot; but Klaus @-@ Dieter &apos;s people , leader of the CD@@ U , goes beyond the common application with his party . &quot;
&quot; he recently caused a f@@ aust@@ fic@@ ate surprise when he publicly ques@@ tioned human resources , and the remaining parties were aston@@ ished . &quot;
people want all possibilities to be reviewed which allow a withdrawal from the local employers &apos; association .
&quot; if we do not come to a satis@@ factory solution here , the county administration should strive with the trade unions - perhaps also in cooperation with the county @-@ affiliated towns - a Hau@@ st@@ ari@@ f , &quot; so people . &quot;
&quot; in this way , the CD@@ U , the employees and officials tried to pay better than it actually fores@@ ees the tari@@ ff for the public service . &quot;
&quot; the sal@@ aries are currently prescribed precisely , increases or more money is only when one changes to a higher level that is oriented towards professional years . &quot;
but the tasks of the circle have grown more and more over the past few years .
&quot; only a few weeks ago , new rooms had to be set up in which employees take care of the provisions of the new constitutional protection law . &quot;
&quot; last but not least by the rising number of asylum seek@@ ers , Land@@ rat Thomas Hend@@ ele and Kreis@@ direktor Martin Richter have a problem : they have too little staff . &quot;
Italy sharp@@ ens the tone to NGO Mig@@ rants rescue boats
&quot; Italy has warned NGOs that use lif@@ ebo@@ ats for migrants in the Mediterranean , warned that they cannot continue this unless they comply with new rules for their operations . &quot;
&quot; if NGOs do not sign a new code of conduct , it is difficult to see how they can continue to work , &quot; said Minister of Minister Marco Minn@@ iti in an interview with the Turin daily La St@@ amp@@ a . &quot;
&quot; Min@@ ni@@ tis warning came a day after the Italian authorities had conf@@ isc@@ ated a boat of the German relief organisation &apos; Youth R@@ ettet &apos; , because their team worked effectively with human traff@@ ick@@ ers in a way that facilit@@ ated illegal immigration . &quot;
&quot; the aid organisation , which has only been in operation for a year , refused to express itself to detailed alleg@@ ations of the Italian Prosec@@ utor Amb@@ ro@@ gio Carto@@ sio . &quot;
&quot; for us , the salvation of human life remains our top priority . so we are sorry that at the moment we cannot operate in the search and rescue zone , &quot; the organization said in a statement on social media . &quot;
&quot; we can only judge all accus@@ ations which are currently being raised , after we have collected all the information and assess the situation . &quot;
&quot; the Italian authorities had watched the boat from &apos; Youth R@@ ettet &apos; , the I@@ u@@ v@@ enta , since October . &quot;
&quot; it is assumed that his crew takes infl@@ atable migrants on board , which can be delivered directly from traff@@ ick@@ ers , and that the sm@@ ug@@ gl@@ ers can go down so that the ships can be used again . &quot;
&quot; at least one meeting was suppos@@ edly found only 1.3 miles off the Liby@@ an coast , according to the Act of the Prosec@@ utor , whose contents were published by Italian media . &quot;
&quot; the occupation is suspected of over@@ coming over the authority of the Italian coast guard , the rescue operations in the zone for humanitarian reasons and not from any other motives . &quot;
&quot; under the Code of Con@@ duct , boats like the I@@ u@@ v@@ enta must have an Italian police officer on board who super@@ vis@@ es their activities . &quot;
&quot; only three of the nine NGOs who are involved in search and rescue operations have so far been prepared to ad@@ here to the code : save the Children , Mo@@ as from Malta and Pro @-@ Activ@@ a Open Ar@@ ms from Spain . &quot;
&quot; the latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be considered unnecessary , but acceptable as they would not bring any &quot; substantial changes or disabilities &quot; of their rescue operations . &quot;
&quot; among those who refuse to sign , the Nobel Prize W@@ inner organization Doc@@ tors Without Bor@@ ders ( MS@@ F ) . &quot;
&quot; in the meantime , Minn@@ iti now said that the number of migrants who arrived in Italy after the rescue measures had decreased dramatically in recent weeks , suggest@@ ing that the efforts to strengthen the Liby@@ an coastal bal@@ ances and cooperation with local may@@ ors have borne fruit . &quot;
&quot; in the last days we have begun to see light at the end of the tunnel , &quot; &quot; said the minister . &quot;
&quot; he announced plans for further talks with Liby@@ an citizens in this month on economic development initiatives and with C@@ had , Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants entering these countries hoping to reach Europe . &quot;

&quot; nine Wei@@ ler@@ mer Bi@@ ker , the &quot; Berliner Aussen@@ posten &quot; and two host@@ esses met in Wach@@ enheim in the Nord@@ pf@@ alz region for four days to enjoy Tri@@ als and S@@ ights . &quot;

the accommodation in the Wach@@ en@@ heimer Tal proved to be a good starting point for the tours .
the Burg@@ und@@ y and W@@ einf@@ est of Wach@@ enheim was a welcome bonus .
the first tour led to hot summer temperatures along the vineyards to Micha@@ el@@ skap@@ elle above Dei@@ des@@ heim .
&quot; there were view@@ points , partly on towers , from which one could look far above the Pf@@ äl@@ zer Forest and the up@@ stream pl@@ ains . &quot;
&quot; in between , there were always leng@@ thy asc@@ ents , for which long tri@@ als were rewarded . &quot;
&quot; on the second day , after Bad Dür@@ k@@ heim , we went to Sal@@ ine and to the Volks@@ fest Wur@@ st@@ markt . &quot;

&quot; in future , the Sport Stars will sit in front of computer con@@ soles , instead of fighting through the wind and weather over the stadium ras@@ c@@ als ? &quot;
&quot; fact : e @-@ sports has long since become a serious business , a lu@@ cr@@ ative business has become a lu@@ cr@@ ative business - big stars , millions of fans and huge tournaments with high g@@ ages . &quot;
these have also recognized the first lig@@ aments which are increasingly involved in this field .
&quot; the beginning of 2015 was the V@@ f@@ L Wolfs@@ burg , later the FC Schal@@ ke 04 and last the V@@ f@@ B Stuttgart , who founded an e @-@ sports department in mid @-@ July and took two professionals for the computer game FIFA 17 under contract . &quot;
&quot; we hope to inspire new young audiences for the V@@ f@@ B , &quot; says CEO Jochen R@@ ött@@ ger@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; he is sure , &quot; that a number of associations still climb on this train . &quot;
&quot; next weekend , FIFA World Cup organis@@ es the first &quot; &quot; Interactive Club World Cup &quot; &quot; in London where the gam@@ ers compete against each other . &quot;
&quot; in addition to Schal@@ ke and Wolfs@@ burg , for example , Manchester City , Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main or PS@@ V Eind@@ hoven qualified for example . &quot;
Robin Dut@@ t also sees great potential in e @-@ sports .
the ex @-@ trainer of Bayer Le@@ verk@@ usen and Wer@@ der Bremen now advis@@ es an agency for virtual football players .
&quot; the real football has to deal with the 14 @-@ 30 @-@ year @-@ old , that young people will still go into the stadium in the future , &quot; says the 52 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;
&quot; and : the clubs tried to conquer all sorts of markets , especially the Asian ones . &quot;
&quot; with prominent e @-@ sports@@ men under contract , one could be more often present on these markets online more often than to send the Bundes@@ liga to Asia once a year . &quot;
what is it all about ?
&quot; in the e @-@ sport computer games such as &quot; League Of Legends , &quot; &quot; &quot; D@@ ota 2 , &quot; &quot; Co@@ unter@@ strike &quot; or even soccer simul@@ ations FIFA are on competition level . &quot;
&quot; long ago , as in normal sports , Li@@ gen has become established in which the professionals compete against each other . &quot;
e @-@ Sport is already part of the official program at the 2022 events .
but is it a kind of sport at all ?
&quot; for many , the idea is certainly most need@@ y . &quot;
Ingo F@@ rob@@ ffer has also dealt with the question for a long time .
&quot; for Professor at the German Sports acade@@ my in Cologne , e @-@ sports is a sport because it is competitive and showing many biological and physical responses that can be found in classic sports such as increased heart rate , stress reactions , hormon@@ al changes . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it needs cognitive abilities , a technical and tac@@ tical understanding and a fast response ability . &quot;
&quot; professional gam@@ ers should not only exercise on the console , but also exercise their body and pay attention to the diet . &quot;
&quot; the f@@ itt@@ y player is a good player . &quot;
&quot; but F@@ rob@@ ing also sees problems : &quot; &quot; dop@@ ing is becoming more and more a topic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; controls may be difficult for online games , and in the scene the structures of classic sports were missing . &quot;
the scientists emphas@@ ise the high integr@@ ative effect of e @-@ sports .
&quot; players are on the road internationally , this is like a big global family , there are no cross @-@ cultural barriers . &quot;
a study conducted by the Advisory Service Del@@ o@@ itte and the Federal Association Inter@@ aktive Program@@ mer Software ( BI@@ U ) predic@@ ts rapid growth ahead of e @-@ sports .
&quot; in 2016 , 50 million euros were implemented in Germany , mainly on advertising , sponsor@@ ship and big tournaments . &quot;
&quot; in three years , sales should be 130 million . &quot;
&quot; against the almost 2.4 billion euros of the football league , this is little . &quot;
&quot; however , the e @-@ sport is no longer far from the other established sports such as hand@@ ball , basketball or ice hock@@ ey , &quot; the Del@@ o@@ itte consultant writes . &quot;
international are many countries already .
&quot; big markets are Asia and the USA , where ex @-@ basketball players Sha@@ qu@@ ille O &apos;@@ Ne@@ al and Bas@@ eb@@ all@@ star Alex Rodri@@ gu@@ ez are participating in the US team N@@ RG e@@ Sports . &quot;
Hollywood actors Ash@@ ton Kut@@ cher inv@@ ests in the e @-@ sports competition Uni@@ ver@@ n .
&quot; in Europe , too , there is a lot of things . &quot;
&quot; in a Norwegian school , e @-@ sports has been introduced as a classroom , says F@@ ung@@ sten . &quot;
&quot; in the Netherlands and France , the soccer league clubs are obliged to set up an e @-@ sports department according to Dut@@ t . &quot;
&quot; in the European comparison , Germany lag@@ s behind , &quot; explains V@@ f@@ B @-@ Management R@@ ött@@ ger@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; just to fall into nostal@@ gia , and to clarify the old times , it is no longer enough today . &quot;
&quot; it is a matter of preserving the tradition of the association , but at the same time to align the company on the modern market . &quot;
&quot; we live in a digi@@ ti@@ sed world , &quot; &quot; says Dut@@ t . &quot;
&quot; you cannot keep in mind that only in football everything remains , as it always was . &quot;

Michelle Carter for the lyrics to push the Con@@ rad Roy to su@@ icide
a woman from Massachusetts was sentenced to two and a half years because she encouraged her friend through texts and calls to su@@ icide .
&quot; Michelle Carter , now 20 , will spend 15 months of her conviction behind bars and five years were suspended . &quot;
Carter was sentenced to death in June because of neg@@ ligent killing of Con@@ rad Roy who took his life on 13 July 2014 .
the father of Roy said on Thursday at the hearing : &quot; my family is un@@ comfor@@ ting .
my son was my best friend . &quot;
Carter was allowed to stay free until his vocation .
&quot; she had been confronted with a maximum penalty of 20 years , but her legal representatives argu@@ ed that both she and Mr Roy suffered from a mental illness . &quot;
&quot; dressed in red pants and a cream coloured bl@@ ouse , Carter stood there with tears in the eyes , with folded hands and down@@ ward eyes when she was convic@@ ted . &quot;
&quot; her actions have killed Con@@ rad Roy , &quot; &quot; said the prosec@@ utor . &quot;
she finished his life to make her own better .
&quot; she has no responsibility , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; she has not shown any re@@ mor@@ se . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; but Car@@ ters attorney said it was a &quot; &quot; terrible circum@@ stance , which they really regret . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; judge Lawrence Mon@@ iz said , however , he did not find out that their &quot; age or maturity &quot; or even their mental illness have a significant impact on their actions . &quot;
a prosec@@ utor read a statement by Ro@@ ys &apos;s mother Lyn@@ n Roy who said that &quot; there is no day on which I do not pray the loss of my beloved son .
&quot; I want him to be proud of me and how I surround myself with everything . I try , despite all my pain , which we will carry for eternity with us , to be there for his sisters , &quot; it says . &quot;
&quot; Ro@@ ys &apos;s sister , Cam@@ dy@@ n Roy , said that she was &quot; &quot; persec@@ uted by the realization &quot; &quot; that she would never be part of the wedding of her brother or be a aunt for his children . &quot;
&quot; no longer this single person , having been together since my birth every day , is a pain that I will keep with myself for the rest of my life , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; the case seems to place a legal preced@@ ent because there is no law in Massachusetts , which makes it a crime to ask another to commit su@@ icide . &quot;
Carter was 17 years old when Roy found dead from a carbon mon@@ oxide poison@@ ing in a vehicle in 2014 .
&quot; the case attracted national attention , after Car@@ ters revealed text announcements that she encouraged him to end his life . &quot;
&quot; hang on , spring from a building , stab yourself , I don &apos;t know there are many ways , &quot; &quot; she said in several news that she had sent in the two weeks before his death , while he was on vacation with his family . &quot;
&quot; in the eyes before his su@@ icide she wrote : &quot; you must do it , Con@@ rad &quot; and &quot; All you need to do is to turn off the generator and you will be free and happy . &quot;
&quot; Ju@@ dge Mon@@ iz said that Carter paid attention to Roy &apos;s death , and ordered that she should benefit from the case through any press . &quot;
the case has divided the legal opinion .
&quot; one of the few who def@@ ended Carter was Am@@ anda Kno@@ x , who was convic@@ ted in 2007 because of the murder of her British ro@@ ommate in Italy before being acqu@@ itted two years ago . &quot;
&quot; Ms. Kno@@ x , 30 years old , published a comment in the Los Angeles Times : &quot; Michelle Carter deserves compassion and help , not j@@ ail . &quot;
Joshua Kim@@ mich : learning from the new Mini @-@ Lah@@ m of FC Bayern
that Joshua Kim@@ me was allowed to run as captain during the Audi Cup is no coinci@@ dence .
the FC Bayern aut t@@ aut a big season to the Con@@ fed Cup winner - extra motivation does not harm .
&quot; what was different in his place in the cabin , that Joshua Kim@@ me saw immediately , even if the additional garment was very small . &quot;
&quot; but as far and wide on the second day of Audi C@@ ups , of course no Philipp Lah@@ m and no Manuel Neu@@ er had to be seen , he made his own bar@@ k halt to his arm . &quot;
&quot; the trainer has not announced it , &quot; said the Con@@ fed Cup winner after his first use as Bavaria captain . &quot;
&quot; good , the entry could have been better than at 0 : 2 against the SS@@ C Naples . &quot;
but the sign of the coach Kim@@ me also could interpret .
&quot; not the eight year older Ar@@ tur@@ o Vi@@ dal was chosen as a game leader in the C @-@ El@@ f pro@@ s made from youth players , debut and straight out of the holiday . &quot;
&quot; it is best to distribute sugar@@ s to those , to whom one wants to breed a lot , which one wants to keep in mood . &quot;
those who were chosen to compete for the legacy of Lah@@ m can only use a little extra motivation .
&quot; Kim@@ me confirmed : &quot; &quot; that &apos;s what you want as a player : take responsibility . &quot;
on Wednesday the 22 @-@ year @-@ old fl@@ atten@@ ed as a mini @-@ l@@ ame over the field .
&quot; right back , this is now its position , the white bar@@ k at the arm did the rest . &quot;
and at all Kim@@ me worked in this start @-@ up like the one who can best take the helm in his hand .
&quot; he gave instructions , tried to steer the innocent tro@@ upe . &quot;
he had the view of the whole while many others were occupied with himself .
&quot; Vi@@ dal thus to re@@ play his missing fitness ( fol@@ dable hardly ) ; Ren@@ ato San@@ ches with it , on the devil come out to join the achievements of the Asia journey ( fol@@ ks also only condition@@ ally ) ; and Sebastian Ru@@ dy and Ni@@ kl@@ as Sü@@ le have no negative impact in their first appearance in Bavaria @-@ Tri@@ k@@ ot . &quot;
&quot; after all , it worked quite well . &quot;
&quot; addic@@ ted to Kim@@ me , Ru@@ dy before the defense , both acted confi@@ dently . &quot;
&quot; the well @-@ known Nap@@ oli storm was often difficult , and Sü@@ le tried a few times in the game building . &quot;
although his colleague Ru@@ dy admitted that the result was not as we hoped for .
but he also showed a proper performance at the debut .
&quot; shift , tempo change : &quot; for this style I was also fet@@ ched . &quot;
&quot; as un@@ acc@@ u@@ stom@@ ed to this Bavarian world still for the new entran@@ ces , one saw in the connection to the game . &quot;
&quot; for example , Ru@@ dy was not one or two in the cat@@ ac@@ om@@ bs , but surely six or seven interviews . &quot;
Kim@@ me said good@@ bye to a few cris@@ p statements on the back of his new fellow players .
&quot; there he heard an interesting sentence from Sü@@ le : &quot; &quot; what is going on here I already noted . &quot;
&quot; with Bavaria , you simply have to win every game . &quot;
&quot; after all , he does not have to teach the new one more . &quot;
Al@@ aba motiv@@ ates Ö@@ FB @-@ Damen
David Al@@ aba believes in the success of our Ö@@ FB
Austria &apos;s most well @-@ known foot@@ b@@ aller has just announced in front of the game about Twitter and the Ö@@ FB @-@ ladies wish all the best .
the Bavarian Leg@@ ion@@ ary is a quasi club @-@ mate of Ö@@ FB captain Schn@@ ader@@ beck and fi@@ eb@@ ert with our lad@@ ys .
the twe@@ et of the Austrian football player of the year and Champions League winners should be a special motivation .
the famous Bavaria @-@ Dus@@ el might also need our ladies well .
company satisfied with Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate Minister : economy lo@@ bt Wis@@ sings speed
&quot; it was often irre@@ conc@@ il@@ able , the relationship between the country and the regional economy , when E@@ vel@@ ine Lem@@ ke ( Green ) still was an economic minister of Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate . &quot;
this is reflected more than a year in which the new business minister Volker Wis@@ sing ( F@@ DP ) is in office .
chambers and companies from the region speak on T V request from a change in economic policy - and at the same time the old ministers .
&quot; Frank nat@@ us , Chairman of the Association of Tri@@ erer Enterprises ( V@@ TU ) , says : &quot; Wis@@ sing attacks the wishes of the economy , which Lem@@ ke all has blocked . &quot;
the biggest revers@@ al of the revers@@ al sees nat@@ us in infrastructure policy : the brid@@ ging of the motorway 1 between Kel@@ berg and A@@ den@@ au is now at the top of the priority list of the country .
&quot; this year , the Ministry is hoping for a planning process until 2021 is supposed to be the right . &quot;
&quot; a role in the plans of the country also plays the West@@ um@@ geh@@ ung Trier , which is in the urgent need of the Bundes@@ wehr plan . &quot;
&quot; the goal is to put the line in operation in December 2020 , says Minist@@ erial Director Cornelia Hol@@ t@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; nat@@ us sees it a sign to support regional , but internationally competitive companies . &quot;
&quot; the Chamber of Industry and Commerce ( I@@ HK ) Trier , like Wis@@ sing , asp@@ ires to increase sales in supermarkets and to stop the trend of German wine exports for ten years . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Wis@@ sing has an open ear for people who want to establish their own company , praise the Chamber of Commerce . &quot;
&quot; the Handwerk@@ sk@@ ammer Trier sees an additional incen@@ tive for young appren@@ tices in the new master @-@ bonus , says managing director Matthias Schwal@@ bach . &quot;
&quot; there is a premi@@ ums of 1000 Euro for the completed master exam and 2500 euros , if graduates are independent within ten years after the master &apos;s training . &quot;
the home@@ work list for the country stays long .
&quot; the planned road construction is quick to create facts , at the same time it is out of the country the necessary personnel , says Jan Glock@@ auer , chief executive of the Chamber of Commerce of Trier . &quot;
&quot; of 56 new engineers who want to employ the Wis@@ sing in the state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ art mobility , only 29 places have been occupied . &quot;
the Chamber of Commerce calls for more orders to be awarded to external offices .
&quot; CD@@ U fraction Christian Bald@@ auf added to the calculations of the Court of Audi@@ tors , the country in 2017 and 2018 more than 20 million euros less than suggested in the preservation of country roads . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Frank nat@@ us also expects a concept of the country to resolve the short@@ age of skilled workers in the region . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , the former broad@@ band expansion in the country is more serious . &quot;
&quot; in 2016 , regional companies had rated power supply in an I@@ HK survey only with the grade 3,4 . &quot;
they compl@@ ained about stagn@@ ant internet connections and out@@ breaks .
ex @-@ economic minister E@@ vel@@ ine Lem@@ ke is currently out of politics and is still sitting in the supervisory board of the wind power company Pro Wind .
&quot; the Gre@@ ens Group left Lem@@ ke in April to become the President of a private university in Karlsruhe , where after four months of dis@@ agreement they had already cleared the field . &quot;
Audi should change 8@@ 50.000 diesel vehicles - car manufacturers face a counter reaction
&quot; one day before the announcement of Audi , BMW said that it would be able to update the software in more than 350,000 vehicles . &quot;
&quot; the President said that &quot; &quot; there are more intelligent options than driving restrictions , &quot; &quot; and thus moved to European cities - including Munich , where BMW is based - to ban or restrict diesel vehicles . &quot;
Daimler announced on Tuesday that there will be three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions .
none of the companies described the under@@ tak@@ ings as recall .
European car manufacturers have strongly encouraged the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support compliance with rules for carbon dioxide emissions .
&quot; but nitrogen ox@@ ides , which em@@ it@@ ate diesel engines , are regarded as car@@ cin@@ o@@ gens and can cause as@@ thma . &quot;
&quot; the cost of the car manufacturers to install equipment to neutr@@ alise the exhaust gases delivered by diesel vehicles , also take on what makes it difficult to keep the price of the cars competitive . &quot;
German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also accused of viol@@ ating the powerful car companies and to ignore signs of the problem .
&quot; the companies are trying to avoid the faults of Volkswagen , which could regulate the use of so @-@ called de@@ preci@@ ation equipment that could regulate emissions in order to comply with the regulations when a car was tested , but in case of normal driving conditions . &quot;
&quot; in the United States several employees were indic@@ ted by Volkswagen , others are examined on both sides of the Atlantic . &quot;
&quot; last month , the former head of Ther@@ mod@@ y@@ nam@@ ics was arrested in the engine development of Audi in Germany . &quot;
&quot; the former manager , Z@@ ac@@ ch@@ eo Giovanni P@@ am@@ io , is Itali@@ ans and is therefore not protected from delivery and could be brought to court in the United States . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of this year , Audi was involved in German criminal investigations against Volkswagen , after the authorities accused Audi to have installed a system to b@@ ypass the emissions regulations in Europe , and a request that was focused on the United States has been expanded . &quot;
the inclusion of Audi into the investigation could weigh Volkswagen hard : the luxury car manufacturer contributes greatly to the benefit of Volkswagen .
this message has the raft on Saturday at the Is@@ ar
the city wants to protect the Is@@ ar .
&quot; so that the Is@@ ar visitors also participate , a raft rides through Munich on the mor@@ row Saturday , which has a special message . &quot;
&quot; when it comes to the Is@@ ar on Saturday , it will see a big raft there between F@@ lau@@ cher and Rei@@ chen@@ bach@@ bridge . &quot;
&quot; and that is not a normal raft , with Is@@ ar tourists . &quot;
but the building refer@@ at wants to elu@@ ci@@ date .
on the raft one sees a large inf@@ ot@@ ran@@ ular space .
it shows a g@@ arb@@ age hill .
the pr@@ el@@ ude to a publi@@ city campaign to appeal to the Is@@ ar visitors .
with the motto &quot; True Love ... &quot; the understanding of the Is@@ ar is meant to shar@@ pen a protective game of wild animals .
&quot; last summer the raft over the Is@@ ar and also this year , there are other actions and measures to achieve a consider@@ ate and environmentally conscious behavior . &quot;
Mor@@ dil@@ los Kn@@ oll@@ enn@@ asen and the laughter against the suffering
&quot; Mor@@ di@@ ll@@ o was at times one of the most published carto@@ on characters , the characters of his characters are his trademark . &quot;
&quot; even with 85 , the Argent@@ ine@@ an is still working on a film . &quot;
&quot; his message : laughter , &quot; &quot; for there is too much suffering in the world . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Guill@@ ermo Mor@@ di@@ ll@@ o was born on 4 August 1932 as the son of Spanish immigrants in Buenos Aires .
&quot; in the first years as an artist , he presented himself as a drawing for congrat@@ ulation cards - what fru@@ str@@ ated him . &quot;
&quot; the happ@@ i@@ est day in my professional life was the day when I lost my job , &quot; he once said . &quot;
&quot; after stops in Lima , New York and Paris reached the end of the 1960s the breakthrough : with the release of his carto@@ ons in &quot; Paris Match , &quot; and then also in the &quot; star &quot; and other leading magazines around the world . &quot;
even in China Mor@@ di@@ ll@@ o found many fans .
&quot; again and again , the artist was inspired by cities . &quot;
&quot; large , round Mor@@ di@@ ll@@ o figures tum@@ ble in drawings with the Le@@ aning Tower of Pisa , Big Ben in London and the Red Square in Moscow . &quot;
&quot; in the early morning , according to his own specification , he still sits at the drawing table , working every day for almost ten hours . &quot;
&quot; with cal@@ end@@ ars , puzzles , books for young and old , t @-@ shirts , pl@@ ush favorites and watches , its dro@@ l@@ ly figures continue to spread worldwide . &quot;
he has been working on a carto@@ on film and a TV series for six years .
the main person in the film &quot; Cra@@ zy Island &quot; is a gi@@ ra@@ ffe - Mor@@ dil@@ los favorite animal in his drawings - that has a thous@@ and@@ ler as a counter@@ part .
&quot; for the first time , his figures are in the 3D movie , which should come to the cinema screen in 2019 . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t know exactly what they say , it &apos;s strange for me , &quot; says Mor@@ di@@ ll@@ o . &quot;
the script is not written by him .
&quot; that &apos;s why he rather relies on the TV series , which , like his original drawings , is wor@@ dless . &quot;
Lav@@ ender threatened with climate change from Provence
&quot; he has become a symbol of Provence in the South of France , but there is a warning that it is threatened by climate change . &quot;
&quot; the lav@@ ender is dec@@ lining because of the conditions that are remin@@ is@@ cent of dro@@ ught conditions and because of diseases , which scientists and farmers trying to find solutions , great head@@ aches are prepared . &quot;
&quot; Eric Cha@@ isse , expert at the Agricultural Research Institute , CRI@@ EP@@ P@@ AM in Provence , said : &quot; &quot; the lav@@ ender in Provence has been effectively endangered because the plant has been exposed to climate change over the past few years , which in spring has brought much less rain and much more in the autumn . &quot;
this has effects on the life span of lav@@ ender .
&quot; there is also a small c@@ ic@@ ade , a micro @-@ bacter@@ ium that transm@@ its d@@ warf zi@@ pper , and with very dry weather there are many of them . &quot;
and there is much in the game .
lav@@ ender oil is not only relaxed for holiday@@ makers ; it is also very popular for perf@@ ume and cosmetics .
&quot; Eric Cha@@ isse said : &quot; instead of having very long plant tubes with a large number of flowers , we have smaller , under@@ developed and either missing or weak@@ ened . &quot;
so we have fewer parts with essential oil . &quot;
&quot; the solutions that are taken into account include a better water distribution and slow@@ ing of the ev@@ ap@@ oration of the soil , but also the spra@@ ying of plants with a protective mixture of clay and water and the development of varieties that are more resistant to dr@@ y@@ ness . &quot;
the town of Gei@@ sa in the Thuring@@ ian R@@ hö@@ n celebrates its 1200 anniversary .

the assass@@ ination of a journalist empha@@ sizes the growing threat in Mexico
&quot; the staff of the weekly Ri@@ odo@@ ce normally meet on Wedn@@ es@@ days to check their plans for reporting on the recent chaos in the state of Sin@@ alo@@ a , through organised crime , corrupt officials and inc@@ ess@@ ant drug wars . &quot;
&quot; but on that day , in the shadow of their own tragedy , they came together to talk about security . &quot;
they told them that it is important to change their routines .
&quot; two high @-@ level journalists will discuss what feels more secure : they are supposed to take their children into the office , which were in 2009 the goal of an attack with gr@@ en@@ ades , or leave them at home . &quot;
&quot; security experts have written three words on a tablet at the front of the room : opponents , neutr@@ als , allies . &quot;
&quot; you ask the Repor@@ ter to propose names for each column - no evidence is needed , percep@@ tions and gut feelings . &quot;
&quot; there are drug sm@@ ug@@ gl@@ ers , politicians , business@@ men , journalists who are suspected of standing on the pay@@ list of the government or cart@@ els , a catalogue of crimin@@ als which make the chaos of Mexico dangerous . &quot;
&quot; there is no break from violence , and while in the whole country there are more journalists : at least 25 , since President En@@ ri@@ que P@@ ena N@@ ie@@ to took office in December 2012 , and until now there have been at least seven deaths in seven countries . &quot;
&quot; among the latter is her editor and her inspiration from Ri@@ odo@@ ce , co @-@ founder J@@ avier Val@@ dez Car@@ den@@ as . &quot;
&quot; the greatest mistake is to live in Mexico and be a journalist , &quot; Val@@ dez wrote in one of his numerous books on violence in connection with drugs . &quot;
&quot; two repor@@ ters in the thir@@ ties , Aaron I@@ bar@@ ra and Miriam Ram@@ i@@ rez , carry t @-@ shirts , which show his sm@@ iling face with glasses or his typical pan@@ am@@ ah@@ ut . &quot;
&quot; the workshop takes place less than two months after his death , and the repor@@ ters discuss their shared themes , trau@@ ma , their night@@ mar@@ es , sle@@ e@@ pl@@ ess@@ ness , par@@ ano@@ ia . &quot;
&quot; although a Son@@ der At@@ tor@@ ney was established in 2010 to deal with the cases of journalists , this according to the Committee for the Protection of Journ@@ alists only initiated two criminal proceedings . &quot;
&quot; as with most thousands of mur@@ ders associated with drug traff@@ icking and organised crime , the mur@@ der@@ ers of journalists are rarely brought to court . &quot;
&quot; at Ri@@ odo@@ ce they still ins@@ ist on treating the violence of Sin@@ alo@@ a , although they are not comfor@@ ting and although the terrain is still more tre@@ ach@@ er@@ ous . &quot;
&quot; without information about the mur@@ der@@ ers , without justice , the meeting for discussion of safety has little benefit , says I@@ bar@@ ra . &quot;
&quot; it is very stupid to waste my time in this workshop , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; as long as we don &apos;t know why , we di@@ gest all . &quot;
&quot; in the morning of May 15 , Val@@ dez left the office of the newspaper Ri@@ odo@@ ce in the province capital of Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an . &quot;
&quot; he only managed to drive a few blocks far before his red Toyota Cor@@ oll@@ a was forced by two men . he was forced from his car and 12 times was shot on him , probably due to the name of the newspaper - which is translated with &quot; Zwöl@@ fter Fluss . &quot; &quot;
the Sag@@ itt@@ arius drove away in his car and damaged it nearby .
Val@@ dez was 50 years old .
he left a woman and two adult children .
rum@@ ors tend to fly freely in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
&quot; but on the topic of Val@@ dez , there is practically nothing to silence . &quot;
&quot; since Gu@@ z@@ man &apos;s arrest last year and ex@@ tradition in the United States in January , Sin@@ alo@@ a became one of the bloo@@ dies@@ t batt@@ le@@ fields of the country since ri@@ val fac@@ tions are fighting here to fill the vacuum . &quot;
&quot; it does not matter that in Sin@@ alo@@ a anyone or more people are shot on the road , or that the cemetery is full of decorated , two @-@ storey mou@@ ths for drug @-@ kings that are bigger than many homes for the living . &quot;
&quot; forget for a minute that there is a state of &quot; tranquility , &quot; if only a cart@@ el has control over the coastal state with its valuable har@@ bours and drug trade routes to the United States . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , despite the fact that Val@@ dez was aware of the dangers of his work , Is@@ mail Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez ( 60 ) , a co @-@ founder and director of Ri@@ odo@@ ce , was broken with the gu@@ ilt that he could not protect his friend . &quot;
he believes that two mis@@ concep@@ tions have contributed to the murder .
&quot; first of all , in February the publication of an interview with Dam@@ asc@@ o Lop@@ ez , a leader of one of the ri@@ val cart@@ on fr@@ actions in the war with Gu@@ z@@ man &apos;s sons . &quot;
&quot; this publication may have anno@@ yed the children , presum@@ ed v@@ ein members bought each copy of the issue as soon as they were delivered to newspaper ki@@ os@@ ks . &quot;
&quot; the second fault was to not force Val@@ dez , following the conf@@ is@@ cation of another newspaper that had published the same story to leave the country for its own security . &quot;
&quot; Val@@ dez was a legend in Mexico and abroad , and his killing is regarded as a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists . &quot;
he had survived so long that his friends and colleagues accepted that he would always be there .
&quot; he worked as an experienced repor@@ ter for Nor@@ o@@ este in 2003 , when he joined with five colleagues for the establishment of Ri@@ odo@@ ce and sold 50 US dollars . &quot;
&quot; in Sin@@ alo@@ a , it was impossible to pursue journ@@ alism without encounter@@ ing the problem of smoking , &quot; Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez said . &quot;
&quot; with time , the newspaper has earned a reputation for cour@@ age@@ ous and honest reporting , and sales and advertising took place . &quot;
&quot; repor@@ ters loved to be able to publish tough examinations without fear of cens@@ or@@ ship , and readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that no one else dar@@ ed to deal with . &quot;
&quot; eight years after the establishment of Ri@@ odo@@ ce , she received the prestigious &quot; Maria @-@ Mo@@ ors @-@ Cab@@ ot Prize &quot; for their coverage in Latin America . &quot;
&quot; in the same year , Val@@ dez won the &apos; International Press Freedom Award &apos; of the Committee to protect journalists for his courage in the persecution of Mexican drug history , wherever it led . &quot;
he volunte@@ ered to be afraid .
&quot; I would like to continue living , &quot; he said at the time of CP@@ J . &quot;
&quot; drug traff@@ icking in Sin@@ alo@@ a &quot; is a way of life , &quot; he said last October in an interview with Rom@@ pe@@ vi@@ ento @-@ TV . &quot;
you have to take over the task that you consider as a journalist - either this or you play the dum@@ my .
&quot; I don &apos;t want to be asked , &quot; &quot; What did you do in the face of so many dead ... why did you not say what went ahead ? &quot;
&quot; the Ri@@ odo@@ ce team missed Val@@ dez , the Sp@@ a@@ ß@@ vogel , who was cur@@ sed as a harbour worker , the friend , who was generous with h@@ ug@@ s and advice , a teacher who knew how to survive . &quot;
they trusted in his routine .
he would always wear his hat .
&quot; he would always go to El Guay@@ ab@@ o , the bar opposite the office , and always sit at the same table there . &quot;
now they ask : was his love for routine his destruction ?
his death also forced her to ask her own assu@@ mptions about how to do her work best and stay alive .
&quot; they don &apos;t like it if you deal with their wives , their children , their clean shops , their secret run@@ ways and run@@ ways to move drugs . &quot;
&quot; these things were not allowed , &quot; &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez . &quot;
&quot; the result is , even in the best times , a high level of self @-@ cens@@ or@@ ship and self @-@ preservation . &quot;
trust his own inst@@ inc@@ ts .
&quot; if it sm@@ ells fal@@ sely , stay away from it . &quot;
&quot; the anno@@ y@@ ance is , the editor of the Fe@@ odo@@ ce Andr@@ es Vill@@ ar@@ real said that &quot; smell is a sense that can be decei@@ ved ... and then things happened to J@@ avier . &quot;
&quot; the old rules , as he and others say , are no longer valid in Sin@@ alo@@ a - just as in Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as , Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z , Gu@@ err@@ ero and other states in which a poison@@ ous mix of lu@@ cr@@ ative sm@@ ug@@ gling routes , weak institutions and corrupt government officials are at home . &quot;
the landscape is changing constantly .
&quot; in the room where the staff of Ri@@ odo@@ ce met for safety training , there were suddenly no mobile phones allowed . days before , it became known that Spy@@ ware , which is sold solely to governments , was used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico . &quot;
&quot; outside , two police officers tried shelter from the heat of 104 degrees ( 40 ° C ) in the shade of a tree . &quot;
they were commissioned by the provincial government to protect the offices of Ri@@ odo@@ ce in a four @-@ story building in a mid @-@ range neighborhood of Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
&quot; half in the joke , some of the repor@@ ters asked if these officers belong to the 50 percent of the police officers , which the governor himself described as un@@ trust@@ worthy . &quot;
&quot; it is months since repor@@ ters went into the mountain landscape , where the drug gangs are fac@@ to under control . &quot;
&quot; for the issue of this week , Ri@@ odo@@ ce has printed on three main stories . &quot;
there was the assass@@ ination of brother of the former known speaker Juli@@ o Ces@@ ar Cha@@ vez in Sin@@ alo@@ a .
they also had an exposure to the public expenditure that concentrated on the hom@@ etown of the Gover@@ nor .
&quot; there was a group in one of the most expensive restaurants in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an , a souven@@ ir sheet from the office of the Prosec@@ utor . &quot;
&quot; there was no official word about who was kid@@ n@@ apped or how it happened , so be careful when it was time to write what everyone knows in the city : that the restaurant is a favorite local of drug dealers and authorities . &quot;
&quot; a repor@@ ter came from public records , that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politi@@ cian who ruled out the ruling Institu@@ tional Revolution Party ( PR@@ I ) , which dominated all political levels almost all the century . &quot;
recently several PR@@ I govern@@ ors were accused of high @-@ cali@@ ber cases of corruption .
&quot; Vill@@ ar@@ real asked the repor@@ ter to write about previous inci@@ dents in this locality , including one in which a son of &quot; El Chap@@ o &quot; Gu@@ z@@ man escaped a military assault . &quot;
only a few months earlier the readers of Val@@ dez had considered the best informed source of the kid@@ n@@ apping .
&quot; earlier we had known what happened , &quot; said Vill@@ ar@@ real , 46 , with the nick@@ name &quot; El Fl@@ aco &quot; because of his slender body stat@@ ur . &quot;
&quot; now , all channels of communication with our sources are broken . &quot;
&quot; Val@@ dez &apos;s office was dedicated to storage box for signs and sti@@ ckers dedicated to the mur@@ ders of journalists , because the employees have become something they had never expected : activists in the name of the press . &quot;
repor@@ ter Miriam Ram@@ i@@ rez grab@@ bed a few signs and went to a demonstration next morning for a further journalist for the office of the prosec@@ utor .
Salvador Ad@@ ame disappeared three days after Val@@ dez had been killed in the western state of Mi@@ cho@@ ac@@ an .
a burned body was discovered and officials say based on DNA tests that it is its .
&quot; in the whole country , journalists have become lou@@ der , written in organized protests &quot; &quot; SOS Press &quot; &quot; on walk@@ ways and buildings . &quot;
&quot; on this day , the director Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez went away in Washington and tries to collect international support for the judi@@ ci@@ ary in the case of Val@@ dez . &quot;
&quot; at a meeting with the governor of Sin@@ alo@@ a on the day following the assass@@ ination of Val@@ dez , Ram@@ i@@ rez accused the authorities to spy out journalists and kill them , because they said the truth . &quot;
&quot; it has been asked since then that it is once again divided by the government , because it is concerned that its anger has viol@@ ated its objec@@ tivity . &quot;
&quot; Val@@ dez had repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico were surrounded by organised crime , involved government officials and a indiffer@@ ent society . &quot;
&quot; in his last book &quot; Nar@@ co @-@ Journ@@ alism , &quot; he wrote that repor@@ ters were not only killed by drug gangs , but also on the command of politicians and security forces that were infected with organised crime under a blan@@ ket . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; Artic@@ ulo 19 &quot; media group , more than half of the attacks on journalists of the police and officials , were assigned more than half of the attacks . &quot;
&quot; in Mexico you die because they want you to keep your mouth , &quot; &quot; said Ram@@ i@@ rez . &quot;
&quot; obviously , the kill@@ ings have a det@@ err@@ ent effect . &quot;
nobody for@@ gets the death of the blo@@ gger Maria Elizabeth M@@ aci@@ as in the northern border of Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as six years ago .
&quot; your body was found together with a note , suppos@@ edly signed by the Z@@ et@@ as Kart@@ ell : &quot; here I am because of my reports . &quot;
a computer keyboard and head@@ phones lay next to their separate head .
&quot; some branches have chosen to close , as the newspaper El Nor@@ te in the northern border of Chi@@ hu@@ ah@@ ua after the assass@@ ination of the correspon@@ dent Mi@@ ros@@ lava Bre@@ ach in March . &quot;
others continue to make El Man@@ ana of Nu@@ evo Lar@@ edo after the assass@@ ination of her director in 2004 .
&quot; in 2010 , the Di@@ ario de Ci@@ ud@@ ad Ju@@ are@@ z publicly addressed the drug cart@@ els with a editorial on the title page with the heading &quot; What do you want from us ? &quot;
some journalists have fled from their home states or even from the country .
it is a painful decision .
&quot; it is hard to find work in exile , and they still watch the streets and look for dangers . &quot;
&quot; and sometimes they are hun@@ ted as it was apparently murdered by the photographer Ru@@ ben Esp@@ in@@ osa , who was murdered in 2015 together with four women in an apartment in Mexico City three months after the escape from Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z . &quot;
&quot; for those who stay behind and continue to work , it is a daily dance with ris@@ ky decisions . &quot;
&quot; I@@ bar@@ ra , who once wanted to be po@@ ets , adm@@ its that drug traff@@ icking was frigh@@ tened . &quot;
&quot; Mexico goes to hell , and that &apos;s why I became repor@@ ter , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; at midnight on the last Friday , when the last issue was already finished , the editors of Ri@@ odo@@ ce sat in front of the office and drinking beer , when all their phones began to sum . &quot;
a series of sho@@ ot@@ ings with tap@@ est@@ ri@@ val and security forces near the Maz@@ at@@ lan swimming pool had left 19 confirmed deaths .
the war continued escal@@ ating as promised by a number of Kart@@ ell messages in the region .
from the on @-@ board edge they published the news on the website of Ri@@ odo@@ ce on mobile phone .
the front page had to be changed the next day .
si@@ r@@ ens he@@ ul@@ led nearby - a further shooting in the area .
&quot; Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez threw a look at the police officers who kept the guard , to see if they were ready . &quot;
&quot; if they were afraid at all , they did not show it . &quot;
&quot; under the massive portrait of the fallen founder of the newspaper , whose middle finger was visible for the whole of Sin@@ alo@@ a , the staff of Ri@@ odo@@ ce followed his mark . &quot;
&quot; how can you only think about it , &quot; &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez , &quot; &quot; If on the same day , when J@@ avier was murdered , the train@@ ee asked me to send them to reporting on the street . &quot;
din@@ osau@@ r used cam@@ ouflage to ev@@ ade his enemies
&quot; at first sight it looks like a statue , alb@@ eit a frigh@@ tening . &quot;
researchers have now found out that the first findings of the incredible r@@ hin@@ or@@ ns of a Canadian min@@ er have been so well received that experts described it as &quot; Mon@@ a Lisa of the din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot;
&quot; it was so well preserved that they could even find that his sli@@ pper@@ y skin was red@@ dish brown - and they said they had something of a &quot; &quot; troubled past . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the report in the journal &quot; Current Biology , &quot; described him as &quot; the immort@@ al arm@@ oured din@@ osau@@ r , who has ever been found , and one of the best din@@ osau@@ r copies in the world . &quot;
the fossil is a newly discovered species of no@@ dos@@ au@@ rs lived in the middle of the ret@@ ace@@ ous period between 110 million and 112 million years ago .
&quot; his unbeliev@@ ably well preserved state has researchers , who described it as &quot; truly remarkable &quot; , &quot; amaz@@ ingly &quot;
according to reports in National Geo@@ graphic the ar@@ mor@@ ed her@@ bi@@ vor@@ es is the best preserved fossil of its kind .
&quot; it was found by Sha@@ wn Funk , when he died on 21 March 2011 at the S@@ unc@@ or Mill@@ enium Mine near Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the north of Alber@@ ta , Canada . &quot;
&quot; he met on something that was lacking from the surrounding rock at the plateau , and decided to look more closely . &quot;
the F@@ ossi@@ l discovered by him was sent to the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rell Museum of Pal@@ e@@ ont@@ ology .
&quot; they spent the next six years to expose the wild beast within the 2,500 pounds ( 1,@@ 100 kg ) of heavy pe@@ an@@ ut . &quot;
&quot; after all this hard work , the finished result is now ready to be revealed . &quot;
&quot; if you bl@@ ink only a little with the eyes , you could almost believe it slept , &quot; said the main author Cal@@ eb Brown , scientist at the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rell Museum where the creature is to be seen . &quot;
&quot; it will enter the science history as one of the most beautiful and best preserved din@@ osau@@ rs copies , the Mon@@ a Lisa of the din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot;
&quot; researchers have found that this her@@ bi@@ vor@@ es , although it is covered with a arm@@ or and resem@@ bles a changing tank , probably threatened by car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot;
&quot; the heavily arm@@ oured din@@ osau@@ r used red and white cam@@ ouflage to hide from pre@@ dat@@ ors , and used a shiel@@ ding technique known as counter@@ f@@ ading that is also used by many modern animals . &quot;
&quot; this would have allowed to mix better into its surroundings and to avoid enemies , say experts , suggest@@ ing that it was threatened by larger din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot;
the 110 million years old creature from the family of the No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier has made head@@ lines in May and is now seen at the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rell Museum of Pal@@ ae@@ ont@@ ology .
&quot; researchers have now studied the wild animal and called Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta mark@@ mit@@ ch@@ elli after the Muse@@ um@@ st@@ echni@@ ker Mark Mit@@ ch@@ ell , one of a team that has spent more than 7,@@ 000 hours with it carefully . &quot;
the astonishing maintenance of the specimen enabled Dr. Mit@@ ch@@ ell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and the shape of scales and arm@@ or over his body .
&quot; they discovered the conf@@ using , a widespread defense method in the animal kingdom , which means that the head of the creature was dar@@ ker than her under@@ side . &quot;
&quot; although the conf@@ is@@ cation is custom@@ ary , the results are surprising as the size of Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta is by far the animals living today . &quot;
it indicates that the din@@ osau@@ r of sufficient pressure was hun@@ ted by meat fres@@ her din@@ osau@@ rs that the evolution fav@@ oured the conce@@ al@@ ment of con@@ frontation as a means of survival .
&quot; but most contemporary animals , who use the con@@ soles - think of roe deer , zeb@@ ras or belt animals - are much smaller and vulnerable to prey , which signals that this No@@ dose au@@ rier was subjected to a real fight for survival . &quot;
&quot; strong pre@@ dat@@ or behaviour on a massive , heavily arm@@ oured din@@ osau@@ rs show how dangerous the din@@ osau@@ r pre@@ dat@@ ors must have been the ret@@ ace@@ ous time , &quot; said Brown . &quot;
chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the skin of the din@@ osau@@ r was bay .
&quot; scientists continue to investigate the animal on his life , including his con@@ served Dar@@ min@@ ent to find out what it has eaten as his last meal . &quot;
&quot; they believe that the din@@ osau@@ r , when he died , got into a river and dri@@ fted into the sea , where he sank down to the bottom of the sea . &quot;
&quot; at that time Alber@@ ta was as warm as South @-@ fl@@ ori@@ da today , and rivers and oceans probably spread much further inland than they are today . &quot;
&quot; this no@@ dos@@ au@@ rier is truly remarkable because it is completely covered with con@@ served skin , but also preserved in three dimensions and preser@@ ves the original form of the animal , &quot; said Brown . &quot;
the result is that the animal looks almost the same today as in the early period of chal@@ k .
&quot; you don &apos;t need to use a lot of imagination to re@@ construct it . if you only play a little with your eyes , you could almost believe that he is at sleeping . &quot;
&quot; the time of chal@@ k was a time when huge thermal di@@ odes , car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ rs standing on two legs crossed the ground . &quot;
&quot; although the king of them , the ty@@ ran@@ n@@ osau@@ rus Re@@ x lived for millions of years to Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta , the arm@@ oured din@@ osau@@ r was hun@@ ted by some of his terri@@ fying ancestors . &quot;
&quot; this includes the Ac@@ ro@@ can@@ th@@ osau@@ rus , a 38 feet ( 11,@@ 5 m ) long , six tons of heavy monsters . &quot;
&quot; scientists , whose latest findings appear in the journal Current Biology , believe that Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta sank after death in the sea and was m@@ um@@ i@@ fied in mud . &quot;
&quot; the creature was found by Sha@@ wn Funk , when he died on 21 March 2011 at the S@@ unc@@ or Mill@@ enium Mine near Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the north of Alber@@ ta , Canada . &quot;
&quot; according to the museum , it is the immort@@ al arm@@ oured din@@ osau@@ r of the world , including skin and arm@@ or , and is completely from the mu@@ zzle to the hip . &quot;
&quot; the creatures were about 18 feet ( 5 meters ) long and weigh@@ ed up to 3,000 pounds ( 1,@@ 300 kg ) . &quot;
it contained two 20 @-@ inch long tops that rag@@ ed from his shoulders .
the researchers believe that the arm@@ oured her@@ bi@@ vor@@ es were sw@@ amped by Western Canada until a floo@@ ded river floo@@ ded it into the open sea .
but the underwater equipment of the din@@ osau@@ r kept its arm@@ or in exquisite detail .
the pet@@ ri@@ fied remn@@ ants of this special specimen are so well preserved that the skin tru@@ sts still cover b@@ ump@@ y tanks along the din@@ osau@@ rs .
&quot; as Michael G@@ res@@ h@@ ko written for National Geo@@ graphic , such a level of preservation is as &quot; rare as a win in the lot@@ tery . &quot;
&quot; the more I consider it , the more conf@@ using it becomes . &quot;
&quot; pet@@ ri@@ fied remn@@ ants of the skin still cover the b@@ ump@@ y tanks , which carry the skull of the animal . &quot;
&quot; his right foref@@ oot is on his side , his five fingers are stretched upward . &quot;
I can count the scales on its sole &apos; .
in the thunder@@ storm : mass car@@ am@@ bol@@ age on A8 : many wounded
hef@@ ty accident on Thursday evening on the A8 : nearly 30 cars are wrapped in a mass kar@@ am@@ bol@@ age .
&quot; there are numerous wounded , kilometres long grain and g@@ aff@@ er . &quot;
&quot; on the motorway Stuttgart @-@ Munich ( A8 ) , about 20 people were injured during a mass @-@ car@@ am@@ bol@@ age during the late Thursday afternoon . &quot;
&quot; after the first data of the police at 17.00 hrs between the connection points Adel@@ z@@ hausen and O@@ del@@ z@@ hausen ( district of A@@ ich@@ ach @-@ Fried@@ berg ) during a thunder@@ storm , almost 30 vehicles , including lor@@ ries , probably also trucks . &quot;
&quot; at first , no information is available for the exact number of the injured . &quot;
&quot; it was moderate to moderate injuries , said a police spokes@@ man . &quot;
a large array of b@@ ail@@ out vehicles was at the accident site .
the A8 was completely blocked in the direction of Munich .
in the direction of Munich an approximately ten kilometres long back @-@ de@@ w was formed .
&quot; like a AZ repor@@ ter , it was also on the counter @-@ road to massive disabled - through numerous g@@ aff@@ ers . &quot;
the fire bri@@ g@@ ade noted the characteristics of the vehicle sector which now have to reck@@ on with sensitive pen@@ alties .
&quot; shortly after 18 : 45 hrs a second accident occurred on the A8 , this time between Augsburg and D@@ asing . &quot;
there was a coll@@ ision between a car transpor@@ ter and a passenger car .
rescue helicop@@ ter was on the way to the accident site .
Deutsche Bahn : group tests &quot; Comfort check @-@ in &quot;
it is a moment that almost everyone has ever experienced : nothing is crazy in the train and sleeps .
or one is deep@@ ened into his work and has just a brilliant mind .
and then : mu@@ f .
comes the conductor and w@@ akes an uns@@ an@@ gled or irrit@@ ates the passenger in the middle of the workflow .
ticket inspection .
but the times of inter@@ rup@@ tions are soon over .
the Deutsche Bahn is currently testing the free ticket inspec@@ tions .
it is simply confirmed by phone that you take your seat and thus vali@@ dates the ticket .
&quot; currently , a test run runs on two routes . &quot;
&quot; when the offer comes , we will expand it . &quot;
&quot; it is expected to be available in Germany at the beginning of next year , &quot; &quot; said a railway speaker . &quot;
&quot; comfort check @-@ in , &quot; the train calls the ticket utilisation without a Schaff@@ ner . &quot;
&quot; in order to be able to use them , however , some conditions must be met : you need a smartphone or tablet . &quot;
and you have to have booked an online ticket - what already most passengers do anyway .
&quot; you also have to buy it via the train , the DB Navigator , which is the most convenient type of ticket booking anyway . &quot;
and last but not least you need a seat reservation .
&quot; because the &quot; comfort check @-@ in &quot; works like this : one goes into the train , calls his ticket under &quot; My Tickets . &quot; &quot;
&quot; with the test customers , a button for the electronic de@@ valuation appears . &quot;
the train atten@@ d@@ ants get a message on their mobile devices that passenger X is in the train and took the booked seat Y .
&quot; when carrying out ticket inspection to place Y , he knows that there is a passenger with already paid online ticket . &quot;
&quot; so you can continue to sleep , continue to keep silent . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; check @-@ in &quot; has two advantages : one for the customer , one for the train - which in turn should use the passengers . &quot;
&quot; those who want to travel relaxed without ti@@ ck@@ eting through our train service personnel , check in the DB Navigator themselves . &quot;
&quot; this allows the passengers to make their travel time more personal in the train , &quot; says Michael Peter@@ son , Marketing Board of DB Fern@@ verkehr . &quot;
&quot; second Plus : &quot; &quot; and our employees have more time than today to respond to individual customer needs . &quot;
&quot; who often runs train , knows that apart from delays and missed trains the ticket inspec@@ tions belong to the biggest anno@@ y@@ ances . &quot;
&quot; for many times , in any case one does not have all the documents necessary for the de@@ valuation of online tickets . &quot;
either the credit card or the identity card or otherwise a document you have to assign .
&quot; the result is endless discussions between train atten@@ d@@ ants and passenger , which leads to bad mood in the section or large area and delays in controlling their own tickets and the Schaff@@ ner at the end takes time to take care of other concerns . &quot;
only a small number of test customers can use the new service .
and that also only on the connections ICE 9@@ 15 Dortmund @-@ Stuttgart and ICE 912 Stuttgart @-@ Essen .
further train numbers on the same route are not yet un@@ locked .
how an activ@@ ist came to learn the answer to the question : &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot;
&quot; on 9 August 2014 , Br@@ itt@@ any Fer@@ rell was sh@@ aken to its core . &quot;
&quot; only one day after she arrived in New York City , it sat in St. Louis Geb@@ or@@ ene on the bed of an Air@@ b@@ n@@ b apartment she rented and sc@@ rolled through Facebook on her phone . &quot;
she stum@@ bled over a post of someone from the High School .
&quot; the police have just killed a 18 @-@ year @-@ old child , and it is still on the road , &quot; he called it there . &quot;
&quot; confused as nobody else posted the information on their feed , she closed Facebook and opened Twitter . &quot;
a user with the Handle @ The@@ e@@ Ph@@ aro@@ ah was constantly saved on their tim@@ eline .
&quot; the r@@ apper from the area of St. Louis was the death of Michael Brown , an un@@ armed black 18 year old , who was killed by a white police officer in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , Mo . &quot;
he posted a picture of Brow@@ ns le@@ thal body that was stretched out on the road and would stay there four hours .
&quot; this is wild , &quot; &quot; thought Fer@@ rell . &quot;
but death was nothing new for them and their community .
she put off her cell phone to return to twe@@ ets about people on the Can@@ field Drive in the evening .
&quot; there were photos from the police tape and people crying out , and by a man who claimed to be Brow@@ ns &apos;s father who wore a shield with the inscription : &quot; &quot; F@@ erg@@ us@@ ons police killed my un@@ armed son ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
she watched a live feed with which a polic@@ eman stood in front of a group of demonstr@@ ators with a bar@@ king dog .
&quot; in another video , she said , secured another polic@@ eman his gun and cried , &quot; &quot; I will kill you ... animals all . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; this is not common , &quot; Fer@@ rell remembered her statement . &quot;
this is not the type of murder we have acc@@ u@@ stom@@ ed to and which we can call typical .
at that moment I felt the ch@@ ills .
I was angry and we@@ pt . &quot;
she booked a return flight and went home the next day .
after the landing at 23 o &apos;clock she got her 6 year old daughter from her father &apos;s house and decided that the two would go to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on next morning .
&quot; what happened in the next three years with Fer@@ rell and F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , is the theme of a new documentary film , &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? , &quot; in cinem@@ as from 11 . &quot;
&quot; it is a history of survival and protest , love and loss , strength and resistance , who are living in the community and filled the streets to demand answers . &quot;
&quot; as Fer@@ rell and her daughter , who wore a flower dress and a matching crown to catch F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , the two discussed a conversation that she had countless times before this morning &quot; about the black experience and the black condition . &quot; &quot;
&quot; you remember how I taught you when black people have to fight for what they believe ? &quot; &quot; they remembered what she said . &quot;
we now go to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on because the police killed an 18 year old boy and that wasn &apos;t right .
&quot; I could not take her , &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ rell later . &quot;
what happened today is a high point of what happened in the past .
it must know and see it and be drawn up in it .
&quot; it must be well developed not only activ@@ ism and organization , but also the different layers of black experience and the black constitution , and what we need to do to free ourselves . &quot;
&quot; even though I have the luck to give her an experience , in which she personally does not experience an ec@@ l@@ ative rac@@ ism , she is no different from the next black women child . &quot;
&quot; I feel , I would show you a bad service to keep them away from it . &quot;
&quot; the first stop , when they arrived in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , was located at the South Flor@@ iss@@ ant Road , a place opposite the police authority that became a camp@@ ground when the activists were waiting for the possible non @-@ charge of Officer Dar@@ ren Wilson . &quot;
&quot; there , Fer@@ rell and her daughter were connected to a local business owner who made lunch . &quot;
they prepared bags and helped to pass them on demonstr@@ ators .
slowly began to adopt a new kind of activ@@ ism for Fer@@ rell shape .
&quot; my activ@@ ism changed completely after 9 August , &quot; she said and noticed that she was a student at the University of Mis@@ sour@@ i @-@ St. Louis President of the Min@@ ority Student Nur@@ ses Association and focused on food justice and health ine@@ qualities in black churches . &quot;
&quot; I had no experience in organizing .
it has come all . &quot;
&quot; weeks later , Fer@@ rell met during an evening demonstration Sab@@ a@@ ah Fol@@ ay@@ an , one of the co @-@ directors of the film . &quot;
&quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an said she and her cam@@ er@@ aman Lucas Al@@ var@@ ado @-@ Far@@ rar just wanted to &quot; document , &quot; what happened . &quot;
&quot; a question came to Fer@@ rell : &quot; &quot; do you want to document or try to find a story you can use ? &quot;
&quot; this scep@@ ticism was nour@@ ished by countless cases of people , often by wh@@ ites - in a community that benefited from their pain and resili@@ ence . &quot;
&quot; as Fol@@ ay@@ an said recently in an interview : &quot; &quot; we heard that people who were born and raised in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on have not centered their voices and we wanted to do it differently . &quot;
&quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an had already collabor@@ ated with the co @-@ director Dam@@ on Davis , an artist from the area known for his activ@@ ism around To@@ dest@@ ra@@ kt occup@@ ants . &quot;
his engagement brought the project closer together with six other locals followed by the team of &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; in the years after Brown &apos;s shooting .
&quot; this documentary is not someone who speaks for us or talks to us . we talk , &quot; &quot; Davis said . &quot;
&quot; that was the main thing for me , as these people are represented , for so I will be represented . &quot;
&quot; the goal was not to concentrate on Ferr@@ ite &apos;s experience - to show that it is not a m@@ essi@@ ah leader , but a community that comes together , &quot; said Fol@@ ay@@ an - she proved to be the most obvious participant of the film . &quot;
&quot; as a result , documents of &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets &quot; show surprising personal aspects of Ferr@@ ite &apos;s life as she falls in love and mar@@ ries her wife . &quot;
&quot; I felt like naked , &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ rell and laugh@@ ed when she saw the finished product for the first time . &quot;
but I understood that in this work and in the human@@ ization of black people there must be a certain vulner@@ ability .
&quot; in addition , Ferr@@ is &apos;s history repe@@ ats the role of the black gay women in the wider Black @-@ Li@@ ves Matter movement . &quot;
&quot; two of the three founders of the movement , which after the killing of the black teen@@ ager Tra@@ y@@ von Martin in 2012 have shaped the film &quot; &quot; Black@@ live Matter &quot; &quot; in social media , identify themselves as gay . &quot;
&quot; black , gay women in leadership positions have borne the movement altogether , &quot; said Fer@@ rell , &quot; and therefore we are constantly fighting on different fron@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; black , gay women have to bear the main burden of everything . &quot;
&quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an agreed to note that &quot; the movement really is maintained by black women and many black women . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it is , however , that &quot; this is not affir@@ m@@ ative type of action , &quot; chosen by Fer@@ rell because of its identity as the heart of the film . &quot;
&quot; she was the person who sh@@ ook this energy , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; it is not a coinci@@ dence , although she was at the foref@@ ront , because with a life at these junc@@ tions as a black , gay woman stands so much on the game . &quot;
you can feel their energy through the screen . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , the news cameras in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on have long since disappeared , but the r@@ acial connections between the community and the police continue to exist . &quot;
Fer@@ rell is for 2 ½ years because of blocking a highway at a demonstration .
it describes the socio @-@ political atmosphere of the area which she calls her home : &quot; a chaos . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , she compl@@ ains about singing and she feels committed to this memory since she went into F@@ erg@@ us@@ on three years ago . &quot;
it is our duty to fight for our freedom .
it is our duty to win .
we must love and support each other .
we have nothing to lose - except our chains . &quot;
from &quot; dream &quot; to &quot; meg@@ al@@ om@@ ania &quot; : TV readers discuss about bit gallery
&quot; the bit gallery moves people , even though it is not built for a long time . &quot;
but the idea of a shopping center at the south end of the pedestrian prec@@ inct spl@@ its the population in pro@@ pon@@ ents and opponents since the first presentation 2009 .
the theme is very cold .
also on our Facebook page &quot; Volks@@ fre@@ und Bit@@ burg &quot; the topic is discussed .
&quot; while the one to the bit @-@ gallery say : &quot; that would be a dream &quot; ( Anja Becker ) or &quot; This would be really great &quot; ( Nicole Schau@@ sten ) , comes from the other side : &quot; doesn &apos;t need a man &quot; ( Sig@@ gi B@@ etzen ) or quite simply : &quot; &quot; size w@@ ahn &quot; &quot; ( Lars Sch@@ olz ) . &quot;
&quot; while pro@@ pon@@ ents build that a gallery draws more customers into the city , of which the other shops benefit , the opponents fear that the pedestrian zone ble@@ eding . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the gallery is planned exactly on the plot on which the peasant market hall is , in which 13 direct markets offer their products . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the construction work , it will be an end . &quot;
&quot; the gallery makers want to integrate a market hall into the new building - namely , to the Bed@@ a square with the opportunity to sit outside . &quot;
Simone Zimmer : &quot; we have been buying almost every week in the peasant market for many years .
&quot; mainly our eggs , but also the delicious cakes of the women are always happy . &quot;
we also discovered the but@@ cher &apos;s shop for us .
we would like to wish that even during and above all after the construction of the gallery there is a chance to maintain this offer .
there are also other cities in other cities .
especially the small market hall in Frankfurt is interesting . &quot;
Gerd D@@ ens@@ ing : &quot; whether direct mark@@ eted in a market hall in the gallery appears on the amount of rent .
&quot; this is likely not to be very low in the new project . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Eva K@@ ili@@ c : &quot; what is the shopping spre@@ e in Bit@@ burg ?
&quot; whether clothing , shoes , dru@@ g@@ - or supermarkets , I find that su@@ perf@@ lu@@ ous . &quot;
there is enough of it in our city .
you can see how many shop stores are empty here - some for months and years .
&quot; but since there is not even a regular weekly market , it is all the more important that at least the market hall remains intact . &quot;
&quot; after all , the goods offered there are mostly offered directly by the producer and is inexpensive . &quot;
&quot; as you can see , shop stores in a shopping center are only rented by larger companies , because the dor@@ sal rent are often not portable for a retailer . &quot;
&quot; a p@@ ity , special shops there is almost no more and that which is left of it will probably disappear . &quot;
Wolf F@@ andel : &quot; a shopping m@@ all with a market hall does not fit for me .
and the gallery does not fit to Bit@@ burg .
&quot; above all , where is the peasant market hall during the construction time ? &quot;
the old E@@ de@@ ka would be the solution - even if the bit gallery actually arrives at some point .
or does it create the gh@@ ost@@ st bit gallery before distribut@@ ing all shops from Bit@@ burg ?
George Mar@@ quet : &quot; that will simply not work .
&quot; and a shopping center , which is empty , no one needs . &quot;
&quot; in my opinion , it would have been better to promote a real farmers market instead of this gallery . &quot;
&quot; but for a peasant market hall , thanks to the ins@@ ane many - as I find - point@@ less construction projects in Bit@@ burg no more space . &quot;
&quot; when the peasant market hall is broken , a piece of culture will disappear again . &quot;
a matching simil@@ arity : artist creates portraits with Chelsea Mann@@ ings DNA
&quot; in the middle of the Fri@@ d@@ man Gallery in New York , many faces can be seen - white , black and brown that are almost inde@@ struc@@ tible - that hang on cables from the ceiling . &quot;
the 30 portraits were created by the artist He@@ ather De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg made of che@@ eks t@@ up@@ pers and hair@@ cuts that were sent to her by Chelsea M@@ anning .
&quot; M@@ anning sent excer@@ pts from the prison Fort Le@@ aven@@ worth , where the former secret service analy@@ st consisted of a 35 @-@ year sentence , after making them publicly tra@@ ded diplomatic missions on the site Wiki@@ Le@@ aks . &quot;
&quot; the new exhibition , opened on 2 August , is called A Bec@@ oming resem@@ b@@ lance ( A matching simil@@ arity ) . &quot;
&quot; she is the product of two years of correspondence between De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose discipline combines expertise in technology , computer science and art , and M@@ anning , a trans@@ ference and ground@@ breaking dis@@ sident , whose conviction was converted by Barack Obama when he had only three days in his office . &quot;
&quot; De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , through algorith@@ mic analysis of DNA , was extracted from M@@ anning and created out of the 30 portraits , as someone with these gen@@ om@@ ic data could look like , and the inherent determin@@ ism of these interpre@@ tations - but also created for identity . &quot;
&quot; M@@ anning , who was born as Brad@@ ley Edward , has already been openly referred to as woman since her pu@@ ber@@ ty , was convic@@ ted for 20 charges , including six violations of the spy law , computer fraud and theft . &quot;
&quot; in prison , her image was supp@@ ressed , so much that there was only one photo - a gran@@ ular , black @-@ white sel@@ f@@ ie , in which M@@ anning obviously sits on a driver &apos;s seat and carries a plat@@ inum @-@ blonde wig - with which she was associated . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 , De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg just returned from the great success of her 2012 project &apos; Stran@@ ger Vis@@ ions &apos; . &quot;
&quot; in this , the artist produced portraits of foreign art@@ ef@@ acts like cigar@@ ette dum@@ b and ch@@ ew@@ ing g@@ um by extrac@@ ting DNA from waste to produce a picture of how these people could look like . &quot;
this was the time when she received an e @-@ mail from a newspaper magazine .
&quot; they conducted an interview with Chelsea M@@ anning while she was in prison , and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article , &quot; explained De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg at a press preview of the new exhibition . &quot;
&quot; and she could not be visited at that time and she could not be photograph@@ ed , so you took contact with Chelsea and asked her if she wanted to make a DNA portrait . &quot;
&quot; the artist and her im@@ pris@@ oned mice became un@@ equal bri@@ eff@@ re@@ ties , which exchanged several letters over the course of two years . &quot;
&quot; they even created a Com@@ ic &quot; &quot; Supp@@ ressed Images &quot; &quot; illustrated by Sho@@ ili Kan@@ ung@@ o , which would predic@@ t a future where the president would convert chel@@ seas ver@@ dict and would be able to see the exhibition personally . &quot;
&quot; that Obama is actually only a few days after the book was published to demand Mann@@ ings &apos;s release after seven brutal years in a military prison in K@@ ans@@ as , it was a welcome kind of happ@@ i@@ est coinci@@ dence . &quot;
&quot; there is also now at the opening of the exhibition some deep and strong , as Donald Tru@@ mp takes a war against in@@ forman@@ ts from the government camp and against trans@@ gender troops to find new , twe@@ et@@ able ways to fix the rigid spl@@ its that he actually should fix . &quot;
&quot; when De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg asked for the strange timing of all these things , she said that &quot; things happen for a certain reason . &quot;
&quot; in a artistic statement written on the wall of the gallery , M@@ anning started with her over@@ sized signature ( the &quot; i &quot; in her family name is marked with a heart ) an end of the &quot; automatic frag@@ mentation , whose basis gender , race , sexu@@ ality and culture have been . &quot;
&quot; on the opposite wall is their mit@@ och@@ on@@ dri@@ al DNA sequence - a thous@@ and@@ ler of Cs and Gs and As , written in pencil . &quot;
&quot; De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg hoped to show through the inclusion of 200 letters ( or nucle@@ ot@@ ides according to the highly developed scientific enc@@ y@@ clo@@ pedia of the artist ) , as amaz@@ ingly similar , at least in a biological sense , we are all . &quot;
&quot; what people hopefully will bring along is that our gen@@ ome doesn &apos;t care about who we are and how openly genetic data for interpretation and how subj@@ ectively they are , &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose video work of 2007 , Francis Mem@@ ories , is also visible . &quot;
&quot; DNA data can tell so many different stories , therefore the 30 of these stories are . &quot;
the last piece in the exhibition that is kept in a separate room is a page from the above mentioned Com@@ ic @-@ Nov@@ elle .
&quot; she shows M@@ anning , as she appears with a hands @-@ free speech in the hands of the disciplinary bar@@ racks of the United States like King @-@ Kong . &quot;
&quot; when they make your speech , they have won , &quot; it says . &quot;
&quot; so , never stop the mouth . &quot;
&quot; it came straight from a letter which she wrote to me , &quot; &quot; said the artist , who gre@@ ets from Philadelphia . &quot;
I still get go@@ os@@ eb@@ um@@ ps when I talk about it .
&quot; M@@ anning has not seen the exhibition personally - as predicted in the comic book - but if it should do it , it will be welcomed in the middle of the room by the masks , from its own gen@@ om@@ ic simul@@ ac@@ ras , which conver@@ ge like hor@@ des of prot@@ esters . &quot;
&quot; this was also pur@@ pos@@ eful , like everything in the exhibition , up to size ( 5 &quot; 2 , man stat@@ ure ) , where their genetic h@@ ap@@ lo@@ groups were written with pencil . &quot;
&quot; in the past , I had them on the wall , but I wanted them to feel like a crowd , &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg from portraits . &quot;
&quot; I wanted it feels like a mass movement that formed with Chelsea , like the movement that was hiding behind her release . &quot;
Professor of North@@ western University and an employee of the University of Oxford wanted for murder
&quot; a nation@@ wide human hunt is underway for a professor at North@@ western University and an employee at Oxford University , who were considered susp@@ ects after a man had been killed in a luxurious apartment in Chicago with deadly injuries . &quot;
&quot; on Monday , W@@ yn@@ d@@ ham La@@ them ( 42 ) and Andrew War@@ ren ( 56 ) were issued arrest warran@@ ts due to murder due to their alleged involvement in the death of Tr@@ ent@@ on H. James Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au , such as the acts of the Cook County Local Court . &quot;
&quot; the documents say that Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au , 26 , died after several stit@@ ches . &quot;
a common warning system published by the police authority in Chicago means that the cor@@ p@@ se was discovered on July 27 .
&quot; officials received a call , arrived at the Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victim with several injuries on his body . &quot;
&quot; Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au was still dead in the scene of action for dead , and investig@@ ators investigate the stit@@ ches as murder , while the police are actively looking for the two susp@@ ects , said officials . &quot;
&quot; since 2007 , La@@ them has been an extraordinary professor of micro@@ biology and immun@@ ology at North@@ western University . &quot;
&quot; Alan K. Cu@@ bb@@ age , the vice president for university relations , said in an e @-@ mail declaration that La@@ them should now be assessed and excluded from entering the North@@ western University campus . &quot;
&quot; this is now a criminal affair to be examined by the competent authorities , and North@@ western University co@@ operates with this investigation , &quot; &quot; said Cu@@ bb@@ age . &quot;
War@@ ren is Senior Treas@@ ury Assistant at Oxford University .
a spokes@@ man at the University and the Som@@ er@@ ville College said in an e @-@ mail declaration that &quot; we are in contact with the police in the UK and ready to help US investig@@ ators in any possible way .
the statement added that War@@ ren &apos;s colleagues were shock@@ ed and want him to be .
&quot; chief Communications Officer of the police authority of Chicago , Anthony Gug@@ li@@ el@@ mi said he urged the susp@@ ects to ask the authorities . &quot;
&quot; the police has an idea of their where@@ ab@@ outs , and our efforts to locate them , &quot; &quot; said Gug@@ li@@ el@@ mi . &quot;
&quot; Gug@@ li@@ el@@ mi said that local , regional and national authorities help to find the susp@@ ects . &quot;
&quot; Gug@@ li@@ el@@ mi said that the police received a call from the building manager of the Grand Plaza building , who had just received a mysterious tip , said that something happened in apartment 10@@ 08 . &quot;
the police described the scene as very cruel .
&quot; Gug@@ li@@ el@@ mi said it was uncle@@ ar whether the incident took place on July 27th , too . &quot;
security cameras have been confirmed that La@@ them and War@@ ren were in the building .
&quot; we believe that Professor L@@ ath@@ am and the victim had a relationship , &quot; said Gug@@ li@@ el@@ mi . &quot;
&quot; the management team from Grand Plaza published an explanation of the inhabitants : &quot; &quot; the police are currently working on the tim@@ eline and the background of the victim and resear@@ ches a variety of motifs , including a possible domestic incident . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we will close the WA@@ DA road@@ map in the near future &quot; &quot; - the Russian Vice @-@ President Mut@@ ko &quot;
&quot; the Russian dep@@ uty Vit@@ aly Mut@@ ko said , it won &apos;t take long before the remaining criteria of the world anti @-@ dop@@ ing agency ( WA@@ DA ) are implemented to restore the Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing agency ( R@@ USA@@ DA ) . &quot;
&quot; in a certain stage of meeting the criteria of the road@@ map , R@@ USA@@ DA has the right to plan and test in cooperation with U@@ K@@ AD ( UK Anti @-@ D@@ oping ) . &quot;
&quot; the WA@@ DA road@@ map was updated in this respect , &quot; said Mut@@ ko on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; the PM commented on the second part of WA@@ DA &apos;s road@@ map to comply with the Code , which describes the criteria for re @-@ setting R@@ USA@@ DA , and was recently published on the organization &apos;s website . &quot;
&quot; according to Mut@@ ko , he does not contain anything that could cause any concern for Russia . &quot;
&quot; everything was announced , everything is implemented . &quot;
&quot; the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee ( IO@@ C ) and WA@@ DA in the near future , &quot; he added . &quot;
&quot; one of the criteria mentioned in the list is , however , that Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing authorities have to publicly accept the reported results of the investigation conducted by the WA@@ DA by the Canadian lawyer Richard Mc@@ L@@ aren about alleged state @-@ supported dop@@ ing in Russian sport . &quot;
&quot; regarding the matter , Mut@@ ko said : &quot; &quot; we carry out the investigation , because our anti @-@ dop@@ ing system got a mistake . &quot;
all measures have been implemented .
&quot; but there were no state programs , and we will not admit anything that does not exist . &quot;
&quot; mut@@ kos words voted with those of Vit@@ aly Sm@@ ir@@ nov , the head of the independent Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing commission . &quot;
&quot; in conversation with the Russian sales office at the beginning of the day , Sm@@ ir@@ nov was problems of the past in Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing organizations , but added : &quot; we have repeatedly said that the report contains controversial positions and regulations . &quot;
&quot; no one has to accept this report un@@ condition@@ ally , &quot; &quot; added Sm@@ ir@@ nov . &quot;
&quot; in November 2015 , R@@ USA@@ DA was excluded from the execution of dop@@ ing controls in Russia in November 2015 . &quot;
&quot; however , it was allowed to plan and coordinate tests under the supervision of international experts and the UK Anti @-@ D@@ oping ( U@@ K@@ AD ) . &quot;
&quot; following a visit to the headquarters of the Moscow Organisation in July , the director Olivier Nig@@ gli explained that R@@ USA@@ DA is moving &quot; in the right direction &quot; to be used again . &quot;
Al@@ di does not sell eggs anymore
they divided the group of companies .
&quot; it is a purely precau@@ tionary measure , it could not be assumed by any health imp@@ air@@ ment , it was said in the communication . &quot;
&quot; from now on , only eggs can be delivered to Al@@ di which have been demonstr@@ ably tested on fi@@ pr@@ on@@ il@@ lic anti @-@ lice . &quot;
Al@@ di wanted to make clarity and transparency to its customers .
the start @-@ ups that will help your company will not become the next U@@ ber
A@@ my Er@@ save wanted to measure luck with your employee luck at your e @-@ commerce start @-@ up but the surveys did not work .
&quot; answers were often v@@ ague , little helpful or - even worse - frau@@ dul@@ ent . &quot;
&quot; and even if you promised anony@@ m@@ ity , some workers did not trust the process . &quot;
&quot; there was simply never consistency and objec@@ tivity , &quot; said Er@@ ret@@ t , who operates the 75 @-@ person San Francisco e @-@ commerce Hair Care company Ma@@ di@@ son Re@@ ed . &quot;
she called people out of the outside for help .
a new breed of Human Resources Start @-@ ups is at the w@@ ax@@ ing to help companies find out how their employees feel .
&quot; through the creation and licensing of software , which has the specific purpose of measuring the employee engagement , it enables companies to address surveys , special groups and demographic groups , and in some cases wh@@ ist@@ le@@ blo@@ wer@@ n allows to deal with the C @-@ Suite managers and directly turn to the Board of Directors . &quot;
&quot; they now have tools such as Stra@@ va and Fit@@ bit for the pursu@@ it of their health , but where is the Fit@@ bit for your company ? &quot; &quot; said Jim Bar@@ nett , co @-@ founder and Chief Executive of Red@@ wood City Start @-@ up G@@ lin@@ t , whose software analytics tools are used by companies to measure staff commitment . &quot;
she said that she had a better insight into what your employees think and feel at G@@ lin@@ t in the three years .
&quot; in addition to the sn@@ ap surveys and surveys from certain teams , it offers a heat card of the company which shows at a glance which units have most complaints and which managers have low approval results - so that you can re@@ bo@@ ve why . &quot;
&quot; companies come to see that at the top of the work culture , you must not be the next ure@@ ter that has been involved in sc@@ and@@ als since a former employee has published a blog post which describes an environment of nu@@ ances where those who have spoken . &quot;
&quot; for start @-@ ups like G@@ lin@@ t , this wish is an overview of lu@@ cr@@ ative business opportunities . &quot;
&quot; global governance , regulation and compliance industry could have more than $ 1@@ 18.@@ 7 billion , according to the finanz@@ technical website Let &apos;s Talk Pay@@ ments . &quot;
&quot; Den@@ ver , Colorado , start @-@ up Conver@@ tible , the company helps to prevent and detect poor behavior , saw an increasing interest and activity at the beginning of this year amid the U@@ ber @-@ F@@ all in Mis@@ sk@@ re@@ dit . &quot;
&quot; Conver@@ tible has nearly 600 clients , including Air@@ b@@ n@@ b , Microsoft and Tes@@ la . &quot;
u@@ ber has recently signed up as a client .
&quot; like G@@ lin@@ t , converting company lets you send customized &quot; pulse &quot; surveys , collect sensitive responses in real time and view the heat @-@ cards of your problem areas . &quot;
&quot; it also provides an anonymous SMS hot@@ line , which allows employees to report bad behaviour . &quot;
&quot; and if the main business leader is involved , complaints go directly to the Supervisory Board . &quot;
&quot; the Court of Public Opinion has captured regul@@ ators , &quot; said Patrick Qu@@ in@@ lan , the founder and managing director of Conver@@ tible . &quot;
&quot; if a company is found that his employees are badly treated or beha@@ ved un@@ ethical , it can experience costly consequences due to consumer boy@@ cot@@ t , employee fluctu@@ ation and complaints , Qu@@ in@@ lan said . &quot;
&quot; ruby Tuesday , the restaurant chain with over 25,000 employees and over 500 locations , has deployed Conver@@ tible for more than a year to ensure that employees are aware of the policy and procedures and have an easy way to reach their corporate headquarters . &quot;
&quot; earlier , if an employee wanted to report a problem , he or she had to find a phone number or email for the company headquarters , a formal complaint and hope that he was taken seriously . &quot;
&quot; it was often a inti@@ mid@@ ation and uncomfortable experience , said James Vit@@ rano , Ruby TU@@ ES@@ DA@@ YS General Co@@ uns@@ el who said there was no good way to follow the complaints of employees . &quot;
&quot; now , since the company Conver@@ tible is setting up , problems that previously were hidden by managers who were sitting in offices in cities or states - such as discrimination , har@@ ass@@ ment or un@@ fair intern@@ s could be identified and addressed faster . &quot;
&quot; I can approach this holistic , 360 degree view of experience with employment , &quot; said Vit@@ rano , who leads the risk management group from Ruby Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; and we protect our shareholders from employment disputes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; company began to take ethics , values and employee engagement in 2002 , after the accounting firm Arthur Ander@@ sen collap@@ sed due to ethical violations by the En@@ ron sc@@ andal , Qu@@ in@@ lan said . &quot;
&quot; but it took until the &quot; social media came to their right , &quot; that companies recognized that they could not prevent their dirty laundry online . &quot;
&quot; before using technology to monitor ethics , people used hope as a strategy , &quot; he said . &quot;
both G@@ lin@@ t and Conver@@ tible offer your software as a service and charge the companies with recur@@ ring charges for using their products .
it is a business model and a chance to find the approval of venture capital investors who supported both start @-@ ups .
&quot; Conver@@ tible gained $ 10 million in funding in February by companies such as Sapphire Vent@@ ures and T@@ ola Capital , raising the total capital to $ 47 million . &quot;
&quot; gl@@ itz@@ ers secured $ 10 million in November by B@@ ess@@ emer Venture Partners , bringing total funding to $ 60 million . &quot;
&quot; these investments are hardly surprising considering the connected nature of companies , culture and venture capital . &quot;
&quot; there is a growing complex of research , which shows that today &apos;s employees expect more of their jobs than before . &quot;
&quot; in competitive markets such as Silicon Valley , high sal@@ aries and interesting projects are only bet@@ s . &quot;
employees want to feel that you are accepted and appreciated and that you give your time to a company with a positive mission .
&quot; when people are happy to be in a company , feel that their voices heard and that the work that you do is worthwhile , then they feel stronger to make this company successful , &quot; said Nina Mc@@ Queen , Vice President of Global Benef@@ its and Employee Experience at Link@@ ed@@ In , which is both Conver@@ tible and G@@ lin@@ t . &quot;
investors reach Ren@@ dite when their portfolio companies run well . companies run well when employees are committed and engaged .
&quot; if the analytics tools of third promise , commitment and commitment of employees to increase , it is no wonder that you will find support . &quot;
the data on employee engagement in accordance with the experts in the workplace culture is important .
but the data is useless if the car@@ et@@ aker of a company does not take action .
&quot; in fact , if a company asks for your feedback , it may have an expectation that change is on the way . &quot;
&quot; and if the change doesn &apos;t come fast enough , or not at all , this can breed dis@@ appointments and motiv@@ ate employees . &quot;
&quot; if you ask for 4,000 suggestions , you have to be ready to have 4,000 discussions , &quot; said Rus@@ sell Ra@@ ath , President of Consulting at the Business Management company Kot@@ ter International , who has seen the company very much on collecting data . &quot;
&quot; for if you do not follow staff questions , &quot; &quot; Have you really heard me ? &quot;
do you care about it ?
&quot; and if you don &apos;t care about , why should I ? &quot;
&quot; Ma@@ di@@ son Re@@ ed , who now conduc@@ ts monthly personnel surveys , was able to initiate measures on the same day when a problem is reported via G@@ lin@@ t , saving . &quot;
&quot; and after collecting feedback from fru@@ str@@ ated employees , it was able to re@@ organize several teams within the company and to add a communication training to address the problems . &quot;
&quot; with Ruby Tuesday , the company always gets new insights about the employees , and it hopes that in a long run this leads to better bonding of workers in a sector that is known for high turnover . &quot;
&quot; if you are not obliged to create a culture of transparency , you will lose people , &quot; &quot; said Vit@@ rano . &quot;
&quot; and if you lose people , you also lose customers . &quot;
&quot; and if you lose customers , then you will lose business . &quot;
the N@@ CA@@ A removes the two @-@ day practices and makes a long day for fry
it starts at 23 : 00 when a lot of U@@ C@@ LA footage conver@@ ges on one side of the new exercise fields of the team on campus .
some have pulled out their tri@@ cot tops and show the back full of sweat from the first day of the training camp .
for a good part of the team they represent a lunch break .
players who are written about the summer courses will return to their final audi@@ ts after the three @-@ hour exercise before they return to the Wasser@@ man Football Center next morning .
&quot; this is for the boys the next three days a real treat , &quot; said Bru@@ ins @-@ Trainer Jim Mor@@ a shortly before the Monday was Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; the N@@ CA@@ A elimin@@ ates two @-@ day exercises to ease the load of the players , and she has actually extended their days - at least until the final on Friday . &quot;
&quot; therefore , the first three trainings of the U@@ C@@ LA should start at 19 : 15 in order to meet the already fully @-@ packed schedule of players . &quot;
&quot; the com@@ promises away from the two days is more than a day , at which the Bru@@ ins postpon@@ ed the start of the camp almost a week after the last season and during the summer school for the first time during Mor@@ as six playing times carried out practical exercises . &quot;
they are supposed to hold 18 exercises over the course of August . 20 before the start of formal game preparations for their pr@@ el@@ ude to Texas A &amp; M in September .
&quot; Mor@@ a said that he supported the regulation of the N@@ CA@@ A , even if they add another point to the busy routes of the players . &quot;
&quot; we place this enormous strain three or four days on it , and it is very challenging , &quot; said Mor@@ a . &quot;
&quot; and they simply pushed it through , they plac@@ ken further , they are great people . &quot;
&quot; I think as soon as we come to Saturday and we have more time , it really gets great . &quot;
&quot; the U@@ C@@ LA will finish its practices as soon as the camp is finished , considering the clear lines of its fields from an adjacent car park and adjacent Lus@@ kin Center , a hotel of the up@@ scale class , which is already cleared with foot@@ balls which sp@@ ati@@ te a protective net behind a gate , no easy task . &quot;
&quot; Bru@@ ins players are to occupy the hotel from this weekend , but Mor@@ a adm@@ its that there could be a problem as soon as these rooms are free during the season . &quot;
&quot; we will use our security , &quot; said Mor@@ a . &quot;
&quot; this is a real problem , and it is not far fet@@ ched to think that people can hire a room there and then sit there to record an exercise . &quot;
&quot; if you have the video sample from an exercise , it &apos;s a pretty good business . &quot;
&quot; but we have security forces there , and we have security forces on parking 8 . &quot;
we will do the best with what we have .
that is why I don &apos;t worry too much about that .
we have a plan . &quot;
Facebook wants to intensi@@ fy facts review in the fight against bog@@ us messages
&quot; Facebook wants to send more potential articles with fal@@ si@@ fications of third parties and show their results below the original contribution , the world &apos;s largest online social network on Thursday . it is one of his efforts to fight so called F@@ ake News . &quot;
&quot; the company said in a statement on his website that it will begin with the use of updated machine learning methods to identify possible false noti@@ fications and to send them to the fact test , which may display results of the fact check out of the original article . &quot;
&quot; Facebook has been critic@@ ised as one of the main distribution points for so @-@ called F@@ ake News , many of which believe that they have also influenced the U.S. presidential elections in 2016 . &quot;
&quot; the problem has also become a major political issue in Europe , whereby the French vot@@ ers were floo@@ ded with false stories in the run @-@ up of the presidential elections in May , and Germany does not support a plan to quickly eliminate h@@ asser@@ ting post@@ ings as before the elections there in September . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , Facebook said in a separate declaration in German that in the USA , France , the Netherlands and Germany a test of the new facts review will be started . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the knowledge which stories of fac@@ tual inspec@@ tors are challenged , people want more context to make informed decisions about what they read and share , &quot; said Sara Su , product manager for Facebook messages in a blog . &quot;
&quot; she added that Facebook continues to test his feature on the &quot; &quot; related article &quot; &quot; and works on other changes to his news feed to l@@ essen false news . &quot;
creating a novel novel : a Castle in the History of England
in his younger past the small Scot@@ ney Castle was seen in a sque@@ eze music video and was a lo@@ op@@ hole for Margar@@ et Th@@ at@@ cher in the 1970 @-@ s and 1980 @-@ s .
&quot; but Scot@@ ney has experienced 700 years of turbul@@ ent history from its cozy seat at the Bew@@ l River Valley in K@@ ent and is now an inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rho@@ des , a mop@@ ha@@ ired Yor@@ k@@ shi@@ re@@ man with a pre@@ dil@@ ection for historical documents . &quot;
&quot; I think it &apos;s so nice to look at the manuscript from someone who has been dead for 300 years , &quot; he says . &quot;
what a personal relationship to keep this letter in my hand .
&quot; a Castle in England &quot; sp@@ ans the time from the Middle Ages to the Age of Edward and documents the families living in Scot@@ ney . each story was illustrated by another British artist - Isaac Lenk@@ ie@@ wicz , Bri@@ ony May Smith , William Ex@@ ley , Beck@@ y Pal@@ mer and Isabel Gre@@ enberg . &quot;
&quot; it is not the first Rho@@ des book based on an archive : he wrote in 2014 &apos; Dead Men &apos;s Te@@ eth and Other Stories &apos; , a collection inspired by documents in the British Library - a project that he found unexpected emotional . &quot;
&quot; I only re@@ acted on the thumb @-@ print on the side of a letter that was written by a double @-@ agent in the 1700 @-@ s , who worked for the Jacob@@ ins , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is his thumb @-@ print ! &quot;
&quot; and ep@@ ist@@ les are always sm@@ elling to smoke , because at that time a fire was kind@@ led because of the light . &quot;
&quot; for someone who lives 300 years later , the smell has an effect as if he himself would be . &quot;
&quot; Oh , I love archives ! &quot;
&quot; for someone who has been beaten with old papers that he is supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council England and lived almost four months in a castle ( &quot; &quot; To be honest : I have over@@ rated my welcome greeting &quot; &quot; ) this all seems too beautiful to be true . &quot;
&quot; Rho@@ des spent his days exploring the Vict@@ orian &quot; new &quot; castle , to look through the archives and study the many treasures and curi@@ osi@@ ties of the castle , such as the mounted hy@@ ri@@ ots on the walls and the bottles which had spent centuries in the dit@@ ch . &quot;
&quot; he walked through the site and the ruins of the old castle and talked with landsc@@ apers , gardening and sometimes also with the artists who worked on the illustrations of his book . &quot;
&quot; then , at night he d@@ rank &quot; Whis@@ key &quot; and began to write . &quot;
&quot; the intimate history of Scot@@ ney is relatively unknown since the National Trust received full access in 2006 , when the last Er@@ bin , Elizabeth Hus@@ sey , died . &quot;
&quot; when Rho@@ des arrived a decade later , the employees began to take care of the archive , which he said &quot; hundreds of years in which aristocr@@ ats said , &quot; Oh , throw it on the attic . &quot; &quot;
&quot; di@@ aries , letters from the time of English Emp@@ ires , cards representing what possessed : &quot; you might think that country conflicts would be boring , &quot; says Rho@@ des , &quot; but there was a bir@@ ch fighting for the two families . &quot;
&quot; guys , let &apos;s go all his gear ! &quot;
&quot; some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to immer@@ se on a broader basis in the English story , including &apos; The Lab@@ our@@ er &apos; , who follows a man who leaves the newly built castle to join the peasant revol@@ t of 13@@ 81 . &quot;
&quot; there is a record of a clock that occurred in the castle in 13@@ 80 , in this book entitled &apos; K@@ nigh@@ tly Famili@@ es of K@@ ent and Sus@@ sex &apos; , says Rho@@ des . &quot;
&quot; the peasant revol@@ t began in this area and I thought , an u@@ prising was a good start . &quot;
maybe the two are connected to each other ? &quot;
&quot; other stories are firmly rooted in the history of the castle - like &apos; The Pri@@ est &apos; , which tells the story of the Jesu@@ it Pat@@ ron , who hid the Dar@@ rell family for seven years during the English Reformation . &quot;
&quot; or &apos; The Sm@@ ug@@ gler &apos; in which the sm@@ ug@@ gler Arthur Dar@@ rell was portra@@ yed in the 18th century , which filled his own funer@@ al by filling a coff@@ in with stones ( a discovery that was made only years later when his coff@@ in was excav@@ ated ) . &quot;
&quot; Dar@@ r@@ ells are Rho@@ des &apos;s favorite family of Scot@@ ney : &quot; &quot; the gent@@ lemen seemed to be quite a dar@@ ker , always make debts and spend money for things they couldn &apos;t afford . &quot;
&quot; other generations of Dar@@ rell @-@ men solved their debt crises by mar@@ rying rich old women - I imagine them as a bunch of well @-@ looking guys , with a talent to advertise . &quot;
&quot; after the end of his work in the castle , Rho@@ des is searching for other unique writing experiences &quot;
&quot; he has a two week stay in the Finnish wilderness for a comic novel about El@@ äm@@ än@@ mä@@ ki behind him , the grounds of a san@@ atorium from the early 20th century , which has since been rec@@ laimed by nature again . &quot;
but Scot@@ ney has a special place for him .
&quot; I was sad to go back , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; it was like &quot; &quot; Oh , now I have to deal with the dam@@ ned life again . &quot; &quot; &quot;
launched : over 300 years old Mari@@ enkap@@ elle in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf envel@@ op@@ ed
&quot; with the unvei@@ ling of the 301 year old Mari@@ enkap@@ elle in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf , the city of Bad Honnef has launched its campaign to launch a new umbrella brand ( Rund@@ schau from Thursday ) . &quot;
&quot; until Thursday , mayor Otto Neu@@ hoff and his marketing team want to keep Nelson Art@@ z &apos;s logo and slogan secret . &quot;
&quot; at the end of August , it is supposed to be a highlight of the campaign on the island of Gra@@ fen@@ wer@@ th . &quot;
&quot; too beautiful for us .
or ? &quot; ask the makers of the action yesterday on the posters at the Rh@@ ön@@ dorfer Chapel .
&quot; we think that ( of course ! ) not really , &quot; write them on their website yesterday . &quot;
but we use this measure to attract your attention .
and to make it clear that some are better than it seems .
&quot; basically , we are firmly convinced that as bad Honne@@ fer citizen we know very well about the beauty and attrac@@ tiveness of our city . &quot;
&quot; in action , it is more than &quot; just &quot; a logo and a slogan , it is called further . &quot;
&quot; it is true to form@@ ulate a stand@@ alone promise , one that gives the city an unmistak@@ able unique feature . &quot;
&quot; finally , she stands in the competition with other communities . &quot;
&quot; in Bad Honnef , the city of Bad Honnef will cost their new umbrella brand and the campaign . &quot;
military reforms in Turkey - Erd@@ og@@ gans fear of the army
&quot; each year at the beginning of August , Ankara advis@@ es the Supreme Military Council ( Y@@ AS ) on pensions and promotions in the Off@@ iz@@ ier@@ sk@@ or@@ ps . &quot;
so this week .
at first sight a normal procedure .
but nothing is routine for the Turkish armed forces one year after the coup attempt .
&quot; the meeting was no longer held in the building of the General Staff , as formerly , but in the prime minister of the Prime Minister . &quot;
&quot; among the deliber@@ ations under the chair@@ manship of the government , the five Vice @-@ idents and the Ministers of Defence , In@@ ner , Justice and Foreign Affairs also participated . &quot;
these were the civilians in the Y@@ AS in the number of transi@@ tions .
the government moves the re@@ ins in the military .
&quot; the Chief of Staff of Hul@@ us@@ i Ak@@ ar remains in office , but the commander of the army , the air@@ force forces and the n@@ avy were abandoned . &quot;
&quot; since the failed coup , Erd@@ og@@ an 169 of the 326 gener@@ als and admir@@ als were fired . &quot;
&quot; over 10,000 soldiers were removed from the ranks of the army - mostly due to alleged links to the movement of the ex@@ iled pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , the Erd@@ og@@ an as wi@@ pul@@ ler of the coup attempt . &quot;
&quot; against 486 people , who allegedly participated directly at the coup attempt , this week has been negoti@@ ated in Ankara . &quot;
&quot; on the day after the coup , Erd@@ og@@ an had called the &quot; &quot; God &apos;s gift &quot; &quot; as he had the opportunity to fully puri@@ fy the armed forces . &quot;
but Erd@@ og@@ an has really got a grip on the army ?
&quot; at the end of February , the newspaper &quot; Hür@@ ri@@ yet &quot; published an article with the heading of &quot; dis@@ comfort in the military headquarters . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in the general staff there are concerns about an increasing &quot; Islam@@ ization &quot; of the army , which among other things mani@@ f@@ ests itself in the ab@@ olition of the head@@ scarf ban for soldiers , wrote the newspaper . &quot;
&quot; at any rate , large @-@ scale protection against the army and security forces goes on . &quot;
&quot; in the middle of July Erd@@ og@@ an ordered more 7@@ 395 citizenship by decree , among them 230@@ 3 polic@@ emen and 546 soldiers . &quot;
it seemed that Erd@@ og@@ an en@@ umer@@ ated the military .
the gener@@ als were old earlier than the actual masters of the country .
&quot; three times , they put@@ ted their role as guar@@ di@@ ans of the secular state order . &quot;
&quot; following his election victory in 2002 , Erd@@ og@@ an pressed the power of the military step by step , not least by calling on the reforms of the European Union . &quot;
former officers say Erd@@ og@@ an induc@@ es targeted Islam@@ ization of the armed forces .
&quot; in the &quot; Vo@@ cal Europe &quot; magazine , an especially not so @-@ called officer , who was seeking asylum from persecution abroad asylum after the coup attempt , the Turkish army will be &quot; full of extre@@ mi@@ sts and Sal@@ af@@ ists in a few years . &quot; &quot;
&quot; if this is true , such a development could not let N@@ ato be cold . &quot;
&quot; anyway , in the alliance after the pur@@ ges there is doubts about the deployment of the Turkish army . &quot;
&quot; the leadership structures and operational capabilities are &quot; weak@@ ened , &quot; N@@ ato diplom@@ ats say . &quot;
Washington changes rules for the Green Card
&quot; there will be a new US immigration plan to change the rules of Green Card , said President Donald Tru@@ mp , quoted from the media . &quot;
&quot; he proposes to lower the legal immigrants to 50,000 per year , stric@@ ter rules for obtaining vis@@ as for a temporary work permit and restrictions for family @-@ oriented vis@@ as . &quot;
the new rules are proposed by the Republi@@ cans and supported by the President .
the bill is to be discussed in the two chambers of the Congress .
&quot; this law will reduce poverty , increase wages and save billions of dollars for tax@@ pay@@ ers and will do so by the US to change the way citizens from other countries will be issued Green Cards . &quot;
the law will prevent the chain migration and replace the current system .
&quot; this new application procedure will benefit the candidates who have the financial means to support themselves and show knowledge that will benefit our economy , &quot; said Tru@@ mp , cited by the American media . &quot;
Ministry wants to refurb@@ ish track for racing shuttle
&quot; again and again over the past few months , over the future of the Renn@@ stei@@ sh@@ utt@@ les had been fought - now it should go very fast . &quot;
&quot; even before the end of the year , the route is scheduled to be built on which the tourist train leaves . &quot;
&quot; in order to secure the future of the Renn@@ stei@@ sh@@ utt@@ les long @-@ term , according to the Transport Ministry , construction work will start on the track this year . &quot;
&quot; with the decision to further order and renov@@ ate the route Il@@ men@@ au @-@ Renn@@ stei@@ g , the country is committed to this particularly important connection for tourism , &quot; &quot; declared Secretary of State Klaus S@@ üh@@ l on Friday in Erfurt . &quot;
the costs for the repair of the track were estimated at around 2.5 million euros .
&quot; from this sum , the country sur@@ passes 75 percent . &quot;
&quot; the contract , on which the shuttle will also be ordered from the country in the future , will be finally voted , stated S@@ üh@@ l . &quot;
the ministry and the southern Thuringia train as operators are already agreed upon the technical details .
&quot; this means that the road@@ map , the vehicles used and the quality standards are negoti@@ ated , &quot; S@@ üh@@ l said . &quot;
the planned contract between the Ministry and the railway company will be closed for a period of eleven years .
&quot; in this way , the Renn@@ stei@@ g Shuttle should be ordered regular on December 2017 . &quot;
the Renn@@ stei@@ g Shuttle is an especially popular rail link between Il@@ men@@ au and Renn@@ stei@@ g railway stations .
&quot; in recent months , the course of a pilot oper@@ s has been tested whether the route is used by sufficiently many people to order them again in the future . &quot;
the track is also very low in parts .
the rise of sex robots is real and we should worry about
&quot; just as you thought it can &apos;t become even crazy 2017 , a new report on technological developments in the field of sex robots is coming . &quot;
&quot; yes , indeed . &quot;
sex robots are currently a big thing .
the Foundation for Respon@@ sible Robotics ( FR@@ R ) recently published a report on the development of sex robots over the next five to ten years .
&quot; no@@ el Shar@@ key , Emer@@ itus Professor of Robotics and Arti@@ ficial Intelligence at the University of She@@ ff@@ ield and Co @-@ Fo@@ under of the FR@@ R , we have to begin to take her as@@ cen@@ sion seriously . &quot;
&quot; customers can choose the eye color of the robot , its shape of the ni@@ p@@ ples and the type of f@@ ing@@ ern@@ ail . &quot;
&quot; people make fun about them , but the companies deliver a lot of it and we will see them much more frequently , &quot; &quot; said Mr. Shar@@ key for publishing his new report . &quot;
modern sex dolls have developed from their infl@@ atable partners to robots with a silicone skin that feels warm - with consciously human reactions that are achieved by artificial intelligence .
&quot; the user can also adjust his robot according to his beliefs , and select everything from the eye color of the robot to the type of ni@@ p@@ ples to the type or color of his f@@ ing@@ ern@@ ails . &quot;
&quot; but it becomes even more distur@@ bing , as many robots have the &quot; personalities &quot; that would make a step@@ ford @-@ woman progres@@ sively . &quot;
modern sex dolls have developed to robots with a silicone skin .
&quot; the Real@@ Bot@@ ix robot allows for example its users to adapt their robots to the properties they find appealing , such as sh@@ y@@ ness . &quot;
&quot; and then there is the Ro@@ xx@@ xy Gold sex robots developed by True Compan@@ ion with pre @-@ programmed personalities such as Fri@@ gi@@ d Far@@ rah , who gives the impression of sh@@ y@@ ness and &quot; Wild W@@ endy &quot; with an &quot; adv@@ entu@@ rous &quot; personality . &quot;
&quot; Ro@@ xx@@ xy Gold has a personality that is adapted to your personality as good as possible , &quot; war@@ ms the website of True Compan@@ ion . &quot;
&quot; she likes what you like , and she doesn &apos;t like what you don &apos;t like , etc . &quot;
&quot; in the course of the day , she also has her m@@ oods - just like real people ! &quot;
&quot; she can be tired , can be fixed on conversation or she can be &quot; &quot; in mood &quot; &quot; ! &quot;
&quot; there are many distur@@ bing aspects of this rise of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the sub@@ mis@@ sive feminine features , the sus@@ cep@@ ti@@ bility to rape , when one goes a step on Fri@@ gi@@ d ( i.e. : resist@@ ing ) Far@@ rah , wor@@ ms one most . &quot;
true Compan@@ ion Ro@@ xx@@ xy compatible with a vibr@@ ator but for men .
&quot; if women ( sic ) can have a vibr@@ ator , why can men then have no Ro@@ xx@@ xy ? &quot; it is on the website . &quot;
&quot; however , these sex robots are not just a fe@@ tish or just just another sex toy . &quot;
&quot; their emergence and increasing refin@@ ement point to something dar@@ ker and deeper in our culture , to a retreat from the ideal of gender equality towards a desire for sex with submission as an optional enc@@ ore . &quot;
&quot; most men will naturally not hold sex robots , and while the FR@@ R acknow@@ le@@ dges its rising popularity , they remain provis@@ ional at the edge of consumer culture . &quot;
&quot; but what le@@ ak@@ age out of the boundary zones can be very instruc@@ tive in relation to the spirit of time in which we live , very instruc@@ tive . &quot;
and many people are not stran@@ gely or insul@@ ting until they have given permission to the free market .
&quot; there is however a certain over@@ lap that these highly developed sex robots emerge in a time when the rights of women are threatened around the world , in which there is a president in the White House who pra@@ ises women sex@@ ually attacked . &quot;
&quot; the most det@@ err@@ ent aspect of the TV series &apos; The Hand@@ maid &apos;s T@@ ale &apos; ( &apos; The Report of the Mag@@ d &apos; ) are not the graphical pictures , the intri@@ cate body and the stuff@@ ed eyes , but how realistic this vision works . &quot;
&quot; the Republic of Gilead is a jump , but at the moment it does not feel like a big jump . &quot;
the goal behind these sex robots is to make a physical resem@@ b@@ lance to real women as realistic as possible ( alb@@ eit with por@@ no @-@ star proportions ) .
their builders want them to feel human to im@@ itate the movement of a real body .
&quot; but , brought to the point when it comes to their &quot; personalities , &quot; the robots are not real women . &quot;
they cannot separate themselves from their companion or simply go away .
&quot; they have no medi@@ ation or background history , nothing that suggests independence or anything that might distur@@ b the imagination of total submission . &quot;
&quot; in other words , they are pleasing slaves . &quot;
or to express it in the speech of 2017 : ma@@ ids
Tru@@ mps big performance ?
he makes Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney the ep@@ it@@ ome of healthy human mind
&quot; it has become a rush @-@ assurance of the Tru@@ mp era that the political divisions , which have pol@@ ari@@ zed the U.S. vot@@ ers , have also split families in small @-@ format . &quot;
around Christmas and Th@@ ank@@ s@@ giving Day there were newspapers with advice on how to deal with the horror of Tru@@ mp &apos;s relatives .
we all rig@@ or@@ ously rep@@ ent to let our filter bub@@ bles burst .
less has been noticed is the power of Tru@@ mps to bring families together .
&quot; I mention this because my cous@@ in , a lef@@ tist poet who lives in Chicago and has long been busy with the Republi@@ cans in our family , visited me this week in New York . &quot;
it reminded me that unity against a common enemy can have a powerful effect .
&quot; Tru@@ mp in the White House is everyone who knows them , including the republi@@ can relationship with which they fought for decades because of politics , suddenly and completely on the same side . &quot;
&quot; the dining table is certainly a good thing , but it seems to me in a further context that this also brings significant risks . &quot;
&quot; the left was strengthened by Tru@@ mp , but the immediate effect of his pres@@ idency has the power to push all of us to the right . &quot;
&quot; when we speak of &quot; norm@@ alization &quot; and Tru@@ mp , we refer to the gr@@ us@@ el@@ ty way that his k@@ itt@@ ens of one day will no longer be off@@ ended . &quot;
&quot; however , there is an even more frigh@@ tening long @-@ term scenario in which Tru@@ mp Republi@@ cans of the right wing are norm@@ alized , which suddenly appear as the ep@@ it@@ ome of reason@@ abl@@ eness at once in comparison to his standards . &quot;
&quot; I find myself today of an active nostal@@ gia for Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney &apos;s original version of the mad@@ man - the dog on the Aut@@ od@@ ach , the 14 % income tax ( but at least we knew how his tax declaration looked like ) - both compared to Tru@@ mp in fact one as very mild off@@ ences . &quot;
&quot; when Tru@@ mp goes , the next candidate of the re@@ public@@ ans must be mentally healthy in order to qualify as an im@@ meas@@ urable improvement . &quot;
&quot; when my cous@@ in was in the city , we brought our children to the carousel in Central Park , the biggest of the Kar@@ uss@@ ells of the New York park department , and the best three dollars you can spend in the city if you don &apos;t need a c@@ aff@@ eine . &quot;
&quot; the horses are enormous , the fi@@ ber@@ glass designs on the central cylinder - all c@@ low@@ ns are cris@@ p and the animals are twi@@ sted to look at full of fear of their own shoulders - most dark and the cli@@ ming music convey@@ s this in a strange way . &quot;
&quot; so many c@@ lich@@ és of a city dis@@ ap@@ point : the views of high buildings are old , the sky@@ lines are too familiar to offer much excitement , and the reality of the city will not do justice to the dream . &quot;
&quot; thirty @-@ five years later , and I &apos;m still not quite over the day when I found that Swiss Cottage is indeed not a Swiss cottage - the theme pub Y@@ e Ol@@ de Swiss Cottage is not one - but a big round@@ about in the north of London . &quot;
&quot; however , the Central Park carousel is still a strange magic experience , since two @-@ year @-@ old , a 11 @-@ year @-@ old and two women in the 40 @-@ ies can go on it and have all a great time . &quot;
&quot; if I could rate the carousel , I would have given him the full score , but fortunately nobody asked him . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , this week I was forced into a department store to evaluate my &quot; experience &quot; with transactions on a scale of one to five stars before I could go through my credit card . &quot;
&quot; in the coffee house at the corner of my street , it &apos;s the same , plus the option to balance the rating with a 15 % tip - this to buy something about the counter . &quot;
&quot; this not only results in slow@@ ing down what should actually be a neutral exchange , but also exer@@ ts pressure on the server to bring personality into a situation where there is no need . &quot;
&quot; the poor woman in the department store stood ap@@ ologi@@ zing , while I was tired of having the experience to submit to my credit card with five stars . &quot;
Oscar Pist@@ ori@@ us transferred to hospital with chest pain from prison
&quot; for the second time , Pist@@ ori@@ us left the prison for a hospital visit . &quot;
&quot; last year , he was brought to hospital because of the treatment of cuts to his wrist , which he suffered from prison authorities in one case in his cell . &quot;
&quot; on account of murder , Pist@@ ori@@ us was sentenced to a first death sentence due to murder following an appeal by the prosec@@ ut@@ ors . &quot;
he killed Ste@@ enk@@ amp in the early morning hours of Valent@@ ine &apos;s Day 2013 by scre@@ aming her several times by a door of the toilet cabin in his home in Pre@@ toria .
&quot; Pist@@ ori@@ us claimed that he held his girl@@ friend for a no@@ c@@ turn@@ al inv@@ ader , hiding in the cabin . &quot;
&quot; the prosec@@ ut@@ ors have announced their intention to insert this time against the six @-@ year prison term of Pist@@ ori@@ us App@@ ell , of which they say she is too si@@ ghted . &quot;
the National Criminal Inves@@ tigation Department said that it was obj@@ ected to the Supreme Court of South Africa and the obj@@ ection could be heard this year .
Pist@@ ori@@ us risk that his sentence is increased to 15 years if the prosec@@ ut@@ ors are successful .
there is no death penalty in South Africa .
when farmer Arnold finds a strange egg
&quot; as the last of the schools , the four @-@ t@@ opp@@ ers from H@@ ats and E@@ pf@@ en@@ hofen were dischar@@ ged into vac@@ ations and schools . &quot;
&quot; three of the discharge pupils in the future go to the Gymnasium , four to the secondary school . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday evening , Angel@@ ika Sit@@ te welcomed the parents and representatives of the public at the Bürger@@ haus Bi@@ es@@ ental in E@@ pf@@ en@@ hofen . &quot;
&quot; the 29 pu@@ pi@@ l of the four classes chosen by Sophia Schumacher and Reg@@ ine Me@@ der selected a young eagle , which grows in the h@@ ens yard , but then released into freedom . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the m@@ lower band introduced a musical with the title &quot; Der Adler im Hüh@@ ner@@ hof . &quot; &quot;
&quot; farmer Arnold found a strange egg , and caused it to bro@@ aden it from his chick@@ ens . &quot;
&quot; instead of a chicken , a small eagle came out . &quot;
&quot; but the hope of making a chicken out of him struck , and the eagle stretched out his wings on a high mountain , and s@@ wore . &quot;
&quot; after that , the classes showed three and four in the study of Y@@ vonne Frank a chicken dance . &quot;
the h@@ ens d@@ anced with the young Go@@ ck@@ les who bore cylinder to bet .
&quot; the Eagle stands for the integration , said school leader Angel@@ ika Sit@@ te . &quot;
&quot; the young is different from the other k@@ itt@@ ens ( chic@@ ks ) , but belongs to it . &quot;
but he will never be like a chicken .
its purpose is to be free .
she wished every four @-@ t@@ eller that he feels accepted in his new school .
&quot; there followed thank@@ s@@ giving to the colleagues , the former school director Michael Müller , who always jumps back to school cur@@ ses , and the parents &apos; representatives . &quot;
&quot; the time of cooking is now over , the class teacher Sophia Schumacher declared . &quot;
&quot; after two years of teaching , she only aband@@ ons classes very much , because it was a really great time . &quot;
&quot; finally , they can rely on the four @-@ t@@ opp@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; finally , all students completed a song from summer time and holiday season . &quot;
there was great joy in the children .
eight first @-@ winners are already registered for the new school year .
two Bulg@@ arians arrested for illegal camping in Greece
&quot; two Bulg@@ arians were im@@ pris@@ oned for illegal camps in Greece , the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , quoted from television . &quot;
&quot; on the morning of August 1 , a group of illegal people arrested in Si@@ th@@ onia , including the two Bulg@@ arians . &quot;
&quot; on the same day they were released , while an investigation is underway . &quot;
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs reported B@@ TV that the Bulg@@ arians were later released .
&quot; the Greek authorities have exac@@ erb@@ ated the control of the free camp and place anyone who is found to stay in a place , which is not intended for this purpose , substantial fin@@ es . &quot;
the controls are continued throughout the season .
the ministry said that the court could impose a fine @-@ sentence .
software update for diesel vehicles : what those affected need to know now
how exactly does the software update take place ?
will diesel drivers need to participate in the promotion ?
the most important questions and answers at a glance .
&quot; at the diesel summit , BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW Corporation have offered software updates for a total of around 5.3 million cars . &quot;
you should improve the emissions behaviour of car emissions from Euro 5 and partially Euro 6 .
Euro @-@ 4 diesel or worse are exemp@@ t from it .
Anja S@@ met@@ an@@ in from the ACE Auto Club Europe ass@@ essments :
is the new action obligatory ?
&quot; no , the software updates tra@@ ded are optional . &quot;
&quot; the obligatory updates previously only apply to the vehicles that have the Schum@@ an software , &quot; says Anja S@@ met@@ an@@ in . &quot;
the retro@@ fitting has arranged the power @-@ drive federal office ( KBA ) .
how and when will customers be informed about updates ?
&quot; the manufacturers have announced rapid implementation in the next few months , but not yet called an exact date . &quot;
Daimler has communicated to each person concerned .
&quot; if an inspection is due anyway , this will be done within the framework . &quot;
how long should the conver@@ sions be drawn altogether ?
&quot; hard to say , &quot; says S@@ met@@ an@@ in . &quot;
this depends on the commitment of the manufacturers as well as from political pressure .
&quot; for we have seen , voluntarily the car manufacturers act on the subject of the environment so far . &quot;
how long should the update take ?
the conversion itself could take only three to four hours in the workshop .
time @-@ consuming can be to get an appointment .

ll Cool J Recei@@ ves Kennedy Center Award
the Kennedy Awards Gala is one of the most gl@@ amor@@ ous events in Washington .
the first award ceremony under President Tru@@ mp promises to be political .
one of the lau@@ re@@ ates does not want to come - from protest .
ll Cool J ( 49 ) is the first z@@ apper one of the cov@@ eted awards of the prestigious Kennedy Center .
&quot; as the cultural direction of Thursday announced on Thursday , singer Gl@@ oria Est@@ ef@@ an ( 59 ) , Li@@ onel Rich@@ ie ( 68 ) and the chore@@ o@@ grapher Carmen de Lav@@ all@@ ade ( 86 ) and the TV producer Norman Le@@ ar ( 95 ) belong to the scri@@ bes . &quot;
the awards will be handed over at the beginning of December .
&quot; traditionally , U.S. President Donald Tru@@ mp will host a reception and participate together with his wife Mel@@ ania at the award ceremony . &quot;
the award winner Le@@ ar announced with progressive TV series therefore already announced to reno@@ unce the participation in the g@@ ala .
&quot; he said : &quot; &quot; this pres@@ idency has decided to completely negl@@ ect the arts and human rights - and even depri@@ ve them of the means - and that bur@@ dens me . &quot;
&quot; the 59 @-@ year @-@ old Est@@ ef@@ an stressed , she will use Tru@@ mp &apos;s conversation to clear her view . &quot;
&quot; the Kennedy @-@ Center , named after former President John F. Kennedy , is the largest cultural institution in the US capital . &quot;
&quot; the former prize winners include Mer@@ yl Stre@@ ep , Are@@ tha Fran@@ klin , Robert De N@@ iro , George Lucas , Tom H@@ anks and St@@ ing . &quot;
we make the city worth living
&quot; Roland W@@ acker , Has@@ l@@ ach@@ s Stadt@@ bau@@ meister , will reti@@ re next year . &quot;
&quot; the place is already written , however , suitable applicants are rare . &quot;
&quot; for 31 years , W@@ acker Stadt@@ bau@@ meister is a master builder . &quot;
and the work always makes him great fun as he convey@@ s in the Pres@@ seg@@ es@@ prä@@ ch .
&quot; he reports of varied , but also demanding tasks waiting for his successor . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , it is mir@@ acul@@ ous that no application for the requirements profile has been fulfilled so far . &quot;
the city is looking for an architect or civil engineer at the earliest possible time .
this is to be done in compliance with the regular periods of notice - still enough time for a revision .
&quot; since Has@@ lach is responsible for the administrative community as a Lower Building Law , the applicant must assign corresponding conclusions . &quot;
because this function wants to keep the city in any case .
&quot; if they can no longer fill them out , the citizens would have to travel to Off@@ enburg . &quot;
&quot; but the proximity to the city is important to the city and it itself , says W@@ acker , who reports from a good operation climate and good atmosphere between the authorities and citizens . &quot;
&quot; in more than 30 years in office , some important projects have accumulated , looking back on the W@@ acker with pride . &quot;
&quot; we make the city life worth , &quot; he is sure about the office and its staff . &quot;
&quot; but also in the future , varied projects are on the agenda : the re@@ design of the former Hu@@ kl@@ a @-@ Are@@ als and the Nieder@@ ho@@ fen@@ park@@ platz are imp@@ aired . &quot;
&quot; the zig@@ z@@ ag bridge between Boll@@ enbach and Stein@@ ach is renewed , even the stadium renovation is still subject . &quot;
&quot; the latter will strike with about 1.5 million euros , &quot; if we do it right , &quot; W@@ acker appreci@@ ates . &quot;
&quot; all in all , great tasks await my successor . &quot;
the work here is fun . &quot;
design is available for a city building master of great play@@ room .
Has@@ l@@ ach@@ s &apos;s own building yard and gar@@ dener can be re@@ acted flexibly to many .
&quot; you can move a lot , &quot; says W@@ acker , and the design of the green spaces is often praised by citizens and visitors . &quot;
&quot; since the Old Town stands as an ensemble under monument protection , it is important to &quot; &quot; have an eye on what is pure &quot; &quot; when new buildings are approved , the separ@@ ating Stadt@@ bau@@ meister empha@@ sizes . &quot;
&quot; anyway , the Stadt@@ bau@@ meister carries great responsibility . &quot;
&quot; he is a builder , &quot; &quot; at the end everything goes over my table . &quot;
&quot; with care and coordination , he can count on many years of staff : Markus Neu@@ ma@@ ier ( Hoch@@ bau ) has been here for ten years , Manfred Schön@@ er ( Tief@@ bau ) for 15 years . &quot;
&quot; also that his successor remains for a long time , W@@ acker wishes : &quot; we are looking for someone who really wants to identify and stay with the place . &quot;
&quot; continuity is not only important for a good working climate , but also for the further design of the city . &quot;
&quot; if you want to inher@@ it Roland W@@ acker , you should have a completed study as a graduate engineer or a Bachelor &apos;s degree with subject architecture , and have good technical knowledge in the areas of construction and construction planning . &quot;
&quot; the Stadt@@ bau@@ amt under@@ lines high and civil engineering , building instruction , gra@@ fic valu@@ ations , administration of urban properties , urban farm with building yard and urban gardening as well as lower building rights authority , including preservation of monuments . &quot;
bicycle on lines thrown : South railway line closed
&quot; according to the police , the previously unknown perpet@@ rators had thrown the blue bike from the rail track in the area of Le@@ ob@@ ene Street ( B@@ 116 ) . &quot;
these were so badly damaged that the approaching goods had to be stopped .
the investig@@ ators go out of two male offen@@ ders and have been searching for them for the night @-@ hours .
&quot; near the crime scene , witnesses had been observed by witnesses of a ros@@ ary sco@@ oter and a bike rider . &quot;
&quot; this goes far beyond a Laus@@ bu@@ ster kingdom , &quot; &quot; said Ö@@ BB @-@ spokes@@ man Christoph Pos@@ ch on the AP@@ A . &quot;
the perpet@@ rators would have brought themselves in great danger and also je@@ op@@ ardi@@ zed the traffic .
&quot; in addition to the damage to the locom@@ otive and the plant , as well as the delay of delays and the costs for rail transport vehicles , also sponsors of the railway customers could come to the perpet@@ rators . &quot;
&quot; all in all , from a &quot; substantial &quot; sum , the spokes@@ man said . &quot;
&quot; the damages were rec@@ tified on Friday afternoon , the rail traffic on the southern railway line could be guided without disabilities . &quot;
&quot; just about ten passenger trains were out Friday morning , two of them considered the correspondence . &quot;
&quot; freight trains did not drop , but they had delay . &quot;
&quot; according to Ö@@ BB spokes@@ person Christoph Pos@@ ch , about 200 meters of overhead lines had to be replaced . &quot;
insul@@ ators and ma@@ sts were also damaged .
&quot; red meat , dairy products and chocolate could help rel@@ ieve IB@@ D ( inflammatory bow@@ el disease ) &quot;
red meat and chocolate can sound like a night@@ mare for your diges@@ tive system .
&quot; but a new study claims exactly the opposite : a diet , which is rich in meat @-@ based proteins and dairy products , could alle@@ vi@@ ate the symptoms of patients with inflammatory bow@@ el disease . &quot;
&quot; the inc@@ urable condition in the United States affects approximately 1.3 million and in Great Britain 300,000 , causes stomach cr@@ amps and paraly@@ sis , recur@@ rent or bloody di@@ arr@@ ho@@ ea , weight loss and extreme ti@@ red@@ ness . &quot;
&quot; while those affected are usually advised to avoid meat and dairy products to alle@@ vi@@ ate their symptoms , researchers found the Wash@@ ing@@ ton@@ er University that the essential amino acid tr@@ yp@@ t@@ oph@@ an contributes to the development of the immune cells that promote a toler@@ ant gut . &quot;
&quot; the conduc@@ tive researcher , Dr. Marco Col@@ onna , explained that immune cells in the gut are pat@@ rolling to ensure that harmful micro@@ bes that hide in the food , do not penet@@ rate into the body . &quot;
&quot; cells that are able to trigger inflammation , are balanced by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body , without dam@@ aging sensitive tissues . &quot;
&quot; if the balance is too far towards inflammation , it can result in an inflammatory bow@@ el disease . &quot;
experiments have been found that a type of tolerance induc@@ ing immune cell is found in mice that carry a certain bacter@@ ium in their intest@@ ines .
and the bacter@@ ium needs tr@@ yp@@ t@@ oph@@ an - one of the building blocks of proteins - to trigger the appearance of the cells .
&quot; Professor Col@@ onna said : &quot; &quot; we have a connection between a bacterial species - Lac@@ to@@ bac@@ ill@@ us reu@@ ter@@ i - which is a normal part of the gut micro@@ bi@@ ome , and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance . &quot;
&quot; the more tr@@ yp@@ t@@ oph@@ an the mice in their diet had , the more they had from these immune cells . &quot;
&quot; he suggested that the combination of L. reu@@ ter@@ i and an in Tr@@ yp@@ t@@ oph@@ an rich diet toler@@ ant , less infl@@ amed intestinal mot@@ ions , if the same system is also beneficial in humans . &quot;
&quot; the post @-@ doc@@ torate Dr. Lu@@ isa Cer@@ v@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ rag@@ an examined a kind of immune cell that promotes tolerance when she found that a group of study mice had such cells , but another group of the same tribe , but that had not been separated . &quot;
&quot; it assumed that the difference with the intestinal micro@@ bi@@ omes of the mice had to do - the community of bacteria , viruses and fung@@ i , which normally live in the g@@ astro@@ intestinal tract . &quot;
the mice of mice were sequ@@ enced by DNA sequ@@ encing and six bacterial species were found that were present in mice with the immune cells but without missing them in mice .
&quot; mice were pulled up in a sterile environment so that they lack@@ ed intestinal micro@@ bi@@ ome and they did not develop this type of immune cells , and they received the l. reu@@ ter@@ i and the immune cells . &quot;
&quot; to understand how the bacteria penet@@ rated to the immune system , the researchers let L. reu@@ ter@@ i grow in a liquid and then transferred small amounts of fluid - without the bacteria - to un@@ ripe immune cells isolated from mice . &quot;
the immune cells developed into the toler@@ ant @-@ promoting cells .
&quot; as the active component of the liquid was cle@@ ans@@ ed , it proved to be a by @-@ product of the tr@@ yp@@ t@@ oph@@ an metabolism , known as an In@@ dol @-@ 3 lac@@ tic acid . &quot;
&quot; when the researchers double the amount of tr@@ yp@@ t@@ oph@@ an in the feed of mice , the number of such cells increased by about 50 percent , but when the tr@@ yp@@ t@@ oph@@ an values were hal@@ ved , the number of cells decreased by half . &quot;
Dr. Cer@@ v@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ rag@@ an explained that people have the same toler@@ ant cells such as mice and that most of us protect L. reu@@ ter@@ i in our g@@ astro@@ intestinal trac@@ ts .
&quot; it is not known whether Tr@@ yp@@ t@@ oph@@ an @-@ by @-@ products from L. reu@@ ter@@ i develop the cells in people such as mice , but defects in genes in relation to tr@@ yp@@ t@@ oph@@ an were found in people with inflammatory bow@@ el disease . &quot;
she said : &quot; the development of these cells is probably something we want to promote since these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the intest@@ ine .
&quot; potentially , high tr@@ yp@@ t@@ oph@@ ane values in the presence of L. reu@@ ter@@ i can lead to an extension of this population . &quot;
Jose M@@ our@@ in@@ ho believes that Manchester United has committed a &quot; geni@@ us &quot; with N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic
&quot; Manchester United has signed a &quot; geni@@ us &quot; with N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic , believes Jose M@@ our@@ in@@ ho , after the mid@@ fiel@@ der had his debut at S@@ amp@@ dor@@ ia on Wednesday evening . &quot;
&quot; the 40 million pound under@@ line of Chelsea began with a 2 : 1 victory in Dublin , the last pre @-@ season game before the UEF@@ A Super Cup against Real Madrid began on Tuesday , and impressed in the holder &apos;s role as people like Paul Pog@@ ba and Andreas Per@@ eira mar@@ ched at will . &quot;
&quot; however , M@@ atic was excluded from the blues tour of the blues and only lasted 45 minutes , which M@@ our@@ in@@ ho admitted he had to improve before the start of the Premier League season . &quot;
&quot; he takes time , but his experience , intelligence , geni@@ us in the way he thinks - he thinks football , &quot; said M@@ our@@ in@@ ho . &quot;
we will help him to be ready earlier than later .
besides M@@ atic Victor Lind@@ el@@ of and Rom@@ el@@ u Lu@@ k@@ ak@@ u in the Avi@@ va Stadium as M@@ our@@ in@@ ho gave his start @-@ XI for the beginning of the season .
&quot; the Independent revealed that M@@ our@@ in@@ ho wanted three more new commitments , but insist@@ ed that the club had already made a &quot; fantastic job , &quot; three of its four priority new commitments . &quot;
&quot; three of four to get , thanks I to the club , &quot; he added . &quot;
&quot; I will be happ@@ ier if they get four out of four , but they have given great trouble . &quot;
Bo@@ eing &quot; paints &quot; Dream@@ liner in the sky
the U.S. aircraft manufacturer Bo@@ eing painted the sil@@ houette of a Dream@@ liner in the sky .
&quot; the pilots flew off from Seattle in the US state Washington , but the drawing started in Marqu@@ ette in U.S. state Michigan and moved to the USA , which are several thousand kilometres . &quot;
the action lasted 18 hours and one minute .
on the radar screens the form of a Dream@@ liner was to be .
the whole was a car@@ dio test for new engines .
Bo@@ eing had previously made such advertising .
&quot; thus , the number of &quot; 78@@ 7 &quot; and the Bo@@ eing logo was painted in the sky . &quot;
&quot; new civil strike for Martin Schulz - Hanover , we have a problem &quot;
&quot; as the wind turns out , as Sig@@ mar Gabriel was still the SPD leader , S &amp; D prime minister looked at the elections with a certain concern to Berlin . &quot;
&quot; only a bon@@ fire from the party centre , but no head@@ wind from the party , was the most important wish of the election fighters . &quot;
&quot; since Martin Schulz leads the party , this has changed fundamentally . &quot;
&quot; since then , the employees from the Willy @-@ Brandt @-@ Haus are watching the events in the SPD @-@ governed provincial capitals . &quot;
what Schulz has got from there since the beginning of the year would not be described with the head@@ wind in the approach .
there were civil charges .
and one after another .
&quot; following the surprising end of the red @-@ green majority in Lower Saxony , the federal CD@@ U sees a general signal against co@@ ali@@ tions of SPD and Gre@@ ens . &quot;
&quot; this shows once more : red @-@ green can simply not rule reliably , &quot; said CD@@ U Secretary General Peter Tau@@ ber the Editorial Network Germany ( R@@ ND ) . &quot;
the surprising fraction of a Green Party has over@@ thrown the government of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) into a serious crisis .
&quot; five months before the election , its red @-@ green coalition lost its one @-@ vote majority to the opposition from CD@@ U and F@@ DP . &quot;
the Green Federal Managing Director Michael Kell@@ ner has asked the Lower Saxony Gre@@ ens El@@ ke T@@ ests to return her mandate .
the transfer to the CD@@ U means a clear distortion of the vot@@ er &apos;s will .
&quot; El@@ ke T@@ west must immediately return her mandate , &quot; &quot; said the Federal Managing Director and election campaign of the Gre@@ ens to the Editorial Board Germany ( R@@ ND ) . &quot;
&quot; this must not be true , &quot; &quot; an SPD election champion si@@ gh@@ ed , when the new Job message reaches the party headquarters in the Friday morning . &quot;
&quot; Stephan Wei@@ l , SPD Prime Minister of Lower Saxony , stands after the adv@@ ent of the green parliam@@ ent@@ arians El@@ ke T@@ ests to the CD@@ U without their own government majority . &quot;
it is the provis@@ ional high point of a whole series of large and small crises in SPD national associations .
and no one knows what comes next .
the mis@@ ery began with the un@@ expect@@ edly clear defeat in the Saarland election in March .
&quot; a blue eye , more not , the comrades re@@ ass@@ ed at that time . &quot;
&quot; after the elections in Schleswig @-@ Holstein and North Rhine @-@ Westphalia , everything will be different . &quot;
it was then - and everything was much worse .
&quot; the defeat in Kiel brought the SPD in exchange , the Düsseldorf @-@ P@@ lei@@ te hau@@ led the party smoothly . &quot;
&quot; te@@ di@@ ous , the comrades ro@@ de in the weeks after that . &quot;
&quot; then , when they had just had new courage , the G @-@ 20 summit came from Hamburg . &quot;
and with him came the next low@@ stop .
&quot; Mayor Olaf Sch@@ olz , the last strong SPD Land@@ rush , lost his Nim@@ bus on that weekend because he sat in the El@@ b@@ phil@@ harmon@@ ie while his city was burning . &quot;
&quot; and because he did everything wrong in crisis communication , everything could be done wrong . &quot;
&quot; since then , Sch@@ olz has fought for his political survival . &quot;
now also Stephan Wei@@ l .
&quot; due to the VW exhaust gas and its role in the Supervisory Board , the Lower Saxony Prime Minister has been in criticism for a long time . &quot;
mi@@ ese poll@@ ut@@ ants were added .
&quot; nevertheless , or perhaps precisely why Wei@@ l increasingly attempted to set acc@@ ents in the past few weeks . &quot;
&quot; the aspir@@ ations of the former mayor of Hanover , to expand his power in Berlin , did not remain hidden in the environment of Martin Schulz . &quot;
they let him grant him as they promised a stabili@@ zation of the party by Wei@@ l .
&quot; now , the exact opposite could occur . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , Wei@@ l finds no fault in the party @-@ internal constra@@ int of the Lower Saxony green . &quot;
and Schulz was not at all .
&quot; at times , comrades endeav@@ our to keep their own ranks closed . &quot;
&quot; their anger is directed towards the Gre@@ ens , and here above all on the ab@@ u@@ sive Par@@ liam@@ ent@@ arians in the West . &quot;
&quot; it is unbe@@ ar@@ able and democratic , as Mrs T@@ west puts its own career interests over the interests of all others , &quot; says Matthias M@@ ier@@ sch , head of the party left in the SPD Par@@ liam@@ entary Group , the Editorial Network Germany ( R@@ ND ) . &quot;
&quot; not because of her person as direct candidate , but on the state list of the Lower Saxony Green Party , Ms. T@@ jackets has been elected to Parliament , so the Lower Saxony de@@ pu@@ ties continued . &quot;
the logical consequence would be that she returns her mandate .
&quot; Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , head of the SPD Par@@ liam@@ entary Group , compl@@ ains of an &quot; un@@ democratic man@@ eu@@ ver . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the vot@@ er wil@@ le four years ago was clear : men have made Stephan Wei@@ l to the Prime Minister , &quot; says Op@@ per@@ mann , who leads the Lower Saxony SPD as nick@@ name candidate into the Bundestag election , the R@@ ND . &quot;
&quot; now the personal career in a future CD@@ U de@@ pu@@ ties the election result , &quot; &quot; said Op@@ per@@ mann . &quot;
he asked to elu@@ ci@@ date the background .
I want to know if there has been more or has given further commitments to the CD@@ U Lower Saxony .
funding programme for local nucle@@ us III
those who want to be able to refurb@@ ish in the years can soon get support from the country .
&quot; in addition , the mayor Albert Sch@@ ind@@ ler and three representatives of ST@@ EG urban development informed on Wednesday in sen@@ sen@@ ess . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the informative event , Sch@@ ind@@ ler once again gave a look back to what happened so far . &quot;
since 1991 it has been in sen@@ sing areas .
&quot; back then , in the restructuring area I from 1991 to 2004 , the Land Baden @-@ Württemberg had taken over two @-@ thirds of the funding . &quot;
&quot; in the II from 2005 to 2016 , the supplement was still 60 percent . &quot;
&quot; for Sch@@ ind@@ ler , the existing renov@@ ations are a &quot; success project &quot; - it is ultimately important to promote internal development , and not only to develop new construction areas . &quot;
&quot; on April 4 , the government pres@@ idency of Karlsruhe has received the information that there will be a restructuring area III . &quot;
&quot; the sum of the sum total 8@@ 33 333 euros , of which 500 000 Euro came from the country , the rest from the church sensi@@ gen . &quot;
how is a remedi@@ ation area now created ?
&quot; one will continue to investigate , so Sch@@ ind@@ ler , where the &quot; really old &quot; houses are . &quot;
&quot; it also plays a role , whether in the planned area of interest . &quot;
&quot; if necessary , the regional boundaries could then also be postpon@@ ed again . &quot;
&quot; on Wednesday evening Martin Keller , Gab@@ y Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann and Sarah Got@@ zel . &quot;
&quot; Keller presented the contents of the Federal Government programme &quot; Social City , &quot; in which the renov@@ ations would then be carried out . &quot;
&quot; the core of the program is the re@@ vit@@ alization of inner cities , improving residential and working conditions and maintaining and expanding the infrastructure . &quot;
&quot; the measures would be object @-@ related , that means per plot . &quot;
the renovation would eventually be defined as a set of articles .
the approval period for the funding has been running until 30 April 2026 since 1 January 2017 .
&quot; until September this year , however , the survey will only be carried out , within the framework of those involved in the restructuring area to fill out a questionn@@ aire for filling out . &quot;
&quot; in November or December , the order of the Stat@@ utes shall be made possible , so that in the coming year it is possible to start with the renov@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; subsequently , Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann explained that each commun@@ e must carry out the forec@@ asted preliminary examinations . &quot;
&quot; it is a matter of evaluating the urban@@ istic mis@@ ses , and decide when it is rehabil@@ it@@ ated and to what extent . &quot;
for the respective property there is also a written note written in the basic book .
&quot; Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann will come again to sensi@@ bly and make a picture of the situation , she promised . &quot;
&quot; Got@@ zel stressed , a key success factor for the project is the cooperation of the participants . &quot;
this is why questionn@@ aires will be sent to the citizens in the coming weeks and can be filled up until the end of the summer holidays .
&quot; the yellow questionn@@ aire is the &quot; &quot; building and land sheet &quot; , &quot; where it is among other things about the structural condition and the remedi@@ ation views . &quot;
&quot; in the grey questionn@@ aire , the &quot; household and housing sheet , &quot; information on size , division and room@@ mates can be made of a living room . &quot;
the blue &quot; factory arch &quot; can only be filled when operating in the building premises .
&quot; however , to note , Got@@ zel pointed out that a filling questionn@@ aire is not at the same time an application for funding . &quot;
&quot; moreover , new construction measures are not eligible . &quot;
&quot; Sch@@ ind@@ ler still stressed that the distribution of the funding for the &quot; &quot; gre@@ y@@ ho@@ und principle &quot; &quot; function - who comes first , first ex@@ h@@ ort . &quot;
&quot; you can not reserve funds for later . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; finally , photos of the project &quot; local nucle@@ us II &quot; were shown to make the present a &quot; &quot; tasty &quot; &quot; renovation . &quot;
British invent@@ or puts himself a micro@@ chip to come into house and car with a hand movement
&quot; a British invent@@ or is the first in the country equipped with a micro@@ chip to open his door , enter his office and even start his car with a hand movement . &quot;
&quot; Steven North@@ am , 33 , had im@@ planted the tiny chip between thumb and foref@@ inger and now offers the service for companies and individuals who want to simplify their lives with technology through his company Bio@@ Te@@ q . &quot;
&quot; he joined the Royal Hamp@@ shire County Hospital in Win@@ chester , H@@ ants , with Dr. Ge@@ off Wat@@ son , to ensure that the impl@@ ant procedure is performed according to medical standards . &quot;
the technology resem@@ bles a cat and dogs impl@@ ant micro@@ chip and takes only 30 seconds .
&quot; the company of Mr. North@@ am also wants to change locks on houses and cars so that they are compatible with the chip , all for a surcharge of £ 300 per lock . &quot;
the married father of one has now installed both at home and at his BMW Z@@ 4 technology that begins when his hand is at the wheel .
the cost of the White House cost the tax@@ pay@@ ers thousands
&quot; the White House &apos;s decision to fly a nav@@ al helicop@@ ter to the South La@@ wn for an event , which under@@ takes the American production last month , costs tax@@ pay@@ ers according to the military service provided by the TIME magazine up to 24@@ ,000 US dollars . &quot;
&quot; the green @-@ white Si@@ kor@@ sky V@@ H @-@ 3D , known as Marine One , when the president is on board , was the cent@@ er@@ piece of the event on 17 July in the White House with American construction programs . &quot;
&quot; President Donald Tru@@ mp , Vice President Mike P@@ ence and senior officials of the White House made a tour of products from all 50 countries . &quot;
&quot; helicop@@ ter is made in Connec@@ tic@@ ut , next to a yacht from Ma@@ ine , a fire fighter car from Wis@@ cons@@ in and a forkli@@ ft truck from Miss@@ issi@@ ppi . &quot;
&quot; the military office of the White House requested the presence of the helicop@@ ter in a frag@@ mentary order or Fr@@ ago , barely 36 hours before the helicop@@ ter landed at the South La@@ wn , according to the records of the Marine Hel@@ icop@@ ter S@@ quad@@ ron One ( H@@ MX @-@ 1 ) , the unit responsible for the operation of the helicop@@ ter . &quot;
&quot; I just wanted you to be aware of it because it is such an unusual event with high visibility , &quot; wrote the commander of the H@@ MX @-@ 1 on the eve of the event of his superi@@ ors , the dep@@ uty marin@@ ek@@ om@@ man@@ de@@ ur for aviation . &quot;
the message showed that the helicop@@ ter arrived at the South La@@ wn on July 17 at 7 o &apos;clock in the morning and so long until the tur@@ f was cleared between 18 : 00 and 21 : 00 on this evening .
the note adds that if the departure from the White House should be delayed due to the limitation of the service hours a second crew would be required for return flight .
&quot; the original flight crew was at the helicop@@ ter during the event , while the security personnel of the unit remained on the ground during the time on the plane . &quot;
&quot; from the records provided by the TIME , it was not clear whether a second flight was required . &quot;
the H@@ atch Act prohi@@ bits federal state property for political purposes .
records indicate that H@@ MX @-@ 1 asked if the event could hurt the destiny .
&quot; a question we asked was whether it was a violation of the H@@ atch acts and we were informed that this was not the case , &quot; &quot; wrote the commander . &quot;
&quot; sounds as if you are locked , &quot; the dep@@ uty commander answered . &quot;
the &quot; Made in America &quot; event was designated by the White House as an official event and would not be covered by the H@@ atch Act .
but official events also have political over@@ tones .
&quot; at the event , the president gave an impulse for the reform of the health reform , which was in progress in the Senate , and he propag@@ ated efforts to cur@@ b government regulations . &quot;
&quot; the use of the aircraft , known as Marine One or Air Force One , is hardly a new phenomenon . &quot;
pres@@ idents are obliged to use them for travel .
&quot; but to request their use only for a photo operation , is unusual . &quot;
&quot; in February , Tru@@ mp conducted an investigation when the presidential jet was in front of the backdrop of his first campaign r@@ all@@ ye in Melbourne , Florida , taxi services , and his Twitter account is full of messages describing the use of the presidential jet through its predec@@ essors . &quot;
&quot; the White House is enthusiastic about the show &quot; &quot; Made In America &quot; &quot; - the products from all 50 countries that are produced by American workers with American materials , &quot; said the Assistant Secretary of the White House , Lind@@ say Wal@@ ters . &quot;
H@@ MX @-@ 1 cre@@ ws often lead training flights to Washington and South La@@ wn to expose the US president in the White House with precise centimet@@ res .
&quot; when Tru@@ mp was in Germany at the G@@ 20 summit in Germany at the beginning of July , H@@ MX @-@ 1 led the White House 58 exercise land@@ ings . &quot;
&quot; the flight for the &quot; &quot; Made in America &quot; &quot; event counted for the training needs of the flight crew for the month , said a civil servant . &quot;
helicop@@ ter units also flew 11 hours this day for &quot; non @-@ presidential support missions . &quot;
the White House said that tax@@ pay@@ ers over@@ took the burden of none of the other pro@@ ps presented at the event .
&quot; a spokes@@ man of Si@@ kor@@ sky said , the company was not involved to exhibit the helicop@@ ter on the South La@@ wn . &quot;
&quot; H@@ MX @-@ 1 does not support budget desig@@ nations for the presidential flights , and it is difficult to determine the exact costs for the event . &quot;
&quot; according to the U.S. Department of Defense for the fiscal year 2017 , the Do@@ D refund set for the V@@ H @-@ 3D is 24.@@ 380 USD per flight hour . &quot;
records of the unit list the flight time of the aircraft as 30 minutes from the home base of Marine Cor@@ ps Air Fac@@ ility in Qu@@ an@@ tico in Virginia .
the White House ar@@ gues that the actual cost of operation of the helicop@@ ter is far below this rate .
&quot; the cost of tax@@ pay@@ ers based on estimates for refund rates is most mis@@ leading , &quot; said Wal@@ ters . &quot;
&quot; these estimates include staff , maintenance and many other hidden costs included in the annual funding . &quot;
&quot; according to an R@@ AND study from 2015 , the refund rates for Do@@ D do not include personnel costs , but also take into account the cost of fuel , maintenance and conclusion of the contract . &quot;
&quot; at that time , the former press spokes@@ man of the White House , Se@@ an Sp@@ ic@@ er , def@@ ended the use of the helicop@@ ter for the event . &quot;
&quot; the idea is to present things that week are produced in America , &quot; said Sp@@ ic@@ er . &quot;
&quot; and I know Si@@ kor@@ sky and the state of Connec@@ tic@@ ut are very proud that they contribute to our national security , and I assume that hundreds , if not even thousands of people depend on it . &quot;
and I think like most Americans we are all proud of the helicop@@ ter and other military equipment for which so many Americans have worked ti@@ rel@@ ess@@ ly .
of course it is appropriate to emphasize that .
&quot; it was not clear whether Tru@@ mp was inter@@ acting with the helicop@@ ter , when he entered his tour over the South La@@ wn for the event , but he sat in the driver &apos;s seat of a fire Brig@@ ade . &quot;
&quot; in the White House , Tru@@ mp spoke to representatives of Si@@ kor@@ sky and spread with the media about his own fleet of company products . &quot;
&quot; I know Si@@ kor@@ sky very well , &quot; said the president , &quot; I have three of them . &quot;
TC BW Ne@@ uss a tri@@ cky task
leader of the Second Tennis Bundes@@ liga joins the Table 3 Su@@ chs@@ dorfer SV .
the TC Blue @-@ White Ne@@ uss will start tomorrow from 11 o &apos;clock in Kiel at the Table 3 Su@@ chs@@ dorfer SV .
&quot; in spite of five games still flaw@@ less balance , the top rider of the Second Tennis Bundes@@ liga gained the sense of reality . &quot;
team Princip@@ al Mari@@ us Z@@ ay has respect for the opponent .
this is a compact team that always plays in quite similar formation .
&quot; just on the post@@ erior position , I find the team very well . &quot;
&quot; for class and stability at the Su@@ chs@@ dorfer SV , the imports from the high North are concerned . &quot;
&quot; their Dan@@ es and Finn@@ s can even refer to stak@@ es in the Davis Cup .
&quot; and they are also strong in the double , &quot; says Z@@ ay with a view of Har@@ ri Hel@@ i@@ ova@@ ara ( Finland ) , Andr@@ e Gö@@ ran@@ sson ( Sweden ) , S@@ ör@@ en and Es@@ ben O@@ lesen , Martin Pe@@ der@@ sen and Andreas B@@ jer@@ reh@@ us ( all Denmark ) . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this will be difficult for us . &quot;
you also need a good portion of luck . &quot;
the Ne@@ uss@@ er team for the trip to the high north is practical .
his debut for Blue @-@ White could give Maxim@@ e Jan@@ vier .
&quot; at the moment the Chall@@ enger tournament in Italian Bi@@ ella does not create an active Fr@@ ench@@ man for the Bundes@@ liga @-@ game , the Z@@ den@@ ek Kol@@ ar ( Czech Republic ) will play at the tournament in the Czech Liber@@ ec . &quot;
the previously un@@ conquered Chil@@ ene Hans Pod@@ lip@@ nik @-@ Cas@@ tillo was yesterday with the Weiß@@ russ@@ sen An@@ drei V@@ asi@@ lev@@ ski still at the AT@@ P tournament in K@@ itz@@ büh@@ el on the ball .
&quot; but in Kiel he should be like Bot@@ ic Van de Z@@ and@@ schul@@ p , Niel@@ s Lo@@ ot@@ sm@@ a ( both the Netherlands ) and the Belgian Ju@@ lien C@@ agn@@ ina . &quot;
&quot; after his two vic@@ tories last Sunday at the Al@@ ster , Má@@ t@@ é Val@@ kus@@ z could again move into the team . &quot;
&quot; it is enough for the 18 @-@ year @-@ old Hung@@ arians , who was the number one of the Junior World Ran@@ king in January 2016 , does not fill someone out of the trainer by Mari@@ us Z@@ ay the cad@@ re . &quot;
how America can harm O@@ MV
Donald Tru@@ mp did not really happy when he set his signature on Wednesday evening under the law to tigh@@ ten sanctions against Russia .
&quot; in his ha@@ ste to make the law , the Congress pic@@ ks a few &quot; un@@ constitutional provisions . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Moscow &apos;s reaction was as sharp as expected , and even Brussels fo@@ amed the US advance . &quot;
&quot; after all , the draft plans to pun@@ ish European companies that help the Russians to build gas pi@@ pel@@ ines in the EU . &quot;
&quot; since then , investors in the domestic O@@ MV , which together with other European companies , have co @-@ financed the construction of the Russian Baltic Sea Association North Stream 2 . &quot;
the Dro@@ h@@ kul@@ isse is huge .
&quot; nevertheless , it was too early for an estim@@ ation of the consequences , so the official statement of the oil group . &quot;
&quot; in fact , Donald Tru@@ mp himself would have to raise the sanctions even by executive order . &quot;
twelve weapons are available to him .
&quot; the press &quot; has looked at what the Group could rep@@ el , and which could really hurt him . &quot;
Nar@@ cos Season 3 Trailer : without Pablo Es@@ co@@ bar the Cal@@ i Cart@@ el is placed in the center of Net@@ fli@@ x in the spotlight
&quot; despite the second season of Nar@@ cos , the Pablo Es@@ co@@ bar Killer revealed , the series of Net@@ fli@@ x is not yet over . &quot;
&quot; the relay three and four were already confirmed by streaming service , the first received their first trailer and showed the latest em@@ bl@@ ems of the show . &quot;
&quot; with the third season , DE@@ A has focused their attention on the rich@@ est organization of the drug trade in the world : the Cal@@ i Kart@@ ell . &quot;
&quot; led by four powerful god@@ parents , they operate &quot; like a Fort@@ une 500 company , &quot; only with more government uph@@ e@@ av@@ als and violent actions . &quot;
&quot; Gil@@ berto Rodri@@ gu@@ ez O@@ re@@ ju@@ ela ( Dam@@ ian Al@@ c@@ azar ) is the leader of the Kart@@ ell , Miguel Rodri@@ gu@@ ez O@@ re@@ ju@@ ela ( Francisco Denis ) , is their head , P@@ ach@@ o Herr@@ era ( Alberto Am@@ mann ) , and Ch@@ ep@@ e Sant@@ ac@@ ru@@ z London@@ o ( Pep@@ e Rap@@ az@@ ote ) is located in New York . &quot;
&quot; in the newly released trailer , Pedro Pascal returns to J@@ avier Pe@@ ña , the type , the American and Colom@@ bian law enforcement authorities to support the war against drugs . &quot;
&quot; other new actors are M@@ ati@@ as Var@@ ela , Michael Stahl @-@ David , Matt W@@ hel@@ an , Miguel Angel Silv@@ est@@ re , Kerry To@@ he and Ar@@ tur@@ o Castro . &quot;

roll back@@ wards : the city provides 46 kitchen aids
the city organis@@ es the K@@ ita lunch table again .
with fixed contact partners for the children and an assignment to the team .
in the urban day@@ care centres the clock is turned back .
&quot; on September 1 , the city of Kre@@ feld takes over the supply of food in the urban day@@ care facilities ( Kit@@ as ) . &quot;
&quot; for Son@@ ja Pom@@ mer@@ anz , dep@@ uty director in the Department of Youth Aid , this is a good news : &quot; we were all very pleased . &quot;
bo@@ iled continues to be out of house : a cat@@ erer takes care of this task and supplies fresh and cooled refriger@@ ated .
&quot; the town operates in the Kre@@ felder region 46 children &apos;s day , in 44 the children get a hot meal at lunch time . &quot;
&quot; last year , 2800 children were sitting at the tables , and the need grows constantly . &quot;
&quot; in the meantime , not only children who are cared for 45 hours of week in the K@@ ita , explains Pom@@ mer@@ anz . &quot;
the offer also applies in the 35 @-@ hour care when children stay until 14 o &apos;clock .
&quot; 46 part @-@ time forces will have kitchen service from 1 September : they warm up the lo@@ wered food , supplement them to salad , raw food and fruit , por@@ tioning the meal individually , give the food out , clean rooms , rin@@ se and clean the kitchen . &quot;
&quot; the workers are firmly assigned to a K@@ ita , &quot; says Pom@@ mer@@ anz . &quot;
the size - there are two groups as well as seven @-@ group institutions - decides on the circum@@ ference .
&quot; the chefs now belong to the K@@ ita team , &quot; says Pom@@ mer@@ ance satisfied . &quot;
&quot; so they are much stronger , and it is easier for kit@@ esur@@ fing to implement ped@@ agog@@ ical concepts . &quot;
it is also about healthy eating and cooking lessons .
the children are supposed to help prepare the food .
the direct connection of the kitchen power to the team is useful .
also for the children .
&quot; they have a known force in the K@@ ita , a person familiar to them , and not constantly changing people . &quot;
this continuity is important for children .
the cleaning of the K@@ ita rooms - until now also the function of the kitchen forces - is done by special cleaning personnel in the future .
&quot; this variant - the separation of cleaning and kitchen service - besides the quality improvement of the kitchen performance , has also the charm that it has shown in the cost comparison between self @-@ governance and foreign allocation for the city as the most economical issue , it is called from the press office . &quot;
&quot; and that , although 46 part @-@ time forces are rest@@ art@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; but these hours are not so strong at all about 750 people in the education sector , &quot; says Son@@ ja Pom@@ mer@@ anz . &quot;
Afgh@@ an democracy depends on the political role of women says the UN
&quot; elections can only be representative if all members of society , including women , play a role , said the chief of the UN mission in Afghanistan on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; Nicholas Hay@@ som , director of the United Nations Mission , said that hundreds of women in the council elections are chann@@ elled into the provinces . three women are candidates for the role of vice @-@ president and more than 30 percent of the newly registered vot@@ ers are women . &quot;
&quot; the role of women cannot be over@@ estimated , &quot; &quot; he said on Wednesday in a statement . &quot;
elections can only be really representative and credi@@ ble if women participate fully and are included in all parts of the choice process .
Afgh@@ an elections for the provincial council and the presidential elections take place on April 5th .
Taliban has published threats against a choice process that coinci@@ des with the transition from international mar@@ tial arts to an advisory role .
&quot; this year , the elections for the first time will hand over the power peac@@ efully from a democr@@ atically elected government to the next . &quot;
&quot; Hay@@ som said , a strong role for women will strengthen Afghanistan &apos;s democratic success . &quot;
the Afgh@@ an independent elec@@ toral Commission reports that 1.2 million women of total registered 3.6 million vot@@ ers are registered .

G@@ MB concern about investments in the Mc@@ Vi@@ tie @-@ Fabrik in Glasgow
&quot; with managers of the Bis@@ ku@@ it manufacturer Mc@@ Vi@@ tie , a union would like to make sure they have a long @-@ term commitment to production at their plant in Glasgow . &quot;
G@@ MB Scotland said that the company kept silent about the future of investments at the T@@ oll@@ cross site .
&quot; more than 500 employees work in the plant , which in addition to other products hob@@ no@@ bs and rich tea bis@@ cu@@ its . &quot;
&quot; Mc@@ Vi@@ ties owner Pla@@ dis said , he invested more than 5 million pounds in recent years . &quot;
&quot; he added that employees and trade union representatives were &quot; &quot; first experienced &quot; &quot; if their activities would change . &quot;
&quot; in a letter to the company leader of the company , G@@ MB Scotland Mc@@ Vi@@ tie &apos;s insist@@ ed on &quot; concerns that financing for the modernis@@ ation of production lines is not advanced . &quot;
&quot; G@@ MB @-@ Senior @-@ Organiz@@ er Dre@@ w Du@@ ffy , said : &quot; &quot; the fact that we cannot gain clarity about business needs and investment plans for the future of T@@ oll@@ cross , our members are deeply concerned . &quot;
&quot; generations of families have worked here and the workers focus strongly on the local community and the Greater Glasgow , an important pillar for decent jobs in an area with high unemployment and social dis@@ advantage . &quot;
&quot; hence , under the perspective of jobs , wages and well @-@ being , and in the background of the Bre@@ x@@ it , the rising cost of living and the chronic volume of production , the Eastern end of Glasgow urg@@ ently needed a flour@@ ishing production presence at Mc@@ Vi@@ tie . &quot;
&quot; a spokes@@ woman of Pla@@ dis said : &quot; &quot; the branch manager at T@@ oll@@ cross received a letter from G@@ MB Scotland yesterday , and the company will respond directly to it since we appreciate the continuous commitment to employees and trade union representatives . &quot;
&quot; two months ago , we had a regular meeting with employees and G@@ MB representatives at T@@ oll@@ cross , where some questions were openly discussed . &quot;
&quot; we discussed with the employees that we like all companies operating in a highly competitive and uns@@ af@@ e economic climate , keep our business continuously checked - and this applies to all our business units and locations - to remain competitive . &quot;
&quot; she added : &quot; in recent years , we invested more than 5 million pounds in our T@@ oll@@ cross location , especially in production lines and operational improvements . &quot;
&quot; we recognize the legacy of T@@ oll@@ cross as a production site . if our operations at the site change , employees and their union representatives will be the first to experience this . &quot;
did the PSG warn Barcelona three years ago in front of N@@ ey@@ mar ?
the page of La Liga may be interested in Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti
&quot; Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main will not aband@@ on N@@ ey@@ mar after having issued an offer of £ 189 million to dis@@ solve its exemp@@ tion clause , but have they warned Barcelona three years ago before the invasion of the world ? &quot;
&quot; the sens@@ ational approach has heated the transfer window in summer , because the Lig@@ ue 1 club is ready to break the world record by more than double the previous brand , with Paul Pog@@ ba returned to Manchester United in the last season for 89 million pounds . &quot;
&quot; after the end , N@@ ey@@ mar becomes the most expensive player in the world and the highest paid professional athletes in the world . PSG offers wages of more than 500,000 GBP per week . &quot;
&quot; Barcelona is fur@@ ious over the way N@@ ey@@ mar imposed its way out , although a source near the Catal@@ ans Board insist@@ ed that the club has always been his best to take care of him since his arrival from San@@ tos in 2013 . &quot;
but the football world was warned three years ago by the PSG pres@@ idency before this prospect ?
&quot; as Manchester City 2014 attracted interest in the signing of Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i , N@@ asser Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi had a strict warning for every club that wanted to sign one of the best players of PSG . &quot;
&quot; I am not worried because they know that when they touch one of our players , then we will be in opposition to them , we will contact their players , &quot; said Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi . &quot;
&quot; we respect all clubs .
&quot; but if they try to sign one of our players at their own , this will have consequences . &quot;
&quot; Barcelona seems to have crossed this line , with the Spanish club at the beginning of this summer &apos;s interest in the PSG medium @-@ field player Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti . &quot;
&quot; PSG clearly made that it would not allow the International from Italy to leave under any circumstances , and Barcelona could feel the consequences of this interest by losing one of its price offerings for N@@ ey@@ mar . &quot;

&quot; because a car came to meet him in his lane , the driver of a VW Tour@@ an had to switch off and touched the guide plan . &quot;
on Thursday evening the 34 @-@ year @-@ old from Reh@@ burg @-@ Lo@@ cc@@ um was on the B 215 from Stol@@ zen@@ au with his VW from Stol@@ zen@@ au in the direction of Le@@ ese .
&quot; in the area of the vicinity of Stol@@ zen@@ au , a passenger car came to meet him on his track , so that he had to turn right . &quot;
the Tour@@ an driver touched the guide plan .
at the passenger car there was a damage .
&quot; the driver of the coming car , a Mercedes Benz , had over@@ hau@@ led a truck and continued his journey without taking care of the traffic accident . &quot;
&quot; according to the accident , it may be good that the mer@@ ced@@ es@@ driver had not noticed the accident at all . &quot;

interview : &quot; Dom@@ sp@@ atzen report reli@@ eves Pope @-@ brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger &quot;
the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen report on the abuse cases reli@@ eves the Pope @-@ brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
this means author and historian Michael Hes@@ emann .
the final report on the abuse andal at the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen continues for discussions .
&quot; Christian Wei@@ sn@@ der , spokes@@ man of the reform movement &quot; We are Church , &quot; stated after publication in relation to the German press agency , he expect from the former Reg@@ ens@@ burger Bishop and today Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller , the 93 @-@ year @-@ old brother of the em@@ eri@@ fied Pope Bene@@ dict XVI , an exc@@ use . &quot;
it would serve to the reputation of the Catholic Church when Müller and R@@ atz@@ inger would express their deep regret about their own om@@ is@@ sions or their then false appreciation of the processes .
&quot; the Vatican Secretary &quot; Os@@ serv@@ atore Rom@@ ano , &quot; on the other hand , cri@@ tici@@ zed that during the reporting of violence at the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen with &quot; two measures . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in regard to the attacks in Regensburg , no one doubt that it is &quot; sham@@ eful and sham@@ eful deeds , &quot; which would have to be pun@@ ish@@ able and prevented in the future ; but the author Luc@@ etta Scar@@ aff@@ ia , historian and member of the national Italian Bio@@ ethics committee . &quot;
&quot; the habit of design@@ ating the Catholic Church as a source of all evil , is already part of everyday experience and prepar@@ es public opinion to keep it normal , &quot; says Scar@@ aff@@ ia . &quot;
&quot; also Princess Gl@@ oria of Th@@ urn und Tax@@ is said in an interview with Bay@@ er@@ ischer Rund@@ funk ( Bay@@ er@@ ischer Rund@@ funk ) : &quot; we are happy to go to the church , and this is a found fres@@ co@@ es . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , she pointed out that in her youth &quot; blow@@ s had been a very normal ped@@ agog@@ ical means &quot; &quot; to cope with che@@ ek@@ y children , as I was one . &quot;
&quot; it would be un@@ fair to apply today &apos;s standards for earlier decades , as the world has changed . &quot;
&quot; in connection with the reports on the abuse inci@@ dents , pop@@ e @-@ brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger often appeared . &quot;
&quot; completely wron@@ g@@ ly , author and historian Michael Hes@@ emann , who wrote the commemor@@ ative book &quot; My Brother of the Pope &quot; with R@@ atz@@ inger ( translated into 12 languages ) . &quot;
&quot; I have to take care of Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , &quot; &quot; says Hes@@ man , &quot; &quot; for all this had nothing to do with him , &quot; &quot; he evalu@@ ates the results of the final report . &quot;
what exactly stands in the 440 @-@ page report submitted by the dioc@@ ese Regensburg with the En@@ ligh@@ tenment commission@@ er Ulrich Weber ?
&quot; a total of 547 &quot; &quot; Dom@@ sp@@ atzen &quot; &quot; from 1945 to the beginning of the 1990s &quot; &quot; with high plau@@ sibility &quot; &quot; victims of over@@ took , 67 Dom@@ sp@@ atzen sex@@ ually ab@@ used . &quot;
&quot; in the final report , it is said to Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , who was active in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994 : &quot; in summary , the fact that Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister R. was used in many cases forms of physical and psychological violence . &quot;
&quot; especially with high emotion@@ ality , the punishment for the students was also able to turn out more fier@@ c@@ ely . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , in contrast to numerous other accused , many victims are estimated to respect the general humanity of R. and therefore in numerous cases , despite violence , even positive memories are connected with him . &quot;
&quot; in the interview , Hes@@ emann explains why the final report on the mis@@ use sc@@ andal at the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen Georg R@@ atz@@ inger was reli@@ eved . &quot;
&quot; Mr Hes@@ emann , the 440 @-@ page report on the &quot; inci@@ dents of violence in violence against the &quot; &quot; Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen &quot; &quot; are a contradic@@ tory picture of Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger . &quot;
&quot; for one , many students raise their &quot; humanity . &quot; &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , it also appears as chol@@ eri@@ ker and perfec@@ tion@@ ist , which became more handy when a Dom@@ sp@@ atz has no top performance . &quot;
how do you evaluate this final report as his bio@@ grapher ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : if you take the trouble and read the whole 440 pages long report from the front to the back , you have to ask yourself more , why the name Georg R@@ atz@@ inger actually occurs in it . &quot;
&quot; there are just eight pages dedicated to him , and he is clearly shared by any suspic@@ ion of complic@@ ity or compassion in the terrible cases of sexual abuse . &quot;
even the violent exc@@ esses at the pre @-@ school occurred outside his sphere of influence .
&quot; it is possible to repro@@ ach him , of which too late or first indications are not taken seriously enough . &quot;
&quot; the Dom@@ sp@@ atz@@ eng@@ y@@ mn@@ asi@@ um , on which he worked , was perceived as &quot; salvation , &quot; &quot; heaven , &quot; and &quot; better world . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the vast majority of his students Georg R@@ atz@@ inger also presents an excellent testimony , &quot; &quot; sincere , &quot; &quot; competent , &quot; &quot; competent &quot; , &quot; &quot; competent &quot; and &quot; comprehen@@ sible , &quot; as extremely good @-@ nat@@ ured teachers , who supplied the boys regularly with cakes , bis@@ cu@@ its and bon@@ b@@ ons and &quot; always surrounded by the grapes of children . &quot; &quot;
&quot; only a minority compl@@ ains about his perfec@@ tion@@ ism and his high emotion@@ ality , which also sometimes led to wound breaks . &quot;
&quot; the fact that he did not only kne@@ el with chairs and threw the kis@@ ses on the ground , but also distributed men &apos;s hor@@ ses@@ ho@@ e and too nau@@ gh@@ ty guys on the hair or ears , he has already given him years ago , deeply regre@@ t@@ ted and ap@@ ologi@@ zed for it . &quot;
&quot; however , to his salvation , however , it has to be said that such educational methods were widespread in the question@@ able period , the 1960s and 1970s , in both parents and teachers . &quot;
do you also know such breeding methods ?
&quot; of course , I think each of us who was born before 1968 . &quot;
&quot; I also experienced this in a secular school , a state secondary school . &quot;
&quot; compared to what is actually happening in this report , namely the horri@@ ble sexual abuse and violent exc@@ esses at the pre @-@ school , it is certainly dig@@ at@@ elles . &quot;
&quot; one wonders , whether it is not more familiar with his fame and role as a brother of Bene@@ dict XVI , that many media have just crashed on him . &quot;
&quot; at the Bavarian pop@@ e , many who have never understood him are still ze@@ al@@ ous . &quot;
but the truth is : the report reli@@ eves Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in every respect !
&quot; in the media , in connection with the report , there was a lot about the issue of abuse on the case of the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen . &quot;
is Georg R@@ atz@@ inger placed in the final report any wr@@ apping or sympathy for sexual abuse on the load ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : very clearly no .
no one of the 67 victims of sexual assault claims to become familiar with the Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister .
not even the parents were consec@@ rated .
&quot; I never dar@@ ed to talk to my father or mother about it , &quot; &quot; said a concern for the others , &quot; &quot; It was all very embarrass@@ ing for me . &quot;
&quot; the true issue in the education of sexual abuse , however , is that most victims are silent . &quot;
&quot; if they weren &apos;t even familiar with parents and si@@ bl@@ ings , certainly not a choir director , who would have been a colleague of the perpet@@ rators professionally . &quot;
how do the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen @-@ students R@@ atz@@ inger &apos;s role in regard to abuse inci@@ dents ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : a ques@@ tioned student formulated it in such a way : &quot; regarding sexual abuse ... I see ... not a case in which he would have had timely knowledge and could have stopped the respective perpet@@ r@@ ator .
&quot; I think it ... even for really absurd to assume that ... Bu@@ ben are more intru@@ sive or clear@@ er or more likely to have opened than against their parents , dormit@@ ory leaders , trust teachers , etc . &quot;
that you talk to him about sex ... un@@ think@@ able . &quot;
&quot; in this way , the report conclu@@ des with the very clear result : &quot; that the students and / or their surroundings were entrusted to him in advance , could not be confirmed in the context of the investigation . &quot;
&quot; as for sexual abuse , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is thus exemp@@ t from any co @-@ existence . &quot;
&quot; thus , it cannot be accused of being prevented or brought to the display . &quot;
&quot; therefore , there is no reason to associate his good name with these contradic@@ tory crimes , as unfortunately in some cases . &quot;
&quot; in the media , a lot of &quot; non @-@ violence &quot; was to be read at the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen . &quot;
the former Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is disc@@ ar@@ ded in the report &quot; Weg@@ müller . &quot;
does he have to live with this accus@@ ation ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : this is the big problem that in the reporting everything is mixed and ming@@ led to a huge mel@@ ange of sexual abuse and violence and somewhere , right in the middle , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger . &quot;
but that is exactly what is mis@@ use of the report .
&quot; in fact , there will be clean@@ ly separated : between the pre @-@ school and the gymn@@ asi@@ um of the dom@@ ic@@ ile , between sexual abuse and violence , we say once , other alleg@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the report covers cases from the time since 1945 , thus also from four decades in which Georg R@@ atz@@ inger was not ch@@ oral conductors of the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen . &quot;
&quot; all the terrible test ped@@ agog@@ y , the cases where boys of sa@@ di@@ stic teachers were arbit@@ rar@@ ily lay@@ ered and painted , all at the pre @-@ school in Et@@ ter@@ z@@ hausen and P@@ iel@@ en@@ hofen where really sc@@ andal@@ ous states must have reigned . &quot;
&quot; but with those Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger had nothing to do , for he only got his face when she had already been on the Dom@@ sp@@ atz@@ eng@@ y@@ mn@@ asi@@ um . &quot;
&quot; on that , as most witnesses emphas@@ ise , the subject of &quot; Preschool &quot; tab@@ oo . &quot;
one was only happy to be escaped and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even &quot; heavenly &quot; states .
what was different on the Dom@@ sp@@ atz@@ eng@@ y@@ mn@@ asi@@ um ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : there was discipline , but no sa@@ di@@ stic violence . &quot;
&quot; and this also applies to Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , in which the report conclu@@ des that &quot; many victims are estim@@ ating the general humanity of R. and therefore in numerous cases , despite violence , even positive memories with him . &quot;
&quot; at most , it remains the repro@@ ach to have taken away . &quot;
&quot; however , despite all efforts , the report was able to define only two periods where it was reported by the states at the pre @-@ school . &quot;
&quot; the first time 1970 / 71 , when he began to establish himself and from the previous ones at a school where he was not working and responsible , ( so the witness ) didn &apos;t want to hear anything , and then again around 1993 . &quot;
does Georg R@@ atz@@ inger consistently swal@@ low the ears ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : no , because in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the Dom@@ sp@@ atz@@ eng@@ y@@ mn@@ asi@@ um , which the report was even reproduced . &quot;
&quot; in this , he points out that in the pre @-@ school the test penalty will continue to be practi@@ sed . &quot;
&quot; in view of the danger of negative press publi@@ city , it recommended urgent action . &quot;
&quot; this was of course at a time when legal clarity existed , as exam@@ in@@ ers had long been banned in Bavaria . &quot;
&quot; before that , they occurred in a legal grey area , as each one of us knows yet . &quot;
&quot; it was difficult for him to estimate , where those affected might exagger@@ ate or dram@@ ati@@ zed , and where really the permitted limit was exceeded . &quot;
but you can &apos;t say that he has always looked away .
this is just right .
&quot; only in 1980 , the test was officially abol@@ ished at schools in Bavaria . &quot;
&quot; Prince Gl@@ oria of Th@@ urn und Tax@@ is said yes , it was un@@ fair to apply today &apos;s ped@@ agog@@ ical standards to the time of time . &quot;
how do you see that ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : we histori@@ ans talk about the &quot; &quot; pit@@ falls of an@@ ach@@ ron@@ ism &quot; , &quot; i.e. the danger of evaluating the past of today &apos;s moral standards . &quot;
08.@@ 11.2015 &#124; Des@@ perate Housewives
&quot; but that of course does not apply to sexual abuse , which was abom@@ in@@ able at all times and also not for what was banned in the pre @-@ school of resistance and violence against innocent children &apos;s souls , that goes far beyond that . &quot;
this is all horri@@ ble and I am glad that it is finally re@@ worked .
&quot; but at the same time I have to take care of Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , because all this had nothing to do with him . &quot;
&quot; his means for discipl@@ ining and punishment , so to draw ear @-@ hor@@ ses@@ ho@@ e and hair and ears , were widespread in the 1970s . &quot;
&quot; when physical punishment was then forbidden , he has kept strictly adher@@ ed to it . &quot;
&quot; which picture of his Regensburg time has Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , for in the talks with you for the book &quot; My Brother of the Pope &quot; ? &quot;
did the subject of Ch@@ ecks sentence also come to the language ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : well , in the book it is about the life of his brother Joseph , so pop@@ e Bene@@ dict XVI , tells from his perspective , as the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen played only one side role . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , I was by no means w@@ aged that he led a rig@@ orous reg@@ iment there . &quot;
&quot; but even that must be said once : without this perfec@@ tion@@ ism , without the demands of un@@ conditional discipline , it would hardly have been possible for him to form an institution of world @-@ tran@@ s , true cultural amb@@ ass@@ ad@@ ors of Europe and his musical tradition , which went on tour twice in the USA ( 1983 and 1987 ) and Japan ( 1988 and 1991 ) . &quot;
&quot; with bis@@ cu@@ its and Bon@@ b@@ ons alone , you do not have a big voc@@ alist and any success , regardless of what area , but always discipline , passion and self @-@ winter@@ ness . &quot;
what kind of man did you experience Georg R@@ atz@@ inger during the talks about her book ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : through the work on the book and in addition , I experienced Georg R@@ atz@@ inger really well and again as wonderful , hum@@ orous , fundamental , deep faith and heart @-@ good people , from which one cannot imagine that he could only do something to do with a fly . &quot;
&quot; I get regularly with how many former dom@@ ic@@ iles still keep contact with him today , 23 years after his arrest , visit him , read him - he is almost blind and treat him like a member of her family . &quot;
&quot; those who do not forgive him to this day , that he once was strictly to them , are clearly in the minority . &quot;
most Dom@@ sp@@ atzen are grateful to him today that he en@@ riches their lives and brought them to the world of music .
&quot; and that he is always a good , pat@@ ernal teacher - a strict father , certainly , that may be - but also a lov@@ able resp@@ ect@@ ful person , to which they still look up and to honour them . &quot;
&quot; and please , once again clearly : all that you imagine are educational methods that were on the agenda at that time . &quot;
we can be glad that we have overcome this time long ago .
&quot; but it is most un@@ just , a man just because he is promin@@ ently and has an even more prominent brother to make a medi@@ al sc@@ ap@@ ego@@ at . &quot;
&quot; there is the evil intention behind it , only too obvious . &quot;
&quot; for the report , which was just published , reli@@ eves it . &quot;
&quot; now the stand would command , a 93 @-@ year @-@ old man who has acquired great mer@@ its and without the outside of Bavaria and perhaps Germany would probably not know the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen , finally in peace . &quot;
