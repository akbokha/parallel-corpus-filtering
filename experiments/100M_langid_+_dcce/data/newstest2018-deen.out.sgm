<seg id="1">Munich 1856: four maps that change your view of the city</seg>
<seg id="2">A Irren Anstalt where young people are to meet today.</seg>
<seg id="3">A crypt chapel that is now dug for the S-Bahn tunnel.</seg>
<seg id="4">Small gardeners manage the former reason of farmers.</seg>
<seg id="5">The oldest official map of Munich encourages exciting stories to days.</seg>
<seg id="6">It annoys when maps are not up to date.</seg>
<seg id="7">Everybody knows everybody who had to stir up because the car-Navi took a green meadow instead of a walk road.</seg>
<seg id="8">"the historical maps of the digital Bavaria-Atlases, an offer of the Geoportals Bayern of the State Government, are anything but up-to-date - but very revealing."</seg>
<seg id="9">Especially if you compare them with current online maps.</seg>
<seg id="10">Then it becomes clear how cities and municipalities have changed in the spread-area of the Munich Merkur since the 19th century.</seg>
<seg id="11">The digital Bayern Atlas is a patchwork that can be recognized as such.</seg>
<seg id="12">"the large picture postcard has been incorporated into towns and communities more detailed maps, so-called prototype sheets."</seg>
<seg id="13">These were created according to the Bayerische surveying administration between 1810 and 1864 and jump from the first surveying of Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="14">Your client: Napoleon.</seg>
<seg id="15">The French army leader occupied Bavaria since the spring 1800 during the Second Coalition War with Austria.</seg>
<seg id="16">Napoleon wanted an overview of the occupied country and commissioned a topographic survey of Bavaria - of course for military purposes.</seg>
<seg id="17">"finally, when the French troops marched with the peace of Lunéville on February 9, 1801: today's neighbours who created the idea of a nationwide Bavaria Card."</seg>
<seg id="18">"Elector Max IV. Joseph continued the project forward, founded the" Topographic Bureau, "and thus the Bayerische surveying management."</seg>
<seg id="19">The reference sheet for Munich dates back to 1856 and is like all the others on the website of the Bavarian State Library.</seg>
<seg id="20">The comparison of Early / Today is most impressive in the example of the state capital.</seg>
<seg id="21">The city has expanded in all directions and has grown together.</seg>
<seg id="22">An example of this is Untersendling that appears relatively isolated in the 1856 card.</seg>
<seg id="23">"Sendling was founded 21 years after the map was created, i.e. 1877, as a Munich district."</seg>
<seg id="24">Today Untersendling is located in the middle of the city.</seg>
<seg id="25">"the houses of Untersendlings are concentrated around 1856 along the present Plinganserstraße, which was named after Georg Sebastian Plinganser in 1878, a leader of the Executive Board of the Bavarian peasants against Austria 1705."</seg>
<seg id="26">"where today the Westpark is, you can see nothing but fields - at first glance: at the Hinduomen there is a smaller map with dozens of lines and numbers: handwriting numbered flings from the so-called" "original recording" "from which the basic tax was derived."</seg>
<seg id="27">Small plots still show no farmers today - but small gardeners of the plant "Land in Sun."</seg>
<seg id="28">A large green area is located north of Untersendling.</seg>
<seg id="29">"in the 19th century Theresienwiese, since 1810, was in fact still a meadow - and no concrete desert."</seg>
<seg id="30">"on the other side of the Isar, the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiatric medicine."</seg>
<seg id="31">"in the Urpositionsblatt, in the area of today's au-Haidhausen, one reads not only the street name" "at Gasteig" "or from the hill" "On the air" "- but also in large letters" Irren Anstalt. ""</seg>
<seg id="32">"yes, here at Auerfeldstraße you once blocked people with insane positions."</seg>
<seg id="33">"there was in 1858 / 59 the Munich district Irrenanstalt" "On the Auer Lünen". ""</seg>
<seg id="34">"from 1872 Dr. Bernhard von Gudden conducted the institution - the psychiatrist, who was brought in connection with the death of King Ludwig II."</seg>
<seg id="35">"he was advanced for his time and ended, for example, the chains of the so-called Irren."</seg>
<seg id="36">"he also instructed the staff to apply violence against the occupants," "says Hermann Wilhelm, head of the Museum Haidhausen, who occupied himself for an exhibition with the institution."</seg>
<seg id="37">"for 280 patients, there was first place, later on 500 places were expanded."</seg>
<seg id="38">"at some point, this capacity was no longer enough - the reason for the construction of the chalee facility in hair 1905."</seg>
<seg id="39">"since 2006, there is the Isar-Amper-Klinikum in Munich-Ost, one of the largest psychiatrists in Germany."</seg>
<seg id="40">Young people meet in Munich Salesianum on the premises of the former Auer Anstalt.</seg>
<seg id="41">The Order acquired the building complex in 1920 and turned him into a youth home with training facilities.</seg>
<seg id="42">"west is the football pitch of the TSV Munich East, east of residential buildings from the 1980s."</seg>
<seg id="43">"in 2015, the children's house" Casa Don Bosco "was built in architectural interest in the original building of the Irrenanstalt, which was destroyed during the Second World War in bombing attacks."</seg>
<seg id="44">"the Marienplatz was listed in 1856 as" "main square", "the Kaufingerstraße was called" Kaufinger Gasse. ""</seg>
<seg id="45">A decisive change brought the Second World War also in the heart of Munich.</seg>
<seg id="46">The Bombs of the Allied tears in December 1944 found a lot of holes in the inner city.</seg>
<seg id="47">A big remained until today - at the Marienhof.</seg>
<seg id="48">"the English Institute, small business houses and a pit chapel from the Middle Ages were once on the Marienhof, where these days were the pre-work and on 5 April 2017 the groundbreaking ceremony for the second S-Bahn line."</seg>
<seg id="49">"with the slider, the old Munich-card can be compared to the aerial image of today - and fill the hole at the Marienhof."</seg>
<seg id="50">Civil Rights Group publishes travel warning for Missouri</seg>
<seg id="51">The National Association for the Promotion of Fares has issued a warning for coloured people travelling to Missouri due to the discriminatory policy and the racist attacks of the State.</seg>
<seg id="52">"the NAACP Travel Advisory for the State of Missouri, which will take effect until 28 August 2017, calls for special attention to Afghan American travelers, visitors and Missourians, as a number of questionable, rapid-based occurrences occur in recent times throughout the country and be noted here," it is said in the opinion of the group. "</seg>
<seg id="53">"a recently adopted law of Missouri, which makes people harder to win discriminations, as well as the prosecution authorities of the state that disproportionate minorities, the NAACP said."</seg>
<seg id="54">They have violations of civil rights which people pass.</seg>
<seg id="55">"they are halted or killed because of their skin colour, they are smitten or killed," said the President of Missouri NAACP, Rod Chapel, Kansas City Star. "</seg>
<seg id="56">We hear complaints in such a frequency that we haven't heard yet.</seg>
<seg id="57">It is the first such warning issued by the organization for a state in the US.</seg>
<seg id="58">"the group quoted incidents such as racist crime against black students at the University of Missouri and death of Tory Sanders, 28, a black man from Tennessee."</seg>
<seg id="59">"Sanders also died in questionable circumstances at the beginning of the year, having no more gasoline on the journey through the state and taken custody by the Missouri police, without being accused of a crime."</seg>
<seg id="60">The Council also points to a recent report of the Office of the Missouri Attorney Office in which black drivers in the state are 75 percent more common than white ones.</seg>
<seg id="61">"the recommendation is that people are aware and inform their families, friends and staff about what could happen in Missouri," "said Chapel."</seg>
<seg id="62">People must be willing to bring it to chewing money or make relatives know that they travel through the state.</seg>
<seg id="63">"Missouri recorded 100 hate crimes in 2015, according to the latest figures from the hate crime report of the FBI, which ranks the state in terms of the number of such injuries to the 16th position of the country."</seg>
<seg id="64">"the travel warning is also an answer to a new Missouri law, which would make it harder to sue a company because of housing or employment discrimination."</seg>
<seg id="65">"previously, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) had issued travel warnings for Texas and Arizona, having adopted immigration laws to arrest people because of immigration violations, which will contribute to the view of ACLU for further race profiling."</seg>
<seg id="66">"travel warnings are usually issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for other countries, but lately, interest groups have used the measure in response to certain laws and trends within the United States."</seg>
<seg id="67">Electric fence project is elementary</seg>
<seg id="68">The Fischerbacher Weidezaun-Project is a success project and will be continued in the coming year.</seg>
<seg id="69">The CDU members Peter White and Kordula Kovac have taken a picture on the spot.</seg>
<seg id="70">"at the court yard of the Schwendemann family, representatives of the Fischerbacher CDU locations met together with mayor Thomas Schneider and the two deputies."</seg>
<seg id="71">"Markus Schwendemann first granted glimpses into his farm, in which he cultivated 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest, 40 deciduous cows and as many kittens, and housed in five apartments Feriengäste."</seg>
<seg id="72">"the" "Schwarzwaldmilch" "is the alternative marketer for him for the milk of his cows, so Schwendemann."</seg>
<seg id="73">On the table of the Feriengäste only Regional.</seg>
<seg id="74">"since he is also BLHV-chairman of Fischerbach, he called the" "electric fence project" "as" "elementar important." ""</seg>
<seg id="75">I cannot profit on such steep areas.</seg>
<seg id="76">"the green area care for a lot of work, much needed to be machined with the brushcutter."</seg>
<seg id="77">"we have here to fight with the conditions and with topography," "stressed Schwendemann."</seg>
<seg id="78">"in 2003, he took over the farm and managed this without chemical plant protection and fertiliser, even if he does not lead bio-operation."</seg>
<seg id="79">"for Mayor Thomas Schneider, it was clear:" the Commune recognized the importance of the electric fence project and is glad about the leader. "</seg>
<seg id="80">"at the cost of 3000 to 4000 euros per hectare, farmers would have to be supported."</seg>
<seg id="81">I hope that the solicitation of the faces could be drawn up for quite a while.</seg>
<seg id="82">"the biggest treasure we have, are the people who work in agriculture and think about how they continue their business," "stressed the mayor."</seg>
<seg id="83">The farmers stand often in criticism because of the subsidies</seg>
<seg id="84">"in 2013, a total of 25 plots of eleven participants were fenced."</seg>
<seg id="85">"the surface area amounts to 40 hectares, which must not be forested until at least 2023."</seg>
<seg id="86">"the total cost of 71 500 Euro was funded half by Leaders, a quarter contributed to the municipality of Fischerbach."</seg>
<seg id="87">"thus, the farmers had to invest 12 610 euros, which they had to invest in 16.2 kilometers of turnout."</seg>
<seg id="88">"the big advantage is the longevity of the fences," explained Schwendemann. "</seg>
<seg id="89">"Kordula Kovac stressed:" "you do a really good job, without farmers and farmers it does not go."</seg>
<seg id="90">"Peter White also stood firm:" "the best food is produced here." ""</seg>
<seg id="91">The county administration line (LPR) Baden-Württemberg allows the government to promote pasture-fences.</seg>
<seg id="92">The goal is the disclosure of the Black Forest.</seg>
<seg id="93">The precondition is the presence of a conveyor belt signed by the LPR.</seg>
<seg id="94">"furthermore, the fenced area must not be towed (slope above 35 percent) and must therefore be threatened by the forestation."</seg>
<seg id="95">"at the moment, the application of eight participants with 24 plots, which would like to build around 16 kilometres of fence for the" "Fischerbacher Weidezaunproject 2018". ""</seg>
<seg id="96">"the open area corresponds to 35 hectares, the calculated costs are more than 112 000 euros."</seg>
<seg id="97">Is nothing more holy?</seg>
<seg id="98">Now the White House of Trump takes the Statue of Liberty</seg>
<seg id="99">The safest sign of a regime change is when they begin to attack the statues.</seg>
<seg id="100">The Americans appreciate these as well as any other - hence the carefully staged overthrow of Saddam Hussein at the Firdos square in Baghdad in 2003.</seg>
<seg id="101">"Stephen Miller, one of the key ideologists of the Trump regime, certainly knew what he did when he took a symbolic axe in a heated argument with Jim Acosta from CNN on the proposals of the President to drastically restrict legal immigration to the Statue of Liberty."</seg>
<seg id="102">"to stay fair, Miller did not handle the statue itself."</seg>
<seg id="103">A horde of boat owners and liberty imitators would have laughed him if he had done it.</seg>
<seg id="104">"but he grabbed its significance, and in particular the meaning that you have been attributed to when the famous poem by Emma Lazarus 1903, 17 years after completion of the monument, was added to his base."</seg>
<seg id="105">"as Miller Acosta wrote:" I don't want to go into a complete thing about history here, but the Statue of Liberty is... a symbol of American freedom that illuminates the world. "</seg>
<seg id="106">The poem you relate to that later was added and not part of the original Statue of Liberty.</seg>
<seg id="107">"Miller is appropriately correct, but as he formulated it himself, it is not really about history."</seg>
<seg id="108">"it is about the contemporary resonance on the vibrating words of Lazarus, the only ones in which a state does not only invite any old immigrants, but the poorest of the poor:" "your garbage, your arms, / your afflicted masses, who desire to breathe freely, / the flowing waste of your rich coasts."</seg>
<seg id="109">There was never a time in which the "elend waste" was better seen on our screens.</seg>
<seg id="110">Miller was not engaged in literary criticism - he made clear that these people are not welcome in Trumps.</seg>
<seg id="111">"this conflict, because of the significance of a statue, is part of a broader political and cultural debate: it is indeed a conflict about America's importance."</seg>
<seg id="112">Lazarus - and her friends who set themselves to place their words after their death at the base - knew very well that they did a highly political act.</seg>
<seg id="113">The sculpture should show the connections between French and American republican by portraying the female embodiment of freedom in an unused classical depiction.</seg>
<seg id="114">"Lazarus has changed this meaning: in her poem, the female figure is no more abstract - she has received a voice."</seg>
<seg id="115">And she gives herself a very different name: mother of exiles.</seg>
<seg id="116">The connection of the poem with the image is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on the American Nativism.</seg>
<seg id="117">"and just as Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, the people wanted to change from the right wing for a long time."</seg>
<seg id="118">"the great scream Rush Limbaugh, a kind of John the Baptist for the coming of Trump, argued in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty was unable to invade anyone, but rather an early neoconservative who brings the American flame into the umnachted world:" Lady Liberty goes forward. "</seg>
<seg id="119">It is to carry the torch of freedom from the United States into the rest of the world.</seg>
<seg id="120">The torch is not supposed to enlighten the way to the United States. "</seg>
<seg id="121">Limbaugh is quite unusual here on something.</seg>
<seg id="122">The significance of the statue is entirely a question of the standpoint of perception.</seg>
<seg id="123">"the great imaginative deed of Lazarus was to see them as seen from the exhausted, miserable, but hopeful people after long and often terrible journeys on the decks of ships."</seg>
<seg id="124">It is in the true sense to see the world from the perspective of people who seek refuge and a chance to improve their lives.</seg>
<seg id="125">Her statue speaks to them the words of hope and the welcome they have to hear.</seg>
<seg id="126">And that is of course not the perspective that Miller and Trump ever wanted to acknowledge.</seg>
<seg id="127">"their torch is not supposed to illuminate the path, but the hatred that is their sole source of power."</seg>
<seg id="128">World Championship 2017: Neil Black praises Scottish members of the United Kingdom team</seg>
<seg id="129">Eilidh Doyle is reminiscent of a time when only two villi belonged to the UK team</seg>
<seg id="130">"the performance director of the athletics of the United Kingdom, Neil Black, says that the 16-member Scottish contingent in the world championship team will make a massive contribution to the team."</seg>
<seg id="131">A record number of Scottish athletes was selected for London 2017 that starts on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="132">"black believes that" "something special in Scotland" "and the athletics of the United Kingdom must learn something from it."</seg>
<seg id="133">"we welcome it and we try to understand it, and we will continue it until we find it out," said Black. "</seg>
<seg id="134">I talk to people in the Scottish Institute of Sports and they think it has something to do with what they have done.</seg>
<seg id="135">The Scottish athlets think it has something to do with what they have done.</seg>
<seg id="136">British athletics: it has something to do with what they have done.</seg>
<seg id="137">And also with the type on the street corner.</seg>
<seg id="138">"whatever the combination of circumstances is, it is absolutely brilliant."</seg>
<seg id="139">"several of the Scottish athletes are medals, among them Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart - who will compete against Sir Mo Farah at the 5,000 m distance while Eilidh Doyle was voted by the team to team captain."</seg>
<seg id="140">"" "Eilidh is rather modest."</seg>
<seg id="141">"their captain's speech was incredible," says Black. "</seg>
<seg id="142">"a number of athletes, whether they were Scottish or wherever they live or train, went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motivated."</seg>
<seg id="143">The passion and the real feeling that Eilidh made quite natural were great.</seg>
<seg id="144">"the Commonwealth Silver medal winner, who will compete in their fifth world championships at the 400 m hurdles, says that" "incredible" "is that 16 villi are in the British team."</seg>
<seg id="145">"Scotland's best total number of athletes at the World Championship was seven, which were reached in 1983 and 2015."</seg>
<seg id="146">The mid-haul Muir runs on this road and last year led five British and two European records.</seg>
<seg id="147">"it will take part in the 1,500 m and 5,000 m runs."</seg>
<seg id="148">"Chris O'Hare, who runs 1,500 m, is another Scotsman for a great season to watch the victory at the British Team Trials and the Anniversary Games."</seg>
<seg id="149">Doyle is reminiscent of her first world championships as the only other Scotsman in the Team Lee McConnell.</seg>
<seg id="150">"the team captain says that they are" "extremely proud" "to the fact that many of their compatriots are not only part of the team, but in some cases also be involved in the medals and the finals."</seg>
<seg id="151">"the special part of being a team captain is that it was voted by the other members of the team so that it was a great honour anyway, but knowing that my team colleagues have voted for me and have chosen me, it makes it something very special for me," she added. "</seg>
<seg id="152">"obviously, I am very proud of all the villi that belong to the team."</seg>
<seg id="153">It only shows how far we have come.</seg>
<seg id="154">"and they are here as established athletes, athletes who want to climb on podium."</seg>
<seg id="155">What concerns my speech as captain?</seg>
<seg id="156">"yes, I think she went well."</seg>
<seg id="157">I just pointed out that we are very happy in this situation as we have a home world championship.</seg>
<seg id="158">So it is really important to put on this home support and benefit from the fact that we are back at the Olympiastadion.</seg>
<seg id="159">I get a second chance to go there and compete and it will be just such a great atmosphere out there.</seg>
<seg id="160">Blocking Critics on Facebook: do not take care of a public office if you cannot tolerate the admission of voters</seg>
<seg id="161">The father of our country knew something of a bad press.</seg>
<seg id="162">"the Americans loved George Washington, but it didn't take long until the newspapers struck it because of everything, from domestic politics to its political principles."</seg>
<seg id="163">"he criticized in the critique, sure."</seg>
<seg id="164">But he did not put his critics to silence.</seg>
<seg id="165">"for in the year 1783, Washington said:" freedom of speech can be taken away - and, silly and dumb, we are led like sheep to slaughter. "</seg>
<seg id="166">"that brings me to Maryland to Governor Larry Hogan, who has to work to be more like Washington."</seg>
<seg id="167">Hogans employees have blocked and deleted the contributions of at least 450 people who have expressed their opinion on their official Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="168">And the American Civil Liberties Union pleaded him at the beginning of this week.</seg>
<seg id="169">"the governor's staff dismissed the lawsuit as frivolous, and the online commentary was full of a counter-reaction with" Na, "and?."</seg>
<seg id="170">"it is only Facebook," "said many people."</seg>
<seg id="171">But it is important.</seg>
<seg id="172">And it is especially important when it is a type like Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="173">This is a republican governor in an overwhelming democratic state that is amazingly popular.</seg>
<seg id="174">He has the second highest consent of the 50 governors of the nation.</seg>
<seg id="175">Hogan is not a reactionary Hitzhead.</seg>
<seg id="176">He has shown a strong hand in the leadership of his state and strict observance of the principles.</seg>
<seg id="177">"he was also very skillful to use Facebook as a primary means to connect with his voters, playing his hairy head after chemotherapy on his side."</seg>
<seg id="178">"this is why the blocking of persons coming to the governor's side - which is a public forum, which is designated as officially and by employees, who are paid by public tax dollars - unnecessary and ultimately dangerous."</seg>
<seg id="179">"in an interview with The Washington Post, Hogans Speaker Amelia Chasse defended the governor's actions and argued that blocking the comments is nothing more than a moderation."</seg>
<seg id="180">But it is too easy to use the image of trolls or spammers or hate-filled people who vibrate online the whip.</seg>
<seg id="181">The mail spoke with some of the real people blocked by Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="182">"these are only real people speaking with their elected leaders: a teacher, an entrepreneur and a priest, no trolls."</seg>
<seg id="183">"they all said their comments were respectful, thoughtful and not profane."</seg>
<seg id="184">The pastor quoted the Bible in his post and appealed to Hogans Catholic faith.</seg>
<seg id="185">"attorney Lakshmi Sarma Ramani of Bowie, Md., was not hassertive, but she asked for hate crimes."</seg>
<seg id="186">"I was polite that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to hate crimes and other current news," she wrote in the commentary area of the news "The Post." "</seg>
<seg id="187">"I don't appreciate this idea, if a number of people occupy the same subject, they are disregarded by some rather than a so-called collective effort and not recognized as a large group of affected citizens."</seg>
<seg id="188">"what the governor's employees referred to as" "concentrated spam attack" "would probably call another" "intercession". ""</seg>
<seg id="189">"the Facebook era makes it easy to cut a message by simply blocking a critic, or deleted a negative comment."</seg>
<seg id="190">"it is much cleaner than in earlier times, if one would have done the same that employees have been sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical articles and to arrest or arrest demonstrators."</seg>
<seg id="191">But exactly this just happens digitally.</seg>
<seg id="192">Hogan is not the first public officials who criticized Facebook and other social media.</seg>
<seg id="193">President Trump is sued by Twitter users that have been blocked by his Twitter feed.</seg>
<seg id="194">One of the first milestones in this question fell last week in Virginia.</seg>
<seg id="195">"the Chairman of the Board of Supervisors des Loudoun County injured the First Amendment, according to U.S. District Judge James C. Cacheris in Alexandria, when they named a voter from their Facebook page."</seg>
<seg id="196">"and in Kentucky, Governor Matt Bevin (R) also received a visit to the ACLU because of his use of Facebook and Twitter."</seg>
<seg id="197">It should not be so difficult.</seg>
<seg id="198">"at the time of Washington, the time of affordable portos had a similar effect as the Internet."</seg>
<seg id="199">"the number of newspapers multiplies between 1776 and 1800, and anonymous letters proposed to his leadership."</seg>
<seg id="200">And even back then Washington had anonymous trolls.</seg>
<seg id="201">"people who used pseudonyms such as" Juricola, "" Valerius, "" Belisarius "and" Portius "wrote all letters to newspapers, the Washington's decisions."</seg>
<seg id="202">"petitions criticised its position on amity, trade and shipping with Britain, overwhelmed his office, according to historical documents collected by the online papers of the George Washington Project."</seg>
<seg id="203">But he has not brought her to silence.</seg>
<seg id="204">"freedom of speech, disagreement and discourses belong to our nation."</seg>
<seg id="205">And true leadership means accepting that.</seg>
<seg id="206">Ronan Rafferty hopes for home comfort in the Renaissance club</seg>
<seg id="207">"the former Europeans no. 1 Ronan Rafferty will hope for the next three days, since the Renaissance Club in East Lothian has held the 25th edition of the Scottish Senior Open."</seg>
<seg id="208">"the Nordire, who in the past year led the Archerfield to the final round, before leaving Paul Eales, joined the new venue and acts as a tournament ambassador in the name of the founder and CEOs Jerry Sarvadi."</seg>

<seg id="214">"the English Eales is looking forward to defending a championship for the first time, although he won the European Tour as well as the European Challenge Tour in his 32-year career."</seg>

<seg id="219">"the memories from last year come back, and it was something special for me and my wife Sharon to win last year."</seg>
<seg id="220">It was a really special time and one we will always cherish.</seg>

<seg id="222">This event will be his first Scottish performance since the Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013.</seg>
<seg id="223">"it always means a bit more when you're playing at home," Orr said the man from Helensburgh. "</seg>
<seg id="224">"you want to do it well, but you also feel that extra pressure."</seg>
<seg id="225">I really enjoyed playing again and I played a solid golf.</seg>
<seg id="226">I'm happy about how it went.</seg>
<seg id="227">"with the trio in the field, the former Masters champion Ian Woosnam and Senior Major Champions Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNeck."</seg>
<seg id="228">"ORR and the former Ryder Cup captain Sam Torrance belong to the six Scots in the field, the others are Andrew Oldcorn, Stephen McAllister, Bill Longmuir and Ross Drummond."</seg>
<seg id="229">"the entrance is free, the parking costs £5 per car with a passengers and £10 per car with two or more passengers."</seg>
<seg id="230">All proceeds go to Prostate Cancer UK.</seg>

<seg id="232">"over the past two decades, fewer people have died because of passive smoking in lung cancer."</seg>
<seg id="233">Scientists from the University Hospital Hamburg-Eppendorf (UKE) come to this conclusion in a study.</seg>
<seg id="234">"according to our estimates, 167 lung cancer deaths are attributable to passive smoking per year," said Professor Heiko Becher. "</seg>
<seg id="235">"as a comparison, he drew up his own study on this issue of 1994."</seg>

<seg id="240">"in the field of domestic connections, the situation is more complicated than presumed, as there is much hiding in the underground, which is not noted in the plans."</seg>
<seg id="241">"traffic, which constantly obstructs construction work, represents a major problem for the bauttroop of the company Stumpp."</seg>
<seg id="242">"the ignorance of the drivers in front of red lights and shut-off racks is already enormous," says Heinze. "</seg>

<seg id="347">"the lack of meaningful development strengthens the dissatisfaction of the tribal families of Mee, Moni, Dani and damal, who live in the green highlands of Papua."</seg>

<seg id="350">"in response to this, thousands of people in Paniai were arrested and arbitrarily arrested in custody, under the pretext of" safeguarding national sovereignty. ""</seg>
<seg id="351">Some never appear again.</seg>
<seg id="352">"among the people of Papua, Paniai is known as" a tragic, forgotten place. ""</seg>
<seg id="353">Poverty strengthens the dissatisfaction.</seg>
<seg id="354">The little rice sold in Enarotali is too expensive for locals.</seg>
<seg id="355">Bread is just as out of reach.</seg>
<seg id="356">People here build everything they eat: especially nota and fruit and leafy vegetables.</seg>
<seg id="357">Agriculture is the task of women who can process four or five fields of the sweet potato.</seg>
<seg id="358">"they retain most of the harvest for the family, while the rest is sold on the local market."</seg>
<seg id="359">Ten pieces of Nota cost only 10.000 Indonesian rupee (75 cents).</seg>
<seg id="360">"over time, economic inequalities between the local Papua and the new migrants have grown, which have arrived in greater numbers since the opening of new routes to Nabire airport."</seg>
<seg id="361">The few jobs that exist in the region usually go to the better educated and wealthier migrants.</seg>
<seg id="362">Papua rarely have capital or the necessary skills to make their own businesses competitive.</seg>

<seg id="366">"at the beginning of the year, French journalists Franck Escudie and Basille Longchamp were deported because of lack of coordination with related institutions from Papua, although the rare permission to film was given."</seg>
<seg id="367">"according to Phelin Kine, the deputy Asia-director of Human Rights Watch, the promises of Jokowis campaign to raise the restrictions of reporting to promote transparency and development."</seg>
<seg id="368">"there are new dangers for foreign journalists who try to report from Indonesia's restless easternmost provinces of Papua and Western papua: visa denial and a black list," he said in an explanation. "</seg>
<seg id="369">Lack of press control means that international pressure on the Indonesian government is largely confined to the immediate neighbours Papuas.</seg>
<seg id="370">"in March, six pacific states - Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, the Marshall Islands and the Solomon Islands - the UN Human Rights Council to investigate the" various and widespread violations "in Papua including the Paniai foundry."</seg>

<seg id="372">"the spokesman of the Indonesian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Arrmanatha Nasir, pointed out the accusations of the group and said journalists in Jakarta:" in Indonesia, there is still a democratic system and there are free media, so it is difficult to cover the evidence for human rights.

<seg id="373">People on the spot want more foreign governments to take note of this.</seg>
<seg id="374">"as an official delegation from the Netherlands, visited by the Human Rights Ambassador Kees Van Baar, Jayapura on May 4, local people journeyed and urged him" We want freedom, "according to a source that also participated in the meeting but wants to remain anonymous."</seg>
<seg id="375">"Indonesia has another presidential election to 2019, but the Papua say they are unlikely to vote for Jokowi."</seg>
<seg id="376">"Jokowi is a person who has good intentions, but he is surrounded by the people who are involved in the Paniai shots," "says Gobai, the Chairman of the tribal Council."</seg>
<seg id="377">"he wants that Jokowi knows that the Paniai people, apart from that it lives under the constant threat of a predatory military, is located in poor educational and health services."</seg>
<seg id="378">"Gobai says that the Paniai people, like other Papua, consider their voice for Jokowi as a" guilt "he has to pay back."</seg>
<seg id="379">"they do not need money, they just want justice," "he says."</seg>
<seg id="380">"despite the threats and intimidations, families of the Paniai-shot victims led to a last symbolic act of the defiance: the dead of a victim was buried in an area just opposite the police and the military station."</seg>
<seg id="381">"they know that they may never give justice to them, but at least they don't forget those responsible for their crimes."</seg>

<seg id="425">"now Musk admits: from the total 518,000 pre-orders, 63.000 have been withdrawn back again."</seg>
<seg id="426">Critics have always pointed out that there is only non-binding reservations.</seg>

<seg id="440">"a day after he had been sued of 15 states, Scott Pruitt, head of the Environmental Protection Agency, withdrew his former decision to delay the implementation of the rules of the Obama era to reduce emissions of smog-causing pollutants."</seg>
<seg id="441">Pruitt presented the change when his agency proved to meet the needs of state environmental authorities as far as previous administrations.</seg>
<seg id="442">He did not mention the complaint that was raised against his previous position in a Federal Court of Appeal.</seg>
<seg id="443">It is a period that went on October 1 for states to comply with the standards of 2015 for ground-level ozone.</seg>
<seg id="444">"in June, Pruitt announced that he would delay the compliance with a year in order to give his authority more time to study the plan and to avoid interfering with local decisions or to hinder economic growth."</seg>
<seg id="445">"Pruitt, who was before his appointment by President Donald Trump's prosecutor of Oklahoma, was a reliable opponent of harsh environmental regulations for a long time."</seg>
<seg id="446">"since his arrival in Washington, Pruitt has repeatedly gone over to block or delay regulators which oppose the chemical industry and the industry of fossil fuels."</seg>
<seg id="447">The sudden reversal of Wednesday is the most recent legal setback for the incision of regulatory rollback agenda.</seg>
<seg id="448">"last month, a federal court in Washington decided that the EPA manager exceeded its authority when he tried to delay the implementation of a rule of the Obama administration, the oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce methane lecks."</seg>
<seg id="449">"in a statement issued on Wednesday evening, Pruitt proposed that his reversal at ozone standards simply reinforces the willingness of EPA to cooperate with the States through the complex process of timely fulfillment of the new standards."</seg>
<seg id="450">"under former administrations, the EPA often has not kept the deadlines for carrying out and then been accused of being indicted by activist groups and others, and in an agreement to establish the date for execution," said Pruitt, who defended the EPA more than a dozen times in his previous job.

<seg id="466">"750 years of St. Hilarius Church: on the occasion of the Jubilee of the Bergkirche, the old cemetery-area in Tumlingen will be invited to a Serenade on Sunday, 16 July."</seg>
<seg id="467">Whether its idyllic location and beautiful views of the village is the historical St. Hilarius facility a popular place to stay.</seg>
<seg id="468">Visitors to the Sixth Benefiz serenade can be enchanted by this powerful place.</seg>
<seg id="469">The rescue and preservation of the oldest building in the village have made friends and supporters of ours to their concerns.</seg>
<seg id="470">Walter Martini emphasizes: "it is a unique dörfliches Kleinod."</seg>
<seg id="471">In 1267 St. Hilariuskapelle was first mentioned in the Württembergischen jungle book: Count Hermann von Sulz sold the mountain with the parish church at Magister Eberhard von Horb and his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark silver.</seg>
<seg id="472">"according to the certificate of the certificate, on the Tumlinger Mountain, apart from the former parish church, there was also a magnificent courtyard where the church or the patron saint belonged, and not the other way round."</seg>
<seg id="473">So there were also people there.</seg>
<seg id="474">"as described in the description of the Oberamt" "Freudenstadt" "of 1858, it was next to Unterdorf and the Oberdorf, which are still visible in the local picture of Tumlingen, the" mountain "of the third, the beautiful settlement of the village."</seg>
<seg id="475">Old maps from the time around 1600 are supporting this historical situation.</seg>
<seg id="476">The right of patronage was created from the early medieval church law.</seg>
<seg id="477">"a Lord who built a church and occupied with a pastor, remained the owner of this church and could also inherit this church."</seg>
<seg id="478">"in this way, the right to use a priest or to propose a new pastor to the bishop."</seg>
<seg id="479">There were three altars in the church and two bells on the tower.</seg>
<seg id="480">The bigger ones are broken at Christmas 1673.</seg>
<seg id="481">"the newly created bell, then first introduced in 1692, had to be handed over later during the Second World War in 1942."</seg>
<seg id="482">"in the 30-year-old war (1616 to 1648), the windows were wrapped and the bell parts were stolen."</seg>
<seg id="483">The roof was leaking.</seg>
<seg id="484">1796 French troops encamped near the church.</seg>
<seg id="485">They removed the pulpit and church chairs and used them as firewood.</seg>
<seg id="486">The remains of the church threatened in 1809.</seg>
<seg id="487">"until 1869, the Tumlinger cemetery served as the last resting place for the dead from Hörschweiler."</seg>
<seg id="488">In 1823 the cemetery was enlarged and the Hilariuskirche was aborted.</seg>
<seg id="489">Only the church tower can be found.</seg>
<seg id="490">In the New Year's Night in 1834 a storm split the Kirchturm and half crashed.</seg>
<seg id="491">"to prevent misfortune, the tower was broken off."</seg>

<seg id="505">"" "Boisheim wees itself" "does not see any legal requirement for the construction and has therefore turned to the council."</seg>
<seg id="506">"Boisheim," Boisheim, "has prompted Landrat Andreas Coenen (CDU) to regain its approval for the construction of planned wind turbines in the Boisheimer Nette."</seg>
<seg id="507">It is unlawful.</seg>
<seg id="508">"the association argues that at the time of approval on 30 December 2016 in the Boisheimer Nette, no wind turbines could have been approved since at the time in Viersen, a wind force concentration zone existed only at the border of Schwalmtal."</seg>
<seg id="509">"within this concentration zone, construction and operation of wind turbines are generally possible, but at the same time the concentration zone causes an exclusion of wind energy for the other city area."</seg>
<seg id="510">Such zones should prevent a "saving" of the landscape.</seg>
<seg id="511">"the city of Viersen had decided a second wind force concentration zone in the Boisheimer Nette, a few days earlier - but the district government of Düsseldorf had not approved, because of a lack of shape."</seg>
<seg id="512">"due to the lack of scheduling legal requirements, the granted approval is still unlawful and therefore also rejected," "said Christoph Erkens, President of" Boisheim. ""</seg>
<seg id="513">Current state of affairs: the city council again decided the wind concentration zone in the Boisheimer Nette before the summer break; a permit from the district government is still pending.</seg>
<seg id="514">Erkens: "this is where the issuance of a permit for the establishment of wind turbines is legally excluded."</seg>

<seg id="517">The circle takes them to the occasion to check the matter again.</seg>
<seg id="518">"however, they do not lead to the fact that the procedure is stopped."</seg>
<seg id="519">"with a view of ongoing proceedings at the Administrative Court, the circle on Thursday did not want to express itself in terms of the argument of the" Boisheim "association."</seg>
<seg id="520">"the NEW Re, a subsidiary of the NEW, plans on an area at the Boisheimer Nette the construction of four each 200 metres high wind turbines."</seg>
<seg id="521">"last year, the company, where the city of Viersen was mediable, had closed lease contracts with the owner of the approximately 65 hectares large grounds."</seg>
<seg id="522">"with the construction of the four wind turbines, electricity needs of around 11 400 households should be covered - this corresponds to approximately one fifth of the electricity needs of all four-senders."</seg>
<seg id="523">The NEW Re aims to invest some 20 million euros.</seg>
<seg id="524">"last summer, Viersen's City Council gave green light to the purchase of three wind turbines at the Linnich Windpark near Aachen as well as a stake in a wind energy plant in Übach-Palenberg in the district Heinsberg."</seg>

<seg id="807">Accessibility is also a criterion.</seg>
<seg id="808">"later, the star trail should be extended by train."</seg>
<seg id="809">"on the pathway, the viewers experience a lot of knowledge, for example about the physics of the individual stars," explained the association. "</seg>

<seg id="868">"I don't know how we are going to act in Aue," says his coach Friedhelm Funkel, but Hoffmann is his thing safe, "because we have just in the three chain on the semi-positions in Kaan Ayhan and Niko Gießelmann who can build up well," said Hoffmann. "</seg>

<seg id="997">"I thought it was a very open answer today, a very honest presentation," said IAAF President Coe the Reporters. "</seg>
<seg id="998">The whole council and the entire Congress were delighted that the Russian Federation has recognised by itself that it has experienced some pretty hot times and will do everything possible to make sure the Federation is redesigned.</seg>

<seg id="1122">The rules aimed at preventing unimpeded expenditures of European football clubs will not bother Neymars Weltrekord transfer from the Spanish Barcelona to the French Paris-Saint Germain.</seg>
<seg id="1123">"any consequences will come for Paris Saint-Germain of the UEFA, as the leading organization that monitors the European game has the power to ban crews from access to the prestigious Champions League tournament."</seg>
<seg id="1124">"financial Fair Play rules launched in 2011 by the UEFA, mean that PSG has to point out that the transfer from Neymar was financed without major losses."</seg>
<seg id="1125">"Barcelona has paid 222 million euros (262 million dollars) to buy the Brazilian from its contract, and Neymar will receive a salary that will amount to several tens of millions of dollars a year."</seg>
<seg id="1126">Here are some of the financial aspects of Neymars moving to France.</seg>
<seg id="1127">"PSG can certainly make the money loose, so that Neymar is underwriting and bringing him into a galaxy of other stars, given the financing of the team by the rich ruling family of Qatar."</seg>
<seg id="1128">"associations are allowed to spend a lot of money for the acquisition of players, but have to counteract legitimate sources of income that allow them to break the break-even point in their business-related business."</seg>
<seg id="1129">FFP was designed by Michel Platini following his election to the UEFA President in 2007.</seg>
<seg id="1130">"the former French player believed that clubs, who had enormous debt in their quest for success, cheated effectively and risked to ruin themselves when banks or owners withdrew their support."</seg>
<seg id="1131">"in 2011, FFP moved from concentrating on the debts of clubs to monitor their losses."</seg>
<seg id="1132">"the change meant that the business model, the Roman Abramovich originally bought in Chelsea in 2003 - bought a club with potential and then invested strongly in order to improve the crew and build a global brand - to become a harder matter."</seg>
<seg id="1133">"during the current three-year survey period, which runs until 2018, clubs can accept losses of EUR 30 million."</seg>
<seg id="1134">"and although Platini has fallen from the presidency in Ungnade in 2015, his UEFA successor Aleksander Ceferin continues to deter him from excessive spending."</seg>
<seg id="1135">"surely, FFP is not dead and we will reinforce the rules for the future," said Andrea Traverso, who is responsible for the UEFA for FFP, compared to The Associated Press last week. "</seg>
<seg id="1136">"although the PSG has paid the buy-out clause of Neymar in a package, it can distribute the amount for invoicing over the duration of its contract."</seg>
<seg id="1137">"Neymar has signed a five-year contract, so that the liquidation can be expelled for the next five years in the amount of 44.4 million euros in the annual financial statements."</seg>
<seg id="1138">"the first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014, the PSG together with Abu Dhabi, owned by Manchester City, has hit the heaviest sanctions."</seg>
<seg id="1139">"the PSG got a fine of 60 million euros (then 82 million dollars), which later reduced to 20 million euros - and it was arranged that the team members for the Champions League of the season 2014 / 15 will be limited to 21 players instead of the usual 25 players."</seg>
<seg id="1140">"UEFA is looking for clubs that could try to oversee their financial supervision by relying their income through companies linked to the owners of a club."</seg>
<seg id="1141">"while a cataric company could sponsor the PSG, if the value of sponsoring should exceed the standard market sets, the UEFA would not be considered legitimate incomes."</seg>
<seg id="1142">Exactly what happened in 2014 when the UEFA decided that the value of the PSA sponsoring was inflated by the Qatar Tourism Authority.</seg>
<seg id="1143">It was reported that a part of the PSG payments to Neymar could come across payments from the Organizing Committee of the World Cup 2022 in Qatar.</seg>
<seg id="1144">But PSG and Qatar 2022 disputed that Neymar PWM ambassadors will be held and a poor maneuver for UEFA regulators could be easily figuring out.</seg>
<seg id="1145">"the previous sanctions against PSG signify that the UEFA will be more attentive, every attempt to respect the rules."</seg>
<seg id="1146">"the UEFA had no prepared conversations with PSG via Neymars Transfer, said on Thursday the people familiar with the situation."</seg>
<seg id="1147">"they spoke on the condition of anonymity with The Associated Press, since they were not authorized to discuss the PSG situation."</seg>
<seg id="1148">The latest published reports show that PSG 2015 / 16 generated a profit of more than 10 million euros with a turnover of EUR 542.4 million.</seg>

<seg id="1158">Swiss is looking for a new goggiver</seg>
<seg id="1159">"over the past few years, Chocolat Frey has made board chocolate for the Swiss."</seg>
<seg id="1160">"now, the long-term cooperation is in front of a possible end: the airline is writing down the order."</seg>
<seg id="1161">Swiss-Speaker Meike Fuhlred confirmed on request from the news agency sda a corresponding report from the newspaper "Nordwestschweiz" from Friday.</seg>
<seg id="1162">"according to current planning, the airline will conclude a new contract in the first half of 2018."</seg>
<seg id="1163">The products would be checked every two to three years and subjected to a quality control.</seg>
<seg id="1164">"we are very happy with the current supplier Chocolat Frey," "said the spokesperson."</seg>
<seg id="1165">Around 17 million small red-white chocolate boards of 14 grams are distributed per year before landing to passengers.</seg>
<seg id="1166">Swiss didn't want to provide any information about the costs.</seg>
<seg id="1167">"industry insiders estimate the volume of order according to" "Nordwestschweiz" "to 1.5 to 2 million Swiss francs - the Migros subsidiary achieves an annual turnover of approximately one billion Swiss francs."</seg>
<seg id="1168">"but more importantly, the advertising effect is more important: for a chocolate company it is a prestigious job."</seg>
<seg id="1169">"as many applicants are in the new tender, Swiss does not want to betray."</seg>
<seg id="1170">"in question, however, only Swiss manufacturers are coming."</seg>
<seg id="1171">"according to the newspaper report, Chocolat Frey wants to make an effort to renew the Treaty on Spring 2018."</seg>
<seg id="1172">"for the sda, the largest Swiss chocolate manufacturer was not reachable for an opinion."</seg>

<seg id="1184">"this repetition of history is at the same time nostalgic because of the glorious days of the characters of the 80-s, for the 90-year-Grunge era (as the pioneers David Wain and Michael Showalter the Sketch comedy" The State "for MTV), and for himself - that is, for 2001, before their stars, like Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poehler and Paul Rudd went to greater things."</seg>
<seg id="1185">As a cultural artifact it is equally a parody and a embodiment of our Facebook-capable era of permanent memories.</seg>
<seg id="1186">"but as franchise, it feels like the time would be scarce."</seg>
<seg id="1187">"first Day of Camp" worked surprisingly well, not only because of his absurd lobster (it contained a original story for a speaking can of vegetables that was spoken by H. Jon Benjamin). "</seg>
<seg id="1188">"by sticking to the core of the gags - middle-aged actors play awesome children who are grown up - nevertheless, they managed to win the last part of the Witzes back."</seg>

<seg id="1190">"at one point, there is a character through an Apple powerbook, some inline skates and a number of other things from 1991."</seg>
<seg id="1191">Many of the central stories are the same.</seg>
<seg id="1192">"the gracious Coop (Mr. Showalter), now romanesque, has still not forgotten Katie (Marguerite Moreau)."</seg>
<seg id="1193">Victor (Ken Marino) has still not lost its virginity.</seg>
<seg id="1194">And there is another crazy malignant plot involving Ronald Reagan (also Mr. Showalter) who is now supported by George H. W. Bush (a good read by Michael Ian Black).</seg>
<seg id="1195">"as always, the exams are the best part of the franchise."</seg>
<seg id="1196">"it is especially fun to see the eternal young Mr. Rudd, the Matt Dillons's sublip style of" Singles, "whose former Big-Man-on-Camp Andy feels like an old cracker."</seg>
<seg id="1197">"it's the moments of accidental madness that could heat this franchise like a sort of repetitive" Seven Up! "series until he achieved what I saw as his logical conclusion:" "Wet Hot American Summer" "will show how they will visit the film premiere of" "Wet Hot American Summer". ""</seg>
<seg id="1198">"Comrade Detective" at Amazon is now reminiscent of another kind of nostalgia: to revitalize the Cold War from "The Americans," to the movie "Atomic Blonde" and even "GLOW" with its East-West wrestling iconography. "</seg>

<seg id="1201">It is an ingenious idea.</seg>
<seg id="1202">But it is not much more than an idea.</seg>

<seg id="1204">"and the list of famous speakers - including Jenny Slate, Nick offerman, Mahershala Ali and Chloë Sevigny - provides a decent play 'Find out the voice'."</seg>
<seg id="1205">But "Comrade Detective" is involved so much for the truthfulness of a desperate propaganda drama - a killer who carries a Reagan Mask is involved - that it often plays like a single.</seg>
<seg id="1206">"in six long episodes it moves, and the comedy is not fast or frequent enough."</seg>
<seg id="1207">"Comrade Detective, who was edited on a smaller length, could better deliver his agitprop satire, since Gregor and Iosef always visit the American embassy, whose lobby is always occupied by two thick men who swallow a bunch of hamburgers."</seg>

<seg id="1214">"in addition, the officials set up larger quantities of marijuana and cocaine, firearms as well as several hundred thousand Euros."</seg>
<seg id="1215">Two persons were arrested at the same time in Italy.</seg>
<seg id="1216">"against the two suspects of Italians, there were German arrest warrants."</seg>
<seg id="1217">The two are probably supplied to Germany.</seg>
<seg id="1218">Italian and Bavarian investigators were involved in the action.</seg>
<seg id="1219">More than 300 policemen were in use.</seg>
<seg id="1220">"the members of the Mafia are accused of organised drug criminality, serious violence, trial murder as well as robbery and extortion."</seg>
<seg id="1221">"since summer 2016, the public prosecutor's office detects Constance against organised drug trafficking in the south German area."</seg>
<seg id="1222">Between the prosecutors in Konstanz and Palermo there was a lively exchange and the investigators of the Kripo Rottweil had almost daily contact with their colleagues in Sicily.</seg>

<seg id="1231">"according to estimates, 10 million people with foreign nationalities are recorded in the Register, including some 5.7 million from non-EU countries."</seg>
<seg id="1232">The data is therefore managed by approximately 600 foreign country authorities in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="1233">"because the data were not sufficiently maintained, the data quality in parts has not been good until now."</seg>
<seg id="1234">"in individual cases, data from 1921 have been found," of people who have long been no longer alive, or of citizens who have become German citizens and should actually no longer appear in the register. "</seg>

<seg id="1236">"in the statistics of foreign-paid people, EU citizens are surveyed that would not have to travel."</seg>
<seg id="1237">"however, such false orders led to a distorted debate on how to deal with the refugees," it is therefore stated in the analysis. "</seg>
<seg id="1238">"meanwhile, the Federal Government has apparently begun to send refugee families back to Italy with 16-year-old children if they are there."</seg>
<seg id="1239">"this will emerge from an internal paper of the Federal Office for Migration and Refugees (BAMF), reports the" New Osnabrück newspaper. ""</seg>

<seg id="1262">Bank of England will keep interest rates at 0.25%</seg>
<seg id="1263">"the Bank of England will probably be announced later that interest rates will remain unchanged, after the weak economic growth and the weakening of inflation have dampened speculation over a rise."</seg>
<seg id="1264">"the Bank of England has warned that economic growth will remain" "luggish" "when they retained interest rates on family income in the middle of an intensifying pressure."</seg>
<seg id="1265">"the political decision-makers of the Monetary Committee (MPC) of the Bank voted with 6 to 2 to keep interest rates to 0.25%, whereby fewer members aspire to increase as the weak economic growth has weakened the support for an upliftment."</seg>
<seg id="1266">"in its quarterly inflation report, the Bank reduced its growth forecasts for 2017 to 1.7% and 2018 to 1.6% and warned that the pressure on the budgetary income would continue, with inflation expected to rise to just under 3% in the fall."</seg>
<seg id="1267">"but they signalized that in the next few years interest increases would be necessary to brew the inflation of the Brexit, and she said that lending costs would have to rise more than expected to the financial markets."</seg>
<seg id="1268">Members also agreed to withdraw a part of the Mammut economic package that was issued a year after the Brexit.</seg>
<seg id="1269">"it will demand time for the financing plan to provide cheaper funding for banks from the coming February, although it is expected that they will now provide 15 billion pounds more within the framework of this system - with 115 billion pounds sterling."</seg>
<seg id="1270">"minutes after the decision on the interest rate, the Bank said:" in the central prognosis of the MPC the gross domestic product (GDP) remains weak, as the pressure on the real income of households continues to be burdened. "</seg>
<seg id="1271">"at the rate of interest, they repeated that" a certain tightening of monetary policy "would be necessary for the cooling of inflation and a" greater "scale than markets expect."</seg>
<seg id="1272">"Euromonitor International has over 40 years' experience of publishing market research reports, business reference books and online information systems."</seg>
<seg id="1273">"however, the Bank emphasised that increases" step-by-step "and" limited "would take place."</seg>
<seg id="1274">Forecasts to 2019 illustrate how the market is set to change.</seg>
<seg id="1275">It has retained its growth forecast to 1.8% in 2018.</seg>
<seg id="1276">The pound fell after these news from the dollar and the euro.</seg>
<seg id="1277">The pound fell by 0.5% to 1.31 US dollars and fell by 0.4% to 1.11 Euro.</seg>
<seg id="1278">The decision to no change occurs after the recent disappointing growth figures have dampened the increasing expectations of an interest rate and the GDP in the second quarter increased from 0.2% in the preceding three months to 0.3%.</seg>
<seg id="1279">"growth will likely be 0.3% in the third quarter, although it will easily recover after the end of the year."</seg>
<seg id="1280">"the recent inflation report provided little enthusiasm for households that will be affected by rising inflation and low-level salaries, as the tightening is first even worse before it becomes better."</seg>
<seg id="1281">"she added that monetary policy in the coming years could not" "prevent the income of income", "but she added that wages are clearly" "recuperate" "at the end of its three-year forecast."</seg>
<seg id="1282">"the economy is also strengthened by increasing demand for British goods, which is attributable to the weak pound, which is compensated by a portion of lower consumer spending."</seg>
<seg id="1283">The decision comes one year after lowering of interest rates to 0.25% in the last August following the shocking EU vote which caused the loss of the stick.</seg>
<seg id="1284">The Bank estimates that it will probably take four years until this will reach the prices and the economy.</seg>
<seg id="1285">"before the Bank's last judgment on interest rates, the reputation of interest rates was increased, as inflation increased pressure on hard-pressed households, with three policy makers in July demanded rise to 0.5%."</seg>
<seg id="1286">"sorry, this entry is only available in Deutsch."</seg>
<seg id="1287">"the Bank said that in proportion to its target of 2%, the bank would be" "quite" "to the weak pound."</seg>
<seg id="1288">"Andrew Montlake, Director of Coreco Mortgage Brokers said:" "given the recent decline in swap rates, the mortgage market is likely to be more competitive again since the lenders would like to search for businesses and end the year in a positive way."</seg>
<seg id="1289">"the market looks particularly well for those in which the existing deals are negotiated and the new mortgages are closed, and many with toll-free options and low rates are becoming more and more popular."</seg>
<seg id="1290">NHS (National Health Service) is supposed to prescribe 10.000 people controversial HIV drug</seg>
<seg id="1291">Patients will receive access to a "transformative" HIV-prevention treatment in September after a fight against the High Court against the financing of the drug in NHS.</seg>
<seg id="1292">"NHS England announced that a preexpositional prophylaxis (prep) taken prior to intercourse, which can reduce the risk of infection in high-risk patients by around 86 percent, is now supplied by the health service via a first three-year study for estimated 10,000 people."</seg>
<seg id="1293">"he agreed to finance the trial after the Appeals Court confirmed a ruling by the Supreme Court of Justice last year, which the NHS had the authority to pay for the prep despite the claim that the local authorities should finance it."</seg>
<seg id="1294">"the Schachzug announced on Thursday was welcomed by NHS England boss Simon Stevens as" "important new intervention", "during the National Aids Trust (NAT) called this as a" decisive moment. ""</seg>
<seg id="1295">"sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield will be among the first to follow the registration of people and other clinics will follow in October before it will be introduced throughout England in April 2018."</seg>
<seg id="1296">Preexpositional prophylaxis (prep) is a result of HIV supplements that are taken before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection.</seg>
<seg id="1297">Studies have shown that prep significantly reduces HIV transmission in infections.</seg>
<seg id="1298">Taking prep before sexual intercourse means that just enough medicines are present in the body of a person to prevent HIV infection.</seg>
<seg id="1299">Such drugs can be taken every day or so already two hours before sexual intercourse.</seg>
<seg id="1300">"those who are eligible for treatment belong gay or bisexual men, transsexuals and individuals with HIV-positive partners who have not been successfully treated."</seg>
<seg id="1301">"in hospitals, suitable participants identify the study, including men, women, transgenders and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not known as well known by antiretroviral treatment."</seg>
<seg id="1302">People who live in England and registered at a GP can also opt-in for a possible participation in their local sex clinic.</seg>
<seg id="1303">The program becomes £10 million and NHS England signed a contract to supply the drugs this week after an international competitive procurement.</seg>
<seg id="1304">"the study aims to assess the full potential of prep by collecting clinical evidence, how it is used extensively and implemented in a large scale."</seg>
<seg id="1305">Stevens said: "this great new intervention should complement and overtake the far-reaching and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV.</seg>
<seg id="1306">It is another milestone in the more than three decades of ongoing progress in coping with one of the biggest health challenges of humanity. "</seg>
<seg id="1307">"Deborah Gold, Chief Executive at NAT (National Aids Trust) said:" "this is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV."</seg>
<seg id="1308">"prep, if targeted on needy and endangered people, offers the opportunity to change the English HIV epidemic."</seg>
<seg id="1309">"from September onwards, people with a high HIV risk will have access to this NHS-funded study in England to develop a new instrument which is really controlled individually and is not subject to a negotiation with a partner, leading to the improvement of many, many lives."</seg>
<seg id="1310">We warmly welcome this announcement. "</seg>
<seg id="1311">"Ian Green, CEO of the Terrence Higgins Trust, said:" "the priority must now be that the study is carried out quickly across the country and that no one who has a risk for HIV is left behind."</seg>
<seg id="1312">"now, as the prep test medicine was provided, we are on the best way to protect over 10,000 HIV infected people."</seg>
<seg id="1313">"Sharon Hodgson, Shadows Health Minister said:" "the beginning of the prep process is welcome and overdue after months of delay and hesitating."</seg>
<seg id="1314">The evidence shows how transformative this drug can be as part of our approach to HIV prevention and can end the transmission of this life-changing infection.</seg>
<seg id="1315">This attempt brings us a step closer to understanding the benefits of prep.</seg>
<seg id="1316">"now it is important that this study is carried out as soon as possible throughout the country to protect people who are infected with HIV, and that they will contribute to the termination of the proliferation of HIV in society."</seg>
<seg id="1317">Living: mezzanine and clever designer tricks have transformed this small Earls Court apartment into a spacious home</seg>
<seg id="1318">"Joanne Leigh, a former banker with a passion for real estate, resized in 2014 from a large house in Knightsbridge to a Earls Court Apartment."</seg>
<seg id="1319">It is on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne Terrace - and it's a proof of the new design that Joanne has not packed and sold their bags.</seg>
<seg id="1320">"before that I lived with my ex in Knightsbridge in a much larger space," "says Joanne."</seg>
<seg id="1321">I looked for something comparable to my price.</seg>
<seg id="1322">I was shown this apartment in Earls Court and she had the same high ceilings.</seg>
<seg id="1323">I fell in love with her and made an offer this day. "</seg>
<seg id="1324">"since the first visit the 1,000 square feet have been completely overhauled."</seg>
<seg id="1325">Originally a one-room estate with a nested layout - one had to go through the kitchen to get into the bedroom - wanted to add Joanne storage room and a mezzanine to optimally use the generous ceiling height.</seg>
<seg id="1326">"I wanted high ceilings, large windows, lots of light."</seg>
<seg id="1327">"that was my requirement," she says. "</seg>
<seg id="1328">"for this purpose, she assigned the architect and design studio Duck & Shed by Erfan Azadi from Notting Hill, who had 12.5 feet high ceilings and to create a home that was not only a development but also a place to live for Joanne."</seg>
<seg id="1329">"the ceiling was not large enough to place two rooms overthrown, so the architectural challenge was to create a mezzanine where one could stand."</seg>
<seg id="1330">Erfan had to think creatively to solve the announcement.</seg>
<seg id="1331">"the steelwork is quite complicated," he explains. "</seg>
<seg id="1332">We had to arrange the rooms in such a way that they were stacked by one another without hesitation.</seg>
<seg id="1333">"it was not only about building a simple platform, but to put the steel so that it had the right height for the function above or below."</seg>
<seg id="1334">This arrangement enabled Erfan to place two rooms at full height - with lots of additional drama.</seg>
<seg id="1335">"for the mezzanine, a classic copper light window of Retrouvius looks down over the glamorous living area."</seg>
<seg id="1336">"mirrored gold furniture, silver accents and vintage Serge Mouille lighting set the style for the program."</seg>
<seg id="1337">"the use of mirrors plays a role in adding theater, space and light."</seg>
<seg id="1338">At both ends a short corridor is mirrored to allow it to work longer.</seg>
<seg id="1339">"in the kitchen, the mirroring feels like a window into another room."</seg>
<seg id="1340">At the entrance there are mirrored units for all the briefs and glasses of Joanne.</seg>
<seg id="1341">"through the perception of a glamorous room, the beauty of the living room can close the kitchen if it is not used."</seg>
<seg id="1342">Foldable kitchens are nothing new.</seg>
<seg id="1343">The special thing about this is that it is a garage door.</seg>
<seg id="1344">"a bit of engineering went inside," explains Erfan from the steel reinforced, veneered MDF door. "</seg>
<seg id="1345">"it is opposite, so that when you slide the door, very easily slide."</seg>
<seg id="1346">"thanks to the clever use of space and storage space, Joanne could gain additional 16 m ², an additional bedroom and improved layout."</seg>
<seg id="1347">"at the end of the day you will sell the base area - or how your property is appreciated," says Erfan. "</seg>
<seg id="1348">"in a rudimentary form, a real estate agent will enter and calculate a calculation based on soil size."</seg>
<seg id="1349">"here, they managed to enlarge the floor surface and at the same time use high-quality materials that give the room its luxurious advantage."</seg>
<seg id="1350">"the materials are the things that you touch and that therefore help create an emotional bond in a home," says Erfan. "</seg>
<seg id="1351">"you do not love the electrical outlets in the walls.</seg>
<seg id="1352">"these are important, but they do not play with your heart."</seg>
<seg id="1353">It shows that an apartment can transform itself through a good design and increased square meter number of slightly standard in something very astonishing.</seg>
<seg id="1354">"in fact, such as Joanne, you could decide not to leave them."</seg>
<seg id="1355">Brothers fight for a $500 million real estate-empire</seg>
<seg id="1356">"two brothers are four decades after their Italian family founded the dynasty, in an examination of one of the biggest real estate-imperial Victorias worth more than $500 million."</seg>
<seg id="1357">"the former director of the 'Carlton-Football-Club' and developer Colin De Lutis is living in a villa in Toorak, only three doors from his younger brother Paul. he brought him to the Supreme Court to clarify how their property and their assets are to be divided."</seg>
<seg id="1358">"Paul wanted to withdraw from family business since 2014, but a sharp debate on the separation takes place at the Supreme Court of Justice."</seg>
<seg id="1359">"together with her mother Anna, the brothers have accumulated 38 real estates worth more than half a billion dollars, since the 1973 family bought a shop in Smith Street, Collingwood."</seg>
<seg id="1360">"there, the Westco family founded jeans and grew up to a chain of 160 retail stores."</seg>
<seg id="1361">It was sold to 85 million US dollars in 1999.</seg>
<seg id="1362">"this money was invested in real estate, and the De Lutis portfolio now includes offices in the city center, the development areas of Brunswick and Sorrento, the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Buller as well as shopping malls in the suburb."</seg>
<seg id="1363">"according to an agreement with her deceased father, Colin - by Paul as" main operator and the dominant personality "described in the De Lutis family - about two thirds of corporate assets and Paul, about one third."</seg>
<seg id="1364">A court file states that this means that Colin owns property worth $316 million and Paul in the value of 176 million dollars.</seg>
<seg id="1365">The division of real estate and cash has proved to be an issue for Paul.</seg>
<seg id="1366">"the assessments proposed by Colin have left him with what I thought for the best objects," he wrote in 2015 in a first affidavit. "</seg>
<seg id="1367">"last Friday, the first hearing of the Supreme Court took place after several failed placements."</seg>
<seg id="1368">"the brothers now also fight for control over the existing business - of which Colin, as Paul claims, have ruled him."</seg>
<seg id="1369">"Colin argued, this is not true, but throws Paul to manage some possessions incompetent."</seg>
<seg id="1370">"in an early affidavit submitted by Colin, he says he hoped to settle the dispute."</seg>
<seg id="1371">"my Italian inheritance dictates that the family is the most important priority," he wrote. "</seg>
<seg id="1372">"the costs increase in the event, with hundreds of pages with Affidavits, e-mails and reports from companies, including Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer, and with leading lawyers, among them Allan Myers, QC, and from both parties held law firms."</seg>
<seg id="1373">Mrs. De Lutis and her late husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who run milk bars and delicacies from the late 1950's and bought a shop in Brunswick in the early seventies.</seg>
<seg id="1374">"they used the security to buy the Collingwood property, in which Colin opened the first Jeansunloading of the family."</seg>

<seg id="1388">Trump of new Chief of Staff plans to limit the media abstinence of the President.</seg>
<seg id="1389">Others have tried and failed.</seg>
<seg id="1390">Maybe John F. Kelly can actually do it.</seg>
<seg id="1391">"if so, he will be the first."</seg>
<seg id="1392">POLITICO reports that the new Chief of Staff of the White House plans to restrict the flow of information to President Trump - including news media reports - hoping to keep the boss on a more evenly course.</seg>
<seg id="1393">Here is a piece by reporter Josh Dawsey:</seg>
<seg id="1394">"when John F. Kelly, the new Chief of Staff of the White House, met his first working day with conductive employees, he presented a major problem in President Donald Trumps White House he wanted to repair: bad information entered into the hands of the President."</seg>
<seg id="1395">Kelly said the employees that information about him should flow - whether on paper or in briefings - because the president would make better decisions if he would receive good information.</seg>
<seg id="1396">"Kellys diagnosis makes sense, but others have tried to tame Trump by monitoring its media control."</seg>
<seg id="1397">"President Trumps's relationship to television reaches decades back - and now, where he is in the White House, his TV advertisement is still strong."</seg>
<seg id="1398">"when Candidate Trump was annoyed because of unfair reporting, it was productive to show him that he received a fair coverage of jobs that were too convincing," said the former election campaign Sam Nunberg in February towards Politico. "</seg>
<seg id="1399">"Politicos Tara palmeri wrote at the time that" the key to keep the Twitter habit under control, according to six former election campaign officials, is to ensure that his personal media consumption involves a steady praise. "</seg>
<seg id="1400">Okay.</seg>
<seg id="1401">"but the idea that Trumps's Twitter habit has ever" "under control" "is ridiculous."</seg>
<seg id="1402">Perhaps these campuses know something we don't know others - that Trumps Tweets without their interventions have already contained more spark.</seg>
<seg id="1403">We will probably never learn something about the tweets that Trump hasn't sent.</seg>
<seg id="1404">"if his staff were able to keep it away from him several times, then their efforts have been worthwhile."</seg>
<seg id="1405">But nobody has consistently prevented it from causing Trump controversy.</seg>
<seg id="1406">"part of the problem is that people in a White House that are composed of competing parties, always try to present their own agenda by presenting Trump material that may promote their views from the world."</seg>
<seg id="1407">POLITICO - very busy with this story - reported in May about the preference of advisors to provide the President for strategic reasons without doubtful information.</seg>
<seg id="1408">This was an example described by Reporter Shane Goldmacher:</seg>
<seg id="1409">"current and former Trump officials say that Trump can react like a volcano on negative press cuts, especially those with damaged leaks, and that he tries to find out where these come from."</seg>
<seg id="1410">"this happened at the end of February, when someone asked the president to be a printed copy of an article by GotNews.com, the website of the Internet Provocateurs Charles C. Johnson, who accused the deputy chief of staff Katie Walsh to be" the source behind a pile of leaks "in the White House."</seg>
<seg id="1411">"although Johnson was permanently banned from Twitter because of Schikanen, or that he offered no concrete evidence, or that he had made false accusations in the past and revoke them."</seg>
<seg id="1412">Trump read the article and began asking employees about Walsh.</seg>
<seg id="1413">"Goldmaker added that the former Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and General Secretary of the White House, Rob Porter, tried to implement a system to manage and document the paperwork and document the Trump."</seg>
<seg id="1414">How did that work?</seg>
<seg id="1415">Kelly tries to do the same three months later.</seg>
<seg id="1416">"perhaps he will prove to be more effective manager than Priebus, but Trump is still his impulsive self, and his counselors are still striving for influence."</seg>
<seg id="1417">These unchanging factors make Kellys's mission very difficult.</seg>

<seg id="1429">Travellers have parked their 20 caravans in a field outside a wealthy street of Solihull that is called the "Millionaire series."</seg>
<seg id="1430">"they brought horses, babies and an army of vans after they were thrown out in May without being deterred by a ditch excavated by the Council to prevent their accidents."</seg>
<seg id="1431">The tactful group found a gap in the defense units and pressed their vehicles through a passage that remained unhindered to find a way.</seg>
<seg id="1432">"angry residents have pushed the Council of Solihull, who said it was" useless to deal with the problem. ""</seg>
<seg id="1433">"an anonymous tenant said:" "they were dragged there on Monday evening after they were sent from Bentley Heath, where they threw stones onto the passers."</seg>
<seg id="1434">"the Council must act in action by shame, as it was useless when dealing with the problem."</seg>
<seg id="1435">"the travellers were there in May, were moved and are now back."</seg>

<seg id="1445">From the former Hotel Birkenhof the Waldhotel Luise becomes.</seg>
<seg id="1446">The house in front of the gates of Freudenstadt is currently being renovated and will be re-opened on 1 March next year.</seg>
<seg id="1447">These are good news for the city.</seg>
<seg id="1448">"because with the closure of the Hotel Birkenhof due to the damaging Ambiente operating company mbH on 13 April 2014, some 30 000 nights per year were lost and also revenue from the tourist tax."</seg>
<seg id="1449">"in the fall of 2014, in view of dramatic rising numbers of refugees coming into the district, the hotel building offered the council office as a collective accommodation, which ensured controversial discussions."</seg>
<seg id="1450">The city prevented the lodging of asylum seekers by setting up a building plan to secure the area as a hotel location.</seg>
<seg id="1451">The decision was not undisputed at that time in the municipal council.</seg>
<seg id="1452">"however, above all Freudenstadt's mayor Julian Osswald defended the hotel location and already spoke of serious interested parties at the house."</seg>
<seg id="1453">He should keep right.</seg>
<seg id="1454">"the group of Luisenhotels with Managing Director Birgit Scherer, based in Bad Bergzabern, has acquired the former Hotel Birkenhof at a voluntary auction in Berlin and wants to make it a house of the three-star Plus category under the name Waldhotel Luise."</seg>
<seg id="1455">The group has four houses with the Freudenstadt object.</seg>
<seg id="1456">Two of them in Bad Bergzabern and one in Bad Herrenalb.</seg>
<seg id="1457">"hot Hotel Luise, Luisenpark, Parkhotel Luise and now Waldhotel Luise."</seg>
<seg id="1458">"at the earlier hotel Birkenhof are already standing in front of the entrance, and when you enter the house, it becomes clear that extensive renovation works will be made."</seg>
<seg id="1459">"the floors were torn out, ceilings were dismantled, old bathtubs removed from the rooms."</seg>
<seg id="1460">The entire hotel building is a single construction site.</seg>
<seg id="1461">There is still much to do until March.</seg>
<seg id="1462">"it is actually a nice place," says Thomas Scherer in conversation with our newspaper. "</seg>
<seg id="1463">Everything is to be renewed in the Black Forest style.</seg>
<seg id="1464">"the rooms are equipped with large walk-in showers, the entrance area will be redesigned, new windows will be installed."</seg>
<seg id="1465">"everything should be" "pretty bourgeois" "later, as Thomas Scherer expresses."</seg>
<seg id="1466">"" "we want to make a piece of jewelry out." ""</seg>
<seg id="1467">"swimming pool, wellness area and conference room are part of the equipment."</seg>
<seg id="1468">"they don't want to position themselves at the high level of the hotels in Lauterbad, but already on a high-level downtown level, Scherer emphasizes."</seg>
<seg id="1469">"the Waldhotel Luise, with its approximately 60 rooms, wants to grow wide, explains Scherer further."</seg>
<seg id="1470">"both individual vacationers, groups or businessmen should feel comfortable in the hotel."</seg>
<seg id="1471">"he has already conducted talks with OB Julian Osswald and tourism director Michael Krause, so Scherer."</seg>
<seg id="1472">The idea of the city coincide with those of the hotel group.</seg>
<seg id="1473">"we are on the same line."</seg>
<seg id="1474">"according to the level of investment, Thomas Scherer doesn't want to define exactly."</seg>
<seg id="1475">"just under a million euros, he counts."</seg>
<seg id="1476">"also the external systems are brought forward to the front man, which is already clearly visible."</seg>
<seg id="1477">"in a courtyard, a large terrace is created, which will be accessible from the restaurant, which is open to public."</seg>
<seg id="1478">Thomas Scherer is optimistic: "Freudenstadt is a good market."</seg>
<seg id="1479">Russia affair: us Special Investigator sets Grand Jury</seg>
<seg id="1480">"in the Russia affair around US President Donald Trump, special mediator Robert Mueller is supposed to have used a so-called Grand Jury after a report."</seg>
<seg id="1481">"over the past few weeks, the Board accepted the work, wrote the" Wall Street Journal "calling on the matter of familiar people."</seg>
<seg id="1482">The paper evaluates the step as a sign that Mueller has expanded and intensified its investigations.</seg>
<seg id="1483">"the CNN reported, there are already preliminary charges of the Gremium in connection with a meeting between Trumps of the oldest son and a Russian attorney."</seg>
<seg id="1484">U.S. intelligence services accuse the Kremlin for a long time to deliberately intervene in the 2016 presidential campaign.</seg>
<seg id="1485">Mueller examines whether there were agreements between Trump's electoral campaign team and Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="1486">The focus of the investigations shall be several men who acted as advisers of the Republicans in the election campaign.</seg>
<seg id="1487">"according to reports, Mueller also took more and more Trumps privates and business environments under the microscope."</seg>
<seg id="1488">"the" "Washington Post" "wrote a few weeks ago that the Sonderer Trump personally picked up Trump personally and investigate the reproach if the President could not hinder the judiciary in the course of the affair."</seg>
<seg id="1489">The main task of Grand Jury is to examine the present evidence in possible crime cases and decide whether it is to be charged.</seg>
<seg id="1490">Grand Jurys are therefore also called the counts of the indictment.</seg>
<seg id="1491">"in most cases, they are turned on when it comes to larger and controversial cases."</seg>
<seg id="1492">The procedure is always carried out behind closed doors.</seg>
<seg id="1493">The committee can also be turned on by the public prosecutor to charge people for hearing under oath.</seg>
<seg id="1494">"according to the radio station CNN, pre-invitations were issued which revolve around the encounter between Donald Trump Jr. and a Russian attorney."</seg>
<seg id="1495">People who were involved in the meeting were asked for a statement called it in the report.</seg>
<seg id="1496">"in addition, they should provide documents."</seg>
<seg id="1497">"in addition to Trump Jr., Trumps were advisers and son-in-law Jared Kushner as well as his former election campaign Paul Manafort during the interview."</seg>
<seg id="1498">"legal experts said on Thursday evening in US television that the entry indicates that Mueller would not be intimidated in his work, and that he should act quickly in his work."</seg>
<seg id="1499">"however, it does not necessarily mean that the Grand Jury will be turned on at the end to decide on the collection of an indictment."</seg>
<seg id="1500">"nevertheless, the establishment of the committee is the beginning of a new phase in the investigations and a new reason for concern for President Trump."</seg>
<seg id="1501">"in the midst of the new revelations, the President made a speech in West Virginia to present the Russia affair as a campaign of his political opponents."</seg>
<seg id="1502">"the Russia story is a total invention," "said Trump."</seg>
<seg id="1503">"the topic gives the democrats a way to feel good, because they have nothing else to talk about."</seg>
<seg id="1504">His special advisor Ty Cobb explained in an opinion that he didn't know anything about setting up a Grand Jury.</seg>
<seg id="1505">"but this work usually works in secret, he stressed."</seg>
<seg id="1506">The White House forbids any measures which accelerated the work of the special agent on a "fair" way.</seg>
<seg id="1507">The former FBI chief James Comey stated three times that not against the president.</seg>
<seg id="1508">"one has no reason to assume that something changed, it was called on in the explanation."</seg>
<seg id="1509">But Mueller was only used after Trump Comey fired.</seg>
<seg id="1510">"because of this rausage, accusations against Trump had become noisy, he wanted to hinder the judiciary."</seg>
<seg id="1511">"Comey said in June in front of a Senate Committee, Trump asked him to recruit the investigations against the national security advisor Michael Flynn."</seg>
<seg id="1512">The President stands under great pressure because of the investigation.</seg>
<seg id="1513">"according to the representation of US media, the White House gathered material against the special agent and its employees."</seg>
<seg id="1514">The dissolved speculation about whether Trump Mueller wants to release.</seg>
<seg id="1515">"unlike an independent investigator of the Congress, such as in the Watergate affair around the later resigned president Richard Nixon, Mueller has a position in which he could theoretically be taxed by the President of the Ministry of Justice."</seg>
<seg id="1516">Several senators of both parties want to prevent such a step.</seg>
<seg id="1517">"two groups of republican and democratic senators put laws on Thursday, after which the special mediator could no longer be dismissed."</seg>
<seg id="1518">Antarctica: giant iceberg drives in the Antarctica</seg>
<seg id="1519">"in the Western Antarctic, a gigantic iceberg has been replaced by the barely seven-fold size of Berlin."</seg>
<seg id="1520">This was announced by the Bremerhavener Alfred-Wegener-Institute for Polar and Marine Research on Wednesday.</seg>
<seg id="1521">"the big Koloss is driving over a trillion ton and 5800 square kilometers, and will probably need two, three years until it was melted."</seg>
<seg id="1522">"with 175 kilometres of length and a width of up to 50 kilometres, it is one of the biggest ice-giants who have registered in the past three decades."</seg>
<seg id="1523">There is no danger for people from him.</seg>
<seg id="1524">"to what extent climate change has played a role in breaking the iceberg, is unclear according to research data."</seg>
<seg id="1525">"in total, however, there has been a series of unusual breakthroughs in the region for about 30 years, writes the US research center for snow and ice (NSIDC) in a fact background."</seg>
<seg id="1526">"according to many researchers, this could be related to global warming."</seg>
<seg id="1527">The now broken colossus was a part of the Larsen-C-Schelfeis.</seg>
<seg id="1528">Schelfeis floats on the sea and is fed by large glaciers.</seg>
<seg id="1529">It continues to grow into the sea and breaks regularly.</seg>
<seg id="1530">Larsen-C-Schelfeis is located south of South America almost at the head of the Antarctic Peninsula.</seg>
<seg id="1531">"North of this peeling, the balance of waxes and breaking-off was disturbed several years ago."</seg>
<seg id="1532">"a complete shaper is broken down there, writes AWI-researcher Daniela Jansen."</seg>
<seg id="1533">"there is a lot to do that also the Larsen-C-Schelfeis is in danger, as the front edge has never been withdrawn as far as it is."</seg>
<seg id="1534">"in addition, the iron plate stands under tension and can be broken down, if at a key point a piece is broken."</seg>
<seg id="1535">The melting of Schelfeis and Eisberg does not increase sea level as they float on the water and water as much water as it yields after melting itself.</seg>
<seg id="1536">"however, the loss of the shellfish leads to the fact that the glaciers can flow directly into the sea and flow much faster than before."</seg>
<seg id="1537">"this could possibly increase sea level, but only in low dimensions, the British research project writes to the observation of Antarctica (Midas)."</seg>
<seg id="1538">"according to AWI statements, the Larsen-C-Schelfeis is the fourth largest shelker of Antarctica with nearly 50 000 square kilometres."</seg>
<seg id="1539">"at the transition from the mainland, it is up to 700 meters thick, at the front edge to the free ocean about 200 meters."</seg>
<seg id="1540">There it breaks regularly.</seg>
<seg id="1541">"although it is a natural event and no direct connection to climate change is aware of us, the ice sign comes into a dangerous position," said Martin O'Leary from the British Swansea University. "</seg>
<seg id="1542">"this is the longest withdrawal since the beginning of the records," he also confirmed. "</seg>
<seg id="1543">"among scientists it is controversial whether the Larsen-C Schelfeis will continue to grow again or long-term, and possibly collapsed, his colleague Adrian Luckman said:" our models say that it will be less stable. "</seg>
<seg id="1544">But this development will last decades.</seg>
<seg id="1545">"even though these researchers are unable to decline this gigantic iceberg on climate change, many ice-chovies of the Antarctic Peninsula have fallen apart over the past few decades."</seg>
<seg id="1546">This long finish of the Antarctic stretches in the direction of South America.</seg>
<seg id="1547">"according to data from the research program British Antarctic Survey, the ice surface of the Antarctic Peninsula has decreased by 28 000 square kilometres since the 1950s."</seg>
<seg id="1548">"as a result, the increase in temperature increased."</seg>
<seg id="1549">"over the last 50 years, the Antarctic Peninsula warmed around three degrees and thus count towards the areas in which the temperature is fastest."</seg>
<seg id="1550">CDU wants to protect Haustarif in personnel</seg>
<seg id="1551">"because it becomes increasingly difficult to occupy vacant positions, the CDU, from the employers' association, urges to become more attractive."</seg>
<seg id="1552">"only shortly before the summer break, 41 new places in the administration have been forced through the administration."</seg>
<seg id="1553">More than 1100 employees and officials work for the district administration in Mettmann.</seg>
<seg id="1554">"now, 17 apprentices left their first working day."</seg>
<seg id="1555">The apprenticeships in the circle are obviously very coveted.</seg>
<seg id="1556">Around 620 applications were recorded for the places that were given this year.</seg>
<seg id="1557">"nevertheless, the circle still lacks staff to cope with the increased requirements and tasks."</seg>
<seg id="1558">"at present, there are still 50 not occupied places at the Mettmann district."</seg>
<seg id="1559">"among other things, doctors and engineers as well as forces of general administration are sought."</seg>
<seg id="1560">The CDU wants to take the initiative together with the FDP and the UWG and oppose the shortage of skilled workers in the administration.</seg>
<seg id="1561">"according to the wish of the parties, the administration will develop a concept for recruiting personnel and personnel development."</seg>
<seg id="1562">"the aim is to not only cover short-term requirements for skilled workers, but to counteract forward-looking scarcity shortages, it is said."</seg>
<seg id="1563">"the overall concept should be oriented towards the inside and the outside, showing concrete measures for cross starters and involve an education offensive, demand CDU, FDP and UWG."</seg>
<seg id="1564">This sounds like a good approach.</seg>
<seg id="1565">Because the circle has to do with personnel problems that you did not know earlier.</seg>
<seg id="1566">Other cities promote good officials and employees and offer more attractive conditions.</seg>
<seg id="1567">"the speech is of a real" "competition for public employers." ""</seg>
<seg id="1568">"in addition, a high number of employees, the disease or age caused by the service, comes from the service."</seg>
<seg id="1569">So the highest time for action so that no more places remain unoccupied.</seg>
<seg id="1570">"but Klaus-Dieter's people, leader of the CDU, goes beyond the common application with his party."</seg>
<seg id="1571">"he recently caused a faustficate surprise when he publicly questioned human resources, and the remaining parties were astonished."</seg>
<seg id="1572">People want all possibilities to be reviewed which allow a withdrawal from the local employers' association.</seg>
<seg id="1573">"if we do not come to a satisfactory solution here, the county administration should strive with the trade unions - perhaps also in cooperation with the county-affiliated towns - a Haustarif," so people. "</seg>
<seg id="1574">"in this way, the CDU, the employees and officials tried to pay better than it actually foresees the tariff for the public service."</seg>
<seg id="1575">"the salaries are currently prescribed precisely, increases or more money is only when one changes to a higher level that is oriented towards professional years."</seg>
<seg id="1576">But the tasks of the circle have grown more and more over the past few years.</seg>
<seg id="1577">"only a few weeks ago, new rooms had to be set up in which employees take care of the provisions of the new constitutional protection law."</seg>
<seg id="1578">"last but not least by the rising number of asylum seekers, Landrat Thomas Hendele and Kreisdirektor Martin Richter have a problem: they have too little staff."</seg>
<seg id="1579">Italy sharpens the tone to NGO Migrants rescue boats</seg>
<seg id="1580">"Italy has warned NGOs that use lifeboats for migrants in the Mediterranean, warned that they cannot continue this unless they comply with new rules for their operations."</seg>
<seg id="1581">"if NGOs do not sign a new code of conduct, it is difficult to see how they can continue to work," said Minister of Minister Marco Minniti in an interview with the Turin daily La Stampa. "</seg>
<seg id="1582">"Minnitis warning came a day after the Italian authorities had confiscated a boat of the German relief organisation 'Youth Rettet', because their team worked effectively with human traffickers in a way that facilitated illegal immigration."</seg>
<seg id="1583">"the aid organisation, which has only been in operation for a year, refused to express itself to detailed allegations of the Italian Prosecutor Ambrogio Cartosio."</seg>
<seg id="1584">"for us, the salvation of human life remains our top priority. so we are sorry that at the moment we cannot operate in the search and rescue zone," the organization said in a statement on social media. "</seg>
<seg id="1585">"we can only judge all accusations which are currently being raised, after we have collected all the information and assess the situation."</seg>
<seg id="1586">"the Italian authorities had watched the boat from 'Youth Rettet', the Iuventa, since October."</seg>
<seg id="1587">"it is assumed that his crew takes inflatable migrants on board, which can be delivered directly from traffickers, and that the smugglers can go down so that the ships can be used again."</seg>
<seg id="1588">"at least one meeting was supposedly found only 1.3 miles off the Libyan coast, according to the Act of the Prosecutor, whose contents were published by Italian media."</seg>
<seg id="1589">"the occupation is suspected of overcoming over the authority of the Italian coast guard, the rescue operations in the zone for humanitarian reasons and not from any other motives."</seg>
<seg id="1590">"under the Code of Conduct, boats like the Iuventa must have an Italian police officer on board who supervises their activities."</seg>
<seg id="1591">"only three of the nine NGOs who are involved in search and rescue operations have so far been prepared to adhere to the code: save the Children, Moas from Malta and Pro-Activa Open Arms from Spain."</seg>
<seg id="1592">"the latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be considered unnecessary, but acceptable as they would not bring any" substantial changes or disabilities "of their rescue operations."</seg>
<seg id="1593">"among those who refuse to sign, the Nobel Prize Winner organization Doctors Without Borders (MSF)."</seg>
<seg id="1594">"in the meantime, Minniti now said that the number of migrants who arrived in Italy after the rescue measures had decreased dramatically in recent weeks, suggesting that the efforts to strengthen the Libyan coastal balances and cooperation with local mayors have borne fruit."</seg>
<seg id="1595">"in the last days we have begun to see light at the end of the tunnel," "said the minister."</seg>
<seg id="1596">"he announced plans for further talks with Libyan citizens in this month on economic development initiatives and with Chad, Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants entering these countries hoping to reach Europe."</seg>
<seg id="1597">Ascents and Trials</seg>
<seg id="1598">"nine Weilermer Biker, the" Berliner Aussenposten "and two hostesses met in Wachenheim in the Nordpfalz region for four days to enjoy Trials and Sights."</seg>
<seg id="1599">Three befriended guides were available for this.</seg>
<seg id="1600">The accommodation in the Wachenheimer Tal proved to be a good starting point for the tours.</seg>
<seg id="1601">The Burgundy and Weinfest of Wachenheim was a welcome bonus.</seg>
<seg id="1602">The first tour led to hot summer temperatures along the vineyards to Michaelskapelle above Deidesheim.</seg>
<seg id="1603">"there were viewpoints, partly on towers, from which one could look far above the Pfälzer Forest and the upstream plains."</seg>
<seg id="1604">"in between, there were always lengthy ascents, for which long trials were rewarded."</seg>
<seg id="1605">"on the second day, after Bad Dürkheim, we went to Saline and to the Volksfest Wurstmarkt."</seg>
<seg id="1606">"again, vantage point reached an outlookpoint, connected by" flowige "trials and moderate ascents."</seg>
<seg id="1607">"in the last two days, many altimeters were announced."</seg>
<seg id="1608">"caves, rocks, towers, castles, ruins and chalets brought welcome breaks."</seg>
<seg id="1609">In Bad Dürkheim the bikers inhale in the open-air inhalatorium saline Sole.</seg>
<seg id="1610">Also Neustadt was also controlled.</seg>
<seg id="1611">"after 173 kilometres and almost 4500 metres, the group had met the Pfälzer Wald from its best side - sporty and culturally."</seg>
<seg id="1612">Console instead of lawn - Bundesliga equips for e-sports</seg>
<seg id="1613">"in future, the Sport Stars will sit in front of computer consoles, instead of fighting through the wind and weather over the stadium rascals?"</seg>
<seg id="1614">"fact: e-sports has long since become a serious business, a lucrative business has become a lucrative business - big stars, millions of fans and huge tournaments with high gages."</seg>
<seg id="1615">These have also recognized the first ligaments which are increasingly involved in this field.</seg>
<seg id="1616">"the beginning of 2015 was the VfL Wolfsburg, later the FC Schalke 04 and last the VfB Stuttgart, who founded an e-sports department in mid-July and took two professionals for the computer game FIFA 17 under contract."</seg>
<seg id="1617">"we hope to inspire new young audiences for the VfB," says CEO Jochen Röttgermann. "</seg>
<seg id="1618">"he is sure," that a number of associations still climb on this train. "</seg>
<seg id="1619">"next weekend, FIFA World Cup organises the first" "Interactive Club World Cup" "in London where the gamers compete against each other."</seg>
<seg id="1620">"in addition to Schalke and Wolfsburg, for example, Manchester City, Paris Saint-Germain or PSV Eindhoven qualified for example."</seg>
<seg id="1621">Robin Dutt also sees great potential in e-sports.</seg>
<seg id="1622">The ex-trainer of Bayer Leverkusen and Werder Bremen now advises an agency for virtual football players.</seg>
<seg id="1623">"the real football has to deal with the 14-30-year-old, that young people will still go into the stadium in the future," says the 52-year-old. "</seg>
<seg id="1624">"and: the clubs tried to conquer all sorts of markets, especially the Asian ones."</seg>
<seg id="1625">"with prominent e-sportsmen under contract, one could be more often present on these markets online more often than to send the Bundesliga to Asia once a year."</seg>
<seg id="1626">What is it all about?</seg>
<seg id="1627">"in the e-sport computer games such as" League Of Legends, "" "Dota 2," "Counterstrike" or even soccer simulations FIFA are on competition level. "</seg>
<seg id="1628">"long ago, as in normal sports, Ligen has become established in which the professionals compete against each other."</seg>
<seg id="1629">E-Sport is already part of the official program at the 2022 events.</seg>
<seg id="1630">But is it a kind of sport at all?</seg>
<seg id="1631">"for many, the idea is certainly most needy."</seg>
<seg id="1632">Ingo Frobffer has also dealt with the question for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="1633">"for Professor at the German Sports academy in Cologne, e-sports is a sport because it is competitive and showing many biological and physical responses that can be found in classic sports such as increased heart rate, stress reactions, hormonal changes."</seg>
<seg id="1634">"in addition, it needs cognitive abilities, a technical and tactical understanding and a fast response ability."</seg>
<seg id="1635">"professional gamers should not only exercise on the console, but also exercise their body and pay attention to the diet."</seg>
<seg id="1636">"the fitty player is a good player."</seg>
<seg id="1637">"but Frobing also sees problems:" "doping is becoming more and more a topic." ""</seg>
<seg id="1638">"controls may be difficult for online games, and in the scene the structures of classic sports were missing."</seg>
<seg id="1639">The scientists emphasise the high integrative effect of e-sports.</seg>
<seg id="1640">"players are on the road internationally, this is like a big global family, there are no cross-cultural barriers."</seg>
<seg id="1641">A study conducted by the Advisory Service Deloitte and the Federal Association Interaktive Programmer Software (BIU) predicts rapid growth ahead of e-sports.</seg>
<seg id="1642">"in 2016, 50 million euros were implemented in Germany, mainly on advertising, sponsorship and big tournaments."</seg>
<seg id="1643">"in three years, sales should be 130 million."</seg>
<seg id="1644">"against the almost 2.4 billion euros of the football league, this is little."</seg>
<seg id="1645">"however, the e-sport is no longer far from the other established sports such as handball, basketball or ice hockey," the Deloitte consultant writes. "</seg>
<seg id="1646">International are many countries already.</seg>
<seg id="1647">"big markets are Asia and the USA, where ex-basketball players Shaquille O'Neal and Baseballstar Alex Rodriguez are participating in the US team NRG eSports."</seg>
<seg id="1648">Hollywood actors Ashton Kutcher invests in the e-sports competition Univern.</seg>
<seg id="1649">"in Europe, too, there is a lot of things."</seg>
<seg id="1650">"in a Norwegian school, e-sports has been introduced as a classroom, says Fungsten."</seg>
<seg id="1651">"in the Netherlands and France, the soccer league clubs are obliged to set up an e-sports department according to Dutt."</seg>
<seg id="1652">"in the European comparison, Germany lags behind," explains VfB-Management Röttgermann. "</seg>
<seg id="1653">"just to fall into nostalgia, and to clarify the old times, it is no longer enough today."</seg>
<seg id="1654">"it is a matter of preserving the tradition of the association, but at the same time to align the company on the modern market."</seg>
<seg id="1655">"we live in a digitised world," "says Dutt."</seg>
<seg id="1656">"you cannot keep in mind that only in football everything remains, as it always was."</seg>

<seg id="1661">Michelle Carter for the lyrics to push the Conrad Roy to suicide</seg>
<seg id="1662">A woman from Massachusetts was sentenced to two and a half years because she encouraged her friend through texts and calls to suicide.</seg>
<seg id="1663">"Michelle Carter, now 20, will spend 15 months of her conviction behind bars and five years were suspended."</seg>
<seg id="1664">Carter was sentenced to death in June because of negligent killing of Conrad Roy who took his life on 13 July 2014.</seg>
<seg id="1665">The father of Roy said on Thursday at the hearing: "my family is uncomforting.</seg>
<seg id="1666">My son was my best friend. "</seg>
<seg id="1667">Carter was allowed to stay free until his vocation.</seg>
<seg id="1668">"she had been confronted with a maximum penalty of 20 years, but her legal representatives argued that both she and Mr Roy suffered from a mental illness."</seg>
<seg id="1669">"dressed in red pants and a cream coloured blouse, Carter stood there with tears in the eyes, with folded hands and downward eyes when she was convicted."</seg>
<seg id="1670">"her actions have killed Conrad Roy," "said the prosecutor."</seg>
<seg id="1671">She finished his life to make her own better.</seg>
<seg id="1672">"she has no responsibility," she said. "</seg>
<seg id="1673">"she has not shown any remorse." ""</seg>
<seg id="1674">"but Carters attorney said it was a" "terrible circumstance, which they really regret." ""</seg>
<seg id="1675">"judge Lawrence Moniz said, however, he did not find out that their" age or maturity "or even their mental illness have a significant impact on their actions."</seg>
<seg id="1676">A prosecutor read a statement by Roys's mother Lynn Roy who said that "there is no day on which I do not pray the loss of my beloved son.</seg>
<seg id="1677">"I want him to be proud of me and how I surround myself with everything. I try, despite all my pain, which we will carry for eternity with us, to be there for his sisters," it says. "</seg>
<seg id="1678">"Roys's sister, Camdyn Roy, said that she was" "persecuted by the realization" "that she would never be part of the wedding of her brother or be a aunt for his children."</seg>
<seg id="1679">"no longer this single person, having been together since my birth every day, is a pain that I will keep with myself for the rest of my life," she said. "</seg>
<seg id="1680">"the case seems to place a legal precedent because there is no law in Massachusetts, which makes it a crime to ask another to commit suicide."</seg>
<seg id="1681">Carter was 17 years old when Roy found dead from a carbon monoxide poisoning in a vehicle in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="1682">"the case attracted national attention, after Carters revealed text announcements that she encouraged him to end his life."</seg>
<seg id="1683">"hang on, spring from a building, stab yourself, I don't know there are many ways," "she said in several news that she had sent in the two weeks before his death, while he was on vacation with his family."</seg>
<seg id="1684">"in the eyes before his suicide she wrote:" you must do it, Conrad "and" All you need to do is to turn off the generator and you will be free and happy. "</seg>
<seg id="1685">"Judge Moniz said that Carter paid attention to Roy's death, and ordered that she should benefit from the case through any press."</seg>
<seg id="1686">The case has divided the legal opinion.</seg>
<seg id="1687">"one of the few who defended Carter was Amanda Knox, who was convicted in 2007 because of the murder of her British roommate in Italy before being acquitted two years ago."</seg>
<seg id="1688">"Ms. Knox, 30 years old, published a comment in the Los Angeles Times:" Michelle Carter deserves compassion and help, not jail. "</seg>

<seg id="1695">"good, the entry could have been better than at 0: 2 against the SSC Naples."</seg>
<seg id="1696">But the sign of the coach Kimme also could interpret.</seg>
<seg id="1697">"not the eight year older Arturo Vidal was chosen as a game leader in the C-Elf pros made from youth players, debut and straight out of the holiday."</seg>
<seg id="1698">"it is best to distribute sugars to those, to whom one wants to breed a lot, which one wants to keep in mood."</seg>
<seg id="1699">Those who were chosen to compete for the legacy of Lahm can only use a little extra motivation.</seg>
<seg id="1700">"Kimme confirmed:" "that's what you want as a player: take responsibility."</seg>
<seg id="1701">On Wednesday the 22-year-old flattened as a mini-lame over the field.</seg>
<seg id="1702">"right back, this is now its position, the white bark at the arm did the rest."</seg>
<seg id="1703">And at all Kimme worked in this start-up like the one who can best take the helm in his hand.</seg>
<seg id="1704">"he gave instructions, tried to steer the innocent troupe."</seg>
<seg id="1705">He had the view of the whole while many others were occupied with himself.</seg>
<seg id="1706">"Vidal thus to replay his missing fitness (foldable hardly); Renato Sanches with it, on the devil come out to join the achievements of the Asia journey (folks also only conditionally); and Sebastian Rudy and Niklas Süle have no negative impact in their first appearance in Bavaria-Trikot."</seg>
<seg id="1707">"after all, it worked quite well."</seg>
<seg id="1708">"addicted to Kimme, Rudy before the defense, both acted confidently."</seg>
<seg id="1709">"the well-known Napoli storm was often difficult, and Süle tried a few times in the game building."</seg>
<seg id="1710">Although his colleague Rudy admitted that the result was not as we hoped for.</seg>
<seg id="1711">But he also showed a proper performance at the debut.</seg>
<seg id="1712">"shift, tempo change:" for this style I was also fetched. "</seg>
<seg id="1713">"as unaccustomed to this Bavarian world still for the new entrances, one saw in the connection to the game."</seg>
<seg id="1714">"for example, Rudy was not one or two in the catacombs, but surely six or seven interviews."</seg>
<seg id="1715">Kimme said goodbye to a few crisp statements on the back of his new fellow players.</seg>
<seg id="1716">"there he heard an interesting sentence from Süle:" "what is going on here I already noted."</seg>
<seg id="1717">"with Bavaria, you simply have to win every game."</seg>

<seg id="1726">"it was often irreconcilable, the relationship between the country and the regional economy, when Eveline Lemke (Green) still was an economic minister of Rhineland-Palatinate."</seg>
<seg id="1727">This is reflected more than a year in which the new business minister Volker Wissing (FDP) is in office.</seg>
<seg id="1728">Chambers and companies from the region speak on T V request from a change in economic policy - and at the same time the old ministers.</seg>
<seg id="1729">"Frank natus, Chairman of the Association of Trierer Enterprises (VTU), says:" Wissing attacks the wishes of the economy, which Lemke all has blocked. "</seg>

<seg id="1733">"the goal is to put the line in operation in December 2020, says Ministerial Director Cornelia Holtmann."</seg>
<seg id="1734">"natus sees it a sign to support regional, but internationally competitive companies."</seg>

<seg id="1754">None of the companies described the undertakings as recall.</seg>
<seg id="1755">European car manufacturers have strongly encouraged the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support compliance with rules for carbon dioxide emissions.</seg>

<seg id="1759">"the companies are trying to avoid the faults of Volkswagen, which could regulate the use of so-called depreciation equipment that could regulate emissions in order to comply with the regulations when a car was tested, but in case of normal driving conditions."</seg>
<seg id="1760">"in the United States several employees were indicted by Volkswagen, others are examined on both sides of the Atlantic."</seg>

<seg id="1779">"his message: laughter," "for there is too much suffering in the world." ""</seg>
<seg id="1780">Guillermo Mordillo was born on 4 August 1932 as the son of Spanish immigrants in Buenos Aires.</seg>
<seg id="1781">"in the first years as an artist, he presented himself as a drawing for congratulation cards - what frustrated him."</seg>
<seg id="1782">"the happiest day in my professional life was the day when I lost my job," he once said. "</seg>
<seg id="1783">"after stops in Lima, New York and Paris reached the end of the 1960s the breakthrough: with the release of his cartoons in" Paris Match, "and then also in the" star "and other leading magazines around the world."</seg>
<seg id="1784">Even in China Mordillo found many fans.</seg>
<seg id="1785">"again and again, the artist was inspired by cities."</seg>
<seg id="1786">"large, round Mordillo figures tumble in drawings with the Leaning Tower of Pisa, Big Ben in London and the Red Square in Moscow."</seg>
<seg id="1787">"in the early morning, according to his own specification, he still sits at the drawing table, working every day for almost ten hours."</seg>
<seg id="1788">"with calendars, puzzles, books for young and old, t-shirts, plush favorites and watches, its drolly figures continue to spread worldwide."</seg>

<seg id="1796">"he has become a symbol of Provence in the South of France, but there is a warning that it is threatened by climate change."</seg>
<seg id="1797">"the lavender is declining because of the conditions that are reminiscent of drought conditions and because of diseases, which scientists and farmers trying to find solutions, great headaches are prepared."</seg>
<seg id="1798">"Eric Chaisse, expert at the Agricultural Research Institute, CRIEPPAM in Provence, said:" "the lavender in Provence has been effectively endangered because the plant has been exposed to climate change over the past few years, which in spring has brought much less rain and much more in the autumn."</seg>
<seg id="1799">This has effects on the life span of lavender.</seg>
<seg id="1800">"there is also a small cicade, a micro-bacterium that transmits dwarf zipper, and with very dry weather there are many of them."</seg>
<seg id="1801">And there is much in the game.</seg>
<seg id="1802">Lavender oil is not only relaxed for holidaymakers; it is also very popular for perfume and cosmetics.</seg>
<seg id="1803">"Eric Chaisse said:" instead of having very long plant tubes with a large number of flowers, we have smaller, underdeveloped and either missing or weakened. "</seg>

<seg id="1809">The assassination of a journalist emphasizes the growing threat in Mexico</seg>
<seg id="1810">"the staff of the weekly Riodoce normally meet on Wednesdays to check their plans for reporting on the recent chaos in the state of Sinaloa, through organised crime, corrupt officials and incessant drug wars."</seg>
<seg id="1811">"but on that day, in the shadow of their own tragedy, they came together to talk about security."</seg>
<seg id="1812">They told them that it is important to change their routines.</seg>
<seg id="1813">"two high-level journalists will discuss what feels more secure: they are supposed to take their children into the office, which were in 2009 the goal of an attack with grenades, or leave them at home."</seg>
<seg id="1814">"security experts have written three words on a tablet at the front of the room: opponents, neutrals, allies."</seg>
<seg id="1815">"you ask the Reporter to propose names for each column - no evidence is needed, perceptions and gut feelings."</seg>
<seg id="1816">"there are drug smugglers, politicians, businessmen, journalists who are suspected of standing on the paylist of the government or cartels, a catalogue of criminals which make the chaos of Mexico dangerous."</seg>
<seg id="1817">"there is no break from violence, and while in the whole country there are more journalists: at least 25, since President Enrique Pena Nieto took office in December 2012, and until now there have been at least seven deaths in seven countries."</seg>
<seg id="1818">"among the latter is her editor and her inspiration from Riodoce, co-founder Javier Valdez Cardenas."</seg>
<seg id="1819">"the greatest mistake is to live in Mexico and be a journalist," Valdez wrote in one of his numerous books on violence in connection with drugs. "</seg>
<seg id="1820">"two reporters in the thirties, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, carry t-shirts, which show his smiling face with glasses or his typical panamahut."</seg>
<seg id="1821">"the workshop takes place less than two months after his death, and the reporters discuss their shared themes, trauma, their nightmares, sleeplessness, paranoia."</seg>
<seg id="1822">"although a Sonder Attorney was established in 2010 to deal with the cases of journalists, this according to the Committee for the Protection of Journalists only initiated two criminal proceedings."</seg>
<seg id="1823">"as with most thousands of murders associated with drug trafficking and organised crime, the murderers of journalists are rarely brought to court."</seg>
<seg id="1824">"at Riodoce they still insist on treating the violence of Sinaloa, although they are not comforting and although the terrain is still more treacherous."</seg>
<seg id="1825">"without information about the murderers, without justice, the meeting for discussion of safety has little benefit, says Ibarra."</seg>
<seg id="1826">"it is very stupid to waste my time in this workshop," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="1827">"as long as we don't know why, we digest all."</seg>
<seg id="1828">"in the morning of May 15, Valdez left the office of the newspaper Riodoce in the province capital of Culiacan."</seg>
<seg id="1829">"he only managed to drive a few blocks far before his red Toyota Corolla was forced by two men. he was forced from his car and 12 times was shot on him, probably due to the name of the newspaper - which is translated with" Zwölfter Fluss. ""</seg>
<seg id="1830">The Sagittarius drove away in his car and damaged it nearby.</seg>
<seg id="1831">Valdez was 50 years old.</seg>
<seg id="1832">He left a woman and two adult children.</seg>
<seg id="1833">Rumors tend to fly freely in Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1834">"but on the topic of Valdez, there is practically nothing to silence."</seg>
<seg id="1835">"since Guzman's arrest last year and extradition in the United States in January, Sinaloa became one of the bloodiest battlefields of the country since rival factions are fighting here to fill the vacuum."</seg>
<seg id="1836">"it does not matter that in Sinaloa anyone or more people are shot on the road, or that the cemetery is full of decorated, two-storey mouths for drug-kings that are bigger than many homes for the living."</seg>
<seg id="1837">"forget for a minute that there is a state of" tranquility, "if only a cartel has control over the coastal state with its valuable harbours and drug trade routes to the United States."</seg>
<seg id="1838">"nevertheless, despite the fact that Valdez was aware of the dangers of his work, Ismail Bojorquez (60), a co-founder and director of Riodoce, was broken with the guilt that he could not protect his friend."</seg>
<seg id="1839">He believes that two misconceptions have contributed to the murder.</seg>
<seg id="1840">"first of all, in February the publication of an interview with Damasco Lopez, a leader of one of the rival carton fractions in the war with Guzman's sons."</seg>
<seg id="1841">"this publication may have annoyed the children, presumed vein members bought each copy of the issue as soon as they were delivered to newspaper kiosks."</seg>
<seg id="1842">"the second fault was to not force Valdez, following the confiscation of another newspaper that had published the same story to leave the country for its own security."</seg>
<seg id="1843">"Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his killing is regarded as a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists."</seg>
<seg id="1844">He had survived so long that his friends and colleagues accepted that he would always be there.</seg>
<seg id="1845">"he worked as an experienced reporter for Noroeste in 2003, when he joined with five colleagues for the establishment of Riodoce and sold 50 US dollars."</seg>
<seg id="1846">"in Sinaloa, it was impossible to pursue journalism without encountering the problem of smoking," Bojorquez said. "</seg>
<seg id="1847">"with time, the newspaper has earned a reputation for courageous and honest reporting, and sales and advertising took place."</seg>
<seg id="1848">"reporters loved to be able to publish tough examinations without fear of censorship, and readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that no one else dared to deal with."</seg>
<seg id="1849">"eight years after the establishment of Riodoce, she received the prestigious" Maria-Moors-Cabot Prize "for their coverage in Latin America."</seg>
<seg id="1850">"in the same year, Valdez won the 'International Press Freedom Award' of the Committee to protect journalists for his courage in the persecution of Mexican drug history, wherever it led."</seg>
<seg id="1851">He volunteered to be afraid.</seg>
<seg id="1852">"I would like to continue living," he said at the time of CPJ. "</seg>
<seg id="1853">"drug trafficking in Sinaloa" is a way of life, "he said last October in an interview with Rompeviento-TV."</seg>
<seg id="1854">You have to take over the task that you consider as a journalist - either this or you play the dummy.</seg>
<seg id="1855">"I don't want to be asked," "What did you do in the face of so many dead... why did you not say what went ahead?"</seg>
<seg id="1856">"the Riodoce team missed Valdez, the Spaßvogel, who was cursed as a harbour worker, the friend, who was generous with hugs and advice, a teacher who knew how to survive."</seg>
<seg id="1857">They trusted in his routine.</seg>
<seg id="1858">He would always wear his hat.</seg>
<seg id="1859">"he would always go to El Guayabo, the bar opposite the office, and always sit at the same table there."</seg>
<seg id="1860">Now they ask: was his love for routine his destruction?</seg>
<seg id="1861">His death also forced her to ask her own assumptions about how to do her work best and stay alive.</seg>
<seg id="1862">"they don't like it if you deal with their wives, their children, their clean shops, their secret runways and runways to move drugs."</seg>
<seg id="1863">"these things were not allowed," "said Bojorquez."</seg>
<seg id="1864">"the result is, even in the best times, a high level of self-censorship and self-preservation."</seg>
<seg id="1865">Trust his own instincts.</seg>
<seg id="1866">"if it smells falsely, stay away from it."</seg>
<seg id="1867">"the annoyance is, the editor of the Feodoce Andres Villarreal said that" smell is a sense that can be deceived... and then things happened to Javier. "</seg>
<seg id="1868">"the old rules, as he and others say, are no longer valid in Sinaloa - just as in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states in which a poisonous mix of lucrative smuggling routes, weak institutions and corrupt government officials are at home."</seg>
<seg id="1869">The landscape is changing constantly.</seg>
<seg id="1870">"in the room where the staff of Riodoce met for safety training, there were suddenly no mobile phones allowed. days before, it became known that Spyware, which is sold solely to governments, was used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico."</seg>
<seg id="1871">"outside, two police officers tried shelter from the heat of 104 degrees (40 ° C) in the shade of a tree."</seg>
<seg id="1872">They were commissioned by the provincial government to protect the offices of Riodoce in a four-story building in a mid-range neighborhood of Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1873">"half in the joke, some of the reporters asked if these officers belong to the 50 percent of the police officers, which the governor himself described as untrustworthy."</seg>
<seg id="1874">"it is months since reporters went into the mountain landscape, where the drug gangs are facto under control."</seg>
<seg id="1875">"for the issue of this week, Riodoce has printed on three main stories."</seg>
<seg id="1876">There was the assassination of brother of the former known speaker Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa.</seg>
<seg id="1877">They also had an exposure to the public expenditure that concentrated on the hometown of the Governor.</seg>
<seg id="1878">"there was a group in one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan, a souvenir sheet from the office of the Prosecutor."</seg>
<seg id="1879">"there was no official word about who was kidnapped or how it happened, so be careful when it was time to write what everyone knows in the city: that the restaurant is a favorite local of drug dealers and authorities."</seg>
<seg id="1880">"a reporter came from public records, that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician who ruled out the ruling Institutional Revolution Party (PRI), which dominated all political levels almost all the century."</seg>
<seg id="1881">Recently several PRI governors were accused of high-caliber cases of corruption.</seg>
<seg id="1882">"Villarreal asked the reporter to write about previous incidents in this locality, including one in which a son of" El Chapo "Guzman escaped a military assault."</seg>
<seg id="1883">Only a few months earlier the readers of Valdez had considered the best informed source of the kidnapping.</seg>
<seg id="1884">"earlier we had known what happened," said Villarreal, 46, with the nickname "El Flaco" because of his slender body statur. "</seg>
<seg id="1885">"now, all channels of communication with our sources are broken."</seg>
<seg id="1886">"Valdez's office was dedicated to storage box for signs and stickers dedicated to the murders of journalists, because the employees have become something they had never expected: activists in the name of the press."</seg>
<seg id="1887">Reporter Miriam Ramirez grabbed a few signs and went to a demonstration next morning for a further journalist for the office of the prosecutor.</seg>
<seg id="1888">Salvador Adame disappeared three days after Valdez had been killed in the western state of Michoacan.</seg>
<seg id="1889">A burned body was discovered and officials say based on DNA tests that it is its.</seg>
<seg id="1890">"in the whole country, journalists have become louder, written in organized protests" "SOS Press" "on walkways and buildings."</seg>
<seg id="1891">"on this day, the director Bojorquez went away in Washington and tries to collect international support for the judiciary in the case of Valdez."</seg>
<seg id="1892">"at a meeting with the governor of Sinaloa on the day following the assassination of Valdez, Ramirez accused the authorities to spy out journalists and kill them, because they said the truth."</seg>
<seg id="1893">"it has been asked since then that it is once again divided by the government, because it is concerned that its anger has violated its objectivity."</seg>
<seg id="1894">"Valdez had repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico were surrounded by organised crime, involved government officials and a indifferent society."</seg>
<seg id="1895">"in his last book" Narco-Journalism, "he wrote that reporters were not only killed by drug gangs, but also on the command of politicians and security forces that were infected with organised crime under a blanket."</seg>
<seg id="1896">"the" Articulo 19 "media group, more than half of the attacks on journalists of the police and officials, were assigned more than half of the attacks."</seg>
<seg id="1897">"in Mexico you die because they want you to keep your mouth," "said Ramirez."</seg>
<seg id="1898">"obviously, the killings have a deterrent effect."</seg>
<seg id="1899">Nobody forgets the death of the blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias in the northern border of Tamaulipas six years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1900">"your body was found together with a note, supposedly signed by the Zetas Kartell:" here I am because of my reports. "</seg>
<seg id="1901">A computer keyboard and headphones lay next to their separate head.</seg>

<seg id="1903">Others continue to make El Manana of Nuevo Laredo after the assassination of her director in 2004.</seg>
<seg id="1904">"in 2010, the Diario de Ciudad Juarez publicly addressed the drug cartels with a editorial on the title page with the heading" What do you want from us? "</seg>
<seg id="1905">Some journalists have fled from their home states or even from the country.</seg>
<seg id="1906">It is a painful decision.</seg>
<seg id="1907">"it is hard to find work in exile, and they still watch the streets and look for dangers."</seg>
<seg id="1908">"and sometimes they are hunted as it was apparently murdered by the photographer Ruben Espinosa, who was murdered in 2015 together with four women in an apartment in Mexico City three months after the escape from Veracruz."</seg>
<seg id="1909">"for those who stay behind and continue to work, it is a daily dance with risky decisions."</seg>
<seg id="1910">"Ibarra, who once wanted to be poets, admits that drug trafficking was frightened."</seg>
<seg id="1911">"Mexico goes to hell, and that's why I became reporter," he said. "</seg>
<seg id="1912">"at midnight on the last Friday, when the last issue was already finished, the editors of Riodoce sat in front of the office and drinking beer, when all their phones began to sum."</seg>
<seg id="1913">A series of shootings with tapestrival and security forces near the Mazatlan swimming pool had left 19 confirmed deaths.</seg>
<seg id="1914">The war continued escalating as promised by a number of Kartell messages in the region.</seg>
<seg id="1915">From the on-board edge they published the news on the website of Riodoce on mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="1916">The front page had to be changed the next day.</seg>
<seg id="1917">Sirens heulled nearby - a further shooting in the area.</seg>

<seg id="1919">"if they were afraid at all, they did not show it."</seg>
<seg id="1920">"under the massive portrait of the fallen founder of the newspaper, whose middle finger was visible for the whole of Sinaloa, the staff of Riodoce followed his mark."</seg>

<seg id="1926">"the report in the journal" Current Biology, "described him as" the immortal armoured dinosaur, who has ever been found, and one of the best dinosaur copies in the world. "</seg>

<seg id="1928">"his unbelievably well preserved state has researchers, who described it as" truly remarkable "," amazingly "</seg>
<seg id="1929">According to reports in National Geographic the armored herbivores is the best preserved fossil of its kind.</seg>
<seg id="1930">"it was found by Shawn Funk, when he died on 21 March 2011 at the Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta, Canada."</seg>
<seg id="1931">"he met on something that was lacking from the surrounding rock at the plateau, and decided to look more closely."</seg>
<seg id="1932">The Fossil discovered by him was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology.</seg>
<seg id="1933">"they spent the next six years to expose the wild beast within the 2,500 pounds (1,100 kg) of heavy peanut."</seg>
<seg id="1934">"after all this hard work, the finished result is now ready to be revealed."</seg>
<seg id="1935">"if you blink only a little with the eyes, you could almost believe it slept," said the main author Caleb Brown, scientist at the Royal Tyrrell Museum where the creature is to be seen. "</seg>
<seg id="1936">"it will enter the science history as one of the most beautiful and best preserved dinosaurs copies, the Mona Lisa of the dinosaurs."</seg>
<seg id="1937">"researchers have found that this herbivores, although it is covered with a armor and resembles a changing tank, probably threatened by carnivorous dinosaurs."</seg>
<seg id="1938">"the heavily armoured dinosaur used red and white camouflage to hide from predators, and used a shielding technique known as counterfading that is also used by many modern animals."</seg>
<seg id="1939">"this would have allowed to mix better into its surroundings and to avoid enemies, say experts, suggesting that it was threatened by larger dinosaurs."</seg>
<seg id="1940">The 110 million years old creature from the family of the Nodosaurier has made headlines in May and is now seen at the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.</seg>
<seg id="1941">"researchers have now studied the wild animal and called Borealopelta markmitchelli after the Museumstechniker Mark Mitchell, one of a team that has spent more than 7,000 hours with it carefully."</seg>
<seg id="1942">The astonishing maintenance of the specimen enabled Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and the shape of scales and armor over his body.</seg>
<seg id="1943">"they discovered the confusing, a widespread defense method in the animal kingdom, which means that the head of the creature was darker than her underside."</seg>
<seg id="1944">"although the confiscation is customary, the results are surprising as the size of Borealopelta is by far the animals living today."</seg>
<seg id="1945">It indicates that the dinosaur of sufficient pressure was hunted by meat fresher dinosaurs that the evolution favoured the concealment of confrontation as a means of survival.</seg>
<seg id="1946">"but most contemporary animals, who use the consoles - think of roe deer, zebras or belt animals - are much smaller and vulnerable to prey, which signals that this Nodose aurier was subjected to a real fight for survival."</seg>
<seg id="1947">"strong predator behaviour on a massive, heavily armoured dinosaurs show how dangerous the dinosaur predators must have been the retaceous time," said Brown. "</seg>
<seg id="1948">Chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the skin of the dinosaur was bay.</seg>
<seg id="1949">"scientists continue to investigate the animal on his life, including his conserved Darminent to find out what it has eaten as his last meal."</seg>
<seg id="1950">"they believe that the dinosaur, when he died, got into a river and drifted into the sea, where he sank down to the bottom of the sea."</seg>
<seg id="1951">"at that time Alberta was as warm as South-florida today, and rivers and oceans probably spread much further inland than they are today."</seg>
<seg id="1952">"this nodosaurier is truly remarkable because it is completely covered with conserved skin, but also preserved in three dimensions and preserves the original form of the animal," said Brown. "</seg>
<seg id="1953">The result is that the animal looks almost the same today as in the early period of chalk.</seg>
<seg id="1954">"you don't need to use a lot of imagination to reconstruct it. if you only play a little with your eyes, you could almost believe that he is at sleeping."</seg>
<seg id="1955">"the time of chalk was a time when huge thermal diodes, carnivorous dinosaurs standing on two legs crossed the ground."</seg>
<seg id="1956">"although the king of them, the tyrannosaurus Rex lived for millions of years to Borealopelta, the armoured dinosaur was hunted by some of his terrifying ancestors."</seg>
<seg id="1957">"this includes the Acrocanthosaurus, a 38 feet (11,5 m) long, six tons of heavy monsters."</seg>
<seg id="1958">"scientists, whose latest findings appear in the journal Current Biology, believe that Borealopelta sank after death in the sea and was mumified in mud."</seg>
<seg id="1959">"the creature was found by Shawn Funk, when he died on 21 March 2011 at the Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta, Canada."</seg>
<seg id="1960">"according to the museum, it is the immortal armoured dinosaur of the world, including skin and armor, and is completely from the muzzle to the hip."</seg>
<seg id="1961">"the creatures were about 18 feet (5 meters) long and weighed up to 3,000 pounds (1,300 kg)."</seg>
<seg id="1962">It contained two 20-inch long tops that raged from his shoulders.</seg>
<seg id="1963">The researchers believe that the armoured herbivores were swamped by Western Canada until a flooded river flooded it into the open sea.</seg>
<seg id="1964">But the underwater equipment of the dinosaur kept its armor in exquisite detail.</seg>
<seg id="1965">The petrified remnants of this special specimen are so well preserved that the skin trusts still cover bumpy tanks along the dinosaurs.</seg>
<seg id="1966">"as Michael Greshko written for National Geographic, such a level of preservation is as" rare as a win in the lottery. "</seg>
<seg id="1967">"the more I consider it, the more confusing it becomes."</seg>
<seg id="1968">"petrified remnants of the skin still cover the bumpy tanks, which carry the skull of the animal."</seg>

<seg id="1977">"it was moderate to moderate injuries, said a police spokesman."</seg>
<seg id="1978">A large array of bailout vehicles was at the accident site.</seg>

<seg id="1987">It is a moment that almost everyone has ever experienced: nothing is crazy in the train and sleeps.</seg>

<seg id="1992">But the times of interruptions are soon over.</seg>
<seg id="1993">The Deutsche Bahn is currently testing the free ticket inspections.</seg>
<seg id="1994">It is simply confirmed by phone that you take your seat and thus validates the ticket.</seg>
<seg id="1995">"currently, a test run runs on two routes."</seg>
<seg id="1996">"when the offer comes, we will expand it."</seg>
<seg id="1997">"it is expected to be available in Germany at the beginning of next year," "said a railway speaker."</seg>

<seg id="1999">"in order to be able to use them, however, some conditions must be met: you need a smartphone or tablet."</seg>

<seg id="2001">"you also have to buy it via the train, the DB Navigator, which is the most convenient type of ticket booking anyway."</seg>
<seg id="2002">And last but not least you need a seat reservation.</seg>
<seg id="2003">"because the" comfort check-in "works like this: one goes into the train, calls his ticket under" My Tickets. ""</seg>
<seg id="2004">"with the test customers, a button for the electronic devaluation appears."</seg>
<seg id="2005">The train attendants get a message on their mobile devices that passenger X is in the train and took the booked seat Y.</seg>
<seg id="2006">"when carrying out ticket inspection to place Y, he knows that there is a passenger with already paid online ticket."</seg>
<seg id="2007">"so you can continue to sleep, continue to keep silent."</seg>
<seg id="2008">"the" check-in "has two advantages: one for the customer, one for the train - which in turn should use the passengers."</seg>
<seg id="2009">"those who want to travel relaxed without ticketing through our train service personnel, check in the DB Navigator themselves."</seg>
<seg id="2010">"this allows the passengers to make their travel time more personal in the train," says Michael Peterson, Marketing Board of DB Fernverkehr. "</seg>

<seg id="2012">"who often runs train, knows that apart from delays and missed trains the ticket inspections belong to the biggest annoyances."</seg>
<seg id="2013">"for many times, in any case one does not have all the documents necessary for the devaluation of online tickets."</seg>
<seg id="2014">Either the credit card or the identity card or otherwise a document you have to assign.</seg>
<seg id="2015">"the result is endless discussions between train attendants and passenger, which leads to bad mood in the section or large area and delays in controlling their own tickets and the Schaffner at the end takes time to take care of other concerns."</seg>
<seg id="2016">Only a small number of test customers can use the new service.</seg>
<seg id="2017">And that also only on the connections ICE 915 Dortmund-Stuttgart and ICE 912 Stuttgart-Essen.</seg>

<seg id="2025">A user with the Handle @ TheePharoah was constantly saved on their timeline.</seg>
<seg id="2026">"the rapper from the area of St. Louis was the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed black 18 year old, who was killed by a white police officer in Ferguson, Mo."</seg>
<seg id="2027">He posted a picture of Browns lethal body that was stretched out on the road and would stay there four hours.</seg>
<seg id="2028">"this is wild," "thought Ferrell."</seg>
<seg id="2029">But death was nothing new for them and their community.</seg>
<seg id="2030">She put off her cell phone to return to tweets about people on the Canfield Drive in the evening.</seg>
<seg id="2031">"there were photos from the police tape and people crying out, and by a man who claimed to be Browns's father who wore a shield with the inscription:" "Fergusons police killed my unarmed son!" ""</seg>
<seg id="2032">She watched a live feed with which a policeman stood in front of a group of demonstrators with a barking dog.</seg>
<seg id="2033">"in another video, she said, secured another policeman his gun and cried," "I will kill you... animals all." ""</seg>
<seg id="2034">"this is not common," Ferrell remembered her statement. "</seg>
<seg id="2035">This is not the type of murder we have accustomed to and which we can call typical.</seg>
<seg id="2036">At that moment I felt the chills.</seg>
<seg id="2037">I was angry and wept. "</seg>
<seg id="2038">She booked a return flight and went home the next day.</seg>
<seg id="2039">After the landing at 23 o'clock she got her 6 year old daughter from her father's house and decided that the two would go to Ferguson next morning.</seg>
<seg id="2040">"what happened in the next three years with Ferrell and Ferguson, is the theme of a new documentary film," Whose Streets?, "in cinemas from 11."</seg>
<seg id="2041">"it is a history of survival and protest, love and loss, strength and resistance, who are living in the community and filled the streets to demand answers."</seg>
<seg id="2042">"as Ferrell and her daughter, who wore a flower dress and a matching crown to catch Ferguson, the two discussed a conversation that she had countless times before this morning" about the black experience and the black condition. ""</seg>
<seg id="2043">"you remember how I taught you when black people have to fight for what they believe?" "they remembered what she said."</seg>
<seg id="2044">We now go to Ferguson because the police killed an 18 year old boy and that wasn't right.</seg>
<seg id="2045">"I could not take her," "said Ferrell later."</seg>
<seg id="2046">What happened today is a high point of what happened in the past.</seg>
<seg id="2047">It must know and see it and be drawn up in it.</seg>
<seg id="2048">"it must be well developed not only activism and organization, but also the different layers of black experience and the black constitution, and what we need to do to free ourselves."</seg>
<seg id="2049">"even though I have the luck to give her an experience, in which she personally does not experience an eclative racism, she is no different from the next black women child."</seg>
<seg id="2050">"I feel, I would show you a bad service to keep them away from it."</seg>
<seg id="2051">"the first stop, when they arrived in Ferguson, was located at the South Florissant Road, a place opposite the police authority that became a campground when the activists were waiting for the possible non-charge of Officer Darren Wilson."</seg>
<seg id="2052">"there, Ferrell and her daughter were connected to a local business owner who made lunch."</seg>
<seg id="2053">They prepared bags and helped to pass them on demonstrators.</seg>
<seg id="2054">Slowly began to adopt a new kind of activism for Ferrell shape.</seg>
<seg id="2055">"my activism changed completely after 9 August," she said and noticed that she was a student at the University of Missouri-St. Louis President of the Minority Student Nurses Association and focused on food justice and health inequalities in black churches. "</seg>
<seg id="2056">"I had no experience in organizing.</seg>
<seg id="2057">It has come all. "</seg>
<seg id="2058">"weeks later, Ferrell met during an evening demonstration Sabaah Folayan, one of the co-directors of the film."</seg>
<seg id="2059">"Folayan said she and her cameraman Lucas Alvarado-Farrar just wanted to" document, "what happened."</seg>
<seg id="2060">"a question came to Ferrell:" "do you want to document or try to find a story you can use?"</seg>
<seg id="2061">"this scepticism was nourished by countless cases of people, often by whites - in a community that benefited from their pain and resilience."</seg>
<seg id="2062">"as Folayan said recently in an interview:" "we heard that people who were born and raised in Ferguson have not centered their voices and we wanted to do it differently."</seg>
<seg id="2063">"Folayan had already collaborated with the co-director Damon Davis, an artist from the area known for his activism around Todestrakt occupants."</seg>
<seg id="2064">His engagement brought the project closer together with six other locals followed by the team of "Whose Streets?" in the years after Brown's shooting.</seg>
<seg id="2065">"this documentary is not someone who speaks for us or talks to us. we talk," "Davis said."</seg>
<seg id="2066">"that was the main thing for me, as these people are represented, for so I will be represented."</seg>
<seg id="2067">"the goal was not to concentrate on Ferrite's experience - to show that it is not a messiah leader, but a community that comes together," said Folayan - she proved to be the most obvious participant of the film. "</seg>
<seg id="2068">"as a result, documents of" Whose Streets "show surprising personal aspects of Ferrite's life as she falls in love and marries her wife."</seg>
<seg id="2069">"I felt like naked," "said Ferrell and laughed when she saw the finished product for the first time."</seg>
<seg id="2070">But I understood that in this work and in the humanization of black people there must be a certain vulnerability.</seg>
<seg id="2071">"in addition, Ferris's history repeats the role of the black gay women in the wider Black-Lives Matter movement."</seg>
<seg id="2072">"two of the three founders of the movement, which after the killing of the black teenager Trayvon Martin in 2012 have shaped the film" "Blacklive Matter" "in social media, identify themselves as gay."</seg>
<seg id="2073">"black, gay women in leadership positions have borne the movement altogether," said Ferrell, "and therefore we are constantly fighting on different fronts."</seg>
<seg id="2074">"black, gay women have to bear the main burden of everything."</seg>
<seg id="2075">"Folayan agreed to note that" the movement really is maintained by black women and many black women. "" "</seg>
<seg id="2076">"it is, however, that" this is not affirmative type of action, "chosen by Ferrell because of its identity as the heart of the film."</seg>
<seg id="2077">"she was the person who shook this energy," she said. "</seg>
<seg id="2078">"it is not a coincidence, although she was at the forefront, because with a life at these junctions as a black, gay woman stands so much on the game."</seg>
<seg id="2079">You can feel their energy through the screen. "</seg>
<seg id="2080">"meanwhile, the news cameras in Ferguson have long since disappeared, but the racial connections between the community and the police continue to exist."</seg>
<seg id="2081">Ferrell is for 2 ½ years because of blocking a highway at a demonstration.</seg>
<seg id="2082">It describes the socio-political atmosphere of the area which she calls her home: "a chaos."</seg>
<seg id="2083">"nevertheless, she complains about singing and she feels committed to this memory since she went into Ferguson three years ago."</seg>
<seg id="2084">It is our duty to fight for our freedom.</seg>
<seg id="2085">It is our duty to win.</seg>
<seg id="2086">We must love and support each other.</seg>
<seg id="2087">We have nothing to lose - except our chains. "</seg>
<seg id="2088">From "dream" to "megalomania": TV readers discuss about bit gallery</seg>
<seg id="2089">"the bit gallery moves people, even though it is not built for a long time."</seg>
<seg id="2090">But the idea of a shopping center at the south end of the pedestrian precinct splits the population in proponents and opponents since the first presentation 2009.</seg>
<seg id="2091">The theme is very cold.</seg>
<seg id="2092">Also on our Facebook page "Volksfreund Bitburg" the topic is discussed.</seg>
<seg id="2093">"while the one to the bit-gallery say:" that would be a dream "(Anja Becker) or" This would be really great "(Nicole Schausten), comes from the other side:" doesn't need a man "(Siggi Betzen) or quite simply:" "size wahn" "(Lars Scholz)."</seg>
<seg id="2094">"while proponents build that a gallery draws more customers into the city, of which the other shops benefit, the opponents fear that the pedestrian zone bleeding."</seg>
<seg id="2095">"in addition, the gallery is planned exactly on the plot on which the peasant market hall is, in which 13 direct markets offer their products."</seg>
<seg id="2096">"at the beginning of the construction work, it will be an end."</seg>
<seg id="2097">"the gallery makers want to integrate a market hall into the new building - namely, to the Beda square with the opportunity to sit outside."</seg>
<seg id="2098">Simone Zimmer: "we have been buying almost every week in the peasant market for many years.</seg>
<seg id="2099">"mainly our eggs, but also the delicious cakes of the women are always happy."</seg>
<seg id="2100">We also discovered the butcher's shop for us.</seg>
<seg id="2101">We would like to wish that even during and above all after the construction of the gallery there is a chance to maintain this offer.</seg>
<seg id="2102">There are also other cities in other cities.</seg>
<seg id="2103">Especially the small market hall in Frankfurt is interesting. "</seg>
<seg id="2104">Gerd Densing: "whether direct marketed in a market hall in the gallery appears on the amount of rent.</seg>
<seg id="2105">"this is likely not to be very low in the new project." ""</seg>
<seg id="2106">Eva Kilic: "what is the shopping spree in Bitburg?</seg>
<seg id="2107">"whether clothing, shoes, drug- or supermarkets, I find that superfluous."</seg>
<seg id="2108">There is enough of it in our city.</seg>
<seg id="2109">You can see how many shop stores are empty here - some for months and years.</seg>
<seg id="2110">"but since there is not even a regular weekly market, it is all the more important that at least the market hall remains intact."</seg>
<seg id="2111">"after all, the goods offered there are mostly offered directly by the producer and is inexpensive."</seg>
<seg id="2112">"as you can see, shop stores in a shopping center are only rented by larger companies, because the dorsal rent are often not portable for a retailer."</seg>
<seg id="2113">"a pity, special shops there is almost no more and that which is left of it will probably disappear."</seg>
<seg id="2114">Wolf Fandel: "a shopping mall with a market hall does not fit for me.</seg>
<seg id="2115">And the gallery does not fit to Bitburg.</seg>
<seg id="2116">"above all, where is the peasant market hall during the construction time?"</seg>
<seg id="2117">The old Edeka would be the solution - even if the bit gallery actually arrives at some point.</seg>
<seg id="2118">Or does it create the ghostst bit gallery before distributing all shops from Bitburg?</seg>
<seg id="2119">George Marquet: "that will simply not work.</seg>
<seg id="2120">"and a shopping center, which is empty, no one needs."</seg>
<seg id="2121">"in my opinion, it would have been better to promote a real farmers market instead of this gallery."</seg>
<seg id="2122">"but for a peasant market hall, thanks to the insane many - as I find - pointless construction projects in Bitburg no more space."</seg>
<seg id="2123">"when the peasant market hall is broken, a piece of culture will disappear again."</seg>
<seg id="2124">A matching similarity: artist creates portraits with Chelsea Mannings DNA</seg>
<seg id="2125">"in the middle of the Fridman Gallery in New York, many faces can be seen - white, black and brown that are almost indestructible - that hang on cables from the ceiling."</seg>
<seg id="2126">The 30 portraits were created by the artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg made of cheeks tuppers and haircuts that were sent to her by Chelsea Manning.</seg>
<seg id="2127">"Manning sent excerpts from the prison Fort Leavenworth, where the former secret service analyst consisted of a 35-year sentence, after making them publicly traded diplomatic missions on the site WikiLeaks."</seg>
<seg id="2128">"the new exhibition, opened on 2 August, is called A Becoming resemblance (A matching similarity)."</seg>
<seg id="2129">"she is the product of two years of correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, whose discipline combines expertise in technology, computer science and art, and Manning, a transference and groundbreaking dissident, whose conviction was converted by Barack Obama when he had only three days in his office."</seg>
<seg id="2130">"Dewey-Hagborg, through algorithmic analysis of DNA, was extracted from Manning and created out of the 30 portraits, as someone with these genomic data could look like, and the inherent determinism of these interpretations - but also created for identity."</seg>
<seg id="2131">"Manning, who was born as Bradley Edward, has already been openly referred to as woman since her puberty, was convicted for 20 charges, including six violations of the spy law, computer fraud and theft."</seg>
<seg id="2132">"in prison, her image was suppressed, so much that there was only one photo - a granular, black-white selfie, in which Manning obviously sits on a driver's seat and carries a platinum-blonde wig - with which she was associated."</seg>
<seg id="2133">"in 2015, Dewey-Hagborg just returned from the great success of her 2012 project 'Stranger Visions'."</seg>
<seg id="2134">"in this, the artist produced portraits of foreign artefacts like cigarette dumb and chewing gum by extracting DNA from waste to produce a picture of how these people could look like."</seg>
<seg id="2135">This was the time when she received an e-mail from a newspaper magazine.</seg>
<seg id="2136">"they conducted an interview with Chelsea Manning while she was in prison, and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article," explained Dewey-Hagborg at a press preview of the new exhibition. "</seg>
<seg id="2137">"and she could not be visited at that time and she could not be photographed, so you took contact with Chelsea and asked her if she wanted to make a DNA portrait."</seg>
<seg id="2138">"the artist and her imprisoned mice became unequal brieffreties, which exchanged several letters over the course of two years."</seg>
<seg id="2139">"they even created a Comic" "Suppressed Images" "illustrated by Shoili Kanungo, which would predict a future where the president would convert chelseas verdict and would be able to see the exhibition personally."</seg>
<seg id="2140">"that Obama is actually only a few days after the book was published to demand Mannings's release after seven brutal years in a military prison in Kansas, it was a welcome kind of happiest coincidence."</seg>
<seg id="2141">"there is also now at the opening of the exhibition some deep and strong, as Donald Trump takes a war against informants from the government camp and against transgender troops to find new, tweetable ways to fix the rigid splits that he actually should fix."</seg>
<seg id="2142">"when Dewey-Hagborg asked for the strange timing of all these things, she said that" things happen for a certain reason. "</seg>
<seg id="2143">"in a artistic statement written on the wall of the gallery, Manning started with her oversized signature (the" i "in her family name is marked with a heart) an end of the" automatic fragmentation, whose basis gender, race, sexuality and culture have been. "</seg>
<seg id="2144">"on the opposite wall is their mitochondrial DNA sequence - a thousandler of Cs and Gs and As, written in pencil."</seg>
<seg id="2145">"Dewey-Hagborg hoped to show through the inclusion of 200 letters (or nucleotides according to the highly developed scientific encyclopedia of the artist), as amazingly similar, at least in a biological sense, we are all."</seg>
<seg id="2146">"what people hopefully will bring along is that our genome doesn't care about who we are and how openly genetic data for interpretation and how subjectively they are," said Dewey-Hagborg, whose video work of 2007, Francis Memories, is also visible. "</seg>
<seg id="2147">"DNA data can tell so many different stories, therefore the 30 of these stories are."</seg>
<seg id="2148">The last piece in the exhibition that is kept in a separate room is a page from the above mentioned Comic-Novelle.</seg>
<seg id="2149">"she shows Manning, as she appears with a hands-free speech in the hands of the disciplinary barracks of the United States like King-Kong."</seg>
<seg id="2150">"when they make your speech, they have won," it says. "</seg>
<seg id="2151">"so, never stop the mouth."</seg>
<seg id="2152">"it came straight from a letter which she wrote to me," "said the artist, who greets from Philadelphia."</seg>
<seg id="2153">I still get goosebumps when I talk about it.</seg>
<seg id="2154">"Manning has not seen the exhibition personally - as predicted in the comic book - but if it should do it, it will be welcomed in the middle of the room by the masks, from its own genomic simulacras, which converge like hordes of protesters."</seg>
<seg id="2155">"this was also purposeful, like everything in the exhibition, up to size (5" 2, man stature), where their genetic haplogroups were written with pencil. "</seg>
<seg id="2156">"in the past, I had them on the wall, but I wanted them to feel like a crowd," said Dewey-Hagborg from portraits. "</seg>
<seg id="2157">"I wanted it feels like a mass movement that formed with Chelsea, like the movement that was hiding behind her release."</seg>

<seg id="2159">"a nationwide human hunt is underway for a professor at Northwestern University and an employee at Oxford University, who were considered suspects after a man had been killed in a luxurious apartment in Chicago with deadly injuries."</seg>
<seg id="2160">"on Monday, Wyndham Lathem (42) and Andrew Warren (56) were issued arrest warrants due to murder due to their alleged involvement in the death of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau, such as the acts of the Cook County Local Court."</seg>
<seg id="2161">"the documents say that Cornell-Duranleau, 26, died after several stitches."</seg>
<seg id="2162">A common warning system published by the police authority in Chicago means that the corpse was discovered on July 27.</seg>
<seg id="2163">"officials received a call, arrived at the Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victim with several injuries on his body."</seg>
<seg id="2164">"Cornell-Duranleau was still dead in the scene of action for dead, and investigators investigate the stitches as murder, while the police are actively looking for the two suspects, said officials."</seg>
<seg id="2165">"since 2007, Lathem has been an extraordinary professor of microbiology and immunology at Northwestern University."</seg>
<seg id="2166">"Alan K. Cubbage, the vice president for university relations, said in an e-mail declaration that Lathem should now be assessed and excluded from entering the Northwestern University campus."</seg>
<seg id="2167">"this is now a criminal affair to be examined by the competent authorities, and Northwestern University cooperates with this investigation," "said Cubbage."</seg>
<seg id="2168">Warren is Senior Treasury Assistant at Oxford University.</seg>
<seg id="2169">A spokesman at the University and the Somerville College said in an e-mail declaration that "we are in contact with the police in the UK and ready to help US investigators in any possible way.</seg>
<seg id="2170">The statement added that Warren's colleagues were shocked and want him to be.</seg>
<seg id="2171">"chief Communications Officer of the police authority of Chicago, Anthony Guglielmi said he urged the suspects to ask the authorities."</seg>
<seg id="2172">"the police has an idea of their whereabouts, and our efforts to locate them," "said Guglielmi."</seg>
<seg id="2173">"Guglielmi said that local, regional and national authorities help to find the suspects."</seg>
<seg id="2174">"Guglielmi said that the police received a call from the building manager of the Grand Plaza building, who had just received a mysterious tip, said that something happened in apartment 1008."</seg>
<seg id="2175">The police described the scene as very cruel.</seg>
<seg id="2176">"Guglielmi said it was unclear whether the incident took place on July 27th, too."</seg>
<seg id="2177">Security cameras have been confirmed that Lathem and Warren were in the building.</seg>
<seg id="2178">"we believe that Professor Latham and the victim had a relationship," said Guglielmi. "</seg>

<seg id="2187">"the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and WADA in the near future," he added. "</seg>
<seg id="2188">"one of the criteria mentioned in the list is, however, that Russian anti-doping authorities have to publicly accept the reported results of the investigation conducted by the WADA by the Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren about alleged state-supported doping in Russian sport."</seg>

<seg id="2291">In his younger past the small Scotney Castle was seen in a squeeze music video and was a loophole for Margaret Thatcher in the 1970-s and 1980-s.</seg>
<seg id="2292">"but Scotney has experienced 700 years of turbulent history from its cozy seat at the Bewl River Valley in Kent and is now an inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rhodes, a mophaired Yorkshireman with a predilection for historical documents."</seg>

<seg id="2296">"it is not the first Rhodes book based on an archive: he wrote in 2014 'Dead Men's Teeth and Other Stories', a collection inspired by documents in the British Library - a project that he found unexpected emotional."</seg>
<seg id="2297">"I only reacted on the thumb-print on the side of a letter that was written by a double-agent in the 1700-s, who worked for the Jacobins," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="2298">"" "this is his thumb-print!"</seg>
<seg id="2299">"and epistles are always smelling to smoke, because at that time a fire was kindled because of the light."</seg>
<seg id="2300">"for someone who lives 300 years later, the smell has an effect as if he himself would be."</seg>
<seg id="2301">"Oh, I love archives!"</seg>
<seg id="2302">"for someone who has been beaten with old papers that he is supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council England and lived almost four months in a castle (" "To be honest: I have overrated my welcome greeting" ") this all seems too beautiful to be true."</seg>
<seg id="2303">"Rhodes spent his days exploring the Victorian" new "castle, to look through the archives and study the many treasures and curiosities of the castle, such as the mounted hyriots on the walls and the bottles which had spent centuries in the ditch."</seg>
<seg id="2304">"he walked through the site and the ruins of the old castle and talked with landscapers, gardening and sometimes also with the artists who worked on the illustrations of his book."</seg>

<seg id="2306">"the intimate history of Scotney is relatively unknown since the National Trust received full access in 2006, when the last Erbin, Elizabeth Hussey, died."</seg>

<seg id="2309">"guys, let's go all his gear!"</seg>
<seg id="2310">"some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to immerse on a broader basis in the English story, including 'The Labourer', who follows a man who leaves the newly built castle to join the peasant revolt of 1381."</seg>
<seg id="2311">"there is a record of a clock that occurred in the castle in 1380, in this book entitled 'Knightly Families of Kent and Sussex', says Rhodes."</seg>
<seg id="2312">"the peasant revolt began in this area and I thought, an uprising was a good start."</seg>
<seg id="2313">Maybe the two are connected to each other? "</seg>
<seg id="2314">"other stories are firmly rooted in the history of the castle - like 'The Priest', which tells the story of the Jesuit Patron, who hid the Darrell family for seven years during the English Reformation."</seg>
<seg id="2315">"or 'The Smuggler' in which the smuggler Arthur Darrell was portrayed in the 18th century, which filled his own funeral by filling a coffin with stones (a discovery that was made only years later when his coffin was excavated)."</seg>
<seg id="2316">"Darrells are Rhodes's favorite family of Scotney:" "the gentlemen seemed to be quite a darker, always make debts and spend money for things they couldn't afford."</seg>
<seg id="2317">"other generations of Darrell-men solved their debt crises by marrying rich old women - I imagine them as a bunch of well-looking guys, with a talent to advertise."</seg>

<seg id="2355">"in the middle of July Erdogan ordered more 7395 citizenship by decree, among them 2303 policemen and 546 soldiers."</seg>
<seg id="2356">It seemed that Erdogan enumerated the military.</seg>
<seg id="2357">The generals were old earlier than the actual masters of the country.</seg>
<seg id="2358">"three times, they putted their role as guardians of the secular state order."</seg>
<seg id="2359">"following his election victory in 2002, Erdogan pressed the power of the military step by step, not least by calling on the reforms of the European Union."</seg>

<seg id="2389">"just as you thought it can't become even crazy 2017, a new report on technological developments in the field of sex robots is coming."</seg>
<seg id="2390">"yes, indeed."</seg>
<seg id="2391">Sex robots are currently a big thing.</seg>
<seg id="2392">The Foundation for Responsible Robotics (FRR) recently published a report on the development of sex robots over the next five to ten years.</seg>
<seg id="2393">"noel Sharkey, Emeritus Professor of Robotics and Artificial Intelligence at the University of Sheffield and Co-Founder of the FRR, we have to begin to take her ascension seriously."</seg>
<seg id="2394">"customers can choose the eye color of the robot, its shape of the nipples and the type of fingernail."</seg>
<seg id="2395">"people make fun about them, but the companies deliver a lot of it and we will see them much more frequently," "said Mr. Sharkey for publishing his new report."</seg>
<seg id="2396">Modern sex dolls have developed from their inflatable partners to robots with a silicone skin that feels warm - with consciously human reactions that are achieved by artificial intelligence.</seg>
<seg id="2397">"the user can also adjust his robot according to his beliefs, and select everything from the eye color of the robot to the type of nipples to the type or color of his fingernails."</seg>
<seg id="2398">"but it becomes even more disturbing, as many robots have the" personalities "that would make a stepford-woman progressively."</seg>
<seg id="2399">Modern sex dolls have developed to robots with a silicone skin.</seg>
<seg id="2400">"the RealBotix robot allows for example its users to adapt their robots to the properties they find appealing, such as shyness."</seg>
<seg id="2401">"and then there is the Roxxxy Gold sex robots developed by True Companion with pre-programmed personalities such as Frigid Farrah, who gives the impression of shyness and" Wild Wendy "with an" adventurous "personality."</seg>
<seg id="2402">"Roxxxy Gold has a personality that is adapted to your personality as good as possible," warms the website of True Companion. "</seg>
<seg id="2403">"she likes what you like, and she doesn't like what you don't like, etc."</seg>
<seg id="2404">"in the course of the day, she also has her moods - just like real people!"</seg>
<seg id="2405">"she can be tired, can be fixed on conversation or she can be" "in mood" "!"</seg>
<seg id="2406">"there are many disturbing aspects of this rise of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the submissive feminine features, the susceptibility to rape, when one goes a step on Frigid (i.e.: resisting) Farrah, worms one most."</seg>
<seg id="2407">True Companion Roxxxy compatible with a vibrator but for men.</seg>
<seg id="2408">"if women (sic) can have a vibrator, why can men then have no Roxxxy?" it is on the website. "</seg>
<seg id="2409">"however, these sex robots are not just a fetish or just just another sex toy."</seg>
<seg id="2410">"their emergence and increasing refinement point to something darker and deeper in our culture, to a retreat from the ideal of gender equality towards a desire for sex with submission as an optional encore."</seg>
<seg id="2411">"most men will naturally not hold sex robots, and while the FRR acknowledges its rising popularity, they remain provisional at the edge of consumer culture."</seg>
<seg id="2412">"but what leakage out of the boundary zones can be very instructive in relation to the spirit of time in which we live, very instructive."</seg>
<seg id="2413">And many people are not strangely or insulting until they have given permission to the free market.</seg>
<seg id="2414">"there is however a certain overlap that these highly developed sex robots emerge in a time when the rights of women are threatened around the world, in which there is a president in the White House who praises women sexually attacked."</seg>
<seg id="2415">"the most deterrent aspect of the TV series' The Handmaid's Tale '(' The Report of the Magd ') are not the graphical pictures, the intricate body and the stuffed eyes, but how realistic this vision works."</seg>
<seg id="2416">"the Republic of Gilead is a jump, but at the moment it does not feel like a big jump."</seg>
<seg id="2417">The goal behind these sex robots is to make a physical resemblance to real women as realistic as possible (albeit with porno-star proportions).</seg>
<seg id="2418">Their builders want them to feel human to imitate the movement of a real body.</seg>
<seg id="2419">"but, brought to the point when it comes to their" personalities, "the robots are not real women."</seg>
<seg id="2420">They cannot separate themselves from their companion or simply go away.</seg>
<seg id="2421">"they have no mediation or background history, nothing that suggests independence or anything that might disturb the imagination of total submission."</seg>

<seg id="2425">He makes Mitt Romney the epitome of healthy human mind</seg>

<seg id="2428">We all rigorously repent to let our filter bubbles burst.</seg>

<seg id="2431">It reminded me that unity against a common enemy can have a powerful effect.</seg>
<seg id="2432">"Trump in the White House is everyone who knows them, including the republican relationship with which they fought for decades because of politics, suddenly and completely on the same side."</seg>
<seg id="2433">"the dining table is certainly a good thing, but it seems to me in a further context that this also brings significant risks."</seg>
<seg id="2434">"the left was strengthened by Trump, but the immediate effect of his presidency has the power to push all of us to the right."</seg>
<seg id="2435">"when we speak of" normalization "and Trump, we refer to the gruselty way that his kittens of one day will no longer be offended."</seg>
<seg id="2436">"however, there is an even more frightening long-term scenario in which Trump Republicans of the right wing are normalized, which suddenly appear as the epitome of reasonableness at once in comparison to his standards."</seg>
<seg id="2437">"I find myself today of an active nostalgia for Mitt Romney's original version of the madman - the dog on the Autodach, the 14% income tax (but at least we knew how his tax declaration looked like) - both compared to Trump in fact one as very mild offences."</seg>
<seg id="2438">"when Trump goes, the next candidate of the republicans must be mentally healthy in order to qualify as an immeasurable improvement."</seg>
<seg id="2439">"when my cousin was in the city, we brought our children to the carousel in Central Park, the biggest of the Karussells of the New York park department, and the best three dollars you can spend in the city if you don't need a caffeine."</seg>
<seg id="2440">"the horses are enormous, the fiberglass designs on the central cylinder - all clowns are crisp and the animals are twisted to look at full of fear of their own shoulders - most dark and the climing music conveys this in a strange way."</seg>
<seg id="2441">"so many clichés of a city disappoint: the views of high buildings are old, the skylines are too familiar to offer much excitement, and the reality of the city will not do justice to the dream."</seg>
<seg id="2442">"thirty-five years later, and I'm still not quite over the day when I found that Swiss Cottage is indeed not a Swiss cottage - the theme pub Ye Olde Swiss Cottage is not one - but a big roundabout in the north of London."</seg>

<seg id="2491">How exactly does the software update take place?</seg>
<seg id="2492">Will diesel drivers need to participate in the promotion?</seg>
<seg id="2493">The most important questions and answers at a glance.</seg>
<seg id="2494">"at the diesel summit, BMW, Daimler, Opel and the VW Corporation have offered software updates for a total of around 5.3 million cars."</seg>
<seg id="2495">You should improve the emissions behaviour of car emissions from Euro 5 and partially Euro 6.</seg>
<seg id="2496">Euro-4 diesel or worse are exempt from it.</seg>
<seg id="2497">Anja Smetanin from the ACE Auto Club Europe assessments:</seg>
<seg id="2498">Is the new action obligatory?</seg>
<seg id="2499">"no, the software updates traded are optional."</seg>
<seg id="2500">"the obligatory updates previously only apply to the vehicles that have the Schuman software," says Anja Smetanin. "</seg>
<seg id="2501">The retrofitting has arranged the power-drive federal office (KBA).</seg>
<seg id="2502">How and when will customers be informed about updates?</seg>
<seg id="2503">"the manufacturers have announced rapid implementation in the next few months, but not yet called an exact date."</seg>
<seg id="2504">Daimler has communicated to each person concerned.</seg>

<seg id="2506">How long should the conversions be drawn altogether?</seg>
<seg id="2507">"hard to say," says Smetanin. "</seg>
<seg id="2508">This depends on the commitment of the manufacturers as well as from political pressure.</seg>
<seg id="2509">"for we have seen, voluntarily the car manufacturers act on the subject of the environment so far."</seg>
<seg id="2510">How long should the update take?</seg>
<seg id="2511">The conversion itself could take only three to four hours in the workshop.</seg>
<seg id="2512">Time-consuming can be to get an appointment.</seg>
<seg id="2513">"what do drivers that do not drive cars from BMW, Daimler, Opel and the VW group?"</seg>
<seg id="2514">The ACE advises to wait.</seg>

<seg id="2526">"as the cultural direction of Thursday announced on Thursday, singer Gloria Estefan (59), Lionel Richie (68) and the choreographer Carmen de Lavallade (86) and the TV producer Norman Lear (95) belong to the scribes."</seg>
<seg id="2527">The awards will be handed over at the beginning of December.</seg>
<seg id="2528">"traditionally, U.S. President Donald Trump will host a reception and participate together with his wife Melania at the award ceremony."</seg>
<seg id="2529">The award winner Lear announced with progressive TV series therefore already announced to renounce the participation in the gala.</seg>
<seg id="2530">"he said:" "this presidency has decided to completely neglect the arts and human rights - and even deprive them of the means - and that burdens me."</seg>
<seg id="2531">"the 59-year-old Estefan stressed, she will use Trump's conversation to clear her view."</seg>
<seg id="2532">"the Kennedy-Center, named after former President John F. Kennedy, is the largest cultural institution in the US capital."</seg>
<seg id="2533">"the former prize winners include Meryl Streep, Aretha Franklin, Robert De Niro, George Lucas, Tom Hanks and Sting."</seg>
<seg id="2534">We make the city worth living</seg>
<seg id="2535">"Roland Wacker, Haslachs Stadtbaumeister, will retire next year."</seg>
<seg id="2536">"the place is already written, however, suitable applicants are rare."</seg>
<seg id="2537">"for 31 years, Wacker Stadtbaumeister is a master builder."</seg>
<seg id="2538">And the work always makes him great fun as he conveys in the Pressegespräch.</seg>
<seg id="2539">"he reports of varied, but also demanding tasks waiting for his successor."</seg>
<seg id="2540">"at the same time, it is miraculous that no application for the requirements profile has been fulfilled so far."</seg>
<seg id="2541">The city is looking for an architect or civil engineer at the earliest possible time.</seg>
<seg id="2542">This is to be done in compliance with the regular periods of notice - still enough time for a revision.</seg>
<seg id="2543">"since Haslach is responsible for the administrative community as a Lower Building Law, the applicant must assign corresponding conclusions."</seg>
<seg id="2544">Because this function wants to keep the city in any case.</seg>
<seg id="2545">"if they can no longer fill them out, the citizens would have to travel to Offenburg."</seg>
<seg id="2546">"but the proximity to the city is important to the city and it itself, says Wacker, who reports from a good operation climate and good atmosphere between the authorities and citizens."</seg>
<seg id="2547">"in more than 30 years in office, some important projects have accumulated, looking back on the Wacker with pride."</seg>
<seg id="2548">"we make the city life worth," he is sure about the office and its staff. "</seg>
<seg id="2549">"but also in the future, varied projects are on the agenda: the redesign of the former Hukla-Areals and the Niederhofenparkplatz are impaired."</seg>
<seg id="2550">"the zigzag bridge between Bollenbach and Steinach is renewed, even the stadium renovation is still subject."</seg>
<seg id="2551">"the latter will strike with about 1.5 million euros," if we do it right, "Wacker appreciates."</seg>
<seg id="2552">"all in all, great tasks await my successor."</seg>
<seg id="2553">The work here is fun. "</seg>
<seg id="2554">Design is available for a city building master of great playroom.</seg>
<seg id="2555">Haslachs's own building yard and gardener can be reacted flexibly to many.</seg>
<seg id="2556">"you can move a lot," says Wacker, and the design of the green spaces is often praised by citizens and visitors. "</seg>
<seg id="2557">"since the Old Town stands as an ensemble under monument protection, it is important to" "have an eye on what is pure" "when new buildings are approved, the separating Stadtbaumeister emphasizes."</seg>
<seg id="2558">"anyway, the Stadtbaumeister carries great responsibility."</seg>
<seg id="2559">"he is a builder," "at the end everything goes over my table."</seg>
<seg id="2560">"with care and coordination, he can count on many years of staff: Markus Neumaier (Hochbau) has been here for ten years, Manfred Schöner (Tiefbau) for 15 years."</seg>
<seg id="2561">"also that his successor remains for a long time, Wacker wishes:" we are looking for someone who really wants to identify and stay with the place. "</seg>
<seg id="2562">"continuity is not only important for a good working climate, but also for the further design of the city."</seg>
<seg id="2563">"if you want to inherit Roland Wacker, you should have a completed study as a graduate engineer or a Bachelor's degree with subject architecture, and have good technical knowledge in the areas of construction and construction planning."</seg>
<seg id="2564">"the Stadtbauamt underlines high and civil engineering, building instruction, grafic valuations, administration of urban properties, urban farm with building yard and urban gardening as well as lower building rights authority, including preservation of monuments."</seg>
<seg id="2565">Bicycle on lines thrown: South railway line closed</seg>
<seg id="2566">"according to the police, the previously unknown perpetrators had thrown the blue bike from the rail track in the area of Leobene Street (B116)."</seg>
<seg id="2567">These were so badly damaged that the approaching goods had to be stopped.</seg>
<seg id="2568">The investigators go out of two male offenders and have been searching for them for the night-hours.</seg>
<seg id="2569">"near the crime scene, witnesses had been observed by witnesses of a rosary scooter and a bike rider."</seg>
<seg id="2570">"this goes far beyond a Lausbuster kingdom," "said ÖBB-spokesman Christoph Posch on the APA."</seg>
<seg id="2571">The perpetrators would have brought themselves in great danger and also jeopardized the traffic.</seg>
<seg id="2572">"in addition to the damage to the locomotive and the plant, as well as the delay of delays and the costs for rail transport vehicles, also sponsors of the railway customers could come to the perpetrators."</seg>
<seg id="2573">"all in all, from a" substantial "sum, the spokesman said."</seg>
<seg id="2574">"the damages were rectified on Friday afternoon, the rail traffic on the southern railway line could be guided without disabilities."</seg>
<seg id="2575">"just about ten passenger trains were out Friday morning, two of them considered the correspondence."</seg>
<seg id="2576">"freight trains did not drop, but they had delay."</seg>
<seg id="2577">"according to ÖBB spokesperson Christoph Posch, about 200 meters of overhead lines had to be replaced."</seg>
<seg id="2578">Insulators and masts were also damaged.</seg>
<seg id="2579">"red meat, dairy products and chocolate could help relieve IBD (inflammatory bowel disease)"</seg>
<seg id="2580">Red meat and chocolate can sound like a nightmare for your digestive system.</seg>
<seg id="2581">"but a new study claims exactly the opposite: a diet, which is rich in meat-based proteins and dairy products, could alleviate the symptoms of patients with inflammatory bowel disease."</seg>
<seg id="2582">"the incurable condition in the United States affects approximately 1.3 million and in Great Britain 300,000, causes stomach cramps and paralysis, recurrent or bloody diarrhoea, weight loss and extreme tiredness."</seg>
<seg id="2583">"while those affected are usually advised to avoid meat and dairy products to alleviate their symptoms, researchers found the Washingtoner University that the essential amino acid tryptophan contributes to the development of the immune cells that promote a tolerant gut."</seg>
<seg id="2584">"the conductive researcher, Dr. Marco Colonna, explained that immune cells in the gut are patrolling to ensure that harmful microbes that hide in the food, do not penetrate into the body."</seg>
<seg id="2585">"cells that are able to trigger inflammation, are balanced by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body, without damaging sensitive tissues."</seg>
<seg id="2586">"if the balance is too far towards inflammation, it can result in an inflammatory bowel disease."</seg>
<seg id="2587">Experiments have been found that a type of tolerance inducing immune cell is found in mice that carry a certain bacterium in their intestines.</seg>
<seg id="2588">And the bacterium needs tryptophan - one of the building blocks of proteins - to trigger the appearance of the cells.</seg>
<seg id="2589">"Professor Colonna said:" "we have a connection between a bacterial species - Lactobacillus reuteri - which is a normal part of the gut microbiome, and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance."</seg>
<seg id="2590">"the more tryptophan the mice in their diet had, the more they had from these immune cells."</seg>
<seg id="2591">"he suggested that the combination of L. reuteri and an in Tryptophan rich diet tolerant, less inflamed intestinal motions, if the same system is also beneficial in humans."</seg>
<seg id="2592">"the post-doctorate Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barragan examined a kind of immune cell that promotes tolerance when she found that a group of study mice had such cells, but another group of the same tribe, but that had not been separated."</seg>
<seg id="2593">"it assumed that the difference with the intestinal microbiomes of the mice had to do - the community of bacteria, viruses and fungi, which normally live in the gastrointestinal tract."</seg>
<seg id="2594">The mice of mice were sequenced by DNA sequencing and six bacterial species were found that were present in mice with the immune cells but without missing them in mice.</seg>
<seg id="2595">"mice were pulled up in a sterile environment so that they lacked intestinal microbiome and they did not develop this type of immune cells, and they received the l. reuteri and the immune cells."</seg>
<seg id="2596">"to understand how the bacteria penetrated to the immune system, the researchers let L. reuteri grow in a liquid and then transferred small amounts of fluid - without the bacteria - to unripe immune cells isolated from mice."</seg>
<seg id="2597">The immune cells developed into the tolerant-promoting cells.</seg>
<seg id="2598">"as the active component of the liquid was cleansed, it proved to be a by-product of the tryptophan metabolism, known as an Indol-3 lactic acid."</seg>
<seg id="2599">"when the researchers double the amount of tryptophan in the feed of mice, the number of such cells increased by about 50 percent, but when the tryptophan values were halved, the number of cells decreased by half."</seg>
<seg id="2600">Dr. Cervantes-Barragan explained that people have the same tolerant cells such as mice and that most of us protect L. reuteri in our gastrointestinal tracts.</seg>
<seg id="2601">"it is not known whether Tryptophan-by-products from L. reuteri develop the cells in people such as mice, but defects in genes in relation to tryptophan were found in people with inflammatory bowel disease."</seg>
<seg id="2602">She said: "the development of these cells is probably something we want to promote since these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the intestine.</seg>
<seg id="2603">"potentially, high tryptophane values in the presence of L. reuteri can lead to an extension of this population."</seg>

<seg id="2634">The Green Federal Managing Director Michael Kellner has asked the Lower Saxony Greens Elke Tests to return her mandate.</seg>

<seg id="2715">"the White House's decision to fly a naval helicopter to the South Lawn for an event, which undertakes the American production last month, costs taxpayers according to the military service provided by the TIME magazine up to 24,000 US dollars."</seg>
<seg id="2716">"the green-white Sikorsky VH-3D, known as Marine One, when the president is on board, was the centerpiece of the event on 17 July in the White House with American construction programs."</seg>
<seg id="2717">"President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and senior officials of the White House made a tour of products from all 50 countries."</seg>
<seg id="2718">"helicopter is made in Connecticut, next to a yacht from Maine, a fire fighter car from Wisconsin and a forklift truck from Mississippi."</seg>
<seg id="2719">"the military office of the White House requested the presence of the helicopter in a fragmentary order or Frago, barely 36 hours before the helicopter landed at the South Lawn, according to the records of the Marine Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1), the unit responsible for the operation of the helicopter."</seg>
<seg id="2720">"I just wanted you to be aware of it because it is such an unusual event with high visibility," wrote the commander of the HMX-1 on the eve of the event of his superiors, the deputy marinekommandeur for aviation. "</seg>
<seg id="2721">The message showed that the helicopter arrived at the South Lawn on July 17 at 7 o'clock in the morning and so long until the turf was cleared between 18: 00 and 21: 00 on this evening.</seg>
<seg id="2722">The note adds that if the departure from the White House should be delayed due to the limitation of the service hours a second crew would be required for return flight.</seg>
<seg id="2723">"the original flight crew was at the helicopter during the event, while the security personnel of the unit remained on the ground during the time on the plane."</seg>
<seg id="2724">"from the records provided by the TIME, it was not clear whether a second flight was required."</seg>
<seg id="2725">The Hatch Act prohibits federal state property for political purposes.</seg>
<seg id="2726">Records indicate that HMX-1 asked if the event could hurt the destiny.</seg>
<seg id="2727">"a question we asked was whether it was a violation of the Hatch acts and we were informed that this was not the case," "wrote the commander."</seg>
<seg id="2728">"sounds as if you are locked," the deputy commander answered. "</seg>
<seg id="2729">The "Made in America" event was designated by the White House as an official event and would not be covered by the Hatch Act.</seg>
<seg id="2730">But official events also have political overtones.</seg>
<seg id="2731">"at the event, the president gave an impulse for the reform of the health reform, which was in progress in the Senate, and he propagated efforts to curb government regulations."</seg>
<seg id="2732">"the use of the aircraft, known as Marine One or Air Force One, is hardly a new phenomenon."</seg>
<seg id="2733">Presidents are obliged to use them for travel.</seg>
<seg id="2734">"but to request their use only for a photo operation, is unusual."</seg>
<seg id="2735">"in February, Trump conducted an investigation when the presidential jet was in front of the backdrop of his first campaign rallye in Melbourne, Florida, taxi services, and his Twitter account is full of messages describing the use of the presidential jet through its predecessors."</seg>
<seg id="2736">"the White House is enthusiastic about the show" "Made In America" "- the products from all 50 countries that are produced by American workers with American materials," said the Assistant Secretary of the White House, Lindsay Walters. "</seg>
<seg id="2737">HMX-1 crews often lead training flights to Washington and South Lawn to expose the US president in the White House with precise centimetres.</seg>
<seg id="2738">"when Trump was in Germany at the G20 summit in Germany at the beginning of July, HMX-1 led the White House 58 exercise landings."</seg>
<seg id="2739">"the flight for the" "Made in America" "event counted for the training needs of the flight crew for the month, said a civil servant."</seg>
<seg id="2740">Helicopter units also flew 11 hours this day for "non-presidential support missions."</seg>
<seg id="2741">The White House said that taxpayers overtook the burden of none of the other props presented at the event.</seg>
<seg id="2742">"a spokesman of Sikorsky said, the company was not involved to exhibit the helicopter on the South Lawn."</seg>
<seg id="2743">"HMX-1 does not support budget designations for the presidential flights, and it is difficult to determine the exact costs for the event."</seg>
<seg id="2744">"according to the U.S. Department of Defense for the fiscal year 2017, the DoD refund set for the VH-3D is 24.380 USD per flight hour."</seg>
<seg id="2745">Records of the unit list the flight time of the aircraft as 30 minutes from the home base of Marine Corps Air Facility in Quantico in Virginia.</seg>
<seg id="2746">The White House argues that the actual cost of operation of the helicopter is far below this rate.</seg>
<seg id="2747">"the cost of taxpayers based on estimates for refund rates is most misleading," said Walters. "</seg>
<seg id="2748">"these estimates include staff, maintenance and many other hidden costs included in the annual funding."</seg>
<seg id="2749">"according to an RAND study from 2015, the refund rates for DoD do not include personnel costs, but also take into account the cost of fuel, maintenance and conclusion of the contract."</seg>
<seg id="2750">"at that time, the former press spokesman of the White House, Sean Spicer, defended the use of the helicopter for the event."</seg>
<seg id="2751">"the idea is to present things that week are produced in America," said Spicer. "</seg>
<seg id="2752">"and I know Sikorsky and the state of Connecticut are very proud that they contribute to our national security, and I assume that hundreds, if not even thousands of people depend on it."</seg>
<seg id="2753">And I think like most Americans we are all proud of the helicopter and other military equipment for which so many Americans have worked tirelessly.</seg>
<seg id="2754">Of course it is appropriate to emphasize that.</seg>
<seg id="2755">"it was not clear whether Trump was interacting with the helicopter, when he entered his tour over the South Lawn for the event, but he sat in the driver's seat of a fire Brigade."</seg>
<seg id="2756">"in the White House, Trump spoke to representatives of Sikorsky and spread with the media about his own fleet of company products."</seg>

<seg id="2896">"the habit of designating the Catholic Church as a source of all evil, is already part of everyday experience and prepares public opinion to keep it normal," says Scaraffia. "</seg>
<seg id="2897">"also Princess Gloria of Thurn und Taxis said in an interview with Bayerischer Rundfunk (Bayerischer Rundfunk):" we are happy to go to the church, and this is a found frescoes. "</seg>
<seg id="2898">"furthermore, she pointed out that in her youth" blows had been a very normal pedagogical means "" to cope with cheeky children, as I was one. "</seg>
<seg id="2899">"it would be unfair to apply today's standards for earlier decades, as the world has changed."</seg>
<seg id="2900">"in connection with the reports on the abuse incidents, pope-brother Georg Ratzinger often appeared."</seg>
<seg id="2901">"completely wrongly, author and historian Michael Hesemann, who wrote the commemorative book" My Brother of the Pope "with Ratzinger (translated into 12 languages)."</seg>
<seg id="2902">"I have to take care of Georg Ratzinger," "says Hesman," "for all this had nothing to do with him," "he evaluates the results of the final report."</seg>
<seg id="2903">What exactly stands in the 440-page report submitted by the diocese Regensburg with the Enlightenment commissioner Ulrich Weber?</seg>
<seg id="2904">"a total of 547" "Domspatzen" "from 1945 to the beginning of the 1990s" "with high plausibility" "victims of overtook, 67 Domspatzen sexually abused."</seg>
<seg id="2905">"in the final report, it is said to Georg Ratzinger, who was active in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994:" in summary, the fact that Domkapellmeister R. was used in many cases forms of physical and psychological violence. "</seg>
<seg id="2906">"especially with high emotionality, the punishment for the students was also able to turn out more fiercely."</seg>
<seg id="2907">"nevertheless, in contrast to numerous other accused, many victims are estimated to respect the general humanity of R. and therefore in numerous cases, despite violence, even positive memories are connected with him."</seg>
<seg id="2908">"in the interview, Hesemann explains why the final report on the misuse scandal at the Domspatzen Georg Ratzinger was relieved."</seg>
<seg id="2909">"Mr Hesemann, the 440-page report on the" incidents of violence in violence against the "" Regensburger Domspatzen "" are a contradictory picture of Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger. "</seg>
<seg id="2910">"for one, many students raise their" humanity. ""</seg>
<seg id="2911">"on the other hand, it also appears as choleriker and perfectionist, which became more handy when a Domspatz has no top performance."</seg>
<seg id="2912">How do you evaluate this final report as his biographer?</seg>
<seg id="2913">"Michael Hesemann: if you take the trouble and read the whole 440 pages long report from the front to the back, you have to ask yourself more, why the name Georg Ratzinger actually occurs in it."</seg>
<seg id="2914">"there are just eight pages dedicated to him, and he is clearly shared by any suspicion of complicity or compassion in the terrible cases of sexual abuse."</seg>
<seg id="2915">Even the violent excesses at the pre-school occurred outside his sphere of influence.</seg>
<seg id="2916">"it is possible to reproach him, of which too late or first indications are not taken seriously enough."</seg>
<seg id="2917">"the Domspatzengymnasium, on which he worked, was perceived as" salvation, "" heaven, "and" better world. ""</seg>
<seg id="2918">"the vast majority of his students Georg Ratzinger also presents an excellent testimony," "sincere," "competent," "competent", "" competent "and" comprehensible, "as extremely good-natured teachers, who supplied the boys regularly with cakes, biscuits and bonbons and" always surrounded by the grapes of children. ""</seg>
<seg id="2919">"only a minority complains about his perfectionism and his high emotionality, which also sometimes led to wound breaks."</seg>
<seg id="2920">"the fact that he did not only kneel with chairs and threw the kisses on the ground, but also distributed men's horseshoe and too naughty guys on the hair or ears, he has already given him years ago, deeply regretted and apologized for it."</seg>
<seg id="2921">"however, to his salvation, however, it has to be said that such educational methods were widespread in the questionable period, the 1960s and 1970s, in both parents and teachers."</seg>
<seg id="2922">Do you also know such breeding methods?</seg>
<seg id="2923">"of course, I think each of us who was born before 1968."</seg>
<seg id="2924">"I also experienced this in a secular school, a state secondary school."</seg>
<seg id="2925">"compared to what is actually happening in this report, namely the horrible sexual abuse and violent excesses at the pre-school, it is certainly digatelles."</seg>
<seg id="2926">"one wonders, whether it is not more familiar with his fame and role as a brother of Benedict XVI, that many media have just crashed on him."</seg>
<seg id="2927">"at the Bavarian pope, many who have never understood him are still zealous."</seg>
<seg id="2928">But the truth is: the report relieves Georg Ratzinger in every respect!</seg>
<seg id="2929">"in the media, in connection with the report, there was a lot about the issue of abuse on the case of the Domspatzen."</seg>
<seg id="2930">Is Georg Ratzinger placed in the final report any wrapping or sympathy for sexual abuse on the load?</seg>
<seg id="2931">Michael Hesemann: very clearly no.</seg>
<seg id="2932">No one of the 67 victims of sexual assault claims to become familiar with the Domkapellmeister.</seg>
<seg id="2933">Not even the parents were consecrated.</seg>
<seg id="2934">"I never dared to talk to my father or mother about it," "said a concern for the others," "It was all very embarrassing for me."</seg>
<seg id="2935">"the true issue in the education of sexual abuse, however, is that most victims are silent."</seg>
<seg id="2936">"if they weren't even familiar with parents and siblings, certainly not a choir director, who would have been a colleague of the perpetrators professionally."</seg>
<seg id="2937">How do the Domspatzen-students Ratzinger's role in regard to abuse incidents?</seg>
<seg id="2938">Michael Hesemann: a questioned student formulated it in such a way: "regarding sexual abuse... I see... not a case in which he would have had timely knowledge and could have stopped the respective perpetrator.</seg>
<seg id="2939">"I think it... even for really absurd to assume that... Buben are more intrusive or clearer or more likely to have opened than against their parents, dormitory leaders, trust teachers, etc."</seg>
<seg id="2940">That you talk to him about sex... unthinkable. "</seg>
<seg id="2941">"in this way, the report concludes with the very clear result:" that the students and / or their surroundings were entrusted to him in advance, could not be confirmed in the context of the investigation. "</seg>
<seg id="2942">"as for sexual abuse, Georg Ratzinger is thus exempt from any co-existence."</seg>
<seg id="2943">"thus, it cannot be accused of being prevented or brought to the display."</seg>
<seg id="2944">"therefore, there is no reason to associate his good name with these contradictory crimes, as unfortunately in some cases."</seg>
<seg id="2945">"in the media, a lot of" non-violence "was to be read at the Domspatzen."</seg>
<seg id="2946">The former Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger is discarded in the report "Wegmüller."</seg>
<seg id="2947">Does he have to live with this accusation?</seg>
<seg id="2948">"Michael Hesemann: this is the big problem that in the reporting everything is mixed and mingled to a huge melange of sexual abuse and violence and somewhere, right in the middle, Georg Ratzinger."</seg>
<seg id="2949">But that is exactly what is misuse of the report.</seg>
<seg id="2950">"in fact, there will be cleanly separated: between the pre-school and the gymnasium of the domicile, between sexual abuse and violence, we say once, other allegations."</seg>
<seg id="2951">"in addition, the report covers cases from the time since 1945, thus also from four decades in which Georg Ratzinger was not choral conductors of the Domspatzen."</seg>
<seg id="2952">"all the terrible test pedagogy, the cases where boys of sadistic teachers were arbitrarily layered and painted, all at the pre-school in Etterzhausen and Pielenhofen where really scandalous states must have reigned."</seg>
<seg id="2953">"but with those Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger had nothing to do, for he only got his face when she had already been on the Domspatzengymnasium."</seg>
<seg id="2954">"on that, as most witnesses emphasise, the subject of" Preschool "taboo."</seg>
<seg id="2955">One was only happy to be escaped and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even "heavenly" states.</seg>
<seg id="2956">What was different on the Domspatzengymnasium?</seg>
<seg id="2957">"Michael Hesemann: there was discipline, but no sadistic violence."</seg>
<seg id="2958">"and this also applies to Georg Ratzinger, in which the report concludes that" many victims are estimating the general humanity of R. and therefore in numerous cases, despite violence, even positive memories with him. "</seg>
<seg id="2959">"at most, it remains the reproach to have taken away."</seg>
<seg id="2960">"however, despite all efforts, the report was able to define only two periods where it was reported by the states at the pre-school."</seg>
<seg id="2961">"the first time 1970 / 71, when he began to establish himself and from the previous ones at a school where he was not working and responsible, (so the witness) didn't want to hear anything, and then again around 1993."</seg>
<seg id="2962">Does Georg Ratzinger consistently swallow the ears?</seg>
<seg id="2963">"Michael Hesemann: no, because in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the Domspatzengymnasium, which the report was even reproduced."</seg>
<seg id="2964">"in this, he points out that in the pre-school the test penalty will continue to be practised."</seg>
<seg id="2965">"in view of the danger of negative press publicity, it recommended urgent action."</seg>
<seg id="2966">"this was of course at a time when legal clarity existed, as examiners had long been banned in Bavaria."</seg>
<seg id="2967">"before that, they occurred in a legal grey area, as each one of us knows yet."</seg>
<seg id="2968">"it was difficult for him to estimate, where those affected might exaggerate or dramatized, and where really the permitted limit was exceeded."</seg>
<seg id="2969">But you can't say that he has always looked away.</seg>
<seg id="2970">This is just right.</seg>
<seg id="2971">"only in 1980, the test was officially abolished at schools in Bavaria."</seg>
<seg id="2972">"Prince Gloria of Thurn und Taxis said yes, it was unfair to apply today's pedagogical standards to the time of time."</seg>
<seg id="2973">How do you see that?</seg>
<seg id="2974">"Michael Hesemann: we historians talk about the" "pitfalls of anachronism", "i.e. the danger of evaluating the past of today's moral standards."</seg>
<seg id="2975">08.11.2015 | Desperate Housewives</seg>
<seg id="2976">"but that of course does not apply to sexual abuse, which was abominable at all times and also not for what was banned in the pre-school of resistance and violence against innocent children's souls, that goes far beyond that."</seg>
<seg id="2977">This is all horrible and I am glad that it is finally reworked.</seg>
<seg id="2978">"but at the same time I have to take care of Georg Ratzinger, because all this had nothing to do with him."</seg>
<seg id="2979">"his means for disciplining and punishment, so to draw ear-horseshoe and hair and ears, were widespread in the 1970s."</seg>
<seg id="2980">"when physical punishment was then forbidden, he has kept strictly adhered to it."</seg>
<seg id="2981">"which picture of his Regensburg time has Georg Ratzinger, for in the talks with you for the book" My Brother of the Pope "?"</seg>
<seg id="2982">Did the subject of Checks sentence also come to the language?</seg>
<seg id="2983">"Michael Hesemann: well, in the book it is about the life of his brother Joseph, so pope Benedict XVI, tells from his perspective, as the Domspatzen played only one side role."</seg>
<seg id="2984">"nevertheless, I was by no means waged that he led a rigorous regiment there."</seg>
<seg id="2985">"but even that must be said once: without this perfectionism, without the demands of unconditional discipline, it would hardly have been possible for him to form an institution of world-trans, true cultural ambassadors of Europe and his musical tradition, which went on tour twice in the USA (1983 and 1987) and Japan (1988 and 1991)."</seg>
<seg id="2986">"with biscuits and Bonbons alone, you do not have a big vocalist and any success, regardless of what area, but always discipline, passion and self-winterness."</seg>
<seg id="2987">What kind of man did you experience Georg Ratzinger during the talks about her book?</seg>
<seg id="2988">"Michael Hesemann: through the work on the book and in addition, I experienced Georg Ratzinger really well and again as wonderful, humorous, fundamental, deep faith and heart-good people, from which one cannot imagine that he could only do something to do with a fly."</seg>
<seg id="2989">"I get regularly with how many former domiciles still keep contact with him today, 23 years after his arrest, visit him, read him - he is almost blind and treat him like a member of her family."</seg>
<seg id="2990">"those who do not forgive him to this day, that he once was strictly to them, are clearly in the minority."</seg>
<seg id="2991">Most Domspatzen are grateful to him today that he enriches their lives and brought them to the world of music.</seg>
<seg id="2992">"and that he is always a good, paternal teacher - a strict father, certainly, that may be - but also a lovable respectful person, to which they still look up and to honour them."</seg>
<seg id="2993">"and please, once again clearly: all that you imagine are educational methods that were on the agenda at that time."</seg>
<seg id="2994">We can be glad that we have overcome this time long ago.</seg>
<seg id="2995">"but it is most unjust, a man just because he is prominently and has an even more prominent brother to make a medial scapegoat."</seg>
<seg id="2996">"there is the evil intention behind it, only too obvious."</seg>
<seg id="2997">"for the report, which was just published, relieves it."</seg>
<seg id="2998">"now the stand would command, a 93-year-old man who has acquired great merits and without the outside of Bavaria and perhaps Germany would probably not know the Regensburger Domspatzen, finally in peace."</seg>
