&quot; a spokes@@ man of Sons &amp; Dau@@ ghters said that she was &quot; &quot; shock@@ ed and destroyed &quot; &quot; about his death . &quot;

Jennifer Ani@@ ston : I will always be put into drawers
Jennifer Ani@@ ston must not always be perfect or successful .
this has clearly made the Hollywood star in an interview un@@ ambig@@ uous .
I &apos;m always plug@@ ged into drawers or I &apos;m bor@@ ed from the outside label which I usually have little to do with me and the reality .
I myself don &apos;t have the desire to always be perfect and successful .
&quot; hon@@ estly , these things are rather sn@@ ug@@ ged . &quot;
&quot; Jennifer Ani@@ ston ( 47 ) can only laugh that she is considered &quot; &quot; Miss Perfect &quot; &quot; as she explains in the current cos@@ mop@@ olitan area . &quot;
&quot; actually , the act@@ ress sp@@ ends her time at home , vor@@ m television with a relaxed Dut@@ t and Mexican food , it is said in the magazine . &quot;
&quot; the white glu@@ t brings her the question of child desire : &quot; &quot; we women must not be married or have children to be perfect , &quot; &quot; said the Hollywood star . &quot;
&quot; in her new film &quot; Mother &apos;s Day - love is not a child &apos;s game , &quot; Ani@@ ston is a single mother of two sons . &quot;
the film runs on us from August 25th .
gol@@ fer Lan@@ ger gets the sport pyramid
his experiences on the horse are man@@ age@@ able .
&quot; at the end of a golf tournament in South Africa , Bernhard Lan@@ ger sought a little change with some colleagues with a ride on the beach . &quot;
for the 58 @-@ year @-@ old it was a premiere .
CHI@@ O : &quot; Golden Sports Pyram@@ id &quot; for Bernhard Lan@@ ger
&quot; after a few minutes , the horses remembered their holidays , they hun@@ ted in the fast gal@@ lop home to the for@@ age bows . &quot;
&quot; a kilometer at this pace , I was afraid . &quot;
&quot; it was not a good experience , &quot; Lan@@ ger says . &quot;
so the equ@@ est@@ rian career then ended up again .
&quot; on Saturday , Germany was the best gol@@ fer at all times - 101 tournament entries - again close to horses . &quot;
&quot; he left his family over the grounds of the AL@@ RV , on a horse he did not go for photo purposes . &quot;
a long time was the first time in Aachen and with it also at the CHI@@ O .
the reason was absolutely convincing .
the German sports help handed the man from An@@ hausen in the framework of a small g@@ ala the golden sport pyram@@ ide .
hon@@ ors do not lack the sympath@@ etic ath@@ l@@ ete .
&quot; Champion of the Cross , Silber@@ nes Lor@@ be@@ er@@ blatt , Champions @-@ Tour @-@ Player of the year ... &quot;
even the British Queen has already tried it .
long is the 18th awar@@ dee of the sports pyramid .
&quot; in Aachen , he met the first prize winner Hans Günter Win@@ kler on Saturday . &quot;
&quot; this award gives me a lot , &quot; says Lan@@ ger , &quot; because she is not only awarded for sporting successes but also for social engagement . &quot;
Lan@@ ger has been promoting young talent for decades .
and so he also gave the prize money of 25.000 Euro the same .
&quot; with 15 other outstanding athletes , the two @-@ fold US mast winner was added to the &quot; Hall of F@@ ame des deutschen SPOR@@ TS &quot; on Saturday . &quot;
&quot; the athletes , Hart@@ wig Gau@@ der and Harald Schmit@@ t , the F@@ echter Cornelia Han@@ isch , Alexander P@@ usch and Ar@@ nd Schmit@@ t , the Ru@@ derer Peter @-@ Michael Kol@@ be , the Ru@@ derer Peter @-@ Michael Kol@@ be , the jum@@ per Al@@ win Sch@@ ock@@ em@@ öh@@ le and pos@@ th@@ um of the hand@@ b@@ aller Er@@ hard Wunder@@ lich . &quot;
many of these sports@@ men came to Aachen on Saturday .
&quot; after the official part , the illustri@@ ous company emig@@ rated to the Spring@@ st@@ adion , where the Lav@@ azza prize went . &quot;
Bernhard Lan@@ ger held distance to the big animals .
Clin@@ tons and Tru@@ mps Economic Policy in comparison : it &apos;s all about the money
invest in infrastructure and prevent the T@@ TP trade agreement - both Clinton and Tru@@ mp .
&quot; however , the two US presidential candidates are in the tax and energy policy as well as in a basic question . &quot;
&quot; the difference in economic policy between Donald Tru@@ mp and Hill@@ ary Clinton is a fundamental , more philosophical difference . &quot;
the role of the state .
Tru@@ mp wants to keep the doubts rather small and war@@ ns about how the state can harm the economy - with taxes and regulations .
Clinton wants to che@@ er the economy to death and regulate death he says .
&quot; he himself , on the other hand , would be quite different , says Tru@@ mp . &quot;
&quot; he will be mas@@ sively rec@@ eding regulations , and makes himself strong for a far @-@ reaching tax reform with lower tax rates - for individuals and for companies . &quot;
&quot; Clinton says : the state has to fulfil certain tasks , he has dis@@ advant@@ aged chances to open and needs money . &quot;
&quot; therefore , taxes for the rich would be increased , says . &quot;
&quot; interest@@ ingly , both are very close to the topic of infrastructure . &quot;
&quot; in the future , Tru@@ mp and Clinton say almost the same . &quot;
the democratic candidate is even announc@@ ing the biggest investment in new jobs since the Second World War .
state investment programmes in the infrastructure are classical democratic politics and are strictly rejected by the state @-@ critical Te@@ ap@@ y wing of the Republi@@ cans .
&quot; so , on Tru@@ mp , there could be even party discussions . &quot;
significant are the differences in energy and climate policy .
Tru@@ mp wants to build coal @-@ fired power plants and drive coal mining again in the USA .
&quot; oil production should also be possible in so far protected areas , the Paris climate agreement intends to announce . &quot;
&quot; Clinton , on the other hand , wants to expand and demand renewable energies with its investment programme : &quot; a country will become the super power of clean energy and create millions of jobs . &quot;
&quot; it will be either China , Germany or America - I want us to be . &quot;
&quot; but not only in the infrastructure - even at international trade agreements , both competitors are not too far from each other . &quot;
&quot; T@@ PP , the transp@@ azi@@ one trade agreement , do not want to sign them . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , both the United States do not want to isol@@ ate the US from international trade - but simply better protect American jobs . &quot;
&quot; they are to be paid even better , for example Clinton . &quot;
the current minimum wage of $ 7.@@ 25 is a hunger @-@ wage .
it wants to raise it to 15 dollars per hour .
&quot; what Tru@@ mp wants to do in this issue is not quite clear : once he says : the minimum wage needs to be up , then he says he should not be changed . &quot;
but the great discussion of the months ahead is probably more likely to develop the fiscal policy of the two camps .
&quot; on the one hand , Tru@@ mp , who wants to rel@@ ieve the economy and citizens in order to boost growth . &quot;
&quot; his critics keep him , so the budget defic@@ it would only increase . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , Clinton , who wants at least from the rich wants to pay more taxes , and their critics say : more taxes are also not the solution . &quot;
escape : &quot; every wing@@ ed woman has experiences with sexual violence &quot;
&quot; sexual violence is part of women who are alone , almost to everyday life . &quot;
&quot; when they arrive in Germany , they are often trau@@ mati@@ zed . &quot;
a house offers refuge .
four women sit in a large kitchen .
each one has a baby at the most one year old .
one has laid her little son in her arm .
he looks curious into the room with big eyes .
his mother star@@ es on the table top .
until she notices that she is observed .
she sm@@ iles briefly and kis@@ ses the little ones .
the scene works normally .
until one speaks with Kat@@ rin B@@ ahr .
&quot; she is a business manager of Con@@ dro@@ bs , a carrier for social welfare services in Bavaria , and deals with the topic of women on the run . &quot;
the four women in the kitchen are p@@ oultry .
they live in the north of Munich in one of the few de@@ centr@@ alised accommodation for all @-@ wing@@ ed women and their children in Bavaria .
&quot; in January , Con@@ dro@@ bs established the facility together with Pro Famili@@ a and the Munich Women &apos;s Aid . &quot;
&quot; recently , it has been officially opened . &quot;
60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children .
there are no men - also not as visitors .
the exception is a guard in front of the door .
&quot; it is not exagger@@ ated to say : every woman who arrives here has experience on their escape experiences with sexual violence , &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot;
&quot; men flee because of wars because they are persec@@ uted politically because torture or death thre@@ aten or because their families send them to Europe as the hope of hope . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; in women there are other reasons for the escape : &quot; many ste@@ al secre@@ tly , because they don &apos;t see any other way out . &quot;
&quot; her homeland has made her experience with sexual violence , forced marri@@ ages , murder , slavery or forced pro@@ stitution . &quot;
this drives them away .
on the run this goes on .
&quot; that tu@@ g@@ boats for example demand a bottle of water a sexual act is no rar@@ ity , &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot;
and the women are alone ; they are not protected by their families .
&quot; who believes that the end , as soon as they arrived in Germany , ir@@ re , tells B@@ ahr . &quot;
&quot; here too , single women in refugee shel@@ ters would often be regarded as inferior and worst . &quot;
&quot; this means that about 90 percent of women living in the accommodation in the north of Munich are trau@@ mati@@ zed , they appreciate . &quot;
&quot; some of the children are certainly not created voluntarily . &quot;
many women are used to say nothing .
&quot; or they don &apos;t dare to talk openly about the experience , because the shame is too big . &quot;
&quot; since they are often unable to assist , there are more accommodations only for them , ur@@ ges B@@ ahr . &quot;
&quot; in Bavaria , the seven district governments are responsible for the accommodation of refugees . &quot;
&quot; on the question of whether they knew from a similar project as in Munich in their jurisdiction , some respond with no . &quot;
&quot; in the Upper Pal@@ at@@ inate and Upper Fran@@ conia , there is no such thing in the accommodation of the governments . &quot;
&quot; also in Sw@@ ab@@ ians alone , escaped women are not accommod@@ ated separately , says Karl @-@ Heinz Meyer , spokes@@ man of the government . &quot;
&quot; in Upper Bavaria , Lower and Central Fran@@ conia , there are floors or own houses only for single women and their children . &quot;
&quot; the exception is Nieder@@ bay@@ ern , there are two central accommodations exclusively for women . &quot;
the committee &quot; Rights of Women and Gender E@@ quality &quot; in the European Parliament also calls for women to be separated from men .
&quot; in a study published for the committee , it says : &quot; it is very important that men and women are being accommod@@ ated separately . &quot;
&quot; lacking privacy , or are men and women accommod@@ ated together , it can become - perpet@@ ual - violence against women . &quot;
&quot; above all , the wash@@ rooms should be divided separately and for women easily accessible , is available in the study . &quot;
&quot; how much the women feel this protective need can be read at the rush , which there is on the house in Munich . &quot;
&quot; since we have been talking about it , we have a long waiting list , &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot;
one could easily get a second home .
assistance psychiat@@ ri@@ sts : demands for new labour amp@@ ut@@ ations
representatives of the assist@@ ants have called on their union to appro@@ ve new labor @-@ fighting measures in their dispute with regard to a new treaty .
the Junior Doc@@ tors Committee ( J@@ DC ) of the British Medical Association ( B@@ MA ) demanded the entire council to appro@@ ve more labour amp@@ ut@@ ations from the beginning of September .
the J@@ DC said that the ministers failed to deal with the concerns regarding the contract .
&quot; in July , assist@@ ants and medical students agreed on the rejection of a contract agreed with the B@@ MA . &quot;
he was rejected by 58 % of his members who voted in the elections .
&quot; in a letter to the members who were published on Thursday evening on Twitter , the chairman of the J@@ DC Ellen Mc@@ Court said that the government would have remained &quot; &quot; persistent &quot; &quot; to problems , which led to the treaty being rejected . &quot;
&quot; she said : &quot; considering this , the J@@ DC Executive Board agreed to fully reject the proposed new contract and calls for official new negotiations to all your concerns . &quot;
&quot; as an answer to the silence of the government , the J@@ DC Executive Board has made a formal request for a special meeting of the B@@ MA Council to appro@@ ve a running programme of escal@@ ating labour amp@@ utation which begins in the beginning of September . &quot;
&quot; the disputes led to the fact that assist@@ ants this year struck six sm@@ al strike , the first total cases in the history of N@@ HS . &quot;
&quot; the Head of the B@@ MA Assistant Doctor Dr. Johann Mal@@ aw@@ ana came back after the election to reject the agreed contractual conditions , which were advised by the B@@ MA . &quot;
&quot; he shared B@@ MA members during the meetings that took place before the vote by 54@@ .000 assist@@ ants and medical students , with the fact that the contract should be beneficial and accepted . &quot;
&quot; after the vote , the Minister of Health Jerem@@ y H@@ unt said that the contract for physicians in England would inevitably be introduced . &quot;
Russia and Turkey : an &quot; alliance of out@@ si@@ ders &quot; ?
it was a gest@@ ure that ended a crisis .
the leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to surrender their hands and proc@@ laim an official end of the eight month long war of words and economic sanctions .
&quot; but when Vladimir Putin receives his Turkish counter@@ part in the gold plated Hall of St. Petersburg palace , I cannot for@@ bid myself that Ankara would like this reconciliation . &quot;
&quot; there was the hand@@ shake , yes . &quot;
&quot; but Putin sm@@ iled sm@@ iling and he hardly radi@@ ated heat , even for his restra@@ ined circumstances . &quot;
Rec@@ ep Tay@@ y@@ ip Erd@@ og@@ an said repeatedly from his &quot; dear friend &quot; Putin - according to a report all five times .
I couldn &apos;t count it any more .
&quot; he also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis , but will even improve . &quot;
&quot; the next day , a newspaper described that Erd@@ og@@ an beha@@ ved like this would never happen . &quot;
&quot; for me , his enthusiasm seemed to indicate the opposite . &quot;
&quot; but one of Putin exu@@ ber@@ ant , sustainable refriger@@ ation showed that Russia &apos;s head of state had nothing to forget . &quot;
&quot; rather , the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his introduc@@ tory words : the down@@ fall of a Russian fighter aircraft on the Syrian border through Turkey . &quot;
Moscow &apos;s reaction to the time was kind@@ led .
Putin shared and accused Ankara to please Russia in his back .
the transgres@@ sion was even bigger since it was committed by a supposed friend .
to re@@ build the v@@ etr@@ ack becomes difficult if not even impossible .
the public opinion in Russia has changed since November .
&quot; the state @-@ controlled media conducted a violent , un@@ restricted attack on Ankara for a few months . &quot;
suddenly it seemed as if the Tur@@ ks would bear the blame for everything .
&quot; most serious were the alleg@@ ations of senior officials , that Erd@@ og@@ gans had prof@@ ited their own family from illegal oil trade in Syria , controlled by the so @-@ called Islamic State . &quot;
he denied this v@@ ehem@@ ently .
&quot; but in St. Petersburg , the official message was that it was time to look forward . &quot;
&quot; finally , this meeting took place only because Putin received the exc@@ use that he wanted to hear from the President Erd@@ og@@ an . &quot;
Russia could book a kind of victory .
&quot; for Ankara , the advantages of a ce@@ as@@ ef@@ ire are clear on the hand . &quot;
&quot; Erd@@ og@@ an mainly needs all friends he can get , after having been enth@@ used almost his ministry last month with a failed coup d &quot; é@@ tat . &quot;
repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey have also sh@@ aken him .
but there are also economic motives .
&quot; Russian sanctions have hit Turkey hard , especially the prohibition of charter flights that usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast every year . &quot;
the number has declined by almost 90 % .
&quot; in Russia , travel operators and charter companies will be reli@@ eved when the flights are res@@ um@@ ed . &quot;
they count on a late imperial ons@@ lau@@ ght to the Mediterranean .
&quot; this week , the state television predicted cheap fruit and vegetables as soon as the Turkish agricultural imports are allowed to be restored . &quot;
&quot; a report in Ve@@ dem@@ sti described it as follows : &quot; &quot; tourists there long , tomatoes here long . &quot;
but the visit had an additional political value for Moscow .
&quot; Ankara is angry at the West , as it considers his response to the attempted tak@@ eover of power as a weak answer . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the ongoing Gro@@ ll on the sn@@ ail emp@@ o of EU accession negotiations and Putin - who is pi@@ ped to benefit from the cool atmosphere and reduce the relationship of Turkey to the West . &quot;
the Russian Minister of State won a bonus for Ankara in Ankara that he sought after the attempted coup d &quot; é@@ tat support for the elected state organs .
&quot; this is well @-@ known for Moscow , a matter of course that even a deep @-@ fitting fear of reg@@ ression changes . &quot;
&quot; the summit in this splendid palace at the sea enabled Russia and Turkey to portra@@ y an &quot; &quot; alliance of out@@ si@@ ders &quot; &quot; : two countries that viol@@ ate the West and feel badly treated and now alli@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , despite the public reconciliation , there are still large differences between the two . &quot;
&quot; the biggest difference is Syria , where Moscow recently gave itself the role as a peac@@ em@@ akers , but where Russia and Turkey support opposing sides . &quot;
it could be significant that after almost three hours of initial talks both pres@@ idents at the press conference said they had not even stri@@ pped the issue .
&quot; the President of Turkey inten@@ tionally im@@ min@@ ent to answer a question about their differences , while Putin decided to emphas@@ ise this . &quot;
there is no clear consensus on where a common denom@@ in@@ ator can be found in Syria .
&quot; but after months of open hos@@ tilities - and in the face of the potential for a perfect disaster , when NATO member Turkey broke down the Russian fighter - it is certainly better that the two heads of state talk at least once again . &quot;
Royal Bank of Scotland is no longer available for customers outside Scotland
&quot; according to the Bank &apos;s Executive Board , the R@@ BS will only be reduced to a back office role . &quot;
the Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer be available for customers outside Scotland .
R@@ oss Mc@@ E@@ wan distributed BBC Scotland that the R@@ BS brand was connected to the Bank &apos;s global ambi@@ tions .
&quot; since then , the Bank has dis@@ soci@@ ated itself since it had to be collap@@ sed and saved almost eight years ago . &quot;
&quot; during this time , brand @-@ label &quot; R@@ BS &quot; has used to protect other end consumer goods . &quot;
&quot; she supported the international sport with millions of pounds of sponsor@@ ship , from Six Nations Rugby to Wim@@ ble@@ don winner Andy Mur@@ ray . &quot;
but now she decided to put more national brands in the focus .
&quot; the Royal Bank of Scotland will only be available to customers in Scotland , but will not be initi@@ alized . &quot;
&quot; in England and Wales , all RS@@ B references , the de@@ centralized headquarters and the stock exchange are changed to Nat@@ West . &quot;
the Ul@@ ster Bank brand is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland .
&quot; there are other , smaller brands for retail banking that will receive more importance - C@@ out@@ ts , Adam &amp; Co , Dru@@ m@@ mond and Hol@@ t &apos;s Military Bank . &quot;
Mc@@ E@@ wan was inter@@ viewed during a viewing tour of customers and employees in In@@ ver@@ ness @-@ Sh@@ ire .
&quot; he shared the BBC Scotland with : &quot; &quot; the RS@@ B brand becomes our investment stamp and the brand that our employees are busy since we are now becoming more of a bank of brands . &quot;
&quot; as the bank itself became a global brand , R@@ BS became a global brand . &quot;
&quot; I say now that we do not pursue any global goals , but local objectives . &quot;
each of these brands will be completely different in their own communities and our employees will work among these brands with the customers .
R@@ BS has already said that its Six Nations Sponsor@@ ing will no longer continue and that it will increase the percep@@ ti@@ bility of the different brands in his sports sponsor@@ ship .
&quot; it is time for us to develop into the bank of the brands , because how do we concentrate on the inside ( we asked ) to make this a better bank for customers ? &quot; &quot; said the Executive Board . &quot;
&quot; it would have been very cy@@ ni@@ cal three years ago , if we had said that we would be a great bank for our customers and have launched these brands . &quot;
&quot; but with our work , the focus on customer needs and not our own , I think , you will see many changes . &quot;
&quot; we can again launch these brands , so I think the time has come . &quot;
Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori reaches its 3.0@@ 00@@ th win at New@@ market on Pre@@ dil@@ ection

the jo@@ ck@@ ey Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori secured his 3.0@@ 00@@ th British profit at New@@ market on Friday .
&quot; on his local race track , he set a milestone on his local race track with his second prize of the night . &quot;
the 45 @-@ year @-@ old Italian is the sixth Jo@@ ck@@ ey who reaches the milestone in the flat race .
&quot; he follows Sir Gordon Ri@@ chards , Dou@@ g Smith , L@@ ester Pig@@ got@@ t , P@@ at Ed@@ dry and Wil@@ lie Car@@ son . &quot;
&quot; the three @-@ time winner D@@ ett@@ ori , who previously won G@@ ha@@ y@@ y@@ ar , said : &quot; it is something special . &quot;
I am very emotional because my family is here too
I am very happy that it happened at New@@ market because I landed here 30 years ago .
&quot; it &apos;s not a big meeting , it &apos;s not Royal As@@ cot - it &apos;s a ban@@ al Friday evening with 20,000 people . &quot;
I am reli@@ eved and very modest .
D@@ ett@@ ori takes the jubil@@ ee when he gets the victory on Pre@@ dil@@ ection
&quot; two jo@@ ck@@ eys have reached the milestone in the obstacle @-@ race - Jo@@ ck@@ ey Richard Johnson and the retired 20 @-@ time winner Sir Anthony Mc@@ Co@@ y , who reached over 4,@@ 300 wins in a re@@ warding career . &quot;
&quot; L@@ ester Pig@@ got@@ t , the nine @-@ time der@@ b@@ ysi@@ eger had 4,@@ 493 Career &quot;
Frank@@ ie is one of the best jo@@ ck@@ ey of Modernis@@ m and it &apos;s no surprise that he reached this milestone that only a few before him reached .
&quot; he has style and is strong , but it is his tac@@ tical int@@ ell@@ ect that distingu@@ ishes him from the other in the weight control room . &quot;
&quot; he is a fantastic ambassador for races , his enthusiasm and char@@ isma thr@@ ills fans for years for this sport . &quot;
&quot; I said Frank@@ ie a few weeks ago at Ep@@ som that he would have fet@@ ched 6,000 gains if he would not only be a weekend and grand@@ tur@@ ni@@ er@@ jo@@ ck@@ ey ! &quot;
Frank@@ ie has already s@@ led in the UK almost 30 years of winning what is great .
&quot; he has a living personality , which is good for a British race , but in addition he is an unbelievable yo@@ ck@@ ey . &quot;
Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori celebrated the milestone with a typical Flying Dis@@ mount
&quot; flying F@@ ishes to Flying Dis@@ moun@@ ts , Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori has been the flag@@ ship of the British flat race for two decades . &quot;
it was ner@@ ven@@ ous .
&quot; a whole series of grand tur@@ ni@@ sts , including his famous &quot; Gl@@ orious Seven &quot; 1996 in As@@ cot , but he also survived a plane crash and received a drug prohibition . &quot;
&quot; three years ago , he had difficulties when he returned from his six @-@ month lock , but he showed an impressive characteristic strength to de@@ fy his doub@@ ters and to return to his best form . &quot;
and he is not yet at the end - D@@ ett@@ ori has once said that he wants to continue with competitions up to at least 50.@@ ten years of life .
Russian Putin mo@@ ist Stab@@ sch@@ ef Serge@@ i Ivan@@ ov
Russian President Vladimir Putin un@@ expect@@ edly dismis@@ sed his Chief of Staff Serge@@ i Ivan@@ ov .
Ivan@@ ov was a part of Putin &apos;s narrow@@ est part of confidence .
the 63 @-@ year @-@ old was appointed Special Represent@@ ative for Environmental and Transport Affairs .
&quot; in an opinion of the Kre@@ m@@ lin , it is that Putin without giving reasons &quot; dismis@@ sed Ivan@@ ov@@ s of his duties as Chairman of the Russian Pres@@ idential Administration . &quot;
&quot; Anton V@@ ain@@ o , who was Vice President since 2012 , was appointed to his successor . &quot;
&quot; V@@ ain@@ o , 44 , is a former diplom@@ at . &quot;
&quot; born in the Est@@ onian capital of Tallinn in 1972 , he graduated from the prestigious State Moscow Institute for International Relations ( M@@ GI@@ MO ) and worked in the Tokyo emb@@ assy . &quot;
&quot; on the Kre@@ m@@ lin &apos;s website , it is called ( in Russian ) that he later became the chief executive and manager of the government staff . &quot;
he said to Putin about his appointment : &quot; thank you for your confidence . &quot;
I think it is the main task of the government to support your work as head of state regarding bills of law and controls to implement your instructions .
Putin shared the Russian TV channel on Friday that Ivan@@ ov asked to leave his post and recommended V@@ ain@@ o as his successor .
convincing the sm@@ iling faces ?
this step has made Moscow mysterious .
&quot; Serge@@ i Ivan@@ ov was a long time one of Vladimir Putin &apos;s narrow@@ est confi@@ d@@ ants and works as he worked for the Soviet intelligence service , the K@@ GB . &quot;
&quot; as Chief of Staff , he was one of the most powerful men in the country . &quot;
&quot; at a meeting with President Putin , which was broad@@ cast@@ ed on television , both men claimed that the Chief of Staff res@@ um@@ ed at his own request . &quot;
&quot; but despite the smile for the cameras , only a few of them are convinced - especially now , just before the parliamentary elections . &quot;
is this the result of a kind of power struggle ?
nobody knows this at the moment .
&quot; but the official asser@@ tion - that a man , who once was praised as a potential president , would once again lead to the Russian environmental policy - pushed on great scep@@ ticism . &quot;
&quot; in his remarks on Putin , who are quoted on the Kre@@ m@@ lin &apos;s website , Ivan@@ ov said , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s true that I asked you in a conversation at the beginning of 2012 - you could almost say - confi@@ dently entr@@ ust for four years . &quot;
&quot; as it turns out , I have been chairman of the Russian presidential office for four years and eight months . &quot;
Ivan@@ ov took the post in December 2011 .
previously he was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence .
he is a member of the Russian Security Council and as Putin &apos;s former member of the State Security Service K@@ GB .
&quot; in the late 1990s , when Putin was chairman of the Federal Security Service ( F@@ SB ) , who replaced the K@@ GB , Ivan@@ ov was appointed his dep@@ uty . &quot;
&quot; when Putin came to power , he called Ivan@@ ov as one of five people he trusted in most . &quot;

criminal Min@@ ds Star Thomas Gi@@ b@@ son fired after he struck producers
Gi@@ b@@ son was involved in a physical examination at the set of the series in Los Angeles last month .
ABC Studios and C@@ BS Television Studios which produce the series announced in a common opinion his dismis@@ sal .
&quot; Gi@@ b@@ son , who played the Special Agent Aaron Hot@@ chner , ap@@ ologi@@ zed on Thursday before the announcement of his dismis@@ sal . &quot;
on the set it came to artistic differences and a difference of opinion .
&quot; I rep@@ ent the incident , &quot; he said in a message . &quot;
&quot; details of how the character of Gi@@ bs@@ ons from the series , which follows a team of F@@ BI agents , is expected to be published at a later date according to ABC Studios and C@@ BS Television Studios . &quot;
&quot; the 54 year old , who previously played in Sit@@ com D@@ har@@ ma &amp; Gre@@ g , has been involved since the first season of the series in 2005 . &quot;
&quot; I love criminal Min@@ ds and put my whole heart@@ beat in the last twelve years , &quot; &quot; said Gi@@ b@@ son in an announcement published on Friday . &quot;
&quot; I had hoped to be there until the end , but it will not be possible now . &quot;
&quot; I would like to thank the authors , producers , actors , our wonderful crew and especially the best fans who can only wish for a series . &quot;
the scheduled char@@ isma of the twel@@ fth season is scheduled for September 28th .
rid@@ dle of fish that landed in the garden in Ban@@ ff
&quot; one inhabit@@ ant of Ban@@ ff called for help in identifying the fish , which appeared in its garden in Ban@@ ff . &quot;
Kevin B@@ ain thinks that the 75 fish could deal with Sand@@ a@@ als that were mir@@ r@@ ored by a fountain of foun@@ tains .
&quot; Mr. B@@ ain , who lives about 500 meters from the sea , published a video of the spectacle on Per@@ is@@ cope in the hope that someone could throw some light on the appearance of the two inches long fishes . &quot;
Que@@ ens@@ ferry Crossing : bridge now connected with Fi@@ fe
the £ 1.@@ 35 billion expensive project is scheduled to be completed by May 2017
engineers have connected the north deck of the Que@@ ens@@ ferry cross@@ ings with the vi@@ a@@ duct - which means that the bridge is now connected to fi@@ fe .
&quot; it is the first of four closures of the &quot; &quot; ceiling fans &quot; , &quot; which approach the completion by each of the three towers of the bridge . &quot;
the bridge section of Fi@@ fe is now 600 meters long and weighs 30.000 tons .
&quot; it has 10,000 tonnes of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete as well as 46 obli@@ que ropes . &quot;
the £ 1.@@ 35 billion expensive project is expected to be completed by May 2017 .
&quot; today , Keith Brown opened a visit to the construction site and was one of the first to move from the country to the bridge . &quot;
he said : &quot; this is a historical and symbolic moment when building the Que@@ ens@@ ferry cross@@ ings .
&quot; we are all witnesses of an engineering craft of a truly epic proportions in this project with more than 30,000 tons of concrete and steel used alone for this part of the bridge . &quot;
&quot; despite the massive size and weight of the bridge , the completion of the connection between the vi@@ a@@ duct and the bridge deck is a delicate activity requiring extremely precise toler@@ ances for fit . &quot;
&quot; in total , almost 79 % of the total bridge deck at its place and the last section of the deck today gets a concrete pit for the deck , which means that the entire deck is ready to be lifted up on the bridge to its place . &quot;
&quot; Michael Martin , project leader of For@@ th Crossing Bridge Construc@@ tors said : &quot; &quot; the first sh@@ utter is a significant milestone in each bridge project . &quot;
&quot; in this fantastic project , the clas@@ p presents trend @-@ setting high @-@ speed and civil engineering . &quot;
&quot; after installing the last stretch of road and its connection with the northern tower , we had to close the existing gap in the north or country side . &quot;
this was achieved by drag@@ ging the northern part bridge 700 milli@@ metres south .
this was a massive and very delicate activity at the same time .
&quot; massive , since the Vi@@ a@@ duct is 222 meters long , weighs about 6,000 tons and had to be pulled upwards by a inc@@ line of approx . 3 % . &quot;
&quot; healing , as the toler@@ ances , on which the team works , were tiny - on each side they were only a few millimeters . &quot;
luck@@ ily everything went very well .
rescue in Mo@@ el@@ fr@@ e Bay : three men have &quot; luck still to be alive &quot;
&quot; three men have &quot; &quot; luck still to be alive &quot; &quot; after they were thrown from fishing boat to Angl@@ es@@ ey . &quot;
the Mo@@ el@@ fr@@ e R@@ N@@ LI Res@@ cue Centre struck alarm on Friday at 13 : 20 B@@ ST alarm after a crew watched the event in Mo@@ el@@ fr@@ e Bay .
the three men had difficulties to swim while their boat moved out of their own power .
&quot; we saw how the boat turned around and turned the worst off , &quot; &quot; said the head of the Mo@@ el@@ fr@@ e Vin@@ ce Jones rescue station . &quot;
&quot; fortunately , the strong winds have already blown the boat out of their reach until we left water , &quot; he added . &quot;
&quot; two of the men were saved by a local fishing boat , while the third man was exhausted at the age of 60 and was found at a Bo@@ je suspended without a life@@ jacket . &quot;
they all came aboard the coastal rescue boat and were brought back to the rescue station
&quot; Jones said , &quot; The three men who were thrown into the water have luck un@@ har@@ med and still alive . &quot;
&quot; the boot engine had an emergency stop , however , this sol@@ dered loos@@ ely during the boots of the boat from the person who ste@@ ered the boat . &quot;
someone has awak@@ ened today about these men .
seriously injured - man pun@@ ishes his ex @-@ girl@@ friend
a man has attacked his ex @-@ girl@@ friend in Hamburg @-@ Harb@@ urg with a knife and seriously injured .
&quot; as the police hur@@ ried yesterday , the 50 @-@ year @-@ old had the key to the apartment to get his personal things . &quot;
&quot; instead , the alcoholic perpet@@ r@@ ator cut off the clothes of his ex @-@ girl@@ friend . &quot;
&quot; when he came to the apartment , he stab@@ bed them twice . &quot;
the 44 @-@ year @-@ old was hurt by the hand and at the body .
the police could arrest the perpet@@ r@@ ator .
&quot; while the 50 @-@ year @-@ old destroyed the clothes of his ex @-@ girl@@ friend , he called his mother . &quot;
this al@@ arm@@ oured then his sister .
&quot; together with their partner , the 45 @-@ year @-@ old wanted to calm her brother . &quot;
but she couldn &apos;t move him to leave the apartment .
that is why she went out of the house with her partner .
on the street they met the husband &apos;s ex @-@ partner .
&quot; when the two women entered the apartment again , the fifty @-@ year @-@ old sli@@ pped his sister to the side and attacked his ex @-@ girl@@ friend . &quot;
who builds cheap apartments ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD and the Green ones mean : investors should be taken much stronger in the future . &quot;
how do you react to the bad news that Braunschweig will lose almost 1300 cheap apartments over the next few years ?
&quot; the SPD proposes a &quot; &quot; Action Concept &quot; &quot; for the next council session . &quot;
but contro@@ vers@@ y is programmed .
first and foremost it is about the question : who is supposed to build the cheap apartments ?
a regulation is missing so far .
&quot; the president of the SPD leader Christoph Brat@@ mann says : &quot; &quot; we are united with the Gre@@ ens : whoever wants to build on urban areas must in future have to exhibit 20 percent of all apartments as social housing . &quot;
&quot; however , the cheap apartments can also be made in stock . &quot;
&quot; however , the big issue in the town hall was , as Brat@@ mann : &quot; how do we deal with investors that want to build on private surfaces ? &quot;
&quot; we want investors to build at least 10 percent on such sites , but as 20 percent of homes as social housing . &quot;
&quot; a new urban housing construction program , which will cost millions of money and must still be financed , is intended to provide incen@@ tives . &quot;
&quot; the problem , as Brat@@ man : &quot; there is currently no agreement between the fac@@ tions . &quot;
the CD@@ U wants to make investors as few regulations as possible .
the left wants even harder conditions for investors .
&quot; not@@ with@@ standing , as Brat@@ man , a shar@@ pen@@ ing of the situation on the housing market . &quot;
&quot; if the concept of action is implemented , it will take care of additional tasks in the building management . &quot;
more staff is required .
it is uncle@@ ar whether we get the professionals .
&quot; yet the program is not entirely new : because the approximately 12@@ 60 new apartments , which should be built anyway . &quot;
but how do you compare the loss of more than 1300 cheap apartments whose funding will run over the next few years ?
&quot; only by 2020 alone , there will be 500 apartments . &quot;
&quot; to prevent this , such as the planning policy spokes@@ person Nicole Palm , should now buy @-@ out Bind@@ ings from the city . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it would have to be thought of taking flats again back into the price binding . &quot;
this is possible in the west town .
on one blow the problem could be solved .
for in the west city run for the end of the year .
around 1800 flats you could get back into the price binding for cheap apartments .
&quot; only : this does not want the owners , the housing companies . &quot;
&quot; because the number of social housing in the west town is again increased dramatically , it is removed from the goal of the so @-@ called mixture . &quot;
there will no longer be a concentration of social weak in just a few districts .
the Gre@@ ens anticip@@ ate that there will still be movement in the discussion .
&quot; leader Holger Her@@ lit@@ sch@@ ke says : &quot; &quot; for a broad majority , the CD@@ U must go into the boat . &quot;
this concentr@@ ates on more construction sites for single family homes .
but what does not mean is that a compromise can still be found .
Pok@@ é@@ mon Go is a hunt for health and happiness that pays off
it is fascinating to watch how the world is changing .
&quot; the fact that teenagers and children no longer go outside , but rather prefer to spend their leisure time on screens , has been lam@@ ented by many in the last decade . &quot;
Pok@@ emon Go is about getting people out of the sofa and become more active .
&quot; the time on the screen was initially limited to the TV , then on video games and at least on smartphones . &quot;
it is therefore great to see that technology and outdoor activities are not mut@@ ually exclusive .
&quot; naturally I refer to the Pok@@ é@@ mon Go @-@ W@@ ahn , an app based on the characters that were initially created for video games in the 199@@ 0@@ ies ( later a carto@@ on series , playing cards and other spin @-@ off@@ s ) . &quot;
&quot; as many phenomena of pop culture decreased the interest in the release of the game in the US , Australia and New Zealand in early July . &quot;
the market launch in other countries has been postpon@@ ed by massive demand that over@@ load the servers .
&quot; within days , Pok@@ é@@ mon Go had more users than T@@ inder and almost as many as Twitter . &quot;
how does it work ?
&quot; in short , players go outside with their smartphones and search for Pok@@ é@@ m@@ ons that are followed by a GPS and once they were found &quot; &quot; photograph@@ ed &quot; &quot; ( using a screen@@ shot on the mobile phone ) or &quot; &quot; captured &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; a generation playing the game when she was younger , joined the W@@ ahn and j@@ ump@@ ed for the search of the sofa . &quot;
&quot; in the United States , the game led to a considerable increase in steps that the &quot; average &quot; person re@@ stores every day . &quot;
&quot; Cardi@@ ogram , an app for Apple Watch , followed by 35@@ ,000 users , informed the Washington Post recently that within two days after market launch of the game , the number of people followed that exercise every day 30 minutes , from 45 percent to 53 percent . &quot;
the company does not know who playing Pok@@ é@@ mon Go - it merely looks the raw data to increase performance .
&quot; many public awareness campaigns for health , people want to take &quot; 30 minutes time , &quot; &quot; coming from the sofa , &quot; and &quot; to be active every day , &quot; bite on de@@ af ears , because many public messages are bor@@ ed for health and coming from people who look mis@@ erable . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , the importance of sport cannot be over@@ valued . &quot;
anyone who regularly drives sport reduces his chances of getting cancer or depression .
&quot; physical activity helps in weight control , high blood pressure , diabetes and a long list of benefits that is too long to guide them here . &quot;
but the Wonder@@ ful at Pok@@ é@@ mon Go is that it brings people to do something outdoors that makes them fun .
&quot; thus three pillars of health are covered - movement , fresh air and sunshine as well as fun . &quot;
some people even close new friend@@ ships on the hunt .
&quot; as always , there are mos@@ quit@@ oes that must always compl@@ ain about something . &quot;
&quot; and yes , someone could walk against a door . &quot;
what is it ?
it has made a breakthrough .
&quot; even if smartphone apps like Fit@@ bit could track our activity earlier , they gave us no reason to play sports as it does this game . &quot;
the new will lose its charm and use it with time .
&quot; because of Pok@@ em@@ ons &apos;s success , however , there will be more games that will unite apps and virtual reality with the activ@@ ist in the real world and will help many people on the hunt to be more active , f@@ itter and health@@ ier . &quot;

Simone Bil@@ es creates gold in Dam@@ entur@@ nen
forget the print .
forget the hyp@@ e .
Simone Bil@@ es is on all that im@@ mu@@ n .
dynamic on the jumping horse .
effort@@ less on the beam .
breathtaking on the ground .
on whole line brilliant .
and now finally Olympic champion .
the 19 @-@ year @-@ old American gymn@@ ast climb@@ ed on Thursday to a multi @-@ campaign title and enlarged the gap between itself and the rest of the world before all eyes under the head@@ light of the Olympic Games .
&quot; their overall result of 6@@ 2,@@ 198 was clearly in front of the silver med@@ alli@@ sts and &quot; Final Five &quot; team member A@@ ly R@@ ais@@ man and the Russian bronze med@@ alli@@ sts Ali@@ ya Must@@ af@@ ina . &quot;
&quot; the Americans Simone Bil@@ es on the Swe@@ ater beam during the individual multi @-@ campaign of women at the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro 2016 , Brazil , Thursday . &quot;
&quot; Bil@@ es is the fourth h@@ eter@@ os@@ exual woman who wins a multi @-@ campaign title and overall the fifth , while she soli@@ di@@ fies her reputation to be the best of her generation or even at all . &quot;
she broke down in tears when her final result was shown and her long journey at that moment found an end .
this success puts them in the same league as unique athletes such as Michael P@@ helps who brought their sports to new heights :
&quot; Bil@@ es has dominated her sports art over the last three years , 15 world master medals - including 10 gold medals - including 10 gold medals - with so amazing exercises that the Olympic champion of 1984 Mary Lo@@ u Rett@@ on said she &quot; &quot; The best gymn@@ ast I &apos;ve ever seen . &quot;
&quot; they expected a final test in Brazil , a competition not so much between Bil@@ es and the rest of the athletes , but rather between her and a burden of over@@ sized expectations . &quot;
&quot; not returning with a hand@@ ful of gold back to the family in Spring , Texas , would be considered a dis@@ appointment . &quot;
&quot; the Americans Simone Bil@@ es , left , and A@@ ly R@@ ais@@ man embrac@@ ed themselves after winning gold and silver in the individual multi @-@ campaign of women in the summer Games in Rio de Janeiro , Brazil , Thursday , &quot;
&quot; Bil@@ lion took the first medal on Tuesday , while on the f@@ are@@ well party of the team coordin@@ ator Martha Kar@@ oly@@ i served as ex@@ clam@@ ation marks . &quot;
&quot; although it insist@@ ed that during their long path to the top , never planned the future , this is not really true . &quot;
a part of their soil exercises - which contain their typical Tum@@ bling Pass - is matched to Latin American music that would fit at home on the street outside the Olympic arena in Rio .
this is not a coinci@@ dence .
&quot; this girl , who was adopted by her grand@@ parents as a little child and was discovered by trainer A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ man &apos;s mother during a school excursion into the gymn@@ asi@@ um , was trained in the Bo@@ or@@ man . &quot;
&quot; since the summer of 2013 , she has lost no competition for a multi @-@ war competition , a winning series that will stop as long as it wishes . &quot;
&quot; even though Must@@ af@@ ina was slightly led by two turns , the picture was dec@@ ep@@ tive . &quot;
Schwe@@ be@@ beams and Bo@@ dent@@ ur@@ ns - in which Bil@@ es holds the World Champion title - lau@@ ded .
she again picked up again with 15,@@ 433 on the floating beam - and continued with a 15,@@ 9@@ 33 on the floor . &quot;
&quot; R@@ ais@@ man embrac@@ ed her sof@@ tly as she expected her der@@ g@@ b@@ nis - a pure form@@ ality - and tears flow@@ ed on Bil@@ es shiny red , white and blue eyel@@ iner , as the vision she once described in her collective book , became reality . &quot;
&quot; the performance of R@@ ais@@ mans was a revenge for the last time four years ago when it fought for the third place , but the bronze medal went to Must@@ af@@ ina in a Ti@@ eb@@ ra@@ ke . &quot;
&quot; this time , the 22 @-@ year @-@ old team of teams , called &quot; &quot; O@@ ma &quot; &quot; by the Americans , had a lead . &quot;
&quot; after her soil exercise , she threw up the audience of K@@ us@@ sh@@ ead , overwhel@@ med by a com@@ eback , which sometimes seemed dou@@ bt@@ ful . &quot;
&quot; as for Bil@@ es , the year @-@ old twe@@ et of the 19 @-@ year @-@ old has a very new meaning at the beginning of this week : &quot;
police : 3 victims in mass mur@@ der@@ ation shot in the car listening in the car
&quot; according to police reports published on Thursday , two women and a 12 @-@ year old girl were shot , who have been killed in one of the dead@@ liest attacks since a decade in the first killer fall of Phoenix , while they stopped in the car and heard music . &quot;
&quot; Angela Rochelle Liner , Stefanie R. El@@ lis and El@@ lis daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah were shot on June 12 , while the car was par@@ ked while driving , the authorities said . &quot;
the perpet@@ r@@ ator fired eight shots from a hand@@ fire weapon while standing on the passenger side of the car and then fled with another vehicle to read in the report .
&quot; the police told that the triple murder would not have been the result of a rob@@ ber@@ y over@@ sight , as the att@@ acker did not take the hand@@ bags or the $ 2,@@ 900 , owned by one of the adult victims . &quot;
the police spokes@@ man of Phoenix S@@ g@@ t. Jonathan Howard said that the fo@@ undry managed the investig@@ ators to see a closer look at whether they are connected to four previous attacks .
&quot; in total , seven people were killed in His@@ panic neighbor@@ hoods within four months and two more injured . &quot;
&quot; it happens in a residential area in front of a house , &quot; told Howard the K@@ HP@@ O , a subsidiary of C@@ BS , beginning of the month . &quot;
&quot; it is assumed that the susp@@ ects have used several vehicles , including a brown Nis@@ sans from the late 199@@ 0@@ ies , a black BMW from the late 199@@ 0@@ ies and a white Cadi@@ l@@ lac or Lincoln . &quot;
the investig@@ ators refused to expose the evidence that they have led to the conclusion that the attacks were linked and were committed by the same mur@@ derer .
&quot; El@@ lis , 33 , was hospit@@ alised because of her injuries and died later . &quot;
&quot; lin@@ ers , 31 , and El@@ lis , daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah died on the spot . &quot;
a witness told the police that it was not unusual for them to sit in a par@@ ked car and listen to music .
&quot; the authorities also published a police report on fo@@ undry , who died on an empty pick@@ up truck half an hour before the triple murder , and from that it was the work of the serial killer . &quot;
investig@@ ators found cartridge sleeves and secured a ball from the seat as well as ball fragments from the engine compartment .
mother of a 6 @-@ year @-@ old with a micro@@ cep@@ hal@@ y : &quot; it gets better &quot;
&quot; like most 6 @-@ year @-@ old , Ed@@ mund Pic@@ ci@@ uto loves singing , toys and of course his mother . &quot;
&quot; but like the least of his people , Ed@@ mund Micro@@ cep@@ hal@@ ia , the result of a genetic disorder , about which his mother Elizabeth Pic@@ ci@@ uto didn &apos;t know anything during her pregnancy . &quot;
&quot; when he came home for the first time , my first thought was , I didn &apos;t manage it . &quot;
I don &apos;t create it .
I did not let it go .
&quot; what is not true at all -- of course , one has left it &quot; , &quot; she said . &quot;
your husband Vincent and her was told that Ed@@ mund may never recognize them under certain circumstances and that he may not even survive .
some doctors even went so far that they proposed to institution@@ alise him .
&quot; my first answer to it was &apos; I didn &apos;t know the people still do , &apos; explained Pic@@ ci@@ uto . &quot;
Ed@@ mund can walk with the help of a walk .
Ed@@ mund could neither sit nor craw@@ l up to his third year of life and he still cannot speak .
but he is making progress .
it can run with support and cycle .
he also loves to play and sing with his two brothers .
Elizabeth shows the drawing language that Ed@@ mund says for &quot; Please sing something in front of me . &quot;
&quot; we bring him symbolic language , &quot; &quot; told Pic@@ ci@@ uto C@@ BS News . &quot;
but it is not a typical character language -- says it . Ed@@ mund has invented some signs alone .
&quot; micro@@ cep@@ hal@@ y has a variety of causes : genetic such as Ed@@ mund , as well as infections with viruses such as meas@@ les or the c@@ ic@@ avi@@ rus during pregnancy . &quot;
the symptoms and forecasts can vary greatly .
it is still too early to tell how to influence the life of the Z@@ ik@@ avi@@ rus infected .
Pic@@ ci@@ uto is remin@@ is@@ cent of the emotional price of an uncer@@ tain future .
&quot; I always wonder@@ ed , what will happen ? &quot;
what will happen ?
and it still doesn &apos;t really know .
&quot; I have been asked for a long time after the pro@@ g@@ nosis , because I am not expecting that someone can really tell me . &quot;
but Pic@@ ci@@ uto has a hop@@ eful advice for mothers of inf@@ ants with birth defects caused by the c@@ ic@@ avi@@ rus .
it gets better .
you know it will be better for you .
you will love your child and your child will love you .
&quot; heavy ra@@ inf@@ alls , floo@@ ds give rise to b@@ ail@@ outs in Lou@@ is@@ iana , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi &quot;
heavy ra@@ inf@@ alls and large floo@@ ds in Lou@@ is@@ iana compelled the governor to call on Friday the emergency . it is expected all Saturday over with more ra@@ inf@@ alls .
&quot; numerous rivers in the southeast of Lou@@ is@@ i@@ anas and the south of the Miss@@ issi@@ pp@@ is floo@@ ded their banks and threatened with large floo@@ ds after extreme ra@@ inf@@ alls , the National Weather Service reported . &quot;
the governor of Lou@@ is@@ iana John B@@ el Ed@@ wards shared that state officials are in constant contact with the local authorities and are already on the road to help the affected communities .
&quot; Mike Ste@@ ele , a spokes@@ man for the Office of Hom@@ eland Security and Emergency Prepar@@ edness , shared the requests for high @-@ water vehicles , boats and sand bags . &quot;
Ste@@ ele said that alone the village of Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa had requested ten thousand sand sacks .
a flood warning system is used over wide parts in the south of Lou@@ is@@ i@@ anas up to Saturday .
the weather service could be no@@ isy that additional 3 to 5 inches could fall to rain in this area .
&quot; in the south of Al@@ ab@@ ama , a flood warning system was deployed on Friday , while it still ra@@ ined in the Mobile Area . &quot;
&quot; the river Com@@ ite near Bat@@ on Rou@@ ges and the river Am@@ ite near Den@@ ham Springs , which are both in Lou@@ is@@ iana , will likely reach record levels throughout the weekend . &quot;
the met@@ er@@ e@@ ologist Ale@@ k Kr@@ aut@@ mann says that both rivers could flood many houses in the localities near Bat@@ on Rouge .
&quot; he also said that a flow @-@ down@@ ward floo@@ ding in Ascension Par@@ ish is a danger , as these rivers flow only slowly into the Lake Mau@@ rep@@ as . &quot;
&quot; the river Tick@@ et@@ w , south of the Miss@@ issi@@ ppi national border in Liverpool , Lou@@ is@@ iana , reached the highest level on Friday at 0@@ 9.00 . &quot;
rescue teams still ski@@ pped people from floo@@ d@@ water in the districts of Am@@ ite and Wil@@ kin@@ son in the southwest of Miss@@ issi@@ ppi .
&quot; L@@ ero@@ y Hans@@ ford , his wife and his step@@ son were among those who were saved on Friday near Glo@@ ster . &quot;
&quot; Hans@@ ford , 62 , says that water by Be@@ aver Creek , which is normally more than 400 feet away from his house , rose by night strongly . &quot;
&quot; he said that another step@@ son , who lives nearby , had warned him . &quot;
&quot; we are awak@@ ened and the waters floo@@ ded and flo@@ cked in , &quot; &quot; said Hans@@ ford . &quot;
it reached my wa@@ ist .
&quot; his wife said Hans@@ ford that she lived in the 48 years , where she lived there , never saw such a flood of the river . &quot;
&quot; Hans@@ ford said that he and his family members had all the disabled , and he would be the only one who can swim . &quot;
&quot; Hans@@ ford said that emergency hel@@ pers had saved all three in a big military truck , and brought them to the next fire station in Glo@@ ster , where they were accommod@@ ated until Friday . &quot;
&quot; Kr@@ aut@@ mann said that &quot; &quot; floo@@ ding &quot; &quot; had quickly spread out , since there were still heavy ra@@ inf@@ alls and that the authorities were taking ev@@ ac@@ uation statements . &quot;
&quot; according to Kr@@ aut@@ mann , an observer arrives in the vicinity of Liv@@ ing@@ stone from midnight to Friday morning by 13,75 inch of rain . &quot;
Kr@@ aut@@ mann said that the soil has been significantly weigh@@ ed by the ra@@ inf@@ alls since Wednesday .
the authorities stated that heavy ra@@ inf@@ alls and road floo@@ ds caused the rescue of inhabitants from their homes in Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa Par@@ ish and teaching crew in five school districts .
the C@@ BS affiliate WW@@ L reported that a subsi@@ dy in Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa 200 floo@@ ded houses .
&quot; the inhabitants were ev@@ acu@@ ated in two churches , which now both were floo@@ ded . &quot;
&quot; the leader of Rob@@ by Miller , said that the authorities had saved 72 people and seven pets , which were flus@@ hed by the flood . &quot;
&quot; in the cities of Am@@ ite and Ham@@ mond , emergency shel@@ ters were set up to host the ev@@ ac@@ uation . &quot;
&quot; as soon as the water starts to go back , they will go back to their homes , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; in the town of Ham@@ mond of the village of Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa , almost two dozens of streets were closed due to high water and sand@@ bags for the inhabitants for taking part , hoping to keep the water out of their houses and stores . &quot;
&quot; the last great floo@@ ding we had was in March , &quot; said L@@ acy Land@@ rum from the city administration . &quot;
this seems to be a similar incident .
&quot; in Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , the Ru@@ pert L@@ acy of Har@@ rison Count@@ ys said that it was raining on the Gulf Coast . &quot;
&quot; according to his data , a hand@@ ful of houses on Thursday were reported as floo@@ ded , but not reported on Friday . &quot;
&quot; Keith Town@@ son , Manager at Shop@@ per Value F@@ oods in Am@@ ite , has lived in the area for 40 years . &quot;
&quot; I have seen water in places I have never seen before , &quot; &quot; said Town@@ son , &quot; &quot; and it still comes . &quot;
&quot; Mah@@ aj Brown , 6 &quot; &quot; holes perfor@@ ated &quot; , &quot; survi@@ ves shooting in Philadelphia &quot;
&quot; the police said that the 6 @-@ year @-@ old boy was shot in Philadelphia , this week the second time that a 6 @-@ year child is shot . &quot;
the grand@@ parents of the boy identified him for C@@ BS Philadelphia as Mah@@ aj Brown .
&quot; the grand@@ parents gave that brown suffered several shot injuries , including in the loin , leg , arm and belly , but that he was in the hospital at his transportation . &quot;
&quot; he has gone through much , his small body was en@@ forced by balls , &quot; he shared his grand@@ mother Del@@ ores Mel@@ ende@@ z to the transmitter . &quot;
I can &apos;t believe it .
the condition of the boy was classified as critical in a hospital and he had to undergo several sur@@ geri@@ es .
the boy &apos;s family shared the transmitter that he is expected to recover again .
he should have started the first class in a local primary school .
brown was one of four people who were shot in German@@ town .
&quot; also , three men were shot : two at the age of 29 and a 32 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;
one of the 29 @-@ year @-@ old men is in critical condition ; the other two victims are in stable condition according to C@@ BS Philadelphia .
&quot; the boy was found on the front seat of a car together with the 29 @-@ year @-@ old , who is in a critical condition , shot up , reports the transmitter . &quot;
the other two victims were not in the car and the police determine whether one of the injured men of the perpet@@ rators could be found .
investig@@ ators shared C@@ BS Philadelphia with that it seems to have come to a cross @-@ fire between several guns .
&quot; cartridge sleeves for assault ri@@ fl@@ es , which were trac@@ ed back to various storm resist@@ ors , se@@ wn the crime scene . &quot;
it seems that this is clearly a constant struggle .
&quot; on the road , on both sides of the walk@@ way , sleeves were found . &quot;
&quot; so it seems to have given several armed fighters who were very active , &quot; &quot; shared police @-@ p@@ man Anthony G@@ inal@@ di of the police in Philadelphia to the radio station . &quot;
there were also several houses and vehicles in the area .
there was no arrest and the police are currently checking reports according to the surveillance video .
&quot; on Tuesday , another 6 @-@ year @-@ old girl was hit by a cross @-@ sleep@@ er on the arm when she played in front of her house in the residential area of the West Oak Lane . &quot;
she reco@@ vers and the police are still looking for a susp@@ ect .
&quot; why we need Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie &quot;
this is what I imagine under the women &apos;s Olympic Games in the gymn@@ as@@ tics and that is more than one reason .
&quot; first of all , I have been at every summer Olympics since 1984 and the US has never been so dominant . &quot;
&quot; second , this team has three gymn@@ asts , Simone Bil@@ es , Gab@@ by Douglas and Lau@@ ren &quot; Lau@@ rie &quot; Her@@ nan@@ dez , who inspired many young girls from other skin colour . &quot;
&quot; the structure of this team , the A@@ ly R@@ ais@@ man , the Jü@@ din is and Ma@@ di@@ son Ko@@ cian , the Cath@@ o@@ lic@@ ist , rounds off , makes everyone proud . &quot;
this team is finally reflected in the US .
it has strengthened the black and his@@ panic female presence at the top of this sport .
&quot; in the last four years , the number one among the female gymn@@ asts was an A@@ fr@@ o @-@ American woman . &quot;
last year Simone and Gab@@ by # 1 and # 2 were .
this shows strength .
&quot; during the last Olympic Games , Gab@@ by Douglas was a surprise Olympic champion and America che@@ ered . &quot;
&quot; now the world was able to witness the incredible achievement of the triple world champ@@ ionships of Simone Bil@@ es , Douglas and Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , as they were unexpected , but master@@ ful Gy@@ mas@@ tics routines . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday Simone was the fourth , h@@ eter@@ os@@ exual Americans who won gold at an individual multi @-@ campaign event for women . &quot;
team member A@@ ly R@@ ais@@ man won silver .
&quot; we experience the peak of this sport , but as gymn@@ astic classes do not see in the whole country . &quot;
&quot; Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie all beat the same way as A@@ ly and Ma@@ di@@ son to create it to the Olympic team . &quot;
&quot; they are the &quot; Last Five , &quot; because the next Olympic team will only have four gymn@@ asts in the team . furthermore , this is the last year with Mart@@ a Kar@@ oly@@ i as trainer . &quot;
&quot; but the reality looks so that Tur@@ ns are a more expensive sport and gymn@@ asts are primarily in private gy@@ ms that are maintained by parents , which arise for training , training , travel and hotel costs ( for the trainers and their gymn@@ asts and families ) . &quot;
the majority of these gymn@@ as@@ tics are in wealthy suburbs that can support the business .
&quot; in these associations , the gymn@@ asts receive their entire training and that is for families a te@@ ures and long @-@ term commitment . &quot;
&quot; A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ man , trainer of Simone Bil@@ es , and Mag@@ gie Han@@ ey , trainer of Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , both trained their athletes since they started exercising . &quot;
&quot; we have to au@@ n the municipalities , inn@@ umer@@ able young girls who are inspired by Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie , an affordable and easy @-@ to @-@ reach gymn@@ asi@@ um training . &quot;
I founded my gymn@@ as@@ um of 20 years .
&quot; at my events , we have offered free and affordable tur@@ nes in Harlem for more than 15@@ ,000 urban te@@ ens ( mainly black and His@@ panic ) and trained national and international vic@@ tors . &quot;
&quot; in September , we will expand to Detroit ( my home town ) to offer young high @-@ quality gymn@@ as@@ tics that deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sports art . &quot;
&quot; gymn@@ asts develop strength , flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work , discipline and determination for the mind . &quot;
this combination offers life @-@ long benefits for health as well as for academic and professional success .
it is the inspiration of this team who will bring thousands of young girls to be interested in gymn@@ as@@ tics and that &apos;s great .
&quot; it is so important to participate in sports , especially for girls . &quot;
this is an exciting time .
&quot; thanks Simone , A@@ ly , Lau@@ rie , Gab@@ by and Ma@@ di@@ son for this real representation of &quot; Girl Power &quot; through the hol@@ en of the Olympic team gol@@ ds and thank you , you are motivated so many young girls with different backgrounds to start their way , healthy , strong and successful young women . &quot;
assist@@ ants would like to organize more strikes after they rejected Jerem@@ y Hun@@ ts &apos;s proposal
&quot; the ministers were hoping to end the dispute over the changes by adop@@ ting a re@@ formed treaty with the function@@ aries of the British Medical Association , but 58 percent of the 37@@ ,000 assist@@ ants who voted on a vote rejected him . &quot;
&quot; in July H@@ unt plans to introduce plans to introduce the treaty , and said that the N@@ HS had found itself in a &quot; &quot; Ni@@ em@@ and@@ s@@ land &quot; &quot; and any further delay for employees and patients would be harmful . &quot;
&quot; the first assistance specialists will receive a new contract , which contains changes to night and weekend work to improve the maintenance of the clock times . &quot;
&quot; DR Ellen Mc@@ Court , the chair@@ person of the B@@ MA Committee for Assistance , announced last night in a communication with : &quot; &quot; assistance specialists agreed to the proposed Treaty like serious concerns , in particular that it will stimulate the current staff crisis and it will be treated to satisfy all physicians . &quot;
&quot; only eight weeks remaining until the first group of doctors fall under the new contract , progress must be made and the time runs out . &quot;
efforts on the part of the B@@ MA to resolve disputes by talking with the government to participate in opposition and sometimes de@@ af@@ ening silence .
&quot; it happened that of a promise that Jerem@@ y H@@ unt had made it last month , that his door would always be off@@ ended . &quot;
Jerem@@ y H@@ unt must act now to raise the condition and address the concerns of the assist@@ ants .
&quot; if he did not do this , the assist@@ ants made it clear that they are ready to carry out further labor @-@ fighting measures . &quot;
&quot; the last strike at the end of April saw a boost of nearly 13@@ ,000 routine operations and 100,000 appointments , as nur@@ ses and specialists were included to provide doctors on the Strei@@ k@@ post@@ enk@@ etten coverage . &quot;
the ministers were hoping to end the dispute over the amendments by adop@@ ting the Re@@ formed Treaty with the function@@ aries of the British Medical Association .
&quot; the B@@ MA wants a better weekly remun@@ eration for the 54@@ .000 assist@@ ants , which are subject to the contract . &quot;
&quot; Daniel Mor@@ timer , Director General of the N@@ HS staff , called for the assistance specialists to stop the strike . &quot;
&quot; Mor@@ timer said : &quot; &quot; working fight measures do not reach only little , but strain already over@@ loaded teams and service providers and prepare patients , nur@@ ses and their families only wor@@ ries , distress and inter@@ ruption . &quot;
&quot; in the last two months , we talked to the committee of assist@@ ants , and with the Ministry of Health and other mini@@ stries had a positive response to the concerns about the guar@@ di@@ an@@ ship and wh@@ ist@@ leb@@ low@@ ings . &quot;
&quot; employers hoped that the continued positive commitment to other important issues - such as des@@ patch , flexibility in training , training courses , mutual recognition of the cur@@ riculum , training courses , mutual recognition of the cur@@ riculum , training courses , mutual recognition of the cur@@ riculum , health education England and the Ministry of Health in respect of compliance with the B@@ MA in November , February and May . &quot;
the £ 2 @-@ per day medication that can reduce heart attack risk
thousands of cardi@@ ac patients will benefit from a £ 2 @-@ a day drug after advised by the authorities to admini@@ ster this more people for a longer period of time .
the domestic medication Tic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or reduces the risk of repeated heart attacks for persons with a heart disease .
&quot; the medication is administered for 12 months after a heart attack , thereby reducing the risk of stroke or another heart attack . &quot;
the N@@ HS regulatory authority has recommended for a period of four years to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
the N@@ HS regulatory authority has recommended for a period of four years to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
&quot; around 14@@ 0,000 people suffer a heart attack every year and a quarter of it suffer from a further heart attack or stroke . &quot;
heart attacks and stro@@ kes are caused by accumulation of fatty material in the ar@@ tery walls .
&quot; when the surface breaks apart , it can cause a blood cl@@ ots that c@@ log the flow of blood to the heart , causing a heart attack . &quot;
&quot; if the blood cl@@ ots dis@@ solve , it can flow through the blood stream and c@@ log the blood flow to the brain , causing a stroke . &quot;
people who already had a heart attack are subject to a higher risk to have another .
&quot; Tic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , produced by the British company A@@ stra@@ Zen@@ eca and under the trade name of Bri@@ li@@ que , reduces that risk by making the formation of blood cl@@ ots more prob@@ able . &quot;
&quot; the draft of N@@ ICE , which was published today , recommends a 12 @-@ month intake of 90@@ mg Tic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , followed by 60@@ mg with one twice daily intake of aspir@@ in for the next three years . &quot;
&quot; Professor Car@@ ole Long@@ son , Director of the N@@ ICE Health Centre Evaluation Centre said : &quot; despite the availability of secondary prevention , a quarter of all people who suffered a heart attack , have a further heart attack or stroke - often with dis@@ astro@@ us consequences . &quot;
the fear of a renewed heart attack may have considerable negative effects on the quality of life of a person .
experience shows that Tic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or in combination with aspir@@ in is effective in reducing other heart attacks and stro@@ kes in people who already had a heart attack .
&quot; by preliminary recommendation of Tic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , we are pleased that we are able to extend available treatment options to thousands of people who can benefit from it . &quot;
the information on the efficacy and safety of Tic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or - especially the risk of blood - is limited to a period of up to three years . the draft bill does not recommend treatment that goes beyond this period of time .
culture of Political Cor@@ rect@@ ness lets election fraud blo@@ om in Muslim areas
former Mayor of Tower Ham@@ lets Lut@@ on Rah@@ man was removed last year due to corruption from office
a culture of political cor@@ rect@@ ness has led to the fact that widespread voting in Muslim communities is unknow@@ ingly ignored as a devast@@ ating government report today .
&quot; the former cabinet of cabinet Sir Eric Pic@@ kl@@ es att@@ ests to verb@@ ally the police , election ob@@ servers and city counc@@ ils to ignore evidence of poll@@ ing mis@@ use due to &quot; &quot; hyper@@ sensitivity to eth@@ no and religion &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the former minister of integration and communal government , who is now a re@@ incar@@ nation , said that the inti@@ mid@@ ation of vot@@ ers from religious motives would be so bad that the police should be allowed to set off barriers outside of elec@@ toral cabinet to protect inti@@ mid@@ ated vot@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; he recommends that vot@@ ers should lead a passport , in order to prove their identity in the elections . &quot;
&quot; at the moment , a vot@@ er must simply call his name and address . &quot;
the report proposes not to apply removable inks to the finger of a person when they give up their vote to prevent someone cho@@ oses twice .
&quot; wh@@ ist@@ leb@@ lower should get more protection , says Sir Eric . &quot;
it demands that the press should have more access to municipal documents and decisions by non @-@ official committees or working groups .
&quot; this is not only aimed at elec@@ toral fraud , but also to protect the communal government from the broader corruption and financial crisis culture that is associated with it , &quot; he said . &quot;
the report was arranged by Down@@ ing Street as a result of Tower Ham@@ lets Wahl@@ sk@@ and@@ als in the east of London .
&quot; last year , a Special Court ruled that the acting mayor Lut@@ on Rah@@ man should be exposed to corrupt and illegal practices of his ministry . &quot;
the Court found that Rah@@ man had per@@ ver@@ ted the religious feelings of his Muslim community &quot; in a cy@@ ni@@ cal way &quot; and that he had brought his critics to silence with rac@@ ist and Islam@@ opho@@ bic accus@@ ations .
&quot; Rah@@ man is said to have led &quot; &quot; his campaign on the basis that it is the relig@@ ous duty of Muslims to choose him . &quot;
up to 300 voices were either dou@@ bt@@ ful or the result of a im@@ itation in which one person cho@@ oses as someone else .
Sir Eric said that there was evidence of fraud throughout the country .
&quot; in particular , he expressed himself al@@ ar@@ ming for frau@@ dul@@ ent brief@@ ing - in the older members of the Muslim community pressure on people to choose a candidate of their choice . &quot;
&quot; Sir Eric , pic@@ tured , made several recommendations to clean the elec@@ toral system , including guiding principles to prove the identity &quot;
&quot; in his report it is said : &quot; &quot; as proof , pressure on vulnerable members of some ethnic minorities has been exercised , especially women and young people , in order to choose according to the will of the elderly , in particular communities with a Pak@@ ist@@ an@@ ian or Banglad@@ es@@ ian background . &quot;
&quot; there were concerns that ... state institutions would have unknow@@ ingly ignored such behaviour on the basis of &quot; politically correct &quot; hyper@@ sensitivity to eth@@ no and religion . &quot;
&quot; Sir Eric spoke 50 recommendations to clean up the system , including the prohibition that political activists are editing letter mail@@ ings to stop &quot; elec@@ toral issues . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the report , which is taken into consideration by Ther@@ esa May , also requires tough@@ er registration checks to prevent the elec@@ toral directory used for immigration and social fraud . &quot;
consider options to ask vot@@ ers before choosing your ID .
do not use removable inks on the finger of a person as soon as they have released their voice to prevent someone cho@@ oses twice .
systematic review of the nation@@ ality of a person to make sure they are eligible .
a three @-@ year limitation on applications to an automatic letter .
prohibition that political activists edit complete let@@ ter@@ ings and envel@@ opes of letter sel@@ ections .
&quot; the police enter the authority , shut @-@ off for election stations . &quot;
a amend@@ ment that made an indictment for inti@@ mid@@ ation in accordance with the Repres@@ entation of the People Act 1983 ( Public Repres@@ entation Act 1983 ) .
photographer prohibition in elec@@ toral units .
requirement that only English can be used in the election stations ( except Wales ) .
intensi@@ fication of the training to ensure that the employees usually en@@ force that vot@@ ers alone go into the elec@@ toral cabinet .
Sir Eric falls on the Metropolitan Police and finds it &quot; amazing &quot; that after the Tower Ham@@ lets case there was no penalty .
&quot; the election court has said Lut@@ on Rah@@ man and his dep@@ uty for a lit@@ any of corrupt and illegal practices , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; due to a number of reasons , he was found guilty on a number of reasons - according to the high demands in criminal proceedings . &quot;
he also critic@@ ises the in@@ effective &quot; shut@@ down controls &quot; of the constitu@@ ent regi@@ stran@@ ts of the town hall houses .
Sir Eric said : &quot; the Court of Justice in Tower Ham@@ lets of last year was a warning signal .
&quot; our country bears a proud heritage as the Mother of the Par@@ liam@@ ents , but the wor@@ rying and conce@@ aled spread of elec@@ toral fraud and den@@ ial of some authorities thre@@ aten this good reputation . &quot;
crazy to K@@ ates Rad@@ ler @-@ Doppel@@ gän@@ ger and other famous Doppel@@ gän@@ ger from Olympic Games in Rio
fans of the 2016 Olympics in Rio this week are advised about the French cycling race Pau@@ line Ferr@@ and @-@ Pre@@ v@@ ot except the edge and band which proved to be an impressive double @-@ tran@@ che of the Duke of Cambridge .
but the 24 @-@ year @-@ old Olymp@@ ion@@ ik@@ in is by far not the only one to have gold fighting ath@@ l@@ ete who has its own famous Doppel@@ gän@@ ger - at least not if one is allowed to believe the social media .
&quot; in honor of the Olympic Games in Rio and all the famous faces fli@@ ck@@ ering over time on our screens , F@@ email has created a list of Olymp@@ ians that show more than just a certain simil@@ arity with Hollywood &apos;s celeb@@ ri@@ ties . &quot;
&quot; the hunter and the wolf : team member of the US team in the Archery Bra@@ dy El@@ l@@ ison , left , is compared with Leonardo Di@@ Cap@@ rio since childhood . &quot;
&quot; apart from K@@ ates Doppel@@ gän@@ ger on the bike race , many people on the internet pointed out how a certain ar@@ cher of the twin of A @-@ Pro@@ mi Leonardo Di@@ Cap@@ rio could be . &quot;
&quot; the team member of the US team in Archery Bra@@ dy El@@ l@@ ison has caused a rush to Twitter after pictures , on which he sees the wolf of Wall Street Star in@@ si@@ bly similar . &quot;
&quot; in fact , the ar@@ cher got the mad@@ ness in the social media with and gave it to hear that he has been hearing from his childhood that he looks like Leo . &quot;
&quot; I myself don &apos;t see a big simil@@ arity , except for facial hair , &quot; Bra@@ dy shared the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post . &quot;
&quot; he is a ben@@ evol@@ ent guy , so I wrote it as a compli@@ ment . &quot;
one of the most popular compar@@ isons since London 2012 will undoubtedly be the focus of this year : the outstanding simil@@ arity between the British far @-@ jum@@ pers Gre@@ g Ru@@ ther@@ ford and the popular actor N@@ eil Patrick Har@@ ris .
&quot; the Russian Tur@@ ner@@ in Ali@@ ya Must@@ af@@ ina with her big , expressive eyes is supposed to pass through as a Doppel@@ gän@@ ger for the Cu@@ ban @-@ American singer Gl@@ oria Est@@ ef@@ an . &quot;
&quot; and in the swimming pool , the South African Schwi@@ mmer Cameron van der Bur@@ gh has been compared with G@@ lee Star Matthew Mor@@ rison for years . &quot;
&quot; one course higher : this user believes that Nathan is the &quot; &quot; athle@@ tic version &quot; &quot; of the In@@ ception actor . &quot;
another continued comparison was drawn between the tennis star Rafael Nad@@ al and actor Jos@@ h Hart@@ nett who has similar severe eyeb@@ rows and lips .
&quot; the Russian silver med@@ alli@@ sts in Y@@ uli@@ a E@@ f@@ im@@ ova exhibit more than just the sun @-@ t@@ anned skin and blond hair like act@@ ress Ann@@ aly@@ n@@ ne Mc@@ C@@ ord , while the American Nathan was att@@ un@@ ed to fans of an &quot; athle@@ tic version of Joseph Gordon Lev@@ itt . &quot; &quot;
&quot; strong women : football star Hope Solo , left , and D@@ ex@@ ter act@@ ress Jennifer Car@@ p@@ enter , right , have a similar face form and eyes &quot;
not the only one : a Twitter user was very happy that others liked the simil@@ arities
theory into space : according to this user there is perhaps a reason for the simil@@ arity of the couple .
a Twitter user declared their satisfaction that &quot; the rest of the internet thinks that Hope Solo and Jennifer Car@@ p@@ enter are almost identical .
&quot; in fact , the U.S. football star Hope Solo and the D@@ ex@@ ter act@@ ress Jennifer Car@@ p@@ enter have an incredibly similar face and eyes . &quot;
&quot; other popular compar@@ isons included K@@ err@@ i Wal@@ sh @-@ J@@ enn@@ ings and her smile , which is almost identical to that of act@@ ress Laura Lin@@ ney , as well as the gold med@@ alli@@ sts in the Tur@@ ns Gab@@ by Douglas that resem@@ bles her own beautiful , broad smile that resem@@ bles the Br@@ ing It On Star Gabri@@ elle Union . &quot;

&quot; Canadian broad@@ c@@ aster C@@ BC had to ap@@ ologi@@ ze after one of his comment@@ ators said that the 14 @-@ year @-@ old Chinese s@@ wimm@@ ers &quot; &quot; how M@@ ief fell off &quot; &quot; and during the race as &quot; a pig died . &quot; &quot;

&quot; Mac@@ Donald who was brought to the comment@@ ator team of the C@@ BS on board to give more &quot; colour &quot; could be heard : &quot; this little 14 @-@ year @-@ old Chinese has lost the connection , baby . &quot;
&quot; too excited , went as M@@ ief , died like a pig . &quot;
thanks for this .
&quot; the Chinese s@@ wimm@@ ers in Ai Yan@@ han , 14 , sw@@ am the second stage of the swimming staff@@ el 1 : 5@@ 7,@@ 79 - 1,@@ 61 seconds slower than Canada &apos;s Taylor Ru@@ ck , which allowed the Canadian to un@@ lock the gap to China . &quot;
spectators across Canada quickly re@@ acted online after they were shock@@ ed by the sound and the language
&quot; Emma Mac@@ far@@ lane twe@@ ete , &quot; Do@@ es the C@@ BC comment@@ ator just said that the 14 @-@ year @-@ old float from China &quot; like a pig died &quot; ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?
the idi@@ ot did not get that they were still on stream .
&quot; Ai Yan@@ han from China was described as follows : &quot; this little 14 @-@ year @-@ old Chinese has lost the connection , baby . &quot;
the criticism against B@@ yr@@ on Mac@@ Donald on Twitter came fast and hard with which many asked him for speech .
Twitter users didn &apos;t stay back when they heard how un@@ sensitive B@@ yr@@ on Mac@@ Donald was
&quot; another Twitter user in Sarah Paradi@@ s wrote : &quot; wow , # By@@ ron@@ Mac@@ Donald . &quot;
you just represent the C@@ BC and Canada and lets us look like rac@@ si@@ sts . # ange@@ ek@@ elt .
&quot; shortly afterwards Scott Russ@@ el , who moder@@ ated the C@@ BC broadcast live for the comment of Mac@@ Donald and said : &quot; &quot; we ap@@ ologi@@ ze for the comment on a swimming performance was broadcast . &quot;
&quot; it was an un@@ fortunate wording , we are sorry that it happened . &quot;
&quot; sorry , this entry is only available in Deutsch . &quot;
the author &apos;s colleague Scott Russ@@ el had to ap@@ ologi@@ ze for Mac@@ Donald &apos;s name
C@@ BC copied and added his exc@@ use to more than 90 other Twitter users who had compl@@ ained about the comments made by Mac@@ Donald
the network also ap@@ ologi@@ zed quickly and gave a message .
we regret that these statements were made and that it was made possible that it was broadcast .
&quot; yesterday night , we ap@@ ologi@@ zed to our audience on the show and our fol@@ lo@@ wer@@ n in social media . &quot;
&quot; to clarify one , B@@ yr@@ on &apos;s comments refer to the performance of the float in and not on them as a person . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , they were in@@ appropriate and an un@@ fortunate wording . B@@ yr@@ on does what he said , very sorry . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday afternoon , Mac@@ Donald ap@@ ologi@@ zed in the show and tried to justify his re@@ mark by saying that it was not his intention that it was designed as a personal attack . &quot;
&quot; I would like to take a moment to ap@@ ologi@@ ze for the comment I made after the women &apos;s s@@ quad@@ ron in the C@@ BC Olympics , he said . &quot;
&quot; I have been referring to the performance of the float , and not to them as a person . &quot;
&quot; of course , no cont@@ emp@@ t was intended and I &apos;m sorry . &quot;
buyers in Pri@@ mark stamp on women who ta@@ sted in the midst of the shop under@@ wear under@@ wear
&quot; the buyers did not know where to see , when a woman went out to try their clothes in the middle of a pri@@ mar@@ row to try under@@ pants . &quot;
&quot; to wor@@ sen the situation , she mu@@ stered as she saw in it , pulled it out and put it back into the shelf . &quot;
&quot; you stum@@ bled on and rehear@@ sed four pairs of lower pants in a shop at Bou@@ ver@@ ie Place shopping m@@ all in Folk@@ estone , on . &quot;
&quot; the Pri@@ mark shop at the Bou@@ ver@@ ie Place shopping m@@ all in Folk@@ estone , where the woman ta@@ sted the lower pants before she put her back into the shelf &quot;
&quot; a mother of two children , J@@ enny Davi@@ dson , who was in the store at the same time , said that after the mysterious woman had tried under@@ wear , she went off and left the shop without buying anything . &quot;
she said : &quot; people could not believe what they saw .
&quot; standing in the middle of the show@@ room , she took a pair of lower pants from the lining , pulled out their own ti@@ ghts and pants and tried them . &quot;
&quot; she did not even try to find a somewhat discre@@ et place to do it - she just stood there , che@@ ek@@ y like O@@ sk@@ ar . &quot;
&quot; everyone star@@ ed when they pulled out the lower pants that you obviously didn &apos;t like , as they put them back into the shelf . &quot;
&quot; she repeated the same with three other sig@@ natures , before finally decided that her was not pleased to fall back and out again . &quot;
&quot; she didn &apos;t seem to be bot@@ her@@ ed by someone watching - or thinking about the person , who under certain circumstances would buy the un@@ pants she had tried . &quot;
&quot; Ms. Davi@@ dson , 33 who lives in K@@ ent , said : &quot; &quot; how to think that someone would take home pants with home , who had a different person and who were not washed . &quot;
the incident happened on Tuesday afternoon .
&quot; Mrs. Davi@@ dson added : &quot; as I got along , the employees tried to pull out clothing from selling after they went - what is just as good . &quot;
I would hate to go home with a new couple of under@@ pants to go home and find out that another woman had her and went out and did not get washed .
&quot; Pri@@ mark spokes@@ man said , &quot; Pri@@ mark is aware of the incident that occurred on Tuesday 9 August at our branch in Folk@@ stone . &quot;
all products in question have been pulled out of sale .
how to protect oneself with Kra@@ v Mag@@ a against weapons attacks
&quot; the world outside is a dangerous place , but this video from Daily@@ Mail could make it a bit safer for you . &quot;
&quot; we talked with Rh@@ on Miz@@ ra@@ chi , a Grand Master of Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Union in New York to find out how to deal with armed rob@@ bers at close distance . &quot;
&quot; regardless of whether you &apos;re approaching from the front or from behind , this video will show you how to spin the sk@@ ewer for your pre@@ dat@@ or . &quot;
&quot; if one approaches you from behind , then you should turn around as first , so that you can see your att@@ acker and &quot; go out of the shot &quot; , &quot; says Miz@@ ra@@ chi . &quot;
grab the weapon between your for@@ ear@@ m and your shoulder before you face it with your free el@@ bow .
&quot; beat him with the knees in the sli@@ ghtest and twist , while the att@@ acker comes together against pain , the weapon of his hands . beat him with the run into the face and move back@@ wards , while they set the weapon on it . &quot;
&quot; when att@@ ackers , approaching from the front , the technique is similar - move your body from the shot line , grab the weapon and rotate it so that the att@@ acker cannot shoot . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , store the weight on the weapon and hit the att@@ acker on the chest , then turn the weapon out of its grip before moving back@@ wards and set the weapon on it . &quot;
sounds difficult ?
watch the video to see exactly how it pre@@ fers Miz@@ ra@@ chi .
&quot; but remember that in a rob@@ ber@@ y , it is saf@@ est to submit your money - if you are not a Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Grand Master . &quot;

&quot; but the experiment , which was fil@@ med under the title &quot; The L@@ ick@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength , &quot; brought some surprising results to daylight . &quot;
&quot; the thought of removing the r@@ ins@@ ing button of a tensi@@ le toilet , which has been used by thousands of others may be totally dismis@@ sive , but in fact , there are more bad bacteria in a kitchen sink . &quot;
&quot; on his journey through Europe , Mr. W@@ right spoke with doctors and medical professionals to promote intestinal bacteria and their own health . &quot;
&quot; fortunately nothing left what he ta@@ sted , more than a bad after@@ taste in the mouth . &quot;
&quot; Mr. W@@ right became known to test the resili@@ ence of his bow@@ el , by travelling through the world and ate peculiar and wonderful things . &quot;
&quot; from public money to train stations to r@@ ins@@ ing kno@@ bs of toilets , the task set its immune system definitely below a sample &quot;
&quot; he told him : &quot; &quot; as a child I was relatively un@@ concerned about my health and I put all kinds of things in my mouth , earth , wor@@ ms and mud water . &quot;
&quot; in the film , he was able to do justice to his reputation . &quot;
the only thing he refused was a dirty public toilet in Russia .
its sample line showed a lumin@@ ometric number of over 4000 units .
&quot; compared to this , the L@@ umin@@ omet@@ ry value amounts to less than 60 . &quot;
&quot; but there was a Russian toilet , which he refused to den@@ ounce after their lumin@@ ometric pressure was over 4000 units , whereas freshly washed hands were one of less than 60 &quot;
Mr. W@@ right and the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products vali@@ o produced the travel film &quot; The L@@ ick@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength &quot; showing the bacterial count at different places like the bathroom
&quot; in the film , he says : &quot; &quot; that comes to the worst thing I have done in a toilet , close . &quot;
there is nothing more dirty than that !
I will not lick here because it is disgu@@ sting here .
&quot; the L@@ ick@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength &quot; was produced in collaboration with the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products vali@@ o .
&quot; the company equi@@ ps Mr. W@@ right with Vali@@ o Gef@@ il@@ us , which contains both lac@@ tic acid bacteria and vitamin C and D to support intestinal bacteria and immune system . &quot;
&quot; vali@@ os Senior Vice President for Snacks , Sh@@ anks and New Categories Nik@@ o Vu@@ or@@ en@@ ma@@ a says : &quot; we wanted to offer consumers something new . &quot;
something that is fascinating to look at and at the same time explains the advantages of pro@@ biotics .
&quot; we performed crazy bra@@ inst@@ or@@ m@@ ings that ended up saying &quot; &quot; Let us call us Ian . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they claim that the interest in intestinal health becomes a global phenomenon
&quot; instead of talking about the products we wanted to put them into a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment , the importance of gut health and how they are linked to the immune system . &quot;
the growing interest in intestinal health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we could provide consumers with more information in an interesting way .
I also think the film shows that we have a great sense of hum@@ our !
&quot; Tom Hak@@ ala , who directed the film direc@@ ting , added : &quot; &quot; let me tell me so - I would have lost my respect for Ian , if he had ta@@ sted some of the things I have instruc@@ ted him , just like the disgu@@ sting Russian toilet that is shown in the film . &quot;
&quot; of course , there were things in which it was easier to put Ian to blame them , and others in which this was quite difficult . &quot;
I &apos;m glad we recorded some of these dirty goo@@ dies on film .
&quot; in a survey conducted by Vali@@ o in 2015 , 84 percent of all surv@@ ey@@ ed lac@@ tic acid bacteria associated with the well @-@ being of stomach and intest@@ ine and 58 percent said they have at least occasionally used products containing the attached lac@@ tic acid bacteria . &quot;
&quot; A@@ social family destro@@ ys social housing in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall &quot;
&quot; an as@@ o@@ zi@@ ale family left their social housing after a dele@@ tion of £ 50,000 , because they had terr@@ orized their neighb@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; T@@ anya Skel@@ don and her partner Sh@@ au@@ n Tre@@ bil@@ cock were thrown after a long list of complaints from their property in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall . &quot;
&quot; after being rap@@ ed from their property , shock@@ ed employees of the housing association found their property in an ir@@ repar@@ able condition . &quot;
&quot; the walls showed small holes , wood panels were ri@@ pped , rub@@ b@@ ish was scattered on the floor and gra@@ ff@@ iti was lubric@@ ated to the walls . &quot;
the family has been res@@ ett@@ led and it is believed that she is now living in private accommodation
&quot; Don@@ na Mc@@ Ev@@ oy , who works for home administration at Corn@@ wall Housing , said they feared that the apartment was no longer repaired . &quot;
she said : &quot; it was an absolute night@@ mare for the people here and I think people don &apos;t have to live in this way .
&quot; there are many things to consider , since this property will probably be considered as not as beautiful part of Corn@@ wall . &quot;
the family is not@@ orious and their reputation is also .
&quot; the couple had three sons who lived in the apartment in the meantime and the police said that the terror that had inf@@ lic@@ ted the family has included street fights with bas@@ eb@@ all@@ ets , inti@@ mid@@ ations , drug abuse , drug traff@@ icking , and excessive cri@@ es , stri@@ kers and flu@@ kes . &quot;
&quot; Skel@@ don , 47 whose name was on the lease , got an arrangement for anti @-@ social behaviour in June . &quot;
&quot; in some rooms of the house , which will be dem@@ ol@@ ished under certain circumstances , old g@@ arb@@ age was found &quot;
&quot; in the estate in which drugs were tra@@ ded in the past , the wooden plan@@ ks were ri@@ pped &quot;
neighbours said that they saw them fighting on the streets and regularly inv@@ oked the police
Corn@@ wall Housing del@@ og@@ ated her and her partner this week for@@ ci@@ bly by the property after giving them an extended period of 11 weeks to voluntarily surrender .
del@@ og@@ ation were che@@ ered by ligh@@ tened neighbours who said that their life was made to hell .
&quot; one said , &quot; They were shock@@ ed by no one . &quot; &quot;
we lived for 20 years beside them and it was always bad .
the inn@@ umer@@ able times we say the police here are incredible .
&quot; today , we could not sleep . &quot;
we stood up because it was so quiet here - we are not acc@@ u@@ stom@@ ed !
&quot; now , where they are finally gone , it will be nice . &quot;
&quot; Adam F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck , N@@ eigh@@ bour@@ hood En@@ forcement Manager of Corn@@ wall Housing , said that it had the family to cooperate with the local authorities . &quot;
&quot; the family lived in the house where the police were sum@@ mon@@ ed at regular intervals , 20 years &quot;
&quot; on the over@@ grown side of the Municipal House , rub@@ b@@ ish and old toys were thrown down &quot;
&quot; he added : &quot; &quot; it is a shame that there is the ten@@ ant to accept any responsibility for their behaviour and their family , as a del@@ usion is always the last step of taking into account Corn@@ wall Housing . &quot;
&quot; this was a very difficult case , because the behavior was extreme and their actions for their neighb@@ ors had to be aw@@ ful . &quot;
&quot; I appreciate all the work that my team , the police of De@@ von and Corn@@ wall , as well as members of the church who have cour@@ age@@ ously walked to us and gave us the information . &quot;
&quot; I hope this development will don@@ ate some of its neighb@@ ors , and the message convey@@ s that anti @-@ social behaviour is not toler@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck said that all three sons had lived in the house at different times , but that they were all over 20 . &quot;
a dirty mattress left behind in one of the bedrooms of the house after del@@ og@@ ation on the ground
the workers of the home administration will now have to clean up g@@ arb@@ age mountains that surround the house
&quot; in 2014 , the police conducted a raid in the house and found about 70@@ g of cannabis as well as scales , par@@ ap@@ ia and cash in the amount of £ 1,@@ 700 . &quot;
Skel@@ don received a fine sentence after she found herself guilty of the owner of a class B drug .
she claimed that the money was for a tom@@ b@@ stone of her son Lee Skel@@ don who died in 2013 in a car accident .
&quot; after being without shelter , it is assumed that T@@ anya and her partner are now living in a private accommodation in Pl@@ y@@ mouth . &quot;
many room walls of the house were lab@@ elled with gra@@ ff@@ iti .
&quot; the police says that they will del@@ og@@ ate r@@ enters , who do not stick to the house rules &quot;
Angela C@@ row from the police of De@@ von and Corn@@ wall told that del@@ og@@ ation was a clear warning to the other ten@@ ants who do not obey house rules .
&quot; this goes to those who think they can behave without self @-@ repro@@ ach , as well as those who were damaged by such a behavior , &quot; she said . &quot;
De@@ von and Corn@@ wall police will never toler@@ ate criminal and anti @-@ social behaviour that will continue to work with partners to protect our communities .
tourists in Portugal disp@@ at@@ ched in panic after a typ@@ ing military jet flies
&quot; sun beds in Av@@ eiro , Portugal experienced the shock of their lives &quot;
an portu@@ g@@ is@@ i@@ es@@ ches P @-@ 3@@ C Ori@@ on aircraft of the air forces put an unbelievable blow flight
&quot; the air@@ strikes indicated that it was on a training flight , but insist@@ ed that there was no security risk . &quot;
&quot; this was the moment when the frigh@@ tened tourists begin to get into panic , after a typ@@ ing jet crashes over a full beach . &quot;
dramatic video recordings showed how the military aircraft flew almost close to the sun an@@ em@@ ers on the beach section in Av@@ eiro in northern Portugal .
&quot; the vac@@ ation@@ ers pointed out when they understand@@ ably began to worry about the noise of the D@@ üs@@ enting Works , without seeing what came through the clouds to them . &quot;
&quot; the incident happened yesterday afternoon in Costa Nova , near Av@@ eiro . &quot;
&quot; Daniel Fern@@ andes , one of the many tourists who posted videos about the dramatic Fly @-@ By in social media , said : &quot; &quot; it flew twice really deep and there was a moment when it looked like it would crash . &quot;
&quot; N@@ un@@ o Ar@@ ro@@ ja added : &quot; &quot; I was just surfing and it felt like the plane dropped onto me . &quot;
tourists at the beach of Av@@ eiro were translated into panic when the plane came out of the darkness and flew incredibly low
the Portuguese air@@ strikes today announced that the pilot of the P @-@ 3@@ C Ori@@ on aircraft was on a training flight to identify fishing boats in front of the coast and had to fly so deeply that this was the only way to recognize them .
&quot; the spokes@@ man said that the jet had a bit deeper than usual due to bad visibility , but the air@@ strikes persist@@ ed that security was at no time endangered . &quot;
&quot; area fires have destroyed parts of the Portuguese mainland this summer , where four people came to death on Madeira Island . &quot;
&quot; the Portuguese air forces today announced that the pilot had to fly as deep as the circumstances - strong fog and smoke - so deep , what limits his point of view &quot;
the plane was on a training flight where the pilot had to identify fishing boats as part of the exercise
Super@@ cup : Bar@@ ca with worry about Sev@@ ille
Sev@@ ille - The FC Barcelona will fight for the first step in the new football season on Sunday .
&quot; the Catal@@ ans compete against the FC Sevilla in the Du@@ el around the Spanish Super@@ cup , the back@@ play climb@@ s three days later at Camp No@@ u . &quot;
&quot; the dou@@ ble@@ winner must ref@@ rain from others to N@@ ey@@ mar with the inferior cup@@ fin@@ alists and ruling Europe League Champion , competing with Brazil the Olympic football tournament . &quot;
also there is also Go@@ alie Marc @-@ Andr@@ e ter St@@ egen .
&quot; the German suffered a change in the knee in the training , whereby the demand for Bar@@ ca at least was clari@@ fied in favor of Claudio Bra@@ vo . &quot;
&quot; for two years , the Chil@@ ean International and T@@ er St@@ egen compete for the status as number one for two years . &quot;
&quot; coach Luis En@@ ri@@ que reno@@ unced a clear decision in this respect so far , and left Bra@@ vo in the league , but T@@ er St@@ egen in most other Candi@@ dates will prevail . &quot;
&quot; before the first mandatory play of the new season , the Spanish master doubts about the fitness state of the team , who was humili@@ ated on Saturday in a test game of Liverpool with 0 : 4 . &quot;
&quot; also at 3 : 2 in the trial against S@@ amp@@ dor@@ ia on Wednesday , Li@@ onel Mess@@ i and Co. did not really convince . &quot;
&quot; again , Sevilla once again di@@ gest the 2 : 3 defeat after extension in the European Super@@ cup against Real Madrid and stri@@ ves for the second triumph at the &quot; Super@@ cop@@ a de Esp@@ ana . &quot; &quot;
&quot; with up to now , Barcelona is the record winner of the record winner in this review . &quot;
mA Long in a separate league for table tennis gold
Rio de Janeiro - The Chinese Ma Long is the new table tennis enthusi@@ ast .
&quot; on Thursday in Rio de Janeiro , the 27 @-@ year @-@ old defeated his comp@@ atri@@ ot and &quot; title def@@ ender &quot; Z@@ hang Ji@@ ke 4 : 0 ( 12,@@ 5.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; thus the World Tran@@ g@@ ist first took the &quot; Golden Grand S@@ lam &quot; with successes at the World Cup , World Cup , World Tour Fin@@ al@@ tur@@ nier and even Olympia . &quot;
bronze went to the Japanese Jun Mi@@ zut@@ ani .
the two Chinese have made it as expected into the final game and made themselves the title among themselves .
it was clear that for the third time in a row a Chinese would take the single title in the sign of the Five R@@ ings .
last non @-@ Chinese at the top Olympic podium was the former SV@@ S N@@ Ö Leg@@ ion@@ ary Ry@@ u Se@@ ung @-@ min from South Korea .
&quot; mA and Z@@ hang were left alone on the record alone , between sentences and time outs , they had no c@@ aches in themselves . &quot;
they had gone back to the grand@@ stand and left their prot@@ ectors in a fair competition alone .
&quot; the matches until now , I played for my country . &quot;
&quot; in the final , I play for me , &quot; Z@@ hang had said fol@@ ly . &quot;
&quot; after the game , gold and silver med@@ alli@@ sts with the China flag . &quot;
the match itself was un@@ expect@@ edly one @-@ sided .
mA had really fought with his 28 @-@ year @-@ old opponent in the first set .
&quot; after that , he determined the pace on the plate and left Z@@ hang down there only a total of 13 points . &quot;
the superi@@ ority of Ma did not develop the expected thr@@ illing match .
&quot; nevertheless , nevertheless , nevertheless , enough breath @-@ taking ball changes were to be seen . &quot;
Mi@@ zut@@ ani won the game for bronze against the 40 @-@ year @-@ old Vladimir Sam@@ son@@ ov 4 : 1 .
&quot; in his quarter @-@ fin@@ als of the German European champion Dimit@@ ri@@ j Ov@@ t@@ char@@ ov had contrac@@ ted a rib@@ bed injury , was then in medical treatment , &quot; ultimately &quot; had to be content with sheet metal . &quot;

Donald Tru@@ mp grants ″ huge problems ″ in the election campaign
the leadership of the US re@@ public@@ ans is pl@@ agu@@ ed by massive wor@@ ries even in traditional conservative states to lose their majority .
presidential candidate Donald Tru@@ mp today announced weakness of his campaign in the former republi@@ can stron@@ gh@@ old of U@@ tah .
a rare moment in which the usually large @-@ gauge and self @-@ confident multi@@ tim@@ il@@ li@@ on@@ aire vo@@ iced something like concerns such as correspon@@ dents reported .
&quot; having thrown 16 ri@@ vals within the own republi@@ can camp from the race , doubts about his success in the struggle for the White House are now growing . &quot;
&quot; we have huge problems in U@@ tah , &quot; &quot; said Tru@@ mp to evangel@@ ical Christians , who asked for support in major states like Ohio , Florida or Virginia . &quot;
&quot; gu@@ ilt are false reports about his can@@ did@@ acy , he took up his well @-@ known media . &quot;
Republi@@ can stron@@ gh@@ old w@@ ack@@ eln
U@@ tah is usually a safe bank for the Republi@@ cans .
&quot; according to a survey by Surv@@ ey@@ USA from June , Tru@@ mp and his ri@@ vals were reported by the Democrats , Hill@@ ary Clinton . &quot;
&quot; other institutes see Tru@@ mp in front , but not by the distance that is custom@@ ary for Republi@@ can candidates in the state . &quot;
Arizona and Georgia are also regarded as endangered .
&quot; in an interview by Sen@@ ders CNB@@ C , Tru@@ mp rep@@ lied to the question of how he wanted to stop the rise of Clin@@ tons again : &quot; just as I did so far . &quot;
&quot; and if afterwards : this will be &quot; either successful , or I will make a very nice , long holiday . &quot;
he doesn &apos;t make anything else than telling the truth .
&quot; if it is not rich for him in the end because of political correctness , that is ok , Tru@@ mp said . &quot;
then I return to a very good way of life .
&quot; according to press reports , the Tru@@ mp party is supposed to have threatened funds to support his campaign , he should not present any better survey results . &quot;
&quot; instead of this , the candidates of the Republi@@ cans wanted to get stronger among the arms for the congress . &quot;
Olympia : three Sc@@ am at D@@ oping Test
the IO@@ C aims to establish a disciplinary committee .
Kenya &apos;s athletes are threatened with the second D@@ oping affair at the Rio de Janeiro Olympics in Rio de Janeiro .
&quot; after a fraud attempt at a dop@@ ing control in the Olympic Village , Kenya sent a coach home . &quot;
the International Olympic Committee dealt with immediately establishing a disciplinary committee in order to investigate the case .
&quot; a Ken@@ yan function@@ ary had communicated that the former Spr@@ inter and today &apos;s coach , John An@@ z@@ rah , had left a urine specimen under the name of the 800 @-@ meter @-@ runner F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ ich . &quot;
this was reported by the team leadership of Kenya by D@@ oping inspec@@ tors .
the I@@ A@@ AF World Federation has searched the IO@@ C for information about the case in order to ad@@ here to its own investigations a I@@ A@@ AF spokes@@ person shared .
&quot; depending on the results of the study and the following actions of the IO@@ C , the I@@ A@@ AF will make an assessment , &quot; it was said in an I@@ A@@ AF statement . &quot;
&quot; he ( An@@ z@@ rah ) went to the D@@ oping control station and presented himself as F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ ich , released and signed , &quot; declared Kenya &apos;s chief de Mission Stephan Ara@@ p So@@ i . &quot;
he was in possession of the accredi@@ tation of the ath@@ l@@ ete who was on the list for training checks of the world anti @-@ dop@@ ing agency .
F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ ich became more than 800 meters in Beijing in 2015 .
&quot; four days before , the Ken@@ yan athle@@ tics board member Michael Rot@@ ich was with@@ drawn from the Rio Olympics . &quot;
he is alleged to have informed about pending dop@@ ing tests for athletes of his country .
&quot; according to media reports , he was report@@ edly arrested at his return at the airport of Nairobi . &quot;
Kenya has been under special observation at the IO@@ C after numerous dop@@ ing experiments .
&quot; in the announcement of the more than 2000 dop@@ ing targets laid out by the IO@@ C , more than 2000 dop@@ ing targets before the Rio Olympics were noted that especially athletes of Kenya and Russia were taken into sight . &quot;
the world anti @-@ dop@@ ing agency had a lot of pressure on the African country before the summer Games in Brazil to create an anti @-@ dop@@ ing law and a functioning control system .
the law was adopted a few weeks before the Olympic start .
&quot; subsequently , the WA@@ DA Kenya adopted by the list of countries whose dop@@ ing fight is compliant with the rules of WA@@ DA . &quot;
Kenya is considered a big runner @-@ nation .
the athletes of the country won most medals at the 2015 World Cup in Beijing .
&quot; in a series of television reports by the ARD there were repeatedly alleg@@ ations that in Kenya dop@@ ing means are easily accessible , and there should be a substantial ment@@ ality of sports bet@@ s . &quot;
&quot; IO@@ C member Richard Po@@ und finally called for a similar examination in Kenya , as he had employed in Russian athle@@ tics . &quot;
it could be proven that in this sport @-@ type widespread and systematically ged@@ opt .
Russia &apos;s athletes were subsequently excluded from the summer games .
Salzburg &quot; West Side Story &quot; with Ceci@@ lia Bart@@ oli
&quot; at the Shakespeare @-@ Year , the Salzburg Festival presents the &quot; West Side Story &quot; with Tony and Maria as a tragic couple , similar to Romeo and Juli@@ et . &quot;
with it a surprising Ceci@@ lia Bart@@ oli .
&quot; a musical conqu@@ ers Salzburg : the &quot; West Side Story &quot; , &quot; Le@@ orn@@ ard Bern@@ steins master@@ piece . &quot;
the artistic director Ceci@@ lia Bart@@ oli wanted to bring the musical into the temple of classical music and filled with the role of Mary an Jugend@@ traum .
&quot; in the orchestra , the Sim@@ ón Bol@@ í@@ var Orchestra under the direction of the Venezu@@ el@@ an Di@@ ri@@ gen@@ ten Gust@@ av@@ o Du@@ dam@@ el : &quot; this music is full of rhythm , &quot; he war@@ ms . &quot;
we always say that it is very Latin American .
there are many Latin American ingredients at their pace and their melody .
&quot; it &apos;s a wonderful mix , the perfect recipe for our orchestra . &quot;
I would say that we really have Bernstein &apos;s music in our blood !
in this st@@ aging Bart@@ oli plays an older Maria .
she rec@@ alls her love with Tony while the younger Maria plays and dances .
the role of Mary always fascinated me .
&quot; first , because they are musi@@ cally exceptional ! &quot;
and then there would be Mary &apos;s personality .
&quot; she says it in her song : &quot; &quot; I feel pretty , oh so pretty , I feel pretty and wit@@ ty and bright . &quot;
&quot; so she is clever , of course also na@@ ï@@ ve , and very passion@@ ately . &quot;
&quot; she resem@@ bles me very , my Italian character , whom I have as Roman , &quot; laugh@@ s Bart@@ oli . &quot;
Du@@ dam@@ el is full of praise for the opera singer : &quot; Ceci@@ lia is a wonderful artist . &quot;
it is such an honour for us to work with her .
it is an enor@@ mously generous person .
and Bart@@ oli returns the compli@@ ment : &quot; Du@@ dam@@ el is such an extraordinary artist and very passionate ! &quot;
conducting is a necessity for him .
&quot; you see it in each of his movements , in his looks , it &apos;s his life ! &quot;
it is such a huge opportunity to share this musical experience with him .
&quot; we both have a rather southern temper@@ ament , a fire , a passion and also a cheer@@ ful approach to life , that is very important at all ! &quot;
&quot; for American director Philip W@@ m . Mc@@ Kin@@ ley is the &quot; &quot; West Side Story &quot; &quot; up to date : &quot; this piece deals with pre@@ judi@@ ces and fan@@ ati@@ cism . &quot;
&quot; today we have the refugees , back then the Republi@@ cans went to New York , and the New York inhabitants didn &apos;t want them . &quot;
&quot; they are the same topics , and today they are as meaningful as at that time . &quot;
59 years later the piece is still relevant .
London school@@ girl who joined the IS was killed in Syria
&quot; K@@ adi@@ za Sult@@ ana , one of three British school girls , leaving London last year to join the IS , report@@ edly died in Syria . &quot;
&quot; the lawyer Tas@@ ni@@ me A@@ kun@@ je@@ e said that her family went to Ra@@ q@@ q@@ a , Syria a few weeks ago . &quot;
&quot; it was suspected that it was killed by a Russian air attack in Ra@@ q@@ q@@ a , the Boll@@ werk of the group in the country , IT@@ V News reported on Thursday . &quot;
Sult@@ ana was 17 years old and died according to her family shortly after she had anticipated to leave the war @-@ packed country and return to England .
&quot; one can only hope that the only good is in it - as a reminder and warning to others that these are the risks associated with it to ever make this decision , &quot; &quot; said A@@ kun@@ je@@ e . &quot;
&quot; in February 2015 , Sult@@ ana and two other school girls from eastern London went into a plane in the direction of Turkey and subsequently into a bus to the Syrian border . &quot;
Sult@@ ana family was informed that she married an IS@@ IS fighter in Syria - and became a wi@@ dow within a few months .
&quot; Rei@@ d says , Clinton , in the case of election victory in Gar@@ land , will remain as candidates for the Supreme Court &quot;
&quot; Harry Rei@@ d , leader of the Democrats in the Senate , is convinced that the presidential candidate of Democrats , Hill@@ ary Clinton nom@@ inate Mer@@ ri@@ ck Gar@@ land for the Supreme Court . &quot;
the Republi@@ cans in the Senate have blocked Gar@@ land &apos;s confirmation since his nom@@ ination by Barack Obama in March .
the majority leader in Senate Mit@@ ch Mc@@ Conn@@ ell believes that the next president will ap@@ point the successor of the dec@@ eased judge at the Supreme Court Anton@@ in Sc@@ alia .
&quot; Rei@@ d said on Thursday during a telephone conference that he expects Clinton to choose &quot; &quot; Gar@@ land &quot; &quot; with a certain degree of certainty . &quot;
&quot; a spokes@@ woman of Rei@@ d later said he was not talking to Clinton , if she would nom@@ inate Gar@@ land and he spec@@ ulate . &quot;
&quot; he praised Gar@@ land and said , Clin@@ t &apos;s team would not care for rest@@ lessness with a new candidate . &quot;
Gar@@ land is the top judge for the US App@@ ell@@ ation Court for the District of Columbia .
&quot; RAID said that Republi@@ cans blocked the Gar@@ lands nom@@ ination , be Lak@@ ai@@ en and hel@@ pers of the republi@@ can presidential candidate Donald Tru@@ mp . &quot;

Tre@@ ats wants to have neck calendar for &quot; women and for men &quot;
the Tre@@ ats Magazine works with the photographer David BEL@@ LE@@ MER@@ E to release Pir@@ elli @-@ inspired calendar for 2017 .
&quot; but instead of famous naked people , they would like to find the next generation of Top@@ models for their N@@ U M@@ uses Calendar for 2017 . &quot;
&quot; the editor @-@ in @-@ chief of Tre@@ ats Steve Sha@@ w told us at the beginning of this year that his neck @-@ magazine of Old@@ school @-@ Play@@ boys distingu@@ ishes , because &quot; Play@@ boy is for men . &quot; &quot;
I do this for women .
&quot; apparently , it is the view that it does the calendar . &quot;
&quot; we must return to the representation of timeless and classical nu@@ dity , with which both women and men feel comfortable and feel inspired by these images of a female body , &quot; said Sha@@ w in a press release for the publication of the Kal@@ end@@ ars . &quot;
women will want to participate in this project because it is a beautiful work of art .
models can submit their pictures online or in person with open casting call in Los Angeles and New York .
Turkey : Kur@@ dish community expects mass curse
&quot; whoever does not adapt and pra@@ ises Erd@@ og@@ an sits on packed suit@@ cases , &quot; says the &quot; &quot; CV @-@ Close Foundation &quot; &quot; dialog and world , Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un . &quot;
&quot; in the short term , the Kur@@ dish community of Germany expects tens of thousands of protective seek@@ ers fle@@ eing from Turkey to Germany . &quot;
&quot; in the medium term , it could even become &quot; a few hundred thousand , &quot; believes the president Ali Top@@ ra@@ k . &quot;
&quot; because of the hard drive of Turkish President Rec@@ ep Tay@@ y@@ ip Erd@@ og@@ an after the coup attempt , the Kur@@ dish community of Germany expects a mass flight to Germany . &quot;
&quot; at short notice , I reck@@ on with tens of thousands , in the medium term with some hundred thousand prot@@ esters from Turkey in Germany , if the Erd@@ og@@ an regime continues to fight the minorities and the democratic opposition , &quot; says the President Ali Top@@ ra@@ k of the &quot; World &quot; from Friday . &quot;
&quot; because the government already over@@ took Kur@@ dish bur@@ ge@@ ons with imp@@ air@@ ments before months , 500,000 Kur@@ ds within Turkey were on the run . &quot;
&quot; after the whi@@ pped put@@ sch , still secular and op@@ posi@@ tional ethnic Tur@@ ks were added . &quot;
many will want to start new in Europe if they are further supp@@ ressed in Turkey .
&quot; it cannot be that a state , which itself absor@@ bs refugees , produces refugees in their own country , &quot; said Top@@ ra@@ k . &quot;
&quot; the Verb@@ and@@ sch@@ ef accused the targeted settlement of Syrian Arabs in Kur@@ dish , but also in al@@ evi@@ tical cities . &quot;
&quot; with this , Erd@@ og@@ an wants to increase the tear pressure on the remaining Kur@@ ds . &quot;

&quot; the German government demanded that the Federal Government is &quot; &quot; as sharp as Austria against Erd@@ og@@ an and its followers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; even in Germany , a &quot; &quot; witch hunt &quot; &quot; takes place against Erd@@ og@@ an critics . &quot;
I feel no longer safe in Germany for the first time in the last few months .
the German branch of the Gü@@ len movement also fears the escape of many Tur@@ ks abroad .
&quot; more Tur@@ ks will look for asylum in Germany , especially Kur@@ ds and Op@@ position@@ ists . &quot;

&quot; as the newspaper reported on the number of the German Ministry of Interior , the Tur@@ ks were the largest group of asylum seek@@ ers recognised in Germany because of political persecution . &quot;
&quot; at the end of June 30 , these were 11,@@ 386 people and therefore almost 29 percent of all have been recognised as asylum seek@@ ers ( 39.@@ 625 ) . &quot;
&quot; this survey does not apply to war , poverty or lack of perspective . &quot;
&quot; asylum seek@@ ers according to the Basic Law are exclusively political , i.e. , from the state side , individually persec@@ uted . &quot;
Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : &quot; to go where it is doing &quot;
strange Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : the locals get nothing from summer campaign with - and the holiday@@ makers from North Rhine @-@ Westphalia are not allowed to choose the country day .
in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern they understood .
&quot; 2021 will not take place again at the end of the summer holidays , the Schwer@@ in Parliament has already decided at the beginning of the year . &quot;
&quot; because stupid than hi@@ ther@@ to it is not : summer holidays , heat and land election campaign - that bit@@ es itself . &quot;
&quot; the locals , who are to be convinced by the election fighters , are on vacation . &quot;
&quot; most of the vac@@ ation@@ ers who are in the country , on Us@@ edom , Rügen or Hid@@ den@@ see are no locals , so they are not allowed to choose the country day . &quot;
&quot; practical problems come : during the holidays , hel@@ pers , posters , infl@@ ating air bal@@ lo@@ ons , distribute fl@@ yers and end up voices at the end , are only lab@@ orious . &quot;
&quot; until September 4 , 2016 , the elec@@ toral and final holiday day , Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern has to pass the election campaign just under the crowd . &quot;
&quot; the hot phase , if you can say it at all , has just begun . &quot;
&quot; and it &apos;s also about something : Prime Minister Erwin Sell@@ ering , leader of a SPD / CD@@ U coalition , must be afraid of his ministry . &quot;
&quot; the SPD , the strongest party since 1998 , is now clear behind the CD@@ U . &quot;
it is exciting how strongly Ne@@ ul@@ ing Af@@ D cuts off and what remains at the end of the coalition @-@ dust .
&quot; Sell@@ ering , 66 years old and since 2008 head of government , makes an almost in@@ con@@ spic@@ uous election campaign , one sees by his big posters . &quot;
&quot; he travels through the land , spread ro@@ ses and ch@@ ats a little with the people , just as it did his legendary word@@ cart predecessor Harald Ring@@ storff . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , Seel@@ ering gets cold feet and chan@@ cell@@ or Merkel sets blame on the blos@@ som@@ ing of the Af@@ D . &quot;
&quot; your refugee policy , you &quot; We create that &quot; accelerated the rise of the right @-@ wing pop@@ uli@@ sts , which will probably cost him the beautiful office . &quot;
&quot; the CD@@ U with its top candidate , the Minister of Interior , Lor@@ enz C@@ aff@@ ier , has already experienced how it is , if you are at the right place at the right place . &quot;
she has twice been invited by Chancellor Angela Merkel ; Merkel &apos;s parliament is located in the north @-@ east .
&quot; but the target group did not agree , there were more North Rhine @-@ Westphalia , Berlin and Saxony as Mecklenburg and Vorpommern . &quot;
&quot; it was probably the majority of other federal states , &quot; said Vincent Co@@ ert , Secretary General of the CD@@ U in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern , recently in N@@ DR . &quot;
but it is too bad to anybody from other corners of Germany to listen to Angela Merkel .
&quot; otherwise , the Nord@@ ost @-@ CD@@ U does not reno@@ unce the usual election campaigns on market@@ places and before shopping m@@ alls with umbr@@ ellas and bal@@ lo@@ ons . &quot;
&quot; that , says Kok@@ ert , plays only a &quot; subordin@@ ate role . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the Union , too , has noted that in the country you are breaking away the base that it must be very strict , again to find a wire to the people . &quot;
&quot; it is like the left , the SPD , the Gre@@ ens : in the pages of the country hardly exist . &quot;
&quot; the Council of the CD@@ U election fighter Kok@@ ert on his fellow workers is also self @-@ expos@@ ing : &quot; &quot; you have to go where it w@@ ows , namely where people are : Dor@@ ff@@ est , Golden Wed@@ dings , every birthday party must be used . &quot;
&quot; because much is on the game , Sell@@ ering has called his SPD for a particularly committed election campaign . &quot;
&quot; in surveys , the Socialists and Democrats last with 22 percent behind partners CD@@ U ( 25 ) and just shortly before the Af@@ D ( 19 ) . &quot;
&quot; at the election of 2011 , the SPD won a clear 35.@@ 6 percent before the CD@@ U ( 22 ) . &quot;
&quot; the Gre@@ ens , a small party with seven percent in the poll@@ s , should make the leap into the land @-@ day . &quot;
they make a modern virtue out of the holiday poverty and put their election campaign largely on the internet .
&quot; online election campaign , &quot; says the president Claudia Müller . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , green elec@@ toral campaig@@ ners embar@@ k on track search for local stimul@@ i among holiday@@ makers . &quot;
&quot; Sil@@ ke Ga@@ je@@ k , the top candidate , cur@@ v@@ t straight with a hous@@ ebo@@ at through the Mecklenburg lakes and finds it even beautiful . &quot;
&quot; their impression : &quot; &quot; voting holidays in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern is not a punishment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
B@@ 27 @-@ Rehabilitation : restaurants suffer from blocking
&quot; the speed with which the B 27 is rehabil@@ it@@ ated , there is nothing to compl@@ ain . &quot;
&quot; for those responsible for the construction work , starting at 5.@@ 30 in the morning and end only at 20 o &apos;clock , there is no praise . &quot;
&quot; they did everything pretty sharp , &quot; El@@ vi@@ ra T@@ etz@@ l@@ aff tells of the Jet petrol station . &quot;
this is a super team .
there is no delay .
&quot; the building site could be reloc@@ ated to the south at the beginning of the week , until the end of October everything should be finished . &quot;
&quot; the remun@@ eration of those responsible for construction work will also be praised , for example when it comes to the establishment of accommodation operations . &quot;
&quot; since the construction site took place on Monday to the south and also the block@@ age of the asphalt road in Of@@ ter@@ d@@ ingen has been lifted , and therefore the connection to Rot@@ ten@@ burg has been restored , the traffic situation within the place has eased . &quot;
the citizens can now return from Of@@ ter@@ d@@ ingen from the B 27 back on both sides .
the way of escap@@ ing through the place seems to go back .
&quot; there were some serious complaints , &quot; says the dep@@ uty chief executive director Florian King , responsible for the transport @-@ related management of the restructuring department . &quot;
&quot; the residents of Bach@@ straße , Stein@@ l@@ ach@@ straße , Haf@@ nerst@@ raße and Wei@@ her@@ rain had to fight with more traffic noise because many cre@@ ams were looking for and rather familiar to their nav@@ i than the sign@@ posting . &quot;
what led to some trucks in residential areas de@@ fran@@ k .
&quot; since the speed limits were not met , the church also encouraged the trade fair from M@@ ös@@ singen . &quot;
&quot; there were significant transgres@@ sions , &quot; says King , who headed himself on the spot on the spot . &quot;
there are already two to three per minute .
the quick@@ est was on the way with 77 hours of hour in the Tempo @-@ 30 zone .
&quot; since the construction site has been moved , however , it has become qui@@ eter . &quot;
&quot; for the business@@ men at the B 27 , it is only a small con@@ sol@@ ation that for customers from Rot@@ ten@@ burg the street is now open . &quot;
business people don &apos;t like to have a look at the cards .
&quot; but that the B 27 refurb@@ ishment in them has led to sales incub@@ ation , everyone who is asked to look through . &quot;
&quot; however , some more and some are less affected . &quot;
&quot; who has less to do with the &quot; end customer , &quot; so for other companies , for whom the refurb@@ ishment has little consequences . &quot;
&quot; in Mai@@ er &apos;s car deal@@ ership , Thomas Sul@@ z also talks about a &quot; most slight drop , &quot; but also adm@@ its that &quot; the lear@@ ner is missing . &quot; &quot;
the most heavily exploited are the local ones along the road .
&quot; J. Albert G@@ öh@@ ner , owner of the Ste@@ ak@@ house , formerly Krone , finds clear words . &quot;
this is already exist@@ ential .
&quot; not only him , but all inn@@ s have hit it &quot; hard . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the customers were missing from H@@ ech@@ ingen , Bal@@ ingen and Rot@@ t@@ weil . &quot;
we must be happy about every euro turnover .
&quot; on &quot; &quot; far more than 50 percent &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the &quot; &quot; Straß@@ ens@@ an@@ agement &quot; &quot; was thrown back for two years . &quot;
he had to dismis@@ s half of his employees .
&quot; if I had a company with 4,000 employees and half would have been dismis@@ sed , politics would have responded differently . &quot;
&quot; instead , President Jörg Schmidt has responded to a request by G@@ öh@@ ner , whether it could give financial compensation , otherwise benef@@ iting from the advantages of the location on the B 27 . now they also have to bear the dis@@ advantages caused by the refurb@@ ishment . &quot;
&quot; G@@ Ö@@ H@@ NER knows from other districts , where so much more generous is handled . &quot;
&quot; with all complaints , G@@ öh@@ ner is confident that his restaurant will continue . &quot;
&quot; after all , the family business has already settled here since 17@@ 15 , he points to the long history . &quot;
&quot; now , that other regular guests can visit less frequently due to complicated traffic management , he can understand . &quot;
&quot; if you cannot come here , it is also quite nice . &quot;
&quot; returning to the end of the refurb@@ ishment work , G@@ öh@@ ner has no doubts . &quot;
&quot; despite the crises with BSE and avian influ@@ enza , G@@ öh@@ ner considers the effects of the B 27 construction work on its customers for the biggest crisis , which has experienced its restaurant in its long history . &quot;
&quot; six months construction work , which is already brutal . &quot;
it is constantly screw@@ ed on in the name of the fight against terrorism .
&quot; following recent proposals , Interior Minister de Mai@@ zi@@ ère is now presenting a thick security package . &quot;
but what has a dop@@ ing status to do with terror ?
and what does the coalition partner say to all this ?
Thomas de Mai@@ zi@@ ère gives the öh@@ ner .
&quot; all his suggestions are politically reasonable to the coalition partner , &quot; says the Federal Minister for the introduction of his new security package . &quot;
they don &apos;t ask anyone .
&quot; other , further points would be discussed within the parties . &quot;
also in doing that I take part .
&quot; but the minister of the Interior , however , is located on results and on a &quot; achiev@@ able consensus &quot; within the coalition . &quot;
&quot; after the recent attacks in Wu@@ erz@@ burg and Ans@@ bach , de Mai@@ zi@@ ère had a little time to store before he presents his conclusions for security in the Republic . &quot;
but these are all the more extensive .
&quot; some have already been announced , announced , announced , that a new security authority in order to ensure encrypted communication is not new . &quot;
it is also not the fact that Germany has to implement several EU directives on air passengers and weapons law .
the call for more video surveillance and personnel for the security authorities is not surprising .
&quot; in part , de Mai@@ zi@@ ère starts a second attempt for proposals that have not yet been made with the SPD : he wants to put sympathy for terrorist groups under punishment and push ji@@ hadi@@ sts with a double citizenship to the German passport . &quot;
&quot; this will be difficult points for the SPD , &quot; the CD@@ U is granted . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , he thinks this is reasonable and does not demand anything that has no chances in the coalition partner anyway . &quot;
a few new ideas are presented as Mai@@ zi@@ ère .
they have partly in themselves : he plans fast @-@ trial for deport@@ ations and more possibilities for det@@ ention of people from deport@@ ation .
&quot; refugees , who are systematically brought into the country , should check their smartphones in advance and open social media accounts for a safety check . &quot;
&quot; for asylum seek@@ ers for ex@@ pi@@ red asylum seek@@ ers , he wants to make some worse than hi@@ ther@@ to - such as those who commit crimes or deliberately throw off their papers to disgu@@ ise their identity . &quot;
some of them are political and legally sanc@@ tified .
some of them are still un@@ balanced and can be answered questions openly .
&quot; and with some points - in the im@@ balance of patient , for example - the question arises : what does this have to do with safety and terror ? &quot;
&quot; yes , de Mai@@ zi@@ ère says it is important to differenti@@ ate between the subjects of refugees and terror . &quot;
but it cannot be said that the assass@@ inations of Ans@@ bach and Wu@@ erz@@ burg were refugees .
&quot; in addition , many people worried about security in view of the high number of refugees . &quot;
and things that the people are pro@@ found@@ ly employed could not clas@@ h themselves in elec@@ toral periods .
the inner safety is enor@@ mously moved into the focus .
&quot; the attacks in the neighbourhood : Paris , Copenhagen , Brussels , Nice . &quot;
then the attacks in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach .
the uncertainty is great .
&quot; yes , there are elec@@ toral competitions . &quot;
&quot; therefore , the Union and the SPD are increasingly taking place in the field of internal security . &quot;
&quot; in the past few days , it went up between the two parties . &quot;
&quot; only a tender dispute over the equipment of the Federal Police , then via a security policy collection of some Uni@@ ons Interior Minister , in which the R@@ ess@@ ort@@ chiefs also demand a Bur@@ ka ban and a revers@@ al of the double citizenship . &quot;
de Mai@@ zi@@ ère is also working here to reconc@@ ile sound .
&quot; from a revers@@ al of the double pass , he does nothing . &quot;
we have fixed the discussion in Germany .
&quot; to re@@ make you new , do not make sense . &quot;
&quot; and with a Bur@@ ka ban , he has constitutional obj@@ ections . &quot;
&quot; whether its own package is constitu@@ tionally constitutional and whether it is actually &quot; reasonable &quot; for the coalition partner , it must first show itself . &quot;
there &apos;s a lot of things to worry about .
&quot; however , the SPD also tries to benefit from internal security . &quot;
&quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything , which helps to further increase security . &quot;

in the recall action there are vor@@ tices about a term .
Volkswagen starts delivery in the second half of the year .
&quot; in spite of its many brands and some well running markets , Europe &apos;s biggest car manufacturer can continue to advance a plus in spite of its many brands and some well @-@ running markets . &quot;
&quot; but in July the Volkswagen brand weak@@ ened mainly in Western Europe and thus loaded the total sale , as the company noted in the D@@ ax . &quot;
&quot; in July , the VW brand sold 1.8 percent less vehicles than in the previous year . &quot;
&quot; in Western Europe alone , according to China the second most important market , sales were 14 percent below the previous year &apos;s month . &quot;
&quot; in the home market of Germany , the deliveries declined by almost a sixth . &quot;

&quot; in addition , in some core markets , it has given a &quot; &quot; changed economic framework &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in addition to the situation around the coup attempt in Turkey , the British vote was also stressed out of the EU , a spokes@@ woman explained . &quot;
&quot; in the USA , where the exhaust coff@@ ers first escal@@ ated , there is also a minus to beech . &quot;
large support for VW is the Chinese market .
&quot; all in all , the most affected domestic brand of the Lower Saxony already gets lightly lightly thanks to the diesel sc@@ andal : after the first seven months , only an ex@@ tradition is 0.9 percent to 3,@@ 37 million vehicles . &quot;
&quot; from January to July , group sales manager Fred Kap@@ pler continued to show a sales schedule . &quot;
&quot; 1.3 percent more vehicles delivered Volkswagen at this time , worldwide 5,@@ 904 million . &quot;
Volkswagen has been manipul@@ ated with a software exhaust tests .
&quot; in Germany alone , VW is calling around 2.5 million cars for retro@@ fitting into workshops . &quot;
&quot; in the course of retro@@ fitting , Volkswagen re@@ affir@@ med that the conversion of the cars has no negative effects . &quot;
&quot; after retro@@ fitting the vehicles , there is no deteri@@ oration in fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or engine performance . &quot;
&quot; after retro@@ fitting , the autom@@ aker set up a &quot; guarantee &quot; certificate , but does not speak of a &quot; guarantee &quot; as it was on Friday in business travel . &quot;
the reasons are legal qualities .
&quot; the &quot; Focus &quot; had reported , Volkswagen won its German customers now a guarantee for converted diesel models . &quot;
this would have been confirmed last Monday Volkswagen representatives in the Federal Office of Transport .
&quot; from the Ministry of Transport , it was confirmed that there was this meeting . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; VW has fulfilled the requirements of my inquiry commission and the KBA full range . &quot;
&quot; devi@@ ations from these are not accepted , &quot; said Federal Minister Alexander Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t ( CS@@ U ) according to the ministry . &quot;
&quot; VW has taken over the guarantee that fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or engine performance after retro@@ fitting will not take place and all vehicle @-@ relevant vehicle values remain unchanged . &quot;
&quot; Volkswagen itself does not use the term &quot; &quot; guarantee &quot; &quot; but not as promised in business travel . &quot;
&quot; on the wide term &quot; &quot; guarantee &quot; , &quot; Volkswagen is able to provide customers for example half a year after retro@@ fitting with a engine damage to a workshop - and this could lead to the new software even if the damage has nothing to do with it . &quot;
&quot; also in the customer interest , it is important to avoid that any other damage that has nothing to do with the sc@@ andal is to prevent uncertainty with regard to possible warranty regulations as it was . &quot;
&quot; therefore , VW does not use the term &quot; warranty . &quot; &quot;
the Rai@@ ff@@ eisen@@ bank G@@ mund on T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see requires rich as@@ parag@@ us in the future - as a second institute in Germany .
&quot; chief Apostle Josef Paul said on Thursday , &quot; &quot; It is only about 139 customers who park 40 million euros on gi@@ ro@@ - or daily money accounts . &quot;
&quot; the Federal Association of German banks speaks of a single case and does not see in it any signal : &quot; &quot; normal savings &quot; &quot; would not have to fear , to pay for their as@@ parag@@ us pen@@ alties . &quot;
&quot; in order to store money overnight at the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , banks must pay their 0.4 per cent penalty . &quot;
&quot; this fee demands the Rai@@ ff@@ eisen@@ bank G@@ mund from September of private and corporate clients for deposits over 100,000 euros on gre@@ ed or cash accounts . &quot;
&quot; the first 100,000 euros are free . &quot;
&quot; the next 100,000 will cost 400 euros in the year , &quot; Paul said . &quot;
&quot; it has been 40 million euros for some time , which could be lifted from one day to the other , and which he could not utilize . &quot;
&quot; they lie with me on the central bank account and cause 0.4 per cent of costs , &quot; &quot; said the Head of the Bank . &quot;
&quot; I cannot lay down for every million 4,000 Euro . &quot;
&quot; according to the pol@@ lu@@ ter principle , it is now possible to pass the costs . &quot;
&quot; leaving cash simply in the v@@ aults of the Rai@@ ff@@ eisen@@ bank would be too dangerous : &quot; I have already experienced four attacks , I don &apos;t like the fifth ! &quot; &quot; said the bank performance . &quot;
most customers would have understanding and changed to other investment forms .
only a few mig@@ rated to other banks .
&quot; the cooperative association Bayern stated : &quot; &quot; the extreme monetary policy course of the ECB is causing considerable costs for all banks . &quot;
&quot; to carry on alone , &quot; &quot; business @-@ economically sustainable &quot; &quot; is not possible . &quot;
&quot; some German banks therefore have increased their charges for account management , credit cards or transfers . &quot;
the Thür@@ inger Volks@@ - und Rai@@ ff@@ eisen@@ bank Alten@@ burger Land had head@@ lines with their Sk@@ at@@ bank branch in 2014 .
&quot; Michael Kem@@ mer , chief executive of the Banking Union , said : &quot; &quot; we do not expect private customers to pay for deposits for deposits , the competition in Germany under banks and savings banks is much too strong . &quot;
&quot; a ban@@ ker said , at the T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see there is &quot; a client@@ ele , which is a bit su@@ mp@@ tu@@ ous of fortune . &quot;
&quot; this can become a problem for a small bank , if they bew@@ are free money . &quot;

&quot; the Gen@@ ossen@@ schafts@@ verband Bayern &quot; is currently not known to any other banks , who charge a compensation for deposits of private customers , &quot; said spokes@@ man Ernst . &quot;
&quot; the President of the German Volks@@ bank and Rai@@ ff@@ eisen banks ( 1 BvR ) , Uwe Fr@@ öh@@ lich , declared at the end of June : &quot; the threshold to go into negative towards private customers is very , very high . &quot;
&quot; competition is hard , and it threat@@ ens the migration of investors to the competition . &quot;

destination plates : who is buying vinyl records ?
lon@@ ely men of middle age love records .
&quot; before you hur@@ ry to the comment@@ section , to persu@@ ade him under the pseu@@ don@@ ym non @-@ Alle@@ Ein@@ sam@@ en@@ Al@@ ters with rough ins@@ ults , this statement deri@@ ves from current data . &quot;
&quot; according to You@@ Go@@ v , the much discussed re @-@ emergence of vinyl records is not attri@@ but@@ able to a boom in mill@@ enni@@ als who want to welcome the news of physical objects , but to Mid@@ life nostal@@ gia . &quot;
those who have recently bought a record are all fores@@ ight after the age between 45 and 54 .
&quot; in fact , the age group of 18 @-@ 24 is the most impro@@ b@@ able farmer group . &quot;
there is also no hor@@ des by hobby collectors - it has an emotional meaning : older record buyers keep their feelings rather for themselves ( 56 % vs. 53 % ) and enjoy it alone ( 69 % vs. 66 % ) .
but do the results of You@@ Go@@ v agree ?
&quot; if this blog would be a news report on TV , I would follow the camera while I run in the middle of a busy street in Soh@@ o , a modest gray suit , keeping my hands and some determin@@ ant say like : &quot; so , let &apos;s take a closer look at it . &quot;
so let &apos;s take a look at it .
&quot; even though the heart of Soh@@ o gets lost in its charm - hotels , restaurants and offices now fill the buildings in which once independent sellers were resident - there is still a hand@@ ful of fantastic record specialty shops . &quot;
I would probably ask the cam@@ er@@ aman to switch off the camera for the next part in which I stand in close proximity to various men in such shops and try to assess their age and mind through observation .
&quot; art from Glasgow , 55 , whom I from Si@@ ster Ray ( number of data : two young women , three men of middle age ) into Rec@@ kl@@ ess Records ( number of data : eight men middle aged , one woman , presum@@ ably around 20 ) , is one day long because of a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the few hours . &quot;
&quot; is he a collector , I ask ? &quot;
&quot; I guess already , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; I have about 3,000 or 4,000 plates . &quot;
&quot; these vinyl records , shown above ( he sent me the snap@@ shot by e @-@ mail , I haven &apos;t followed him home ) , dress the walls of his living room . &quot;
&quot; the reason why he has such a considerable number of albums and singles , is the result of his available income : he is now able to buy records he could not afford than they appeared and buy items he sold when he was young and pl@@ ast@@ ered . &quot;
&quot; many things I buy are from the late 60s , early 70s , who appeared when I was 11 or 12 . things where I was probably something too young to buy them , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; he agre@@ es that those who buy records are rather intro@@ ver@@ ted and would like to spend time alone , and adds : &quot; I don &apos;t smoke and I don &apos;t drink very much . &quot;
this is my vice .
&quot; WE@@ Z , 25 , who works at Si@@ ster Ray believes that many customers , whom he meets , apply to the You@@ Go@@ v profile . &quot;
&quot; he also noticed a new wave of people who are influenced by the media , people who have heard about the com@@ eback and have promp@@ ted themselves to buy their old records . &quot;
&quot; from the conversations I have led , people normally have been emp@@ tied around 1998 or 1999 in their collection . &quot;
&quot; customers who once sold their records to buy CDs , sell their CDs now to buy their records , &quot; he says . &quot;
this would explain the boom to tra@@ ilers of a certain age .
but what about the alleged emotional significance of plates ?
it takes only a few seconds in a shop like ph@@ onica to realize that record stores offers a cal@@ ming community of like @-@ minded people .
&quot; according to We@@ z , some of the older customers accepted the contact@@ less payment system . &quot;
&quot; some record fans feel overwhel@@ med by the digital world and want to rever@@ t back to the stability of familiar sound@@ tracks , from objects that are happy to evoke experiences . &quot;
&quot; I think , sometimes it can be the filling of a void or possession of material pos@@ sessions as a kind of comfort , &quot; says We@@ z . &quot;
that &apos;s the case with me as a collector and I think it is so with many people .
it is a simple way to deal mentally .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we are like their social workers ! &quot; &quot; sol@@ der a staff from a plate stack . &quot;
a survey conducted by the IC@@ M in April revealed that nearly 50 % of the people who bought a record last month have not yet stopped .
&quot; the survey also found that 41 % have a turn@@ table that they never use while 7 % of those who buy a record , no record player . &quot;
&quot; at this time of the news report , I would probably look very anx@@ ious while I see through a stack of Bos@@ sa Nova comp@@ il@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; Jon@@ ny , 42 , who works at Sounds of the Universe ( Number of data : three men of middle age ) , has noticed a &quot; trop@@ hic aspect &quot; of the revival . &quot;
&quot; someone came here recently and said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t have a turn@@ table , but I would like to buy a Radi@@ oh@@ ead LP , so that I can put them into a shelf &quot; , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; this is not a big percentage , but it definitely happens . &quot;
&quot; more product @-@ las@@ ered , less musical . &quot;
&quot; we have people who say , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t have a turn@@ table . &quot;
&quot; these are younger people , not older , who only slowly cle@@ ave . &quot;
&quot; F@@ opp , which has devoted the vinyl records almost a whole floor , has a b@@ lower audience when I am going to clean . &quot;
&quot; there are couples around the 70 , tourists who make photos , teenagers and women middle age . &quot;
&quot; even though the atmosphere is somewhat less relaxed than in the above @-@ mentioned shops , wild beasts latest syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ er- and sex @-@ packed pop in place of the speakers - is good to see such diversity among customers . &quot;
&quot; no one of them looks lon@@ ely lon@@ ely , but nag@@ ging psychological trau@@ mas are hard to find when standing next to someone 30 seconds . &quot;
&quot; E@@ lan@@ ora , 27 , has been running around for a few minutes and looks at the variety of panels for sale . &quot;
it rather makes a window man@@ ne@@ quin than a big shopping .
&quot; it does not deserve much , so collecting plates is not a real option , says it . &quot;
it costs a lot .
&quot; it is easy to listen to music from a computer or in other ways , but the beauty of records is ... &quot; it drives off with a de@@ ar@@ est sig@@ h . &quot;
I don &apos;t know how to explain it - it really is unique .
my last stop is a business that is said to have inspired a new generation of record lovers : urban Out@@ fit@@ ters .
&quot; while I seem to watch the jeans hot pants , I watch a group of young teen@@ age girls who are group@@ ing for a moment around Pol@@ aro@@ id cameras before a father and his daughter are thinking about buying a Cros@@ ley record player . &quot;
&quot; on the left there is a staircase , a wall full of plates from Adel@@ e , Jeff Buck@@ ley , A@@ my Win@@ ehouse and Fle@@ et@@ wood Mac : a mixture of contemporary music and classics , the essential plates for an average collection . &quot;
&quot; nobody sees them - perhaps because they are only purely decorative , some so far above that it is impossible to touch them . &quot;
it is pure &quot; record art . &quot;
&quot; but considering that any attraction for these objects could mean more money for the industry and could send some customers to the depths of Soh@@ os for more , there is nothing to compl@@ ain . &quot;
&quot; it is no surprise that a population group , which has more time and money than others , is also the one that is most suitable for luxury items like plates . &quot;
&quot; even if my research shows that the results of You@@ Go@@ v agree , they leave , at least in record stores in Soh@@ o , the large number of female collectors and record @-@ lovers that exist in reality , record stores and online forums . &quot;
these people probably work hard at school or in offices .
&quot; they spend their Thursday morning with security not with the bum@@ ble through record stores of Ber@@ wick Street and the leaves through records , while they avoid the star@@ ving look of an unc@@ anny , 30 @-@ year @-@ old false moder@@ ator who rag@@ ed nothing of the middle aged over the shoulders . &quot;

French court re@@ jects offer on demo@@ li@@ tion of stores in the refugee camp
&quot; a French court rejected an offer of authorities in Cal@@ ais , dozens of temporary shops and restaurants in the jungle of Cal@@ ais , in which thousands of refugees live . &quot;
&quot; in case of a trial hearing this week the authorities in Cal@@ ais argu@@ ed that the state should be authorised to sell 72 temporary businesses , selling hair@@ dressing services , or sell tea for 50 c@@ ents ( 40 p@@ ence ) or simple meals for a few euros in provis@@ ional restaurants . &quot;
&quot; the Cal@@ ais pre@@ f@@ ecture argu@@ ed that these places were supposed to be torn down because they would represent a parallel economy , from which no taxes were paid , and the risk of fire and san@@ ity . &quot;
&quot; humanitarian groups divided the court that the shops and restaurants are important , as the free meals offered by the state supported association and other groups cannot provide enough food for the growing numbers in the camp . &quot;
they also realized that the temporary shops and restaurants often offer accommodation and free meals for people in need .
&quot; a court in L@@ ille decided that there would be no legal basis for the deport@@ ation of people who operate the 72 provis@@ ional businesses , but granted that the concerns of the pre@@ f@@ ecture of Cal@@ ais are absolutely understandable . &quot;
&quot; the judge Jean @-@ François M@@ oll@@ a said that the grocery stores , cafes and restaurants would play a much larger role than just people who live in extremely prec@@ ari@@ ous conditions . &quot;
he said that the areas offer quiet re@@ union between refugees and volunteers .
&quot; one of the places threatened by tear@@ ing was the Jung@@ le Book Kids &apos; Café of the camp , which is operated as a non @-@ profit and 200 meals a day , English and French classes as well as a consultation on asylum cases for the hundreds of vulnerable , un@@ accompanied min@@ ors in the camp . &quot;
more than 170@@ .000 people signed the petition to preserve the Kids &apos; Café .
&quot; in a letter to the Guardian , it was said that &quot; closure &quot; would be a catastrophe for these children , of which the youngest are eight years old . &quot;
&quot; the two aid organisations Help Refu@@ ge@@ es and L &apos;@@ Au@@ berge des Mig@@ rants estimated on Friday that the number of people in the Dsch@@ ung@@ ell@@ ager climb@@ ed over 9,@@ 000 people - the highest number until now - after a steep increase of new arri@@ vals in the course of summer . &quot;
despite Olympia @-@ dis@@ appointment : Martin is fighting for war

he did not have an explanation for his mis@@ erable twel@@ fth place at the sugar lo@@ af .
&quot; I hon@@ estly said it &apos;s hard to comment on the time of yesterday , &quot; said Martin . &quot;

here comes the En@@ forcement Trailer
&quot; Germany &apos;s law@@ ns must adapt to the next generation speed monitor : in different federal states , among other things in H@@ esse and Brandenburg , new flash devices are tested , which should be particularly effective . &quot;
the fut@@ uris@@ tically acting rein@@ forcement trailer of the company Vit@@ ronic from Wiesbaden can be used for example at accident areas where it would be dangerous for a mobile measurement by the police .
&quot; for example , on highway construction sites or to re@@ alizing bridges with temporary lum@@ ber , there is often no necessary infrastructure to provide there with a stationary bl@@ itzer for compliance with speed limit . &quot;
&quot; however , a long @-@ lasting mobile construction can be too dangerous or costly . &quot;
&quot; the rein@@ forcement trailer is self @-@ sufficient : its battery lasts five days with continuous measurement operations , the case data are transmitted encrypted via a modem . &quot;
&quot; with laser technology , all vehicles can also be recorded across multiple tracks simultaneously . &quot;
&quot; variable speed limits as well as access messages by time , travel strips and vehicle class can also be monitored . &quot;
&quot; in the advanced state , one can move the trailer according to the manufacturer with each car with trailer hit@@ ch . &quot;
&quot; in order that it is not easy to use , it is lo@@ wered in the measuring mode so that the wheels in the arm@@ oured and by the way also disappear into a safe outer shell . &quot;
&quot; in addition , a built @-@ in alarm system should protect the bl@@ itzer from v@@ and@@ alism . &quot;
&quot; since 2015 , the trailer has been tested according to Vit@@ ronic in different federal states and has now also been used . &quot;
&quot; foreign authorities also flas@@ hed with the new technique : recently , France has ordered 100 pieces following an order of 150 items last year . &quot;
Britain pic@@ ks Silver in the 7 @-@ way Rugby after Fi@@ ji Master@@ class Gold gets fet@@ ched
the impressive performance of Britain at 7 @-@ er Rugby came to the final on Thursday evening to a ab@@ rupt stop at the last hur@@ dle in the form of the Fi@@ j@@ is when they were beaten with a result of 43 @-@ 7 at the De@@ od@@ oro Stadium here in Rio .
&quot; Fi@@ ji distributed a class class in handling , side @-@ step@@ ping , post @-@ back , line run and raw power to win gold - their first Olympic med@@ aille of any color . &quot;
&quot; the defeat was missed by the not too bad price of silver medal - Britain &apos;s fourth on this day - and they could be proud of their efforts in this tournament , in which they struck New Zealand , Argentina and South Africa . &quot;
&quot; the clear defeat of the Bo@@ ks , 7 @-@ 5 in the semi@@ fin@@ als on the same day could fall back to them in the final . &quot;
&quot; but regardless of this , Fi@@ ji would have defeated a 15 @-@ man team at this form . &quot;
&quot; it could be a con@@ sol@@ ation for the UK - but will probably not - that at least a Br@@ ite tomorrow will have a gold medal for his neck : Fi@@ j@@ is head trainer Ben Ryan , the former head of England from Wim@@ ble@@ don . &quot;
GB had a difficult path behind him .
&quot; eight years ago , she lost each game at Adel@@ ai@@ de Sev@@ ens . &quot;
here they lost only one .
&quot; this fla@@ p will hurt , but progress is amazing . &quot;
Fi@@ ji began mir@@ acul@@ ously and dismis@@ sed the attacks of GB@@ s out of fun .
&quot; it felt for the captain Tom Mit@@ ch@@ ell to and Co. , as if one would run in dri@@ fting buses . the World Series winners went 5 @-@ 0 upwards , when O@@ sea Kol@@ in@@ is@@ au was over in the corner . &quot;
&quot; with four minutes of playing time , J@@ erry Tu@@ wa@@ i added another attack from the right corner he walked . &quot;
12 @-@ 0 and GB hardly touched the ball .
&quot; a rag@@ ing T@@ ackle of Mit@@ ch@@ ell stopped the mountain of Mann Leone Nak@@ ar@@ awa a third goal , but it has only stopped Fi@@ ji . &quot;
&quot; in the seventh minute , j@@ asa Ver@@ em@@ alu@@ a l@@ ete a touch down in the right corner and it stood 0 @-@ 17 for GB . &quot;
Nak@@ ar@@ awa added a new one since the re @-@ fi@@ ff@@ ff and there was still over a minute of playing time ... in the first half .
V@@ atem@@ o Rav@@ ou@@ vo@@ u pres@@ ided by further weak tac@@ kl@@ ings of the GB team and stor@@ med up to the line to make a gate .
the conversion brought a 29 @-@ 0 to the break .
&quot; it &apos;s like Fi@@ ji was born to play the 7 , while GB was still se@@ eded . &quot;
this is how it is .
&quot; GB conducted fundamental changes in half @-@ time and closed the fi@@ ji@@ an gap ... for whole four minutes , which was good for the conditions of the first half @-@ time until Joshua Tu@@ is@@ ova went through a brilliant interim play of Fi@@ ji . &quot;
&quot; Dan Nor@@ ton started an attempt for GB , made a touch@@ down in the left corner for a 36 @-@ 7 , but the game had long been running for the South se@@ ein@@ ate whose fans che@@ eks , flags and d@@ anced on the tri@@ b@@ une . &quot;
it was not difficult to admire the playful approach Fi@@ j@@ is .
Mat@@ a Vi@@ li@@ ame set the icing on the cake with another attempt in the last seconds .
the fi@@ ff@@ ff rang the fi@@ j@@ is embrac@@ ed and GB k@@ ick@@ ed devast@@ ating in the grass .
&quot; earlier on the day , Fi@@ ji Japan defeated Japan in the semi@@ fin@@ als with 20 @-@ 5 and Great Britain pressed South Africa in a short @-@ fin@@ alist match from the race - Great Britain &apos;s conversion of the difference . &quot;
&quot; K@@ yle Brown brought the Bo@@ ks in the first half to the front , but Dan Nor@@ ton broke the line with an impressive foot@@ work and sc@@ ored a gate under the posts in the second half . &quot;
&quot; a brilliant late tac@@ kling by Marcus Wat@@ son , the brother of Anthony of the English 15 @-@ A@@ side team , secured the win - and thus the silver medal . &quot;
Helen Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning inspired by fighting with the cancer of the trainer for rowing
there will be no more emot@@ ive gold than with these games and that wants to be hot .
&quot; from the first stroke to the last , 220 tough h@@ ieve going into history , Helen Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning found an extra importance in her golden moment at Est@@ acio da Lag@@ oa . &quot;
&quot; even though there were only the examples that were sitting at the helm , there were three voices in the boat . &quot;
&quot; their domin@@ ance was absolutely , after all , their 39.@@ an un@@ conf@@ isc@@ ated bet , which is also unprecedented . &quot;
&quot; what we see are two brilliant athletes , who gli@@ de across the surface with the elegance of sw@@ ans , which does not reflect the type of triumph . &quot;
&quot; behind every gold in the rowing there is a batt@@ ali@@ on to willing hel@@ pers who contribute to the incre@@ mental advances that make the difference and it was no more than a coach , who would not survive this day at all when diagnosed with him . &quot;
he said he was ris@@ ky .
I had bladder cancer that is oper@@ able and that did it .
&quot; if you do not do that , it spreads everywhere . &quot;
it would have been a rather bad situation .
it changes a little the view .
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013 .
&quot; the trio had good luck that he could start the beginning of 2014 , out of the season , which stopped the inter@@ ruption to a minimum , in case that under such circumstances is the right term . &quot;
&quot; I needed money , so I had to go better soon . &quot;
it was an incen@@ tive .
&quot; I was in the hospital and ran around on the station - 20 feet , 30 feet , 50 feet at a time when they said that some steps would suff@@ ice . &quot;
this is how it begins .
&quot; rowing in itself is already a challenge , but that makes it even bigger . &quot;
&quot; in the immedi@@ acy of victory , their first thoughts came to Williams , who spent a ven@@ ven@@ ous morning doing something more than usual , trying to process his own fears . &quot;
&quot; St@@ anning , who was a captain in the Royal Arti@@ llery reg@@ iment in a deployment in Afghanistan , said &quot; I was an emotional w@@ reck this week . this is perhaps a bit extreme , but it means so much . &quot;
&quot; it repe@@ ats only how much I mean , how much I and Helen and also Robin worked . &quot;
there were three fantastic years with Helen and Robin .
&quot; without Robin we would be no one , so a massive thank you to him . he is the best trainer in the world . &quot;
I wouldn &apos;t have wished for a better person for a trainer or a better coach .
Helena Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning lost no race during the last five years .
the couple had a hard rhythm with which their opponents could not keep up .
&quot; even in the last 500 meters , when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark began to stop , St@@ anning and Glo@@ ver had a lot in reserve . &quot;
we were very im@@ pris@@ oned at the moment .
&quot; Helen called &quot; lead in the process , ble@@ b in the process . &quot;
it is really important not to let yourself rip .
we had a good start and at the same time we were not looking to make something rab@@ bit .
&quot; we didn &apos;t want a fire@@ works today , we just wanted to achieve a good result , go out and win the race we did . &quot;
the couple will take a break for one year before making decisions about his future .
&quot; glo@@ ver must appear next week on a wedding , their own with the TV adv@@ entur@@ er Steve Back@@ shall . &quot;
now she wants to enjoy the moment .
I didn &apos;t want to say that this was my last race .
that would have been too much pressure .
it took about six months in London to understand that I am an Olympic champion .
it was all so new for me and I was so stressed .
it took about four minutes .
&quot; this feels so much better , &quot; she said . &quot;
for 31 years exemplary for clarity
&quot; the Managing Director of the V@@ eit@@ enst@@ ein@@ gruppe &quot; &quot; V@@ eit@@ enst@@ ein@@ gruppe &quot; , &quot; Rup@@ pert G@@ öller , will reti@@ re . &quot;
the association is regarded as &quot; bay@@ ern@@ wide exemplary . &quot;
a small Fran@@ con@@ ian drinking water @-@ purpose association as a model for the large water producers .
so it was a time ago in the origin@@ alt@@ on in a contribution of Bay@@ er@@ ischer Rund@@ funk .
&quot; little later , the water forum of the Government of Unter@@ fran@@ ken paid the purpose of the association . &quot;
&quot; the work of the V@@ eit@@ emeyer group was &quot; &quot; bay@@ ern@@ wide as exemplary . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; behind all this Ru@@ pert G@@ öller , who was 31 years in the association of employees , stands for 28 years as managing director . &quot;
now he was retired at the age of 65 .
&quot; the drinking water @-@ purpose association of the V@@ eit@@ a Group , based in Kot@@ ten@@ dorf , municipality of Breit@@ brunn , supports around 15@@ 0000 cubic meters of water every year and supplies 32 locations and ham@@ lets with approximately 5@@ 500 inhabitants . &quot;
&quot; member municipalities are the municipalities of Kirch@@ ner , Breit@@ brunn , Lau@@ ter , E@@ bel@@ sbach and the city of Ba@@ un@@ ah . &quot;
there are water supply contracts for other cities and municipalities .
&quot; the current chairman , Breit@@ brun@@ ns Bürger@@ meister@@ in Ger@@ tru@@ d Büh@@ l ( F@@ W ) , rec@@ alled that Ru@@ pert G@@ öller was appointed as a water@@ keeper in 1985 and was appointed Managing Director of the Zw@@ eck@@ verband in 1988 . &quot;
&quot; his tasks have been very diverse and they extended from water @-@ line construction and maintenance work on office and organizational activities , the budget planning , calculation of fees and contributions to emergency interventions at weekends , &quot; said the chairman . &quot;
&quot; as an outstanding event , it called the start @-@ up and inaugur@@ ation of the new foun@@ tains ( 1994 ) , land purchases in the area of the new foun@@ tains ( 1998 ) , the renovation of the high @-@ tank ( 1999 ) , the re @-@ purchase of a central computer control ( 2004 ) and the replacement of water pipes . &quot;
&quot; there was no stand@@ still , and there are always new additions , because water li@@ que@@ fied and drinking water is the most important food . &quot;
&quot; in her lau@@ dation she praised Gö@@ ll@@ ers , faithful and correct service over the age of 31 . &quot;
&quot; he has used a lot of heart blood for his water @-@ purpose association , and he has lived on the water @-@ purpose association , as if it were his own company . &quot;
&quot; a few weeks ago , he was a real practitioner to present the success concept of the V@@ eit@@ enst@@ ein@@ gruppe for nit@@ rate reduction in front of the water forum of the Unter@@ fran@@ ken district . &quot;
for this he received a great deal of recognition and praise .
Ru@@ pert G@@ öller works on the one hand praised water@@ wart Al@@ f@@ ons G@@ rie@@ bel who worked with him for 28 years .
he is the best water @-@ keeper and he was a faithful servant .
together we were an unbe@@ atable team .
&quot; as a highlight from his point of view , he described the well @-@ being and the restructuring of the purpose association . &quot;
&quot; however , the biggest challenge and the most difficult use were the pi@@ ping at the high tank at Kirch@@ ner on a 3rd of January . &quot;
here we had to work at minus 17 degrees the whole night so that the villages could be supplied with water .
&quot; even the supply of Neu@@ brunn can only be maintained , because one filled the high @-@ tank of P@@ ett@@ stadt with hoses . &quot;
the management of the drinking water @-@ purpose association was handed over to Daniel Stür@@ mer from Lau@@ ter who will follow the succession of Ru@@ pert G@@ öller .

relationship at Bar@@ g@@ t@@ eh@@ ei@@ de - man sho@@ ots at risk of life
a 35 @-@ year @-@ old man had shot at his partner in Bar@@ g@@ t@@ eh@@ ei@@ de ( district Stor@@ mar@@ n ) on Friday at 10.@@ 45 o &apos;clock in a multi @-@ family house .
&quot; the man has called upon us and stated to have shot his partner &apos;s partner , &quot; &quot; said a police spokes@@ woman . &quot;
&quot; the perpet@@ r@@ ator shall be on the flight , after him shall be openly punished . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile nation@@ wide , because Sven S. could be on the road by car . &quot;
&quot; the man is about 1.80 m tall , mus@@ cular , brown @-@ fired and has a gl@@ at@@ ze . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , the police have published a photo of him . &quot;
but it is a few years old .
&quot; in the meantime , the man carries a gl@@ atter . &quot;
the man should not be addressed directly .
&quot; he could still carry the gun with him , so the police . &quot;
who sees Sven S. is to call the 110 .
the police talks about a &quot; relationship . &quot;
&quot; the victim was born in 1988 , the perpet@@ r@@ ator 1981 . &quot;
&quot; the police in Lü@@ beck wanted to make no information about the di@@ version or the relationship between perpet@@ rators and victims , but confirmed that a man had been killed . &quot;
&quot; it is a killing deli@@ kt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we don &apos;t say more at this time , &quot; &quot; said a police spokes@@ person in Lü@@ beck . &quot;
&quot; according to e@@ ye@@ witnesses , a special command mand@@ o ( SEK ) was at the crime scene . &quot;
steel - Light view for German steel industry
the scratch @-@ packed and energy @-@ intensive German steel industry remains spar@@ ed by additional costs in millions of millions .
financial bur@@ dens that threatened the industry from green electricity subsidies are from the table .
&quot; it remains in the liberation of the renew@@ ables in@@ lay in the existing plants for the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; power production in the German steel industry &quot; , &quot; said German Federal Minister of Economic Affairs , Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) of the &quot; &quot; West@@ deutsche Allgemeine Zeitung &quot; &quot; ( WA@@ Z , Fri@@ day@@ Edition ) . &quot;
I am really glad that we could finally reach the tough negotiations after two years .
&quot; the European Commission therefore initially planned to use the steel producers , the gases coming from the blast furnace to generate electricity for their own consumption , to request the cas@@ hier . &quot;
&quot; according to the German industry association , the steel industry has threatened additional costs of 120 to 240 million euros per year according to the German industry association . &quot;
&quot; Gabriel said the WA@@ Z , there is now a certificate with the European Commission for talks with Commissioner Mar@@ gre@@ the V@@ est@@ ager . &quot;
&quot; only when the generators are replaced in the steel works , an E@@ EG lev@@ y is 20 percent . &quot;
but this will not be raised in the steel industry .
IG Metall welcomed Germany &apos;s agreement with the European Commission for power production .
&quot; in this way , the status quo of the previous regulation is largely written . &quot;
the successful efforts of Gabriel for the steel industry have special significance .
&quot; with regard to our campaign &apos; Steel is future &apos; , this is a first step . &quot;
&quot; others have to follow . &quot;
&quot; even in the reform of emissions legislation , climate and employment targets are weak@@ ened , &quot; explained IG Metall @-@ Chef Jörg Hof@@ mann in Frankfurt . &quot;
the steel industry in Europe has been suffering from over@@ capacity and considerable price pressure since the financial crisis in 2008 .
&quot; last year , the situation further intensi@@ fied when the world &apos;s largest producer in China threw massive steel on the world market in view of the weak@@ ening domestic demand . &quot;
European manufacturers throw off Chinese steel companies price dump@@ ing .
&quot; in the course of this spring , the situation has been somewhat relaxed . &quot;
&quot; on the one hand , a suspended import tari@@ ff on im@@ porting steel effects , on the other hand the economic prospects in China have emerged . &quot;
it is uncle@@ ar how sustainable the price collection is .
the German industry pri@@ mus Th@@ ys@@ sen@@ k@@ rupp was cau@@ tious on Thursday .
&quot; last but not least , the prices would have been more stagn@@ ating . &quot;
the industry respon@@ ds to the difficult situation with further cost reduc@@ tions .
Th@@ ys@@ sen@@ K@@ rupp recently didn &apos;t want to exclude the closing of individual works .
&quot; in the German steel industry , around 86@@ 000 people were employed at the end of 2015 . &quot;
&quot; in July , the German steel producers remain careful despite rising prices and increasing orders . &quot;
&quot; with 3.4 million tons it produced a good six percent less rough steel than in the previous year , as the economic unification of steel shared on Friday . &quot;
&quot; after a short increase in May , the set quantity went back to the second month in a row . &quot;
&quot; since the beginning of the year , production has risen by two percent below the previous year &apos;s figure . &quot;
&quot; in the coming months , the association expects an improved order situation with a rising output . &quot;
&quot; community , mind , health : singing does sen@@ iors good &quot;
&quot; singing has accompanied Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp already her whole life : as a young girl she was in the school choir , in teacher &apos;s studies she occupied the subject of music , and today the 78 @-@ year @-@ old sings in a sen@@ iors choir . &quot;
&quot; singing moves me - emotional and physical , &quot; she describes . &quot;
&quot; after a rehear@@ sal , she feels balanced , cheer@@ ful and overall alive , she says . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , she does something good for her health and spirit . &quot;
&quot; because singing is a great hobby for sen@@ iors from several perspectives , says Er@@ hard H@@ ac@@ kler from the German senior league . &quot;
&quot; most sen@@ iors sing in the choir and share with like @-@ minded the joy of music , describes H@@ ac@@ kler . &quot;
regular interaction enables sen@@ iors to soci@@ alize and maintain social contacts .
&quot; social and family structures often come from age , a choir is then an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people . &quot;
this experience has also made Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp in her choir : &quot; to speak and organize to be able to rely on the others and to learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of being together .
&quot; singing can be exhau@@ sting in a positive sense , says H@@ ac@@ kler . &quot;
the sen@@ iors train a deep and controlled respir@@ ation .
those who regularly request his lungs are not so fast from the pu@@ ff in everyday life .
&quot; even when it comes to receiving the sound of the voice at age , singing is an optimal hobby . &quot;
&quot; for older people , S@@ ingen often has a very special effect , says Ursula L@@ enz from the Federal Labour Community of Senior Ci@@ tizens . &quot;
&quot; in the older generations the common singing had a much higher priority , it belonged to everyday life , both in school and leisure time , she explains . &quot;
&quot; L@@ enz often ob@@ serves that singing or hearing of songs in elderly people ar@@ ouses many memories , often combined with positive feelings of her youth @-@ time . &quot;
&quot; with lyrics and especially melodies , even demen@@ tia distur@@ bs themselves for long past events . &quot;
&quot; in singing , the head also demands special power , explains L@@ enz . &quot;
at the same time focus on your own voice and on a given rhythm and adapt to the other singers - this is a great cognitive challenge .
&quot; even older people , who live alone , practice not only to concentrate on themselves . &quot;
&quot; another positive aspect is the recognition you experience through singing in the choir , says H@@ ac@@ kler . &quot;
an enthusiastic audience is a great praise .
the self @-@ este@@ em also grows through singing in the choir .
&quot; to show oneself : if I take long for something , I will better and grow up beyond me - this experience strengthens . &quot;
&quot; good reasons to start singing , so there is enough . &quot;
&quot; who wants to try a new hobby should not hesitate , even if he means having little talent , says L@@ enz . &quot;
&quot; you don &apos;t sing alone - with 50 singing people , who already hear when a sound is next to it ? &quot;
&quot; looking for the right offer , sen@@ iors have different possibilities , says H@@ ac@@ kler . &quot;
&quot; if someone comes from the circle of acquaint@@ ances in a senior choir , one can simply join . &quot;
many cities also offer views over the choirs in the surroundings .
those who want to sing in a church choir can contact the church or the Church leader directly .
many senior choirs can also be found on the Internet .
&quot; if you don &apos;t have access to the Internet , the family , friends or neighbours can ask for help with internet research . &quot;
&quot; if you want to sing , one should necessarily join a choir , advis@@ es H@@ ac@@ kler . &quot;
singing does the soul well and has something liber@@ ating - that is true for all ages .
cats react sensi@@ tively as males at scre@@ ams of young animals
bi@@ ologists have studied in Hanover which effect has the reputation of fel@@ lows on adult animals .
&quot; to her surprise , the males did not leave the males cold - however , they always kept themselves the same in contrast to the females . &quot;
female cats can recognize the degree of arous@@ al of k@@ itt@@ ens on the mi@@ str@@ ust of the babies .
&quot; they react by ten percent faster to sounds of k@@ itt@@ ens , who have found themselves in great need , as scientists from the veter@@ inary university and the Medizinische Hochschule Hannover ( M@@ HH ) found out . &quot;
&quot; males react also to the calls of k@@ itt@@ ens - however , always the same . &quot;
&quot; obviously , the acoustic differences between the mi@@ str@@ ust of less and strong arous@@ ed juven@@ iles for the males either not percep@@ tible or not of importance , &quot; &quot; said the Biolog@@ in Wi@@ eb@@ ke Kon@@ er@@ ding from the M@@ HH . &quot;
it is the first author of the study published on this Friday in the specialist magazine &quot; BM@@ C Evol@@ ution@@ ary Biology . &quot;
&quot; in a previous investigation , the research team had already found out that the duration and pitch of the k@@ itt@@ ens @-@ cri@@ es differs with the ur@@ gency of their need@@ iness . &quot;
a total of nine adult males and eight females were observed from the animal hus@@ band@@ ry of the M@@ HH .
&quot; they were played for a cri@@ b of small ones , taken from the litter box for three minutes and separated from mother and si@@ bl@@ ings . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , they were confronted with scre@@ ams of more excited k@@ itt@@ ens , which were additionally raised . &quot;
the researchers keep their results in spite of the small sample for meaningful results .
&quot; all females , even those who have not yet own offspring , re@@ acted differentiated onto the scre@@ ams , &quot; said Kon@@ er@@ ding . &quot;
&quot; they turned faster to the speaker , when this rep@@ ul@@ sion of the very rainy k@@ itt@@ ens played . &quot;
this ability may possibly be con@@ genital or develop@@ ped with the sex@@ ually mature .
&quot; one surprise was that the males had re@@ acted at all , &quot; &quot; said the bi@@ ologist . &quot;
&quot; in the past , scientists have already studied the reactions of women and men on baby sounds . &quot;
&quot; some studies also showed that women were more sensitive to inf@@ ants , whether they were mothers or not , the Biolog@@ in Marina Sche@@ um@@ ann reported . &quot;
Po@@ dol@@ ski attacks with &quot; Gala &quot; after Super@@ cup
Hak@@ an Sü@@ kis@@ r is a football legend in Turkey .
&quot; in Turkey , an arrest warran@@ t has been issued against the former football star Hak@@ an Sü@@ kü@@ r . &quot;
he is accused of being a member of a terrorist group .
&quot; for the first time after the coup attempt , Turkey will again take place in Turkey . &quot;
&quot; before the du@@ el of the Arch@@ ri@@ val between Bes@@ ik@@ tas Istanbul and Lukas Po@@ dol@@ sky Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay Istanbul around the Super@@ cup in Kon@@ ya , the official line is clear : &quot; &quot; business as usual &quot; &quot; is announced . &quot;
&quot; the government , the daily routine of normal citizens should not be affected by the failure of the state of emergency after the fall arrest in July . &quot;
&quot; however , this does not apply to those who are suspected of being responsible for the movement of the pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , which is responsible for the coup attempt . &quot;
&quot; in addition , there is no halt before football . &quot;
&quot; against the earlier Star@@ k@@ icker Hak@@ an Sü@@ kis@@ r , the public prosec@@ utor asked an arrest warran@@ t . &quot;
&quot; accordingly , the South East has now been accused of being a member of a terrorist group in America . &quot;
Sü@@ kis@@ r should be supporters of the Pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len who is responsible for the coup attempt by President Rec@@ ep Tay@@ y@@ ip Erd@@ og@@ an .
&quot; although the state of exception is still valid for 90 days , the state of exception still applies until October , in fact that on the lives of most Tur@@ ks , however , has no effect on the lives of most Tur@@ ks . &quot;
&quot; the no@@ c@@ turn@@ al &quot; &quot; democracy @-@ guards &quot; &quot; in public places throughout the country has declared Erd@@ og@@ an ended on Wednesday . &quot;
the sport is - like the whole country - split into supporters and opponents of Erd@@ og@@ gans .
especially fans of the Workers &apos; Club Bes@@ ik@@ tas are traditionally not among the friends of the president .
&quot; but in the face of dramatic experiences in history , the harsh rejection of military put@@ ties . &quot;
even the fans agree - no matter if their heart beats for Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay or Bes@@ ik@@ tas .
&quot; at Po@@ kal@@ si@@ eger &quot; g@@ ala , &quot; it will especially arrive at Lukas Po@@ dol@@ ski . &quot;
&quot; the Cologne in the past season proved its sporty value : with 17 gates and nine templates in all competitions , the 31 @-@ year @-@ old ended his first playing time as Top@@ sc@@ orer of his association . &quot;
in the final game against F@@ ener@@ b@@ ah@@ ce he achieved the 1 : 0 victory .
the newspaper &quot; F@@ AN@@ AT@@ IK &quot; che@@ ered him : &quot; he was the best in the place . &quot;
he finished the season in an excellent way and secured the tro@@ phy to his team .
&quot; thanks to &quot; Pol@@ di , &quot; the dis@@ ap@@ pointing season for the record master found a con@@ cili@@ atory conclusion . &quot;
&quot; after the pre @-@ round K.@@ O in the Champions League , the &quot; lions &quot; turn out early in the Europe League . &quot;
&quot; in the Southern Li@@ g , there was only sixth place . &quot;
the season was not good .
the tro@@ phy was the only way to win something .
&quot; this is what we have done and that is the most important thing , &quot; said Po@@ dol@@ ski . &quot;
&quot; for Master Bes@@ ik@@ tas , the game year was better . &quot;
&quot; thanks to Mario Gom@@ ez , who finished with 26 seasonal buff@@ ers as Sü@@ per @-@ Li@@ g @-@ Tor@@ rema@@ enk@@ ö@@ nig the basis for the 14th title . &quot;
this is also the reason that the fans will continue to hope for the return of the 31 year old .
&quot; in doing so , at the AC Florence under contract and on Bes@@ ik@@ tas , the Gom@@ ez showed only bor@@ row@@ ed after the attempt of put@@ sch@@ ism because of the political situation in the country after its EM holiday . &quot;
&quot; if Mario wants to come to us , he only has to say , &quot; &quot; quoted the specialist magazine &quot; &quot; K@@ icker &quot; &quot; Club@@ chef F@@ ik@@ ret Or@@ man . &quot;
&quot; however , the stor@@ mer would have to be willing to reno@@ unce around a third of his annual yield to 7.5 million Euros , Or@@ man was clear : &quot; we cannot pay his sal@@ ary in Florence . &quot;
despite D@@ oping : these athletes still have medals at Olympia in Rio
the 34 @-@ year @-@ old Jus@@ tin Gat@@ lin was locked twice due to D@@ op@@ ings ( 2001 and 2006 ) .
Rio de Janeiro - W@@ hist@@ le@@ blo@@ wer@@ in Julia Step@@ an@@ owa is not allowed to start in Rio .
other over@@ took athle@@ tics sinners can only laugh about it - they fight in Rio for medals .
the topic of dop@@ ing is still the head@@ lines at the Rio Olympics in Rio .
&quot; the Russian swi@@ mmer Juli@@ ja J@@ ef@@ im@@ ova , who had lam@@ ented her starting right after a dop@@ ing lock , was mer@@ cil@@ ess@@ ly pl@@ agu@@ ed and bu@@ sted with her start ( 100 meter breast ) . &quot;
it offered a bizar@@ re scenery : with a super@@ imposed smile she was still lying in the hall and prov@@ oked it with her appearance .
&quot; when it was fixed that they won &apos;t get gold , the audience broke out into a jewel tower . &quot;
but there are many other sports@@ men who go to the start in spite of D@@ oping past at the Rio Olympics .
here is an overview :
&quot; Jus@@ tin Gat@@ lin ( 100 , 200 , 4x@@ 100 @-@ m @-@ relay / USA ) : the 34 @-@ year @-@ old belongs to the most controversial figures in athle@@ tics . &quot;
he was locked two times for dop@@ ing ( 2001 and 2006 until 2010 ) .
&quot; since his ban , the Olympic champion of 2004 and ex @-@ world champion is even faster than before , he is the number one in the world over 100 m in 9,@@ 80 seconds and is considered to be the biggest chall@@ enger of Us@@ ain Bol@@ t . &quot;
&quot; Shel@@ ly @-@ Ann Fr@@ aser @-@ Pr@@ yce ( 100 , 4x@@ 100 @-@ m @-@ Season / Jam@@ ai@@ ka ) : the two @-@ time Olympic champion and seven times world champion had to sit down a six @-@ month lock after you have been detected the intake of the pain using Ox@@ y@@ co@@ don . &quot;
&quot; after surgery , she had strong to@@ ot@@ ha@@ che , the 29 @-@ year @-@ old def@@ ended . &quot;
&quot; Sandra Per@@ ko@@ vic ( Disk@@ us / Croatia ) : 2011 the 2012 Olympic champion of 2012 , World Champion of 2013 and European Championship was tested positively on the bot@@ ul@@ ed stimul@@ ant agent Meth@@ yl@@ hex@@ an@@ amine from 2010 to 2016 . &quot;
Per@@ ko@@ vic denied the s@@ ne@@ sty intake and was closed for six months .
the four most wei@@ rd lit@@ ters this year go to the account of the big gold fav@@ ori@@ tin .
&quot; La@@ Sha@@ wn Mer@@ ritt ( 200 , 400 , 4x@@ 400 @-@ m @-@ relay / USA ) : the Beijing Olympic champion and two @-@ time world champion over 400 m , was positively tested in 2010 and had been locked for 21 months . &quot;
a means of penis enlargement is responsible for rep@@ ent mer@@ cen@@ sion .
&quot; this year , the 30 @-@ year @-@ old is over 200 and 400 m the fastest man in the world . &quot;
&quot; Ivan Ti@@ ch@@ on ( Hammer@@ wurf , Belarus ) : probably hardly any ath@@ l@@ ete had so many medals to be detected afterwards . &quot;
thus Ti@@ ch@@ on lost his World Cup title from 2005 nine years later after testosterone dop@@ ing was detected .
the meanwhile 40 @-@ year @-@ old had also had to give Olympia @-@ Silver 2004 because of ster@@ oid dop@@ ing and the EM title 2006 because of testosterone abuse .
the also recognized bronze medal of the 2008 Olympic Games was returned due to a judgement of the International Criminal Tribunal .
&quot; with 8@@ 0,@@ 04 m he is ranked in two of the world rank@@ ings . &quot;
&quot; Li@@ u Hong ( 20 km Walk , China ) : the world champion and gold fav@@ ori@@ tin was tested positive only in May , but may still start in Rio . &quot;
&quot; at the 29 @-@ year @-@ old world champion , hints were found on taking a banned food supplement , the lock of the world anti @-@ dop@@ ing agency WA@@ DA fell mild and ran already on July 13th . &quot;
bomb terror in Thailand - Öster@@ rei@@ cher@@ in injured - Sever@@ al dead
&quot; the Austrian Embassy in Thailand is in contact with the woman , the spokes@@ man of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , Thomas Schn@@ ö@@ ll , Friday morning . &quot;
&quot; she suffered from cuts and had been treated in the hospital , but I have already left it again . &quot;
she planned her home trip for the beginning of September .
&quot; whether from the further explo@@ sions on the holiday island Ph@@ u@@ ket as well as in the southern cities of Sur@@ at Th@@ ani , Ph@@ ang N@@ ga , Tran@@ g and Ch@@ om@@ p@@ he , Austrian citizens are also still uncle@@ ar . &quot;
&quot; the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is in constant contact with the local authorities , so Schn@@ ö@@ ll . &quot;
&quot; at about 200 kilometres south of the capital Bangkok , Hu@@ a H@@ in was initially explo@@ ded on Thursday evening in a h@@ ind@@ quarter of two bombs . &quot;
&quot; according to the police , a Thai people were killed and about 20 people were injured , including the Austri@@ ans , three Germans , three Dutch and three Itali@@ ans . &quot;
&quot; in the early morning , two explo@@ sives were once again high , and a further person was killed according to the authorities . &quot;
also from Ph@@ u@@ ket a bomb explosion was reported in the morning .
&quot; during the det@@ on@@ ation near the popular seaside resort of Pat@@ ong , a taxi driver was injured after police declar@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; in Sur@@ at Th@@ ani at the south @-@ east coast of the country , then another bomb explo@@ ded , which killed a municipal employee . &quot;
&quot; according to the authorities , the explo@@ sives had gone into the air in a flower bed in front of the prec@@ inct of the coastal police . &quot;
&quot; finally , even more det@@ on@@ ations in Ph@@ ang N@@ ga and Tran@@ g on the south @-@ west coast as well as in Ch@@ om@@ p@@ he on the south @-@ east coast called for several injured . &quot;
&quot; one should go from a connection to the explo@@ sions in Hu@@ a H@@ in , it was called it . &quot;
&quot; the bom@@ b@@ ings carry the same manuscript , &quot; said Ar@@ med Forces Dan@@ ai K@@ rit@@ meth@@ av@@ ee Fri@@ days early in front of journalists . &quot;
we assume that it is a co @-@ ordin@@ ated attack .
&quot; it is too early to express itself to possible motives - probably , however , about the actions of Muslim rebels . &quot;
&quot; Thai media also wanted to see a pattern , typical for the bom@@ b@@ ings of Muslim separ@@ ati@@ sts in the south of the country . &quot;
&quot; the Thai police , on the other hand , stated that the attacks were not in connection with the Islam@@ ist insur@@ gency movement or with international terrorism . &quot;
&quot; this is only local sab@@ ot@@ age limited to limited areas and provinces , &quot; &quot; said a spokes@@ man in Bangkok . &quot;
&quot; rather , one assumes that the bombs of opponents of the ruling military j@@ un@@ ta have been laid . &quot;
&quot; in recent days , the authorities would have kept secret references to im@@ min@@ ent attacks in the south of the country - however , they were not informed of the exact time and places . &quot;
still uncle@@ ar what group behind the attacks .
&quot; the police instruc@@ ted their officials throughout the country to strengthen security around important government buildings as well as airports , train stations , tourist attractions , restaurants and entertainment district . &quot;
&quot; in Thailand , there are always smaller bom@@ b@@ ings , but mostly they are not directed against tourists . &quot;
Hu@@ a H@@ in is a palace used over the years of Thailand &apos;s King B@@ hum@@ i@@ bol Adul@@ y@@ ade@@ j .
&quot; following the floo@@ ding bomb explo@@ sions , the Austrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs recommends its homepage to follow the instructions given by Thai security authorities . &quot;
&quot; high security risk ( security level 3 ) charges for the provinces Nar@@ ath@@ iw@@ at , Y@@ ala , P@@ att@@ ani and Son@@ gh@@ kl@@ a and Pre@@ ah V@@ ih@@ ear . &quot;
&quot; after disputes between security forces and Muslim populations , there will be no longer necessary journeys into these provinces . &quot;
increased security risk ( security level 2 ) suffered for the rest of the country .
the attacks on Thursday and Friday spent a few days after a controversial referendum on a Constitution elabor@@ ated by the military j@@ un@@ ta .
this gives great influence to the military in the coming years .
&quot; Jun@@ ta boss and Prime Minister Pra@@ y@@ ut Ch@@ an @-@ o @-@ cha said that bombs were an attempt to sti@@ ften chaos , while the country moves towards stability , an improvement of economic situation and tourism . &quot;
&quot; the military un@@ ta , which in 2014 had seized power after a phase of bloody tur@@ mo@@ il , keeps itself confident to have led the kingdom back to stability and order . &quot;
&quot; however , the military did not succeed in getting a grip on the rebel@@ lion of Muslim rebels in the extreme south of the country . &quot;
more than 6@@ 500 people have been killed in the conflict .
&quot; almost one year ago , in Bangkok , a stop on a popular Hind@@ u shr@@ ine was killed 20 people , most of them foreign tourists . &quot;
it was the bloo@@ dies@@ t attack on the recent history of the country .
the right &quot; I@@ den@@ tit@@ ular movement &quot; has come into the visor of the Federal Office for constitutional protection .
&quot; after several sover@@ eig@@ ns , the constitutional prot@@ ectors in the Con@@ federation have also placed the group under observation . &quot;
&quot; we see in the &apos; I@@ den@@ tit@@ ular movement &apos; clu@@ es for efforts against the liberal democratic constitution , &quot; said Constitutional Compl@@ et@@ ely Hans @-@ Georg Ma@@ ate of the German Press Agency in Berlin . &quot;
&quot; thus , immigrants Islamic faith or from the Middle East are diff@@ used in an extrem@@ ist manner . &quot;
that is why we observe the movement as well .
&quot; the &quot; I@@ den@@ tit@@ ular Movement &quot; is a group@@ ing with French roots , which has been active in Germany since 2012 . &quot;
&quot; it turns against &quot; &quot; Mul@@ tic@@ ult@@ i @-@ W@@ ahn &quot; , &quot; &quot; un@@ controlled mass immigration &quot; and the &quot; loss of one &apos;s own identity through alien@@ ation . &quot; &quot;
&quot; constitutional prot@@ ectors in nine states - Bremen , Bayern , Hessen , Berlin , Baden @-@ Württemberg , NRW , Lower Saxony , Saxony and Thuringia - watch the &quot; &quot; I@@ den@@ tit@@ ars &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Ma@@ ate said , his authority was closely coordinated with the sover@@ eig@@ ns in the decision . &quot;
&quot; groups such as the &apos; I@@ den@@ tit@@ ular movement &apos; try to pick up their target group , where it stands , &quot; &quot; said the Chief Prosec@@ utor . &quot;
&quot; generally , extre@@ mi@@ sts try to address them with y@@ outh@@ ful speech , often with p@@ opp@@ y music . &quot;
the perpet@@ ual Islam@@ ists as well as right @-@ wing extre@@ mi@@ sts .
this is not an advertising for your own cause .
propaganda is meant to attract people emotion@@ ally .
young people are especially sus@@ cep@@ tible .
this is dangerous .
&quot; last but not least , there were reports from several federal states about the contacts of the &quot; &quot; I@@ den@@ tit@@ ars &quot; &quot; to Af@@ D politicians . &quot;
&quot; Ma@@ ate said , he did not have any findings . &quot;
&quot; for the constitutional protection , possible contacts of this kind are only relevant to a certain point . &quot;
&quot; it depends on whether the respective party - in this case , the Af@@ D - by certain individuals who are extrem@@ ist , change their direction and thus becomes extrem@@ ist . &quot;
so the decisive factor is whether such individuals have an impact on the party .
this is not recogni@@ zable .
&quot; with a view of the significant increase of legitimate off@@ ences and attacks on asylum seek@@ ers and refugee accommodations , Ma@@ ate said he would not speak of new right terrorism in this context . &quot;
but in recent years we have found that there can be right @-@ wing structures .
there was the group &apos; Old School Society &apos; or the Free Group .
&quot; it may well be that other right @-@ wing groups or small groups are planning to plan attacks against asylum seek@@ ers , refugee shei@@ ms or attacks from other right @-@ wing extrem@@ ist motives . &quot;
but a nation@@ wide or Europe @-@ wide control of right @-@ wing terrorism is not recogni@@ zable .
the previous groups were born on the regional level or in social networks .
&quot; worried , Ma@@ ate insist@@ ed that many gri@@ ps went to the account of people who did not appear in the right scene before . &quot;
this is the wor@@ rying .
&quot; many of the suspic@@ ious attacks on asylum @-@ accommodations are not previously known as crimin@@ als , politically motivated crimin@@ als or supporters of the right scene . &quot;
&quot; so many people have committed crimes , which previously had nothing to do with right @-@ wing extre@@ mi@@ sts , who have perhaps been politically indiffer@@ ent or have elected CD@@ U , the SPD or the Left , which , however , have radic@@ alised themselves by right @-@ wing extre@@ mis@@ tic mood . &quot;
Rio 2016 : RO@@ BEL Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te becomes Inter@@ ne@@ th@@ it
&quot; not always , the Olymp@@ ians or world records determine the head@@ lines at the Olympic Games . &quot;
this shows the brave appearance of Ro@@ bel Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te during the Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro .
the Aqu@@ atics Center sw@@ am the slightly over@@ weight s@@ wimm@@ ers from Ethiopia so slowly that it was no longer seen in the TV pictures .
it simply disappeared - no matter how far the cut@@ out was selected .
&quot; in social networks , Hab@@ te became the viral inter@@ ne@@ th@@ ite . &quot;
&quot; in fact , the 24 @-@ year @-@ old ends with a gap of 48 seconds and finished the 59@@ th place of 59 star@@ ters . &quot;
but it was rather his not a spor@@ tive figure that attracted the attention of the international media .
why the 24 @-@ year @-@ old still particip@@ ates at the Olympic Games ?
the Ethiop@@ ian received a special starting right from the international swimming association .
this is distributed to make swimming in sub @-@ represented countries more well @-@ known .
&quot; since most athletes walk in Ethiopia , Hab@@ te just wanted to do something else . &quot;
preparation is all : RO@@ BEL Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te is ready for the big race .
quickly the first nick@@ names made the lap .
some media called him as &quot; Ro@@ bel of the W@@ al . &quot;
&quot; the English tab@@ lo@@ id sheet &quot; The Sun , &quot; with &quot; D@@ ad B@@ od &quot; made it funny . &quot;
&quot; his time , he only struck a minute and almost five seconds over the 100 meter fre@@ estyle , he played no role . &quot;
compar@@ isons with &quot; Eric the E@@ el &quot; were also drawn .
the run by Eric M@@ ous@@ sam@@ ban@@ i helped media attention at the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney .
&quot; unforgettable was the appearance of the A@@ qu@@ at@@ orial Guinea swimming pool , when he had to start over 100 metres of Fre@@ estyle in a run . &quot;
&quot; at that time , M@@ ous@@ sam@@ ban@@ i was fired at that time . &quot;
the 22 @-@ year @-@ old learned only eight months before the Olympics and had never completed a long distance before the competition .

Tru@@ mp does not look so tight
the Republi@@ can candidate Donald Tru@@ mp talks on an election campaign in Florida .
&quot; should it be nothing with the election to the US president , Donald Tru@@ mp already has an alternative video . &quot;
he then desc@@ ends into the holiday .
&quot; Donald Tru@@ mp loses the US presidential elections in November , if it doesn &apos;t matter : &quot; ultimately it will either fold , or I have a very nice , long holiday , &quot; &quot; said the candidate of the Republi@@ cans in a telephone interview with the US TV channel . &quot;
&quot; if it is not rich for him in the end because of political correctness , that is in order , Tru@@ mp said . &quot;
&quot; he called the US President Barack Obama and the candidate of the Democrats , Hill@@ ary Clinton , as the founder of the terrorist mili@@ tia Islamic State ( IS ) . &quot;
&quot; within his party , more and more resistance was formed . &quot;
post is entered into trade with electric transpor@@ ters
an electric vehicle for the Deutsche Post in action .
the interest of other companies in the vessel is obviously great .
the mail is planning to sell their electric vehicle Stre@@ et@@ Sco@@ oter too .
&quot; in short , the Group plans to start trading with the transpor@@ ter . &quot;
the mail aims to offer its electric transport from the next year on the free car market .
&quot; we want to go into the sale to third parties , &quot; said a post @-@ speaker on Friday . &quot;
&quot; for months , the company has been testing whether they are supplied by their self @-@ developed stre@@ et@@ sco@@ oter , with the letters and pack@@ ets to sell to other companies . &quot;

&quot; in the post @-@ owned factory , the company plans to build up to 10,000 cars per year and shift . &quot;
&quot; Ger@@ des announced that the Group wanted to significantly increase its fleet of electric cars , and in the long run a complete change@@ over to environmentally friendly vehicles in the long term . &quot;
&quot; we will make a very , very robust step towards 2020 , &quot; he said at the end of July . &quot;
I can imagine that we can change the entire fleet .

the Chairman of the Gf@@ K Supervisory Board Ar@@ no Mahl@@ ert already leaves the Supervisory Board effective September 12 .
&quot; as of September 1 , the leadership in the Management Board will take the current board member Gerhard Haus@@ ruck@@ inger as of September 1 , the company shared the company . &quot;
&quot; he shall officially assume the function of a &quot; &quot; Executive Officer &quot; &quot; until a successor for Hart@@ mann is found . &quot;
the company called &quot; differ@@ ing views &quot; for long @-@ term business policy .
details did not want to call a company spokes@@ man on Friday .
&quot; who will in future become the market research company , is still uncle@@ ar . &quot;
&quot; in investor @-@ circles , it was on Friday , in the shareholders , the dis@@ appointment of the continuing successes of the restructuring measures introduced years ago was great . &quot;
Mr. Hart@@ mann has been at the Gf@@ K tip since 2011 .
&quot; however , the fruits of restructuring have not yet to be seen after 5 years . &quot;
&quot; in view of the last bad Gf@@ K business figures , each shareholder will become rest@@ less at some point . &quot;
&quot; if that would be the case with BMW , that would also make the Qu@@ and@@ ts so , &quot; was it . &quot;
&quot; following set@@ backs in the previous quarters , the company could not stop its loss trip in the second quarter of 2016 . &quot;
&quot; with EUR 36@@ 1.2 million , sales rose by 6.1 percent below the comparable period of the previous year . &quot;
&quot; based on the first half @-@ year , sales of 7@@ 21.@@ 2 million euros shr@@ ink by 3.4 percent . &quot;
&quot; the profit in the second quarter , above all , has bur@@ dened above all the sun@@ ken value of the company in the face of its difficult economic situation . &quot;
the company &apos;s value @-@ de@@ preci@@ ation of EUR 139 million in the Consumer Experience division had a loss of 14@@ 8.2 million euros .
&quot; in the second quarter of 2015 , Gf@@ K achieved a net profit of 19.@@ 7 million . &quot;
accidents - Bus slides in Kru@@ mm@@ hör@@ n in Gr@@ aben : eight injured
&quot; in an accident of a coach with 43 sen@@ iors as passengers , eight people were injured on Thursday in Kru@@ mm@@ hör@@ n ( district Aur@@ ich ) . &quot;
&quot; two of the in@@ mates suffered severe injuries , the police shared . &quot;
&quot; the 66 @-@ year @-@ old driver of the coach of a travel company from Eisen@@ ach , according to their indications , had to escape to an opposite lor@@ ry that was partly on the reverse . &quot;
the bus came to the right from the street and sli@@ pped into a dit@@ ch as a spokes@@ woman of the police Aur@@ ich / Witt@@ mund reported .
&quot; due to the location of the bus , people could not leave the bus independently , &quot; she said . &quot;
the fire bri@@ g@@ ade liber@@ ated the occup@@ ants .
six ambul@@ ances and emergency ambul@@ ances came to the accident site at the provincial road 2 .
the un@@ last travel@@ er was brought back to the Kru@@ mm@@ hör@@ ner district of P@@ ew@@ sum .
there they should wait for a replacement bus of the travel company .
the investig@@ ators demanded the load experiences and possible witnesses to report to the police .
&quot; the fees per cubic meter of wast@@ ewater amount to € 2.@@ 10 for the area of the Neu@@ dorf / Re@@ uth / Wel@@ ding@@ ahl , 3.@@ 44 euros instead of 2.@@ 10 Euro ; for Zul@@ ten@@ berg / Lin@@ den@@ berg / lo@@ pp 3,@@ 36 Euro ( until now 2.@@ 26 Euro ) and for Az@@ endorf 3,@@ 64 Euro ( until now 2.@@ 18 Euro ) . &quot;
&quot; at the facility in Az@@ endorf , the sewage fee will then increase once again , if necessary improvement measures are necessary . &quot;
&quot; after a per@@ tin@@ ent calculation , the wast@@ ewater fee in Az@@ endorf will then be at 4.@@ 37 euros per cubic meter . &quot;
&quot; as Mayor Bernd Stein@@ häuser ( CS@@ U ) reported , the approval of the budget by the Kul@@ mb@@ ach land council has been established that under@@ cover these sewage plants . &quot;
&quot; due to the legal basis , the market Kas@@ endorf is obliged to operate the systems cost @-@ efficient . &quot;
&quot; from 1 October 2016 , citizens and industrial companies from Wel@@ don@@ ahl , Neu@@ dorf , Re@@ uth , Az@@ endorf , lo@@ pp , Lin@@ den@@ berg and Zul@@ ten@@ berg will have to take deeper into the wal@@ let . &quot;
the fee increases between 48 and 67 percent .
&quot; as Chairman of the Board of Directors , Herbert Schmidt presented the Board , a new calculation of the fees for the sewage plants of the market community was necessary . &quot;
&quot; in the period from October 2016 to September 2020 , over @-@ - or under@@ cover from the preceding calculation period can also be compens@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; the Schmidt @-@ based Schmidt founded Schmidt in order to handle relatively small facilities with a very low waste water treatment , which is between 68@@ 00 and 1@@ 2000 cubic meters per year . &quot;
&quot; thus , due to the small distribution of distribution , for example expendi@@ tures for necessary repairs of several thousand Euros would have a serious effect . &quot;
&quot; in addition , sewage works in all three plants are slightly dec@@ lining . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , due to its age refurb@@ ishment and repair expenses , due to its age , due to its age renovation and repair expenses , in a significant amount due to its age . &quot;
&quot; the facility in Az@@ endorf is nearly 30 years old , the plants for world food , Neu@@ dorf and Re@@ uth as well as Zul@@ ten@@ berg , Lin@@ den@@ berg and lo@@ pp for almost 20 years . &quot;
Schmidt noted that in the wast@@ ewater management Az@@ endorf the mechanical ventilation system had to be replaced due to damage .
&quot; in the Pump@@ werk World War , the nearly 20 @-@ year @-@ old conveyor systems had to be over@@ hau@@ led , and the sewage treatment plant had to be repaired , the sewage slu@@ dge has to be dispos@@ ed and an additional ventilation option had to be installed in order to comply with the water legal requirements in the future . &quot;
&quot; Schmidt : &quot; &quot; for these extraordinary expenses , the continued maintenance and maintenance costs , which are to be taken into account in the new calculation period . &quot;
Glei@@ ss Lutz Firm of the Year for White Coll@@ ar Crime Rede@@ ker Sell@@ ner Dah@@ s
&quot; stone houses made clear that in the three plants , the expenses for operation and maintenance have been fully penet@@ rated . &quot;
&quot; Schmidt , the market community of great entertainment costs remained spar@@ ed during the last 20 years . &quot;
&quot; the situation for the aforementioned systems will continue to remain prec@@ ari@@ ous in the view of stone houses in the long run , as it is not possible to expand the supply area of the Fri@@ es@@ enb@@ acht@@ al wast@@ ewater association for these facilities because it is a defic@@ it . &quot;
Bulgaria to book for the first time in 8 months of inflation
national statistics show that inflation in Bulgaria was 1 % on a monthly basis .
this is the highest value ( since June 2012 ) and the first over zero since October last year as positive 0.2 % were recorded .
the average annual average of the last 12 months ( August 2015 - July 2016 ) compared to the previous 12 months ( August 2014 - July 2015 ) was measured according to the CP@@ I -@@ 0.8 % .
&quot; the consumer price index in July 2016 compared to June 2016 was 10@@ 1.0 % , i.e. monthly inflation was 1.0 % . &quot;
the inflation rate since the beginning of the year ( July 2016 compared to December 2015 ) was -@@ 0.2 % and the annual inflation in July 2016 compared to July 2015 was -@@ 0.2 % .
&quot; in July 2016 , a price increase in the following groups of consumer goods was observed in July 2016 : food and non @-@ alcoholic beverages ( 1.7 % ) ; leisure and culture ( 6.3 % ) ; restaurants and hotels ( 1,2 % ) ; various goods and services ( 0.3 % ) . &quot;
&quot; prices fell in clothing and shoes ( 2.2 % ) ; furniture , household appliances and routine maintenance ( 0.5 % ) ; health ( 0.1 % ) . &quot;
&quot; prices remained as in the previous month with alcoholic beverages and tobacco ; apartments , water , electricity , gas and other fuels ; communication ; and education unchanged . &quot;
Snap@@ chat &quot; Ani@@ me &quot; Effect as Asian carto@@ on cri@@ tici@@ zed
&quot; Snap@@ chat says that this filter is anim@@ e @-@ inspired , but some ob@@ servers say that it is in@@ sensitive to races . &quot;
&quot; with its filtering tool , Snap@@ chat enables around 150 million daily users to change reality and play with identi@@ ties in such a way that is already adjacent to the absur@@ dity . &quot;
&quot; you can turn into a p@@ ine@@ apple , a dog or a figure that could be from a Roy Licht@@ enstein painting . &quot;
&quot; the filters are amazing , property @-@ based tools that produce more than 30 million sel@@ fies sel@@ fies per day . &quot;
all mis@@ carri@@ ages arrive to the public .
&quot; in the past Snap@@ chat filters have drawn criticism in the past , in which they were acc@@ using that the app would prop@@ el Black@@ face promoting or white skin as beauty ideal . &quot;
&quot; as this week suggested some users a filter that gave them sl@@ ot@@ ting , false teeth and un@@ dar@@ ker che@@ eks , there were some critics a rac@@ ist car@@ ic@@ ature of Asi@@ ans - &quot; yellow face . &quot; &quot;
they asked if these repeated controversi@@ es pointed to a bigger problem that the company has di@@ vers@@ atur@@ ity .
&quot; the news and indig@@ nation were widespread on Wednesday , with reports from The Ver@@ ge and Mother@@ board , a day after Snap@@ chat shared that it had disabled the feature . &quot;
the company offered an exc@@ use : the filter was intended as an hom@@ age to Ani@@ me characters and not as car@@ ic@@ ature from Asi@@ ans .
&quot; but out@@ si@@ ders who have experienced rac@@ ism , the filter reminded me of inj@@ urious c@@ lich@@ és . &quot;
others refused the Ani@@ me comparison .
&quot; in an e @-@ mail , Grace Sav@@ ap@@ ani wrote , a Korean @-@ American art student , whose twe@@ et was widely spread over the photos that the filter was &quot; &quot; vulnerable and bar@@ k &quot; . &quot; &quot;
she added that &quot; it was difficult to argue with the comparison of a very disgu@@ sting Asian car@@ ic@@ ature and the filter effects .
&quot; it shows that the filter is not yellow @-@ faced , but that the yellow @-@ face was pulled into the lower extreme . &quot;
Snap@@ chat is not the only company that crosses this cultural pride @-@ wire .
&quot; American culture seems to be involved in an endless diversity and integration fight , ranging from conference rooms to Hollywood and the appliances that we all hold in hand . &quot;
and Snap@@ ch@@ ats great audience of young people - who are different in the race of diverse as their older opponents - could be more likely to expect sensitivity .
&quot; when one of Snap@@ chat filters creates a picture that is offensive for a user , &quot; &quot; so it is much more difficult for such things to remain un@@ noticed when it was the case , &quot; &quot; said the 25 @-@ year @-@ old K@@ atie Z@@ hu in an interview on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday Z@@ hu , who works as a product manager and engineer for media , decided to delete their Snap@@ chat account , and asked others to do the same . &quot;
&quot; in an essay on the medium and in a telephone interview , she said that they reflect that ras@@ sen@@ sed controversi@@ es reflect a lack of diversity in the setting practices of Snap@@ chat . &quot;
&quot; Z@@ hu cri@@ tici@@ zed the largely white , only male leadership and finished her essay with a h@@ ash@@ tag : # Del@@ et@@ e@@ Snap@@ chat . &quot;
&quot; either they have no diverse representation of people with other skin colors in their workforce , so that they can make such decisions , &quot; &quot; said the Chinese @-@ American Z@@ hu , &quot; or they have people with other skin colors that work there , but not in positions in which they feel safe or comfortable to tell . &quot;
&quot; others share their opinion , a complaint that has largely left Snap@@ chat un@@ answered . &quot;
the company does not publish any numbers on the diversity of its employees and points to its status as a private company .
&quot; on Thursday , the Snap@@ chat managed to discuss the cultural backgrounds of his employees , but according to a spokes@@ man , the company recently hired a staff responsible , focused on subordin@@ ated population groups and on internal integration efforts . &quot;
&quot; in their turn , Z@@ hu said they were closed their Snap@@ chat account and added , &quot; I wonder if they need more users like us to say that this is not O.@@ K. . &quot;
&quot; military leadership distor@@ ted IS@@ IS secret service information , establishes Committee of Congress &quot;
&quot; the military personnel of the United States Central Command changed intelligence information to draw an optim@@ istic picture of the war against the so @-@ called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria , as it had allowed the actual conditions on site , reported an inquiry committee of the Congress in a report on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; the provis@@ ional report , created by a Task Force of the Republi@@ can Members of the Defence Committee , Secret Service Com@@ mit@@ ees and the Defense Committee , reports of great dis@@ satisfaction among Central Command Secret Service analysts who reported how superi@@ ors changed their ass@@ essments to American efforts in the fight against the Islamic State . &quot;
&quot; the Central Command , short Cen@@ com , is the military headquarters in T@@ amp@@ a , Florida which controls American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia . &quot;
&quot; jud@@ ging intelligence , typically sent by high @-@ level Cent@@ com com@@ man@@ ders , regularly marked a positive image of US efforts against terrorism as the actual conditions on site had been permitted and were consistently positive as analyses of other news services , &quot; cited a newspaper article . &quot;
&quot; what happened at Cent@@ com is un@@ acceptable - our soldiers suffer if bad analyses are presented to our political leaders , &quot; Ken Cal@@ vert , a republi@@ can member of the House of Represent@@ atives , stated . &quot;
the leadership mistakes in Cent@@ Com are reaching the top tip of the organization .
the ten @-@ sided report shows detailed consistent problems in the years 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analysis of American efforts in the training of Iraqi forces .
&quot; although there are no direct indications that government tips under Obama have given instructions to change reports , it shows how analysts have faced the pressure from their superi@@ ors , an optim@@ istic picture of the threat of the Islamic State , also known as IS@@ IS or IS@@ IL . &quot;
&quot; during the first half of 2015 , many Central Command press releases , statements and statements before the congress were clearly more positive than it meets the facts . &quot; &quot;
&quot; for example , a Cent@@ Com member publicly announced that a military re@@ conquest of the Mos@@ sul@@ s could already begin in April or May 2015 . &quot;
&quot; Mos@@ su@@ l , second largest city in Iraq , remains under the control of the Islamic State . &quot;
&quot; after months of investigation , so much is clear . &quot; &quot; said Mike Pom@@ pe@@ o , a Republi@@ can Congress of Congress from K@@ ans@@ as , in an opinion . &quot;
&quot; from the middle of 2014 to the middle of 2015 , the Central Command points changed the monthly reports to download the threat of IS@@ IS in Iraq . &quot;
the Republi@@ cans called the Task Force to live after they were admitted that analysts were worried about the manipulation of reports to the Islamic State .
the report published on Thursday will be completed by more detailed insights and will be continued throughout the investigations .
&quot; in addition , further investigations of Cent@@ Com reports by the Secretary @-@ General of the Ministry of Defense are underway . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , democratic members of the Intelligence Committee published their own findings , which coinci@@ ded with some of the conclusions of the Republi@@ can Task Force . &quot;
&quot; in 2014 and 2015 , Cent@@ com created an exc@@ essi@@ vely restricted process for the creation of intelligence services on IS@@ IL and the Iraqi security services , &quot; the highest @-@ level Democrats in the committee , Member of the House of Represent@@ atives , Adam B. Schiff , announced in an opinion . &quot;
&quot; this process , &quot; Mr. Schiff , &quot; delayed the publication of reporting intelligence reports , &quot; &quot; the mor@@ ality was under analy@@ st and &quot; &quot; gave too little room for different opinions . &quot;
&quot; but Mr. Schiff and the Democrats stated that there was no indication of a &quot; &quot; White House &quot; &quot; intervention in Cent@@ Com analysts with regard to a &quot; &quot; certain political opinion &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the preliminary results of the investigations of the Congress were published on Tuesday by &quot; The Daily Be@@ ast . &quot;
&quot; last August , the New York Times reported by the Pentagon &apos;s General In@@ spec@@ tor , who were taken up after dis@@ comfort of Cent@@ Com analysts . &quot;
&quot; Lt@@ . C@@ m@@ dr@@ . Patrick Ev@@ ans , a Pentagon spokes@@ man , gave in an opinion that the Department of Defence would not comment reports of Congress , while investigations of the general inspec@@ tor are still underway . &quot;
&quot; but he also adm@@ its that &quot; experts sometimes have quite di@@ verg@@ ent opinions regarding interpretation of complex data , and that the intelligence services and the Ministry of Defense welcomed a controversial debate on these important issues of national defence . &quot;
the investigations have reper@@ c@@ ussions about the question of a successful air campaign under U.S. leadership in Iraq and Syria ( a claim that is meanwhile made by a growing number of members of the Ministry of Defense ) .
&quot; however , the alleg@@ ations of last year have raised the question to what President Obama can rely on the Central Command for honest ass@@ essments of military operations in Iraq , Afghanistan , Libya and other crisis regions . &quot;
&quot; the criticism concerning the secret information about the Islamic State is remin@@ is@@ cent of more than ten years ago , as a Cent@@ com analy@@ st , Gregory Hoo@@ ker , a writing piece about how the then government under George W. Bush expected only a small occupation force in Iraq and a little time to think about the consequences of the invasion of 2003 . &quot;
Mr. Hoo@@ ker also played a key role in the insurrection against the current reporting of the Islamic State .
&quot; last year , the team headed by Mr. Hoo@@ ker stated that against the statements by the government air@@ strikes against the refin@@ eries held by the Islamic State , they had no significant impact on the financial situation of the terrorist group , since these provis@@ ional refin@@ eries had put into operation to sell oil on the black market . &quot;
&quot; however , this knowledge was not published , the Times reported in September . &quot;
&quot; Cent@@ com@@ s then commander , Gen@@ . Lloyd J. Austin III , was cri@@ tici@@ zed by members of the legisl@@ ature for his excessive positive assessment of the war situation at a hearing before the Senate . &quot;
general Austin retired in April and was replaced by the Central Command by Gen@@ . Joseph L. V@@ otel .
&quot; the USA win a fourth match in the field hock@@ ey of women , a show@@ down with the UK . &quot;
&quot; one day after she had shot three gates during a 6 @-@ 1 victory over Japan , K@@ atie B@@ am also made the first two goals for the American football team of women in a match against India that the Americans won with 3 @-@ 0 . &quot;
&quot; five goals in two games should actually represent a memorable achievement , but B@@ am ( 27 ) said she couldn &apos;t remember it ever done . &quot;
&quot; I have no idea . &quot; she said .
I don &apos;t belong to the people who keep their doors in memory .
&quot; however , she knows : the Americans are at 4 @-@ 0 in the olymp@@ ic competition and are at the first place in their group with the Brit@@ ons , who remain un@@ defeated after their 2 @-@ 0 victory against Japan . &quot;
Britain and the United States will meet on Saturday in the last game of the first round .
&quot; both teams have already qualified for the quarter @-@ fin@@ als , the game will decide which of the two teams will win the first and second place within their group from six teams . &quot;
the first placed will take a little longer to the strong Dut@@ ch@@ man who will guide the other group .
&quot; as ever , the game may start on Saturday , the Americans have triggered a surprising vor@@ tex by their success story , four years after they landed at the last London games on the last of 12 places . &quot;
BA@@ M was part of this team .
&quot; she grew up in Blue Bell , Pennsylvania , and had the first time with three years a hock@@ ey stick in hands ( her two older sisters played sports at the Dre@@ xel University ) , with 16 years she became national player in the USA , the youngest in the history of the team . &quot;
&quot; she missed the Olympics in 2008 , because she couldn &apos;t qualify for the cad@@ re . &quot;
then came the year 2012 in which for her and her team everything went wrong .
&quot; in the following year Cra@@ ig Par@@ n@@ ham , an Engl@@ ish@@ man , coach of the National Team and thus began to turn things better . &quot;
&quot; a change of culture , a mental change and a physical change , &quot; said B@@ am . &quot;
we did not have the work gap in London we now have .
we have completely s@@ nat@@ ched the ru@@ dder .
on Thursday evening B@@ am opened the Tor@@ rei@@ gen in the first half of the game with a return cover from the se@@ am area .
&quot; India had gone into the game without victory in the tournament , but the team was surprisingly tough and held the game stand from 1 @-@ 0 to the third quarter until B@@ am took the game into their hands . &quot;
&quot; it performed a spr@@ int with the flat ball over the left flan@@ k , then moved to the middle and put the ball into the gate to get the American female a 2 @-@ 0 guide . &quot;
Mel@@ issa Gon@@ z@@ al@@ ez made the final goal in the middle of the last quarter .
&quot; Sh@@ ut@@ out was the first of the tournament for the door@@ ke@@ epers of the USA , Jack@@ ie Brig@@ gs , who had previously had to book a gate in each of the previous games . &quot;
it has a run .
just as B@@ am .
&quot; we are in a good position &quot; said Par@@ n@@ ham , but how good will depend on the outcome of the next game on Saturday . &quot;
&quot; amid the R@@ age of the Olympic Games , the Zen of the Tramp@@ ol@@ ines &quot;
&quot; wherever you are , how late it is , it &apos;s the Olympic Games . &quot;
&quot; the events in Rio de Janeiro feel constantly and in@@ escap@@ able , a rapid relay between competition and pursu@@ it . &quot;
&quot; it is , as if the Olympic tor@@ ch itself would be a burning rod , which is handed down from the Armb@@ ru@@ st@@ Protect to the gymn@@ asts for tri@@ athletes . &quot;
&quot; you can &apos;t turn on the TV , read a newspaper or listen to the conversation of your neighbour in the queu@@ e in the coff@@ es@@ hop , without listening to Simone Bil@@ es , K@@ atie Le@@ deck@@ y or the dispute between Michael P@@ helps and C@@ had le C@@ los . &quot;
and then there is Log@@ an Do@@ ol@@ ey .
&quot; Do@@ ol@@ ey , who is here for the first time at the Olympic Games and a women &apos;s black with dim@@ ples , could certainly have been among these famous names created by sponsors and well @-@ being TV advertising , if he would be a s@@ wimm@@ ers , gymn@@ asts or even true . &quot;
&quot; but Do@@ ol@@ ey , 28 , from Lake Forest , California , fights for gold . &quot;
the olymp@@ ic flame does not illumin@@ ate any event .
&quot; further from the centre , partly in the shade there are the sports which are not univers@@ ally recognized : air pist@@ ol , Archery , Bad@@ min@@ ton , Ta@@ ek@@ won@@ do . &quot;
we will always have the breast swimming and may it reign for a long time .
&quot; but if I am modest to make arguments for my particular dar@@ ling , then let me draw attention to the discre@@ et charm of the trampoline . &quot;
&quot; although the trampoline jumping has been an Olympic event since 2000 , when it had its debut in Sydney , the last 16 years have been so spar@@ ingly perceived that many of the ones that I had ques@@ tioned , did not know that it is at all an Olympic sport . &quot;
this could also be regional ignorance .
&quot; although the US sent athletes to competition , there has never won a medal in the trampoline jumping and had an ath@@ l@@ ete until 2012 , which made it to the final round . &quot;
the Chinese and the Russians tend to share the prices for the men and the Chinese and the Canadian ones for women .
D@@ ong D@@ ong from China and Ro@@ sie Mac@@ L@@ enn@@ an from Canada will defend their gold medal from London this year .
&quot; the trampoline jumping has a certain outer shell , partly because it sounds suitable for the un@@ enligh@@ tened ear for a c@@ low@@ ns school than that sounds for the Olympic Games . &quot;
&quot; at this point , I should admit that I am not an expert , but only a subli@@ me enthusi@@ ast . &quot;
&quot; it has hum@@ orous potential - the kar@@ to@@ on@@ ous trem@@ bling of his never @-@ ending sensation - but also the gra@@ zie of gymn@@ asi@@ um and diving , the two sports that are essentially unified . &quot;
&quot; the word &quot; &quot; trampoline &quot; &quot; comes from the Spanish El trampoline , which means as much as &quot; spring@@ board . &quot; &quot;
&quot; asp@@ iring winners jump on a gigantic trampoline , shoot almost up to 30 feet into the air and must hit a number of falling mot@@ ions ( turning , pi@@ ke and o@@ int@@ ment ) before landing on the feet . &quot;
&quot; they are assessed according to official Olympi@@ apro@@ gram of execution , difficulty and &quot; flight time . &quot; &quot;
&quot; thirty @-@ one athletes from 17 countries , 16 men and 16 women , will compete against each other in Rio . &quot;
the most common olymp@@ ic v@@ ector is straight ahead .
&quot; med@@ alli@@ sts have to go to gold in their pursu@@ it of gold , faster , up and down , sometimes to the finish , sometimes back and back , up and down@@ wards on the playground . &quot;
&quot; they do not only ch@@ ase the finish line or the bas@@ eline , but also in the television broadcast a further increased goal : the world or the Olympi@@ ar@@ ist . &quot;
&quot; the goal @-@ oriented aspir@@ ation is no@@ bel , admir@@ able , even fan@@ atic - and it is enough to even stir up a spect@@ ator to tears . &quot;
but it is also what I think even when watching these games as something ti@@ ring .
the trampoline offers an breathing break .
the v@@ ector of the trampoline is above .
a forward movement is not the goal .
&quot; he or she pr@@ all@@ t , seemingly wei@@ ght@@ lessly as an a@@ stron@@ aut , goes up , then down , then effort@@ lessly back up . &quot;
&quot; there is also a competition , of course not without difficulty , but during exercise there is no hec@@ tic attack on the goal , no wolf in the distance , only the dre@@ amy , elegant suspension of time and gravity . &quot;
it is as Zen as the competition can only be for the Olympic Games .
&quot; the qualification and final rounds of women will take place on Friday afternoon , in streaming at 13.00 Eastern Time ; the men on Saturday , also around 13.00 . &quot;
N@@ BC will radi@@ ate the final rounds as part of an afternoon on both days from 14.00 onwards .
&quot; amid the Olympia @-@ Man@@ ia , they promise a quiet , nice moment , one that is probably over@@ looked in general tum@@ ult . &quot;
&quot; when the increase in consciousness can only be achieved through the an@@ thro@@ po@@ ids and objec@@ tification of male athletes - as the male US gymn@@ asts recently suggested - then Mr Do@@ ol@@ ey expects his air to rin@@ se , new fan community . &quot;
&quot; a generation protests &quot; in Ethiopia , Long an ally of the USA &quot;
violent protests in Ethiopia
demonstr@@ ators who demand political changes in Ethiopia met with violent resistance of the government .
witnesses say that tens of thousands of prot@@ esters were killed during clas@@ hes with the police .
is Ethiopia to collapse ?
&quot; in the last ten years , it was one of the most stable countries of Africa , a solid ally of the West with a rapidly growing economy . &quot;
&quot; however , in recent months protests against the government sh@@ ook the country and spread in more and more areas . &quot;
last week thousands of people rus@@ hed on the streets and demanded fundamental political changes .
&quot; according to human rights organisations , the response of the government was rel@@ ent@@ less . &quot;
witnesses stated that polic@@ emen were shot and killed in zig un@@ armed demonstr@@ ators .
&quot; in circulation , videos about the protests , which are probably from the last or the beginning of this year , show how security men beat young people with sticks , while they were forced to make a hand stand against a wall . &quot;
the chief of the UN Human Rights Authority is now asking for a detailed investigation .
&quot; it was always difficult to hold this country together and in the future it will even become even more difficult , &quot; &quot; said Ras@@ hid Ab@@ di , the leader of the Horn of Africa of the International Crisis Group , a research group . &quot;
Ethiopia is the most popul@@ ous country in Africa and its stability is appreciated by the West .
&quot; American military and secret services work closely with the Ethiop@@ ians to fight terrorism beyond the region , especially in Somalia . only a few countries in Africa , if ever , receive so much Western help . &quot;
Ethiopia &apos;s economy expanded at a considerable pace .
its infrastructure has improved dramatically - there is a new commu@@ ter train in Ad@@ dis Ab@@ aba .
&quot; the roads are usually quiet , safe and clean . &quot;
&quot; even though Ethiopia was anything but a model for democracy - human rights organisations have continually led the repression by the government - the opposition in the country was restricted , with dissi@@ dents were effective to silence . &quot;
&quot; many were sent to exile or in prison , killed or pushed into the des@@ erts of the desert . &quot;
but that could change .
&quot; if you supp@@ ress people and have no other options except protest , it breaks out , &quot; said Se@@ you@@ m Tes@@ home , a lec@@ turer in Central Ethiopia . &quot;
the entire youth prot@@ ested .
a generation prot@@ ested .
there are numerous complaints that cover everything from land use to stran@@ gl@@ ehold in relation to the power of the ruling coalition .
&quot; following an extensive cri@@ tici@@ zed election last year , the ruling party and its allies received the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 percent of the parliament . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , tensions continue along the border to Er@@ it@@ rea ; a struggle for this sharp , controversial line demanded hundreds of lives in June . &quot;
&quot; analysts fear that separ@@ ati@@ sts like the Oro@@ mo Liber@@ ation Front or the National Liber@@ ation Front of the O@@ g@@ aden , which have been more or less en@@ forced in recent years , use turbul@@ ence and could re@@ arm themselves . &quot;
several factors explain why feelings of bit@@ tern@@ ing after years of hypo@@ cris@@ y under the surface now explo@@ de .
the first seems harmless : smartphones .
&quot; only in recent years many Ethiop@@ ians were able to communicate with the social media , as cheaper smartphones have become increasingly common and improved Internet services . &quot;
&quot; even if the government blocks access to Facebook and Twitter , what they are doing at regular intervals , especially in protests , many people can still communicate via internet pro@@ x@@ ies that hide where they stop . &quot;
several young Ethiop@@ ians claimed that they were gathered to protest .
&quot; the second factor is that there is more solidarity between the Oro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as , the two largest eth@@ ni@@ cities in Ethiopia . &quot;
the Oro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as are not natural enemies .
&quot; since e@@ ons , the Am@@ har@@ as , who come from Ethiopia in predominantly Christian high@@ lands , prosp@@ ered in politics and economy , while they exploited the Oro@@ mos , of which many Muslims are and live in low@@ land areas . &quot;
but this also changes .
&quot; we are here to co @-@ ordin@@ ate under a screen , &quot; said Mul@@ atu Gem@@ ech@@ u , a leader of the Oro@@ mos . &quot;
the largest protests took place in the Am@@ res@@ a and Oro@@ mos areas .
&quot; many Am@@ res@@ as and Oro@@ mos have the feeling that Ethiopia is dominated by members of the ethnic group of the Tig@@ ray which accounts for about 6 percent of the population and dominant in the military , the intelligence services , trade and politics . &quot;
the third reason for un@@ rest is the death of Mel@@ es Zen@@ awi .
&quot; Mr. Mel@@ es , a former re@@ bel leader , was up to his death on a non @-@ publi@@ ci@@ zed disease in 2012 17 years of Ethiopia &apos;s prime minister . &quot;
&quot; he was considered a tac@@ tical geni@@ us , a man who could think about corners . &quot;
analysts say that it was especially conden@@ sed to detect early signs of dis@@ satisfaction and to use special officials to process opponents and make them harmless .
&quot; the current regime l@@ acks this fundamental skill , &quot; &quot; said Mr. Ab@@ di , a conflict analy@@ st . &quot;
&quot; Ethiop@@ ian Prime Minister , H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am Des@@ al@@ eg@@ n , was chosen for relatively in@@ sight@@ ful reasons to take the position of Mr Mel@@ es . &quot;
&quot; unlike Mr. Mel@@ es , who came from the Tig@@ ray region of northern Ethiopia , Mr. H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am comes from the south . &quot;
analysts say that he does not enjoy the confidence of the security services controlled by the Tig@@ ray .
many fear that the result will be more blood@@ shed .
&quot; the last time Ethiopia was experiencing such a tur@@ mo@@ il in 2005 , after thousands of elections prot@@ ested , which , according to the indications of analysts , had apparently been decei@@ ved by the government and subsequently stolen . &quot;
&quot; during the following ra@@ ids , many prot@@ esters were killed , even if there were less than in the last months and this time of un@@ rest went relatively quickly . &quot;
&quot; development experts praised the Ethiop@@ ian leaders for their vision@@ ary infrastructure planning , as the new commu@@ ter train , as well as their meas@@ urable progress in poverty reduction . &quot;
but obviously this does not prevent the intensi@@ fication of the internal ab@@ norm@@ alities of the Ethiop@@ ian government .
and she takes a dangerous eth@@ ni@@ cal form .
&quot; last month prot@@ esters attacked in Gon@@ dar , a sham@@ anic city , from Tig@@ ray led businesses and the hatred of the tig@@ ray is increasingly common in social media . &quot;
analysts say that the protests bring the US and other western allies into a peculiar position .
&quot; the American government used Ethiopia as the basis for D@@ ron@@ en@@ ough@@ s on neighbouring Somalia , although it recently announced that it has concluded that base . &quot;
&quot; while the West clearly wants to support democracy , he does not want its allies to collapse in an already volati@@ le area . &quot;
&quot; this , &quot; said Mr. Ab@@ di , &quot; is a very thin em@@ igration . &quot;
Donald Tru@@ mp explains his claim Obama had established IS@@ IS &quot; sar@@ cas@@ m &quot;
&quot; Donald J. Tru@@ mp tried to dissi@@ p@@ ate the last contro@@ vers@@ y that surro@@ unds his campaign by att@@ acking that his repeated asser@@ tion , President Obama and Hill@@ ary Clinton would have been the &quot; founder &quot; of the terrorist group Islamic State , not serious . &quot;
&quot; this clari@@ fication shed new questions on the communication skills of the Republi@@ cans , whether he is able to communicate clearly and comprehen@@ sively with the American public . &quot;
&quot; it also ent@@ ails his comrades who endeav@@ or to take care of him during an event@@ ful phase , in the peculiar position , declar@@ ations which he could not have meant . &quot;
&quot; after he had made the hint at a election campaign on Wednesday evening , Mr. Tru@@ mp returned to the asser@@ tion on Thursday and insist@@ ed that he really did not intend to interpret , the President and Mrs. Clinton had created IS@@ IS . &quot;
&quot; but in an early morning twe@@ et on Friday , Mr. Tru@@ mp said he was simply sar@@ c@@ astic . &quot;
&quot; the twe@@ et was the contrast to the previous day when Mr. Tru@@ mp said in a series of interviews , he meant the ap@@ ology absolutely serious . &quot;
&quot; when the conservative Radi@@ om@@ or@@ ator H@@ ugh He@@ wit@@ t Mr. Tru@@ mp wanted to we@@ aken the statement somewhat by rem@@ inding him that Mr. Obama wants to destroy IS@@ IS , the Republi@@ can candidate did not want to know anything about it . &quot;
the last storm of criticism pr@@ as@@ sel@@ t on Mr. Tru@@ mp while trying to direct the focus of his campaign because of falling demand values to the economic situation .
Mr. Tru@@ mp and Mrs. Clinton held speeches about the economic situation in Michigan this week .
on Friday Mr. Tru@@ mp tried to return to this subject again .
&quot; talking about Twitter , he warned that Mrs. Clinton &apos;s suggestions would lead to higher taxes and that he found their speech boring . &quot;
Mr. Tru@@ mp has already introduced sar@@ cas@@ m to his defense .
&quot; at the end of July he drew strong criticism when he said the Russians should h@@ ack Mrs. Clinton &apos;s emails , but later he said &quot; Of course I meant the sar@@ c@@ astic . &quot;
this method allows Mr. Tru@@ mp to post@@ p@@ one the linguistic fron@@ tiers in politics and then move back to demand .
&quot; I think it &apos;s one of his methods to test how certain messages are recorded by his fans as they arrive , and then if necessary clarify , &quot; &quot; depending on what the reaction falls . &quot; &quot; Ruth Sher@@ man , a communication expert , who ob@@ serves the language of both candidates . &quot;
&quot; but I think he is clever enough to keep his statements v@@ ague enough , so that they can be interpreted in various ways . &quot;
&quot; instead of shar@@ pen@@ ing the tone for the presidential elections , Mr. Tru@@ mp has adopted an even et@@ ched sound , since its survey values continued to go back . &quot;
&quot; a new survey of N@@ BC / Wall Street Journal / Mar@@ ist published on Friday showed a leadership with a big advantage in North Carolina , Virginia , Colorado and a head @-@ in @-@ head race in Florida . &quot;
&quot; while Mr. Tru@@ mp generally tries to ap@@ ologi@@ ze for his pro@@ voc@@ ative statements , he often accused his critics to dist@@ ort his statements or to understand his humor incor@@ rectly . &quot;
&quot; but while he is increasingly focuss@@ ed on the focus of attention in the last months of his presidential campaign , Mr. Tru@@ mps kid@@ n@@ apping his loyal fellow workers into the uncomfortable situation , regardless of how pro@@ voc@@ ative his statements may be . &quot;
&quot; Rudol@@ ph W. Giuli@@ ani , former Mayor of New York and one of Tru@@ mps &apos;s most prominent inter@@ c@@ essors , gave great effort to defend the candidate today in a CN@@ N interview . &quot;
&quot; I believe what he says are legitimate , political comment@@ aries , &quot; Mr. Giuli@@ ani said therefore to the correctness of Mr. Tru@@ mps statements , whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic State . &quot;
&quot; it is true in this sense that before Obama , IS@@ IS was an almost unknown , small organisation , he called it amb@@ ass@@ ad@@ ors , completely wrong and therefore it happened because he with@@ drew the troops from Iraq . &quot;
&quot; most mainstream re@@ public@@ ans try to argue that the government under Obama , in Mrs. Clinton , served as an external minister , allowed IS@@ IS to spread the situation in the Middle East under control . &quot;
&quot; before the election campaigns in Pennsylvania on Friday , Mr. Tru@@ mp continued his attacks on the media and accused them of going around on each of his words and to be pre@@ occupied against him . &quot;
&quot; he ridi@@ cul@@ ed the &quot; poor , mis@@ erable &quot; television experts who try to understand and said , &quot; You cannot ! . &quot; &quot;
some of the democr@@ ats ridi@@ cul@@ ed Mr. Tru@@ mps &apos;s exc@@ use as just another proof that he was un@@ suitable for the pres@@ idency .
&quot; once more than the price of the market , café in Green@@ point returns &quot;
&quot; ver@@ b Cafe was a small cafe in Willi@@ am@@ sburg , where you could only pay cash that had no Wi @-@ Fi but for 15 years served good coffee . &quot;
&quot; of course , the prices from his Bed@@ ford Avenue store front were displac@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; the So@@ ap Ch@@ erie business , selling ver@@ b in summer 2014 , sells soap in the form of cup@@ cakes . &quot;
locals drunk it as the last loss in a gent@@ ri@@ fying city .
&quot; the artist Mol@@ ly Cr@@ ab@@ apple wrote on Twitter , &quot; I know New York is change , but I still can &apos;t believe that CB@@ GB is dead , the Chelsea Hotel apart and ver@@ b is now a soap business . &quot;
&quot; but if New York is change , then it is also new invention . &quot;
&quot; a revi@@ ved Ver@@ b Cafe opened last November in Green@@ point , less than a mile north of its original location . &quot;
&quot; the new ver@@ b has Wi @-@ Fi and accepts credit cards , but still has some of the same staff and a similarly simple atmosphere . &quot;
the coffee is still good .
&quot; the new owner of the ver@@ b is Cisco Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , a long @-@ standing employee of the old coffee bar , the owner and managing director of the new café . &quot;
he began working in 2001 at Ver@@ b and remained there until the end .
&quot; when a customer offered him to provide funds for a new exterior , he was excited to do it , he said . &quot;
&quot; Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , 36 , kept a lot . &quot;
ver@@ b uses the same distributor for the bag@@ els bought the same es@@ pres@@ so model .
it even uses the same lamps from the old ver@@ b .
but Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he wanted to experiment too .
he introduced new ingredients .
on the menu there are sand@@ wi@@ ches with bac@@ on and cheese and there are gar@@ ages like cap@@ ers and sau@@ ted onions .
there are natural keys .
&quot; the café serves no beer , but there are fresh ju@@ ices . &quot;
&quot; after nine months , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said that he had noticed a steady stream of old regular customers . &quot;
&quot; many old customers were also displac@@ ed by prices from Willi@@ am@@ sburg , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; recently on a Sunday , Rebecca Oli@@ v@@ eira was such a customer . &quot;
&quot; Oli@@ v@@ eira , 34 , lived in Willi@@ am@@ sburg and visited the ver@@ b regularly . &quot;
&quot; even after they had moved to Green@@ point , she would take the way . &quot;
&quot; after the ver@@ b closed , she gave a while the coffee ham , she said . &quot;
&quot; it was clear to me that it was at the coffee and the culture in the ver@@ b that pleased me , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; now she drinks coffee again , even if she ordered a Bl@@ ended Cha@@ i Tea on that day instead of her usual I@@ ced Coff@@ ee , which is another new addition . &quot;
Tom Ros@@ enthal has been a long and faithful customer since the beginning of the ver@@ b in 2003 .
he went there before the work and always ordered the same .
&quot; I came quarters after seven , every day like a Swiss pocket watch and they prepare my Every@@ thing B@@ agel with butter , &quot; he said . &quot;
photo Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he wanted to experiment and add new ingredients into the menu .
&quot; nowadays Ros@@ enthal still gets his usual order , but sometimes he changes his Every@@ thing B@@ agel with bac@@ on , egg and cheese . &quot;
&quot; Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said that he had no gru@@ dge about it , that the soap business has taken the old business room . &quot;
&quot; in fact , the owners of the So@@ ap Ch@@ erie offered a special soap for ver@@ b with the cold @-@ bre@@ w@@ ed coffee of the café as an ingredient . &quot;
&quot; I think we will go into their offer , &quot; said Rodri@@ gu@@ ez . &quot;
&quot; and the traditional , Polish inhabitants Green@@ points have also accepted the café . &quot;
&quot; a new customer has translated the menu to Polish and Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said that he pre@@ fers to exhibit it soon , so that his new neighb@@ ors feel welcome . &quot;
the location also has other advantages .
a local juice bar wants to fill and sell the cold @-@ bre@@ w@@ ed coffee .
there is a chance that the café is expanded to a nearby building .
&quot; for many customers , a new ver@@ b is enough to get their old favorites . &quot;
Joseph W@@ itt was a regular customer and said he was destroyed at the ground when the café closed .
&quot; when the new café opened , Wh@@ itt said that the step@@ ping of the locom@@ otive and the Order felt a new coffee like a hom@@ ec@@ oming . &quot;
&quot; I had to smell , &quot; he said . &quot;
the de@@ pressing food of the economic crisis in &quot; a rich meal &quot;
&quot; in March 1933 , shortly after his ascent to the president , Fran@@ klin Del@@ ano Ro@@ os@@ ev@@ elt took his lunch at the O@@ val Office . &quot;
&quot; as a g@@ our@@ mets , President Ro@@ os@@ ev@@ elt had a F@@ ai@@ ble for refined Del@@ ic@@ at@@ essen of Fi@@ fth Avenue like P@@ â@@ te de fo@@ ie gr@@ as and Maryland water tur@@ tle soup . &quot;
&quot; his menu on this day was slightly more modest : filled eggs in tomato sauce , m@@ ashed potatoes and dessert a pl@@ um pu@@ dding . &quot;
&quot; it was an act of culinary solidarity with suffering people , &quot; said Jane Zi@@ egel@@ man . &quot;
&quot; her husband Andrew Co@@ e added , &quot; It was also a message to the Americans as they should eat . &quot;
the couple lives in Brooklyn Heights and are both food histori@@ ans .
&quot; CO@@ Es last book &quot; &quot; C@@ hop su@@ ey &quot; &quot; acted by Chinese cuisine in the USA , while Zi@@ egel@@ man told her book &quot; 97 Orchard &quot; about life in a residential house at the Lower East Side from the food perspective . &quot;
&quot; their latest collaboration , &quot; A decent meal , &quot; which will appear on Tuesday at Har@@ per Verlag , illustrates the history of American cuisine during the Great Depression . &quot;
&quot; they showed culinary solidarity , when they meet with a repor@@ ter at the Eis@@ enberg &apos;s sand@@ wich shop , a small , schn@@ ör@@ k@@ ell@@ os@@ em I@@ mb@@ iss in the Fl@@ ati@@ ron District , which has been in business since the IP@@ O in 1929 . &quot;
&quot; Zi@@ egel@@ man , 54 , ordered a fresh cheese sand@@ wich with olives , while Co@@ e , 57 , tur@@ key with m@@ ashed potatoes and vegetable blend . &quot;
&quot; when the repor@@ ter asked Hack@@ ast , this was the couple for a discussion about the food in the era of the Great Depression . &quot;
&quot; rich food was very popular , &quot; &quot; said Zi@@ egel@@ man . &quot;
&quot; there were pe@@ an@@ ut bread , liver and bean bread . &quot;
they were prepared from an ingredient and something cheap that stretches the ingredient .
imagine eating so many pe@@ an@@ uts that they serve them as dinner .

&quot; it must have settled in the stomach like lead , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; in the years before the Great Depression , the table was in an American household , especially in rural areas , an all @-@ You @-@ Can @-@ E@@ at Buffet . &quot;
&quot; teams of women cooked for male field workers and it was served freshly baked past@@ els for breakfast , lunch and dinner . &quot;
&quot; it was the Americans who sent food to star@@ ving Europeans during World War II . &quot; &quot; a Square Me@@ al &quot; &quot; stands out the ways with which the country was moving , no longer to be the Schl@@ ar@@ aff@@ enland . &quot;
&quot; it was a time when food for the Americans was a central , ten@@ se theme , &quot; explains why he and his wife wanted to write about it . &quot;
&quot; the new budget was just as ten@@ se : mysterious food such as lo@@ aves and c@@ asser@@ ollen were stap@@ led to stap@@ le food , the c@@ asser@@ ole as a &quot; wonderful way to re@@ produce food lef@@ to@@ vers , &quot; as coo@@ ks could hide uns@@ appe@@ tiz@@ ing ingredients under a cre@@ amy sauce . &quot;
fresh fruit has been replaced by cheap dry fruit .
&quot; meat , which was the center of American cuisine for years , became a very rare luxury . &quot;
&quot; peculiar mix@@ tures have been tried , since a cal@@ orie @-@ rich and nutri@@ tious satisfaction had priority over flavor or even healthy cooking sense . &quot;
&quot; during her research for the book which also includes recipes , Zi@@ egel@@ man prepared a dish from this epoch , baked onions with pe@@ an@@ ut butter . &quot;
&quot; it was not any addi@@ tive at lun@@ ch@@ time , &quot; says Co@@ e . &quot;
Zi@@ egel@@ mann continues : &quot; it was sur@@ real . &quot;
pe@@ an@@ ut butter and baked onions do not fit together .
it was typical for many of the house recipes .
&quot; like never before or since , the budget farmers - including Louise Stan@@ ley , Head of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics between 1923 and 1943 - the eating habits of the country like this . &quot;
&quot; by published recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines , they encouraged women to become &quot; house@@ keeper &quot; and the challenge of transforming Pamp@@ e like cre@@ amy sp@@ aghetti with car@@ rots into delicious meals . &quot;
&quot; a Square Me@@ al &quot; is a feast of historical delicacies .
&quot; in particular , the reports of the government &apos;s response to star@@ ving citizens , such as President Herbert Hoo@@ ver &apos;s L@@ ass @-@ mir @-@ Cake @-@ Food @-@ attitude . &quot;
&quot; while he publicly praised the simple I@@ owa peasant kitchen of his kitchen , he spoke as the milli@@ on@@ ary man of the world he has become . &quot;
&quot; he liked continental food like fish with cu@@ cum@@ ber sauce , &quot; said Co@@ e . &quot;
he ate in an almost gil@@ ded dining room and carried a tu@@ x@@ ette .
he was wonderfully familiar to reality .
&quot; President Ro@@ os@@ ev@@ elt may have committed the same mistake , if not his wife Ele@@ an@@ or had asked him to stat@@ u@@ ate with his stomach . &quot;
&quot; as described in the book , the hypo@@ crit@@ es of a household with no interest in tastes caused by Ms Ro@@ os@@ ev@@ elt showed that the White House produced the most boring food in Washington , but also one of the most controversial . &quot;
&quot; many of the species from the era of the Great Depression , dealing with food , was rejected as soon as the country returned to the legs . &quot;
&quot; the legacy lies on our continued focus on calories and food , said Zi@@ egel@@ man , as well as on how science was applied to food . &quot;
&quot; when writing the book , the couple had better understood the eating habits of Zi@@ egel@@ man &apos;s mother @-@ in @-@ law better - for instance , how they could not throw foods away . &quot;
&quot; she had a real fear of the waste of food , &quot; &quot; said Co@@ e . &quot;
&quot; Zi@@ egel@@ man rec@@ alled , &quot; &quot; They actually made people sick . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there was the case of wind .
&quot; after the plates were cleared at Eis@@ enberg &apos;s , they and Co@@ e drew out a dessert that they had prepared at home : the pl@@ um dessert , the President Ro@@ os@@ ev@@ elt had lunch . &quot;
&quot; it is called Pr@@ une W@@ hip , &quot; &quot; Zi@@ egel@@ man said and added that it was a usual trick , modest recipes to miss a fancy name . &quot;
&quot; there was no whi@@ pped cream , only pl@@ ums , some flour , sugar , water and cinnamon . &quot;
&quot; everyone di@@ pped a spo@@ on in the t@@ amed , brown gli@@ b@@ ber . &quot;
&quot; surprisingly , it was not bad . &quot;
Co@@ E repeated three times a stop .
&quot; like a Can @-@ Do Bud@@ ge@@ tier@@ er he said to his wife , &quot; A few chopped wal@@ nuts would help . &quot;
killed in Bom@@ ben Attack : he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo
he put his own life on the game to help others : Khal@@ ed O@@ mar .
he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo : Khal@@ ed O@@ mar devoted his life to the people in Syria .
he ris@@ ked everything to save the lives of others .
&quot; now , the 30 @-@ year @-@ old died at a bom@@ bing attack by Assad regime . &quot;
&quot; O@@ mar was a member of &quot; &quot; White Helm@@ ets &quot; , &quot; a civil protection group , which , according to Bild @-@ Zeitung , had previously saved 60,000 people . &quot;
29@@ 00 volunteers put their own lives on the game to draw people from bom@@ bed houses and to help in the area of war .
they are the heroes of war in Syria .
&quot; O@@ mar was the group &apos;s face : a video of the civil defence , showing him during a 11 @-@ hour rescue of a baby from the ruins of a house , went around the world in 2014 . &quot;
it made the Syri@@ ans a shining symbol figure in the horror of war .
&quot; but he never saw himself as a hero , said according to the image : &quot; &quot; for me this is the real Ji@@ had . &quot;
&quot; when I die to save life , I think God sees a mart@@ yr in me . &quot;
&quot; just before O@@ mar himself fell victim to an attack , he had spoken in a video about the last bom@@ b@@ ings in Syria . &quot;
&quot; the helicop@@ ters have dropped four barrels over the Alz@@ adia district , one was filled with chlor@@ ine gas . &quot;
&quot; a woman and two children died , seven people suffer from breath . &quot;
&quot; we now eliminate the poison@@ ous remn@@ ants of the bomb , so that no children can play with it , &quot; the picture c@@ ites his last words before he died . &quot;
the deadly bomb of Assad &apos;s regime had to hit terrorists .
Greenland shar@@ k : the oldest cycl@@ one is almost 400 years old
rare sight .
Greenland h@@ ues usually come to the surface only in winter .
this shar@@ k was allowed to go back to the sea after an investigation on board the research ship S@@ anna .
it was born in 16@@ 24 and swi@@ ms with a good 1 km / h by the North Atlantic - until today .
Greenland has only 150 years of offspring .
&quot; lei@@ surely the Greenland @-@ shar@@ k flo@@ ats along the bottom of the North Atlantic , in an hour he reaches an average just 1,@@ 220 m . &quot;
&quot; only when it comes to it , the five @-@ meter @-@ long animal acceler@@ ates at sat@@ te 2.6 km / h - and is half as fast as a seal with this top speed . &quot;
&quot; this lifestyle , influenced by slow@@ ness , seems to be a god@@ entre@@ prise for a high age . &quot;
Julius Niel@@ sen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report in the journal Science &quot; at any rate from a Greenland shar@@ k that could be 392 years old .
&quot; mad@@ ness , &quot; commented Alexander Sch@@ euer@@ lein from the Max Planck Institute for demographic research in Rostock , which means a world record for vert@@ eb@@ rates . &quot;
&quot; although the evolution@@ ary bi@@ ologist already suspected , that Gr@@ ön@@ land@@ h@@ ie was st@@ ony @-@ old . &quot;
only lack@@ ed the evidence .
&quot; Greenland ha@@ ie is difficult to observe , after all , they live mainly in the polar sea in front of the spar@@ sely populated shores of Canada , Greenland , Norway and Sp@@ it@@ s@@ bergen . &quot;
&quot; because they prefer water temperatures around the six degrees Celsius , they usually appear only in winter on the surface . &quot;
researchers know little about the lifestyle of Greenland shar@@ ks .
their time pent@@ ines to them when they equipped six animals with one transmitter in front of Sp@@ it@@ s@@ bergen .
&quot; this shar@@ ks still make this shar@@ ks : in the stomach of an animal , researchers found the remains of a seal , another had swal@@ lowed the jaw bone of a young polar bear . &quot;
possibly they hunt sleep animals or pat@@ rol at the bottom of the ice @-@ sea and look for Kad@@ aver that tor@@ ul@@ ls from higher water layers down@@ wards .
&quot; Julius Niel@@ sen and his colleagues now studied 28 Greenland shar@@ ks , catching fishermen between 2010 and 2013 in front of Greenland or Sp@@ it@@ s@@ bergen as a catch from the depth of the North Atlantic . &quot;
&quot; the smallest shar@@ k was just 81 centimet@@ ers long , while the greatest 502 cm was measured . &quot;
&quot; to determine the age of the animals , they analyzed the lens nucle@@ us of shar@@ ks with the carbon @-@ 14 method . &quot;
&quot; this centre of the eye lens already arises before the birth of the shar@@ ks , the proteins contained in it are later no longer renewed . &quot;
the two smallest shar@@ ks had notably much carbon @-@ 14 in the lens @-@ core .
&quot; her birth should therefore lie after the early 1960s , as a nuclear weapon @-@ search for larger quantities of this radio@@ active carbon into the atmosphere . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , with 220 centimet@@ ers length of third @-@ smallest animal , the lens nucle@@ us sof@@ tens a small excess of carbon @-@ 14 out of the nuclear weapons , so it is likely to have celebrated its 50@@ th anniversary in its investigation in 2012 . &quot;
&quot; in their len@@ tic@@ ular nucle@@ us , all larger Greenland @-@ shar@@ ks had normal carbon @-@ 14 @-@ amounts due to cosmic radiation in the atmosphere . &quot;
&quot; in fact , the carbon @-@ 14 clock for a 493 centimet@@ re long Greenland @-@ shar@@ k showed an age of 335 years , while the Rekord Ha@@ i with 502 centimet@@ ers is likely to be 392 years old . &quot;
&quot; that Greenland @-@ shar@@ k females got offspring only then offspring , if they are longer than four meters , was known . &quot;
now the researchers could assign an age to the length .
&quot; since one of the animals with 392 centimet@@ ers probably stood on the threshold of the sex@@ ually mature age and his age was determined with 156 years , Greenland shar@@ ks with the multip@@ lication obviously allow at least one and a half centuries of time . &quot;
also this should be world record for vert@@ eb@@ rates .
&quot; however , that such meth@@ us@@ al@@ em@@ es live above all in icy waters is no coinci@@ dence . &quot;
&quot; the previous record holder , a 211 year old Gr@@ ön@@ land@@ w@@ al , caught a 120 @-@ year old har@@ poon head on the neck , was caught in front of Alaska . &quot;
&quot; due to the low temperatures , the organism of the animals living there often runs on fl@@ ames . &quot;
so they mature later - and age slower .
&quot; in order to keep warm in cold water , the animals are often very large . &quot;
because the volume grows much faster than its surface by which the animal gre@@ ases heat .
the heat loss of one gram mouse is therefore much larger than a gram of elephant .
another advantage : you have less enemies .
&quot; a smaller animal lives therefore more dangerous and should focus on as soon as possible as possible as possible as possible , &quot; explains the evolution@@ ary bi@@ ologist Sch@@ euer@@ lein . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , a very big animal should rather invest his resources into a long life . &quot;
building plot in a double pack
&quot; with themes relating to building , the municipal council has focused on focusing on the most recent session . &quot;
&quot; with relief , the committee took the notice of Mayor Robert P@@ utz that &quot; finally the marketing of the recently designated residential areas can begin . &quot;
&quot; after clearing the plot , par@@ cell@@ ing and development questions and the applications could be placed on surv@@ ey@@ ing , the sale of land in the residential areas &quot; Straß@@ l@@ weg &quot; and &quot; Schön@@ au @-@ West &quot; ( Bin@@ der@@ straße - construction section 1 ) is no longer in the way . &quot;
the Municipal Council is convinced that the bro@@ o@@ ks in the rural and quiet residential community Schön@@ au are equally appealing to young families and ru@@ sty sen@@ iors equally .
&quot; as it was meant , buildings can now be reported to the City Hall , and the municipal council is expected to advise the municipal council in its September session . &quot;
&quot; in order to have also en@@ quiries concerning the settlement of other commercial enterprises , associated with the creation of jobs , the municipal council decided to change the surface area plan newly created in the spring of this year . &quot;
&quot; thus , in the area of Unter@@ zeit@@ lar@@ n the industrial area has been expanded by two plots towards the State Road 21@@ 12 . &quot;
Frankfurt benefits from Bre@@ x@@ it
&quot; the city on the Main has therefore the best chances of attrac@@ ting jobs and companies from London in the competition with Paris , Dublin and Luxembourg . &quot;
&quot; it is highly likely that Frankfurt benefits most from Bre@@ x@@ it @-@ V@@ ot@@ um , &quot; says Michael Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder , Head of the Competence Network &apos;s Financial Markets and Real Estate Markets of the I@@ W . &quot;
&quot; after the Bre@@ x@@ it referendum , it is uncer@@ tain whether money houses continue to operate from London from financial transactions across the EU . &quot;
&quot; for the so @-@ called EU passport , the approval in the UK is sufficient . &quot;
this is using big US banks .
several banks have already announced to reloc@@ ate jobs .
the lob@@ by@@ association &quot; Frankfurt Main Finance &quot; expects 10000 new jobs on the Main within five years .
&quot; for Frankfurt , the I@@ W , the seat of the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , adop@@ ts the responsibility for monetary policy and supervision over the largest banks in the euro area , as well as other important authorities such as the European insurance supervisory authorities E@@ I@@ OP@@ A and the risk management ES@@ R@@ B . &quot;
&quot; in Paris , the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development ( OECD ) has its headquarters , but this is less significant for the financial sector than the ECB . &quot;
&quot; the proximity to the central bank is important for banks , as they can communicate directly with the supervision , &quot; says I@@ W @-@ Professor Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder . &quot;
&quot; although Luxembourg conce@@ als a large fund industry , it also cuts the infrastructure worse in the infrastructure . &quot;
Frankfurt is much easier to reach thanks to the large airport .
&quot; in addition , the city has an easily available commercial property . &quot;
&quot; in Paris , it is not so easy to find free high @-@ quality offices , &quot; says Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder . &quot;
&quot; in addition , renting for first @-@ class commercial properties is 50 percent higher than in the Main . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Frankfurt offers a higher quality of life than competition , thanks to good medical care and infrastructure , as well as less crime . &quot;
&quot; in a ranking of the Mer@@ cer &apos;s consultancy Mer@@ cer , the city reached No.@@ 19 , Luxembourg on No.@@ 33 and Paris in 37@@ th place . &quot;
&quot; even if quality of life is a question of preference : &quot; &quot; with its already strong position as a financial location for the European internal market , Frankfurt could attract more banks and investors , &quot; &quot; says the I@@ W . &quot;
&quot; but in spite of Bre@@ x@@ it vote , London will remain the most important financial center in Europe , mean economic researchers . &quot;
&quot; in fact , in London , according numbers of the Landes@@ bank Hel@@ aba in late 2015 , around 14@@ 4000 people worked in the banking sector , in Frankfurt , there were 6@@ 2500 . &quot;
Gilead receives legal costs from the hepatitis C patent dispute with Mer@@ ck
a U.S. Prime Minister decided that Gilead Sciences Inc claims the reimbur@@ sement of legal expenses incurred by the hepatitis C legal dispute with the pharmaceutical company Mer@@ ck &amp; Co Inc .
&quot; in June Gilead was exemp@@ ted from a loss of damages amoun@@ ting to $ 200 million for the infrin@@ gement of two patents of Mer@@ ck , which in connection with the block@@ bu@@ ster drugs so@@ val@@ di and Har@@ von@@ i of Gilead stood after a US judge covered a pattern of mis@@ conduct by mer@@ cks , including Mein@@ ei@@ des and other in@@ ethical actions . &quot;
&quot; when collecting the complaint on Thursday , U.S. Secretary of Beth Lab@@ son Fre@@ eman said that Gilead is entitled to decree of the expenses incurred during the defense of the case . &quot;
&quot; Mer@@ ck tries to equi@@ p with Gilead , which domin@@ ates the market of a new generation of hepatitis C medicines , which can heal more than 90 percent of patients with liver disease . &quot;
&quot; the case goes back to 2013 , as Gilead and Mer@@ ck took possession of each other and took possession of laboratory work that sof@@ os@@ co@@ vir impl@@ ements , the active ingredient in the drugs of Gilead . &quot;
&quot; by the United States , troops supported that they have recovered complete control of Man@@ bi@@ j from the Islamic State . &quot;
&quot; troops supported by the US have conquered full control of the northern city of Man@@ bi@@ j near the Turkish border , after the last IS fighters in the city left them , a spokes@@ man of the group on Friday . &quot;
&quot; the Democratic Forces of Syria ( D@@ KS ) , after the extract of the remaining group of fighters who have buried himself within the city , are currently the city . &quot;
&quot; they have liber@@ ated over 2,000 civilians that were held as host@@ ages by the fighters , shared Shar@@ fan Dar@@ wish of the Man@@ bi@@ j military council Reu@@ ters with the D@@ KS . &quot;
&quot; the city is now under perfect control , but we just run clean@@ up work , &quot; he told Reu@@ ters . &quot;
Clin@@ tons earn 10.@@ 75 million in 2015 and pay 34.@@ 2 % federal taxes
&quot; Hill@@ ary Clinton published its fiscal declaration on Friday for 2015 , which resulted in the presidential candidate of the Democrats and her husband an income of USD 10.@@ 75 million and an effective federal tax rate of 34.@@ 2 % . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 , the Clinton Foundation donated USD 1 million for charity purposes , mainly to the Clinton Foundation ; the former Secretary of State Bill Clinton generated an income of USD 3 million by the publisher Simon &amp; Schu@@ ster for their book on their office in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs . &quot;
&quot; Clinton &apos;s candidate for Vice @-@ Pres@@ idency , Sen@@ ator Tim KA@@ INE from Virginia , published his tax statements of the last ten years along with his wife Anne Hol@@ ton . &quot;
they paid an effective federal tax rate of 20.@@ 3 % in 2015 .
&quot; Hill@@ ary Clinton and Tim KA@@ INE continue to set standards regarding financial transparency , &quot; &quot; gave Clin@@ ton &apos;s campaign assistant Jennifer Pal@@ mier@@ i in an opinion . &quot;
&quot; in a stark contrast , Donald Tru@@ mp hi@@ des behind false exc@@ uses and re@@ trac@@ ts in relation to his previous promises to publish his tax declar@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; it is common for US presidential candidates to publish their tax declar@@ ations , although they are not obliged to do so by law . &quot;
&quot; Tru@@ mp , a New York business@@ man , and his lawyers have stated a tax review by tax authorities as a reason for his ref@@ usal . &quot;
&quot; they are on the train , &quot; Clinton &apos;s election campaign Ian Sam@@ s wrote on Twitter regarding the release of the presidential candidate for democr@@ ats . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , Michael Coh@@ en , Tru@@ mps Special Ad@@ visor , said to CN@@ N that he would not allow Tru@@ mp to publish something before the controls are not completed . &quot;
&quot; the Republi@@ can presidential candidate of 2012 Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney , among other things , have already announced that his ref@@ usal raises questions regarding assets , his donations for charity organizations , his business aries and various other connections , especially with Russia . &quot;
Clinton has already thrown himself on the subject and published a video on the Internet in the high ranking Republi@@ can Tru@@ mp to publish his tax declaration .
&quot; on Thursday , she spoke the subject even during a speech to the economy in Michigan . &quot;
he ref@@ uses to do what every other presidential candidate has done over the last decades and to publish its tax declar@@ ations . &quot; she said to the crowd .
&quot; POL@@ IT@@ ICO has reported that Tru@@ mp paid no or very little taxes during the 1990s , and a business journalist for the New York Times quoted a number of tax lawyers and tax consultants that indicate that this could still be the case . &quot;
federal taxes have become a subject in the election campaign .
&quot; Clinton supports a regulation named after the billi@@ on@@ aire and investor War@@ ren Buff@@ ett , which would make sure people pay more than USD 1 million a tax rate of at least 30 % . &quot;
President Obama also supports the proposal .
&quot; during an election campaign for Hill@@ ary Clinton last week in O@@ ma@@ ha , Neb@@ ras@@ ka called for Buff@@ ett , whose Ber@@ k@@ shire H@@ ath@@ away developed an industrial con@@ glomer@@ ate here , Tru@@ mp a meeting to exchange their tax declar@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; Buff@@ ett said he had also been subjected to a tax testing of IR@@ S and Tru@@ mp have &quot; &quot; fear &quot; &quot; in front of the vot@@ ers and not from tax authorities . &quot;
Clinton &apos;s campaign has released tax return until 2007 .
&quot; the Clin@@ tons , which now live in Ch@@ app@@ aqu@@ a , New York , paid an effective federal tax rate of approx . 32 % between 2007 and 2014 and an effective combined tax rate of approx . 4@@ 0.5 % . &quot;
&quot; the fiscal declaration of the Clin@@ tons of 2015 showed that these only USD 100 of their income were referred to as wages , unlike most of all Americans . &quot;
&quot; their main investment was a cost @-@ effective index fund , from which the Clin@@ tons divi@@ den@@ ds and income of USD 109@@ .000 were stored . &quot;

&quot; con@@ doms with Chi@@ li@@ pu@@ der , fire@@ works promote Tanz@@ ani@@ as elephant protection &quot;
conserv@@ ation@@ ists in Tanzania use an un@@ orthodo@@ x way to stop eleph@@ ants from being inhabited settlements - they throw con@@ doms on them that are filled with chi@@ li@@ pu@@ des .
&quot; the method has proved to be effective and the Honey@@ guide Foundation , who already had the idea for years , has intensi@@ fied their funding together with the US natural protection , to use a non @-@ violent four @-@ step method to protect their homes and harvest without hur@@ ting animals . &quot;
&quot; before , many spe@@ ar have used to defend themselves . &quot;
Friday is a World &apos;s Day dedicated to animal protection .
&quot; since we have developed this ... Tool@@ kit , we were able to observe a change in their attitude within these churches , whereby they are much more confident that they could keep the eleph@@ ants from their fields without har@@ ming the elephant , &quot; &quot; expressed the directors of Honey@@ guide Dam@@ ian Bell in a message . &quot;
the first two steps include lighting of the elephant with a tor@@ ch and the bub@@ bles into a horn .
&quot; if it is not deter@@ red , a so @-@ called &quot; &quot; Chi@@ li@@ wol@@ ke &quot; &quot; is thrown . &quot;
&quot; Chi@@ li@@ pu@@ der mixed with earth is packed together with a fire@@ work body into a con@@ dom , whose end is shot to the ignition lock only . &quot;
&quot; when it is lit , the con@@ dom burst with a b@@ ang and spr@@ inkle fine dust on chi@@ li@@ pu@@ des into the air . &quot;
a hint is usually already out to hunt the elephant .
&quot; one last possibility is a thro@@ wer , which sho@@ ots a gold fire fire@@ works into the air and causes a loud , light explosion . &quot;
city council decided unanim@@ ously : no ki@@ osk building at St. Go@@ ar@@ er Rhein@@ u@@ fer
&quot; normally , the St. Go@@ ar@@ er &apos;s investment plans are taking place with K@@ us@@ sh@@ and - but especially the retail in the core city is considered to be significantly out@@ dated . &quot;
&quot; on the request for the new construction of a sales ski area at the Rhein@@ u@@ fer in the immediate vicinity of the Rhine bal@@ lo@@ ons , the city council now le@@ an@@ ed unanim@@ ously . &quot;
&quot; as a matter of principle , we welcome new tra@@ ders , but at this location in an exposed location on the banks of the Rhine , this ki@@ osk does not fit , &quot; explained Michael Hu@@ br@@ ath for the CD@@ U Group . &quot;
Jewish director breaks Berlin hotel because Israeli pres@@ election was removed after &quot; Arab &quot; so@@ lic@@ itation - RT News
&quot; a French director with Jewish roots unle@@ ashed a Media Watch , after reve@@ aling that the Kemp@@ inski B@@ rist@@ ol Hotel in Berlin had not listed an Israeli pres@@ election since it had requested Arabic guests according to an employee . &quot;
&quot; Claude Lanz@@ mann , author of the Holocaust documentary &quot; Sho@@ ah &quot; gave his anger at the Kemp@@ inski B@@ rist@@ ol Hotel in Berlin , writing an open letter to the German newspaper FA@@ Z . &quot;
during his last visit Lanz@@ mann tried to find Israel on the country list of the hotel .
&quot; however , the country was not listed among the countries which can be inv@@ oked directly from the hotel room . &quot;
&quot; how is it possible in 2016 in Berlin , the capital of the new Germany , possible that Israel was eliminated and deleted ? &quot;
wrote Lanz@@ mann .
&quot; instead , the Kemp@@ ink@@ si B@@ rist@@ ol offers a possibility to choose Israel via its own call center . &quot;
&quot; after an explanation , the director addressed the hotel reception . &quot;
&quot; the answer he received there , &quot; shock@@ ed him , &quot; as Lanz@@ mann wrote . &quot;
the hotel requested that the measure was a &quot; deliber@@ ate decision of the management of the Kemp@@ inski Hotel . &quot;
&quot; the reason behind it , the director dissolved even more fur@@ y . &quot;
&quot; the majority of our guests are Arabs and they have demanded that the pre @-@ election is deleted , &quot; the Staff of Lanz@@ mann was cited . &quot;
&quot; the Israeli ambassador in Germany Y@@ ak@@ ov Ha@@ das @-@ Handels@@ man called this a &quot; great shame , &quot; reports the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung . &quot;
we were horri@@ fied and troubled by this event .
this is really very sham@@ eful .
the fact that this has borne in Germany in exactly this hotel chain is even an even bigger dis@@ grace .
this does not require any explanation .
&quot; we expect the hotel to draw the right conclusions , &quot; said the minister . &quot;
the incident triggered a pretty big response on the internet in which people called the whole a sc@@ andal .
&quot; some subordin@@ ated to the Kemp@@ inski Hotel , that there was the alleged &quot; &quot; inv@@ itations of Arab guests &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; be ashamed , &quot; &quot; was it in another contribution , in which it was pointed out that the hotel , which is located on the class@@ y Kur@@ für@@ st@@ end@@ amm , is near a synagogue . &quot;
&quot; the hotel quickly showed any accus@@ ations of herself and called the incident a &quot; &quot; failure &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; exc@@ used &quot; &quot; at Lanz@@ mann , reports Der Spiegel . &quot;
&quot; there was never a direct statement , &quot; &quot; Israel did not enter into the quick selection list , &quot; &quot; the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung cited a spokes@@ man of the Kemp@@ inski Hotel . &quot;
added that the country code is now added .
police puts tear gas &amp; rubber floors against prot@@ esting Brazilian students
&quot; on Thursday , students gathered in the Brazilian city of Sa@@ o Paulo with the police when they assembled to demonstrate against the reforms of the government for the public education system . &quot;
the police put tear gas and rubber floors against prot@@ esters .
&quot; the difficulties began when police officers tried to disper@@ se the students , which led to the police Gum@@ mig@@ esch@@ osse and Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as . &quot;
several hundred students participated in the demonstrations in order to express their const@@ ern@@ ation over the plans .
&quot; according to the Gover@@ nor of the Federal State Sa@@ o Paulo Ger@@ aldo Al@@ ck@@ min , some less than 100 public schools are closed , while 300,000 students are converted to save money . &quot;
some of the participants watched Gra@@ ff@@ i@@ tits against the provis@@ ional president Michel Tem@@ er on walls .
&quot; the most recent protests occurred several days after prot@@ esters went to streets to support the suspended President Dil@@ ma Rous@@ se@@ ff , who had been dismis@@ sed from the office by a vote of the Senate . &quot;
trade between Russia and Iran suddenly rises to 71 % - RT Business
&quot; according to the Russian ambassador in Iran , Lev@@ an D@@ zh@@ ag@@ ar@@ yan , the trade fair between Moscow and T@@ eher@@ an grew by 7@@ 0.9 per cent . &quot;
&quot; since the international sanctions were lifted against Iran , interest in Russian companies grew strongly in businesses in the country , shared the ambassador . &quot;
Russian enterprises take existing connections with Iran while new companies are ready to access the market .
&quot; of course , further trading expansion is one of the biggest priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran , &quot; said D@@ zh@@ ag@@ ar@@ yan . &quot;
he noted that the trade turnover between Russia and Iran in the first five months of the year 2016 increased by 7@@ 0.9 per cent compared to the same period in 2015 and $ 8@@ 56 million .
&quot; in particular , Russian imports rose by 9@@ 1.5 percent in Iran and amounted to $ 697 million . &quot;
Russian imports from Iran rose by 16 percent to $ 158 million .
&quot; the trade break was reached by deliveries of machinery , land vehicles and weapons , &quot; &quot; said the ambassador . &quot;
&quot; for this year , D@@ zh@@ ag@@ ar@@ yan goes out of a record number of Iranian tourists in Russia . &quot;
&quot; last year , the Russian foreign representative issued some 35@@ ,000 Vis@@ as , primarily travel visa , Iranian citizens . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Iran reached the top 20 of the countries , which concerns the number of tourists in Russia . &quot;
&quot; one could say that the record numbers of Iranian tourists in Russia last year will be broken , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , only relatively few Russians are visiting Iran , something from which the ambassador hopes that it will change . &quot;
&quot; I personally can recommend visiting the cities of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Shi@@ ra@@ z and Y@@ az@@ d who have received the monuments of the old Persian civilization in a good state , &quot; he said . &quot;
witnesses wanted : drink market in forest cru@@ de oil
a rob@@ ber@@ y incident has been done on Thursday evening on the beverage market of Re@@ we XXL at the Wald@@ br@@ ö@@ ler Ger@@ ber@@ straße .
&quot; under reservation of a fire@@ arm , three dark dressed people , who had m@@ um@@ ed their faces , were then depos@@ ited by the staff of the drink market the issu@@ ing of cash and then fled at first on foot and then probably with a silver @-@ colored VW Golf . &quot;
&quot; how much money was captured , the police do not share . &quot;
&quot; the perpet@@ rators should have been between 1,@@ 60 and 1.@@ 70 meters , so relatively small . &quot;
the beverage market is accessible from the parking deck of the Re@@ we market and can be viewed poor@@ ly .
&quot; the perpet@@ rators must be sc@@ anned in the direction of Ger@@ ber@@ straße , Friedrich @-@ Engel@@ bert @-@ Weg and escaped from the gravel @-@ car park located opposite the Park@@ haus@@ ein@@ fahrt , possibly in direction B 256 ( Schla@@ der@@ n@@ ring ) . &quot;
&quot; whoever has made observations at the time ( against 19.@@ 45 ) observations , which are related to the rob@@ ber@@ y fall , should strongly notify the police . &quot;
Nag@@ old : games and fun during summer@@ time
&quot; eight beautiful and happy days spent the children and young people of the social ped@@ agog@@ ical day group / social group work of the Kinder@@ schutz@@ liga in Nuss@@ dorf , near Mühl@@ acker . &quot;
in the seclu@@ ded Frei@@ zei@@ theim Hard@@ tw@@ äl@@ dle the life @-@ joy@@ ful group was quartered during the first school holiday week .
several full day trips stood on the program .
&quot; on the one hand , we went to Bret@@ ten with the visit of the &quot; &quot; Streich@@ el@@ z@@ oos &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; on the other hand to Maul@@ bron@@ n , where there was a special chil@@ d@@ bearing in the world @-@ famous monastery . &quot;
the third trip led to P@@ for@@ z@@ heim .
&quot; in the Kel@@ ten@@ museum in Hoch@@ dorf , the group learned a lot about everyday life and the food of the Cel@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; during the hot days , the group enjoyed the deep sea in Maul@@ bron@@ n , which invited jumping , swimming and planning . &quot;
&quot; children and super@@ vis@@ ors were treated with their self @-@ prepared cour@@ iers such as the Sau@@ ren Sp@@ ätz@@ le , the Seeb@@ ron@@ ner Pf@@ än@@ n@@ le , I@@ sel@@ sh@@ aus@@ er @-@ Blo@@ ff , the English @-@ Breakfast and T@@ üb@@ inger Bolog@@ n@@ ese . &quot;
&quot; workshops were born , creating beautiful jewels of pearls and stones or made of wood a Roman mill game . &quot;
&quot; further highlights of leisure time were fishing in a nearby pond , the evenings at the fire and the final &quot; &quot; Bun@@ te E@@ ven@@ ing &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the day of the voyage home laugh@@ ed the sun and the children and young people returned home .
Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch : pilgrims to the gate of mercy
the regi@@ stran@@ ts from the pastoral care unit Ey@@ acht@@ al @-@ Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch of St. Anna were on the way on a four @-@ day pilgrimage from Vill@@ ingen to Freiburg .
&quot; together , four stages were accomplished . &quot;
&quot; in order to bridge the time to the next pilgrimage of all the mini@@ stries in two years , the first round of St. Anna has decided to prepare and carry out a multi @-@ day pilgrimage . &quot;
&quot; various pilgrimage destinations were examined and we finally decided for the Bischo@@ fs@@ stadt Freiburg , where in this year the Holy Year of Mer@@ cy was given a special pilgrimage destination during the Holy Year of Charity . &quot;
&quot; 16 Min@@ is from B@@ itt@@ el@@ bron@@ n , Gru@@ ol , Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch and Heiligen@@ zimmern were on the way . &quot;
&quot; in the evening before , Par@@ ish Stor@@ ost sent pilgrims in a small celebration in St. Anna , blessed the Pil@@ gri@@ mage and told the Pil@@ gri@@ ms . &quot;
&quot; from H@@ orb it was driven by train to the starting point Vill@@ ingen , where also a minster of Our Lady is standing and so the pilgrimage route from Münster has joined . &quot;
&quot; each day tours were surrounded by a short impulse with various prayers , songs and texts in the morning and in the evening . &quot;
&quot; but also on the way , the mines of Feld@@ cross@@ roads , chap@@ els or churches repeatedly made rest to sing together a song of specially composed pilgri@@ m song . &quot;
the parish halls of the local parish priests were at their disposal for the nights .
&quot; at the stage destinations , Alexandra Burk@@ hardt and Hei@@ di F@@ aller ensured a tasty and delicious dinner and breakfast . &quot;
on the second day we went over Fur@@ tw@@ angen to Gü@@ ten@@ bach .
&quot; the day after St. Peter , which was the most stren@@ uous route , had to desc@@ end at first about 500 metres in height and then climb@@ ed again . &quot;
the deser@@ ved reward was in the evening a common barbecue on the lake .
&quot; after the morning impulse on the fourth day of pilgrimage in the impressive monastery church of St. Peter , we went to Freiburg . &quot;
&quot; visi@@ bly reli@@ eved and happy the Min@@ is arrived at the Freiburg Münster in the late afternoon , passing through the gate of mercy . &quot;
with a small impulse God was given thanks to God .
Min@@ is was welcomed by Ko@@ operator Markus O@@ bert in the evening mass in Münster .
&quot; after the divine service , pilgrims could visit the sac@@ rist@@ y and the high altar . &quot;
the next day was still time for the B@@ reis@@ gau metropolis .
in the afternoon we went by train to H@@ orb .
&quot; at the end , all participants agreed that the days of spirituality and a strong community experience were shaped . &quot;
Scot@@ sman Call@@ um Sk@@ inner rus@@ hes home when Br@@ ite Gold achieved for cycling
Scotland &apos;s Call@@ um Sk@@ inner last evening in the men &apos;s team Sprint in Vel@@ od@@ rom in Rio for fame as the British team def@@ ended the title of London 2012 .
&quot; the 23 @-@ year @-@ old from Glasgow took the anchor role , which his comp@@ atri@@ ot Sir Chris Ho@@ y had made himself to E@@ igen . &quot;
England claimed a shock@@ ing victory four years ago while Ho@@ y won the fifth of six Olympic gold medals .
they repeated the trick after they took place in March at the World Championships in London despite the withdrawal Ho@@ ys only a modest sixth place .
the problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the driver Jamie Staff .
they did this in time as execution .
Ho@@ ys retirement has created a gap that Ki@@ an Em@@ adi and Matt Cr@@ amp@@ ton tried to close .
&quot; Sk@@ inner was the man in whom they stayed , when they saw potential in the vill@@ i that has now un@@ folded . &quot;
&quot; Hin@@ des , Kenn@@ y - who prev@@ ailed four years ago with Ho@@ y - and Sk@@ inner won a Olympi@@ ad in the qualification rounds , but in the stand@@ ari@@ sts the New Ze@@ al@@ anders won in the first round . &quot;
and the British trio won the Du@@ el with gold .
&quot; after his lap he came back shortly , but Kenn@@ y brought the team forward and Sk@@ inner thought it . &quot;
&quot; a change of strategy made a large part of the transformation , when exec@@ uting it in a higher gear to slow down it and make it Kenn@@ y and especially Sk@@ inner to keep pace . &quot;
&quot; Ho@@ y looked out from his position as BBC expert , and he liked Sk@@ inner , Kenn@@ y and Hin@@ des , when they got on the podium . &quot;
the 23 @-@ year @-@ old Sk@@ inner from Glasgow said : &quot; it is a fl@@ atter@@ ing comparison . &quot;
I am just here to do my best and make a name for me .
in the final round we set up a Olympi@@ ar@@ ec@@ ord and defeated the world champion .
it was just unbelievable .
there is no better way to win this .
after the triumph in 2012 on the Kenn@@ ys and Ho@@ ys there was Hin@@ des that he fell to the train after a weak start .
he with@@ drew this statement later and there was no obj@@ ection of England ri@@ vals .
&quot; with such a phenom@@ enal victory , this time there was no such problem . &quot;
&quot; he said : &quot; &quot; it feels like the whole GB flags on the tri@@ b@@ une like London . &quot;
we have come together as a team over the past three months .
we did so badly with so many world titles that it was incredible to win back at the Olympics .
&quot; this is an event , a gold medal for the nation , the seven out of 10 titles , both in Beijing and in London . &quot;
&quot; if that &apos;s a bar@@ ometer of our progress in the last five months , we expect successful five days in the Vel@@ od@@ rom . &quot;
&quot; with the shape Kenn@@ y , it is in the realm of the possibility that he repeated Ho@@ ys victory of three Olympic gold medals in a competition . &quot;
&quot; that would be for Kenn@@ y - who was exactly 12 years younger than Ho@@ y , who was also born on March 23 ( a seemingly holy date for British sports ; on the day Steve Red@@ grave , Mo Far@@ ah and Roger Ban@@ ni@@ ster were born ) - a yield of six gold medals and a silver medal . &quot;
the che@@ et@@ ah of Ho@@ y was the same .
Kenn@@ y takes part in the spr@@ int that starts today and will go over three days .
the 28 @-@ year @-@ old from Bol@@ ton said : &quot; I enjoy this just for the moment . &quot;
the team event is always best .
you can win it with his colleagues .
it feels lon@@ ely to win alone .
&quot; he said , &quot; If he wins two more gold medals , he should be beaten to the k@@ night . &quot;
&quot; it was the only medal competition of the day , but there were other good news for England . &quot;
&quot; Sir Bra@@ dly W@@ ig@@ gins , Ed C@@ lan@@ cy , Steven Bur@@ ke and Ow@@ ain Dou@@ ll qualified with the fastest performance in four @-@ four kilometer races . &quot;
they arrived in 3 : 5@@ 1.9@@ 42 at the finish .
&quot; the world record , who won gold in 2012 in London , was at 3 : 5@@ 1,6@@ 59 . &quot;
&quot; the first and final round ( 22.@@ 42 ) will be held on the second day of the competition , where W@@ ig@@ gins will focus on security . &quot;
&quot; he had argu@@ ed yesterday with commission@@ ers before the qualification , when officials called him to measure his height . &quot;
&quot; in the corresponding women &apos;s competition , which will be continued and ended tomorrow , Laura Trot@@ t , Jo@@ anna Row@@ sell Sh@@ and , E@@ lin@@ or Bar@@ ker and K@@ atie Archi@@ bald of Mil@@ n@@ g@@ avi@@ e in world record time in 4 : 13,@@ 260 . &quot;
the UK team relies on his strong rail team to domin@@ ate the middle period of the Olympic Games and get a band of medals .
&quot; after a truly extraordinary display of absolute domin@@ ance in Beijing and London , the expectations for Rio were shut down . &quot;
&quot; drama was played in the background , so the res@@ ign@@ ation of the technical director Sh@@ ane S@@ ut@@ ton in April in the middle of sex@@ is@@ mus@@ - and mut@@ ob@@ b@@ ing@@ repro@@ aches as well as retirement of sizes such as Ho@@ y and Victoria Pend@@ let@@ on . &quot;
&quot; however , if one sees the first evening of the competition in the Vel@@ od@@ rom , it looks like the now legendary reputation GB@@ s , which reached its peak at the perfect moment , will be repeated again . &quot;
future of the dairy from Port@@ land due to the ab@@ olition of the energy demand question@@ able
&quot; the future of aluminium mel@@ ts from Port@@ land in Victoria - as well as hundreds of work@@ places of workers - stand at stake , as the system operator will termin@@ ate the energy supply contract and thereby lift all delivery contracts , such as the supplying energy companies . &quot;
&quot; this step was followed by the government &apos;s decision in Victoria at the beginning of this year , no further subsidies for the operation of the plant . &quot;
a subsi@@ dy established for 20 years runs in November .
up to 2000 jobs in the plant of Alco@@ a in Port@@ land are at stake .
no less than 2000 jobs -@@ direct as well as indirect - could be threatened with closure .
&quot; in addition , it could come to dom@@ ino effects , as the melting shop consum@@ es around 10 percent of the total power generation of Vict@@ ori@@ as . &quot;
&quot; in 2014 , Alco@@ a closed the Point Henry Schmel@@ zer@@ ei , which led to a closure of the Angl@@ es@@ ea power station last year . &quot;
the melt of Alco@@ a in Port@@ land loses money and risks a closure .
&quot; this step follows the years of spec@@ ulation with regard to the future of the plant , originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar and last due to the electricity price for the plant . &quot;
&quot; AG@@ L , which supplies the large aluminium mel@@ ding with its Lo@@ y Yang A power plant in Lat@@ robe Valley , shared that three more owners will announce their contracts . &quot;
&quot; the facility is owned by a joint venture of Alco@@ a and Al@@ um@@ ina , of which the Chinese company C@@ IT@@ IC and Japanese Mar@@ u@@ ben@@ i Cor@@ p hold smaller portions . &quot;
&quot; AG@@ L assumes that the plant continues to operate in Port@@ land , which means another physical demand for electricity through the melting process , &quot; said the company . &quot;
&quot; AG@@ L continued to say that the contracts were so @-@ called &quot; &quot; securing business &quot; , &quot; which should have entered into force since November 2016 . &quot;
&quot; the contracts have a 12 @-@ month period of notice , so that they will end in 2017 . &quot;
&quot; hence AG@@ L assumes that the contracts in the financial year 17 will contribute to revenue , &quot; said the supplier . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
AG@@ L reported that the value of the contracts is already written in its annual financial statements amoun@@ ting to $ 187 million in anticip@@ ation of a termination .
&quot; Alco@@ a said that the decision to withdraw the contracts , the &quot; ability of Alco@@ a ... to operate the melt or to ensure the power supply to the melt &quot; is not imp@@ aired . &quot;
&quot; the US company said it had concluded a 20 @-@ year contract with Lo@@ y Yang , who should have entered into force from November this year , even if there is still an explanation , why it has res@@ igned from the contract . &quot;
&quot; due to the poor economic conditions of the industry , analysts warn of the potential closure of the Port@@ land Schmel@@ zer@@ ei in Victoria and the Tom@@ ago plant near New@@ castle . &quot;
&quot; in reference to the analysis of the analysts at the beginning of the week , the Head of Operations Stephen Mik@@ kel@@ sen said that Port@@ land consume around 600 meg@@ a@@ watts and Tom@@ ago around 900 meg@@ a@@ watts per year . &quot;
&quot; should both systems disappear from the market , this would mean a significant reduction in demand on the &#91; electricity market &#93; . &quot;
&quot; and for us as a generator , that would not be good , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; more than just a Kard@@ as@@ hi@@ an Reality @-@ TV @-@ Star , K@@ end@@ all is on the cover of the September edition of the Vo@@ gue &quot;
&quot; k@@ end@@ all J@@ enner , 20 , Model and fourth daughter of the Man@@ ag@@ erin and mother of the Card@@ as@@ hi@@ an @-@ J@@ enner Clan Kr@@ is is on the cover of the cov@@ eted September edition of the US Vo@@ gue . &quot;
&quot; k@@ end@@ all , the brand ambassador of E@@ ste@@ e Lau@@ der and went on the Fashion We@@ eks in Milan , Paris and New York , announced on Thursday the news on their Inst@@ agram account . &quot;
&quot; in a room full of people that I love , the sight of this cover brought me to cry , &quot; K@@ end@@ all wrote . &quot;
&quot; the unvei@@ ling of the cover was followed by a bizar@@ re ( or simply Ke@@ eping Up with the Card@@ as@@ hi@@ ans like ? ) , sc@@ rip@@ ted reality video , which shows the entire Card@@ as@@ hi@@ an J@@ enner family ( with the exception of the problem cases Rob and Ca@@ it@@ ly@@ n ) , as they forget the cover of their sister and that ends with a classic turn : they have all planned a surprise party . &quot;
&quot; this represents the c@@ lich@@ é action almost every birthday party of a children &apos;s show ( Se@@ ac@@ rest brought the sentence , &quot; &quot; You thought that we had forgotten you ? &quot; &quot; with the hon@@ esty of a carto@@ on at 8 o &apos;clock in the morning ) , but Kr@@ is had to let her other girl take part in this publi@@ city . &quot;
&quot; with regard to the September issue of the Vo@@ gue , a new era of Card@@ as@@ hi@@ ans began with certainty . &quot;
&quot; K@@ end@@ alls big sister Kim likes her to have struck the Vo@@ gue cover ( she and her husband K@@ any@@ e West were on it in April 2014 ) , but the cover of the September issue of the magazine is a league for itself . &quot;
the September edition is the most sales edition of the year for Vo@@ gue .
&quot; with a circum@@ ference that resem@@ bles a picture tape rather than a fashion magazine , the output pul@@ ls a large number of advertis@@ ers ( L@@ aut Fas@@ hi@@ on@@ ist@@ a were from the 8@@ 32 pages of the Wäl@@ zer 615 pages advertising ) . &quot;
the unvei@@ ling of his cover@@ star will be awa@@ ited so long that in the last two years pictures of the magazine still le@@ ak@@ age before the official announcement .
&quot; women who were already on the cover include Na@@ omi Camp@@ bell , Linda Evangel@@ ist@@ a and Kate Mos@@ s . &quot;
&quot; in recent years there were clearly more &quot; celeb@@ ri@@ ties that are model@@ ed &quot; as &quot; models , the celeb@@ ri@@ ties are &quot; on the cover . &quot;
&quot; Oscar prize @-@ winner and Di@@ or brand ambassador Jennifer Lawrence was in 2013 on the cover , a year after Lady G@@ aga had the honour . &quot;
&quot; but even at the low chance that Mrs. J@@ enner , which is described by the magazine as the &quot; breakthrough model &quot; of its generation - is under the former category , it is in good company . &quot;
these celeb@@ ri@@ ties are not related to famous persons or reality stars or young@@ sters of today who know how to rotate a good snap@@ chat video ( even if it all applies to separ@@ ators ) .
they are really talented women who draw themselves in the entertainment industry .
&quot; Be@@ y@@ once , which appeared on the last cover , had with the release of Lem@@ on@@ ade one of the most successful years of her career . &quot;
&quot; of course , J@@ enn@@ er &apos;s success doesn &apos;t like any success . &quot;
&quot; with her reality TV story , J@@ enn@@ er &apos;s position in the fashion world was always somewhat ten@@ se . &quot;
in June the former Victoria &apos;s Secret @-@ Modell Steph@@ anie Sey@@ m@@ our J@@ enner and her colleague Gig@@ i Ha@@ did cri@@ tici@@ zed her &quot; the Mist@@ resses of the Moment . &quot;
these feelings bo@@ unded high again when the news came out with the appearance J@@ enn@@ ers on the Vo@@ gue Cover .
&quot; but on the contrary , it seems to pass by the point . &quot;
k@@ end@@ all J@@ enner is on the cover of the September edition of the Vo@@ gue .
it is a super@@ model in the tru@@ est sense of the word .
it runs for Marc Jacob@@ s .
it makes advertising for your pri@@ mer by E@@ ste@@ e Lau@@ der .
you and all her sisters sell pictures of themselves on their respective Pay@@ wall apps .
she was sold by her made pictures of C@@ ind@@ y C@@ RA@@ W@@ FOR@@ DS daughter to the magazine LOVE .
and in her free time she is in reality TV . presum@@ ably only to see her sister K@@ our@@ t@@ ney and her children .
congreg@@ ational centres exhibit 16@@ 0,000 people annually . &quot;
&quot; more than 160@@ .000 of the country &apos;s relief documents are rejected by the municipal law centres each year , while the industry refers to the impact of further aver@@ ages on already over@@ loaded transactions . &quot;
&quot; in Que@@ ens@@ land , three out of five people - mostly older people , immigrants , need@@ y workers , victims of violence and those who have no means for un@@ real del@@ og@@ ations and similar ones - were rejected at their request for free legal advice and legal assistance . &quot;
&quot; legal services of the community , which are already over@@ ly exploited , are ready for further cuts . &quot;
&quot; as of June next year , it is planned that these legal centers will lose further 30 percent of their federal funds . &quot;
the director of the Que@@ ener James Far@@ rell community centre said that the last survey of the National Association of municipal law centres revealed that thousands of people had already rejected thousands of people each year .
Far@@ rell said that the situation would only be worse without repe@@ aling the decision of the Federal Government .
&quot; Que@@ ens@@ land congreg@@ ational centres are chron@@ ically under@@ financed , meaning that thousands of people of important services you need are rejected , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; people who leave violent relationships , people with un@@ man@@ age@@ able and op@@ pres@@ sive debts , families , who have been dismis@@ sed by separ@@ ations , workers who have been wron@@ g@@ ly dismis@@ sed - all these people have problems of legal nature and this survey shows that they cannot receive the help they need . &quot;
&quot; as of June 2017 , the Federal Government will shor@@ ten the funds by 30 percent , which means that thousands of aid people from Que@@ ens@@ land will be forced to cope with their legal problems without any help . &quot;
&quot; we call for the general nation@@ alist and federal law minister , as well as Sen@@ ators of Que@@ ens@@ land George Bran@@ dis to promptly cancel these mid@@ ations so that people can get the help they need , in case of legal problems . &quot;
&quot; last year , the State Government fulfilled its commitment to raise funds for legal aid to national average . &quot;
&quot; it is now time to see the needs of the municipal centres and their customer communities , and that the government of Pal@@ as@@ z@@ c@@ zu@@ k has invested in this important work . &quot;
Donald Tru@@ mp El@@ ection Camp@@ aig@@ n indic@@ ted after employee allegedly drew arms
&quot; new York : Donald Tru@@ mps campaign has been indic@@ ted because of alleged in@@ activity , having been told that her campaign leader for North Carolina was a gun weapon on a staff while travelling in a je@@ ep in February . &quot;
&quot; the incident is described in an indictment , which was filed on Wednesday in the Regional Court of Charlotte by Vincent Bord@@ ini , a former software program@@ mer for the campaign in this state . &quot;
&quot; Bord@@ ini gave up to have been waiting for months to have waited for the matter internally , before he realized that &quot; that would not happen . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the campaign leader , Ear@@ l Philip , &quot; pulled a gun , laid his right foref@@ inger on the trigger , and crow@@ ned the run at Vinc@@ ents Kni@@ ek@@ eh@@ le , &quot; Bord@@ ini gave in his accus@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; after having compl@@ ained to the local and regional campaign management , Bord@@ ini noted that at least four more people had the same experience with Phil@@ lip , he admitted in the indictment . &quot;
weapons must not be fired for damage caused by Bord@@ ini .
&quot; the accus@@ ation comes only two days after the Republi@@ can presidential candidate , when he said a crowd in North Carolina , said that the &quot; Second A@@ mend@@ ment People &quot; - should take action if his ri@@ val@@ in Hill@@ ary Clinton should be elected and judge . &quot;
&quot; Tru@@ mps &apos;s campaign clearly emphasized that the media would viol@@ ate his words from the context , and that he would not cont@@ end the violence . &quot;
B@@ ordin@@ is complaint demands compensation from the campaign for violation of due di@@ ligence and by Philip due to bodily injury and permanent mental harm .
bit@@ ing press spokes@@ person Hope H@@ icks was not to be reached for an opinion .
try to contact Philip also failed .
&quot; W@@ C@@ CB , a local news station in Charlotte , reports that Phil@@ lip is no longer staff of the campaign . &quot;
&quot; phone calls at his consulting company , Innovative Consulting Services , has not been re@@ acted . &quot;
the Republi@@ can candidate Donald Tru@@ mp has so far led a controversial campaign .

Berlin / Schwer@@ in : survey before countries elections : lose SPD and CD@@ U
&quot; in the upcoming elections in the federal states of Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern ( September 4 ) and Berlin ( September 18 ) , there are considerable losses for the SPD and CD@@ U ruling party . &quot;
&quot; these are representative surveys of the IN@@ SA opinion research institute for the &quot; &quot; Bild &quot; &quot; newspaper ( Friday ) . &quot;
&quot; while the red @-@ black government coalition in the north could continue to rain , this is not possible after the survey values in Berlin . &quot;
&quot; in both states , the SPD would be the strongest party and would have good chances to continue to head the head of government . &quot;
&quot; in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern , the SPD collap@@ sed from 35.@@ 6 percent five years ago to 24 percent . &quot;
&quot; according to the survey , the party was just under the CD@@ U which could come back to 23 percent . &quot;
the third place is controversial between the left and the Af@@ D .
&quot; the left came to 19 percent ( previously 18.@@ 4 percent ) , the Af@@ D would be represented with 19 percent for the first time in the Land@@ tag . &quot;
&quot; despite slight losses , the Gre@@ ens were rel@@ uc@@ t@@ ant to return to Schwer@@ in Land@@ tag in spite of slight losses ( previously 8.7 percent ) . &quot;
&quot; with 3 percent , N@@ PD and F@@ DP were not represented in the parliament . &quot;
&quot; according to the survey of Berlin , the SPD &apos;s SPD would only come to 23 percent ( election 2011 : 28.@@ 3 percent ) . &quot;
the CD@@ U reached only 18 percent after 23.@@ 4 percent .
&quot; it is still behind the Gre@@ ens with 19 percent ( 2011 : 17,@@ 6 percent ) , but on the left with 15 percent ( previously 11.@@ 7 percent ) . &quot;
&quot; for the first time , Af@@ D would be represented at the Chamber of Dep@@ u@@ ties with 14 percent . &quot;
&quot; with 5 percent , the F@@ DP could hope for a return , the pir@@ ates would miss the move in contrast to 2011 . &quot;
Nokia 9000 Communic@@ ator : the first smartphone
e @-@ mail and internet in slow motion : 20 years ago the Nokia Communic@@ ator came to the market .
the success@@ ors today domin@@ ate the world - his maker experienced a disaster .
the device weigh@@ ed almost half a kil@@ ogram and was more than four times as hard as an iPhone 5 .
&quot; it was th@@ icker and bigger , so it was not good in the hand . &quot;
&quot; on the contrary , it was pretty mu@@ sty . &quot;
&quot; the built @-@ in memory was initially eight meg@@ ab@@ ytes , which would suff@@ ice for about two sel@@ fies with high resolution . &quot;
an iPhone is now supplied with at least 16 gig@@ ab@@ ytes .
&quot; the &quot; Nokia 9000 Communic@@ ator &quot; occurred exactly 20 years ago , on 15 August 1996 , into the shops - and it was the first smartphone . &quot;
&quot; for a few euros , fans can buy the devices still on the Internet , but they somehow come from the one@@ age of the Internet era . &quot;
&quot; 20 years ago , the Communic@@ ator was a sensation . &quot;
the Finnish mobile phone manufacturer had announced the product a few months earlier at the C@@ eb@@ it computer fair in Hanover as an &quot; office in the West Bank format . &quot;
&quot; in fact , the new mobile phone could be sent and received for dam@@ aging standards : SMS and e @-@ mails could be sent and received , even via fax was the Communic@@ ator . &quot;
&quot; even the access to web pages was possible via HTML browser , alb@@ eit slowly . &quot;
&quot; a pocket calcul@@ ator was available , a digital address book and an electronic calendar . &quot;
&quot; there was a small antenna , and the mobile phone could be un@@ folded like a laptop . &quot;
then a small keyboard and a black and white screen found .
&quot; the price : 2700 D @-@ Mark , which is about 1400 euros . &quot;
the average sales price of a smartphone in Germany was 392 euros in 2015 .
no one could guess in August 1996 that the communic@@ ator would become the beginning of the smartphone era .
&quot; since then , everything is different . &quot;
smart phones are a success story if not for Nokia .
&quot; the mobile savings of the Finn@@ s experienced an unprecedented disaster , was eventually sold and handled by Microsoft . &quot;
today the market domin@@ ates vendors who came all much later than Nokia .
&quot; always and everywhere online , this is today for very many people everyday life . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; about 1.4 billion devices sold , on Samsung and Apple alone , accounts for some 555 million units . &quot;
global sales with the equipment is around 400 billion euros .
this includes the well @-@ running business of the countless app providers and telecommunications companies .
&quot; in the meantime , around the smartphone there has been a whole industry . &quot;
&quot; the decisive breakthrough to the mass market came in early 2007 , at that time Apple CEO Steve Jobs announced the launch of the i@@ Ph@@ ones . &quot;
&quot; he promised three devices in one : a musical player , a telephone and an internet communic@@ ator , easy to use by touch screen . &quot;
&quot; the triumph@@ al march of Apple began , even today the iPhone is the most important product of the Group . &quot;
&quot; Nokia , Motorola and Black@@ berry , who ruled the market , had the watch . &quot;
&quot; they finally disappeared , Black@@ berry has to fight . &quot;
the sag@@ as now have Apple and Asian vendors like Samsung .
the smartphone is a matter of course 20 years after its invention .
&quot; on average , every German is now viewing 88 times a day on his mobile phone . &quot;
&quot; we all need to learn to leave the smartphone even once , &quot; said Jan@@ ina Ball , in charge of the Siemens Bureau of Human Resources . &quot;
permanent accessibility is now considered a curse and blessing at the same time .
England must steer the Olympic spirit and expand He@@ a@@ throw
He@@ a@@ throw will not only bring renewal and prosperity to our local communities and throughout London but throughout the country .
&quot; for me , this was the biggest attraction of He@@ a@@ thro@@ ws , just like in 2012 in London when we ran a great effort to make sure that all our nations and regions benefited from the games . &quot;
the Olympi@@ ad brought great benefits for Str@@ at@@ ford and the East End .
and that will be achieved again by creating new opportunities for local residents and companies near He@@ a@@ throw .
&quot; for our local communities alone , we will have 10,000 new apprentic@@ es@@ hips to create 4@@ 0,000 new jobs and put an end to youth unemployment in the airport environment . &quot;
&quot; as they predicted in London 2012 , there will be those who will think that the challenge of enlar@@ ging he@@ a@@ thro@@ ws is too big . &quot;
I was told that England will never be ready for the games and that we will bl@@ am@@ ate ourselves on the world stage .
the two @-@ fl@@ ers had wron@@ g@@ ly in 2012 and they will be wrong even at He@@ a@@ throw .
&quot; there are always obstacles for over@@ coming , but He@@ a@@ throw answers every question asked . &quot;
&quot; like the Olympic Games , He@@ a@@ throw is for many and not for individuals an infrastructure project . &quot;
&quot; expansion is a way to create up to 180@@ ,000 new jobs , £ 211 billion in swe@@ ating growth and to leave a legacy of skills and employment in both the airport and in the whole UK . &quot;
&quot; we have implemented a great team at He@@ a@@ throw , which has implemented a £ 11 billion infrastructure investment programme in time and budget , from T5 - the five years in succession to the world &apos;s best airport terminal , up to T2 , which was built in the middle of the two most frequ@@ ented walk@@ ways in the world . &quot;
&quot; now they are ready to deliver a third cat@@ walk , which is supported by £ 16 billion in private investment . &quot;
the London games of 2012 were a great success for GB and I am confident that He@@ a@@ throw &apos;s expansion will also be one .
&quot; it is time for us to steer this Olympic spirit and expand He@@ a@@ throw , as well as secure our future trade and create a legacy of skills and employment that England can be proud of . &quot;

&quot; Ad@@ block Plus , Facebook in &quot; &quot; K@@ atz @-@ und Maus@@ spiel &quot; &quot; regarding ad blocking &quot;
&quot; for companies that earn money with online advertising , according to one of the software manufacturers attempts to circum@@ vent ad blocking , a &quot; cat and mouse game . &quot; &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , just two days after Facebook announced that it would block indicating adver@@ ts on its desktop side , Ad@@ block Plus released a blo@@ gger if users could update their filters in the program to re @-@ block advertising in the social network . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , Facebook shared that his desktop site would change encoding with regard to his adver@@ ts to make it alert the detection of what part of the page advertising is to be difficult to detect . &quot;
but Ad@@ block announced that it has found a new way to deal with the new codes .
&quot; in a blog post , the spokes@@ man of Ad@@ block Ben Williams wrote that &quot; this kind of H@@ in @-@ and @-@ Her @-@ fight between the attrac@@ ting open source community and the Um@@ geh@@ ern is already underway since the invention of display lock@@ ers , &quot; and that it is possible that Facebook is coming soon with a new solution . &quot;
the fact that the world &apos;s largest social media company has left in the fight is a strong indication of how wor@@ rying displays have become for the industry .
&quot; according to a study from Pa@@ gef@@ air and Adobe , around 200 million people worldwide use advertis@@ ers worldwide , almost four times as much in 2013 . &quot;
&quot; with 1,@@ 03 billion daily active users who access Facebook on their mobile devices , Hand@@ y@@ wer@@ bung makes 84 percent of advertising revenue . &quot;
&quot; apart from the fact that mobile ad block@@ ers have no effect on Facebook &apos;s mobile app for the social network and Inst@@ agram , a spokes@@ man shared with it . &quot;
&quot; advertising on desktop PCs makes a sufficient amount of revenue , so Facebook appears to be the investment of such a step as worthwhile . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , Facebook shared that it would update its &quot; &quot; Ad Pre@@ ference Tool &quot; &quot; to give people more control over them . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , Facebook declared that Ad@@ blocks would be wor@@ rying new filters because they would also block content on the page that are not advertising . &quot;
&quot; for the users , this is not a positive experience , so we plan to address the problem , &quot; said a Facebook spokes@@ person in an e @-@ mail message . &quot;
&quot; ad block@@ ers are a mu@@ te means , which is why we instead focused on developer tools such as Ad Pre@@ ferences in order to put more control into the hands of the people . &quot;
woman suspected of suspected su@@ icide on Swiss highway
the victim was in the middle of the night on the highway .
the police call witnesses after a woman was transferred to a highway in the early morning hours on Thursday with suspected su@@ icide of several cars .
the incident occurred on the A1 near Morges in the canton of V@@ aud shortly after midnight .
&quot; a woman lay down in the dark &quot; &quot; in an act of desp@@ air &quot; &quot; on the streets and were hit by several cars , the police said in V@@ aud . &quot;
&quot; it is obvious that a Swiss at the age of 49 , who was transferred by several vehicles , including a truck , wanted to kill himself . &quot;
she died on the spot .
&quot; several drivers have already been heard , but some are still not identified , the police said that , as well as every witness of the incident promp@@ ted to report . &quot;
&quot; it was opened an investigation process , which is a &quot; logical &quot; step in such a situation , G@@ illes Hof@@ st@@ etter shared the Le Tri@@ b@@ une de Gen@@ eve . &quot;
&quot; however , it remains to be seen whether one of the drivers will be displayed . &quot;
was a clas@@ h avoid@@ able ?
&quot; this is something that the prosec@@ utor has to decide , &quot; &quot; said Hof@@ st@@ etter . &quot;
two similar cases in the last five years show that the drivers will not be held ac@@ coun@@ table .
in each of the two cases - a person in the dark on the highway ran - it was decided that the drivers must not assume that a pedestrian runs in the middle of the night on the highway as it was in the newspaper .
last year a police officer was acqu@@ itted of the neg@@ ligent killing after passing a man and killed a night on the A1 near Pay@@ erne in August 2014 .
&quot; the 22 @-@ year @-@ old sacrifice had drunk , and has become un@@ conscious on the road , the court rejected . &quot;
&quot; the Court found that the police had responded to a call -- to a justified way , and that the presence of a man on the road was a &quot; completely extraordinary and unfor@@ es@@ e@@ eable situation , &quot; said the judge . &quot;
&quot; anyone who has more information on the incident on Thursday near Morges , should contact the police at number 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 83 46 or 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 44 44 . &quot;
NA@@ SA climate model : Venus was once habit@@ able
&quot; according to the proj@@ ections of a new NA@@ SA climate model , Venus was probably inhabit@@ able . &quot;
scientists at Go@@ dd@@ ard Institute for Space Studies at NA@@ SA have developed a model to discover the past of Venus based on tools and algorithms which resem@@ ble those of climate scientists .
&quot; the model has been designed to determine if the Venus with its hot , water@@ less surface and CO2 @-@ dense atmosphere could have been exposed to once @-@ similar conditions . &quot;
scientists have previously indicated that the slow rotation of Venus could be explained by its dense atmosphere .
&quot; but the latest simulation suggests that Venus could have had a thin , er@@ ect @-@ like atmosphere and nevertheless slowly turned on . &quot;
the model also illumin@@ ates the top@@ ography of the early Venus .
&quot; the planet probably had more dry regions than the Earth , but had enough water and geographical vari@@ ability to accommodate lives and protected against ev@@ ap@@ oration . &quot;
the early Venus also benefited from a sun that was 30 percent matter .
&quot; in the ISS model simulation , the slow rotation of the Venus will expose its day@@ time of the Sun for almost two months , &quot; explained G@@ ISS scientists Anthony Del Gen@@ io in a press release . &quot;
&quot; this war@@ ms the surface and produces rain , which creates a thick layer of clouds , which acts like a umbrella to shield the surface from most of the solar heat . &quot;
the result is average temperatures that are some degrees cooler than that of the Earth today .
the model produced a story of Venus that resem@@ bles evolution that was previously assumed by planets .
&quot; although it was presum@@ ably inhabited , Venus was exposed to much heat and ultra@@ violet light in the course of several billion years . &quot;
their oceans were ev@@ apor@@ ated and their water vap@@ or was burned out of ultra@@ violet light .
&quot; as their hydro@@ gene escaped only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide back with a mort@@ al greenhouse effect -- the Venus , which we know today . &quot;
the researchers divided the results of their new Venus climate model in the Ge@@ ophysi@@ cal Research Let@@ ters .
Patrick Roy return as trainer of Aval@@ an@@ che
Patrick Roy came back on Thursday as trainer and Vice President of Hock@@ ey Operations of the Colorado Aval@@ an@@ che and led to a minor co @-@ determination in the decision process of the team .
&quot; alternatively , President / General Manager of the Color@@ ados Joe Sak@@ ic confirmed this decision and noticed that the club will be immediately looking for a new coach . &quot;
&quot; over the past three years I have fulfilled my duties as head trainer and Vice President Of Hock@@ ey Operations of Colorado Aval@@ an@@ che with energy , passion and determination , &quot; the 50 @-@ year @-@ old Roy expressed himself in an opinion . &quot;
&quot; during the summer , I have been thinking about how I could improve this team to give him more depth , needed and to bring it to a higher level . &quot;
&quot; in order to achieve this , the trainer and vice president of hock@@ ey operations must perfectly match the organisation . &quot;
he must also have a co @-@ determination in decisions that influence the performance of the team .
these conditions are currently not met .
&quot; Sak@@ ic , who had hired Roy on 23 May 2013 , thank@@ ed him for his contributions to the team . &quot;
&quot; Patrick informed me about this decision today , &quot; &quot; said Sak@@ ic . &quot;
we appreciate all that he has done for our organization and wish him the best for the future .
Roy was awarded the best trainer in the league during his debut season at the Aval@@ an@@ ches 2013 @-@ 14 as the winner of the Jack Adams Award .
&quot; he led the club to 112 points and in the first place in Central Vision , but Colorado was hit in the first round of the pla@@ yo@@ ffs of Minn@@ es@@ ota and missed the low season in each of the last two years . &quot;
the Aval@@ an@@ ches awarded a 39 @-@ 39 @-@ 4 brand in the 2015 @-@ 16 season and fell short of five points behind the game for a second spot spot in the Western Conference .
&quot; as Hall of F@@ ame Tor@@ wart , Roy won four Stan@@ ley C@@ ups -- two pieces with the Montreal Can@@ adi@@ ens and the Aval@@ an@@ che . &quot;
&quot; Nor@@ des@@ ee@@ pers will take talks again , put strikes out of &quot;
&quot; labour struggles for the remun@@ eration for North @-@ sea @-@ oil workers are exposed , while all the conflic@@ ting parties set themselves at the table for a new round of discussions , said negoti@@ ators . &quot;
&quot; strikes against the oil field service provider Wood Group were spor@@ adi@@ cally carried out on platforms in the North Sea , operated by Royal Dutch Shell . &quot;
&quot; wood Group as well as the Un@@ ite and R@@ MT trade unions can confirm that we have agreed to re @-@ start the process of process of the current strike , &quot; says it in a common statement . &quot;
we will keep some full @-@ day sessions in the coming weeks that will start the beginning of next year to restart the problems .
&quot; the unions said that their last strike , which is the first in over 25 years , is a protest against possible wage cuts of up to 30 percent . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;

Ke@@ pler measures the rot@@ ational rate of stars in the star @-@ pile of the P@@ lei@@ ades
the latest mission with the Ke@@ pler space teles@@ cope has helped astronom@@ ers to collect the most complete catalogue of rotation rates among the stars of the con@@ stellation of the P@@ lei@@ ades .
the new data will help astronom@@ ers understand why stars in the star cluster rotate to different rates as well as in which context the rot@@ ational periods with the planetary creation stand .
&quot; we hope that by comparing our results with other star@@ ters , we learn more about the relationship between the mass of a star , age and even the history of his solar system , &quot; said Lu@@ isa Reb@@ ull , a researcher at the Cal@@ tech &apos;s Infr@@ ared Processing and Analysis Center in Pas@@ ad@@ ena , in a press release . &quot;
the star @-@ pile of the P@@ lei@@ ades is 445 light years away from the earth .
&quot; many stars in this cluster , which arose around 125 million years ago , reach adul@@ thood now . &quot;
they are now turning to the fastest .
&quot; to peak rot@@ ational rates , these gri@@ pping stars come from large amounts of star@@ vation . &quot;
&quot; since these winds travel through the magnetic fields of the stars , they have a slow@@ ing effect on the stars . &quot;
&quot; when a star fails , its rotation rate begins to slow down . &quot;
Ke@@ pler measures the rotation rate of each star by recogni@@ zing the time between the appearance of a recogni@@ zable star triangle -- like sun@@ spots -- .
the latest catalogue of rotation rates indicates that more mas@@ si@@ vere stars turn more slowly than a few massive stars .
&quot; Reb@@ ull compar@@ es the stars with dancers , with larger stars slow pi@@ rou@@ ettes as smaller ones . &quot;
&quot; in the &quot; Ballet &quot; of the P@@ lei@@ ades , we see that slow rot@@ ors tend to be massive , whereas faster rot@@ ors tend to be very bright stars , &quot; Reb@@ ull said . &quot;
&quot; since the star @-@ pile of the P@@ lei@@ ades is so close , it serves as an ideal cosmic laboratory to compare stell@@ ar qualities such as rot@@ ational rates . &quot;
&quot; the star @-@ pile of the P@@ lei@@ ades offers an anchor for theoretical models of the stell@@ ar rotation in both directions , younger and older , &quot; said Reb@@ ull . &quot;
&quot; it is still much ahead of us what we would like to know more about how , when and why stars slow down their rotation rates and so to speak their &quot; &quot; dancing shoes &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in three newspaper reports , Reb@@ ull and her colleagues have reported in detail about their latest analysis of the rot@@ ational rates of the P@@ lei@@ ades , which will soon be published in the Astronom@@ ical Journal . &quot;
a controversial bas@@ eb@@ all star occurs
the tears ran with Alex Rodri@@ gu@@ ez faster than the US bas@@ eb@@ all star in the best days from Base to Base .
&quot; after his emotional return announcement , the 41 @-@ year @-@ old professional will be wearing the Tri@@ k@@ ot of his New York Yan@@ ke@@ es on August 12 against the T@@ amp@@ a Bay R@@ ays . &quot;
&quot; I love this game and this team . &quot;
&quot; I say &apos; good@@ bye &apos; to both , &quot; explained the 14 @-@ mal@@ icious All @-@ Star @-@ Game @-@ Particip@@ ant of the Major League Bas@@ eb@@ all ( ML@@ B ) . &quot;
&quot; three times , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez was elected the most valuable player in the league , in 2009 he won the World Series with the Yan@@ ke@@ es . &quot;
his signature under a ten @-@ year contract had been granted to him 27 million US dollars annually since 2007 .
&quot; until the end of the contrac@@ t on 31 December 2017 , he will serve as a consultant and young coach - in full sal@@ ary . &quot;
&quot; as a player , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez paid a long time with performance . &quot;
&quot; with 6@@ 96 Hom@@ er@@ uns , 3@@ 114 Hits and 2021 points for his teams ( &quot; R@@ uns &quot; ) for the Seattle Navy ( 1994 to 2000 ) , the Texas Rang@@ ers ( 2001 until 2004 ) and since 2005 the Yan@@ ke@@ es managed some mil@@ estones . &quot;
&quot; with the Hall @-@ of @-@ F@@ ame members H@@ ank Aaron and Wil@@ lie M@@ ays , only two other bas@@ eb@@ all players show similar values in the most important statistics . &quot;
&quot; however , the 41 @-@ year @-@ old is not likely to be recorded in the hall of the bas@@ eb@@ alls . &quot;
&quot; for so successfully Rodri@@ gu@@ ez - nick@@ name &quot; A @-@ Rod &quot; - was in the field , so controversial is his appearance outside the place . &quot;
&quot; in 2009 , the super@@ star gave the &quot; ES@@ PN &quot; to have been banned from 2001 to 2003 . &quot;
&quot; in August 2013 , he was closed for 211 games due to the involvement in the so @-@ called Bio@@ gen@@ esis sc@@ andal until the end of 2014 . &quot;
Rodri@@ gu@@ ez is considered to be a major susp@@ ect for years to have received powerful means of anti @-@ aging clinic in South Florida .
&quot; after a dispute , the lock was reduced to 162 encounters . &quot;
&quot; the League could even have done a favor for 2014 , because I played 20 years without a break , &quot; &quot; said Rodri@@ gu@@ ez back south . &quot;
also his f@@ are@@ well @-@ days did not run smoothly .
&quot; while many bas@@ eb@@ all legends in their last games still get the big stage , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez had to sit on the bench frequently . &quot;
&quot; my job does not include a f@@ are@@ well tour . &quot;
&quot; my job involves trying to win any game , &quot; et@@ ched Yan@@ ke@@ es Coach Joe Gir@@ ardi . &quot;
&quot; after all , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , who was married with the act@@ ress Cameron Di@@ az , and the relationship with Pop@@ star Madonna and the act@@ ress Kate Hudson said , sympathy conver@@ sions of the fans of the Yan@@ ke@@ e Erz@@ ri@@ val Boston Red So@@ x . &quot;
&quot; we want a @-@ Rod , &quot; the supporters of the 4 : 9 defeat against the Rodri@@ gu@@ ez team . &quot;
&quot; Olympia 2016 : chen X@@ in@@ yi , Sil@@ wi@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ owa and Adrian Ziel@@ inski are the first dop@@ ing cases &quot;
&quot; caught : because of a positive d@@ ope probe , wei@@ ght@@ lif@@ ter Adrian Ziel@@ inski is not allowed to start from Poland in Rio . &quot;
Rio de Janeiro - The 2016 Olympic Games are over@@ sh@@ ad@@ owed by the first official dop@@ ing cases .
an exhaus@@ tive ath@@ l@@ ete would have won almost a medal .
&quot; before the seventh competition day , the first official dop@@ ing cases have become known for the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro . &quot;
&quot; the Chinese s@@ wimm@@ ers Ch@@ en X@@ in@@ yi , 3000 metres ste@@ ep@@ le runner Sil@@ wi@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ owa from Bulgaria and the Polish wei@@ ght@@ lif@@ ter Adrian Ziel@@ inski were positively tested and excluded - immediately before the start of the already critical athle@@ tics competitions these messages come to the un@@ even . &quot;
&quot; in Ch@@ en , the di@@ ure@@ tic hydro@@ chlor@@ ot@@ hi@@ azi@@ de had already been proven last Sunday , which is used as a mas@@ king agent for dop@@ ing substances . &quot;
&quot; on Friday afternoon , the International Criminal Tribunal of CAS confirmed its exclusion from the Olympic Games . &quot;
&quot; on Sunday , the 18 @-@ year @-@ old occupied the fourth place in the fin@@ als over 100 m of butterfly , only at 0.0@@ 9 seconds she missed the bronze medal . &quot;
&quot; on Friday , Ch@@ en had to take part in the ski@@ ers over 50 m Fre@@ estyle . &quot;
at the International Olympic Committee ( IO@@ C ) the opening of the B sample and a hearing applies .
&quot; the national association takes the matter very seriously and demands full cooperation in the investigations , &quot; cited X@@ in@@ hua from a message : &quot; we will work together with the International Sports Tribunal for CAS and will accept the judgment . &quot;
&quot; for the first time in history , IO@@ C is no longer responsible for the sanc@@ tion of athletes with positive cases . &quot;
&quot; in the night of Rio , the news of the positive rehear@@ sal took place at Dan@@ ek@@ owa , the 33 @-@ year @-@ old went into the offensive . &quot;
&quot; I had three tests , all negative , and my fourth test was positive , &quot; this was &quot; an incredible shock , &quot; she said to the Bulgarian TV station B@@ NT . &quot;
&quot; she is innocent , &quot; the only explanation could be dietary supplements , &quot; explained the ath@@ l@@ ete . &quot;
according to the report it is said to act in the banned substance for the EP@@ O blood dop@@ ing agent .
&quot; Dan@@ ek@@ owa was suspended provis@@ ional , according to B@@ NT , the B sample should already be positive . &quot;
Bulgaria &apos;s prime minister Bo@@ j@@ ko Bor@@ is@@ ov immediately reported criticism of the ath@@ l@@ ete .
&quot; I don &apos;t understand why the ath@@ l@@ ete don &apos;t draw the right conclusions , &quot; he said : &quot; we Bulg@@ arians are under observation , so many have already been excluded . &quot;
this means that all wei@@ ght@@ lif@@ ters from the chron@@ ically dop@@ ing @-@ laden nation are not allowed to participate in Rio .
&quot; on Friday , the case &quot; Adrian Ziel@@ inski &quot; was also known , the London Olympic champion in the class up to 85 kg was tested positive on the an@@ abolic ster@@ oid n@@ and@@ rol@@ on three days earlier . &quot;
&quot; both may deny the intake , however both are not allowed to start in the class up to 94 kg . &quot;
before the start of athletes is especially the case Dan@@ ek@@ owa a further heavy blow for the reputation of the whole sport .
&quot; the World Federation I@@ A@@ AF had under@@ gone the whole Russian team up to an exception because of systematic D@@ op@@ ings , even the L@@ äu@@ fer@@ nation Kenya produced numerous bad news in Rio . &quot;
&quot; in the swimming @-@ sports , the earlier auction in China had also ensured heavy con@@ front@@ ations between the athletes . &quot;
so Fr@@ ench@@ man Cam@@ ille Lac@@ our@@ t attacked the Chinese Olympic champion Sun Yang har@@ sch .
&quot; sun Yang P@@ ink@@ elt li@@ la . &quot;
&quot; when I see the podium more than 200 m Fre@@ estyle , I want to pass , &quot; says Lac@@ our@@ t in French Radio . &quot;
sun was also the center of an engagement with the Austr@@ ali@@ ans M@@ ack H@@ ort@@ on .
&quot; I have no time and no respect for dop@@ ing sc@@ amm@@ ers , &quot; said this . &quot;
&quot; sun was tested positively in the Chinese champ@@ ionships in 2014 , but had only to sit down a three @-@ month lock . &quot;
Daten@@ kl@@ au : this per@@ fi@@ de pressing h@@ acker her ran@@ som
programm@@ ers from Er@@ express @-@ malware are currently target@@ ing companies - and are successful .
&quot; according to a recent survey conducted by the malware defense specialist Mal@@ war@@ d@@ ytes under 540 companies in North America , Great Britain and Germany , 40 percent of surv@@ ey@@ ed companies were at least once , partially multiple victims of an attack with er@@ pres@@ ser software . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
40 percent of the victims paid will@@ ingly the solution required by the perpet@@ rators to re@@ use the challenged systems and data .
the perpet@@ rators speci@@ alize their er@@ pres@@ ser software according to the observations of Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes explicitly on attacks in corporate networks .
&quot; if they are successful , the potential to replace the ran@@ som is considerably higher than with private users . &quot;
&quot; we are currently watching a terri@@ fying rapid evolution of the malware , &quot; explains Mal@@ war@@ ebral Head Mar@@ cin Kl@@ ec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski in conversation with the &quot; world . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in 2008 , most of the painting programs were still designed to send advertisements . &quot;
then we discovered the Daily Express software for itself .
&quot; only private users were the target , but the change to company att@@ acking was terri@@ fying quickly over the past few months . &quot;
&quot; Ran@@ som@@ ware works according to a simple pattern : once active on the computer of an victim , it searches for unknown files such as Word@@ - , Ex@@ cel@@ - or database files , as well as archives of pictures and videos . &quot;
these files encryp@@ t the Ran@@ som@@ ware and delet@@ es the origin@@ als sustain@@ ably .
the software then presents the demands of the black@@ mail .
&quot; in order to get the final key code to the files , the victims must transfer money - mostly in the form of Cryp@@ to@@ currencies Bit@@ coin . &quot;
&quot; however , where private users use the personal photo database on the game , companies are concerned with sensitive customer data or project databases without stopping production . &quot;
&quot; accordingly , the damage occurs when a Ran@@ som@@ ware fails . &quot;
&quot; 22 percent of German companies reported revenue losses caused by Ran@@ som@@ ware , 13 percent had even had to completely inter@@ rupt the business operation , in a case people were in danger of life . &quot;
&quot; in Germany , several hospitals have already been victims of attacks , whose patients can be ac@@ utely threatened by the loss of sick persons . &quot;
&quot; we always say to the victims : pay not , you only promote the problem , &quot; explains Kl@@ ec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski . &quot;
&quot; however , 80 to 90 percent of companies pay , their data will be returned . &quot;
&quot; for managers , it is difficult to reject the demand of the perpet@@ rators in the face of down@@ time . &quot;
the h@@ ackers in turn know this and try everything to build a good reputation .
&quot; in a recent study , the security researchers of F @-@ Secure analy@@ zes the us@@ eful@@ ness and contact with black@@ mailing and come to the result : the perpet@@ rators are actually trying to build a kind of customer service to take more money . &quot;
&quot; they declare their victims per chat , as they can pay by Bit@@ coin , freely accessible support websites or de@@ cryp@@ t free example files . &quot;
&quot; and will be rede@@ emed by individuals after payment of a few hundred Euro , companies need to negotiate heavily and pay five @-@ digit sums in order to get back their data un@@ encrypted . &quot;
&quot; given the potentially high and relatively ris@@ ky gains from the Ran@@ som@@ ware black@@ mail , the h@@ ackers are becoming more professional and share the work , explains Security Expert Ch@@ ester Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski from anti @-@ virus vendors Sop@@ ho@@ s : &quot; a single person can write a ran@@ som@@ ware approximately within a week . &quot;
&quot; however , it is more likely that it is three or four persons . &quot;
the programm@@ ers sell their malware then in the form of a software building kit to the actual black@@ mail .
&quot; the previous malware @-@ kits have been created by the malware even , providing advice and additional tools for a unique , fixed price between 1000 and 10,000 dollars . &quot;
&quot; the scope of delivery includes a custom@@ ization tool , so that smaller configurations , appearance and br@@ anding can be changed , &quot; says Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski . &quot;
the black@@ mail then searches for further h@@ ackers to spread the newly purchased software among the victims .
we live in a service sector .
&quot; so one logs in one of the forums in the underground , bu@@ ys the set of a criminal and instruc@@ ts another to install the software on as many PCs as possible . &quot;
payment is done per infected host .
&quot; usually the crimin@@ als carry out sp@@ amm@@ ing with the spread , &quot; Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski explains . &quot;
&quot; in the meantime , the risk of Ran@@ som@@ ware is known by many companies that better safeguard their data . &quot;
over 50 percent of companies in the Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes survey can trust Ran@@ som@@ ware to be able to rep@@ el ran@@ som@@ ware by means of file @-@ back @-@ ups and scanner software .
&quot; accordingly , the perpet@@ rators are pursuing new strategies . &quot;
&quot; if the encryption of data is no longer a sufficient threat to successful capture , the perpet@@ rators instead thre@@ aten the release of sensitive data such as customer lists or pricing , &quot; explains Mal@@ war@@ ven boss Mar@@ cin Kl@@ ec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski . &quot;
&quot; thus , damage potential is much higher than before , depending on the type of data . &quot;
&quot; in the future , the perpet@@ rators could also take completely new targets on the internet of things . &quot;
&quot; at the Hack@@ er@@ konferenz , Def@@ con demonstrated how to get a thermo@@ stat with the Internet connected to the Internet . &quot;
&quot; in the middle of winter , the activation of such blocked heating could certainly be a ran@@ som value . &quot;
&quot; if the perpet@@ rators then block a whole production line in a factory instead of heating in the future , Ran@@ som@@ ware could also be an issue in Industry 4.0 . &quot;
one for all cases
Honda HR @-@ V is flexible and suitable for everyday use
&quot; in the small HR @-@ V Honda , Honda wants to pack everything : a little SU@@ V , a little cou@@ pe and also the versatility of a mini@@ v@@ ans . &quot;
&quot; it sounds rather over@@ loaded , but HR @-@ V , which was constructed on the same new platform as the new jazz , proves to be extremely flexible in everyday life . &quot;
&quot; although the only 1,@@ 60 m high HR @-@ V looks rather small , the passengers have a lot of space both in the first row and in the rear . &quot;
&quot; the materials of the interior space are well finished and have a pleasant effect , only the cock@@ pit top is down there . &quot;
the HR @-@ V is more versatile than comparable vehicles .
&quot; it is not only a trunk of 453 l with raised and 10@@ 26 l with inver@@ ted back@@ rests , but there is the &quot; &quot; Magic Se@@ ats &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; this is less magical than it sounds : the seat surfaces of the back bench can be folded up like kin@@ os@@ cop@@ es and thus offer storage space , which is 1,@@ 24 m high from floor to ceilings . &quot;
&quot; the trunk is well loaded , however the loading height with 650 mm is slightly higher than the comparable Peugeot 2008 . &quot;
the tested 1.6 @-@ l diesel with 88 kW / 120 hp acceler@@ ates HR @-@ V with torque of up to 300 Nm in wide speed ranges .
&quot; however , he is likely to do his job a little qui@@ eter . &quot;
the daily consumption of 4.7 l / 100 km is pleasing .
there is another mot@@ ori@@ zation : a 1.5 l gasoline with 96 kW / 130 hp .
a four @-@ wheel drive is not offered .
&quot; driving behavior is balanced , a good compromise between dynamics and comfort . &quot;
but steering should be a bit more direct .
the equipment in the tested top version &quot; Executive &quot; leaves nothing to be desired .
&quot; the city emergency braking system belongs to the security systems ( works up to 32 ) , the coll@@ ision warning system and the lane assistant . &quot;
&quot; the coll@@ ision war@@ ner sometimes irrit@@ ates , because he rated many obstacles as &quot; &quot; approaching objects &quot; &quot; when sh@@ alling . &quot;
the remote @-@ light assistant works very reliably .
and the intelligent tem@@ por@@ eg@@ ler re@@ acts to traffic sign recognition and induc@@ es speed if necessary .
&quot; however , the full connectivity is only available for the top equipment : 7 @-@ inch touch@@ screen , navigation device , app integration and more . &quot;
two USB and one HDMI socket are under the arm@@ rest and are therefore a bit aw@@ k@@ ward to achieve .
the approximately 29@@ 000 Euro for the well @-@ equipped top diesel are fine .
&quot; those who don &apos;t want to invest so much will receive the gasoline engine from 20,000 euros , diesel from 2@@ 3000 euros . &quot;
the engines comply with the Euro 6 emission standard .
&quot; with the HR @-@ V , Honda offers a versatile and everyday @-@ everyday car . &quot;
Airline is not liable : falling on passenger bridge
a airline is not liable for the fall of a passenger on the passenger bridge .
&quot; the Higher Regional Court , Düsseldorf ( A@@ z . : 18 U 124 / 14 ) argu@@ ed for a liability . &quot;
the pl@@ ain@@ ti@@ ff had broken a knee break during the fall .
&quot; however , the accident could have happened everywhere - it is a general risk of life , such as the court . &quot;
the airline did not have to pay damages to the man .
disease : when pays the organis@@ er
&quot; after their journey , suffer@@ ers only get money back if the cause of the disease is free to find in the hotel . &quot;
&quot; however , this is only the case if more than ten percent of the guests showed the same symptoms . &quot;
&quot; in the negoti@@ ated case , a family was severely damaged by di@@ arr@@ ho@@ ea and v@@ om@@ iting on the second day of their Turkish lau@@ rels . &quot;
she spent almost the entire holiday in the room .
their illness brought back the vac@@ ation@@ ers to a defective sewage plant that allegedly so@@ iled the sea@@ water .
&quot; the family was the view , the journey was in@@ adequate - and compl@@ ained against the organis@@ er . &quot;
&quot; in court , the pl@@ ain@@ ti@@ ffs had no success . &quot;
&quot; in fact , the sewage plant was indeed defective . &quot;
but the organizer was only shortly before departure of the pl@@ ain@@ ti@@ ffs .
until then he had to assume that the sea water was fine .
&quot; so he did not hurt his duties , so the judgment . &quot;
&quot; particularly , no contam@@ in@@ ants were found in the samples of the water . &quot;
the disease of several hotel guests - possibly by cont@@ ag@@ ment among themselves - belongs to the general risk of life .
from 6@@ 91 guests were only 38 erk@@ ran@@ kt .
&quot; according to the violent acts committed by refugees in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach in July , many people were worried about further attacks . &quot;
the state must be b@@ anded and decided at the same time to react to terror .
surely our country will not answer the violence of the perpet@@ rators with hatred and division .
we won &apos;t grant this triumph to the terrorists .
&quot; if crimin@@ als would have to leave the country more quickly , this increases the security and strength of the population for refugee policy . &quot;
de Mai@@ zi@@ ère wants to implement the proposals until the Bundestag election 2017 .
&quot; he also announced another personal rein@@ forcement of the security forces , and &quot; in medium @-@ scale magnit@@ ude for several years . &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; sympathy for terrorism must be under punishment . &quot;
&quot; video surveillance is to be improved , the tru@@ ce can be reproduced in such a way that , above all , the purchase of weapons on the internet is difficult . &quot;
the most recently discussed silence of silence for doctors is to be maintained after de Mai@@ zi@@ ères &apos;s words .
&quot; however , he wants to seek solutions in dialogue with the medical profession , how the threat of citizens can be reduced , he said with a view of psych@@ ic ab@@ norm@@ alities . &quot;
&quot; in order to counter@@ act a radic@@ alization of refugees , the Minister considers a better social support needed . &quot;
teachers would have to be better prepared for dealing with trau@@ mati@@ zed people .
&quot; to prosec@@ ute crimin@@ als in specific areas of the Internet ( Dark@@ net ) , de Mai@@ zi@@ ère is planning the use of conce@@ aled investig@@ ators . &quot;
&quot; SPD leader Gabriel said : &quot; &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything that helps to improve security . &quot;
it is important that the Interior Minister clearly expressed itself against action .
&quot; this was a pinn@@ acle for the Schar@@ f@@ macher in the CD@@ U / CS@@ U , &quot; Gabriel said the newspapers of the Fun@@ ke Medi@@ group ( Friday ) . &quot;
de Mai@@ zi@@ ère had previously rejected calls from the Union to a Bur@@ ka ban and the ab@@ olition of double citizenship before .
&quot; as a general prohibition of full wear , it considers constitu@@ tionally problem@@ atic . &quot;
&quot; you cannot prohi@@ bit everything you are rej@@ ecting , and I reject the wearing of the Bur@@ ka . &quot;
you can talk about rules about traffic or for witnesses in court .
&quot; green Chief Apostle Peter threw the minister , he wants to simul@@ ate energy and ability to act with ever new anti @-@ terror par@@ c@@ els . &quot;
&quot; the left @-@ party leader Bernd Ri@@ ex@@ inger said , &quot; &quot; Fle@@ et and shar@@ pen@@ ing of the residence on the right bring people no more safety in this country . &quot;
better traffic flow at the motorway junc@@ ture
it st@@ alls on the envel@@ ope on a regular basis - here a picture of November .
but this shall change : the law enforcement shall be extended .
&quot; this is a good news for all car drivers who are standing in traffic in the traffic road every night in the traffic road , if they are driving over the motorway in Zu@@ br@@ inger ( A 43 ) . &quot;
&quot; on the next Tuesday and Wednesday ( 16 / 17 August ) , state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ art road construction will extend the right @-@ bending track by 700 meters ( 16 / 17 August ) in the area between the Hammer Road and the exit Wes@@ eler Straße . &quot;
drivers can then drive directly from the hammer street on the right .
&quot; the big advantage : the traffic divi@@ des early , thus improving the overall procedure on the multi @-@ drive section of the Bundes@@ straße 51 . &quot;
the idea with the extended exit had the CD@@ U faction in the District Court of Münster @-@ West .
driving on the Zu@@ br@@ inger is anno@@ ying the drivers mainly between 17 and 19 o &apos;clock .
&quot; on week@@ days , the back@@ stab@@ au reaches the bridge over the Alber@@ slo@@ her way and sometimes also beyond . &quot;
reason is the con@@ i@@ fer pipe on the B 51 shortly before the Wes@@ eler Straße .
&quot; from here , traffic is only directed one lane via the motorway bridge . &quot;
the second track had to be disman@@ tled three @-@ quarter years ago .
&quot; the reason : static calculations resulted in the fact that the bridge no longer possesses the necessary load capacity , in order to mainly include heavy @-@ duty transport . &quot;
&quot; as long as this bott@@ len@@ eck and the associated de@@ w will continue , the state @-@ responsible state can not say . &quot;
&quot; however , with years to expect : the bridge has an official remaining time until 20@@ 34 . &quot;
&quot; for the extension of the law enforcement agency , state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ art company deliberately chose the traffic @-@ weaker time during the school holidays , because with disabilities to be expected . &quot;
the traffic will be run on Tuesday and Wednesday at the construction site .
intercultural Travel : cultural Offers for Schools
the international class of the Wald@@ schule visited the theatre piece &quot; The invisible house . &quot;
the club N@@ ima &apos;s and the Young Theater now plan a music project .
N@@ ima &apos;s association enables young people with a migration and refugee background to visit cultural institutions in Münster .
&quot; the &quot; &quot; class International &quot; &quot; of the Wald@@ schule Children &apos;s House has visited a presentation of the award @-@ winning piece &quot; The invisible House &quot; of the boy Theater Münster . &quot;
&quot; in the context of the &quot; &quot; Inter@@ cultural journey &quot; &quot; initiated by the association N@@ ima &apos;s , 19 students visited the st@@ aging in the small house between eleven and 15 years . &quot;
&quot; since the beginning of the year , the association , which aims to promote cultural integration of young people with migration and refugee background , has the opportunity to visit cultural institutions in Münster as part of this project . &quot;
&quot; most young people in the class have come to Münster between September 2015 and March 2016 , among other things from Afghanistan , Iran , Serbia and Syria . &quot;
&quot; thanks to the chore@@ o@@ graphies , the scenic pictures and video animations , it was possible to follow the course of action , so the press release of the boy Theater Münster . &quot;
&quot; the association N@@ ima &apos;s , founded by Dr. Tann@@ az West@@ er@@ berg from Langu@@ ages , and the Young Theater will work together in the upcoming season as part of a musical theatre project . &quot;
&quot; from October to December young people with and without escape and migration background will have the opportunity to attend professionally guided courses in the fields of singing , dance , acting and music . &quot;
offers for children and families in the field of theatre play and theat@@ rical language training are planned .
the project &quot; Inter@@ cultural Journey &quot; continues .
&quot; in view of the increased number of refugees , the association expects many classes to participate . &quot;
rain instead of star @-@ sn@@ apping : hope for improvement of weather
the weather has made the Stern@@ schn@@ u@@ ppen @-@ Gu@@ ck@@ ern in the southwest of Germany in the night to Friday a grain by the bill - but there is still hope .
&quot; the night was badly suited for clouds and rain to observe the cel@@ esti@@ al spectacle , the chairman of the observ@@ atory Wel@@ z@@ heim , Hans @-@ Ulrich Keller , on Friday morning . &quot;
our hope lies on the night to Saturday .
&quot; the weather is to be good , then we will see many star cliffs at the sky . &quot;
&quot; the star scales are per@@ sei@@ ds , which are one of the fastest star@@ lets of 216@@ 000 kilometers per hour . &quot;
they have their name because they seem to come from the con@@ stellation of Per@@ se@@ us coming up in the north @-@ east .
relaxing Night : tips against Sleep Disorders
&quot; in the evening , one hur@@ ts around etern@@ ally , at night one is bound to aw@@ ake for hours , in the morning it is far from the wake @-@ up ring no longer thinking about sleep . &quot;
this is anything but relaxing .
&quot; after all , with such problems in good society : according to the Robert Koch Institute , about a quarter of adult sleep disorders and more than ten percent feel their sleep frequently or permanently as not relaxing . &quot;
how are sleeping problems or sleep disorders ?
&quot; there are several forms of sleep disorders , and there can be many causes underlying them , empha@@ sizes Hans @-@ Günter We@@ eß , board member of the German Society for Schla@@ ff@@ or@@ gery and Sleep Medicine . &quot;
&quot; what you understand inland , however , is the In@@ som@@ nia , so an on@@ ward and sleeping disorder . &quot;
&quot; just to sleep , many people feel uns@@ atis@@ factory or in@@ adequate , says Jens Wag@@ enk@@ ne@@ cht , member of the German Medical Association association with practice in the Lower Saxony Var@@ el . &quot;
what is behind sleep disorders ?
the causes of sleep disorders are complex .
&quot; behind this there are organic , psychological or behavi@@ our@@ al factors , but also medication . &quot;
in@@ frequently the sleeping disorder is an expression of another disease .
&quot; very early awakening is common in the case of depression , &quot; &quot; said We@@ eding . &quot;
and it can be that different factors match each other .
&quot; for example , who has a her@@ nia failure , can be bad , w@@ akes up every two to three hours and possibly starts to sal@@ ute over everyday problems and worry , there is an example . &quot;
this leads to tension and sleep is no longer possible .
when should you sleep with sleep disorders to the doctor ?
&quot; if you do not sleep well over a period of one month at least three nights a week and is imp@@ aired on the day , should go to the doctor , advis@@ es We@@ eks . &quot;
&quot; imp@@ air@@ ment may be quite different : one is beaten , tired , un@@ exhausted , has difficulties with attention and concentration , is easily irrit@@ able , has mood sw@@ ings or physical ail@@ ments like stomach or head@@ ache . &quot;
&quot; to alle@@ vi@@ ate sleep distur@@ b@@ ance , it is important to find their causes . &quot;
&quot; treatment options include behavi@@ our@@ al changes , cognitive behavi@@ our@@ al therapy or also medicines - classic sleeping pills only in exceptional cases and at most for two weeks - in@@ query . &quot;
&quot; there is hardly any in@@ adequate sleep medicine in Germany , empha@@ sizes Prof. Ingo Fi@@ etze , Head of the Inter@@ disciplinary Medical Center of Char@@ ité Universitäts@@ medizin Berlin . &quot;
&quot; therefore , you should contact the dentist at first time problems with sleep problems . &quot;
it can clarify with investigations whether the problems have a physical cause .
who should go to sleep lab and what happens ?
&quot; for the examination in the sleep laboratory , physicians advise physicians for example in snor@@ ing with respiratory problems , in case of illness or if you do not find the cause of a sleeping disorder , explains Fi@@ etze . &quot;
you don &apos;t have to prepare for the examination .
one should spend the day normally .
&quot; only please do not make a n@@ ap @-@ sleep , &quot; says Fi@@ etze . &quot;
&quot; after cl@@ apping , one goes to bed at his normal time . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the electrodes on the body , one carries a nose @-@ glasses , a chest strap and a sensor on the finger . &quot;
&quot; in addition , a camera on the ceiling shows sleeping . &quot;
how can those affected get a grip on the problems ?
there are quite a lot of screws on which one can sit for a better sleep .
&quot; wo@@ und@@ y count on : regular sleeping and stand @-@ up times , not too long in bed , do not watch TV for sleeping , stop drinking , and at night don &apos;t look at the clock - then you start to reck@@ on immediately , and that is completely and not condu@@ ci@@ ve . &quot;
what the jungle camp with missing medals in swimming has to be
the former German swi@@ mmer Markus Dei@@ bler expressed himself on Facebook for the dis@@ ap@@ pointing cutting of the DS@@ V team at Olymp@@ is .
&quot; in December 2014 , he took gold for the first time in Doh@@ a for the first time and at the same time exhibited his first world record . &quot;
&quot; now , the former DS@@ V ath@@ l@@ ete Markus Dei@@ bler has placed himself in front of his ex @-@ team@@ mates via Facebook in front of his criticism . &quot;
&quot; in a country where an Olympic champion gets 20,000 € award and a j@@ unk King 150@@ .000 € should no one wonder about missing medals , &quot; wrote the 26 @-@ year @-@ old at night to Friday on his Facebook page . &quot;
&quot; the conveying system in the swimming @-@ sports is bad , but the dop@@ ing controls are very good . &quot;
&quot; in this way , we cannot compete with countries that promote a lot and do not look so closely on the topic of dop@@ ing or even operate it . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t say that the controls are to be set here , &quot; he explained . &quot;
&quot; if he wanted to start a com@@ eback , Dei@@ bler would have to be reported nine months before his first start of the National Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency Deutschland ( NA@@ DA ) . &quot;
this is exactly how you should keep it with countries .
&quot; who cannot be controlled a certain time before the WC / OS of independent controllers of the WA@@ DA / FIN@@ A must not participate , &quot; says the election Hamburger , who now runs an ice @-@ cream par@@ lor . &quot;
airport : Ban@@ de of Bag@@ gage Insurance fixed
professional thi@@ eves at Düsseldorf Airport
&quot; on Thursday , civil servants of the Düsseldorf police managed the arrest of two women and two men between the ages of 50 and 61 . &quot;
the susp@@ ects had committed several bags and luggage theft .
&quot; against 21.@@ 30 , civilian officials recognised a gang in the area of the Düsseldorf airport , which was known to the police officers from past theft . &quot;
&quot; the two women and two men had committed several del@@ ici@@ des since the middle of July , and have been particularly professional , labour @-@ oriented and especially professional . &quot;
&quot; the specialists of the crime com@@ miss@@ ari@@ ate 34 can prove the di@@ ver , who had come to Germany specifically to carry criminal off@@ ences , to prove four actions . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , they had exploited more than 15@@ ,000 euros . &quot;
&quot; old buildings , a few lin@@ den trees , meanwhile still a rest of the cob@@ ble@@ stone streets : the Riga road in Berlin @-@ Friedrich@@ sh@@ ain does not seem so , but the police are among the &quot; dangerous places &quot; of the city . &quot;
&quot; take the road from east to west , you get past play@@ grounds , a newly painted kinder@@ garten and a Bi@@ ol@@ aden . &quot;
&quot; on the facade of a grey house someone has &quot; ug@@ ly ! &quot; spra@@ yed . &quot;
&quot; compared to a Li@@ dl , which is to be dem@@ ol@@ ished soon , it is already built : until 2017 there will be a house with high windows and 133 new apartments . &quot;
&quot; articles about this &quot; trendy district , &quot; as the responsible real estate company Friedrich@@ sh@@ ain calls , will be illustrated in the last weeks preferred by burning cars . &quot;
&quot; the reason is the house with the number 94 : once it was occupied , meanwhile the inhabitants rented ten@@ ants , but on the ground floor there are still rooms occupied and are used for events . &quot;
&quot; since the beginning of the year , especially the Berlin internal sen@@ ator H@@ enkel noted several times for a tough action of the police against the project , the area as a &quot; no @-@ go zone &quot; for polic@@ emen and 94 as the starting point of autonomous violence . &quot;
&quot; after June 22 , the rooms on the ground floor , the Kad@@ ter@@ schmi@@ ede , were cleared with 300 police officers , were pat@@ rolling out official statements with 30 to 40 officials and three crew wag@@ ons on @-@ site , blocked parts of the road and stopped visitors from entering the house with the number 94 . &quot;
&quot; in the meantime , the construction workers commissioned the premises for the unknown land@@ lords . &quot;
&quot; on 13 July , a Berlin Administr@@ ative Court ruled that the clearance was illegal , and a day later police and construction workers moved away under the jubil@@ ee of sympath@@ iz@@ ers and residents . &quot;
&quot; on this summer afternoon the street works peac@@ efully : parents walk with children , people sit on the pav@@ ement in front of the houses in the sun , others enter@@ tain vor@@ m Sp@@ ät@@ i . &quot;
&quot; in the immediate vicinity of the building projects , there is a primary school and kinder@@ gart@@ ens . &quot;
&quot; left @-@ wing violence is not the main concern of many residents : Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who lives in the neighbourhood since 1999 , and Jan@@ a * , who is doing three children here , are mainly generated by the police presence . &quot;
&quot; with the inhabitants of the house projects , they share the care of rising mi@@ ds and v@@ entri@@ fication . &quot;
&quot; it doesn &apos;t sound like a Kie@@ z , who wanted a majority of police prot@@ ections against the v@@ andal@@ ous left . &quot;
&quot; the dit@@ ch , which of the Berlin internal sen@@ ator and the police between house @-@ occup@@ iers and their neighb@@ ors , does not exist . &quot;
&quot; Friedrich@@ sh@@ ain in the east of Berlin was actually a traditional working @-@ class district , which also today compared to the rest of the city has a lower average income and high poverty rate . &quot;
&quot; in 1990 , many houses were occupied in the former GDR , including nearly the entire Main@@ zer street close to Riga . &quot;
&quot; while the Main@@ zer was ev@@ acu@@ ated under a large police force in a regular street battle , many of the projects were leg@@ alised in Riga and are still inhabited by the people they occupied 26 years ago . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , the city district has increasingly become mag@@ nets for tourists and elec@@ tors from all over the world . &quot;
this is also noticeable in the rental companies that have increased by almost 60 percent since 2009 .
many of the new buildings in the R@@ ī@@ ga are attacked as symbols for this development : one recognizes them at pil@@ ed discs or freshly painted fac@@ ades which were ej@@ ected with paint bags .
no other street was mentioned so often along with the words &quot; left @-@ autonomous violence . &quot;
&quot; one reason is that not all neighbours regard this as a problem , could be that they are not necessarily affected by crime : crimes like bodily injury are according to statistics almost exclusively against polic@@ emen . &quot;
&quot; the biggest part of the off@@ ences make material damage , which tends to meet the new buildings and newly renovated houses . &quot;
&quot; for Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who has lived in a ten@@ ant building next to the controversial 94 for 17 years , there can be no talk of uncertainty . &quot;
&quot; as for acts of violence , it is critical : the people in the 94 are their neighb@@ ors , which were certainly not destined . &quot;
even the famous burning cars do not give it any longer in the R@@ ī@@ ga .
&quot; for the architect architect , her street is not a criminal focal point , on the contrary : &quot; here one helps one another , lives together on the road and gets more from each other than elsewhere . &quot;
Neu@@ geb@@ auer is consciously drawn into the Riga road - and remained .
&quot; that is why it was also so important that the residents get their road back : from the police , politics and the media , which in July all suddenly claimed the interpretation of the city . &quot;
&quot; however , in the eyes of residents such as Neu@@ geb@@ auer the street will continue to be taken away : by si@@ ghted new buildings in former buildings , which displ@@ ace the old inhabitants . &quot;
&quot; these are con@@ dom@@ ini@@ ums which are not interesting for many here - here are rather people who are not so well drunk , &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; I absolutely cannot appro@@ ve violence and destruction . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but what should be done if someone never list@@ ens to someone ?
&quot; there is fru@@ stration on all sides , even with the police and the inhabitants . &quot;
Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer has little understanding for tra@@ inees who have little understanding of colour bom@@ bers : the house projects and the left scene belonged to the Kie@@ z .
&quot; who runs out should be aware of it - just like someone , who pul@@ ls into a pub district , can be badly compl@@ aining about noise there . &quot;

Ur@@ bach : Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le is a new refugee commission@@ er
Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le is the contact person for integration and organis@@ er .
&quot; in addition , she is a social worker on site . &quot;
&quot; since July , Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le has been the Refu@@ gee Council for Ur@@ bach . &quot;
the social educ@@ ator supports the team of management around Ach@@ im Gro@@ cken@@ berger .
&quot; she sees itself as a contact partner for all actors : refugees , working group , refugee assistance , administration , authorities , and who else still mix@@ es . &quot;
&quot; Reg@@ ine Customer of the Working Group indicates that the volunteers are more than grateful that Deu@@ sch@@ le is now there , the ei@@ erle@@ gende Woll@@ mil@@ chs@@ au , which is above all a problem . &quot;
&quot; so some - less mo@@ cking than rather on the multitude of desired tasks , meant to be pur@@ pos@@ eful - meant when the administration wanted to write the place . &quot;
&quot; looking for an administrative force with a talent for languages and people , combined with a long @-@ standing experience in the field of social work , an ei@@ erle@@ gende Woll@@ mil@@ chs@@ au . &quot;
&quot; but administrative work is not their central area , says Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le . &quot;
&quot; above all , it is about organization , work with people on site and also behind the scenes as well as network activity . &quot;
the 31 @-@ year @-@ old has been there for about six weeks .
it has limited a 50 percent job for three years .
&quot; it was high time , &quot; Reg@@ ine Customer says that Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le supports and full @-@ time actors . &quot;
&quot; there are large and small problems , organizational , human and understanding problems . &quot;
new containers are soon available in the washing @-@ road
it has been a serious problem for some time to find apartments for the connecting refugees who have been recognized .
the commun@@ es are responsible for the connection provision .
they must supp@@ ress the refugees in their own or hired habit@@ ats .
&quot; the costs of construction , rent or renovation of these accommodations must bear the local authorities themselves . &quot;
the responsibility changes from the council office to the Commun@@ e and Job@@ center .
problem : there are free objects but not every landlord wants to offer his apartment .
the search has been very difficult for some time .
de fac@@ to the administration does not find private apartments .
&quot; so far , it does not work so far , one is dependent on private dwell@@ ings , so Deu@@ sch@@ le . &quot;
&quot; therefore , common apartments need to be found , as it is so beautiful . &quot;
&quot; so soon , new containers will be installed in the washing @-@ road . &quot;
but only with apartments it is not done .
&quot; perspective is the keyword , Reg@@ ine Customer and Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le agree . &quot;
&quot; in addition to a fixed place , there are intern@@ ships , apprentic@@ es@@ hips , school grounds , one @-@ euro jobs and jobs for refugees and migrants who need to be discovered or established . &quot;
&quot; more places would be good , &quot; Reg@@ ine customer reports . &quot;
&quot; many work in the building yard or help house@@ work , do char@@ itable work - and that motiv@@ ates and very ti@@ dy , as Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le reports . &quot;
it hopes that the work for the community leads to a positive external effect .
this is &quot; no employment therapy . &quot;
but activity does not only mean work .
&quot; the day needs a firm structure , say Deu@@ sch@@ le and customer . &quot;
people would have to develop a feeling of belonging .
&quot; so there are offers such as sports , contacts with locals and especially language courses . &quot;
professional courses are rare .
so also here administration and volunteers are jumping .
it is central that the refugees get the feeling they are welcome in Germany and welcome .
the long duration of the procedure is a problem .
&quot; you have to explain to the refugees that it will take and they can bridge the time meaning@@ fully , for example with language courses . &quot;
&quot; those who some@@ time develop the feeling , he couldn &apos;t help anyone in Ur@@ bach , should not work and be useless , he will never be integrated . &quot;
the clear majority is motivated .
&quot; the work of Deu@@ sch@@ le and customer is therefore always to motiv@@ ate others . &quot;
all this is already a &quot; mam@@ mot@@ h task . &quot;
&quot; a difficult question : are the two after recent inci@@ dents afraid of radic@@ alization , even in a small community like Ur@@ bach ? &quot;
&quot; no , &quot; Reg@@ ine Customer says clearly , &quot; what some people may call nai@@ ve . &quot; a residual risk can and does not want to exclude it . &quot;
but the hel@@ pers are already sensitive .
these inci@@ dents are also subject to refugees .
they would have the fear that the assass@@ ins were completely re@@ voc@@ able .
&quot; they want to show that they have nothing to do with it , &quot; &quot; says Reg@@ ine Customer . &quot;
many would like to stay in Ur@@ bach .
&quot; therefore , the main and volunteers must look out on the spot and in the region after activities . &quot;
they always in the background that soon a new push for refugees and migrants could come to Ur@@ bach .
does Germany need a cap ?
&quot; to answer this question clearly , politics is afraid . &quot;
&quot; actually , it is un@@ fair to place them on the spot . &quot;
&quot; in Ur@@ bach we are not yet arrived , where we would like , &quot; &quot; says Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le . &quot;
&quot; no new refugees , that would be able to relax . &quot;
Reg@@ ine customer also makes it clear that the Ur@@ bacher is already busy to integrate the existing people wis@@ ely .
&quot; these are currently around 100 people , mainly young men . &quot;
&quot; but when people are in need , they must help them , both women agree . &quot;
&quot; the political world situation is so complicated , there are no simple answers . &quot;
chim@@ ney : bur@@ gl@@ ar searched for helicop@@ ter
the police helicop@@ ter flew around one hour to several areas - un@@ successful .
two unknown men are rap@@ ed in an apartment in a multi @-@ family house on Friday morning at 8.@@ 50 o &apos;clock .
the inhabitants surprised the two and struck the un@@ hol@@ dest .
&quot; the two men were about 1.@@ 65 to 1.@@ 70 meters tall , well mas@@ ked , both Blue@@ jeans and black hoo@@ ded pul@@ lis were wearing . &quot;
they fled towards the city center .
&quot; for the flag@@ ship , the police set up several strikes as well as a police helicop@@ ter . &quot;
the flag was without success .
maybe the unknown fell in front of the apartment or when they were fle@@ eing .
