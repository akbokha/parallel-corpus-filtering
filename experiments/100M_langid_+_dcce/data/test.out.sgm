<seg id="2">His experiences on the horse are manageable.</seg>
<seg id="3">"at the end of a golf tournament in South Africa, Bernhard Langer sought a little change with some colleagues with a ride on the beach."</seg>
<seg id="4">For the 58-year-old it was a premiere.</seg>
<seg id="5">CHIO: "Golden Sports Pyramid" for Bernhard Langer</seg>
<seg id="6">"after a few minutes, the horses remembered their holidays, they hunted in the fast gallop home to the forage bows."</seg>
<seg id="7">"a kilometer at this pace, I was afraid."</seg>
<seg id="8">"it was not a good experience," Langer says. "</seg>
<seg id="9">So the equestrian career then ended up again.</seg>
<seg id="10">"on Saturday, Germany was the best golfer at all times - 101 tournament entries - again close to horses."</seg>
<seg id="11">"he left his family over the grounds of the ALRV, on a horse he did not go for photo purposes."</seg>
<seg id="12">A long time was the first time in Aachen and with it also at the CHIO.</seg>
<seg id="13">The reason was absolutely convincing.</seg>
<seg id="14">The German sports help handed the man from Anhausen in the framework of a small gala the golden sport pyramide.</seg>
<seg id="15">Honors do not lack the sympathetic athlete.</seg>
<seg id="16">"Champion of the Cross, Silbernes Lorbeerblatt, Champions-Tour-Player of the year..."</seg>
<seg id="17">Even the British Queen has already tried it.</seg>
<seg id="18">Long is the 18th awardee of the sports pyramid.</seg>
<seg id="19">"in Aachen, he met the first prize winner Hans Günter Winkler on Saturday."</seg>
<seg id="20">"this award gives me a lot," says Langer, "because she is not only awarded for sporting successes but also for social engagement."</seg>
<seg id="21">Langer has been promoting young talent for decades.</seg>
<seg id="22">And so he also gave the prize money of 25.000 Euro the same.</seg>
<seg id="23">"with 15 other outstanding athletes, the two-fold US mast winner was added to the" Hall of Fame des deutschen SPORTS "on Saturday."</seg>
<seg id="24">"the athletes, Hartwig Gauder and Harald Schmitt, the Fechter Cornelia Hanisch, Alexander Pusch and Arnd Schmitt, the Ruderer Peter-Michael Kolbe, the Ruderer Peter-Michael Kolbe, the jumper Alwin Schockemöhle and posthum of the handballer Erhard Wunderlich."</seg>
<seg id="25">Many of these sportsmen came to Aachen on Saturday.</seg>

<seg id="1">Clintons and Trumps Economic Policy in comparison: it's all about the money</seg>
<seg id="2">Invest in infrastructure and prevent the TTP trade agreement - both Clinton and Trump.</seg>
<seg id="3">"however, the two US presidential candidates are in the tax and energy policy as well as in a basic question."</seg>
<seg id="4">"the difference in economic policy between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton is a fundamental, more philosophical difference."</seg>
<seg id="5">The role of the state.</seg>
<seg id="6">Trump wants to keep the doubts rather small and warns about how the state can harm the economy - with taxes and regulations.</seg>
<seg id="7">Clinton wants to cheer the economy to death and regulate death he says.</seg>
<seg id="8">"he himself, on the other hand, would be quite different, says Trump."</seg>
<seg id="9">"he will be massively receding regulations, and makes himself strong for a far-reaching tax reform with lower tax rates - for individuals and for companies."</seg>
<seg id="10">"Clinton says: the state has to fulfil certain tasks, he has disadvantaged chances to open and needs money."</seg>
<seg id="11">"therefore, taxes for the rich would be increased, says."</seg>
<seg id="12">"interestingly, both are very close to the topic of infrastructure."</seg>
<seg id="13">"in the future, Trump and Clinton say almost the same."</seg>
<seg id="14">The democratic candidate is even announcing the biggest investment in new jobs since the Second World War.</seg>
<seg id="15">State investment programmes in the infrastructure are classical democratic politics and are strictly rejected by the state-critical Teapy wing of the Republicans.</seg>
<seg id="16">"so, on Trump, there could be even party discussions."</seg>
<seg id="17">Significant are the differences in energy and climate policy.</seg>
<seg id="18">Trump wants to build coal-fired power plants and drive coal mining again in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="19">"oil production should also be possible in so far protected areas, the Paris climate agreement intends to announce."</seg>
<seg id="20">"Clinton, on the other hand, wants to expand and demand renewable energies with its investment programme:" a country will become the super power of clean energy and create millions of jobs. "</seg>
<seg id="21">"it will be either China, Germany or America - I want us to be."</seg>
<seg id="22">"but not only in the infrastructure - even at international trade agreements, both competitors are not too far from each other."</seg>
<seg id="23">"TPP, the transpazione trade agreement, do not want to sign them."</seg>
<seg id="24">"at the same time, both the United States do not want to isolate the US from international trade - but simply better protect American jobs."</seg>
<seg id="25">"they are to be paid even better, for example Clinton."</seg>
<seg id="26">The current minimum wage of $7.25 is a hunger-wage.</seg>
<seg id="27">It wants to raise it to 15 dollars per hour.</seg>
<seg id="28">"what Trump wants to do in this issue is not quite clear: once he says: the minimum wage needs to be up, then he says he should not be changed."</seg>
<seg id="29">But the great discussion of the months ahead is probably more likely to develop the fiscal policy of the two camps.</seg>
<seg id="30">"on the one hand, Trump, who wants to relieve the economy and citizens in order to boost growth."</seg>
<seg id="31">"his critics keep him, so the budget deficit would only increase."</seg>
<seg id="32">"on the other hand, Clinton, who wants at least from the rich wants to pay more taxes, and their critics say: more taxes are also not the solution."</seg>

<seg id="2">"sexual violence is part of women who are alone, almost to everyday life."</seg>
<seg id="3">"when they arrive in Germany, they are often traumatized."</seg>
<seg id="4">A house offers refuge.</seg>
<seg id="5">Four women sit in a large kitchen.</seg>
<seg id="6">Each one has a baby at the most one year old.</seg>
<seg id="7">One has laid her little son in her arm.</seg>
<seg id="8">He looks curious into the room with big eyes.</seg>
<seg id="9">His mother stares on the table top.</seg>
<seg id="10">Until she notices that she is observed.</seg>
<seg id="11">She smiles briefly and kisses the little ones.</seg>
<seg id="12">The scene works normally.</seg>
<seg id="13">Until one speaks with Katrin Bahr.</seg>
<seg id="14">"she is a business manager of Condrobs, a carrier for social welfare services in Bavaria, and deals with the topic of women on the run."</seg>
<seg id="15">The four women in the kitchen are poultry.</seg>
<seg id="16">They live in the north of Munich in one of the few decentralised accommodation for all-winged women and their children in Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="17">"in January, Condrobs established the facility together with Pro Familia and the Munich Women's Aid."</seg>
<seg id="18">"recently, it has been officially opened."</seg>
<seg id="19">60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children.</seg>
<seg id="20">There are no men - also not as visitors.</seg>
<seg id="21">The exception is a guard in front of the door.</seg>
<seg id="22">"it is not exaggerated to say: every woman who arrives here has experience on their escape experiences with sexual violence," says Bahr. "</seg>
<seg id="23">"men flee because of wars because they are persecuted politically because torture or death threaten or because their families send them to Europe as the hope of hope." ""</seg>
<seg id="24">"in women there are other reasons for the escape:" many steal secretly, because they don't see any other way out. "</seg>
<seg id="25">"her homeland has made her experience with sexual violence, forced marriages, murder, slavery or forced prostitution."</seg>
<seg id="26">This drives them away.</seg>
<seg id="27">On the run this goes on.</seg>
<seg id="28">"that tugboats for example demand a bottle of water a sexual act is no rarity," says Bahr. "</seg>
<seg id="29">And the women are alone; they are not protected by their families.</seg>
<seg id="30">"who believes that the end, as soon as they arrived in Germany, irre, tells Bahr."</seg>
<seg id="31">"here too, single women in refugee shelters would often be regarded as inferior and worst."</seg>
<seg id="32">"this means that about 90 percent of women living in the accommodation in the north of Munich are traumatized, they appreciate."</seg>
<seg id="33">"some of the children are certainly not created voluntarily."</seg>
<seg id="34">Many women are used to say nothing.</seg>
<seg id="35">"or they don't dare to talk openly about the experience, because the shame is too big."</seg>
<seg id="36">"since they are often unable to assist, there are more accommodations only for them, urges Bahr."</seg>
<seg id="37">"in Bavaria, the seven district governments are responsible for the accommodation of refugees."</seg>
<seg id="38">"on the question of whether they knew from a similar project as in Munich in their jurisdiction, some respond with no."</seg>
<seg id="39">"in the Upper Palatinate and Upper Franconia, there is no such thing in the accommodation of the governments."</seg>
<seg id="40">"also in Swabians alone, escaped women are not accommodated separately, says Karl-Heinz Meyer, spokesman of the government."</seg>
<seg id="41">"in Upper Bavaria, Lower and Central Franconia, there are floors or own houses only for single women and their children."</seg>
<seg id="42">"the exception is Niederbayern, there are two central accommodations exclusively for women."</seg>
<seg id="43">The committee "Rights of Women and Gender Equality" in the European Parliament also calls for women to be separated from men.</seg>
<seg id="44">"in a study published for the committee, it says:" it is very important that men and women are being accommodated separately. "</seg>
<seg id="45">"lacking privacy, or are men and women accommodated together, it can become - perpetual - violence against women."</seg>
<seg id="46">"above all, the washrooms should be divided separately and for women easily accessible, is available in the study."</seg>
<seg id="47">"how much the women feel this protective need can be read at the rush, which there is on the house in Munich."</seg>
<seg id="48">"since we have been talking about it, we have a long waiting list," says Bahr. "</seg>

<seg id="2">Representatives of the assistants have called on their union to approve new labor-fighting measures in their dispute with regard to a new treaty.</seg>
<seg id="3">The Junior Doctors Committee (JDC) of the British Medical Association (BMA) demanded the entire council to approve more labour amputations from the beginning of September.</seg>
<seg id="4">The JDC said that the ministers failed to deal with the concerns regarding the contract.</seg>
<seg id="5">"in July, assistants and medical students agreed on the rejection of a contract agreed with the BMA."</seg>
<seg id="6">He was rejected by 58% of his members who voted in the elections.</seg>
<seg id="7">"in a letter to the members who were published on Thursday evening on Twitter, the chairman of the JDC Ellen McCourt said that the government would have remained" "persistent" "to problems, which led to the treaty being rejected."</seg>
<seg id="8">"she said:" considering this, the JDC Executive Board agreed to fully reject the proposed new contract and calls for official new negotiations to all your concerns. "</seg>
<seg id="9">"as an answer to the silence of the government, the JDC Executive Board has made a formal request for a special meeting of the BMA Council to approve a running programme of escalating labour amputation which begins in the beginning of September."</seg>

<seg id="11">"the Head of the BMA Assistant Doctor Dr. Johann Malawana came back after the election to reject the agreed contractual conditions, which were advised by the BMA."</seg>

<seg id="1">Russia and Turkey: an "alliance of outsiders"?</seg>
<seg id="2">It was a gesture that ended a crisis.</seg>
<seg id="3">The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to surrender their hands and proclaim an official end of the eight month long war of words and economic sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="4">"but when Vladimir Putin receives his Turkish counterpart in the gold plated Hall of St. Petersburg palace, I cannot forbid myself that Ankara would like this reconciliation."</seg>
<seg id="5">"there was the handshake, yes."</seg>
<seg id="6">"but Putin smiled smiling and he hardly radiated heat, even for his restrained circumstances."</seg>
<seg id="7">Recep Tayyip Erdogan said repeatedly from his "dear friend" Putin - according to a report all five times.</seg>
<seg id="8">I couldn't count it any more.</seg>
<seg id="9">"he also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis, but will even improve."</seg>
<seg id="10">"the next day, a newspaper described that Erdogan behaved like this would never happen."</seg>
<seg id="11">"for me, his enthusiasm seemed to indicate the opposite."</seg>
<seg id="12">"but one of Putin exuberant, sustainable refrigeration showed that Russia's head of state had nothing to forget."</seg>
<seg id="13">"rather, the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his introductory words: the downfall of a Russian fighter aircraft on the Syrian border through Turkey."</seg>
<seg id="14">Moscow's reaction to the time was kindled.</seg>
<seg id="15">Putin shared and accused Ankara to please Russia in his back.</seg>
<seg id="16">The transgression was even bigger since it was committed by a supposed friend.</seg>
<seg id="17">To rebuild the vetrack becomes difficult if not even impossible.</seg>
<seg id="18">The public opinion in Russia has changed since November.</seg>
<seg id="19">"the state-controlled media conducted a violent, unrestricted attack on Ankara for a few months."</seg>
<seg id="20">Suddenly it seemed as if the Turks would bear the blame for everything.</seg>
<seg id="21">"most serious were the allegations of senior officials, that Erdoggans had profited their own family from illegal oil trade in Syria, controlled by the so-called Islamic State."</seg>
<seg id="22">He denied this vehemently.</seg>
<seg id="23">"but in St. Petersburg, the official message was that it was time to look forward."</seg>
<seg id="24">"finally, this meeting took place only because Putin received the excuse that he wanted to hear from the President Erdogan."</seg>
<seg id="25">Russia could book a kind of victory.</seg>
<seg id="26">"for Ankara, the advantages of a ceasefire are clear on the hand."</seg>
<seg id="27">"Erdogan mainly needs all friends he can get, after having been enthused almost his ministry last month with a failed coup d" état. "</seg>
<seg id="28">Repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey have also shaken him.</seg>
<seg id="29">But there are also economic motives.</seg>
<seg id="30">"Russian sanctions have hit Turkey hard, especially the prohibition of charter flights that usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast every year."</seg>
<seg id="31">The number has declined by almost 90%.</seg>
<seg id="32">"in Russia, travel operators and charter companies will be relieved when the flights are resumed."</seg>
<seg id="33">They count on a late imperial onslaught to the Mediterranean.</seg>
<seg id="34">"this week, the state television predicted cheap fruit and vegetables as soon as the Turkish agricultural imports are allowed to be restored."</seg>
<seg id="35">"a report in Vedemsti described it as follows:" "tourists there long, tomatoes here long."</seg>
<seg id="36">But the visit had an additional political value for Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="37">"Ankara is angry at the West, as it considers his response to the attempted takeover of power as a weak answer."</seg>
<seg id="38">"in addition, the ongoing Groll on the snail empo of EU accession negotiations and Putin - who is piped to benefit from the cool atmosphere and reduce the relationship of Turkey to the West."</seg>
<seg id="39">The Russian Minister of State won a bonus for Ankara in Ankara that he sought after the attempted coup d "état support for the elected state organs.</seg>
<seg id="40">"this is well-known for Moscow, a matter of course that even a deep-fitting fear of regression changes."</seg>
<seg id="41">"the summit in this splendid palace at the sea enabled Russia and Turkey to portray an" "alliance of outsiders" ": two countries that violate the West and feel badly treated and now allied."</seg>
<seg id="42">"nevertheless, despite the public reconciliation, there are still large differences between the two."</seg>
<seg id="43">"the biggest difference is Syria, where Moscow recently gave itself the role as a peacemakers, but where Russia and Turkey support opposing sides."</seg>
<seg id="44">It could be significant that after almost three hours of initial talks both presidents at the press conference said they had not even stripped the issue.</seg>
<seg id="45">"the President of Turkey intentionally imminent to answer a question about their differences, while Putin decided to emphasise this."</seg>
<seg id="46">There is no clear consensus on where a common denominator can be found in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="47">"but after months of open hostilities - and in the face of the potential for a perfect disaster, when NATO member Turkey broke down the Russian fighter - it is certainly better that the two heads of state talk at least once again."</seg>

<seg id="8">"born in the Estonian capital of Tallinn in 1972, he graduated from the prestigious State Moscow Institute for International Relations (MGIMO) and worked in the Tokyo embassy."</seg>
<seg id="9">"on the Kremlin's website, it is called (in Russian) that he later became the chief executive and manager of the government staff."</seg>
<seg id="10">He said to Putin about his appointment: "thank you for your confidence."</seg>
<seg id="11">I think it is the main task of the government to support your work as head of state regarding bills of law and controls to implement your instructions.</seg>
<seg id="12">Putin shared the Russian TV channel on Friday that Ivanov asked to leave his post and recommended Vaino as his successor.</seg>
<seg id="13">Convincing the smiling faces?</seg>
<seg id="14">This step has made Moscow mysterious.</seg>
<seg id="15">"Sergei Ivanov was a long time one of Vladimir Putin's narrowest confidants and works as he worked for the Soviet intelligence service, the KGB."</seg>
<seg id="16">"as Chief of Staff, he was one of the most powerful men in the country."</seg>
<seg id="17">"at a meeting with President Putin, which was broadcasted on television, both men claimed that the Chief of Staff resumed at his own request."</seg>
<seg id="18">"but despite the smile for the cameras, only a few of them are convinced - especially now, just before the parliamentary elections."</seg>
<seg id="19">Is this the result of a kind of power struggle?</seg>
<seg id="20">Nobody knows this at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="21">"but the official assertion - that a man, who once was praised as a potential president, would once again lead to the Russian environmental policy - pushed on great scepticism."</seg>
<seg id="22">"in his remarks on Putin, who are quoted on the Kremlin's website, Ivanov said," "It's true that I asked you in a conversation at the beginning of 2012 - you could almost say - confidently entrust for four years."</seg>
<seg id="23">"as it turns out, I have been chairman of the Russian presidential office for four years and eight months."</seg>
<seg id="24">Ivanov took the post in December 2011.</seg>
<seg id="25">Previously he was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.</seg>
<seg id="26">He is a member of the Russian Security Council and as Putin's former member of the State Security Service KGB.</seg>
<seg id="27">"in the late 1990s, when Putin was chairman of the Federal Security Service (FSB), who replaced the KGB, Ivanov was appointed his deputy."</seg>
<seg id="28">"when Putin came to power, he called Ivanov as one of five people he trusted in most."</seg>
<seg id="29">"once it was assumed that Ivanov could become president of Russia after Putin's second term, since a third term of Putin could violate the constitution."</seg>
<seg id="30">"but this post was taken by another, close allies Putins, Dmitry Medvedev."</seg>
<seg id="31">Putin became Prime Minister before he became president three and a half years later.</seg>

<seg id="2">The £1.35 billion expensive project is scheduled to be completed by May 2017</seg>
<seg id="3">Engineers have connected the north deck of the Queensferry crossings with the viaduct - which means that the bridge is now connected to fife.</seg>
<seg id="4">"it is the first of four closures of the" "ceiling fans", "which approach the completion by each of the three towers of the bridge."</seg>
<seg id="5">The bridge section of Fife is now 600 meters long and weighs 30.000 tons.</seg>
<seg id="6">"it has 10,000 tonnes of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete as well as 46 oblique ropes."</seg>
<seg id="7">The £1.35 billion expensive project is expected to be completed by May 2017.</seg>
<seg id="8">"today, Keith Brown opened a visit to the construction site and was one of the first to move from the country to the bridge."</seg>
<seg id="9">He said: "this is a historical and symbolic moment when building the Queensferry crossings.</seg>
<seg id="10">"we are all witnesses of an engineering craft of a truly epic proportions in this project with more than 30,000 tons of concrete and steel used alone for this part of the bridge."</seg>
<seg id="11">"despite the massive size and weight of the bridge, the completion of the connection between the viaduct and the bridge deck is a delicate activity requiring extremely precise tolerances for fit."</seg>
<seg id="12">"in total, almost 79% of the total bridge deck at its place and the last section of the deck today gets a concrete pit for the deck, which means that the entire deck is ready to be lifted up on the bridge to its place."</seg>
<seg id="13">"Michael Martin, project leader of Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors said:" "the first shutter is a significant milestone in each bridge project."</seg>
<seg id="14">"in this fantastic project, the clasp presents trend-setting high-speed and civil engineering."</seg>
<seg id="15">"after installing the last stretch of road and its connection with the northern tower, we had to close the existing gap in the north or country side."</seg>
<seg id="16">This was achieved by dragging the northern part bridge 700 millimetres south.</seg>
<seg id="17">This was a massive and very delicate activity at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="18">"massive, since the Viaduct is 222 meters long, weighs about 6,000 tons and had to be pulled upwards by a incline of approx. 3%."</seg>

<seg id="2">"" "the SPD and the Green ones mean: investors should be taken much stronger in the future."</seg>
<seg id="3">How do you react to the bad news that Braunschweig will lose almost 1300 cheap apartments over the next few years?</seg>
<seg id="4">"the SPD proposes a" "Action Concept" "for the next council session."</seg>
<seg id="5">But controversy is programmed.</seg>
<seg id="6">First and foremost it is about the question: who is supposed to build the cheap apartments?</seg>
<seg id="7">A regulation is missing so far.</seg>
<seg id="8">"the president of the SPD leader Christoph Bratmann says:" "we are united with the Greens: whoever wants to build on urban areas must in future have to exhibit 20 percent of all apartments as social housing."</seg>
<seg id="9">"however, the cheap apartments can also be made in stock."</seg>
<seg id="10">"however, the big issue in the town hall was, as Bratmann:" how do we deal with investors that want to build on private surfaces? "</seg>
<seg id="11">"we want investors to build at least 10 percent on such sites, but as 20 percent of homes as social housing."</seg>
<seg id="12">"a new urban housing construction program, which will cost millions of money and must still be financed, is intended to provide incentives."</seg>
<seg id="13">"the problem, as Bratman:" there is currently no agreement between the factions. "</seg>
<seg id="14">The CDU wants to make investors as few regulations as possible.</seg>
<seg id="15">The left wants even harder conditions for investors.</seg>
<seg id="16">"notwithstanding, as Bratman, a sharpening of the situation on the housing market."</seg>
<seg id="17">"if the concept of action is implemented, it will take care of additional tasks in the building management."</seg>
<seg id="18">More staff is required.</seg>
<seg id="19">It is unclear whether we get the professionals.</seg>
<seg id="20">"yet the program is not entirely new: because the approximately 1260 new apartments, which should be built anyway."</seg>
<seg id="21">But how do you compare the loss of more than 1300 cheap apartments whose funding will run over the next few years?</seg>
<seg id="22">"only by 2020 alone, there will be 500 apartments."</seg>
<seg id="23">"to prevent this, such as the planning policy spokesperson Nicole Palm, should now buy-out Bindings from the city."</seg>
<seg id="24">"in addition, it would have to be thought of taking flats again back into the price binding."</seg>
<seg id="25">This is possible in the west town.</seg>
<seg id="26">On one blow the problem could be solved.</seg>
<seg id="27">For in the west city run for the end of the year.</seg>
<seg id="28">Around 1800 flats you could get back into the price binding for cheap apartments.</seg>
<seg id="29">"only: this does not want the owners, the housing companies."</seg>
<seg id="30">"because the number of social housing in the west town is again increased dramatically, it is removed from the goal of the so-called mixture."</seg>
<seg id="31">There will no longer be a concentration of social weak in just a few districts.</seg>
<seg id="32">The Greens anticipate that there will still be movement in the discussion.</seg>
<seg id="33">"leader Holger Herlitschke says:" "for a broad majority, the CDU must go into the boat."</seg>

<seg id="1">Pokémon Go is a hunt for health and happiness that pays off</seg>
<seg id="2">It is fascinating to watch how the world is changing.</seg>
<seg id="3">"the fact that teenagers and children no longer go outside, but rather prefer to spend their leisure time on screens, has been lamented by many in the last decade."</seg>
<seg id="4">Pokemon Go is about getting people out of the sofa and become more active.</seg>
<seg id="5">"the time on the screen was initially limited to the TV, then on video games and at least on smartphones."</seg>
<seg id="6">It is therefore great to see that technology and outdoor activities are not mutually exclusive.</seg>
<seg id="7">"naturally I refer to the Pokémon Go-Wahn, an app based on the characters that were initially created for video games in the 1990ies (later a cartoon series, playing cards and other spin-offs)."</seg>
<seg id="8">"as many phenomena of pop culture decreased the interest in the release of the game in the US, Australia and New Zealand in early July."</seg>
<seg id="9">The market launch in other countries has been postponed by massive demand that overload the servers.</seg>
<seg id="10">"within days, Pokémon Go had more users than Tinder and almost as many as Twitter."</seg>
<seg id="11">How does it work?</seg>
<seg id="12">"in short, players go outside with their smartphones and search for Pokémons that are followed by a GPS and once they were found" "photographed" "(using a screenshot on the mobile phone) or" "captured". ""</seg>
<seg id="13">"a generation playing the game when she was younger, joined the Wahn and jumped for the search of the sofa."</seg>
<seg id="14">"in the United States, the game led to a considerable increase in steps that the" average "person restores every day."</seg>
<seg id="15">"Cardiogram, an app for Apple Watch, followed by 35,000 users, informed the Washington Post recently that within two days after market launch of the game, the number of people followed that exercise every day 30 minutes, from 45 percent to 53 percent."</seg>
<seg id="16">The company does not know who playing Pokémon Go - it merely looks the raw data to increase performance.</seg>
<seg id="17">"many public awareness campaigns for health, people want to take" 30 minutes time, "" coming from the sofa, "and" to be active every day, "bite on deaf ears, because many public messages are bored for health and coming from people who look miserable."</seg>
<seg id="18">"nevertheless, the importance of sport cannot be overvalued."</seg>
<seg id="19">Anyone who regularly drives sport reduces his chances of getting cancer or depression.</seg>
<seg id="20">"physical activity helps in weight control, high blood pressure, diabetes and a long list of benefits that is too long to guide them here."</seg>
<seg id="21">But the Wonderful at Pokémon Go is that it brings people to do something outdoors that makes them fun.</seg>
<seg id="22">"thus three pillars of health are covered - movement, fresh air and sunshine as well as fun."</seg>
<seg id="23">Some people even close new friendships on the hunt.</seg>
<seg id="24">"as always, there are mosquitoes that must always complain about something."</seg>
<seg id="25">"and yes, someone could walk against a door."</seg>
<seg id="26">What is it?</seg>
<seg id="27">It has made a breakthrough.</seg>
<seg id="28">"even if smartphone apps like Fitbit could track our activity earlier, they gave us no reason to play sports as it does this game."</seg>
<seg id="29">The new will lose its charm and use it with time.</seg>
<seg id="30">"because of Pokemons's success, however, there will be more games that will unite apps and virtual reality with the activist in the real world and will help many people on the hunt to be more active, fitter and healthier."</seg>

<seg id="2">Forget the print.</seg>

<seg id="5">Dynamic on the jumping horse.</seg>
<seg id="6">Effortless on the beam.</seg>
<seg id="7">Breathtaking on the ground.</seg>
<seg id="8">On whole line brilliant.</seg>
<seg id="9">And now finally Olympic champion.</seg>
<seg id="10">The 19-year-old American gymnast climbed on Thursday to a multi-campaign title and enlarged the gap between itself and the rest of the world before all eyes under the headlight of the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="11">"their overall result of 62,198 was clearly in front of the silver medallists and" Final Five "team member Aly Raisman and the Russian bronze medallists Aliya Mustafina."</seg>
<seg id="12">"the Americans Simone Biles on the Sweater beam during the individual multi-campaign of women at the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro 2016, Brazil, Thursday."</seg>
<seg id="13">"Biles is the fourth heterosexual woman who wins a multi-campaign title and overall the fifth, while she solidifies her reputation to be the best of her generation or even at all."</seg>
<seg id="14">She broke down in tears when her final result was shown and her long journey at that moment found an end.</seg>
<seg id="15">This success puts them in the same league as unique athletes such as Michael Phelps who brought their sports to new heights:</seg>
<seg id="16">"Biles has dominated her sports art over the last three years, 15 world master medals - including 10 gold medals - including 10 gold medals - with so amazing exercises that the Olympic champion of 1984 Mary Lou Retton said she" "The best gymnast I've ever seen."</seg>
<seg id="17">"they expected a final test in Brazil, a competition not so much between Biles and the rest of the athletes, but rather between her and a burden of oversized expectations."</seg>
<seg id="18">"not returning with a handful of gold back to the family in Spring, Texas, would be considered a disappointment."</seg>
<seg id="19">"the Americans Simone Biles, left, and Aly Raisman embraced themselves after winning gold and silver in the individual multi-campaign of women in the summer Games in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Thursday,"</seg>
<seg id="20">"Billion took the first medal on Tuesday, while on the farewell party of the team coordinator Martha Karolyi served as exclamation marks."</seg>
<seg id="21">"although it insisted that during their long path to the top, never planned the future, this is not really true."</seg>
<seg id="22">A part of their soil exercises - which contain their typical Tumbling Pass - is matched to Latin American music that would fit at home on the street outside the Olympic arena in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="23">This is not a coincidence.</seg>
<seg id="24">"this girl, who was adopted by her grandparents as a little child and was discovered by trainer Aimee Boorman's mother during a school excursion into the gymnasium, was trained in the Boorman."</seg>
<seg id="25">"since the summer of 2013, she has lost no competition for a multi-war competition, a winning series that will stop as long as it wishes."</seg>
<seg id="26">"even though Mustafina was slightly led by two turns, the picture was deceptive."</seg>
<seg id="27">Schwebebeams and Bodenturns - in which Biles holds the World Champion title - lauded.</seg>
<seg id="28">She again picked up again with 15,433 on the floating beam - and continued with a 15,933 on the floor. "</seg>
<seg id="29">"Raisman embraced her softly as she expected her dergbnis - a pure formality - and tears flowed on Biles shiny red, white and blue eyeliner, as the vision she once described in her collective book, became reality."</seg>
<seg id="30">"the performance of Raismans was a revenge for the last time four years ago when it fought for the third place, but the bronze medal went to Mustafina in a Tiebrake."</seg>
<seg id="31">"this time, the 22-year-old team of teams, called" "Oma" "by the Americans, had a lead."</seg>
<seg id="32">"after her soil exercise, she threw up the audience of Kusshead, overwhelmed by a comeback, which sometimes seemed doubtful."</seg>

<seg id="3">"Angela Rochelle Liner, Stefanie R. Ellis and Ellis daughter Maleah were shot on June 12, while the car was parked while driving, the authorities said."</seg>

<seg id="1">"why we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie"</seg>
<seg id="2">This is what I imagine under the women's Olympic Games in the gymnastics and that is more than one reason.</seg>
<seg id="3">"first of all, I have been at every summer Olympics since 1984 and the US has never been so dominant."</seg>
<seg id="4">"second, this team has three gymnasts, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren" Laurie "Hernandez, who inspired many young girls from other skin colour."</seg>
<seg id="5">"the structure of this team, the Aly Raisman, the Jüdin is and Madison Kocian, the Catholicist, rounds off, makes everyone proud."</seg>
<seg id="6">This team is finally reflected in the US.</seg>
<seg id="7">It has strengthened the black and hispanic female presence at the top of this sport.</seg>
<seg id="8">"in the last four years, the number one among the female gymnasts was an Afro-American woman."</seg>
<seg id="9">Last year Simone and Gabby # 1 and # 2 were.</seg>
<seg id="10">This shows strength.</seg>
<seg id="11">"during the last Olympic Games, Gabby Douglas was a surprise Olympic champion and America cheered."</seg>
<seg id="12">"now the world was able to witness the incredible achievement of the triple world championships of Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, as they were unexpected, but masterful Gymastics routines."</seg>
<seg id="13">"on Thursday Simone was the fourth, heterosexual Americans who won gold at an individual multi-campaign event for women."</seg>
<seg id="14">Team member Aly Raisman won silver.</seg>
<seg id="15">"we experience the peak of this sport, but as gymnastic classes do not see in the whole country."</seg>
<seg id="16">"Simone, Gabby and Laurie all beat the same way as Aly and Madison to create it to the Olympic team."</seg>
<seg id="17">"they are the" Last Five, "because the next Olympic team will only have four gymnasts in the team. furthermore, this is the last year with Marta Karolyi as trainer."</seg>
<seg id="18">"but the reality looks so that Turns are a more expensive sport and gymnasts are primarily in private gyms that are maintained by parents, which arise for training, training, travel and hotel costs (for the trainers and their gymnasts and families)."</seg>
<seg id="19">The majority of these gymnastics are in wealthy suburbs that can support the business.</seg>
<seg id="20">"in these associations, the gymnasts receive their entire training and that is for families a teures and long-term commitment."</seg>
<seg id="21">"Aimee Boorman, trainer of Simone Biles, and Maggie Haney, trainer of Laurie Hernandez, both trained their athletes since they started exercising."</seg>
<seg id="22">"we have to aun the municipalities, innumerable young girls who are inspired by Simone, Gabby and Laurie, an affordable and easy-to-reach gymnasium training."</seg>
<seg id="23">I founded my gymnasum of 20 years.</seg>
<seg id="24">"at my events, we have offered free and affordable turnes in Harlem for more than 15,000 urban teens (mainly black and Hispanic) and trained national and international victors."</seg>
<seg id="25">"in September, we will expand to Detroit (my home town) to offer young high-quality gymnastics that deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sports art."</seg>
<seg id="26">"gymnasts develop strength, flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work, discipline and determination for the mind."</seg>
<seg id="27">This combination offers life-long benefits for health as well as for academic and professional success.</seg>
<seg id="28">It is the inspiration of this team who will bring thousands of young girls to be interested in gymnastics and that's great.</seg>
<seg id="29">"it is so important to participate in sports, especially for girls."</seg>
<seg id="30">This is an exciting time.</seg>
<seg id="31">"thanks Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for this real representation of" Girl Power "through the holen of the Olympic team golds and thank you, you are motivated so many young girls with different backgrounds to start their way, healthy, strong and successful young women."</seg>

<seg id="1">Culture of Political Correctness lets election fraud bloom in Muslim areas</seg>
<seg id="2">Former Mayor of Tower Hamlets Luton Rahman was removed last year due to corruption from office</seg>
<seg id="3">A culture of political correctness has led to the fact that widespread voting in Muslim communities is unknowingly ignored as a devastating government report today.</seg>
<seg id="4">"the former cabinet of cabinet Sir Eric Pickles attests to verbally the police, election observers and city councils to ignore evidence of polling misuse due to" "hypersensitivity to ethno and religion". ""</seg>
<seg id="5">"the former minister of integration and communal government, who is now a reincarnation, said that the intimidation of voters from religious motives would be so bad that the police should be allowed to set off barriers outside of electoral cabinet to protect intimidated voters."</seg>
<seg id="6">"he recommends that voters should lead a passport, in order to prove their identity in the elections."</seg>
<seg id="7">"at the moment, a voter must simply call his name and address."</seg>
<seg id="8">The report proposes not to apply removable inks to the finger of a person when they give up their vote to prevent someone chooses twice.</seg>
<seg id="9">"whistleblower should get more protection, says Sir Eric."</seg>
<seg id="10">It demands that the press should have more access to municipal documents and decisions by non-official committees or working groups.</seg>
<seg id="11">"this is not only aimed at electoral fraud, but also to protect the communal government from the broader corruption and financial crisis culture that is associated with it," he said. "</seg>
<seg id="12">The report was arranged by Downing Street as a result of Tower Hamlets Wahlskandals in the east of London.</seg>
<seg id="13">"last year, a Special Court ruled that the acting mayor Luton Rahman should be exposed to corrupt and illegal practices of his ministry."</seg>
<seg id="14">The Court found that Rahman had perverted the religious feelings of his Muslim community "in a cynical way" and that he had brought his critics to silence with racist and Islamophobic accusations.</seg>
<seg id="15">"Rahman is said to have led" "his campaign on the basis that it is the religous duty of Muslims to choose him."</seg>
<seg id="16">Up to 300 voices were either doubtful or the result of a imitation in which one person chooses as someone else.</seg>
<seg id="17">Sir Eric said that there was evidence of fraud throughout the country.</seg>
<seg id="18">"in particular, he expressed himself alarming for fraudulent briefing - in the older members of the Muslim community pressure on people to choose a candidate of their choice."</seg>
<seg id="19">"Sir Eric, pictured, made several recommendations to clean the electoral system, including guiding principles to prove the identity"</seg>
<seg id="20">"in his report it is said:" "as proof, pressure on vulnerable members of some ethnic minorities has been exercised, especially women and young people, in order to choose according to the will of the elderly, in particular communities with a Pakistanian or Bangladesian background."</seg>
<seg id="21">"there were concerns that... state institutions would have unknowingly ignored such behaviour on the basis of" politically correct "hypersensitivity to ethno and religion."</seg>
<seg id="22">"Sir Eric spoke 50 recommendations to clean up the system, including the prohibition that political activists are editing letter mailings to stop" electoral issues. ""</seg>
<seg id="23">"the report, which is taken into consideration by Theresa May, also requires tougher registration checks to prevent the electoral directory used for immigration and social fraud."</seg>
<seg id="24">Consider options to ask voters before choosing your ID.</seg>
<seg id="25">Do not use removable inks on the finger of a person as soon as they have released their voice to prevent someone chooses twice.</seg>
<seg id="26">Systematic review of the nationality of a person to make sure they are eligible.</seg>
<seg id="27">A three-year limitation on applications to an automatic letter.</seg>
<seg id="28">Prohibition that political activists edit complete letterings and envelopes of letter selections.</seg>
<seg id="29">"the police enter the authority, shut-off for election stations."</seg>
<seg id="30">A amendment that made an indictment for intimidation in accordance with the Representation of the People Act 1983 (Public Representation Act 1983).</seg>
<seg id="31">Photographer prohibition in electoral units.</seg>
<seg id="32">Requirement that only English can be used in the election stations (except Wales).</seg>
<seg id="33">Intensification of the training to ensure that the employees usually enforce that voters alone go into the electoral cabinet.</seg>
<seg id="34">Sir Eric falls on the Metropolitan Police and finds it "amazing" that after the Tower Hamlets case there was no penalty.</seg>
<seg id="35">"the election court has said Luton Rahman and his deputy for a litany of corrupt and illegal practices," "he said."</seg>
<seg id="36">"due to a number of reasons, he was found guilty on a number of reasons - according to the high demands in criminal proceedings."</seg>
<seg id="37">He also criticises the ineffective "shutdown controls" of the constituent registrants of the town hall houses.</seg>
<seg id="38">Sir Eric said: "the Court of Justice in Tower Hamlets of last year was a warning signal.</seg>
<seg id="39">"our country bears a proud heritage as the Mother of the Parliaments, but the worrying and concealed spread of electoral fraud and denial of some authorities threaten this good reputation."</seg>

<seg id="4">"regardless of whether you're approaching from the front or from behind, this video will show you how to spin the skewer for your predator."</seg>

<seg id="2">A British traveller underwent his immune system and Würfeleflex a serious test - by removing some of the most dirtiest and most disgusting places in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="3">"the moderator and traveler Ian Wright, 51, from Suffolk closed his course on a euro string, a banister at Piccadilly Circus, a rinsing button of a tie-toilet and a public phone in Russia to prove the resistance of his immune system."</seg>
<seg id="4">"before unloading every object, it used a luminometer to show itself and to show us what it is going to be introduced."</seg>
<seg id="5">"but the experiment, which was filmed under the title" The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength, "brought some surprising results to daylight."</seg>
<seg id="6">"the thought of removing the rinsing button of a tensile toilet, which has been used by thousands of others may be totally dismissive, but in fact, there are more bad bacteria in a kitchen sink."</seg>
<seg id="7">"on his journey through Europe, Mr. Wright spoke with doctors and medical professionals to promote intestinal bacteria and their own health."</seg>
<seg id="8">"fortunately nothing left what he tasted, more than a bad aftertaste in the mouth."</seg>
<seg id="9">"Mr. Wright became known to test the resilience of his bowel, by travelling through the world and ate peculiar and wonderful things."</seg>
<seg id="10">"from public money to train stations to rinsing knobs of toilets, the task set its immune system definitely below a sample"</seg>
<seg id="11">"he told him:" "as a child I was relatively unconcerned about my health and I put all kinds of things in my mouth, earth, worms and mud water."</seg>
<seg id="12">"in the film, he was able to do justice to his reputation."</seg>
<seg id="13">The only thing he refused was a dirty public toilet in Russia.</seg>
<seg id="14">Its sample line showed a luminometric number of over 4000 units.</seg>
<seg id="15">"compared to this, the Luminometry value amounts to less than 60."</seg>
<seg id="16">"but there was a Russian toilet, which he refused to denounce after their luminometric pressure was over 4000 units, whereas freshly washed hands were one of less than 60"</seg>
<seg id="17">Mr. Wright and the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products valio produced the travel film "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength" showing the bacterial count at different places like the bathroom</seg>
<seg id="18">"in the film, he says:" "that comes to the worst thing I have done in a toilet, close."</seg>
<seg id="19">There is nothing more dirty than that!</seg>
<seg id="20">I will not lick here because it is disgusting here.</seg>
<seg id="21">"the Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength" was produced in collaboration with the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products valio.</seg>
<seg id="22">"the company equips Mr. Wright with Valio Gefilus, which contains both lactic acid bacteria and vitamin C and D to support intestinal bacteria and immune system."</seg>
<seg id="23">"valios Senior Vice President for Snacks, Shanks and New Categories Niko Vuorenmaa says:" we wanted to offer consumers something new. "</seg>
<seg id="24">Something that is fascinating to look at and at the same time explains the advantages of probiotics.</seg>
<seg id="25">"we performed crazy brainstormings that ended up saying" "Let us call us Ian." ""</seg>
<seg id="26">They claim that the interest in intestinal health becomes a global phenomenon</seg>
<seg id="27">"instead of talking about the products we wanted to put them into a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment, the importance of gut health and how they are linked to the immune system."</seg>
<seg id="28">The growing interest in intestinal health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we could provide consumers with more information in an interesting way.</seg>
<seg id="29">I also think the film shows that we have a great sense of humour!</seg>
<seg id="30">"Tom Hakala, who directed the film directing, added:" "let me tell me so - I would have lost my respect for Ian, if he had tasted some of the things I have instructed him, just like the disgusting Russian toilet that is shown in the film."</seg>
<seg id="31">"of course, there were things in which it was easier to put Ian to blame them, and others in which this was quite difficult."</seg>
<seg id="32">I'm glad we recorded some of these dirty goodies on film.</seg>
<seg id="33">"in a survey conducted by Valio in 2015, 84 percent of all surveyed lactic acid bacteria associated with the well-being of stomach and intestine and 58 percent said they have at least occasionally used products containing the attached lactic acid bacteria."</seg>

<seg id="2">"an asoziale family left their social housing after a deletion of £50,000, because they had terrorized their neighbors."</seg>
<seg id="3">"Tanya Skeldon and her partner Shaun Trebilcock were thrown after a long list of complaints from their property in Saltash, Cornwall."</seg>
<seg id="4">"after being raped from their property, shocked employees of the housing association found their property in an irreparable condition."</seg>
<seg id="5">"the walls showed small holes, wood panels were ripped, rubbish was scattered on the floor and graffiti was lubricated to the walls."</seg>
<seg id="6">The family has been resettled and it is believed that she is now living in private accommodation</seg>
<seg id="7">"Donna McEvoy, who works for home administration at Cornwall Housing, said they feared that the apartment was no longer repaired."</seg>
<seg id="8">She said: "it was an absolute nightmare for the people here and I think people don't have to live in this way.</seg>
<seg id="9">"there are many things to consider, since this property will probably be considered as not as beautiful part of Cornwall."</seg>
<seg id="10">The family is notorious and their reputation is also.</seg>
<seg id="11">"the couple had three sons who lived in the apartment in the meantime and the police said that the terror that had inflicted the family has included street fights with baseballets, intimidations, drug abuse, drug trafficking, and excessive cries, strikers and flukes."</seg>
<seg id="12">"Skeldon, 47 whose name was on the lease, got an arrangement for anti-social behaviour in June."</seg>
<seg id="13">"in some rooms of the house, which will be demolished under certain circumstances, old garbage was found"</seg>
<seg id="14">"in the estate in which drugs were traded in the past, the wooden planks were ripped"</seg>
<seg id="15">Neighbours said that they saw them fighting on the streets and regularly invoked the police</seg>
<seg id="16">Cornwall Housing delogated her and her partner this week forcibly by the property after giving them an extended period of 11 weeks to voluntarily surrender.</seg>
<seg id="17">Delogation were cheered by lightened neighbours who said that their life was made to hell.</seg>
<seg id="18">"one said," They were shocked by no one. ""</seg>
<seg id="19">We lived for 20 years beside them and it was always bad.</seg>

<seg id="21">"today, we could not sleep."</seg>
<seg id="22">We stood up because it was so quiet here - we are not accustomed!</seg>
<seg id="23">"now, where they are finally gone, it will be nice."</seg>
<seg id="24">"Adam Fitzpatrick, Neighbourhood Enforcement Manager of Cornwall Housing, said that it had the family to cooperate with the local authorities."</seg>
<seg id="25">"the family lived in the house where the police were summoned at regular intervals, 20 years"</seg>
<seg id="26">"on the overgrown side of the Municipal House, rubbish and old toys were thrown down"</seg>
<seg id="27">"he added:" "it is a shame that there is the tenant to accept any responsibility for their behaviour and their family, as a delusion is always the last step of taking into account Cornwall Housing."</seg>
<seg id="28">"this was a very difficult case, because the behavior was extreme and their actions for their neighbors had to be awful."</seg>
<seg id="29">"I appreciate all the work that my team, the police of Devon and Cornwall, as well as members of the church who have courageously walked to us and gave us the information."</seg>
<seg id="30">"I hope this development will donate some of its neighbors, and the message conveys that anti-social behaviour is not tolerated."</seg>
<seg id="31">"Fitzpatrick said that all three sons had lived in the house at different times, but that they were all over 20."</seg>
<seg id="32">A dirty mattress left behind in one of the bedrooms of the house after delogation on the ground</seg>
<seg id="33">The workers of the home administration will now have to clean up garbage mountains that surround the house</seg>
<seg id="34">"in 2014, the police conducted a raid in the house and found about 70g of cannabis as well as scales, parapia and cash in the amount of £1,700."</seg>
<seg id="35">Skeldon received a fine sentence after she found herself guilty of the owner of a class B drug.</seg>
<seg id="36">She claimed that the money was for a tombstone of her son Lee Skeldon who died in 2013 in a car accident.</seg>
<seg id="37">"after being without shelter, it is assumed that Tanya and her partner are now living in a private accommodation in Plymouth."</seg>
<seg id="38">Many room walls of the house were labelled with graffiti.</seg>
<seg id="39">"the police says that they will delogate renters, who do not stick to the house rules"</seg>
<seg id="40">Angela Crow from the police of Devon and Cornwall told that delogation was a clear warning to the other tenants who do not obey house rules.</seg>
<seg id="41">"this goes to those who think they can behave without self-reproach, as well as those who were damaged by such a behavior," she said. "</seg>

<seg id="2">"whoever does not adapt and praises Erdogan sits on packed suitcases," says the "" CV-Close Foundation "" dialog and world, Ercan Karakoyun. "</seg>
<seg id="3">"in the short term, the Kurdish community of Germany expects tens of thousands of protective seekers fleeing from Turkey to Germany."</seg>
<seg id="4">"in the medium term, it could even become" a few hundred thousand, "believes the president Ali Toprak."</seg>
<seg id="5">"because of the hard drive of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan after the coup attempt, the Kurdish community of Germany expects a mass flight to Germany."</seg>
<seg id="6">"at short notice, I reckon with tens of thousands, in the medium term with some hundred thousand protesters from Turkey in Germany, if the Erdogan regime continues to fight the minorities and the democratic opposition," says the President Ali Toprak of the "World" from Friday. "</seg>
<seg id="7">"because the government already overtook Kurdish burgeons with impairments before months, 500,000 Kurds within Turkey were on the run."</seg>
<seg id="8">"after the whipped putsch, still secular and oppositional ethnic Turks were added."</seg>
<seg id="9">Many will want to start new in Europe if they are further suppressed in Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="10">"it cannot be that a state, which itself absorbs refugees, produces refugees in their own country," said Toprak. "</seg>
<seg id="11">"the Verbandschef accused the targeted settlement of Syrian Arabs in Kurdish, but also in alevitical cities."</seg>
<seg id="12">"with this, Erdogan wants to increase the tear pressure on the remaining Kurds."</seg>
<seg id="13">"they are the last large minority in Turkey, the Christian Armenians and Greeks have already been eradicated or distributed over the past hundred years," "said Toprak, who is also a CDU member."</seg>
<seg id="14">"the German government demanded that the Federal Government is" "as sharp as Austria against Erdogan and its followers." ""</seg>

<seg id="2">Strange Mecklenburg-Vorpommern: the locals get nothing from summer campaign with - and the holidaymakers from North Rhine-Westphalia are not allowed to choose the country day.</seg>
<seg id="3">In Mecklenburg-Vorpommern they understood.</seg>
<seg id="4">"2021 will not take place again at the end of the summer holidays, the Schwerin Parliament has already decided at the beginning of the year."</seg>
<seg id="5">"because stupid than hitherto it is not: summer holidays, heat and land election campaign - that bites itself."</seg>
<seg id="6">"the locals, who are to be convinced by the election fighters, are on vacation."</seg>
<seg id="7">"most of the vacationers who are in the country, on Usedom, Rügen or Hiddensee are no locals, so they are not allowed to choose the country day."</seg>
<seg id="8">"practical problems come: during the holidays, helpers, posters, inflating air balloons, distribute flyers and end up voices at the end, are only laborious."</seg>
<seg id="9">"until September 4, 2016, the electoral and final holiday day, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern has to pass the election campaign just under the crowd."</seg>
<seg id="10">"the hot phase, if you can say it at all, has just begun."</seg>
<seg id="11">"and it's also about something: Prime Minister Erwin Sellering, leader of a SPD / CDU coalition, must be afraid of his ministry."</seg>
<seg id="12">"the SPD, the strongest party since 1998, is now clear behind the CDU."</seg>
<seg id="13">It is exciting how strongly Neuling AfD cuts off and what remains at the end of the coalition-dust.</seg>
<seg id="14">"Sellering, 66 years old and since 2008 head of government, makes an almost inconspicuous election campaign, one sees by his big posters."</seg>
<seg id="15">"he travels through the land, spread roses and chats a little with the people, just as it did his legendary wordcart predecessor Harald Ringstorff."</seg>
<seg id="16">"otherwise, Seelering gets cold feet and chancellor Merkel sets blame on the blossoming of the AfD."</seg>
<seg id="17">"your refugee policy, you" We create that "accelerated the rise of the right-wing populists, which will probably cost him the beautiful office."</seg>
<seg id="18">"the CDU with its top candidate, the Minister of Interior, Lorenz Caffier, has already experienced how it is, if you are at the right place at the right place."</seg>
<seg id="19">She has twice been invited by Chancellor Angela Merkel; Merkel's parliament is located in the north-east.</seg>
<seg id="20">"but the target group did not agree, there were more North Rhine-Westphalia, Berlin and Saxony as Mecklenburg and Vorpommern."</seg>
<seg id="21">"it was probably the majority of other federal states," said Vincent Coert, Secretary General of the CDU in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, recently in NDR. "</seg>
<seg id="22">But it is too bad to anybody from other corners of Germany to listen to Angela Merkel.</seg>
<seg id="23">"otherwise, the Nordost-CDU does not renounce the usual election campaigns on marketplaces and before shopping malls with umbrellas and balloons."</seg>
<seg id="24">"that, says Kokert, plays only a" subordinate role. ""</seg>
<seg id="25">"the Union, too, has noted that in the country you are breaking away the base that it must be very strict, again to find a wire to the people."</seg>
<seg id="26">"it is like the left, the SPD, the Greens: in the pages of the country hardly exist."</seg>
<seg id="27">"the Council of the CDU election fighter Kokert on his fellow workers is also self-exposing:" "you have to go where it wows, namely where people are: Dorffest, Golden Weddings, every birthday party must be used."</seg>
<seg id="28">"because much is on the game, Sellering has called his SPD for a particularly committed election campaign."</seg>
<seg id="29">"in surveys, the Socialists and Democrats last with 22 percent behind partners CDU (25) and just shortly before the AfD (19)."</seg>
<seg id="30">"at the election of 2011, the SPD won a clear 35.6 percent before the CDU (22)."</seg>
<seg id="31">"the Greens, a small party with seven percent in the polls, should make the leap into the land-day."</seg>
<seg id="32">They make a modern virtue out of the holiday poverty and put their election campaign largely on the internet.</seg>
<seg id="33">"online election campaign," says the president Claudia Müller. "</seg>
<seg id="34">"otherwise, green electoral campaigners embark on track search for local stimuli among holidaymakers."</seg>
<seg id="35">"Silke Gajek, the top candidate, curvt straight with a houseboat through the Mecklenburg lakes and finds it even beautiful."</seg>

<seg id="3">"for those responsible for the construction work, starting at 5.30 in the morning and end only at 20 o'clock, there is no praise."</seg>
<seg id="4">"they did everything pretty sharp," Elvira Tetzlaff tells of the Jet petrol station. "</seg>
<seg id="5">This is a super team.</seg>
<seg id="6">There is no delay.</seg>
<seg id="7">"the building site could be relocated to the south at the beginning of the week, until the end of October everything should be finished."</seg>
<seg id="8">"the remuneration of those responsible for construction work will also be praised, for example when it comes to the establishment of accommodation operations."</seg>
<seg id="9">"since the construction site took place on Monday to the south and also the blockage of the asphalt road in Ofterdingen has been lifted, and therefore the connection to Rottenburg has been restored, the traffic situation within the place has eased."</seg>
<seg id="10">The citizens can now return from Ofterdingen from the B 27 back on both sides.</seg>
<seg id="11">The way of escaping through the place seems to go back.</seg>
<seg id="12">"there were some serious complaints," says the deputy chief executive director Florian King, responsible for the transport-related management of the restructuring department. "</seg>
<seg id="13">"the residents of Bachstraße, Steinlachstraße, Hafnerstraße and Weiherrain had to fight with more traffic noise because many creams were looking for and rather familiar to their navi than the signposting."</seg>

<seg id="15">"since the speed limits were not met, the church also encouraged the trade fair from Mössingen."</seg>

<seg id="17">There are already two to three per minute.</seg>
<seg id="18">The quickest was on the way with 77 hours of hour in the Tempo-30 zone.</seg>
<seg id="19">"since the construction site has been moved, however, it has become quieter."</seg>
<seg id="20">"for the businessmen at the B 27, it is only a small consolation that for customers from Rottenburg the street is now open."</seg>
<seg id="21">Business people don't like to have a look at the cards.</seg>
<seg id="22">"but that the B 27 refurbishment in them has led to sales incubation, everyone who is asked to look through."</seg>

<seg id="24">"who has less to do with the" end customer, "so for other companies, for whom the refurbishment has little consequences."</seg>
<seg id="25">"in Maier's car dealership, Thomas Sulz also talks about a" most slight drop, "but also admits that" the learner is missing. ""</seg>
<seg id="26">The most heavily exploited are the local ones along the road.</seg>
<seg id="27">"J. Albert Göhner, owner of the Steakhouse, formerly Krone, finds clear words."</seg>
<seg id="28">This is already existential.</seg>
<seg id="29">"not only him, but all inns have hit it" hard. ""</seg>
<seg id="30">"the customers were missing from Hechingen, Balingen and Rottweil."</seg>
<seg id="31">We must be happy about every euro turnover.</seg>

<seg id="33">"the" "Straßensanagement" "was thrown back for two years."</seg>
<seg id="34">He had to dismiss half of his employees.</seg>
<seg id="35">"if I had a company with 4,000 employees and half would have been dismissed, politics would have responded differently."</seg>
<seg id="36">"instead, President Jörg Schmidt has responded to a request by Göhner, whether it could give financial compensation, otherwise benefiting from the advantages of the location on the B 27. now they also have to bear the disadvantages caused by the refurbishment."</seg>
<seg id="37">"GÖHNER knows from other districts, where so much more generous is handled."</seg>
<seg id="38">"with all complaints, Göhner is confident that his restaurant will continue."</seg>
<seg id="39">"after all, the family business has already settled here since 1715, he points to the long history."</seg>
<seg id="40">"now, that other regular guests can visit less frequently due to complicated traffic management, he can understand."</seg>
<seg id="41">"if you cannot come here, it is also quite nice."</seg>
<seg id="42">"returning to the end of the refurbishment work, Göhner has no doubts."</seg>
<seg id="43">"despite the crises with BSE and avian influenza, Göhner considers the effects of the B 27 construction work on its customers for the biggest crisis, which has experienced its restaurant in its long history."</seg>

<seg id="9">Also in doing that I take part.</seg>
<seg id="10">"but the minister of the Interior, however, is located on results and on a" achievable consensus "within the coalition."</seg>
<seg id="11">"after the recent attacks in Wuerzburg and Ansbach, de Maizière had a little time to store before he presents his conclusions for security in the Republic."</seg>
<seg id="12">But these are all the more extensive.</seg>
<seg id="13">"some have already been announced, announced, announced, that a new security authority in order to ensure encrypted communication is not new."</seg>
<seg id="14">It is also not the fact that Germany has to implement several EU directives on air passengers and weapons law.</seg>
<seg id="15">The call for more video surveillance and personnel for the security authorities is not surprising.</seg>

<seg id="17">"this will be difficult points for the SPD," the CDU is granted. "</seg>
<seg id="18">"nevertheless, he thinks this is reasonable and does not demand anything that has no chances in the coalition partner anyway."</seg>
<seg id="19">A few new ideas are presented as Maizière.</seg>
<seg id="20">They have partly in themselves: he plans fast-trial for deportations and more possibilities for detention of people from deportation.</seg>
<seg id="21">"refugees, who are systematically brought into the country, should check their smartphones in advance and open social media accounts for a safety check."</seg>
<seg id="22">"for asylum seekers for expired asylum seekers, he wants to make some worse than hitherto - such as those who commit crimes or deliberately throw off their papers to disguise their identity."</seg>
<seg id="23">Some of them are political and legally sanctified.</seg>
<seg id="24">Some of them are still unbalanced and can be answered questions openly.</seg>
<seg id="25">"and with some points - in the imbalance of patient, for example - the question arises: what does this have to do with safety and terror?"</seg>
<seg id="26">"yes, de Maizière says it is important to differentiate between the subjects of refugees and terror."</seg>
<seg id="27">But it cannot be said that the assassinations of Ansbach and Wuerzburg were refugees.</seg>
<seg id="28">"in addition, many people worried about security in view of the high number of refugees."</seg>
<seg id="29">And things that the people are profoundly employed could not clash themselves in electoral periods.</seg>
<seg id="30">The inner safety is enormously moved into the focus.</seg>

<seg id="32">Then the attacks in Würzburg and Ansbach.</seg>
<seg id="33">The uncertainty is great.</seg>

<seg id="36">"in the past few days, it went up between the two parties."</seg>
<seg id="37">"only a tender dispute over the equipment of the Federal Police, then via a security policy collection of some Unions Interior Minister, in which the Ressortchiefs also demand a Burka ban and a reversal of the double citizenship."</seg>
<seg id="38">De Maizière is also working here to reconcile sound.</seg>

<seg id="40">We have fixed the discussion in Germany.</seg>

<seg id="2">Lonely men of middle age love records.</seg>
<seg id="3">"before you hurry to the commentsection, to persuade him under the pseudonym non-AlleEinsamenAlters with rough insults, this statement derives from current data."</seg>
<seg id="4">"according to YouGov, the much discussed re-emergence of vinyl records is not attributable to a boom in millennials who want to welcome the news of physical objects, but to Midlife nostalgia."</seg>
<seg id="5">Those who have recently bought a record are all foresight after the age between 45 and 54.</seg>
<seg id="6">"in fact, the age group of 18-24 is the most improbable farmer group."</seg>
<seg id="7">There is also no hordes by hobby collectors - it has an emotional meaning: older record buyers keep their feelings rather for themselves (56% vs. 53%) and enjoy it alone (69% vs. 66%).</seg>
<seg id="8">But do the results of YouGov agree?</seg>
<seg id="9">"if this blog would be a news report on TV, I would follow the camera while I run in the middle of a busy street in Soho, a modest gray suit, keeping my hands and some determinant say like:" so, let's take a closer look at it. "</seg>
<seg id="10">So let's take a look at it.</seg>
<seg id="11">"even though the heart of Soho gets lost in its charm - hotels, restaurants and offices now fill the buildings in which once independent sellers were resident - there is still a handful of fantastic record specialty shops."</seg>
<seg id="12">I would probably ask the cameraman to switch off the camera for the next part in which I stand in close proximity to various men in such shops and try to assess their age and mind through observation.</seg>
<seg id="13">"art from Glasgow, 55, whom I from Sister Ray (number of data: two young women, three men of middle age) into Reckless Records (number of data: eight men middle aged, one woman, presumably around 20), is one day long because of a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the few hours."</seg>
<seg id="14">"is he a collector, I ask?"</seg>
<seg id="15">"I guess already," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="16">"I have about 3,000 or 4,000 plates."</seg>
<seg id="17">"these vinyl records, shown above (he sent me the snapshot by e-mail, I haven't followed him home), dress the walls of his living room."</seg>
<seg id="18">"the reason why he has such a considerable number of albums and singles, is the result of his available income: he is now able to buy records he could not afford than they appeared and buy items he sold when he was young and plastered."</seg>
<seg id="19">"many things I buy are from the late 60s, early 70s, who appeared when I was 11 or 12. things where I was probably something too young to buy them," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="20">"he agrees that those who buy records are rather introverted and would like to spend time alone, and adds:" I don't smoke and I don't drink very much. "</seg>
<seg id="21">This is my vice.</seg>
<seg id="22">"WEZ, 25, who works at Sister Ray believes that many customers, whom he meets, apply to the YouGov profile."</seg>
<seg id="23">"he also noticed a new wave of people who are influenced by the media, people who have heard about the comeback and have prompted themselves to buy their old records."</seg>
<seg id="24">"from the conversations I have led, people normally have been emptied around 1998 or 1999 in their collection."</seg>
<seg id="25">"customers who once sold their records to buy CDs, sell their CDs now to buy their records," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="26">This would explain the boom to trailers of a certain age.</seg>
<seg id="27">But what about the alleged emotional significance of plates?</seg>
<seg id="28">It takes only a few seconds in a shop like phonica to realize that record stores offers a calming community of like-minded people.</seg>
<seg id="29">"according to Wez, some of the older customers accepted the contactless payment system."</seg>
<seg id="30">"some record fans feel overwhelmed by the digital world and want to revert back to the stability of familiar soundtracks, from objects that are happy to evoke experiences."</seg>
<seg id="31">"I think, sometimes it can be the filling of a void or possession of material possessions as a kind of comfort," says Wez. "</seg>
<seg id="32">That's the case with me as a collector and I think it is so with many people.</seg>
<seg id="33">It is a simple way to deal mentally.</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "we are like their social workers!" "solder a staff from a plate stack."</seg>
<seg id="35">A survey conducted by the ICM in April revealed that nearly 50% of the people who bought a record last month have not yet stopped.</seg>
<seg id="36">"the survey also found that 41% have a turntable that they never use while 7% of those who buy a record, no record player."</seg>
<seg id="37">"at this time of the news report, I would probably look very anxious while I see through a stack of Bossa Nova compilations."</seg>
<seg id="38">"Jonny, 42, who works at Sounds of the Universe (Number of data: three men of middle age), has noticed a" trophic aspect "of the revival."</seg>
<seg id="39">"someone came here recently and said," "I don't have a turntable, but I would like to buy a Radiohead LP, so that I can put them into a shelf", "he says."</seg>
<seg id="40">"this is not a big percentage, but it definitely happens."</seg>
<seg id="41">"more product-lasered, less musical."</seg>
<seg id="42">"we have people who say," "I don't have a turntable."</seg>
<seg id="43">"these are younger people, not older, who only slowly cleave."</seg>
<seg id="44">"Fopp, which has devoted the vinyl records almost a whole floor, has a blower audience when I am going to clean."</seg>
<seg id="45">"there are couples around the 70, tourists who make photos, teenagers and women middle age."</seg>
<seg id="46">"even though the atmosphere is somewhat less relaxed than in the above-mentioned shops, wild beasts latest synthesizer- and sex-packed pop in place of the speakers - is good to see such diversity among customers."</seg>
<seg id="47">"no one of them looks lonely lonely, but nagging psychological traumas are hard to find when standing next to someone 30 seconds."</seg>
<seg id="48">"Elanora, 27, has been running around for a few minutes and looks at the variety of panels for sale."</seg>
<seg id="49">It rather makes a window mannequin than a big shopping.</seg>
<seg id="50">"it does not deserve much, so collecting plates is not a real option, says it."</seg>
<seg id="51">It costs a lot.</seg>
<seg id="52">"it is easy to listen to music from a computer or in other ways, but the beauty of records is..." it drives off with a dearest sigh. "</seg>
<seg id="53">I don't know how to explain it - it really is unique.</seg>
<seg id="54">My last stop is a business that is said to have inspired a new generation of record lovers: urban Outfitters.</seg>
<seg id="55">"while I seem to watch the jeans hot pants, I watch a group of young teenage girls who are grouping for a moment around Polaroid cameras before a father and his daughter are thinking about buying a Crosley record player."</seg>
<seg id="56">"on the left there is a staircase, a wall full of plates from Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mixture of contemporary music and classics, the essential plates for an average collection."</seg>
<seg id="57">"nobody sees them - perhaps because they are only purely decorative, some so far above that it is impossible to touch them."</seg>
<seg id="58">It is pure "record art."</seg>
<seg id="59">"but considering that any attraction for these objects could mean more money for the industry and could send some customers to the depths of Sohos for more, there is nothing to complain."</seg>
<seg id="60">"it is no surprise that a population group, which has more time and money than others, is also the one that is most suitable for luxury items like plates."</seg>
<seg id="61">"even if my research shows that the results of YouGov agree, they leave, at least in record stores in Soho, the large number of female collectors and record-lovers that exist in reality, record stores and online forums."</seg>
<seg id="62">These people probably work hard at school or in offices.</seg>
<seg id="63">"they spend their Thursday morning with security not with the bumble through record stores of Berwick Street and the leaves through records, while they avoid the starving look of an uncanny, 30-year-old false moderator who raged nothing of the middle aged over the shoulders."</seg>

<seg id="2">"a French court rejected an offer of authorities in Calais, dozens of temporary shops and restaurants in the jungle of Calais, in which thousands of refugees live."</seg>
<seg id="3">"in case of a trial hearing this week the authorities in Calais argued that the state should be authorised to sell 72 temporary businesses, selling hairdressing services, or sell tea for 50 cents (40 pence) or simple meals for a few euros in provisional restaurants."</seg>
<seg id="4">"the Calais prefecture argued that these places were supposed to be torn down because they would represent a parallel economy, from which no taxes were paid, and the risk of fire and sanity."</seg>
<seg id="5">"humanitarian groups divided the court that the shops and restaurants are important, as the free meals offered by the state supported association and other groups cannot provide enough food for the growing numbers in the camp."</seg>
<seg id="6">They also realized that the temporary shops and restaurants often offer accommodation and free meals for people in need.</seg>
<seg id="7">"a court in Lille decided that there would be no legal basis for the deportation of people who operate the 72 provisional businesses, but granted that the concerns of the prefecture of Calais are absolutely understandable."</seg>
<seg id="8">"the judge Jean-François Molla said that the grocery stores, cafes and restaurants would play a much larger role than just people who live in extremely precarious conditions."</seg>
<seg id="9">He said that the areas offer quiet reunion between refugees and volunteers.</seg>
<seg id="10">"one of the places threatened by tearing was the Jungle Book Kids' Café of the camp, which is operated as a non-profit and 200 meals a day, English and French classes as well as a consultation on asylum cases for the hundreds of vulnerable, unaccompanied minors in the camp."</seg>
<seg id="11">More than 170.000 people signed the petition to preserve the Kids' Café.</seg>
<seg id="12">"in a letter to the Guardian, it was said that" closure "would be a catastrophe for these children, of which the youngest are eight years old."</seg>
<seg id="13">"the two aid organisations Help Refugees and L'Auberge des Migrants estimated on Friday that the number of people in the Dschungellager climbed over 9,000 people - the highest number until now - after a steep increase of new arrivals in the course of summer."</seg>

<seg id="2">The impressive performance of Britain at 7-er Rugby came to the final on Thursday evening to a abrupt stop at the last hurdle in the form of the Fijis when they were beaten with a result of 43-7 at the Deodoro Stadium here in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="3">"Fiji distributed a class class in handling, side-stepping, post-back, line run and raw power to win gold - their first Olympic medaille of any color."</seg>
<seg id="4">"the defeat was missed by the not too bad price of silver medal - Britain's fourth on this day - and they could be proud of their efforts in this tournament, in which they struck New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa."</seg>
<seg id="5">"the clear defeat of the Boks, 7-5 in the semifinals on the same day could fall back to them in the final."</seg>
<seg id="6">"but regardless of this, Fiji would have defeated a 15-man team at this form."</seg>
<seg id="7">"it could be a consolation for the UK - but will probably not - that at least a Brite tomorrow will have a gold medal for his neck: Fijis head trainer Ben Ryan, the former head of England from Wimbledon."</seg>
<seg id="8">GB had a difficult path behind him.</seg>
<seg id="9">"eight years ago, she lost each game at Adelaide Sevens."</seg>
<seg id="10">Here they lost only one.</seg>
<seg id="11">"this flap will hurt, but progress is amazing."</seg>
<seg id="12">Fiji began miraculously and dismissed the attacks of GBs out of fun.</seg>
<seg id="13">"it felt for the captain Tom Mitchell to and Co., as if one would run in drifting buses. the World Series winners went 5-0 upwards, when Osea Kolinisau was over in the corner."</seg>
<seg id="14">"with four minutes of playing time, Jerry Tuwai added another attack from the right corner he walked."</seg>
<seg id="15">12-0 and GB hardly touched the ball.</seg>
<seg id="16">"a raging Tackle of Mitchell stopped the mountain of Mann Leone Nakarawa a third goal, but it has only stopped Fiji."</seg>
<seg id="17">"in the seventh minute, jasa Veremalua lete a touch down in the right corner and it stood 0-17 for GB."</seg>
<seg id="18">Nakarawa added a new one since the re-fiffff and there was still over a minute of playing time... in the first half.</seg>
<seg id="19">Vatemo Ravouvou presided by further weak tacklings of the GB team and stormed up to the line to make a gate.</seg>
<seg id="20">The conversion brought a 29-0 to the break.</seg>
<seg id="21">"it's like Fiji was born to play the 7, while GB was still seeded."</seg>
<seg id="22">This is how it is.</seg>
<seg id="23">"GB conducted fundamental changes in half-time and closed the fijian gap... for whole four minutes, which was good for the conditions of the first half-time until Joshua Tuisova went through a brilliant interim play of Fiji."</seg>
<seg id="24">"Dan Norton started an attempt for GB, made a touchdown in the left corner for a 36-7, but the game had long been running for the South seeinate whose fans cheeks, flags and danced on the tribune."</seg>
<seg id="25">It was not difficult to admire the playful approach Fijis.</seg>

<seg id="29">"Kyle Brown brought the Boks in the first half to the front, but Dan Norton broke the line with an impressive footwork and scored a gate under the posts in the second half."</seg>

<seg id="9">I had bladder cancer that is operable and that did it.</seg>

<seg id="14">"his tasks have been very diverse and they extended from water-line construction and maintenance work on office and organizational activities, the budget planning, calculation of fees and contributions to emergency interventions at weekends," said the chairman. "</seg>
<seg id="15">"as an outstanding event, it called the start-up and inauguration of the new fountains (1994), land purchases in the area of the new fountains (1998), the renovation of the high-tank (1999), the re-purchase of a central computer control (2004) and the replacement of water pipes."</seg>

<seg id="2">The scratch-packed and energy-intensive German steel industry remains spared by additional costs in millions of millions.</seg>
<seg id="3">Financial burdens that threatened the industry from green electricity subsidies are from the table.</seg>
<seg id="4">"it remains in the liberation of the renewables inlay in the existing plants for the so-called" "power production in the German steel industry", "said German Federal Minister of Economic Affairs, Sigmar Gabriel (SPD) of the" "Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung" "(WAZ, FridayEdition)."</seg>
<seg id="5">I am really glad that we could finally reach the tough negotiations after two years.</seg>
<seg id="6">"the European Commission therefore initially planned to use the steel producers, the gases coming from the blast furnace to generate electricity for their own consumption, to request the cashier."</seg>
<seg id="7">"according to the German industry association, the steel industry has threatened additional costs of 120 to 240 million euros per year according to the German industry association."</seg>
<seg id="8">"Gabriel said the WAZ, there is now a certificate with the European Commission for talks with Commissioner Margrethe Vestager."</seg>
<seg id="9">"only when the generators are replaced in the steel works, an EEG levy is 20 percent."</seg>
<seg id="10">But this will not be raised in the steel industry.</seg>
<seg id="11">IG Metall welcomed Germany's agreement with the European Commission for power production.</seg>
<seg id="12">"in this way, the status quo of the previous regulation is largely written."</seg>
<seg id="13">The successful efforts of Gabriel for the steel industry have special significance.</seg>
<seg id="14">"with regard to our campaign 'Steel is future', this is a first step."</seg>
<seg id="15">"others have to follow."</seg>
<seg id="16">"even in the reform of emissions legislation, climate and employment targets are weakened," explained IG Metall-Chef Jörg Hofmann in Frankfurt. "</seg>
<seg id="17">The steel industry in Europe has been suffering from overcapacity and considerable price pressure since the financial crisis in 2008.</seg>
<seg id="18">"last year, the situation further intensified when the world's largest producer in China threw massive steel on the world market in view of the weakening domestic demand."</seg>
<seg id="19">European manufacturers throw off Chinese steel companies price dumping.</seg>
<seg id="20">"in the course of this spring, the situation has been somewhat relaxed."</seg>
<seg id="21">"on the one hand, a suspended import tariff on importing steel effects, on the other hand the economic prospects in China have emerged."</seg>
<seg id="22">It is unclear how sustainable the price collection is.</seg>
<seg id="23">The German industry primus Thyssenkrupp was cautious on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="24">"last but not least, the prices would have been more stagnating."</seg>
<seg id="25">The industry responds to the difficult situation with further cost reductions.</seg>
<seg id="26">ThyssenKrupp recently didn't want to exclude the closing of individual works.</seg>
<seg id="27">"in the German steel industry, around 86000 people were employed at the end of 2015."</seg>
<seg id="28">"in July, the German steel producers remain careful despite rising prices and increasing orders."</seg>
<seg id="29">"with 3.4 million tons it produced a good six percent less rough steel than in the previous year, as the economic unification of steel shared on Friday."</seg>
<seg id="30">"after a short increase in May, the set quantity went back to the second month in a row."</seg>

<seg id="1">"community, mind, health: singing does seniors good"</seg>
<seg id="2">"singing has accompanied Ursel Kipp already her whole life: as a young girl she was in the school choir, in teacher's studies she occupied the subject of music, and today the 78-year-old sings in a seniors choir."</seg>
<seg id="3">"singing moves me - emotional and physical," she describes. "</seg>
<seg id="4">"after a rehearsal, she feels balanced, cheerful and overall alive, she says."</seg>
<seg id="5">"at the same time, she does something good for her health and spirit."</seg>
<seg id="6">"because singing is a great hobby for seniors from several perspectives, says Erhard Hackler from the German senior league."</seg>
<seg id="7">"most seniors sing in the choir and share with like-minded the joy of music, describes Hackler."</seg>
<seg id="8">Regular interaction enables seniors to socialize and maintain social contacts.</seg>
<seg id="9">"social and family structures often come from age, a choir is then an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people."</seg>
<seg id="10">This experience has also made Ursel Kipp in her choir: "to speak and organize to be able to rely on the others and to learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of being together.</seg>
<seg id="11">"singing can be exhausting in a positive sense, says Hackler."</seg>
<seg id="12">The seniors train a deep and controlled respiration.</seg>
<seg id="13">Those who regularly request his lungs are not so fast from the puff in everyday life.</seg>
<seg id="14">"even when it comes to receiving the sound of the voice at age, singing is an optimal hobby."</seg>
<seg id="15">"for older people, Singen often has a very special effect, says Ursula Lenz from the Federal Labour Community of Senior Citizens."</seg>
<seg id="16">"in the older generations the common singing had a much higher priority, it belonged to everyday life, both in school and leisure time, she explains."</seg>
<seg id="17">"Lenz often observes that singing or hearing of songs in elderly people arouses many memories, often combined with positive feelings of her youth-time."</seg>
<seg id="18">"with lyrics and especially melodies, even dementia disturbs themselves for long past events."</seg>
<seg id="19">"in singing, the head also demands special power, explains Lenz."</seg>
<seg id="20">At the same time focus on your own voice and on a given rhythm and adapt to the other singers - this is a great cognitive challenge.</seg>
<seg id="21">"even older people, who live alone, practice not only to concentrate on themselves."</seg>
<seg id="22">"another positive aspect is the recognition you experience through singing in the choir, says Hackler."</seg>
<seg id="23">An enthusiastic audience is a great praise.</seg>
<seg id="24">The self-esteem also grows through singing in the choir.</seg>
<seg id="25">"to show oneself: if I take long for something, I will better and grow up beyond me - this experience strengthens."</seg>
<seg id="26">"good reasons to start singing, so there is enough."</seg>
<seg id="27">"who wants to try a new hobby should not hesitate, even if he means having little talent, says Lenz."</seg>
<seg id="28">"you don't sing alone - with 50 singing people, who already hear when a sound is next to it?"</seg>
<seg id="29">"looking for the right offer, seniors have different possibilities, says Hackler."</seg>
<seg id="30">"if someone comes from the circle of acquaintances in a senior choir, one can simply join."</seg>
<seg id="31">Many cities also offer views over the choirs in the surroundings.</seg>
<seg id="32">Those who want to sing in a church choir can contact the church or the Church leader directly.</seg>
<seg id="33">Many senior choirs can also be found on the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="34">"if you don't have access to the Internet, the family, friends or neighbours can ask for help with internet research."</seg>
<seg id="35">"if you want to sing, one should necessarily join a choir, advises Hackler."</seg>
<seg id="36">Singing does the soul well and has something liberating - that is true for all ages.</seg>

<seg id="8">"according to the police, a Thai people were killed and about 20 people were injured, including the Austrians, three Germans, three Dutch and three Italians."</seg>
<seg id="9">"in the early morning, two explosives were once again high, and a further person was killed according to the authorities."</seg>

<seg id="12">"in Surat Thani at the south-east coast of the country, then another bomb exploded, which killed a municipal employee."</seg>

<seg id="15">"one should go from a connection to the explosions in Hua Hin, it was called it."</seg>
<seg id="16">"the bombings carry the same manuscript," said Armed Forces Danai Kritmethavee Fridays early in front of journalists. "</seg>
<seg id="17">We assume that it is a co-ordinated attack.</seg>
<seg id="18">"it is too early to express itself to possible motives - probably, however, about the actions of Muslim rebels."</seg>
<seg id="19">"Thai media also wanted to see a pattern, typical for the bombings of Muslim separatists in the south of the country."</seg>
<seg id="20">"the Thai police, on the other hand, stated that the attacks were not in connection with the Islamist insurgency movement or with international terrorism."</seg>
<seg id="21">"this is only local sabotage limited to limited areas and provinces," "said a spokesman in Bangkok."</seg>
<seg id="22">"rather, one assumes that the bombs of opponents of the ruling military junta have been laid."</seg>
<seg id="23">"in recent days, the authorities would have kept secret references to imminent attacks in the south of the country - however, they were not informed of the exact time and places."</seg>
<seg id="24">Still unclear what group behind the attacks.</seg>

<seg id="31">Increased security risk (security level 2) suffered for the rest of the country.</seg>
<seg id="32">The attacks on Thursday and Friday spent a few days after a controversial referendum on a Constitution elaborated by the military junta.</seg>
<seg id="33">This gives great influence to the military in the coming years.</seg>
<seg id="34">"Junta boss and Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha said that bombs were an attempt to stiften chaos, while the country moves towards stability, an improvement of economic situation and tourism."</seg>
<seg id="35">"the military unta, which in 2014 had seized power after a phase of bloody turmoil, keeps itself confident to have led the kingdom back to stability and order."</seg>
<seg id="36">"however, the military did not succeed in getting a grip on the rebellion of Muslim rebels in the extreme south of the country."</seg>
<seg id="37">More than 6500 people have been killed in the conflict.</seg>

<seg id="19">"for the constitutional protection, possible contacts of this kind are only relevant to a certain point."</seg>
<seg id="20">"it depends on whether the respective party - in this case, the AfD - by certain individuals who are extremist, change their direction and thus becomes extremist."</seg>
<seg id="21">So the decisive factor is whether such individuals have an impact on the party.</seg>
<seg id="22">This is not recognizable.</seg>
<seg id="23">"with a view of the significant increase of legitimate offences and attacks on asylum seekers and refugee accommodations, Maate said he would not speak of new right terrorism in this context."</seg>
<seg id="24">But in recent years we have found that there can be right-wing structures.</seg>
<seg id="25">There was the group 'Old School Society' or the Free Group.</seg>
<seg id="26">"it may well be that other right-wing groups or small groups are planning to plan attacks against asylum seekers, refugee sheims or attacks from other right-wing extremist motives."</seg>
<seg id="27">But a nationwide or Europe-wide control of right-wing terrorism is not recognizable.</seg>
<seg id="28">The previous groups were born on the regional level or in social networks.</seg>
<seg id="29">"worried, Maate insisted that many grips went to the account of people who did not appear in the right scene before."</seg>
<seg id="30">This is the worrying.</seg>
<seg id="31">"many of the suspicious attacks on asylum-accommodations are not previously known as criminals, politically motivated criminals or supporters of the right scene."</seg>
<seg id="32">"so many people have committed crimes, which previously had nothing to do with right-wing extremists, who have perhaps been politically indifferent or have elected CDU, the SPD or the Left, which, however, have radicalised themselves by right-wing extremistic mood."</seg>

<seg id="19">The run by Eric Moussambani helped media attention at the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney.</seg>
<seg id="20">"unforgettable was the appearance of the Aquatorial Guinea swimming pool, when he had to start over 100 metres of Freestyle in a run."</seg>
<seg id="21">"at that time, Moussambani was fired at that time."</seg>

<seg id="2">"Snapchat says that this filter is anime-inspired, but some observers say that it is insensitive to races."</seg>
<seg id="3">"with its filtering tool, Snapchat enables around 150 million daily users to change reality and play with identities in such a way that is already adjacent to the absurdity."</seg>
<seg id="4">"you can turn into a pineapple, a dog or a figure that could be from a Roy Lichtenstein painting."</seg>
<seg id="5">"the filters are amazing, property-based tools that produce more than 30 million selfies selfies per day."</seg>

<seg id="7">"in the past Snapchat filters have drawn criticism in the past, in which they were accusing that the app would propel Blackface promoting or white skin as beauty ideal."</seg>
<seg id="8">"as this week suggested some users a filter that gave them slotting, false teeth and undarker cheeks, there were some critics a racist caricature of Asians -" yellow face. ""</seg>
<seg id="9">They asked if these repeated controversies pointed to a bigger problem that the company has diversaturity.</seg>
<seg id="10">"the news and indignation were widespread on Wednesday, with reports from The Verge and Motherboard, a day after Snapchat shared that it had disabled the feature."</seg>
<seg id="11">The company offered an excuse: the filter was intended as an homage to Anime characters and not as caricature from Asians.</seg>
<seg id="12">"but outsiders who have experienced racism, the filter reminded me of injurious clichés."</seg>

<seg id="2">"the military personnel of the United States Central Command changed intelligence information to draw an optimistic picture of the war against the so-called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, as it had allowed the actual conditions on site, reported an inquiry committee of the Congress in a report on Thursday."</seg>
<seg id="3">"the provisional report, created by a Task Force of the Republican Members of the Defence Committee, Secret Service Commitees and the Defense Committee, reports of great dissatisfaction among Central Command Secret Service analysts who reported how superiors changed their assessments to American efforts in the fight against the Islamic State."</seg>
<seg id="4">"the Central Command, short Cencom, is the military headquarters in Tampa, Florida which controls American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia."</seg>
<seg id="5">"judging intelligence, typically sent by high-level Centcom commanders, regularly marked a positive image of US efforts against terrorism as the actual conditions on site had been permitted and were consistently positive as analyses of other news services," cited a newspaper article. "</seg>
<seg id="6">"what happened at Centcom is unacceptable - our soldiers suffer if bad analyses are presented to our political leaders," Ken Calvert, a republican member of the House of Representatives, stated. "</seg>
<seg id="7">The leadership mistakes in CentCom are reaching the top tip of the organization.</seg>
<seg id="8">The ten-sided report shows detailed consistent problems in the years 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analysis of American efforts in the training of Iraqi forces.</seg>
<seg id="9">"although there are no direct indications that government tips under Obama have given instructions to change reports, it shows how analysts have faced the pressure from their superiors, an optimistic picture of the threat of the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL."</seg>
<seg id="10">"during the first half of 2015, many Central Command press releases, statements and statements before the congress were clearly more positive than it meets the facts." "</seg>
<seg id="11">"for example, a CentCom member publicly announced that a military reconquest of the Mossuls could already begin in April or May 2015."</seg>
<seg id="12">"Mossul, second largest city in Iraq, remains under the control of the Islamic State."</seg>
<seg id="13">"after months of investigation, so much is clear." "said Mike Pompeo, a Republican Congress of Congress from Kansas, in an opinion."</seg>
<seg id="14">"from the middle of 2014 to the middle of 2015, the Central Command points changed the monthly reports to download the threat of ISIS in Iraq."</seg>
<seg id="15">The Republicans called the Task Force to live after they were admitted that analysts were worried about the manipulation of reports to the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="16">The report published on Thursday will be completed by more detailed insights and will be continued throughout the investigations.</seg>
<seg id="17">"in addition, further investigations of CentCom reports by the Secretary-General of the Ministry of Defense are underway."</seg>
<seg id="18">"on Thursday, democratic members of the Intelligence Committee published their own findings, which coincided with some of the conclusions of the Republican Task Force."</seg>
<seg id="19">"in 2014 and 2015, Centcom created an excessively restricted process for the creation of intelligence services on ISIL and the Iraqi security services," the highest-level Democrats in the committee, Member of the House of Representatives, Adam B. Schiff, announced in an opinion. "</seg>
<seg id="20">"this process," Mr. Schiff, "delayed the publication of reporting intelligence reports," "the morality was under analyst and" "gave too little room for different opinions."</seg>
<seg id="21">"but Mr. Schiff and the Democrats stated that there was no indication of a" "White House" "intervention in CentCom analysts with regard to a" "certain political opinion". ""</seg>
<seg id="22">The preliminary results of the investigations of the Congress were published on Tuesday by "The Daily Beast."</seg>
<seg id="23">"last August, the New York Times reported by the Pentagon's General Inspector, who were taken up after discomfort of CentCom analysts."</seg>
<seg id="24">"Lt. Cmdr. Patrick Evans, a Pentagon spokesman, gave in an opinion that the Department of Defence would not comment reports of Congress, while investigations of the general inspector are still underway."</seg>
<seg id="25">"but he also admits that" experts sometimes have quite divergent opinions regarding interpretation of complex data, and that the intelligence services and the Ministry of Defense welcomed a controversial debate on these important issues of national defence. "</seg>
<seg id="26">The investigations have repercussions about the question of a successful air campaign under U.S. leadership in Iraq and Syria (a claim that is meanwhile made by a growing number of members of the Ministry of Defense).</seg>
<seg id="27">"however, the allegations of last year have raised the question to what President Obama can rely on the Central Command for honest assessments of military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis regions."</seg>
<seg id="28">"the criticism concerning the secret information about the Islamic State is reminiscent of more than ten years ago, as a Centcom analyst, Gregory Hooker, a writing piece about how the then government under George W. Bush expected only a small occupation force in Iraq and a little time to think about the consequences of the invasion of 2003."</seg>
<seg id="29">Mr. Hooker also played a key role in the insurrection against the current reporting of the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="30">"last year, the team headed by Mr. Hooker stated that against the statements by the government airstrikes against the refineries held by the Islamic State, they had no significant impact on the financial situation of the terrorist group, since these provisional refineries had put into operation to sell oil on the black market."</seg>
<seg id="31">"however, this knowledge was not published, the Times reported in September."</seg>
<seg id="32">"Centcoms then commander, Gen. Lloyd J. Austin III, was criticized by members of the legislature for his excessive positive assessment of the war situation at a hearing before the Senate."</seg>
<seg id="33">General Austin retired in April and was replaced by the Central Command by Gen. Joseph L. Votel.</seg>

<seg id="10">"as ever, the game may start on Saturday, the Americans have triggered a surprising vortex by their success story, four years after they landed at the last London games on the last of 12 places."</seg>
<seg id="11">BAM was part of this team.</seg>
<seg id="12">"she grew up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, and had the first time with three years a hockey stick in hands (her two older sisters played sports at the Drexel University), with 16 years she became national player in the USA, the youngest in the history of the team."</seg>
<seg id="13">"she missed the Olympics in 2008, because she couldn't qualify for the cadre."</seg>
<seg id="14">Then came the year 2012 in which for her and her team everything went wrong.</seg>
<seg id="15">"in the following year Craig Parnham, an Englishman, coach of the National Team and thus began to turn things better."</seg>
<seg id="16">"a change of culture, a mental change and a physical change," said Bam. "</seg>
<seg id="17">We did not have the work gap in London we now have.</seg>
<seg id="18">We have completely snatched the rudder.</seg>
<seg id="19">On Thursday evening Bam opened the Torreigen in the first half of the game with a return cover from the seam area.</seg>
<seg id="20">"India had gone into the game without victory in the tournament, but the team was surprisingly tough and held the game stand from 1-0 to the third quarter until Bam took the game into their hands."</seg>
<seg id="21">"it performed a sprint with the flat ball over the left flank, then moved to the middle and put the ball into the gate to get the American female a 2-0 guide."</seg>
<seg id="22">Melissa Gonzalez made the final goal in the middle of the last quarter.</seg>
<seg id="23">"Shutout was the first of the tournament for the doorkeepers of the USA, Jackie Briggs, who had previously had to book a gate in each of the previous games."</seg>
<seg id="24">It has a run.</seg>
<seg id="25">Just as Bam.</seg>
<seg id="26">"we are in a good position" said Parnham, but how good will depend on the outcome of the next game on Saturday. "</seg>

<seg id="1">"amid the Rage of the Olympic Games, the Zen of the Trampolines"</seg>
<seg id="2">"wherever you are, how late it is, it's the Olympic Games."</seg>
<seg id="3">"the events in Rio de Janeiro feel constantly and inescapable, a rapid relay between competition and pursuit."</seg>
<seg id="4">"it is, as if the Olympic torch itself would be a burning rod, which is handed down from the ArmbrustProtect to the gymnasts for triathletes."</seg>
<seg id="5">"you can't turn on the TV, read a newspaper or listen to the conversation of your neighbour in the queue in the coffeshop, without listening to Simone Biles, Katie Ledecky or the dispute between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos."</seg>
<seg id="6">And then there is Logan Dooley.</seg>
<seg id="7">"Dooley, who is here for the first time at the Olympic Games and a women's black with dimples, could certainly have been among these famous names created by sponsors and well-being TV advertising, if he would be a swimmers, gymnasts or even true."</seg>
<seg id="8">"but Dooley, 28, from Lake Forest, California, fights for gold."</seg>
<seg id="9">The olympic flame does not illuminate any event.</seg>
<seg id="10">"further from the centre, partly in the shade there are the sports which are not universally recognized: air pistol, Archery, Badminton, Taekwondo."</seg>
<seg id="11">We will always have the breast swimming and may it reign for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="12">"but if I am modest to make arguments for my particular darling, then let me draw attention to the discreet charm of the trampoline."</seg>
<seg id="13">"although the trampoline jumping has been an Olympic event since 2000, when it had its debut in Sydney, the last 16 years have been so sparingly perceived that many of the ones that I had questioned, did not know that it is at all an Olympic sport."</seg>
<seg id="14">This could also be regional ignorance.</seg>
<seg id="15">"although the US sent athletes to competition, there has never won a medal in the trampoline jumping and had an athlete until 2012, which made it to the final round."</seg>
<seg id="16">The Chinese and the Russians tend to share the prices for the men and the Chinese and the Canadian ones for women.</seg>
<seg id="17">Dong Dong from China and Rosie MacLennan from Canada will defend their gold medal from London this year.</seg>
<seg id="18">"the trampoline jumping has a certain outer shell, partly because it sounds suitable for the unenlightened ear for a clowns school than that sounds for the Olympic Games."</seg>
<seg id="19">"at this point, I should admit that I am not an expert, but only a sublime enthusiast."</seg>
<seg id="20">"it has humorous potential - the kartoonous trembling of his never-ending sensation - but also the grazie of gymnasium and diving, the two sports that are essentially unified."</seg>
<seg id="21">"the word" "trampoline" "comes from the Spanish El trampoline, which means as much as" springboard. ""</seg>
<seg id="22">"aspiring winners jump on a gigantic trampoline, shoot almost up to 30 feet into the air and must hit a number of falling motions (turning, pike and ointment) before landing on the feet."</seg>
<seg id="23">"they are assessed according to official Olympiaprogram of execution, difficulty and" flight time. ""</seg>
<seg id="24">"thirty-one athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women, will compete against each other in Rio."</seg>
<seg id="25">The most common olympic vector is straight ahead.</seg>
<seg id="26">"medallists have to go to gold in their pursuit of gold, faster, up and down, sometimes to the finish, sometimes back and back, up and downwards on the playground."</seg>
<seg id="27">"they do not only chase the finish line or the baseline, but also in the television broadcast a further increased goal: the world or the Olympiarist."</seg>
<seg id="28">"the goal-oriented aspiration is nobel, admirable, even fanatic - and it is enough to even stir up a spectator to tears."</seg>
<seg id="29">But it is also what I think even when watching these games as something tiring.</seg>
<seg id="30">The trampoline offers an breathing break.</seg>
<seg id="31">The vector of the trampoline is above.</seg>
<seg id="32">A forward movement is not the goal.</seg>
<seg id="33">"he or she prallt, seemingly weightlessly as an astronaut, goes up, then down, then effortlessly back up."</seg>
<seg id="34">"there is also a competition, of course not without difficulty, but during exercise there is no hectic attack on the goal, no wolf in the distance, only the dreamy, elegant suspension of time and gravity."</seg>
<seg id="35">It is as Zen as the competition can only be for the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="36">"the qualification and final rounds of women will take place on Friday afternoon, in streaming at 13.00 Eastern Time; the men on Saturday, also around 13.00."</seg>
<seg id="37">NBC will radiate the final rounds as part of an afternoon on both days from 14.00 onwards.</seg>
<seg id="38">"amid the Olympia-Mania, they promise a quiet, nice moment, one that is probably overlooked in general tumult."</seg>
<seg id="39">"when the increase in consciousness can only be achieved through the anthropoids and objectification of male athletes - as the male US gymnasts recently suggested - then Mr Dooley expects his air to rinse, new fan community."</seg>

<seg id="1">"a generation protests" in Ethiopia, Long an ally of the USA "</seg>
<seg id="2">Violent protests in Ethiopia</seg>
<seg id="3">Demonstrators who demand political changes in Ethiopia met with violent resistance of the government.</seg>
<seg id="4">Witnesses say that tens of thousands of protesters were killed during clashes with the police.</seg>
<seg id="5">Is Ethiopia to collapse?</seg>
<seg id="6">"in the last ten years, it was one of the most stable countries of Africa, a solid ally of the West with a rapidly growing economy."</seg>
<seg id="7">"however, in recent months protests against the government shook the country and spread in more and more areas."</seg>
<seg id="8">Last week thousands of people rushed on the streets and demanded fundamental political changes.</seg>
<seg id="9">"according to human rights organisations, the response of the government was relentless."</seg>
<seg id="10">Witnesses stated that policemen were shot and killed in zig unarmed demonstrators.</seg>
<seg id="11">"in circulation, videos about the protests, which are probably from the last or the beginning of this year, show how security men beat young people with sticks, while they were forced to make a hand stand against a wall."</seg>
<seg id="12">The chief of the UN Human Rights Authority is now asking for a detailed investigation.</seg>
<seg id="13">"it was always difficult to hold this country together and in the future it will even become even more difficult," "said Rashid Abdi, the leader of the Horn of Africa of the International Crisis Group, a research group."</seg>
<seg id="14">Ethiopia is the most populous country in Africa and its stability is appreciated by the West.</seg>
<seg id="15">"American military and secret services work closely with the Ethiopians to fight terrorism beyond the region, especially in Somalia. only a few countries in Africa, if ever, receive so much Western help."</seg>
<seg id="16">Ethiopia's economy expanded at a considerable pace.</seg>
<seg id="17">Its infrastructure has improved dramatically - there is a new commuter train in Addis Ababa.</seg>
<seg id="18">"the roads are usually quiet, safe and clean."</seg>
<seg id="19">"even though Ethiopia was anything but a model for democracy - human rights organisations have continually led the repression by the government - the opposition in the country was restricted, with dissidents were effective to silence."</seg>
<seg id="20">"many were sent to exile or in prison, killed or pushed into the deserts of the desert."</seg>
<seg id="21">But that could change.</seg>
<seg id="22">"if you suppress people and have no other options except protest, it breaks out," said Seyoum Teshome, a lecturer in Central Ethiopia. "</seg>
<seg id="23">The entire youth protested.</seg>
<seg id="24">A generation protested.</seg>
<seg id="25">There are numerous complaints that cover everything from land use to stranglehold in relation to the power of the ruling coalition.</seg>
<seg id="26">"following an extensive criticized election last year, the ruling party and its allies received the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 percent of the parliament."</seg>
<seg id="27">"at the same time, tensions continue along the border to Eritrea; a struggle for this sharp, controversial line demanded hundreds of lives in June."</seg>
<seg id="28">"analysts fear that separatists like the Oromo Liberation Front or the National Liberation Front of the Ogaden, which have been more or less enforced in recent years, use turbulence and could rearm themselves."</seg>
<seg id="29">Several factors explain why feelings of bitterning after years of hypocrisy under the surface now explode.</seg>
<seg id="30">The first seems harmless: smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="31">"only in recent years many Ethiopians were able to communicate with the social media, as cheaper smartphones have become increasingly common and improved Internet services."</seg>
<seg id="32">"even if the government blocks access to Facebook and Twitter, what they are doing at regular intervals, especially in protests, many people can still communicate via internet proxies that hide where they stop."</seg>
<seg id="33">Several young Ethiopians claimed that they were gathered to protest.</seg>
<seg id="34">"the second factor is that there is more solidarity between the Oromos and Amharas, the two largest ethnicities in Ethiopia."</seg>
<seg id="35">The Oromos and Amharas are not natural enemies.</seg>
<seg id="36">"since eons, the Amharas, who come from Ethiopia in predominantly Christian highlands, prospered in politics and economy, while they exploited the Oromos, of which many Muslims are and live in lowland areas."</seg>
<seg id="37">But this also changes.</seg>
<seg id="38">"we are here to co-ordinate under a screen," said Mulatu Gemechu, a leader of the Oromos. "</seg>
<seg id="39">The largest protests took place in the Amresa and Oromos areas.</seg>
<seg id="40">"many Amresas and Oromos have the feeling that Ethiopia is dominated by members of the ethnic group of the Tigray which accounts for about 6 percent of the population and dominant in the military, the intelligence services, trade and politics."</seg>
<seg id="41">The third reason for unrest is the death of Meles Zenawi.</seg>
<seg id="42">"Mr. Meles, a former rebel leader, was up to his death on a non-publicized disease in 2012 17 years of Ethiopia's prime minister."</seg>
<seg id="43">"he was considered a tactical genius, a man who could think about corners."</seg>
<seg id="44">Analysts say that it was especially condensed to detect early signs of dissatisfaction and to use special officials to process opponents and make them harmless.</seg>
<seg id="45">"the current regime lacks this fundamental skill," "said Mr. Abdi, a conflict analyst."</seg>
<seg id="46">"Ethiopian Prime Minister, Hailemariam Desalegn, was chosen for relatively insightful reasons to take the position of Mr Meles."</seg>
<seg id="47">"unlike Mr. Meles, who came from the Tigray region of northern Ethiopia, Mr. Hailemariam comes from the south."</seg>
<seg id="48">Analysts say that he does not enjoy the confidence of the security services controlled by the Tigray.</seg>
<seg id="49">Many fear that the result will be more bloodshed.</seg>
<seg id="50">"the last time Ethiopia was experiencing such a turmoil in 2005, after thousands of elections protested, which, according to the indications of analysts, had apparently been deceived by the government and subsequently stolen."</seg>
<seg id="51">"during the following raids, many protesters were killed, even if there were less than in the last months and this time of unrest went relatively quickly."</seg>
<seg id="52">"development experts praised the Ethiopian leaders for their visionary infrastructure planning, as the new commuter train, as well as their measurable progress in poverty reduction."</seg>
<seg id="53">But obviously this does not prevent the intensification of the internal abnormalities of the Ethiopian government.</seg>
<seg id="54">And she takes a dangerous ethnical form.</seg>
<seg id="55">"last month protesters attacked in Gondar, a shamanic city, from Tigray led businesses and the hatred of the tigray is increasingly common in social media."</seg>
<seg id="56">Analysts say that the protests bring the US and other western allies into a peculiar position.</seg>
<seg id="57">"the American government used Ethiopia as the basis for Dronenoughs on neighbouring Somalia, although it recently announced that it has concluded that base."</seg>
<seg id="58">"while the West clearly wants to support democracy, he does not want its allies to collapse in an already volatile area."</seg>
<seg id="59">"this," said Mr. Abdi, "is a very thin emigration."</seg>

<seg id="2">"Donald J. Trump tried to dissipate the last controversy that surrounds his campaign by attacking that his repeated assertion, President Obama and Hillary Clinton would have been the" founder "of the terrorist group Islamic State, not serious."</seg>
<seg id="3">"this clarification shed new questions on the communication skills of the Republicans, whether he is able to communicate clearly and comprehensively with the American public."</seg>

<seg id="5">"after he had made the hint at a election campaign on Wednesday evening, Mr. Trump returned to the assertion on Thursday and insisted that he really did not intend to interpret, the President and Mrs. Clinton had created ISIS."</seg>
<seg id="6">"but in an early morning tweet on Friday, Mr. Trump said he was simply sarcastic."</seg>
<seg id="7">"the tweet was the contrast to the previous day when Mr. Trump said in a series of interviews, he meant the apology absolutely serious."</seg>
<seg id="8">"when the conservative Radiomorator Hugh Hewitt Mr. Trump wanted to weaken the statement somewhat by reminding him that Mr. Obama wants to destroy ISIS, the Republican candidate did not want to know anything about it."</seg>
<seg id="9">The last storm of criticism prasselt on Mr. Trump while trying to direct the focus of his campaign because of falling demand values to the economic situation.</seg>
<seg id="10">Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton held speeches about the economic situation in Michigan this week.</seg>
<seg id="11">On Friday Mr. Trump tried to return to this subject again.</seg>
<seg id="12">"talking about Twitter, he warned that Mrs. Clinton's suggestions would lead to higher taxes and that he found their speech boring."</seg>
<seg id="13">Mr. Trump has already introduced sarcasm to his defense.</seg>
<seg id="14">"at the end of July he drew strong criticism when he said the Russians should hack Mrs. Clinton's emails, but later he said" Of course I meant the sarcastic. "</seg>
<seg id="15">This method allows Mr. Trump to postpone the linguistic frontiers in politics and then move back to demand.</seg>
<seg id="16">"I think it's one of his methods to test how certain messages are recorded by his fans as they arrive, and then if necessary clarify," "depending on what the reaction falls." "Ruth Sherman, a communication expert, who observes the language of both candidates."</seg>
<seg id="17">"but I think he is clever enough to keep his statements vague enough, so that they can be interpreted in various ways."</seg>
<seg id="18">"instead of sharpening the tone for the presidential elections, Mr. Trump has adopted an even etched sound, since its survey values continued to go back."</seg>
<seg id="19">"a new survey of NBC / Wall Street Journal / Marist published on Friday showed a leadership with a big advantage in North Carolina, Virginia, Colorado and a head-in-head race in Florida."</seg>
<seg id="20">"while Mr. Trump generally tries to apologize for his provocative statements, he often accused his critics to distort his statements or to understand his humor incorrectly."</seg>
<seg id="21">"but while he is increasingly focussed on the focus of attention in the last months of his presidential campaign, Mr. Trumps kidnapping his loyal fellow workers into the uncomfortable situation, regardless of how provocative his statements may be."</seg>
<seg id="22">"Rudolph W. Giuliani, former Mayor of New York and one of Trumps's most prominent intercessors, gave great effort to defend the candidate today in a CNN interview."</seg>
<seg id="23">"I believe what he says are legitimate, political commentaries," Mr. Giuliani said therefore to the correctness of Mr. Trumps statements, whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic State. "</seg>
<seg id="24">"it is true in this sense that before Obama, ISIS was an almost unknown, small organisation, he called it ambassadors, completely wrong and therefore it happened because he withdrew the troops from Iraq."</seg>
<seg id="25">"most mainstream republicans try to argue that the government under Obama, in Mrs. Clinton, served as an external minister, allowed ISIS to spread the situation in the Middle East under control."</seg>
<seg id="26">"before the election campaigns in Pennsylvania on Friday, Mr. Trump continued his attacks on the media and accused them of going around on each of his words and to be preoccupied against him."</seg>
<seg id="27">"he ridiculed the" poor, miserable "television experts who try to understand and said," You cannot!. ""</seg>

<seg id="8">"a revived Verb Cafe opened last November in Greenpoint, less than a mile north of its original location."</seg>
<seg id="9">"the new verb has Wi-Fi and accepts credit cards, but still has some of the same staff and a similarly simple atmosphere."</seg>
<seg id="10">The coffee is still good.</seg>
<seg id="11">"the new owner of the verb is Cisco Rodriguez, a long-standing employee of the old coffee bar, the owner and managing director of the new café."</seg>
<seg id="12">He began working in 2001 at Verb and remained there until the end.</seg>
<seg id="13">"when a customer offered him to provide funds for a new exterior, he was excited to do it, he said."</seg>
<seg id="14">"Rodriguez, 36, kept a lot."</seg>
<seg id="15">Verb uses the same distributor for the bagels bought the same espresso model.</seg>
<seg id="16">It even uses the same lamps from the old verb.</seg>
<seg id="17">But Rodriguez said he wanted to experiment too.</seg>
<seg id="18">He introduced new ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="19">On the menu there are sandwiches with bacon and cheese and there are garages like capers and sauted onions.</seg>
<seg id="20">There are natural keys.</seg>
<seg id="21">"the café serves no beer, but there are fresh juices."</seg>
<seg id="22">"after nine months, Rodriguez said that he had noticed a steady stream of old regular customers."</seg>
<seg id="23">"many old customers were also displaced by prices from Williamsburg," he said. "</seg>
<seg id="24">"recently on a Sunday, Rebecca Oliveira was such a customer."</seg>

<seg id="2">"in March 1933, shortly after his ascent to the president, Franklin Delano Roosevelt took his lunch at the Oval Office."</seg>
<seg id="3">"as a gourmets, President Roosevelt had a Faible for refined Delicatessen of Fifth Avenue like Pâte de foie gras and Maryland water turtle soup."</seg>
<seg id="4">"his menu on this day was slightly more modest: filled eggs in tomato sauce, mashed potatoes and dessert a plum pudding."</seg>
<seg id="5">"it was an act of culinary solidarity with suffering people," said Jane Ziegelman. "</seg>
<seg id="6">"her husband Andrew Coe added," It was also a message to the Americans as they should eat. "</seg>
<seg id="7">The couple lives in Brooklyn Heights and are both food historians.</seg>
<seg id="8">"COEs last book" "Chop suey" "acted by Chinese cuisine in the USA, while Ziegelman told her book" 97 Orchard "about life in a residential house at the Lower East Side from the food perspective."</seg>
<seg id="9">"their latest collaboration," A decent meal, "which will appear on Tuesday at Harper Verlag, illustrates the history of American cuisine during the Great Depression."</seg>
<seg id="10">"they showed culinary solidarity, when they meet with a reporter at the Eisenberg's sandwich shop, a small, schnörkellosem Imbiss in the Flatiron District, which has been in business since the IPO in 1929."</seg>
<seg id="11">"Ziegelman, 54, ordered a fresh cheese sandwich with olives, while Coe, 57, turkey with mashed potatoes and vegetable blend."</seg>
<seg id="12">"when the reporter asked Hackast, this was the couple for a discussion about the food in the era of the Great Depression."</seg>
<seg id="13">"rich food was very popular," "said Ziegelman."</seg>
<seg id="14">"there were peanut bread, liver and bean bread."</seg>
<seg id="15">They were prepared from an ingredient and something cheap that stretches the ingredient.</seg>
<seg id="16">Imagine eating so many peanuts that they serve them as dinner.</seg>
<seg id="17">Encoding: UTF-8</seg>
<seg id="18">"it must have settled in the stomach like lead," he said. "</seg>
<seg id="19">"in the years before the Great Depression, the table was in an American household, especially in rural areas, an all-You-Can-Eat Buffet."</seg>
<seg id="20">"teams of women cooked for male field workers and it was served freshly baked pastels for breakfast, lunch and dinner."</seg>
<seg id="21">"it was the Americans who sent food to starving Europeans during World War II." "a Square Meal" "stands out the ways with which the country was moving, no longer to be the Schlaraffenland."</seg>
<seg id="22">"it was a time when food for the Americans was a central, tense theme," explains why he and his wife wanted to write about it. "</seg>
<seg id="23">"the new budget was just as tense: mysterious food such as loaves and casserollen were stapled to staple food, the casserole as a" wonderful way to reproduce food leftovers, "as cooks could hide unsappetizing ingredients under a creamy sauce."</seg>
<seg id="24">Fresh fruit has been replaced by cheap dry fruit.</seg>
<seg id="25">"meat, which was the center of American cuisine for years, became a very rare luxury."</seg>
<seg id="26">"peculiar mixtures have been tried, since a calorie-rich and nutritious satisfaction had priority over flavor or even healthy cooking sense."</seg>
<seg id="27">"during her research for the book which also includes recipes, Ziegelman prepared a dish from this epoch, baked onions with peanut butter."</seg>
<seg id="28">"it was not any additive at lunchtime," says Coe. "</seg>
<seg id="29">Ziegelmann continues: "it was surreal."</seg>
<seg id="30">Peanut butter and baked onions do not fit together.</seg>
<seg id="31">It was typical for many of the house recipes.</seg>
<seg id="32">"like never before or since, the budget farmers - including Louise Stanley, Head of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics between 1923 and 1943 - the eating habits of the country like this."</seg>
<seg id="33">"by published recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines, they encouraged women to become" housekeeper "and the challenge of transforming Pampe like creamy spaghetti with carrots into delicious meals."</seg>
<seg id="34">"a Square Meal" is a feast of historical delicacies.</seg>
<seg id="35">"in particular, the reports of the government's response to starving citizens, such as President Herbert Hoover's Lass-mir-Cake-Food-attitude."</seg>
<seg id="36">"while he publicly praised the simple Iowa peasant kitchen of his kitchen, he spoke as the millionary man of the world he has become."</seg>
<seg id="37">"he liked continental food like fish with cucumber sauce," said Coe. "</seg>
<seg id="38">He ate in an almost gilded dining room and carried a tuxette.</seg>
<seg id="39">He was wonderfully familiar to reality.</seg>
<seg id="40">"President Roosevelt may have committed the same mistake, if not his wife Eleanor had asked him to statuate with his stomach."</seg>
<seg id="41">"as described in the book, the hypocrites of a household with no interest in tastes caused by Ms Roosevelt showed that the White House produced the most boring food in Washington, but also one of the most controversial."</seg>

<seg id="1">Greenland shark: the oldest cyclone is almost 400 years old</seg>
<seg id="2">Rare sight.</seg>
<seg id="3">Greenland hues usually come to the surface only in winter.</seg>
<seg id="4">This shark was allowed to go back to the sea after an investigation on board the research ship Sanna.</seg>
<seg id="5">It was born in 1624 and swims with a good 1 km / h by the North Atlantic - until today.</seg>
<seg id="6">Greenland has only 150 years of offspring.</seg>
<seg id="7">"leisurely the Greenland-shark floats along the bottom of the North Atlantic, in an hour he reaches an average just 1,220 m."</seg>
<seg id="8">"only when it comes to it, the five-meter-long animal accelerates at satte 2.6 km / h - and is half as fast as a seal with this top speed."</seg>
<seg id="9">"this lifestyle, influenced by slowness, seems to be a godentreprise for a high age."</seg>
<seg id="10">Julius Nielsen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report in the journal Science "at any rate from a Greenland shark that could be 392 years old.</seg>
<seg id="11">"madness," commented Alexander Scheuerlein from the Max Planck Institute for demographic research in Rostock, which means a world record for vertebrates. "</seg>
<seg id="12">"although the evolutionary biologist already suspected, that Grönlandhie was stony-old."</seg>
<seg id="13">Only lacked the evidence.</seg>
<seg id="14">"Greenland haie is difficult to observe, after all, they live mainly in the polar sea in front of the sparsely populated shores of Canada, Greenland, Norway and Spitsbergen."</seg>
<seg id="15">"because they prefer water temperatures around the six degrees Celsius, they usually appear only in winter on the surface."</seg>
<seg id="16">Researchers know little about the lifestyle of Greenland sharks.</seg>
<seg id="17">Their time pentines to them when they equipped six animals with one transmitter in front of Spitsbergen.</seg>
<seg id="18">"this sharks still make this sharks: in the stomach of an animal, researchers found the remains of a seal, another had swallowed the jaw bone of a young polar bear."</seg>
<seg id="19">Possibly they hunt sleep animals or patrol at the bottom of the ice-sea and look for Kadaver that torulls from higher water layers downwards.</seg>
<seg id="20">"Julius Nielsen and his colleagues now studied 28 Greenland sharks, catching fishermen between 2010 and 2013 in front of Greenland or Spitsbergen as a catch from the depth of the North Atlantic."</seg>
<seg id="21">"the smallest shark was just 81 centimeters long, while the greatest 502 cm was measured."</seg>
<seg id="22">"to determine the age of the animals, they analyzed the lens nucleus of sharks with the carbon-14 method."</seg>
<seg id="23">"this centre of the eye lens already arises before the birth of the sharks, the proteins contained in it are later no longer renewed."</seg>
<seg id="24">The two smallest sharks had notably much carbon-14 in the lens-core.</seg>
<seg id="25">"her birth should therefore lie after the early 1960s, as a nuclear weapon-search for larger quantities of this radioactive carbon into the atmosphere."</seg>
<seg id="26">"on the other hand, with 220 centimeters length of third-smallest animal, the lens nucleus softens a small excess of carbon-14 out of the nuclear weapons, so it is likely to have celebrated its 50th anniversary in its investigation in 2012."</seg>
<seg id="27">"in their lenticular nucleus, all larger Greenland-sharks had normal carbon-14-amounts due to cosmic radiation in the atmosphere."</seg>
<seg id="28">"in fact, the carbon-14 clock for a 493 centimetre long Greenland-shark showed an age of 335 years, while the Rekord Hai with 502 centimeters is likely to be 392 years old."</seg>
<seg id="29">"that Greenland-shark females got offspring only then offspring, if they are longer than four meters, was known."</seg>
<seg id="30">Now the researchers could assign an age to the length.</seg>
<seg id="31">"since one of the animals with 392 centimeters probably stood on the threshold of the sexually mature age and his age was determined with 156 years, Greenland sharks with the multiplication obviously allow at least one and a half centuries of time."</seg>
<seg id="32">Also this should be world record for vertebrates.</seg>
<seg id="33">"however, that such methusalemes live above all in icy waters is no coincidence."</seg>
<seg id="34">"the previous record holder, a 211 year old Grönlandwal, caught a 120-year old harpoon head on the neck, was caught in front of Alaska."</seg>
<seg id="35">"due to the low temperatures, the organism of the animals living there often runs on flames."</seg>
<seg id="36">So they mature later - and age slower.</seg>
<seg id="37">"in order to keep warm in cold water, the animals are often very large."</seg>
<seg id="38">Because the volume grows much faster than its surface by which the animal greases heat.</seg>
<seg id="39">The heat loss of one gram mouse is therefore much larger than a gram of elephant.</seg>
<seg id="40">Another advantage: you have less enemies.</seg>
<seg id="41">"a smaller animal lives therefore more dangerous and should focus on as soon as possible as possible as possible as possible," explains the evolutionary biologist Scheuerlein. "</seg>
<seg id="42">"on the other hand, a very big animal should rather invest his resources into a long life."</seg>

<seg id="2">The registrants from the pastoral care unit Eyachtal-Haigerloch of St. Anna were on the way on a four-day pilgrimage from Villingen to Freiburg.</seg>
<seg id="3">"together, four stages were accomplished."</seg>
<seg id="4">"in order to bridge the time to the next pilgrimage of all the ministries in two years, the first round of St. Anna has decided to prepare and carry out a multi-day pilgrimage."</seg>
<seg id="5">"various pilgrimage destinations were examined and we finally decided for the Bischofsstadt Freiburg, where in this year the Holy Year of Mercy was given a special pilgrimage destination during the Holy Year of Charity."</seg>
<seg id="6">"16 Minis from Bittelbronn, Gruol, Haigerloch and Heiligenzimmern were on the way."</seg>
<seg id="7">"in the evening before, Parish Storost sent pilgrims in a small celebration in St. Anna, blessed the Pilgrimage and told the Pilgrims."</seg>
<seg id="8">"from Horb it was driven by train to the starting point Villingen, where also a minster of Our Lady is standing and so the pilgrimage route from Münster has joined."</seg>
<seg id="9">"each day tours were surrounded by a short impulse with various prayers, songs and texts in the morning and in the evening."</seg>
<seg id="10">"but also on the way, the mines of Feldcrossroads, chapels or churches repeatedly made rest to sing together a song of specially composed pilgrim song."</seg>
<seg id="11">The parish halls of the local parish priests were at their disposal for the nights.</seg>
<seg id="12">"at the stage destinations, Alexandra Burkhardt and Heidi Faller ensured a tasty and delicious dinner and breakfast."</seg>
<seg id="13">On the second day we went over Furtwangen to Gütenbach.</seg>
<seg id="14">"the day after St. Peter, which was the most strenuous route, had to descend at first about 500 metres in height and then climbed again."</seg>
<seg id="15">The deserved reward was in the evening a common barbecue on the lake.</seg>
<seg id="16">"after the morning impulse on the fourth day of pilgrimage in the impressive monastery church of St. Peter, we went to Freiburg."</seg>

<seg id="2">Scotland's Callum Skinner last evening in the men's team Sprint in Velodrom in Rio for fame as the British team defended the title of London 2012.</seg>
<seg id="3">"the 23-year-old from Glasgow took the anchor role, which his compatriot Sir Chris Hoy had made himself to Eigen."</seg>
<seg id="4">England claimed a shocking victory four years ago while Hoy won the fifth of six Olympic gold medals.</seg>
<seg id="5">They repeated the trick after they took place in March at the World Championships in London despite the withdrawal Hoys only a modest sixth place.</seg>
<seg id="6">The problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the driver Jamie Staff.</seg>
<seg id="7">They did this in time as execution.</seg>
<seg id="8">Hoys retirement has created a gap that Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton tried to close.</seg>
<seg id="9">"Skinner was the man in whom they stayed, when they saw potential in the villi that has now unfolded."</seg>
<seg id="10">"Hindes, Kenny - who prevailed four years ago with Hoy - and Skinner won a Olympiad in the qualification rounds, but in the standarists the New Zealanders won in the first round."</seg>
<seg id="11">And the British trio won the Duel with gold.</seg>
<seg id="12">"after his lap he came back shortly, but Kenny brought the team forward and Skinner thought it."</seg>
<seg id="13">"a change of strategy made a large part of the transformation, when executing it in a higher gear to slow down it and make it Kenny and especially Skinner to keep pace."</seg>
<seg id="14">"Hoy looked out from his position as BBC expert, and he liked Skinner, Kenny and Hindes, when they got on the podium."</seg>
<seg id="15">The 23-year-old Skinner from Glasgow said: "it is a flattering comparison."</seg>
<seg id="16">I am just here to do my best and make a name for me.</seg>
<seg id="17">In the final round we set up a Olympiarecord and defeated the world champion.</seg>
<seg id="18">It was just unbelievable.</seg>
<seg id="19">There is no better way to win this.</seg>
<seg id="20">After the triumph in 2012 on the Kennys and Hoys there was Hindes that he fell to the train after a weak start.</seg>
<seg id="21">He withdrew this statement later and there was no objection of England rivals.</seg>
<seg id="22">"with such a phenomenal victory, this time there was no such problem."</seg>
<seg id="23">"he said:" "it feels like the whole GB flags on the tribune like London."</seg>
<seg id="24">We have come together as a team over the past three months.</seg>
<seg id="25">We did so badly with so many world titles that it was incredible to win back at the Olympics.</seg>
<seg id="26">"this is an event, a gold medal for the nation, the seven out of 10 titles, both in Beijing and in London."</seg>
<seg id="27">"if that's a barometer of our progress in the last five months, we expect successful five days in the Velodrom."</seg>
<seg id="28">"with the shape Kenny, it is in the realm of the possibility that he repeated Hoys victory of three Olympic gold medals in a competition."</seg>
<seg id="29">"that would be for Kenny - who was exactly 12 years younger than Hoy, who was also born on March 23 (a seemingly holy date for British sports; on the day Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister were born) - a yield of six gold medals and a silver medal."</seg>
<seg id="30">The cheetah of Hoy was the same.</seg>
<seg id="31">Kenny takes part in the sprint that starts today and will go over three days.</seg>
<seg id="32">The 28-year-old from Bolton said: "I enjoy this just for the moment."</seg>
<seg id="33">The team event is always best.</seg>
<seg id="34">You can win it with his colleagues.</seg>
<seg id="35">It feels lonely to win alone.</seg>
<seg id="36">"he said," If he wins two more gold medals, he should be beaten to the knight. "</seg>
<seg id="37">"it was the only medal competition of the day, but there were other good news for England."</seg>
<seg id="38">"Sir Bradly Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doull qualified with the fastest performance in four-four kilometer races."</seg>
<seg id="39">They arrived in 3: 51.942 at the finish.</seg>
<seg id="40">"the world record, who won gold in 2012 in London, was at 3: 51,659."</seg>
<seg id="41">"the first and final round (22.42) will be held on the second day of the competition, where Wiggins will focus on security."</seg>
<seg id="42">"he had argued yesterday with commissioners before the qualification, when officials called him to measure his height."</seg>
<seg id="43">"in the corresponding women's competition, which will be continued and ended tomorrow, Laura Trott, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald of Milngavie in world record time in 4: 13,260."</seg>
<seg id="44">The UK team relies on his strong rail team to dominate the middle period of the Olympic Games and get a band of medals.</seg>
<seg id="45">"after a truly extraordinary display of absolute dominance in Beijing and London, the expectations for Rio were shut down."</seg>
<seg id="46">"drama was played in the background, so the resignation of the technical director Shane Sutton in April in the middle of sexismus- and mutobbingreproaches as well as retirement of sizes such as Hoy and Victoria Pendleton."</seg>
<seg id="47">"however, if one sees the first evening of the competition in the Velodrom, it looks like the now legendary reputation GBs, which reached its peak at the perfect moment, will be repeated again."</seg>

<seg id="1">Future of the dairy from Portland due to the abolition of the energy demand questionable</seg>
<seg id="2">"the future of aluminium melts from Portland in Victoria - as well as hundreds of workplaces of workers - stand at stake, as the system operator will terminate the energy supply contract and thereby lift all delivery contracts, such as the supplying energy companies."</seg>
<seg id="3">"this step was followed by the government's decision in Victoria at the beginning of this year, no further subsidies for the operation of the plant."</seg>
<seg id="4">A subsidy established for 20 years runs in November.</seg>
<seg id="5">Up to 2000 jobs in the plant of Alcoa in Portland are at stake.</seg>
<seg id="6">No less than 2000 jobs -direct as well as indirect - could be threatened with closure.</seg>
<seg id="7">"in addition, it could come to domino effects, as the melting shop consumes around 10 percent of the total power generation of Victorias."</seg>
<seg id="8">"in 2014, Alcoa closed the Point Henry Schmelzerei, which led to a closure of the Anglesea power station last year."</seg>
<seg id="9">The melt of Alcoa in Portland loses money and risks a closure.</seg>
<seg id="10">"this step follows the years of speculation with regard to the future of the plant, originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar and last due to the electricity price for the plant."</seg>
<seg id="11">"AGL, which supplies the large aluminium melding with its Loy Yang A power plant in Latrobe Valley, shared that three more owners will announce their contracts."</seg>
<seg id="12">"the facility is owned by a joint venture of Alcoa and Alumina, of which the Chinese company CITIC and Japanese Marubeni Corp hold smaller portions."</seg>
<seg id="13">"AGL assumes that the plant continues to operate in Portland, which means another physical demand for electricity through the melting process," said the company. "</seg>
<seg id="14">"AGL continued to say that the contracts were so-called" "securing business", "which should have entered into force since November 2016."</seg>
<seg id="15">"the contracts have a 12-month period of notice, so that they will end in 2017."</seg>
<seg id="16">"hence AGL assumes that the contracts in the financial year 17 will contribute to revenue," said the supplier. "</seg>
<seg id="17">"Euromonitor International has over 40 years' experience of publishing market research reports, business reference books and online information systems."</seg>
<seg id="18">AGL reported that the value of the contracts is already written in its annual financial statements amounting to $187 million in anticipation of a termination.</seg>
<seg id="19">"Alcoa said that the decision to withdraw the contracts, the" ability of Alcoa... to operate the melt or to ensure the power supply to the melt "is not impaired."</seg>
<seg id="20">"the US company said it had concluded a 20-year contract with Loy Yang, who should have entered into force from November this year, even if there is still an explanation, why it has resigned from the contract."</seg>
<seg id="21">"due to the poor economic conditions of the industry, analysts warn of the potential closure of the Portland Schmelzerei in Victoria and the Tomago plant near Newcastle."</seg>
<seg id="22">"in reference to the analysis of the analysts at the beginning of the week, the Head of Operations Stephen Mikkelsen said that Portland consume around 600 megawatts and Tomago around 900 megawatts per year."</seg>
<seg id="23">"should both systems disappear from the market, this would mean a significant reduction in demand on the [electricity market]."</seg>
<seg id="24">"and for us as a generator, that would not be good," he said. "</seg>

<seg id="2">"kendall Jenner, 20, Model and fourth daughter of the Managerin and mother of the Cardashian-Jenner Clan Kris is on the cover of the coveted September edition of the US Vogue."</seg>
<seg id="3">"kendall, the brand ambassador of Estee Lauder and went on the Fashion Weeks in Milan, Paris and New York, announced on Thursday the news on their Instagram account."</seg>
<seg id="4">"in a room full of people that I love, the sight of this cover brought me to cry," Kendall wrote. "</seg>
<seg id="5">"the unveiling of the cover was followed by a bizarre (or simply Keeping Up with the Cardashians like?), scripted reality video, which shows the entire Cardashian Jenner family (with the exception of the problem cases Rob and Caitlyn), as they forget the cover of their sister and that ends with a classic turn: they have all planned a surprise party."</seg>
<seg id="6">"this represents the cliché action almost every birthday party of a children's show (Seacrest brought the sentence," "You thought that we had forgotten you?" "with the honesty of a cartoon at 8 o'clock in the morning), but Kris had to let her other girl take part in this publicity."</seg>
<seg id="7">"with regard to the September issue of the Vogue, a new era of Cardashians began with certainty."</seg>
<seg id="8">"Kendalls big sister Kim likes her to have struck the Vogue cover (she and her husband Kanye West were on it in April 2014), but the cover of the September issue of the magazine is a league for itself."</seg>
<seg id="9">The September edition is the most sales edition of the year for Vogue.</seg>
<seg id="10">"with a circumference that resembles a picture tape rather than a fashion magazine, the output pulls a large number of advertisers (Laut Fashionista were from the 832 pages of the Wälzer 615 pages advertising)."</seg>
<seg id="11">The unveiling of his coverstar will be awaited so long that in the last two years pictures of the magazine still leakage before the official announcement.</seg>
<seg id="12">"women who were already on the cover include Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelista and Kate Moss."</seg>
<seg id="13">"in recent years there were clearly more" celebrities that are modeled "as" models, the celebrities are "on the cover."</seg>
<seg id="14">"Oscar prize-winner and Dior brand ambassador Jennifer Lawrence was in 2013 on the cover, a year after Lady Gaga had the honour."</seg>
<seg id="15">"but even at the low chance that Mrs. Jenner, which is described by the magazine as the" breakthrough model "of its generation - is under the former category, it is in good company."</seg>
<seg id="16">These celebrities are not related to famous persons or reality stars or youngsters of today who know how to rotate a good snapchat video (even if it all applies to separators).</seg>
<seg id="17">They are really talented women who draw themselves in the entertainment industry.</seg>
<seg id="18">"Beyonce, which appeared on the last cover, had with the release of Lemonade one of the most successful years of her career."</seg>
<seg id="19">"of course, Jenner's success doesn't like any success."</seg>
<seg id="20">"with her reality TV story, Jenner's position in the fashion world was always somewhat tense."</seg>
<seg id="21">In June the former Victoria's Secret-Modell Stephanie Seymour Jenner and her colleague Gigi Hadid criticized her "the Mistresses of the Moment."</seg>
<seg id="22">These feelings bounded high again when the news came out with the appearance Jenners on the Vogue Cover.</seg>
<seg id="23">"but on the contrary, it seems to pass by the point."</seg>

<seg id="2">E-mail and internet in slow motion: 20 years ago the Nokia Communicator came to the market.</seg>
<seg id="3">The successors today dominate the world - his maker experienced a disaster.</seg>
<seg id="4">The device weighed almost half a kilogram and was more than four times as hard as an iPhone 5.</seg>
<seg id="5">"it was thicker and bigger, so it was not good in the hand."</seg>
<seg id="6">"on the contrary, it was pretty musty."</seg>
<seg id="7">"the built-in memory was initially eight megabytes, which would suffice for about two selfies with high resolution."</seg>
<seg id="8">An iPhone is now supplied with at least 16 gigabytes.</seg>
<seg id="9">"the" Nokia 9000 Communicator "occurred exactly 20 years ago, on 15 August 1996, into the shops - and it was the first smartphone."</seg>
<seg id="10">"for a few euros, fans can buy the devices still on the Internet, but they somehow come from the oneage of the Internet era."</seg>
<seg id="11">"20 years ago, the Communicator was a sensation."</seg>
<seg id="12">The Finnish mobile phone manufacturer had announced the product a few months earlier at the Cebit computer fair in Hanover as an "office in the West Bank format."</seg>
<seg id="13">"in fact, the new mobile phone could be sent and received for damaging standards: SMS and e-mails could be sent and received, even via fax was the Communicator."</seg>
<seg id="14">"even the access to web pages was possible via HTML browser, albeit slowly."</seg>
<seg id="15">"a pocket calculator was available, a digital address book and an electronic calendar."</seg>
<seg id="16">"there was a small antenna, and the mobile phone could be unfolded like a laptop."</seg>
<seg id="17">Then a small keyboard and a black and white screen found.</seg>
<seg id="18">"the price: 2700 D-Mark, which is about 1400 euros."</seg>
<seg id="19">The average sales price of a smartphone in Germany was 392 euros in 2015.</seg>
<seg id="20">No one could guess in August 1996 that the communicator would become the beginning of the smartphone era.</seg>
<seg id="21">"since then, everything is different."</seg>
<seg id="22">Smart phones are a success story if not for Nokia.</seg>
<seg id="23">"the mobile savings of the Finns experienced an unprecedented disaster, was eventually sold and handled by Microsoft."</seg>
<seg id="24">Today the market dominates vendors who came all much later than Nokia.</seg>
<seg id="25">"always and everywhere online, this is today for very many people everyday life."</seg>

<seg id="3">"for me, this was the biggest attraction of Heathrows, just like in 2012 in London when we ran a great effort to make sure that all our nations and regions benefited from the games."</seg>
<seg id="4">The Olympiad brought great benefits for Stratford and the East End.</seg>
<seg id="5">And that will be achieved again by creating new opportunities for local residents and companies near Heathrow.</seg>
<seg id="6">"for our local communities alone, we will have 10,000 new apprenticeships to create 40,000 new jobs and put an end to youth unemployment in the airport environment."</seg>
<seg id="7">"as they predicted in London 2012, there will be those who will think that the challenge of enlarging heathrows is too big."</seg>
<seg id="8">I was told that England will never be ready for the games and that we will blamate ourselves on the world stage.</seg>
<seg id="9">The two-flers had wrongly in 2012 and they will be wrong even at Heathrow.</seg>
<seg id="10">"there are always obstacles for overcoming, but Heathrow answers every question asked."</seg>
<seg id="11">"like the Olympic Games, Heathrow is for many and not for individuals an infrastructure project."</seg>
<seg id="12">"expansion is a way to create up to 180,000 new jobs, £211 billion in sweating growth and to leave a legacy of skills and employment in both the airport and in the whole UK."</seg>
<seg id="13">"we have implemented a great team at Heathrow, which has implemented a £11 billion infrastructure investment programme in time and budget, from T5 - the five years in succession to the world's best airport terminal, up to T2, which was built in the middle of the two most frequented walkways in the world."</seg>
<seg id="14">"now they are ready to deliver a third catwalk, which is supported by £16 billion in private investment."</seg>
<seg id="15">The London games of 2012 were a great success for GB and I am confident that Heathrow's expansion will also be one.</seg>
<seg id="16">"it is time for us to steer this Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow, as well as secure our future trade and create a legacy of skills and employment that England can be proud of."</seg>

<seg id="6">"in a blog post, the spokesman of Adblock Ben Williams wrote that" this kind of Hin-and-Her-fight between the attracting open source community and the Umgehern is already underway since the invention of display lockers, "and that it is possible that Facebook is coming soon with a new solution."</seg>
<seg id="7">The fact that the world's largest social media company has left in the fight is a strong indication of how worrying displays have become for the industry.</seg>

<seg id="2">The victim was in the middle of the night on the highway.</seg>
<seg id="3">The police call witnesses after a woman was transferred to a highway in the early morning hours on Thursday with suspected suicide of several cars.</seg>
<seg id="4">The incident occurred on the A1 near Morges in the canton of Vaud shortly after midnight.</seg>
<seg id="5">"a woman lay down in the dark" "in an act of despair" "on the streets and were hit by several cars, the police said in Vaud."</seg>
<seg id="6">"it is obvious that a Swiss at the age of 49, who was transferred by several vehicles, including a truck, wanted to kill himself."</seg>
<seg id="7">She died on the spot.</seg>
<seg id="8">"several drivers have already been heard, but some are still not identified, the police said that, as well as every witness of the incident prompted to report."</seg>
<seg id="9">"it was opened an investigation process, which is a" logical "step in such a situation, Gilles Hofstetter shared the Le Tribune de Geneve."</seg>
<seg id="10">"however, it remains to be seen whether one of the drivers will be displayed."</seg>
<seg id="11">Was a clash avoidable?</seg>
<seg id="12">"this is something that the prosecutor has to decide," "said Hofstetter."</seg>
<seg id="13">Two similar cases in the last five years show that the drivers will not be held accountable.</seg>
<seg id="14">In each of the two cases - a person in the dark on the highway ran - it was decided that the drivers must not assume that a pedestrian runs in the middle of the night on the highway as it was in the newspaper.</seg>
<seg id="15">Last year a police officer was acquitted of the negligent killing after passing a man and killed a night on the A1 near Payerne in August 2014.</seg>
<seg id="16">"the 22-year-old sacrifice had drunk, and has become unconscious on the road, the court rejected."</seg>

<seg id="2">"according to the projections of a new NASA climate model, Venus was probably inhabitable."</seg>
<seg id="3">Scientists at Goddard Institute for Space Studies at NASA have developed a model to discover the past of Venus based on tools and algorithms which resemble those of climate scientists.</seg>
<seg id="4">"the model has been designed to determine if the Venus with its hot, waterless surface and CO2-dense atmosphere could have been exposed to once-similar conditions."</seg>
<seg id="5">Scientists have previously indicated that the slow rotation of Venus could be explained by its dense atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="6">"but the latest simulation suggests that Venus could have had a thin, erect-like atmosphere and nevertheless slowly turned on."</seg>
<seg id="7">The model also illuminates the topography of the early Venus.</seg>
<seg id="8">"the planet probably had more dry regions than the Earth, but had enough water and geographical variability to accommodate lives and protected against evaporation."</seg>
<seg id="9">The early Venus also benefited from a sun that was 30 percent matter.</seg>
<seg id="10">"in the ISS model simulation, the slow rotation of the Venus will expose its daytime of the Sun for almost two months," explained GISS scientists Anthony Del Genio in a press release. "</seg>
<seg id="11">"this warms the surface and produces rain, which creates a thick layer of clouds, which acts like a umbrella to shield the surface from most of the solar heat."</seg>
<seg id="12">The result is average temperatures that are some degrees cooler than that of the Earth today.</seg>
<seg id="13">The model produced a story of Venus that resembles evolution that was previously assumed by planets.</seg>
<seg id="14">"although it was presumably inhabited, Venus was exposed to much heat and ultraviolet light in the course of several billion years."</seg>
<seg id="15">Their oceans were evaporated and their water vapor was burned out of ultraviolet light.</seg>
<seg id="16">"as their hydrogene escaped only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide back with a mortal greenhouse effect -- the Venus, which we know today."</seg>
<seg id="17">The researchers divided the results of their new Venus climate model in the Geophysical Research Letters.</seg>

<seg id="2">The latest mission with the Kepler space telescope has helped astronomers to collect the most complete catalogue of rotation rates among the stars of the constellation of the Pleiades.</seg>
<seg id="3">The new data will help astronomers understand why stars in the star cluster rotate to different rates as well as in which context the rotational periods with the planetary creation stand.</seg>
<seg id="4">"we hope that by comparing our results with other starters, we learn more about the relationship between the mass of a star, age and even the history of his solar system," said Luisa Rebull, a researcher at the Caltech's Infrared Processing and Analysis Center in Pasadena, in a press release.

<seg id="6">"many stars in this cluster, which arose around 125 million years ago, reach adulthood now."</seg>
<seg id="7">They are now turning to the fastest.</seg>
<seg id="8">"to peak rotational rates, these gripping stars come from large amounts of starvation."</seg>
<seg id="9">"since these winds travel through the magnetic fields of the stars, they have a slowing effect on the stars."</seg>

<seg id="13">"Rebull compares the stars with dancers, with larger stars slow pirouettes as smaller ones."</seg>
<seg id="14">"in the" Ballet "of the Pleiades, we see that slow rotors tend to be massive, whereas faster rotors tend to be very bright stars," Rebull said. "</seg>

<seg id="1">Datenklau: this perfide pressing hacker her ransom</seg>
<seg id="2">Programmers from Erexpress-malware are currently targeting companies - and are successful.</seg>
<seg id="3">"according to a recent survey conducted by the malware defense specialist Malwardytes under 540 companies in North America, Great Britain and Germany, 40 percent of surveyed companies were at least once, partially multiple victims of an attack with erpresser software."</seg>
<seg id="4">"Euromonitor International has over 40 years' experience of publishing market research reports, business reference books and online information systems."</seg>
<seg id="5">40 percent of the victims paid willingly the solution required by the perpetrators to reuse the challenged systems and data.</seg>
<seg id="6">The perpetrators specialize their erpresser software according to the observations of Malwarebytes explicitly on attacks in corporate networks.</seg>
<seg id="7">"if they are successful, the potential to replace the ransom is considerably higher than with private users."</seg>
<seg id="8">"we are currently watching a terrifying rapid evolution of the malware," explains Malwarebral Head Marcin Kleczynski in conversation with the "world." "</seg>
<seg id="9">"in 2008, most of the painting programs were still designed to send advertisements."</seg>
<seg id="10">Then we discovered the Daily Express software for itself.</seg>
<seg id="11">"only private users were the target, but the change to company attacking was terrifying quickly over the past few months."</seg>
<seg id="12">"Ransomware works according to a simple pattern: once active on the computer of an victim, it searches for unknown files such as Word-, Excel- or database files, as well as archives of pictures and videos."</seg>
<seg id="13">These files encrypt the Ransomware and deletes the originals sustainably.</seg>
<seg id="14">The software then presents the demands of the blackmail.</seg>
<seg id="15">"in order to get the final key code to the files, the victims must transfer money - mostly in the form of Cryptocurrencies Bitcoin."</seg>
<seg id="16">"however, where private users use the personal photo database on the game, companies are concerned with sensitive customer data or project databases without stopping production."</seg>
<seg id="17">"accordingly, the damage occurs when a Ransomware fails."</seg>
<seg id="18">"22 percent of German companies reported revenue losses caused by Ransomware, 13 percent had even had to completely interrupt the business operation, in a case people were in danger of life."</seg>
<seg id="19">"in Germany, several hospitals have already been victims of attacks, whose patients can be acutely threatened by the loss of sick persons."</seg>
<seg id="20">"we always say to the victims: pay not, you only promote the problem," explains Kleczynski. "</seg>
<seg id="21">"however, 80 to 90 percent of companies pay, their data will be returned."</seg>
<seg id="22">"for managers, it is difficult to reject the demand of the perpetrators in the face of downtime."</seg>
<seg id="23">The hackers in turn know this and try everything to build a good reputation.</seg>
<seg id="24">"in a recent study, the security researchers of F-Secure analyzes the usefulness and contact with blackmailing and come to the result: the perpetrators are actually trying to build a kind of customer service to take more money."</seg>
<seg id="25">"they declare their victims per chat, as they can pay by Bitcoin, freely accessible support websites or decrypt free example files."</seg>
<seg id="26">"and will be redeemed by individuals after payment of a few hundred Euro, companies need to negotiate heavily and pay five-digit sums in order to get back their data unencrypted."</seg>
<seg id="27">"given the potentially high and relatively risky gains from the Ransomware blackmail, the hackers are becoming more professional and share the work, explains Security Expert Chester Wisniewski from anti-virus vendors Sophos:" a single person can write a ransomware approximately within a week. "</seg>
<seg id="28">"however, it is more likely that it is three or four persons."</seg>
<seg id="29">The programmers sell their malware then in the form of a software building kit to the actual blackmail.</seg>
<seg id="30">"the previous malware-kits have been created by the malware even, providing advice and additional tools for a unique, fixed price between 1000 and 10,000 dollars."</seg>
<seg id="31">"the scope of delivery includes a customization tool, so that smaller configurations, appearance and branding can be changed," says Wisniewski. "</seg>
<seg id="32">The blackmail then searches for further hackers to spread the newly purchased software among the victims.</seg>
<seg id="33">We live in a service sector.</seg>
<seg id="34">"so one logs in one of the forums in the underground, buys the set of a criminal and instructs another to install the software on as many PCs as possible."</seg>
<seg id="35">Payment is done per infected host.</seg>
<seg id="36">"usually the criminals carry out spamming with the spread," Wisniewski explains. "</seg>
<seg id="37">"in the meantime, the risk of Ransomware is known by many companies that better safeguard their data."</seg>
<seg id="38">Over 50 percent of companies in the Malwarebytes survey can trust Ransomware to be able to repel ransomware by means of file-back-ups and scanner software.</seg>
<seg id="39">"accordingly, the perpetrators are pursuing new strategies."</seg>
<seg id="40">"if the encryption of data is no longer a sufficient threat to successful capture, the perpetrators instead threaten the release of sensitive data such as customer lists or pricing," explains Malwarven boss Marcin Kleczynski. "</seg>
<seg id="41">"thus, damage potential is much higher than before, depending on the type of data."</seg>

<seg id="2">Honda HR-V is flexible and suitable for everyday use</seg>
<seg id="3">"in the small HR-V Honda, Honda wants to pack everything: a little SUV, a little coupe and also the versatility of a minivans."</seg>
<seg id="4">"it sounds rather overloaded, but HR-V, which was constructed on the same new platform as the new jazz, proves to be extremely flexible in everyday life."</seg>
<seg id="5">"although the only 1,60 m high HR-V looks rather small, the passengers have a lot of space both in the first row and in the rear."</seg>
<seg id="6">"the materials of the interior space are well finished and have a pleasant effect, only the cockpit top is down there."</seg>
<seg id="7">The HR-V is more versatile than comparable vehicles.</seg>
<seg id="8">"it is not only a trunk of 453 l with raised and 1026 l with inverted backrests, but there is the" "Magic Seats". ""</seg>
<seg id="9">"this is less magical than it sounds: the seat surfaces of the back bench can be folded up like kinoscopes and thus offer storage space, which is 1,24 m high from floor to ceilings."</seg>
<seg id="10">"the trunk is well loaded, however the loading height with 650 mm is slightly higher than the comparable Peugeot 2008."</seg>
<seg id="11">The tested 1.6-l diesel with 88 kW / 120 hp accelerates HR-V with torque of up to 300 Nm in wide speed ranges.</seg>
<seg id="12">"however, he is likely to do his job a little quieter."</seg>
<seg id="13">The daily consumption of 4.7 l / 100 km is pleasing.</seg>
<seg id="14">There is another motorization: a 1.5 l gasoline with 96 kW / 130 hp.</seg>
<seg id="15">A four-wheel drive is not offered.</seg>
<seg id="16">"driving behavior is balanced, a good compromise between dynamics and comfort."</seg>
<seg id="17">But steering should be a bit more direct.</seg>
<seg id="18">The equipment in the tested top version "Executive" leaves nothing to be desired.</seg>
<seg id="19">"the city emergency braking system belongs to the security systems (works up to 32), the collision warning system and the lane assistant."</seg>
<seg id="20">"the collision warner sometimes irritates, because he rated many obstacles as" "approaching objects" "when shalling."</seg>
<seg id="21">The remote-light assistant works very reliably.</seg>
<seg id="22">And the intelligent temporegler reacts to traffic sign recognition and induces speed if necessary.</seg>
<seg id="23">"however, the full connectivity is only available for the top equipment: 7-inch touchscreen, navigation device, app integration and more."</seg>
<seg id="24">Two USB and one HDMI socket are under the armrest and are therefore a bit awkward to achieve.</seg>
<seg id="25">The approximately 29000 Euro for the well-equipped top diesel are fine.</seg>
<seg id="26">"those who don't want to invest so much will receive the gasoline engine from 20,000 euros, diesel from 23000 euros."</seg>

<seg id="1">Relaxing Night: tips against Sleep Disorders</seg>
<seg id="2">"in the evening, one hurts around eternally, at night one is bound to awake for hours, in the morning it is far from the wake-up ring no longer thinking about sleep."</seg>
<seg id="3">This is anything but relaxing.</seg>
<seg id="4">"after all, with such problems in good society: according to the Robert Koch Institute, about a quarter of adult sleep disorders and more than ten percent feel their sleep frequently or permanently as not relaxing."</seg>
<seg id="5">How are sleeping problems or sleep disorders?</seg>
<seg id="6">"there are several forms of sleep disorders, and there can be many causes underlying them, emphasizes Hans-Günter Weeß, board member of the German Society for Schlafforgery and Sleep Medicine."</seg>
<seg id="7">"what you understand inland, however, is the Insomnia, so an onward and sleeping disorder."</seg>
<seg id="8">"just to sleep, many people feel unsatisfactory or inadequate, says Jens Wagenknecht, member of the German Medical Association association with practice in the Lower Saxony Varel."</seg>
<seg id="9">What is behind sleep disorders?</seg>
<seg id="10">The causes of sleep disorders are complex.</seg>
<seg id="11">"behind this there are organic, psychological or behavioural factors, but also medication."</seg>
<seg id="12">Infrequently the sleeping disorder is an expression of another disease.</seg>
<seg id="13">"very early awakening is common in the case of depression," "said Weeding."</seg>
<seg id="14">And it can be that different factors match each other.</seg>
<seg id="15">"for example, who has a hernia failure, can be bad, wakes up every two to three hours and possibly starts to salute over everyday problems and worry, there is an example."</seg>
<seg id="16">This leads to tension and sleep is no longer possible.</seg>
<seg id="17">When should you sleep with sleep disorders to the doctor?</seg>
<seg id="18">"if you do not sleep well over a period of one month at least three nights a week and is impaired on the day, should go to the doctor, advises Weeks."</seg>
<seg id="19">"impairment may be quite different: one is beaten, tired, unexhausted, has difficulties with attention and concentration, is easily irritable, has mood swings or physical ailments like stomach or headache."</seg>
<seg id="20">"to alleviate sleep disturbance, it is important to find their causes."</seg>
<seg id="21">"treatment options include behavioural changes, cognitive behavioural therapy or also medicines - classic sleeping pills only in exceptional cases and at most for two weeks - inquery."</seg>
<seg id="22">"there is hardly any inadequate sleep medicine in Germany, emphasizes Prof. Ingo Fietze, Head of the Interdisciplinary Medical Center of Charité Universitätsmedizin Berlin."</seg>
<seg id="23">"therefore, you should contact the dentist at first time problems with sleep problems."</seg>
<seg id="24">It can clarify with investigations whether the problems have a physical cause.</seg>
<seg id="25">Who should go to sleep lab and what happens?</seg>
<seg id="26">"for the examination in the sleep laboratory, physicians advise physicians for example in snoring with respiratory problems, in case of illness or if you do not find the cause of a sleeping disorder, explains Fietze."</seg>
<seg id="27">You don't have to prepare for the examination.</seg>
<seg id="28">One should spend the day normally.</seg>
<seg id="29">"only please do not make a nap-sleep," says Fietze. "</seg>
<seg id="30">"after clapping, one goes to bed at his normal time."</seg>
<seg id="31">"in addition to the electrodes on the body, one carries a nose-glasses, a chest strap and a sensor on the finger."</seg>
<seg id="32">"in addition, a camera on the ceiling shows sleeping."</seg>
<seg id="33">How can those affected get a grip on the problems?</seg>
<seg id="34">There are quite a lot of screws on which one can sit for a better sleep.</seg>
<seg id="35">"woundy count on: regular sleeping and stand-up times, not too long in bed, do not watch TV for sleeping, stop drinking, and at night don't look at the clock - then you start to reckon immediately, and that is completely and not conducive."</seg>

<seg id="4">"compared to a Lidl, which is to be demolished soon, it is already built: until 2017 there will be a house with high windows and 133 new apartments."</seg>
<seg id="5">"articles about this" trendy district, "as the responsible real estate company Friedrichshain calls, will be illustrated in the last weeks preferred by burning cars."</seg>
<seg id="6">"the reason is the house with the number 94: once it was occupied, meanwhile the inhabitants rented tenants, but on the ground floor there are still rooms occupied and are used for events."</seg>
<seg id="7">"since the beginning of the year, especially the Berlin internal senator Henkel noted several times for a tough action of the police against the project, the area as a" no-go zone "for policemen and 94 as the starting point of autonomous violence."</seg>
<seg id="8">"after June 22, the rooms on the ground floor, the Kadterschmiede, were cleared with 300 police officers, were patrolling out official statements with 30 to 40 officials and three crew wagons on-site, blocked parts of the road and stopped visitors from entering the house with the number 94."</seg>
<seg id="9">"in the meantime, the construction workers commissioned the premises for the unknown landlords."</seg>
<seg id="10">"on 13 July, a Berlin Administrative Court ruled that the clearance was illegal, and a day later police and construction workers moved away under the jubilee of sympathizers and residents."</seg>
<seg id="11">"on this summer afternoon the street works peacefully: parents walk with children, people sit on the pavement in front of the houses in the sun, others entertain vorm Späti."</seg>
<seg id="12">"in the immediate vicinity of the building projects, there is a primary school and kindergartens."</seg>
<seg id="13">"left-wing violence is not the main concern of many residents: Kerstin Neugebauer, who lives in the neighbourhood since 1999, and Jana *, who is doing three children here, are mainly generated by the police presence."</seg>
<seg id="14">"with the inhabitants of the house projects, they share the care of rising mids and ventrification."</seg>
<seg id="15">"it doesn't sound like a Kiez, who wanted a majority of police protections against the vandalous left."</seg>
<seg id="16">"the ditch, which of the Berlin internal senator and the police between house-occupiers and their neighbors, does not exist."</seg>
<seg id="17">"Friedrichshain in the east of Berlin was actually a traditional working-class district, which also today compared to the rest of the city has a lower average income and high poverty rate."</seg>
<seg id="18">"in 1990, many houses were occupied in the former GDR, including nearly the entire Mainzer street close to Riga."</seg>
<seg id="19">"while the Mainzer was evacuated under a large police force in a regular street battle, many of the projects were legalised in Riga and are still inhabited by the people they occupied 26 years ago."</seg>
<seg id="20">"at the same time, the city district has increasingly become magnets for tourists and electors from all over the world."</seg>
<seg id="21">This is also noticeable in the rental companies that have increased by almost 60 percent since 2009.</seg>
<seg id="22">Many of the new buildings in the Rīga are attacked as symbols for this development: one recognizes them at piled discs or freshly painted facades which were ejected with paint bags.</seg>
<seg id="23">No other street was mentioned so often along with the words "left-autonomous violence."</seg>
<seg id="24">"one reason is that not all neighbours regard this as a problem, could be that they are not necessarily affected by crime: crimes like bodily injury are according to statistics almost exclusively against policemen."</seg>
<seg id="25">"the biggest part of the offences make material damage, which tends to meet the new buildings and newly renovated houses."</seg>
<seg id="26">"for Kerstin Neugebauer, who has lived in a tenant building next to the controversial 94 for 17 years, there can be no talk of uncertainty."</seg>
<seg id="27">"as for acts of violence, it is critical: the people in the 94 are their neighbors, which were certainly not destined."</seg>
<seg id="28">Even the famous burning cars do not give it any longer in the Rīga.</seg>
<seg id="29">"for the architect architect, her street is not a criminal focal point, on the contrary:" here one helps one another, lives together on the road and gets more from each other than elsewhere. "</seg>
<seg id="30">Neugebauer is consciously drawn into the Riga road - and remained.</seg>
<seg id="31">"that is why it was also so important that the residents get their road back: from the police, politics and the media, which in July all suddenly claimed the interpretation of the city."</seg>
<seg id="32">"however, in the eyes of residents such as Neugebauer the street will continue to be taken away: by sighted new buildings in former buildings, which displace the old inhabitants."</seg>
<seg id="33">"these are condominiums which are not interesting for many here - here are rather people who are not so well drunk," she says. "</seg>
<seg id="34">"I absolutely cannot approve violence and destruction." ""</seg>
<seg id="35">But what should be done if someone never listens to someone?</seg>
<seg id="36">"there is frustration on all sides, even with the police and the inhabitants."</seg>
<seg id="37">Kerstin Neugebauer has little understanding for trainees who have little understanding of colour bombers: the house projects and the left scene belonged to the Kiez.</seg>

<seg id="23">The search has been very difficult for some time.</seg>
<seg id="24">De facto the administration does not find private apartments.</seg>
<seg id="25">"so far, it does not work so far, one is dependent on private dwellings, so Deuschle."</seg>
<seg id="26">"therefore, common apartments need to be found, as it is so beautiful."</seg>
<seg id="27">"so soon, new containers will be installed in the washing-road."</seg>
<seg id="28">But only with apartments it is not done.</seg>
<seg id="29">"perspective is the keyword, Regine Customer and Annika Deuschle agree."</seg>
<seg id="30">"in addition to a fixed place, there are internships, apprenticeships, school grounds, one-euro jobs and jobs for refugees and migrants who need to be discovered or established."</seg>
<seg id="31">"more places would be good," Regine customer reports. "</seg>
<seg id="32">"many work in the building yard or help housework, do charitable work - and that motivates and very tidy, as Annika Deuschle reports."</seg>
<seg id="33">It hopes that the work for the community leads to a positive external effect.</seg>
<seg id="34">This is "no employment therapy."</seg>
<seg id="35">But activity does not only mean work.</seg>
<seg id="36">"the day needs a firm structure, say Deuschle and customer."</seg>
<seg id="37">People would have to develop a feeling of belonging.</seg>
<seg id="38">"so there are offers such as sports, contacts with locals and especially language courses."</seg>
<seg id="39">Professional courses are rare.</seg>
<seg id="40">So also here administration and volunteers are jumping.</seg>
<seg id="41">It is central that the refugees get the feeling they are welcome in Germany and welcome.</seg>
<seg id="42">The long duration of the procedure is a problem.</seg>
<seg id="43">"you have to explain to the refugees that it will take and they can bridge the time meaningfully, for example with language courses."</seg>
<seg id="44">"those who sometime develop the feeling, he couldn't help anyone in Urbach, should not work and be useless, he will never be integrated."</seg>
<seg id="45">The clear majority is motivated.</seg>
<seg id="46">"the work of Deuschle and customer is therefore always to motivate others."</seg>
<seg id="47">All this is already a "mammoth task."</seg>
<seg id="48">"a difficult question: are the two after recent incidents afraid of radicalization, even in a small community like Urbach?"</seg>
<seg id="49">"no," Regine Customer says clearly, "what some people may call naive." a residual risk can and does not want to exclude it. "</seg>
<seg id="50">But the helpers are already sensitive.</seg>
<seg id="51">These incidents are also subject to refugees.</seg>
<seg id="52">They would have the fear that the assassins were completely revocable.</seg>
<seg id="53">"they want to show that they have nothing to do with it," "says Regine Customer."</seg>
<seg id="54">Many would like to stay in Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="55">"therefore, the main and volunteers must look out on the spot and in the region after activities."</seg>
<seg id="56">They always in the background that soon a new push for refugees and migrants could come to Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="57">Does Germany need a cap?</seg>
<seg id="58">"to answer this question clearly, politics is afraid."</seg>
<seg id="59">"actually, it is unfair to place them on the spot."</seg>
<seg id="60">"in Urbach we are not yet arrived, where we would like," "says Annika Deuschle."</seg>
<seg id="61">"no new refugees, that would be able to relax."</seg>
<seg id="62">Regine customer also makes it clear that the Urbacher is already busy to integrate the existing people wisely.</seg>
<seg id="63">"these are currently around 100 people, mainly young men."</seg>
<seg id="64">"but when people are in need, they must help them, both women agree."</seg>
<seg id="65">"the political world situation is so complicated, there are no simple answers."</seg>
