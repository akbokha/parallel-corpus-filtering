Obama receives Net@@ any@@ ahu
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu is not very friendly .
the two wanted to speak about the implementation of the international agreement as well as about Te@@ hr@@ an &apos;s dest@@ ab@@ ili@@ zing measures in the Middle East .
but the meeting should also deal with the conflict with the Palestinians and the two @-@ state solution .
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu has been ten@@ se for years .
Washington critic@@ ises Israel &apos;s ongoing settlement expansion and raises Net@@ any@@ ahu &apos;s lack of will in the peace process .
&quot; through the deal promoted by Obama , the Iranian nuclear programme has deteri@@ or@@ ated the relationship between the two . &quot;
&quot; in March , Net@@ any@@ ahu said at the invitation of the Republi@@ cans before the U.S. Congress a controversial speech , which was partly judged as an aff@@ ront against Obama . &quot;
&quot; the speech was not discussed with Obama , a meeting had rejected this election in Israel with reference to the upcoming election in Israel . &quot;
&quot; in a emergency call , Professor , his girl@@ friend was shot to have shot &quot;
&quot; in a emergency call , Professor Sh@@ ann@@ on Lamb talked with a little angry voice of the police that he shot his girl@@ friend and that the officials would have to come to his home . &quot;
Lamb was it important to emphasize that his &quot; sweet dog &quot; was still alive and probably excited and he said the family contacts of dead woman could be found on the mobile phone .
&quot; inside the house , the officers found the cor@@ p@@ ses of A@@ my Pr@@ enti@@ ss and a hand@@ written note that was scrat@@ ched on a white block : &quot; I &apos;m sorry , I loved A@@ my and she is the only woman who ever loved me . &quot; &quot;
&quot; there was no indication that Lamb , who was in two online courses for the Delta State University in Cle@@ vel@@ and , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , had already travelled 300 miles to the school grounds , where he shot and killed a popular professor , E@@ than Schmidt , at the door to his office . &quot;
Delta State University Polic@@ eman Lyn@@ n Bu@@ ford said that university staff listened to shooting at 10 : 18 o &apos;clock .
he said that Lamb did the fatal emergency some@@ time after that .
until the end of the day there was another death : Lamb took the life when the police enc@@ ir@@ cl@@ ed him .
&quot; a day after shooting at the university , which forced students and lec@@ turers to hide behind closed doors , the authorities still try to get an idea of what Lamb motiv@@ ates . &quot;
&quot; the details published by investig@@ ators at both ends of the state , as well as what students and staff who knew him , helped to draw a picture of a talented but possibly difficult teacher . &quot;
students said they were looking forward to his classes .
&quot; the police in Gau@@ tier , where Pr@@ enti@@ ss died , said he did not have any history of violence or criminal pre@@ history . &quot;
Lamb himself had mentioned Lamb in a book written by him in which he mentioned the &quot; wonderful people &quot; with whom he shared his academic life .
&quot; both taught in the Department of Social Sciences and History , whose faculty consists of 17 members , and many students visited courses of both . &quot;
at the same time there were some inc@@ lin@@ ations on problem@@ atic behavi@@ ors .
&quot; a student , Brand@@ on Be@@ avers , the Lamb praised , said he also seemed a little nervous and nervous as if something was wrong with him . &quot;
&quot; another student , Mik@@ el Sy@@ kes , said that he told him that he had to do with stress at the end of the academic year 2014 @-@ 15 . &quot;
Lamb had previously asked the Delta State University for health reasons and said that he had any health problem .
this year he only taught two online courses .
&quot; the latest changes in employment policy of the university meant that the promotion , for the Lamb had worked so hard for him , would not constitute a guarantee for an automatic path to an appointment as assistant professor . &quot;
&quot; University President William LA@@ FOR@@ GE said he didn &apos;t know anything about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs &apos;s idea . &quot;
these are questions that the Lamb can no longer answer .
&quot; after escape from the campus , the police finally found Lam@@ bs , when he drove back into Miss@@ issi@@ ppi from Ar@@ kan@@ s@@ as . &quot;
&quot; before he could be arrested , Lamb closed himself with a .@@ 38 cali@@ ber gun in the back@@ yard of a house about a mile south of his parents house on the outskirts of Green@@ ville , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , said Washington County Cor@@ oner Meth@@ el Johnson . &quot;
his car was still in the dri@@ v@@ eway .
&quot; it was not immediately clear why he went to this house , but Johnson said that she believed that he knew the people who lived there . &quot;
Lamb grew up in the area .
&quot; Lamb began his work at the university in 2009 , the 3,@@ 500 students in a town with about 12@@ ,000 inhabitants and taught ge@@ ography and ped@@ agog@@ y . &quot;
he received his doc@@ torate in the spring of ped@@ agog@@ y .
&quot; one of the long@@ time friends lam@@ bs described him as intelligent , charis@@ matic and funny . &quot;
&quot; Car@@ la H@@ air@@ ston said she was 15 and he was 20 , when she met together with friends . &quot;
&quot; she and her friends were in High School , and he was the cool elderly guy who tried several years to teach her the guitar playing . &quot;
he was the women &apos;s black back then .
&quot; all girls melt away when he was there , &quot; &quot; said H@@ air@@ ston , now 40 and resident in Jackson subur@@ b of Brand@@ on . &quot;
Lamb and Pr@@ enti@@ ss were obviously some time together .
&quot; Lamb &quot; &quot; I have killed my wife , &quot; &quot; but there was no diploma from a marriage . &quot;
&quot; they had a dog named Light@@ ning , who lived with them in the brick house , adjacent to a Ba@@ you in Gau@@ tier . &quot;
the police said that the dog was fine .
&quot; the ex @-@ husband of Pr@@ enti@@ ss , Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , said they were divor@@ ced 15 years ago , but friends stayed and had a daughter who now was 19 years old . &quot;
&quot; she was totally destroyed at the ground , &quot; said O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en about his daughter . &quot;
she and her mother were absolutely best friends .
&quot; O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said he never met Lamb , but by his daughter Ab@@ ig@@ ail he heard that Lamb was interested in music and played blues . &quot;
Lamb met Pr@@ enti@@ ss when he and Ab@@ ig@@ ail started three years ago on a summer fair .
later they played together the one or the other gig .
O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said his daughter writes and sings their own music .
Pr@@ enti@@ ss was a nur@@ se who worked for different companies online .
&quot; Mike Sha@@ ffer , a bar@@ keeper and sometimes entertainment coordin@@ ator at The Ju@@ le@@ p Room , a weak lit bar near Gau@@ tier , said that he finished Lamb and Pr@@ enti@@ ss Night at night September 5th , after Lamb finished his guitar and harmon@@ ica game finished in front of a spar@@ se audience . &quot;
there was no indication that anything was not right .
&quot; just a happy couple , &quot; he said . &quot;
we were at the fr@@ aming and jo@@ king each other .
I mean they both had a good sense of j@@ okes .
&quot; Schmidt , the dead professor , conducted the first semester seminars and specialised in American native and colonial history , said Don Allan Mit@@ ch@@ ell , an English professor at the school . &quot;
he was married and had three little children .
he studied at the Empor@@ ia State University in K@@ ans@@ as and was president of his br@@ otherhood and the student committee .
&quot; on Tuesday evening about 900 people attended the Delta State Campus in Cle@@ vel@@ and , including lec@@ turers , employees , students and members of the community at a cand@@ l@@ el@@ ight memorial . &quot;
&quot; Sch@@ mid@@ ts Frau Li@@ z and his brother Jeff Schmidt also participated in the M@@ ahn@@ wa@@ che , while the Univers@@ itat &quot; B@@ right Mor@@ ning Star &quot; and &quot; Ama@@ zing Grace &quot; sang . &quot;
the lessons will be res@@ um@@ ed on Wednesday .
&quot; we try to move our students to return , &quot; &quot; said LA@@ FOR@@ GE . &quot;
the crisis is over .
this is a day of healing .
&quot; A@@ my and Rog@@ el@@ io Soli@@ s reported Cle@@ vel@@ and , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi . &quot;
&quot; associated Press Auth@@ ors E@@ mil@@ y Wag@@ ster P@@ ett@@ us in Green@@ ville , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , and Rebecca Sant@@ ana in New Orleans contributed to this report . &quot;
&quot; this story has been corrected to reflect that the police now says that Lamb had made the call after he shot himself , and that he called Pr@@ enti@@ ss as his wife in his emergency call Pr@@ enti@@ ss , but there is no indication that the two have ever married . &quot;
Toys R Us plans to hire fewer workers for the holiday season

Michael J. Fox h@@ ears about his &quot; Date &quot; with Princess Diana
&quot; back to the Future &quot; premiere was a great moment for Michael J. Fox .
it was remarkable also for personal reasons .
&quot; we sat in the theatre for the ro@@ y@@ als , and I notice that the seat beside me is empty , and it becomes clear to me that Princess Diana is sitting next to me , &quot; he said in a trailer for an upcoming documentary &quot; Back in Time . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the film begins , and it comes to mind that I &apos;m a simul@@ ated G@@ äh@@ nen and an arm length away from being with the Princess of Wales at a date . &quot;
&quot; back in Time , &quot; a documentary about Back to the Future , presents interviews with Fox , Lea Thom@@ p@@ son and Christopher Lloyd , as well as with director Robert Z@@ em@@ eck@@ is and producer Steven Spiel@@ berg . &quot;
&quot; back for the Future &quot; had premier@@ ed 30 years ago .
&quot; it really is for me , &quot; said Spiel@@ berg , &quot; Un@@ str@@ it@@ tig the biggest time @-@ journey film ever shot . &quot;
&quot; back in Time &quot; will be on VO@@ D , DVD and in selected cinem@@ as in October . &quot;
UN leader says there is no military solution in Syria
&quot; Secretary General B@@ an K@@ i @-@ moon says his answer to Russia &apos;s reinforced military support for Syria is : &quot; there is no military solution &quot; of the almost five @-@ year conflict , and more weapons will wor@@ sen violence and mis@@ ery for millions of people . &quot;
&quot; the UN leader again calls on all parties , including the shared UN Security Council , to unite and support inclusive negotiations for finding a political solution . &quot;
&quot; B@@ an told a press conference on Wednesday that he plans to meet the Foreign Ministers of the five Perman@@ ent Member States of the Council - USA , Russia , China , Great Britain and France - on the ver@@ ge of the minist@@ erial meeting of the General Assembly to discuss the situation in Syria . &quot;
he regre@@ t@@ ted that the spl@@ its in the Council and within the Syrian people and the regional powers &quot; make this situation in@@ soluble . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; B@@ an urged the five permanent members to show the same solidarity and unity in addressing the crisis in Syria , which they demonstrated in achieving nuclear deal with Iran . &quot;
8 survey values that show that Donald Tru@@ mp is serious .
some have tried to brand him as a flop .
others have dismis@@ sed him as a joke .
and some are waiting for a collapse .
&quot; but no matter how some Republi@@ cans try to pull Donald Tru@@ mp from the upper ranks during surveys , it has not worked . &quot;
&quot; ten of the last eleven national surveys showed Donald Tru@@ mp in the double @-@ digit range , and some begin to seriously ask what it means for the chances of nom@@ ination of real estate Mog@@ ul@@ s . &quot;
&quot; of course , it is still too early in the election period . &quot;
nobody claims that Tru@@ mp will probably win Republi@@ can nom@@ ination .
&quot; experts emphasize that during 2011 Rick Per@@ r@@ ys led the lead to the rising Her@@ man C@@ ain , none of which won only one state in the nom@@ ination process . &quot;
and there are many reasons why he would fight in a general election .
but external groups such as J@@ eb Bus@@ hes Super P@@ AC and the conservative economic group Club for Growth can now recognise Tru@@ mps flow @-@ fortune and begin to let their dollars flow to overthrow him .
here are some current survey values that indicate that the real estate market is not just a temporary phase :
the popularity values turned 180 degrees .
&quot; just before Donald Tru@@ mp announced his can@@ did@@ acy in mid @-@ June , a survey conducted by Mon@@ mouth University showed that only two of ten Republi@@ cans viewed the real estate fashion . &quot;
by mid @-@ July it was 40 percent .
at the beginning of August there were 52 percent .
now six out of 10 re@@ public@@ ans have a positive opinion of Donald Tru@@ mp .
about three out of ten say they have a negative opinion .
and these figures are in early states .
a qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac vote in I@@ owa reported last week that 60 percent of the Republi@@ cans have a good view of Tru@@ mp .
two thirds of GO@@ P vot@@ ers would be happy with Tru@@ mp as candidates .
&quot; in a survey of CN@@ N / OR@@ C last week 67 percent of the Republi@@ cans said they would either be &quot; &quot; enthusiastic &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; satisfied &quot; &quot; if Tru@@ mp would be nominated . &quot;
&quot; only two of ten would say they were &quot; &quot; angry &quot; &quot; if he were the candidate . &quot;
&quot; only Ben Car@@ son manages about the same enthusiasm as Tru@@ mp ( 43 percent say they were &quot; enthusiastic &quot; vs. 40 percent , who say the same about Tru@@ mp ) . &quot;
the next in terms of enthusiasm ?
Marco Ru@@ bio with only 21 percent .
&quot; on the other hand 47 percent of Republi@@ can vot@@ ers say they were &quot; dis@@ satisfied &quot; or &quot; angry &quot; if J@@ eb Bush , the favourite of the establishment , would be the candidate . &quot;
a majority of the Republi@@ cans do not see Tru@@ mps temper@@ ament as a problem .
&quot; while Donald Tru@@ mp is widely critic@@ ised for its bom@@ b@@ astic and offensive statements , 52 per cent of the Irish vot@@ ers who dict@@ ate the real estate have the right temper@@ ament for a president , ABC News / Washington Post on Monday . &quot;
&quot; the same number is in the first pre @-@ election state of the nation , the state of I@@ owa , where the same 52 percent of the Republi@@ cans believe that he has the personality for a Commander @-@ in @-@ Chief , according to Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac last week . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless 44 percent think he did not have the personality to effectively carry out his office , and almost six of 10 independ@@ ents say that his tem@@ per did not fit into the White House , ABC / Post . &quot;
Republi@@ can vot@@ ers get used to the idea .
&quot; if they expose their funds , Republi@@ can vot@@ ers hold Tru@@ mp for real . &quot;
&quot; if they are asked who wins the GO@@ P nom@@ ination , after a survey by CN@@ N / OR@@ C last week , four out of ten that Tru@@ mp is the best bet . &quot;
this is a change since that time when four out of ten end of July they put their money on J@@ eb Bush .
full disclosure : GO@@ P vot@@ ers did not have the clear@@ est crystal ball in the past .
&quot; at this time in the last cycle , four out of ten re@@ public@@ ans thought that Rick Perry would win the nom@@ ination only 28 % for the final candidate Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , a variety of GO@@ P vot@@ ers can regard campaign as plau@@ sible . &quot;
&quot; even if the Republi@@ cans gathered around another candidate , Tru@@ mp hits almost everyone . &quot;
&quot; some experts point out that the sh@@ atter@@ ing field probably contributes to Tru@@ mps guidance , while anti @-@ Tru@@ mp support is distributed to more than a dozen other Candi@@ dates . &quot;
&quot; but a survey conducted by the Mon@@ mouth University in early September shows that in a hyp@@ othe@@ tical head @-@ in @-@ head race between Tru@@ mp and most other Republi@@ can candidates , Tru@@ mp has re@@ aped the majority support . &quot;
&quot; before Car@@ ly Fi@@ or@@ ina 13 points Vor@@ sprung , before Marco Ru@@ bio 14 points , before Walker 15 points , before J@@ eb Bush 19 points and finally ahead of Rand Paul , John Ka@@ ely and Chris Christi@@ e 33 points . &quot;
it is a head @-@ in @-@ head race with Ted Cruz .
the only candidate who strikes him ?
Ben Car@@ son would over@@ take the entrepren@@ eur with 19 points in a hyp@@ othe@@ tical head @-@ in @-@ head race .
a scar@@ ce majority of Donald Tru@@ mp fans say they have formed their opinion .
&quot; a new survey by C@@ BS / NY@@ T on Tuesday reveals that only a little more than half of the vot@@ ers who support Tru@@ mp , say they have for@@ given their votes . &quot;
&quot; of course , much can happen to change that , and no one can really say , never change the opinion . &quot;
&quot; 46 percent said that they leave the door open , in order to change candidates . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , Tru@@ mps is strongest competition at the moment the other out@@ si@@ ders , the neurolog@@ ist Ben Car@@ son , but vot@@ ers who say they have formed their minds are twice as often for Tru@@ mp . &quot;
six out of 10 re@@ public@@ ans say that they coinci@@ de with Tru@@ mp on immigration .
&quot; since Donald Tru@@ mp , in his election campaign , two months ago immigrants from Mexico called &quot; rap@@ acious , &quot; was the immigration of turning and fishing in the public discourse on 2016 . &quot;
some are concerned that the bom@@ b@@ astic print@@ out of Tru@@ mp &apos;s crucial His@@ p@@ ano Americans will keep away from the Republi@@ can Party and to damage re@@ orientation efforts .
&quot; but after the new ABC / Post survey on Monday , six out of 10 republi@@ can say that they agree with Tru@@ mp on issues of immigration . &quot;
&quot; so long as the em@@ igration remains in the spotlight , Donald Tru@@ mp seems to do it . &quot;
the fru@@ stration of the government climb@@ s up to new high@@ s .
&quot; Donald Tru@@ mp and Ben Car@@ son , in the meantime , accounts for about half of the support of Republi@@ can vot@@ ers , especially by their out@@ sider status . &quot;
&quot; six out of 10 Republi@@ cans say in the new Mon@@ days pol@@ l of ABC / Post , they prefer a political out@@ sider than someone with government experience . &quot;
and they are angry with Washington .
a survey of Des Mo@@ ines Register / Blo@@ om@@ berg in I@@ owa two weeks ago shows that three of four I@@ owa Republi@@ cans are fru@@ str@@ ated by the Republi@@ cans in Congress with 54 per cent &quot; uns@@ atis@@ fied &quot; and 21 per cent &quot; hell@@ ish . &quot;
&quot; Munich , Sy@@ lt and Co . : the five exclusive residential areas in Germany &quot;
here in the look@@ out there is the most expensive residential complex - overlooking the North Sea .
&quot; in the street , one square meter of a rear building cost 7@@ 3.@@ 300 euros . &quot;
&quot; according to Sy@@ lt , the range of objects is naturally limited , &quot; it is said in the study - therefore the high price . &quot;
a new study shows in which particular layers a square meter is most cost .
&quot; of course , 18,@@ 70 Euro per square meter for a student book in Munich are not really little . &quot;
&quot; in contrast to Germany &apos;s top @-@ class hotels , however , one of the price is like Pe@@ an@@ uts . &quot;
the real estate service provider Engel &amp; Völ@@ ker has published a ranking list of the most exclusive German living locations - with square met@@ er@@ prizes in di@@ zz@@ ying heights .
&quot; there are several tens of thousands of Euro nix - per square meter , noted . &quot;
but good who can afford it ...
&quot; by the way : in this case , Munich is not at the top here . &quot;
Champions League : Bavaria @-@ dream start thanks to Müller and Göt@@ ze
two @-@ fold cont@@ actor in Pi@@ raeus : Bayern @-@ Star Thomas Müller has just one run .
a happy hit by Thomas Müller gave the way to the FC Bayern the way to a deser@@ ved 3 : 0 at Olympia &apos;s Pi@@ re@@ aus - then it ran .
a Sovereign launch of the Champions League season .
the world champion Thomas Müller and Mario Göt@@ ze gave the FC Bayern a dream start into the &quot; Mission Milan &quot; in the heart of Pi@@ raeus .
the team of Trainer P@@ ep Guardi@@ ola won their kick @-@ off in the Champions League at the Greek record master Olympi@@ ak@@ os in hot atmosphere thanks to g@@ arb@@ age double pack ( 5@@ 2nd / 90@@ . + 2 ) and i@@ dol ( 89@@ . ) earned with 3 : 0 ( 0 : 0 ) .
&quot; the twel@@ fth success in series is to be the first step towards final on May 28 , 2016 in Italy , where Guardi@@ ola will finally pick up the h@@ enk@@ el@@ pot@@ t to Munich in the third race . &quot;
&quot; during his 28th hit in the Champions League , Müller received good assistance from Olympi@@ ak@@ os @-@ Tor@@ wart Roberto , who passed a tribute to the world master as a flan@@ k . &quot;
&quot; we will not under@@ estimate them , &quot; Bavaria @-@ captain Philipp Lah@@ m promised before the game in the Kar@@ ais@@ k@@ ak@@ is Stadium in front of 31.@@ 688 hot @-@ bloo@@ ded fans - and the Munich held words . &quot;
they showed a concentrated and dedicated performance without sh@@ aking .
&quot; Pi@@ raeus had won his latest six home games in the league , among them against renowned clubs such as Manchester United , At@@ l@@ é@@ tico Madrid or Ju@@ vent@@ us Turin . &quot;
2011 Bor@@ us@@ sia Dortmund ( 1 : 3 ) stum@@ bled here .
&quot; but Bavaria , in seven Europ@@ ac@@ up du@@ els with Greek teams un@@ defeated , did not want to be the next victim . &quot;
&quot; they went cour@@ age@@ ously ran , but in their offensive efforts often too resour@@ c@@ eful to work . &quot;
&quot; the attacks have often been initiated on the left outside of Douglas Costa , which rarely occurred against the former Braunschwei@@ ger O@@ mar El@@ ab@@ d@@ ell@@ a@@ ou@@ i . &quot;
Müller had more luck on the right when his flan@@ k sm@@ ashed out of the right half @-@ field in the left upper gate .
in the 67@@ th minute the world champion gave the possible 2 : 0 .
the best occasions in half one had Robert Lew@@ and@@ owski .
&quot; first of all , when the Olympi@@ ak@@ os @-@ stor@@ mer Ide@@ ye Brown proposed the Pole of Poland from the line ( 26 . ) . &quot;
&quot; then by direct removal , the go@@ al@@ keeper Roberto with the knee par@@ ked ( 35 . ) . &quot;
&quot; although the Bavaria raised its acc@@ u@@ stom@@ ed play , Pi@@ re@@ aus could set needle stal@@ ks . &quot;
but on door@@ ke@@ epers Manuel Neu@@ er was a decree .
&quot; for example , when he drew a shot from Ide@@ ye over the lat@@ te ( 56@@ th ) . &quot;
&quot; before New , Guardi@@ ola gave a four @-@ chain chain with David Al@@ aba in the center next to Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng , who did it well . &quot;
&quot; Mario Göt@@ ze , after mus@@ cular problems back in the cad@@ re , was first sitting outside . &quot;
&quot; after the final training , the World Cup hero was given the green light only after gradu@@ ating , &quot; &quot; said Sports Officer Matthias Sam@@ mer at &quot; Sky &quot; : &quot; he who wants to make something different from it is already mal@@ ign@@ ant . &quot;
&quot; even during the first change , Guardi@@ ola decided against him when he brought K@@ ings@@ ley Com@@ an to Lew@@ and@@ owski ( 59 . ) . &quot;
&quot; Göt@@ ze arrived late for Ar@@ tur@@ o Vi@@ dal ( 7@@ 6. ) and made everything clear 13 minutes later , by El@@ f@@ meter Müller , Müller remained on it . &quot;
in front of the game it had come to Kra@@ w@@ allen in the stadium .
&quot; after a smaller group of partly displac@@ ed Bavaria fans in their audience blo@@ c apparently prov@@ oked the supporters of hosts Pir@@ äus with words and gest@@ ures , the security forces interven@@ ed and went against the Munich supporters . &quot;
at least one Bayern fan was injured out of the stadium .
who smo@@ kes has a higher risk to lose teeth
&quot; who smo@@ kes , does not only harm the lungs , but also the teeth - that suggests a Potsdam long @-@ term study . &quot;
the good news : at Ver@@ zi@@ cht the risk drops rapidly .
smo@@ kers have a significantly increased risk of losing their teeth early .
&quot; this goes out of the long @-@ term study of an international research team , including several employees of the German Institute for Nutrition Research ( DI@@ f@@ E ) in Potsdam . &quot;
&quot; compared to non @-@ smo@@ kers , smo@@ kers had the risk of losing their teeth pre@@ matur@@ ely in order to increase the 2,5@@ - to 3.6 @-@ fold . &quot;
the scientists had observed more than 23.@@ 300 participants .
&quot; main causes of tooth decay are c@@ aries and inflammation of the g@@ um , stresses the DI@@ f@@ E . &quot;
&quot; for this peri@@ od@@ on@@ ti@@ tis , smoking is a risk factor , stress the authors . &quot;
the connection between smoking and tooth loss therefore goes back to more frequent inflamm@@ ations in smo@@ kers .
&quot; not clari@@ fied , to what extent smoking also increases the risk of c@@ aries . &quot;
&quot; people who stopped smoking could reduce their risk in a short time , write the researchers in the &quot; Journal of Dental Research . &quot; &quot;
&quot; however , it could take over ten years until the threat to the level of non @-@ smo@@ kers sin@@ ks , explained Dr. Thomas Dietrich from the English University Birmingham . &quot;
&quot; one must convince people to become non @-@ smo@@ kers , declared leader of H@@ einer Bo@@ eing from DI@@ f@@ E : &quot; smoking reduces life time . &quot;
&quot; not smoking is good for lung and v@@ ascular and , according to our findings , also leads to a good dental health down to high age . &quot;
&quot; in Germany , over 20 percent of the population aged 65 to 74 years of co@@ hes@@ ion affected the DI@@ f@@ E . &quot;
earlier studies have already indicated that smoking increases the risk of early tooth loss .
the new long @-@ term study under@@ pinn@@ ed the findings .
archae@@ ologists encounter remains from the late Anti@@ quity at Cologne Rhein@@ u@@ fer
&quot; for the repeated time , archaeological finds have been found on the right bank of the Rhine . &quot;
&quot; near the construction site for the new Rhine bou@@ levard , archae@@ ologists have excav@@ ated skel@@ et@@ ons and remn@@ ants of historical buildings , said Museum leader Marcus Trier on Tuesday . &quot;
histori@@ ans have been searching for so @-@ called ground monuments since the beginning of the construction work on the Rhine .
&quot; in all building projects in the city district of Cologne , the museum is always drawn up as a specialist for archaeological excav@@ ations . &quot;
in the third section of the Rhine bou@@ levard the archae@@ ologists were now found .
&quot; text documents have already been known that in the 4th century a fortress and in the 8th century stood a church , Trier explained . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the remains of the fortress and the church tower , there was also a cemetery with about 350 tom@@ bs that belonged to the church . &quot;

European Commission proposes new court in dispute over T@@ TIP
&quot; to def@@ use the dispute over the planned trans@@ atlan@@ tic free trade agreement , the European Commission has proposed a comprehensive reform of the current arbit@@ ration system . &quot;
&quot; the controversial private arbit@@ ration institutions for disputes between corporations and states should therefore be replaced by a transparent system , which corresponds to considerably more traditional dishes . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we want to set up a system that the citizens trust , &quot; &quot; said European commission@@ er Ceci@@ lia Malm@@ ström . &quot;
the Swe@@ de proposes to bring the proposal as a European negoti@@ ating position to the Free Trade talks with the US .
the German government announced support .
T@@ TIP aims to create the world &apos;s largest free trade zone with 800 million people .
the plans for the reform of the current arbit@@ ration proceedings con@@ cre@@ t@@ ely suggest that the EU states and the United States jointly select independent judges for a new investment court .
&quot; they should come to equal parts from the EU , the United States and third countries . &quot;
for the first time a second instance is planned .
it would allow it to raise obj@@ ections against judgments .
&quot; so far , the parties involved reconc@@ iled themselves to arbit@@ rators , a possibility to claim against their judgments . &quot;
&quot; in the debate over the past few months , it became clear that citizens do not trust the old IS@@ DS system in fair@@ ness and justice , commented on Malm@@ ström . &quot;
&quot; in the long term , it wants to work according to its own data to an international investment court . &quot;
&quot; there , for example , disputes between Chinese companies and EU countries could also be clari@@ fied . &quot;
&quot; the investor @-@ state arbit@@ ration ( IS@@ DS ) , particularly demanded by large corporations , is considered to be one of the major reasons for the great resistance in Europe against T@@ TIP . &quot;
&quot; the traditional arbit@@ ration tri@@ bun@@ als are cri@@ tici@@ zed by opponents as a kind of parall@@ el@@ ism , which allows the company to break down tax@@ pay@@ ers , negotiate national laws , or have a reduction in consumer and environmental standards . &quot;
&quot; in the first comments , anti @-@ T@@ TIP @-@ organisations such as Camp@@ act designated the Commission &apos;s proposals as in@@ adequate . &quot;
it was especially cri@@ tici@@ zed that they are not supposed to apply to the already negoti@@ ated free trade agreement with Canada ( C@@ eta ) .
&quot; by contrast , the German econom@@ ist Matthias Mach@@ nig ( SPD ) described the plans as a major step forward . &quot;
the Commission considered essential points in the reform that German Federal Minister of Economic Affairs signed Sig@@ mar Gabriel in spring with other EU trade ministers .
the old system of private arbit@@ ration courts is from the table .
the French government also welcomed the plans of Malm@@ ström .
the European company B@@ US@@ IN@@ ES@@ S@@ EURO@@ PE warned against limiting the potential of the economy by too many new rules .
&quot; in this way , especially small and medium @-@ sized enterprises could be depri@@ ved of them . &quot;
&quot; when the talks on the T@@ TIP ( Trans@@ atlan@@ tic Trade and Investment Partnership ) agreement can be concluded , Wednesday remained uncle@@ ar . &quot;
the negotiations have been running since the middle of 2013 .
&quot; however , investor protection has not been discussed with the US . &quot;
&quot; originally , a framework for the agreement should already stand at the end of this year . &quot;
this date is considered to be no longer unten@@ able .
del@@ ik@@ ater folk by Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens in Hamburg
&quot; eleven years ago , Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens sits on stage in the Cologne Prime Club ( today : Lux@@ or ) . &quot;
&quot; next to him is a fli@@ p@@ chart , on which the shy tor@@ tured singer recorded the picturesque US state of Michigan with felt pen . &quot;
&quot; the entire audience , about 40 people , is almost seized by St@@ ev@@ ens &apos;s lecture . &quot;
&quot; he tells us about different places , which he repeat@@ ed@@ ely records on the map , about his min@@ u@@ zi@@ ous and delic@@ ately arranged songs . &quot;
&quot; where they were born and how it looks , in his homeland . &quot;
&quot; since then , St@@ ev@@ ens proves to be a wonderfully creative irrit@@ ation . &quot;

Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ ns debut at the Premier of the Prime Minister
&quot; since his election , Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s debut has been eag@@ erly awa@@ ited by the prime minister &apos;s fac@@ ul@@ ties . &quot;
the new Labour leader Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n should give his debut to the Prime Minister &apos;s fr@@ enz@@ y and for the first time with David Cameron .
&quot; Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will rise to raise the first of his six questions shortly after lunch , whereby his performance is likely to be examined by the media and the Labour MEPs from nearby . &quot;
he called for &quot; less theatre and more facts &quot; at this weekly event .
he also said he could ski@@ p some sessions to leave them to their colleagues .
&quot; the meeting will be the first parliamentary test for Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s leadership , as it comes after his appointment as a member of the shadow cabinet and after his speech at the TU@@ C Annual Meeting on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; in the meantime , the decision of the Labour leader , on Tuesday , during the singing of the national an@@ them during a commemor@@ ative ceremony commemor@@ ating the 75@@ th anniversary of the Battle of Britain in silence , has prov@@ oked criticism from a number of T@@ ory @-@ MPs and stands at the center of several cover @-@ pages in the newspapers . &quot;
&quot; Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s decision to not sing the national an@@ them , has attracted attention &quot;
&quot; a spokes@@ man of Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said he had been &quot; &quot; resp@@ ect@@ ful of silence &quot; &quot; and he accepted the &quot; &quot; hero@@ ism of the Royal Air Force in the Battle of England &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; but a member of Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns shadow kab@@ in@@ ett , O@@ wen Smith , told the BBC Two News@@ night program , he advised the Labour leader to sing the national hy@@ m@@ ns , &quot; independently &quot; of his belief that the monarchy should be abol@@ ished . &quot;
&quot; almost a dozen of shadow ministers refused to serve in Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s top team and called for differences in the economy , defence and foreign affairs , while less than a sixth of the Par@@ liam@@ entary Party originally supported him as a leader . &quot;
&quot; the Political Cor@@ respon@@ dent of the BBC Robin Bran@@ t says that political differences are also st@@ acking within Labour , namely by Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns statements on the position of the European Union and the limitation of winn@@ ings . &quot;
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said the TU@@ C conference that Labour would make changes in order to remove the whole idea of limitation altogether .
&quot; later , Mr Smith , the shadow labour and pensions minister said that the party was &quot; very clear &quot; that it was only against government plans to reduce the limit of £ 26@@ ,000 to £ 23@@ ,000 . &quot;
&quot; Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will be the fifth Labour leader , David Cameron ever since he is T@@ ory boss , over the disp@@ el @-@ box in the Parliament over the last decade . &quot;
&quot; the Labour leader , who has promised another policy approach , says he has given &quot; Crow@@ d @-@ sourc@@ ed &quot; ideas for questions to Mr Cameron and gave him more than 30.000 suggestions . &quot;
&quot; the Is@@ lington North MP said that the prime minister &apos;s fac@@ ul@@ ties are too con@@ front@@ ational , and that he has both &quot; &quot; per@@ sever@@ ance &quot; &quot; and the strike with barb@@ ed hooks , and instead decided to concentrate on serious problems such as poverty , ine@@ quality and challenges for young people . &quot;
&quot; Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said Angela Merkel , the shadow of economic minister , will be represented if he does not participate , for example when Mr Cameron is travelling abroad . &quot;
&quot; he has also brought the idea into conversation that other colleagues occasionally take the word , and that he spoke to John Ber@@ cow , the speaker of the under@@ house , to discuss the problem . &quot;
&quot; when he was a leader in 2005 , Mr Cameron said that he wanted to remove himself from politics in the style of a &quot; Kas@@ per@@ le theatre , &quot; often associated with the prime minister &apos;s fr@@ enz@@ y . but a few years later he admitted that he failed . &quot;
&quot; since it was first broadcast on television in 1990 , the questionn@@ aire with the prime minister was regarded as the most important bar@@ ometer of a leader and his leadership in the under@@ house and his position among his parliam@@ ent@@ arians , although critics have argu@@ ed that they have become a car@@ ic@@ ature and require widespread reforms . &quot;

pound ster@@ ling through accelerated growth in the United Kingdom
&quot; the pound has risen sharp@@ ly according to data , which showed an increase in the wage growth of the United Kingdom . in parallel , the FT@@ SE 100 was increased by the target target SA@@ BM@@ iller . &quot;
&quot; between May and July , the result without bonuses in the United Kingdom grew by 2.9 % over the same period of the previous year . &quot;
&quot; since 2009 , this percentage has been the fastest and er@@ ased estimates at the time of an increase in interest . &quot;
&quot; the pound rose by more than 1 % over the dollar to $ 1,@@ 550@@ 5 and was climb@@ ed up to 0.@@ 84 % over the euro to € 1,@@ 37@@ 30 . &quot;
the FT@@ SE 100 index included an increase of 1.@@ 49 % to 6.@@ 2@@ 29.@@ 21 .
SA@@ BM@@ iller was the outstanding share in the market and made a leap of 20 % after acquisition of the ri@@ val AB In@@ Be@@ v .
&quot; a transaction would combine the two largest bre@@ wer@@ ies in the world and combine brands like Bud@@ weiser , Stella Ar@@ to@@ is , Per@@ oni and Gro@@ l@@ sch . &quot;
&quot; following encouraging news from the competition group for luxury goods , Bur@@ berry Sh@@ ares were 0.9 % higher . &quot;
Ri@@ chem@@ on@@ ts latest sales figures hit all expectations and also showed that sales in China - a key market for Bur@@ berry - reported growth again .
&quot; shares of Gl@@ enc@@ ore increased by 5 % , after the mining giant said that it took € 2.5 billion by a stock sales as part of its debt reduction strategy . &quot;
&quot; the shares in the packaging and paper company Mon@@ di were the biggest los@@ ers on the index , and with a decrease of 4.3 % , after Gold@@ man Sach@@ s had set his assessment for the company rating on &quot; &quot; sell &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; JD Sports rose by 3.1 % , after the sports nutrition company reported a pre @-@ tax result of 46.@@ 6 million for the half @-@ year . &quot;
the head of JD Sports says that higher wages are endanger@@ ing expansion .
the managing director of JD Sports Peter Cow@@ g@@ ill said that a higher minimum wage for UK workers &quot; could mean more purchasing power in the pockets of potential customers .
&quot; but it is unlikely that this purchasing power will compens@@ ate the higher labor costs in his company , he says . &quot;
&quot; the costs could include the expansion plans of JD Sports , he added , and that could mean that there are less additional jobs . &quot;

the 15 @-@ year @-@ old has never heard the name &quot; R@@ itz Carl@@ ton &quot; before .
not bad .
hundreds of fans accompanied Jus@@ tin yesterday .
among them E@@ wa and Vi@@ kt@@ oria from Poland .
&quot; since 7 o &apos;clock in the morning , however , the Pol@@ in sits on the cold stone plate front of Berlin luxury hotel at Pots@@ dam@@ er Platz . &quot;
&quot; the bi@@ eber construction : here you are living i@@ dol whose poster is hanging on in St@@ et@@ tin , since Monday evening . &quot;
&quot; the suite , in which the Canadian singer lives , costs exactly as much as her Mama E@@ wa deserves half a year . &quot;

some say the hyp@@ e is too far .
&quot; others stress that even in the USA and the UK with his new single &quot; What do you mean ? &quot; on No.@@ 1 . &quot;

PE@@ GI@@ DA @-@ Plak@@ at brings the Leban@@ ese idea to the potato @-@ crow@@ er idea
potatoes or D@@ ön@@ er ?
&quot; both - and in the Kartoffel@@ keller , the Ol@@ den@@ burger I@@ mb@@ iss@@ owner Han@@ i Al@@ h@@ ay has developed . &quot;
&quot; inspired by the saying &quot; potato instead of twe@@ eter &quot; on a poster of the Peg@@ ida movement , Al@@ h@@ ay Pot@@ ato and meat put together on a sk@@ ewer . &quot;
&quot; the idea brought him a poster at a Peg@@ ida rally with the inscription &quot; &quot; potatoes instead of twe@@ eter &quot; , &quot; which he had seen acci@@ dentally on television . &quot;
&quot; since then , a barbecue sp@@ it has been turned in its store , which is equipped with meat and potatoes . &quot;
&quot; this is multic@@ ult@@ i for the stomach , &quot; says Al@@ h@@ ay . &quot;
the idea of the Leban@@ ese has meanwhile been submitted to the Patent Office in Munich .
&quot; according to the authority , it has recently been protected as a utility model . &quot;
&quot; as much meat and how much potatoes are the sk@@ ewer , Al@@ h@@ ay doesn &apos;t want to betra@@ y . &quot;
&quot; only as much : &quot; it tastes better together , &quot; he finds . &quot;
&quot; also with his customers , the culinary understanding of the nations is good . &quot;
Met@@ cash launches ground ste@@ alth campaign to combat algae inf@@ estation
cash tries to protect the IG@@ A branch in front of an Al@@ di @-@ rise in South Australia and Western Australia .
food wholes@@ aler Met@@ cash has launched a ground ste@@ alth campaign to defend the market share of IG@@ A retailers in South Australia and Western Australia in advance of a 700 million $ Al@@ di invasion .
&quot; while Al@@ di has prepared the opening of two distribution centres and the first 120 stores in South Australia and Western Australia in the beginning of next year , Met@@ cash and IG@@ A supermarkets strengthen their relationships with local food suppliers and build the IG@@ A brand through mainstream marketing and marketing via social media , as well as events such as Adel@@ ai@@ de show . &quot;
&quot; Ig@@ A dealers and suppliers jump on board , with brands such as ice manufacturers S@@ immo from D@@ uns@@ bor@@ ough , who distri@@ butes samples in IG@@ A stores and shop owners who sell approved tickets for the South Australian football league to loyal customers . &quot;
&quot; it is expected that Met@@ cash will publish further details of its defence strategy on September 29 , when the wholes@@ aler performs its annual investor strategy day for food , alcohol and equipment . &quot;
&quot; it is much at stake , since South Australia and Western Australia make up almost 30 percent of Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s IG@@ A store operations and generate higher profits than Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s IG@@ A network in eastern states . &quot;
&quot; buyers in South Australia and Western Australia are not@@ ori@@ ally provincial and IG@@ A retailers have a much stronger market share than in New South Wales , Victoria and Que@@ ens@@ land - over 30 percent in South Australia and 24 percent in Western Australia compared to around 14 percent in eastern Australia . &quot;
&quot; however , analysts like Morgan Stan@@ ley believe that Al@@ di will take twelve months after opening its first markets around five percent of the food market in these two states and will take away sales of all existing players , but mainly independent retailers . &quot;
&quot; according to a report published this week , the analy@@ st Tom K@@ ier@@ ath of Morgan Stan@@ ley estimated that IG@@ A retailers could lose 360 million turnover per year and met@@ a $ 250 million by the end of 2016 . &quot;
this forecast is based on the assumption that Al@@ di opened 25 stores in SA and 30 in WA in the next year and will achieve a turnover of $ 500 million and $ 600 million in each market .
&quot; the loss in food and food business and the quantities on Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s of a high fixed cost base could cost $ 13 million in earnings before interest and taxes , said Mr K@@ ier@@ ath . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , Met@@ cash loses market shares in eastern states , mainly in Al@@ di and Col@@ es , although a recently conducted survey by Roy Morgan discovered that IG@@ A buyers are the most tru@@ th@@ ful . &quot;
&quot; Morgan Stan@@ ley assumes that Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s will rise by 3.8 percent in 2016 , by 4.1 percent in 2017 and 2.1 percent in 2018 and reduce the market share of 14 percent in 2015 to 10.@@ 3 percent by 2020 . &quot;
&quot; last week , the leading fund manager Ham@@ ish Dou@@ glass , the founder of Mag@@ ell@@ an Financial Group , told a business dinner in Melbourne that Met@@ cash would likely disappear within a decade . Met@@ cash will disappear . &quot;
cash declined to respond publicly to the comments of Mr Dou@@ glass .
but it is assumed that a committee member of Met@@ cash received contact with Mr Dou@@ glass last week .
&quot; since 2010 , i@@ Gas market share has dropped by 18 percent to 14 percent , and revenues from Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s food and food traff@@ icking , which accounts for approximately 1,@@ 200 IG@@ A retailers , has fallen by 43 percent since 2012 , which reflects the operating debt reduction in both turnover and mar@@ gins . &quot;
&quot; however , the wholes@@ aler finds itself and inv@@ ests more than $ 150 million in order to increase sales prices with Col@@ es and Wo@@ ol@@ wor@@ ths at hundreds of products every week and to provide IG@@ A retailers to improve their stores by fast growing fresh foods and to provide a better choice of private label foods . &quot;
Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s &apos;s main business leader Ian Mor@@ rice says that price adjustments and charging san@@ itation programs to El@@ an are expected and hopes that the wholes@@ aler will return to profit growth in 2017 for the first time in four years .
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is is supported by the president of Australian tennis association Steve He@@ aly
Th@@ an@@ asi co@@ kin@@ ak@@ is deserves more praise than criticism for his behaviour .
&quot; Th@@ an@@ asi co@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was one of the &quot; &quot; coll@@ ateral damage &quot; &quot; in the recent storm around his friend Nick Kyr@@ gi@@ os and deserves praise for his own behaviour according to the President of the Australian tennis association Steve He@@ aly . &quot;
&quot; Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is , the younger of the talented Du@@ os , which is repeatedly called &quot; Special K@@ s , &quot; gro@@ unded by the in@@ famous struggle of Kyr@@ gy@@ z@@ stan with St@@ an Wa@@ wr@@ in@@ ka at the Montreal Masters in the spotlight . &quot;
&quot; in a fier@@ y qualifying game in C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati soon afterwards Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is and his opponent Ryan Har@@ rison had to be separated by the refer@@ ee twice , and Har@@ rison appe@@ aled : &quot; Wa@@ wr@@ in@@ ka would have to beat Kyr@@ gy@@ z@@ os , and I should beat the child . &quot;
&quot; while he was finally seen how he sm@@ ashed a tennis r@@ ack@@ et , after a Kr@@ amp@@ f def@@ ended a potential US Open victory of Richard Gas@@ quet , Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was def@@ ended by He@@ aly . &quot;
&quot; the teen@@ ager is currently in Glasgow , in the competition with Sam Gr@@ oth for the second place in the single behind Bernard Tom@@ ic in the Davis Cup semi @-@ fin@@ als against Great Britain . &quot;
&quot; one thing about which I am very brave , is the fact that after my view Th@@ an@@ asi was drawn into the argument , &quot; He@@ aly said . &quot;
&quot; he has broken a r@@ ack@@ et , when he lost in the US Open because of a fight , but he is not the first player to break a r@@ ack@@ et from fru@@ stration with himself , and I know Th@@ an@@ asi well enough to know that he is not proud of it . &quot;
&quot; but , really , he has beha@@ ved extremely well in the US Open , even among the rather pro@@ voc@@ ative circumstances with Har@@ rison and so on , and I think he deserves much appreciation . &quot;
&quot; he has a great team around him , he has a great family around him , and I think he was treated a little too severely . &quot;
&quot; he is a very mature 19 @-@ year @-@ old , he works very hard and he fits into the team and so on , he has never had a problem with the other players , he is well in shape , he is a very sturdy and mature young guy , and I think he deserves to be judged according to his own mer@@ its . &quot;
&quot; He@@ aly also supported the decision to not consider Kyr@@ gy@@ z@@ os on Friday , and he describes the &quot; common decision &quot; as the right one for everyone , but he ass@@ ures the man from Can@@ ber@@ ra to return as a long @-@ term fixed part to the team . &quot;
&quot; first , we wish that the team is completely focused on the competition and not on all the controversi@@ es around &#91; Kyr@@ gi@@ os &#93; , &quot; said He@@ aly . &quot;
&quot; some time outside the spotlight he gets , but we try to help him understand the consequences of his actions . &quot;
&quot; Europe &apos;s refugee crisis : Hungary declares emergency , closes the border , keeps refugees back &quot;
Hungary declared the emergency and marked the southern border with Serbia on Tuesday and held all those trying to enter the country illeg@@ ally . all with the aim of stopping the influ@@ x of migrants .
chaos followed at the border when hundreds of migrants accum@@ ulate in a Ni@@ em@@ and@@ s@@ land and re@@ acted Serbian officials .
the people who fled from violence were stuck in a land strip at the road between the two control points of the countries and built tents and settled there .
but fru@@ str@@ ations rose up .
&quot; when a police helicop@@ ter ho@@ ver@@ ed over them , the migrants &quot; &quot; open the fron@@ tier ! &quot; &quot; and crying ins@@ ults against the Hungarian government police . &quot;
some referred to Prot@@ est Food and Water .
&quot; Serbia &apos;s Foreign Minister declared it &quot; un@@ acceptable &quot; that migrants from Hungary would be returned , while more and more from Macedonia and Greece arrive . &quot;
( Serbia ) wants to be part of the solution and not a coll@@ ateral damage .
&quot; in the coming days , talks with Brussels and other countries must take place , &quot; said I@@ vica D@@ ac@@ ic in Prague . &quot;
the turbul@@ ences at the Hungarian @-@ Serbian border came a day after the 28 @-@ Nations @-@ blo@@ c with a controversial meeting in Brussels failed to agree on a common immigration policy .
&quot; however , the ministers agreed to share the responsibility for 4@@ 0,000 people who sought refuge in the over@@ hau@@ led Italy and Greece . &quot;
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria called on Tuesday a special summit of the European Union to discuss the immigration crisis of the continent .
&quot; however , Hungary did not put his hopes for a swi@@ ft action in Brussels or its neighb@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; the emergency room rested on Tuesday in two southern regions gave authorities more powers to tackle the crisis , so that they could block roads and accelerate asylum procedures . &quot;
the Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to said that his country also plans to build a barb@@ ed wire fence along its border to Romania to stop the influ@@ x of migrants from the country after having completed a fence on the Serbian border .
&quot; C@@ BS News correspon@@ dent Charlie D &apos;@@ Ag@@ ata reported that even j@@ ail races were used during the race , the barb@@ ed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia . &quot;
&quot; in recent months , Hungary has become a significant bott@@ len@@ eck and an entry point to the European Union for many refugees from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East . &quot;
&quot; however , Prime Minister Viktor Or@@ ban insist@@ ed that most of the incoming economic refugees are looking for a better life , and not war refugees that have the right to protection - a view that is strongly opposed to other EU states , including Germany . &quot;
&quot; the new laws , which entered into force at midnight in Hungary , make the crossing of the border or the damage of the 4 @-@ meter ( 13 feet ) high fence , which the government built along the southern border to Serbia , to a crime . these laws also specify higher liability for convic@@ ted traff@@ ick@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; because of the situation caused by the mass migration , the Hungarian government declares state of emergency , &quot; said spokes@@ man Z@@ ol@@ tan K@@ ov@@ acs repor@@ ters in the southern city of Sz@@ eg@@ ed . &quot;
we are saying it very clearly : illegal border crossing is a crime .
&quot; the Parliament must still agree on the use of the military , expected for next week , but repor@@ ters from Associ@@ ated Press have already seen heavily armed soldiers with vehicles and dogs . &quot;
&quot; Gy@@ org@@ y Bak@@ on@@ di , country security advisor for Or@@ ban , said that authorities had 45 people trying to cross the border , 15 others were already deeper into the country . &quot;
&quot; they come across by dam@@ aging the fence , they are now in police custo@@ dy and are accused of committ@@ ing crimes under the new laws . &quot;
authorities are ready to repair the fence quickly .
&quot; on Tuesday morning Hungarian officials also joined two of the seven border cross@@ ings with Serbia , after a train carriage with barb@@ ed wire to close the borders . &quot;
&quot; chaos enc@@ ir@@ cl@@ ed the most important border crossing near Ros@@ z@@ ke , Hungary , when Hungary opened a small office in a metal container to process the data of people and pushing a crowd to crowd there . &quot;
&quot; about 20 succeeded in entering , but thousands remained outside . &quot;
another group of migrants blocked the main highway connecting from Serbia and Hungary and said that they would refuse food and water until they travel to Hungary .
election @-@ 2016 : Hill@@ ary Clinton &apos;s lead ahead of Ber@@ nie S@@ anders in national pol@@ l
&quot; the former US Secretary of State Hill@@ ary Clinton also holds a double @-@ digit lead in the democratic race for nom@@ ination at national level , but Sen@@ ator Ber@@ nie S@@ anders wins her against the ground . &quot;
&quot; Clinton has now supported 47 percent of democratic vot@@ ers in the pre @-@ elections ( 58 % before ) , while S@@ anders are second , with 27 percent ( increase by 17 percent ) . &quot;
&quot; Vice President Joe Bi@@ den , who has not announced yet whether he is candidates for the Pres@@ idential Office , receives support of 15 percent of the democratic vot@@ ers of the pres@@ election . &quot;
&quot; more than five months before the beginning of the elections , most democratic vot@@ ers say it is too early to say that their opinion determines which candidates they will support . &quot;
but Clin@@ tons &apos;s supporters are more consistent in their election than those of the other candidates .
&quot; since the C@@ BS News survey , Clinton has lost a number of demographic groups while S@@ anders earned some profits . &quot;
&quot; Clinton keeps a big lead in women and moder@@ ates , but these proj@@ ections have dimin@@ ished . &quot;
&quot; their support in men has decreased considerably , and S@@ anders is only with 5 points . &quot;
&quot; Clinton &apos;s advantage with democratic vot@@ ers less than 50 years has van@@ ished , and they and S@@ anders are at the same level . &quot;
&quot; however , Clinton has a big advantage with the older vot@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; last month , Clinton was faced with a double @-@ digit jump in the liber@@ als , but S@@ anders has now a 5 @-@ point lead in this group . &quot;
about half of the democratic vot@@ ers of the country &apos;s elections are saying that Clinton would support Clinton if they were nominated by the party .
&quot; a quarter would support them with some reserves and another 15 percent would only support them , because it is the candidate . &quot;
six percent would not support them .
maybe not surprisingly that Clin@@ tons &apos;s current supporters are enthusiastic about her .
the views are more mixed with those who currently don &apos;t support Clinton - only a quarter would support them enthusias@@ tically .
&quot; while 48 percent of the democratic vot@@ ers of the pres@@ election say that they support Clinton with enthusiasm , less Republi@@ can vot@@ ers say this about their nick@@ name Donald Tru@@ mp ( 35 percent ) . &quot;
&quot; if Clinton &apos;s supporters are asked in an open question why they want it to be the candidate , the most common answer is that it is time that a woman is president ( 13 percent ) and that she is the best candidate for the job ( 10 percent ) . &quot;
Clinton &apos;s supporters also mentioned their connection with Bill Clinton ( 9 percent ) .
agreement to deal with the problems and the eligi@@ bility are cited as well .
&quot; as the vice @-@ president raises a potential for the pres@@ idency to the scales , 57 percent of the democratic vot@@ ers want to see him in the race - although a third believes that he should not do it . &quot;
&quot; if democratic vot@@ ers will be asked for the election , who would be their second choice for the party , Bi@@ den is at the helm . &quot;
Clin@@ tons &apos;s supporters say more than half that Bi@@ den would be their second choice far from S@@ anders .
&quot; if Bi@@ den decides not to channel for the nom@@ ination of the Democrats , Hill@@ ary Clinton &apos;s lead ahead of S@@ anders , points out of 20 points with bi@@ ds in race on 30 points without him in the race . &quot;
&quot; fifty @-@ five percent of democratic vot@@ ers see Clinton as candidate with the best odds to win the election , but this figure has dropped by 78 per cent in the last month . &quot;
&quot; Bi@@ den is by far a second in this measurement , but the percentage that sees it as the &quot; &quot; sel@@ ectable &quot; &quot; has increased . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , on the question of what is more important with a candidate , Democratic vot@@ ers call on vot@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; similar to the last month , not a single democratic candidate or potential candidate for this vot@@ er of the pres@@ election as un@@ acceptable . &quot;
the Democratic candidates or potential candidates provide good results with some important characteristics of vot@@ ers in the pres@@ election of their party .
&quot; multi@@ tudes regard Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ ds as hon@@ estly and trust@@ worthy and with strong leadership qualities . &quot;
&quot; among the three candidates , bees are best cutting off in hon@@ esty , while Clin@@ tons &apos;s strength is the lead . &quot;
&quot; thirty percent of democratic vot@@ ers do not believe that Clinton is honest and trust@@ worthy , twice as many say it &apos;s about S@@ anders ( 15 percent ) , but 27 percent have no opinion about it . &quot;
&quot; democratic vot@@ ers in general elections also see Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den ideological in accordance with their views . &quot;
&quot; for all these measurements , about a quarter of democratic vot@@ ers have no opinion of S@@ anders . &quot;
&quot; as questions about Hill@@ ary Clinton &apos;s use of a personal e @-@ mail address and a server during the term as foreign minister , most Democratic vot@@ ers are satisfied with their explanation of the matter and say that it did not affect their opinions . &quot;
but it is a different story in the American public total .
&quot; half of the Americans are now dis@@ satisfied with their explanation , while only about one third is satisfied . &quot;
&quot; public opinion was divided in March , shortly after the problem came to light . &quot;
&quot; most Americans said that the email contro@@ vers@@ y had no effect on their overall opinion of Clinton , although 36 percent said that their opinion of it still deteri@@ or@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; they are mainly Republi@@ cans , more than six of 10 who say their views of Clinton have become worse . &quot;
&quot; although Clinton is considered honest and trust@@ worthy by the vot@@ ers of their party , this is still a problem for them among registered vot@@ ers : only 32 percent they see as honest and trust@@ worthy , eight percent less than last month and 15 points less since May . &quot;
62 percent of vot@@ ers do not hold them for an honest and trust@@ worthy person .
&quot; at the same time , 55 per cent of the eligible vot@@ ers also see Tru@@ mp as hon@@ estly and not trust@@ worthy . &quot;
&quot; Clinton and Tru@@ mp , however , maintain good grades at the lead . &quot;
&quot; from the six candidates tested , Bi@@ den , Car@@ son and Bush would best cut off hon@@ esty . &quot;
&quot; a majority regards S@@ anders rather than hon@@ estly , but as with Car@@ son , many have no opinion of him . &quot;
the error rate for the sample of 351 Democratic vot@@ ers in the primary elections is 6 percentage points .
Ben Car@@ son conclu@@ des with nation@@ wide survey near Donald Tru@@ mp
Ben Car@@ son is close to Donald Tru@@ mp &apos;s latest survey on C@@ BS News / New York Times
&quot; on the two candidates , half of the support of vot@@ ers in the new survey , and others are losing dramatically . &quot;
the support grows by 23 % in the last C@@ BS survey conducted before Fox News debate last month to 27 % in the survey on Tuesday .
but Car@@ son decreased from 6 % to 23 % in the same period .
the survey also revealed that Car@@ son reaches well in demographic groups and out@@ performs Tru@@ mp under republi@@ can vot@@ ers with university education .
&quot; the rest of the field , with the exception of Car@@ ly Fi@@ or@@ ina and Ohio Gover@@ nor John Ka@@ aba , is defeated with Wis@@ cons@@ ins Gou@@ ver@@ ne@@ ur Scott Walker , who died at the deepest , and from 10 % support last month to now 2 % . &quot;
&quot; the former Florida governor J@@ eb Bush , former governor of Ar@@ kan@@ s@@ as Mike Hu@@ ck@@ ab@@ ee and Florida Sen@@ ator Marco Ru@@ bio , are at 6 % in third place . &quot;
the error margin in the sample of 376 persons of Republi@@ can vot@@ ers in this latest survey is Plus or minus 6 % and was conducted in September .
&quot; the latest CN@@ N / OR@@ C survey , published last week , shows that Car@@ son is rising in the surveys - he lands with 19 % support among the Republi@@ cans , behind the Tru@@ mp with 32 % support . &quot;
the latest survey of ABC News / Washington Post showed Tru@@ mp clearly in front of Car@@ son .
&quot; looking at a Car@@ son rising last week , Tru@@ mp found some side branches for the former neuro@@ sur@@ geon , even after Car@@ son ap@@ ologi@@ zed to question Tru@@ mps &apos;s faith . &quot;
&quot; we need energy , &quot; &quot; said Tru@@ mp last Saturday during a campaign in I@@ owa . &quot;
pleasant bathroom temperatures : the eastern Mediterranean is currently up to 29 degrees warm .
&quot; even if peak values are measured only in distance , a trip to the Mediterranean is enough for bathing lovers to find even warm water . &quot;
a bath in the north or Baltic Sea is likely to be a rather short pleasure at a maximum of 17 degrees .
&quot; some people no longer go into the sea : a maximum of 18 degrees has the water in the North and Baltic Sea this week , the German weather service ( D@@ WD ) shares . &quot;
&quot; in contrast , bathroom temperatures continue to offer the Mediterranean : in the East it is even up to 29 degrees . &quot;
&quot; in the Adriatic it is 25 degrees , in France 23 degrees . &quot;
the Red Sea in Egypt is 28 degrees .
five members of the Brotherhood charged with the death of Bar@@ uch College @-@ Ne@@ ul@@ ings
&quot; almost two years after a student died during a schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ic ritual of a student connection in Po@@ con@@ o Mountains , Pennsylvania , murder trials against five people will be submitted . &quot;
&quot; members of the New York Bar@@ uch College P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ P@@ si Brotherhood attacked Ch@@ un &quot; Michael &quot; Den@@ g during an introduc@@ tory ritual in September 2013 and delayed his transport to hospital , which contributed to his death , the police announced . &quot;
&quot; officials said he was loaded with connected eyes with a 30 pound back@@ pack full of sand , and repeatedly attacked while trying to move over a frozen field to a target . &quot;
&quot; Mr. Den@@ g finally compl@@ ained about head@@ aches , then he fell un@@ conscious . &quot;
&quot; the members of the P@@ i @-@ Delta P@@ si Brotherhood did not call the call number 911 , after Den@@ g was impot@@ ent and suppos@@ edly waited one hour before they brought him to a hospital , so the police . &quot;
&quot; however , they had the time to switch to D@@ eng@@ o &apos;s clothing , to contact his symptoms and contact Andy Men@@ g , the national president of the Brotherhood to get advice , said Polic@@ eman Chris Wagner at a press conference . &quot;
&quot; at this point , the members , utensils began to conc@@ eal and put the good of the br@@ otherhood fundamentally over that of Michael Den@@ g , &quot; &quot; said Polic@@ eman Wagner . &quot;
&quot; he could not be revi@@ ved , and he died the next morning on his wounds . &quot;
&quot; after an aut@@ op@@ sy report , Den@@ g was repeatedly inf@@ lic@@ ted with st@@ ump@@ y strength injury to head , tor@@ so and th@@ igh@@ s . &quot;
&quot; many families have been destroyed by the chic@@ anes of the Brotherhood . at least one student dies on the chic@@ ane every year since 1970 , &quot; said Douglas F@@ ier@@ berg , a lawyer , the D@@ eng@@ du family , in an explanation . &quot;
&quot; br@@ other@@ hoods and their members must be held ac@@ coun@@ table , and this step by authorities is very important . &quot;
a County Grand Jury of Mon@@ roe recommended an indictment for the third count of the first five members .
&quot; thirty @-@ two members of the Brotherhood , including Mr Men@@ g , are also charged with suspic@@ ious attacks and formation of a criminal association . &quot;
&quot; we do not only want to blame the persons involved , but if there is an organization that has sanc@@ tioned - officially or in@@ officially - this is what we will also have to account , &quot; &quot; said Wagner at a press conference on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; Bar@@ uch College prohibited the br@@ otherhood , and the national fr@@ at@@ ernity has rev@@ oked its affili@@ ation to the local group . &quot;
this will happen when the F@@ ed increases interest rates
&quot; a place of interest comes , and the hou@@ sec@@ ts will fall into petrol , ren@@ ders for bonds will rise , and the economy will gli@@ de into recession . &quot;
this is what we know .
what we don &apos;t know is how long it will take and how long it will stop .
&quot; in particular , the history of the economy offers only little guidance to the process . &quot;
a recession came within only 11 months after the first rate of interest rate and lasted 86 months .
&quot; the Federal Reserve &apos;s aggres@@ si@@ veness at raising interest rates is often , if not always , a factor in how the economy and financial investments are acting . &quot;
&quot; therefore representatives of the US Central Bank have stressed so heavily that investors should not focus on when it starts to increase interest rates , but rather to the period required for norm@@ alisation . &quot;
&quot; in fact , several variables play a role . &quot;
&quot; at the end , however , market participants could realize that the whole excitement might be exagger@@ ated because of a interest increase . &quot;
&quot; the first increase in the F@@ ed since the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some as a signal for the end of the &quot; cheap money &quot; era , &quot; said Julian Jes@@ so@@ p , chief econom@@ ist at Capital Economics , in a message to customers . &quot;
&quot; in contrast , we do not expect the gradual return of US interest to normal heights , but still at a low level to lead to the sei@@ s@@ mic shock that many seem to fear . &quot;
&quot; however , this does not mean that there will be no effect . &quot;
here is a look at historic trends based on how some areas of the economy could react :
&quot; as the market has seen last month , the anticip@@ ation of interest increases may make things volati@@ le for a while . &quot;
&quot; once the up@@ li@@ ft@@ ment arrives , the influence is not so dramatic . &quot;
&quot; there is apparently a tendency that assets profit from 12 to 24 months after the initial increase , which may reflect the delay in monetary policy , &quot; said German @-@ Bank analysts in a recent study on what happens after interest increases in the F@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; more specifically , the market has mostly been in the upward trend in the past 35 years - about 14 percent on the way to interest rate , then back to normal state after 500 days , with an average return in the past six previous cycles of 14.@@ 4 percent , according to a current analysis that Bob Doll , chief plant strategy at Nu@@ ve@@ en Asset Management , was published at Bar@@ ron &apos;s . &quot;
Deutsche Bank said that the impact on the shares tends to occur later in the increase cycle and the return begins to decrease .
&quot; rec@@ essions are a fact of economic life , but interest increases often promote it . &quot;
&quot; in the current case , the F@@ ed is confronted with some conditions that had not existed before and which could accelerate the recession . &quot;
&quot; remark@@ ably , the gross domestic product will be near its lowest score at a interest rate of the F@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; according to Deutsche Bank , 118 interest rates have been only twice the nominal GDP of 4.5 percent since 1950 . &quot;
&quot; although the second quarter of 2015 stood at 3.6 percent , only a few expected that this will continue and expect only 1.5 percent for the third quarter according to the Atlanta F@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; interest increases in such a fragile economic backdrop could be ris@@ ky and question whether it &apos;s different this time , &quot; &quot; said Deutsche Bank . &quot;
&quot; market participants have made a interest in the F@@ ed all year round , and all eyes focused on the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee that ended on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; while many strateg@@ ists and econom@@ ists believe that the FO@@ MC could appro@@ ve an increase in this meeting , fut@@ ures trade only represents a 25 percent probability . &quot;
&quot; in our study , all elev@@ ations cycles from 1950 up to today have taken place in a super cycle with increasing momentum during the B@@ IP and pre @-@ rec@@ es@@ sion@@ ary heights are put down very quickly after the beginning of recovery in the shadows , &quot; says the report . &quot;
&quot; in contrast , this is a clearly slow recovery from what was the worst recession in the observed phase . &quot;
the current cycle is by far the longest which the F@@ ed has been waiting since the end of the last recession ; the record was 35 months and this has been 74 months so far .
&quot; firm income was also volati@@ le , as the market anticip@@ ates a interest rate , and the pattern is quite similar to the capital market . &quot;
the main difference is that the effect on bonds is faster than in shares if they change their strategic course .
bonds seem to change direction once the first increase / decrease in the cycle occurs .
&quot; at the end of the raising cycle , the loans run immediately , the Deutsche Bank said . &quot;
the strateg@@ ists of Charles Schw@@ ab believe that the rise in interest rates will lead to closer cooperation between longer and shorter bor@@ row@@ ings and lead to a fl@@ atten@@ ing of the curve .
&quot; high @-@ interest bonds often bring better income in such a climate , although &quot; we are still careful to expect higher yields , &quot; said Kath@@ y Jones , Fix@@ ed @-@ In@@ come @-@ Analy@@ stin at Schw@@ ab , in an analysis . &quot;
&quot; interest@@ ingly , Jones states that the markets have already adapted to F@@ ed Strategy expectations . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the strength of the dollar and the decline of inflation expectations , there are some indications that the market adapted to the prospect of stric@@ ter monetary policy , &quot; she wrote . &quot;
&quot; short @-@ term interest rates have risen , the yield curve is fl@@ atter , l@@ ending has expanded and volati@@ lity climb@@ ed - all the features of the market , when the F@@ ed intensi@@ fies its strategy . &quot;
&quot; in the large and whole , companies that handle the greater part of their business activity in the United States will benefit when interest rates rise and local products become more attractive . &quot;
&quot; multination@@ als with high debts are worse , as a rising dollar makes their products more expensive on the global market and the financing of their debt . &quot;
&quot; the story shows that &quot; &quot; quality &quot; &quot; shares tend to react very positively three months after an initial interest increase , &quot; Gold@@ man Sach@@ s analysts said in a report for the customers . &quot;
&quot; companies with a strong balance sheet have exceeded 5 percentage points in 1994 , 1999 and 2004 at an average rate of 5 percentage points . &quot;
companies with high capital ren@@ ders and low volati@@ lity with their shares also exceeded their counter@@ parts with low quality by an average of 4 ( percentage points ) and 3 ( percentage points ) .
debt will be a big problem .
&quot; companies with a high share of flexible interest rates will lose the most , said Gold@@ man . &quot;
&quot; outside the pure stock , consumers will also benefit from the growing Dollar . &quot;
&quot; savings could see gains through higher yields , even if experts in different opinion are how fast that will take place . &quot;
&quot; BBC Radio 3 is a copy of the Classic FM , says MEP Andrew B@@ ingham &quot;
the conservative member of the Parliament critic@@ ised the broad@@ c@@ aster because of his &quot; stup@@ idity &quot;
he ar@@ gues that he is not to be distinguished from commercial ri@@ vals .
he also quoted the BBC Music Awards and said they only im@@ it@@ ated The Br@@ its
Parliament @-@ colleague Dam@@ ien Coll@@ ins attacked The Voice The Voice and said that this was not very original .
&quot; BBC Radio 3 &quot; converts &quot; to Classic FM , asser@@ ts a leading Parliament member and raises new pressure on the station to prove that he does something that the private transm@@ itters will not do . &quot;
&quot; the Con@@ servative MP Andrew B@@ ingham also said the BBC @-@ bos@@ ses , that the public @-@ legal radio station &quot; dum@@ my &quot; and increasingly no longer distingu@@ ish@@ able from its commercial competitors . &quot;
&quot; radio 3 seems - I don &apos;t like to use the word &quot; &quot; sil@@ ly &quot; &quot; - but it seems to turn to Classic FM , &quot; he said . &quot;
he also quoted the BBC Music Awards that started last December .
&quot; the BBC Music Awards , launched last year , seem to be just under a different name . &quot;
&quot; so if you try to do something else - these are two spontaneous examples , where you actually only im@@ itate what is already on the market , &quot; said Mr B@@ ingham . &quot;
&quot; BBC Director General dismis@@ sed the alleg@@ ations and argu@@ ed that BBC Radio 3 is far ahead of its commercial competitors , when it comes to live music and educ@@ ating the public . &quot;
&quot; what I learn from Radio 3 , I &apos;m not going to learn about classical music anywhere else . &quot;
and there is a commitment to live music and playing music that is really uns@@ ur@@ passed .
&quot; and the engagement of Radio 3 , finding new music and giving up new works , I think is really important , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of this year , BBC Radio 3 Controller argu@@ ed that Alan Dav@@ ey argu@@ ed that he had to work harder to engage audiences as it did in the past because the British were less informed about classical music . &quot;
&quot; radio 3 , however , was not the only element in the BBC production , which during the hearing in the committee on the choice of culture , media and sport was under fire to kick off the commercial ri@@ vals . &quot;
the T@@ ory MP Dam@@ ien Coll@@ ins grab@@ bed The Voice - the BBC musical talent show purchased by the Dutch producer T@@ alp@@ a Media for an estimated cost of 22 million £ .
do you see why this program is often discussed because it is not original and not particularly striking ?
Lord Hall insist@@ ed that the BBC 1 show - with Pal@@ oma Faith and Boy George as judge - was produced in a special BBC mode .
&quot; he added that the company &quot; &quot; find a hit from our in @-@ house stable &quot; &quot; when the next time there was a series of entertainment . &quot;
&quot; however , he refused to exclude the order from further rows of The Voice in the future or to give money to the fee pay@@ ers for other entertainment formats . &quot;
net sales increased in August at the slow@@ est and Black Friday can be responsible for this
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; last month , there was the lowest result since the beginning of the records in 2000 . &quot;
online sales increased three years ago by using mobile phones for shopping
experts believe that Black Friday has slow@@ ed down spending in November
&quot; for over a decade , the virtual shopping has been bor@@ ed and many of Britain &apos;s main shopping streets have turned into ghost towns . &quot;
&quot; however , experts say that there are now signs that online sales stagn@@ ate after new figures show only seven percent in the first three months of 2015 . &quot;
total expenditure for August presented the lowest rise in growth since the beginning of the records in 2000 with only five percent increase compared to the previous year .
experts say that there are signs that online sales stagn@@ ate after new figures show only seven percent growth in the first three months of 2015
&quot; if you look at the growth rates for the previous years and go back to 2000 , it has always been developed over time , &quot; said Andy Mul@@ c@@ ah@@ y , publisher of the IM@@ RG sales index to the Guardian . &quot;
&quot; he explained that online sales increased three years ago , when buyers began to make purchases with their phones . &quot;
&quot; it meant that more people could buy online and that people could do it in different environments , for example at home on the sofa . &quot;
&quot; but now that is , and we may experience that growth is reduced . &quot;
the Black Friday phenomenon imported from America is cited as a reason for the subsequent sales .
&quot; experts believe that buyers will with@@ hold their purchases before this event , which takes place last Friday in November . &quot;
last year five times the average number of buyers around their computers to make their bar@@ gains and some dealer websites crashed .
&quot; experts believe that Black Friday , where the buyers fought for bar@@ gains , could keep buyers from making purchases . &quot;
a study by the British Retail Con@@ sortium found out that £ 5 £ have been issued a little more than £ 1 online .
&quot; for some products such as TV and washing machines , more than one third of purchases are now carried out via web shops . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , more than one quarter of men buy clothes and shoes online instead of the fashion chains in the inner cities . &quot;
Muslims bury the dead in Mec@@ ca at the crane accident - Bin Laden &apos;s family is sanc@@ tioned
the dead of 29 dead are carried by Muslims at the first funer@@ als in Mec@@ ca by the streets
Saudi Arabia dis@@ covers the collapse of some of the gigantic Sau@@ dian Bin Laden Group
the Ministry of Health said that a total of 394 people were injured after the crane rus@@ hed
hundreds of Muslims assembled themselves when 29 of the victims were carried through the streets to bury the slain that were killed when a crane was inj@@ ected to Mec@@ ca &apos;s grand@@ mo@@ sch@@ ee .
&quot; sad filled , largely dressed in white , the track to p@@ ollen its respect , when the first of the dead came to the Al @-@ Mo@@ ais@@ s@@ em cemetery . &quot;
&quot; the funer@@ al proc@@ ession passed on to the Holy Place , where only days before a building crane rus@@ hed through the ceiling of the mos@@ que and then onto the bed . &quot;
&quot; the cor@@ p@@ ses were released for bur@@ ial , when the Saudi King over the construction company of the Bin Laden chose a sanc@@ tion because of the catastrophe that also left 394 wounded . &quot;
&quot; the cor@@ p@@ ses of 29 owners killed , when a crane rus@@ hed through the Great Central Committee of Mec@@ ca , were carried through the streets . &quot;
&quot; among the dead , Q@@ asi@@ m Ak@@ ram came from Bol@@ ton , Greater Manchester , father of four children who was on his first pilgrimage , when the crane under@@ went down . &quot;
Mr Ak@@ ram was with his parents before the beginning of the annual H@@ add@@ sch in the Great Mos@@ que .
&quot; Saudi @-@ officials have already stated that H@@ add@@ sch will continue to Mek@@ ka , with thousands who continue to come to the city . &quot;
&quot; today King Sal@@ man , the Bin Laden Group would not have to ste@@ al the arm of the crane when he was not used . &quot;
&quot; an Arabic version of the decree , published by the state of Saudi Press Agency , said that the Bin Laden Group is responsible for the collapse . &quot;
&quot; the news agency &apos;s English @-@ language service did not report this detail , but said that the management of the company abroad is prohibited . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of this week Sal@@ man began to reveal what caused the fall of the crane , which crashed into a courtyard of the Grand @-@ mo@@ z@@ ee , where hundreds of thousands of Muslims began to gather in front of the H@@ add@@ sch , which later takes place this month . &quot;
&quot; the Bin Laden Group has not published any statements about the collapse of the crane , and its representatives were not at the disposal for a statement . &quot;
the Royal Dec@@ ree also attracted the group because of not current security measures and because they did not cooperate with meteor@@ ologists .
dozens of cranes surrounding Mec@@ ca &apos;s grand@@ mo@@ ch@@ ee as part of the massive building project managed by the Bin Laden Group .
the Bin Laden &apos;s family has been associated with the ruling family of Saudi Arabia for decades and takes over major construction projects .
&quot; the dec@@ eased leader of Al Q@@ aida , Os@@ ama bin Laden , was a rebel@@ li@@ ous son , who was dischar@@ ged from the family in the 1990 @-@ s . &quot;
&quot; the cr@@ ashing of the crane came amid strong winds and rain , just a few days before the arrival of millions in the Kingdom for the pilgrimage , which is necessary at least once in the life of every healthy Muslims . &quot;
officials said that 158 people stay in hospital .
&quot; government officials agreed that 1 million Ri@@ al ( £ 17@@ 4,000 ) to pay to the members of the killed and the same amount to permanently injured . &quot;
other injured will receive half of this amount .
B &amp; Q Boss says that the time of cheap Eastern European crafts@@ men is over
&quot; British increasingly deal with crafts@@ men , says Ver@@ oni@@ que Lau@@ ry &quot;
the number of qualified crafts@@ men from Eastern Europe has risen behind
&quot; this means that 200 additional Scre@@ w@@ fix stores , which are aimed at professional tra@@ des@@ men , will be opened &quot;
at the same time King@@ f@@ isher 60 B &amp; Q outlets close nation@@ wide
&quot; Ru@@ pert St@@ einer , City Chef @-@ correspon@@ dent of the Daily Mail &quot;
&quot; it is said that British sett@@ lers are laying down their h@@ amm@@ ers and brushes in favour of the use of qualified Eastern European crafts@@ men who carry out work in their homes , &quot;
&quot; if you can be sk@@ ill@@ fully with a hammer or a brush to paint walls , you seem to become a minority nowadays . &quot;
&quot; the British increasingly deal with crafts@@ men to carry out do @-@ it @-@ it jobs in their homes , such as the head of the company behind B &amp; Q . &quot;
&quot; V@@ é@@ ron@@ ique Lau@@ ry , new CEO of King@@ f@@ isher , who owns the Baum@@ gart@@ ner chain , said that a large increase in the number of qualified crafts@@ men from Eastern Europe , which offer services to low prices , is now over@@ hau@@ led . &quot;
&quot; therefore , King@@ f@@ isher plans to open 200 other scre@@ w@@ fix shops , which can set up to tra@@ des@@ people and close 60 sales outlets from B &amp; Q . &quot;
&quot; Mrs Lau@@ ry said she wants to employ more women in B &amp; Q shops , because eight out of ten purchase decisions in the shop are met by women . &quot;
at the moment the men out@@ weigh the men .
&quot; she said it was necessary to face growing demographic trends that show more female single households , which make more renov@@ ations than in the past . &quot;
&quot; Mrs Lau@@ ry said : &quot; &quot; there is still a majority of men in our branches . &quot;
we have to shift this more strongly towards a balance .
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
women play a major role in the decision @-@ making process .
&quot; Mrs Lau@@ ry , one of only five women at the head of a British in the FT@@ SE@@ 100 Index , has also re@@ structured her top team to reflect the same number of men and women in leadership positions . &quot;
&quot; King@@ f@@ isher is almost the only company that occup@@ ying exactly 50 percent of the team with women , including its management and financial performance . &quot;
&quot; Mrs Lau@@ ry said : &quot; &quot; this was a conscious decision - variety is an important issue here . &quot;
it was not difficult to find good women for our Supervisory Board .
King@@ f@@ isher reported a decline in half @-@ year profit and sales after the group was deb@@ ating the costs for closing the shops .
&quot; due to the trend , King@@ f@@ isher , the Scre@@ w@@ fix and B &amp; Q will open up to 200 new stores . &quot;
function@@ aries of A@@ ich / D@@ ob due to in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity in court
on Wednesday two officials of the Austrian Vol@@ leyball @-@ Vi@@ zem@@ ker A@@ ich / D@@ ob have to answer for in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity and disp@@ osi@@ tions .
the def@@ end@@ ants were not guilty .
one of them was also charged with abuse .
&quot; from this accus@@ ation , he was defini@@ tively acqu@@ itted in May . &quot;
the current process was postpon@@ ed .
&quot; according to the At@@ tor@@ ney General Robert Ri@@ ffel , in the preliminary examination , the def@@ end@@ ants in the years 2006 to 2011 were members of the association accounts of which they were allowed to operate in their functions , used for private purposes . &quot;
&quot; the damage is estimated at around 400@@ ,000 euros . &quot;
the sports officials are also indic@@ ted for financial reasons .
&quot; this fact was the chairman of the Sch@@ öff@@ en@@ sen@@ ate , judge Micha@@ ela San@@ in . &quot;
it shall be negoti@@ ated at a later date .
&quot; to repro@@ ach the in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity , the defence constituted the fact that the association was not at any time a part of an asset . &quot;
&quot; the sports officials have only charged expenses and the sports club , for whom they had worked from 1982 to 2011 , and in whom they invested a lot of time and money - the Pas@@ si@@ va amounted to approximately 600@@ ,000 sch@@ illing ( approx . 44@@ .000 Euro ) in 2001 . &quot;
&quot; at that time we were standing in front of the situation : do we carry the club further or block ourselves ? &quot; &quot; one of the def@@ end@@ ants told one of the accused , in the profession of major audi@@ tors of the financial officer . &quot;
he then decided to take this task with his colleague and co @-@ accused .
with all risks .
&quot; we have pushed money , laid down our life insurance as security at the bank , &quot; &quot; he said when it comes to arrest . &quot;
&quot; the association has been agreed : you can manage the money freely , it is not allowed to make any debts . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , in case of financial success , the payment of expenses was decided retro@@ actively until 1991 . &quot;
&quot; therefore , one part of the compensation damage was paid only years later , namely from 2003 , when a plus was on the account . &quot;
&quot; as a result , l@@ ump and non @-@ detailed bookings also seemed to be explained , the former president explained the proceedings . &quot;
&quot; the accounts and savings accounts managed by the two def@@ end@@ ants , said the second def@@ end@@ ant . &quot;
&quot; why the pay@@ outs were not disclosed in detail , the judge asked . &quot;
&quot; the association did not interest itself in detail for the financial bir@@ thing , but it is important only the freedom of debt , so the answer . &quot;
&quot; in 2011 , an amount of 120@@ .000 Euro was transferred to the club account in 2011 against one of the officials of official investigations . &quot;
&quot; that were set@@ backs , the def@@ end@@ ants declared . &quot;
this securities account ran on the name of the second def@@ end@@ ant and was not known according to the statement of the association .
&quot; why ? , &quot; the judge wanted to know . &quot;
the respon@@ dent did not answer for a long time .
&quot; then he said , he thought that this was the best for the club . &quot;
&quot; if something happened to him , nobody would have known anything of this money , the prosec@@ utor turned into the room . &quot;
&quot; the co @-@ accused was informed , the function@@ ary justi@@ fies himself . &quot;
this transfer was formulated as &quot; compensation . &quot;
&quot; why damage compensation ? , judge and prosec@@ utor wanted to know . &quot;
&quot; the first def@@ end@@ ant declared that he did not agree with this formulation , because the association never had any damage . &quot;
&quot; but what should I do if the lawyer says , &quot; &quot; With him you are all from the tailor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; am I a legal representative ? &quot; &quot; he asked . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , the function@@ ary said he never referred to a cent sal@@ ary , he only calcul@@ ates mil@@ eage and di@@ ets . &quot;
&quot; he charged EUR 1,000 per month to di@@ ets , but the actual effort was much higher , he added . &quot;
the def@@ end@@ ants were not able to submit accurate documents for the early years .
&quot; they were no longer kept up after an audit , in which everything had been judged correctly , they explained . &quot;
mil@@ eage was also related to the second def@@ end@@ ant .
&quot; all dwell@@ ings are in cash , in addition to having to go to the Bank to Blei@@ burg by his dom@@ ic@@ ile , he explained in his statement . &quot;
the main hearing is continued on 23 September with the inter@@ rog@@ ation of witnesses .
H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard sets another 30.000 jobs
&quot; in addition to the number of personnel mining that has been running for three years , the computer giant will reduce further jobs when spl@@ itting the company . &quot;
the rank@@ ings at the U.S. computer giant H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard ( HP ) do not end .
&quot; within the framework of its restructuring , the US technology group is planning the reduction of 25,000 to 30,000 jobs in its corporate customer division . &quot;
&quot; by doing so , costs amoun@@ ting to EUR 2.7 billion ( EUR 2.4 billion ) should be saved , the company announced on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; the step will lead to a special load of around 2.7 billion dollars , which will be incurred from the fourth quarter . &quot;
&quot; the workforce of 55@@ ,000 jobs has not yet been completed for three years . &quot;
&quot; HP employed around 30@@ 2,000 employees at the end of the financial year 2013 / 14 . &quot;
the H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard share provided 2.3 percent .
&quot; currently , the company &apos;s large @-@ scale corporation from the Califor@@ nian Pal@@ o Alto now spl@@ its into a new company - separate from the promising areas with computer servers and data storage for companies as well as other services . &quot;
both business units are to be listed on the stock market .
&quot; once again dis@@ ap@@ pointing PC he@@ el , as well as a weaker demand for corporate customers after its services , the world &apos;s second @-@ largest PC manufacturer was finally deployed to the world . &quot;
&quot; in the third quarter of the financial year at the end of July , sales of PC and printers declined by 11.@@ 5 percent . &quot;
sales fell by 8 percent to just under 25.@@ 4 billion dollars .
&quot; thus , revenues declined in 15 out of 16 quarters . &quot;
HP answers with a spl@@ itting and massive jobs on changes in the industry .
&quot; the 76 @-@ year @-@ old company under the leadership of Me@@ g Whit@@ man recently re@@ acted to the fact that customers are increasingly purchasing smartphones and tablets instead of conventional computers , and get more and more shops online . &quot;
&quot; all in all , Whit@@ man &apos;s restructuring plans have a total of around 5@@ 5,000 jobs . &quot;
conflicts : majority supports the anti @-@ IS training mission
&quot; however , a direct participation of German soldiers in combat operations in Iraq would be largely rejected : 54 percent said , on the other hand , 35 percent agreed . &quot;
the fact that other states fly air strikes against the IS in Iraq and Syria are 61 percent positive .
&quot; on the other hand , 24 percent are to interv@@ ene in the conflict . &quot;
&quot; in cooperation with Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad , 51 percent of respon@@ dents declined , 20 percent would be . &quot;
&quot; sorry , there is no translation for this news @-@ article . &quot;
car : second day of the day at the 66@@ th I@@ AA
&quot; as of September 27 , networked , self @-@ prop@@ elled cars and electro@@ mobility will be at the centre of the fair . &quot;
&quot; after two press days , German Chancellor Angela Merkel will officially open the 66@@ th International Motor Show under the slogan &quot; &quot; Connec@@ ting Mobility &quot; &quot; on Thursday . &quot;
the general public can visit the I@@ AA from Saturday .
&quot; like two years ago , the promot@@ ers of the V@@ DA car association expect some 900 thousand visitors . &quot;
R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke : assault on Serbian @-@ Hungarian border
the Hungarian police have deployed on the Serbian border near R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke Tr@@ än@@ gs@@ as and Wasser@@ werfer against several hundred refugees .
Eur@@ on@@ ews correspon@@ dent D@@ á@@ ni@@ el Bo@@ z@@ si@@ k has witnessed the outbreak of violence at the border control point .
he reported by phone :
a group of refugees broke through the border .
behind the police there was a police line and behind the police there was a water@@ shed .
&quot; 40 to 50 refugees began to throw stones , sticks , and plastic bottles to the officials . &quot;
the officials initially set a continuous pepper spray .
then the police used tear gas .
much tear gas was spra@@ yed towards the refugees .
thus the group was dissolved .
the refugees have now with@@ drawn some time .
a pregnant and apparently injured woman was removed from the zone .
&quot; children , who had breath@@ ed the tear gas , cried . &quot;
other refugees put together in themselves and suffered under breathing .
the press spokes@@ men of the Ser@@ b police also suffered injuries caused by the use of tear gas and pepper spray .
time of decision on interest rates for the US bank
&quot; the world is watching when the US central bank accounts for two days , on Wednesday and Thursday , to make the important decision whether for the first time for almost a decade the interest is raised or not . &quot;
&quot; a survey among 80 econom@@ ists surv@@ ey@@ ed by Reu@@ ters found out that a little more than half , the last week of opinion , was that the F@@ ed will continue to wait a little longer and interest rates at the current level of 0 - 0.25 percent will last . &quot;
it is a historical event because it has been seven years since the F@@ ed interest dropped to NU@@ LL .
&quot; for the first time , we approach a situation where a large central bank may leave the zero area and start a process of norm@@ alisation of interest rates , &quot; said Angel U@@ bi@@ des , leader at Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot;
&quot; the US economy is on a relatively good level of performance , tril@@ lion dollars are added to the balance sheet and generate only a low inflation . &quot;
&quot; however , the F@@ ed cannot ignore the less rocky outlook on global circumstances . &quot;
&quot; it has warned the markets to adjust to an increase , but the signs point out that chances are good against such a step . &quot;
the decision will be announced at 8 pm CET on Thursday
Todes@@ schüt@@ z at the Delta State University leaving school of debt
&quot; after shooting and killing his girl@@ friend in Miss@@ issi@@ ppi on Monday morning - and before he later shot his colleagues on Monday morning , Sh@@ ann@@ on Lamb wrote a note to say that &quot; &quot; I &apos;m sorry for the first murder and wanted he &quot; &quot; to make it happen , &quot; &quot; authorities announced on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; police in Gau@@ tier , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , said that Lamb , lec@@ turer for ge@@ ography and social scientific education at Delta State University , called the emergency number against 10 : 00 on Monday morning &quot;
&quot; and he said , he was shot on someone , and someone killed . &quot;
Lamb said to the staff of the emergency call centre that the police must send police officers to his home .
&quot; he said , &quot; &quot; I shot my wife yesterday evening &quot; &quot; and he also mentioned that a &quot; &quot; sweet dog &quot; &quot; is in the house , but nobody will distur@@ b anyone , but probably will be excited . &quot;
&quot; the police asked the c@@ aller after his name , but he did not give him . &quot;
Lamb gave no explanation for his shots .
&quot; when the police entered the scene , they found the body of A@@ my Pr@@ enti@@ ss , 41 , and a hand@@ written notice of Lamb , 45 who said : &quot; I &apos;m sorry I wanted , I could und@@ o it . &quot;
&quot; I loved A@@ my , and she is the only woman who ever loved me . &quot;
&quot; after writing the note Lamb drove 300 miles to the Delta State University , where he killed E@@ than Schmidt , a professor of history , before he finally took his own life on Monday evening when polic@@ emen circul@@ ated him . &quot;
&quot; University President William LA@@ FOR@@ GE said he didn &apos;t know anything about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs &apos;s idea . &quot;
&quot; despite reports on Monday the Lamb allegedly believed that Pr@@ enti@@ ss had a relationship with Schmidt , authorities said on Tuesday , there is &quot; no information , no evidence &quot; for a &quot; tri@@ angular relationship . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Pr@@ enti@@ ss was written by Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , who said she was married for about seven years as a &quot; good person . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the two were divor@@ ced 15 years ago , but remained friends . &quot;
&quot; O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said , he and Pr@@ enti@@ ss had a daughter who is 19 and she was &quot; &quot; destroyed &quot; &quot; at the ground . &quot;
he said that Pr@@ enti@@ ss were her daughter &quot; absolutely best friends . &quot;
&quot; Pr@@ enti@@ ss worked online from home , according to L@@ ins@@ day Know@@ les , who was identified by Sun Her@@ ald as a close friend of Pr@@ enti@@ ss . &quot;
&quot; Know@@ les said that Pr@@ enti@@ ss , who possessed a dog named Light@@ ning , met Lamb for about three years . &quot;
&quot; she always wanted to help other people , &quot; &quot; said Know@@ les &quot;
&quot; the police said , Lamb had called relatives at a certain point on Monday to tell them , &quot; &quot; He does not go into prison . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; when polic@@ emen caught him on Highway 1 near Green@@ ville later this night , Lamb drove his car to the side , fled by foot , ran into the forest and killed himself with a shot . &quot;
&quot; in spring 2015 , Lamb was awarded a doctoral degree from the Delta State University as his life law on the University &apos;s website . &quot;
stars who lost their lucky charm
&quot; the actor ( left ) , in the picture with his son Red@@ mond ( right ) , had some stres@@ s@@ ful years . &quot;
&quot; in 2001 he fought against leu@@ k@@ emia , and in 2009 he lost his long@@ standing partner , Far@@ rah F@@ aw@@ c@@ ett , because of cancer . &quot;
&quot; the actor also allegedly participated with drugs , and in 2008 he was sentenced for drug possession . &quot;
all this certainly demands his tribute .
Euro@@ wings : Lufthansa to build the Group
the Lufthansa plans a large group conversion .
&quot; sorry , this entry is only available in Deutsch . &quot;
&quot; 150 of the around 1,000 executives around the world will cost the workplace . &quot;
there is no new negotiations with the pil@@ oting trade union .
the Lufthansa is expanding its corporate structure and re@@ evalu@@ ates the Euro@@ wings .
&quot; the goal of the real@@ ignment is an earnings contribution of around 500 million euros a year from cost and proceeds syner@@ gies , the airline announced on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; among other things , in the future Lufthansa will no longer be responsible for the passenger business . &quot;
the Euro@@ wings cheap airline should be developed as independent as possible .
&quot; in the management team headed by Chief Carsten Sp@@ oh@@ r , Karl Ulrich Gar@@ n@@ adt will be responsible for Euro@@ wings in future . &quot;
&quot; with the new order , Sp@@ oh@@ r emphas@@ ises the importance of Euro@@ wings , with which the Group intends to compete against Ry@@ an@@ air and Easy@@ jet in the future . &quot;
&quot; up to now , the organization of the 120,000 staff was complex . &quot;
&quot; the airlines operate under the umbrella of the Passage Airline Group , which represents three quarters of the annual turnover of € 30 billion . &quot;
new negotiations with the pilots
&quot; in the collective conflict with the pilot &apos;s association Cock@@ pit ( VC ) , negotiations should be res@@ um@@ ed again after the court stopped . &quot;
this divided the union .
the topic of talks should be the retirement scheme for pilots .
&quot; in one year , cock@@ pit wanted to come with a predic@@ table record result as quickly as possible . &quot;
the conflict between union and airline has led to various strikes in recent months .
&quot; in addition to the transi@@ tional services of the pilots , the background is the &quot; Wings &quot; division . &quot;
&quot; it fores@@ ees , that Lufthansa in the fight against competi@@ tor routes is lag@@ ging over to the Group &apos;s own cheap line Euro@@ wings . &quot;

Luke Sha@@ w from Manchester United can &apos;t play for months due to double frac@@ ture
Luke Sha@@ w suffered a double fac@@ ture of his right leg at the Champions League defeat at PS@@ V Eind@@ hoven .
&quot; while this was the left foreign def@@ ender to cry and to exclude him from playing for at least six months , Louis van Ga@@ al does not hope that Sha@@ w can play back this season again . &quot;
the injury was caused by a ru@@ th@@ less attack by H@@ é@@ c@@ tor Mor@@ eno in the 15th minute after the 20 @-@ year @-@ old Sha@@ w was forced into the PS@@ V area .
he was treated for nine minutes on the field and needed oxygen before he was hospit@@ alized .
&quot; van Ga@@ al said : &quot; &quot; he has twice a t@@ inc@@ ture and is located in the hospital . &quot;
he will be moved tomorrow or maybe one day later and operated in Manchester .
&quot; it &apos;s horri@@ ble - a boy who comes with 18 to Manchester United , it &apos;s very hard and then plays fantastic , and then this happens . &quot;
in the locker room he had an oxygen mask .
he we@@ pt .
&quot; I am not a doctor , but if you have a double correction , then it takes six months , and it will not play in the group phase . &quot;
I hope he can play this season again .
Mor@@ eno seemed happy to be escaped with a Red Card and the hanging of an El@@ f@@ meters .
&quot; Nic@@ ola Ri@@ zz@@ oli , the refer@@ ee , did not pun@@ ish the Mex@@ ic@@ ans . &quot;
van Ga@@ al assumed that the Italian refer@@ ee had er@@ red .
you can judge for yourself if I say that an El@@ f@@ meter and a red card were due .
it was a very serious attack with both legs .
&quot; a twe@@ et to Sha@@ ws account was : &quot; &quot; I thank you all for your messages . words cannot describe how broken I am , my way to recovery starts now , I come stronger again . &quot;
related to this : Manchester United suff@@ ers the loss of Luke Sha@@ w at the defeat at PS@@ V
&quot; with the European Championship in France , the United Kingdom def@@ ender has an additional incen@@ tive to recover until the next June . &quot;
&quot; Phil@@ lip Co@@ c@@ u , the PS@@ V @-@ Trainer , said : &quot; it is a very bad injury . &quot;
&quot; when a player leaves the place with this type of injury , everyone is very sad about it . &quot;
it is never the intention of our players to hurt a opponent .
Mor@@ eno suffered a sur@@ ge when Mexico played against Van Ga@@ als the Netherlands team at the 2014 World Cup .
&quot; he is very difficult because it was not his intention to hurt the opponent , and if you hear that it &apos;s a very bad injury , that &apos;s not good , &quot; &quot; said Co@@ c@@ u . &quot;
for me it was not possible to see the moment .
&quot; the only thing I could see was the ball coming in a different direction , so it looked like he had touched him , but I couldn &apos;t see the attack on Luke . &quot;
&quot; in conversation with S@@ BS@@ 6 Mor@@ eno said : &quot; &quot; I know how it feels , I know how difficult it can be . &quot;
I feel very bad about it . I &apos;m so sorry .
the PS@@ V player Andr@@ és Gu@@ ard@@ ado was also taken to the hospital - after a f@@ oul@@ tery by Chris Sm@@ alling .
surely David Cameron doesn &apos;t know The Lor@@ ax better ?
&quot; it is one thing that all parents will soon learn : if your child loves a book , it will not take long until you get to know it almost . &quot;
unless you are David Cameron .
&quot; when he was asked by a provider of child care systems to name his favorite children &apos;s book , the premi@@ er for The Lor@@ ax , which was released in 1971 , decided by Dr. Se@@ uss . &quot;
&quot; it was a difficult choice , Cameron writes in a message on the website of Super@@ camps , and continues : &quot; funny , moving , creative and with a powerful message , it &apos;s a book I like to read my children because it always seems to have a picture or a message that we missed so far . &quot;
&quot; everything nice and good , except that the following paragraph , in which Cameron suppos@@ edly describes the story of the book , re@@ prints a content of the 2012 movie version that added new characters and details to extend the pretty short origin@@ ality text . &quot;
&quot; in the midst of the w@@ alled city of the need @-@ Ville where all nature has gone and even the air is a commodity , the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , the girl of his dreams , is hoping to see the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , the girl of his dreams , fulfilling her wish to see a real tree , but he died in 1991 , but completely unknown . &quot;
&quot; as if this was not yet susp@@ ect enough : the text presented by Cameron is partly like the summary of the Lor@@ ax movie presented on the website of Internet Movie Database , where everything is arti@@ fici@@ ally and even the air is a commodity , a boy named Ted hopes to win the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , the girl of his dreams . &quot;
&quot; although he adm@@ its to be a prag@@ matic father , it seems unlikely that Cameron is familiar with the story of the book . &quot;
&quot; most likely , such a relatively low PR task was deleg@@ ated to a hel@@ per who did not read The Lor@@ ax once a child in a row . &quot;
a down@@ ing street spokes@@ woman said that the text was probably come by Cameron &apos;s election @-@ circle office .
&quot; Super@@ Camp@@ s confirmed that the text was delivered by Cam@@ er@@ on &apos;s staff , but gave no further immediate comments . &quot;
&quot; Adam Ly@@ th was clearly threatened by the exclusion from England &apos;s team , but it is still difficult &quot;
&quot; to hit Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task , but if you see the cad@@ res that England has chosen for the tour , a re@@ petition of the 3 @-@ 0 test series defeat is not on my map . &quot;
I would not exclude a down@@ ward victory .
&quot; Al@@ ast@@ air C@@ ooks page may be less experienced than those three years ago , but there are good spin @-@ off@@ s in the batch list , and the community spirit is strong ; they won &apos;t wear sc@@ ars of 2012 , only a y@@ outh@@ ful positive attitude . &quot;
&quot; with the ball Mo@@ een Ali is developing as spin @-@ bow@@ ler and Adi@@ l Ras@@ hid , even if it is an unknown size at test level , is an option for the attack . &quot;
this news @-@ related news : Adam Ly@@ th comes out of the England Test @-@ K@@ ader and is replaced by Alex Hal@@ es .
&quot; the decision to release Adam Ly@@ th is , of course , difficult to analyze as his head coach in Yor@@ k@@ shire . &quot;
&quot; with his seven tests , there were two good attacks under difficult conditions , and the simple but hard reality is that cri@@ cket players are oriented to results . &quot;
&quot; there was no question mark at Joe R@@ oot , for example , and that led to the nom@@ ination , there - and I told this - players are their own best selection . &quot;
&quot; long ago one would have prolonged the course of ly@@ th , but he had control over his own fate . &quot;
&quot; if he hopefully turns out more purchases for Yor@@ k@@ shire , another chance will come . &quot;
&quot; the England @-@ Trainer Tre@@ vor Bay@@ l@@ iss praised his attitude , even if he did not get such good performances , and that doesn &apos;t surprise me ; he is mainly a team man . &quot;
the question of how much time a test stroke gets to set his mark is difficult .
&quot; Ly@@ th got seven chances - like Sam Rob@@ son before him , while Nick Comp@@ ton got nine . &quot;
only Comp@@ ton got the chance to play home and down@@ ward .
the only accus@@ ation that one can elev@@ ate was that England first introduced Jonathan Trot@@ t in the Caribbean - but this lost opportunity is now in the past .
Alex Hal@@ es comes in and he is a drummer whom I appreciate very much .
&quot; he is an X @-@ factor cri@@ cket player , what we saw at Yor@@ k@@ shire in this season when he achieved 236 against us on a Tr@@ ent Bridge place , which met us very much . &quot;
&quot; he must have at least the same chances as those before him , but this depends naturally on the team performance in the United Arab Emirates . &quot;
&quot; the idea to let mos@@ ques beat alongside Cook , which could provide an extra spin bow@@ ler and get four Qu@@ icks , de@@ af , and I have nothing against it . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t see why a drummer can &apos;t strike there , and this left @-@ h@@ ander has already shown that he is a vi@@ cious circle of cri@@ cket players . &quot;
&quot; mo@@ een might not have done his job for his County Wor@@ c@@ ester@@ shire , but he is a number 3 for them , and there is no big difference . &quot;
my earlier team @-@ mate Jus@@ tin Lan@@ ger played his first 38 tests at the first drop before he joined in 2001 as an op@@ ener .
he made three hundred ranks immediately and did not look back .
&quot; Z@@ af@@ ar Ans@@ ari comes in the cad@@ res as back @-@ up sp@@ inner , and in my limited handling with him he has impressed me as a young man . &quot;
&quot; people may see his statistics - on average 31 with the bat and 35 with the ball - and think it &apos;s a p@@ unt , but there is no big number of backup sp@@ inners that raise their hands and the trainers have chosen for youth . &quot;
he will learn a lot on this tour .
&quot; apart from the team , England made some clever additions to the trainer . &quot;
&quot; the appointment of Mah@@ ela Jay@@ awar@@ dene , the B@@ ats@@ man from Sri Lanka , as a consultant for the test games could be a master coup . &quot;
&quot; he is one of the nic@@ est guys of the game , who will bring a wealth of experience as he has played under all conditions and against all attacks . &quot;
Paul Coll@@ ing@@ wood comes for the white ball stage of the tour and brings energy and a powerful commitment to the setup .
&quot; I always felt he was created for the international cri@@ cket competition , as a player or as coach , and as Mah@@ ela he has insights from which we can benefit . &quot;
&quot; sometimes new voices can bring fresh wind in the locker room , even if the messages are in line with the previously said . &quot;
&quot; his team @-@ mate at Dur@@ ham , Ben St@@ okes , is not used by the One @-@ Day@@ ers , R@@ oot got a similar break against Australia and I have no problem for my part . &quot;
&quot; some will not agree , but coaches and team members do not determine the schedule . &quot;
and you must remember that as with players their jobs depend on the results .
such decisions are not made easy in heart .
the Bre@@ x@@ it camp ( Bre@@ x@@ it = exit of Britain from the EU ) could gain access if the economy gets into a trap by 2017
&quot; David Cameron &apos;s unexpected new action strategy to keep Britain in the EU is getting deeper into trouble with every day , even without the choice of the ingen@@ ious Jerem@@ y &quot; &quot; Is it Yes or No ? &quot; &quot; Cor@@ by@@ n to the Leader of Labour or the TU@@ C , which broke out on Tuesday because of Europe on Tuesday . &quot;
foreigners also have their own Cor@@ by@@ ns and Ni@@ gel Far@@ ages .
&quot; a European diplom@@ at fre@@ ed recently that some member states , so deeply involved in various crises , as the EU is now and not always from own gu@@ ilt , UK itself created agenda with split allow@@ ances and dis@@ rup@@ tive treaty changes that they usually do not want . &quot;
&quot; in Bri@@ gh@@ ton , the TU@@ C decided at its annual meeting that it does not like it if they je@@ op@@ ardi@@ ze social protection . &quot;
we could also call it Dave and Georges Sel@@ f@@ ie &apos;s agenda .
&quot; Prime Minister and Finance Minister climb on summit meetings or bilateral meetings in foreign capitals , make a photo of themselves in front of a famous local monument , with or without local sizes , come home and say they win allies for reforms . &quot;
it &apos;s always about me .
&quot; my European friend who wishes to look outside Britain outside the EU tent - &quot; &quot; Let &apos;s not alone with France , &quot; &quot; says Berlin - and lets say that more and more short @-@ si@@ ghted ministers and officials have come to the point where it doesn &apos;t matter whether we remain or go . &quot;
&quot; German car@@ chan@@ cell@@ or Angela Merkel is an ally , but she has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave office before it looks bad for them , as in the exagger@@ ated long wa@@ vers like th@@ at@@ cher ( 11 years ) , Mit@@ terr@@ and ( 14 ) and K@@ ohl ( 16 ) . &quot;
French François Hollande can look back on his re @-@ election or his replacement in 2017 .
he is also a verbal power .
&quot; Poland may soon have a nation@@ alist right government , Spain a left . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s hard to imagine that they will get a leg to help the Sel@@ f@@ ie British , whose energy should be used to prevent Scotland &apos;s leaving from the UK - something they don &apos;t want , because most similar separ@@ ati@@ st tendencies have . &quot;
&quot; therefore , some such ministers may even deliberately not plan any helpful comments , quite in the SN@@ P style , while Britain &apos;s referendum campaign 2017 to speed up the Bre@@ x@@ it process , presum@@ ably my friend . &quot;
&quot; the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation was a p@@ ity , &quot; and &quot; Britain has won &apos;t any value from the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; Europeans know how pre@@ dat@@ ory the Fle@@ et Street can be at its cost and which EU scep@@ tics were the oli@@ gar@@ chy of press one , as it was not supported by Tony Ben@@ n in 1975 , which supported our entrance 1973 with a ratio of 2 : 1 . &quot;
&quot; you can remember Boris Johnson , the Er@@ z Euro opportun@@ ists , who made a name as an &quot; EU straight ban@@ ana &quot; Brussels correspon@@ dent in the early 90 @-@ s . &quot;
with all his mad@@ ness Ed Mili@@ band knew who were his enemies .
&quot; this included the Med@@ ley of tax @-@ fear@@ ing vill@@ ains , telephone @-@ threatening foreigners and the pseu@@ do non @-@ nation@@ als who have most of our major newspapers . &quot;
&quot; actually Tony Bl@@ air thought much about her , but noticed that if you sit with a hot gor@@ illa in a cage , you better spread ban@@ anas to di@@ stract him instead of having lunch and dinner . &quot;
&quot; in fact , Mili@@ band was more Bl@@ ai@@ ri@@ ans than Bl@@ air himself when he opposed to Cameron &apos;s referendum , because Bl@@ air had rejected the principle of the non @-@ adopted constitution of the EU , which was then rejected by French and Dutch vot@@ ers in 2005 , which opened up a door to him . &quot;
the press has never rejected him .
&quot; but the nice Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n , who gave me a friendly tap on the back on Monday in Westminster - I told him that he had no time to waste time for me - seems at risk , N@@ eil Kin@@ no@@ cks Boy@@ cot@@ t Mur@@ doch &apos;s strategy of the 80 @-@ s years to repeat , a mistake back then and today . &quot;
&quot; it may take , but he must develop a coher@@ ent strategy to win the media , not with me , but certainly with Andrew Mar@@ r , whose BBC sofa he left on Sunday . &quot;
Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s official position in Europe - I express it very friendly - in development .
he says that we should remain in a re@@ formed EU .
&quot; well , most people outside of U@@ ki@@ ps traditional blue @-@ grain tendency and the wild ones of Tor@@ ys Klein @-@ Engl@@ ish@@ eries can say yes to everyone . &quot;
&quot; it is what Hil@@ ary &quot; &quot; A Ben@@ n , but no Benn@@ ite &quot; &quot; on the radio and television this week said when the boy@@ sc@@ outs fought in him , not admit that Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s appointment of the provo@@ king John Mc@@ Don@@ nell was a bad idea . &quot;
&quot; it reminded me of the 70s , when his old father tried to be il@@ loyal to his Labour Cab@@ inet colleagues , without going too far and losing his cabinet job . &quot;
Hil@@ ar@@ dy &apos;s fight was even more attractive .
&quot; but to fight to &quot; &quot; remain &quot; &quot; in all circumstances - Benn@@ s expression - was not what Mc@@ Don@@ nell said , what J@@ C told his comrades and de@@ pu@@ ties after all reports on their conference day on Monday evening . &quot;
&quot; whatever the ag@@ it@@ ous bottom @-@ up image of Cor@@ by@@ n wants to convey - remember that he even touched me - News discipline remains important in the age of TV around the clock and above all in the vor@@ tex of social media , a breeding site of par@@ ano@@ ia and betra@@ yal . &quot;
&quot; it is right to give Cameron no free ticket for Europe , which allows him to keep Lab@@ ours support in the referendum campaign for a matter of course , as Mc@@ Don@@ nell said . &quot;
Simon J@@ enk@@ ins certainly thinks .
&quot; but Mc@@ Don@@ nell and Cor@@ by@@ ns fundamental ambig@@ u@@ ities at EU membership - in line with their Benn@@ ite Siege Economy , their anti @-@ capitalist past - is no longer just a question of es@@ ot@@ eric discussion among left dissi@@ dents , for which the nar@@ cis@@ s@@ ism of small difference is a central principle of dog@@ matic differences . &quot;
&quot; as with his ambig@@ u@@ ities at N@@ ato - Tom Wat@@ son , fel@@ sen@@ fest is convinced that J@@ C will not start a campaign - foreign diplom@@ ats will be required to try to find a sense of their superi@@ ors at home . &quot;
why should Paris or Berlin apply political capital - they also have mis@@ guided vot@@ ers - to make conc@@ essions to the British if all this can be meaning@@ less ?
&quot; the US is already quite disappointed by the weak military performance in Iraq , Libya and Syria , even with a cost reduction of the T@@ ory government in power , which I was reminded on the start of Monday , what British Influ@@ ence Security Forum was called . &quot;
experts critic@@ ise public health report on e @-@ cigar@@ ettes
&quot; claims of a state @-@ funded agency that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are less harmful than smoking originated from a meeting of 12 people , partly with links to tobacco industry , said researchers . &quot;
&quot; experts who write in the British Medical Journal ( BM@@ J ) , Lanc@@ et joined by cri@@ tici@@ zing the evidence used by Public Health England ( P@@ he ) in their report on e @-@ cigar@@ ettes . &quot;
he published the &quot; Basic Code &quot; last month and describes it as a &quot; comprehensive review of evidence . &quot;
but some researchers have ques@@ tioned the load capacity of the data and pointed to the connections between some experts and the tobacco industry .
a leading article in the medical journal of Lanc@@ et last month attacked the &quot; extra@@ ordin@@ arily wind@@ y foundation &quot; on which he founded his most important conclusion .
two other researchers write in BM@@ J and asked if the claims are based on stone or sand .
&quot; Martin Mc@@ K@@ ee , Professor of European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Trop@@ ical Medicine and Simon Cap@@ e@@ well , Professor of Clinical Epidemiology at the University of Liverpool , said : &quot; a fundamental principle of public health is that strategies should be based on the evidence of effectiveness . &quot;
&quot; they said that the public expects that &quot; &quot; the current best estimate is that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are about 95 % less harmful than smoking &quot; based on a detailed review of evidence and modelling . &quot;
&quot; in fact , this statement comes from a single session of 12 people who were conven@@ ed to develop a model for multiple criteria decision analysis ( Multi @-@ C@@ rit@@ eria Decision Analysis - MC@@ DA ) in order to demonstrate their opinions on the damage of various ni@@ cot@@ ine @-@ containing products to a synthesis ; the results of the meeting were summar@@ ised in a research report . &quot;
&quot; Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that a Sponsor of the meeting was a company called Euro@@ Swiss Health , whose managing directors had previously been awarded by British American Tob@@ acco Medium ( BA@@ T ) for an independent study . &quot;
&quot; he also signed the BA@@ T references to public health in a sustainability report , they said . &quot;
&quot; one of the 12 participants at the meeting explained to receive funds from an e @-@ cigar@@ ette manufacturer , but not the funding he was supposed to have received by the tobacco company Philip Morris International . &quot;
&quot; the reasons for selecting the members of the committee are not delivered , but there are several known e @-@ cigar@@ ettes champ@@ ions , some of which also include a sector financing in the paper . &quot;
some other participants at this meeting are not known for their know @-@ how in tobacco control .
the meeting also attended the Tob@@ acco management of P@@ he .
&quot; the group &apos;s research work signi@@ fies that there is a lack of &quot; hard evidence for the damage of most products in most of the criteria , &quot; wrote Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well . &quot;
&quot; however , none of these links or limitations will be discussed in the P@@ he report . &quot;
&quot; Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that &quot; &quot; there has been no evidence that there has been no evidence that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes serve as a way to smoking for children or non @-@ smo@@ kers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Pro@@ f Kevin F@@ ent@@ on , Director of Health and Wellness at P@@ he said that BM@@ J &apos;s claims had already been re@@ acted before . &quot;
he said : &quot; e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are essentially less harmful than smoking . &quot;
every second life @-@ long smo@@ ker dies at his ad@@ diction .
&quot; all evidence suggests that the health risks of e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are low compared to that , but that we continue to study long @-@ term effects . &quot;
&quot; he has the clear obligation to inform the public about what evidence proves and what is not , especially if there is so much public confusion about relative danger compared to tobacco . &quot;
&quot; nearly 8@@ 0,000 people annually die from a disease with respect to smoking , and smoking costs the National Health system two billion pounds per year . &quot;
&quot; by clear evidence of current evidence that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are not without risk , but only a fraction of damage caused by smoking , we fulfill our national jurisdiction . &quot;
&quot; BBC should give up East@@ En@@ ders , says former head of Channel 4 &quot;
&quot; the former Chairman of Channel 4 , Luke Johnson , said the BBC should stop sending programs like East@@ er@@ ders and The Voice . he said that commercial ri@@ vals would give &quot; their right arm &quot; for hit shows like the Albert Square So@@ ap . &quot;
&quot; Johnson said that the broadcasting fee should be used only to make the type of programs sent , which are not sent by other UK transm@@ itters . &quot;
&quot; he cri@@ tici@@ zed the BBC to place publicly @-@ legal programs , which are likely to be seen by a smaller audience , in hard @-@ controversial time @-@ windows against the most popular shows of their ri@@ vals and broad@@ cast@@ ers like BB@@ C4 . &quot;
&quot; after the BBC Director General , Tony Hall , said that the company wanted to do more in partnership with other organizations , Johnson said he tried to get in touch with the BBC for six years at Channel 4 without success . &quot;
&quot; I have problems with the idea that BBC programs are commissioned or sent , which would also clearly be shown by non @-@ subsidi@@ zed ri@@ vals , &quot; said Johnson the senior communications committee as part of his investigation on the future of the BBC . &quot;
&quot; if you would like to keep the radio fee , which I don &apos;t want to consider medi@@ um@@ - or long @-@ term for a good idea , you should at least put his production on programs that others do not do or put on commission . &quot;
they send The Voice in a first @-@ class time window because they want to achieve as wide support for their future .
&quot; the idea that nobody else would show this is a joke , it &apos;s ridi@@ cul@@ ous , it &apos;s non@@ sense . &quot;
&quot; Johnson said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t see why a reg@@ res@@ sive tax is funded , which could also be financed without subsidies . &quot;
&quot; the Voice is such a program , East@@ En@@ ders is another , ad@@ mitt@@ edly both own productions . &quot;
&quot; frank@@ ly , other channels would give their right arm for it . &quot;
I have to see how this should be public @-@ lawful television .
I don &apos;t think that this would reduce the BBC at all .
&quot; Johnson , an entrepren@@ eur for series , led channel 4 from 2004 to 2010 said that the BBC was guilty on the hunt for reviews , because of the ambi@@ tions of the people who work there , and because they believe this is the best way to secure long @-@ term support . &quot;
&quot; his comments on BBC &apos;s most popular broad@@ casts will show what the former conductor of Sky , Tony Ball , presented in his Mac@@ Tag@@ gart presentation in Edinburgh in 2003 that BBC shows like East@@ er@@ ders should sell . &quot;
&quot; Johnson said that the rather public @-@ law N@@ ic programs should go to BB@@ C4 , where you can &apos;t measure the audience , but they can argue , if they have created their seem@@ ing sacred missions for justi@@ fication of $ 4 billion , &quot; Well , of course , we have created all these obsc@@ ure programs that nobody has seen . &quot;
they put them in a time window in which no one ever wanted to see them .
&quot; Johnson said to the committee : &quot; &quot; I urge you to find a rather reg@@ res@@ sive system in terms of conditions , who can get the best value here . &quot;
&quot; of course , you all think that one gets a great value for 150 £ a year , but for people who are a lot of money for £ 150 , ask me if this is true , because they don &apos;t consume much of the BBC . &quot;
&quot; the former Sky@@ - and Channel 5 boss David El@@ stein who also said before the committee on Tuesday urged the BBC to check their Rei@@ th@@ ian mission to &quot; &quot; educ@@ ate , educ@@ ate and enter@@ tain . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; he said , only little of BBC production would now officially be classified as education - he said that it was 1 % of their TV production and 0.1 % on the radio - and she should take an example of this in &quot; &quot; informed , clari@@ fying and enter@@ tained &quot; &quot; to public television channels in Australia and Canada . &quot;
&quot; the question of partnerships said El@@ stein , the BBC should do more in areas like that of the Pro@@ ms , from which he said that only a hand@@ ful on TV is shown , and with the commercial Sen@@ dern Alli@@ ances to make everything available online . &quot;
&apos;@@ Son@@ o@@ gene@@ tics &apos; can control brain cells by sound waves
the video shows how the n@@ em@@ ato@@ des change the direction in the moment they are ir@@ radi@@ ated with sound impulses .
scientists have bred saus@@ ages with gene@@ tically modified nervous systems that can be controlled by out@@ breaks of sound waves .
the tiny n@@ em@@ ato@@ des change the direction in the moment when they have sound impulses which have high frequencies for the human ear to be heard .
the pul@@ ses work by switching mot@@ on@@ eur@@ one cells which are gene@@ tically modified to carry the di@@ aphr@@ ag@@ m channels that respond to ultr@@ asonic waves .
further on this topic : researchers read and write brain activity with light
&quot; researchers said that wor@@ ms showed the power of a new method called Son@@ o@@ gene@@ tics where ultras@@ ound can be used to activate a number of brain , heart and muscle cells outside the body . &quot;
&quot; S@@ re@@ ek@@ an@@ th Chal@@ as@@ ani , researcher at the Sal@@ k Institute in La J@@ oll@@ a , California , said the Guardian that the process of one day could replace the depth of brain stimulation , a invasive procedure that sheds electric impulses in the brain of people to treat the symptoms of Park@@ inson &apos;s disease . &quot;
&quot; thread@@ wor@@ ms usually do not react to ultras@@ ound , but Chal@@ as@@ ani noted that they did when they were surrounded by a liquid containing micro@@ sc@@ opic bub@@ bles . &quot;
&quot; the bub@@ bles , he found out , rein@@ force the ultras@@ ound waves , which then penet@@ rate into the wor@@ ms . &quot;
&quot; the ampli@@ fied ultras@@ ound waves function on structures , called TR@@ P @-@ 4 ion@@ ic channels and found in the membran@@ es of some of the wor@@ ms . &quot;
the sound waves cause the opening of these icons and activate the cells they are assigned to such a report Nature Communications .
&quot; to create ultr@@ asonic @-@ controlled n@@ em@@ ato@@ des , chal@@ as@@ ani gene@@ tically modified the wor@@ ms so that some of their Mot@@ on@@ eur@@ one TR@@ P @-@ 4 ion@@ ic channels carry . &quot;
&quot; when using ultras@@ ound to the changed creatures , the sound waves are ampli@@ fied by the micro@@ bes and transferred to the wor@@ ms where they turn on the changed mot@@ on@@ eur@@ one . &quot;
&quot; the process has some simil@@ arities with Op@@ to@@ gene@@ tics , a ground@@ breaking tool that allows scientists to turn on and off neur@@ ons with impulses of the light . &quot;
but Chal@@ as@@ ani said that Son@@ o@@ gene@@ tics might have some advantages over this technique .
&quot; in contrast to light that must be sent down on an optical fiber to the desired position in the brain , kidney @-@ frequency ultras@@ ound waves can happen un@@ hin@@ dered and can thus be sent to the brain from above on the skull . &quot;
&quot; we believe that with gene therapy and a therapeutic virus it is possible to temporarily make the targeted human neur@@ ons vulnerable to the ultras@@ ound signal in a clinical setting for certain neurolog@@ ical treatments , &quot; said Chal@@ as@@ ani . &quot;
&quot; other applications could focus on muscle cells and insulin @-@ producing cells , he added . &quot;

many artists engage with activists in protest movements to work and notice that they have to go outside into the real world so that their art has an impact on society .
another of the anti @-@ arms trade posters greeted the commu@@ ters in the subway .
&quot; the Am@@ ne@@ sty video was viewed more than 100,000 times in 24 hours via Facebook and was created by the V@@ C@@ CP advertising agency that works with the graphic artist and Vo@@ ic@@ e@@ Over artist , who also works for free . &quot;
&quot; V@@ C@@ CP creative director Matt L@@ ever was amazed at the silence , which ruled around the advertising for the arms fair - through a void of the Ex@@ Ce@@ L calendar - and thought , &quot; &quot; We give them the campaign they try to avoid . &quot;
&quot; they played with the invention of a more realistic sket@@ chy good@@ will advertising , but &quot; through the da@@ zz@@ ling with bright colours and animation , it remains stronger . &quot;
&quot; they did a fantastic job by helping us to raise awareness of the sale of illegal torture devices at the fair , &quot; says Tom Davi@@ es of Am@@ ne@@ sty . &quot;
what we need now is a step @-@ by @-@ step of the British government and the guarantee that torture devices will not be tra@@ ded illeg@@ ally in front of our door@@ step .

eight Golden Rules for Life in student residence halls
&quot; eleven years ago , I moved into a student residence as a self @-@ for@@ get@@ ed 19 @-@ year @-@ old , still in faith in Ber@@ ets and moral rel@@ ati@@ vis@@ m , but only now I remember the ten@@ se sm@@ iles of those I have anno@@ yed - and to the numerous , long @-@ armed complaints about others . &quot;
most of what I have learned can be distill@@ ed into eight simple rules .
the entry in student residen@@ ces ranges from slightly nerve @-@ write to absolutely horri@@ fying .
&quot; it is temp@@ ting to mu@@ zzle : people tell where you come from , if and where you have taken the Sabbath year , where you stand with regards to Cor@@ by@@ n and why you don &apos;t love to hate Mar@@ m@@ ite , because in earn@@ est , guys , it &apos;s just a yeast extract h@@ ah@@ aha , I am in my room . &quot;
breathe through .
help others to do the same - ask questions and show interest .
&quot; it direc@@ ts the conversation and helps you to find out the people you like , unlike those with whom you wouldn &apos;t talk , even if your lashes were burning in fire and these fire extingu@@ ishers would be . &quot;
let people .
&quot; people often turn into drinks recipes , movie nights venues and communal meeting points , but they are also the places where people attract and their under@@ wear . &quot;
related to this : do not think about starting the university with a relationship
intro@@ ver@@ ted receive a rough treatment at the university .
&quot; your room should be a refuge , but many student residen@@ ces form a space @-@ to @-@ room bum@@ ble@@ bee culture that is friendly and socially and can lead to life @-@ long friendship . &quot;
this can be hell for someone trying to recover .
&quot; nothing in the culture allows you to say : &quot; &quot; I like you , and I want our friendship to continue , but you have to go away so that I get the energy I consumed for interaction with you . &quot;
try to sense when a milit@@ ant is exhausted from con@@ vi@@ vi@@ ality - and send him an SMS instead of kno@@ cking .
apro@@ pos anch@@ oring : do it .
a guy in my student residen@@ ces had the idea that a non @-@ closed door had an invitation .
he saw some things .
friendship close by baking .
&quot; as you begin the Uni at the peak of Back Man@@ ia , the kno@@ cking on the doors of people to imagine wearing a plate full of brow@@ ni@@ es is less strange than the welcome of the 1950 &apos;s &quot; welcome in the neighborhood , I have something to bake . so , and now please smile when I ask you some personal questions . &quot;
offering home @-@ made goo@@ dies is a good way to close friends .
your room@@ mates feel oblig@@ ated to enter@@ tain themselves and will eventually associate your face with a delicious surprise .
&quot; of course , this depends on whether you are a decent bakery . &quot;
&quot; bad bl@@ ended lum@@ ps of flour , sugar and fat lead to people sleeping when you kno@@ ck . &quot;
ste@@ al food is a common crime in student residen@@ ces .
&quot; of course , the c@@ law of chicken is a theft , but is it taking a drop of a drop of milk for your tea too ? &quot;
please check with the milk owner .
&quot; chances are good that they say to serve themselves , even when they cook in the interior . &quot;
&quot; if someone ste@@ als your stuff , it &apos;s anno@@ ying and you have my compassion -- but try to deal with it as my ro@@ ommate , which added a pur@@ ge to her milk to pun@@ ish thi@@ eves . &quot;
she is now in prison .
you should not make any noise that keeps people from sleep or work .
&quot; it is not just about being a decent person , but that you belong in the tru@@ est sense of the saying to the people sitting in the glass house . &quot;
&quot; a girl on my cor@@ ridor asked her neighbours if it makes them something to make drums and bass a bit qui@@ eter , because it was three o &apos;clock in the morning and she had a test in the morning . &quot;
they responded with even more loud music .
&quot; when she finally stopped at 5 o &apos;clock , she kindly asked her neighb@@ ors to sleep two hours before she left her own music , shut her door and went to her three hour test . &quot;
wouldn &apos;t it be romantic if your future spouse would acci@@ dentally move into the same residence residence ?
&quot; conver@@ sely , it would not be deeply embarrass@@ ed if you hold a ro@@ ommate for your future spouse to dis@@ connect and see them every day , and perhaps experience how they pass all common friends to yourself ? &quot;
&quot; of course , the heart goes his own way - but if a hot ro@@ ommate definitely isn &apos;t your future spouse , try at least to talk to your abdom@@ en a little reason . &quot;
&quot; in the exciting moment you notice that someone has his keys in his un@@ locked room , the border is between an Ul@@ k and mo@@ b@@ bing fin@@ er than it seems . &quot;
&quot; a good stick is funny , but it only takes moments until it becomes a bo@@ omer@@ ang . &quot;
tell by hiding a valuable and am@@ using lesson about security - but never di@@ gest someone &apos;s room with tooth@@ paste and sh@@ ampoo .
close your door and place your keys into a glass of water that you then put into the freezer - but don &apos;t t@@ ack your bel@@ ong@@ ings on the ceiling more than twice .
&quot; town@@ houses for refugees , stone @-@ pulling , Ger@@ ing@@ ver@@ dien@@ er &quot;
the real estate entrepren@@ eur Markus Gil@@ dner relies on semi @-@ Fran@@ con@@ ian Eck@@ ental terrac@@ ed houses for people who do not have much money .
&quot; thus , for example , for refugees - but also as a signal : &quot; not only refugees need the living space , but also the mother and the Ger@@ ing@@ ver@@ dien@@ er alone . &quot;
&quot; I show how to build cheap and well @-@ priced today , &quot; says the 44 year old in an interview . &quot;
thousands of refugees will push for the housing market .
the entrepren@@ eur Markus Gil@@ dner believes to know how fast a cheap living space can be created : he builds town@@ houses for refugees in a project .
&quot; Mr. Gil@@ dner , many refugees will push for the housing market . &quot;
which solution do you offer ?
Markus Gil@@ dner : the mass accommodation in containers or gymn@@ as@@ tics has no sustainability .
for people stay in a large part here .
&quot; in the face of the flow of refugees , we need enough living space in the coming decades . &quot;
&quot; a very ban@@ al , three @-@ storey semi @-@ detached house is the solution . &quot;
Gil@@ dner : a town@@ house takes the least place .
it makes integration easier .
this is different if people are accommod@@ ated in blocks of cam@@ pers .
each of the six houses built in the pilot project consists of three residential units for four asylum seek@@ ers each .
&quot; each unit has two bedrooms , a bathroom , a kitchen and a lounge . &quot;
&quot; it may be that many refugees will say it is again peace , I go back . &quot;
then the houses can be adapted easily according to the individual needs .
how high are the costs ?
&quot; Gil@@ dner : the price for 160 square meters of living space per house is 184 000 Euro , without land . &quot;
this is man@@ age@@ able .
the construction took six months .
this is appropriate .
have the building regulations complicated their plans ?
&quot; Gil@@ lian : I have correctly drawn up my project . &quot; &quot; &quot;
especially complicated makes it always the threatening dop@@ ing value of special construction and the job placement regulation .
gr@@ us@@ el@@ ig .
&quot; it is still under@@ lined , who creates three apartments in a row house , needs at least three pitches . &quot;
there is no room for this in the cities .
and refugees and asylum seek@@ ers have no cars .
how did the residents respond to their town@@ house project ?
&quot; Gil@@ lian : there were those who have accused me of creating luxury buildings for asylum seek@@ ers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
what definitely isn &apos;t right .
but do you not tigh@@ ten the competition for affordable housing ?
&quot; Gil@@ lian : true is true : in the last five years we had a construction boom in Germany , but built in luxury flats that can hardly afford any more . &quot;
&quot; my project has the message , even the normal people need living space . &quot;
&quot; not only refugees , but also the alone educ@@ ating mother or the Ger@@ ing@@ ver@@ dien@@ er . &quot;
I &apos;ll show how you can still build cheap and well @-@ priced today .
that &apos;s how it works .

&quot; the new operating system can be requested by going to the sett@@ ing@@ App , click &quot; General &quot; and then select &quot; Software Update . &quot; &quot;
&quot; if it is ready , the phone gives you the option to download and then install . &quot;
&quot; some have encountered problems after the installation , as they get an error message telling that the &quot; &quot; software update failed &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; to circum@@ vent the problem , users are recommended to either wait until the rush returns or trying to update via iTunes . &quot;
the phone itself guides you through the rest of the process .
&quot; this may mean dele@@ tion of apps to create space - but Apple has made it more unlikely to do so , when you use a special tool to delete apps and then re@@ install them as soon as the process is completed . &quot;
&quot; it is worthwhile to make sure that your mobile phone is charged while updating or located near a charger , so that the battery is charged . &quot;
&quot; if the load is too low , Apple does not allow the update to continue , as the phone may turn off half@@ way and lead to a crash of the update . &quot;

&quot; you should also make sure that you &apos;ve seen our chec@@ kl@@ ist of all things before your download to prevent things going wrong and protect yourself if they do it . iOS 9 brings new features , including a much wis@@ er personal assistant and enormous new productivity features for the iPad , as well as changes that speed up and repair the operating system . &quot;
Ros@@ enberg &apos;s only slogan : full attack
N@@ ico Ros@@ berg knows in the fight for the World Cup title in Formula 1 against his clearly leading Mercedes team@@ mates Lewis Hamilton than a motto : &quot; full attack . &quot;
&quot; before the start in the decisive seven overseas races , the World Cup 2nd stressed that I have nothing to lose . &quot;
53 points separate the Vice World Champion before the second race in Singapore on this Sunday of title def@@ enders and two @-@ fold @-@ champion Hamilton .
&quot; the Br@@ ite won seven of the previous twelve races of the season , taking the Fl@@ ut@@ licht @-@ Grand @-@ Prix as a favorite in the city state . &quot;
&quot; in 2009 and last year , the 30 year old Br@@ ite was able to win the race . &quot;
whether the current smo@@ g in the city @-@ state will influence the Great Prize of Singapore is still uncle@@ ar .
&quot; for days , a glo@@ am bell hangs over the city , triggered by fires on the neighboring island of Sum@@ atra . &quot;

&quot; the new member is the entrepren@@ eur Paul G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann , a passionate chess and tennis player who stopped over 40 times in Bad Kis@@ singen . &quot;

the chess club in Bad Kis@@ singen has supported G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann with a donation that President Alfred Klein received .
&quot; thus , it is possible to record chess players who cannot raise the membership fee . &quot;
youth work and talent search will also be promoted .

Qu@@ arti@@ ers@@ Agency seeks direct contact
Sal@@ u@@ dis and the geri@@ atric center Anton@@ isti@@ ft have joined together under the Co@@ at of the Social Foundation and opened a new stop at Graf @-@ St@@ auff@@ enberg .
&quot; in addition to consult@@ ations , you can also participate in courses . &quot;
the social foundation desc@@ ends from the mountain into the inner city .
more precisely to the Graf @-@ St@@ auff@@ enberg @-@ Platz .
a new lod@@ gings was recently opened there .
&quot; here , immediately next to the shopping market , sen@@ iors and couns@@ ell@@ ors receive information on questions such as care insurance or services of health and care insurance . &quot;
&quot; for years , we have been working with our out@@ patient care service that often car@@ egi@@ vers are left alone . &quot;
there are infinite number of questions .
&quot; not rarely , many benefits of the insurance are not used because the complexity of insurance companies is hardly understood , &quot; explained the new house@@ keeper Jutta W@@ eig@@ and , who is responsible for the Anton@@ isti@@ ft and the Bürger@@ sp@@ ital as well as for the ambul@@ ant service &quot; Amadeus &quot; . &quot;
&quot; in addition to consulting services , the new district office also offers prevention , health courses and wellness . &quot;
&quot; for this purpose , the Sal@@ u@@ dis was taken into the boat . &quot;
&quot; therefore , you can use additional offers such as a crash prevention , memory training or a physi@@ otherapeu@@ tic treatment . &quot;
the offers from the Senior Ci@@ tizens Centre and the Sal@@ u@@ dis complement each other in an ideal way .
&quot; Sal@@ u@@ dis stands for prevention , prevention and rehabilitation . &quot;
&quot; the senior centre for care and care , &quot; said Heike R@@ ie@@ del , manager of Sal@@ u@@ dis . &quot;
&quot; the reason for the opening of the new district offices in the city centre , both executives see particularly demographic change . &quot;
because this makes a good de@@ centr@@ alised infrastructure essential in the individual districts of Bamberg in the future .
&quot; moreover , Mayor Wolfgang Metz@@ ner ( SPD ) under@@ lined the inaugur@@ ation ceremony , the district office also devoted itself to the meeting at the age : &quot; there are numerous events and offers on the programme and they invite to a regular soci@@ able con@@ vol@@ ution . &quot;
&quot; with this , the Sozial@@ stiftung makes a big contribution that sen@@ iors can live as independent and well in their familiar environment . &quot;
&quot; the lodging office is open Monday , Wednesday and Friday from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m. , Tuesday and Thursday from 4 p.m. to 6 p.m. and on Satur@@ days from 10 a.m. to noon . &quot;

males review on 17 @-@ year @-@ old Afgh@@ ans
&quot; witnesses seek the police for a incident in Bad So@@ den @-@ Sal@@ mün@@ ster : on Friday evening , at 11 : 45 pm , three young men were on foot from Bad So@@ den towards Sal@@ mün@@ ster . &quot;
&quot; one of the group , a 17 @-@ year @-@ old Afgh@@ an , followed his two friends at a distance of about five meters and called to them that one should wait for him . &quot;
at that time the group was at the level of the b@@ ft gas station .
there were also three persons on the premises of the gas station .
one of these men now sh@@ ou@@ ted to the young and hit the face with the f@@ ist .
the victim suffered a nose and ble@@ ed heavily from the nose .
&quot; when his two friends made ha@@ ste and appe@@ aled to the r@@ ack@@ et , he first left his victim . &quot;
&quot; from his friends , the wounded young man was now brought home . &quot;
the perpet@@ r@@ ator pursued the group with a passenger car up to the apartment and drove there demonstr@@ atively several times .
&quot; when you didn &apos;t see the car any longer , the wounded passed the building to smoke a cigar@@ ette . &quot;
there he was attacked by the r@@ ack@@ et and another male person again .
&quot; under the aid of a head@@ stock , one examined the face and the th@@ igh@@ s of the victim . &quot;
the injured had to be brought to hospital for medical care .
&quot; until now , only a v@@ ague article description is available . &quot;
one of the men was about 1.80 m tall .
the second r@@ ack@@ et should have been about 1.@@ 65 meters tall and was cloth@@ ed with a jeans and a brown @-@ white shirt .

Dr. Frank Müller takes over practice of rock breaks and inv@@ ests 3@@ 10000 Euros
Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll and Frank Müller ( from left ) take over the practice of Karl @-@ Heinrich and Ur@@ sel Fel@@ lowship .
&quot; the mayor Bernd Bor@@ mann , econom@@ ist U@@ ta Sei@@ m @-@ Schw@@ art@@ z and A@@ sen@@ dor@@ fs mayor Hein@@ fried Kab@@ bert are also happy about this . &quot;
&quot; in many places in the country doctors - A@@ sen@@ dorf , on the other hand , are lucky : Dr. Frank Müller takes over the practice of rock breaks on October 1 . &quot;
&quot; while Ur@@ sel Fel@@ lowship is reti@@ ring , her husband Karl @-@ Heinrich stands for his successor in the next few months . &quot;
&quot; after a reconstruction phase , Müller opens the practice on October 12 , until then he invested 3@@ 10000 euros in the premises at St@@ .-@@ Mar@@ cell@@ us@@ straße 6 . &quot;
&quot; it was a kind of sympathy at first sight , when Frank Müller and his wife met Dr. Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll , who is currently completing her training in the Ver@@ dener Hospital , who also wants to get into practice coming year . &quot;
&quot; we always had in mind that the g@@ arb@@ age would fit well into this practice , &quot; says Dr. Ur@@ sel Fel@@ st@@ ausen and laugh@@ s . &quot;
&quot; when it was so far , I just called them . &quot;
the couple Müller liked the idea of continuing their own practice in A@@ sen@@ dorf in the future .
&quot; the proximity and constant contact with the patients are very attractive for us , &quot; says the 39 @-@ year old Müller . &quot;
&quot; we want to meet and accompany the families over the years . &quot;
&quot; as an advantage , he also sees his own boss soon . &quot;
and so it was agreed that the Müll@@ ers bought the house with the practice .
they will continue to live in sh@@ ak@@ land @-@ Vil@@ sen .
&quot; there , the double family father Frank Müller grew up , his medical studies in Hanover followed stations in several medical offices and in hospitals in Sul@@ ingen , Ni@@ enburg and Rot@@ enburg . &quot;
he is currently working as a senior physician in Sul@@ ingen . in 2009 he was appointed as a senior physician in Di@@ ep@@ holz district in 2009 and is engaged in honor@@ ary capacity in the DR@@ K @-@ readiness of Bruch@@ hausen @-@ Vil@@ sen .
&quot; as of September 19 , the practice will be prepared for the new boss . &quot;
&quot; during the sur@@ geon , Dr. Karl @-@ Heinrich Fel@@ stopped working as a resident doctor , his wife Ur@@ sel ( Intern@@ ologist ) speci@@ alis@@ es in g@@ astro@@ enter@@ ology . &quot;
&quot; the g@@ arb@@ age cans , both inter@@ ni@@ sts , want to settle themselves as home dentists . &quot;
&quot; end@@ os@@ copy therefore comes out , &quot; says the 38 @-@ year @-@ old Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll . &quot;
after the conversion the rooms are modern .
we will offer more ultras@@ ound examinations as well as long @-@ term and exposure EC@@ Gs and need a speaking room more .
&quot; in addition , the ED@@ V is completely renewed . &quot;
&quot; the Müll@@ ers will receive a subsi@@ dy of € 500@@ 00 ( 25,000 Euros ) and the municipality ( 12@@ 500 Euro ) and the municipality ( 12@@ 500 Euro ) . &quot;
&quot; this shows how proud and happy we are , that the practice is continued , &quot; empha@@ sizes Mr. Bernd Bor@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; approximately 2000 patients , according to Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll , come into practice in the field of rock breaks every quarter , in the North German average practice it is about 500 . &quot;
in A@@ sen@@ dorf there is another medical practice .
a positive side effect of the practice tak@@ eover by Frank Müller : the pharmacy remains according to Ur@@ sel Fel@@ lowship in A@@ sen@@ dorf .
&quot; if no successor has found himself , she would have gone . &quot;
&quot; by the way , he who visits a g@@ arb@@ age station , also looks in familiar faces : takes over the seven medical professionals and the cleaning power of the rock walls . &quot;
&quot; with their f@@ are@@ well end in A@@ sen@@ dorf an era , after all , the medical professionals have practiced for 30 years . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning we had only two rooms , &quot; Ur@@ sel Fel@@ lowship reminds itself sm@@ iling . &quot;
a little nostal@@ gic feel after the long time already .
&quot; but we continue to live in Hohen@@ mo@@ or and will see many patients very often , &quot; &quot; says the intern@@ ist . &quot;
her husband compl@@ ements : &quot; we have a 6000 square meter plot . &quot;
&quot; so far I have always pressed myself before gardening , now that could be different . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the pair has two grand@@ sons and likes to travel . &quot;
Croatia : &quot; we leave the refugees by &quot;
&quot; now the border controls are also passed on to our southern border , &quot; &quot; said Minister Johanna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner . &quot;
the controls at the Hungarian border remain upright in parallel .
&quot; as before , it is clear that anyone who wants to put an asylum application can make it &quot; self @-@ evident . &quot; &quot;
the care and safety of the people are in the foreg@@ round .
&quot; but it is clear that it needs clear signals , &quot; &quot; said the minister . &quot;
&quot; people must know that we do not accept bor@@ der@@ less migration flows , nor about the Austrian @-@ Sloven@@ ian border . &quot;
it needs a controlled approach .
Croatia is considering &quot; Cor@@ ridor &quot; - Slovenia ref@@ uses
&quot; the Croatian government had previously reported that Slovenia wants to continue to travel to Austria and Germany , and may also er@@ ect cor@@ rid@@ ors for the refugees . &quot;
&quot; the Interior Minister Ves@@ na Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar , however , did not look like this in Lai@@ bach . &quot;
&quot; the idea of cor@@ rid@@ ors is &quot; absolutely un@@ acceptable , &quot; Slovenia will rather intensi@@ fy the monitoring of the border - especially in Hungary . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , the border with Croatia is already heavily controlled as the outer boundary of the Schengen area . &quot;
&quot; as the minister stressed , the Sloven@@ ian will not have abri@@ dged his borders on refugees . &quot;
&quot; any EU member must fill out its commitments , otherwise the system cannot work , &quot; &quot; stressed Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar . &quot;
&quot; as the Croatian government hur@@ ried , the first refugees had already attempted to pass on the border crossing of T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik / Si@@ d in eastern Croatia , to avoid the registration . &quot;
the Croatian police could pick it up in the nearby corn fields .
&quot; according to local media , the Croatian T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik continually meets police vehicles with new refugees . &quot;
&quot; it mainly deals with Syri@@ ans and Afgh@@ ans , including numerous women and children . &quot;
rescue services and the Red Cross are already in use .
&quot; in the coming days , his country ac@@ counted for about 4000 refugees , said Interior Minister R@@ ank@@ o Ost@@ o@@ j@@ ic . &quot;
&quot; in addition , buses from Pres@@ evo at the Mac@@ ed@@ onian @-@ Serbian border , which previously had brought migrants to the Hungarian border , were diver@@ ted towards Croatia , backed by Croatian and Serbian media on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; however , the government in Belgrade denied that it was the people to approach certain routes : &quot; &quot; neither can we nor do we do this , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; according to the media reports , at least in the morning a first bus with about 50 refugees arrived in the Serbian border town of Si@@ d , in the course of the day further buses would be expected . &quot;
&quot; about Croatia , Slovenia and Austria to Germany &quot;
the occup@@ ants travelled the Mac@@ ed@@ onian border to Serbia all night long .
&quot; we heard that Hungary has admitted , so the police said that we should go here , &quot; said one of the refugees . &quot;
&quot; they wanted to travel to Germany by Croatia , Slovenia and Austria . &quot;
&quot; thus , the postpon@@ ement of the previous Balkan @-@ Greece @-@ Macedonia @-@ Serbia @-@ Hungary @-@ Hungary @-@ Hungary @-@ Hungary @-@ Hungary @-@ Hungary @-@ Hungary @-@ Hungary @-@ Hungary @-@ Hungary @-@ Hungary @-@ Hungary @-@ Hungary @-@ Hungary @-@ Hungary @-@ Hungary @-@ Hungary @-@ Hungary @-@ Hungary @-@ Hungary @-@ Hungary @-@ Hungary @-@ Hungary @-@ Hungary @-@ Hungary @-@ Hungary @-@ Hungary @-@ Hungary @-@ Hungary @-@ Hungary @-@ Hungary @-@ Hungary @-@ Hungary @-@ Hungary @-@ Hungary @-@ Hungary @-@ Hungary @-@ Hungary @-@ Hungary @-@ Hungary @-@ Hungary @-@ Hungary @-@ Hungary @-@ Hungary @-@ Hungary @-@ Hungary @-@ Hungary @-@ Hungary @-@ Hungary @-@ Hungary @-@ Hungary @-@ Hungary @-@ Hungary @-@ Hungary @-@ Hungary @-@ Hungary @-@ Hungary @-@ Hungary @-@ Hungary @-@ Hungary @-@ Hungary @-@ Hungary @-@ Hungary @-@ Hungary @-@ Hungary @-@ Hungary @-@ Hungary @-@ Hungary @-@ Hungary @-@ Hungary @-@ Hungary @-@ Hungary @-@ Hungary @-@ Hungary @-@ Hungary @-@ Hungary @-@ Hungary @-@ Hungary @-@ Hungary @-@ Hungary @-@ Hungary @-@ Hungary @-@ Hungary @-@ Hungary @-@ Hungary @-@ Hungary @-@ Hungary @-@ Hungary @-@ Hungary @-@ Hungary @-@ Hungary @-@ Hungary @-@ Hungary @-@ Hungary @-@ Hungary @-@ Hungary @-@ Hungary @-@ Hungary @-@ Hungary @-@ Hungary @-@ Hungary @-@ Hungary @-@ Hungary @-@ Hungary @-@ Hungary @-@ Hungary
&quot; Croatia : &quot; &quot; comprehensive options for border control &quot; &quot; &quot;
Croatia Interior Minister Ost@@ o@@ j@@ ic had previously emphasized that his country has prepared appropriate plans for possible exceptions for the case of a strong influ@@ x of refugees .
&quot; he did not call it , but pointed out that Croatia as a non @-@ Schengen member has &quot; &quot; comprehensive possibilities for border control . &quot; &quot; &quot;
perform strict controls to qualify for membership in the Schengen area .
&quot; Slovenia has been part of this since 2007 , the EU partners since then consistently exhibit a good testimony to the standard of border controls . &quot;
&quot; on the Serbian side , about 300 refugees continue to be stuck behind the Hungarian border fence . &quot;
&quot; according to Belgrade &apos;s media reports , they would have spent the past night at the border crossing of Hor@@ gos , which leads to R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke . &quot;
&quot; according to Hungarian authorities , the two border cross@@ ings of Hor@@ gos and Back@@ i Bre@@ g remain completely blocked . &quot;
&quot; whether the remaining refugees wish to travel to the Croatian border , is still uncle@@ ar . &quot;
Serbian Minister of Interior Minister N@@ ebo@@ j@@ sa Stef@@ ano@@ vic tried to so@@ jour@@ n in Hor@@ gos on Wednesday morning : he considers the debates on alternative routes of refugees after the Hungarian border is now closed .
&quot; at the moment , it would not be about very high refugee numbers . &quot;
&quot; one could not yet say whether they would continue their journey through Hungary , Croatia or another country . &quot;
hel@@ pers advise migrants - dangerous - alternative routes
&quot; however , private Hungarian refugees have already begun distribut@@ ing maps to the refugees on which alternative routes are marked by Croatia . &quot;
&quot; however , the border crossing between Serbia and Croatia is not dangerous : in parts of the border area , there are still only 20 years after the end of the Croatian war , there are still un@@ cleared min@@ e@@ fields . &quot;
on Wednesday afternoon Croatian police announced that a team of mine clearance was sent to the border region .

Fed@@ Ex result bl@@ ended financial outlook for 2016 lo@@ wered
&quot; Fed@@ Ex reports dis@@ ap@@ pointing results for the last quarter , and the supplier giant revealed its profit prospects for a whole year because of the weaker demand for cargo services and higher costs in its body transport service . &quot;
&quot; the company also said that it plans to hire about 55@@ ,000 seasonal workers for the holiday . &quot;
&quot; at this time last year , Fed@@ Ex announced that the company wants to set 50,000 seasonal workers for the holiday season . &quot;
the share fell over 2.5 percent in Pre@@ market Trading 45 minutes before the opening on Wednesday .
&quot; Fed@@ Ex Corp. said to earn a profit between $ 10.@@ 40 and 10.@@ 90 $ in the financial year ending in May , 20 C@@ ent less than previous pre@@ diction . &quot;
analysts expect a survey of Fac@@ t@@ Set 10.@@ 84 $ .
&quot; in spite of the price increases , the lower prospect will amount to 4.2 percent and will be effective on January 4 , and despite higher ra@@ inf@@ all for body transport of heavy and large packages , which will be raised from November . &quot;
&quot; the company said it nevertheless expects that the result compared to the previous year will increase due to cost reduction , higher revenue and due to growth in online trading . &quot;
&quot; Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said that the company produces solid yields if you consider the weaker than expected economic conditions , especially in manufacturing and global trade . &quot;
&quot; the plans for vacation jobs were announced one day later than that of the Ri@@ val U@@ PS , which plans to employ 90@@ .000 to 95@@ ,000 additional workers , about the same number as last year . &quot;
&quot; in the quarter , which ended on 31 August , Fed@@ Ex was earning 6@@ 92 million dollars , 6 percent more than in the previous year . &quot;
&quot; earnings per share stood at 2.@@ 42 $ per share , just behind the 2.@@ 44 $ per share , which predicted twelve of Z@@ acks Investment Research analysts predic@@ t . &quot;
sales rose by 5 percent to 12.@@ 3 billion $ .
&quot; six of the analysts surv@@ ey@@ ed were 12,@@ 23 billion $ . &quot;
&quot; in recent years , Fed@@ Ex has reported a decline in international priority shipping , which brought sales in its unit express ship@@ ments to stagn@@ ation . &quot;
but the boom in online shopping has increased the results from Fed@@ Ex Ground .
&quot; in the last quarter , sales in the body transport increased by 29 percent , but the operating result was basically flat due to higher costs for larger packages and self insurance . &quot;
&quot; the express unit recorded higher revenue due to higher prices , while earnings declined due to higher labor costs in the cargo business . &quot;
&quot; in the market trade , about an hour before the opening , Fed@@ Ex shares dropped by 3.@@ 85 $ , or 2.5 percent , to 15@@ 0.@@ 15 . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , they closed with 11 percent loss for the year and 17 percent below a record high on June 11 . &quot;
&quot; on their most anticipated conference in the year , Federal Reserve Str@@ at@@ egen will spend two days this week sitting around a 27 @-@ foot Honduras @-@ Mah@@ o@@ gan@@ y table to decide whether it is time for the first time for almost a decade to raise the lead . &quot;
&quot; dro@@ pping over them at one end of the decorated , two @-@ story sitting hall is a wall picture of the United States . &quot;
the card is a reminder that the F@@ ed @-@ chairman Jan@@ et L. Y@@ ellen and her colleagues should put the economic interests of the nation before all the other things .
the central bank has a two @-@ fold mandate from the Congress : to maxim@@ ize US occupation and prices here stable .
&quot; but since the big recession , the F@@ ed leaders have acknowledged that there is an un@@ written third mandate : financial stability . &quot;
and this third mandate could be the X @-@ factor in a decision that is too tight to predic@@ t it . it will be announced on Thursday whether the U.S. economy is ready to be we@@ an@@ ed by the unprecedented wealth of interest since the end of 2008 .
&quot; although most of the data of the economy show that it grows solid , the recent turbul@@ ence on the global financial markets could make the already cau@@ tious F@@ ed representatives anx@@ ious to increase this volati@@ lity by raising interest for federal bonds - and be it only a quarter percentage point . &quot;
&quot; obviously , the labour market and inflation are primarily the most important thing they observe , &quot; said Lind@@ sey M. Pi@@ eg@@ za , chief econom@@ ist at the bro@@ ker@@ age company Sti@@ fel Nicol@@ aus &amp; Co . &quot;
&quot; but I think if they were looking for a pre@@ text to not increase interest rate , the increased uncertainty around the global market is enough justi@@ fication to continue to wait , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; there is no consensus on what the F@@ ed will do , which ass@@ ures itself the financial market itself . &quot;
about half of the econom@@ ists who were recently asked by Blo@@ om@@ berg have predicted a interest rate this week .
&quot; however , the financial markets expect a waiting for the F@@ ed , with a key indicator , which shows only a 30 % chance for an increase . &quot;
&quot; this indicates a decline in the stock market if the F@@ ed increases the sentence , unless the strateg@@ ists reduce the blow by promising that a further increase is far away . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , the Dow Jones Industrial aver@@ aged by 228@@ ,@@ 89 points or by 1.4 % to 16,@@ 59@@ 9,@@ 85 . &quot;
&quot; the action was triggered by expectations that the F@@ ed policy maintains the set this week , said John Lon@@ ski , chief econom@@ ist at Moo@@ dy &apos;s Capital Markets Research Group . &quot;
&quot; it would be a surprise if the F@@ ed would raise the sentences at that point , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; if she does , &quot; she would have to go very far in her statement to calm down the financial markets so that they don &apos;t get panic . &quot;
&quot; other experts argu@@ ed that interest rate would calm down the financial markets , because it would remove the uncertainty about when the F@@ ed will act . &quot;
&quot; one month ago , the F@@ ed seemed to increase the set by 0.25 percentage points this month , the first small step in a slow shar@@ pen@@ ing of monetary conditions which would test the strength of recovery in the United States . &quot;
&quot; Y@@ ellen had said in spring and early summer that this year , despite the complaints of liber@@ als , that more economic advance would be required , an increase in the sentence . &quot;
&quot; although the creation of jobs slow@@ ed in August , the improvement in the labour market was solid this year . &quot;
&quot; unemployment rate dropped to 5.1 % last month , the lowest for more than seven years and close to the level that the F@@ ed sees as full employment . &quot;
wage increases have shown signs of recovery .
&quot; and although inflation was constantly below the annual target of 2 % of the central bank , the F@@ ed representatives said that the main reason was the temporary effect of significantly lower oil prices . &quot;
&quot; the economy &quot; can handle higher interest rates and needs them because of the tension on the labour market , &quot; said Ian Sh@@ ep@@ her@@ dson , chief econom@@ ist at Pan@@ the@@ on Macro@@ economics . &quot;
but financial markets all over the world ended up last month after China de@@ valued its currency .
&quot; the Dow Jones Industrial A@@ verage value fell by more than 16 % in May , when investors feared that a slow@@ down of the Chinese economy would ch@@ okes global growth . &quot;
&quot; the market has recovered somewhat this month , and the Dow is now almost 10 % below May . &quot;
&quot; for the F@@ ed representatives , the market turbul@@ ences affect the complex calculation , when it is to increase interest rates . &quot;
&quot; if the events on the financial markets and the news on the weakness of the Chinese economy had not occurred in the last few weeks , they would attract the re@@ ins at this meeting , &quot; said Stephen D. O@@ liner , Senior Research Fel@@ low at the U@@ C@@ LA Zim@@ an Center for Real Estate and a former employee of the US National Bank . &quot;
now he predic@@ ts that she will wait at least one month to get the effect better .
&quot; there is a lot of uncertainty about what the impact on the US economy will be , and there is almost no reliable data describing the developments in China , &quot; &quot; said O@@ lin@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; the health of the world economy is none of the main concerns of the F@@ ed , so it should not be included in their decision making . &quot;
but in the end the F@@ ed currency authority of the world has become .
the influence of the central bank was enormous in recent years .
&quot; the mere hint of the former director Ben S. Bern@@ anke in 2013 that the F@@ ed could &quot; &quot; close &quot; &quot; their monetary expansion , unle@@ ashed confusion around the globe . &quot;
&quot; in a world where markets and economies are increasingly inter@@ tw@@ ined , the F@@ ed representatives can be expected to not only monitor developments elsewhere , but are also advised by other central banks and experts to gain a better understanding of the global economy . &quot;
&quot; her decision making is &quot; more art than science , &quot; said Zach@@ ary Kar@@ ab@@ ell , Head of the Global Strategy for Property Management of En@@ v@@ est@@ net Inc . &quot;
&quot; Jeff@@ rey L@@ acker , President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Rich@@ mond , VA . &quot;
&quot; the Federal Open Market Committee , a voting member of the Federal Open Market Committee , speci@@ alis@@ es in interest rate , made decisions in 1998 / 1999 as an example . &quot;
&quot; a financial crisis in Asia brought the F@@ ed down by 0.@@ 75 percentage points in three sessions , &quot; despite the limited recognis@@ able impact on growth in the United States , &quot; said Mr L@@ acker . &quot;
one year later the F@@ ed representatives were revers@@ ing these cuts .
&quot; the F@@ ed should put aspects of financial stability in the first place only during a severe crisis , such as the market re@@ unification in 2008 , said Adam S. P@@ osen , a former member of the Committee for the interest of the Bank of England . &quot;
&quot; the recent turbul@@ ence does not come close to that level , he said . &quot;
&quot; she certainly does not want to fall into the situation in which she is afraid of interest in interest , as markets open up , &quot; said P@@ osen , President of Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot;
&quot; the Federal Reserve Act still contains the double mandate and does not men@@ tions financial stability , and until this is changed , I don &apos;t think that it should be ahead of time . &quot;

Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da : small Leben@@ sh@@ ilfe for refugees
more and more refugees arrive these days in Germany .
&quot; to give you a warm welcome , does not go without the commitment of inn@@ umer@@ able volunteers . &quot;
also in Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da there are a number of people who support un@@ sel@@ fish asylum seek@@ ers in the city .
Petra and Klaus H@@ eine belong to them .
Petra H@@ eine is with body and soul teacher .
she still loves to teach her 74 lessons .
every Thursday she is doing it in the asylum seek@@ er at D@@ ill@@ inger Straße .
&quot; there she helps refugees from Syria , Kur@@ dist@@ an , Kosovo and Pakistan to learn the German language . &quot;
&quot; of course , the whole thing is different than at the right school . &quot;
Rio Grande pedi@@ atric household fo@@ sters nutrition for healthy breast@@ feeding
&quot; the Brazilian pa@@ edi@@ atric organization Spr@@ S tries to elu@@ ci@@ date women about how important good nutrition during lac@@ tation is . she does this with the presentation of images of babies , which are painted on breasts that are painted with represent@@ ations of un@@ healthy foods . &quot;
&quot; breast milk consists of a variety of proteins , fats , vitamins and carbohydrates that inf@@ ect all the nutrients they need to build a strong immune system . &quot;
&quot; due to the additional energy requirements , pregnant women and young mothers are advised to increase their daily cal@@ orie intake by about 500 calories per day . &quot;
&quot; however , new research results suggest that a higher cal@@ orie intake is not the only dietary modification that mothers should undertake . &quot;
&quot; a recent study conducted by Robert Water@@ land , Professor at the Bay@@ lor College of Medicine in Texas , showed that a healthy diet of pregnant women actually affects the genes of their babies and protects them from the development of tum@@ ours . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , an un@@ healthy diet of the child can neg@@ atively affect the immune system . &quot;
exceptions for the new Bern@@ rie@@ der Spor@@ thalle
the municipality of Bern@@ ried approved the construction contract for the 2.3 million euros of expensive sports hall .
and he made an exception .
the roof can be fl@@ atten@@ ed for solar installation .
planning for the long @-@ awa@@ ited turn@@ h@@ building at the Bern@@ rie@@ der Sport@@ grounds is progres@@ sing step by step : in the recent communal session the elabor@@ ated construction contract was unanim@@ ously prevented without major discussions .
&quot; prior to this , the committee also decided to apply for a civil &quot; exemp@@ tion &quot; resp@@ ect@@ ful &quot; exemp@@ tion &quot; from the valid development plan . &quot;
&quot; in the &quot; &quot; exception &quot; &quot; it was a permit for a special form with respect to the roof construction . &quot;
&quot; therefore , a &quot; saddle roof with non @-@ centered first and roof top &quot; is to be erected . &quot;
&quot; the planning is the intended use of the roof surface for solar installations : &quot; &quot; this allows us to get a wonderfully large southern roof , &quot; &quot; explained Mayor Josef St@@ eigen@@ berger at the meeting . &quot;
&quot; in the &quot; &quot; liberation &quot; &quot; it was again the roof ti@@ lt , which for energetic reasons - differently than in the plan of cultivation - is to lie below ten degrees . &quot;
this significantly reduces the volume of the hall .
&quot; for this reason , a &quot; liberation &quot; was necessary because the plan for the roof does not permit &quot; exceptions &quot; - whereby the Bern@@ rie@@ der Municipal Council usually goes rather restric@@ tive in the case of liber@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; in Turn@@ h@@ ello , however , it is not a recur@@ ring project : &quot; we do not create a preced@@ ent , &quot; said St@@ eigen@@ berger . &quot;
the gymn@@ astic building at the sports centre is a joint project of the municipality and the SV Bern@@ ried .
some 2.3 million euros are calculated at the expense .
subsidies are expected from school and latitude .
&quot; in the next step of the procedure , the building application for the 18 x 36 meters large hall is now presented to the council office . &quot;
clinic Pei@@ tor@@ berg moves to Sch@@ ong@@ au
&quot; the hospital is scheduled to be closed earlier than planned , namely in 2016 . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , Dr. Wilhelm Fischer ( 66 ) becomes new medical director at the Sch@@ ong@@ au Hospital . &quot;
the station as well as the majority of staff move from Pei@@ ri@@ berg to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
&quot; this shows the surprising plans of the hospital GmbH of the county , which confirmed land@@ lady Andrea J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß . &quot;
&quot; however , a decision about it , however , meets the Supervisory Board and the meeting on Wednesday , September 23 . &quot;
&quot; if the plans are implemented , then all of the nearly 50 employees would continue to work at the hospital in Pei@@ sen@@ berg . &quot;
the vast majority should move to Sch@@ ong@@ au with Fischer and the further existing interior station .
the rooms are available .
&quot; the employees who are not able to go to Sch@@ ong@@ au should be offered a workplace in Wei@@ l@@ heim , so J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß . &quot;
the employees are informed of the plans .
&quot; the change was triggered by Dr. Andreas E@@ der , who has been a medical director at the Sch@@ ong@@ auer Klinik since the beginning of the year and is now transferred to a private practice in close proximity to the hospital . &quot;
&quot; according to J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß , the name &quot; Fischer &quot; came into play with the question of who to pursue the succession , the name &quot; Fischer &quot; came into play , who declared himself ready to take over the leadership from October 1 and to change his team to Sch@@ ong@@ au . &quot;
&quot; for the house in Sch@@ ong@@ au , this is in every case a &quot; recovery &quot; and a wi@@ dening of the offer in the area of &quot; internal medicine , &quot; so J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiss . &quot;
Fischer is a specialist for pac@@ em@@ akers and de@@ fibr@@ ill@@ ators .
Sch@@ ong@@ au ( 180 beds ) speci@@ alis@@ es in g@@ astro@@ enter@@ ological diseases on the inside station .
&quot; for the next two years , fishermen with his team will be responsible if the Supervisory Board agre@@ es to agree on both houses until then next year , the former hospital of the Kn@@ app@@ schaft , which still has 35 beds , is to be closed for almost 140 years after almost 140 years . &quot;
&quot; until now , the county had planned this for 2018 , when the currently running rehabilitation at the hospital Wei@@ l@@ heim is completed . &quot;
&quot; J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß , who is also Chairman of the Supervisory Board , contra@@ sts rum@@ ors that the house , owned by the Bundes@@ rat , will in future be used as accommodation for asylum seek@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; what I do with the real estate could not say J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß asser@@ ted , there are several considerations . &quot;
&quot; currently , there is a short @-@ term care of Car@@ itas and a daily sy@@ chiat@@ ry accommod@@ ated there . &quot;
&quot; what better could not happen to us , such an opportunity does not come again , &quot; said Fischer about the Qu@@ asi move to the Le@@ ch , who had been received &quot; positive and very understanding . &quot; &quot;
&quot; a real perspective for the house where fishermen have been working as a chief doctor for over 30 years , have not given it . &quot;
he was asked by Sch@@ ong@@ auer &apos;s colleagues to take over the post of the medical director .
&quot; the hospital Pei@@ tor@@ berg ( once 100 beds ) was repeatedly threatened by closure in recent decades , departments were closed , for example surgery and obst@@ et@@ rics . &quot;
the Hand@@ b@@ aller of the Rhein @-@ Neck@@ ar lions is called for Berg@@ ischen HC today evening ( 20.@@ 3@@ pm ) .
&quot; although the championship leader of the Bundes@@ liga in Wuppertal is the clear favourite , there is no reason for arrogan@@ ce . &quot;
&quot; in the past season , the B@@ HC saw a painful defeat at the B@@ HC and gave it a bit of ben@@ ign . &quot;
hun@@ ts with two injured in Pr@@ at@@ au
two tractor passengers have been seriously injured during their ma@@ ize harvest during the afternoon by shots .
&quot; during the ab@@ err@@ ation on a corn field near Pr@@ at@@ au ( district Witt@@ enberg ) , several h@@ unters were in use as the police hur@@ ried . &quot;
&quot; after a shot of shot , a 63@@ - and a 22 @-@ year @-@ old man suffered severe injuries and were brought to hospitals . &quot;

a crime susp@@ ect has led the police to the cor@@ p@@ se of the 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate .
&quot; in the inter@@ rog@@ ation , the 20 @-@ year @-@ old admitted that the young people were killed and their cor@@ p@@ ses have thrown into a channel in rock@@ enh@@ ausen . &quot;
&quot; a 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate , missed since Saturday , has fallen victim to violent crimes . &quot;
&quot; the cor@@ p@@ se of the young woman was found on Tuesday evening in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen near Kais@@ ers@@ lau@@ tern , as public prosec@@ utor and police announced on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; as an active one , a 20 @-@ year @-@ old was also taken on the Tuesday evening , who , according to the fact , stated the indication and the investig@@ ator led to the discovery site of the body . &quot;
&quot; the 16 @-@ year @-@ old was missing on Sunday morning , after they had not come home on the eve of a visit to an autumn festival in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen . &quot;
&quot; in search of the young woman , investig@@ ators first encountered personal bel@@ ong@@ ings of the victim . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
the alleged perpet@@ r@@ ator led the police into a channel in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen where the cor@@ p@@ se was found .
&quot; according to the authorities , the prisoner also admitted to the police officers who killed 16 @-@ year @-@ old and put the dead in the channel . &quot;
&quot; the 20 @-@ year @-@ old should be presented on Wednesday to the port fun@@ nel , the investig@@ ators lay hands on the burden . &quot;
the following investigations shall bring about the closer conditions of action .
refugees need accommodation : study warn of apartment gap
the location on the German housing market is ten@@ se .
more and more refugees are looking for an affordable stay .
the pressure on the housing market is growing .
the social housing construction is faced with a challenge .
the distribution competitions on the German housing market have long since begun .
&quot; with the coming refugees and job@@ seek@@ ers from the EU , more and more people are pushing for a market that is already over@@ loaded in many big cities . &quot;
they compete with low @-@ income citizens around the last affordable housing .
&quot; in order to meet demand for affordable housing , 400@@ ,000 new units would have to be built up to 2020 . &quot;
this results in a study commissioned by the Con@@ federation of Municipal Auth@@ orities .
&quot; for comparison , 26@@ 0,000 units are finished this year . &quot;
&quot; thus , 140@@ .000 apartments are missing . &quot;
&quot; after the first three months of their stay , refugees are no longer oblig@@ ated to live as asylum seek@@ ers in an initial accommodation . &quot;
many come across the housing market and lined up in the long queu@@ es in front of the ten@@ ants .
&quot; according to the Federal Statistical Office , however , less than half of all asylum seek@@ ers lived in the last year . &quot;
&quot; however , the negative development of the housing market is not only due to the rising number of refugees . &quot;
the study also makes significant om@@ is@@ sions in the housing policy of recent years .
&quot; Germany pus@@ hes a housing defic@@ it , which is getting bigger from year to year . &quot;
&quot; currently in the metrop@@ olitan areas around 7@@ 0,000 residential units , Matthias Günther , author of the study compl@@ ains . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , many professionals stayed in big cities not@@ ated in WG rooms . &quot;
&quot; young adults remained un@@ will@@ ingly longer in the &quot; &quot; Hotel Mama &quot; &quot; because of the F@@ lau@@ te on the housing market . &quot;
&quot; in large cities , the number of square meters per capit@@ a has declined again for the first time in recent years . &quot;
&quot; to solve the problem , the alliance &quot; Social Housing Construction &quot; proposes a re@@ boot . &quot;
new incen@@ tives for the social housing construction should be boo@@ sted again .
this could be wai@@ ved on the real estate tax and the land tax for subsidi@@ zed homes can be suspended .
&quot; moreover , according to the alliance , attractive tax de@@ preci@@ ation possibilities are necessary . &quot;
the support programme for refugees shel@@ ters by the Kf@@ W State Bank is already well received by cities and municipalities .
&quot; a good week after the start of the Monday evening with 184 million euros , more than half of the available approximately 300 million euros have already been accessed . &quot;
now the project could even be increased .
refugees have free money : Croatia and Slovenia align cor@@ ridor
&quot; Hungary is practically no passing through , as more and more refugees choose the way through Croatia . &quot;
Zagreb is announc@@ ing the transit through Slovenia to the North without hur@@ d@@ les .
but the route is dangerous however .
Croatia wants to communicate with the neighbouring country of Slovenia on the establishment of a cor@@ ridor for refugees .
&quot; I spoke to Sloven@@ ian interior minister , and if necessary , we will organize a cor@@ ridor , &quot; &quot; said Croatian Interior Minister R@@ ank@@ o Ost@@ o@@ j@@ ic . &quot;
Slovenia is located between Croatia and Austria and is already part of the Schengen area .
the EU country of Croatia is not yet a Schengen country .
&quot; after the de@@ preci@@ ation of the Serbian @-@ Hungarian border , hundreds of refugees have been abandoned to Croatia to get to Western Europe . &quot;
&quot; 500 people came across the border near T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik , the Croatian TV station RT@@ L reports . &quot;
Hungary had sealed its border for refugees on the eve of the day .
new laws that came into force on the same day make decent asylum procedures in Hungary virtually unnecessary .
Croatia wants to let the refugees pass .
&quot; the Croatian Prime Minister Zor@@ an Mil@@ ano@@ vic declared : &quot; they can travel through , and we are preparing for this possibility . &quot;
&quot; these people are there , there are women , children and men who want to live and achieve something . &quot;
&quot; however , there are people who do not want to live in Croatia . &quot;
the Croatian police interven@@ ed in the morning the first refugees on the border of Serbia to the EU neighbouring Croatia .
&quot; most reported media reports from Syria , Iran and Afghanistan . &quot;
they came to the Serbian border town of Si@@ d both by bus and taxi .
immediately after their arrival they would have tried to get on foot over the green border to Croatia .
&quot; on the Croatian @-@ Serbian border , the refugees do not viol@@ ate border f@@ ences . &quot;
&quot; for this , the border strip holds other dangers : there are still sharp mines from the Yugosla@@ v civil war in the 1990s . &quot;
mine clearance should now quickly create a secure passage .
&quot; after the closure of the border , no more refugees arrive in Hungary after the closure of the border . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , the police counted 366 im@@ pris@@ oned people . &quot;
just before closing on Monday it was still 93@@ 80 .
the new Hungarian laws classi@@ fy the over@@ coming and damage of the border zone as a crime .
&quot; in the southern Hungarian border town of Sz@@ eg@@ ed , 35 criminal proceedings were initiated . &quot;
the convic@@ ted thre@@ aten det@@ ention up to five years and the deport@@ ation from the country .
&quot; according to the immigration authority , on Tuesday we have accepted 94 asylum applications in the newly established &quot; Tran@@ sit ones &quot; ( almost all - 93 - at the most important transition of R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke ) . &quot;
among the applicant are 13 families with small children and two older people .
&quot; on Wednesday morning , there were 40 refugees . &quot;
&quot; however , virtually no one has a prospect for granted asylum in Hungary . &quot;
&quot; according to Hungarian opinion , Serbia is a &quot; &quot; safe third country &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the rejected asylum seek@@ ers should be de@@ ported there .
only a few hundred refugees gathered in front of the &quot; transit zone &quot; in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke workers began to clean up with it .
they collected the tr@@ ash that tens of thousands of people had left behind the road@@ side for tens of thousands of people .
locking lat@@ tices were disman@@ tled and one of the det@@ ention centres in the border area was rebuilt .
no one wanted to express itself to the goal of this reconstruction .
&quot; after the closure of the border between Serbia and Hungary , Austria is only a few refugees . &quot;
the country has also strengthened its border controls .
&quot; around 20,000 migrants were still in the country after government declar@@ ations . &quot;
around 1400 people in Salzburg are waiting for the continuation of the trip to Germany .
the train traffic from there to Germany was stopped by the German authorities in the morning .
in Frei@@ las@@ sing regularly smaller groups of refugees met on foot .
Mayor imports &quot; str@@ and@@ ete &quot; over the border
&quot; we were busy after the bridge @-@ festival on Sunday with the clean @-@ up , as suddenly ten people with travel agents stood at the entrance of the tent , &quot; &quot; says the mayor Alo@@ is Stad@@ ler . &quot;
tourists who wanted to travel by train to Pass@@ au .
&quot; because Germany had surprisingly set the rail traffic with Austria on Sunday but because of the refugee flow , it was in Wern@@ stein at the end , &quot; &quot; Stad@@ ler , who immediately offered his help and outlined the border together with two other hel@@ pers and their cars across the border into the near Pass@@ au . &quot;
&quot; prior to that , we have only ta@@ sted the un@@ trusted guests once , with jams and drinks . &quot;
&quot; we have said the same , we bring them to Pass@@ au by car . &quot;
&quot; that was of course for us , &quot; said Stad@@ ler in the O@@ Ö@@ N interview . &quot;
they were very grateful .
a man didn &apos;t let him take a generous donation - 100 Euros for the fire bri@@ g@@ ade .
&quot; that made us very happy , &quot; &quot; said Stad@@ ler . &quot;
&quot; the str@@ anded train passengers had moved from an ICE into a regional train towards Pass@@ au on Sunday evening in Wels , after the short notice that the rail traffic was set to Germany , but still to try the border . &quot;
&quot; the regional train , however , was completed before the border in Wern@@ stein at the Inn . &quot;
&quot; in Wern@@ stein , the cross @-@ border crossing is generally high in the course . &quot;
&quot; the Brück@@ en@@ fest association with the Bavarian neighbours on Sunday soci@@ able , tags previously a two @-@ bridge run spor@@ ti@@ ly - organized by the Union Wern@@ stein and Bayern from Neu@@ kirchen . &quot;
that Viktor Or@@ b@@ án sends further zig@@ z@@ ons to us is a logical result of a hypo@@ critical policy :
&quot; instead of assist@@ ing in the R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke camp at the establishment of structures that ensure humanity , our Chancellor has officially inaugurated the position of the Hungarian government into the Dun@@ st@@ bin of National Socialism . &quot;
&quot; sorry , there is no translation for this news @-@ article . &quot;
&quot; the refugees will also have to find that the &quot; &quot; Pro@@ mis@@ ed Land &quot; , &quot; which she invited and welcomed , is nothing but another refugee camp . &quot;
&quot; it will be a major challenge , in view of the ongoing refugee streams and the approaching winter , to produce decent conditions for protective seek@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; and it will be an even greater - peace , security and stability in Austria . &quot;
Konrad in search of 35@@ .000 winter@@ tight quarters
Konrad has all hands to do with the refugees .
Christian Konrad is used to the fact that his word has weight .
the government has used the former powerful Rai@@ ff@@ eisen ban@@ ker to provide squ@@ ads for thousands of refugees .
the chaos in the first recording centre Tra@@ is@@ kirchen already got a grip on Konrad .
&quot; we have no hom@@ eless more in Tra@@ is@@ kirchen , &quot; he reported of his first success . &quot;
&quot; also the placing of the 20,000 refugees , who came to Austria on Monday , was without major vor@@ tices , said Konrad and praised the organisational &quot; master@@ performance . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the Ministry of the Interior , on the other hand , spoke of a &quot; crisis @-@ like situation . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in total , Konrad expects about 8@@ 5,000 quarters in the he@@ ur@@ less year . &quot;
&quot; in order to meet the number , 35@@ ,000 accommodation units will have to be found in the next few weeks - 20,000 is supposed to provide 15@@ ,000 the federal government . &quot;
&quot; should there be more refugees , we can create it . &quot;
&quot; but it is not a barrel without a floor , &quot; said Konrad . &quot;
he has already held talks with the provincial people .
&quot; they would have assured him , even for the coming refugees lod@@ gings . &quot;
&quot; in Upper Austria it runs fine , &quot; &quot; said Ferry Mai@@ er . &quot;
the former VP @-@ Mand@@ ala supports Konrad .
there will be a meeting with Cardinal Christoph Schön@@ born to clarify how the Church will help .
&quot; great expectations put the asylum coordin@@ ator into the OR@@ F action &quot; &quot; Hel@@ ps as we do . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; on the platform , individuals can easily offer accommodations . &quot;
&quot; in addition , one hopes for hotels that stand empty in winter . &quot;
&quot; in yesterday , Konrad and Mai@@ er critic@@ ised the standards for accommodation as &quot; very high . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in times of emergency , it cannot be that Qu@@ arti@@ er@@ ers have to hold a certain amount of the towel holder or the size of the overhead . &quot;
&quot; for a temporary time , &quot; &quot; emergency standards &quot; &quot; must apply . &quot;
&quot; in contrast to the Ministry of Interior at placing more successful , Konrad is founded with his experience . &quot;
&quot; I am an older gent@@ leman , which one does not say without further into the face of fal@@ seh@@ ood . &quot;
persu@@ asion is its most important weapon .
Konrad and Mai@@ er do not cause any costs of the Republic as they stated themselves .
they want to increase their number of employees to three to four .
&quot; until now , the own Qu@@ arti@@ er@@ suche has not been successful . &quot;
Konrad wanted to place a container at the Steph@@ an@@ splatz as an office .
&quot; however , there are apparently problems with the approval . &quot;
Linz calls for a better distribution
&quot; first of all , no opening of municipal sports halls and other buildings such as Tips @-@ Arena and Design Center for refugee housing plans the city of Linz . &quot;
&quot; this is not necessary at the moment , as the persons concerned are currently unable to submit these measures , says mayor Klaus L@@ ug@@ er ( SP ) . &quot;
&quot; for emer@@ gen@@ cies , however , further sites are to be examined for their suitability . &quot;
the city manager exercises criticism of the distribution of refugees within the federal state .
other districts also need to make their contribution here .
&quot; seals : &quot; &quot; borders are not sealed &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; in a longer telephone conversation with the Bavarian prime minister Horst Seeh@@ o@@ fer ( CS@@ U ) , Landes@@ haupt@@ mann Josef P@@ ühr@@ inger ( VP ) announced further action in the refugee issue on Monday . &quot;
Seeh@@ o@@ fer assured me that the German fron@@ tiers are not sealed off .
the continuing journey of refugees to the Federal Republic of Germany remains possible .
&quot; however , there is now the corresponding border controls . &quot;
there will be no more special trains with refugees to Germany .
&quot; however , the seek@@ ers would be brought to Germany with regular trains . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; from the other EU member states , P@@ ühr@@ inger once again demanded more reinforced solidarity in the refugee issue . &quot;
&quot; the fact that Austria once again introduces controls to its limits , is &quot; a logical consequence &quot; from the procedure of the Germans for P@@ ühr@@ inger . &quot;
the next Run@@ t@@ astic is a matter of time
&quot; the general renovation of the &quot; &quot; New Wer@@ ft &quot; &quot; in the Lin@@ zer industrial line is officially completed . &quot;
&quot; in four of the six floors of the office and production building , the listed IT Group is re@@ trac@@ ted S &amp; T , the rest ( 2700 square meter ) is to be rented to young , innovative companies from the technology sector . &quot;
&quot; in IT the clever think@@ ers are our raw material - and we must try to work for us , &quot; says S &amp; D leader Hannes Nieder@@ haus@@ er . &quot;
&quot; he could imagine investing in startup companies of the New Wer@@ ft , and later also to acquire them . &quot;
&quot; from the very beginning , S &amp; T wants to cooperate with the new neighbours - what Nieder@@ haus@@ er promises something : &quot; the next Run@@ t@@ astic is just a matter of time . &quot;
&quot; EUR 1.7 million were invested by S &amp; T in the site , 3.3 million euros from Tech@@ Center , which belongs to one third of the city of Linz , the country Upper Austria and the Bund ( FF@@ G ) . &quot;
the building is le@@ ased by the Linz AG for 60 years at S &amp; T and Tech@@ Center .
&quot; 30 percent of the 2700 square meters remaining space in the building are already rented , for another 40 percent there are requests . &quot;
Li@@ a @-@ Per@@ oni @-@ In@@ hab@@ erin opened second business in the arcade
&quot; in the new shop , Fur@@ la hand@@ bags are the centre of attention . &quot;
&quot; actually , Jutta Br@@ eit wanted to lay a dog . &quot;
&quot; this project had to post@@ p@@ one the 49 @-@ year @-@ old owner of Li@@ a Per@@ oni in the Tau@@ ben@@ markt @-@ Ark@@ ade : after all , she now got a growth in the form of another business location . &quot;
&quot; in the Fur@@ la @-@ Shop in front of the shop in which they sell bags , suit@@ cases , shoes and clothes from different manufacturers , now everything revol@@ ves around women &apos;s hand@@ bags of the brand Fur@@ la , pur@@ ses are starting at 75 euros . &quot;
larger bags and accessories cost up to € 500 .
the new shop has been in operation since yesterday .
&quot; previously , several weeks were rebuilt . &quot;
&quot; but I have long considered whether I should open a shop , &quot; &quot; says Br@@ eit . &quot;
&quot; among other things , the decision was , among other things , that Fur@@ la producers who are at home in Bologna from the idea of their own place where only their hand@@ bags were sold . &quot;
&quot; we are the only ones in the Greater Linz , who sell this stamp , &quot; says the mother of two daughters who have their own Italian roots . &quot;
her fashion interest has been given by her mother in the cra@@ dle .
I am the most when something develops and I can show new trends at affordable prices .
why so some woman when looking at a beautiful hand@@ bag in rap@@ ture is also unable to answer the specialist woman with last security .
maybe it &apos;s because a nice bag is enhanced every outfit .
the Br@@ unch Jesu@@ it from K@@ all@@ stadt
the Pf@@ äl@@ zer ancestors of Donald Tru@@ mp came from a place whose inhabitants are called An@@ ders .
this property also combines some with the billi@@ on@@ aire who wants to become US president .
Donald Tru@@ mp ( 69 ) is always good for excitement .
&quot; whether he is alien@@ ated from alien@@ ating , journalist , or knowledge gaps in international crisis policy - the applicant for the US presidential office is boo@@ sted the election campaign vigor@@ ously . &quot;
and cut off well .
&quot; this is also registered in the Pal@@ at@@ inate K@@ all@@ stadt , where the grand@@ parents of the real estate milli@@ on@@ aire come from . &quot;
the New Yorker with the fo@@ er hair@@ style is a word for many in the Win@@ zer@@ dorf on the wine route .
man@@ holes in the 1200 inhabit@@ ant place is related to him over -@@ eigh@@ ty corners .
&quot; his grand@@ father came from K@@ all@@ stadt in the Pal@@ at@@ inate : Donald Tru@@ mp , here in the election campaign mode . &quot;
the K@@ all@@ städ@@ ter Simone Wen@@ del turned a film about Tru@@ mp .
and what do the vill@@ agers think about being the most powerful man in the world ?
&quot; I think they find it somehow exciting , but are not so deeply impressed in their K@@ all@@ stad@@ ter style , &quot; says Simone Wen@@ del . &quot;
&quot; the native K@@ all@@ städ@@ ter fil@@ med an am@@ using documentary about the place and its famous offspring , to which besides Tru@@ mp the K@@ et@@ ch@@ up family Heinz counts . &quot;
&quot; Tru@@ mp , who is not known for mo@@ dest@@ y , comes in &quot; Kings of K@@ all@@ stadt &quot; ( 2014 ) - so with the statement that he would surely be successful if he would live in K@@ all@@ stadt . &quot;
he has not given it to the king of the heart .
&quot; although there is respect for the performance of the family , but also the opinion that Tru@@ mp is already a bit a big mouth , &quot; Wen@@ del says . &quot;
&quot; coinci@@ dentally , the nick@@ name , the K@@ all@@ stadt , im Um@@ kreis , &quot; Die Br@@ ull@@ jes@@ macher &quot; - too High German : the don@@ or , she says . &quot;
so Tru@@ mp comes from the village of the An@@ ders .
the Tru@@ mp &apos;s success story began in 1885 when the later grand@@ father emig@@ rated and opened a pub for gold dig@@ gers in the USA .
the cor@@ nerst@@ one of the real estate company were first real estate sales in New York .
&quot; but the life of grand@@ parents was not free of tragedy : their desire to return to their homeland in the long run , failed in the Bavarian state , to which the Pal@@ at@@ inate was part of that time . &quot;
&quot; he did not record Tru@@ mp , because he was once broken off without permission , the director of the Institute for Pal@@ at@@ inate History and Volk@@ sk@@ unde , Roland Paul , declared the start of the film . &quot;
Tru@@ mp is the grand@@ son of an &quot; illegal emig@@ rant . &quot;
this contra@@ sts with the sometimes marked claims of the descendants .
he had repeatedly appe@@ aled to Mexican immigrants in the US and demanded the construction of a boundary wall to frigh@@ ten illegal immigrants .
&quot; as the pol@@ ed , this is not so li@@ ke@@ able , &quot; says Hans @-@ Joachim Ben@@ der , a distant relative Tru@@ mp ( &quot; The O@@ ma was a born Tru@@ mp , the grand@@ pa was born Heinz &quot; ) . &quot;
&quot; the win@@ emaker in retirement sees the American rather dist@@ anced , &quot; he is always so br@@ ac@@ ing . &quot;
does he believe that Tru@@ mp is coming ?
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine that , &quot; says the 72 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;
&quot; he never took care of K@@ all@@ stadt . &quot;
&quot; the Pen@@ sions@@ vert@@ ine Ver@@ oni@@ ka Sch@@ ramm , as mentioned in some K@@ all@@ stad@@ ters , that a descend@@ ant of the Heinz family donated something for the church organ , which is generally well thank@@ ful . &quot;
&quot; this can &apos;t be imagined by Donald , &quot; says the 68 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;
&quot; it would be better if he does not cur@@ b the choice , for &quot; he has such radical views , I don &apos;t know if that is good . &quot;
&quot; if those who were in the US at the time of his grand@@ father would have been like he , &quot; he would never have arrived there . &quot; &quot;
&quot; there are more interesting topics than him , &quot; says Win@@ zer@@ to@@ chter Sarah Büh@@ ler . &quot;
and as President ?
&quot; my President is not , &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; and : &quot; &quot; the grapes are ripe without the President Tru@@ mp . &quot;
&quot; Wend@@ els Film , for whom Tru@@ mp was long inter@@ viewed , have seen 12 000 cinem@@ as , even in the USA the interest is awak@@ ened . &quot;
&quot; the Upper Bavaria community of Ram@@ s@@ au near Ber@@ cht@@ es@@ g@@ aden is Germany &apos;s first &quot; &quot; Berg@@ stei@@ ger@@ dorf &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; from the hand of the vice @-@ president at the German Alpine Club , Ludwig Wu@@ cher@@ pf@@ en@@ nig , the 1800 inhabitants village in the Ber@@ cht@@ es@@ g@@ aden National Park received the award for gentle tourism on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; in Austria , there are already 20 &quot; mountain@@ e@@ ering villages . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in the neighbouring country , the Alpine Club is responsible for awar@@ ding the award . &quot;
&quot; a &quot; &quot; mountain@@ e@@ ering village &quot; &quot; may have a maximum of 2,500 inhabitants . &quot;
at least one fifth of its area must be exp@@ elled as a reserve .
seven &apos;s Sun@@ rise domin@@ ates the reviews despite attempts by N@@ ine to take over the loss of leadership at the Today Show
&quot; Karl Stef@@ ano@@ vic and Lisa Wil@@ kin@@ son rush to Can@@ ber@@ ra to report on the loss of the leadership of the liber@@ als , but there has been no major shifts in the ratings for today . &quot;
&quot; the breakfast show by N@@ ine was broadcast by the federal capital , when Mal@@ col@@ m Turn@@ bull made the fall of Tony Ab@@ bot@@ t . &quot;
&quot; the ri@@ val Sun@@ rise , with the present@@ ers David Koch and Sam@@ an@@ tha Ar@@ my@@ tage , was part of a week @-@ long series of international television broad@@ casts , including Dubai , New York , Ni@@ ag@@ ara Falls and Can@@ cu@@ n . &quot;
&quot; the down@@ side of the board seemed to play no role for Australian TV spectators , as Sun@@ rise was average 39@@ 7,@@ 000 spectators at the five capitals , compared to today 3@@ 39@@ ,000 . &quot;
&quot; today a slight increase compared to the ratings for Monday ( 3@@ 17@@ ,000 ) and last Tuesday ( 28@@ 3,000 ) , but his number remained behind the last Thursday ( 34@@ 3,000 ) . &quot;
today the gap to sunrise has closed during the last few months .
&quot; in August Today there reached an average of 3@@ 18@@ ,000 in comparison to the 330@@ ,000 of Sun@@ rise . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the year , the distance ran between 4@@ 0,000 and 50,000 . &quot;
&quot; so far in September , Sun@@ rise is at an average of 3@@ 49@@ ,000 spectators at 3@@ 14@@ ,000 in Today . &quot;
this is the most interesting thing happening every morning .
the winds of change concern these morning people more than parliament !
&quot; Karl and Lisa are fine , thanks for the review ! &quot;

the great news for Seven was the impressive debut of 800 words with the former Seri@@ enst@@ ar of Pack@@ ed to the Raf@@ ters Erik Thom@@ son .
&quot; the new drama on a recently wit@@ ched father who decides to settle down with his two children on the coast of New Zealand , reached a very impressive figure of 1,@@ 219 million viewers . &quot;
critics were asked if Thom@@ son could wear a hit show solo without the Raf@@ ters Star Rebecca Gi@@ b@@ ney .
&quot; the result of yesterday evening answered this with a clear &quot; &quot; Yes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the X @-@ Factor of Seven remained strong with 1,@@ 136 million viewers and beat The Block ( 8@@ 38@@ ,000 ) and T@@ BL Famili@@ es ( 7@@ 26@@ ,000 ) . &quot;
seven had mixed results at night two by The Ch@@ ase Australia .
&quot; the first half hour ( 17 : 00 to 17 : 30 ) of the new qui@@ z show , moder@@ ated by Andrew O &apos; Ke@@ ef@@ e showed an average of 4@@ 46@@ ,000 spectators . &quot;
&quot; the second half hour ( 17 : 30 to 18 : 00 ) j@@ ump@@ ed to 6@@ 23@@ ,000 spectators - enough for a small victory over Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ires Hot @-@ Seat ( 6@@ 13@@ ,000 ) . &quot;
&quot; on Monday evening , the first half hour of The Ch@@ ase Australia took 5@@ 20,000 spectators and in the second half hour of 7@@ 20,000 . &quot;
&quot; hot @-@ Seat at the average 6@@ 20,000 . &quot;
the decline in the quot@@ as of the second evening of The Ch@@ ase Australia will be confident that hot @-@ seat will ultimately prevail at 17 : 30 .
the Ch@@ ase Australia is a replacement for a million dollar minute that couldn &apos;t manage the Mc@@ Gu@@ ires Show .

the last three agree : Bachelor &apos;s Sam Wood is the perfect man - but who will he choose ?
secret revealed ? ...
&quot; Lana Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows , Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki possibly have unknow@@ ingly revealed who The Bachelor wins . &quot;
&quot; the woman , eventually landing in The Bachelor at Sam Wood , was sh@@ rou@@ ded into greatest sec@@ rec@@ y . &quot;
and none of the three remaining girls will certainly not reveal whether she is the one who received the last rose .
&quot; but when we checked with Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay , S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki and Lana Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows on the day before coming out of three two , you may be acci@@ dentally given a hint about who will be the winner . &quot;
Sam Wood keeps his lips sealed until the final on Thursday
&quot; all three women have laid out in ly@@ ric ways , why wood is the perfect man and called his sense of hum@@ our , am@@ bition , family values and positive attitude as reasons for why they would like to be his partner . &quot;
&quot; however , if the question is asked &quot; If not you , who should receive W@@ oods &apos;s last rose ? , &quot; their answers could become a game of play who won the heart of the b@@ achel@@ or &apos;s heart . &quot;
Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows and Mark@@ os@@ ki both quickly realized - except themselves - M@@ ack@@ ay as the best partner for Wood .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and Sam Wood have had a simple relationship from the first day .
&quot; from the moment I went to the house and noticed Sam@@ s energies , I felt that they were pretty compatible and I thought it was pretty compatible throughout the show , &quot; said Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows . &quot;
&quot; Sarah stands on earth with both feet , it &apos;s so much fun to be together with her , &quot; &quot; said Mark@@ os@@ ki . &quot;
I have seen them together and they have the right chemistry .
they feel comfortable and comfortable together .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay believes she and Sam Wood would be well suited as a couple .
&quot; from their point of view , M@@ ack@@ ay said that last week &apos;s visit made her clear that Wood &quot; &quot; One &quot; &quot; could be . &quot;
&quot; as soon as I saw him with my friends and family , it became clear to me that this obviously isn &apos;t just a game - I am now un@@ reserv@@ edly set to him , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; and when she was asked who Wood should choose , if not she , she was pu@@ zz@@ ling . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t know if I can say that , &quot; she said . &quot;
I love the remaining girls alike - it is a draw between S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana and Lana .
&quot; the Bachelor is broadcast to Ten on Wednesday , 19 : 30 . &quot;
originally released as Sarah first choice for Sam Wood ?
Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne had several options to start his N@@ FL career .
Detroit and Seattle showed great interest after moving to the USA - and there were many other teams who sent requests following his impressive open training day at the end of last year .
but Hay@@ ne chose the San Francisco 49@@ ers and Trainer Jim Tom@@ s@@ ula and it looks like a wise decision .
some trainers would have ban@@ ished Hay@@ ne for the rest of the game to the bank when he lost a don@@ key as it did the Aus@@ sie @-@ Rugby @-@ Liga @-@ conver@@ ti@@ t at his first p@@ unt return on Tuesday at the 20 @-@ 3 victory against Minn@@ es@@ ota .
but Tom@@ s@@ ula trusted his husband and gave Hay@@ ne the next opportunity to a p@@ unt return and also in the running game after an injury of Reg@@ gie Bush .
Tom@@ s@@ ula still showed his true face in the locker room after the game .
&quot; instead of grinding his ro@@ ok@@ ies before the rest of the team through the mill , he encouraged them . &quot;
Tom@@ s@@ ula strengthened Hay@@ ne publicly at his press conference after the game .
49@@ ers Spor@@ tre@@ por@@ ter Cam In@@ man reported that Hay@@ ne was also encouraged by special team coordin@@ ator Thomas Mc@@ Gau@@ gh@@ ey who advised him to forget his p@@ inch catch and take care of the next game .
Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne p@@ atz@@ t at a p@@ unt restored in the first quarter of the Minn@@ es@@ ota Vi@@ kings
it was certainly not the start that Hay@@ ne and his massive austr@@ alian command had hoped for his N@@ FL debut .
Hay@@ ne left the playing field after the F@@ um@@ ble and later told the Australian Radio Duo Ham@@ ish &amp; Andy on 2@@ Day@@ FM 10@@ 4.1 that he couldn &apos;t imagine a worse start to his N@@ FL career .
&quot; this was a thing that happens now , you only take care of the next game , and that &apos;s it , &quot; &quot; said Hay@@ ne . &quot;
Hay@@ ne compared the Schn@@ itzer with his Orig@@ in debut at that time in 2007 when a pass at his own in @-@ Goal area led to a Tr@@ y for Que@@ ens@@ land .
&quot; overall , it was still a great experience for the 27 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;

the Free vot@@ ers demand the setting of 1000 new teachers in Bavaria because of the high number of refugees .
&quot; s &amp; D leader Hubert Ai@@ wan@@ ger warned at the beginning of the F@@ W autumn cl@@ out in Groß@@ wall@@ stadt before a serious crisis in Bavaria &apos;s schools , if there is no corresponding new teacher for the many new students : &quot; we need at least 1000 additional teachers to keep schools in front of collapse , &quot; said Ai@@ wan@@ ger . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , we will get ver@@ tices in the Bavarian education system . &quot;
the open @-@ day fraction of the Free vot@@ ers conven@@ es until Friday in the unter@@ fr@@ än@@ k@@ ische Commun@@ e .
&quot; actually , quite different main themes were planned . &quot;
but the record number of refugees is now dominated by the Free vot@@ er meeting .
&quot; of course , the topic of A@@ sy@@ l will over@@ lap the c@@ law , &quot; said Ai@@ wan@@ ger . &quot;
&quot; Ai@@ wan@@ ger called for the establishment of UN protection zones for refugees in Syria , just as it was during the Yugoslavia wars in the n@@ ine@@ ties . &quot;
&quot; so it &apos;s not going on , we have to go to the causes , &quot; said the Free vot@@ er boss . &quot;
rejected asylum seek@@ ers want to post@@ p@@ one the Free vot@@ ers as quickly as possible .
&quot; that is why Ai@@ wan@@ ger also requested more staff responsible for the administrative courts , which are responsible for asylum seek@@ ers : &quot; we also need at least 50 new asylum seek@@ ers , &quot; said Ai@@ wan@@ ger . &quot;
&quot; the F@@ W boss cri@@ tici@@ zed that several federal states were not consistent : &quot; &quot; we need uniform standards for federal states nation@@ wide . &quot;
&quot; Bavaria moves from , others not . &quot;
&quot; we need to become more effective . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; however , national politics in the city of Groß@@ wall@@ stadt should not fall under the table . &quot;
a long @-@ lasting tor@@ ch remains on the agenda : the educational policy .
&quot; for the new school year , the Minister of Culture Ludwig Sp@@ a@@ en@@ le ( CS@@ U ) started the pilot project &quot; &quot; intermediate level plus &quot; &quot; in which an extension of the high school intermediate level of three to four years is tested - in the result it takes nine years to finish . &quot;
but that is not far enough .
&quot; the topic G@@ 9 has to be accelerated , &quot; said the F@@ W boss . &quot;
we call for freedom of choice for all high school students who want this .
free travel at G@@ 9 anywhere where it is desired .
fir@@ mer Wall Street helps D@@ ax to jump on jumps
&quot; after a long distance , the German stock market has closed with profits over long distances . &quot;

solid profits also booked the trading platforms in London and Paris .
&quot; in the United States , the Dow Jones Index noted about 1 percent in the plus . &quot;
many of the stock market leaders expect the markets to be vac@@ ant until after the interest decision in the United States and also for the big failure at the terminals on this Friday .
the debate around the bur@@ dens from the nuclear phase has meanwhile pushed the shares of RW@@ E into a record low and left deep marks even at E@@ on .
&quot; according to the &quot; Spiegel , &quot; German energy companies may be missing 30 billion euros in provisions . &quot;
the German government denied the numbers mentioned in the press .
&quot; the shares of the two largest German energy companies subsequently recovered something , but ultimately lost 3,@@ 31 per cent ( RW@@ E ) and 6.@@ 15 percent ( E@@ on ) . &quot;
&quot; Infin@@ eon shares increased by another 3,@@ 22 percent on the D@@ ax tip . &quot;
&quot; according to a dealer , a positive report of the US investor magazine &quot; Bar@@ ron &apos;s &quot; appeared from the weekend . &quot;
&quot; accordingly , investors received little attention to the German chip@@ maker . &quot;
investments in future @-@ str@@ apping w@@ afer technologies and the focus on the car market should be paid off .
&quot; car values were in demand : even in the traditionally weak summer months of August , more cars were set off than in the same period last year , as the industry association AC@@ EA announced at the start of the International Motor Show I@@ AA in Frankfurt . &quot;
the papers of Daimler and BMW presented by 1.@@ 34 percent and 2.9 per cent respectively .
Volkswagen assets declined by 1.@@ 26 percent .
&quot; on the German pension market , the return loans of listed federal securities fell to 0.@@ 48 ( Friday : 0.@@ 50 ) percent . &quot;
the Re@@ x pension index increased by 0.@@ 12 percent to 13@@ 9.@@ 55 points .
&quot; the Bund @-@ Future lost 0,@@ 71 percent to 15@@ 4,@@ 11 points . &quot;
the course of the euro decreased in the afternoon to 1.@@ 12@@ 62 dollars .
&quot; at noon , the European Central Bank set the reference rate to 1,@@ 13@@ 05 ( 1,@@ 12@@ 68 ) US dollars . &quot;
&quot; the dollar thus cost 0,@@ 88@@ 46 ( 0,@@ 88@@ 75 ) Euro . &quot;

&quot; four people , including a 4 @-@ year @-@ old boy , were killed in Southern Nepal after the police kno@@ cked rubber floors into a crowd that demonstrated against the proposed new constitution , a civil servant said on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; the violence broke out on Tuesday evening in the district Rup@@ an@@ de@@ hi , about 175 miles west of the capital Kath@@ mandu . &quot;
&quot; B@@ ish@@ nu Pr@@ as@@ ad Dh@@ ak@@ al , chief district officer , said that more than 1,000 demonstr@@ ators had gathered outside a police station , some of them threw stones and fire bombs . &quot;
Mr Dh@@ ak@@ al said that the police have used tear gas and then shot into the air before moving to rubber floors .
&quot; 20 police officers and five civilians were injured , he said . &quot;
&quot; it was not immediately clear why the used rubber floors , known to them that they can kill , which are traditionally used as a less deadly alternative , obviously produced such a high death rate . &quot;
&quot; the debate was the last in weeks of violent protest in Nepal &apos;s southern pl@@ ains , where members of the ethnic group of the M@@ oll@@ i say that new provinces being formed within the proposed new constitution would reduce their political influence . &quot;
there were also protests in the western Nepal of the ethnic group of Th@@ arus who want their own state .
&quot; at least 40 people , including 11 police officers , have been in violent conflicts since the 10th . &quot;
&quot; killed in August when the four major political parties signed an agreement to divide the country into provinces - an important step towards a new constitution , but a very controversial subject in Nepal , which has been centrally governed for centuries . &quot;
&quot; working on a new constitution has been on the road since 2008 , but the legisl@@ ature accelerated the process after the devast@@ ating earthquake that killed thousands of people in April . &quot;
&quot; the legisl@@ ature approved this week on certain cl@@ auses in the constitutional draft in Kath@@ mandu , and officials said that the new constitution could enter into force on Sunday . &quot;
construction area planned in the city
the property at Em@@ den Jugend@@ zentrum Alte Post is to be rebuilt .
the city is currently preparing everything for the marketing of the 4000 square meters area .
&quot; a mix of trade , trade and living - concrete offers are not yet available . &quot;
Em@@ den - The city of Em@@ den wants to market some 4000 square meters of land in direct neighbourhood to the Jugend@@ zentrum Alte Post .
the preparations for this are underway .
&quot; it is planned to use the terrain for a mix of trade , trade and living . &quot;
&quot; waiting for appropriate offers , it is said on the part of the city . &quot;
which investor comes in demand is not yet clear .
&quot; accordingly , no contracts have been signed . &quot;
&quot; the town of Em@@ den had a part of the plot , which is located on the ring road / corner Great street , already bought a few months ago and the building can rip off . &quot;
project H@@ ieve : details are on the table
the planning for the cottage settlement on the Little Sea near Em@@ den take shape .
the investor presented publicly plans for the project for the first time .
several semi @-@ tra@@ ilers are further wor@@ rying - they fear the sale of their am@@ us@@ ement refuge
&quot; months behind closed doors was negoti@@ ated , gr@@ asp@@ ed , deb@@ ated and drawn . &quot;
now plans for a new holiday settlement on the Little Sea close to Em@@ den on the table .
&quot; the stak@@ eholder , the medium @-@ sized company Em@@ den Company &quot; System @-@ Bau , &quot; presented its plans for the first time on Monday evening in the Municipal Development Committee of the Em@@ den Council . &quot;
originally this point had stood on the non @-@ public part of the agenda .
&quot; under the pressure of the project critic and the F@@ DP parliamentary group , who repro@@ ached the investor and the administration of sec@@ rec@@ y , Ralf Be@@ hr@@ ends went to the offensive : &quot; we have not yet answered any questions , &quot; he said before the Council members and more than 50 visitors . &quot;
but it is good to meet all the rum@@ ors now .
&quot; for months , the project has been in the discussion about ten to twelve million euros . &quot;
&quot; hef@@ ty reactions among the land@@ lords who had come to the meeting , called out the pictures and new details on the desired hotel building . &quot;
&quot; Roberto Schulz , Meer@@ bu@@ den@@ Ow@@ ner and Member of the Executive Board member representing the investor , Pro H@@ ieve , compl@@ ains : &quot; this will be a giant pl@@ ot@@ z that over@@ looks all other buildings . &quot;
&quot; in addition , he fears like a number of other project critics that the traffic by the intended size of the plant would increase strongly : &quot; &quot; there must be whole bus loads , so that that pays off , &quot; &quot; said Schulz &quot;
&quot; what happens exactly on the estate of the former inn , however , is still open . &quot;
there is no operator yet .
&quot; first we have to have a coher@@ ent concept , &quot; &quot; said Ralf Be@@ hr@@ enbach . &quot;
&quot; because this still lack@@ ed , the plans are still variable . &quot;

Google launches double @-@ sided don@@ ating campaign to collect 11 million $ for refugees
&quot; Google Inc ( Goo@@ gl . O ) announced a dou@@ bling campaign calling for thousands of refugees to help thousands of refugees , as they flee from war ri@@ pped and im@@ pover@@ ished countries . &quot;
Google has an un@@ usually personal approach to disclosure of donations to his blog .
&quot; instead of making a manager the announcement , Rita Mas@@ oud wrote , a Google employee who fled with her family from Kab@@ ul when she was seven years old , about her personal experiences . &quot;
&quot; our journey included many dark railway and bus trips , as well as hunger , thirst , cold and fear , &quot; she wrote . &quot;
I was lucky .
&quot; but since the refugee and migrants crisis has grown in Europe , many people like my family are des@@ per@@ ately looking for help . &quot;
&quot; donations go to four non @-@ profit organisations providing assistance to refugees and migrants : doctors Without Bor@@ ders , International Res@@ cue Committee , Save the Children and UN High Commissioner for Refu@@ ge@@ es . &quot;
Google said that the first global funds raised up to $ 5.5 million will be doubled to $ 11 million .
&quot; Europe is faced with its worst refugee crisis since World War II , largely caused by the four @-@ year civil war in Syria , which has driven more than 4 million people this year . &quot;
&quot; many escaped from the war torn by war , Yemen , Iraq and Libya . &quot;

weight loss surgery can be helpful for easily over@@ weight di@@ abe@@ tics .
the benefits of weight loss surgery for easily over@@ weight people with type 2 diabetes may last for at least five years after a new study .
it is still too early to tell if easily over@@ weight people with diabetes after weight loss surgery live longer than those who receive non @-@ surgical treatments .
&quot; mort@@ ality data need a long time to show something , &quot; said Dr. Robin Black@@ stone , an expert of weight loss surgery , who wrote a leading article on the new study in J@@ AMA Surgery . &quot;
&quot; weight loss surgery or o@@ besity surgery , use various methods to reduce the size of stomach . &quot;
they reduce hunger and limit the body &apos;s ability to absorb food .
&quot; over the years , o@@ besity has proven to be efficient for the treatment of type 2 diabetes , but most of the studies have been performed in humans who are path@@ o@@ bes@@ e with a Body @-@ Mass @-@ Index ( BM@@ I ) of 35 or higher . &quot;
&quot; BM@@ I , a certain amount of weight regarding size , is regarded as normal between 18.5 and 24.@@ 9 . &quot;
a BM@@ I of 25 or more indicates that someone is over@@ weight and people with a BM@@ I over 30 are considered to be o@@ bes@@ e .
you can calculate your BM@@ I here : 1.@@ us@@ a.@@ gov / 1@@ D@@ 0@@ Z@@ q@@ D@@ v .
&quot; for the new study , researchers from Tai@@ w@@ ans Min @-@ Sh@@ eng General Hospital data they have been gathered in a study since 2007 and compare two kinds of o@@ besity surgery - gast@@ ric b@@ ypass and gast@@ ric tu@@ bing - for medical treatments for type 2 diabetes in people who were easily over@@ weight . &quot;
the average BM@@ I below those who undergo this surgery decreased from 31 to 24.@@ 5 to the end of the fifth year in this study .
meanwhile the BM@@ I remained with those who received non @-@ surgical diabetes treatment roughly equal to 29 .
&quot; under those who undergo a surgical procedure , 36 % of the Diabetes disease dis@@ sol@@ ves completely and partially at 28 % . &quot;
&quot; in the medical @-@ treated group , compared to this diabetes , diabetes dis@@ sol@@ ves completely only at one percent and in some cases only approximately two percent . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the results in blood pressure , tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de and &quot; bad &quot; L@@ DL Cholester@@ ins &quot; generally were better in the &quot; surgical &quot; group , &quot; the authors found out . &quot;
the researchers also super@@ vised the patient blood level of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c which reflects blood glucose levels over time .
&quot; hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c is best kept below 7 percent , write the researchers . &quot;
&quot; after the operation , the average ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c decreased by around 9 percent to around 6 percent . &quot;
&quot; however , it remained stable at around 8 percent in the medical therapy group . &quot;
&quot; but this better &quot; gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control &quot; - as reflected in the improved hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c level - did not reduce mort@@ ality in five years , so the leading researcher Dr. Chi@@ h @-@ Ch@@ eng H@@ su and his colleagues . &quot;
the research team also provides average results with the two types of surgery .
&quot; in the fifth year , the B@@ ypass surgery group lost more weight compared to the Gast@@ re@@ kt@@ omy group ( 18.@@ 7 vs. 14.@@ 2 kg ) , reaching larger returns in BM@@ I ( 7.3 against 5.1 ) and hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c ( 3.1 % vs. 16.@@ 7 % ) . &quot;
&quot; while the new study does not show survival benefit of the surgery after five years , there is evidence from a study of he@@ avier people in Sweden that surgery leads to a longer life , says Black@@ stone from the University of Arizona , College of Medicine Phoenix . &quot;
&quot; in the Swedish study it was in o@@ bes@@ e people who undergo an o@@ besity surgery , about 29 percent less likely to die over the course of 15 years - compared to a group that tried more conventional methods . &quot;
&quot; although the new study showed no advantage for survival in the surgery patients , Black@@ stone said it was so@@ othing for people with a BM@@ I under 35 who are interested in the procedure . &quot;
&quot; this is the critical point of this study because it says that this operation is lower in this lower BM@@ I group , &quot; without increased risk of death or kidney disease , she said . &quot;
&quot; Black@@ stone added that people and their doctors should start taking weight seriously once the patient lies with his BM@@ I , between 27 and 30 . &quot;
&quot; I think we are waiting for too long until we bring people to take this seriously , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; I think once they have accumulated these genetic changes , which have firmly joined their bodies with o@@ besity and diabetes , a revers@@ al is really hard . &quot;
love story plays in H@@ uns@@ r@@ ück
&quot; it is an issue that is increasingly important in fiction : a young woman , at school times un@@ popular and un@@ si@@ ghtly , meets the flock of her youth after years , and this falls in love with her . &quot;
&quot; so even in the recent novel &quot; &quot; Ac@@ tu@@ ally we are not so &quot; &quot; by Lu@@ isa B@@ inder . &quot;
&quot; beyond the love story , the novel is likely to be interesting especially for H@@ uns@@ dor@@ er readers , because he plays in Lang@@ weiler and the surrounding villages . &quot;
the main professional author was raised in Lang@@ weiler and is pleased that she could put a literary monument to her hom@@ etown .
&quot; it is impossible for everyone to come to Europe &quot; &quot; - Dalai Lama - RT @-@ News &quot;
&quot; Europe cannot take up all the refugees , said the Dalai Lama , and added that the real solution of the refugee crisis in the Middle East broke out . &quot;
the Tibetan Buddhist leaders insist@@ ed on ending violence in the home countries of the refugees .
the Dalai Lama addressed the issue of the ongoing refugee crisis at the beginning of his ten day visit to the United Kingdom in his speech at the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Com@@ passion in Oxford which devot@@ es himself to ethics studies .
he demanded that under the circumstances the interests of humanity should be placed before the interests of the individual nations or even continents .
&quot; he also stressed that the reaction of Western European countries to the refugee crisis is ad@@ mi@@ red , but the situation is not appropriate . &quot;
&quot; it is impossible that everyone can come to Europe , &quot; he said in his speech . &quot;
&quot; although the Dalai Lama praised Germany and Austria &apos;s efforts in tac@@ kling the crisis , he emphas@@ ised that there was only a temporary solution . &quot;
&quot; to take care of several thousand refugees is wonderful , but in the meantime you need to think about long @-@ term solutions , such as a true peace and genuine development , mainly through education , for these Muslim countries , &quot; he stressed . &quot;
&quot; in the end , we need to think about how the killing is reduced in their countries . &quot;
we must reduce the use of violence .
&quot; the use of violence never solved these problems , &quot; he added . &quot;
the Dalai Lama addressed the problem of violence and commented on George Bush &apos;s action following the terrorist attack of September 11 and stated that the violent reaction of the US pulled a chain of un@@ controll@@ able events .
&quot; after September 11 , I expressed my con@@ dol@@ ences in a letter to President Bush , and I told him the way to resolve this problem is non@@ violence . &quot;
&quot; I know his motives were good , but he used violence and this has caused unexpected consequences , &quot; &quot; said the Dalai Lama . &quot;
four @-@ fold increase in the intake of dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants by children over the last 4 years
&quot; po@@ ison control centres in the USA report on an almost 400 percent increase in the number of children under twelve years , which swal@@ low strong alcoholic and hand dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants , such as the Georgia Po@@ ison Center . &quot;
&quot; according to Dr. Gay@@ lord Lop@@ ez , Director of Georgia Compar@@ ison Center , the cases of income of dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants in children under the age of 12 reported that po@@ ison control centres reported , from 3,@@ 266 in 2010 to 16.@@ 117 in 2014 . &quot;
&quot; children are increasingly coming to these products , and unfortunately a percentage of them go in emergency , &quot; &quot; said Lop@@ ez CN@@ N . &quot;
&quot; he said that some children drink dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants inten@@ tionally , while some do it to impress their friends or because of a mut@@ ation in the social media . &quot;
show videos on YouTube just like adol@@ escents to drink dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants just because of a cheap experience .
young people are supposed to mix dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants with alcohol @-@ containing mouth@@ wash to obtain a harder drink .
younger children can be lu@@ red from attractive fragrances of dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants .
&quot; a child does not think that this is bad for it , &quot; &quot; said Lop@@ ez . &quot;
many of the more attractive ( hand dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants ) are those who are perf@@ um@@ ed .
&quot; there are dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants with straw@@ berry , grapes and orange scent , which are very appealing for children . &quot;
dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants contain between 45 and 95 percent alcohol .
&quot; especially with small children , a few sy@@ ring@@ es can lead to alcohol in@@ toxic@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; it is highly concentrated alcohol , &quot; said Dr. Stephen Thor@@ n@@ ton , medical director of the toxic@@ ant emergency centre at the Hospital of the University of K@@ ans@@ as , the Fox 4 in kan@@ sa City . &quot;
&quot; so you wouldn &apos;t leave a si@@ p whis@@ ky around , but people leave this hand dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ant within reach of children , and when children get there , then it is a quick way to consume a lot of alcohol . &quot;
&quot; N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah Rus@@ sell , a six @-@ year @-@ old girl , who recently had four sy@@ ring@@ es from after straw@@ berry sc@@ ented hand@@ some dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants in the school , was taken in an emergency room for treatment . &quot;
&quot; her blood alcohol concentration was 179 , twice higher than the threshold that was legally considered by an adult , Dr. Chris R@@ IT@@ CHE@@ Y , a emergency medical doctor who treated her in the G@@ winn@@ ett Medical Center outside of Atlanta . &quot;
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah laugh@@ ed her words and was unable to go when she arrived in the emergency room .
&quot; doctors monitored them overnight in a separate children &apos;s hospital for signs of brain trau@@ ma , as the girl fell through the alcohol and had hit the head , R@@ IT@@ CHE@@ Y said . &quot;
&quot; this was very frigh@@ tening , &quot; said Pre@@ toria Scott , N@@ ha@@ i@@ j@@ jah &apos;s mother , CN@@ N . &quot;
it could have been fatal for my child .
Lop@@ ez has recommended parents and teachers to use alcohol @-@ free products or dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants and store hand dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants outside the reach of the child .
&quot; beyond alcohol in@@ toxic@@ ation , some dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants were associated with fat@@ alities . &quot;
&quot; in 2013 two women died in Ont@@ ario women after the swal@@ lowing of dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants , which contained a toxic , non @-@ declared ingredient . &quot;
&quot; health authorities susp@@ ect that the product contained meth@@ anol , a le@@ thal solution rather than ethylene gly@@ col , which was listed as active ingredient . &quot;
&quot; in January , three students of the fourth class in the State of New York decided to po@@ ison their &quot; common &quot; teacher by expos@@ ing anti@@ bacterial products around the classroom , &quot; says a police report . &quot;
the teacher is highly allergic to hand dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants and ex@@ iled them from their room .
&quot; the police regarded the regim@@ ented plan as &quot; &quot; wounds &quot; &quot; and proved disciplinary action against the school authority . &quot;

Adam Ro@@ on@@ ey &apos;s El@@ f@@ meter in the first half @-@ time gave Aber@@ de@@ en a short victory over Hamilton in Pit@@ to@@ dri@@ e so that the D@@ ons create a five @-@ point gap between himself and Celtic .
Griff@@ i@@ ths is playing talk about di@@ shar@@ mon@@ y
&quot; there are rum@@ ors about Dish@@ ar@@ mon@@ ie at Celtic Glasgow , which was rejected by Griff@@ i@@ ths . this insist@@ ed that he and his team mates were not under increased control , as they prepare for the con@@ frontation with the Dutch leader . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t think we feel under pressure , I think the players look forward to it . &quot;
the lack of title competition in Scottish football is bor@@ ed Dut@@ ch@@ man - de Bo@@ er
&quot; former Rang@@ ers Mittel@@ feld@@ player and former national player of the Netherlands Ron@@ ald de Bo@@ er said that Dutch football fans have lost interest in Celtic , there is no title ri@@ val@@ ry with the Rang@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; de Bo@@ er , currently an ambassador for Ajax , said : &quot; in Holland do they show no cli@@ max@@ es of the Celtic Games more and why ? &quot;
it is because the Rang@@ ers are not there .
people here don &apos;t just talk about the return of the leader@@ ships .
they talk about the Old Firm .
they talk about both teams and that &apos;s what they are interested in .
&quot; there is a lot of excitement in the Old @-@ Firm games , and not only the people in Scotland who want to see these games . &quot;
&quot; I will turn things around , s@@ wear Dei@@ la . &quot;
&quot; Ron@@ ny Dei@@ la has accepted that Celtic must fight , but the Norwegian boss s@@ wore to turn things around . &quot;
&quot; after the defeat against Malm@@ ö and the subsequent withdrawal from the Champions League , defeat against 10 @-@ man from Aber@@ de@@ en , which now stands at the top of the table with five points . &quot;
&quot; Dei@@ la said , &quot; &quot; Celtic already had bad times before , and we will come back . &quot;
now we want to come out as soon as possible .
&quot; I know it &apos;s very fru@@ str@@ ating and a lot of people are very , very angry or sad about what has happened . &quot;
we feel this exactly like that - but we have to go on .
&quot; we really need the support of Celtic , because that makes the players better . &quot;
standing together is so important .
W@@ arb@@ ur@@ ton carefully with January transfers
&quot; despite his comments just a few weeks ago , indicating that he made some January transfers , Rang@@ ers boss Mark W@@ arb@@ ur@@ ton is careful in the signing of new accessible and insist@@ ing that he does not want to inter@@ fere with the unity of the I@@ bro@@ x . &quot;
&quot; the ex boss of Br@@ ent@@ ford said : &quot; &quot; the January transfer window is very different from the summer window . &quot;
players coming in the summer have this pre @-@ season time to incorporate what you have seen with our own group this season .
the team is really good .
sometimes more damage is done by adding unnecessary players to what you really need .

&quot; Mc@@ Inn@@ es said , &quot; There is no team that has won everything , in poker games or likes that have not won the games of this kind . &quot;
unemployment in Scotland remains unchanged as it climb@@ s in the United Kingdom altogether .
&quot; unemployment in Scotland remained unchanged from May to July at 16@@ 4,000 , while the number of people without labor for the United Kingdom as a whole rose from 10,000 to 1.@@ 82 million in the same period . &quot;
Scotland &apos;s unemployment rate of 5.9 percent was over that of the U@@ K@@ s of 5.5 percent as the figures of the Office for National Statistics ( ON@@ S ) showed .
&quot; in the meantime , the employment in Scotland fell by 12@@ ,000 during the three months , with the number of employees at 2,@@ 6@@ 12@@ ,000 . &quot;
&quot; over the course of the quarter , the employment rate for Scotland fell to 7@@ 4.0 percent - a number above the UK average of 7@@ 3.5 percent . &quot;
&quot; Secretary of State for Scotland David Mund@@ ell commented on the latest figures and said : &quot; &quot; the long @-@ term plan of the government has laid the foundation for a stronger economy . &quot;
it &apos;s almost exactly a year ago that Scotland has made the historical decision to remain part of the United Kingdom .
&quot; in these 12 months , we have experienced further improvements in the Scottish labour market with an increase in employment and a drop in unemployment . &quot;

why I become a witness to an execution in O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma
&quot; a little later today , except in a late legal intervention , I will see how a man is brought to death . &quot;
&quot; when it happens , and I hope it will not happen , I will sit in a spect@@ ator gallery in the death chamber in the O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma State Pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary when Richard Glos@@ si@@ p is executed by the injection sy@@ ringe . &quot;
he asked me to be one of the four official witnesses to his death .
&quot; the invitation was already made for the first time in January about his best friend , and although I was shock@@ ed I agreed . &quot;
&quot; when the day drew near , I began to fear . &quot;
so why should I do it ?
&quot; I agreed , because I thought it would be a good way to tell the whole story about the death penalty . &quot;
it would provide a unique perspective .
&quot; it is true that journalists are allowed to see exec@@ utions in the US , and since more applications are available as places , there is a mac@@ ab@@ ere lot@@ tery to decide who is elected . &quot;
O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma has reduced the number of media slots from 12 to five .
&quot; who is selected , it will be emotion@@ less observ@@ able . &quot;
I cannot .
I will sit next to Richard Glos@@ si@@ ps closest friend with whom I developed my own relationship over the months with teleph@@ ones and a two and a half hour visit .

we often laugh a lot when we speak .
&quot; the prison authorities say that I can &apos;t be a witness and a journalist , so I will not be allowed to take a not@@ ebook and pen , to record what I see . &quot;
I just have to try to remember all the details .
a journalist from O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma accused me of posting my im@@ parti@@ ality .
here is the lesson .
tell the story of how he wants it and you get access .
I &apos;ll compl@@ ain with her .
&quot; she adm@@ its that &quot; &quot; it could have been better formulated , &quot; &quot; but she still thinks it &apos;s wrong what I do . &quot;
Richard Glos@@ si@@ p had a problem with some of the things I said and written .
&quot; he doesn &apos;t tell me what I have to write , and I wouldn &apos;t do it even if he would do it . &quot;
I told him that he can remove me from his list of witnesses at any time .
but he wants an international repor@@ ter to be present to write there .
&quot; when he dies , he thinks that the public relations will help the movement against the death penalty . &quot;
&quot; Kim Bell@@ ware , a repor@@ ter at Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post , will sit next to me . &quot;
&quot; if you want to know more about the case , please hear the series of pod@@ casts that I have made . &quot;
I don &apos;t want to go here again to all the details .
I cannot say with certainty that Richard Glos@@ si@@ p is innocent .
his actions after the assass@@ ination of Barry Van Tre@@ ese would owe him guilty to be a benef@@ ici@@ ary .
but I believe that a strong chance is that he is not guilty of murder .
I &apos;m sure there is not enough evidence to justify a death sentence .
I believe his execution is false .
and from this perspective I will see him dying .
I cannot claim to be really obj@@ ectively .
there will be other repor@@ ters that you can turn to .
what you will get from me is what it means to see a man dying out of unnecessary death .
man after dam@@ p police ch@@ ase persu@@ ades to get out of the C@@ anning River
the C@@ anning V@@ ale Polic@@ eman was dry when he talked about the man from the C@@ anning River .
&quot; a man from Per@@ th to hang out the police was un@@ successful when he was in shallow and sw@@ amp@@ y water , just a few meters away from a police officer who tried to persu@@ ade him to return to the shore . &quot;
the police of C@@ anning V@@ ale was called into Becken@@ ham on Tuesday .
&quot; when they discovered the susp@@ ect , he tried to escape them in the direction of C@@ anning River . &quot;
but he did not come too far .
&quot; he stood in water and said &apos; I &apos;m not coming out , come and get me , &quot; said Senior Serge@@ ant S@@ hand@@ ell Cast@@ led@@ ine . &quot;
&quot; Con@@ stable Lach@@ lan Per@@ have@@ c was not too enthusiastic about making his uniform wet , so he turned a more reliable tac@@ tic - &quot; A good polic@@ eman negoti@@ ates . &quot; &quot;
&quot; sometimes people do funny things to try to escape , &quot; said Senior Serge@@ ant Cast@@ led@@ ine . &quot;
master football player Ben C@@ ous@@ ins offers an unforgettable example .
&quot; in 2006 , cous@@ ins drove his car into the dit@@ ch to avoid alcohol check and then tried to swim over the S@@ wan River . &quot;
his efforts were un@@ successful but inspired locals to the hum@@ orous planning of a Ben C@@ ous@@ ins Bi@@ athlon .
Peter Moo@@ dy claims that st@@ ew@@ ards tried to spy on him and threat@@ ens to end racing
Peter Moo@@ dy claims that st@@ ew@@ ards from Racing Victoria tried to install a spy in his st@@ ables last year and threatened to stop the race right away .
&quot; he aimed at the Stew@@ ards and the integrity department of Racing Victoria and claimed that she conducted a personal campaign against him with the L@@ ate Scr@@ at@@ ching by Lady Tat@@ ai because of a race day treatment , the last straw on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; Moo@@ dy said , Fair@@ fax Media , that he always tried to do what is best for racing and he found himself under difficult conditions when it was about the positive cob@@ alt T@@ up@@ a probe near Li@@ dar@@ is , which he cannot explain . &quot;
&quot; he had kept himself back 18 months because of the sp@@ ying accus@@ ations and did not want it to &quot; &quot; look like too high hanging grapes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I had nothing to say about it and I &apos;ve been eating for a long time , but sometimes you are so fru@@ str@@ ated that everything comes out at once , &quot; &quot; said Moo@@ dy . &quot;
they know that it continued .
&quot; sometimes you react , and you have to live with the consequences and I have to live with it what I said . &quot;
I will go home tonight and sleep well .
&quot; I would like to go around the head , and I want my owners to think that I try my best for them . &quot;
&quot; when they start thinking , I don &apos;t do that , then I should not be a trainer . &quot;
I have to think about what I do with my license .
&quot; previously , Moo@@ dy had let the bomb rise in an interview with rac@@ ing.com that the integrity department had tried to spy on its stable . &quot;
&quot; eighte@@ en months Terr@@ y Bail@@ ey , Day@@ le Brown and Dr. Brian Stew@@ art were sitting in a room with a man - whom I &apos;m going to name - and offered him an occupation in my st@@ ables to provide information about what I &apos;m doing within my st@@ ables , &quot; &quot; said Moo@@ dy on rac@@ ing.com . &quot;
they seem to believe that I am a decei@@ ver .
&quot; if that is the case , they should certainly touch their n@@ oses , because they have failed to believe me . &quot;
&quot; Robert Rou@@ l@@ ston , former Chairman of the RV@@ L , David Moo@@ die , acting president of the RV@@ L and Bernard Sa@@ undry , current CEO of RV@@ L , were aware of this at the time and are still today . &quot;
should I bring it to the view that it will be personally ?
&quot; has the RV@@ L beha@@ ves co@@ war@@ dly , and maybe people outside trainers are responsible for what &apos;s going on in the industry ? &quot;
am I bad for the industry ?
am I so bad for the industry ?
maybe people out there that I am .
&quot; maybe they have to take my license and viol@@ ate me , and I have no doubt that what I say is to think about it now . &quot;
but I am now at the point where that doesn &apos;t matter and that makes me sad .
that makes me really sad .
I will put pressure on them and push them to make a decision .
I have the support of my family and I can go .
&quot; the fru@@ str@@ ations @-@ levels of the trainer have built up with the long @-@ lasting cob@@ alt study at Li@@ dar@@ i , and the L@@ ate Scr@@ at@@ ching conducted that he could throw his license over the table . &quot;
&quot; Moo@@ dy , best known for its preparation of the un@@ beaten master black Caviar , described the race @-@ treatment rule &quot; ridi@@ cul@@ ous , &quot; after a pack of slu@@ dge or clay had been applied to the horse &apos;s debate , which viol@@ ated the rules . &quot;
&quot; it is against the rules of racing .
&quot; I have to take full responsibility for it , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; one of my collabor@@ ators mistakenly put mud on the leg .
it could have been so last night .
it could have been the whole day as it was .
but it had it so on the race day .
Moo@@ dy could be faced with a three @-@ month dis@@ qualification for the treatment with the pack on the race day . an investigation of this matter has been opened .
it is a joke .
people who set up these rules don &apos;t know about the horse .
&quot; we all see that we need rules , but here you have gone too far , &quot; &quot; said Moo@@ dy . &quot;
man was arrested after a driver &apos;s flight
the police arrested a man after a clas@@ h with a cycl@@ ist and a driver cur@@ sed in Cob@@ ham on the weekend .
&quot; the cycl@@ ist was delivered with the helicop@@ ter to the Royal Melbourne Hospital with serious injuries , after he was hit by a car on Saturday morning on the Mur@@ ray Valley motorway . &quot;
the police said the driver drove further without stopping to help the injured driver .
on Monday there was a 50 year old man from Nath@@ alia the police in Sh@@ ep@@ part@@ on .
he is expected to be indic@@ ted for driver cur@@ ses and sub@@ class assistance and for other traffic off@@ ences .

Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Cra@@ ig Bell@@ amy goes back against ri@@ vals because of claims to ring struggles
Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Cra@@ ig Bell@@ amy has called criticism of the tac@@ kling of his players as &quot; Agenda @-@ Setting &quot; by two Premier League favorites of the RL .
Sydney R@@ oo@@ sters Trainer Tr@@ ent Robinson said that the ump@@ ires have allowed the Storm players &quot; ring competitions &quot; with his team during the high Storm contest in Sydney on Friday evening .
Bris@@ bane Bron@@ co Trainer Way@@ ne Benn@@ ett made a little disgu@@ ised comment to the Storm Team after his team had achieved the Final victory against North Que@@ ens@@ land Cow@@ boys on Saturday evening and said that the two from Que@@ ens@@ land were not &quot; too good &quot; in the rings .
Bell@@ amy def@@ ended the T@@ ack@@ li@@ mg of his team and said they were only focused on their &quot; contact &quot; at the tac@@ kling .
&quot; Bell@@ amy added that the criticism of two leading trainers in his team conc@@ lusi@@ vely agree that they were worried that they were worried , to be beaten by the Storm Team . &quot;
&quot; that appears again and again - I did not hear Tr@@ ent Robinson rep@@ lied about the fights , when she met us 24 : 2 , &quot; said Bell@@ amy on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; I can guarantee that we have not changed anything from our def@@ ensive system or the techniques throughout the year , but in the last six weeks we have made our contact with Tac@@ kling a real focus and this has provided the trend revers@@ al for us . &quot;
Tr@@ ent has been there for three years now and he obviously has a great team to train .
it &apos;s funny as this happens again and again at this time of the year .
&quot; Bell@@ amy has attacked Benn@@ etts an idea of &quot; exciting football , &quot; and reminded his ment@@ or that Benn@@ etts St George Il@@ la@@ war@@ ra Dragons won the Premier League in 2010 with &quot; boring &quot; football . &quot;
Way@@ ne speaks of exciting football .
&quot; he compared his game on Saturday evening with our Friday evening and how exciting her game was , &quot; &quot; said Bell@@ amy . &quot;
&quot; I remember that in 2010 St George was cri@@ tici@@ zed as a boring team , and Way@@ ne said that he will take care of a divor@@ ce . &quot;
&quot; but now he has a team that can play and that we consider exciting , especially his young players with their speed . &quot;
this is the ball game you want to play if you have this kind of players .
&quot; he made this statement in 2010 , now he wants everyone to play his kind of football - not every team has two players like Anthony Mil@@ ford and Ben H@@ unt so they can play like these . &quot;
I build stronger confidence because they say these things because they are a bit worried about playing against us .
&quot; six weeks ago , they did not think of us when it was about the big games . &quot;
Bell@@ amy also pointed out that the Storm against R@@ oo@@ sters improved a higher result than the game Bron@@ cos against cow@@ boys .
&quot; the game of the Bron@@ cos was probably a good game , I haven &apos;t seen it yet , but what was the result ? 16 : 12 ? &quot;
&quot; our game was 20 : 18 , there were two more attempts in our game , but is that an exciting game ? &quot;
or are they doing breaks and do not have any points of tension ?
for me it is the sched@@ ules .
&quot; if they mention us , it means that in one phase we will meet them . &quot;
&quot; the Storm Team has released this weekend , as they won the right to receive either North Que@@ ens@@ land Cow@@ boys or C@@ ron@@ ul@@ la Shar@@ ks on the next Saturday evening in the A@@ AM@@ I Park . ticket sales begin next Tuesday morning . &quot;
&quot; Serbia with 200,000 $ damage on drug traff@@ icking &quot;
&quot; a man who possibly threat@@ ens a life @-@ long punishment because of his attempt to come into possession of 40 kilo@@ grams of co@@ ca@@ ine , which was sm@@ ug@@ gled after Que@@ ens@@ land , was released against a deposit of $ 200,000 . &quot;
&quot; Mark@@ o Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c , 29 , was one of the five men who were arrested last month after the Federal Police met 100 kg of the drug on the yacht Sol@@ ay , who came from South America via Van@@ u@@ atu and transferred to Co@@ om@@ era in August . &quot;
Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c was observed how he met his co @-@ def@@ end@@ ants in the marina during the morning and later in the Café Co@@ om@@ era Road@@ house where the police found 40 kilo@@ grams of the drug in a Toyota Echo .
&quot; despite a possibly viable sentence for the attempt to possess a commercial volume of co@@ ca@@ ine , the lawyer of Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c argu@@ ed that there was no evidence that he tried to possess the whole amount and that in the café he could have been a harmless reason . &quot;
&quot; the judge at the Supreme Court , Peter Flan@@ ag@@ an , was concerned about the danger of escape from Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c . &quot;
he has clear relations with Serbia .
he often travels to Serbia and declared the court on Wednesday .
&quot; in the case of criminal cases , he lied to the police about his where@@ ab@@ outs . &quot;
Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic@@ s mother and step@@ father had offered a deposit of 200.000 dollars as security together to achieve his release .
&quot; after reading the aff@@ id@@ av@@ able statements of the two persons it is clear that the circulation of a security of 200,000 dollars is a real financial burden , &quot; said Richter Flan@@ ag@@ an . &quot;
&quot; but that alone will not suff@@ ice to prevent him from appearing , he warned . &quot;
&quot; Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c was released on deposit , under the conditions that he aband@@ ons his Australian and his Serbian passport , reported to the police every day and adher@@ es to a cur@@ few from 18 : 00 @-@ 06 : 00 . &quot;
accident on A5 at Karlsruhe : driver &apos;s cab out@@ lines apart
&quot; on Tuesday evening , a truck driver has been seriously injured during an accident with three trucks on the motorway 5 at Karlsruhe . &quot;
two of the three trucks participated in front of a permanent installation in the direction of Basel .
&quot; the third driver noticed it too late , trying in vain to ev@@ ade the police in the last moment , as the police hur@@ ried . &quot;
the driver &apos;s cab was completely torn apart .
the driver was seriously injured in a hospital .
the A5 between Bru@@ chs@@ al and Karlsruhe @-@ Nord was completely closed over six hours to 2 o &apos;clock .
&quot; there was a damage in the amount of 12@@ 2,000 euros . &quot;
St@@ ev@@ an H@@ og@@ g used phone from girls to l@@ ure p@@ ests to send images
a p@@ enny @-@ iler used the telephone of a 11 year old girl to request pictures of child abuse .
&quot; St@@ ev@@ an H@@ og@@ g took the phone of the girl , when she slept , got into an online mess@@ aging service , from which he received a series of in@@ decent images of children sent to him by another user . &quot;
the girl wo@@ ke up later and discovered that the phone was missing and found it in the hands of the sleeping h@@ og@@ g .
&quot; she saw it through , found the conf@@ using messages and immediately al@@ armed her mother . &quot;
&quot; the police took care of it and saw the five pictures , analysed computers that were found under the address and discovered &quot; &quot; web research &quot; , &quot; which used terms for searching for in@@ decent images of children . &quot;
&quot; H@@ og@@ g then claimed to the officials that he had done it , as it would lead to &quot; p@@ ests on the internet , &quot; and he &quot; pre@@ tended to be a polic@@ eman to frigh@@ ten them . &quot;
the prosec@@ utor E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Rober@@ t@@ son said the Dun@@ dee Sh@@ eri@@ ff Court : &quot; he said it would be a ad@@ diction - that he is addic@@ ted to frigh@@ ten people .
&quot; he admitted that searches on the computer were carried out by him , but said it was done because he wanted to pret@@ end to be a polic@@ eman to frigh@@ ten p@@ ests . &quot;
&quot; he was asked about his conversation with the unknown person , who sent him the pictures and asked him to send even more photos . &quot;
he said he did it to l@@ ure her .
&quot; he said he was sick in his head when he drinks , and said he wanted to see images of rape and murder . &quot;
MS Rober@@ t@@ son added : &quot; when the girl found the news on the phone she called her mother and was on trem@@ bling and crying .
she then saw the un@@ decent images on the phone and confronted the def@@ end@@ ant with it .
the girl was inter@@ viewed and said that the def@@ end@@ ant computer and Play@@ station used to talk to girls who looked much younger than he .
&quot; H@@ og@@ g , 23 , W@@ ard Road , Dun@@ dee , ple@@ aded guilty in the sense of the indictment , to have viol@@ ated incomplete pictures of children on 14 June last year , and not to have appeared before the court for a hearing on 24 March this year . &quot;
&quot; defence lawyer Gregor S@@ im asked that H@@ og@@ g did not appear in the register of sexual offen@@ ders , since one could argue that &quot; no substantial sexual element &quot; in his transgres@@ sion could be found . &quot;
Sh@@ eri@@ ff A@@ list@@ air Car@@ mi@@ ch@@ ael shifted the ver@@ dict to October to get background reports on social work .
&quot; H@@ og@@ g was granted a deposit in this case , but was kept in custo@@ dy for hear@@ ings to other cases . &quot;
he was added to the directory of sexual crimes before the date of judgment .
people switch to Germany on small border cross@@ ings
more and more refugees are taken up from the large control points at the German @-@ Austrian border .
many Schle@@ user reli@@ ed on smaller border cross@@ ings due to fear of discovery and sei@@ z@@ ure .
&quot; on the Austrian side , a spokes@@ man of the Federal Police said . &quot;
&quot; along the river river Inn , more than 1000 refugees have been taken up in the districts of Pass@@ au and Rot@@ tal @-@ Inn since Tuesday . &quot;
they were on foot over bridges and shr@@ u@@ bs to the German side .
there they are received from the Federal Police and for@@ warded to the registration .
&quot; at the Munich Central Station , the Federal Police saw significantly more refugees in comparison to the start of the weekend on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; some 700 people arrived in the state capital alone until 8 : 00 a.m. , a spokes@@ man said in the morning . &quot;
&quot; after the re @-@ establishment of controls on the German @-@ Austrian border , 17@@ 59 refugees had reached the city . &quot;
Stuttgart : dro@@ mes of Trop@@ enst@@ ur@@ m &quot; Henry &quot; expected in the Sou@@ thwest
meteor@@ ologists warn against wind trage@@ dies in the south @-@ west from Wednesday afternoon .
&quot; due to a low @-@ pressure area across Western Europe , warm sea air flows into the country , the German weather service ( D@@ WD ) shared in Stuttgart . &quot;
&quot; the vigor@@ ous low was the prec@@ ursor of the tropical storm &quot; Henry , &quot; which was pulled over the Atlantic in the past few days . &quot;
fierce stor@@ ms and thunder@@ stor@@ ms are mainly expected in Baden .
&quot; according to D@@ WD , the Black Forest is also expected to count on the Schw@@ ä@@ bisch Al@@ b and at the bottom of the sea with Bö@@ en from 60 to 90 hours . &quot;
on Friday the sun can be seen again .
the mass makes it : every two years the autom@@ akers are showing their novel@@ ties at the I@@ AA .
&quot; in 2015 , there is a movement among the compact cars , which are currently being sold particularly well . &quot;
&quot; cars from the compact class are currently in demand : around 28.@@ 1 percent of new registrations , according to the power drive federal office ( KBA ) , fell to this segment alone in August alone . &quot;
this is reflected also at the I@@ AA ( public days 17 to 27 September ) .
&quot; this year , many new compact models will be presented between all the fut@@ uris@@ tic conceptual vehicles and new luxury cars . &quot;
&quot; one of the biggest premier@@ es for the German automotive industry is the Opel Astra , which will be at deal@@ er@@ ships in autumn . &quot;
&quot; the Astra is an extremely important model for us , &quot; said Opel CEO Karl @-@ Thomas Neumann at the fair . &quot;
it belongs to the core of the brand .
&quot; in order for the volume model to be sold well , the new Astra will not be much more expensive . &quot;
Opel introduces its entry beneath the biggest competi@@ tor VW Golf in a view that starts at 17 650 euros .
the current Astra will cost from 16 990 euros .
the Astra is available with a new 1.4 @-@ liter engine with 74 kW / 100 hp .
&quot; in addition , H@@ esse offers additional diesel and gasoline engines of 70 kW / 95 hp to 147 kW / / 200 hp , for which three @-@ cylinder gasoline engines are also included . &quot;
&quot; unlike the most important competitors VW Golf and Ford Focus , Opel Astra is available only as one fifth . &quot;
&quot; the second variant will follow in spring of the com@@ bi , which is already visible at the I@@ AA . &quot;
and what will be put on new compact cars next to the Astra at the I@@ AA ?
Renault Mé@@ gan@@ e : Renault sends the fourth generation of its Astra competi@@ tor to the race .
&quot; at the fair , the Mé@@ gan@@ e can only be seen as a fifth in a conventional and acc@@ entu@@ ated GT version . &quot;
&quot; in trade , at the beginning of next year , he will also come as a com@@ bi . &quot;
Infin@@ iti : brand new in the segment is Infin@@ iti Q@@ 30 .
&quot; with the new model , the Nissan @-@ off@@ shoot will find its position in the strongly growing segment . &quot;
the compact Infin@@ iti with its curved lines fits perfectly into the brand &apos;s design line .
the basic model will receive a gasoline engine with an output of at least 90 kW / 122 hp .
but there is also a diesel with 80 kW / 109 hp or 125 kW / 170 hp .
Suzuki Bal@@ eno : new in the segment is also the Suzuki Bal@@ eno to celebrate its world premiere in Frankfurt .
&quot; the model is offered with gasoline engines , including a newly developed 1.0 litre tur@@ bo engine and an output of 82 kW / 111 hp . &quot;
the maximum torque is due to manufacturer &apos;s declar@@ ations at 170 New@@ ton meters ( Nm ) .
sales launch of the bal@@ eno in Europe will be launched in spring 2016 .
&quot; DS 4 : not brand new , but completely renewed , the compact class model DS 4 , which is visible at the I@@ AA . &quot;
&quot; outside , the designers of the noble Citro@@ ë@@ n @-@ Ab@@ leg@@ ers placed an emphasis on the front part : the radiator gr@@ ille was re @-@ drawn and the modified head@@ lights are equipped with LED technology . &quot;
&quot; in the interior , the inf@@ ot@@ ain@@ ment system was moderni@@ zed , the number of buttons is reduced by a touch@@ screen and integrates Ap@@ ples Car@@ Play for the first time . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the I@@ AA in the compact class features a number of re@@ visions and new variants as the refres@@ hed Mercedes A @-@ Class or Peugeot 308 GT@@ I . &quot;
J@@ VA Berlin @-@ Te@@ gel : five square metres of cell are un@@ worthy .
&quot; the Federal Constitutional Court granted a former prisoner of the Justice Pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary Te@@ gel , which was accommod@@ ated in a small cell for months . &quot;
&quot; because of the violation of their human dignity , prisoners are entitled to financial compensation if they are accommod@@ ated in too small cells . &quot;
this decision has made the Federal Constitutional Court in a decision published on Wednesday .
the persons concerned can even hope for money if they were im@@ pris@@ oned only a few days in confined spaces ( A@@ z . : 1 BvR 112@@ 7 / 14 ) .
&quot; with this , an ex @-@ prisoner with his constitutional complaint was successful in Karlsruhe : he was placed in a single cell with approximately five square meters of floor space between June and November 2009 ; the toilet was not separated . &quot;
&quot; after that , the man , who , according to his lawyer , was now on a free foot , was moved to a larger cell . &quot;
&quot; his liability , due to the un@@ worthy conditions of liability against the State of Berlin , failed . &quot;
&quot; however , the Constitutional Court lifted the judgment of the Berlin Court of Appe@@ al and rejected the case for renewed examination . &quot;
they see the man &apos;s dignity viol@@ ated .
the Court of Appe@@ als now decides on the amount of compensation
&quot; even if for legal reasons from the question@@ able period only a few days of det@@ ention are author@@ it@@ ative for compensation , it was commanded . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , &quot; a cl@@ er@@ ty of the legal protection of the personality would be to be feared . &quot;
the Court of Appe@@ al must now clarify the amount of compensation .
&quot; in the past , the constitutional judges have often strengthened the rights of prisoners of prison . &quot;
&quot; thus , they said to a prisoner release in April , because he was naked in a cell . &quot;
&quot; according to a decision of 2011 , human un@@ worthy is the multiple assignment of a cell without separate toilet . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , on Wednesday , Karlsruhe also confirmed the Berlin Constitutional Court , which had an in@@ decent housing in a parallel fall in November 2009 . &quot;
the compl@@ ain@@ ant was lod@@ ged every day between 15 to 21 hours in a similar cell as in the Karls@@ ru@@ her case .
&quot; in recent weeks , the Berlin pris@@ ons had come to the head@@ lines due to lack of staff . &quot;
&quot; prisoners are therefore always locked up for 23 hours , which increases aggres@@ si@@ veness , even to fights , it should have arrived because of the ten@@ se situation . &quot;
&quot; according to the judicial office , 21 jobs in te@@ gel are not occupied for young persons , 19 are to be om@@ itted in 2016 . &quot;
Angela Merkel and the refugee policy : &quot; we are creating this &quot;
the immigration of refugees is an enormous challenge - the Chancellor is determined to accept them .
what comes to Germany ?
&quot; approximately 800 000 asylum seek@@ ers will come to Germany according to forecasts of the German Federal Ministry this year , according to Vice @-@ Chancellor Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) , Germany is even able to take up one million refugees . &quot;
&quot; German Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) demonstrated determination in the face of the unusual challenge : &quot; &quot; I say again and again : we can create it , and we create that . &quot;
what comes to Germany gives the following overview .
&quot; according to different forecasts , between 35@@ 0000 ( estimate of the Federal Ministry of State ) and 400@@ ,000 ( estim@@ ation of the P@@ est@@ el Institute ) flats are used annually - for the next five years . &quot;
this is almost twice as much as it has been built up to now ( 25@@ 0000 apartments ) .
&quot; the lack of living space is dramatic , but above all with affordable rental properties : from 600@@ 00 to 800@@ 00 social apartments fall out of the rental price , and in order to apply these particularly cheap apartments refugees will also apply . &quot;
&quot; therefore , Federal Minister Barbara Hend@@ ri@@ cks ( SPD ) wants to double the funding from currently 518 million to a billion euros . &quot;
&quot; from the point of view of the P@@ est@@ el Institute : 80 000 social housing per year would have to be created , and therefore the federal government would have to invest EUR 6.4 billion a year . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , scientists and federal mini@@ stries agree that there must also be more tax advantages for investments in housing construction . &quot;
&quot; according to estimates by the Institute for Employment Research , it is assumed that 55 per cent of the refugees in Germany can be employed in the long term . &quot;
&quot; however , the refugees in Germany would not be systematically asked about their qualifications to help them get started , Claudia Walter , project manager for integration and education in the Ber@@ tel@@ smann Foundation . &quot;
&quot; for the integration of refugees , however , it is crucial whether they find work in Germany . &quot;
&quot; work is the key to social contacts , for appreciation in the recording society , but also for the self @-@ este@@ em of immigrants , says migration researcher Dietrich Thr@@ än@@ hardt . &quot;
&quot; in Germany , according to Thr@@ än@@ hardt , there has been a political turn@@ around : from employment prohibition for refugees to recognise work . &quot;
&quot; while there was a ban on employment for asylum seek@@ ers of up to five years , this was reduced to three months in November 2014 , as well as the Residen@@ z@@ pf@@ licht , which restri@@ cts asylum seek@@ ers to a place of residence . &quot;
&quot; in society , even because of the short@@ age of skilled labour , it is mostly the view that refugees should be allowed to access the labour market faster . &quot;
the lack of German knowledge is a major barrier to access the labour market .
&quot; so far , there is no sufficient offer of general and professional language courses . &quot;
research also shows that jobs are most often medi@@ ated through personal contacts .
&quot; as a result , the structure of networks is therefore the Königs@@ weg of the Royal Road to the Integration of Labour . &quot;
&quot; the Berlin School Management established that only a few escaped parents give their children into the kit@@ as , estimated 10 to 15 percent : &quot; for the ro@@ oting parents , it is only once very important to keep the family together , &quot; says Il@@ ja Ko@@ diag@@ bar , spokes@@ man for youth and family in the Berlin Senate Administration . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , to convince the family of the advantages of the K@@ ita , the administration distri@@ butes hand@@ books in different languages . &quot;
&quot; if the need for educ@@ ators increased sharp@@ ly by the large number of refugees , the Berlin Senate would attempt to increase training capacity - for example , by allowing more specialized schools . &quot;
&quot; in the countries , students will be prepared without knowledge of German in welcoming classes . &quot;
&quot; but they are not always taught by fully educated teachers , but , as in Berlin , also of teachers who only have a qualification in German as a second language . &quot;
&quot; there is no lack , says Be@@ ate St@@ offers from Berlin School of School . &quot;
the German Studenten@@ werk estimates that about 20 per cent of the refugees in Germany want to study .
&quot; in principle no federal land does not prohi@@ bit asylum seek@@ ers or toler@@ ated the study - the only exception was Berlin , In@@ ner sen@@ ator Frank H@@ enkel ( CD@@ U ) has now abandoned his post@@ ure . &quot;
admission to the university could be facilit@@ ated by prepar@@ atory refugees .
&quot; because refugees with a compensation or debt do not receive services after the asylum seek@@ er law , if they begin a study . &quot;
&quot; in principle , the latter does not get a B@@ af@@ ö@@ g , since they do not fall under the circle of legitimate persons . &quot;
&quot; until now , toler@@ ated refugees had to have lived in Germany for four years to be eligible , from 1 January 2016 onwards , this span is reduced to 15 months . &quot;
&quot; but this financing gap must also be closed , Steffen Kra@@ ch , Berlin &apos;s Secretary of State for Science , and the German Studenten@@ werk . &quot;
students should immediately get B@@ af@@ ö@@ g .
&quot; Islam will play a more important role in the future , as many refugees are Muslims , and for many , religion is an important part of their identity . &quot;
&quot; the state should succ@@ essi@@ vely introduce the same rights to Islam as they have churches , and the existing state @-@ denom@@ in@@ ational right to develop a new state religion relationship . &quot;
&quot; it is also important to establish an Islamic welfare organization , who takes care of the new@@ com@@ ers . &quot;
the rights also include duties .
&quot; thus , the representatives of Islam must agree on clear contact persons and be prepared to work together with the state in many areas and to grant them certain control options . &quot;
this also includes the willingness to take heed to religious fundament@@ alism .
&quot; the Chairman of the Central Council of Muslims , A@@ im@@ an Maz@@ ye@@ k , expressed concern on Thursday the concern , religious conflicts could also be carried into Germany . &quot;
&quot; those who wanted to carry out such conflicts in Germany immediately have their right to stay here , here in Germany , &quot; &quot; he said in the Bavarian Radio . &quot;
he proposed to translate the Basic Law in Arabic .
&quot; in future , integration will be much more than today a topic of the whole society . &quot;
&quot; with this , the majority society will also have to change , the exploitation of discrimination and rac@@ ism becomes more urgent . &quot;
&quot; indeed , Germany - as a result of European decisions - has been an anti @-@ discrimination point and a general gender equality law for a decade . &quot;
&quot; but it lear@@ ns very slowly how the NS@@ U assass@@ ination series showed , in the police and authorities , the rac@@ ist motive systematically ignored . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; equal opportunities for all : what migrants &apos; organisations and the stakeholders of non @-@ white German already require long and are committed to international agreements like the anti @-@ rac@@ ist convention in Germany , must be a reality in the coming years if the country is peaceful and its new citizens are to use their opportunities - for the good of all . &quot;
&quot; in general , Germany is capable of medi@@ cally supplying the expected refugees to date , says Dr. Ulrich Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery . &quot;
&quot; as for man@@ - power and capacities , we create it , &quot; he said to the Tages@@ spiegel . &quot;
&quot; however , additional money must be incorporated into the system . &quot;
&quot; to avoid bott@@ len@@ ecks , Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery calls to all the con@@ com@@ ers immediately to the registration of health cards . &quot;
provided services could be expected later with the federal states .
&quot; and in the long term , it is highly question@@ able to submit so many people with the restricted catalogue of power which the asylum seek@@ er law fores@@ aw . &quot;
otherwise the doctors are above all to create language barriers .
&quot; so far , the Berlin health scientist The@@ a Bor@@ de has demonstrated that migrants are decei@@ ved worse about their diseases than other patients . &quot;
&quot; not only in clinics , also in medical practices , interpre@@ ting costs have to be taken over , they ask . &quot;
&quot; it helped many refugees , however , with more general medical centres in emergency ambul@@ ances . &quot;
and with a different diagnostic view .
&quot; for example , among refugee children , there are much more untreated disabilities , and among the young people go to HIV @-@ clari@@ fication . &quot;
&quot; with the partially other clinical pictures German doctors come from their training , but clear , Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery writes . &quot;
&quot; the paras@@ ite inf@@ estation or tu@@ ber@@ cu@@ lo@@ sis are not so difficult to detect . &quot; &quot; and what concerns the doctor &apos;s angel may even be alle@@ vi@@ ated by the refugees . &quot;
&quot; the Syri@@ ans had a highly developed educational system , some refugees are even doctors . &quot;
&quot; in order to be allowed to practice , however , they would have to prove their qualifications and possibly need to perform tests . &quot;
at least half of the refugees coming in Germany are mentally ill after estim@@ ating the Bund@@ esp@@ ace Psych@@ otherap@@ e@@ ut@@ enk@@ ammer ( B@@ P@@ t@@ K ) : most suffer from traumatic stress disorder or depression .
&quot; particularly vulnerable to refugees , Dietrich Mun@@ z , President of the B@@ P@@ t@@ K . &quot;
a recently published study by the TU München affir@@ ms that every fifth Syrian refugee camp is trau@@ mati@@ zed in Germany .
&quot; those who are suffering from a post @-@ traumatic stress disorder , among other things , suffer from so @-@ called Flash@@ backs with breath , di@@ zz@@ iness , heart @-@ r@@ attle and death @-@ fear@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; other symptoms are sleep and concentration distur@@ bances , strong horror and emotional num@@ b@@ ness . &quot;
&quot; to prevent the symptoms would be chronic , early treatment is necessary , explained Mun@@ z . &quot;
&quot; to date , however , only four percent of the psych@@ ologically ill refugees receive a psych@@ otherapy . &quot;
&quot; although psych@@ ologically ill asylum seek@@ ers can make an application for psych@@ otherapy in the social @-@ offices , the treatment usually takes several months . &quot;
&quot; in addition , in the social @-@ offices mostly non @-@ employed professionals or doctors , who are not trained for mental illness , decide whether therapy is necessary or not . &quot;
&quot; this often leads to mis@@ calculations , says Mun@@ z . &quot;
arena invites you to dream
&quot; with the new st@@ aging &quot; passion , &quot; the Circus Pro@@ bst looks back on the traditions of cir@@ cus art . &quot;
&quot; the goal is to draw every age group into the spell of fascinating ac@@ rob@@ atics , animal dres@@ sage and unique entertainment . &quot;
now the Circus Pro@@ bst invites in the man@@ ege on the brick @-@ was@@ en to dream .
&quot; our passion is cir@@ cus . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I cannot imagine living without my cir@@ cus family , &quot; says Steph@@ anie Pro@@ bst , Animal Teacher and Juni@@ or@@ ch@@ ef@@ in . &quot;
&quot; passion &quot; - under this motto is the current art production .
cir@@ cus has been in the hands of the Pro@@ bst family for more than 33 years .
the gift to sav@@ our lies in the blood of the family .
&quot; it is important to us to take the people away from their everyday life and take them to a completely different world for two hours , &quot; &quot; stresses the 27 @-@ year @-@ old Juni@@ or@@ ch@@ ef@@ in . &quot;
&quot; Man@@ eg@@ enco@@ ck@@ tails with cos@@ mop@@ olitan flair , &quot; says director Reinhard Pro@@ bst his concept . &quot;
50 cities on the almost 3 000 km long tour can now experience this flair .
the cir@@ cus programme impres@@ ses with talented artists from around the world .
&quot; awarded at the international cir@@ cus festival in Monte Carlo , the Russian St@@ oli@@ aro@@ v C@@ low@@ n Family draws the audience with w@@ it and charm in their spell . &quot;
the Cas@@ tillo Brothers also understand their craft .
&quot; with the heroes of the mu@@ te movies , the Cu@@ ban duo wants to easily record . &quot;
ease and flexibility - with these words they identify themselves .
her hum@@ orous art at the mast will conquer women &apos;s hearts in the storm .
&quot; apart from numerous laugh@@ ing sal@@ ts , the ac@@ rob@@ atics of cir@@ cus promot@@ ers fascin@@ ate with dex@@ ter@@ ity and joint . &quot;
balance with the un@@ ic@@ ycle on a ball ?
for He Yuan there is no problem .
snake @-@ men fascin@@ ate and frigh@@ ten at the same time .
Wang L@@ in from China is familiar with the oldest form of ac@@ rob@@ atics as little others and fascin@@ ates with their flexibility .
60 employees from twelve nations offer variety in every respect .
&quot; the animals belong to our family , &quot; says Steph@@ an@@ ies mother , Brigitte Pro@@ bst . &quot;
ab@@ uses in the attitude of cir@@ cus animals are too often subject to different animal protection organisations .
Steph@@ anie Pro@@ bst looks at his position : &quot; if our animals are not good , we are not going well . &quot;
around 80 animals from five different continents enjoy each pet@@ ting unit .
&quot; the &quot; &quot; four @-@ leg@@ ged arti@@ stes &quot; , &quot; as they are called lov@@ ingly , will be read from the eyes according to the possibility . &quot;
we want to work with the animals and have fun with them .
&quot; if the animal does not feel well , it does not want to be in the arena . &quot;
so the top commandment is good for the animals .
&quot; especially on its zeb@@ roid format , a mixture of a sh@@ et@@ land pon@@ y stallion and a zeb@@ ra mare , the Pro@@ bst family is proud . &quot;
the two animals lived together eight years in a walk@@ way and nothing happened .
&quot; but then , suddenly , our little Jum@@ bo was there , &quot; said Brigitte Pro@@ bst . &quot;
&quot; the zeb@@ roid is not ready for the man@@ ege , but it is the unique mas@@ cot of Circus Pro@@ bst . &quot;
there should be something for each visitor .
&quot; one thing is certain , &quot; says Steph@@ anie Pro@@ bst : &quot; no matter if five or 1 200 spectators , we always give our best and are with all your heart . &quot;
the Circus Pro@@ bst looks forward to his performances from 17 to 20 September every day .
on Sunday the program begins at 11 a.m. and 4 p.m .
&quot; Thursday is family day , for the performance at 5 p.m. the prices are discounted . &quot;
it is also open every day from 10 am to 6 pm .
Sim@@ bab@@ w@@ es Robert Mug@@ abe holds false speech in parliament
&quot; Mr Mug@@ abe , Africa &apos;s oldest leader , fell down the stairs from a podium at the beginning of the year . &quot;
&quot; he remained un@@ har@@ med , but the video of the case quickly spread across social media . &quot;
the Parliament &apos;s opening was also clou@@ ded by alleg@@ ations of members of the opposition that they had received anonymous deaths and warned them to accompany the speech of Mr Mug@@ abe with Bu@@ hr@@ u@@ fen .
&quot; in the last month , they had cut him out and stopped him during his speech on the position of the nation in parliament - this is the speech he repeated on Tuesday . &quot;
spokes@@ man of the Movement for Democratic Change ( Movement for Democratic Change - M@@ DC ) In@@ no@@ cent Gon@@ ese said that seven opposition politicians received SMS messages on their phones they warned against Mr. Mug@@ abe &apos;s speech .
&quot; the message comes from a number that is not shown , but it has the title &apos; death &apos; , &quot; he told journalists to Mug@@ abe &apos;s speech . &quot;
&quot; it war@@ ns the Parliament members who are affected by the Parliament &apos;s immun@@ ity , and as soon as they leave Parliament , their parliamentary immun@@ ity is no longer effective . &quot;
the chief spokes@@ man said that the party led by Morgan T@@ sv@@ angi@@ ra@@ i is &quot; concerned &quot; about the dangers for politicians .
&quot; H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard will build up to 30,000 jobs &quot;
H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard is expected to build 25.000 to 30.000 jobs within the framework of restructuring and saving efforts in the company &apos;s services .
HP will split up in two listed companies this year and separate the computer and printer business from its fast @-@ growing company hardware and its service activities .
&quot; the expected job breakdown leads to a burden of over 2.7 billion dollars from the fourth quarter , said HP in an explanation . &quot;
&quot; these restructuring measures will enable a more competitive , more sustainable cost structure for the new H@@ ew@@ lett Pack@@ ard Enterprise , &quot; said Me@@ g Whit@@ man , HP President and Chief Executive who will lead the unit after separation . &quot;
&quot; H@@ ew@@ lett Pack@@ ard Enterprise will be smaller and more focused than HP is today , and we have a broad and deep@@ ened portfolio of businesses that help companies transition to a new style of business , &quot; said Whit@@ man . &quot;
as an independent company we are better positioned than ever before to satisfy the changing needs of our customers all over the world .
&quot; H@@ ew@@ lett Pack@@ ard Enterprise has more than 50 billion $ annual revenue and &quot; will be focused on providing previously un@@ parall@@ eled , integrated technology solutions for businesses , &quot; such an explanation of the company . &quot;
it spl@@ its a company founded in the 19@@ 30s by graduates of Stan@@ ford University Bill H@@ ew@@ lett and Dave Pack@@ ard to manufacture electrical equipment and their Pal@@ o Alto Garage is called &quot; The Birth@@ place of Silicon Valley . &quot;
HP has under@@ gone massive restructuring to cope with the conversion from traditional PCs to mobile devices .
&quot; the measure of HP , the world &apos;s second largest PC manufacturer and one of the largest US @-@ tech companies , is the latest in this area , based on the conviction that closely focused companies provide better performance . &quot;
FC Arsen@@ al captain Mik@@ el Art@@ eta says that team@@ mates have to stand before the game against Dynam@@ o Zagreb behind the injured Jack Wil@@ sh@@ ere
&quot; Wen@@ ger emphas@@ ised to Wil@@ sh@@ ere that it was only September and if his rehabilitation is according to plan , there is no reason why he can &apos;t play again before Christmas . &quot;
&quot; this optim@@ istic scenario already means that Wil@@ sh@@ ere will certainly miss at least the next four games for England , and in the face of his story his participation in the next summer will surely be uncer@@ tain . &quot;
the great dis@@ grace in this current problem is that Wil@@ sh@@ ere had finished the last season after a separate ank@@ le injury and then returned to its old momentum during the pre @-@ season .
&quot; this type of injury does not thre@@ aten the career , &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot;
it is a bone that does not heal well .
this is not a major issue .
this was just an accident .
it was not in connection with his an@@ kl@@ es or with the injuries he had previously .
&quot; this may be true from a purely medical point of view , but as Wen@@ ger recognized , there is the associated risk of further injuries , whenever a player tries to return in the middle of the season . &quot;
it also develops an unpleasant pattern .
Prime Minister In@@ j@@ uries Ltd investig@@ ates 23 different diseases of Wil@@ sh@@ ere since his debut six years ago .
he also played in only 65 of Arsen@@ al 157 Lig@@ ands in the last five seasons .
the wider picture for Arsen@@ al is that they were in six of eight playing times since 2007 / 08 one of the two Premier League clubs that have recorded most injuries .
&quot; Wen@@ ger accepts the potential of a vi@@ cious circle , but ar@@ sen@@ al believes that an improvement in the vulner@@ ability rate will last during the last season . &quot;
&quot; sometimes when you come back from an injury , you have a due time period , a time in which you must strengthen your body and win mar@@ tial force , &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot;
Jack is young enough to overcome this .
&quot; I hope his body stabili@@ zes , I am confident that he will do it and he will go through a career of the way he deserves . &quot;
Arsen@@ al starts its Champions League season on Wednesday evening against Din@@ amo Zagreb in front of the games against Chelsea on Saturday and against Tot@@ ten@@ ham Hot@@ spur next Wednesday and Wen@@ ger turns into a rotation within the team .
&quot; H@@ é@@ c@@ tor Bell@@ er@@ ín and Aaron Ram@@ sey have not travelled to Croatia , which means that Math@@ ie@@ u Deb@@ u@@ chy and Art@@ eta should start . &quot;
Wen@@ ger can also start with K@@ ier@@ an Gi@@ b@@ bs and Olivier Gi@@ ro@@ ud instead of Nach@@ o Mon@@ real and Theo Wal@@ cot@@ t .
&quot; I try to keep the balance and give players a little break @-@ up break , &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot;
&quot; although Arsen@@ al &apos;s clear favorites are moving forward by group F , the Mak@@ si@@ mir Stadion in Zagreb is one of the play@@ grounds with the biggest inti@@ mid@@ ation in Europe . &quot;
dynam@@ o is also unbe@@ aten after 41 games after the &quot; inv@@ inci@@ ble &quot; campaign started in the last season .
&quot; the stadium was sh@@ aken on Tuesday night by an earthquake , which was measured on the Richter scale . &quot;
this year it was the 10th in Zagreb .
Wen@@ ger believes that Arsen@@ al with@@ drew from the last season with the Champions League capit@@ ulation against Monaco and remains from far @-@ reaching hopes to lead the club to its first Europ@@ ap@@ ok@@ al victory .
&quot; this drive is immense , &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot;
it never worked at Arsen@@ al .
&quot; we were very close to it in 2006 , but on the other hand I &apos;m long enough in business to be realistic . &quot;
&quot; we are ambitious , but we are not dre@@ am@@ ers . &quot;
Friend@@ s@@ Fest : com@@ edy show that gave us serious lessons on men &apos;s friend@@ ships
&quot; the absence of similar represent@@ ations in shows is apparent , especially with regard to how the need for men to open themselves , now even more des@@ perate than ever has become , how su@@ icide rates among young men prove on a 15 @-@ year high . &quot;
&quot; in 2013 , it was the most important cause of death in men aged 20 to 45 in Great Britain , and it remains three times more common in men than women . &quot;
&quot; in an effort to tackle the problem , Camp@@ aig@@ n Ag@@ ainst Living Mis@@ er@@ ably ( Cal@@ m - Camp@@ aig@@ n Ag@@ ainst a pi@@ tiful life ) announced in 2015 as the year of the man , with the aim of asking the culture to question the men to seek help if they need them . &quot;
friendship is the heart of the battle to overcome this challenge .
&quot; a current study of more than 2,000 high school students with depres@@ sive symptoms noticed that when the suffer@@ er had a sufficiently high percentage of friends with &quot; healthy mood , &quot; his chances of recovery doubled . &quot;
&quot; for those who are not de@@ pressed , a circle of mentally healthy friends hal@@ ves the risks of mental problems . &quot;
&quot; but of course you have to have friends , so that a friendship may work . &quot;
&quot; in the age of communication led through social media , with its emphasis on style about substance , the immedi@@ acy of the answer is often more important than a meaningful contact . &quot;
&quot; our digital lives have the need to appear strong , life @-@ fun and successful , even though in reality isolation domin@@ ates . &quot;
&quot; this super@@ ficial success is dominated by what psych@@ ologists call ex@@ trin@@ sic values ; money , image , social status , all at the expense of in@@ trin@@ sic values - our inner longing for personal development and friendship that affects our mental health much more deeply . &quot;
&quot; and like a video game invent@@ or and billi@@ on@@ aire recently explained , money can really not buy happiness . &quot;
the beauty at Friends was that this focuss@@ ing was placed on the head .
&quot; every character was defined not by his work , but by his personality , shining through interaction as a friend . &quot;
&quot; the hum@@ our of Jo@@ ey and Ch@@ and@@ ler &apos;s frequent h@@ ug@@ s , moments in football matches in cozy arm@@ chairs and the longing of R@@ oss to Rachel - all this came out of the knowledge that men can refer to each case even though they are often rel@@ uc@@ t@@ ant to fully explore their feelings . &quot;
&quot; as a staff of teleph@@ ony coun@@ seling told me : ... &quot; my role for people who feel de@@ pressed and threatened by su@@ icide , really showed me how even the smallest interactions of friends can make a difference . &quot;
the men who contact us often don &apos;t feel able to talk to friends .
&quot; the old saying &quot; &quot; I come along with it &quot; &quot; has an enormous effect , like the feeling that it is perceived as a weakness when talking about problems openly . &quot;
friends is one of the shows that come to my mind when I try to offer long @-@ term cop@@ ing mechanisms .
she presents quite clearly the small moments of men &apos;s friend@@ ships .
&quot; so much my objective out@@ sider status about the phone may help people in moments of desp@@ air , too , the long @-@ term support comes from a personal network of family and friends . &quot;
&quot; so if you attend this weekend Com@@ edy Central Friend@@ s@@ Fest with the highlight of the day completely re@@ designed scenery , why don &apos;t you then take your friends to a drink in Central Per@@ k . &quot;
&quot; or even better , if you see someone sitting around alone in Star@@ bu@@ cks , give him a smile and say h@@ ello . &quot;
you never know which difference could make your friendship .
friends will be sent to Com@@ edy Central from the beginning to the end - all 236 epis@@ odes - for # Friend@@ s@@ Fest
di Maria meets to help PSG save Malm@@ ö
angel Di Maria celebrates with Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i and Ed@@ inson Cav@@ ani following his hit against Malm@@ ö .
di Maria meets at his debut in the Champions League on Tuesday and helps PSG to pass on Malm@@ ö .
here are the game report and the reaction to the game .
angel Di Maria and Ed@@ inson Cav@@ ani held course when Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main started its Champions League season with an extremely comfortable 2 @-@ 0 victory against Malm@@ ö in the Prin@@ zen@@ Park@@ st@@ adion on Tuesday .
&quot; di Maria met less than four minutes after the start of his Champions League debut as a PSG player , who brought the French champion to the way , but afterwards they missed a number of occasions before they finally increased their lead when Cav@@ ani achieved a head ball@@ point in the 6@@ 1st minute . &quot;
&quot; with Real Madrid and Sch@@ acht@@ j@@ or Don@@ et@@ sk also in group A , Paris also needs a strong start to the Swedish champion , since it is not only the qualification for the kno@@ ck@@ out kno@@ ck@@ out , but an improvement on the way to the four @-@ quarter fin@@ als in each of the last three campaigns . &quot;
&quot; but while they got the points , it was not a classic game of Laurent Blan@@ cs team with Zlat@@ an I@@ bra@@ him@@ o@@ vic@@ s missed chances in front of the gate . he was later replaced in the game against his hom@@ etown team and against the club , with whom he started his illustri@@ ous career in 1999 . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s not easy to win at home or abroad in the Champions League . therefore , it &apos;s a good start to win 2 : 0 to cause our opponents problems and look back even if there are certain things that we have to perf@@ ected during the season , &quot; &quot; said Blanc . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is a good sign . &quot;
&quot; we wanted to win and we won , although I regret that we did not have one or two more goals . &quot;
&quot; after his injury , I@@ bra@@ him@@ ovic returned to the Paris team after his injury , which was a 2 : 2 draw on his own place against Bordeaux in the First League , but he was engraved by Di Maria in the fourth minute . &quot;
&quot; the Argent@@ ine@@ an imp@@ eller was called the man to take the PSG to the next level in Europe , when he went into the last month of Manchester United , and he pointed out why when he passed in Marco Ver@@ rat@@ tis Pass behind the Malm@@ ö defense before he passed off to Johan Wil@@ and in the long corner of the network . &quot;
&quot; however , if someone believed that PSG would achieve a great victory , he was disappointed . &quot;
&quot; Malm@@ ö that hit the Celtic in a play @-@ off to reach this stage , joined An@@ pi@@ ff with nine national players in the field and was a serious opponent with a five @-@ man defense and two deep in the middle field . &quot;
&quot; but except for a shot by Nik@@ ola D@@ jur@@ dj@@ ic , who passed far to Kevin Tr@@ apps p@@ fo@@ sters in the 34@@ th minute , they offered little in the attack . &quot;
&quot; instead , PSG himself sometimes found himself on , with some mis@@ ses and bad degrees , not least by I@@ bra@@ him@@ ovic , who was scrat@@ ched in the first half in no less than five attempts , after cav@@ ani had put him after re@@ boot . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , he proved a lot more skill when he brought his fellow players into the game , and it was a pass by I@@ bra@@ him@@ ovic , which Di Maria turned into a shooting shot by Wil@@ and in the 5@@ 2nd minute on the pole ... &quot;
the second goal finally fell short after the hour stamp thanks to Cav@@ ani . the Urugu@@ ay@@ er achieved its sixth season gate after I@@ bra@@ him@@ ovic had caught a lef@@ tist flan@@ k of Max@@ well .
&quot; this ended all the thought that Malm@@ ö can return to the game , and only an excellent intervention of wild and from the shortest distance to stop David Lu@@ iz , the final result could be low before replacement player E@@ z@@ equi@@ el Lav@@ e@@ zzi decre@@ ed a gate at the end . &quot;
&quot; the coach of Malm@@ ö , Age Har@@ ei@@ de , later admitted that PSG played a class above his team and the Norwegian said : &quot; our last champion league game was last year in December . &quot;
&quot; since then , we have played only in the Swedish League that has not the same level . &quot;
the qualifying matches are not enough . &quot;
hat off before Paris !
it was a great game of them !
Gl@@ enc@@ ore coll@@ ects 2.5 billion $ through stock sales
&quot; the local mining giant , Gl@@ enc@@ ore , based in Switzerland , which is affected by collap@@ sing raw material prices , collected a stock sales of 2.5 billion dollars on Wednesday , as part of its huge debt rep@@ ay@@ ment plan . &quot;
&quot; the company Gl@@ enc@@ ore , registered in London , said in an explanation that it has sold new shares worth roughly 1.6 billion £ to pay off its own debts . &quot;
&quot; the company , which lost 57 percent of its market value this year , is struggling with falling raw materials , as China &apos;s economic down@@ turn expresses the demand and devast@@ ating markets . &quot;
the output of subscription rights held Gl@@ en@@ cores Akti@@ enk@@ urs during the early Wednesday morning a rapid increase to the top of the London Stock Exchange .
&quot; the share j@@ ump@@ ed by 2.@@ 77 percent to 13@@ 1,@@ 60 p@@ ence on the FT@@ SE 100 Index , which opened 0.@@ 69 percent higher . &quot;
&quot; for last week , Gl@@ enc@@ ore had announced the 2.5 billion $ share sale as part of the more comprehensive plans to cut around a third of its $ 30 billion debt . &quot;
&quot; the company sold the new particip@@ ations to 125 p@@ ence per share , which meant a 2.4 percent discount on the closing ceremony on Tuesday . &quot;
there were 1.3 billion shares worth up to 9.@@ 99 percent of the group .
&quot; concerns regarding a long @-@ term growth in China have decreased iron ore prices by around half , coal , copper , and other raw material prices declined by 20 to 40 percent . &quot;

the White House confirms Xi J@@ in@@ p@@ ings visit to Washington
&quot; the Chinese President Xi J@@ in@@ ping will make a state visit to the US at the end of the month , confirmed the White House in an explanation on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; the visit , the first official in Washington , takes place on 25 September and res@@ ists President Barack Obama &apos;s trip to Beijing last November , said the statement . &quot;
the US President and the First Lady Michelle Obama will be host by Xi and his wife Pen@@ g Li@@ y@@ uan at a State D@@ iner this evening after the two leaders have conducted bilateral discussions .
&quot; President xis Visit will provide the opportunity to expand the American @-@ Chinese co @-@ operation in a series of global , regional and bilateral issues of common interest , but also President Obama and President Xi have the opportunity to construc@@ tively address areas of dis@@ agreements , &quot; adds the statement . &quot;
&quot; XI , whose visit was first announced in February , will likely meet several U.S. technology leaders on his way to Washington before he travels to New York City to the UN General Assembly in September . &quot;
&quot; it is expected that Obama and Xi have a number of controversial questions , including Washington &apos;s concerns regarding alleged cy@@ ber sp@@ ying in China and his increasing self @-@ confidence in the controversial waters of the South China Sea . &quot;

X@@ avi : PE@@ P Guardi@@ ola prevented 2008 from FC Bayern
world and European champion X@@ avi has been playing for the al @-@ S@@ in Sport Club in Qatar since summer 2015
&quot; the FC Bayern was obvious a few years ago , before the commitment of Spain super@@ star X@@ avi , who then played for FC Barcelona . &quot;
&quot; eight times Spanish champion , three times champion winner , four times Champions League Champion , twice European champion , twice world champion , twice World Champion - the title list of X@@ avi is stunning . &quot;
&quot; in summer , the 35 @-@ year @-@ old left FC Barcelona after 24 years and moved to Qatar for al @-@ S@@ add Sport Club . &quot;
but in an interview with Mar@@ ca X@@ avi now betra@@ ys that he was standing before the European Championship before the departure from Barcelona .
one told me that Bar@@ ça wanted to sell me .
&quot; Madrid won everything back then , we had nothing , &quot; he says . &quot;
and that also recorded the FC Bayern .
X@@ avi : &quot; there was an offer of Bavaria . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Rum@@ men@@ ig@@ ge wanted me . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; in the summer of 2008 , Jürgen Klin@@ smann took over the FC Bayern . &quot;
Guardi@@ ola was the reason that X@@ avi did not change
but the change did not come about .
and the decisive man for this works today for the German record champion : PE@@ P Guardi@@ ola .
&quot; X@@ avi explains why : &quot; &quot; Bar@@ ça has put Guardi@@ ola under contract and I played a great EM . &quot;
PE@@ P told me that I wouldn &apos;t change that he couldn &apos;t imagine the team without me .
&quot; he has won me . &quot; &quot; &quot;
who knows how Bavaria &apos;s Play@@ time 2008 / 2009 would run with X@@ avi .
&quot; X@@ avi stood for Bar@@ ca in the quarter @-@ fin@@ als of the Champions League against Bavaria across the whole distance on the grass , split the reds from ( 4 : 0 , 1 : 1 ) and celebrated the King &apos;s Triumph at the end . &quot;
matt Dam@@ on plays variety in creating movies
matt Dam@@ on confronted the af@@ ro@@ amer@@ ican film@@ maker Eff@@ ie Brown during a discussion about the diversity and said she is not needed behind the scenes .
&quot; during a series of Sunday Night of H@@ B@@ OS Project green@@ light , experienced actor brown broke out when they stressed the need for alternative perspectives in terms of a black protagon@@ ist in the project &apos;s chosen script . &quot;
&quot; when we talk about diversity , then do it in the occupation of the film and not with the occupation of the show , &quot; said Dam@@ on . &quot;
&quot; brown re@@ acted shock@@ ed , with insul@@ ted un@@ belief and called &quot; Ho@@ o ! wow . OK , &quot; as the comments of the act@@ ress of The Mar@@ tian strengthened . &quot;
&quot; Dam@@ on and Brown joined Ben Aff@@ l@@ eck and the Far@@ rel@@ ly Brothers , to discuss the show fin@@ alists . &quot;
&quot; I would like to ask people to think about it - whoever will always be the director - as they treat the figure of Harmon@@ y , &quot; &quot; said Brown . &quot;
&quot; the only black person , and she is a sp@@ line , beaten by her white half . &quot;
&quot; the producer of Dear White People sat down for the fin@@ alists Leo Angel@@ os and Kri@@ sten Bran@@ c@@ accio for direc@@ ting rights to the film ; Dam@@ on said that &quot; &quot; at the end their direction &quot; &quot; could give us something we don &apos;t want . &quot;
&quot; after the discussion was broadcast , the social media explo@@ ded against Dam@@ on &apos;s comments . &quot;
Twitter user Mr Po@@ oni expressed his anger about the clip by writing &quot; Matt Dam@@ on &quot; talking about the only black person in the room so he can explain their variety - that &apos;s SO WE@@ ISS that it hur@@ ts .
&quot; the twe@@ et earned more than 5,000 re@@ we@@ ets and 4,000 Li@@ kes since its publication . &quot;
Dam@@ on &apos;s comments come at a time when the exact r@@ acial representation in the media is at the head of the social discussion .
&quot; after the teen@@ ager Michael Brown was killed by a white police in 2014 , the Black Li@@ ves Matter Group achieved nation@@ wide action and urged leg@@ is@@ lators and authorities to commit discri@@ min@@ atory practices against colour content . &quot;
in February the singer Prince made an all@@ usion to the movement during the introduction of the nominated albums of the year at the Gram@@ my Awards .
&quot; album still matter , &quot; ( albums still have their meaning ) he said . &quot;
&quot; like books and black life , albums still have their meaning . &quot;
&quot; in recent times , leaders of the Black Li@@ ves Matter have published an explanation of the question of the Fox News personality , Elisabeth Hassel@@ beck , whether the group should be regarded as a hate group . &quot;
&quot; the network Black Li@@ ves Matter is a group of love , &quot; said the leaders . &quot;
&quot; recently it was announced that Dam@@ on was on a list of enter@@ tain@@ ers , producers and media writers who are invited to visit the pop@@ e to discuss the depic@@ tion of the Catholic Church in the West . &quot;
whether he accepted the invitation or has already met the Pope is uncle@@ ar .
&apos;@@ American Nin@@ ja Warrior &apos; Crow@@ ns First Champion
&quot; professional sport clim@@ bers and operating help Isaac Cal@@ di@@ ero became the first ath@@ l@@ ete , who won the American Nin@@ ja Warrior on Monday evening and took the Grand Prix of $ 1 Million with home . &quot;
&quot; the competition show , which completed her 7th season , had never experienced a contest participant who could complete all stages of his obstacle course . &quot;
&quot; during the season @-@ fin@@ als , there were two men , Cal@@ di@@ ero and cam@@ er@@ aman , Ge@@ off Brit@@ ten , until the finale . &quot;
the last task was climbing on a 75 foot long climbing rope in 30 seconds .
&quot; Brit@@ ten finished the task within the time with which he was the first ath@@ l@@ ete , who finished the exhau@@ sting phase 4 of American Nin@@ ja Warrior . however , Cal@@ di@@ ero completed this challenge full three seconds faster , which made him the winner . &quot;
&quot; Cal@@ di@@ ero spoke to E ! messages after the hard fought victory , still under the shock of winning the Grand Prix of 1 Million $ . &quot;
&quot; I mean it &apos;s amazing to think about it , I &apos;ve never earned or had more than 10,000 $ or had to live , &quot; said Isaac E ! about his pile of money . &quot;
suddenly .. how I can &apos;t even imagine how this is ... the future is unknown .
&quot; the leading producer K@@ ent We@@ ed sat down with The Hollywood Repor@@ ter to discuss the finale and why Brit@@ ten , even though he was the first to finish the course , did not receive any prize money . &quot;
after the rules the money goes to the fastest person .
&quot; if there is more than one fin@@ alists , it gets the one with the fastest time , &quot; We@@ ed said . &quot;
&quot; how much money is a wonderful price and life changes , he receives the great gratu@@ ity . &quot;
I don &apos;t think he won any gru@@ dge about it .
he is just so happy to have done what he has done .
he received the masses of awards from fans .
he is such a great guy and a family father .
he is a hero for his children and his wife .
&quot; Ge@@ off said to me : &quot; &quot; if I should be beaten by someone , then I &apos;m glad that Isaac is Isaac . &quot;
and I think Isaac felt just the same when they had changed the roles .
&quot; America Nin@@ ja Warrior has been extended for an eighth season , the shooting will start in spring 2016 . &quot;
Detroit Tig@@ ers pass over Minn@@ es@@ ota Tw@@ ins
MIN@@ NE@@ AP@@ OL@@ IS@@ --@@ The second half of the season was not particularly funny for the Detroit Tig@@ ers .
&quot; once they were one of the best teams in bas@@ eb@@ all , today the Tig@@ ers stand on the last place in the American League Central . &quot;
the tig@@ ers are reduced to their role as spo@@ ilers but played this part perfectly against Minn@@ es@@ ota Tw@@ ins with 5 @-@ 4 in Target Field .
the Tw@@ ins w@@ asted a chance for as@@ cen@@ sion within one hal@@ ve of Houston Ast@@ ros for the second American League Wild@@ card slot .
&quot; for Detroit , although only for one evening , it was a return of the three letter F @-@ word that was so difficult to grasp over a large part of the second half of the season . &quot;
&quot; all vic@@ tories are fun , no matter how it comes , &quot; said Tig@@ ers Manager Brad Aus@@ m . &quot;
&quot; tiger @-@ Pit@@ cher Al@@ fre@@ do Simon maintained its early offensive support , when Detroit sc@@ ored three times in the first two inn@@ ings , then once in the sixth and then again in the ninth . &quot;
Simon ( 13 @-@ 9 ) stroke 6 times in the 1 / 3 Inn@@ ings and allowed three R@@ uns .
it was only his third successful start in his last nine games .
&quot; I want to end this year , &quot; &quot; said Simon . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s hard to throw in the bull@@ se@@ ye of any game , and so I want to go into the game . &quot;
&quot; the designated tiger @-@ h@@ itter Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z had three hits and was in two ranks , his first round since mid @-@ August . &quot;
it was the first triple hit game by Mart@@ ine@@ z since he had four hits against the Seattle Marin@@ ers on July 6 .
&quot; he has sw@@ ung the wood , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; he looked good at the ( punch training ) , looked much better out of the bull@@ sh@@ it , and he brought it straight into the game . &quot;
&quot; with three R@@ uns in the h@@ ind at the end of the seventh inside , the Tw@@ ins had their best chance to come back into play . &quot;
center F@@ iel@@ der B@@ yr@@ on Bu@@ x@@ ton finished inning with a double on the left field line .
right F@@ iel@@ der Aaron H@@ icks reached a b@@ unt and Simon brought his second bas@@ eman Brian Do@@ zier to Stri@@ ke@@ out before being replaced by the left @-@ handed Bla@@ ine Har@@ dy .
&quot; Har@@ dy passed down the wall , the only man he was confronted with , in front of the design@@ ate R@@ ook@@ ie @-@ drummer Miguel S@@ ano , who entr@@ ust a Two @-@ Run guard against the right @-@ handed twist . &quot;
with a pair of runners and the end @-@ run the second Bas@@ eman Tre@@ vor Pl@@ ou@@ ffe brought the third Bas@@ eman Tre@@ vor Pl@@ ou@@ ffe to a double play .
it was the 27th time in the Major League for the 27th time in this season that Pl@@ ou@@ ffe beat a double play
&quot; after Detroit added an insurance run at the end of the ninth inn@@ ings , Wall created a R@@ BI double against the cil@@ ess of the Tig@@ ers Bruce Ron@@ don and achieved the stand of 5 @-@ 4 . &quot;
&quot; the right @-@ handed , however , stab@@ bed S@@ ano at three Pit@@ ches for his fifth Save . &quot;
Detroit benefited from the start of the game from an even non @-@ mobile Phil Hu@@ gh@@ es .
&quot; the tig@@ ers achieved three R@@ uns in the first two inn@@ ings against the right @-@ handed veter@@ an , who had been removed from the injury list before the game , after he had been missing more than a month because of a spinal cord . &quot;
&quot; obviously not the beginning I wished for , &quot; Hu@@ gh@@ es said , &quot; but I felt more comfortable when I set off and felt that I would create some pretty good Pit@@ ches there in the third inning . &quot;
&quot; after having received the Le@@ ad@@ off Bat@@ ter in the first time , h@@ uss@@ hes gave a single to Second Bas@@ eman Ian Kin@@ sler . &quot;
a Two @-@ Out Walk for J@@ .D. Mart@@ ine@@ z brought Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z into the game who created a single &quot; up the middle &quot; at the first run of the game .
Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z made his 0 @-@ 21 successful series with the Run@@ ners in the Scor@@ ing position .
&quot; the third bass eman Nick Castell@@ anos followed with a single on the right , managed another run , but Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z was thrown out of the game when he tried to get to the third , which ended the threat . &quot;
&quot; in the second , the Tig@@ ers made a One @-@ Out Double by Cat@@ cher James Mc@@ C@@ ann and a Two @-@ Out Single from Center @-@ F@@ iel@@ der Anthony G@@ ose to the 3 @-@ 0 . &quot;
&quot; this was a big blow , &quot; &quot; said Tw@@ ins @-@ Manager Paul Mol@@ itor . &quot;
&quot; he has not beaten very well , but he has caught the right place . &quot;
&quot; Hu@@ gh@@ es was in a pitch @-@ count , sc@@ ored no points in the third inning before being replaced by A.@@ J.@@ A@@ chter &apos;s rel@@ ic . &quot;
at Hu@@ gh@@ es there were three R@@ uns with six hits and a walk with four ropes .
notes : Tig@@ ers R@@ HP Ani@@ bal San@@ che@@ z retired due to a violation of the throw @-@ off@@ s .
he is being investigated by Dr. James Andre@@ ws who operated the shoulder of San@@ che@@ z in 2007 .
&quot; San@@ che@@ z , since mid @-@ August on the vulner@@ ability list because of a shoulder @-@ tear , is to be activated for the start on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; with San@@ che@@ z from the game , L@@ HP Daniel Morris is removed from the list of injuries to start against the Tw@@ ins . &quot;
Nor@@ ris with 1 @-@ 1 at four starts with the Tig@@ ers since he was purchased in exchange with L@@ HP David Price on 30 July
he has been missing since 20 August because of a distortion on the right hip joint .
the Tig@@ ers and Tw@@ ins will finish their series of three games in Target Field on Wednesday
Nor@@ ris ( 2 @-@ 2.@@ 4.@@ 43 ERA ) is played against Minn@@ es@@ ot@@ as R@@ HP Er@@ vin Sant@@ ana ( 5 @-@ 4 : 4.@@ 73 )
hundreds of refugees are supposed to fall in Wiesbaden
a train with hundreds of refugees is on the way to Hessen .
his arrival was expected for the night on Wednesday .
&quot; the people who arrived in it should then be accommod@@ ated in emergency shel@@ ters in Wiesbaden , such as the City of Wiesbaden , on Tuesday evening . &quot;
it counted for refugees with 450 to 750 refugees .
several sports halls of the Hes@@ sian capital were prepared for this case in recent days .
up to 1000 refugees can temporarily be accommod@@ ated there .
they should then be distributed to other communities .
&quot; in the past ten days alone , according to the government pres@@ idency of the government , G@@ ießen 7@@ 500 people have arrived in H@@ esse . &quot;
Frankfurt and Han@@ au also set up emergency accommodations in sports halls because of the large number of refugees .
Isch@@ inger : German military action in Syria an option
&quot; the head of the Munich Security Conference , Wolfgang Isch@@ inger , holds military action with German participation in Syria for a possibility . &quot;
&quot; I believe the determined thinking about military action options must not take place without Germany , &quot; he said . &quot;
he accused the European states of &quot; collective path@@ ways . &quot;
four years ago we were happy that the ch@@ ali@@ ce passed by military participation in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; now the conflict lands in front of our door@@ step , &quot; &quot; he said in Deutschl@@ and@@ funk . &quot;
the former German ambassador in Washington also demanded a massive boost of international assistance on site for the refugees .
Austria controls on the southern and eastern borders
&quot; after Germany , Austria again introduced controls on its southern and eastern borders . &quot;
&quot; the Austrian Minister of Foreign Affairs Johanna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner declared on Tuesday evening in the Austrian television station OR@@ F , no one has been sent back to Hungary . &quot;
Germany did not send refugees back to Austria .
&quot; no , that &apos;s so arranged , &quot; she explained . &quot;
&quot; on the question of an agreement that Germany could record a certain number of refugees from Austria a day , Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner said there have already been discussions between the General Director for Public Security and representatives of Germany . &quot;
she did not call concrete figures and pointed to talks on Wednesday in Berlin .
&quot; in recent days , tens of thousands of refugees have come to Austria via the so @-@ called Balkan route . &quot;
your goal is mostly Germany .
Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) and her Austrian colleague Werner F@@ ay@@ mann asked for a special summit next week with several other EU heads of state and government .
Germany started on Sunday with temporary fron@@ tier controls .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the EU states have so far failed to agree on a joint action in the crisis . &quot;
the EU interior ministers want to take a new start to a binding distribution of more than 120,000 refugees next Tuesday ( 22 September ) . &quot;
&quot; in view of the strong refugee population in Germany , the federal government wants to support the federal states in the initial up@@ take and distribution of people . &quot;
&quot; the Con@@ federation will manage this together with the countries , Merkel announced in the late evening after almost four hour discussions with the Prime Ministers in the Chancellor Office in Berlin . &quot;
&quot; Merkel under@@ lined , those people who need protection , conf@@ ess this too . &quot;
but those who do not have a lead @-@ perspective cannot remain in Germany .
this view had been squ@@ ee@@ zed in the round .
the chan@@ cell@@ or stressed that the state as a whole must now face a &quot; huge effort &quot; effort .
thousands of des@@ perate refugees are now stuck on the Balkans .
Hungary closed its 175 kilometres long border with Serbia on Tuesday night .
&quot; a few hours later , the government announced in Budapest to set up the border with Romania with a fence . &quot;
this neighbour country is different from Serbia to the EU .
Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to said Hungary &apos;s Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to to the planned new border fence .
the Romanian government immediately condemned the plan .
there were first ar@@ rests of people who had cut the fence .
&quot; in Turkey , thousands of other migrants were report@@ edly on their way to the Greek border . &quot;
spac@@ ecraft &quot; Cass@@ ini &quot; finds Ocean on Satur@@ n@@ mond En@@ cel@@ a@@ dus
under the ice @-@ tail of the Satur@@ n@@ moon En@@ cel@@ a@@ dus asc@@ ends a global ocean .
these include researchers from observations of the spac@@ ecraft &quot; Cass@@ ini . &quot;
&quot; accordingly , the moon changes easily on its way around the ring plan@@ ets . &quot;
&quot; although this exchange movement is only small but still too big for a solid cel@@ esti@@ al body , it is said in a message from the Corn@@ ell University in I@@ th@@ aca ( US State New York ) of Tuesday . &quot;
the researchers present their analyses in the &quot; I@@ car@@ us &quot; journal .
&quot; for longer , it was known that there must be liquid water under the ice cover of En@@ cel@@ a@@ dus . &quot;
&quot; that way , &quot; Cass@@ ini &quot; had already discovered ice volcan@@ oes at the South Pole of the Satur@@ n@@ moon in 2006 , sp@@ ies the water vap@@ or and ice particles , and thus feeding the so @-@ called E @-@ Ring of Saturn . &quot;
&quot; at least at the South Pole , there must be a sub@@ terranean sea , the astronom@@ ers closed back then . &quot;
&quot; however , the expansion of the hidden ocean was not clear . &quot;
R@@ ama missing in 1860 München several weeks
1860 München had to ab@@ stain from Val@@ det R@@ ama about one month .
&quot; an investigation has resulted in an adoption of an adoption of the 27 @-@ year @-@ old , the association shared . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the week , R@@ ama compl@@ ained about pain . &quot;
&quot; according to the &quot; &quot; Munich lion &quot; , &quot; the diagnosis &quot; is expected to break four weeks of forced break . &quot;
&quot; that makes us hard , R@@ ama is a her@@ ber loss . &quot;
&quot; of course , we have to think about now , &quot; said Sports Director N@@ ec@@ at Ay@@ gun of the &quot; Image &quot; newspaper with a look at the possible obligation of a united professionals . &quot;
&quot; as a train@@ ee , the six@@ ties initially presented a def@@ ensive man . &quot;
the 30 @-@ year @-@ old Hr@@ vo@@ je C@@ ale was last active in Belgium and was under contract before the V@@ f@@ L Wolfs@@ burg .
&quot; at present , the Cro@@ at has the possibility to prove his skill . &quot;
tor@@ ch ruby Ok@@ ot@@ ie can return to the team training next week after its bra@@ in@@ shock .
&quot; already on Thursday , the Austrian national player should enter the running training . &quot;
Ok@@ ot@@ ie had injured himself in the game at Fort@@ una Düsseldorf ( 0 : 3 ) at a heavy clas@@ h .
&quot; against the first fears , however , he remained without a serious bl@@ unt . &quot;
no diet fruit - man@@ goes contain a lot of sugar
man@@ goes are exotic and ju@@ icy @-@ sweet .
&quot; but he who wants to pay attention to his slim line , he is often dis@@ cour@@ aged by them . &quot;
because man@@ goes contain relatively much sugar - especially su@@ cro@@ se .
&quot; the exotic fruits are healthy nevertheless : in them B vitamins as well as the vitamins E and C. In particular , man@@ goes contain a lot of vitamin A and its prec@@ ursor ß @-@ car@@ ot@@ ene . &quot;
&quot; who e@@ ats the fruits , thus supports visual strength , immune system and met@@ abolic processes within the body . &quot;
&quot; when buying , man@@ go should not be too soft or too tight and smell pleasant . &quot;
the shell @-@ color alone says nothing about how ripe the fruit is - so green man@@ goes can taste delicious .
they should be stored at room temperature and consumed within a few days .
then they taste naturally pure or in sweet foods .
a man@@ go also gives sav@@ ory dishes a special touch .
it sof@@ tens the slightly bitter taste of some Bl@@ at@@ ts@@ al@@ ate like Chic@@ or@@ ee and Radi@@ c@@ cio .
&quot; and a man@@ go@@ ch@@ ut@@ ney fits well to fish , p@@ oultry , lamb and game . &quot;
the U.S. parcel service U@@ PS will once again offer up to 95@@ 000 char@@ ters for the Christmas business in the USA .
&quot; the company already started recru@@ iting seasonal workers , U@@ PS shared on Tuesday . &quot;
especially drivers are sought .
&quot; last year , U@@ PS had increased its workforce for the holiday season by 95@@ 000 subsidies . &quot;
&quot; given the bo@@ oming online business , U@@ PS and its competi@@ tor Fed@@ Ex have been taking precau@@ tions since last year to be prepared for the Christmas business . &quot;
bel@@ ated deliveries made the parcel service harsh criticism in 2013 .
&quot; first blow @-@ storm , then marked Kalt@@ front &quot;
&quot; in the coming night , in the valleys of the mountain side of the fo@@ eh@@ n , how Met@@ e@@ o@@ Swiss announced on Tuesday . &quot;
on Wednesday and on the night to Thursday the fo@@ eh@@ n blow@@ s partially with storm strength through the fo@@ oth@@ ills .
&quot; after F@@ öhn@@ ende on Thursday morning we cross a striking cold front , which brings powerful ra@@ inf@@ alls , wind bu@@ cks and a temperature decline . &quot;
&quot; as Met@@ e@@ o@@ News writes in a message , Switzerland is currently on the front of a comprehensive low @-@ pressure area over the British Is@@ les in a powerful southwest stream . &quot;
on the mountain side of the Alps it breaks through the valleys during the night to the Wednesday of the F@@ öh@@ n .
&quot; as a result , the F@@ öh@@ n blow@@ s up until Thursday morning in the fo@@ oth@@ ills with Bö@@ en from 60 to 100 km / h , partly isolated and especially in the Ur@@ i country with more than 100 km / h . &quot;
&quot; the F@@ öh@@ n can penet@@ rate into the adjacent centre and in the mountains , even or@@ kan@@ cs of more than 120 km / h are possible . &quot;
&quot; while in the north on Wednesday stor@@ my hair for summer temperatures of 23 to 27 degrees , humidity starts to st@@ ow on the mountain slope . &quot;
&quot; here , rain starts , which lasts until Thursday evening . &quot;
&quot; in total , over 100 litres of rain per square meter must be expected in the next 48 hours , depending on the amount of ra@@ inf@@ all over the last few days . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday morning the F@@ öh@@ n blow@@ s the air , as a result a cold front lined with strong , partly swe@@ at@@ y ra@@ inf@@ all from west to east over Switzerland . &quot;
&quot; along with the cold front the wind blow@@ s heavily until turbul@@ ent , and the temperatures go far back . &quot;
&quot; the following days present themselves in the north with 15 to 20 degrees , on the other hand , on weekends it will be sunny and warmer with up to 25 degrees . &quot;
Rome now has a Martin @-@ Luther @-@ Platz
&quot; just under 500 years after the Reformation , there is now a Martin Luther &apos;s place in Rome . &quot;
&quot; in the presence of the city president Ign@@ azi@@ o Marino , a previously nam@@ eless place in the park on the O@@ pp@@ io Hill was christ@@ ened on the name of the German Re@@ formers . &quot;
&quot; at the &quot; Piazza Martin Lu@@ ter@@ o , &quot; he is now honoured as a &quot; German The@@ ologi@@ an of the Reformation . &quot; &quot;
the park is located in the middle of the old Rome right next to the Col@@ os@@ se@@ um .
the nam@@ ing was applied by the work community of the Protestant churches in Rome .
&quot; Jens @-@ Martin Kr@@ use , past@@ or of the Evangel@@ ical Lutheran congregation in Rome , reminded on Wednesday that Protest@@ ants in the city of the Pop@@ es over hundreds of years could often live only in the secret of their faith . &quot;
&quot; in a symbolic way , the square became visible in a symbolic way that their tradition of Christian faith in Rome is welcome . &quot;
Martin Luther ( 14@@ 83 @-@ 15@@ 46 ) held himself as a young August@@ inian mon@@ k around the year 15@@ 10 / 11 several months in Rome .
&quot; at that time , he received the city as a dec@@ ayed sc@@ ap@@ ego@@ at . &quot;
his negative impressions were sc@@ ored by histori@@ ans in his later fight against Rome .
&quot; with his theses , Luther had initiated the division of the western church with his theses . &quot;
hammer artist invested three years in the personal interpretation of the Bible
Jesus with the ( gold plated ) crown is one of the master@@ pieces painted by Ot@@ mar Alt for his Bible .
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost has written the introduction and updated Bible texts .
in the beginning was the Word ?
&quot; no , not at the Ot@@ mar Old Bible , which now appeared with gorgeous pictures . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning was the picture for Ot@@ mar Alt , who formulated his very personal interpre@@ tations of biblical stories on paper and canvas in 150 motifs . &quot;
his &quot; language &quot; with colorful colors and imagin@@ ative forms has received the 75 @-@ year @-@ old - which is by no means syn@@ onymous with &quot; funny &quot; pictures .
&quot; on the contrary : adapted to the respective topics , this can be quite glo@@ omy . &quot;
&quot; about three years Ot@@ mar Alt worked on his Bible project , for which he made a subjective @-@ artistic choice from the many theme areas of the &quot; Book of Books . &quot; &quot;
&quot; cycles arise that focus on topics such as cross way , pl@@ agues , commandments or fa@@ ther@@ hood . &quot;
&quot; with this , he spont@@ aneously fascinated several partners : this applies to the Luther Verlag with its the@@ ological orientation as well as for the Kettler publishing house with its emphasis on art books . &quot;
and there is mainly the author Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost who studied painting with the respective Bible passages on the basis of painting .
&quot; he interpreted the Bible passages from Ot@@ mar Old and thus translated into today , in current contex@@ ts . &quot;
these texts are like verbal mirror by Al@@ ts P@@ ainting .
&quot; embedded between the original Bible quote by Martin Luther and a set of the artist , who formulated his very personal thoughts on the particular situation . &quot;
the jewelry cord has golden letters .
&quot; thus , the 75 @-@ year @-@ old gives twice a deep insight into his soul , his emotions . &quot;
this is a high degree of intim@@ acy .
&quot; emotions were ultimately trig@@ gers for the Bible project : Ot@@ mar Alt , born 1940 in Wern@@ ig@@ ero@@ de and grew up in Berlin , comes from a family that belonged to the strict Protestant Herr@@ n@@ hu@@ ter Order . &quot;
&quot; since the education happened with the cane , Ot@@ mar Alt re@@ members . &quot;
I have tried to re@@ vise this so that I may also return to the Lord with the Lord .
&quot; his second concern is to keep art more important in fast @-@ moving times : &quot; &quot; the perception of image worlds is shaped by advertising today , and it is no@@ isy . &quot;
symbol@@ ism is being displac@@ ed .
artists have a different desire and pleasure to show things .
pictures always have something mysterious and are not decorative .
&quot; in this respect , I am a din@@ osau@@ r . &quot;
&quot; Ot@@ mar Alt wants to let the viewers fall into the images , let them look at them , discover and sense what force they have : &quot; the picture seeks his counter@@ part . &quot;
&quot; Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost opened on Tuesday at the presentation of the Ot@@ mar Old Bible in the Ot@@ mar Alt Foundation , &quot; always &quot; a lover of Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts art : &quot; I like how he understands life with his paintings . &quot;
&quot; I did not pay attention to grasp the Bible completely , but also selected the most important , mysterious topics . &quot;
&quot; this was not a cooperation at eye level , &quot; &quot; says Alt@@ ep@@ ost : &quot; here it &apos;s about the pictures , the text only explains . &quot; a pictures Bible was created . &quot;
&quot; for Hans Mö@@ h@@ ler from Luther @-@ Verlag , this work is an invitation to deep@@ en his life and to find freedom . &quot;
Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts &apos;s pictures speak for Mö@@ h@@ ler both the ( biblical ) language of love and the responsibility .
&quot; a part of the origin@@ als - paper and canvas images - will be presented for the first time in an exhibition , which will be opened in the Ot@@ mar Alt Foundation on November 15th . &quot;
start of construction for BM@@ X
&quot; a year later , almost everything was finished - but before the official opening of the BM@@ X railway was already finished . &quot;
&quot; fail@@ ures in politics and administration ensured the dr@@ au@@ ght , especially among the residents who did not want the train to end@@ ure . &quot;
&quot; so hills depos@@ ited , new space searched - now with formal planning and application for building permission . &quot;
&quot; the approval will be received in October , the first municipal counc@@ ill@@ or Sabine Mos@@ eb@@ ach @-@ Bo@@ ck was now able to communicate in the children &apos;s and youth affairs committee . &quot;
&quot; I hope this year will happen again , &quot; she said . &quot;
it should then be started with the work of the former indoor swimming pool without &quot; further remembrance . &quot;
DF@@ B intensi@@ fies engagement for refugees
&quot; the DF@@ B extends its commitment to refugees by 2019 , while the Bundes@@ liga puts a clear sign on the weekend . &quot;
the football is responding to the rising situation in Germany and sec@@ ures politicians to help tackle the problems they encounter .
&quot; I think this is the biggest challenge of our country since re@@ unification . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; in principle no one can say that nothing is about me , I have nothing to do with it . &quot;
&quot; this must be interesting for everyone to get a grip on this subject , &quot; &quot; said DF@@ B boss Wolfgang Nier@@ sbach . &quot;
&quot; at the annual meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel on 23 September in Berlin , he wants to discuss the refugee situation in Germany intensively . &quot;
&quot; I am in the Chancellor &apos;s office next Wednesday , and meet the Minister of State Mrs. Ö@@ zo@@ ğ@@ u@@ z and the chan@@ cell@@ or . &quot;
&quot; the topic will certainly play a central role , &quot; he announced . &quot;
the football can and may help .
but the crucial switches have to put politics .
the German Football Association therefore has extended its refugee initiative &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; by four years .
&quot; we ensured that this programme continues until 2019 , &quot; declared Nier@@ sbach on the edge of the UEF@@ A meeting in St. Julian &apos;s / Malta . &quot;
some federal li@@ gi@@ sts also support this program .
&quot; already on this weekend , the 36 professional clubs set out a clear sign when they are on the left Tri@@ kot@@ er@@ mel instead of the usual sponsor logo ( Her@@ mes ) to &quot; &quot; We Help - # Refu@@ ge@@ es@@ Welcome &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; we also want to make clear that everyone should help , where and how they can only , &quot; said Le@@ verk@@ usen Motorsport Director Ru@@ di Völ@@ ler of the &quot; Bild &quot; Zeitung ( Tuesday ) and described the project as &quot; self @-@ evident . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the drama @-@ drama goes every one , nobody can see it away . &quot;
&quot; we can use football federal li@@ gi@@ sts , no , we have to use our radi@@ ance , our influence and opportunities to help the many refugees who have suffered so incredibly , &quot; &quot; said Her@@ tha @-@ Manager Michael Pre@@ etz . &quot;
H@@ offen@@ heim CEO Peter Ret@@ tig said of a &quot; prominent sign of the league . &quot;
the national team of the women invites 100 refugees to Halle / Sa@@ ale for the Euro @-@ qualification game against Hungary on this Friday .
Nier@@ sbach marked the support of refugees as &quot; a large community of German football . &quot;
&quot; that all 36 licence agreements in their villages had started their own projects , be great . &quot;
just as great is that small and smallest clubs are active there .
&quot; the message &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome , &quot; which we spent , is lived in football . &quot;
&quot; this is of enormous importance , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; in this and next year , the association will provide 300 000 Euro for the integration of refugees together with the DF@@ B selection and the German federal government . &quot;
&quot; the clubs have already called the whole sum for 2015 , &quot; &quot; reported Nier@@ sbach . &quot;
reports : SAP Executive Officer loses an eye on accident
&quot; the Executive leader of Europe &apos;s largest software group , Bill Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t , report@@ edly lost the left eye by a down@@ fall in early July . &quot;
&quot; during the accident on the stairs in the house of his brother in the USA he fell to a water glass after midnight , which he had worn in the left hand , reports the &quot; Wirtschafts@@ woche &quot; on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; he is nearly ble@@ eding , he was power@@ less , then he pul@@ ls out onto the street - that he told us so last week , &quot; says the &quot; W@@ IW@@ O &quot; SAP co @-@ founder Has@@ so Platt@@ ner . &quot;
&quot; Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t , however , could do his work . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of October we met before the Supervisory Board meeting in Wall@@ dorf , &quot; &quot; said Platt@@ ner . &quot;
&quot; the 54 @-@ year @-@ old manager is at the meeting and &quot; &quot; full of work &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t announced in an interview with the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung ( Thursday issue ) , which will come back to Germany in October and continue to lead the software company . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m full for SAP , full in my job . &quot;
&quot; of course , I was in regular contact with the Supervisory Board and its chairman Has@@ so Platt@@ ner , &quot; said Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t of the &quot; SZ . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t usually comm@@ utes between Germany and the USA , but since the summer he was no longer in the German SAP headquarters in Wall@@ dorf . &quot;
&quot; it is important to him to go to the public with such a personal story , said the manager of the &quot; SZ &quot; : &quot; everyone can happen . &quot;
it is important to stand up again when you fall .
Mc@@ L@@ aren @-@ Re@@ placement pilot Magn@@ us@@ sen besides skir@@ m@@ ish ...
&quot; Magn@@ us@@ sen we@@ ather@@ ed a photo and explained , he suffered the injury when he was over@@ thrown by the wheel . &quot;
&quot; he therefore comes as little as spare car for the two common mar@@ bles Fernando Al@@ on@@ so and J@@ ens@@ on Button , as a week later at the Grand Prix of Japan . &quot;
football : BV@@ B without Re@@ us vs. Kr@@ as@@ no@@ dar : turn@@ table in the gate
&quot; at Bor@@ us@@ sia Dortmund , all hopes for a com@@ eback of Marco Re@@ us in the first group play of the Europa League were finally crus@@ hed . &quot;
the national player will also be missing the championship leader of the Bundes@@ liga in the Du@@ el with the F@@ K Kr@@ as@@ no@@ dar on Thursday ( 7 p.m. / Sky ) .
&quot; unfortunately , we cannot fall back on him , &quot; said Thomas Tu@@ chel on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; whether Re@@ us will be back on Sunday in the Bundes@@ liga @-@ Top@@ spiel against Le@@ verk@@ usen , the BV@@ B coach was open : &quot; we expect a return from him to the training on Friday . &quot;
&quot; given the high load of its pro@@ s , Tu@@ chel will not only change its tri@@ bal position on the Re@@ us position . &quot;
so he announced a change on the door@@ ke@@ epers position .
&quot; therefore , Roman Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller occupies the place of the master man Roman Bür@@ k@@ ki . &quot;
&quot; he trains at an absolute top level , &quot; the football teacher praised the World Champion . &quot;
&quot; however , if Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller is used in all Europa League games in the future , Tu@@ va left open . &quot;
&quot; with high probability , it will also be able to contest the second game . &quot;
&quot; the for@@ e@@ word of fellow players Re@@ us , that the final entry for the BV@@ B in the Europa League must be the target , keeps middle @-@ field player Julian W@@ eig@@ l for comprehen@@ sible : &quot; &quot; Marco is not so wrong . &quot;
I think we have a good chance to access the title .
Robot@@ er@@ au@@ tos : government wants leadership for Germany
&quot; according to the will of the Federal Government , Germany should be a technological pioneer when changing the car . &quot;
&quot; on Wednesday , the Federal Cab@@ inet adopted a strategy paper from the House of Transport Minister Alexander Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t ( CS@@ U ) , which included investments in the expansion of digital infrastructure . &quot;
Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t spoke on Wednesday in Frankfurt on the outskirts of the I@@ AA car fair from a &quot; new era of mobility . &quot;
&quot; automated and connected driving will increase traffic safety and ensure less traffic , said Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t . &quot;
he also wants to discuss the subject with his counter@@ part colleagues from the G@@ 7 states that come together with industry representatives at the I@@ AA .
&quot; among other things , the policy paper of the Ministry of Transport empha@@ sizes the importance of mobile broad@@ band expansion and a fast access to digital radio transmission . &quot;
&quot; for testing new technology , there is currently a test track on the motorway 9 in Bavaria . &quot;
&quot; in order that the driver &quot; does not impose additional liability risks , &quot; the Federal Government wants to &quot; examine the legal framework &quot; and , where necessary , adapt to the new developments . &quot;
&quot; in this way , Germany wants to make international use of the permissible maximum speed for self @-@ prop@@ elled cars from 10 to 130 km / h . &quot;
the Federal Government also wants to apply for a change in the Vienna Convention that has so far only presented the human being as a driver .
&quot; with automated driving , the car increasingly takes the lead , the driver becomes more and more towards the passenger . &quot;
the technology is based mainly on sensors and cameras that capture the environment and process data in seconds .
&quot; according to a study presented by the Ministry of Economy , highly automated driving on motor@@ ways by 2020 will be technically possible . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , mobile vehicles on public roads are expected to be expected only far after 2020 . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; the digital networking of the passenger can lead to greater safety and efficiency in road traffic , &quot; said the SPD traffic practitioner S@@ ör@@ en Bar@@ to@@ l . &quot;
&quot; however , the question of liability in accidents and the safety of the driver &apos;s personal data must be clearly clari@@ fied . &quot;
&quot; however , the Germans still look scep@@ tical about the Germans - much more than French or Americans . &quot;
&quot; the survey conducted on Wednesday at the AA on behalf of the For@@ sa Institute on behalf of the EU@@ M survey comes to the result that only eight percent of Germans believe that autonomous cars will prevail in the next ten years , 32 percent count only in 20 years with this , 31 per cent believe not at all . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; anyway , drivers in Germany are not ready to rely completely on a self @-@ prop@@ elled vehicle . &quot;
&quot; following a survey of the Bit@@ kom digital network , only seven percent would agree to give control over the entire journey on all roads . &quot;
&quot; on the motorway , this could represent 15 percent in flowing traffic , in St@@ au 45 percent . &quot;
good every fourth would leave the car under no circumstances .
B@@ oll says team and double start at ping @-@ p@@ ong EM
&quot; at the end of the year , Düssel@@ dorfer intends to beat only in singles from 25 September to 4 October . &quot;
the final decision is to fall by 22 September at the latest .
&quot; this is a huge loss for our team . &quot;
&quot; the boys experienced it in the morning . &quot;
&quot; but we are strong enough to get the title without Timo , &quot; &quot; said the trainer Jörg Ro@@ ß@@ kopf during the EM apprenticeship in Düsseldorf . &quot;
&quot; at this time , B@@ oll was on the flight to a long @-@ term scheduled sponsor@@ ship event in China . &quot;
the 34 year old German champion is expected to come back on Friday .
&quot; without Timo is the dis@@ advantage , we are no longer such a clear favourite , &quot; &quot; stated Single European champion Dimit@@ ri@@ j Ov@@ t@@ char@@ ov . &quot;
&quot; the Ham@@ el@@ ner , who performs the S@@ etz@@ list in Y@@ ek@@ ater@@ in@@ burg , also reminded the EM 2013 in Sch@@ wech@@ at . &quot;
&quot; at that time Timo also lack@@ ed , and we have become European champion . &quot;
&quot; that is why we should ori@@ ent ourselves , &quot; &quot; explained the world &apos;s rank @-@ list @-@ fifth . &quot;
the English football player Luke Sha@@ w of Manchester United has drawn a serious injury on the right leg .

Gaul@@ tier feels too old for an enf@@ ant terrible
the designer Jean Paul Gaul@@ tier ( 63 ) presented an exhibition about his work on Wednesday in Munich .
the highlights : man@@ ne@@ qu@@ ins that look shock@@ ingly human thanks to video proj@@ ections .
&quot; they bear the spectacular creations of the French designer , who , among other things , became the great star of the fashion scene with Mad@@ onn@@ as stage out@@ fits - and that he put men in sk@@ irts . &quot;
&quot; I can no longer say that I am the enf@@ ant terrible of Haute Cou@@ ture , because I have white hair . &quot;
&quot; in the past it was ble@@ ached , meanwhile it is genuine , &quot; &quot; said Gaul@@ tier . &quot;
&quot; for the visitors of the exhibition &quot; From The Side@@ walk To The Cat@@ walk &quot; ( From the side@@ walk to the cat@@ walk ) , which is to be seen from September 18th at the Kunsth@@ alle der Hyp@@ o @-@ Kultur@@ stiftung , it is fortunate that the designer has changed his initially distr@@ acting attitude to a show about his person . &quot;
&quot; he said , &quot; &quot; for me , an exhibition so@@ unded a little after death , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; when you die , you get to the museum . &quot;
the impressive collection had previously been in the Canadian Montreal and Paris station .
&quot; it &apos;s about so much more than just beautiful dresses , &quot; &quot; said the director of the Kunsth@@ alle , Roger Die@@ ther . &quot;
&quot; it is about tolerance , acceptance and the vision of an open society . &quot;
&quot; the exhibits give an insight into the artist &apos;s work , written in fashion history , without ever completing a training . &quot;
&quot; chron@@ ologically , the show is not built , but it is an excell@@ ently chore@@ ograph@@ ed overall artwork , for which much effort was done : to refres@@ h the dolls , for example , a sty@@ list was engaged . &quot;
14 tons of material have gone ast@@ ray to Munich according to the cur@@ ator Thierry @-@ Maxim@@ e L@@ ori@@ ot .
just before the start of the Oktober@@ fest there was still a special delic@@ acy : a leather pants spring outfit with cor@@ set .
Hei@@ di meets Madonna .
&quot; he was always interested in strong women ( &quot; &quot; women are smar@@ ter than men &quot; &quot; ) and for people who are a bit different , Gaul@@ tier said . &quot;
Gaul@@ tier &apos;s old Teddy ist also exhibited in the exhibition .
&quot; he stands for the first , delic@@ ately fashi@@ oned foot@@ steps of the designer . &quot;
&quot; as a child ( he was not a good student and bad in football ) he dressed his Teddy B@@ H@@ s and dresses , said Gaul@@ tier . &quot;
&quot; playing with a doll , his parents would not have allowed him . &quot;
he later taught the design of fashion himself .
he st@@ ole fashion magazines and looked at the designs of other designers like Gaul@@ tier in Munich told .
&quot; later on , I bought it naturally . &quot;
&quot; for his first own fashion show , he did not have to pay the models . &quot;
&quot; they got nothing , but could keep the clothes . &quot;
jewelry instead of Gard@@ ine - Pl@@ au@@ ener top as fashion niche
&quot; in the past , we went to the long embroi@@ dery machines in and around Pl@@ auen to make meters . &quot;
&quot; the embroi@@ dered fabrics and lace were created in large quantities for customers , for example to work on ceilings and she@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; this alone does not work anymore , explains Andreas Rein@@ hardt , Managing Director of Mo@@ desp@@ itz Pl@@ auen . &quot;
&quot; instead , fashion is important again . &quot;
&quot; in the early times of the Pl@@ au@@ ener Spitze , fashion plays a major role , was then displac@@ ed by the Heim@@ tex@@ ti@@ lin@@ dustrie - and is now re@@ discovered as a niche . &quot;
&quot; Rein@@ hardt calls some examples : lace in jewelry , with accessories such as bags and with regional costumes . &quot;
&quot; at all , the so @-@ called Vintage @-@ fashion , inspired by past styl@@ istic periods , is an increasing order potential . &quot;
those who don &apos;t have ni@@ ches in the textile industry in Germany are no longer on the market .
&quot; with us , they already have half of all orders . &quot;
&quot; together with nine other companies , Mo@@ desp@@ itz Pl@@ auen is a member of the Pl@@ au@@ ener peak and embroi@@ dery industry association . &quot;
only they are allowed to wear the protected label .
&quot; over the last 15 years , around 80 percent of sales have been broken off . &quot;
there is almost no interest in private specialist shops and wholesale trade .
our products hardly reach customers in this way .
&quot; nowadays , the bulk goods are manufactured much cheaper in the Asian region and sold almost exclusively via chains . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
there are enough reasons for new ways .
&quot; the industry association also tries to score points by environmental awareness , such as C@@ ord@@ ula Bauer from the Emb@@ ro@@ i@@ dery in Fal@@ k@@ enstein : &quot; since this year , we have been leading a quality seal that shows that we produce ec@@ ologically and socially acceptable . &quot;
Rein@@ hardt adds : &quot; this also applies to the materials used . &quot;
graduate designer U@@ te Schmidt teaches at the Schne@@ eber@@ ger Auß@@ enst@@ elle der West@@ s@@ ächs@@ ische Hochschule Z@@ wick@@ au - at the Faculty of Applied Arts - and speci@@ alis@@ es in embroi@@ der@@ ies and sp@@ ik@@ es .
&quot; in order to achieve something against the competition from the Asian region , you have to find high quality and innovative products . &quot;
this takes time and courage .
&quot; there is a voltage field between the fresh@@ est ideas of the designers and the companies that have to think economically , &quot; Schmidt says . &quot;
&quot; therefore , an existing design is often only slightly varied to keep a customer base . &quot;
&quot; a few years ago , textile designers Kat@@ i Reu@@ ter revi@@ ved the historic snow@@ ball point . &quot;
the machine stands at some places small kitchens .
&quot; the Pl@@ au@@ ener Gold@@ schmi@@ ede@@ master Bianca Hal@@ leb@@ ach @-@ Kr@@ au@@ ße was inspired by this : &quot; before , I couldn &apos;t do anything with a traditional Pl@@ au@@ ener peak . &quot;
now they use the snow@@ ball tip for their jewelry .
in an elaborate method it shapes the pattern in silver .
&quot; many people in the region identify with the topic Pl@@ au@@ ener Spitze - young and old , &quot; Reu@@ ters says . &quot;
&quot; it also supplies to the USA , to Australia and to Finland - especially to customers whose ancestors lived in Pl@@ auen and surroundings , and who would like to have a souven@@ ir . &quot;
&quot; with this , I see my jewelry as a modern ambassador of the Pl@@ au@@ ener Point . &quot;
Disney plans new &quot; Mary P@@ opp@@ ins &quot; film
&quot; you shouldn &apos;t be touched by legends , but Disney &apos;s still vent@@ uring into a new movie of its classic &quot; Mary P@@ opp@@ ins . &quot; &quot;
&quot; however , according to &quot; Entertainment Week@@ ly , &quot; however , it is not about a new movie , but a kind of continuation , which plays 20 years after the first film with the magical child girl . &quot;
it is about the experience of the N@@ anny with the family B@@ anks in times of the world economic crisis in England .
anyone who plays P@@ opp@@ ins for more than 50 years after Ju@@ lie Andre@@ ws is still uncle@@ ar .
&quot; but the director already stood firm : Rob Marshall , recently with &quot; In@@ to the W@@ oods &quot; in the cinema . &quot;
XI insist@@ ed on opening the economy wider for the world
&quot; the economy must open wider to the outside in order to promote growth , President Xi J@@ in@@ ping said on Tuesday of a group that was entrusted with the steering of reform . &quot;
&quot; China was aimed at attrac@@ ting foreign investments and know @-@ how and improving the strategies for business start @-@ ups , &quot; he said in a speech at the 16th session of the Central Leadership Group for the deep@@ ening of a comprehensive reform . &quot;
&quot; to promote new spin @-@ ups and promote reforms will bring about new momentum and vitality and provide new space for economic growth , Xi said . &quot;
&quot; the management group has adopted a series of guidelines , including a negative list to regulate the market access , relaxation of border controls policies , promotion of state enterprises ( SO@@ E ) , priv@@ ates capital , and over@@ hau@@ l of the inhabitants milking system . &quot;
&quot; after the statement , a negative list is created , identified by sectors and companies that are not eligible for investments . &quot;
the system is gradually tested and improved by testing programs .
&quot; the initiative is of importance as it as@@ signs a greater role in the allocation of resources to the market , ensuring a right @-@ wing business environment and designed the market more open , said the statement . &quot;
the government will also lo@@ osen control over the powers transmitted to the companies and make sure companies decide how to conduct their business .
the statement also said that China will allow border regions to explore new models of cross @-@ border economic cooperation and new mechanisms for promoting regional growth .
&quot; as part of an offer to open state @-@ controlled sectors , further areas for private investment will be opened . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the government will not change its policy towards foreign investments and will protect the ri@@ ght@@ ful interests of foreign @-@ financed companies and provide better services for them , &quot; &quot; said the statement . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it is easier for foreigners to apply for a permanent residence permit or &quot; Green Card &quot; by optimi@@ zing the requirements and facilit@@ ating the application process . &quot;
&quot; to guarantee the law of the lawyers to exercise their activities , and to use professional judges and prosec@@ ut@@ ors , was also discussed at a meeting . &quot;
&quot; at the meeting , Prime Minister Li Ke@@ q@@ i@@ ang and important leaders such as Li@@ u Y@@ un@@ shan and Z@@ hang Ga@@ oli participated , as reported in a statement issued after the meeting . &quot;
EU wants to double mer@@ cury @-@ limit value in pre@@ dat@@ ors
&quot; the European Commission wants to double the limit values for mer@@ cury in large pre@@ dat@@ ors and , in order to aver@@ t a significantly higher dose of the nervous system . &quot;
&quot; the consumer organization food@@ watch , which is a corresponding working paper of the EU , sharp@@ ly cri@@ tici@@ zed the plans : &quot; risks and side effects of missing industrial and environmental policy are passed on with full force of pregnant and to@@ dd@@ lers , &quot; explained Matthias Wolf@@ sch@@ midt from food@@ watch . &quot;
&quot; according to Wolf@@ sch@@ midt , the limits of nerve gas are to be raised for large fish at the end of the food chain , such as shar@@ ks or s@@ word@@ fish for &quot; economic reasons &quot; from one to two milli@@ grams of mer@@ cury per kil@@ ogram of fish . &quot;
&quot; large pre@@ dat@@ or fish , however , are already so strongly charged with mer@@ cury that , on the basis of the still valid limit values , about 50 per cent of the cat@@ ches must not be sold . &quot;
&quot; after dou@@ bling the limit values , only 14.5 percent would be ru@@ de . &quot;
&quot; in return for this loos@@ ening , the EU wants to tigh@@ ten limit values for other fish from currently 0.5 milli@@ grams to 0.1 milli@@ gram of mer@@ cury per kil@@ ogram . &quot;
&quot; but food@@ watch described this as &quot; trick &quot; because smaller c@@ emet@@ eries , such as car@@ p , are usually so low charged that they already comply with the planned maximum values . &quot;
&quot; the lowering of wast@@ es is therefore &quot; a per@@ fi@@ des distr@@ actions man@@ eu@@ ver , which helps only the economy , &quot; explained Wolf@@ sch@@ midt . &quot;
mer@@ cury is a highly poison@@ ous heavy metal that is highly poison@@ ous over the food chain particularly in pre@@ dat@@ ors .
&quot; the German government therefore war@@ ns that &quot; &quot; already low amounts can cause particularly in un@@ born les@@ ions of the nervous system . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the Federal Environment Ministry states on its homepage with regard to the maximum values in force , but that a &quot; health haz@@ ard to the general population &quot; is not to be expected . &quot;
mer@@ cury is mainly driven by carbon inc@@ iner@@ ation to the environment .
&quot; according to a written information from the Federal Ministry of Environment , the German coal @-@ fired power plants , Ann@@ al@@ ena Ba@@ er@@ bock ple@@ aded more than six tons of mer@@ cury in the year , two thirds of the total amount em@@ itted in Germany . &quot;
&quot; the concentration of mer@@ cury in fish approximately in the Elbe , Rhine and Danube was &quot; permanently and nation@@ wide &quot; , &quot; the &quot; Spiegel &quot; had been cited in March from paper . &quot;
&quot; last year , Europe @-@ wide war@@ nings against mer@@ cury in fish were already among the most commonly reported health risks in the EU warning system RA@@ S@@ FF . &quot;
