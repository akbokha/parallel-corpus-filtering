Obama receives Net@@ any@@ ahu
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu is not just kind@@ a friendly .
the two wanted to talk about the implementation of the international agreement as well as about Te@@ hr@@ an &apos;s dest@@ ab@@ ili@@ zing measures in the Middle East .
&quot; at the meeting , however , it is also to deal with the conflict with the Palestinians and the two @-@ state solution . &quot;
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu has been ten@@ se for years .
Washington cri@@ tici@@ zes the ongoing settlement of Israel and raises Net@@ any@@ ahu &apos;s lack of will in the peace process .
the deal with the two continues to deteri@@ or@@ ate through the deal with the Iran nuclear programme promoted by Obama .
&quot; in March , Net@@ any@@ ahu said at the invitation of the Republi@@ cans before the U.S. Congress a controversial speech , which was partly regarded as an aff@@ ront against Obama . &quot;
&quot; speech was not discussed with Obama , a meeting had rejected this election in Israel with reference to the time ahead . &quot;
&quot; in an emergency call , Professor , his girl@@ friend has shot to have shot &quot;
&quot; in an emergency call , Professor Sh@@ ann@@ on Lamb talked to a somewhat disp@@ uted voice of the police that he shot his girl@@ friend and that the officials would have to come to his home . &quot;
Lamb was it important to emphasize that his &quot; sweet dog &quot; was still alive and probably excited and he said the family contacts of dead woman could be found on the mobile phone .
&quot; inside the house , the officials found the cor@@ p@@ ses of A@@ my Pr@@ enti@@ ss and a hand@@ written note , which was scrat@@ ched on a white block , I loved A@@ my and she is the only woman who ever loved me . &quot;
&quot; there was no indication that Lamb , who had traveled in two online courses for the Delta State University in Cle@@ vel@@ and , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , had already made 300 miles to the school grounds where he shot and killed a popular historical professor , E@@ than Schmidt , at the door to his office . &quot;
Delta State University Polic@@ eman Lyn@@ n Bu@@ ford said that university staff listened to shooting at 10 : 18 o &apos;clock .
he said that Lamb did the fatal emergency some@@ time after that .
until the end of the day there was another death : Lamb took the life when the police enc@@ ir@@ cl@@ ed him .
&quot; one day after shooting at the university , the students and lec@@ turers compelled to hide behind closed doors , the authorities still try to get an idea of what Lamb motiv@@ ates . &quot;
&quot; the details published by investig@@ ators at both ends of the state , as well as what students and staff who knew him , helped to draw a picture of a talented but possibly difficult teacher . &quot;
students said they were looking forward to his lessons .
&quot; the police in Gau@@ tier , where Pr@@ enti@@ ss died , said he did not have a history of violence or a criminal pre@@ history . &quot;
&quot; Lamb himself had mentioned Lamb in a book written by him in which he mentioned the &quot; &quot; wonderful people &quot; &quot; with whom he shared his academic life . &quot;
&quot; both taught in the Department of Social Sciences and History , whose faculty includes 17 members , and many students visited courses of both . &quot;
at the same time there were some inc@@ lin@@ ations about problem@@ atic behavi@@ ors .
&quot; a student , Brand@@ on Be@@ avers , who praised Lamb , said he also seemed a little nervous and nervous as if something was wrong with him . &quot;
&quot; another student , Mik@@ el Sy@@ kes , said that he told him that he had to do with stress at the end of the academic year 2014 @-@ 15 . &quot;
Lamb had previously asked the Delta State University for health reasons and said that he had any health problem .
this year he only taught two online courses .
&quot; the latest changes in the university &apos;s employment policy meant that the promotion , for which Lamb had worked so hard for him , would not guarantee an automatic path to an appointment as Assistant Professor . &quot;
&quot; University President William LA@@ FOR@@ GE said he didn &apos;t know anything about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs &apos;s idea . &quot;
they are questions that Lamb can no longer answer .
&quot; after the escape from the campus , the police later found Lam@@ bs , when he returned to Miss@@ issi@@ ppi from Ar@@ kan@@ s@@ as . &quot;
&quot; before he could be arrested , Lamb indul@@ ged himself with a .@@ 38 cali@@ ber gun at the back@@ yard of a house about a mile south of his parents house on the outskirts of Green@@ ville , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , said Washington County Cor@@ oner Met@@ el Johnson . &quot;
his car was still in the dri@@ v@@ eway .
&quot; it was not immediately clear why he went to this house , but Johnson said she believed that he knew the people who lived there . &quot;
Lamb grew up in the area .
&quot; Lamb began his work at the university , which has 3,@@ 500 students in a city of about 12@@ ,000 inhabitants and taught ge@@ ography and ped@@ agog@@ y . &quot;
he did his doc@@ torate in the spring of ped@@ agog@@ y .
&quot; one of the long@@ time friends of Lam@@ bs described him as intelligent , charis@@ matic and funny . &quot;
&quot; Car@@ la H@@ air@@ ston said she was 15 and he was 20 , when she met together with friends . &quot;
&quot; she and her friends were in high school , and he was the cool elderly guy who tried several years to teach her the guitar playing . &quot;
he was the women &apos;s black back then .
&quot; all girls melt away when he was there , &quot; &quot; said H@@ air@@ ston , now 40 and resident in the Jackson subur@@ b of Brand@@ on . &quot;
Lamb and Pr@@ enti@@ ss were obviously some time together .
&quot; Lamb &quot; I have killed my wife , &quot; but there was no diploma from a marriage . &quot;
&quot; they had a dog named Light@@ ning , who lived with them in the brick house , adjacent to a Ba@@ you in Gau@@ tier . &quot;
the police said that the dog was fine .
&quot; the ex @-@ husband of Pr@@ enti@@ ss , Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , said they were divor@@ ced 15 years ago , but friends stayed and had a daughter who was now 19 years old . &quot;
&quot; she was totally destroyed at the ground , &quot; said O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en about his daughter . &quot;
she and her mother were absolutely best friends .
&quot; O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said he never met Lamb , but through his daughter Ab@@ ig@@ ail he heard that Lamb was interested in music and played blues . &quot;
Lamb met Pr@@ enti@@ ss when he and Ab@@ ig@@ ail started three years ago both in a summer fair .
later they played together the one or the other gig .
O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said his daughter writes and sings its own music .
Pr@@ enti@@ ss was a nur@@ se who worked for various companies online .
&quot; Mike Sha@@ ffer , a bar@@ man and sometimes entertainment coordin@@ ator at The Ju@@ le@@ p Room , a weak@@ ly lit bar near Gau@@ tier , said that he finished Lamb and Pr@@ enti@@ ss Night at night 5th September after the Lamb had finished his guitar and harmon@@ ica game in front of a spar@@ se audience . &quot;
there was no indication that something was not right .
&quot; just a happy couple , &quot; he said . &quot;
we were fr@@ aming and j@@ oked each other .
I mean they both had a good sense of j@@ okes .
&quot; Schmidt , the dead professor , conducted the first semester seminars and specialised in American Indi@@ genous and Col@@ onial History , said Don Allan Mit@@ ch@@ ell , an English professor at the school . &quot;
he was married and had three little children .
he studied at the Empor@@ ia State University in K@@ ans@@ as and was president of his fr@@ at@@ ernity and the student committee .
&quot; on Tuesday evening about 900 people attended the Delta State Campus in Cle@@ vel@@ and , including lec@@ turers , employees , students and members of the community at a cand@@ l@@ el@@ ight memorial . &quot;
&quot; Sch@@ mid@@ ts &apos;s wife Li@@ z and his brother Jeff Schmidt also participated in the M@@ ahn@@ wa@@ che , while the university choir &quot; B@@ right Mor@@ ning Star &quot; and &quot; Ama@@ zing Grace &quot; sang . &quot;
the lessons will be res@@ um@@ ed on Wednesday .
&quot; we try to move our students to return , &quot; said LA@@ FOR@@ GE . &quot;
the crisis is over .
this is a day of healing .
&quot; A@@ my and Rog@@ el@@ io Soli@@ s reported Cle@@ vel@@ and , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi . &quot;
&quot; associated Press Auth@@ ors E@@ mil@@ y Wag@@ ster P@@ ett@@ us in Green@@ ville , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , and Rebecca Sant@@ ana in New Orleans contributed to this report . &quot;
&quot; this story has been corrected to reflect that the police now say that Lamb was making an emergency call after he shot Schmidt , and that he called Pr@@ enti@@ ss as his wife in his emergency call , but there is no indication that the two have ever married . &quot;
Toys R Us plans to hire fewer workers for the Holiday Season
Toys R Us says that there will not be so many Christmas season employees as last year but the toy and baby products dealer says that he will give the currently employed staff and seasonal workers a chance to work more hours .
&quot; the company said it plans to employ 4@@ 0,000 people in stores and distribution centers throughout the country . in the Christmas season 2014 , 45@@ ,000 employees were employed . &quot;

&quot; while the holidays are even months away , the Christmas business is near@@ ing , and companies are preparing to hire time workers to equi@@ p stores with employees that sell , ship and deliver products . &quot;
Michael J. Fox j@@ okes about his &quot; Date &quot; with Princess Diana
the premiere of &quot; Back to the Future &quot; was a great moment for Michael J. Fox .
it was remarkable also for personal reasons .
&quot; we sat in the theater for the ro@@ y@@ als , and I notice that the seat is empty next to me , and it becomes clear to me that Princess Diana will sit next to me , &quot; he said in a trailer for an upcoming documentary &quot; Back in Time . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the film begins , and it comes to mind that I am a simul@@ ated t@@ apping and an arm length of it to be with the Princess of Wales at a date . &quot;
&quot; back in Time , &quot; a documentary about Back to the Future , presents interviews with Fox , Lea Thom@@ p@@ son and Christopher Lloyd , as well as with director Robert Z@@ em@@ eck@@ is and producer Steven Spiel@@ berg . &quot;

&quot; back in Time &quot; will be on VO@@ D , DVD and in selected cinem@@ as in October . &quot;
UN leader says there is no military solution in Syria
&quot; Secretary @-@ General B@@ an K@@ i @-@ moon says his response to Russia &apos;s reinforced military support for Syria is : &quot; there is no military solution &quot; of the conflict that lasted nearly five years , and more weapons will wor@@ sen the violence and mis@@ ery for millions of people . &quot;
&quot; the UN leader again calls on all parties , including the shared UN Security Council , to unite and support inclusive negotiations for finding a political solution . &quot;
&quot; a press conference on Wednesday announced that he plans to meet the Foreign Ministers of the five Perman@@ ent Member States of the Council - US , Russia , China , Great Britain and France - on the ver@@ ge of the minist@@ erial meeting of the General Assembly in this month to discuss the situation in Syria . &quot;
he regre@@ t@@ ted that the spl@@ its in the Council and within the Syrian people and the regional powers &quot; make this situation in@@ soluble . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; B@@ an asked the five permanent members to show the same solidarity and unity in order to cope with the crisis in Syria , which they demonstrated in at@@ taining nuclear deal with Iran . &quot;
8 Query values that show that Donald Tru@@ mp is serious .
some have tried to brand him as a flop .
others have dismis@@ sed him as a joke .
and some are waiting for a collapse .
&quot; but no matter how some Republi@@ cans try to pull Donald Tru@@ mp from the upper ranks during surveys , it has ( yet ) not working . &quot;
&quot; ten of the last eleven national poll@@ s showed Donald Tru@@ mp in the double @-@ digit range , and some begin to seriously ask what it means for the chances of nom@@ ination of real estate Mog@@ ul@@ s . &quot;
&quot; of course , it is still too early in the election period . &quot;
nobody claims that Tru@@ mp will probably win the Republi@@ can nom@@ ination .
&quot; experts say that at this time in 2011 Rick Per@@ r@@ ys led the lead to the rising Her@@ man C@@ ain , none of which won only one state in the nom@@ ination process . &quot;
and there are many reasons why he would have strug@@ gled in a general election .
but outdoor groups like J@@ eb Bus@@ hes Super P@@ AC and the conservative economic group Club for Growth now recognise Tru@@ mps &apos;s stamina and begin to let their dollars flow to overthrow him .
here are some current survey values that indicate that the real estate is not just a temporary phase :
the popularity values have turned 180 degrees .
&quot; just before Donald Tru@@ mp announced his can@@ did@@ acy in mid @-@ June , a survey at the Mon@@ mouth University revealed that only two of ten re@@ public@@ ans saw the real estate fashion positive . &quot;
&quot; by mid @-@ July , it was 40 percent . &quot;
at the beginning of August there were 52 percent .
now six out of 10 re@@ public@@ ans have a positive outlook of Donald Tru@@ mp .
about three out of ten say they have a negative opinion .
and these figures are in early states .
a qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac vote in I@@ owa reported last week that 60 percent of the Republi@@ cans have a good view of Tru@@ mp .
two thirds of GO@@ P vot@@ ers would be happy with Tru@@ mp as candidates .
&quot; in a survey of CN@@ N / OR@@ C last week , 67 percent of the Republi@@ cans said they would either be &quot; &quot; enthusiastic &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; pleased &quot; &quot; when Tru@@ mp was nominated . &quot;
&quot; only two of ten would say they were &quot; &quot; angry &quot; &quot; when he was the candidate . &quot;
&quot; only Ben Car@@ son manages about the same enthusiasm as Tru@@ mp ( 43 percent say they would be &quot; &quot; enthusiastic &quot; &quot; vs. 40 per cent saying the same about Tru@@ mp ) . &quot;
the next thing in terms of enthusiasm ?
Marco Ru@@ bio with just 21 percent .
&quot; on the other hand 47 percent of the Republi@@ can vot@@ ers say they were &quot; dis@@ satisfied &quot; or &quot; off@@ ended , &quot; if J@@ eb Bush , the favorite of the establishment , would be the candidate . &quot;
a majority of the Republi@@ cans don &apos;t see Tru@@ mps temper@@ ament as a problem .
&quot; while Donald Tru@@ mp is widely cri@@ tici@@ zed for its bom@@ b@@ astic and offensive statements , 52 percent of the Irish vot@@ ers who are the re@@ public@@ ans believe that the real estate is the right temper@@ ament for a president , ABC News / Washington Post on Monday . &quot;
&quot; the same number is valid in the first pres@@ election state of the nation , the State of I@@ owa , where the same 52 percent of the Republi@@ cans think that he has the personality for a Commander @-@ in @-@ Chief , according to Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac last week . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless 44 percent think that he did not have the personality to effectively carry out his office , and almost six of ten independ@@ ents say that his tem@@ per did not fit into the White House , ABC / Post . &quot;
Republi@@ can vot@@ ers get used to the idea .
&quot; when they expose their v@@ ows , Republi@@ can vot@@ ers keep Tru@@ mp for real . &quot;
&quot; if they are asked who wins the GO@@ P nom@@ ination most likely , after a survey of CN@@ N / OR@@ C last week , four out of ten that Tru@@ mp is the best bet . &quot;
this is a change since the time when four of ten end of July replaced their money at J@@ eb Bush .
full disclosure : GO@@ P vot@@ ers did not have the clear@@ est crystal ball in the past .
&quot; at this time in the last cycle , four out of ten re@@ public@@ ans thought that Rick Perry would win the nom@@ ination against just 28 % for the final candidate Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney . &quot;
yet it shows that a variety of GO@@ P vot@@ ers regard Tru@@ mps campaign as plau@@ sible .
&quot; even if the Republi@@ cans gathered around another candidate , Tru@@ mp hits almost everybody . &quot;
&quot; some experts point out that the sh@@ atter@@ ing field probably contributes to Tru@@ mps guidance , while anti @-@ Tru@@ mp support is distributed to more than a dozen other Candi@@ dates . &quot;
&quot; but a pol@@ l of the Mon@@ mouth University in early September shows that in a hyp@@ othe@@ tical head @-@ in @-@ head race between Tru@@ mp and most other Republi@@ can candidates , Tru@@ mp picked up the majority support . &quot;
&quot; before Car@@ ly Fi@@ or@@ ina 13 points Vor@@ sprung , before Marco Ru@@ bio 14 points , before Walker 15 points , before J@@ eb Bush 19 points and finally on Rand Paul , John Ka@@ sich and Chris Christi@@ e 33 points . &quot;
it is a head @-@ in @-@ head race with Ted Cruz .
the only candidate who beats him ?
Ben Car@@ son would over@@ take the entrepren@@ eur with 19 points in a hyp@@ othe@@ tical head @-@ an @-@ head race .
a scar@@ ce majority of Donald Tru@@ mp fans say they have formed their minds .
&quot; a new survey by C@@ BS / NY@@ T on Tuesday reveals that only a little more than half of the vot@@ ers who support Tru@@ mp , say they have for@@ given their votes . &quot;
&quot; of course , much can happen to change that , and no one can really say , never change the mind . &quot;
&quot; 46 per cent said that they leave the door open , in order to change candidates . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , Tru@@ mps is strongest competition at the moment of other out@@ si@@ ders , the neurolog@@ ist Ben Car@@ son , but vot@@ ers who say they have formed their minds are twice as common for Tru@@ mp . &quot;
six out of 10 Republi@@ cans say they agree with Tru@@ mp on immigration .
&quot; since Donald Tru@@ mp , in his election campaign two months ago , immigrants from Mexico called &quot; rap@@ ists , &quot; the immigration of turning and fishing in the public discourse became in 2016 . &quot;
some are worried that the bom@@ b@@ astic explo@@ si@@ veness of Tru@@ mp &apos;s crucial His@@ p@@ ano Americans will keep away from the Republi@@ can Party and to damage re@@ orientation efforts .
&quot; but after the new ABC / Post survey on Monday , six out of 10 Republi@@ cans say that they agree with Tru@@ mp on issues of immigration . &quot;
&quot; so long as the immigration in the spotlight remains , Donald Tru@@ mp seems to do it . &quot;
the fru@@ stration of the government climb@@ s up to new high@@ s .
&quot; on Donald Tru@@ mp and Ben Car@@ son , about half of the support of Republi@@ can vot@@ ers , especially by their out@@ sider status . &quot;
&quot; six out of 10 Republi@@ cans say in the new Mon@@ days pol@@ l of ABC / Post , they prefer a political out@@ sider than someone with government experience . &quot;
and they are angry with Washington .
&quot; a survey conducted by Des Mo@@ ines Register / Blo@@ om@@ berg in I@@ owa two weeks ago shows that three of four I@@ owa Republi@@ cans are fru@@ str@@ ated by the Republi@@ cans in Congress , with 54 percent &quot; uns@@ atis@@ fied &quot; and 21 percent &quot; hell@@ ish . &quot;
&quot; Munich , Sy@@ lt and Co . : the five exclusive residential buildings in Germany &quot;
here in the hobby away is the most expensive residential complex - with a view over the North Sea .
&quot; in the street , one square meter of a rear building cost 7@@ 3.@@ 300 euros . &quot;
&quot; according to Sy@@ lt , the range of objects is naturally limited , &quot; it is said in the study - therefore the high price . &quot;
a new study shows in which particular layers a square meter the most costs .
&quot; of course , 18,@@ 70 Euro per square meter for a student bu@@ de in Munich are not really little . &quot;
&quot; in contrast to Germany &apos;s top location , however , one of the price is like Pe@@ an@@ uts . &quot;
the real estate service provider Angel &amp; Völ@@ ker has published a ranking list of the most exclusive German residential locations - with square metre prices in di@@ zz@@ ying heights .
&quot; there are several tens of thousands of Euro - per square meter , noted . &quot;
but good who can afford it ...
&quot; by the way : in this case , Munich is not at the top here . &quot;
Champions League : Bayern @-@ dream start thanks to Müller and Göt@@ ze
two @-@ fold Tor@@ schu@@ ze in Pi@@ raeus : Bayern @-@ Star Thomas Müller has just one run .
a happy hit by Thomas Müller gave the FC Bayern the way to a deser@@ ved 3 : 0 at the Olympi@@ ak@@ os Pi@@ raeus - then it ran .
a sovereign kick @-@ off of the Champions League season .
&quot; the world champion Thomas Müller and Mario Göt@@ ze gave the FC Bayern a dream start to the &quot; &quot; Mission Mailand &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the team of Trainer P@@ ep Guardi@@ ola won their kick @-@ off in the Champions League at the gre@@ ek record master Olympi@@ ak@@ os in hot atmosphere thanks to g@@ arb@@ age double pack ( 5@@ 2nd / 90@@ . + 2 ) and i@@ dol ( 89@@ . ) earned with 3 : 0 ( 0 : 0 ) .
&quot; the twel@@ v@@ day success in series is to be the first step towards the final on May 28 , 2016 in Italy , where Guardi@@ ola will finally pick up the h@@ enk@@ el@@ pot@@ t to Munich in the third attempt . &quot;
&quot; at his 28th of the matches in the Champions League , Müller received good assistance from the Olympi@@ ak@@ os @-@ Tor@@ wart Roberto , who passed a tribute to the World Championship as a flan@@ k . &quot;
&quot; we will not under@@ estimate them , &quot; Bavaria @-@ captain Philipp Lah@@ m promised before the game at the Kar@@ ais@@ k@@ ak@@ is Stadium in front of 31.@@ 688 hot @-@ bloo@@ ded fans - and the Munich held words . &quot;
they showed a concentrated and dedicated performance without shining .
&quot; Pi@@ raeus had won his latest six home games in the premi@@ er league , among them against well @-@ known clubs such as Manchester United , At@@ l@@ é@@ tico Madrid or Ju@@ vent@@ us Turin . &quot;
2011 Bor@@ us@@ sia Dortmund stum@@ bled here ( 1 : 3 ) .
&quot; but Bavaria , in seven Europ@@ ac@@ up du@@ els with Greek teams un@@ defeated , did not want to be the next victim . &quot;
&quot; they went cour@@ age@@ ously ran , but in their offensive efforts often too resour@@ c@@ eful to work . &quot;
&quot; the attacks have often been introduced to the left outside of Douglas Costa , which rarely occurred against the former Braunschwei@@ ger O@@ mar El@@ ab@@ d@@ ell@@ a@@ ou@@ i . &quot;
Müller had more luck on the right than his flan@@ k struck from the right half @-@ field in the upper right corner .
in the 67@@ th minute the world champion gave the possible 2 : 0 .
the best opportunities in half one had Robert Lew@@ and@@ owski .
&quot; first , when the Olympi@@ ak@@ os @-@ Stür@@ mer Ide@@ ye Brown proposed the Pole of Poland from the line ( 26 . ) . &quot;
&quot; then by direct removal , the go@@ al@@ keeper Roberto with the knee par@@ ked ( 35 . ) . &quot;
&quot; although the Bav@@ arians were acc@@ u@@ stom@@ ed to their acc@@ u@@ stom@@ ed play , Pi@@ raeus could set needle stal@@ ks . &quot;
&quot; but on door@@ ke@@ epers Manuel Neu@@ er , he was dec@@ eased . &quot;
as he drew a shot of Ide@@ ye over the lat@@ te ( 56@@ th ) .
&quot; ahead of New , Guardi@@ ola had to defend a four @-@ chain with David Al@@ aba in the center next to Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng who did it well . &quot;
&quot; Mario Göt@@ ze , after mus@@ cular problems back in the cad@@ re , was first sitting outside . &quot;
&quot; after the final training , the World Cup hero gave green light only after the final training , Sport@@ vor@@ ship Matthias Sam@@ mer spoke with &quot; Sky &quot; : &quot; he who wants to make something different from it is already mal@@ ign@@ ant . &quot;
&quot; even during the first change , Guardi@@ ola decided against him when he brought K@@ ings@@ ley Com@@ an to Lew@@ and@@ owski ( 59 . ) . &quot;
&quot; Göt@@ ze arrived late for Ar@@ tur@@ o Vi@@ dal ( 7@@ 6. ) and made it clear 13 minutes later everything was clear , by El@@ f@@ meter Müller added another . &quot;
in front of the game it had come to Kra@@ w@@ allen in the stadium .
&quot; after a smaller group of partly displac@@ ed Bavaria fans in their audience blo@@ c obviously had prov@@ oked the supporters of host Pir@@ äus with words and gest@@ ures , the security forces interven@@ ed and went against the Munich supporters . &quot;
at least one Bayern @-@ fan was injured out of the stadium .
who smo@@ kes has a higher risk to lose teeth
&quot; who smo@@ kes , does not only harm the lungs , but also the teeth - that suggests a Potsdam long @-@ term study . &quot;
the good news : when wai@@ ver the risk drops rapidly .
smo@@ kers have a significantly higher risk to lose their teeth early .
&quot; this goes out of the long @-@ term study of an international research team , including several employees of the German Institute for Nutrition Research ( DI@@ f@@ E ) in Potsdam . &quot;
&quot; compared to non @-@ smo@@ kers , smo@@ kers had the risk of losing their teeth pre@@ matur@@ ely in order to increase the 2,5@@ - to 3.6 @-@ fold . &quot;
the scientists had observed more than 23.@@ 300 participants .
&quot; causes of tooth decay are c@@ aries and inflamm@@ ations of g@@ um , acc@@ entu@@ ates the DI@@ f@@ E . &quot;
&quot; for this peri@@ od@@ on@@ ti@@ tis , smoking is a risk factor , stress the authors . &quot;
the connection between smoking and tooth loss therefore goes back to more frequent inflamm@@ ations in smo@@ kers .
&quot; not clari@@ fied , to what extent smoking also increases the risk of tooth decay . &quot;
&quot; people who stopped smoking could reduce their risk in a short time , write the researchers in the &quot; Journal of Dental Research . &quot; &quot;
&quot; however , it could take over ten years until the threat to the level of non @-@ smo@@ kers sin@@ ks , explained Dr. Thomas Dietrich from the English University of Birmingham . &quot;
&quot; one must convince people to become non @-@ smo@@ kers , said Head of H@@ einer Bo@@ eing from DI@@ f@@ E : &quot; &quot; smoking reduces the lifetime . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; not smoking is good for lungs and vessels , and according to our findings also results in good dental health until the high age . &quot;
&quot; in Germany , over 20 percent of the population at the age of 65 to 74 years of co@@ hes@@ ion is affected , the DI@@ f@@ E reported . &quot;
earlier studies have already indicated that smoking increases the risk of early tooth loss .
the new long @-@ term study under@@ pinn@@ ed the findings .
arche@@ ologists encounter remn@@ ants of the late Anti@@ quity at Cologne Rhein@@ u@@ fer
&quot; for the repeated time , archaeological finds have been made at the right bank of the Rhine in Cologne . &quot;
&quot; near the building site for the new Rhine bou@@ levard , archae@@ ologists have excav@@ ated skel@@ et@@ ons and remains of historical buildings , said Museum leader Marcus Trier on Tuesday . &quot;
histori@@ ans have been searching for so @-@ called soil monuments since the beginning of the construction work on the Rhine .
&quot; in all building projects in the city district of Cologne , the museum is always drawn up as a specialist for archaeological excav@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; in the third section of the &quot; &quot; Rhein@@ bou@@ lev@@ ards &quot; &quot; the archae@@ ologists have now found five . &quot;
&quot; text documents have already been known that in the 4th century a fortress and in the 8th century stood a church , Trier explained . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the rest of the fortress and the church tower , there was also a cemetery with about 350 tom@@ bs that belonged to the church . &quot;
young woman taken from freight train
&quot; after a young woman arrives at the railway station in the Gei@@ lenk@@ ir@@ chen @-@ Lin@@ dern , the Federal Police asks the population for help . &quot;
&quot; on the early Wednesday morning at 1.@@ 40 hrs , the woman came out towards the train station building at the end of the platform , and was captured by a freight train coming from Mön@@ ch@@ engl@@ adbach . &quot;
&quot; due to the acquisition of the train , it has caused serious injuries to the Federal Police . &quot;
it was treated by emergency medical attention and brought to hospital by rescue forces .
&quot; on the basis of the no@@ c@@ turn@@ al cross @-@ crossing of the young woman , there are no evidence to the civil servants . &quot;
the incident was possibly observed by witnesses or residents have heard acoustic percep@@ tions .
&quot; there are residents or pass@@ ers by Lin@@ der@@ ner Bahn , Zi@@ egel@@ b@@ ä@@ cker@@ weg , Thom@@ as@@ hof@@ strasse and Lei@@ ff@@ ar@@ ther Straße ( L@@ 364 ) . &quot;

EU Commission proposes new court in dispute over T@@ TIP
&quot; &quot; &quot; to def@@ use the dispute over the planned trans@@ atlan@@ tic free trade agreement T@@ TIP , the European Commission has proposed a comprehensive reform of the current arbit@@ ration system . &quot;
&quot; the controversial private arbit@@ ration institutions for disputes between corporations and states should therefore be replaced by a more transparent system , which corresponds to considerably more traditional dishes . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we want to set up a system to trust citizens , &quot; &quot; stated the European commission@@ er Ceci@@ lia Malm@@ ström . &quot;
the Swe@@ de proposes to introduce the proposal as a European negoti@@ ating position in the Free Trade talks with the US .
the German government announced support .
T@@ TIP aims to create the world &apos;s largest free trade zone with 800 million people .
the plans for the reform of the current arbit@@ ration proceedings apply con@@ cre@@ t@@ ely that the EU states and the US jointly determine independent judges for a new investment court .
&quot; they should come to equal parts from the EU , the United States and third countries . &quot;
&quot; for the first time , a second instance is planned . &quot;
it would allow it to raise obj@@ ections against judgments .
&quot; so far , the parties involved agreed with one another to arbit@@ rators , and there was no obj@@ ection to their judgments . &quot;
&quot; in the debate over the past few months , it became clear that citizens were not familiar with the old IS@@ DS system in fair@@ ness and fair@@ ness , commented on Malm@@ ström . &quot;
&quot; in the long term , it wants to work on an international investment course according to its own specifications . &quot;
&quot; there , for example , disputes between Chinese companies and EU states could also be clari@@ fied . &quot;
the investor state arbit@@ ration ( IS@@ DS ) demanded especially by major corporations ( IS@@ DS ) is considered to be one of the main reasons for the great resistance in Europe against T@@ TIP .
&quot; the traditional arbit@@ ration tri@@ bun@@ als are cri@@ tici@@ zed by opponents as a sort of rip justice , which allows the company to break down tax@@ pay@@ ers , har@@ ass national laws , or to impose a reduction in consumer and environmental standards . &quot;
&quot; in the first statements , anti @-@ T@@ TIP @-@ organisations such as Camp@@ act described the proposals of the European Commission as in@@ adequate . &quot;
&quot; above all , it was not critic@@ ised for the already negoti@@ ated free trade agreement with Canada ( C@@ eta ) . &quot;
&quot; by contrast , the German econom@@ ist Matthias Leit@@ nig ( SPD ) described the plans as a major step forward . &quot;
&quot; the Commission considered essential points during the reform , which Federal Minister of Trade signed Sig@@ mar Gabriel in spring with other EU trade ministers . &quot;
the old system of private arbit@@ ral tri@@ bun@@ als is from the table .
the French government also welcomed the plans of Malm@@ ström .
the European business association B@@ US@@ IN@@ ES@@ S@@ EURO@@ PE warned against limiting the possibilities of the economy by too many new rules .
particularly small and medium @-@ sized enterprises could be dis@@ advant@@ aged by this .
&quot; when the talks on the T@@ TIP free trade agreement ( Trans@@ atlan@@ tic Trade and Investment Partnership ) can be concluded , Wednesday remained uncle@@ ar . &quot;
the negotiations have been running since the middle of 2013 .
&quot; however , investor protection has not yet been discussed with the US . &quot;
&quot; originally , a framework for the agreement should already be at the end of this year . &quot;
this date is no longer available .
del@@ ik@@ ater folk by Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens in Hamburg
&quot; eleven years ago , Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens sits on stage in the Cologne Prime Club ( today : Lux@@ or ) . &quot;
&quot; next to him is a fli@@ p@@ chart , on which the shy @-@ acting folk musician recorded the picturesque US state of Michigan with felt pen . &quot;
&quot; the entire audience , about 40 people , is almost seized by St@@ ev@@ ens &apos;s lecture . &quot;
&quot; he tells us about different places , which he repeat@@ ed@@ ely records on the map , about his min@@ u@@ zi@@ ous and delic@@ ately arranged songs . &quot;
&quot; where they were born and how it looks , in his homeland . &quot;
&quot; since then , St@@ ev@@ ens proves to be a wonderfully creative expression . &quot;
&quot; with the 2003 and third album &quot; Gre@@ etings from Michigan : the Great Lake State , &quot; clever composed songs which nest@@ le harmon@@ i@@ ously close to American folk of the late six@@ ties , but can always drift into great op@@ ul@@ ent . &quot;
&quot; the rum@@ our , &quot; &quot; Michigan &quot; &quot; would be the first part of a disc@@ ar@@ ded series : each of the 50 U.S. states should be held in a row . &quot;
&quot; but already in 2004 and in the proximity of the Rhine , &quot; Seven Sw@@ ans &quot; already appeared and positively breaks down certain expectations . &quot;

the album entered the American Bill@@ board charts and is not missing in any annual list of influential music media .
&quot; after very productive experiments , St@@ ev@@ ens then relies on &quot; The Age of AD@@ Z &quot; ( 2010 ) very extensively electronic spare parts . &quot;
&quot; this sixth ordinary studio album is still broad@@ ly orchest@@ rated , but played by programmed sequences or beats and plays with every effect and hall . &quot;
&quot; away from the smaller clubs , the stage shows here become a colourful spectacle of Ne@@ on foreh@@ ead b@@ anding and large fluor@@ escent stage de@@ co . &quot;

Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ ns Stu@@ d at the Premier of the Prime Minister
since his election Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s debut will be eag@@ erly awa@@ ited by the Prime Minister &apos;s fr@@ enz@@ y
the new Labour leader Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n will be holding his debut at the Prime Minister &apos;s fr@@ enz@@ y and for the first time to be put to David Cameron .
&quot; Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will rise to raise the first of his six questions shortly after lunch , whereby his performance is likely to be examined by the media and the Labour MEPs from nearby . &quot;
he called for &quot; less theatre and more facts &quot; at this weekly event .
he also said he could ski@@ p some sessions to leave them to their colleagues .
&quot; the meeting will be the first parliamentary test for Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s leadership , as it comes after his appointment as a member of the shadow cabinet and after his speech at the TU@@ C Annual Meeting on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; in the meantime , during a commem@@ oration ceremony celebrating the 75@@ th anniversary of the Battle of Britain in silence , the Labour leader &apos;s decision to silence the 75@@ th anniversary of the Battle of Britain has been provo@@ king criticism from a number of T@@ ory @-@ MPs and is at the center of several cover @-@ pages @-@ stories in the newspapers . &quot;
&quot; Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s decision to not sing the national an@@ them , has attracted attention &quot;
&quot; a spokes@@ man of Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said he had been &quot; resp@@ ect@@ ful of silence , &quot; and he acknowledged the &quot; hero@@ ism of the Royal Air Force in the Battle of England . &quot; &quot;
&quot; but a member of Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns Schatten@@ kab@@ in@@ ett , O@@ wen Smith , told the BBC Two News@@ night program , he advised the Labour leader to sing the national an@@ them , &quot; independently &quot; of his belief that the monarchy should be abol@@ ished . &quot;
&quot; almost a dozen of Sh@@ adows ministers have refused to serve in Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns , and they called upon differences in the economy , defence and foreign affairs , while less than a sixth of the Par@@ liam@@ entary Party originally supported it as a leader . &quot;
&quot; the Political Cor@@ respon@@ dent of the BBC Robin Bran@@ t says that political differences are also within Labour &quot; &quot; st@@ acking &quot; &quot; and Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns statement on the position of the European Union and the limitation of winn@@ ings . &quot;
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said the TU@@ C conference that Labour would make changes to remove the whole idea of limiting altogether .
&quot; later on , Mr Smith , the Sh@@ adows and R@@ enten Minister said that the party was &quot; very clear &quot; that it was only against government plans to reduce the limit of £ 26@@ ,000 to £ 23@@ ,000 . &quot;
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will be the fifth Labour leader David Cameron ever since he has been T@@ ory leader in the last decade over the Dis@@ patch @-@ Box in the Parliament .
&quot; the Labour leader , who has promised another policy approach , says he has given &quot; crowd @-@ sourc@@ ed &quot; ideas for questions to Mr Cameron and gave him more than 30.000 ideas . &quot;
&quot; the Is@@ lington North MP said that the prime minister &apos;s fr@@ enz@@ y is too con@@ front@@ ational , and that he has under@@ gone both &quot; &quot; per@@ sever@@ ance &quot; &quot; and the strike with barb@@ ar@@ ism and instead decided to concentrate on serious problems such as poverty , ine@@ quality and the challenges for young people . &quot;
&quot; Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said Angela Eagle , the Shadow Economic minister will be represented if he does not participate , for example when Mr Cameron is travelling abroad . &quot;
&quot; he also brought the idea into conversation that other colleagues occasionally spoke the word , and that he addressed John Ber@@ cow , the speaker of the under@@ house , to discuss the problem . &quot;
&quot; when he became leader in 2005 , Mr Cameron said that he wanted to remove himself from politics in the style of a &quot; Kas@@ per@@ le Theater , &quot; which is often associated with the prime minister &apos;s fr@@ enz@@ y . but a few years later he admitted that he failed . &quot;
&quot; since it was first sent on television in 1990 , the Fra@@ gest@@ ed with the Prime Minister was regarded as the most important bar@@ ometer of a leader and his leadership in the under@@ house and his position among his parliam@@ ent@@ arians , although critics have argu@@ ed that they have become a car@@ ic@@ ature and require widespread reforms . &quot;

pound ster@@ ling through accelerated growth in the United Kingdom
&quot; the pound has risen sharp@@ ly according to data , which indicates a rise in the growth of the United Kingdom . in parallel , the FT@@ SE 100 was increased by the target target SA@@ BM@@ iller . &quot;
&quot; between May and July , the result without bonuses in the United Kingdom increased by 2.9 % over the same period of the previous year . &quot;
&quot; since 2009 , this percentage has been the fastest and er@@ ect assessment of the time of an increase in interest . &quot;
&quot; the pound rose by more than 1 % over the dollar to $ 1,@@ 550@@ 5 and was climb@@ ed to 0.@@ 84 % over the euro to € 1,@@ 37@@ 30 . &quot;
the FT@@ SE 100 index included an increase of 1.@@ 49 % to 6.@@ 2@@ 29.@@ 21 .
&quot; SA@@ BM@@ iller was the outstanding share in the market and made a leap of 20 % , following the acquisition @-@ offer of the Ri@@ val AB In@@ Be@@ v . &quot;
&quot; a transaction would combine the two largest bre@@ wer@@ ies in the world and bring brands like Bud@@ weiser , Stella Ar@@ to@@ is , Per@@ oni and Gro@@ l@@ sch . &quot;
&quot; following encouraging news from the competition Group for luxury goods , Bur@@ berry stocks were 0.9 % higher . &quot;
&quot; Ri@@ chem@@ on@@ ts &apos;s latest sales figures hit all expectations , and showed that sales in China - a key market for Bur@@ berry - reported growth again . &quot;
&quot; shares of Gl@@ enc@@ ore rose by 5 % , after the Berg@@ bau@@ ri@@ ese said that he took $ 2.5 billion through stock sales as part of its debt reduction strategy . &quot;
&quot; the shares in the packaging and paper company Mon@@ di were the largest los@@ ers on the index , with a decrease of 4.3 % after Gold@@ man Sach@@ s had set his app@@ rais@@ al for the company rating . &quot;
&quot; JD Sports rose by 3.1 % , after the sports clothing company reported a pre @-@ tax result of 46.@@ 6 million for the first half of the year . &quot;
the head of JD Sports says that higher wages thre@@ aten the expansion .
the managing director of JD Sports Peter Cow@@ g@@ ill says that a higher minimum wage for UK workers &quot; could mean more purchasing power in the pockets of potential customers .
&quot; but it is unlikely that this purchasing power will compens@@ ate the higher labor costs in his company , he says . &quot;
&quot; the costs could meet the expansion plans of JD Sports , he added , and that could mean that there are less additional jobs . &quot;

&quot; inspired by the saying &quot; potato instead of twe@@ eter &quot; on a poster of the Peg@@ ida movement , Al@@ h@@ ay Pot@@ ato and meat have put together on a sk@@ ewer . &quot;
&quot; the idea brought him a poster in a &quot; &quot; Peg@@ ida rally &quot; &quot; with the inscription &quot; &quot; potatoes instead of twe@@ eter &quot; , &quot; which he saw acci@@ dentally on television . &quot;
&quot; since then , a barbecue sp@@ it has been turned in its store , which is equipped with meat and potatoes . &quot;
&quot; this is multic@@ ult@@ i for the stomach , &quot; says Al@@ h@@ ay . &quot;
the idea of the Leban@@ ese has meanwhile been submitted to the Patent Office in Munich .

Met@@ cash launches ground@@ work campaign to combat algae inf@@ estation
cash tries to protect the IG@@ A branch in front of an Al@@ di @-@ rise in South Australia and Western Australia .
food wholes@@ aler Met@@ cash has launched a campaign launch campaign to defend the market share of IG@@ A retailers in South Australia and Western Australia in advance of a 700 million $ Al@@ di invasion .
&quot; while Al@@ di prepar@@ es the opening of two distribution centres and the first 120 stores in South Australia and Western Australia in the beginning of next year , Met@@ cash and IG@@ A supermarkets strengthen their relationships with local food suppliers and build the IG@@ A brand through mainstream marketing and marketing via the social media , as well as events such as Adel@@ ai@@ de show . &quot;
&quot; Ig@@ A dealers and suppliers jump on board , with brands such as ice manufacturer S@@ immo from D@@ uns@@ bor@@ ough , who distri@@ butes samples in IG@@ A stores and store owners who sell approved tickets for the South Australian soccer league to loyal customers . &quot;
&quot; it is expected that Met@@ cash will publish further details of its defence strategy on September 29 , when the wholes@@ aler of food , alcohol and equipment carries out its annual investor strategy . &quot;
&quot; there is a lot in the game , as South Australia and Western Australia make up almost 30 percent of Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s IG@@ A shops and generate higher profit mar@@ gins as a Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s IG@@ A network in the Eastern states . &quot;
&quot; buyers in South Australia and Western Australia are not@@ ori@@ ally provincial and IG@@ A retailers have a much stronger market share than in New South Wales , Victoria and Que@@ ens@@ land - over 30 percent in South Australia and 24 percent in Western Australia compared to around 14 percent in eastern states . &quot;
&quot; however , analysts like Morgan Stan@@ ley believe that Al@@ di will take twelve months after opening its first markets around five percent of the food market in these two states and will take away all existing players , but chi@@ ef@@ ly independent retailers . &quot;
&quot; according to a report published this week , the analy@@ st Tom K@@ ier@@ ath of Morgan Stan@@ ley estimated that IG@@ A retailers might lose 360 million turnover per year and $ 250 million by the end of 2016 . &quot;
this forecast is based on the assumption that Al@@ di has opened 25 stores in SA and 30 in WA in the next year and will achieve a turnover of $ 500 million and $ 600 million in each market .
&quot; the loss in food and food business and the amounts on Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s of a high fixed cost base could cost $ 13 million in earnings before interest and taxes , said Mr K@@ ier@@ ath . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , Met@@ cash loses market shares in the Eastern states , mainly in Al@@ di and Col@@ es , although a recent conducted survey by Roy Morgan found that IG@@ A buyers are the most tru@@ th@@ ful . &quot;
Morgan Stan@@ ley announces that Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s will rise by 3.8 percent in 2016 to 4.1 percent in 2017 and 2.1 percent in 2018 and reduce the market share of 14 percent in 2015 to 10.@@ 3 percent by 2020 .
&quot; last week , the leading fund manager Ham@@ ish Dou@@ glass , the founder of the Mag@@ ell@@ an Financial Group , reported that Met@@ cash would likely disappear within a decade . Met@@ cash will disappear . &quot;
Met@@ cash declined to respond publicly to the comments of Mr Dou@@ glass .
but it is assumed that a committee member of Met@@ cash received contact with Mr Dou@@ glass last week .
&quot; since 2010 , i@@ Gas market share has dropped from 18 percent to 14 percent , and revenues from Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s food and food trade , which has been supplied by approximately 1,@@ 200 IG@@ A retailers , has fallen by 43 percent since 2012 , which reflects the debt reduction in sales and mar@@ gins at the same time . &quot;
&quot; however , the wholes@@ aler encourages and inv@@ ests more than $ 150 million to boost sales prices with Col@@ es and Wo@@ ol@@ wor@@ ths at hundreds of products every week and to provide IG@@ A retailers to improve their stores by fast growing fresh foods and provide a better choice of private label foods . &quot;
&quot; met@@ c@@ ash@@ s main business leader Ian Mor@@ rice says that price adjustments and charging rehabilitation programs are to be set to El@@ an , hoping that the wholes@@ aler will return to profit growth in 2017 for the first time in four years . &quot;
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is is supported by the president of Australian tennis association Steve He@@ aly
Th@@ an@@ asi co@@ kin@@ ak@@ is deserves more praise than cri@@ tique for his behaviour .
&quot; Th@@ an@@ asi co@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was one of the &quot; &quot; coll@@ ateral damage &quot; &quot; in the recent storm around his friend Nick Kyr@@ gi@@ os and deser@@ ved according to the President of the Australian tennis association Steve He@@ aly rather praise as criticism for his own behaviour . &quot;
&quot; Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is , the younger of the talented Du@@ os , which is repeatedly called &quot; Special K@@ s , &quot; gro@@ unded by the in@@ famous conflict of Kyr@@ gy@@ z@@ stan with St@@ an Wa@@ wr@@ in@@ ka at the Montreal Masters in the spotlight . &quot;
&quot; in a fier@@ y qualifying game in C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati soon afterwards Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is and his opponent Ryan Har@@ rison had to be separated by the ump@@ ire twice with Har@@ rison : &quot; Wa@@ wr@@ in@@ ka would have to beat Kyr@@ gy@@ z@@ os , and I should beat the child . &quot;
&quot; while he was finally seen how he sm@@ ashed a tennis r@@ ack@@ et , after a cr@@ amp ti@@ pped a potential US Open victory of Richard Gas@@ quet , Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was def@@ ended by He@@ aly . &quot;
&quot; the teen@@ ager is currently in Glasgow , in the competition with Sam Gr@@ oth for the second place in the zel behind Bernard Tom@@ ic in the Davis Cup semi @-@ fin@@ als against the UK . &quot;
&quot; one thing about which I am quite we@@ ary is the fact that after my view Th@@ an@@ asi was drawn into the argument , &quot; He@@ aly said . &quot;
&quot; he has broken a r@@ ack@@ et , when he lost in the US Open because of a fight , but he is not the first player who broke a r@@ ack@@ et out of fru@@ stration with himself , and I know Th@@ an@@ asi well enough to know that he is not proud of it . &quot;
&quot; but , really , he has beha@@ ved extremely well in the US Open , even among the rather pro@@ voc@@ ative circumstances with Har@@ rison and so on , and I think he deserves a lot of recognition . &quot;
&quot; he has a great team around him , he has a great family around him , and I think he was treated a little too severely . &quot;
&quot; he is a very mature 19 @-@ year @-@ old , he works very hard and he fits into the team and so on , he has never had a problem with the other players , he is well in shape , he is a very stable and mature young guy , and I think he deserves to be judged by his own mer@@ its . &quot;
&quot; He@@ aly also supported the decision to not take into account Kyr@@ gy@@ z@@ os on Friday , and he describes the &quot; common decision &quot; as the right one for everyone , but he ass@@ ures the man from Can@@ ber@@ ra to return as a long @-@ term integral part to the team . &quot;
&quot; first we wish that the team is completely focused on the competition and not on all the controversi@@ es around &#91; Kyr@@ gi@@ os &#93; , &quot; He@@ aly said . &quot;
&quot; some time outside the spotlight he gets , but we try to help him understand the consequences of his actions , and he deserves all the criticism he gets , and it is best for the team and it is best for him . &quot;
&quot; Europe &apos;s refugee crisis : Hungary declares emergency , closes the border , keeps refugees back &quot;
Hungary declared the emergency and declared the southern border with Serbia on Tuesday and held all those trying to go illeg@@ ally into the country . all with the aim of stopping the influ@@ x of migrants .
chaos followed at the border when hundreds of migrants congreg@@ ated in a Ni@@ em@@ and@@ s@@ land and re@@ acted Serbian officials with indig@@ nation .
the people who fled from violence were stuck in a land strip at the road between the two control points of the countries and built tents and settled there .
but fru@@ str@@ ations rose .
&quot; when a police helicop@@ ter ho@@ ver@@ ed over them , the migrants &quot; open the fron@@ tier ! &quot; and cry ins@@ ults against the Hungarian police force . &quot;
some reject food and water from Prot@@ est .
&quot; Serbia &apos;s Foreign Minister declared it is &quot; un@@ acceptable &quot; that migrants from Hungary would be returned , while more and more from Macedonia and Greece arrive . &quot;
( Serbia ) wants to be part of the solution and not a coll@@ ateral damage .
&quot; in the coming days , talks with Brussels and other countries must take place , &quot; said I@@ vica D@@ ac@@ ic in Prague . &quot;
the turbul@@ ence on the Hungarian @-@ Serbian border came a day after the 28 @-@ Nations blo@@ c at a meeting in Brussels no common immigration policy could be agreed .
&quot; however , the ministers agreed to share the responsibility for 4@@ 0,000 people who sought refuge in the over@@ power@@ ing Italy and Greece . &quot;
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria requested a special summit of the European Union on Tuesday to discuss the immigration crisis of the continent .
&quot; however , Hungary did not impose its hopes for a bel@@ li@@ ger@@ ent action in Brussels or its neighbours . &quot;
&quot; the emergency room rested on Tuesday in two southern regions gave authorities more powers to cope with the crisis , so that they could block roads and ha@@ sten asylum procedures . &quot;
the Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to said that his country also plans to build a barb@@ ed wire fence along its border to Romania in order to stop the influ@@ x of migrants from the country - after having completed a fence along the Serbian border .
&quot; C@@ BS News correspon@@ dent Charlie D &apos;@@ Ag@@ ata reported that even j@@ ail races were used during the race , the barb@@ ed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia . &quot;
&quot; in recent months , Hungary has become a major bott@@ len@@ eck and entry point to the European Union for many war refugees from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East . &quot;
&quot; however , Prime Minister Viktor Or@@ ban insist@@ ed that most of the coming economic refugees are looking for a better life , and not war refugees who have the right to protection - a view that strongly contra@@ sts with other EU states , including Germany . &quot;
&quot; the new laws , which came into force at midnight in Hungary , make the crossing of the border or the damage of the 4 @-@ meter ( 13 ft ) high fence that the government built along the southern border to Serbia , to a crime . these laws also specify higher liability for convic@@ ted traff@@ ick@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; due to the situation created by the mass migration , the Hungarian government explains the state of emergency , &quot; said spokes@@ person Z@@ ol@@ tan K@@ ov@@ acs repor@@ ters in the southern town of Sz@@ eg@@ ed . &quot;
we say it very clearly : illegal border crossing is a crime .
&quot; the Parliament must still agree on the use of the military , expected for next week , but repor@@ ters from Associ@@ ated Press have already seen heavily armed soldiers with vehicles and dogs on Friday . &quot;
&quot; Gy@@ org@@ y Bak@@ on@@ di , country security advisor for Or@@ ban , said that authorities had 45 people trying to cross the border , 15 others were already deeper into the country . &quot;
&quot; they come over by dam@@ aging the fence , they are now in police custo@@ dy and are accused of criminal off@@ ences following the new laws . &quot;
authorities are ready to repair the fence quickly .
&quot; on Tuesday morning Hungarian officials also included two of the seven border cross@@ ings with Serbia , after a train carriage with barb@@ ed wire to close the limits . &quot;
&quot; chaos surrounded the most important border crossing near Ros@@ z@@ ke , Hungary , when the Hung@@ arians opened a small office in a metal container to process the data of people and pushing a crowd to meet there . &quot;
&quot; some 20 succeeded in entering , but thousands remained outside . &quot;
another group of migrants blocked the main motorway link between Serbia and Hungary and said that they would refuse food and water until they come to Hungary .
election @-@ 2016 : Hill@@ ary Clinton &apos;s can@@ opy in front of Ber@@ nie S@@ anders in national survey hal@@ ved
&quot; former US Secretary of State Hill@@ ary Clinton also holds a double @-@ digit jump in the democratic race for nom@@ ination at national level , but Sen@@ ator Ber@@ nie S@@ anders wins her against the ground . &quot;
&quot; Clinton has now supported 47 percent of democratic vot@@ ers in the pre @-@ elections ( 58 % before ) , while S@@ anders are second , with 27 percent ( increase by 17 percent ) . &quot;
&quot; Vice President Joe Bi@@ den , who has not announced yet whether he will be candidates for the Pres@@ idential Office , will receive support of 15 percent of the democratic vot@@ ers of the pres@@ election . &quot;
&quot; more than five months before the start of the elections , most democratic vot@@ ers say it is too early to say that their opinion is determined which candidates will support them . &quot;
but Clinton &apos;s supporters are more consistent in their election than those of the other candidates .
&quot; since the C@@ BS News survey Clinton has lost in a number of demographic groups , while S@@ anders gained some profits . &quot;
&quot; Clinton has a huge margin in women and moder@@ ates , but these proj@@ ections dimin@@ ished . &quot;
&quot; their support in the men has decreased considerably , and S@@ anders is only with 5 points . &quot;
&quot; Clinton &apos;s advantage with democratic vot@@ ers less than 50 years has van@@ ished , and they and S@@ anders are now at the same level . &quot;
&quot; Clinton , however , has a big advantage with the older vot@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; last month , Clinton was faced with a double @-@ digit jump in the liber@@ als , but S@@ anders has now a 5 @-@ point lead in this group . &quot;
about half of the democratic vot@@ ers in the country &apos;s elections say they would be backed by Clinton if they were nominated by the party .
&quot; a quarter would support them with some reservations and another 15 percent would only support them , because it is the candidate . &quot;
six percent would not support them .
maybe not surprisingly that Clin@@ tons &apos;s current supporters are excited about her .
the views are more mixed with those who currently don &apos;t support Clinton - only a quarter would support them enthusias@@ tically .
&quot; while 48 percent of democratic vot@@ ers say that they support Clinton with enthusiasm , fewer Republi@@ can vot@@ ers say this about their nick@@ name Donald Tru@@ mp ( 35 percent ) . &quot;
&quot; if Clinton &apos;s supporters are asked in an open question why they want it to be the candidate , the most common answer is that she has the right experience ( 16 percent ) , followed by the opinion that it is time that a woman is president ( 13 percent ) and that she is the best candidate for the job ( 10 percent ) . &quot;
Clinton &apos;s supporters also mentioned their connection with Bill Clinton ( 9 percent ) .
agreement to deal with the problems and the eligi@@ bility are cited as well .
&quot; as the vice president raises a potential for the pres@@ idency in the balance , 57 percent of the democratic vot@@ ers of the pres@@ election want him to see him in the race - although a third thinks he should not do it . &quot;
&quot; if democratic vot@@ ers will be asked for the election , who would be their second choice for the party , Bi@@ den is at the helm . &quot;
&quot; by Clinton &apos;s supporters say more than half , that Bi@@ den would be their second choice far from S@@ anders . &quot;
&quot; if bi@@ kers decide not to candidates for the nom@@ ination of the Democrats , Hill@@ ary Clinton &apos;s advance of S@@ anders will increase from 20 points with bi@@ ds in race on 30 points without him in the race . &quot;
&quot; fifty @-@ five percent of democratic vot@@ ers see Clinton as candidate with the best chances of winning the election , but this figure has dropped by 78 percent last month . &quot;
&quot; Bi@@ den is by far a second in this measurement , but the percentage that sees it as the &quot; &quot; sel@@ ectable &quot; &quot; has increased . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , on the question of what is more important with a candidate , Democratic vot@@ ers call on vot@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; similarly , as in the last month , no single democratic candidate or potential candidate for this vot@@ ers suff@@ ers as un@@ acceptable . &quot;
the Democratic candidates or potential candidates provide good results with some important features of vot@@ ers in the pres@@ election of their party .
&quot; maj@@ orities view Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den as honest and trust@@ worthy and equipped with strong leadership qualities . &quot;
&quot; among the three candidates , bees are best cutting off in hon@@ esty , while Clin@@ tons &apos;s strength is the lead . &quot;
&quot; thirty percent of democratic vot@@ ers do not believe that Clinton is honest and trust@@ worthy , twice as many say it &apos;s about S@@ anders ( 15 percent ) , but 27 percent have no opinion about it . &quot;
&quot; democratic vot@@ ers in general elections also see Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den ideological in accordance with their views . &quot;
&quot; for all these measurements , about a quarter of democratic vot@@ ers have no opinion of S@@ anders . &quot;
&quot; as questions about Hill@@ ary Clinton &apos;s use of a personal e @-@ mail address and a server during the term as foreign minister , most Democratic vot@@ ers are satisfied with their explanation of the matter and say that it has not influenced their opinion in total . &quot;
but it is a different story in the American public total .
&quot; half of the Americans are now dis@@ satisfied with their explanation , while only about one third is satisfied . &quot;
&quot; public opinion was split in March , shortly after the problem came to light . &quot;
&quot; most Americans said that the e @-@ mail contro@@ vers@@ y had no effect on the Clinton &apos;s general opinion , although 36 percent said that their opinion has still deteri@@ or@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; they are mainly re@@ public@@ ans , more than six of 10 who say their views from Clinton have become worse . &quot;
&quot; although Clinton is considered to be honest and trust@@ worthy by the vot@@ ers of their party , this is still a problem for them among registered vot@@ ers : only 32 percent see them as honest and trust@@ worthy , eight percent less than last month and 15 points less since May . &quot;
62 percent of those entitled to vote do not hold them for an honest and trust@@ worthy person .
&quot; at the same time , 55 percent of the eligible vot@@ ers regard Tru@@ mp as non @-@ hon@@ estly and not trust@@ worthy . &quot;
&quot; Clinton and Tru@@ mp , however , receive good marks for guidance . &quot;
&quot; from the six candidates tested , Bi@@ den , Car@@ son and Bush would best cut off hon@@ esty . &quot;
&quot; a majority regards S@@ anders rather than hon@@ estly , but as with Car@@ son , many don &apos;t think of him . &quot;
the failure rate for the sample of 351 Democratic vot@@ ers in the primary elections is 6 percentage points .
Ben Car@@ son moves to Donald Tru@@ mp near nation@@ wide survey
Ben Car@@ son is close to Donald Tru@@ mp &apos;s newest survey on C@@ BS News / New York Times
&quot; on the two candidates , half of the support of vot@@ ers in the new survey , and others are losing dramatically . &quot;
the support is growing by 23 % in the last C@@ BS survey conducted before Fox News Deb@@ ate last month to 27 % in the survey on Tuesday .
but Car@@ son dropped from 6 % to 23 % in the same period .
the survey also revealed that Car@@ son received well in demographic groups and sur@@ rendered Tru@@ mp under republi@@ can vot@@ ers with higher education .
&quot; the rest of the field , with the exception of Car@@ ly Fi@@ or@@ ina and Ohio @-@ Gover@@ nor John Ka@@ aba , is defeated with Wis@@ cons@@ ins Gover@@ nor Scott Walker , who died at the deepest , and 10 % support last month to now 2 % . &quot;
&quot; the former governor J@@ eb Bush , former governor of Ar@@ kan@@ s@@ as Mike Hu@@ ck@@ ab@@ ee and Florida Sen@@ ator Marco Ru@@ bio , are at 6 % in third place . &quot;
the error margin in the sample of 376 persons of Republi@@ can vot@@ ers in this latest survey is Plus or minus 6 % and was conducted in September .
&quot; the latest CN@@ N / OR@@ C survey , published last week , shows that Car@@ son rises in the surveys - he lands with 19 % support among the Republi@@ cans , behind the Tru@@ mp with 32 % support . &quot;
the latest survey of ABC News / Washington Post showed also Tru@@ mp clearly in front of Car@@ son .
&quot; looking at a Car@@ son rising last week , Tru@@ mp found some si@@ des@@ hi@@ ves for the former neuro@@ sur@@ geon , even after Car@@ son ap@@ ologi@@ zed to question Tru@@ mps &apos;s faith . &quot;
&quot; we need energy , &quot; &quot; said Tru@@ mp last Saturday during a campaign in I@@ owa . &quot;
pleasant bath temperatures : the eastern Mediterranean is at the moment warm up to 29 degrees .
&quot; even if peak values are measured only in distance , a trip to the Mediterranean is enough for bathing lovers to find even warm water . &quot;
a bath in the North or Baltic Sea is likely to be a rather short pleasure at a maximum of 17 degrees .
&quot; some people no longer go into the sea : a maximum of 18 degrees has the water in the North and Baltic Sea this week , shares the German Weather Service ( D@@ WD ) . &quot;
&quot; in contrast , bathing temperatures continues to offer the Mediterranean : in the East it is even up to 29 degrees . &quot;
&quot; in the Adriatic it is 25 degrees , in France 23 degrees . &quot;
the Red Sea in Egypt is 28 degrees .
five members of the Brotherhood charged with the death of Bar@@ uch College @-@ Ne@@ ul@@ ings
&quot; almost two years after a student died during a schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ic ritual of a student connection in Po@@ con@@ o Mountains , Pennsylvania , murder trials were submitted against five people . &quot;
members of the New York Bar@@ uch College P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ P@@ si Brotherhood attacked Ch@@ un &quot; Michael &quot; Den@@ g during an introduc@@ tory ritual in September 2013 and delayed his transportation to hospital .
&quot; officials said he had been loaded with connected eyes with a 30 pound back@@ pack full of sand , and repeatedly attacked while trying to move over a frozen field to a target . &quot;
&quot; Mr. Den@@ g finally compl@@ ained about head@@ aches , then he fell un@@ conscious . &quot;
&quot; the members of the P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ P@@ si Brotherhood did not call the emergency number 911 , after Den@@ g was power@@ less and suppos@@ edly waited one hour before they brought him to a hospital , so the police . &quot;
&quot; however , they had the time to switch to D@@ eng@@ o &apos;s clothing , to goo@@ gle his symptoms and contact Andy Men@@ g , the National President of the Brotherhood to get advice , said Polic@@ eman Chris Wagner at a press conference . &quot;
&quot; at this point , the members of the utensils began to hide and ordered the welfare of the Brotherhood in principle over that of Michael Den@@ g , &quot; said Polic@@ eman Wagner . &quot;
&quot; he could not be revi@@ ved , and he died the next morning at his wounds . &quot;
&quot; after an aut@@ op@@ sy report , Den@@ g was added repeatedly with bl@@ unt force injuries to head , tor@@ so and th@@ igh@@ s . &quot;
&quot; many families were destroyed by the Sh@@ ik@@ ans of the Brotherhood . at least one student dies at the chic@@ ane since 1970 , &quot; said Douglas F@@ ier@@ berg , a lawyer , who represents D@@ eng@@ o &apos;s family , in an explanation . &quot;
&quot; br@@ other@@ hoods and their members must be held ac@@ coun@@ table , and this step by authorities is very important . &quot;
a County Grand Jury of Mon@@ roe recommends an indictment for the third count of the first five members .
&quot; thirty @-@ two members of the Brotherhood , including Mr Men@@ g , are also charged with suspic@@ ious attacks and formation of a criminal association . &quot;
&quot; we do not only want to blame the persons involved , but if there is an organization that has sanc@@ tioned - officially or in@@ officially - this will also be held ac@@ coun@@ table , &quot; &quot; said Wagner at a press conference on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; Bar@@ uch College has banned the Brotherhood , and the national fr@@ at@@ ernity has rev@@ oked its affili@@ ation to the local group . &quot;
this will happen if the F@@ ed increases interest rates

this is what we know .
what we don &apos;t know is how long it will last and how long it will stop .
&quot; in particular , the history of the economy offers little guidance to the process . &quot;
a recession came within only 11 months after the first rate of interest rate and lasted 86 months .
&quot; the Federal Reserve &apos;s aggres@@ si@@ veness at raising interest rates is often , although not always , a factor in how the economy and financial investments are responding . &quot;
&quot; therefore representatives of the U.S. Central Bank have stressed so heavily that investors should not concentrate on when it starts to increase interest rates , but rather to the period required for norm@@ alisation . &quot;
&quot; in fact , several variables play a role . &quot;
&quot; at the end , however , market participants might find that the whole excitement might be exagger@@ ated because of a interest increase . &quot;
&quot; the first increase in the F@@ ed since the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some as a signal for the end of the &quot; cheap money &quot; era , &quot; said Julian Jes@@ so@@ p , chief econom@@ ist at Capital Economics , in a communication to customers . &quot;
&quot; in contrast , we do not expect the gradual return of US interest to normal heights , but still at a low level to lead to sei@@ s@@ mic shock , which many seem to fear . &quot;
&quot; however , this does not mean that there will be no effect . &quot;
here is a look at historic trends based on how some areas of the economy could react :
&quot; as the market has seen last month , the anticip@@ ation of interest increases may make things volati@@ le for a while . &quot;
&quot; once the up@@ li@@ ft@@ ment arrives , the influence is not so dramatic . &quot;
&quot; there seems to be a tendency that assets profit from 12 to 24 months after the initial increase , which perhaps reflects the delay in monetary policy , &quot; said Deutsche Bank analysts in a recent study on what happens after interest increases in the F@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; in more detail , the market has mostly been in the upward trend in the past 35 years - about 14 percent - on the way to interest rate , then back to normal condition after 500 days , with an average margin of 14.@@ 4 percent according to a recent analysis , which Bob Doll , chief asset strategy at Nu@@ ve@@ en Asset Management , published at Bar@@ ron &apos;s . &quot;
Deutsche Bank said that the impact on the shares tends to occur later in the raising cycle and the return begins to decrease .
&quot; rec@@ essions are a fact of economic life , but interest increases often promote it . &quot;
&quot; in the current case , the F@@ ed is confronted with some conditions that had not existed before and which could accelerate a recession . &quot;
&quot; remark@@ ably , the gross domestic product will be near its lowest score at a interest rate of the F@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; according to Deutsche Bank , 118 interest increases since 1950 only twice the nominal GDP fell below 4.5 percent . &quot;
&quot; although the second quarter of 2015 was 3.6 percent , only a few expect this to continue and expect only 1.5 percent for the third quarter according to the Atlanta F@@ ed . &quot;

&quot; market participants have made a interest rate of F@@ ed all year round , and all eyes focused on the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee that ended on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; while many strateg@@ ists and econom@@ ists believe that the FO@@ MC could appro@@ ve an increase in this meeting , fut@@ ures trade only represents a 25 percent probability . &quot;
&quot; in our study , all the raising cycles from 1950 up to today have taken place in a super cycle with increasing sw@@ ung by GDP and pre @-@ recovery times very quickly after the beginning of recovery in the shadows , &quot; says the report . &quot;
&quot; in contrast , this is a clearly slow recovery from what was the worst recession in the observed phase . &quot;
the current cycle is by far the longest which the F@@ ed has been waiting since the end of the last recession ; the record was 35 months and so far 74 months .
&quot; firm income was also volati@@ le , as the market anticip@@ ates a rate of interest , and the pattern is quite similar to the capital market . &quot;
the main difference is that bonds are faster than in shares when they change their strategic course .
&quot; bonds seem to change direction , as soon as the first increase / decrease in the cycle occurs . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the raising cycle , the loans drop immediately , the Deutsche Bank said . &quot;
the strateg@@ ists of Charles Schw@@ ab believe that the rise in interest rates will lead to closer ties between longer and shorter bor@@ row@@ ings and lead to a fl@@ atten@@ ing of the curve .
&quot; high @-@ interest bonds often bring better income in such a climate , although &quot; we are still careful to expect higher yields , &quot; said Kath@@ y Jones , Fix@@ ed @-@ In@@ come @-@ Analy@@ stin at Schw@@ ab , in an analysis . &quot;
Jones means that the markets have already adapted to F@@ ed strategy expectations .
&quot; in addition to the strength of the dollar and the decline of inflation expectations , there are some indications that the market adapted to the prospect of stric@@ ter monetary policy . &quot; &quot;
&quot; short term interest has risen , the yield curve is fl@@ atter , l@@ ending has expanded and volati@@ lity has increased - all the features of the market if the F@@ ed intensi@@ fies its strategy . &quot;
&quot; in the large and whole , companies that handle the greater part of their business activity in the United States will benefit when interest rates rise and local products become more attractive . &quot;
multinational companies with high debts are getting worse since an increasing dollar makes their products more expensive on the global market and the financing of their debt .
&quot; the story shows that &quot; &quot; quality &quot; &quot; shares tend to react extremely positive three months after an initial interest increase , &quot; &quot; Gold@@ man Sach@@ s analysts said in a report for the customers . &quot;
&quot; companies with a strong balance sheet have exceeded 5 percentage points in 1994 , 1999 and 2004 by an average of 5 percentage points . &quot;
companies with high capital rep@@ ay@@ ments and low volati@@ lity with their shares also exceeded their counter@@ parts with low quality by an average of 4 ( percentage points ) and 3 ( percentage points ) .
debt will become a big problem .
&quot; companies with a high share of flexible interest rates will lose the most , said Gold@@ man . &quot;
&quot; outside the pure equity , consumers will also benefit from the growing Dollar . &quot;
&quot; savings can see gains from higher yields , even if experts in different opinion are how fast that will take place . &quot;
&quot; BBC Radio 3 is a copy of the Classic FM , says MEP Andrew B@@ ingham &quot;
the Con@@ servative member of parliament cri@@ tici@@ zed the sender because of his &quot; suspic@@ ion &quot;
he ar@@ gues that he is not to be distinguished from commercial ri@@ vals .
he also zi@@ pped to the BBC Music Awards and said they just im@@ it@@ ated The Br@@ its
&quot; Parliament @-@ colleague Dam@@ ien Coll@@ ins picked up The Voice , and said that this was not very original . &quot;
&quot; BBC Radio 3 &quot; converts &quot; to Classic FM , asser@@ ts a leading parliamentary committee and raises new pressure on the station to prove that he does something that the private broad@@ c@@ ers do not . &quot;
the Con@@ servative MP Andrew B@@ ingham also told the BBC @-@ bos@@ ses that the public @-@ law radi@@ os@@ ender &quot; dum@@ my &quot; and increasingly no longer distingu@@ ish@@ able from its commercial ri@@ vals .
&quot; radio 3 seems - I don &apos;t like to use the word &quot; &quot; sil@@ ly &quot; &quot; - but it seems to turn to Classic FM , &quot; he said . &quot;
he also zi@@ pped to the BBC Music Awards which started last December .
&quot; the BBC Music Awards , launched last year , seem to be just under a different name . &quot;
&quot; so , if you try to do something different - these are two spontaneous examples where you actually only im@@ itate what is already on the market , &quot; said Mr B@@ ingham . &quot;
BBC Director General rejected the alleg@@ ations and argu@@ ed that BBC Radio 3 is far ahead of its commercial ri@@ vals when it comes to live music and educ@@ ating the public .
&quot; what I learn from Radio 3 , I will never learn about classical music anywhere else . &quot;
and there is a commitment to live music and playing music that is really uns@@ ur@@ passed .
&quot; and the commitment of Radio 3 , finding new music and giving up new works , I think is really important , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of this year , BBC Radio 3 Controller Alan Dav@@ ey argu@@ ed that it needed to work harder to engage audiences as it did in the past because the British were less informed about classical music . &quot;
&quot; however , Radio 3 was not the only element in the BBC production , which during the hearing in the committee on the choice of culture , media and sport was forced under fire to kick off commercial ri@@ vals . &quot;
the T@@ ory MP Dam@@ ien Coll@@ ins grab@@ bed The Voice - the BBC musical talent show purchased by the Dutch producer T@@ alp@@ a Media for an estimated cost of 22 million £ .
do you see why this program is often discussed because it is not original and not particularly striking ?
Lord Hall insist@@ ed that the BBC 1 show - with Pal@@ oma Faith and Boy George as Richter - was &quot; produced in a special BBC @-@ manner . &quot;
&quot; he added that the company &quot; &quot; find a hit from our in @-@ house stable &quot; &quot; when the next time there was a series of entertainment . &quot;
&quot; however , he refused to exclude the order from other rows of The Voice in the future or to give money to the fee pay@@ ers for other entertainment formats . &quot;
Internet sales rose in August at the slow@@ est and the Black Friday can be responsible for this
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; last month , there was the lowest result since the beginning of the records in 2000 . &quot;
online sales improved three years ago by using mobile phones to purchase
experts believe that Black Friday has slow@@ ed down expenses in November
&quot; for more than a decade , the virtual shopping has blo@@ oming and many of Britain &apos;s main shopping streets have turned into ghost towns . &quot;
&quot; however , experts say that there are now signs that online sales stagn@@ ate after new figures show only seven percent in the first three months of 2015 . &quot;
total expenditure for August presented the lowest rise in growth since the beginning of the records in 2000 with only five percent increase compared to the previous year .
experts say that there are signs that online sales stagn@@ ate after new figures show only seven percent growth in the first three months of 2015
&quot; if you look at the growth rates for the previous years and go back to 2000 , then that has always been developed over time , &quot; said Andy Mul@@ c@@ ah@@ y , publisher of the IM@@ RG sales index to the Guardian . &quot;
&quot; he explained that online sales increased three years ago , when buyers started to make purchases with their mobile phones . &quot;
&quot; it meant that more people could buy online and that people could do it in different environments , e.g. at home on the sofa . &quot;
&quot; but now that is , and we may experience that growth is reduced . &quot;
the Black Friday phenomenon imported from America is cited as a reason for the subsequent sales .
&quot; experts believe that buyers will hold their purchases before this event , which takes place last Friday in November . &quot;
&quot; last year , five times the average number of buyers around their computers turned around their computers to make their bar@@ gains , and some dealer websites crashed . &quot;
&quot; experts believe that Black Friday , where the shop@@ pers fought for bar@@ gains , could prevent buyers from making purchases . &quot;
a study by the British Retail Con@@ sortium found out that £ 5 £ output was issued a little more than £ 1 online .
&quot; with some products such as tel@@ ev@@ isions and washing machines , more than one third of the purchases are now carried out via web shops . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , more than one quarter of people bu@@ ys clothes and shoes online rather than in the fashion chains in the inner cities . &quot;
Muslims bury the dead in Mec@@ ca at the crane accident - Bin Laden &apos;s family is sanc@@ tioned
the dead bodies of 29 deaths are carried by Muslims at the first funer@@ als in Mec@@ ca by the streets
Saudi Arabia cre@@ eps down the collapse of some of the huge Saudi Bin Laden Group to load
the Ministry of Health said that a total of 394 people were injured after the crane crashed
hundreds of Muslims gathered themselves when 29 of the victims were carried through the streets to bury the slain that were killed when a crane fell to Mec@@ ca &apos;s grand@@ mo@@ sch@@ ee .
&quot; mour@@ n@@ ful crowded , largely dressed in white , the track to p@@ ollen its respect , when the first of the dead took their last trip to the Al @-@ Mo@@ ais@@ s@@ em cemetery . &quot;
the funer@@ al proc@@ ession passed to the Holy Place where only days before a building crane rus@@ hed through the ceiling of the mos@@ que and then onto the praying .
&quot; the cor@@ p@@ ses were released for bur@@ ial when the Saudi King over the construction company of the Bin Laden was killed because of the catastrophe , which also left 394 injured , a sanc@@ tion . &quot;
&quot; the cor@@ p@@ ses of 29 owners killed , when a crane rus@@ hed through the Great Central Committee of Mec@@ ca , were carried through the streets . &quot;
&quot; among the dead , Q@@ asi@@ m Ak@@ ram came from Bol@@ ton , Greater Manchester , father of four children who was on his first pilgrimage as the crane over@@ threw . &quot;
Mr Ak@@ ram was with his parents before the beginning of the annual H@@ add@@ sch in the Great Mos@@ que .
&quot; Saudi officials have already stated that the pad@@ dle to Mec@@ ca with thousands , who will continue to come to the city . &quot;
&quot; today King Sal@@ man , the Bin Laden Group would not have stopped the arm of the crane when he was not used . &quot;
&quot; an Arabic version of the decree , published by the state of Saudi Press Agency , said that the Bin Laden Group is responsible for the collapse . &quot;
&quot; the news agency &apos;s English @-@ language service did not report this detail , but said that the leadership of the company abroad is prohibited . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of this week Sal@@ man began to reveal what caused the fall of the crane , which crashed into a courtyard of the Great Lake , where hundreds of thousands of Muslims in front of the H@@ add@@ sch , which later took place this month , were gathered . &quot;
&quot; the Bin Laden Group has issued no statements about the collapse of the crane , and its representatives were not at the disposal for a statement . &quot;
the Royal Dec@@ ree also attracted the group because of not current security measures and because they did not cooperate with meteor@@ ologists .
dozens of cranes enc@@ ir@@ cle Mec@@ ca &apos;s grand@@ mo@@ cha as part of the massive building project managed by the Bin Laden Group .
the Bin Laden &apos;s family has been connected with the ruling family of Saudi Arabia for decades and takes over larger construction projects .
&quot; the dec@@ eased leader of Al Q@@ aida , Os@@ ama bin Laden , was a rebel@@ li@@ ous son , who was dischar@@ ged from the family in 1990 &apos;s . &quot;
&quot; the cr@@ ashing of the crane came amid strong winds and rain , just a few days before the arrival of millions in the kingdom for the pilgrimage , which is necessary at least once in the life of every healthy Muslims . &quot;

B &amp; Q Boss says that the time of cheap Eastern European crafts@@ men is over
&quot; British increasingly occupy crafts@@ men , says Ver@@ oni@@ que Lau@@ ry &quot;
the number of qualified crafts@@ men from Eastern Europe has under@@ gone a rise
&quot; this means that 200 further Scre@@ w@@ fix stores , which are targeted at crafts@@ men , will be opened &quot;
&quot; at the same time , King@@ f@@ isher will close 60 B &amp; Q outlets throughout the country &quot;
&quot; Ru@@ pert St@@ einer , City Chef @-@ correspon@@ dent of the Daily Mail &quot;
&quot; it is said that Brit@@ ons put down their h@@ amm@@ ers and brushes in favour of the use of qualified European crafts@@ men who carry out work in their homes , &quot;
&quot; if you are sk@@ ill@@ fully able to deal with a hammer or a brush to paint walls , you seem to become a minority today . &quot;
&quot; the British increasingly occupy crafts@@ men to carry out DIY jobs in their homes , such as the head of the company behind B &amp; Q . &quot;
&quot; V@@ é@@ ron@@ ique Lau@@ ry , new CEO of King@@ f@@ isher , who owns the Baum@@ gart@@ ner chain , said that a large increase in the number of qualified crafts@@ men from Eastern Europe , offering services to low prices , is obsol@@ ete . &quot;
&quot; therefore , King@@ f@@ isher plans to open 200 other scre@@ w@@ fix shops , which set itself on professional tra@@ des@@ people and close 60 sales outlets from B &amp; Q . &quot;
Mrs Lau@@ ry said she wants to employ more women in B &amp; Q shops as eight out of ten purchase decisions in the shop are met by women .
at the moment the men out@@ weigh the men .
&quot; she said it was necessary to face growing demographic trends , which have more female single households , which make more renov@@ ations than in the past . &quot;
Mrs Lau@@ ry said : &quot; there is still a majority of men in our branches .
we have to shift this more strongly towards a balance .
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
women play a major role in the decision making process .
&quot; Mrs Lau@@ ry , who is one of only five women at the top of a British in the FT@@ SE@@ 100 Index , has also re@@ structured her top team to reflect the same number of men and women in leadership positions . &quot;
&quot; King@@ f@@ isher is almost the only company that occup@@ ying exactly 50 percent of the teams with women , including its management and financial officer . &quot;
Mrs Lau@@ ry said : &quot; this was a conscious decision - variety is an important issue here .
it was not difficult to find good women for our Supervisory Board .
King@@ f@@ isher reported a decline in half @-@ year profit and sales after the Group was charged the cost of closing the shops .
&quot; due to the trend , King@@ f@@ isher , the Scre@@ w@@ fix and B &amp; Q will open up to 200 new stores . &quot;
officials of A@@ ich / D@@ ob due to in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity in court
at the provincial court Kl@@ agen@@ furt on Wednesday two officials of the Austrian Vol@@ leyball @-@ Vi@@ zem@@ eist@@ er A@@ ich / D@@ ob have to answer for in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity and disp@@ osi@@ tions .
the def@@ end@@ ants were not guilty .
one of them was also charged with abuse .
he was acqu@@ itted of this accus@@ ation in May .
the current process was postpon@@ ed .
&quot; according to the At@@ tor@@ ney General Robert Ri@@ ffel , the accused had found out that the def@@ end@@ ants were in the years 2006 to 2011 , of association accounts of which they were allowed to operate in their functions , used for private purposes . &quot;
&quot; the damage is estimated at around 400@@ ,000 euros . &quot;
sports officials are also charged with financial tre@@ aties .
&quot; this fact was the chairman of the Sch@@ öff@@ en@@ sen@@ ate , judge Micha@@ ela San@@ in . &quot;
it shall be negoti@@ ated at a later date .
&quot; to repro@@ ach the in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity , the defence presented that the association was at no time a part of an asset . &quot;
&quot; the sports officials were only charged expenses and the Sport@@ club , for whom they had worked from 1982 to 2011 , and in which they invested a lot of time and money - the Pas@@ si@@ va amounted to approximately 600@@ ,000 sch@@ illing in 2001 ( approx . 44@@ .000 Euro ) . &quot;
&quot; at that time we stood in front of the situation : do we continue our club or block ourselves ? &quot; &quot; one of the def@@ end@@ ants told one of the accused , in the profession of major audi@@ tors of the financial officer . &quot;
he then decided to take this task with his colleague and co @-@ accused .
with all risks .
&quot; we have pushed money , laid down our life insurance as security in the bank , &quot; &quot; he said during the arrest . &quot;
&quot; the association has been agreed : you can manage the money freely , it is not allowed to be made any debts . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , in case of financial success , the payment of the expenses was decided retro@@ actively until 1991 . &quot;
&quot; therefore , one part of the compensation claims only years later , namely from 2003 , when a plus was on the account has been paid off . &quot;
&quot; therefore , l@@ ump and not detailed accounts also seemed to be explained , the former Obama failed to explain the events . &quot;
&quot; the accounts and savings accounts managed the two def@@ end@@ ants together , said the second def@@ end@@ ant . &quot;
&quot; why the pay@@ outs were not disclosed in detail , the judge asked . &quot;
&quot; the association did not interest itself in detail for financial investment , but it is important only the freedom of debt , so the answer . &quot;
&quot; as in 2011 against the one official investigation due to office abuse , an amount of 120@@ .000 Euro was transferred to the Verein@@ s@@ konto . &quot;
&quot; that were set@@ backs , the def@@ end@@ ants explained . &quot;
&quot; this securities account ran on the name of the second def@@ end@@ ant , and according to its statement it was not known to the association . &quot;
&quot; why ? , &quot; the judge wanted to know . &quot;
the respon@@ dent did not give an answer for a long time .
&quot; then he said , he thought that this was the best for the club . &quot;
&quot; if something happened to him , no one would have known anything about this money , the prosec@@ utor turned into the room . &quot;
&quot; the co @-@ def@@ end@@ ant was informed , the official justi@@ fies himself . &quot;
this transfer was formulated as &quot; compensation in@@ dem@@ nity . &quot;
&quot; why damage compensation ? , judge and prosec@@ utor wanted to know . &quot;
&quot; the first def@@ end@@ ant declared that he did not agree with this formulation , because the association had never been damaged . &quot;
&quot; but what shall I do if the lawyer says , &quot; &quot; With him you are all from the tailor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; am I a legal representative ? &quot; &quot; he asked . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , the function@@ ary said he never referred to a cent sal@@ ary , he only calcul@@ ates mil@@ eage and di@@ ets . &quot;
&quot; at Di@@ versity he charged EUR 1,000 per month , but the real effort was much higher , he added . &quot;
the def@@ end@@ ants were not able to submit accurate documents for the early years .
&quot; they were no longer kept after an audit , in which everything had been judged correct , they explained . &quot;
mil@@ eage was also related to the second def@@ end@@ ant .
&quot; all dwell@@ ings are in cash , and he said in his statement from his residence of international law to the Bank to Blei@@ burg , &quot; he explained in his statement . &quot;
the main hearing will continue on 23 September with the survey of witnesses .
H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard announces further 30.000 jobs
&quot; in addition to the number of personnel mining that has been running for three years , the computer giant will reduce further jobs when spl@@ itting the company . &quot;
the positions at the U.S. computer giant H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard ( HP ) do not end .
&quot; as part of its restructuring , the US technology group is planning the reduction of 25,000 to 30,000 jobs in its corporate customer segment . &quot;
&quot; as a result , costs of EUR 2.7 billion ( 2.4 billion euros ) should be saved , the company announced on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; the step will lead to a special load of around $ 2.7 billion , which will be dropped from the fourth quarter . &quot;
&quot; the workforce of 55@@ ,000 jobs has not yet been completed for the past three years . &quot;
&quot; HP employed around 30@@ 2,000 employees at the end of fiscal 2013 / 14 . &quot;
the H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard @-@ Share was at EUR 2.3 per cent .
&quot; the group of printers from the Califor@@ nian Pal@@ o Alto now spl@@ its up : this way , the computer and printer shop is to be bund@@ led in a new society - separated from the promising areas with computer servers and data storage for companies as well as other services . &quot;
both business parts should be listed on the stock exchange .
&quot; once again dis@@ ap@@ pointing PC he@@ el , as well as a weaker demand for corporate customers after its services , the world &apos;s second largest PC manufacturer was last to the world &apos;s second largest PC manufacturer . &quot;
&quot; in the third quarter of the financial year at the end of July , sales of PC and printers declined by 11.@@ 5 percent . &quot;
sales fell by 8 percent to just under 25.@@ 4 billion dollars .
&quot; thus , revenues declined in 15 out of 16 quarters . &quot;
HP is responding to a split and massive sub@@ missions to change in the industry .
&quot; the 76 @-@ year @-@ old company under the leadership of Me@@ g Whit@@ man recently re@@ acted to the fact that customers are increasingly purchasing smartphones and tablets instead of conventional computers , and getting more and more business online . &quot;
&quot; all in all , Whit@@ man &apos;s restructuring plans have a total of around 5@@ 5,000 positions . &quot;
conflict : majority supports the anti @-@ IS training mission
&quot; however , a direct participation of German soldiers in combat operations in Iraq would be largely rejected : 54 percent talked about against it , 35 percent were agreed . &quot;
&quot; while other states fly air strikes against the IS in Iraq and Syria , 61 percent are positive . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , 24 per cent are to interv@@ ene in the conflict . &quot;
&quot; in cooperation with the Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad , 51 percent of respon@@ dents declined , 20 percent would be . &quot;
&quot; sorry , there is no translation for this news @-@ article . &quot;
car : second day of arrival at the 66@@ th I@@ AA
&quot; as of September 27 , networked , self @-@ prop@@ elled cars and electro@@ mobility are at the centre of the fair . &quot;
&quot; after two press days , German Chancellor Angela Merkel will officially open the 66@@ th International Motor Show under the motto &quot; &quot; Connec@@ ting Mobility &quot; &quot; on Thursday . &quot;
the general public can visit the I@@ AA from Saturday .
&quot; like two years ago , the organizers of the V@@ DA car association expect approximately 900 000 visitors . &quot;
R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke : violent erup@@ tion at Serbian @-@ Hungarian border
the Hungarian police have deployed on the Serbian border with R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as and wat@@ chers against several hundred refugees .
Eur@@ on@@ ews correspon@@ dent D@@ á@@ ni@@ el Bo@@ z@@ si@@ k has witnessed the violent erup@@ tion at the border control point .
he reported by phone :
a group of refugees broke through the border .
behind the police there was a police line and a water@@ jet stood behind the polic@@ emen .
&quot; 40 to 50 refugees began with stones , sticks , and plastic bottles to the officials . &quot;
the officials first set a continuous pepper spray .
then the police used tear gas .
much tear gas was spra@@ yed towards the refugees .
thus the group was dissolved .
the refugees have now with@@ drawn some time .
a pregnant and apparently injured woman was removed from the zone .
&quot; children , who had breath@@ ed the tear gas , cried . &quot;
&quot; other refugees packed together , and suffered under the short@@ age of breath . &quot;
the press spokes@@ men of the Ser@@ b police also suffered injuries caused by the use of tear gas and pepper spray .
time of decision on interest rates for the US @-@ Bank
&quot; the world is watching when the US central bank accounts for two days , on Wednesday and Thursday , to make the important decision whether for the first time for almost a decade the interest is raised or not . &quot;
&quot; a survey among 80 econom@@ ists surv@@ ey@@ ed by Reu@@ ters found out that a little more than half , the last week of opinion was that the F@@ ed will do so , now thinks that the F@@ ed will remain somewhat longer and interest rates at the current level of 0 - 0,25 % . &quot;
&quot; it is a historical event , because it has been seven years since the F@@ ed interest dropped to NU@@ LL . &quot;
&quot; for the first time , we approach a situation where a large central bank may leave the zero area and start a process of norm@@ alisation of interest rates , &quot; said Angel U@@ bi@@ des , leader at Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot;
&quot; the US economy is on a relatively good performance level , tril@@ lion dollars are added to the balance sheet and generate only a low inflation . &quot;
&quot; however , the F@@ ed cannot ignore the less rocky outlook on global circumstances . &quot;
&quot; it has warned the markets to adjust to an increase , but the signs point out that the chances of such a step are good . &quot;
the decision will be announced at 8 pm CET on Thursday
Todes@@ schu@@ ze at the Delta State University leaving Comp@@ ens@@ ation Review
&quot; after shooting and killing his girl@@ friend in Miss@@ issi@@ ppi on Monday morning - and before he shot his colleagues later on the day , Sh@@ ann@@ on Lamb wrote a note to say that &quot; &quot; he could do it wrong &quot; , &quot; authorities announced on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; police in Gau@@ tier , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , said that Lamb , lec@@ turer for ge@@ ography and social scientific education at Delta State University , called the emergency number against 10 : 00 on Monday morning &quot;
&quot; and he said , he was shot on someone , and someone killed . &quot;
Lamb said to the staff of the emergency call centre that police officers must send police officers to his home .
&quot; he said , &quot; &quot; I shot my wife last night &quot; &quot; and he also mentioned that a &quot; &quot; sweet dog &quot; &quot; is in the house , but &quot; no one will distur@@ b , &quot; but probably excited . &quot;
&quot; the police asked the c@@ aller for his name , but he did not give him . &quot;
Lamb gave no explanation for his shots .
&quot; when the police entered the scene , they found the body of A@@ my Pr@@ enti@@ ss , 41 , and a hand@@ written notice of Lamb , 45 who said : &quot; I &apos;m sorry , I wanted , I could und@@ o it . &quot;
&quot; I loved A@@ my , and she is the only woman who ever loved me . &quot;
&quot; after writing the note Lamb sail@@ ed 300 miles to the Delta State University , where he killed E@@ than Schmidt , a professor of history , before he finally took his own life on Monday evening when polic@@ eman murdered him . &quot;
&quot; University President William LA@@ FOR@@ GE said he didn &apos;t know anything about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs &apos;s idea . &quot;
&quot; despite reports on Monday the Lamb was suppos@@ edly believed that Pr@@ enti@@ ss had a relationship with Schmidt , authorities said on Tuesday , there &quot; no information , no evidence &quot; for a &quot; tri@@ angular relationship . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Pr@@ enti@@ ss was written by Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , who said she was married for about seven years as a &quot; good person . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the two were divor@@ ced 15 years ago , but remained friends . &quot;
&quot; O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said , he and Pr@@ enti@@ ss had a daughter who is 19 and she was &quot; &quot; destroyed &quot; &quot; at the ground . &quot;
he said that Pr@@ enti@@ ss were her daughter &quot; absolutely best friends . &quot;
&quot; Pr@@ enti@@ ss worked online from home , according to L@@ ins@@ day Know@@ les , identified by Sun Her@@ ald as a close friend of Pr@@ enti@@ ss . &quot;
&quot; Know@@ les said that Pr@@ enti@@ ss , who possessed a dog named Light@@ ning , met with Lamb for about three years . &quot;
&quot; she always wanted to help other people , &quot; &quot; said Know@@ les &quot;
&quot; the police said , Lamb have inv@@ oked relatives at a certain point on Monday to tell them , &quot; &quot; He &apos;s not going to j@@ ail . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; when polic@@ emen caught him on Highway 1 near Green@@ ville later that night , Lamb drove his car to the side , fled away , ran into the forest and killed himself with a shot . &quot;
Lamb was awarded a doctoral degree from the Delta State University in the spring of 2015 as his life law on the University &apos;s website .
stars who lost their lucky charm
&quot; the actor ( left ) , in the picture with his son Red@@ mond ( right ) , had some stres@@ s@@ ful years . &quot;
&quot; in 2001 he fought against leu@@ k@@ emia , and in 2009 he lost his long@@ standing partner , Far@@ rah F@@ aw@@ c@@ ett , because of cancer . &quot;
&quot; the actor also claimed to fight with drugs , and in 2008 he was sentenced to drug possession . &quot;
all this certainly demands his tribute .
Euro@@ wings : Lufthansa to build the Group
Lufthansa is planning a large group conversion .
the Lufthansa Group wants to save half a billion euros in the year alone with a better organization .
150 of the approximately 1000 executives around the world will cost the workplace .
the new negotiations are underway with the pilot trade union .
Lufthansa is expanding its corporate structure and utili@@ zes Euro@@ wings .
&quot; the aim of the real@@ ignment is an earnings contribution of around € 500 million a year out of cost and proceeds syner@@ gies , the airline announced on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; among other things , Lufthansa is no longer liable for passenger operations in the future . &quot;
the Euro@@ wings low @-@ flight line should be developed as independent as possible .
&quot; in future , the management team headed by boss Carsten Sp@@ oh@@ r will be in charge of Karl Ulrich Gar@@ n@@ adt for Euro@@ wings . &quot;
&quot; with the new order , Sp@@ oh@@ r emphas@@ ises the importance of Euro@@ wings , with which the Group intends to compete against Ry@@ an@@ air and Easy@@ jet . &quot;
&quot; up to now , the organisation of the 120,000 staff was complex . &quot;
&quot; the airlines operated under the umbrella of the Passage Group , which represents three quarters of the annual turnover of EUR 30 billion . &quot;
new negotiations with the pilots
&quot; in the collective wage conflict with the pilot &apos;s association Cock@@ pit ( VC ) , negotiations should be res@@ um@@ ed again after the stri@@ k@@ ingly stu@@ b@@ born strike on this Thursday . &quot;
this divided the union .
the topic of talks should be the position of retirement for pilots .
&quot; in a year with a projected rec@@ or@@ der@@ result , the cock@@ pit wanted to come to sustainable results as soon as possible . &quot;
&quot; in recent months , the conflict between the union and airline has led to a number of strikes . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the transi@@ tional supply of pilots , the background is the &quot; Wings &quot; division . &quot;
it seems that Lufthansa is lag@@ ging in the fight against competi@@ tor routes to the Group &apos;s own Euro@@ wings group line .

Luke Sha@@ w from Manchester United can &apos;t play for months due to double frac@@ ture
Luke Sha@@ w suffered a double fac@@ ture of his right leg at the Champions League defeat of Manchester at PS@@ V Eind@@ hoven .
&quot; while this brought the left foreign def@@ ender to cry and exclude him from playing for at least six months , Louis van Ga@@ al does not hope that Sha@@ w can play back this season . &quot;
the injury was caused by a ru@@ th@@ less attack by H@@ é@@ c@@ tor Mor@@ eno in the 15 minute after the 20 @-@ year @-@ old Sha@@ w was forced into the PS@@ V area .
he was treated nine minutes on the field and needed oxygen before being taken to hospital .
&quot; van Ga@@ al said : &quot; &quot; he has a double correction and is in the hospital . &quot;
he will be moved tomorrow or maybe one day later and operated in Manchester .
&quot; it &apos;s horri@@ ble - a boy who comes with 18 to Manchester United , it &apos;s very hard and then plays fantastic , and then this happens . &quot;
in the locker room he had an oxygen mask .
he we@@ pt .
&quot; I am not a doctor , but if you have a double correction , then it lasts for six months , and it will not play in the group phase . &quot;
I hope he can play this season again .
Mor@@ eno seemed to be happy with a red card and the hanging of an El@@ f@@ meter escaped .
&quot; Nic@@ ola Ri@@ zz@@ oli , the refer@@ ee , did not pun@@ ish the Mex@@ ic@@ ans . &quot;
van Ga@@ al assumed that the Italian refer@@ ee had er@@ red .
you can judge for yourself if I say that an El@@ f@@ meter and a red card were due .
it was a very serious attack with both legs .
&quot; a twe@@ et of Sha@@ ws account was : &quot; &quot; I thank you all for your messages . words cannot describe how broken I am , my way to recovery starts now , I get stronger back . &quot;
related to this : Manchester United suffer@@ eth the loss of Luke Sha@@ w at the defeat at PS@@ V
&quot; with the European Championship in France , the United Kingdom def@@ ender has an additional incen@@ tive to recover until the next June . &quot;
&quot; Phil@@ lip Co@@ c@@ u , the PS@@ V @-@ Trainer , said : &quot; it is a very bad injury . &quot;
&quot; when a player leaves the place with this kind of injury , everyone is very sad about it . &quot;
it is never the intention of our players to hurt an opponent .
Mor@@ eno suffered a leg crash when Mexico played against Van Ga@@ als the Netherlands team at the 2014 World Cup .
&quot; he is very difficult because it was not his intention to hurt the opponent , and if you hear it &apos;s a very bad injury , that &apos;s not good , &quot; &quot; said Co@@ c@@ u . &quot;
for me it was not possible to see the moment .
&quot; the only thing I could see was the ball coming in a different direction so that it looked like he had touched him , but I couldn &apos;t see the attack on Luke . &quot;
&quot; in conversation with S@@ BS@@ 6 Mor@@ eno said : &quot; I know how it feels , I know how difficult it can be . &quot;
I feel very bad about it . I &apos;m so sorry .
the PS@@ V player Andr@@ és Gu@@ ard@@ ado was also taken to the hospital - after a f@@ oul@@ tery by Chris Sm@@ alling .
surely David Cameron The Lor@@ ax better know ?
&quot; it is one thing that all parents will soon learn : if your child loves a book , it will not take long until you know it almost . &quot;
unless you are David Cameron .
&quot; when he was asked by a provider of child care systems to name his favorite children &apos;s book , the premi@@ er decided for The Lor@@ ax , which was published in 1971 by Dr. Se@@ uss . &quot;
&quot; it was a difficult choice , he writes in a message on the Super@@ camp site , and continues : &quot; funny , moving , creative and with a powerful message , it is a book I like to read my children , because it always seems to have an image or a message that we have missed so far . &quot;
&quot; everything nice and good , except that the following paragraph , in which Cameron suppos@@ edly describes the story of the book , re@@ prints a content of the 2012 film version that added new characters and details to extend the rather short origin@@ als text . &quot;
&quot; in the midst of the w@@ alled city of the need @-@ Ville , where all nature has gone and even the air is a commodity , the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , the girl of his dreams , fulfilled , &quot; reads one . a love interest was Dr. Se@@ uss , whose real name was Theodor Se@@ uss ho@@ stage and who died in 1991 , however completely unknown . &quot;
&quot; in the w@@ alled city of the Lor@@ ax movie , which is presented on the website of Internet Movie Database , and so begins : &quot; in the w@@ alled city of the Need @-@ Ville , where everything is arti@@ fici@@ ally and even the air is a commodity , a boy named Ted wants to win the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , the girl of his dreams . &quot;
&quot; although he adm@@ its to be a prag@@ matic si@@ re , it seems unlikely that Cameron is familiar with the story of the book . here , an Un@@ named boy , as the local environment , falls through the gre@@ edy @-@ gre@@ edy , snow@@ y @-@ sav@@ age being , &quot; which speaks in the name of the trees , &quot; is devast@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; most likely , such a relatively low PR task was deleg@@ ated to a hel@@ per who did not read The Lor@@ ax for 20 consecutive years in a child . &quot;
a down@@ ing street spokes@@ woman said that the text was probably come by Cameron &apos;s election round office .
&quot; Super@@ camps confirmed that the text was delivered by Cam@@ er@@ on &apos;s staff , but gave no further immediate comments . &quot;
&quot; Adam Ly@@ th was clearly threatened by the exclusion from England &apos;s team , but it is still difficult &quot;
&quot; to hit Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates , is a difficult task , but if you see the cad@@ re that England has chosen for the tour , a re@@ petition of the 3 @-@ 0 test series defeat is not on my map . &quot;
I would not exclude a down@@ ward victory .
&quot; Al@@ ast@@ air C@@ ooks Page may be less experienced than those three years ago , but there are good spin players in the batch list , and the community spirit is strong ; they will not wear sc@@ ars of 2012 , only a y@@ outh@@ ful positive attitude . &quot;
&quot; with the ball Mo@@ een Ali is developing as spin @-@ bow@@ ler and Adi@@ l Ras@@ hid , even if it is an unknown size at test level , is an option for the attack . &quot;
this news : Adam Ly@@ th comes out of the England test cad@@ re and is replaced by Alex Hal@@ es .
&quot; the decision to release Adam Ly@@ th , of course , is difficult to analyze for me as his head coach in Yor@@ k@@ shire . &quot;
&quot; with his seven tests , there were two good attacks under difficult conditions , and the simple but hard reality is that cri@@ cket@@ players are oriented to results . &quot;
&quot; there was no question mark at Joe R@@ oot , for example , and that led to the nom@@ ination , there - and I told this before - players are their own best selection . &quot;
&quot; long ago , one would have extended the course of ly@@ th , but he had control over his own fate . &quot;
&quot; if he hopefully turns out more purchases for Yor@@ k@@ shire , there &apos;s another chance . &quot;
&quot; the England trainer Tre@@ vor Bay@@ l@@ iss praised his post@@ ure even if he did not bring such good performances , and that doesn &apos;t surprise me ; he is mainly a team man . &quot;
the question of how much time a test strike receives to set his mark is difficult .
&quot; Ly@@ th got seven chances - like Sam Rob@@ son before him , while Nick Comp@@ ton got nine . &quot;
only Comp@@ ton got the chance to play home and back@@ wards .
&quot; the only accus@@ ation that one can raise was that England initially deployed Jonathan Trot@@ t in the Caribbean - as Ly@@ th was in top form , but this lost opportunity is now in the past . &quot;
Alex Hal@@ es comes in and he is a drummer I appreciate very much .
&quot; he is an X @-@ factor cri@@ cket@@ player , what we saw at Yor@@ k@@ shire in this season when he achieved 236 against us on a Tr@@ ent Bridge place , which met us very much . &quot;
&quot; he must have at least the same chances as those before him , but this obviously depends on the team performance in the United Arab Emirates . &quot;
&quot; the idea to let mos@@ ques beat alongside Cook , which would provide an extra spin bow@@ ler and get four Qu@@ icks , appeared and I have nothing against it . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t see why a drummer can &apos;t beat there , and this left @-@ h@@ ander has already shown that he is a vi@@ cious circle of cri@@ cket players . &quot;
&quot; mo@@ een might not have done his job for his County Wor@@ c@@ ester@@ shire , but he is a number 3 for her , and there is no big difference . &quot;
my former team @-@ mate Jus@@ tin Lan@@ ger played his first 38 tests at the first drop before he joined in 2001 as an op@@ ener .
he made three hundred rings immediately and did not look back .
&quot; Z@@ af@@ ar Ans@@ ari comes in the cad@@ res as back @-@ up sp@@ inner , and in my limited handling with him he has impressed me as a young man . &quot;
&quot; people may see their statistics on average 31 with the bat and 35 with the ball - and think it &apos;s a p@@ unt , but there is no big number of back@@ ups that raise their hands and the trainers have chosen for youth . &quot;
he will learn a lot on this tour .
&quot; apart from the team , England made some clever additions to the trainer . &quot;
&quot; the appointment of Mah@@ ela Jay@@ awar@@ dene , the B@@ ats@@ man from Sri Lanka , as a consultant for the test games could be a master coup . &quot;
&quot; he is one of the nic@@ est guys of the game , who will bring a wealth of experience , since he has played under all conditions and against all attacks . &quot;
Paul Coll@@ ing@@ wood comes for the white ball stage of the tour and brings energy and a powerful commitment to the setup .
&quot; I always felt he was created for the international cri@@ cket competition , as a player or as coach , and as Mah@@ ela he has insights from which we can benefit . &quot;
&quot; sometimes new voices can bring fresh wind in the locker room , even if the messages are in line with the previously said . &quot;
&quot; Coll@@ ys team@@ mates at Dur@@ ham , Ben St@@ okes , is not used by the One @-@ Day@@ ers , R@@ oot got a similar break against Australia and I for my part have no problem with it . &quot;
&quot; some will not agree , but coaches and team members do not determine the schedule . &quot;
and you must remember that as with the players their jobs depend on the results .
such decisions are not taken lightly .
the Bre@@ x@@ it camp ( Bre@@ x@@ it = exit of Britain from the EU ) could gain additional allow@@ ances if the economy gets into a trap by 2017
&quot; David Cameron &apos;s unexpected real@@ location strategy to keep Britain in the EU is getting deeper into trouble with every day , even without the choice of the brilliant Jerem@@ y &quot; &quot; Is it Yes or No ? &quot; &quot; Cor@@ by@@ n to the leader of Labour or the TU@@ C , which broke out on Tuesday because of Europe on Tuesday . &quot;
foreigners also have their Cor@@ by@@ ns and Ni@@ gel Far@@ ages .
&quot; a European diplom@@ at fre@@ ed recently that some member states , so deeply involved in various crises , as the EU is now and not always from own gu@@ ilt , UK itself created agenda with split allow@@ ances and dis@@ rup@@ ting treaty changes that they usually do not want . &quot;
&quot; in Bri@@ gh@@ ton , the TU@@ C decided at its annual meeting that it doesn &apos;t like it if they je@@ op@@ ardi@@ se social protection . &quot;
we could also call it Dave and Georges Sel@@ f@@ ie @-@ Agenda .
&quot; Prime Minister and Finance Minister Cli@@ mb@@ ing on Summit or bilateral meetings in foreign capitals , make a photo of themselves in front of a famous local monument , with or without local sizes , come home and say that they win allies for reforms . &quot;
it &apos;s always about me .
&quot; my European friend , who wants an outside looking UK outside the EU tent - &quot; Let &apos;s not alone with France , &quot; says Berlin - and lets say that more and more short @-@ si@@ ghted ministers and officials have come to the point where it doesn &apos;t matter whether we remain or go . &quot;
&quot; German chan@@ cell@@ or Angela Merkel is an ally , but she has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave office before it looks bad for them , as in the exagger@@ ated long res@@ ins like th@@ at@@ cher ( 11 years ) , Mit@@ terr@@ and ( 14 ) and K@@ ohl ( 16 ) . &quot;
French François Hollande can look back on his re @-@ election or his replacement in 2017 .
he is also a verbal power .
&quot; Poland may soon have a nation@@ alist right government , Spain a lef@@ tist one . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s hard to imagine that they will get a leg to help the Sel@@ f@@ ie British , whose energy should be used better to prevent Scotland &apos;s exit from the UK - something they don &apos;t want , because most similar separ@@ ati@@ st tendencies have . &quot;
&quot; therefore , some such ministers may even deliberately not plan any helpful ann@@ ot@@ ations , very in the SN@@ P style , during the UK &apos;s referendum campaign to speed up the Bre@@ x@@ it process , my friend pres@@ umes . &quot;
&quot; the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation was a p@@ ity &quot; and &quot; Britain has won nothing of value from the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation . &quot;
Europeans know how pre@@ dat@@ ory the Fle@@ et Street can be at their expense and which EU scep@@ tics were the oli@@ gar@@ chy of press one as they were not supported by Tony Ben@@ n 1975 with a ratio of 2 : 1 in 1973 .
&quot; you can feel weak to Boris Johnson , the Er@@ z Euro opportun@@ ists who made a name as an &quot; EU straight ban@@ ana &quot; Brussels correspon@@ dent in the early 90 &apos;s . &quot;
&quot; with all his mad@@ ness , Ed Mili@@ band knew who were his enemies . &quot;
&quot; this included the Med@@ ley of tax @-@ fear@@ ing vill@@ ains , telephone @-@ h@@ acking foreigners and the pseu@@ do non @-@ nation@@ als who have most of our major newspapers . &quot;
&quot; actually Tony Bl@@ air thought much about her , but he stated that if you sit with a hot gor@@ illa in a cage , you better spread ban@@ anas to di@@ stract him instead of having lunch and dinner . &quot;
&quot; in fact , Mili@@ band was more Bl@@ ai@@ ri@@ ans than Bl@@ air himself when he opposed Cam@@ er@@ ons &apos;s referendum , because Bl@@ air had opposed the principle of the non @-@ adopted constitution of the EU , which was then rejected by French and Dutch vot@@ ers in 2005 , which opened up a door to him . &quot;
the press has never rejected him .
&quot; but the nice Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n , who gave me a friendly fla@@ p on the back on Monday in Westminster - I told him that he had no time to hurt me - seems at risk to repeat N@@ eil Kin@@ no@@ ck Boy@@ cot@@ t Mur@@ doch &apos;s strategy of the eigh@@ ties , a mistake back then and today . &quot;
&quot; it may take but he must develop a coher@@ ent strategy to win the media , not with me , but certainly with Andrew Mar@@ r , whose BBC sofa he left on Sunday . &quot;
Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s official position in Europe - I express it very friendly - in development .
he says that we should stay in a re@@ formed EU .
&quot; well , most people outside of U@@ ki@@ ps traditional anti @-@ scar@@ ce tendency and the wild ones of Tor@@ ys Klein @-@ Engl@@ ish@@ eries can say yes to everyone . &quot;
&quot; it is what Hil@@ ary &quot; &quot; A Ben@@ n , but no Benn@@ ite &quot; &quot; on the radio and on TV this week said when the boy@@ sc@@ outs were fighting in him , not admit that Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s appointment of the provo@@ king John Mc@@ Don@@ nell was a bad idea . &quot;
&quot; it reminded me of the 70s , when his old father tried to be on TV to be il@@ loyal to his Labour Cab@@ inet colleagues , without going too far and losing his cabinet job . &quot;
Hil@@ ary &apos;s fight was even more attractive .
&quot; but to fight to &quot; &quot; remain &quot; &quot; in all circumstances - Benn@@ s expression - was not what Mc@@ Don@@ nell said , what J@@ C told his comrades and de@@ pu@@ ties after all reports on her conference day on Monday evening . &quot;
&quot; whatever the ag@@ it@@ ous bottom @-@ up image of Cor@@ by@@ n wants to convey - remember that he even touched me - News discipline is important in the age of TV around the clock , and above all in the whirlpool of social media , a breeding site of Par@@ ano@@ ia and betra@@ yal . &quot;
&quot; it is true to give Cameron no badge for Europe , which allows him to keep Lab@@ ours support in the referendum campaign for a matter of course , as Mc@@ Don@@ nell said . &quot;
Simon J@@ enk@@ ins certainly thinks so .
&quot; but Mc@@ Don@@ nell and Cor@@ by@@ ns are fundamental ambig@@ u@@ ities for EU membership - in line with their Benn@@ ite Siege Industry , their anti @-@ capitalist past - is no longer just a question of es@@ ot@@ eric discussion among left dissi@@ dents , for which the nar@@ cis@@ s@@ ism of small difference is a central principle of dog@@ matic differences . &quot;
&quot; as with his ambig@@ u@@ ities at N@@ ato - Tom Wat@@ son , he is firmly convinced that J@@ C has no campaign to exit - foreign diplom@@ ats will be obliged to try to find a sense of their superi@@ ors at home . &quot;
why should Paris or Berlin waste political capital - they also have mis@@ guided vot@@ ers - to make conc@@ essions to the British if all this can be meaning@@ less ?
&quot; the US is already quite disappointed by the weak military performance in Iraq , Libya and Syria , even with a cost reduction of the T@@ ory government in power , which I was reminded of at the start on Monday of something that British Influ@@ ence Security Forum called . &quot;
experts critic@@ ise public health report on e @-@ cigar@@ ettes report
&quot; claims of a state @-@ funded agency that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are less harmful than smoking originated from a meeting of 12 people , partly with connections to tobacco industry , said researchers . &quot;
&quot; experts who write in the British Medical Journal ( BM@@ J ) , Lanc@@ et joined by cri@@ tici@@ zing the post@@ cards used by Public Health England ( P@@ he ) in their report on e @-@ cigar@@ ettes . &quot;
he published the &quot; basic report &quot; last month and describes it as a &quot; comprehensive review of evidence . &quot;
but some researchers have ques@@ tioned the load capacity of the data and pointed to the connections between some experts and the tobacco industry .
a leading article in the medical journal of Lanc@@ et last month attacked the &quot; extra@@ ordin@@ arily wind@@ y foundation &quot; on which he founded his most important conclusion .
two other researchers write in BM@@ J and asked if the claims are based on stone or sand .
&quot; Martin Mc@@ K@@ ee , Professor of European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Trop@@ ical Medicine and Simon Cap@@ e@@ well , Professor of Clinical Epidemiology at the University of Liverpool , said : &quot; a fundamental principle of public health is that strategies should be based on the evidence of effectiveness . &quot;
&quot; they said the public expects that &quot; &quot; the current best estimate is that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are about 95 % less harmful than smoking &quot; based on a detailed review of evidence and modelling . &quot;
&quot; in fact , this statement comes from a single session of 12 people who were conven@@ ed to develop a model for multiple criteria decision analysis ( Multi @-@ C@@ rit@@ eria Decision Analysis - MC@@ DA ) in order to demonstrate their opinions on the damage of different ni@@ cot@@ ine @-@ containing products to a synthesis ; the results of the meeting were summar@@ ised in a research report . &quot;
&quot; Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that a Sponsor of the meeting was a company called Euro@@ Swiss Health , whose managing directors had previously received British American Tob@@ acco means ( BA@@ T ) for an independent study . &quot;
&quot; he also signed the BA@@ T references to public health in a sustainability report , they said . &quot;
&quot; one of the 12 participants at the meeting explained to receive funds from an e @-@ cigar@@ ette manufacturer , but not the funding he was supposed to have received by the tobacco company Philip Morris International . &quot;
&quot; the reasons for selecting the members of the committee are not delivered , but there are several known e @-@ cigar@@ ettes champ@@ ions , some of which also include a sector financing in the paper . &quot;
some other participants at this meeting are not known for their know @-@ how in tobacco control .
&quot; at the meeting , the tobacco management was also attended by the P@@ he . &quot;
&quot; the research work of the group &quot; is indic@@ ative &quot; that there is a lack of &quot; hard evidence for the damage of most products in most of the criteria , &quot; signed Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well . &quot;
&quot; however , none of these links or limitations will be discussed in the P@@ he report . &quot;
&quot; Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that &quot; &quot; there has been no evidence that there has been no evidence that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes serve as a way to smoke for children or non @-@ smo@@ kers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Pro@@ f Kevin F@@ ent@@ on , Director of Health and Well @-@ Being at P@@ he said that BM@@ J &apos;s claims had already been re@@ acted before . &quot;
he said : &quot; e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are essentially less harmful than smoking . &quot;
every second life @-@ long smo@@ ker dies at his ad@@ diction .
&quot; all evidence suggests that the health risks of e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are low compared to that , but that we continue to study long @-@ term effects . &quot;
&quot; he has the clear obligation to inform the public about what evidence proves and what is not , especially if there is so much public confusion about relative dangers in comparison to tobacco . &quot;
&quot; nearly 8@@ 0,000 people are dying every year on a disease with respect to smoking , and smoking will cost the National healthcare system two billion £ a year . &quot;
&quot; by clear evidence of current evidence that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are not without risk , but only a fraction of damage caused by smoking , we comply with our national jurisdiction . &quot;
&quot; BBC should give up East@@ er@@ ders , says former head of Channel 4 &quot;
&quot; the former Chairman of Channel 4 , Luke Johnson , said the BBC should stop sending programs like East@@ er@@ ders and The Voice . he said that commercial ri@@ vals would give &quot; their right arm &quot; for hit shows like the Albert Square So@@ ap . &quot;
&quot; Johnson said that the broadcasting fee should be used only to make the type of programs sent , which are not sent by other UK transm@@ itters . &quot;
&quot; he cri@@ tici@@ zed the BBC to place publicly @-@ legal programs , probably seen by a smaller audience , to place in hard controversial time @-@ windows against the most popular shows of their ri@@ vals and broad@@ cast@@ ers like BB@@ C4 . &quot;
&quot; after the BBC Director , Tony Hall said that the company wanted to do more in partnership with other organizations , Johnson said that he tried to get in touch with the BBC for six years at Channel 4 without success . &quot;
&quot; I have problems with the idea that BBC programs are commissioned or sent , which would also clearly be shown by un@@ subsidi@@ zed ri@@ vals , &quot; said Johnson the senior communications committee as part of its investigation on the future of the BBC . &quot;
&quot; if you don &apos;t want to keep the radio fee , which I don &apos;t think for a good idea in the medium or long term , you should at least put his production on programs that others do not do or put on commission . &quot;
they send The Voice in a first @-@ class time window because they want to achieve the wid@@ est possible support for their future .
&quot; the idea that nobody else would show this is a joke , it &apos;s ridi@@ cul@@ ous , it &apos;s non@@ sense . &quot;
&quot; Johnson said : &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t see why a reg@@ res@@ sive tax is funded , which could also be financed without subsidies . &quot;
&quot; the Voice is such a program , East@@ En@@ ders is another , ad@@ mitt@@ edly both own productions . &quot;
&quot; frank@@ ly , other channels would give their right arm for it . &quot;
I am trying to see how this should be public television .
I don &apos;t think that this would reduce the BBC at all .
&quot; Johnson , an entrepren@@ eur for series , headed Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010 said that the BBC &apos;s fault on the hunt for reviews is &quot; because of the ambi@@ tions of the people who work there , and because they believe this is the best way to secure long @-@ term support . &quot;
&quot; his comments on BBC &apos;s most popular broad@@ casts reflect what the former conductor of Sky , Tony Ball , in his Mac@@ Tag@@ gart lecture in Edinburgh in 2003 suggested that the BBC shows like East@@ er@@ ders should sell . &quot;
&quot; Johnson said that the rather public @-@ law N@@ ic programs should go to BB@@ C4 , where you can &apos;t measure pretty much the audience , and they can argue if they have created all these obsc@@ ure missions for justi@@ fication of $ 4 billion , &quot; &quot; Well , of course , we have created all these obsc@@ ure programs that no one has seen . &quot;
they put them in a time window in which no one ever wanted to see them .
&quot; Johnson said to the committee : &quot; &quot; I urge you to find a rather reg@@ res@@ sive system in terms of conditions , who can get the best value from this . &quot;
&quot; of course , think of all that we all think that you get a great value for 150 £ a year , but for people who are a lot of money for the £ 150 , ask me if this is true , because they don &apos;t consume much of the BBC . &quot;
&quot; former Sky@@ - and Channel 5 boss David El@@ stein who also said before the committee on Tuesday urged the BBC to check its Rei@@ th@@ ian mission to &quot; &quot; inform , form and maintain . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; he said , only little of BBC production would now officially be classified as education - he said that it was 1 % of their TV production and 0.1 % on the radio - and she should take an example of this in &quot; &quot; inform , educ@@ ate and talk about this in &quot; &quot; public television channels in Australia and Canada . &quot;
&quot; the question of partnerships said El@@ stein , the BBC should do more in areas like that of the Pro@@ ms , from which he said that only a hand@@ ful on TV is shown , and with commercial Sen@@ ators alli@@ ances to make everything available online . &quot;
&apos;@@ Son@@ o@@ gene@@ tics &apos; can control brain cells by sound waves
the video shows how the n@@ em@@ ato@@ des change the direction in the moment they are ir@@ radi@@ ated with sound impulses .
scientists have bred the wor@@ ms with gene@@ tically modified nervous systems that can be controlled by out@@ breaks of sound waves .
the tiny n@@ em@@ ato@@ des change the direction in the moment when they have sound impulses which have high frequencies for the human ear to be heard .
&quot; the impulses work by switching mot@@ on@@ eur@@ one cells , which are gene@@ tically modified to carry the di@@ aphr@@ ag@@ m channels , which respond to ultr@@ asonic waves . &quot;
more on this topic : researchers read and write brain activity with light
&quot; the researchers said that wor@@ ms showed the power of a new method called Son@@ o@@ genetic , where ultras@@ ound can be used to activate a number of brain , heart and muscle cells outside the body . &quot;
&quot; S@@ re@@ ek@@ an@@ th Chal@@ as@@ ani , researcher at the Sal@@ k Institute in La J@@ oll@@ a , California , said the Guardian that the procedure of one day could replace the depth of brain stimulation , a invasive procedure that gives electric impulses in the brain of people to treat the symptoms of Park@@ inson &apos;s disease . &quot;
&quot; thread@@ wor@@ ms usually do not react to ultras@@ ound , but Chal@@ as@@ ani noted that they did it if they were surrounded by a fluid with micro@@ sc@@ opic air bub@@ bles . &quot;
&quot; the bub@@ bles , he found out , rein@@ force the ultr@@ asonic waves , which then penet@@ rate into the wor@@ ms . &quot;
the ampli@@ fied ultr@@ asonic waves act on structures called TR@@ P @-@ 4 ion@@ ic channels and found in the membran@@ es of some of the thro@@ wer &apos;s cells .
the sound waves effect the opening of these ion@@ ic channels and activate the cells they are assigned to such a report Nature Communications .
&quot; to create ultr@@ asonic @-@ controlled n@@ em@@ ato@@ des , chal@@ as@@ ani gene@@ tically modified the wor@@ ms so that some of their Mot@@ on@@ eur@@ one TR@@ P @-@ 4 ion channels carry . &quot;
&quot; when using ultras@@ ound to the changed creatures , the sound waves are ampli@@ fied by the micro@@ bes and transferred to the wor@@ ms where they turn on the changed mot@@ on@@ eur@@ one . &quot;
&quot; the process has some simil@@ arities with Op@@ to@@ gene@@ tics , a ground@@ breaking tool that allows scientists to turn on and off neur@@ ons with impulses of light . &quot;
but Chal@@ as@@ ani said that Son@@ o@@ gene@@ tics might have some advantages over this technique .
&quot; in contrast to light that must be sent down on a optical fiber to the desired position in the brain , low frequency ultras@@ ound waves can happen un@@ hin@@ dered and can thus be sent to the brain from above on the skull . &quot;
&quot; we believe that with gene therapy and a therapeutic virus it is possible to temporarily make the target human neur@@ ons vulnerable to the ultras@@ ound signal in a clinical setting for certain neurolog@@ ical treatments , &quot; said Chal@@ as@@ ani . &quot;
&quot; other applications could focus on muscle cells and insulin @-@ producing cells , he added . &quot;

&quot; but a separate campaign also leads to many posters , which are to be seen at bus stations and in the subway trains and which require a second look . &quot;
&quot; important announcement : from 15 to 18 September with DL@@ R ? &quot; ( Do@@ ck@@ lands Light Railway ) , one reads in the font types of London Underground and the trademark of the DL@@ R line that turns into the image of a tank . &quot;
in September a flock of tru@@ ste@@ es will drive with the DL@@ R ... customers are asked to help stop the weapons fair .
the 300 posters are artists who exhibited their work at the Museum of Cru@@ el Design in Ban@@ sys Dis@@ pa@@ que .

&quot; after G@@ avin Gr@@ ind@@ on , Cur@@ ator of Cru@@ e@@ ol Design and Lec@@ turer at the University of Es@@ sex , artists become more critical and attempt to bring political works to the audience outside galleries . &quot;
many artists engage with activists in protest movements to work and notice that they have to go outside into the real world so that their art has an impact on society .
another of the anti @-@ arms trade posters greet the commu@@ ters in the subway .
&quot; the Am@@ ne@@ sty video was viewed more than 100,000 times in 24 hours via Facebook and was created by the V@@ C@@ CP advertising agency that works with the graphic artist and Vo@@ ic@@ e@@ Over artist , who also works for free . &quot;
&quot; V@@ C@@ CP Creative Director Matt L@@ ever was amazed at the silence that prev@@ ailed around the advertising for the weapons fair - by a void of the Ex@@ Ce@@ L calendar - and thought : &quot; &quot; let &apos;s give them the campaign they try to avoid . &quot;
&quot; they played with the invention of a more realistic sket@@ chy corporate advertising , but &quot; through the da@@ zz@@ ling with bright colours and animation , it remains stronger . &quot;
&quot; they did a fantastic job by helping us to raise awareness of the sale of illegal torture devices at the fair , &quot; says Tom Davi@@ es of Am@@ ne@@ sty . &quot;
what we need now is a step @-@ by @-@ step of the British government and the guarantee that torture devices will not be tra@@ ded illeg@@ ally at our front door .

eight golden rules for living in student residence halls
&quot; eleven years ago , I moved as a home @-@ for@@ get@@ ed 19 @-@ year @-@ old in a student residence , still in faith in Ber@@ ets and moral rel@@ ati@@ vis@@ m , but only now I remember the ten@@ se sm@@ iles of those I have anno@@ yed - and to the numerous , leng@@ thy complaints about others . &quot;
most of what I have learned can be distill@@ ed in eight simple rules .
the entry in student residen@@ ces ranges from slightly nerve w@@ re@@ cking to absolutely horri@@ fying .
&quot; it is temp@@ ting to mu@@ zzle : people tell where you are coming , whether and where you have taken the Sabbath year , where you stand in reference to Cor@@ by@@ n and why you &quot; hon@@ estly Mar@@ m@@ ite do not love or hate because in serious , guys , it &apos;s just a yeast extract h@@ ah@@ aha , I am in my room . &quot;
breathe through .
help others to do the same - ask questions and show interest .
&quot; it direc@@ ts the conversation and helps you to find out people who like you as opposed to those that you wouldn &apos;t talk , even if your lashes were burning in fire and these fire extingu@@ ishers would be . &quot;
let people .
&quot; people often turn into drinks recipes , film @-@ night venues and communal meeting points , but they are also the places where people are attrac@@ ting and their under@@ wear . &quot;
related to this : do not remember to start at the university with a relationship
intro@@ ver@@ ted received a rough treatment at the university .
&quot; your room should be a refuge , but many student residen@@ ces form a space @-@ to @-@ room bum@@ ble@@ bee culture that is friendly and social and can lead to life @-@ long friendship . &quot;
this can be hell for someone trying to recover .
&quot; nothing in cultivation allows you to say : &quot; &quot; I like you , and I want our friendship continue , but you have to go away so that I get the energy I consumed for interaction with you . &quot;
try to sense when a milit@@ ant is exhausted from con@@ vi@@ vi@@ ality - and send it an SMS instead of kno@@ cking .
apro@@ pos anch@@ oring : do it .
a guy in my student residen@@ ces had the idea that a closed door was an invitation .
he saw some things .
friendship close by baking .
&quot; as you begin the Uni at the peak of back @-@ man@@ ia , the kno@@ cking on the doors of people to present yourself with a plate full of brow@@ ni@@ es is less strange than the welcome of the 1950 &apos;s &quot; welcome in the neighborhood , I have something baked . so , and now please smile when I ask you some personal questions . &quot;
offering home @-@ made goo@@ dies is a good way to close friend@@ ships .
your room@@ mates feel oblig@@ ated to enter@@ tain themselves and will eventually associate your face with a tasty surprise .
&quot; of course , this depends on whether you are a decent b@@ aker . &quot;
&quot; bad mixing cl@@ ots of flour , sugar and fat lead to people sleeping when you kno@@ cking . &quot;
ste@@ al food is a common crime in student residence .
&quot; of course , the c@@ law of chicken is a theft , but is it taking a drop of a drop of milk for your tea too ? &quot;
please check that with the milk owner .
&quot; chances are good that they say , even when they cook in the interior . &quot;
&quot; if someone ste@@ als your stuff , that &apos;s anno@@ ying , and you have my compassion - but try to deal with it as my ro@@ ommate , adding a pur@@ ge to her milk to pun@@ ish thi@@ eves . &quot;
she is now in prison .
they should not make any noise that keeps people from sleep or work .
&quot; it is not just about being a decent person , but that you belong to the people in the tru@@ est sense of the pro@@ ver@@ dic@@ ts that sit in the glass house . &quot;
&quot; a girl in my hall@@ way asked her neighbours if it makes them something to make drums and bass a bit qui@@ eter , because it was three o &apos;clock in the morning and she had a test in the morning . &quot;
they responded with even more loud music .
&quot; when she finally stopped at 5 o &apos;clock , she kindly kept her neighb@@ ors sleeping two hours before she left her own music , shut her door and went to her three hour test . &quot;
wouldn &apos;t it be romantic if your future spouse would acci@@ dentally move into the same residence residence ?
&quot; conver@@ sely , it wouldn &apos;t be deeply embarrass@@ ed if you are holding a ro@@ ommate for your future spouse to dis@@ connect and see them every day , and perhaps experience how they are moving every day together ? &quot;
&quot; of course , the heart goes his own way - but if a hot ro@@ ommate definitely isn &apos;t your future spouse , try at least to talk to your abdom@@ en a little reason . &quot;
&quot; in the exciting moment you notice someone has his key in his un@@ locked room , the border is between an Ul@@ k and mo@@ b@@ bing fin@@ er than it seems . &quot;
&quot; a good stroke is fun , but it only takes moments until it becomes a bo@@ omer@@ ang . &quot;
give by hiding a valuable and am@@ using lesson about security - but do not di@@ gest someone &apos;s room with tooth@@ paste and sh@@ ampoo .
close your door and place your keys into a glass of water which you then put in the freezer - but do not t@@ ack their pos@@ sessions on the ceiling more than twice .

Markus Gil@@ dner : the mass accommodation in containers or gy@@ ms has no sustainability .
for people stay in a large part here .
&quot; in view of the flow of refugees , we need enough living space in the next decades . &quot;
&quot; a very ban@@ al , three @-@ storey semi @-@ detached house is the solution . &quot;
Gil@@ dner : a town@@ house needs the least space .
it facilitates integration .
this is different if people are accommod@@ ated in blocks of residential blocks .
&quot; each of the six homes , which are currently being built in the pilot project , consists of three residential units for four asylum seek@@ ers each . &quot;
&quot; each unit has two bedrooms , a bathroom , a kitchen and a lounge . &quot;
&quot; it may be that many refugees will say it is again peace , I go back . &quot;
then the houses can be adapted easily according to their respective needs .
how high are the costs ?
&quot; Gil@@ dner : the price for 160 square meters of living space per house amounts to 184 000 euros , without land . &quot;
this is man@@ age@@ able .
the construction took six months .
this is appropriate .
did the building regulations get complicated ?
&quot; Gil@@ lian : I have correctly drawn up my project , building legally . &quot;
especially complicated makes it always the threatening D@@ amo@@ cles special construction and the Ord@@ inary Ord@@ in@@ ance .
Gr@@ us@@ el@@ ig .
&quot; it is still under@@ going , who creates three apartments in a row house , needs at least three pitches . &quot;
there is no room for this in the cities .
and refugees and asylum seek@@ ers have no cars .
how did the inhabitants react to their terrac@@ ed house project ?
&quot; Gil@@ lian : there were those who repro@@ ached me , to build luxury buildings for asylum seek@@ ers . &quot;
what definitely isn &apos;t right .
but do you not tigh@@ ten the competition for affordable housing ?
&quot; Gil@@ lian : true is true : in the last five years we had a construction boom in Germany , but built in luxury flats that can hardly afford any more . &quot;
&quot; my project has the message , even everyday people need living space . &quot;
&quot; not only refugees , but also the alone educ@@ ating mother or the Ger@@ ing@@ ver@@ dien@@ er . &quot;
I &apos;ll show you how to build cheap and well @-@ priced today .
that &apos;s why it &apos;s all about .

iOS 9 : how to get the new iPhone operating system if Apple update is released
&quot; the new operating system can be requested by going to the sett@@ ing@@ App , click &quot; General &quot; and then select &quot; Software Update . &quot; &quot;
&quot; if it is ready , the phone gives you the option to download and then install . &quot;
&quot; some have encountered problems after the installation , as they get an error message telling that the &quot; &quot; software update failed &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; to circum@@ vent the problem , users are recommended to either wait until the rush returns or trying to update via iTunes . &quot;
the phone itself guides you through the rest of the process .
&quot; this may mean del@@ eting apps to create space - but Apple has rendered it more impro@@ b@@ able due to the limitation of the updates . similarly , it will be easier to delete apps and then re @-@ install apps once the process is completed . &quot;
&quot; it is worthwhile to make sure that your cell phone is charged while updating or located near a charger , so that the battery is charged . &quot;
&quot; if the load is too low , Apple does not allow the update to continue , as the phone might turn off half@@ way and lead to a crash of the update . &quot;

Ros@@ enberg &apos;s sole devot@@ ion : full attacks
N@@ ico Ros@@ berg knows only one motto in the fight for the title of the World Cup title against his clearly leading Mercedes team@@ mates Lewis Hamilton . &quot; full attack . &quot;
&quot; before the start , the World Cup @-@ second emphasized before the start into the decisive seven overseas races , &quot; that I have nothing to lose . &quot;
53 points separate the Vice World Champion before the second race in Singapore on this Sunday of title def@@ enders and two @-@ way champion Hamilton .
the Brit@@ on won seven of the previous twelve races of the season and took the floo@@ d@@ light Grand Prix in the city state as a favorite .
&quot; in 2009 and last year , the 30 year old Brit@@ on was able to win the race . &quot;
whether the current smo@@ g in the city state will influence the Grand Prix of Singapore is still uncle@@ ar .

bad Kis@@ singer Schach@@ club has a prominent member
&quot; founded three months ago Schach@@ club &quot; Schach@@ freunde Bad Kis@@ singen &quot; has added another member in its ranks , so the number of members increased to 19 players . &quot;
&quot; the new member is the entrepren@@ eur Paul G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann , a passionate chess and tennis player who spent more than 40 times in Bad Kis@@ singen . &quot;
G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann is the carrier of the Bundes@@ ver@@ dienst@@ kreuz 1 . class and honor@@ ary citizen of the cities of Esp@@ el@@ kamp and L@@ üb@@ be@@ cke .
G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann has supported the chess club in Bad Kis@@ singen with a donation that President Alfred Klein received .
&quot; thus , it is possible to record chess players who cannot raise the membership fee . &quot;
youth work and talent search will also be promoted .
&quot; G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann hopes that membership in the chess club and also friendly contact to the tennis club &quot; &quot; Red @-@ White &quot; &quot; is seen as an expression of his connection with the spa town . &quot;
Qu@@ arti@@ ers@@ büro is looking for direct contact
Sal@@ u@@ dis and the care centre Anton@@ isti@@ ft have gathered together under the Co@@ at of the Social Foundation and opened a new stop at Graf @-@ St@@ auff@@ enberg .
&quot; in addition to consult@@ ations , you can also participate in courses . &quot;
the social foundation desc@@ ends from the mountain into the city centre .
more precisely to the Graf @-@ St@@ auff@@ enberg @-@ Platz .
a new lod@@ gings were recently opened there .
&quot; here , immediately next to the shopping market , sen@@ iors and coun@@ sel@@ ors receive information on questions such as health insurance or services for health and care insurance . &quot;
&quot; for years , we have been working with our out@@ patient care service that often car@@ egi@@ vers are left alone . &quot;
there are infin@@ itely many questions .
&quot; not rarely , many services are not used because the complexity of the insur@@ ances is hardly understood , &quot; explained the new house@@ keeper Jutta W@@ eig@@ and , who is also responsible for the Anton@@ isti@@ ft and the Ci@@ vic Hospital as well as for the ambul@@ ant service &quot; Amadeus . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in addition to the consult@@ ations , the new district office also offers prevention , health courses and wellness . &quot;
&quot; for this purpose , the Sal@@ u@@ dis was taken into the boat . &quot;
&quot; therefore , you can use additional offers such as storm prevention , memory training or a physi@@ otherapeu@@ tic treatment . &quot;
the offers from the Senior Ci@@ tizens Centre and the Sal@@ u@@ dis complement each other ideally .
&quot; Sal@@ u@@ dis stands for prevention , prevention , and rehabilitation . &quot;
&quot; the senior centre for care and care , &quot; explained Heike R@@ ie@@ del , manager of Sal@@ u@@ dis . &quot;
&quot; the reason for the opening of the new district offices in the city centre , both executives see particularly demographic change . &quot;
because this makes a good de@@ centr@@ alised infrastructure indispensable in the various districts of Bamberg in the future .
&quot; moreover , Mayor Wolfgang Metz@@ ner ( SPD ) under@@ lined the inaugur@@ ation celebrations , the district office also dedic@@ ates itself to the meeting at the age : &quot; there are numerous events and offers on the program and they invite to a regular soci@@ etal co @-@ operation . &quot;
&quot; with this , the Sozial@@ stiftung will make a big contribution that sen@@ iors can live as independent as possible and well in their familiar environment . &quot;
&quot; the lodging office is open Monday , Wednesday and Friday from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m. , Tuesday and Thursday from 4 p.m. to 6 p.m. and on Satur@@ days from 10 a.m. to noon . &quot;

males beat on 17 @-@ year @-@ old Afgh@@ ans
&quot; witnesses searched the police for a incident in Bad So@@ den @-@ Sal@@ mün@@ ster : on Friday evening , at 11 : 45 pm , three young men were on foot from Bad So@@ den towards Sal@@ mün@@ ster . &quot;
&quot; one of the group , a 17 @-@ year @-@ old Afgh@@ an , followed his two friends at a distance of about five meters and called to them that one should wait for him . &quot;
at that time the group was at the level of b@@ ft gas station .
there were also three persons on the premises of the gas station .
one of these men now sh@@ ou@@ ted the young man and hit his face with the f@@ ist .
the victim suffered a nose and ble@@ ed strongly from the nose .
&quot; when his two friends made ha@@ ste and appe@@ aled to the r@@ ack@@ et , he first let off from his sacrifice . &quot;
&quot; from his friends , the wounded young man was brought home . &quot;
the perpet@@ r@@ ator followed the group with a passenger car up to the apartment and drove demonstrations there several times .
&quot; when you didn &apos;t see the car any longer , the wounded passed the building to smoke a cigar@@ ette . &quot;
there he was attacked by the r@@ ack@@ et and another male person again .
&quot; under the aid of a head@@ stock , one examined the face and the th@@ igh@@ s of the victim . &quot;

Dr. Frank Müller takes over office breaks and inv@@ ests 3@@ 10000 Euros
Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll and Frank Müller ( from left ) take over the practice of Karl @-@ Heinrich and Ur@@ sel Fel@@ nes .
&quot; the Mayor Bernd Bor@@ mann , econom@@ ist U@@ ta Sei@@ m @-@ Schw@@ art@@ z and A@@ sen@@ dor@@ fs mayor Hein@@ fried Kab@@ bert are also happy about this . &quot;
&quot; in many places in the country doctors - A@@ sen@@ dorf , on the other hand , are lucky : there Dr. Frank Müller takes over the practice of rock breaks on October 1 . &quot;
&quot; while Ur@@ sel Fel@@ t@@ ausen is reti@@ ring , her husband Karl @-@ Heinrich stands on his successor in the next few months . &quot;
&quot; after a reconstruction phase , Müller opens the practice on October 12 , until then he invested € 3@@ 10000 in the premises at St@@ .-@@ Mar@@ cell@@ us@@ straße 6 . &quot;
&quot; it was sympathy at first sight , when the standing out of years ago Frank Müller and his wife Dr. Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll met who are currently completing their training in the Ver@@ den Hospital , who also wants to get into practice coming year . &quot;
&quot; we always had in mind that the g@@ arb@@ age would fit well into this practice , &quot; says Dr. Ur@@ sel Fel@@ breaks and laugh@@ s . &quot;
&quot; when it was time , I simply called them . &quot;
the couple Müller liked the idea to pursue their own practice in A@@ sen@@ dorf in the future .
&quot; the proximity and constant contact with the patients are very attractive for us , &quot; says the 39 @-@ year @-@ old Müller . &quot;
&quot; we want to meet and accompany the families over the years . &quot;
&quot; as an advantage , he also sees his own boss soon . &quot;
and so it was agreed that the Müll@@ ers bought the house with the practice .
they will continue to live in Bruch@@ hausen @-@ Vil@@ sen .
&quot; there the two @-@ fold family father Frank Müller grew up , his medical studies in Hanover followed stations in several medical offices and hospitals in Sul@@ ingen , Ni@@ enburg and Rot@@ enburg . &quot;
he is currently active as a senior physician in Sul@@ ingen . in 2009 he was appointed as a leading emergency doctor in Di@@ ep@@ holz district in 2009 and is engaged in an honor@@ ary capacity in the DRC @-@ readiness of Bruch@@ hausen @-@ Vil@@ sen .
&quot; as of September 19 , the practice will be prepared for the new boss . &quot;
&quot; while the sur@@ geon works Dr. Karl @-@ Heinrich Fel@@ t@@ ausen as a resident doctor , his wife Ur@@ sel ( Intern@@ ist ) speci@@ alizes in g@@ astro@@ enter@@ ology . &quot;
&quot; the g@@ arb@@ age cans , both inter@@ ni@@ sts , want to be established as general practitioners . &quot;
&quot; end@@ os@@ copy therefore comes out , &quot; says the 38 @-@ year @-@ old Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll . &quot;
after the conversion the rooms are modern .
we will offer more ultr@@ asonic examinations as well as long @-@ term and stress @-@ EK@@ Gs and need a speaking room more .
&quot; in addition , the ED@@ V is completely renewed . &quot;
&quot; the Müll@@ ers will receive a supplement of € 500@@ 00 ( 25,000 Euros ) and the municipality ( 12@@ 500 euros ) and the municipality ( 12@@ 500 euros ) . &quot;
&quot; this shows how proud and happy we are , that the practice is continued , &quot; says Dr. Bernd Bor@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; according to Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll , approximately 2000 patients come into practice in the field of rock breaks , according to Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll . in the North German average practice it is about 500 . &quot;
in A@@ sen@@ dorf there is another veter@@ inary practice .
a positive side effect of the practice tak@@ eover by Frank Müller : the pharmacy remains according to Ur@@ sel Fel@@ st@@ ausen in A@@ sen@@ dorf .
&quot; if no successor is found , she would have gone . &quot;
&quot; by the way , he who visits Müll@@ ers &apos;s surgery , also looks in familiar faces : takes over the seven medical professionals and the cleaning power of the rock walls . &quot;
&quot; with their departure in A@@ sen@@ dorf an era ends , after all , the medical professionals have practiced for 30 years . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning we had only two rooms , &quot; Ur@@ sel Fel@@ lowship reminds itself sm@@ iling . &quot;
a little nostal@@ gic feel they already feel after the long time .
&quot; but we continue to live in Hohen@@ mo@@ or and will see many patients , &quot; &quot; says the Intern@@ ist . &quot;
her husband laugh@@ s laugh@@ ing : &quot; we have a 6000 square metre plot . &quot;
&quot; so far I have always pressed myself before gardening , now that could be different . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the pair has two grand@@ sons and likes to travel . &quot;
Croatia : &quot; we leave the refugees by &quot;
&quot; now the border controls are also passed on to our southern border , &quot; said Minister of the Interior Johanna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner . &quot;
the controls on the Hungarian border remain unchanged in parallel .
&quot; as before , it is clear that anyone who wants to make an asylum application can also &quot; &quot; of course &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the care and safety of the people is in the foreg@@ round .
&quot; but it is clear that it needs clear signals , &quot; &quot; said the minister . &quot;
&quot; people must know that we do not accept bor@@ der@@ less migration flows , nor about the Austrian @-@ Sloven@@ ian border . &quot;
it needs a controlled approach .
Croatia is considering &quot; Cor@@ ridor &quot; - Slovenia ref@@ uses
&quot; the Croatian government had previously announced that Slovenia wants to continue to travel to Austria and Germany , and may also er@@ ect cor@@ rid@@ ors for the refugees . &quot;
&quot; the Interior Minister Ves@@ na Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar , however , did not look like this in Lai@@ bach . &quot;
&quot; the idea of cor@@ rid@@ ors is &quot; absolutely un@@ acceptable , &quot; Slovenia will rather intensi@@ fy the monitoring of the border - especially in Hungary . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , the border with Croatia is already heavily controlled as the outside limit of the Schengen area . &quot;
&quot; as the minister stressed , Sloven@@ ian will not be willing to accept its borders for refugees . &quot;
&quot; each member of the EU must fill out its commitments , otherwise the system cannot work , &quot; &quot; stressed Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar . &quot;
&quot; as the Croatian government hur@@ ried , the first refugees had already attempted to pass in eastern Croatia at the border crossing of T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik / Si@@ d in eastern Croatia , in order to avoid registration . &quot;
the Croatian police could pick them up in nearby corn fields .
&quot; according to local media , the Croatian T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik continually meets police vehicles with new refugees . &quot;
&quot; it is predominantly Syri@@ ans and Afgh@@ ans , including numerous women and children . &quot;
rescue services and the Red Cross are already in use .
&quot; in the coming days , his country reck@@ ons with around 4000 refugees , Minister of Minister R@@ ank@@ o Ost@@ o@@ j@@ ic . &quot;
&quot; in addition , buses from Pres@@ evo at the Mac@@ ed@@ onian @-@ Ser@@ b border , which hi@@ ther@@ to have brought migrants to the Hungarian border , were diver@@ ted towards Croatia , backed by Croatian and Serbian media on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; however , the government in Belgrade denied that it was the people to approach certain routes : &quot; &quot; neither can we nor do we do this , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; according to the media reports , in the morning a first bus with about 50 refugees arrived in the Serbian border town of Si@@ d , in the course of the day further buses would be expected . &quot;
&quot; about Croatia , Slovenia and Austria to Germany &quot;
the passengers were on the road all night away from the Mac@@ ed@@ onian border that was about 500 kilometers away .
&quot; we heard that Hungary has admitted , so the police told us that we should go here , &quot; said one of the refugees . &quot;
&quot; they wanted to travel to Germany by Croatia , Slovenia and Austria . &quot;
&quot; thus , the postpon@@ ement of the previous Balkan @-@ Greece @-@ Macedonia @-@ Serbia @-@ Hungary @-@ Hungary @-@ Hungary @-@ Hungary @-@ Hungary @-@ Hungary @-@ Hungary @-@ Hungary @-@ Hungary @-@ Hungary @-@ Hungary @-@ Hungary @-@ Hungary @-@ Hungary @-@ Hungary @-@ Hungary @-@ Hungary @-@ Hungary @-@ Hungary @-@ Hungary @-@ Hungary @-@ Hungary @-@ Hungary @-@ Hungary @-@ Hungary @-@ Hungary @-@ Hungary @-@ Hungary @-@ Hungary @-@ Hungary @-@ Hungary @-@ Hungary @-@ Hungary @-@ Hungary @-@ Hungary @-@ Hungary @-@ Hungary @-@ Hungary @-@ Hungary @-@ Hungary @-@ Hungary @-@ Hungary @-@ Hungary @-@ Hungary @-@ Hungary @-@ Hungary @-@ Hungary @-@ Hungary @-@ Hungary @-@ Hungary @-@ Hungary @-@ Hungary @-@ Hungary @-@ Hungary @-@ Hungary @-@ Hungary @-@ Hungary @-@ Hungary @-@ Hungary @-@ Hungary @-@ Hungary @-@ Hungary @-@ Hungary @-@ Hungary @-@ Hungary @-@ Hungary @-@ Hungary @-@ Hungary @-@ Hungary @-@ Hungary @-@ Hungary @-@ Hungary @-@ Hungary @-@ Hungary @-@ Hungary @-@ Hungary @-@ Hungary @-@ Hungary @-@ Hungary @-@ Hungary @-@ Hungary @-@ Hungary @-@ Hungary @-@ Hungary @-@ Hungary @-@ Hungary @-@ Hungary @-@ Hungary @-@ Hungary @-@ Hungary @-@ Hungary @-@ Hungary @-@ Hungary @-@ Hungary @-@ Hungary @-@ Hungary @-@ Hungary @-@ Hungary @-@ Hungary @-@ Hungary @-@ Hungary @-@ Hungary @-@ Hungary @-@ Hungary @-@ Hungary @-@ Hungary
&quot; Croatia : &quot; &quot; comprehensive options for border control &quot; &quot; &quot;
Croatia Interior Minister Ost@@ o@@ j@@ ic had previously stressed that his country has prepared appropriate plans for potential exceptions to refugees in the case of a strong influ@@ x of refugees .
&quot; he did not call it details , but pointed out that Croatia as a non @-@ Schengen member has &quot; &quot; comprehensive possibilities for border control . &quot; &quot; &quot;
perform strict controls to qualify for membership in the Schengen area .
&quot; Slovenia has been part of this since 2007 , the EU partners throughout the country have consistently witnessed a good testimony to the standard of border controls . &quot;
&quot; on the Serbian side , some 300 refugees continue to stand behind the Hungarian border fence . &quot;
&quot; according to Belgrade &apos;s media reports , they would have spent the past night at the border crossing of Hor@@ gos , which leads to R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke . &quot;
&quot; according to Hungarian authorities , the two border cross@@ ings Hor@@ gos and Back@@ i Bre@@ g remain completely blocked . &quot;
whether the remaining refugees wish to travel to the Croatian border is still uncle@@ ar .
Serbian Minister of Interior Minister N@@ ebo@@ j@@ sa Stef@@ ano@@ vic tried to so@@ jour@@ n in Hor@@ gos on Wednesday early : he considers the debates on alternative routes of refugees after the Hungarian border is now closed .
it would not be about a very high number of refugees .
&quot; one could not yet say whether they would continue their journey through Hungary , Croatia or another country . &quot;
hel@@ pers ro@@ de migrants - dangerous - alternative routes
&quot; however , private Hungarian refugees have already begun distribut@@ ing maps to refugees on which alternative routes are marked by Croatia . &quot;
&quot; however , the border crossing between Serbia and Croatia is not dangerous : in parts of the border area , even 20 years after the end of the Croatian war there are still un@@ cleared min@@ e@@ fields . &quot;
on Wednesday afternoon Croatian police announced that a team of mine clearance was sent to the border region .

the head of the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical Hos@@ pi@@ ce aid is available to the pedestri@@ ans as well as for questions and talks as the volunteers .
&quot; while some people spont@@ aneously navigate to the chal@@ k and put the phrase to &quot; my life , &quot; &quot; to read &quot; my life , &quot; &quot; stop the war &quot; or &quot; don &apos;t suffer long &quot; , others stay short , read , say sentences like &quot; so far I am not yet &quot; and then go on . &quot;

&quot; Fed@@ Ex @-@ result bl@@ ended , financial outlook for 2016 &quot;
&quot; Fed@@ Ex reports dis@@ ap@@ pointing results for the last quarter , and the supplier giant revealed its prospects for a whole year because of the weaker demand for cargo services and higher costs in its body transport service . &quot;
&quot; the company also said that it plans to hire approximately 5@@ 5,000 seasonal workers for the holiday . &quot;
&quot; at this point in last year , Fed@@ Ex announced that the company wants to set 50,000 seasonal workers for the holiday season . &quot;
the share fell over 2.5 percent in the after@@ market trade 45 minutes before the opening on Wednesday .
&quot; Fed@@ Ex Corp. said to make a profit between $ 10.@@ 40 and 10,@@ 90 $ in the financial year ending in May , 20 C@@ ent less than in previous forecast . &quot;
analysts expect a survey of Fac@@ t@@ Set 10.@@ 84 $ .
&quot; in spite of the price increases , the lower prospect will be 8.9 percent and will be effective on 4 January and despite a higher surcharge for body transport of heavy and large packages , which will be raised from November . &quot;
&quot; the company said it nevertheless expects that the result will be increased compared to the previous year due to cost reduction , higher revenue and due to growth in online retail . &quot;
&quot; Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said the company produces &quot; solid income , &quot; considering the weaker than expected economic conditions , especially in manufacturing and global trade . &quot;
&quot; the plans for vacation jobs were announced one day later than that of the Ri@@ val U@@ PS , which plans to employ 90@@ .000 to 95@@ .000 additional workers , about the same number as last year . &quot;
&quot; in the quarter , which ended on 31 August , Fed@@ Ex was earning 6@@ 92 million dollars , 6 percent more than in the previous year . &quot;
&quot; earnings per share stood at 2.@@ 42 $ per share , just behind the 2.@@ 44 $ per share , which predicted 12 of Z@@ acks Investment Research analysts predic@@ t . &quot;
sales rose by 5 percent to € 12.@@ 3 billion .
&quot; six of the analysts surv@@ ey@@ ed were 12,@@ 23 billion $ . &quot;
&quot; in recent years , Fed@@ Ex has reported a decline in international priority shipping , which brought sales in its unit express shipment to the stage . &quot;
but the boom in online shopping has increased the results with Fed@@ Ex Ground .
&quot; in the last quarter , sales in the body transport increased by 29 percent , but the operating result was basically flat due to higher costs for larger packages and self insurance . &quot;
&quot; the express unit recorded higher revenue due to higher prices , while the result sank due to higher labor costs in the cargo business . &quot;
&quot; in the after@@ market trade , about an hour before the opening , Fed@@ Ex shares dropped by 3.@@ 85 $ , or 2.5 percent , to 15@@ 0.@@ 15 . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , it closed with 11 percent loss for the year and 17 percent below a record high on June 11 . &quot;
&quot; on their most anticipated conference in the year , Federal Reserve Str@@ at@@ egen spent two days this week sitting around a 27 @-@ foot Honduras @-@ ma@@ ho@@ gan@@ y table to decide whether it is time to raise the lead for the first time for almost a decade . &quot;
&quot; dro@@ pping over them at one end of the decorated , two @-@ story sitting hall is a wall picture of the United States . &quot;
the card is a reminder that the F@@ ed @-@ chairman Jan@@ et L. Y@@ ellen and her colleagues shall put the economic interests of the nation before all the other things .
the central bank has a two @-@ fold mandate from the Congress : to maxim@@ ize the US occupation and prices here stable .
&quot; but since the great recession , the F@@ ed leaders have acknowledged that there is an un@@ written third mandate : financial stability . &quot;
this third mandate could be the X factor in a decision that is too tight to predic@@ t it . it will be announced on Thursday whether the U.S. economy is ready to be we@@ an@@ ed by the un@@ parall@@ eled incen@@ tive by the near @-@ term short @-@ term interest rate since the end of 2008 .
&quot; although most of the data of the economy show that it grows solid , the recent turbul@@ ence on the global financial markets could make the already si@@ ghted F@@ ed representatives anx@@ ious to increase this volati@@ lity by raising interest for federal bonds - and be it only a quarter percentage point . &quot;
&quot; obviously , the labour market and inflation are primarily the most important thing they are watching , &quot; said Lind@@ sey M. Pi@@ eg@@ za , chief econom@@ ist at the bro@@ ker@@ age company Sti@@ fel Nicol@@ aus &amp; Co . &quot;
&quot; but I think if they were looking for a pre@@ text to not increase interest rate , the increased uncertainty around the global market is enough justi@@ fication to continue to wait , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; there is no consensus on what the F@@ ed is doing , which ass@@ ures itself the financial market itself . &quot;
about half of the econom@@ ists who were recently asked by Blo@@ om@@ berg have predicted a rate of interest this week .
&quot; however , the financial markets expect a waiting of the F@@ ed , with a key indicator , which shows only a 30 % chance for an increase . &quot;
&quot; this indicates a decline in the stock market , if the F@@ ed increases the sentence , unless the strateg@@ ists reduce the blow by promise that a further increase is far away . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , the Dow Jones Industrial aver@@ aged 228@@ ,@@ 89 points or 1.4 % to 16,@@ 59@@ 9,@@ 85 . &quot;
&quot; the action was triggered by expectations that the F@@ ed policy maintains the set this week , said John Lon@@ ski , chief econom@@ ist at Moo@@ dy &apos;s Capital Markets Research Group . &quot;
&quot; it would be a surprise if the F@@ ed would raise the sentences at that point , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; if she does , &quot; she would have to go very far in her statement to calm the financial markets , so that she did not get panic . &quot;
&quot; other experts argu@@ ed that interest rate would calm the financial markets , because it would remove the uncertainty about when the F@@ ed will act . &quot;
&quot; one month ago , the F@@ ed seemed good to increase the set by 0.25 percentage points this month , the first small step in a slow intensi@@ fication of monetary conditions which would test the strength of recovery in the United States . &quot;
&quot; Y@@ ellen had said in spring and early summer that this year , despite the complaints of liber@@ als that more economic advance would be required , an increase in the sentence was observ@@ able . &quot;
&quot; although the creation of jobs slow@@ ed in August , the improvement in the labour market was solid this year . &quot;
&quot; the unemployment rate dropped to 5.1 % last month , the lowest for more than seven years and near the level that the F@@ ed sees as full employment . &quot;
wage increases have shown signs of recovery .
&quot; although inflation was constantly below the annual target of 2 % of the central bank , the F@@ ed representatives said that the main reason was the temporary effect of significantly lower oil prices . &quot;
&quot; economy &quot; can handle higher interest rates and needs them because of the tension in the labour market , &quot; said Ian Sh@@ ep@@ her@@ dson , chief econom@@ ist at Pan@@ the@@ on Macro@@ economics . &quot;
but financial markets all over the world gathered together at the end of the month after China re@@ valu@@ ated its currency .
the Dow Jones Industrial A@@ verage value coinci@@ ded in May by more than 16 % among its top ranking as investors feared that a slow@@ down of the Chinese economy would cru@@ m@@ ble global growth .
&quot; the market has recovered somewhat this month , and the Dow is now almost 10 % below May . &quot;
&quot; for the F@@ ed representatives , the market turbul@@ ences affect the complex calculation , when it is to increase interest rates . &quot;
&quot; if the events on the financial markets and the news on the weakness of the Chinese economy had not occurred in the last few weeks , they would attract the re@@ ins at this meeting , &quot; said Stephen D. O@@ lin@@ den , Senior Research Fel@@ low at U@@ C@@ LA Zim@@ an Center for Real Estate and a former member of the US @-@ Bank . &quot;
now he predic@@ ts that she will wait at least one month to get the effect better .
&quot; there is a lot of uncertainty about what the impact on the U.S. economy will be , and there is almost no reliable data describing the developments in China , &quot; said O@@ lin@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; the health of the global economy is none of the main concerns of the F@@ ed , so it should not be included in their decision making . &quot;
&quot; but in the end , the F@@ ed Monetary Authority has become the world . &quot;
the influence of the central bank was enormous in recent years .
&quot; the mere hint of the former director Ben S. Bern@@ anke in 2013 , that the F@@ ed could &quot; narrow &quot; their monetary expansion , dissolved the del@@ u@@ sions around the globe . &quot;
&quot; in a world where markets and economies are increasingly inter@@ tw@@ ined , the F@@ ed representatives can be expected to not only monitor developments elsewhere , but are also advised with other central banks and experts to gain a better understanding of the global economy . &quot;
&quot; her decision @-@ making is &quot; more art than science , &quot; said Zach@@ ary Kar@@ ab@@ ell , Head of the Global Strategy for Property Management of En@@ v@@ est@@ net Inc . &quot;
&quot; Jeff@@ rey L@@ acker , President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Rich@@ mond , VA . , noted this month that &quot; the F@@ ed has a story of transactions on financial market movements , apparently not associated with the economic foundation data . &quot;
&quot; the Federal Open Market Committee , a right @-@ wing member of the Federal Open Market Committee , set up for a rate of interest , made decisions in the years 1998 / 1999 as an example . &quot;
&quot; in Asia , the F@@ ed launched a financial crisis in Asia by 0.@@ 75 percentage points in three sessions , &quot; despite the limited recognis@@ able impact on growth in the US , &quot; said Mr . &quot;
one year later the F@@ ed representatives refused these cuts .
&quot; the F@@ ed should put aspects of financial stability only in the first place during a severe crisis , such as the context of market re@@ unification in 2008 , said Adam S. P@@ osen , former member of the Committee on the Inter@@ est of the Bank of England . &quot;
&quot; the recent turbul@@ ence does not come close to this plane , he said . &quot;
&quot; she certainly does not want to fall into the situation in which she is afraid of placing interest because markets open up , &quot; said P@@ osen , President of Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot;
&quot; the Federal Reserve Act still includes the double mandate and does not mention financial stability , and until this is changed , I don &apos;t think that it should be ahead of time . &quot;
do you need a great Thai market ?
try LA@@ X @-@ C in Chin@@ at@@ own .
&quot; yes , Chin@@ at@@ own &quot;
the market / warehouse was opened in 1997 and is owned by LA@@ X @-@ C Inc .
&quot; LA@@ X @-@ C is often referred to as Thai Cost@@ co and is a Thai wholesale market , which is also sold to the general public . &quot;

Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da : small Leben@@ sh@@ ilfe for refugees
more and more refugees arrive in Germany these days .
&quot; to give you a warm welcome , does not go without the commitment of countless volunteer hel@@ pers . &quot;
also in Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da there are a number of people who support un@@ sel@@ fish asylum seek@@ ers in the city .
Petra and Klaus H@@ eine belong to them .
Petra H@@ eine is a teacher with body and soul .
she still loves to teach her 74 lessons .
every Thursday she is doing it in the asylum seek@@ er home at D@@ ill@@ inger Straße .
&quot; it helps refugees from Syria , Kur@@ dist@@ an , Kosovo and Pakistan to learn the German language . &quot;
&quot; of course , this is a different lesson than at the right school . &quot;
Rio Grande Pap@@ al Society promotes nutrition for healthy breast@@ feeding
the Brazilian pa@@ edi@@ atric organization Spr@@ S tries to educ@@ ate women on shock@@ ing ways how important good nutrition during lac@@ tation is . she does this with the presentation of images of babies who su@@ ck breasts that are painted with represent@@ ations of un@@ healthy foods .
&quot; breast milk consists of a variety of proteins , fats , vitamins and carbohydrates that inf@@ ect all the nutrients they need to build a strong immune system . &quot;
&quot; due to the additional energy requirements , pregnant women and young mothers are advised to increase their daily cal@@ orie intake by about 500 calories per day . &quot;
&quot; however , new research results suggest that a higher cal@@ orie intake is not the only dietary modification that mothers should undertake . &quot;
&quot; a recent study conducted by Robert Water@@ land , Professor at the Bay@@ lor College of Medicine in Texas , showed that a healthy diet of pregnant women actually affects the genes of their babies and protects them from the development of tum@@ ours . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , an un@@ healthy diet of the child can neg@@ atively affect the immune system . &quot;
exceptions for the new Bern@@ rie@@ der Sports Hall
the municipality of Bern@@ ried approved the construction contract for the 2.3 million euros in expensive sports hall .
and he made an exception .
the roof can be fl@@ atten@@ ed for solar installation .
plans for the long @-@ awa@@ ited Turn@@ h@@ building at the Bern@@ rie@@ der sports grounds are progres@@ sing step by step : in the recent communal session the elabor@@ ated construction contract was unanim@@ ously prevented without major discussions .
&quot; previously , the committee had decided to apply for a &quot; &quot; exemp@@ tion &quot; &quot; resp@@ ect@@ ful &quot; &quot; exemp@@ tion &quot; &quot; from the valid development plan , among other things . &quot;
&quot; in the &quot; &quot; exception &quot; &quot; it was about the permit for a special form concerning the roof construction . &quot;
&quot; therefore , a &quot; saddle roof with non @-@ centered first and roof top &quot; should be erected . &quot;
&quot; the planning is the planned use of the roof surface for solar systems : &quot; &quot; this allows us to get a wonderfully large southern roof , &quot; &quot; explained Mayor Josef St@@ eigen@@ berger in the meeting . &quot;
&quot; in the case of &quot; liberation , &quot; in turn , the roof inc@@ lin@@ ation , which was prescribed for energetic reasons - differently than in the development plan - should lie below ten degrees . &quot;
this significantly reduces the volume of the hall .
&quot; &quot; &quot; liberation &quot; &quot; was therefore necessary because the plan for the roof of the roof does not permit &quot; exceptions &quot; - whereby the Bern@@ rie@@ der Municipal Council usually goes rather restric@@ tive in the case of liber@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; in Turn@@ h@@ ello , however , it is not a recur@@ rent project : &quot; we do not create a preced@@ ent , &quot; said St@@ eigen@@ berger . &quot;
the gym hall building at the Sports Centre is a joint project of the municipality and the SV Bern@@ ried .
about 2.3 million euros are calculated at the cost .
subsidies are expected from school and latitude .
&quot; in the next step of the procedure , the building application for the 18 x 36 meters large hall is now presented to the council office for testing . &quot;
clinic Pei@@ sen@@ berg moves to Sch@@ ong@@ au
&quot; the Pei@@ sen@@ berg hospital is scheduled to be closed earlier than planned , namely 2016 . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , Dr. Wilhelm Fischer ( 66 ) becomes new medical director at the Sch@@ ong@@ au Hospital . &quot;
the station as well as the majority of staff move from Pei@@ sen@@ berg to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
&quot; this shows the surprising plans of the hospital GmbH of the county , who confirmed the land@@ lady Andrea J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß . &quot;
&quot; however , a decision about it will meet the Supervisory Board and the meeting on Wednesday , September 23 . &quot;
&quot; if the plans are implemented , then all of the nearly 50 employees would continue to work at the hospital in Pei@@ sen@@ berg . &quot;
the vast majority should move to Sch@@ ong@@ au with Fischer and the further existing interior station .
the rooms are available .
&quot; in Wei@@ l@@ heim , employees who cannot go to Sch@@ ong@@ au are to be offered a workplace in Wei@@ l@@ heim , so J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiss . &quot;
the employees are informed of the plans .
the change was triggered by Dr. Andreas E@@ der who has been a medical director of the Sch@@ ong@@ auer Klinik since the beginning of the year and is now transferred to a private practice in close proximity to the hospital .
&quot; according to J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß , the name &quot; Fischer &quot; came into play with the question of who to pursue after succession , the name &quot; Fischer &quot; came into play , who agreed to take over the management from 1 October and to change his team to Sch@@ ong@@ au . &quot;
&quot; for the house in Sch@@ ong@@ au , this was in every case a &quot; appreciation &quot; and a wi@@ dening of the offer in the field of &quot; internal medicine , &quot; so J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiss . &quot;
Fischer is a specialist for pac@@ em@@ akers and de@@ fibr@@ ill@@ ators .
Sch@@ ong@@ au ( 180 beds ) speci@@ alis@@ es in g@@ astro@@ enter@@ ological diseases on the inside station .
&quot; for the next two years , fisher@@ man with his team is said to be responsible if the Supervisory Board agre@@ es to hold both houses until then next year , the former hospital of the prison , which has more than 35 beds , is to be closed for almost 140 years after almost 140 years . &quot;
&quot; until now , the Land@@ kreis has planned this for 2018 , when the currently running rehabilitation at the Wei@@ l@@ heim Hospital has been completed . &quot;
&quot; J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White , who is also the Chairman of the Supervisory Board , contra@@ sts rum@@ ors that the house , which is owned by the Bundes@@ rat , shall in future be used as accommodation for asylum seek@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; that I do . as it goes on with the real estate , J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White could not say , there are several considerations . &quot;
&quot; currently , there is a short @-@ term care of Car@@ itas and a daily sy@@ chiat@@ ry . &quot;
&quot; what better could not happen to us , such an opportunity does not come again , &quot; said Fischer on the quasi @-@ move to the Le@@ ch , who had been received by the employees &quot; positive and very understanding . &quot; &quot;
&quot; a real perspective for the house where fisher@@ man has been working as a chief doctor for over 30 years , I have not given it . &quot;
he was asked by Sch@@ ong@@ auer &apos;s colleagues to take over the post of the medical director .
&quot; the Pei@@ sen@@ berg hospital ( once 100 beds ) was repeatedly threatened by closing in the past decades , departments were closed , for example surgery and obst@@ et@@ rics . &quot;
the Hand@@ b@@ aller of the Rhein @-@ Neck@@ ar Leu@@ ven are required tonight at the Berg@@ ischen HC today ( 8.@@ 15 pm ) .
&quot; although the championship leader of the Bundes@@ liga in Wuppertal is the clear favourite , there is no reason for arrogan@@ ce . &quot;
&quot; in the past season , the bathing establishments with B@@ HC referred to a painful defeat and have gained something there . &quot;
hun@@ ts with two injured in Pr@@ at@@ au
two tractor drivers have been seriously injured during their ma@@ ize harvest during the afternoon .
&quot; during the ab@@ err@@ ation on a corn field near Pr@@ at@@ au ( district Witt@@ enberg ) , several h@@ unters were in use , as the police hur@@ ried . &quot;
&quot; after a shot of shot , a 63@@ - and a 22 @-@ year @-@ old man suffered severe injuries and were brought to hospitals . &quot;
how exactly it could come to the accident was at first uncle@@ ar .

&quot; in the inter@@ rog@@ ation , the 20 @-@ year @-@ old admitted that the young people were killed and their bodies thrown into a channel in rock@@ enh@@ ausen . &quot;
&quot; a 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate , missing since Saturday , has fallen victim to violent crimes . &quot;
&quot; the cor@@ p@@ se of the young woman was found on Tuesday evening in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen near Kais@@ ers@@ lau@@ tern , as public prosec@@ utor and police reported on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; as indeed suspic@@ ious , a 20 @-@ year @-@ old prisoner was also taken prisoner on the Tuesday evening , according to the indication , and the investig@@ ator led to the discovery site of the cor@@ p@@ se . &quot;
&quot; the 16 @-@ year @-@ old was missing on Sunday morning , after they had not come home on the eve of a visit to an autumn festival in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen . &quot;

refugees need accommodation : study warn against housing short@@ cuts
the location on the German housing market is ten@@ se .
more and more refugees are also looking for an affordable stay .
the pressure on the housing market is growing .
the social housing construction is facing a challenge .
the distribution competitions on the German housing market have long since begun .
&quot; with the coming refugees and job@@ seek@@ ers from the EU , more and more people are pushing for a market that is already over@@ loaded in many big cities . &quot;
they compete with low @-@ income citizens around the last affordable housing .
&quot; in order to meet demand for affordable housing , 400@@ ,000 new units would have to be built every year by 2020 . &quot;
this results in a study commissioned by the Con@@ federation of Municipal Auth@@ orities .
&quot; in comparison , 26@@ 0,000 units are finished this year . &quot;
&quot; thus , 140@@ .000 apartments are missing . &quot;
&quot; after the first three months of their stay , refugees are no longer oblig@@ ated to live as asylum seek@@ ers in a first @-@ term accommodation . &quot;
many come across the housing market and join the long queu@@ es in front of the apartments .
&quot; according to the Federal Statistical Office , however , less than half of all asylum seek@@ ers in the last year lived for rent . &quot;
&quot; however , the negative development of the housing market is not only due to the rising number of refugees . &quot;
the study also makes considerable om@@ is@@ sions in the housing policy of recent years .
&quot; in Germany , a housing defic@@ it is approaching , which is getting bigger from year to year . &quot;
&quot; currently some 7@@ 0,000 units were already missing in the metrop@@ olitan areas , compl@@ ains Matthias Günther , author of the study . &quot;
&quot; therefore , many professionals stayed in big cities not@@ ched in WG @-@ rooms . &quot;
&quot; young adults remained un@@ will@@ ingly longer in the &quot; &quot; Hotel Mama &quot; &quot; because of the F@@ lau@@ te on the housing market . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; to solve the problem , the alliance &quot; Social Housing Construction &quot; proposes a re@@ boot . &quot;
new incen@@ tives are to revi@@ ve the social housing construction .
this could be wai@@ ved on the real estate tax and the land tax for subsidi@@ zed homes can be suspended .
&quot; moreover , according to the alliance , attractive tax de@@ preci@@ ation possibilities are necessary . &quot;
the support programme for refugee shel@@ ters of the Kf@@ W state bank is now well addressed in cities and municipalities .
&quot; a good week after the start of the Monday evening with 184 million euros , more than half of the currently available approximately 300 million euros have been accessed . &quot;
&quot; now , the project could even be increased . &quot;
refugees have free money : Croatia and Slovenia serve cor@@ ridor
&quot; Hungary is practically no longer a transit , since more and more refugees choose the way about Croatia . &quot;
Zagreb announces to grant the transit through Slovenia to the north without hur@@ d@@ les .
but the route is dangerous however .
Croatia wants to communicate with the neighbouring country of Slovenia on the establishment of a cor@@ ridor for refugees .
&quot; I spoke to the Austrian Minister of Foreign Affairs and if necessary , we will organise a cor@@ ridor , &quot; &quot; said Croatian Interior Minister R@@ ank@@ o Ost@@ o@@ j@@ ic . &quot;
Slovenia is located between Croatia and Austria and is already part of the Schengen zone .
the EU country of Croatia is not yet a Schengen country .
&quot; after the de@@ preci@@ ation of the Serbian @-@ Hungarian border , hundreds of refugees have been forced to Croatia to get to Western Europe . &quot;
&quot; 500 people came across the border near T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik , the Croatian television station RT@@ L reports . &quot;
Hungary had sealed its border for refugees on the eve of the day .
&quot; new laws , which came into force on the same day , make redund@@ ant asylum procedures in Hungary virtually unnecessary . &quot;
Croatia wants to let the refugees pass .
&quot; the Croatian Prime Minister Zor@@ an Mil@@ ano@@ vic declared : &quot; they can travel through , and we are preparing for this possibility . &quot;
&quot; these people are there , there are women , children and men who want to live and achieve something . &quot;
&quot; however , there are people who did not want to live in Croatia . &quot;
the Croatian police interven@@ ed in the morning the first refugees on the border of Serbia to the EU neighbouring Croatia .
&quot; most reported media reports from Syria , Iran and Afghanistan . &quot;
they came to the Serbian border town of Si@@ d both by bus and taxi .
immediately after their arrival they would have tried to get on foot over the green border to Croatia .
&quot; at the Croatian @-@ Serbian border , the refugees do not meet border f@@ ences . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , the border strip threat@@ ens other dangers : there are still sharp mines from the Yugosla@@ v civil war in the 1990s . &quot;
mine clearance should now quickly create a secure passage .
&quot; after the closure of the border , no more refugees arrive in Hungary after the closure of the border . &quot;
on Tuesday the police counted 366 im@@ pris@@ oned people .
&quot; just before closing on Monday , it was still 93@@ 80 . &quot;
the new Hungarian laws classi@@ fy the over@@ coming and damage of the border zone as a crime .
in the southern Hungary border town Sz@@ eg@@ ed 35 criminal proceedings were initiated .
the convic@@ ted thre@@ aten det@@ ention sentences of up to five years and the deport@@ ation from the country .
&quot; according to the immigration authority , a total of 94 asylum applications have been set up on Tuesday in the &quot; Tran@@ sit ones &quot; set up on Tuesday , almost all of them - 93 - at the most important transition of R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke . &quot;
among the applicant are 13 families with small children and two elderly people .
on Wednesday morning there were still 40 refugees .
but practically no one has a prospect for granted asylum in Hungary .
&quot; according to Hungarian opinion , Serbia is a &quot; &quot; safe third country &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the rejected asylum seek@@ ers should be de@@ ported there .
&quot; in front of the &quot; transit zone &quot; in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke , only a few hundred refugees gathered . &quot;
in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke workers began to clean up .
&quot; they collected the tr@@ ash , which had left thousands of people in the past weeks at the road@@ side . &quot;
locking lat@@ tices were removed and one of the elevator bearings in the border area was rebuilt .
no one wanted to express itself to the goal of this reconstruction .
&quot; after the closure of the border between Serbia and Hungary , Austria is only a few refugees . &quot;
the country has also strengthened its border controls .
&quot; around 20,000 migrants were still in the country after government declar@@ ations . &quot;
around 1400 people in Salzburg are waiting for the continuation of the journey to Germany .
the train traffic from there to Germany was stopped in the morning at the instruction of German authorities .
in Frei@@ las@@ sing there were regularly smaller groups of refugees on foot .
Mayor of France crossed the border
&quot; we were busy after the Brück@@ en@@ fest on Sunday with the clean @-@ up , as suddenly ten people with travel agents stood at the entrance of the tent , &quot; &quot; says the mayor Alo@@ is Stad@@ ler . &quot;
tourists who wanted to travel by train to Pass@@ au .
&quot; because Germany had surprisingly set rail traffic with Austria on Sunday because of the refugee flow , it was in Wern@@ stein at the end , &quot; &quot; said Stad@@ ler , who immediately offered his help and the border together with two other hel@@ pers and their cars crossed the border into the near Pass@@ au . &quot;
&quot; previously , we have only ta@@ sted the un@@ trusted guests , with j@@ ou@@ reds and drinks . &quot;
&quot; we have said the same , we bring them to Pass@@ au by car . &quot;
&quot; that was of course for us , &quot; said Stad@@ ler in the O@@ Ö@@ N interview . &quot;
they were very grateful .
a man didn &apos;t let him take a generous donation - 100 Euro for the fire bri@@ g@@ ade .
&quot; this made us very happy , &quot; &quot; said Stad@@ ler . &quot;
&quot; the str@@ anded train passengers had moved from an ICE into a regional train towards Pass@@ au on Sunday evening in Wels , in order for the short notice that the rail traffic was set to Germany , but to try again over the border . &quot;
&quot; the regional train , however , was completed before the landmark in Wern@@ stein at the Inn . &quot;
&quot; in Wern@@ stein , the cross @-@ border crossing is generally high in the course . &quot;
&quot; the Brück@@ en@@ fest association with the Bavarian neighb@@ ors closed on Sunday , day before a second bridge sporting - organized by the Union of Wern@@ stein and Bayern from Neu@@ kirchen . &quot;
that Viktor Or@@ b@@ án sends further Z@@ ig@@ enia to us is a logical result of a hypo@@ critical policy :
&quot; instead of helping in the camp of R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke immediately in the establishment of structures that ensure humanity , our chan@@ cell@@ or has officially inaugurated the position of the Hungarian government in the Dun@@ st@@ bin of National Socialism . &quot;
&quot; sorry , this entry is only available in Deutsch . &quot;
&quot; also the refugees will have to find that the &quot; &quot; Pro@@ mis@@ ed Land &quot; , &quot; which she invited and welcomed , is nothing but another refugee camp . &quot;
&quot; it will be a great challenge , in the face of the ongoing refugee streams and the approaching winter , to produce decent conditions for protective seek@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; and it will be an even greater - peace , security and stability in Austria . &quot;
Konrad in search of 35@@ .000 winter@@ proof quartz
&quot; with the provision of refugees , Konrad has all hands to do . &quot;
Christian Konrad is used to his word weight .
the government has used the earlier powerful Rai@@ ff@@ eisen ban@@ ker to place lod@@ gings for thousands of refugees .
Konrad has already been able to get a grip on the chaos at Tra@@ is@@ kirchen .
&quot; we have no hom@@ eless more in Tra@@ is@@ kirchen , &quot; he reported about his first success . &quot;
&quot; also the placing of 20,000 refugees , who came to Austria on Monday , was without major vor@@ tices , said Konrad and praised the organisational &quot; master@@ performance . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the Ministry of Interior , on the other hand , spoke of a &quot; crisis @-@ like situation . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in total , Konrad expects about 8@@ 5,000 quar@@ ts in the he@@ ur@@ ling year . &quot;
&quot; in order to meet the number , 35@@ ,000 accommodation units have to be found in the next few weeks - 20,000 should provide the countries , 15@@ ,000 the federal government . &quot;
&quot; should there be more refugees , we can do it . &quot;
&quot; but it is not a barrel without a floor , &quot; said Konrad . &quot;
he has already held talks with the provincial captains .
&quot; they would have assured him , even for the coming refugees lod@@ gings . &quot;
&quot; in Upper Austria it works well , &quot; &quot; said Ferry Mai@@ er . &quot;
the former VP @-@ Mand@@ ala supports Konrad .
there will be a meeting with Cardinal Christoph Schön@@ born to clarify how the Church will help .
&quot; great expectations of the Asyl@@ um Co@@ ordin@@ ator also apply to the OR@@ F action &quot; &quot; Hel@@ ps as we . &quot; &quot; &quot;
private persons can be easily accommod@@ ated on the platform .
&quot; in addition , one hopes for hotels that stand empty in winter . &quot;
&quot; yesterday , Konrad and Mai@@ er critic@@ ised the standards for accommodation as &quot; very high . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in times of emergency , it cannot be that Qu@@ arti@@ er@@ ers have to hold a certain amount of the towel holder or the size of the overhead . &quot;
&quot; for a temporary period of time , &quot; &quot; emergency standards &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in contrast to the Ministry of Interior at placing more successful , Konrad is based on his experience . &quot;
&quot; I am an older gent@@ leman , whom one does not speak without further into the face of fal@@ seh@@ ood . &quot;
belief power is its most important weapon .
Konrad and Mai@@ er do not cause any costs to the Republic as they explained themselves .
they want to increase their number of employees to three to four .
the own Qu@@ arti@@ er@@ suche was not yet successful .
Konrad then wanted to place a container at the Steph@@ an@@ splatz as an office .
but there are apparently problems with permission .
Linz demands a better distribution
&quot; first , no opening of municipal sports halls and other buildings such as tips @-@ Arena and Design Center for housing of refugees is planning the city of Linz . &quot;
&quot; this is not necessary at the moment , as the persons concerned are currently unable to submit these measures , says mayor Klaus L@@ ug@@ er ( SP ) . &quot;
&quot; however , for emer@@ gen@@ cies , other locations should be examined for their suitability . &quot;
the City chief critic@@ ises the distribution of refugees within the federal state .
other districts also need to make their contribution .
&quot; seals : &quot; &quot; borders are not sealed &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; in a longer telephone conversation with the Bavarian prime minister Horst Seeh@@ o@@ fer ( CS@@ U ) , Landes@@ haupt@@ mann Josef P@@ ühr@@ inger ( VP ) presented the further procedure in the refugee problem on Monday . &quot;
Seeh@@ o@@ fer assured me that the German borders were not sealed off .
the further journey of refugees to the Federal Republic of Germany remains possible .
&quot; however , there is now the corresponding border controls . &quot;
there will be no more special trains with refugees to Germany .
&quot; however , the seek@@ ers would be brought to Germany with regular trains . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; from the other EU member states , P@@ ühr@@ inger once again called for increased solidarity in the refugee issue . &quot;
the fact that Austria once again introduces controls is for P@@ ühr@@ inger &quot; a logical consequence &quot; from the German action .
the next Run@@ t@@ astic is a matter of time
&quot; the general renovation of the &quot; &quot; New Wer@@ ft &quot; &quot; in the Lin@@ zer industrial line is officially completed . &quot;
&quot; in four of the six floors of the office and production building , the listed IT Group is re@@ trac@@ ted S &amp; T , the rest ( 2700 square meter ) is to be rented to young , innovative companies from the technology sector . &quot;
&quot; in IT the intelligent minds are our raw material - and we must try to work for us , &quot; says S &amp; T boss Hannes Nieder@@ haus@@ er . &quot;
&quot; he could imagine investing in startup companies of the new yard , and later on which to acquire . &quot;
&quot; from the very beginning , S &amp; T wants to cooperate with the new neighbours - what Nieder@@ haus@@ er promises some promises : &quot; the next Run@@ t@@ astic is just a matter of time . &quot;
&quot; 1.7 million euros were invested by S &amp; T in the site , 3.3 million euros from the Tech@@ Center , which belongs to one third of the city of Linz , the country Upper Austria and the Bund ( FF@@ G ) . &quot;
the building is le@@ ased by the Linz AG for 60 years at S &amp; T and Tech@@ Center .
&quot; 30 percent of the 2700 square meters remaining area in the building are already rented , for another 40 percent there are requests . &quot;
Li@@ a @-@ Per@@ oni @-@ In@@ hab@@ erin opened second shop in the arcade
&quot; in the new shop , Fur@@ la hand@@ bags are at the centre of attention . &quot;
&quot; actually , Jutta Br@@ eit wanted to get a dog . &quot;
&quot; this project had to post@@ p@@ one the 49 @-@ year @-@ old bear@@ er of Li@@ a Per@@ oni in the Tau@@ ben@@ markt @-@ arcade : after all , it has now gained incre@@ ment in the form of another business location . &quot;
&quot; in the Fur@@ la @-@ Shop against the business in which they sell bags , suit@@ cases , shoes and garments from different manufacturers , now everything revol@@ ves around ladies &apos; hand@@ bags of the brand Fur@@ la , pur@@ ses are starting at 75 euros . &quot;
larger bags and accessories cost up to € 500 .
the new shop has been in operation since yesterday .
&quot; before , several weeks were rebuilt . &quot;
&quot; but I have long wonder@@ ed if I should open a shop , &quot; &quot; says Br@@ eit . &quot;
&quot; among other things , the decision was , among other things , that Fur@@ la producers who were at home in Bologna from the idea of their own place where only their hand@@ bags were sold . &quot;
&quot; we are the only ones in the Greater Linz , who sell this brand , &quot; says the mother of two daughters who own Italian roots . &quot;
her fashion interest has given birth from her mother to the cra@@ dle .
I like the most when something develops and I can show new trends at affordable prices .
why so some woman is looking at a beautiful hand@@ bag in rap@@ ture can also not be answered with last certainty .
maybe it is because a beautiful bag is recycled every outfit .
the Br@@ unch Jesu@@ it from K@@ all@@ stadt
the Pf@@ äl@@ zer ancestors of Donald Tru@@ mp arrived from a place whose inhabitants are called An@@ ders .
this property also combines some with the billi@@ on@@ aire who wants to become US president .
Donald Tru@@ mp ( 69 ) is always good for excitement .
&quot; whether he is alien@@ ated from alien@@ ating , journalist , or knowledge gaps in international crisis policies reveals - the applicant for the US Pres@@ idential Office vigor@@ ously boo@@ sts the election campaign . &quot;
and cut off well .
&quot; this is also registered in the Pal@@ at@@ inate K@@ all@@ stadt , where the grand@@ parents of the real estate milli@@ on@@ aire come from . &quot;
the New Yorker with the fo@@ er hair@@ style is a term many in the Win@@ zer@@ dorf on the wine route .
some in the 1200 inhabitants village is related to him over -@@ ty corners .
&quot; his grand@@ father came from K@@ all@@ stadt in the Pal@@ at@@ inate : Donald Tru@@ mp , here in the election campaign mode . &quot;
the K@@ all@@ städ@@ ter Simone Wen@@ del made a film about Tru@@ mp .
and what do the vill@@ agers think of being the most powerful man in the world ?
&quot; I think they find it somehow exciting , but are not so deeply impressed in their K@@ all@@ stad@@ ter style , &quot; says Simone Wen@@ del . &quot;
&quot; the native K@@ all@@ städ@@ ter has shot an am@@ using documentary about the place and its famous offspring , to which beside Tru@@ mp also the K@@ et@@ ch@@ up family Heinz counts . &quot;
&quot; Tru@@ mp , who is not known for mo@@ dest@@ y , comes in &quot; Kings of K@@ all@@ stadt &quot; ( 2014 ) too - so with the statement that he would certainly be successful if he would live in K@@ all@@ stadt . &quot;
he has not brought it to the king of the heart .
&quot; indeed , respect for the performance of the family , but also tend to believe that Tru@@ mp is already a bit a big mouth , &quot; says Wen@@ del . &quot;
&quot; coinci@@ dentally , the nick@@ name , the K@@ all@@ stadt in the circum@@ ference , &quot; Die Br@@ ull@@ jes@@ macher &quot; - zu Hoch@@ deutsch : the don@@ or , says it . &quot;
&quot; thus , Tru@@ mp comes from the village of the An@@ ders . &quot;
the Tru@@ mp &apos;s success story began in 1885 when the later grand@@ father emig@@ rated and opened a pub for gold dig@@ gers in the USA .
the cor@@ nerst@@ one of the real estate company were first real estate sales in New York .
&quot; but the life of grand@@ parents was not free of tragedy : their desire to return to their homeland in the long run , failed in the Bavarian state , to which the Pal@@ at@@ inate was back then . &quot;
&quot; he did not record Tru@@ mp because he was once abandoned without permission , the director of the Institute for Pal@@ at@@ inate History and Volk@@ sk@@ unde , Roland Paul , declared the start of the film . &quot;
Tru@@ mp is the grand@@ son of an &quot; illegal emig@@ rant . &quot;
this contra@@ sts with the sometimes marked claims of the descendants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he had repeatedly talked about Mexican immigrants in the US and demanded the construction of a border wall to deter illegal immigrants . &quot;
&quot; as the pol@@ ed , this is not so sympath@@ etic , &quot; says Hans @-@ Joachim Ben@@ der , a distant relative Tru@@ mps ( &quot; The O@@ ma was a born Tru@@ mp , the grand@@ pa was born Heinz &quot; ) . &quot;
&quot; the Win@@ emaker , retired , sees the American rather dist@@ anced , &quot; he is always so br@@ ac@@ ing . &quot;
does he believe that Tru@@ mp is coming ?
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine that , &quot; says the 72 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;
&quot; he never took care of K@@ all@@ stadt . &quot;
&quot; the Pen@@ sion@@ vor@@ tices Ver@@ oni@@ ka Sch@@ ramm , as mentioned in some K@@ all@@ stad@@ ters , that a descend@@ ant of the Heinz family did a visit something for the church organ , which was generally well anch@@ ored . &quot;
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine that from Donald , &quot; says the 68 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;
&quot; it would be better if he does not cur@@ b the choice , for &quot; he has such radical views , I don &apos;t know if that is good . &quot;
&quot; if those who had been wearing the s@@ ages at the time of his grand@@ father in the United States would have been like he , &quot; he would never have arrived there . &quot; &quot;
&quot; there are more interesting topics than him , &quot; says Win@@ zer@@ to@@ chter Sarah Büh@@ ler . &quot;
and as President ?
&quot; my President is not , &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; and : &quot; &quot; the grapes are ripe without the President Tru@@ mp . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Wend@@ els Film , for whom Tru@@ mp was long inter@@ viewed , have seen 12 000 cinem@@ as , even in the USA the interest awak@@ ens . &quot;
&quot; the Upper Bavaria community of Ram@@ s@@ au near Ber@@ cht@@ es@@ g@@ aden is Germany &apos;s first &quot; &quot; mountain@@ e@@ ering village &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; from the hand of the vice @-@ president at the German Alpine Club , Ludwig Wu@@ cher@@ pf@@ en@@ nig , the 1800 inhabitants village in the Ber@@ cht@@ es@@ g@@ aden National Park received the award for gentle tourism on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; in Austria , there are already 20 &quot; mountain@@ e@@ ering villages . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in the neighbouring country , the local Alpine Club is responsible for awar@@ ding the award . &quot;
&quot; a &quot; &quot; mountain@@ e@@ ering village &quot; &quot; may have a maximum of 2,500 inhabitants . &quot;
at least one fifth of its area must be exp@@ elled as a reserve .
seven &apos;s Sun@@ rise domin@@ ates the reviews despite attempts by N@@ ine to take over the loss of leadership at the Today Show
&quot; Karl Stef@@ ano@@ vic and Lisa Wil@@ kin@@ son ha@@ sten to Can@@ ber@@ ra to report on the loss of the liber@@ als leadership , but there has been no major shifts in the ratings for today . &quot;
&quot; the breakfast show from N@@ ine was aired by the federal capital , when Mal@@ col@@ m Turn@@ bull made the fall of Tony Ab@@ bot@@ t . &quot;
&quot; the ri@@ val Sun@@ rise , with the present@@ ers David Koch and Sam@@ an@@ tha Ar@@ my@@ tage , was part of a week @-@ long series of international television broad@@ casts , including Dubai , New York , Ni@@ ag@@ ara Falls and Can@@ cu@@ n . &quot;
&quot; this det@@ ri@@ mental dis@@ advantage seemed to play no role for Australian TV viewers , as Sun@@ rise claimed 39@@ 7,@@ 000 viewers in the five capitals , compared to today 3@@ 39@@ ,000 . &quot;
&quot; today a slight increase compared to the ratings for Monday ( 3@@ 17@@ ,000 ) and last Tuesday ( 28@@ 3,000 ) , but its number remained behind last Thursday ( 34@@ 3,000 ) . &quot;
today the gap of sunrise has closed in the last months .
&quot; in August Today , it reached an average of 3@@ 18@@ ,000 in comparison to the 330@@ ,000 of Sun@@ rise . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the year , the distance ran between 4@@ 0,000 and 50,000 . &quot;
&quot; so far in September , Sun@@ rise stands at 3@@ 49@@ ,000 viewers at 3@@ 14@@ ,000 in Today . &quot;
this is the most interesting thing that happens every morning .
the winds of change concern these morning people more than the parliament !
&quot; Karl and Lisa are fine , thanks for the review ! &quot;

the great news for Seven was the impressive debut of 800 words with the former serial line of Pack@@ ed to the Raf@@ ters Erik Thom@@ son .
&quot; the new drama on a recently wit@@ ched father , who decides to settle down with his two children on the coast of New Zealand , reached a very impressive figure of 1.@@ 219 million viewers . &quot;
critics had wonder@@ ed if Thom@@ son was able to wear a hit show solo without the Raf@@ ters Star Rebecca Gi@@ b@@ ney .
&quot; the result of yesterday evening answered this with a clear &quot; &quot; Yes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the X @-@ Factor of Seven remained strong with 1,@@ 136 million viewers and beat The Block ( 8@@ 38@@ ,000 ) and T@@ BL Famili@@ es ( 7@@ 26@@ ,000 ) . &quot;
seven had mixed results in the evening two of The Ch@@ ase Australia .
&quot; the first half hour ( 17 : 00 to 17 : 30 ) of the new qui@@ z show , moder@@ ated by Andrew O &apos;@@ Ke@@ ef@@ e showed an average of 4@@ 46@@ ,000 spectators . &quot;
&quot; the second half hour ( 17 : 30 to 18 : 00 ) j@@ ump@@ ed to 6@@ 23@@ ,000 spectators - enough for a small victory over Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ires Hot @-@ Seat ( 6@@ 13@@ ,000 ) . &quot;
&quot; on Monday evening the first half hour of The Ch@@ ase Australia achieved 5@@ 20,000 spectators and in the second half hour of 7@@ 20,000 . &quot;
&quot; hot @-@ Seat on average 6@@ 20,000 . &quot;
the decline in the quot@@ as of the second evening of The Ch@@ ase Australia will be confident that hot @-@ seat will ultimately prevail at 17 : 30 .

the last three agree : Bachelor &apos;s Sam Wood is the perfect man - but whom will he choose ?
secret revealed ? ...
&quot; Lana Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows , Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki have possibly unknow@@ ingly revealed who The Bachelor wins . &quot;
&quot; the woman , at the Sam Wood , finally landed in The Bachelor , was sh@@ rou@@ ded in greatest sec@@ rec@@ y . &quot;
and none of the three remaining girls will certainly not reveal whether she is the one who received the last rose .
&quot; but when we checked with Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay , S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki and Lana Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows on the day before coming out of three two , you may be acci@@ dentally given a hint about who will be the winner . &quot;
Sam Wood keeps his lips sealed until the final on Thursday
&quot; all three women have ly@@ rical ways out in ly@@ ric ways , why Wood is the perfect man and called his sense of hum@@ our , am@@ bition , family values and positive attitude as reasons for why they like to be his partner . &quot;
&quot; however , when the question is asked &quot; If not you who should receive W@@ oods last rose ? , &quot; their answers could become a game of play , who won the heart of the b@@ achel@@ or . &quot;
Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows and Mark@@ os@@ ki both quickly called them - except themselves - M@@ ack@@ ay as the best partner for wood .
&quot; from the first day , Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and Sam Wood have had a simple relationship with each other . &quot;
&quot; from the moment when I went to the house and realized Sam@@ s energies , I felt that they were pretty compatible and I thought it all over the show , &quot; said Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows . &quot;
&quot; Sarah is standing on Earth with both feet , it &apos;s so much fun to be together with her , &quot; &quot; said Mark@@ os@@ ki . &quot;
I have seen them together and they have the right chemistry .
they feel comfortable and comfortable together .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay believes she and Sam Wood are well suited as a couple .
&quot; from her point of view , M@@ ack@@ ay said that last week &apos;s visit made her clear that Wood &quot; &quot; One &quot; &quot; could be . &quot;
&quot; as soon as I saw him with my friends and family , it became clear to me that this is obviously not just a game - I am now un@@ reserv@@ edly set to him , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; and when she was asked who Wood should choose , if not she , she was pu@@ zz@@ ling . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t know if I can say that , &quot; she said . &quot;
I love the remaining girls in equal measure - it is a draw between S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana and Lana .
&quot; the b@@ achel@@ or &apos;s b@@ achel@@ or will be broadcast on Wednesday , 7.@@ 30 pm . &quot;

Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne had several options to start his N@@ FL career .
Detroit and Seattle showed great interest after moving to the USA - and there were many other teams who sent requests following his impressive open training day at the end of last year .
but Hay@@ ne chose the San Francisco 49@@ ers and trainer Jim Tom@@ s@@ ula and it looks like a wise decision .
some trainers would have ban@@ ished Hay@@ ne for the rest of the game to the bank when he lost a don@@ ka as it did the Aus@@ sie @-@ Rugby @-@ Liga @-@ conver@@ ti@@ t at his first p@@ unt @-@ return on Tuesday at the 20 @-@ 3 victory against Minn@@ es@@ ota .
but Tom@@ s@@ ula confi@@ ded to his husband and gave Hay@@ ne the next opportunity to a p@@ unt return and also in the running game after a violation of Reg@@ gie Bush .
Tom@@ s@@ ula still showed his true face in the locker room after the game .
&quot; instead of grinding his ro@@ ok@@ ies before the rest of the team through the mill , he encouraged them . &quot;
Tom@@ s@@ ula strengthened Hay@@ ne publicly at his press conference after the game .
49@@ ers Spor@@ tre@@ por@@ ter Cam In@@ man reported that Hay@@ ne was also encouraged by special team coordin@@ ator Thomas Mc@@ Gau@@ gh@@ ey who advised him to forget his p@@ inch catch and to take care of the next game .
Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne p@@ atz@@ t at a p@@ unt restored in the first playing quarter of the Minn@@ es@@ ota Vi@@ kings
it was certainly not the start that Hay@@ ne and his massive Australian affili@@ ation had hoped for his N@@ FL debut .
&quot; Hay@@ ne left the playing field after the F@@ um@@ ble and later told the Australian Radio Duo Ham@@ ish &amp; Andy on 2@@ Day@@ FM 10@@ 4.1 , that he couldn &apos;t imagine a worse start to his N@@ FL career , &quot;
&quot; this was a thing that happens now , you just take care of the next game , and that &apos;s it , &quot; &quot; Hay@@ ne said . &quot;
Hay@@ ne compared the Schn@@ itzer with his Orig@@ in debut back in 2007 when a pass at his own in @-@ Goal area led to a Tr@@ y for Que@@ ens@@ land .
&quot; overall , it was a great experience for the 27 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;

the free vot@@ ers demand the recru@@ itment of 1000 new teachers in Bavaria because of the high number of refugees .
&quot; at the beginning of the F@@ W autumn clas@@ h in Groß@@ wall@@ stadt , party and fac@@ tional leader Hubert Ai@@ wan@@ ger warned of a serious crisis in Bavaria &apos;s schools , if there were no corresponding new teachers for the many new students : &quot; we need at least 1000 additional teachers to keep schools in front of collapse , &quot; said Ai@@ v@@ wan@@ ger . &quot;
&quot; otherwise we will get recru@@ itment in the Bavarian education system . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Wednesday , 18.@@ Febru@@ ary@@ 2016 You are not logged in ... &#91; Log In &#93; &quot;
&quot; actually , quite different main themes were planned . &quot;
but the record number of refugees now domin@@ ates the free vot@@ er meeting .
&quot; of course , the topic of asylum will transfer the c@@ law , &quot; said Ai@@ v@@ wan@@ ger . &quot;
&quot; Ai@@ v@@ wan@@ ger called for the establishment of UN protection zones for refugees in Syria , as reported during the Yugoslavia &apos;s wars during the n@@ ine@@ ties . &quot;
&quot; so it &apos;s not going on , we have to go to the causes , &quot; said the Free vot@@ er boss . &quot;
rejected asylum seek@@ ers want to post@@ p@@ one free vot@@ ers as soon as possible .
&quot; that is why Ai@@ v@@ ans also requested more staff responsible for administrative courts , which are responsible for asylum seek@@ ers : &quot; we also need at least 50 new asylum seek@@ ers , &quot; said Ai@@ v@@ wan@@ ger . &quot;
the F@@ W boss cri@@ tici@@ zed that several federal states were not consistent : &quot; we need nation@@ wide uniform standards for federal states . &quot;
&quot; Bayern moves away , others not . &quot;
&quot; we need to become emp@@ athy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; however , national politics in the city of Groß@@ stadt shouldn &apos;t fall under the table . &quot;
a long @-@ term long @-@ term tor@@ ch remains on the agenda : the education policy .
&quot; for the new school year , the Minister of Education Ludwig Sp@@ a@@ en@@ le ( CS@@ U ) started the pilot test &quot; &quot; intermediate level plus &quot; &quot; in which an extension of the gymn@@ asi@@ onal center stage of three to four years has been tested - in the result it takes nine years to finish . &quot;
but that is not far enough .
&quot; the topic G@@ 9 has to be accelerated , &quot; said the F@@ W boss . &quot;
we call for freedom of choice for all gymn@@ asi@@ ons who want this .
free travel at G@@ 9 wherever you want .

4 people killed after police killed rubber missi@@ les on demonstr@@ ators in Nepal
&quot; four people , including a 4 @-@ year @-@ old boy , were killed in southern Nepal after the police kno@@ cked rubber floors into a crowd that demonstrated against the proposed new constitution , a civil servant said on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; the violence broke out on Tuesday evening in the District of Rup@@ an@@ de@@ hi , about 175 miles west of the capital Kath@@ mandu . &quot;
&quot; B@@ ish@@ nu Pr@@ as@@ ad Dh@@ ak@@ al , chief district officer , said that more than 1,000 demonstr@@ ators had gathered outside a police station , some of them threw stones and fire bombs . &quot;
Mr Dh@@ ak@@ al said the police have used tear gas and then shot into the air before moving to rubber missi@@ les .
&quot; 20 police officers and five civilians were injured , he said . &quot;
&quot; it was not immediately clear why the used rubber shells , known to them that they can kill , are traditionally used as a less deadly alternative , apparently produced such a high rate of death . &quot;
&quot; the debate was the last in weeks of violent protests in Nepal &apos;s southern pl@@ ains , where members of the ethnic group of the M@@ oll@@ i say that new provinces being formed within the proposed new constitution would reduce their political influence . &quot;
there were also protests in the Western Nepal by the ethnic group of the Th@@ arus who want their own state .
&quot; at least 40 people , including 11 police officers , have been in violent clas@@ hes since the 10th . &quot;
&quot; killed in August when the four major political parties signed an agreement to divide the country into provinces - an important step towards a new constitution , but a very controversial subject in Nepal , which has been centrally governed for centuries . &quot;
&quot; working on a new constitution is on its way since 2008 , but the legisl@@ ature accelerated the process after the devast@@ ating earthquake that killed thousands of people in April . &quot;
&quot; the legisl@@ ature voted on certain cl@@ auses in the constitutional draft in Kath@@ mandu this week , and officials said that the new constitution could enter into force on Sunday . &quot;
construction area planned in the city
the property at Em@@ den Jugend@@ zentrum Alte Post is to be rebuilt .
the city is currently preparing everything for the marketing of the 4,000 square meters area . &quot;
&quot; a mix of trade , trade and living - concrete offers are not yet available . &quot;
Em@@ den - The city of Em@@ den wants to market a 4000 square metre plot in direct neighbourhood to the Jugend@@ zentrum Alte Post .
the preparations for this are underway .
&quot; it is planned to use the terrain for a mix of trade , commercial and residential . &quot;
&quot; waiting for appropriate offers , it is said on the part of the city . &quot;
which investor is in demand is not yet clear .
&quot; accordingly , no contracts were signed . &quot;
&quot; the city of Em@@ den had a part of the plot , which is located on the Ring@@ straße / Ecke Great Boulevard , already bought a few months ago and the building had to be torn down . &quot;
project H@@ ieve : details are on the table
the plant@@ ations to the cottage settlement on the Little Sea near Em@@ den take shape .
the investor presented publicly plans for the project for the first time .
several semi @-@ tra@@ ilers are further wor@@ rying - they fear the sale of their am@@ us@@ ement refuge
&quot; months ago , behind closed doors was negoti@@ ated , dim@@ pled , deb@@ ated and drawn . &quot;
now the plans for a new holiday settlement on the small seaside resort near Em@@ den on the table .
&quot; the interest , the medium @-@ sized Em@@ den company &quot; System @-@ Bau , &quot; presented its plans for the first time on Monday evening in the Em@@ de Council city development committee . &quot;
&quot; originally , this point had stood on the non @-@ public part of the agenda . &quot;
&quot; under the pressure of the project critic and the F@@ DP parliamentary group , who repro@@ ached the investors and the administration of sec@@ rec@@ y , Ralf Be@@ hr@@ ends went to the offensive : &quot; we have not yet answered all questions , &quot; he said before the Council members and more than 50 visitors . &quot;
but it was good to meet all rum@@ ors now .
&quot; for months , the project has been in discussion about ten to twelve million euros . &quot;
&quot; hef@@ ty reactions among the land@@ lords who had come into the meeting , called out the pictures and new details on the desired hotel building . &quot;
&quot; Roberto Schulz , land@@ bu@@ ke owner and board member representing the advoc@@ acy of the An@@ lieg@@ er , Pro H@@ ieve , compl@@ ains : &quot; this is a giant cl@@ ot@@ z that over@@ looks all other buildings . &quot;
&quot; in addition , he feared like a number of other project critics that the traffic was greatly increased by the intended size of the plant : &quot; there must be whole bus loads , so that it expects , &quot; says Schulz &quot;
&quot; what happens exactly on the estate of the former inn , however , is still open . &quot;
nor is there any operator .
&quot; first we have to have a coher@@ ent concept , &quot; said Ralf Be@@ hr@@ ends . &quot;
&quot; because this still lack@@ ed , the development plans are still variable . &quot;

Google starts dou@@ bling campaign campaign to collect 11 million $ for refugees
&quot; Google Inc ( Goo@@ gl . O ) announced a dou@@ bling campaign calling for humanitarian organizations to help thousands of refugees , as they flee from war ri@@ pped and im@@ pover@@ ished countries . &quot;
Google has an un@@ usually personal approach to announc@@ ing the donation call on his blog .
&quot; instead of making a manager the announcement , Rita Mas@@ oud , a Google employee who fled with her family from Kab@@ ul , wrote about her personal experiences seven years old . &quot;
&quot; our journey included many dark railway and bus trips , as well as hunger , thirst , cold and fear , &quot; she wrote . &quot;
I was lucky .
&quot; but since the refugee and migrants crisis has grown in Europe , many people like my family are des@@ per@@ ately looking for help . &quot;
&quot; donations go to four non @-@ profit organisations providing assistance to refugees and migrants : doctors Without Bor@@ ders , International Res@@ cue Committee , Save the Children and UN High Commissioner for Refu@@ ge@@ es . &quot;
&quot; Google said that the first global funds raised , up to a value of EUR 5.5 million , have doubled to $ 11 million . &quot;
&quot; Europe is faced with its worst refugee crisis since World War II , largely caused by the four @-@ year civil war in Syria , which has driven more than 4 million people this year . &quot;
&quot; many also escaped from the war torn by war , Yemen , Iraq and Libya . &quot;

weight loss surgery can be helpful for easily over@@ weight di@@ abe@@ tics .
the benefits of weight loss surgery for easily over@@ weight people with type 2 diabetes may last at least five years after a new study .
it is still too early to tell if easily over@@ weight people with diabetes after weight loss surgery live longer than those who receive non @-@ surgical treatments .
&quot; mort@@ ality data needs a long time to show something , &quot; said Dr. Robin Black@@ stone , an expert of weight loss surgery , who wrote a leading article on the new study in J@@ AMA Surgery . &quot;
&quot; weight loss surgery or o@@ besity surgery , use various methods to reduce the size of stomach . &quot;
they reduce hunger and limit the body &apos;s ability to absorb food .
&quot; over the years , o@@ besity has proven to be effective in the treatment of type 2 diabetes , but most of the studies have been performed in people who are path@@ ologically o@@ bes@@ e with a Body Mass Index ( BM@@ I ) of 35 or higher . &quot;
&quot; BM@@ I , a certain amount of weight in terms of size , is regarded as normal between 18.5 and 24.@@ 9 . &quot;
a BM@@ I of 25 or more indicates that someone is over@@ weight and people with a BM@@ I over 30 are considered o@@ bes@@ e .
you can calculate your BM@@ I here : 1.@@ us@@ a.@@ gov / 1@@ D@@ 0@@ Z@@ q@@ D@@ v .
&quot; for the new study , researchers from Tai@@ w@@ ans Min @-@ Sh@@ eng General Hospital , which have been gathered in a study since 2007 , compare two types of o@@ besity - gast@@ ric b@@ ypass and gast@@ ric tu@@ bing - to medical treatments for type 2 diabetes in people who were easily over@@ weight . &quot;
&quot; the average BM@@ I below those who undergo this surgery fell from 31 to 24,@@ 5 to the end of the fifth year in this study . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , the BM@@ I was among those who received non @-@ surgical diabetes treatment roughly equal to 29 . &quot;
&quot; under those who undergo a surgical procedure , 36 % of the Diabetes disease dis@@ sol@@ ves completely and at 28 % in part . &quot;
&quot; in the medical @-@ treated group , in comparison , diabetes was completely dissolved by only one percent and partially at only about two percent . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the results were better in the control of blood pressure , tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des and the &quot; bad &quot; L@@ DL Cholester@@ ins &quot; generally better in the &apos; surgical &apos; group , the authors found out . &quot;
the researchers also monitored the patient blood level of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c which reflects blood glucose levels over time .
&quot; hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c is best kept below 7 percent , write the researchers . &quot;
&quot; after the operation , the average ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in fell from around 9 percent to around 6 percent . &quot;
&quot; however , in the medical therapy group , it remained stable at around 8 percent . &quot;
&quot; but this better &quot; gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control &quot; - as reflected in the improved hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c level - did not reduce mort@@ ality in five years , so the leading researcher Dr. Chi@@ h @-@ Ch@@ eng H@@ su and his colleagues . &quot;
the research team also provides average results in the two types of surgery .
&quot; in the fifth year , the b@@ ypass surgery group lost more weight compared to the Gast@@ re@@ kt@@ omy group ( 18.@@ 7 vs. 14.@@ 2 kg ) , reaching bigger returns in the BM@@ I ( 7.1 % vs. 2.1 % ) and had a complete over@@ coming of diabetes ( 46.@@ 9 % vs. 16.@@ 7 % ) . &quot;
&quot; while the new study does not show survival benefit of the surgery after five years , there is evidence from a study of he@@ avier people in Sweden that surgery leads to a longer life , says Black@@ stone from the University of Arizona , College of Medicine Phoenix . &quot;
&quot; in the Swedish study it was in o@@ bes@@ e people who undergo an o@@ besity @-@ operation , about 29 percent less likely to die over the course of 15 years - compared to a group that tried more conventional methods . &quot;
&quot; although the new study showed no advantage for survival in the surgery patients , Black@@ stone said it was reas@@ sured for persons with a BM@@ I under 35 who are interested in the procedure . &quot;
&quot; this is the critical point of this study because it says that this operation is lower in this lower BM@@ I group , &quot; without increased risk of death or kidney disease , she said . &quot;
Black@@ stone added that people and their doctors should start taking weight seriously once the patient with his BM@@ I is between 27 and 30 .
&quot; I think we are waiting for too long until we bring people to take this seriously , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; I think that as soon as they have accumulated these genetic changes , which have firmly joined their bodies with o@@ besity and diabetes , a revers@@ al is really hard . &quot;
love story plays in the H@@ uns@@ r@@ ück
&quot; it is an issue that is increasingly important in fiction : a young woman , at school times un@@ popular and un@@ si@@ ghtly , meets the s@@ warm of her youth after years , and she falls in love with her . &quot;
&quot; so even in the recent novel &quot; &quot; Ac@@ tu@@ ally we are not so &quot; &quot; by Lu@@ isa B@@ inder . &quot;
&quot; beyond the love story , the novel is likely to be interesting especially for H@@ uns@@ r@@ ück readers , because he plays in Lang@@ weiler and the surrounding villages . &quot;
the main professional author was raised in Lang@@ weiler and is glad that she could put a literary monument to her hom@@ etown .
&quot; it is impossible for everyone to come to Europe &quot; &quot; - Dalai Lama - RT @-@ News &quot;
&quot; Europe cannot take up all the refugees , said the Dalai Lama and added that the real solution of the refugee crisis in the Ne@@ ar East could lie . &quot;
the Tibetan Buddhist leader urged to end violence in the home countries of the refugees .
the Dalai Lama addressed the issue of the ongoing refugee crisis at the beginning of his ten @-@ day visit to the United Kingdom in his speech at the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Com@@ passion in Oxford which devot@@ es himself to ethics studies .
he demanded that under the circumstances the interests of humanity should be placed before the interests of the individual nations or even continents .
&quot; he also stressed that the reaction of the Western European countries to the refugee crisis is ad@@ mi@@ red , but the situation is not appropriate . &quot;
&quot; it is impossible that everyone can come to Europe , &quot; he said in his speech . &quot;
&quot; although the Dalai Lama praised Germany and Austria &apos;s efforts in tac@@ kling the crisis , he emphas@@ ised that there was only a temporary solution . &quot;
&quot; to take care of several thousand refugees is wonderful , but in the meantime you need to think about long @-@ term solutions , such as a true peace and genuine development , mainly through education , for these Muslim countries , &quot; he emphas@@ ised . &quot;
&quot; in the end , we have to think about how the killing is reduced in their countries . &quot;
we must reduce the use of violence .
&quot; the use of violence never solved these problems , &quot; he added . &quot;
the Dalai Lama addressed the problem of violence and commented on George Bush &apos;s action following the terrorist attack of September 11 and revealed that the violent reaction of the US pulled a chain of un@@ controll@@ able events .
&quot; after September 11 , I expressed my con@@ dol@@ ences in a letter to President Bush , and I told him the way to solve this problem is non@@ violence . &quot;
&quot; I know his motives were good , but he used violence and this has caused unexpected consequences , &quot; &quot; said the Dalai Lama . &quot;
four @-@ fold increase in the intake of dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants by children over the last 4 years
&quot; po@@ ison control centres in the USA report on an almost 400 percent increase in the number of children under 12 years of swal@@ lowing high alcoholic , hand dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants , such as Georgia Po@@ ison Center . &quot;
&quot; according to Dr. Gay@@ lord Lop@@ ez , Director of Georgia Compar@@ ison Center , the cases of recei@@ pts of dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants in children under 12 were reporting the po@@ ison control centres , from 3,@@ 266 in 2010 to 16,@@ 117 in 2014 . &quot;
&quot; children are getting more and more common to these products , and unfortunately a percentage of them go in emergency , &quot; &quot; said Lop@@ ez CN@@ N . &quot;
&quot; he said that some children drink dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants inten@@ tionally , while some do it to impress their friends or because of a mut@@ ation in the social media . &quot;
videos on YouTube show how teenagers drink dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants just because of a cheap experience .
young people allegedly bl@@ ended dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants with alcoholic mouth@@ wash to obtain a harder drink .
younger children can be lu@@ red from attractive sc@@ ents of dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants .
&quot; a child does not think that this is bad for it , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
many of the more attractive ( hand dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants ) are those who are perf@@ um@@ ed .
&quot; there are dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants with straw@@ berry , grapes and orange scent , which are very appealing for children . &quot;
dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants contain between 45 and 95 percent alcohol .
&quot; especially with small children , a few sy@@ ring@@ es can lead to alcohol in@@ toxic@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; it is highly concentrated alcohol , &quot; said Dr. Stephen Thor@@ n@@ ton , medical director of the toxic@@ ology centre at the Hospital of the University of K@@ ans@@ as , the Fox 4 in kan@@ sa City . &quot;
&quot; so you wouldn &apos;t leave a si@@ p whis@@ ky around , but people leave this hand dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ant within reach of children , and when children get there , then it is a quick way to consume a lot of alcohol . &quot;
&quot; N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah Rus@@ sell , a six @-@ year @-@ old girl , who recently had four sp@@ lashes from after straw@@ berry sc@@ ented hand@@ some dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants at school , was put into an emergency room for treatment . &quot;
&quot; her blood alcohol concentration was 179 , twice higher than the threshold that was legally considered by an adult , Dr. Chris R@@ IT@@ CHE@@ Y , a emergency doctor who treated her in the G@@ winn@@ ett Medical Center outside Atlanta . &quot;
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah laugh@@ ed her words and was unable to go when she arrived in the emergency room .
&quot; doctors monitored them overnight in a separate children &apos;s hospital at signs of brain trau@@ ma , as the girl fell through the alcohol and had stum@@ bled over the head , R@@ IT@@ CHE@@ Y said . &quot;
&quot; this was very frigh@@ tening , &quot; said Or@@ bea Scott , N@@ ha@@ i@@ j@@ ahs mother , CN@@ N . &quot;
it could have been fatal for my child .
Lop@@ ez has recommended parents and teachers to use alcohol @-@ free products or dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants and store hand san@@ iti@@ zers outside the reach of the child .
&quot; beyond alcohol in@@ toxic@@ ation , some dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants were associated with deaths . &quot;
&quot; in 2013 two women died in Ont@@ ario women after the swal@@ lowing of dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants , which contained a toxic , non @-@ declared ingredient . &quot;
&quot; health authorities susp@@ ect that the product contained meth@@ anol , a deadly solution rather than eth@@ yl alcohol , which was listed as active ingredient . &quot;
&quot; in January , three students of the fourth grade in the State of New York planned to po@@ ison their &quot; common &quot; teacher by expos@@ ing anti@@ bacterial products around the classroom , &quot; reports a police report . &quot;
the teacher is highly allergic to hand san@@ iti@@ zer and ban@@ ished them out of their room .
the police viewed the prescribed plan as &quot; wounds &quot; and proved discipl@@ ined measures to the school authority .

the lack of title competition in Scottish football is bor@@ ed Dut@@ ch@@ man - de Bo@@ er
&quot; former Rang@@ ers mid@@ fiel@@ der and former national player of the Netherlands Ron@@ ald de Bo@@ er said that Dutch football fans have lost interest in Celtic , there is no title ri@@ val@@ ry with the Rang@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; Bo@@ er , currently an ambassador for Ajax , said : &quot; in Holland , they do not show highlights of the Celtic Games more and why ? &quot;
it is because the Rang@@ ers are not there .
people here don &apos;t just talk about the return of the leader@@ ships .
they talk about the Old Firm .
they talk about both teams and that &apos;s what they are interested in .
&quot; there is a lot of excitement in the old @-@ house games , and not only the people in Scotland who want to see these games . &quot;
&quot; I will turn things around , swe@@ ars Dei@@ la . &quot;

&quot; Dei@@ la said , &quot; &quot; Celtic already had bad times before , and we will come again . &quot;
now we want to come out as soon as possible .
&quot; I know it &apos;s very fru@@ str@@ ating and a lot of people are very , very angry or sad about what happens . &quot;
we feel this exactly like that - but we have to go on .
&quot; we really need really support Celtic , because that makes the players better . &quot;
standing together is so important .

&quot; Scotland &apos;s unemployment rate of 5.9 percent was 5.5 percent above that of the U@@ K@@ s , as shown by the figures of the Office for National Statistics ( ON@@ S ) . &quot;
&quot; in the meantime , employment in Scotland fell by 12@@ ,000 during the three months , with the number of employees at 2,@@ 6@@ 12@@ ,000 . &quot;

why I become a witness to an execution in O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma
&quot; a little later today , except in a late legal intervention , I will see how a man is brought to death . &quot;
&quot; when it happens , and I hope that it does not happen , I will sit in a spect@@ ator gallery in the death chamber at O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma State Pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary when Richard Glos@@ sy is executed by the injection sy@@ ringe . &quot;
he asked me to be one of the four official witnesses to his death .
&quot; the invitation was held for the first time in January about his best friend , and although I was shock@@ ed I agreed . &quot;
&quot; when the day approached , I began to fear . &quot;
so why should I do it ?
&quot; I agreed , because I thought it would be a good way to tell the whole story about the death penalty . &quot;
it would offer a unique perspective .
&quot; it is true that journalists are allowed to see exec@@ utions in the US , and since more applications are available as places , a mac@@ ab@@ ere lot@@ tery will take place to decide who is elected . &quot;
O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma has reduced the number of media slots from 12 to five .
those who are selected will be emotion@@ less observ@@ able .
I cannot .
I will sit next to Richard Glos@@ sy &apos;s closest friend with whom I developed my own relationship over the months with telephone calls and a two and a half hour visit .
_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _
we laugh a lot when we speak .
&quot; the prison authorities say that I can &apos;t be a witness and a journalist , so I will not be allowed to take a not@@ ebook and pen to record what I see . &quot;
I just have to try to remember all the details .
a journalist from O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma accused me on Twitter to give up my im@@ parti@@ ality .
here is the lesson .
tell the story of how he wants it and you get access .
I compl@@ ained to her .
&quot; she adm@@ its that &quot; it could have been better formulated , &quot; but she still thinks it &apos;s wrong what I do . &quot;
Richard Glos@@ sy had a problem with some of the things I said and written .
&quot; he doesn &apos;t tell me what to write , and I wouldn &apos;t do it even if he would do it . &quot;
I told him that he can remove me from his list of witnesses at any time .
but he wants an international repor@@ ter to be present to write there .
&quot; when he dies , he thinks that the public relations will help the movement against the death penalty . &quot;
&quot; Kim Bell@@ ware , a repor@@ ter at Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post , will sit next to me . &quot;
&quot; if you want to know more about the case , please hear the series of pod@@ casts that I have made . &quot;
I don &apos;t want to mention here again on all the details .
I cannot say with certainty that Richard Glos@@ sy is innocent .
his actions after the assass@@ ination of Barry Van Tre@@ ese would blame him to be a benef@@ ici@@ ary .
but I believe that a strong chance is that he is not guilty of murder .
I am sure there is not enough evidence to justify a death sentence .
I believe his execution is false .
and from this perspective I will see him dying .
I cannot claim to be really obj@@ ectively .
there will be other repor@@ ters that you can turn to .
what you will get from me is what it means to see a man dying out of unnecessary death .
man after dam@@ p police ch@@ ase persu@@ ades to come out of the C@@ anning River
the C@@ anning V@@ ale Polic@@ eman was dry as he over@@ ed the man from the C@@ anning River .
&quot; a man from Per@@ th to hang out the police was un@@ successful when he was in shallow and sw@@ amp@@ y water , just a few meters away from a police officer who tried to persu@@ ade him to return to the shore . &quot;
the police of C@@ anning V@@ ale was called in Becken@@ ham on Tuesday .
&quot; when they discovered the susp@@ ect , he tried to escape them in the direction of C@@ anning River . &quot;
but he did not come too far .
&quot; he stood in water and said &apos; I &apos;m not coming out , come and get me , &quot; said Senior Serge@@ ant S@@ hand@@ ell Cast@@ led@@ ine . &quot;
&quot; Con@@ stable Lach@@ lan Per@@ mis@@ c was not too enthusiastic about making his uniform wet , so he turned a more reliable tac@@ tic - &quot; A good polic@@ eman negoti@@ ates . &quot; &quot;
&quot; sometimes people do funny things to try to escape , &quot; said Senior Serge@@ ant Cast@@ led@@ ine . &quot;
master German soccer player Ben C@@ ous@@ ins offers an unforgettable example .
&quot; in 2006 , cous@@ ins drove his car into the dit@@ ch to avoid alcohol check and then tried to swim over the S@@ wan River . &quot;
his efforts were un@@ successful but inspired locals to the hum@@ orous planning of a Ben C@@ ous@@ in bi@@ athlon .
Peter Moo@@ dy claims that st@@ ew@@ ards tried to spy him out and threat@@ ens to end racing
Peter Moo@@ dy claims that Stew@@ ards of Racing Victoria attempted to install a spy in his st@@ ables last year and threatened to finish the race right away .
&quot; he pointed to the Stew@@ ards and the integrity department of Racing Victoria and claimed that she conducted a personal campaign against him with the L@@ ate Scr@@ at@@ ching by Lady Tat@@ ai for a race day treatment , the last straw on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; Moo@@ dy said Fair@@ fax Media that he always tried to do what is best for racing and he found himself under difficult conditions , when it was about the positive cob@@ alt T@@ up@@ a probe near Li@@ dar@@ is , which he cannot explain . &quot;
he had held back 18 months because of the sp@@ ying accus@@ ations and did not want it to &quot; look like too high hanging grapes . &quot;
&quot; I had nothing to say about it , and I waited a long time on it , but sometimes you are so fru@@ str@@ ated that everything comes out at once , &quot; &quot; said Moo@@ dy . &quot;
they know that it continued .
sometimes you react and you have to live with the consequences and I have to live with what I said .
I will go home tonight and sleep well .
&quot; I would like to move about the head of my head , and I want my owners to think that I do my best for them . &quot;
&quot; when they start thinking , I don &apos;t do that , then I should not be a trainer . &quot;
I have to think about what I do with my license .
&quot; previously , Moo@@ dy had let the bomb explo@@ de in an interview with rac@@ ing.com that the integrity department had tried to spy on its stable . &quot;
&quot; eighte@@ en months Terr@@ y Bail@@ ey , Day@@ le Brown and Dr. Brian Stew@@ art sat in a room with a man - whom I &apos;m going to name when I &apos;m asked - and offered him an occupation in my st@@ ables to provide information about what I do within my st@@ ables , &quot; &quot; said Moo@@ dy on rac@@ ing.com . &quot;
they seem to believe that I am a sc@@ am .
&quot; if this is the case , they should certainly touch their n@@ oses because they have failed in trying to hold me . &quot;
&quot; Robert Rou@@ l@@ ston , former Chairman of the RV@@ L , David Moo@@ s , acting President of the RV@@ L and Bernard Sa@@ undry , current CEO of RV@@ L , were aware of this at the time and are still today . &quot;
should this bring me to the view that it will be personally ?
&quot; has the RV@@ L beha@@ ves co@@ war@@ dly , and maybe people outside trainers are responsible for what &apos;s going on in the industry ? &quot;
am I bad for the industry ?
am I so bad for the industry ?
maybe people think outside that I am .
&quot; maybe they have to take my license and cast me away , and I have no doubt that what I say is to think about it now . &quot;
&quot; but I am now at the point where that doesn &apos;t matter , and that makes me sad . &quot;
that makes me really sad .
I will put pressure on them and press them to make a decision .
I have the support of my family and I can go .
&quot; the training levels of the trainer have built up with the long @-@ lasting Cob@@ alt examination at Li@@ dar@@ i , and the L@@ ate Scr@@ at@@ ching conducted that he said he &quot; could throw his license over the table . &quot;
&quot; Moo@@ dy , best known by his preparation of the un@@ beaten master black , the race @-@ days treatment rule was &quot; ridi@@ cul@@ ous , &quot; after a pack of slu@@ dge or clay had been applied to the horse &apos;s debate , which viol@@ ated the rules . &quot;
&quot; it is against the rules of racing .
&quot; I have to take full responsibility for it , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; one of my collabor@@ ators mistakenly put mud on the leg .
it could have been so last night .
&quot; it could have been so yesterday all the day , which was so . &quot;
but it also had this on the race day .
Moo@@ dy could be confronted with a three @-@ month dis@@ qualification for the treatment with the pack on the race day . an investigation of this matter was opened .
it is a joke .
people who set up these rules don &apos;t know anything about the horse .
&quot; we all see that we need rules , but here you have gone too far , &quot; &quot; said Moo@@ dy . &quot;
man was arrested after a driver &apos;s flight
the police arrested a man after a clas@@ h with a cycl@@ ist and a driver cur@@ sed in Cob@@ ham on the weekend .
&quot; the cycl@@ ist was delivered with the helicop@@ ter to the Royal Melbourne Hospital with serious injuries , after he was hit by a car on Saturday morning on the Mur@@ ray Highway . &quot;
the police said the driver drove on without stopping to help the injured rider .
on Monday there was a 50 year old man from Nath@@ alia the police in Sh@@ ep@@ part@@ on .
he is expected to be indic@@ ted because of driver cur@@ ses and abandoned assistance and other means of transport .
&quot; the cycl@@ ist , a 40 @-@ year @-@ old man from Cob@@ ram , remains in the hospital . he is in a stable state . &quot;
Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Cra@@ ig Bell@@ amy returns to ri@@ vals because of claims to ring struggling
Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Cra@@ ig Bell@@ amy called criticism of the tac@@ kling of his players as &quot; Agenda @-@ Setting &quot; by two Premier League favorites of the N@@ RL .
&quot; Sydney R@@ oo@@ sters Trainer Tr@@ ent Robinson said that the ump@@ ires have allowed the Storm players &quot; &quot; ring competitions &quot; &quot; with his team during the high Storm contest in Sydney on Friday evening . &quot;
Bris@@ bane Bronze &apos;s Trainer Way@@ ne Benn@@ ett made a little disgu@@ ised comment to the Storm team after his team had achieved the final victory against North Que@@ ens@@ land cow@@ boys on Saturday night . he said that the two from Que@@ ens@@ land were not &quot; too good &quot; in the struggle .
Bell@@ amy def@@ ended the T@@ ack@@ li@@ mg of his team and said they were only concentrated on their &quot; contact &quot; at the tac@@ kling .
&quot; Bell@@ amy added that the criticism of two leading trainers in his team conc@@ lusi@@ vely accept him , because they were worried that they were worried about being beaten by the Storm team . &quot;
&quot; this repeat@@ ed@@ ely shows up - I did not hear Tr@@ ent Robinson rep@@ lied about the fights when she met us 24 : 2 , &quot; said Bell@@ amy on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; I can guarantee that we have not changed our defective system or the techniques throughout the year , but in the last six weeks we have made our contact with tac@@ kl@@ es a real focus and this has provided us with the trend revers@@ al . &quot;
&quot; Tr@@ ent has been there for three years now , and obviously he has a great team to train . &quot;
it &apos;s funny as this happens again and again during this time of the year .
&quot; Bell@@ amy has attacked Benn@@ etts an idea of &quot; thr@@ illing football , &quot; and remember that Benn@@ etts St George Il@@ la@@ war@@ ra Dragons won the Premier League in 2010 with &quot; boring &quot; football . &quot;
Way@@ ne speaks of exciting football .
&quot; he compared his game on Saturday evening with our Friday evening and how exciting her game was , &quot; &quot; said Bell@@ amy . &quot;
&quot; I remember that in 2010 St George was critic@@ ised as a boring team , and Way@@ ne said that he will take care of a divor@@ ce . &quot;
&quot; but now he has a team that can play and that we consider exciting , especially his young players with their speed . &quot;
this is the ball game you want to play if you have these kind of players .
&quot; he made this statement in 2010 , now he wants everyone to play his kind of football - not every team has two players such as Anthony Mil@@ ford and Ben H@@ unt so they can play like these . &quot;
I build stronger trust because they say these things because they are a bit worried about playing against us .
&quot; six weeks ago , they did not think about us when it was about the big games . &quot;
Bell@@ amy also pointed out that the Storm against R@@ oo@@ sters improved a higher result than the game Bron@@ cos against cow@@ boys .
&quot; the game of the Bron@@ cos was probably a good game , I haven &apos;t seen it yet , but what was the result ? 16 : 12 ? &quot;
&quot; our game was 20 : 18 , there were two more attempts in our game , but is that an exciting game ? &quot;
or are they doing breaks and do not have any points of tension ?
for me it is the sched@@ ules .
&quot; when they say to us , it means that in one phase we will meet them . &quot;
the Storm team has released this weekend because they won the right to receive either North Que@@ ens@@ land cow@@ boys or the C@@ ron@@ ul@@ la Shar@@ ks on the next Saturday evening in the A@@ AM@@ I Park . ticket sales begin next Tuesday morning .
&quot; Serbia with 200,000 € deposit on drug traff@@ icking &quot;
&quot; a man who possibly threat@@ ens a life @-@ long punishment because of his attempt to come to the possession of 40 kilo@@ grams of co@@ ca@@ ine , which was sm@@ ug@@ gled after Que@@ ens@@ land , was released against a deposit of $ 200,000 . &quot;
&quot; Mark@@ o Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c , 29 , was one of the five men who were arrested last month after the Federal Police met 100 kg of the drug on the yacht Sol@@ ay , who came from South America via Van@@ u@@ atu and transferred to Co@@ om@@ era in August . &quot;
Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c was watched as he met his co @-@ def@@ end@@ ants at the marina during the morning and later in the Café Co@@ om@@ era Road@@ house where the police found 40 kilo@@ grams of the drug in a Toyota Echo .
&quot; despite a potentially life @-@ equal punishment for an attempt to possess a commercial volume of co@@ ca@@ ine , the attorney of Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c argu@@ ed that there was no evidence that he tried to possess the whole amount and that in the café he could have been a harmless reason . &quot;
&quot; the judge at the Supreme Court , Peter Flan@@ ag@@ an , was concerned about the danger of escape from Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c . &quot;
he has clear relations with Serbia .
&quot; he often travels to Serbia , &quot; he explained to the court on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; in the case of the criminal complaint , he lied to the police about his where@@ ab@@ outs . &quot;
Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic@@ s mother and step@@ father had offered a deposit of 200.000 dollars as security coll@@ ectively to reach his release .
&quot; after reading the aff@@ id@@ av@@ able statements of the two persons it is clear that the circulation of a security of 200,000 dollars is a real financial burden , &quot; said judge Flan@@ ag@@ an . &quot;
&quot; but that alone will not suff@@ ice to prevent him from appearing , he warned . &quot;
&quot; Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c was released on b@@ ail , under the conditions that he aband@@ ons his austr@@ alian and his Serbian passport , announces at the police every day and adher@@ es to an initial im@@ mobil@@ iser of 18 : 00 @-@ 06 : 00 . &quot;

St@@ ev@@ an H@@ og@@ g used telephone from girls to l@@ ure p@@ ests to send images
a p@@ äd@@ oph@@ ile used the telephone of an 11 year old girl to request pictures of child abuse .
&quot; St@@ ev@@ an H@@ og@@ g took the phone of the girl , when she slept , got into an online mess@@ aging service , from which he received a series of un@@ stable pictures of children sent to him by another user . &quot;
the girl wo@@ ke up later and discovered that the phone was missing and found it in the hands of the sleeping h@@ og@@ g .
&quot; she saw it through , found the conf@@ using messages and immediately al@@ armed her mother . &quot;
&quot; the police took care of it and saw the five pictures , then analysed computers found under the address and discovered &quot; &quot; web research &quot; , &quot; which used terms for searching for in@@ decent images of children . &quot;
&quot; H@@ og@@ g then claimed to the officials that he did it , as it would lead to &quot; p@@ ests in the internet , &quot; and he then &quot; pre@@ tended to be a polic@@ eman in order to frigh@@ ten them . &quot;
&quot; the prosec@@ utor E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Rober@@ t@@ son said the Dun@@ dee Sh@@ eri@@ ff Court : &quot; he said it would be a ad@@ diction , that he is addic@@ ted to sc@@ aring people . &quot;
&quot; he admitted that searches on the computer were carried out by him , but said it was done because he wanted to pret@@ end to be a polic@@ eman to frigh@@ ten p@@ ests . &quot;
&quot; he was asked about his conversation with the unknown person , who sent him the pictures and asked him to send even more photos . &quot;
he said he did it to l@@ ure her .
&quot; he said he was sick in his head when he drinks , and said he wanted to see images of rape and murder . &quot;
MS Rober@@ t@@ son added : &quot; when the girl found the news on the phone she called her mother and was in trem@@ bling and crying .
she also saw the in@@ decent images on the phone and confronted the def@@ end@@ ant with it .
the girl was inter@@ viewed and said the def@@ end@@ ant computer and play@@ station used to talk to girls who looked much younger than he .
&quot; H@@ og@@ g , 23 , W@@ ard Road , Dun@@ dee , ple@@ aded guilty in the sense of the indictment , to have viol@@ ated incomplete pictures of children on 14 June last year , and not to have appeared before the court for a hearing on 24 March this year . &quot;
&quot; def@@ ender attorney Gregory S@@ im asked that H@@ og@@ g did not appear in the register of sexual offen@@ ders , since one could argue that &quot; &quot; no substantial sexual element &quot; &quot; in his suspic@@ ion could be found . &quot;
Sh@@ eri@@ ff A@@ list@@ air Car@@ mi@@ ch@@ ael spar@@ ed the ver@@ dict by October to get background reports on social work .
&quot; H@@ og@@ g was granted a deposit in this case , but was kept in custo@@ dy for hear@@ ings to other cases . &quot;
it was recorded before the date of judgment in the directory of sexual off@@ ences .
people switch to Germany on small border cross@@ ings
more and more refugees are taken up from the major control points on the German @-@ Austrian border .
many people from fear of discovery and sei@@ z@@ ure caused people to increase the number of border cross@@ ings .
&quot; on the Austrian side , a spokes@@ man of the Federal Police said . &quot;
&quot; along the river river Inn , more than 1000 refugees have been taken up in the districts of Pass@@ au and Rot@@ tal @-@ Inn since Tuesday . &quot;
they were on foot over bridges and traffic guns to the German side .
there they are received by Federal Police and for@@ warded to the registration .
&quot; at the Munich Central Station , the Federal Police saw clearly more refugees in comparison to the start of the week on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; some 700 people arrived in the state capital alone until 8 : 00 , &quot; said a spokes@@ man in the morning . &quot;
&quot; after the re@@ introduction of controls on the German @-@ Austrian border , the city reached 17@@ 59 refugees on Tuesday . &quot;
Stuttgart : dro@@ ught of Trop@@ enst@@ ur@@ m &quot; Henry &quot; expected in the Sou@@ thwest
meteor@@ ologists warn of wind trage@@ dies in the south @-@ west of Wednesday afternoon .
&quot; due to a low @-@ pressure area across Western Europe , warm sea air flows into the country , shared by the German Weather Service ( D@@ WD ) in Stuttgart . &quot;
&quot; the vigor@@ ous low@@ ly is the for@@ er@@ un@@ ner of the tropical storm &quot; Henry , &quot; which was drawn over the Atlantic in the past few days . &quot;
fierce stor@@ ms and stor@@ ms are mainly expected in Baden .
&quot; according to D@@ WD , the Black Forest is still counting on the Schw@@ ä@@ bische Al@@ b and at the bottom @-@ seek@@ er with Bö@@ en from 60 to 90 hours of hour . &quot;
&quot; on Friday , the sun can be seen again longer . &quot;
the mass makes it : every two years the motor@@ ways at the I@@ AA show their novel@@ ties .
&quot; in 2015 , there is a movement among the compact cars , which are currently especially well @-@ selling . &quot;
&quot; cars from the compact class are currently in demand : around 28.@@ 1 percent of new registrations , according to the power drive federal office ( KBA ) , fell to this segment alone in August alone . &quot;
this is also reflected in the I@@ AA ( public days 17 to 27 September ) .
&quot; this year , many new compact models will be presented between all the fut@@ uris@@ tic conceptual vehicles and new luxury cars . &quot;
&quot; one of the biggest premier@@ es for the German car industry is the Opel Astra , which will be at deal@@ er@@ ships in autumn . &quot;
&quot; the Astra is an extremely important model for us , &quot; said Opel CEO Karl @-@ Thomas Neumann at the fair . &quot;
it belongs to the core of the brand .
&quot; in order for the volume model to be sold well , the new Astra is not to be much more expensive . &quot;
Opel Demon@@ str@@ ates an entrance under the biggest competi@@ tor VW Golf in a view that starts at 17 650 euros .
the current Astra will cost from 16 990 euros .
the Astra is available with a new 1.4 liter engine with 74 kW / 100 hp .
&quot; in addition , H@@ esse offers additional diesel and gasoline engines of 70 kW / 95 hp to 147 kW / / 200 hp , which also include three @-@ cylinder gasoline engines . &quot;
&quot; unlike the most important competitors VW Golf and Ford Focus , Opel Astra is only available as a five @-@ door Astra . &quot;
&quot; the second variant will follow in the spring of the com@@ bi , which is also visible at the I@@ AA . &quot;
and what will be put on new compact cars next to the Astra on the I@@ AA ?
Renault Mé@@ gan@@ e : Renault sends the fourth generation of its Astra competi@@ tor Mé@@ gan@@ e into the race .
&quot; at the fair , the Mé@@ gan@@ e can only be seen as a fifth in a conventional and acc@@ entu@@ ated GT version . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of next year , he is also a com@@ bi . &quot;
Infin@@ iti : brand new in the segment is Infin@@ iti Q@@ 30 .
&quot; with the new model , the Nissan @-@ off@@ shoot will find its position in the strongly growing segment . &quot;
the compact Infin@@ iti with its curved lines fits perfectly into the brand &apos;s design line .
the basic model will receive a gasoline engine with an output of at least 90 kW / 122 hp .
&quot; however , there is also a diesel engine with 80 kW / 109 hp or 125 kW / 170 hp . &quot;
&quot; Suzuki Bal@@ eno : new in the segment is also the Suzuki Bal@@ eno , who is celebrating its world premiere in Frankfurt . &quot;
&quot; the model is offered with gasoline engines , including a newly developed 1.0 liter tur@@ bo@@ charged engine and an output of 82 kW / 111 b@@ hp . &quot;
the maximum torque is due to manufacturer &apos;s declar@@ ations at 170 new@@ ton meters ( Nm ) .
sales launch of Bal@@ eno in Europe will be launched in spring 2016 .
&quot; DS 4 : not brand new , but all around is the compact class DS 4 , which can be seen at the I@@ AA . &quot;
&quot; outside , the designers of the noble Citro@@ ë@@ n @-@ Ab@@ leg@@ ers placed their hands on the front part : the radiator gr@@ ille was re@@ designed and the modified head@@ lights are equipped with LED technology . &quot;
&quot; in the interior , especially the inf@@ ot@@ ain@@ ment system was moderni@@ zed , the number of buttons is reduced by a touch screen and for the first time integrated Apple &apos;s Car@@ Play . &quot;
&quot; in addition , at the I@@ AA in the compact class , there are a number of re@@ visions and new variants as the re@@ vit@@ alised Mercedes A @-@ Class or the Peugeot 308 GT@@ I . &quot;
J@@ VA Berlin @-@ Te@@ gel : five square metres of cell are un@@ worthy of human dignity
&quot; the Federal Constitutional Court granted a former prisoner of the Justice Pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary Te@@ gel , which was accommod@@ ated for months in a small cell . &quot;
&quot; because of the violation of their human dignity , prisoners are entitled to financial compensation if they are accommod@@ ated in too small cells . &quot;
this decision has made the Federal Constitutional Court in a decision published on Wednesday .
the persons concerned can even hope for money if they were im@@ pris@@ oned only a few days in the confined spaces ( A@@ z . : 1 BvR 112@@ 7 / 14 ) .
&quot; in this way , an ex @-@ prisoner with his constitutional complaint was successful in Karlsruhe : he was housed in the Berlin @-@ Te@@ gel prison office between June and November 2009 in a single cell with approximately five square meters of floor space ; the toilet was sp@@ ati@@ ally not separated . &quot;
&quot; after that , the man , who , according to his lawyer , was now on a free foot , was transferred to a larger cell . &quot;
his burden of office because of the un@@ worthy conditions of det@@ ention against the country of Berlin failed .
&quot; however , the Constitutional Court lifted the judgment of the Berlin Court of Appe@@ als and rejected the case for renewed examination . &quot;
they see the man &apos;s dignity viol@@ ated .
the Court of Appe@@ al decides on the amount of compensation
&quot; even if for legal reasons only a few days of det@@ ention are author@@ it@@ ative for compensation from the question@@ able period of time , a compens@@ atory was given . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , &quot; a cl@@ ump of the legal protection of the personality would be to be feared . &quot;
the Court of Appe@@ al must now clarify the amount of compensation .
&quot; in the past , the judges have often strengthened the rights of prisoners of war . &quot;
&quot; thus they said only in April of a prisoner &apos;s in@@ toxic@@ ation , because he was im@@ pris@@ oned naked in a cell . &quot;
&quot; according to a decision of 2011 , human un@@ worthy is also the multiple assignment of a cell without separate toilet . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , in addition to the Berlin Constitutional Court , Karlsruhe officially confirmed a decent housing in a parallel case in November 2009 . &quot;
the compl@@ ain@@ ant was lod@@ ged every day between 15 to 21 hours in a similar cell as in the Karls@@ ru@@ her case .
&quot; in recent weeks , the Berlin pris@@ ons had come to the head@@ lines due to lack of staff . &quot;
&quot; prisoners are therefore always locked up for 23 hours , which increases aggres@@ si@@ veness , even in fights , it should have come because of the ten@@ se situation . &quot;
&quot; according to the judicial office , 21 jobs in Te@@ gel are not occupied for lack of offspring , 19 are to be om@@ itted in 2016 . &quot;
Angela Merkel and the refugee policy : &quot; we are creating this &quot;
the immigration of refugees is an enormous challenge - the chan@@ cell@@ or is determined to accept them .
what comes to Germany ?
&quot; according to the Federal Ministry of Foreign Affairs , approximately 800 000 asylum seek@@ ers will come to Germany this year , according to Vice @-@ Chancellor Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) , Germany is even able to take up one million refugees . &quot;
&quot; German Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) demonstrated determination in the face of the unusual challenge : &quot; &quot; I say again and again : we can create it , and we create that . &quot;
what comes to Germany gives the following overview .
&quot; according to various progn@@ oses between 35@@ 0000 ( estimate of the Federal Ministry of State ) and 400@@ ,000 ( estim@@ ation of the P@@ est@@ el Institute ) flats are used annually - for the next five years . &quot;
this is almost twice as much as it has been built up to now ( 25@@ 0000 dwell@@ ings ) .
&quot; the lack of living room is dramatic , but above all with affordable rental properties : from 600@@ 00 to 800@@ 00 social apartments are falling out of the rental price , and in order to apply these particularly favorable apartments refugees will also apply . &quot;
&quot; therefore , Federal Minister Barbara Hend@@ ri@@ cks ( SPD ) therefore wants to double the funding , from currently 518 million to a billion euros . &quot;
&quot; from the point of view of the P@@ est@@ el Institute : 80 000 social housing est@@ ates would have to develop annually , and the federal government would have to invest EUR 6.4 billion a year . &quot;
&quot; however , scientists and federal mini@@ stries agree that there must also be more tax advantages for investments in housing construction . &quot;
&quot; according to estimates by the Institute for Employment Research , 55 percent of the refugees in Germany can be employed in the long term . &quot;
&quot; however , the refugees in Germany would not be asked about their qualifications to help them get started , Claudia Walter , project manager for integration and education in the Ber@@ tel@@ smann Foundation . &quot;
&quot; for the integration of refugees , however , it is crucial whether they find employment in Germany . &quot;
&quot; work is the key to social contacts , for appreciation in the admission society , but also for the self @-@ este@@ em of immigrants , says migration researcher Dietrich thr@@ ill@@ hardt . &quot;
&quot; in Germany , according to Thr@@ one , it has given a political shift : from employment prohibition for refugees to recognise work . &quot;
&quot; while there was a ban on employment for asylum seek@@ ers of up to five years , this was reduced to three months in November 2014 , just as the residence obligation , the asylum seek@@ ers limited to a residence . &quot;
&quot; in society , even because of the short@@ age of skilled labour , it is mostly the view that refugees should be able to gain access to the labour market faster . &quot;
the lack of German knowledge is a major hur@@ dle for access to the labour market .
&quot; until now , there is no sufficient offer of general and professional language courses . &quot;
research also shows that work@@ stations are most often medi@@ ated through personal contacts .
&quot; as a result , the building of networks is the Königs@@ weg &apos;s view to the integration of the king@@ way to the integration of the king@@ way . &quot;
&quot; the Berlin School Management found that only a few escaped parents give their children into the Kit@@ as , estimated 10 to 15 percent : &quot; for the u@@ pro@@ oted parents , it is very important to keep the family together , &quot; says Il@@ ja Ko@@ ehl@@ bar , spokes@@ man for youth and family in the Berlin Senate Administration . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , to convince the family of the advantages of the K@@ ita , the management distri@@ butes hand@@ books in various languages . &quot;
&quot; if the need for educ@@ ators increased significantly by the large number of refugees , the Berlin Senate would attempt to increase training capacities - for example by allowing more specialized schools . &quot;
&quot; in the countries , students without knowledge of German will be prepared for classes in welcome classes . &quot;
&quot; but they are not always taught by fully educated teachers , but , as in Berlin , also by teachers who only have a qualification in German as a second language . &quot;
&quot; there is no lack , says Be@@ ate St@@ offers from the Berlin School of School . &quot;
the German Studenten@@ werk estimates that about 20 per cent of the refugees in Germany want to study .
&quot; in principle , no federal land does not prohi@@ bit asylum seek@@ ers or toler@@ ated the study - the only exception was Berlin , the inner sen@@ ator Frank H@@ enkel ( CD@@ U ) has now given up his stance . &quot;
admission to the university could be facilit@@ ated by student willing refugees .
because refugees with a compensation or debt do not receive any services after the asylum seek@@ ers law more if they begin a study .
&quot; in principle , the latter does not get a B@@ af@@ ö@@ g , since they do not fall under the circle of legitimate persons . &quot;
&quot; toler@@ ated refugees had to have lived in Germany for four years to be eligible , from 1 January 2016 , this margin is reduced to 15 months . &quot;
&quot; but this financing gap must also be closed , ask Steffen Kra@@ ch , Berlin &apos;s Secretary of State for Science , and the German Studenten@@ werk . &quot;
students should immediately get B@@ af@@ ö@@ g .
&quot; Islam will play a more important role in the future , as many refugees are Muslims , and for many , religion is an important part of their identity . &quot;
&quot; the state should succ@@ essi@@ vely extend to Islam the same rights as the churches have , and the existing state @-@ denom@@ in@@ ational right to further develop a new state religion ratio . &quot;
&quot; it is also important to establish an Islamic welfare association , who takes care of the new@@ com@@ ers . &quot;
the rights also include duties .
&quot; thus , the representatives of Islam must agree on clear contact persons and be prepared to work with the state in many areas and to grant him certain control possibilities . &quot;
this also includes the willingness to take heed to religious fundament@@ alism .
&quot; the Chairman of the Central Council of Muslims , A@@ im@@ an Maz@@ ye@@ k , expressed concern on Thursday that religious conflicts could also be carried into Germany . &quot;
&quot; those who wanted to carry out such conflicts in Germany immediately have their right to stay here , here in Germany , &quot; &quot; he said in the Bavarian Radio . &quot;
he proposed to translate the Basic Law in Arabic .
integration will be much more than today a topic of the whole society .
&quot; with this , the majority society will also have to change , the reduction of discrimination and rac@@ ism is more pressing . &quot;
&quot; indeed , Germany - as a result of European decisions - has been an anti @-@ discrimination point and a general gender equality law for a decade . &quot;
but it lear@@ ns very slowly how the NS@@ U @-@ murder series showed how the rac@@ ist motive was systematically ignored in the police and authorities .
&quot; the same opportunities for all : what mig@@ rant organisations and the stakeholders of non @-@ white German already call for a long time and why international agreements like the anti @-@ rac@@ ist convention are committed to , in the coming years must become reality when the country remains peaceful and its new citizens should use their opportunities - for the benefit of all . &quot;
&quot; in general , Germany is capable of medi@@ cally supplying the expected refugees to date , says Frank Ulrich Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery . &quot;
&quot; regarding man@@ - power and capacities , we create it , &quot; he said to the Tages@@ spiegel . &quot;
&quot; however , additional money needs to be incorporated into the system . &quot;
&quot; to avoid bott@@ len@@ ecks , Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery demands to be handed over to all com@@ ers in the registration of health cards . &quot;
services rendered could later be ac@@ counted for with the federal states .
&quot; and in the long term , it is highly question@@ able that as many people use the limited power catalog to submit to the asylum seek@@ er &apos;s law . &quot;
otherwise the doctors are above all doing language barriers .
&quot; so far , the Berlin health scientist The@@ a Bor@@ de has proven that migrants are worse than other patients than other patients . &quot;
&quot; not only in clinics , also in medical practices , interpre@@ ting costs have to be taken over , they ask . &quot;
&quot; however , many refugees would be helped with more general medical contact points in emergency ambul@@ ances . &quot;
and with another diagnostic sight .
&quot; for instance , there are much more un@@ treated ob@@ struc@@ tions among refugee children , and with the young people it is about HIV @-@ clari@@ fication . &quot;
&quot; with the partially other clinical pictures German doctors come from their education but clearly , Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery means . &quot;
&quot; the paras@@ it@@ osis or tu@@ ber@@ cu@@ lo@@ sis are not so difficult to detect . &quot; &quot; and what concerns the short@@ age of doctors is perhaps even alle@@ vi@@ ated by the refugees . &quot;
&quot; the Syri@@ ans would have a highly developed educational system , some refugees are even doctors . &quot;
&quot; in order to be allowed to practice , however , they would have to prove their qualifications and possibly need to perform tests . &quot;
&quot; at least half of refugees coming in Germany are psych@@ ologically ill , according to estimates by the Federal Agency &apos;s Psych@@ otherap@@ ist Chamber ( B@@ P@@ t@@ K ) : most suffer from a post @-@ traumatic stress disorder or depression . &quot;
&quot; particularly vulnerable to refugees , Dietrich Mun@@ z , President of the B@@ P@@ t@@ K . &quot;
a recently published study by the TU München affir@@ ms that every fifth Syrian refugee camp is trau@@ mati@@ zed in Germany .
&quot; those who are suffering from a post @-@ traumatic stress disorder , among other things , suffer from so @-@ called flash@@ backs with breath , di@@ zz@@ iness , heart @-@ rag@@ s and death @-@ fear@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; other symptoms include sleep and concentration distur@@ bances , strong horror and emotional num@@ b@@ ness . &quot;
&quot; to prevent the symptoms would be chronic , early treatment is necessary , explained Mun@@ z . &quot;
&quot; to date , however , only four percent of the psych@@ ologically ill refugees receive a psych@@ otherapy . &quot;
&quot; although psych@@ ologically ill asylum seek@@ ers can make an application for psych@@ otherapy in the social @-@ offices , the treatment usually lasts several months . &quot;
&quot; in addition , in the social @-@ offices mostly matter @-@ workers or doctors , who are not trained for mental illness , decide whether a therapy is necessary or not . &quot;
&quot; this often leads to mis@@ calculations , says Mun@@ z . &quot;
arena invites you to dream
&quot; with the new st@@ aging &quot; passion , &quot; the Circus Pro@@ bst looks back on the traditions of cir@@ cus arts . &quot;
&quot; the goal is to draw every age group into the spell of fascinating ac@@ rob@@ atics , animal dres@@ sage and unique entertainment . &quot;
now the Circus Pro@@ bst invites you to dream in the man@@ ege on the Z@@ iegel fac@@ ades .
&quot; our passion is cir@@ cus . &quot;
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine living without my cir@@ cus family , &quot; says Steph@@ anie Pro@@ bst , Animal Teacher and Juni@@ or@@ ch@@ ef@@ in . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; passion &quot; &quot; - under this motto is the current art of art . &quot;
&quot; for more than 33 years , the Circus has been in the hands of the Pro@@ bst family . &quot;
the gift to sav@@ our lies in the blood of the family .
&quot; it is important to us to take the people away from their everyday life and take them to a completely different world for two hours , &quot; &quot; stresses the 27 @-@ year @-@ old Juni@@ or@@ ch@@ ef@@ in . &quot;
&quot; Man@@ eg@@ enco@@ ck@@ tails with cos@@ mop@@ olitan flair , &quot; says Director Reinhard Pro@@ bst his concept . &quot;
50 cities on the barely 3 000 km long tour can now experience this flair .
the cir@@ cus programme impres@@ ses with talented artists from all over the world .
&quot; awarded at the international cir@@ cus festival in Monte Carlo , the Russian St@@ oli@@ aro@@ v C@@ low@@ n Family draws the audience with w@@ it and charm in their spell . &quot;
the Cas@@ tillo Brothers also understand their craft .
&quot; with the heroes of the silent movies , the Cu@@ ban duo wants to take up . &quot;
light@@ ness and mobility - with these words they identify themselves .
her hum@@ orous art at the mast shall conquer women &apos;s hearts in the storm .
&quot; apart from numerous laugh@@ ing sal@@ ons , the ac@@ rob@@ atics of cir@@ cus promot@@ ers fascin@@ ate with dex@@ am@@ ity and joint . &quot;
balance with the un@@ ic@@ ycle on a ball ?
for He Yuan no problem .
intri@@ gu@@ ing and frigh@@ tening snake @-@ men at the same time .
Wang L@@ in from China is familiar with the oldest form of ac@@ rob@@ atics as little others and fascin@@ ates with their flexibility .
60 employees from twelve nations offer variety in every respect .
&quot; the animals belong to our family , &quot; &quot; stresses Stephan &apos;s mother , Brigitte Pro@@ bst . &quot;
problems in the attitude of cir@@ cus animals are too often subject to different animal protection organisations .
Steph@@ anie Pro@@ bst looks for her : &quot; if our animals are not good , we are not going well . &quot;
around 80 animals from five different continents enjoy each pet@@ ting unit .
&quot; the &quot; &quot; four @-@ leg@@ ged arti@@ stes &quot; , &quot; as they are called lov@@ ingly , will be read from the eyes at every wish . &quot;
we want to work with the animals and have fun with them .
&quot; if the animal does not feel well , it does not want to be in the arena . &quot;
the top commandment is therefore : good for the animals .
&quot; especially on her zeb@@ roid tou@@ bo , a mixture of a sh@@ et@@ land pon@@ y stallion and a zeb@@ ra mare , the Pro@@ bst family is proud . &quot;
the two animals lived together eight years in a habitat and nothing happened .
&quot; but then , suddenly , our little Jum@@ bo was there , &quot; says Brigitte Pro@@ bst . &quot;
&quot; the zeb@@ roid is not ready for the arena , but it is the unique mas@@ cot of Circus Pro@@ bst . &quot;
there should be something for each visitor .
&quot; one thing is certain , &quot; says Steph@@ anie Pro@@ bst : &quot; no matter if five or 1 200 spectators , we always give our best and are with all your heart . &quot;
the Circus Pro@@ bst invites you to his ideas from 17 to 20 September daily at 5 pm and 8 pm .
on Sunday the program begins at 11 a.m. and 4 p.m .
&quot; Thursday is family day , for the performance at 5 p.m. the prices are reduced . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the daily gaz@@ ebo is open from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. &quot;
Sim@@ bab@@ we@@ es Robert Mug@@ abe holds false speech in parliament
&quot; Mr Mug@@ abe , Africa &apos;s oldest leader , fell down the stairs from a podium at the beginning of the year . &quot;
&quot; he remained un@@ har@@ med , but the video of the case quickly spread across the social media . &quot;
the opening of the Parliament was also clou@@ ded by alleg@@ ations of de@@ pu@@ ties of the opposition that they had received anonymous death threats and warned them to accompany the speech of Mr Mug@@ abe with buff@@ ets .
&quot; last month they had cut him out , and during his speech on the position of the nation in parliament , this is the speech he repeated on Tuesday . &quot;
spokes@@ man of the Movement for Democratic Change ( Movement for Democratic Change - M@@ DC ) In@@ no@@ cent Gon@@ ese said that seven opposition politicians have received SMS messages on their phones they warned beforehand to inter@@ fere with Mr. Mug@@ abe &apos;s speech .
&quot; the message comes from a number that is not shown , but it has the title &apos; death &apos; , &quot; he said journalists to Mug@@ ello &apos;s speech . &quot;
&quot; it war@@ ns the members of Parliament who are affected by the Parliament &apos;s immun@@ ity , and as soon as they leave parliament , their parliamentary immun@@ ity is no longer effective . &quot;
the leader said that the party led by Morgan T@@ sv@@ angi@@ ra@@ i is &quot; concerned &quot; about the dangers for politicians .
H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard will build up to 30.000 jobs
H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard is expected to create 25.000 to 30.000 jobs within the framework of restructuring and saving efforts in the company &apos;s services .
HP will split up in two listed companies this year and separate the computer and printer business from its fast growing company hardware and service business activities .
&quot; the expected job breakdown leads to a burden of over 2.7 billion dollars from the fourth quarter , said HP in an explanation . &quot;
&quot; these restructuring measures will enable a more competitive , more sustainable cost structure for the new H@@ ew@@ lett Pack@@ ard Enterprise , &quot; said Me@@ g Whit@@ man , HP President and Chief Executive , who will lead the unit after separation . &quot;
&quot; H@@ ew@@ lett Pack@@ ard Enterprise will be smaller and more focused than HP is today , and we have a broad and deep@@ ened portfolio of businesses that help businesses transition to a new style of business , &quot; said Whit@@ man . &quot;
as an independent company we are better positioned than ever before to satisfy the changing needs of our customers all over the world .
&quot; H@@ ew@@ lett Pack@@ ard Enterprise has more than 50 billion annual revenue and &quot; will be focused on delivering previously un@@ reachable , integrated technology solutions for businesses , &quot; such an explanation of the company . &quot;
it spl@@ its a company founded in the 19@@ 30s by graduates of Stan@@ ford University Bill H@@ ew@@ lett and Dave Pack@@ ard to manufacture electrical equipment and their Pal@@ o Alto Garage is called &quot; the birth@@ place of Silicon Valley . &quot;
HP has under@@ gone massive restructuring to cope with the conversion from traditional PCs to mobile devices .
&quot; HP , the world &apos;s second largest PC manufacturer and one of the largest US @-@ tech companies , is the latest in this area , based on the conviction that closely focused businesses provide better performance . &quot;
FC Arsen@@ al captain Mik@@ el Art@@ eta says that team@@ mates in front of the play against Dynam@@ o Zagreb have to stand behind the injured Jack Wil@@ sh@@ ere
&quot; Wen@@ ger emphas@@ ised Wil@@ sh@@ ere , that it was only September and if his rehabilitation is according to plan , there is no reason why he cannot play again before Christmas . &quot;
&quot; this optim@@ istic scenario already means that Wil@@ sh@@ ere will certainly miss at least the next four games for England and in view of its history , his participation in the next summer will surely be uncer@@ tain . &quot;
the great dis@@ grace in this current problem is that Wil@@ sh@@ ere had finished the last season after a separate ank@@ le injury and then returned to his old sw@@ ung during the pres@@ e@@ ason .
&quot; this kind of injury is not threatening the career , &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot;
it is a bone that does not heal well .
this is not a major issue .
this was just an accident .
it was not in connection with his an@@ kl@@ es or with the injuries he had previously .
&quot; this may be true from purely medical view , but as Wen@@ ger also recognized , there is the associated risk of further injuries , whenever a player tries to return in the middle of the season . &quot;
it also develops an unpleasant pattern .
Prime Minister In@@ j@@ uries Ltd investig@@ ates 23 different diseases of Wil@@ sh@@ ere since his debut six years ago .
he also played in only 65 of Arsen@@ al 157 Lig@@ ues in the last five seasons .
the wider picture for Arsen@@ al is that they were in six of eight playing times since 2007 / 08 one of the two Premier League clubs that have recorded most injuries .
&quot; Wen@@ ger accepts the potential of a vi@@ cious circle , but ar@@ sen@@ al believes that an improvement in the vulner@@ ability rate will last during the last season . &quot;
&quot; sometimes when you come back from an injury , you have a random@@ ly time period , a time in which you have to strengthen your body and win mar@@ tial force , &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot;
Jack is young enough to overcome this .
&quot; I hope his body stabili@@ zes , I am confident that he will do it and he will go through a career of the way he deserves . &quot;
Arsen@@ al starts its Champions League season on Wednesday evening against Din@@ amo Zagreb in front of the games against Chelsea on Saturday and against Tot@@ ten@@ ham Hot@@ spur next Wednesday and Wen@@ ger turns a rotation within the team .
&quot; H@@ é@@ c@@ tor Bell@@ er@@ ín and Aaron Ram@@ sey have not traveled to Croatia , meaning Math@@ ie@@ u Deb@@ u@@ chy and Art@@ eta are allowed to start . &quot;
Wen@@ ger can also begin with K@@ ier@@ an Gi@@ b@@ bs and Olivier Gi@@ ro@@ ud instead of Nach@@ o Mon@@ real and Theo Wal@@ cot@@ t .
&quot; I try to keep the balance and give players a little break @-@ up , &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot;
&quot; although Arsen@@ al &apos;s clear favorites are to go forward by group F , the Mak@@ si@@ mir Stadion in Zagreb is one of the play@@ grounds with the biggest in@@ timi@@ dating effect in Europe . &quot;
&quot; Dynam@@ o is also defeated after 41 games , after the &quot; inv@@ inci@@ ble &quot; campaign started in the last season . &quot;
&quot; the stadium was sh@@ aken on Tuesday night by an earthquake , which was measured on the Richter scale 3.2 . &quot;
this year it was the 10th in Zagreb .
Rau@@ e Firm of the Year for Information Technology Heu@@ king Küh@@ n Lü@@ er Wo@@ j@@ tek Firm of the Year for Private Equity &amp; Venture Capital
&quot; this drive is immense , &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot;
it never worked at Arsen@@ al .
&quot; we were very close in 2006 , but on the other hand I &apos;m long enough in business to be realistic . &quot;
&quot; we are ambitious , but we are not dre@@ am@@ ers . &quot;
Friend@@ s@@ Fest : com@@ edy Show that gave us serious lessons on men &apos;s friend@@ ships
&quot; the lack of similar represent@@ ations in shows is apparent , especially with regard to how the need for men to open themselves , now become more des@@ perate than ever before , such as self @-@ mor@@ ass among young men on a 15 @-@ year yo@@ ke . &quot;
&quot; in 2013 , it was the most important cause of death in men aged 20 to 45 in Great Britain , and it remains three times more common in men than in women . &quot;
&quot; in an effort to tackle the problem , Camp@@ aig@@ n Ag@@ ainst Living Mis@@ er@@ ably ( Cal@@ m - Camp@@ aig@@ n against a pi@@ tiful life ) 2015 announced as the year of the man , with the aim of asking the culture to question the men to seek help if they need them . &quot;
friendship is the heart of the battle to overcome this challenge .
&quot; a recent study with more than 2,000 high @-@ school students with depres@@ sive symptoms noticed that when the suffer@@ er had a sufficiently high percentage of friends with a &quot; healthy mood , &quot; his chances of recovery had doubled . &quot;
&quot; for those who are not de@@ pressed , a circle of mentally healthy friends hal@@ ves the risks of mental problems . &quot;
&quot; but of course you have to have friends , so that a friendship may work . &quot;
&quot; in the age of communication led by social media , with its emphasis on style about substance , the immedi@@ acy of the response is often more important than a meaningful contact . &quot;
&quot; our digital lives have the need to appear strong , life @-@ fun and successful , even if in reality the isolation domin@@ ates . &quot;
&quot; this super@@ ficial success is dominated by what psych@@ ologists call ex@@ trin@@ sic values ; money , image , social status , everything at the expense of in@@ trin@@ sic values - our inner longing for personal development and friendship that affects our mental health much more deeply . &quot;
&quot; and like a video game invent@@ or and billi@@ on@@ aire recently explained , money can really not buy happiness . &quot;
the beauty of Friends was that this focuss@@ ing was placed on the head .
&quot; every character was defined not by his work , but by his personality , shining through interaction as a friend . &quot;
&quot; the hum@@ our of Jo@@ ey and Ch@@ and@@ ler &apos;s frequent h@@ ug@@ s , moments during football matches in cozy arm@@ chairs and the longing of R@@ oss to Rachel - all this came out of the knowledge that men can refer to each case even though they are often rel@@ uc@@ t@@ ant to fully explore their feelings . &quot;
&quot; as an employee of teleph@@ ony care she explained to me : ... &quot; &quot; My hearing role for people who feel de@@ pressed and at risk of self @-@ murder , really showed me how even the smallest interactions of friends can make a difference . &quot;
the men who contact us often don &apos;t feel able to talk to friends .
&quot; the old saying &quot; &quot; I come along with it &quot; &quot; has an enormous effect , like the feeling that it is perceived as a weakness when talking about problems openly . &quot;
friends is one of the shows that come to my mind when I try to offer long @-@ term cop@@ ing management mechanisms .
she presents quite clearly the small moments of men &apos;s friend@@ ships .
&quot; so much my objective out@@ sider status about the phone may help people in moments of desp@@ air too , the long @-@ term support comes from a personal network of family and friends . &quot;
&quot; so if you visit Com@@ edy Central Friend@@ s@@ Fest this weekend with the highlight of the day completely re@@ designed scenery , why not take your friends to a drink in Central Per@@ k . &quot;
&quot; or even better , if you sit in Star@@ bu@@ cks someone alone , give him a smile and say h@@ ello . &quot;
you never know what difference your friendship could make .
friends will be sent to Com@@ edy Central from the beginning to the end - all 236 epis@@ odes - for # Friend@@ s@@ Fest
di Maria meets to help PSG to disman@@ tle Malm@@ ö
angel Di Maria celebrates with Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i and Ed@@ inson Cav@@ ani following his hit against Malm@@ ö .
di Maria meets at his debut in the Champions League on Tuesday and helps PSG to pass over Malm@@ ö .
here are the game report and the reaction to the game .
angel Di Maria and Ed@@ inson Cav@@ ani took course when Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main started his Champions League season with a very comfortable 2 @-@ 0 victory against Malm@@ ö in the Prin@@ zen@@ park@@ st@@ adion on Tuesday .
&quot; less than four minutes after the start of his Champions League Deb@@ ü@@ ts , di Maria sc@@ ored the French champion , but afterwards they missed a number of occasions before they finally increased their lead when Cav@@ ani claimed a head @-@ board in the 6@@ 1st minute . &quot;
&quot; with Real Madrid and Sch@@ acht@@ j@@ or Don@@ et@@ sk also in group A , Paris also takes a strong start against Swedish champion , since it is not only the qualification for the kno@@ ck@@ out rounds , but an improvement on the way to the quar@@ ter@@ fin@@ als in each of the last three campaigns . &quot;
&quot; but while they got the points , it was not a classic game from Laurent Blan@@ cs team with Zlat@@ an I@@ bra@@ him@@ o@@ vic@@ s missed chances in front of the gate . he was later replaced in the game against his hom@@ etown team and against the association with which he began his illustri@@ ous career in 1999 . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s not easy to win at home or abroad in the Champions League . therefore it &apos;s a good start to win 2 : 0 , cause our opponents to cause problems and look back even if there are certain things that we have to perf@@ ecting during the season , &quot; &quot; said Blanc . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is a good sign . &quot;
&quot; we wanted to win and we won , although I regret that we did not score one or two more goals . &quot;
&quot; after his injury , I@@ bra@@ him@@ ovic returned to the Paris team after his injury , which was held on the weekend a 2 : 2 Draw on his own place against Bordeaux in the First League , but he was engraved by Di Maria in the fourth minute . &quot;
&quot; the Argent@@ ine@@ an imp@@ eller was described as the man who can take the PSG to the next stage in Europe , when he went into the last month of Manchester United , and he pointed out why when he finished in Marco Ver@@ rat@@ tis Pass behind the Malm@@ ö def@@ ensive , before he passed off to Johan Wil@@ and in the long corner of the network . &quot;
&quot; however , if someone believed that PSG would achieve a great victory , he was disappointed . &quot;
&quot; Malm@@ ö that hit the Celtic in a play @-@ off to reach this stage , joined An@@ pi@@ ff with nine national players on the field and was armed with a five @-@ man defense and two deep in the middle field . &quot;
&quot; but except a shot by Nik@@ ola D@@ jur@@ dj@@ ic , who passed far to Kevin Tr@@ app &apos;s post in the 34@@ th minute , they offered little in the attack . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , PSG himself sometimes found himself on , with some mis@@ ses and bad connections , not least by I@@ bra@@ him@@ ovic , who was scrat@@ ched only in the first half in the first half and then abandoned after Cav@@ ani had put him after re@@ boot . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , he proved a lot more skill when he brought his fellow players into the game , and it was a pass by I@@ bra@@ him@@ ovic , which Di Maria turned into a shot , which was passed by Wil@@ and in the 5@@ 2nd minute on the pole ... &quot;
the second goal finally fell short after the hour stamp thanks to Cav@@ ani . the Urugu@@ ay@@ er achieved his sixth overall goal after I@@ bra@@ him@@ ovic had stab@@ bed a lef@@ tist flan@@ k of Max@@ well .
&quot; that ended all the thoughts that Malm@@ ö can come back into play , and only an excellent intervention of Wil@@ and from the shortest distance to stop David Lu@@ iz , could keep the final result low before sub@@ stitutes E@@ z@@ equi@@ el Lav@@ e@@ zzi finished a goal at the end . &quot;
&quot; the trainer from Malm@@ ö , Age Har@@ ei@@ de , later admitted that PSG played a class about his team and the Norwegian said : &quot; our last champion league game was last year in December . &quot;
&quot; since then , we have played only in the Swedish League that has not the same level . &quot;
the qualifying matches are not enough . &quot;
hat off before Paris !
it was a great game of them !
Gl@@ enc@@ ore coll@@ ects 2.5 billion $ through stock sales
&quot; the local mining giant , Gl@@ enc@@ ore , based in Switzerland , was hit by a stock sales of 2.5 billion dollars on Wednesday , as part of its huge debt rep@@ ay@@ ment plan . &quot;
&quot; the company Gl@@ enc@@ ore , registered in London , said in an explanation that it has sold new shares amoun@@ ting to about 1.6 billion £ in order to pay off its own debts . &quot;
&quot; the company , which has lost 57 percent of its market value this year , is struggling with falling commodity prices , as China &apos;s economic down@@ turn expresses the demand and devast@@ ating markets . &quot;
the issu@@ ing rights issue brought Gl@@ en@@ cores Akti@@ enk@@ ump@@ ur in trading on early Wednesday morning a rapid increase to the top of the London Stock Exchange .
&quot; the share j@@ ump@@ ed by 2.@@ 77 percent to 13@@ 1,@@ 60 p@@ ence on the FT@@ SE 100 index , which opened 0.@@ 69 percent higher . &quot;
&quot; for last week , Gl@@ enc@@ ore had announced the 2.5 billion $ share sale as part of the more comprehensive plans to cut around a third of its $ 30 billion debt . &quot;
&quot; the company sold the new shar@@ ehol@@ dings to 125 p@@ ence per share , which meant a 2.4 percent discount on the closing course on Tuesday . &quot;
there were 1.3 billion shares worth up to 9.@@ 99 percent of the group .
&quot; concerns regarding long @-@ term growth in China have reduced iron ore prices by about half , coal , copper , and other raw material prices declined by 20 to 40 percent . &quot;
refugees arrive in Weimar
&quot; on Tuesday , 49 people reach the town administration in Weimar after a mostly long run . &quot;
&quot; the refugees are from Syria , Albania , Afghanistan , Macedonia and Somalia . &quot;
the youngest descend@@ ant is a six month old girl from Syria .

a 29 @-@ year @-@ old wanted to fulfil a dream and got a Ford Must@@ ang .
on the rain @-@ wet highway then the evil awakening came .
&quot; with a company in the district of Got@@ ha , one can meet the dream and once again bor@@ row a V8 American sport@@ scar Ford Must@@ ang Boss 302 with 440 hp . &quot;
so this also did a 29 @-@ year @-@ old from the district of Got@@ ha .
&quot; on the A 71 at Arn@@ stadt , the dream came and passed . &quot;
&quot; the 29 @-@ year @-@ old lost control of the sports car , got wet on wet track to spin and drove into the tail plane . &quot;

&quot; the atomic damage is estimated at 4@@ 0,000 EUR . &quot;
X@@ avi : PE@@ P Guardi@@ ola stopped 2008 change to FC Bayern
world and European champion X@@ avi has been playing for the al @-@ S@@ in Sport Club in Qatar since summer 2015
&quot; obviously a few years ago , the FC Bayern was just before the commitment of Spain super@@ star X@@ avi , who then played for FC Barcelona . &quot;
&quot; eight times Spanish champion , three times champion winner , four Champions League winners , twice Club World Champion , twice World Champion , twice World Champion - the title list of X@@ avi is breathtaking . &quot;
&quot; in summer , the 35 @-@ year @-@ old left FC Barcelona after 24 years and moved to the al @-@ S@@ coo@@ by Sport Club in Qatar . &quot;
&quot; but in an interview with Mar@@ ca , X@@ avi now betra@@ ys that he stood before the end of 2008 before the departure from Barcelona . &quot;
one told me that Bar@@ ça wanted to sell me .
&quot; Madrid then won everything , we had nothing , &quot; he says . &quot;
and that also registered the FC Bayern .
X@@ avi : &quot; there was an offer of Bavaria . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Rum@@ men@@ ig@@ ge wanted me to have me . &quot;
in the summer of 2008 Jürgen Klin@@ smann took over the FC Bayern .
Guardi@@ ola was the reason that X@@ avi did not change
but the change did not come about .
and the decisive man for that works today for the German record champion : PE@@ P Guardi@@ ola .
&quot; X@@ avi says why : &quot; &quot; Bar@@ ça has taken Guardi@@ ola under contract and I played a great EM . &quot;
PE@@ P told me that I wouldn &apos;t change that he could not imagine the crew without me .
&quot; with that he has prev@@ ailed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
who knows how Bavaria &apos;s Play@@ time 2008 / 2009 would have run with X@@ avi .
&quot; X@@ avi stand@@ ings for Bar@@ ca in the quar@@ ter@@ fin@@ als of the Champions League against Bavaria over the whole distance on the lawn , split the reds ( 4 : 0 , 1 : 1 ) and celebrated the King &apos;s Triumph at the end . &quot;
matt Dam@@ on plays variety in creating movies
matt Dam@@ on con@@ front the African film@@ maker Eff@@ ie Brown during a discussion about diversity and said she will not be needed behind the scenes .
&quot; during a series of Sunday Night of H@@ B@@ OS Project green@@ light , experienced actor Brown emphasized that this was the need for alternative perspectives on a black protagon@@ ist in the chosen scenario of the project . &quot;
&quot; when we talk about diversity , do it with the occupation of the film and not with the lin@@ eup of the show , &quot; Dam@@ on assured . &quot;
&quot; brown re@@ ag@@ ered shock@@ ed , with insul@@ ted un@@ belief and called &quot; Ho@@ o ! wow . okay , &quot; as the comments of the act@@ ress of The Mar@@ tian captiv@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; Dam@@ on and Brown joined Ben Aff@@ l@@ eck and the Far@@ rel@@ ly Brothers , to discuss the show fin@@ alists . &quot;
&quot; I would like to ask people to think about it - whoever will always be the director - as they treat the figure of Harmon@@ y , &quot; &quot; said Brown . &quot;
&quot; the only black person , and she is a sp@@ line , which is beaten by her white hal@@ ves . &quot;
&quot; the producer of Dear White People stood for the fin@@ alists Leo Angel@@ os and Kri@@ sten Bran@@ c@@ accio for direc@@ ting rights to the film . Dam@@ on said that &quot; &quot; in the end their direction &quot; &quot; could give us something we don &apos;t want . &quot;
&quot; after the discussion was broadcast , the social media explo@@ ded against Dam@@ on &apos;s comments . &quot;
&quot; Twitter user Mr Po@@ oni expressed his anger about the clip by saying &quot; Matt Dam@@ on talks about the only black person in the room , so he can explain their diversity - that &apos;s SO NO@@ W@@ ING that it hur@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; the twe@@ et served over 5,000 re@@ we@@ ets and 4,000 Li@@ kes since its release . &quot;
Dam@@ on &apos;s comments come at a time when the exact r@@ acial representation in the media is at the head of the social discussion .
&quot; after teen@@ age Michael Brown was killed by a white police in 2014 , the movement Black Li@@ ves Matter was nation@@ wide , and urged leg@@ is@@ lators and authorities to stop discri@@ min@@ atory practices against col@@ oni@@ alism . &quot;
in February the singer Prince made an all@@ usion to the movement during the introduction of the nominated albums of the year at the Gram@@ my Awards .
&quot; albums still matter , &quot; ( albums still have their meaning ) he said . &quot;
&quot; like books and black life , albums still have their meaning . &quot;
&quot; more recently , leaders of the Movement Black Li@@ ves Matter have published an explanation in response to the question of the Fox News personality , Elisabeth Hassel@@ beck , whether the group should be regarded as a hate group . &quot;
&quot; the network Black Li@@ ves Matter is a group of love , &quot; said the leaders . &quot;
&quot; recently , it was announced that Dam@@ on was on a list of enter@@ tain@@ ers , producers and media writers who are invited to visit the pop@@ e to discuss the depic@@ tion of the Catholic Church in the West . &quot;
whether he accepted the invitation or has already met the Pope is uncle@@ ar .
&apos;@@ American Nin@@ ja Warrior &apos; Crow@@ ns First Champion
&quot; professional sports clim@@ bers and operating help Isaac Cal@@ di@@ ero became the first ath@@ l@@ ete , who won the American Nin@@ ja Warrior on Monday evening and took home the Grand Prix of $ 1 million . &quot;
&quot; the competition @-@ show , which just finished their 7th season , had never experienced a competition participant who could finish all stages of his obstacle course . &quot;
&quot; during the season @-@ fin@@ als , there were two men , Cal@@ di@@ ero and cam@@ er@@ aman , Ge@@ off Brit@@ ten , until the finale . &quot;
the last task was to climb a 75 foot climbing rope in 30 seconds .
&quot; Brit@@ ten finished the task within the time he was the first ath@@ l@@ ete , who finished the exhau@@ sting phase 4 of American Nin@@ ja Warrior . however , Cal@@ di@@ ero finished this challenge full three seconds faster , which made him the winner . &quot;
&quot; Cal@@ di@@ ero spoke with E ! messages after the hard fought win , still under shock over the profit of the Grand Prix of 1 Million $ . &quot;
&quot; I mean it &apos;s amazing to think about it , I &apos;ve never earned or had more than 10,000 $ or had to live , &quot; said Isaac E ! about his lot of money . &quot;
so suddenly .. as I can &apos;t even imagine how that is ... the future is unknown .
&quot; the leading producer K@@ ent We@@ ed sat down with The Hollywood Repor@@ ter to discuss the finale and why Brit@@ ten , even though he first finished the course , did not receive any prize money . &quot;
after the rules the money goes to the fastest person .
&quot; if there is more than one fin@@ alist , it gets the one with the fastest time , &quot; We@@ ed said . &quot;
&quot; how much money is a wonderful price and changes life , he receives the great gratu@@ ity . &quot;
I don &apos;t think he wins some gru@@ dge about it .
he is just so happy to have done what he has done .
he received many awards from fans .
he is such a great guy and a family father .
he is a hero for his children and his wife .
&quot; Ge@@ off said to me : &quot; &quot; if I should be beaten by someone , then I &apos;m glad that Isaac is Isaac . &quot;
and I think Isaac felt the same when they had changed the roles .
&quot; America Nin@@ ja Warrior was extended for an eighth season , the shooting starts in spring 2016 . &quot;
Detroit Tig@@ ers pass over Minn@@ es@@ ota Tw@@ ins
MIN@@ NE@@ AP@@ OL@@ IS@@ --@@ The second half of the season was not particularly funny for the Detroit Tig@@ ers .
&quot; once they were one of the best teams in bas@@ eb@@ all , today the Tig@@ ers stand on the last place in the American League Central . &quot;
&quot; the tig@@ ers are reduced to their role as spo@@ ilers , however , this part played perfectly against the Minn@@ es@@ ota Tw@@ ins with 5 @-@ 4 in target field on Tuesday . &quot;
the Tw@@ ins lost a chance for as@@ cen@@ sion within one hal@@ ve of Houston Ast@@ ros for the second American League Wild@@ card .
&quot; Detroit , if only for one evening , it was a return of the three letter F @-@ word that was so difficult to grasp over a large part of the second half of the season . &quot;
&quot; all vic@@ tories are fun , no matter how it comes , &quot; said Tig@@ ers Manager Brad Pron@@ eness . &quot;
&quot; tiger @-@ Pit@@ cher Al@@ fre@@ do Simon held his early offensive support , when Detroit sc@@ ored three times in the first two inn@@ ings , then once in the sixth and then again in the ninth . &quot;
Simon ( 13 @-@ 9 ) struck 6 times in the 1 / 3 Inn@@ ings and allowed three R@@ uns .
it was only his third successful start in his last nine games .
&quot; I want to end this year , &quot; &quot; said Simon . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s hard to throw in the bull@@ se@@ ye of any game , and therefore I want to go very concentrated into the game . &quot;
&quot; the designated tiger @-@ h@@ itter Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z had three hits and was in two ranks , his first round since mid @-@ August . &quot;
&quot; it was the first triple hit game by Mart@@ ine@@ z , since he had four hits against the Seattle Marin@@ ers on July 6 . &quot;
&quot; he has sw@@ ung the wood , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; he looked good at the ( punch training ) , looked much better in the bull@@ se@@ ye , and he brought it straight into the game . &quot;
with three R@@ uns in the h@@ ind at the end of the seventh inside the Tw@@ ins had their best chance to come back into play .
center F@@ iel@@ der B@@ yr@@ on Bu@@ x@@ ton finished the inning with a double on the left field line .
&quot; right F@@ iel@@ der Aaron H@@ icks reached a B@@ unt , and Simon brought his second bas@@ eman Brian Do@@ zier to Stri@@ ke@@ out before being replaced by the left @-@ handed Bla@@ ine Har@@ dy . &quot;
&quot; Har@@ dy ran the wall , the only man he was confronted with , in front of the design@@ ate R@@ ook@@ ie @-@ drummer Miguel S@@ ano , who took a two @-@ run away from the right @-@ handed Dre@@ w Ver@@ h@@ agen . &quot;
with a pair of runners and the end @-@ run the second Bas@@ eman Tre@@ vor Pl@@ ou@@ ffe brought the third Bas@@ eman Tre@@ vor Pl@@ ou@@ ffe to a double play .
it was the 27th time in the Major League for the 27th time in this season that Pl@@ ou@@ ffe beat a double play
&quot; after Detroit added a Insurance Run at the end of the ninth Inn@@ ings , Wall created an R@@ BI double against the C@@ loser of the Tig@@ ers Bruce Ron@@ don and sc@@ ored the stand of 5 @-@ 4 . &quot;
&quot; the right @-@ handed , however , stab@@ bed S@@ ano with three Pit@@ ches for its fifth save . &quot;
Detroit was pro@@ filed for the pr@@ el@@ ude of the game from an even non @-@ moving Phil Hu@@ gh@@ es .
&quot; the Tig@@ ers achieved three R@@ uns in the first two inn@@ ings against the right @-@ handed veter@@ an , who had been removed from the vulner@@ ability list before the game , after he had been missing more than a month because of a back @-@ suffering . &quot;
&quot; obviously not the beginning I wished for , &quot; Hu@@ gh@@ es said , &quot; but I felt more comfortable when I laid off and felt that I would create some pretty good Pit@@ ches there in the third inning . &quot;
&quot; after receiving the Le@@ ad@@ off Bat@@ ter in the first time , Hus@@ ks gave a single to Second Bas@@ eman Ian Kin@@ sler . &quot;
&quot; a Two @-@ Out Walk for J@@ .D. Mart@@ ine@@ z brought Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z into the game , creating a single &quot; up the middle &quot; at the first run of the game . &quot;
Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z made his 0 @-@ 21 successful series with the runner in the sc@@ oring position .
&quot; the third b@@ az@@ eman Nick Castell@@ anos followed with a single on the right , managed another run , but Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z was thrown out of the game when he tried to get to the third , which ended the threat . &quot;
&quot; in the second , the Tig@@ ers made a One @-@ Out Double by Cat@@ cher James Mc@@ C@@ ann and a Two @-@ Out Single from Center @-@ F@@ iel@@ der Anthony G@@ ose to the 3 @-@ 0 . &quot;
&quot; that was a big blow , &quot; &quot; said Tw@@ ins @-@ Manager Paul Mol@@ itor . &quot;
&quot; he has not beaten very well , but he has caught the right place . &quot;
&quot; Hu@@ gh@@ es was in a pitch @-@ count , sc@@ ored no points in the third inning before being replaced by A.@@ J.@@ A@@ chter &apos;s rel@@ ic . &quot;
at Hu@@ gh@@ es there were three R@@ uns with six hits and a walk with four ropes .
notes : Tig@@ ers R@@ HP Ani@@ bal San@@ che@@ z retired due to a violation of the throw @-@ off@@ s .
he is examined by Dr. James Andre@@ ws who operated the San@@ che@@ z shoulder in 2007 .
&quot; San@@ che@@ z , on the vulner@@ ability list since mid @-@ August because of a shoulder @-@ tear , is to be activated for the start on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; with San@@ che@@ z from the game , L@@ HP Daniel Morris is removed from the frag@@ rant list to start the Tw@@ ins . &quot;
Nor@@ ris with 1 @-@ 1 at four starts with the Tig@@ ers since he was purchased in exchange with L@@ HP David Price on July 30
he has been missing since 20 August because of a distortion in the right hip joint .
the Tig@@ ers and the Tw@@ ins will finish their series of three games in the Target Field on Wednesday

hundreds of refugees are supposed to fall in Wiesbaden
a train with hundreds of refugees is on the way to H@@ esse .
his arrival was expected for the night on Wednesday .
&quot; the people who arrived in it should then be accommod@@ ated in emergency shel@@ ters in Wiesbaden , as the City of Wiesbaden announced on Tuesday evening . &quot;
it counted for refugees with 450 to 750 refugees .
several sports halls of the Hes@@ sian state capital were prepared for this case in recent days .
up to 1000 refugees can temporarily be accommod@@ ated .
they shall then be distributed to other municipalities .
&quot; in the past ten days alone , according to the government president responsible for the initial survey , 7@@ 500 people have arrived in H@@ esse . &quot;
&quot; due to the large number of refugees , Frankfurt and Han@@ au also set up emergency shel@@ ters in sports halls . &quot;
Isch@@ inger : German military action in Syria an option
&quot; the head of the Munich Security Conference , Wolfgang Isch@@ inger , holds military action with German involvement in Syria for a possibility . &quot;
&quot; I believe the determined thinking about military action options must not take place without Germany , &quot; he said . &quot;
he accused the European states of &quot; collective path@@ ways . &quot;
four years ago we were happy that the ch@@ ali@@ ce passed by military participation in Germany .
&quot; now the conflict sh@@ ines ahead of our front door , &quot; he said in Deutschl@@ and@@ funk . &quot;
the former German ambassador in Washington also called for a massive increase in international assistance on site for refugees .
Austria controls southern and eastern borders
&quot; after Germany , Austria again introduced controls on its southern and eastern fron@@ tiers . &quot;
&quot; Austrian Minister of Foreign Affairs Johanna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner declared on Tuesday evening in the Austrian television station OR@@ F , no one has been sent back to Hungary . &quot;
Germany also returned no refugees to Austria .
&quot; no , this is so arranged , &quot; she explained . &quot;
&quot; on the question of an agreement that Germany could record a certain number of refugees from Austria a day , Mik@@ l Leit@@ ner said there have already been discussions between the General Director for Public Security and representatives of Germany . &quot;
she did not call concrete figures and referred to talks on Wednesday in Berlin .
&quot; in recent days , tens of thousands of refugees have come to Austria via the so @-@ called Balkan route from Hungary . &quot;
your goal is mostly Germany .
Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) and her Austrian colleague Werner F@@ ay@@ mann filed a special summit for next week with several other EU heads of state and government .
Germany started on Sunday with temporary fron@@ tier controls .
the EU states have so far failed to agree on a joint action in the crisis .
the EU interior ministers want to take a new approach to the binding distribution of another 120 000 refugees next Tuesday ( 22 September ) .
&quot; in view of the strong refugee ship in Germany , the federal government wants to support the countries in the initial survey and distribution of people . &quot;
&quot; the Con@@ federation will manage this together with the countries , Merkel proclaimed the late evening after almost four @-@ hour consult@@ ations with the Prime Minister in the Chancellor Office in Berlin . &quot;
&quot; Merkel under@@ lined , those people who need protection , conf@@ ess this too . &quot;
but those who do not have a lead @-@ perspective cannot remain in Germany .
this point of view had been squ@@ ee@@ zed in the round .
the chan@@ cell@@ or stressed that the state as a whole must now face a &quot; huge effort . &quot;
thousands of des@@ perate refugees are now stuck on the Balkans .
Hungary closed its 175 kilometres long border with Serbia on Tuesday night .
&quot; a few hours later , the government in Budapest announced to set up the border with Romania with a fence . &quot;
this neighbour country is different from Serbia to the EU .
Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to said Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to to the planned new border fence .
the Romanian government immediately condemned the plan .
there were first ar@@ rests of people who had c@@ utt@@ led the fence .
&quot; according to e@@ ye@@ witness reports in Turkey , thousands of other migrants lost their way to the Greek border . &quot;
spatial Probe &quot; Cass@@ ini &quot; finds Ocean on Satur@@ n@@ mond En@@ cel@@ a@@ dus
under the ice @-@ tail of the Satur@@ n@@ moon En@@ cel@@ a@@ dus asc@@ ends a global ocean .
these include researchers from observations of the spac@@ ecraft &quot; Cass@@ ini . &quot;
&quot; therefore , the moon changes easily on its way around the ring plan@@ ets . &quot;
&quot; although this exchange movement is only small , but still too big for an almost solid cel@@ esti@@ al body , it is said in a message from the Corn@@ ell University in I@@ th@@ aca ( US State New York ) of Tuesday . &quot;
the researchers present their analyses in the journal &quot; I@@ car@@ us . &quot;
&quot; for a long time , it was known that there must be liquid water under the iron cover of En@@ cel@@ a@@ dus . &quot;
&quot; that way , &quot; Cass@@ ini &quot; had already discovered ice volcan@@ oes at the South Pole of the Satur@@ n@@ moon in 2006 , par@@ rots the water vap@@ or and ice particles , thus feeding the so @-@ called E @-@ Ring of Saturn . &quot;
&quot; at least at the South Pole , there must be a sub@@ terranean sea , the astronom@@ ers closed back then . &quot;
&quot; however , the expansion of the hidden ocean was not clear . &quot;
R@@ ama missing in 1860 München for several weeks
the 1860 München must ab@@ stain from Val@@ det R@@ ama for about one month .
the association with the 27 @-@ year @-@ old gave an investigation into the association with the 27 @-@ year @-@ old .
&quot; at the beginning of the week , R@@ ama compl@@ ained about pain . &quot;
&quot; according to the Munich lion , the diagnosis &quot; is expected to break four weeks of forced break . &quot; &quot;
&quot; that makes us hard , R@@ ama is a her@@ ber loss . &quot;
&quot; of course , we have to think about now , &quot; said Sports Director N@@ ec@@ at Ay@@ gü@@ n of the &quot; Bild &quot; newspaper with a look at the possible commitment of a united professionals . &quot;
&quot; as a train@@ ee , the six@@ ties initially presented a def@@ ensive man . &quot;
the 30 @-@ year @-@ old Hr@@ vo@@ je C@@ ale was last active in Belgium and was under contract before the V@@ f@@ L Wolfs@@ burg .
&quot; at present , the Cro@@ at has the possibility to prove his skill . &quot;
tor@@ ch Ruby Ok@@ ot@@ ie can return to the team training next week after its bra@@ in@@ shock .
already on Thursday the Austrian national player should enter the running training .
Ok@@ ot@@ ie had injured himself in the game at Fort@@ una Düsseldorf ( 0 : 3 ) .
&quot; against the first fears , however , he remained without a serious bl@@ iss . &quot;
no diet fruit - man@@ goes contain plenty of sugar
man@@ gos are exotic and ju@@ icy @-@ sweet .
&quot; but he who wants to pay attention to his slim line , he is often dis@@ cour@@ aged by them . &quot;
because man@@ goes contain relatively much sugar - especially su@@ cro@@ se .
&quot; the exotic fruits are healthy nevertheless : in them B vitamins , as well as vitamins E and C. In particular , Man@@ go contains a lot of vitamin A and its prec@@ ursor Beta car@@ ot@@ ene . &quot;
&quot; for those who e@@ ats the fruits , thus supports visual strength , immune system and met@@ abolic processes within the body . &quot;
&quot; when buying , man@@ go should not be too soft or too tight and smell pleasant . &quot;
the shell @-@ color alone does not tell about how ripe fruit is - so green man@@ goes can taste delicious .
they should be stored at room temperature and consumed within a few days .
then they taste naturally pure or in sweet foods .
a man@@ go also gives sav@@ ory dishes a special touch .
it sof@@ tens the slightly bitter taste of some Bl@@ at@@ ts@@ al@@ ate like Chic@@ or@@ ee and Radi@@ c@@ cio .

&quot; in view of the bo@@ oming online business U@@ PS and its competi@@ tor Fed@@ Ex have been taking precau@@ tions since last year , in order to be prepared for the Christmas business . &quot;

&quot; first blow @-@ storm , then marked Kalt@@ front &quot;
&quot; in the coming night , in the valleys of the mountain side of the fo@@ eh@@ n , how Met@@ e@@ o@@ Swiss rus@@ hed out on Tuesday . &quot;
on Wednesday and in the night to Thursday the fo@@ eh@@ n blow@@ s partially with storm strength through the fo@@ oth@@ ills .
&quot; after F@@ öhn@@ ende on Thursday morning we cross a striking cold front , which brings powerful ra@@ inf@@ alls , wind gu@@ sts and a temperature decline . &quot;
&quot; as Met@@ e@@ o@@ News writes in a message , Switzerland is currently on the front of an extensive deep @-@ pressure region over the British Is@@ les in a powerful southwest stream . &quot;
on the mountain side of the Alps it breaks through the valleys at night to the Wednesday of the F@@ öh@@ n .
&quot; as a result , the fo@@ eh@@ n blow@@ s until Thursday morning in the fo@@ oth@@ ills with Bö@@ en from 60 to 100 km / h , isolated and especially in the Ur@@ ner@@ land partly also with more than 100 km / h . &quot;
&quot; the F@@ öh@@ n can enter into the adjacent Mitt@@ ell@@ and , and on the mountains , even or@@ kan@@ cs of more than 120 km / h are possible . &quot;
&quot; while in the north on Wednesday stor@@ my hair dri@@ es for summer temperatures of 23 to 27 degrees , the moisture begins to st@@ ew on the mountain bed . &quot;
here is the rain that lasts until Thursday evening .
&quot; in the south of the Alps , in the next 48 hours , some more than 100 litres of rain per square meter must be expected , this after a large amount of ra@@ inf@@ all over the last few days . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday morning the blow proceeds from the air , as a result a cold front coils with strong , partly swe@@ at@@ y ra@@ inf@@ all from west to east over Switzerland . &quot;
&quot; along with the cold front the wind blow@@ s strongly until turbul@@ ent , and the temperatures go far back . &quot;
&quot; the following days present themselves in the north with 15 to 20 degrees , on the other hand , on weekends it will be sunny and warmer with up to 25 degrees . &quot;
Rome now has a Martin @-@ Luther @-@ Platz
&quot; almost 500 years after the Reformation , there is now a Martin Luther pl@@ aza in Rome . &quot;
&quot; in the presence of city president Ign@@ azi@@ o Marino , a previously nam@@ eless place in the park on the O@@ pp@@ io Hill was christ@@ ened on the name of the German Re@@ formers . &quot;
&quot; at the &quot; Piazza Martin Lu@@ ter@@ o , &quot; he is now honored as a &quot; German The@@ ologi@@ an of the Reformation . &quot; &quot;
the park is located in the middle of the old Rome right next to the Col@@ os@@ se@@ um .
the nam@@ ing was applied by the work community of the Protestant churches in Rome .
&quot; on Wednesday , Jens @-@ Martin Kr@@ use , past@@ or of the Evangel@@ ical Lutheran Church in Rome , reminded that the Protest@@ ants in the city of the Pop@@ es could not live only in seclu@@ sion for centuries as a minority . &quot;
&quot; in a symbolic way , the square will become visible in a symbolic way that their tradition of Christian faith in Rome is welcome . &quot;
Martin Luther ( 14@@ 83 @-@ 15@@ 46 ) stayed in Rome as a young August@@ inian mon@@ k around the year 15@@ 10 / 11 several months in Rome .
he then received the city as a promised s@@ inner @-@ be@@ ak at that time .
his negative impressions were sc@@ ored by histori@@ ans in his later fight against Rome .
&quot; with his theses , Luther started the division of the western church with his theses . &quot;
hammer artist spent three years in the personal interpretation of the Bible
Jesus with the ( gold plated ) crown is one of the master@@ pieces painted by Ot@@ mar Alt for his Bible .
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost has written the introduction and updated Bible texts .
in the beginning was the Word ?
&quot; no , not with the Ot@@ mar @-@ Old Bible , which is now published with gorgeous pictures . &quot;
&quot; in the beginning was the picture for Ot@@ mar Alt , who formulated his very personal interpre@@ tations of biblical stories on paper and canvas in 150 motifs . &quot;
his &quot; language &quot; with colorful colors and imagin@@ ative forms has preserved the 75 @-@ year @-@ old - but which is by no means syn@@ onymous with &quot; funny &quot; pictures .
&quot; on the contrary : adapted to the respective topics , this can be quite glo@@ omy . &quot;
&quot; for about three years Ot@@ mar Alt worked on his Bible project , for which he has taken a subjective @-@ artistic choice from the many theme areas of the &quot; Book of Books . &quot; &quot;
&quot; cycles arose which dev@@ ote themselves to topics such as cross way , pl@@ agues , commandments or fa@@ ther@@ hood . &quot;
&quot; he immediately fascinated several partners : this applies to Luther @-@ Verlag with its the@@ ological orientation , as well as for the Kettler publishing house with its emphasis on art books . &quot;
&quot; and there is , above all , the author Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost , who studied painting on the basis of painting with the respective Bible passages . &quot;
&quot; he interpreted the Bible passages from Ot@@ mar Old and thus translated into today , in current contex@@ ts . &quot;
these texts are like verbal mirror by Al@@ ts P@@ ainting .
&quot; embedded between the original Bible quote by Martin Luther and a set of the artist , who formulated his very personal thoughts on the respective situation . &quot;
the jewelry cord has golden letters .
&quot; thus , the 75 @-@ year @-@ old gives twice a deep insight into his soul , his emotions . &quot;
this is a high degree of intim@@ acy .
&quot; ultimately , emotions were ultimately trig@@ gers for the Bible project : Ot@@ mar Alt , born 1940 in Wern@@ ig@@ ero@@ de and grew up in Berlin , comes from a family that belonged to the strict Protestant sovereign religious order . &quot;
&quot; since the education happened already with the cane &quot; , &quot; Ot@@ mar Alt re@@ members . &quot;
I tried to re@@ vise this so as to bring myself back with the Lord &apos;s father .
&quot; his second concern is to make art again more important in fast @-@ moving times : &quot; the perception of image worlds is shaped by advertising , and it is no@@ isy . &quot;
symbol@@ ism is being displac@@ ed .
artists have a different desire and pleasure to show things .
pictures always have something mysterious and are not decorative .
&quot; in this respect , I am a din@@ osau@@ r . &quot;
&quot; Ot@@ mar Alt wants to let the viewers fall into the pictures , let them look at them , discover and sense what force they have : &quot; the picture seeks his counter@@ part . &quot;
&quot; Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost opened on Tuesday at the presentation of the Ot@@ mar Old Bible in the Ot@@ mar Alt Foundation , &quot; always &quot; a lover of Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts art : &quot; I like how he compreh@@ ends life with his pictures . &quot;
&quot; I did not care to fully grasp the Bible , but also selected the most important , mysterious topics . &quot;
&quot; this was not a collaboration on eye level , &quot; says Alt@@ ep@@ ost : &quot; here it &apos;s about the pictures , the text only explains . &quot; a Picture Bible was created . &quot;
&quot; for Hans Mö@@ h@@ ler from Luther @-@ Verlag , this work is an invitation to deep@@ en his life and to find freedom . &quot;
Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts &apos;s pictures speak for Mö@@ h@@ ler both the ( biblical ) language of love and the responsibility .
&quot; a part of the origin@@ als - paper and canvas images - will be presented for the first time in an exhibition , which will be opened in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Stiftung on November 15th . &quot;
start of construction for BM@@ X
&quot; a year later almost everything was finished - but before the official opening of the BM@@ X track , it was already finished . &quot;
&quot; fail@@ ures in politics and administration ensured the dr@@ au@@ ght , especially among the residents who did not toler@@ ate the train . &quot;
&quot; so hill bev@@ elled , new place wanted - now with formal planning and application for building permission . &quot;
&quot; the approval will be received in October , the first municipal counc@@ ill@@ or Sabine Mos@@ eb@@ ach @-@ Bo@@ ck has now been able to communicate in the children &apos;s and youth affairs committee . &quot;
&quot; I hope this year will happen again , &quot; she said . &quot;
it should then be started without &quot; further remembrance &quot; with the work of the former indoor swimming pool .
DF@@ B intensi@@ fies engagement for refugees
&quot; the DF@@ B extends its commitment to refugees by 2019 , while the Bundes@@ liga puts a clear sign on the weekend . &quot;
the football team re@@ acts to the rising situation in Germany and sec@@ ures its help in tac@@ kling the problems that arise .
&quot; I think this is the biggest challenge in our country since re@@ unification . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; in principle no one can say that nothing is about me , I have nothing to do with it . &quot;
&quot; this must be interesting for everyone to get a grip on this topic , &quot; &quot; said DF@@ B CEO Wolfgang Nier@@ sbach . &quot;
&quot; at the annual meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel on 23 September in Berlin , he intends to discuss the refugee situation in Germany intensively . &quot;
&quot; I am in the chan@@ cell@@ or next Wednesday , and meet the Minister of State Mrs. Ö@@ zo@@ ğ@@ u@@ z and the chan@@ cell@@ or . &quot;
&quot; the topic will certainly play a central role , &quot; he announced . &quot;
the football can and may help .
but the crucial course must put politics .
the German Football Association therefore extended its refugee initiative &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; by four years .
&quot; we ensured that this programme continues until 2019 , &quot; declared Nier@@ sbach on the edge of the UEF@@ A meeting in St. Julian &apos;s / Malta . &quot;
also some German gi@@ sts support this program .
&quot; already on this weekend , the 36 professional associations set out a clear sign when they are on the left Tri@@ kot@@ ted@@ mel , instead of the usual sponsor@@ ship logo ( Her@@ mes ) to &quot; &quot; We Help - # Refu@@ ge@@ es@@ Welcome &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; we also want to make clear that everyone should help , where and how they can only , &quot; said Le@@ verk@@ usen Motorsport Dr Ru@@ di Völ@@ ler of the &quot; Bild &quot; Zeitung ( Tuesday ) and described the project as &quot; self @-@ evident . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the drama @-@ drama goes every one , nobody is allowed to take it away . &quot;
&quot; we can use football feder@@ ations , no , we must use our radi@@ ance , influence and opportunities to help the many refugees who have suffered so incredibly , &quot; &quot; said Her@@ tha @-@ Manager Michael Pre@@ etz . &quot;
H@@ offen@@ heim &apos;s managing director Peter Ret@@ tig said of a &quot; prominent sign of the league . &quot;
the national team of the women invites 100 refugees to Halle / Sa@@ ale for the Euro @-@ qualification game against Hungary on this Friday .
Nier@@ sbach described the support of refugees as &quot; a large community of German football . &quot;
&quot; that all 36 licensed licenses have started their own projects in their places , be great . &quot;
just as great is that small and smallest clubs are active there .
&quot; the message &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome , &quot; which we spent , is lived in football . &quot;
&quot; this is of enormous importance , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; in this and next year , the association will provide 300 000 Euro for the integration of refugees together with the DF@@ B selection and the federal government . &quot;
&quot; the clubs have already called the whole sum for 2015 , &quot; &quot; reported Nier@@ sbach . &quot;
reports : SAP Management Leader loses an eye on accident
&quot; the board of directors of Europe &apos;s largest software group , Bill Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t , report@@ edly lost the left eye by a down@@ fall in early July . &quot;
&quot; during the accident on the stairs in the house of his brother in the USA he dropped onto a water glass after midnight , which he carried in his left hand , reports the &quot; Wirtschafts@@ woche &quot; on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; he is almost ble@@ eding , was power@@ less , he then went out to the street - he told us so last week , &quot; says the &quot; W@@ IW@@ O &quot; SAP co @-@ founder Has@@ so Platt@@ ner . &quot;
&quot; but Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t , however , could do his work . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; at the beginning of October we met before the Supervisory Board meeting in Wall@@ dorf , &quot; &quot; said Platt@@ ner . &quot;
&quot; the 54 year old manager is at the meeting and &quot; &quot; full of work &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in an interview with the &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; ( Thursday issue ) , Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t announced that he will come back to Germany in October and continue to lead the software company . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m full for SAP , full in my job . &quot;
&quot; of course I was in regular contact with the Supervisory Board and its Chairman Has@@ so Platt@@ ner , &quot; said Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t of the &quot; SZ . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t usually comm@@ utes between Germany and the USA , but since the summer he was no longer in the German SAP headquarters in Wall@@ dorf . &quot;
&quot; it is important to him to go to the public with such a personal story , said the &quot; SZ &quot; manager : &quot; everyone can happen to something like that . &quot;
it is important to stand up again when you &apos;ve fallen .
Mc@@ L@@ aren @-@ replacement pilot Magn@@ us@@ sen besides skir@@ m@@ ish ...

football : BV@@ B without Re@@ us vs. Kr@@ as@@ no@@ dar : turn@@ sti@@ le in the gate
&quot; at Bor@@ us@@ sia Dortmund , all hopes for a com@@ eback from Marco Re@@ us will finally break down in the first group game of the Europa League . &quot;
the national player will also be missing the championship leader of the Bundes@@ liga in the Du@@ el with the F@@ K Kr@@ as@@ no@@ dar on Thursday ( 7 p.m. / Sky ) .
&quot; unfortunately , we cannot fall back on him , &quot; said Thomas Tu@@ chel on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; whether Re@@ us will be back on Sunday in the Bundes@@ liga &apos;s league game against Le@@ verk@@ usen , the BV@@ B coach was open : &quot; we expect a return from him to the training on Friday . &quot;
&quot; given the high load of its pro@@ s , Tu@@ va will not only change its stem eleven on the Re@@ us position . &quot;
so he announced a change to the door@@ ke@@ epers position .
&quot; therefore , Roman Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller occupies the place of master keeper Roman Bür@@ k@@ ki . &quot;
&quot; he trains at an absolute top level , &quot; the football teacher praised the World Champion . &quot;
&quot; however , if Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller is in use in all Europa League games in the future , Tu@@ va left open . &quot;
&quot; with high probability , it will also contest the second game . &quot;
&quot; the for@@ e@@ word of fellow players Re@@ us , that the final entry for the BV@@ B in the Europa League must be the target , keeps middle field player Julian W@@ eig@@ l for comprehen@@ sible : &quot; &quot; Marco is not so wrong . &quot;
I think we have a good chance to access the title .
Robot@@ er@@ au@@ tos : government wants the lead for Germany
&quot; according to the will of the Federal Government , Germany should be a technological pioneer when changing the car . &quot;
&quot; on Wednesday , the Federal Cab@@ inet decided on Wednesday a strategy paper from the house of Minister of Transport Alexander Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t ( CS@@ U ) , which included investments in the expansion of digital infrastructure . &quot;
Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t spoke on Wednesday in Frankfurt on the edge of the I@@ AA car fair from a &quot; new era of mobility . &quot;
&quot; automated and connected driving will increase traffic safety and ensure less traffic , said Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t . &quot;
he also wants to discuss the subject with his counter@@ part from the G@@ 7 states that come together with industry representatives at the I@@ AA .
&quot; among other things , the policy paper of the Ministry of Transport emphas@@ ises the importance of mobile broad@@ band expansion and a fast access to digital radio transmission . &quot;
&quot; for testing new technology , there is currently a test track on the motorway 9 in Bavaria . &quot;
&quot; in order to avoid any additional liability risks to the driver , &quot; the Federal Government wants to &quot; check the legal framework &quot; and , where necessary , adapt to the new developments . &quot;
&quot; in this way , Germany wants to make international use of the permissible maximum speed for self @-@ prop@@ elled cars from 10 to 130 km / h . &quot;
&quot; the Federal Government also wants to apply for a change in the Vienna Convention , which has so far only presented the human being as a driver . &quot;
&quot; with automated driving , the car increasingly takes the lead , the driver becomes more and more to the passenger . &quot;
the technology is based primarily on sensors and cameras that capture the environment and process data in seconds .
&quot; according to a study presented by the Ministry of Economy , highly automated driving on motor@@ ways can be technically possible by 2020 . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , mobile vehicles on public roads are expected only far after 2020 . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; the digital network of the passenger car can lead to greater safety and efficiency in road traffic , &quot; said SPD &apos;s S@@ ör@@ en Bar@@ to@@ l . &quot;
&quot; however , the question of liability in case of accidents and the safety of the driver &apos;s personal data must be clearly clari@@ fied . &quot;
&quot; however , the Germans still see self @-@ prop@@ elled cars scep@@ tical - much more than French or Americans . &quot;
&quot; the survey conducted on Wednesday at the AA on behalf of the research organisation Dek@@ ra comes to the result that only eight percent of Germans believe that autonomous cars will prevail in the coming ten years , 32 percent count only in 20 years , 31 per cent believe not at all . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; anyway , drivers in Germany are not ready to rely completely on a self @-@ prop@@ elled vehicle . &quot;
&quot; following a survey conducted by the Bit@@ kom digital network , only seven percent would agree to give control over the whole trip on all roads . &quot;
&quot; on the motorway , the flowing traffic could mean 15 percent in flowing traffic , in St@@ au 45 percent . &quot;
good every fourth would leave the car under no circumstances .

&quot; this is a huge loss for our team . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the boys learned it in the morning . &quot;
&quot; but we are strong enough to get the title without Timo , &quot; &quot; said Bundestag trainer Jörg Ro@@ ß@@ kopf during the EM apprenticeship in Düsseldorf . &quot;

&quot; at that time Timo also lack@@ ed , and we have become European champion . &quot;

Gaul@@ tier feels too old for an enf@@ ant terrible
the designer Jean Paul Gaul@@ tier ( 63 ) presented an exhibition about his work on Wednesday in Munich .
the highlights : window man@@ ne@@ qu@@ ins which look terri@@ bly human thanks to video proj@@ ections .
&quot; they bear the spectacular creations of the French designer , who , amongst others , became the big star of the fashion scene with Mad@@ onn@@ as stage out@@ fits - and that he put men in sk@@ irts . &quot;
&quot; today I can no longer say that I am the enf@@ ant terrible of Haute Cou@@ ture , because I have white hair . &quot;
&quot; in the past it was ble@@ ached , meanwhile it is genuine , &quot; &quot; said Gaul@@ tier . &quot;
&quot; for the visitors of the exhibition &quot; From The Side@@ walk To The Cat@@ walk &quot; ( From the side@@ walk to the cat@@ walk ) , which is to be seen from September 18th at the Kunsth@@ alle der Hyp@@ o Cultural Foundation , it is fortunate that the designer has changed his initially distr@@ acting attitude towards a show about his person . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , he said : &quot; for me , an exhibition so@@ unded a little bit after death , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; when one dies , one gets into the museum . &quot;
the impressive collection had previously worked in the Canadian Montreal and Paris station .
&quot; it &apos;s about so much more than just beautiful dresses , &quot; &quot; said the director of the Kunsth@@ alle , Roger Die@@ ther . &quot;
&quot; it is about tolerance , acceptance and vision of an open society . &quot;
&quot; the exhibits give an insight into the man &apos;s work , written in fashion history , without ever completing a training . &quot;
&quot; chron@@ ologically , the show is not built , but it is an excell@@ ently chore@@ ograph@@ ed overall artwork , for which a lot of effort was done : to dev@@ ote the dolls , for example a sty@@ list was engaged . &quot;
14 tons of material have gone ast@@ ray to Munich according to the cur@@ ator Thierry @-@ Maxim@@ e L@@ ori@@ ot .
just before the start of the Oktober@@ fest there was still a special delic@@ acy : a leather pants outfit with cor@@ set .
Hei@@ di meets Madonna .
&quot; he is always interested in strong women ( &quot; &quot; women are smar@@ ter than men &quot; &quot; ) and for people who are a bit different , Gaul@@ tier said . &quot;
also Gaul@@ tiers of old Teddy can be seen in the exhibition .
&quot; he stands for the first , delic@@ ately fashi@@ oned side@@ ways of the designer . &quot;
&quot; as a child ( he was not a good student and bad in football ) , he put on his Teddy B@@ H@@ s and dresses , said Gaul@@ tier . &quot;
&quot; playing with a doll , his parents would not have allowed him . &quot;
he later taught the design of fashion himself .
&quot; he st@@ ole fashion magazines and looked at the designs of other designers , like Gaul@@ tier in Munich related . &quot;
later on I bought it naturally .
&quot; for his first own fashion show , he did not have to pay the models . &quot;
&quot; they got nothing , but were allowed to keep the clothes . &quot;
jewelry instead of Gard@@ ine - Pl@@ au@@ ener L@@ ace as fashion niche
&quot; in the past , we went to the long embroi@@ dery machines in and around Pl@@ auen to make meters . &quot;
&quot; the embroi@@ dered fabrics and lace were created in large quantities for customers , for example to work on ceilings and she@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; this alone does not work anymore , explains Andreas Rein@@ hardt , CEO of the Mo@@ desp@@ itze Pl@@ auen . &quot;
&quot; instead , fashion is important again . &quot;
&quot; in the early times of the Pl@@ au@@ ener Spitze , fashion plays a larger role , was then pushed through the home textile industry - and is now re@@ discovered as a niche . &quot;
&quot; Rein@@ hardt calls some examples : lace in jewelry , accessories such as bags and regional costumes . &quot;
&quot; at all , the so @-@ called vintage fashion , inspired by past styl@@ istic po@@ ets , is an increasing order potential . &quot;
those who don &apos;t use ni@@ ches in the textile industry in Germany are no longer on the market .
&quot; with us , they already have half of all orders . &quot;
Mo@@ desp@@ itze Ple@@ auen is a member of the Pl@@ au@@ ener Spitze and Sti@@ cker@@ eries Industry Association together with nine other companies .
only they are allowed to bear the protected label .
&quot; over the last 15 years , around 80 percent of the sales have been broken off . &quot;
private specialty shops as well as wholesale are almost no longer available .
our products hardly reach customers in this way .
&quot; nowadays , the bulk goods are manufactured much cheaper in the Asian region and sold almost exclusively through chains . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
there are enough reasons for new ways .
&quot; the industry association also tries to score points by environmental awareness , such as C@@ ord@@ ula Bauer from the Emb@@ ro@@ i@@ dery in Fal@@ k@@ enstein : &quot; since this year we have a quality seal that shows that we produce ec@@ ologically and socially acceptable . &quot;
Rein@@ hardt adds : &quot; this also applies to the materials used . &quot;
graduate student U@@ te Schmidt teaches at the Schne@@ eber@@ ger Auß@@ enst@@ elle der West@@ s@@ ächs@@ ische Hochschule Z@@ wick@@ au - at the Faculty of Applied Arts - and is specialized in embroi@@ der@@ ies and sp@@ ik@@ es .
&quot; in order to oppose the competition from the Asian region , you have to find high quality and innovative products . &quot;
this takes time and courage .
&quot; it creates a field of tension between the fresh@@ est ideas of the designers and the companies that need to think above all economically , &quot; says Schmidt . &quot;
&quot; therefore , an existing design is often only slightly varied to maintain a customer base . &quot;
&quot; a few years ago , textile designer Kat@@ i Reu@@ ter re@@ inv@@ aded the historic snow@@ ball point . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , the machine sti@@ ches small cells in some places . &quot;
the Pl@@ au@@ ener Gold@@ schmi@@ ede@@ master Bianca Hal@@ leb@@ ach @-@ Kr@@ au@@ ß was inspired by this : &quot; previously I couldn &apos;t do anything with traditional Pl@@ auen . &quot;
now she uses the snow@@ ball point for her jewelry .
in an elaborate method they shapes the pattern in silver .
&quot; many people in the region identify themselves with the &quot; &quot; Pl@@ au@@ ener Spitze &quot; &quot; - young and old , &quot; &quot; Reu@@ ter says . &quot;
&quot; it also delivers to the USA , to Australia and to Finland - especially to customers whose ancestors lived in Pl@@ auen and its surroundings and who would like to have a souven@@ ir . &quot;
with this I see my jewellery as a modern ambassador of the Pl@@ au@@ ener Point .
Disney plans new &quot; Mary P@@ opp@@ ins &quot; film
&quot; Legends shouldn &apos;t be stir@@ red , but Disney &apos;s still vent@@ uring into a new film of his classic &quot; Mary P@@ opp@@ ins . &quot; &quot;
&quot; according to &quot; Entertainment Week@@ ly , &quot; however , it is not about a new movie , but a kind of continuation , which plays 20 years after the first film with the magical child girl . &quot;
it is about the experiences of the N@@ anny with the family B@@ anks in times of the world economic crisis in England .
anyone who plays P@@ opp@@ ins for more than 50 years after Ju@@ lie Andre@@ ws is still uncle@@ ar .
&quot; but the director says : Rob Marshall , last with &quot; In@@ to the W@@ oods &quot; in the cinema . &quot;
XI indicates to open the economy wider for the world
&quot; the economy must be open wide outw@@ ard to foster growth , President Xi J@@ in@@ ping said on Tuesday of a group that was charged with the steering of reform . &quot;
&quot; China was aimed at attrac@@ ting foreign investments and know @-@ how and improving the strategies for business start @-@ ups , &quot; he said in a speech at the 16th session of the Central Leadership Group for the deep@@ ening of a comprehensive reform . &quot;
&quot; to promote new spin @-@ off@@ s and promote reforms will bring about new momentum and vitality and provide new space for economic growth , &quot; said Xi . &quot;
&quot; the management group adopted a series of guidelines , including a negative list to regulate the market access , relaxation of border controls policies , promoting state enterprises ( SO@@ E ) , priv@@ ates capital , and over@@ hau@@ l of the local reporting system . &quot;
&quot; after the statement , a negative list is created , identified by sectors and companies that are not eligible for investments . &quot;
the system is gradually tested and improved by testing programs .
&quot; the initiative is of importance as it as@@ signs a greater role in the allocation of resources to the market , ensuring a right @-@ wing business environment and stream@@ lined the market , said the statement . &quot;
the government will also lock controls over the powers transmitted to the companies and make sure companies decide how to conduct their business .
the statement also said that China will allow border regions to explore new models of cross @-@ border economic cooperation and new mechanisms for promoting regional growth .
&quot; as part of an offer to open state @-@ controlled sectors , additional areas for private investment will be opened . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the government will not change its policy towards foreign investments and will protect the legitimate interests of foreign @-@ funded companies and provide better services for them , &quot; &quot; said the statement . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it is easier for foreigners to apply for a permanent residence permit or the &quot; Green Card &quot; by optim@@ ising the requirements and facilit@@ ating the application process . &quot;
&quot; to guarantee the right of lawyers to practice their activities , and to use professional judges and prosec@@ ut@@ ors , was also discussed at a meeting . &quot;
&quot; at the meeting , Prime Minister Li Ke@@ q@@ i@@ ang and important leaders such as Li@@ u Y@@ un@@ shan and Z@@ hang Ga@@ oli participated , as reported in a statement published after the meeting . &quot;
EU wants to double mer@@ cury @-@ limit in pre@@ dat@@ ors
&quot; the European Commission wants to double the limit values for mer@@ cury in large pre@@ dat@@ ors , and to cope with the consumers with a significantly higher dose of the nervous system . &quot;
&quot; the consumer organization food@@ watch , which is a corresponding working paper of the EU , sharp@@ ly cri@@ tici@@ zed the plans : &quot; risks and side effects of alli@@ ed industrial and environmental policy are passed on with full force to pregnant women and inf@@ ants , &quot; explained Matthias Wolf@@ sch@@ midt of food@@ watch . &quot;
&quot; according to Wolf@@ sch@@ midt , the limits of nerve gas should be raised for large fish at the end of the food chain , such as shar@@ ks or s@@ word@@ fish from one to two milli@@ grams of mer@@ cury per kil@@ ogram of fish . &quot;
&quot; however , large pre@@ dat@@ ors are already so strongly charged with mer@@ cury that , on the basis of the current limit values , approximately 50 percent of the cat@@ ches must not be sold . &quot;
&quot; after dou@@ bling the limit values , only 14.5 percent would be ru@@ de . &quot;
&quot; in return for this loos@@ ening , the EU according to food@@ watch plans to tigh@@ ten limit values for other fish from currently 0.5 milli@@ grams to 0.1 milli@@ grams of mer@@ cury per kil@@ ogram . &quot;
&quot; but food@@ watch described this as &quot; &quot; trick &quot; &quot; because smaller c@@ emet@@ eries , such as car@@ p , are usually so low bur@@ dened that they already comply with the planned maximum values . &quot;
&quot; the lowering of wast@@ es is therefore &quot; a per@@ fi@@ des distr@@ actions man@@ eu@@ ver , which helps only the economy , &quot; explained Wolf@@ sch@@ midt . &quot;
mer@@ cury is a heavy metal which is highly poison@@ ous for the human being that strongly acc@@ entu@@ ates the food chain particularly in pre@@ dat@@ ors .
&quot; the German government therefore war@@ ns that &quot; &quot; already low amounts can cause particularly in un@@ born les@@ ions of the nervous system . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the Federal Environment Ministry states on its homepage with regard to the maximum values , but that a &quot; health haz@@ ard to the general population &quot; is not to be expected . &quot;
mer@@ cury is driven mainly by coal combustion in the environment .
&quot; according to a written information from the Federal Ministry of Environment , the German coal @-@ fired power plants come across more than six tons of mer@@ cury in the year , two thirds of the total amount em@@ itted in Germany . &quot;
&quot; the concentration of mer@@ cury in fish such as Elbe , Rhine and Danube was &quot; permanently and nation@@ wide , &quot; the &quot; Spiegel &quot; had been cited in March from paper . &quot;
&quot; last year , Europe @-@ wide war@@ nings of mer@@ cury in fish were already one of the most commonly reported health risks in the EU warning system RA@@ S@@ FF . &quot;
