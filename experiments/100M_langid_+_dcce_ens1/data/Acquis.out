these boards must be so appropriate that they are well visible ; they must be removable .
&quot; ( 1 ) For each road vehicle or container , a separate Car@@ net TI@@ R is to be produced . &quot;

&quot; customs authorities may only be allowed to accompany the road vehicles , trucks or containers in their country at the expense of the transport owner , &quot;
&quot; - on the way carry out a control and a fitting of the goods loading of the road vehicles , trucks or containers . &quot;
&quot; customs authorities take notice of the goods loading of a road vehicle , a lor@@ ry or a container at a passage duty or on the road , so they have to mem@@ ori@@ ze the newly designed customs regulations and the type of insp@@ ections that remain in the Car@@ net TI@@ R . &quot;
customs regulations in other than those cases referred to in articles 24 and 35 are viol@@ ated or damaged or damaged without violation of customs contracts and the protocol contained in Anne@@ x 1 shall remain un@@ affected by the regulations contained in the Car@@ net TI@@ R ; the internal regulations remain un@@ affected .

&quot; in such a case the customs authorities of the contrac@@ ting party , through whose territory the goods are subsequently transported , the Car@@ net TI@@ R will be recognized for the continuation of TI@@ R transport , provided that the customs exclu@@ sions and / or the character marks remain intact . &quot;
&quot; ( 2 ) The same applies to the part of the route , where the owner of the Car@@ net TI@@ R is not used in the area of a contract party , because simpler procedures for customs clearance or the use of such a process is not required . &quot;

&quot; ( 2 ) For the application of this section , extra@@ ordin@@ arily heavy and bul@@ ky goods can be transported with vehicles or containers without a customs duty . &quot;
&quot; ( 3 ) This section will only be applied if , in the view of the clearance duty , the proximity of the exceptionally heavy or bul@@ ky goods as well as the appropriate accessories can be retained without further notice or if these goods cannot be replaced or removed without any un@@ am@@ big@@ uous traces . &quot;
&quot; all provisions of this Convention , of which the special provisions of this section do not devi@@ ate , shall also apply to the transport of exceptionally severe or bul@@ ky goods in the TI@@ R procedure . &quot;
&quot; the liability of the equivalent association does not only cover the goods listed in the Car@@ net TI@@ R , but also on goods which are not listed in the Car@@ net TI@@ R , but are on the loading area or between the goods listed in the Car@@ net TI@@ R . &quot;
&quot; the used Car@@ net TI@@ R must bear the note of &quot; &quot; usually heavy or bul@@ ky goods &quot; &quot; on the envel@@ ope and on all sections in English or French . &quot;
&quot; the passage duty point can demand that Lad@@ el@@ ists , photographs , plans , etc . , necessary for the fe@@ asi@@ bility of the transported goods must be attached to the Car@@ net TI@@ R . &quot;

&quot; the customs authorities have been provided satis@@ factory proof that the goods listed in the manifest of a Car@@ net TI@@ R caused by accident or force ma@@ je@@ ure , or that they are missing due to their nature due to natural sw@@ ings , so exemp@@ tion from the v@@ ows and roy@@ alties is granted . &quot;

&quot; in THE A@@ WA@@ Y that it is the desire of organization , community and states to avoid unnecessary dup@@ lication in the area of securing measures - &quot;
&quot; in accordance with Article III ( 1 ) of the Treaty , the States undertake to accept security measures for the entire output - and special spl@@ alt@@ able material for all peaceful nuclear activities that are carried out in their territ@@ orial regions , under their sovereignty or under their control at any place , where this material is not diver@@ ted for nuclear weapons or other nuclear explo@@ sives . &quot;
&quot; the organisation is entitled and oblig@@ ated to ensure that securing measures are applied to the entire output - and special spl@@ alt@@ able material in all peaceful nuclear activities which are carried out in the territ@@ orial regions of the states , under their sovereignty or under their control at any place , whereby this material is not used for nuclear weapons or other nuclear explo@@ sives . &quot;
&quot; a ) The community oblig@@ ates itself to cooperate in the application of its hed@@ ging measures on initial and special spl@@ alt@@ able material in all peaceful nuclear activities in the territories of the states with the organization , according to the stipul@@ ations of this Convention , in order to ensure that such an exit - and special spl@@ alt@@ able material is not bran@@ ched for nuclear weapons or other nuclear explo@@ sives . &quot;
&quot; B ) The organization applies to the provisions of this Convention so that it may prove the provisions of the security system of the Community by ensuring that no core material has been bran@@ ched off from peaceful use , and has been used for nuclear weapons or other nuclear explo@@ sives . &quot;
the verification by the organization includes independent measurements and observ@@ ations by the organization according to the procedure laid down in this Convention .
&quot; in its review , the organization of the effectiveness of the securing system of the Community shall be charged according to the provisions of this Convention . &quot;
&quot; the organization , the community and the states work together as far as any contractual party is concerned to facilitate the implementation of the hed@@ ging measures provided in this Convention , avoiding unnecessary dup@@ lication in the field of securing measures . &quot;
&quot; the hed@@ ging measures provided in this Convention are carried out in such a way that they are a ) not a disability for economic and technological development in the community , or for international cooperation in the field of peaceful nuclear activities , including international exchange of nuclear materials ; &quot;
&quot; ( B ) Un@@ due interference in the peaceful nuclear activities in the community , in particular in the operation of the plants ; &quot;
&quot; C ) with the practices of pru@@ dent operations , how they are required for the economic and non @-@ commercial implementation of nuclear activities . &quot;
&quot; a ) The organisation meets all provisions to protect business and industrial secrets as well as other confidential information , of which they are aware of the implementation of this Convention . &quot;
&quot; ( II ) Con@@ clu@@ ding information on nuclear materials , which is subject to safety measures according to this Convention , may be published on the decision of the Council and with the consent of the directly affected states or the community , as far as each of the two contrac@@ ting parties is concerned . &quot;
&quot; a ) In the implementation of safety measures according to this Convention , technological developments in the field of securing measures will be fully charged , and all efforts are made to ensure optimum cost effectiveness and the use of the principle of effective safety monitoring of the flow of core material , which is based on this Convention , by using instruments and other technical procedures at certain strategic points , as far as the current or future technology is made possible . &quot;
&quot; B ) For the guarantee of optimal cost effectiveness , for example the following methods are applied : I ) spatial finger@@ print as a means of determining the material balance zones for the purposes of accounting ; &quot;
&quot; ( III ) Con@@ centr@@ ation of the review process on the phases of the fuel cycle , which could be produced by the production , processing , use and storage of nuclear materials , from which without further nuclear weapons and other core spr@@ inkl@@ es could be produced , and the greatest possible limitation of the review procedures in other core materials , provided that this does not hin@@ der the implementation of this Convention . &quot;
&quot; a ) In accordance with this Convention , the Community of the Organization , in accordance with this Convention , shall provide information on nuclear materials that are subject to safety measures , and the characteristics of the facilities required to carry out the securing measures relating to this material of Bel@@ ang . &quot;
B ) The organisation only requires the minimum level of information and data compatible with the implementation of its tasks in accordance with the Convention .
&quot; ( II ) Information about systems are limited to the minimum size , which is necessary for the use of safety measures in relation to core material that is subject to the securing measures according to this Convention . &quot;
&quot; C ) At the request of the community the organization is ready to examine investment data , which considers the community as particularly vulnerable , in the premises of the community . &quot;
&quot; these data do not need to be materi@@ ally transferred to the organization , provided that they remain accessible for further testing by the organization in the premises of the Community . &quot;
a ) i ) The organisation gets the consent of the Community and states to the appointment of insp@@ ectors for the States .
&quot; if the community is obj@@ ected either against a proposed nam@@ ing or at any time against a certain denom@@ ination , the organization of the Community and the States suggests one or more alternative nom@@ inations . &quot;
&quot; if , due to the repeated ref@@ usal of the community , to agree to the appointment of insp@@ ectors of the organization , which are ob@@ struc@@ ted by this agreement , the Council will discuss the ref@@ usal to discuss with the aim of meeting appropriate measures . &quot;
&quot; B ) The Community and the concerned States undertake the necessary steps to ensure that the insp@@ ectors of the organization , in fact , can actually fulfil their tasks in accordance with their Convention . &quot;
( C ) The visits and activities of the insp@@ ectors of the organization are arranged in such a way that i ) are as small as possible for possible har@@ ass@@ ment and distur@@ b@@ ance for the community and the states and for the peaceful nuclear activities .
II ) the protection of industrial secrets and other confidential information provided to the insp@@ ectors of the organization is ensured .
&quot; each state applies to the organization , including its assets , funds and assets , as well as to its insp@@ ectors and other officials , the tasks of this Convention , the corresponding provisions of the agreement on the prer@@ og@@ atives and exemp@@ tions of the International Atom@@ ic Energy Organisation . &quot;
&quot; the securing measures according to this Convention are concluded with regard to core material when the Community and the Organization conclude that the material is consumed or dil@@ uted in a way that it is no longer usable for a nuclear activity that is under the stand@@ point of the securing measures of Bel@@ ang , or has become practically non @-@ ref@@ und@@ able . &quot;
&quot; the Community noti@@ fies the organisation according to the provisions of this Convention , the transfer of nuclear materials from the States , which is subject to the securing measures according to this Convention . &quot;
&quot; the securing measures according to this Convention are concluded with regard to core material , as soon as the recipient state , as stipul@@ ated in this Convention , has taken responsibility for it . &quot;
&quot; the organisation carries out documents , from which any transfer and if necessary the re@@ application of the securing measures to the further core material . &quot;
&quot; core material , which is subject to safety measures according to this agreement , is to be used in non @-@ nuclear activities such as the manufacture of allo@@ ys or ceramics , thus arran@@ ging the association with the organisation of such use of the material , under which circumstances the securing measures are to be concluded with regard to this material . &quot;
II ) that the material during the time of the non @-@ application of the hed@@ ging measures after this agreement is not used for the production of nuclear weapons and other nuclear explo@@ sives .
B ) The organisation and the community make a provision that the hed@@ ging measures fores@@ een in this Convention will only be applied as long as the core material is used in such activity .
&quot; in the scheme , as far as possible , as long and under what circumstances these securing measures are not applied . &quot;
&quot; in any event , the hed@@ ging measures stipul@@ ated in this Convention will once again be applied once the core material is returned to a peaceful nuclear activity . &quot;
the organization is held over the total amount and composition of the material in the respective state or the respective states and on any passing on such material from this state or states .
&quot; this explains its agreement as quickly as possible ; it only covers issues such as tempor@@ al and proced@@ ural provisions and agreements for reporting , but does not include an endor@@ sement or disclosure of military activity and does not refer to the use of the core material . &quot;
&quot; the organization , the community and the states bear the costs that each of them grow in the implementation of their respective obligations arising from this Convention . &quot;
&quot; if the community , the states or persons who are subject to their sovereignty , are subject to extraordinary costs as a result of a special request of the organization , the organization will reimbur@@ se the costs , provided that it has agreed in advance . &quot;
&quot; in any event , the organization bears the costs of all additional measurements and sampling that are required by the insp@@ ectors of the organisation . &quot;
&quot; the Community and the States make sure that the protection of liability for nuclear damage , including insurance or other financial security , may be entitled to the organization and its officials for the purposes of carrying out this Convention in the same way as to the nation@@ als of the States . &quot;
any claim that the community or a state against the organization or the organization vis @-@ à @-@ vis the Community or a State due to damage - with the exception of damage from a nuclear incident - has been asser@@ ted in accordance with international law .
&quot; according to the general information submitted by the General Manager , the Council shall verify that the organisation is not able to asser@@ t itself by re@@ examination , that no core material , which must be protected under this Convention , shall reimbur@@ se the reports provided in Article X@@ II ( C ) of the Stat@@ utes and possibly also take the other measures fores@@ een there . &quot;
&quot; in such steps , the Council , in which mass was acquired by the assurance measures applied , offers the community or the state - as far as each of the two contrac@@ ting parties is concerned - any justi@@ fiable opportunity to give the Council the necessary security . &quot;
&quot; at the request of the organization , the community or state , consult@@ ations are held on questions arising from the interpretation or application of this Convention . &quot;
the Community and the States are entitled to request that questions arising from the interpretation or application of this Convention are examined by the Council .
the Council invites the community and the affected state to participate in the discussion of such questions by the Council .
&quot; any dispute arising from the interpretation or application of this Convention , with the exception of any dispute arising from the interpretation or application of this Agreement , shall be submitted to the request of a party arbit@@ ral tri@@ bunal which consists of five arbitr@@ ators . &quot;
&quot; the community and states ren@@ ame two arbitr@@ ators , the organization also ap@@ points two arbitr@@ ators , and the four named arbitr@@ ators elect a fifth who leads the pres@@ idency . &quot;
&quot; if the Community and the States or the Organization shall not be named by two arbitr@@ ators within thirty days of the application , the community or organisation may request the President of the International Court of Justice to ap@@ point these arbitr@@ ators . &quot;
the same procedure is applicable if within thirty days after the appointment or appointment of the fourth arbitr@@ ator the fifth arbitr@@ ator has not yet been elected .
&quot; a majority of the members of the Ar@@ bit@@ ral Tribunal are competent , and all resolutions require the approval of at least three arbitr@@ ators . &quot;
&quot; the decisions of the Ar@@ bit@@ ral Tribunal shall be binding for the organization , the community and the concerned states . &quot;
&quot; a ) This agreement occurs for non @-@ nuclear weapons states , the contrac@@ ting party of the contract and become members of the community , in force , i ) when the respective State of the Organisation declar@@ es that its procedures are concluded for the entry into force of this Convention . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; if the Community of the Organization notified that it is able to apply its securing measures to this state for the purposes of this Convention . &quot;
&quot; a ) The organization , the community and the states consult each other upon request of one of the contrac@@ ting parties for a change in this Convention . &quot;
&quot; B ) All amend@@ ments shall require the approval of the Organization , the Community and the States . &quot;
C ) General Director shall inform all Member States of the Organization immediately of any change in this Convention .
&quot; a ) This Convention shall come into force on the day in which the organization of the Community and the States receives the written notification , that their procedures for entry into force are concluded . &quot;
B ) This Convention will remain in force as long as the states are contrac@@ ting party of the contract .
&quot; the term &quot; &quot; Convention &quot; &quot; used in this agreement means the Convention and the Protocol . &quot;
the purpose of this part of the Convention is to determine the procedures applicable to the implementation of the provisions of the Part I on securing measures .
&quot; the objective of the safety measures specified in this agreement is the timely discovery of the bran@@ ching of significant amounts of nuclear materials for nuclear weapons and other nuclear explo@@ sives for unknown purposes , as well as the det@@ err@@ ent of such branches by the risk of early detection . &quot;
&quot; in order to reach the target defined in Article 28 , material accounting is used as a securing measure of fundamental importance , verbal regulation and observation as an important supplementary measure . &quot;
&quot; the technical conclusion of the insp@@ ections by the organisation is carried out by an explanation , in which for each material balance zone the material quantity for a certain period is not specified under specification of the accuracy limits for the given Me@@ gen . &quot;
&quot; when carrying out their veri@@ fications , the organization after article 3 makes full use of the security system of the community . &quot;
the accounting and control system of the Community for nuclear materials according to this Convention is based on a breakdown in material balance zones .
&quot; in the application of their hed@@ ging measures , the Community of de procedures and measures will make use of the following ways and they , as far as required , proceed in the following paragra@@ ph@@ s and are intended for purpose : &quot;
&quot; a ) a measuring system to determine the quantities of obtained , derived , sent , lost or otherwise derived from the stock material and stock quantities ; &quot;
B ) the evaluation of re@@ produ@@ ci@@ bility and accuracy of measurements and estim@@ ation of uncertainty ;
&quot; C ) procedures for determining , testing and evalu@@ ating differences in the measurements of sender and recipient ; &quot;
e ) Proced@@ ure to evaluate accumulation of non @-@ measured stocks and not measured losses ;
&quot; F ) a protocol and reporting system which , for each material balance zone , displays the core material and the changes in this stock , including the one - and outputs of the material balance zone ; &quot;
( g ) precau@@ tions which ensure that the accounting procedures and arrangements are carried out correctly ;
h ) Proced@@ ure for reimbur@@ sement of reports to the organization in accordance with articles 59 to 65 and 67 to 69 .
the securing measures in accordance with this Convention do not extend to material in mining or in ore processing .
&quot; ( B ) uran - or th@@ under @-@ containing material that has not yet reached the phase of the core fuel cycle , introduced into the States , the community of the organization shares the quantity and composition of the material , provided that it is not introduced for specific non @-@ nuclear purposes ; &quot;
&quot; C ) leaving the core material , which is suitable for the composition and purity of fuel or is@@ ot@@ ope enrich@@ ment , the plant or the process phase in which it is produced , or if this core material or other core material is introduced into the states in a later phase of the core fuel cycle , it is subject to the other safety measures referred to in this Agreement . &quot;
&quot; a ) The hed@@ ging measures stipul@@ ated in this Convention shall be termin@@ ated for core material under the conditions mentioned in Article 11 . however , the Community considers that the recovery of core material that is subject to this Convention is not possible or desirable , thus consult the organisation and community on the application of suitable security measures . &quot;
&quot; B ) The hed@@ ging measures stipul@@ ated in this Convention shall be termin@@ ated for core material under the conditions mentioned in Article 13 , provided that the organization and the Community conc@@ ur that this core material is practically non @-@ ref@@ und@@ able . &quot;
&quot; upon request of the Community , the organization liber@@ ates the following core material from the securing measures according to this Convention : &quot;
a ) special spl@@ alt@@ able material when used in grams or smaller quantities as a sensor in instruments ;
&quot; B ) Core material if it is used in non @-@ nuclear activities pursuant to Article 13 , if such core material is re@@ cover@@ able , and &quot;
&quot; C ) Pl@@ ut@@ oni@@ um with an is@@ ot@@ ope concentration of Pl@@ ut@@ oni@@ um @-@ 238 , which is over 80 % . &quot;
&quot; upon request of the Community , the organisation fre@@ es core material , which would otherwise be subject to securing measures following this agreement , provided that the total amount of material delivered to the states in the states is no more than any time due to this article in the states . &quot;
&quot; a ) a total of one kil@@ ogram of special p@@ alt@@ able material , which can consist of one or more of the following materials : &quot;
&quot; ( II ) Ur@@ an with an enrich@@ ment of 0.2 ( 20 % ) and above , calculated by multi@@ plying its weight with enrich@@ ment , &quot;
&quot; III ) Ur@@ an with an enrich@@ ment that lies under 0.2 ( 20 % ) and above the natural uran , calcul@@ ates by multi@@ plying its weight with the five @-@ fold squar@@ ed of enrich@@ ment ; &quot;
&quot; a total of ten metric tons of natural uran , and a de@@ pl@@ eted ur@@ anium with an enrich@@ ment of more than 0.0@@ 05 ( 0.5 % ) ; &quot;
C ) twenty metric tons of crus@@ hed ur@@ anium with an enrich@@ ment of 0.0@@ 05 ( 0.5 % ) or below ;
&quot; if the core material is to be processed , processed or stored together with core material that is subject to the hed@@ ging measures according to this agreement , precau@@ tions for the re@@ application of the securing measures are taken on that material . &quot;
&quot; the Community meets with the Organisation Supp@@ lements , which is necessary to determine the extent necessary for the successful and effective fulfil@@ l@@ ment of the tasks of the organisation according to this Convention , in individual cases , such as the procedures laid down in the Convention . &quot;
the amend@@ ments may be extended or changed without any amend@@ ment to this Convention in agreement between the organization and the community .
&quot; the comple@@ mentary agreements occur simultaneously with or as soon as possible after the entry into force of this Convention in force . the organization , the community and the States undertake all efforts so that these agreements may come into force within nin@@ ety days after the entry into force of this Convention ; an extension of this period requires the admission of the organization , the community and the states . &quot;
&quot; on the basis of the initial report mentioned in Article 62 of the initial report , the organization is based on the core material underlying this Convention in the States , regardless of its origin , and continues this inventory list due to the subsequent reports and the results of its investigations . &quot;
&quot; between the European Economic Community ( EEC ) and its Member States Belgium , Denmark , Germany , France , Ireland , Italy , Luxembourg , Netherlands , United Kingdom ( Member States ) on the one hand and the International Development Organization ( Organisation ) &quot;
&quot; the EEC has decided to contribute to the special action programme established at the conference for international economic cooperation , in order to help meet the immediate need of individual countries with low income , whose development is imp@@ eded by general partner problems . &quot;
&quot; C ) It is the aim of the EEC and Member States that the whole of the Member States shall be bound by the agreement within six months following entry into force of the agreement , and as far as possible within two years of entry into force in the form of loans , and the organization will do its utmost to achieve this goal . &quot;
&quot; D ) The EEC and the organization have consul@@ ted one another on the proposed implementation and administration of this agreement and the mid@@ size bind@@ ings , in order to ensure a broad and balanced geographical distribution within the framework of this agreement . &quot;
&quot; to this end , the organisation of the EEC has submitted a table that is evident in what way it intends to apply the criteria specified in this agreement - &quot;
&quot; the organisation direc@@ ts a special account under the name &quot; &quot; Special account &quot; , &quot; which consists of the funds which the Member States shall contribute to the special transaction account . this account is governed by the organization as a car@@ et@@ aker and used ( in this property the organization is designated as &quot; &quot; car@@ et@@ aker &quot; &quot; ) , and only for the purpose specified in this Agreement and in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement . &quot;
the Op@@ tional Account will be se@@ duc@@ ed separately and separately from all other accounts and assets of the organization .
&quot; the contributions are to be paid as follows : a ) The payment is made in the form of cash or non @-@ interest credit notes of the Member State , which must be paid in the currency of the respective State to the Order of the Organization as the administrator of the special transaction , and to be depos@@ ited in the organization in the country concerned . &quot;
&quot; B ) The payment is made in two rates , namely , i ) the first in the amount of at least 45 v . h . the fee within 30 days after the entry into force of this Agreement or another between the EEC and the car@@ et@@ aker agreed upon ; &quot;
&quot; II ) the second in the amount of the balance of the contribution to 1 January 1979 or at another time , which was agreed between the EEC and the car@@ et@@ aker considering the periods required for the parliamentary approval of the annual budget plans . &quot;
C ) Any Member State may be able to make payments before the above mentioned dates upon request .
&quot; according to the usual procedure of the organization , the car@@ et@@ aker takes about proportional draw on cash or the school j@@ one to cover expenses for the promotion loans and compens@@ ate for the promotion account in a reasonable manner . &quot;
&quot; in the gran@@ ting of these loans , the car@@ et@@ aker can be guided by the following factors in accordance with the conditions of the EEC : &quot;
III ) the extent to which international economic factors contributed to the current and fores@@ ee@@ able economic problems of the country ;
VI ) of the composition and the tendency of the country &apos;s debt service and its further len@@ ding capacity to loan conditions without de@@ preci@@ ation ; and
VII ) The extent to which the problems of the countries concerned can be regulated by contributions from other sources .
&quot; each special transaction is to finance a clearly out@@ dated and rapidly re@@ pay@@ able development programme or project ( including a sec@@ toral project ) , regardless of whether it is part of the organization &apos;s loan programme or not , according to the procedures and practices employed by the public funds of the organization , the aim of this agreement is to be taken into account . &quot;
&quot; the funds of the promotion account may not be used instead of the International Bank for Rec@@ on@@ struction and Development ( Bank ) or the Organisation , which are bound by a loan or credit for a program or project , which has already been approved by the directors of the Bank or the Organization on the day of the entry into force of this agreement . &quot;
&quot; apart from section 4 , special transaction loans are subject to the same re@@ payment terms which are generally applicable to the organization granted by the organization ; therefore , they can be re@@ pay@@ able in the last ten years . &quot;
transaction loans are granted in one or more currencies of the Member States and are re@@ pay@@ able in these currencies .
amounts to pay this clock are directly to the organization that re@@ tains it .
&quot; each transaction is subject to a separate loan agreement between the recipient country and the car@@ et@@ aker , in which particular the origin of the funds is specified . &quot;
&quot; the revenue from each special transaction can be used for expenses in the currency of the recipient country , or for goods or services ( which are produced or produced . ) in developing countries , which are members of the organization and which , according to what the car@@ et@@ aker set at the time of loan guarantee , may be a recipient of a special transaction . &quot;
capital re@@ payments of special transaction loans are made to the special transaction account and the amount paid in this way in the currency of a member state shall be with@@ drawn from the car@@ et@@ aker to the Member State in accordance with its receipt as soon as possible .
the car@@ et@@ aker shall be instruc@@ ted until full assignment of all the special financial loans to the EEC on the proposed projects and programmes approved by the directors .
&quot; during the time of payment of the special transaction loans , the car@@ et@@ aker shall inform the EEC quar@@ terly on the development of the special transaction loans and the expendi@@ tures for this . &quot;
&quot; as soon as possible after the end of the financial year of the organization , the car@@ et@@ aker sends a detailed reck@@ oning of the special transaction account with an opinion of the external audi@@ tors of the Organisation for this account . &quot;
&quot; as soon as possible , the car@@ et@@ aker of the E@@ EA submitted a detailed report on the projects and programmes financed by the special financial account . &quot;
&quot; the administrator creates and performs suitable records and accounts from which the contributions to the special transaction account , the amounts paid to the account , and the amounts paid out of the account , and the re@@ payments to the Member States are apparent . &quot;
the EEC and the car@@ et@@ akers are working closely together to achieve the objectives of this agreement .
&quot; to this end , the EEC ( represented by the Commission of the European Communities ) and the car@@ et@@ akers until the complete issu@@ ance of the special transaction account from time to time ex@@ poses a exchange of ideas about the status of the special transaction account , the progress of the programmes or projects financed by special deals , and on all other issues affecting the provisions of this agreement . &quot;
&quot; this agreement on December 31 , 1978 , or at a later date , which the EEC and the organisation may agree , have not entered into force , the agreement and all the obligations of the parties resulting from this are due immediately . &quot;
&quot; if the total capital amount is returned from the recei@@ vers in accordance with Article II Section 8 of this agreement and re@@ mitted to the Member States , this agreement and all the obligations of the parties are concluded with immediate effect . &quot;
this agreement requires approval by the individual Member States and the EEC as per the proced@@ ural provisions of each party .
the Govern@@ ments of the Member States notified the Sec@@ retariat of the Council of the European Communities to conclude the proceedings in question .
the Sec@@ retariat for@@ wards these noti@@ fications together with a Noti@@ fication on the regular approval of this agreement by the EEC .
&quot; this agreement becomes effective and occurs in force on the first day of the month , which follows the day of receipt of the mentioned notice at the organization . &quot;
&quot; this agreement is written in two manus@@ crip@@ ts in Danish , German , English , French , Italian and Dutch , whereby each wording is binding in equal measure . &quot;
considering that the agreement should be concluded in the form of a letter to change Anne@@ x A of the Protocol No. 1 to the agreement between the European Economic Community and the Swiss Con@@ federation ( 1 ) - H@@ AT F@@ OL@@ GEN@@ DE VER@@ OR@@ DN@@ UNG :
between the European Atom@@ ic Energy Community and the Swiss Con@@ federation in the area of controlled nuclear fusion and plasma physics
&quot; the EURO@@ P@@ Ä@@ IS@@ CHE atomic community , herein@@ after called &quot; Eur@@ atom , &quot; represented by the Commission of the European Communities , herein@@ after referred to as &quot; Commission &quot; &quot;
&quot; the Swiss Con@@ federation , herein@@ after referred to as &quot; Switzerland , &quot; is represented by the Swiss Federal Council , herein@@ after called &quot; Bundes@@ rat , &quot; &quot;
&quot; this program includes the creation of a large experimental setup , the JET ( Joint European Tor@@ us ) , whose construction and operation are named after chapter V of the Eur@@ atom Treaty - herein@@ after referred to as &quot; &quot; Shar@@ ed Company JET . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; for several years , Switzerland has been working with research in the field of controlled fusion and plasma physics and is well acquainted with the area concerned . &quot;
&quot; as far as practical use of controlled nuclear fusion is still to carry out extensive work , it is in the interest of the contrac@@ ting parties of the present agreement to avoid unnecessary over@@ l@@ aps and to accelerate their respective research , which have achieved a higher priority level due to the energy crisis - &quot;
&quot; this agreement should enable each contrac@@ ting party to move through a merger of their research efforts in the field of controlled nuclear fusion and plasma physics from the resources provided for the mutual research work , avoiding unnecessary over@@ l@@ aps and consequently the common objective of this research work , i.e. the cost @-@ moder@@ ately competitive electric power generation by using the controlled core fusion reaction . &quot;
&quot; to achieve the objective of the present agreement , the contrac@@ ting parties associate their respective research programmes in Anne@@ x I and II of this agreement , herein@@ after referred to as &quot; Eur@@ atom &apos;s program &quot; and &quot; Swiss program . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in order to ensure effective cooperation , the Swiss program takes over long @-@ term goals and forms of cooperation with the Eur@@ atom program ; it will be extended or changed after testing by the organs mentioned in Article 5 to 10 and Article 16 of the present Agreement . &quot;
&quot; each time the contrac@@ ting parties adopt a new programme , this shall be in place of the programs listed in App@@ endi@@ x I and II . &quot;
the association stated in paragraph 1 is realised by : - appropriate participation of each party during the preparation and execution of the programs of the other party ;
&quot; - Exchange of personnel under the relevant laboratories in the Eur@@ atom Member States , Switzerland and third countries with which Eur@@ atom has concluded a similar agreement as the present agreement , herein@@ after called &quot; associated third states , &quot; as well as the laboratories that work on the Eur@@ atom program ; &quot;
- mutual right to access the scientific and technical results of the respective programmes .
&quot; as part of the present agreement , Switzerland particip@@ ates in the JET project . &quot;
&quot; with regard to carrying out the association stipul@@ ated in Article 2 item 1 of this agreement , the contrac@@ ting parties concluded an association agreement , which corresponds as far as possible to those between the Commission and the States and companies or individuals , herein@@ after referred to as &quot; Associ@@ ated Organ@@ s , &quot; in view of the implementation of the Eur@@ atom program . &quot;
&quot; with the same objective , Eur@@ atom is concerned that Switzerland is involved with the time of entry into force of the present agreement on the promotion of personnel exchange , which is concluded between the Commission and the associated organs , herein@@ after referred to as &quot; agreement on personnel exchange . &quot; &quot;
&quot; with regard to the involvement in the JET project , Switzerland is part of the present agreement of the present agreement to the common JET , whose statutes it accepts . &quot;
&quot; furthermore Eur@@ atom is concerned that Switzerland &apos;s contractual partners can become a contract whose goal is to be concluded within the framework of the present agreement , with the exception of association contracts or other similar contracts concluded by Eur@@ atom during the period of validity of the present agreement . &quot;
the organs entrusted with the carrying out of the association designated in Article 2 item 1 of the present agreement are described in article 5 to 10 of this agreement and in the association agreement .
&quot; in particular , the association contract fores@@ ees the implementation of a Ste@@ ering Committee , the Perman@@ ent Represent@@ ative of the Commission and the Federal Council . &quot;
- to monitor the development of the research work and thus to direct the best possible results in accordance with the aims of this agreement .
Switzerland is represented by a maximum of two delegates in the connection group used within the framework of the Eur@@ atom program - herein@@ after called &quot; VG . &quot;
&quot; the VG , which has to ensure the exchange of information and cooperation in all questions related to ongoing or planned programmes and activities in the area of the Eur@@ atom program , assumes that this agreement relates to all research and development activities . &quot;

&quot; the agreements could be concluded up to the total amount of the contribution made by the credi@@ tor country to the mechanism , while within a total limit of 2,7@@ 25 billion b@@ illing units ; this corresponds to 50 % of all future delivery la@@ youts of member countries . &quot;
&quot; however , here are some conditions mentioned here , whose application the BI@@ S would be ready . &quot;
&quot; with each Stand@@ by Credit the BI@@ Z would initially take on an obligation for two years , with the possibility of renew@@ ables , without the fact that a total of five years would be exceeded . &quot;
&quot; in the opening of loans , as well as their possible extension , the BI@@ S would charge a credit @-@ opening fee . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it would be agreed that the initial drawing will not be made before the exp@@ iry of a month after the Stand@@ by Agreement , so that the Bank can make the necessary adjustments to their own liqui@@ dity . &quot;
&quot; the drawing would take place in the currencies available in the BI@@ S at the end of the agreement , very likely in US dollars ; they would extend to periods that would be taking account of the funds of the bank , expected to be three or six months . &quot;
&quot; the conditions would correspond to those who use the BI@@ S at the respective time on similar conditions , i.e. the interest rates would largely correspond to the market rates . &quot;

in the form of a correspondence between the European Economic Community and the Argent@@ inian Republic on the trade with Hamm@@ el and lamb meat
&quot; I honour to take on the recent negotiations between our deleg@@ ations to establish provisions on import of Hamm@@ el , lamb and goat meat from Argentina to the European Economic Community in connection with the application of the Common Market Organisation for She@@ ep and goat meat . &quot;
&quot; - fresh or cooled Hamm@@ el - , lamb and goat meat ( 02.0@@ 1 A IV a ) ) ; &quot;
&quot; as part of this agreement , the export opportunities for Hamm@@ el , lamb and goat meat from Argentina will be set to the following annual quantity : 20,000 tons , expressed in the battle body weight ( 1 ) . &quot;
&quot; in order to ensure proper functioning of the agreement , Argentina is oblig@@ ated to ensure that the agreed amount does not exceed the agreed amount and is executed in accordance with conventional offer forms ( frozen or cooled ) . &quot;
&quot; should a change in the offer form become possible as a result of changes in the technology and trade , the two parties agree to each other before introducing such a change in the committee mentioned under number 10 to find an appropriate solution . &quot;
&quot; in the event that the Community claims the clause , it oblig@@ ates itself to ensure that the access to Argentina within this agreement is not affected by the Community market . &quot;
&quot; in the event that imports from Argentina exceed the agreed amount , the Community reserves the right to susp@@ end imports from Argentina for the rest of the year . &quot;

&quot; the total quantity referred to under number 2 is determined by the day of Greece &apos;s accession to the community to 23@@ ,000 tons of car@@ c@@ ass weight . &quot;
&quot; the community assumes everything to avoid market development , which could affect the marketing of Argent@@ ine Hamm@@ el and lamb meat on the joint market within the agreed amount . &quot;
&quot; in particular , the community makes provisions so that the sales of intervention stocks of frozen meat is not under@@ min@@ ed due to the provision of the Ord@@ in@@ ance to the sales of Argent@@ ine Hamm@@ el and lamb meat . &quot;
&quot; taking into account the objectives and provisions of this agreement , the community agre@@ es that any actual application of reimbur@@ s@@ ements or other promotion measures for the export of Hamm@@ el and lamb meat as well as for the slaughter of certain living sheep and lam@@ bs takes place only at prices and conditions that comply with the existing international obligations and take into account the traditional share of the community at world trade with these products . &quot;
&quot; these terms can be interpreted in a way compatible with Article XVI of the GAT@@ T and in particular Article 10 ( 2 letter c ) of the Convention on the interpretation and application of the article VI , XVI and XX@@ III of the general customs and trade agreement . &quot;
&quot; Argentina guarantees compliance with this agreement , in particular by gran@@ ting out amounts of export licens@@ ing licenses for the products listed under this agreement . &quot;
&quot; the Community is committed to meeting all necessary precau@@ tions , so that the distribution of import licenses for the a@@ forem@@ en@@ tioned products with origin in Argentina is made dependent on the submission of a export licence which is granted by the authorities designated by the Argent@@ ine@@ an government . &quot;
the details of the application of this system are determined in such a way that the position of a deposit for the distribution of the import license for frag@@ ile products can be disp@@ ens@@ ed .
&quot; in addition , it is stipul@@ ated that the competent Argent@@ ine@@ an authority of the competent authority of the Community in regular intervals has been issued for the export licens@@ ing purposes ; these data may be en@@ code to destination country if necessary . &quot;
the committee is responsible for ensuring that the agreement is properly applied and functioning smoothly .
&quot; it perio@@ dic@@ ally checks the tendency on the hammer , lamb and goat meat market of the two parties and on the global market as well as the sales conditions on these markets , including the conditions which are of significance for this purpose under number 7 . &quot;
&quot; the committee is responsible for ensuring that the proper application of this agreement is not imp@@ aired by the fact that products from Hamm@@ el , lamb and goat meat may not be carried out under the agreement mentioned in the agreement . &quot;
the Committee appe@@ als all questions arising during the implementation of this agreement and recommends the appropriate solutions to the competent authorities .
the provisions of this Agreement shall be deemed un@@ affected by the rights and obligations of the parties within the GAT@@ T .

&quot; binding wording of this protocol , which is binding in English , French and Russian wording , will be depos@@ ited with the Secretary @-@ General of the United Nations . &quot;
&quot; before shipment , containers and in@@ fusion devices are provided with a label drawn in English and French , corresponding to the pattern contained in the plants 2 to 10 of this protocol . &quot;
human blood blood must be shipped only in containers in which the temperature can be kept at 4 C to 6 C during the entire transport .
&quot; the preparations named in Part II of this protocol must be ster@@ ile , anti@@ gens and non @-@ toxic . &quot;
&quot; it is recommended to add the tools necessary for the in@@ fusion , as well as the solvents for dry preparation . &quot;
human blood blood is taken from a healthy man and mixed with a suitable anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant .
&quot; C ) which are not free of diseases transmitted by blood trans@@ fu@@ sions , as far as this can be ensured by simple medical examination and medical history . &quot;
&quot; blood removal is as@@ ep@@ tic ; the blood is gli@@ ding through a closed , ster@@ ile tube system into a ster@@ ile bottle , into which the anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant solution was sealed prior to ster@@ il@@ isation . &quot;
&quot; after the blood withdrawal is finished , the bottle is immediately closed and cooled down to a temperature of 4 C to 6 C . afterwards , it must be opened immediately before using the blood . &quot;
&quot; the anti @-@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant solution may not exceed 220 ml per liter of human whole blood , and the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in concentration may not exceed 97 g per liter . &quot;
the blood group after the A @-@ B @-@ 0 system is to be determined before the blood cells and the ser@@ um ; the determination of the R@@ h factor is carried out by exam@@ ining the blood cells on a new sample of the don@@ or blood .
&quot; as far as it is standardized or recommended for blood group determination in individual countries , these are to be applied . &quot;
&quot; the designation R@@ h @-@ negative is only to be used if specific examinations have submitted the non @-@ exist@@ ance of the anti@@ gens C , D , Du and E . &quot;
the blood that is exchanged according to this agreement should only be used for recei@@ vers of the respective AB @-@ 0 group .
&quot; the human full blood is stored in ster@@ ile , sealed bottle from micro@@ organisms and to keep up to its use at a temperature of 4 to 6 C . &quot;
&quot; a concentrate of human red blood cells is a unity of human whole blood , from which the largest part of the plasma has been removed . &quot;
it contains all red blood cells of the unit from which it has been won ; other blood cells can be present or may have been partially removed .
the liquid level of the concentr@@ ates consists of either the rest of the plasma or a suitable is@@ ot@@ onic artificial water solution which was added after removal of plasma .
&quot; the volume of the red blood cells is to be between 65 and 75 % of the total volume of the product ; however , a higher concentration of red blood cells is used , so the approxim@@ ate percentage of ery@@ thro@@ cy@@ te volume is to be applied to the label . &quot;
&quot; all processes required for manufacturing must be carried out under as@@ ep@@ tic conditions . the wa@@ ver@@ ing must be carried out using a ster@@ ile , closed system and only by pressure . &quot;
&quot; an artificial water solution has been added , so on the label it is also possible to indicate their volume and composition . &quot;
&quot; the human dry plasma is extracted through de@@ hydr@@ ation of the liquid , which is depos@@ ited at cent@@ ri@@ fu@@ gation or sedi@@ mentation of human full blood . &quot;
the human dry plasma is obtained by cold drying or any other method by which a den@@ atur@@ ation of the proteins is avoided .
&quot; the dry product can easily be dissolved in a quantity of water , which corresponds to the amount of liquids , from which one proce@@ eded in the production of the substance . &quot;
&quot; the protein concentration of the solution extracted should not be less than 45 g per litre , and the solution must not have visible signs of hem@@ oly@@ sis products . &quot;
donations in which ( using a sample ) have been as@@ cer@@ tained a dangerous sal@@ ary of in@@ sole hem@@ ol@@ ys@@ in or immune ha@@ em@@ o@@ dium glut@@ in@@ ine are to be excluded .
&quot; if the plasma is not mixed and frozen within 48 hours after the blood withdrawal , the ster@@ ility of each unit must be detected in a blood quantity of at least 10 ml . &quot;
&quot; to eliminate the harmful effects of bacterial growth in plasma , blood donations , the signs of bacterial infection , are not used ; the ster@@ ility of each donation must be detected in a blood quantity of at least 10 ml . &quot;
&quot; in order to reduce the risk of transfer of ino@@ cul@@ ation , it is necessary to take compounds which do not contain more than 12 donations , or to apply other methods to reduce this risk in a comparable way . &quot;
&quot; one of the liquid quantity , from which one proce@@ eded in the production of the plasma , is to be added ; the substance must be completely dissolved within 10 minutes at 15 to 20 C . &quot;
&quot; a given qu@@ antum plasma is dissolved in the amount of water , which corresponds to the amount of liquid that it has been produced ; the solution is subjected to the following tests : &quot;
&quot; II ) If the solution requires a sufficient quantity of th@@ rom@@ bo@@ de or calcium chlori@@ de , the process can be accelerated ; the process can be accelerated in the brood @-@ kil@@ n at 37 C . &quot;
&quot; due to the 24 @-@ stage drying process in the presence of phosph@@ or@@ pent@@ oxi@@ des under a pressure of a maximum of 0.0@@ 2 mm mer@@ cury , weight loss may not occur in human dry plasma . &quot;
&quot; human dry plasma is stored in a nitrogen atmosphere or in the air @-@ empty space in a ster@@ ile , sealed bottle under exclusion of any micro@@ organisms and by means of any kind of moisture ; it must be protected from light and to keep temperature below 20 C . &quot;

the contrac@@ ting parties of the European Convention of 15 December 1958 on the exchange of therapeutic substances of human origin ( referred to as &quot; Convention &quot; ) -
&quot; based on Article 5 paragraph 1 of the Convention , according to which &quot; the contrac@@ ting parties take all necessary measures &quot; to free the therapeutic substances provided by the other parties from all input conditions ; &quot;
&quot; considering that for the Member States of the European Economic Community , the obligation to grant this exemp@@ tion is attri@@ but@@ able to the jurisdiction of the community which has been established after the contract by which it has been established ; &quot;
whereas it is necessary for the implementation of Article 5 paragraph 1 of the Convention is necessary that the European Economic Community can become the contrac@@ ting party of the Convention -
the Convention applies to the community on the first day of the month in force following the signature .
&quot; it enters into force on the first day of the month , following the day after which the last of the contrac@@ ting parties has depos@@ ited their acceptance certificate at the Secretary General of the Council of Europe . &quot;
&quot; ( 2 ) however , after the exp@@ ir@@ ation of two years after the date in force to which it has been applied , this supplementary protocol shall be deemed to have been issued , unless one of the contrac@@ ting parties has notified a obj@@ ection to its entry into force . &quot;
&quot; from that point onwards , a state cannot become the contrac@@ ting party of the Convention without becoming the contrac@@ ting party of the additional protocol . &quot;
&quot; the Secretary @-@ General of the Council of Europe noti@@ fies the Member States of the Council of Europe , all states assigned to the Convention and the European Economic Community every acceptance or obj@@ ection in accordance with Article 2 and the time of entry into force of this supplementary protocol according to Article 2 . &quot;
&quot; the Secretary @-@ General of the European Economic Community also noti@@ fies any act , notification or communication relating to this Convention . &quot;
&quot; considering that it is highly desirable if Member States , if necessary , support each other in the spirit of European solidarity in the procurement of re@@ agents for blood group determination , &quot;
&quot; considering that this mutual support is only possible if the provision and use of these re@@ agents for blood group determination are subject to the rules imposed by Member States , and the necessary relief and exceptions for their import shall be granted . &quot;
&quot; in the sense of this Convention , the term &quot; re@@ agents to the blood group determination &quot; re@@ agents of human , animal , plant and other origin for blood group determination and determination of blood disp@@ arities . &quot;
&quot; any contractual party may limit the application of this Convention on re@@ agents of human origin for the purpose of the signing of this Convention or in the am@@ ending of its rati@@ fication , approval or accession to the Council of Europe by an declaration addressed to the Secretary @-@ General of the Council of Europe . &quot;
the declaration may be with@@ drawn at any time by an notification addressed to the Secretary @-@ General of the Council of Europe .
&quot; the contrac@@ ting parties undertake to leave re@@ agents to determine the costs of their extraction , preparation and promotion as well as the purchase price of other contrac@@ ting parties , which they urg@@ ently need , provided they have sufficient supplies for their own needs . &quot;
&quot; re@@ agents for blood group determination will only be made available to other contrac@@ ting parties , so that no profit is associated with that they are only used for medical purposes and only designated by the governments involved . &quot;
each consi@@ gn@@ ment of re@@ agents to determine the blood group &apos;s determination is to add a certificate in accordance with the regulations of the protocol .
the protocol and its system represent an administrative arrangement that may be am@@ ended or supple@@ mented by the governments of the contrac@@ ting parties of this Convention .
the contrac@@ ting parties meet all the necessary measures to free the re@@ agents provided by other contrac@@ ting parties to determine the blood group determination of all input data .
they also meet all necessary measures to ensure that these substances are quickly and in the short@@ est way to the recipients indicated in Article 3 .
the parties agree to each other via the Secretary @-@ General of the Council of Europe a list of positions authorised for the issu@@ ing of the certificate en@@ vis@@ aged in Article 4 .
these positions should be identical with the positions designated in Article 6 of the European Convention on the exchange of therapeutic substances of human origin .
&quot; this Convention is signed for the members of the Council of Europe for signing ; they may become the contrac@@ ting party , by signing it a ) without reservation of rati@@ fication or authorisation , or &quot;
&quot; this Convention shall enter into force a month after the day , on which three members of the Council have signed it under Article 7 without reservation of rati@@ fication or approval , or have rati@@ fied or approved it . &quot;
&quot; for any member who signed or approved this Agreement later without reservation of rati@@ fication or approval , or approved , it enters into force a month after its signature or the resign@@ ation of the rati@@ fication or approval certificate . &quot;
&quot; following the entry into force of this Convention , the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe can invite each non @-@ member state to join the Convention . &quot;
the Secretary @-@ General of the Council of Europe noti@@ fies the members of the Council and the United States ( a ) the time of entry into force of this Convention and the names of the members who have signed or approved it without reservation of rati@@ fication or approval ;
any contrac@@ ting party may termin@@ ate this agreement with the notification of a period of one year by advertisement to the Secretary @-@ General of the Council of Europe .
a re@@ agent to the blood group determination must react with all tested blood samples that contain the an@@ tigen which is hom@@ olog@@ ated to the anti@@ body or any other substance stated on the label .
&quot; if a re@@ agent is used in the manner recommended by the manufacturer , the following factors or phenomena may not occur : a ) hem@@ oly@@ tic properties ; &quot;
the ti@@ ter is measured by repeated di@@ lution of the re@@ agent to be investigated on double in a suitable medium .
the ti@@ ter is the reci@@ pro@@ cal value of the number of the strongest di@@ lution in which a reaction occurs ; di@@ lution is calculated exclusively of the volume of the blood cell floo@@ ding in the total volume .
&quot; for anti @-@ A , anti @-@ B or other re@@ agents used on object carriers , the activity is expressed by the time required for ag@@ glut@@ ination on an object carrier . &quot;
&quot; the World Health Organization has established international standards for anti @-@ A and anti @-@ B as well as in@@ complete anti @-@ D re@@ agents for blood group determination , and for re@@ agents of other speci@@ fic@@ ity , nor@@ ms are elabor@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; according to definition , an International Standard Prepar@@ ation contains a certain number of international units per mg or ml , and this definition is independent of the ti@@ ters observed in individual preparations of red blood cells ( 1 ) . &quot;
( 1 ) The effectiveness of re@@ agents to determine the blood group determination of most specialties is expressed as ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ation@@ ally observed in a series of th@@ inners in a ery@@ thro@@ cy@@ tic in@@ undation .
the ti@@ ter speci@@ fies di@@ lution of the re@@ agent in the last mixture within a series where micro@@ sc@@ opic visible ag@@ glut@@ ination occurs .
&quot; the effectiveness of re@@ agents for blood group determination , which are available for the International Standard Prepar@@ ations ( currently Anti @-@ A and Anti @-@ B as well as Anti @-@ D ) , can be expressed in comparison with the International Standard Prepar@@ ation or a State Standards Prepar@@ ation in International Units ( see Bulletin WHO O@@ MS 1954 , 10 , 9@@ 37 , 9@@ 41 - 1950 , 3 , 301 . ) . &quot;
&quot; if you bring them back to a volume of 1 ml , the Anti @-@ A and Anti @-@ B S@@ eren contain 256 international units per ml . &quot;
&quot; the preparations are available free of charge from the International Laboratory for biological Standards of the World Health Organization , Stat@@ ens Ser@@ um Institute , Copenhagen . &quot;
the following table shows an example of a compar@@ ative ti@@ tr@@ ation of the International Anti @-@ A ( S ) and an &quot; unknown &quot; anti @-@ A re@@ agent ( U ) against red blood cells A1 and red blood cells A@@ 2B . &gt; PI@@ C FI@@ LE = &quot; T@@ 00@@ 450@@ 83 &quot; &gt;
&quot; if a re@@ agent is stored under the conditions recommended by the manufacturer , its required properties should be maintained at least one year . &quot;
the exp@@ iry date of a re@@ agent in flu@@ oric form according to the label is at most one year after the last satis@@ factory efficacy test .
the exp@@ iry date for dry re@@ agents on the label is based on the results of the trials ; it is appro@@ ached by the state super@@ visory authorities .
&quot; dry re@@ agents are stored in an atmosphere of in@@ ert gas or in a vacuum , in the glass container in which they have been dried and which is so closed that no moisture may enter . &quot;
dry re@@ agent may at most lose 0.5 v.@@ H. of its weight if it is tested by further drying over phosph@@ or@@ pent@@ oxide at a pressure of no more than 0.0@@ 2 mm Hg within 24 hours .
&quot; in order to prevent bacterial growth , the competent state authority can determine that the agent ( or the solvent supplied with the dry re@@ agents ) is added to an anti@@ sep@@ tic and / or antibiotic , provided that the re@@ agent with the added substance continues to apply the requirements for speci@@ fic@@ ity and effectiveness . &quot;
sera human origin for blood group determination must contain at least 2.5 mg of egg @-@ nitrogen per ml flu@@ ent or re @-@ dissolved ser@@ um .
&quot; re@@ agents , regardless whether in a flu@@ ent form or after the re @-@ release , must be transparent and must not contain neither sedi@@ ments nor gels or visible particles . &quot;
&quot; the re@@ agents for the international exchange of re@@ agents for blood group determination should not be arti@@ fici@@ ally colored as far as possible , at least until an international agreement has come about through a uniform system . &quot;
re@@ agents for blood group determination are to be distributed in such a way and in such quantities that the re@@ agent in a container is not only sufficient to carry out tests with the unknown blood cells but also to carry out tests with positive and negative control blood cells .
the quantity in a container must be so large that the contents may be used to carry out the efficacy tests described in this protocol .
the manufacturer &apos;s laboratory has to carry out written records on all stages of production and insp@@ ections of re@@ agents .
&quot; appropriate samples of all re@@ agents spent in the laboratory are so long kept from the laboratory , until some probability can be assumed that the batch is no longer used . &quot;
&quot; re@@ agents used for blood group determination can contain substances of human , animal , plant ( or mineral ) origin ; some of these represent the effective proportion , the others are the necessary aids to rein@@ force the efficacy and maintenance of the stability of the re@@ agent . &quot;
&quot; for technical reasons , these re@@ agents are divided into three groups according to the origin of their effective part . &quot;
&quot; this does not mean that the re@@ agents of human origin contain substances of human origin , or that animal or herbal re@@ agents cannot contain substances of human origin . &quot;
&quot; on each individual container is a black printed label in English and French , which contains the following information : 1 . name and address of the manufacturer , &quot;
&quot; the quantity or , with dried re@@ agents , the quantity and composition of the liquid needed for re @-@ release , &quot;
&quot; furthermore , this label or the label on the box in which the individual containers are located , or the instructions attached to the containers : 1 . full name and address of the manufacturer , &quot;

an anti @-@ B ser@@ um is parallel to the re @-@ dissolved but un@@ dil@@ uted international standard preparation of the anti @-@ B blood group ser@@ um or a corresponding compar@@ ative par@@ at against a in@@ undation of B @-@ blood cells .
&quot; anti @-@ B ser@@ um is mixed on an object carrier with an equal amount of 5 to 10 percent in@@ undation of B @-@ blood cells , so the ag@@ glut@@ ination must occur within the double period that is necessary if the same attempt with the re @-@ dissolved , but un@@ dil@@ uted international standard preparation of the anti @-@ B blood group ser@@ um or with a standard prepar@@ edness of equal avi@@ dity is performed . &quot;
&quot; anti @-@ A + anti @-@ B ( group 0 ) Ser@@ um is obtained from the blood of selected persons of group 0 , which can be immun@@ ised by red blood cells or specific substances of the group A and group B . &quot;
&quot; anti @-@ A + anti @-@ B ( group 0 ) Ser@@ um ag@@ glut@@ inate human red blood cells containing ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ous A and / or B , i.e. those of group A including the sub@@ groups A1 and A2 of group B and group AB including sub@@ groups A@@ 1@@ B and A@@ 2B ; it ag@@ glut@@ inated no human red blood cells that do not contain ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ous A or B , i.e. those of group 0 . &quot;
it ag@@ glut@@ ates human red blood cells containing the A@@ x ( A@@ y or A@@ o ) an@@ tigen ( which are generally not ag@@ glut@@ inated by the group B by anti @-@ A ser@@ um of blood don@@ ors ) .
&quot; an anti @-@ A + anti @-@ B ( group 0 ) Ser@@ um is parallel to the re @-@ dissolved , but un@@ dil@@ uted international standard preparation of the anti @-@ A blood group ser@@ um or a corresponding compar@@ ative par@@ at , separated against in@@ undation of A1 and A2 blood cells . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , it is parallel to the re @-@ dissolved , but un@@ dil@@ uted international standard preparation of the anti @-@ B blood group ser@@ um or a corresponding compar@@ ative par@@ at against a in@@ undation of B @-@ blood cells . &quot;
&quot; in no case , the effectiveness of the ser@@ um may not be less than 64 international units per ml . &quot;
un@@ dil@@ uted used anti @-@ A + anti @-@ B ( group 0 ) blood ser@@ um must also cause a det@@ ectable ag@@ glut@@ ination of the blood cells of the A@@ x group ( A@@ y or A@@ o ) .
&quot; if an anti @-@ A + anti @-@ B ( group 0 ) Ser@@ um is mixed on an object carrier with equal amounts of 5 to 10 percent in@@ undation of A1 and A2 blood cells , the ag@@ glut@@ ination must occur within the double period that is necessary if the same attempts with the re @-@ dissolved , but un@@ dil@@ uted international standard preparation of the anti @-@ A blood group ser@@ um or with a standard preparation of equal activity are performed . &quot;
&quot; anti @-@ A + anti @-@ B ( group 0 ) Ser@@ um is mixed on an object carrier with a same amount of 5- to 10@@ percent in@@ undation of B @-@ blood cells , so the ag@@ glut@@ ination must occur within the double period that is necessary if the same attempt with the re @-@ dissolved , but un@@ dil@@ uted international standard preparation of the anti @-@ B blood group ser@@ um or a standard prepar@@ edness of equal avi@@ dity is performed . &quot;
&quot; an anti @-@ A + an anti @-@ B ( group 0 ) Ser@@ um is mixed on an object carrier with the same amount of 5 to 10 percent blood cells ( A@@ y or A@@ o ) , so ag@@ glut@@ ination must occur within 5 minutes at a temperature of 18 to 25 ° C. &quot;
anti @-@ R@@ h blood group sera of each speci@@ fic@@ ity may belong to one of two species that are distinguished by the pre@@ conditions under which an ag@@ glut@@ ination of hom@@ olog@@ ous blood cells is reached .
&quot; with others that are referred to as &quot; in@@ complete , &quot; ag@@ glut@@ ination can only be achieved in the presence of certain col@@ lo@@ ids , such as beef cal@@ f , or by means of other special methods . &quot;
&quot; some &quot; &quot; in@@ complete &quot; &quot; Ser@@ a ag@@ glut@@ inate on object carriers also hom@@ olog@@ ous red blood cells , which are absorbed in their own ser@@ um or plasma . &quot;
the following requirements for the effectiveness of Ser@@ a to determine the R@@ h group may possibly change when international standard preparations are available . ( i ) Anti @-@ D ( Anti @-@ Rh@@ o ) blood group ser@@ um ( human )
anti @-@ D ser@@ um is obtained from the blood of one or more persons which are imm@@ uni@@ zed by the tigen D of the R@@ h system .
&quot; it re@@ acts with human red blood cells containing the an@@ tigen D , but not with human red blood cells that do not contain the an@@ tigen D . &quot;
&quot; complete &quot; &quot; anti @-@ D Ser@@ a must have a ti@@ ter of at least 1 : 32 compared to C@@ c@@ De@@ e &apos;s blood cells in a 0,@@ 9 % sal@@ ine solution . &quot;
&quot; a &quot; &quot; complete &quot; &quot; anti @-@ D ser@@ um is parallel to the re @-@ dissolved , but un@@ dil@@ uted international standard preparation of the in@@ complete anti @-@ D ( Anti @-@ Rh@@ o ) ser@@ um or a corresponding compar@@ ative par@@ at opposite C@@ c@@ De@@ e blood cells . &quot;
&quot; in addition to a reaction with all red blood cells containing the an@@ tigen D , the ser@@ um will be able to react with blood cells , the do @-@ an@@ tigen . &quot;
&quot; anti @-@ D Ser@@ a , which are intended for use of object carriers in accordance with the test according to Diamond and Ab@@ el@@ son , must have visible ag@@ glut@@ ination within 30 seconds , and ag@@ glut@@ ination must be complete within 120 seconds . &quot;
anti @-@ C ser@@ um is obtained from the blood of one or more people which are imm@@ uni@@ zed by the ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ogen C of the R@@ h system .
&quot; it re@@ acts with floo@@ ding of human red blood cells containing the an@@ tigen C , but not with human red blood cells that do not contain the C an@@ tigen . &quot;
these ser@@ a are therefore only specific for the C @-@ an@@ tigen when the blood cells tested are suspended in a 0.@@ 9@@ percent sal@@ ine solution .
the ti@@ ter of the anti @-@ C Ser@@ a ( &quot; complete &quot; or &quot; in@@ complete &quot; ) must be at least 1 : 8 towards C@@ cd@@ dee blood cells .
&quot; anti @-@ C Ser@@ a , which are intended for use on object carriers in accordance with the test according to Diamond and Ab@@ el@@ son ( and no form of anti @-@ D ) must have visible ag@@ glut@@ ination within 30 seconds , and ag@@ glut@@ ination must be complete within 120 seconds . &quot;
anti @-@ E ser@@ um is obtained from the blood of one or more persons which are imm@@ uni@@ zed by the an@@ tigen E of the R@@ h system .
anti @-@ E Ser@@ a ( &quot; complete &quot; or &quot; in@@ complete &quot; ) should have a ti@@ ter of at least 1 : 8 towards C@@ c@@ dd@@ E@@ e blood cells .
&quot; anti @-@ E Ser@@ a , which are intended for use on object carriers in accordance with the test according to Diamond and Ab@@ el@@ son ( and in no form anti @-@ D ) must have visible ag@@ glut@@ ination within 30 seconds , and ag@@ glut@@ ination must be completed within 120 seconds . &quot;
sera of speci@@ fic@@ ity anti @-@ D + -@@ C and speci@@ fic@@ ity anti @-@ D + -@@ E can be obtained directly from the blood of immun@@ ised people or can be produced by mixing anti @-@ D with anti @-@ C or anti @-@ E ser@@ um .
&quot; in a given server , both antibodies must be effective at the same time under the reaction conditions specified by the manufacturer . &quot;
&quot; if a ser@@ um is intended for use on object carriers in accordance with the test according to Diamond and Ab@@ el@@ son , the ag@@ glut@@ ination period should not be smaller in all types of red blood cells , which show a reaction , not less than in the anti@@ body antibodies . &quot;
&quot; anti @-@ A ser@@ um is obtained from the blood of animals , which can be immun@@ ised by blood cells or specific substances of the group A . &quot;
&quot; anti @-@ A Ser@@ um ag@@ glut@@ inate human red blood cells containing A @-@ an@@ tigen , i.e. those of the blood groups A and AB including the sub@@ groups A1 , A2 , A@@ 1@@ B and A@@ 2B ; it ag@@ glut@@ inated not contain human red blood cells that do not contain a A @-@ tigen , i.e. those of blood groups 0 and B . &quot;
&quot; an anti @-@ A ser@@ um is , in parallel to the re @-@ dissolved , but un@@ dil@@ uted international standard preparation of the anti @-@ A blood group ser@@ um or a corresponding compar@@ ative par@@ at , separated with in@@ undation of A1 , A2 and A@@ 2B red blood cells ( 1 ) . &quot;
&quot; anti @-@ A ser@@ um is mixed on an object carrier with an equal amount of 5 to 10 percent in@@ undation of A@@ 1- , A@@ 2- and A@@ 2B blood cells , which is necessary if the same attempt with the re @-@ dissolved , but un@@ dil@@ uted international standard preparation of the anti @-@ A blood group ser@@ um or a standard prepar@@ edness of equal avi@@ dity is performed . &quot;
&quot; anti @-@ B ser@@ um is obtained from the blood of animals , which can be immun@@ ised by red blood cells or specific substances of the blood group B . &quot;
&quot; anti @-@ B Ser@@ um ag@@ glut@@ inate human red blood cells containing B an@@ tigen , i.e. those of the blood groups B and AB ; it ag@@ glut@@ inated no human red blood cells containing no B an@@ tigen , i.e. those of blood groups 0 and A . &quot;
&quot; an anti @-@ B ser@@ um is , in parallel to the re @-@ dissolved , but un@@ dil@@ uted international standard preparation of the anti @-@ B blood group ser@@ um or a corresponding compar@@ ative par@@ at , with a flood of blood cells of group B to ti@@ dy ( 1 ) . &quot;
&quot; anti @-@ B ser@@ um is mixed on an object carrier with an equal amount of 5 to 10 percent in@@ undation of B @-@ blood cells , so the ag@@ glut@@ ination must occur within the double period that is necessary if the same attempt is carried out with the re @-@ dissolved , but un@@ dil@@ uted international standard preparation of the anti @-@ B blood group ser@@ um or with a standard prepar@@ edness of equal avi@@ dity . &quot;
anti @-@ human glob@@ ulin @-@ ser@@ um for use in blood group ser@@ ology must contain ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ating antibodies against Ig@@ G glob@@ ulin and ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ating antibodies against comple@@ mentary factors .
&quot; it is obtained from the blood of animals , which are imm@@ uni@@ zed by injection of human ser@@ um proteins . &quot;
&quot; if it is used by the manufacturer &apos;s prescription , there is no un@@ loaded human red blood cells , regardless of which blood group they belong to . &quot;

&quot; in the same or another di@@ lution on the label , it must also ag@@ glut@@ inate human red blood cells which are sensi@@ ti@@ zed in the presence of fresh human ser@@ um with weak complex@@ ion binding in@@ complete anti @-@ Lea antibodies . &quot;
&quot; for clinical use , the loading with all types of the a@@ forem@@ en@@ tioned in@@ complete antibodies should be det@@ ectable with a single di@@ lution of the anti @-@ human glob@@ ulin level . &quot;
anti @-@ A re@@ agent is obtained by extraction from seed or other parts of a suitable plant and if necessary subsequent cleaning .
&quot; the anti @-@ A re@@ agent ag@@ glut@@ ates human red blood cells that contain A @-@ anti@@ gens , i.e. those of the blood groups A and AB including the sub@@ groups A1 , A2 , A@@ 1@@ B and A@@ 2B ; it ag@@ glut@@ inated not contain human red blood cells that do not contain a A @-@ tigen , i.e. those of the blood groups 0 and B . &quot;
&quot; an anti @-@ A re@@ agent is parallel to the re @-@ dissolved , but un@@ dil@@ uted international standard preparation of the anti @-@ A blood group ser@@ um or a corresponding par@@ amount , se@@ per@@ ated against in@@ undation of A@@ 1- , A@@ 2- and A@@ 2B blood cells ( 1 ) . &quot;
the effectiveness of the re@@ agent must in no case amount to less than 64 international units per ml .
&quot; anti @-@ A re@@ agent is mixed on an object carrier with an equal amount of 5 to 10 percent in@@ undation of A@@ 1- , A@@ 2- and A@@ 2B blood cells which is necessary if the same attempt with the re @-@ dissolved , but un@@ dil@@ uted international standard preparation of the anti @-@ A blood group ser@@ um or with a standard preparation of equal avi@@ dity ( ii ) anti @-@ B blood group re@@ agent ( veget@@ al ) &quot;
anti @-@ B re@@ agent is obtained by extraction from the corresponding part of a suitable plant and if necessary subsequent cleaning .
&quot; the anti @-@ B re@@ agent ag@@ glut@@ inate human red blood cells containing ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ogen B , i.e. those of the blood groups B and AB ; it ag@@ glut@@ inated no human red blood cells containing no ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ogen B , i.e. those of blood groups 0 and A . &quot;
&quot; anti @-@ B Re@@ agent is mixed on an object carrier with an equal amount of 5 to 10 percent in@@ undation of B @-@ blood cells , so the ag@@ glut@@ ination must occur within the double period that is necessary if the same attempt is carried out with the re @-@ dissolved , but un@@ dil@@ uted international standard preparation of the anti @-@ B blood group ser@@ um or a standard prepar@@ edness of equal avi@@ dity . &quot;
