&quot; it is available as a 5 mg , 10 mg , 15 mg and 30 mg tablets , 10 mg , 15 mg and 30 mg enam@@ el tablets ( tablets that are dis@@ solving in the mouth ) , as a solution to take ( 1 mg / ml ) and as an injection solution ( 7.5 mg / ml ) . &quot;
&quot; • Bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , a psych@@ ic disease in which patients have man@@ ic epis@@ odes ( periods of abnormal mood ) altern@@ ating with periods of normal mood . &quot;
ABI@@ LI@@ F@@ Y is used to treat moderate to severe man@@ ic epis@@ odes and proph@@ yla@@ xis of man@@ ic epis@@ odes in patients who have responded to the medicine in the past .
the injection solution is used for rapid control of increased rest@@ lessness or behavi@@ our@@ al disorders if the oral dosage of the medicine is not possible .
&quot; in both diseases , the solution can be used for inser@@ tion or melting tablets in patients with difficulty swal@@ lowing tablets . &quot;
&quot; in patients who are taking other medicines at the same time , as well as ABI@@ LI@@ F@@ Y , the dose of ABI@@ LI@@ F@@ Y should be adjusted . &quot;
&quot; this im@@ pairs the signal transmission between brain cells by &quot; neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ smit@@ ters , &quot; i.e. chemical substances that enable communication of nerve cells among each other . &quot;
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole probably mainly acts as a &quot; partial ag@@ ony &quot; for rec@@ ept@@ ors for neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ sm@@ itter dop@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin ( also called ser@@ ot@@ onin ) .
&quot; this means that Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole is like 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin and dop@@ amine , but in less measure than the neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ smit@@ ters to activate the rec@@ ept@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; as dop@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amine play a role in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole contributes to norm@@ alizing the activity of the brain , thereby reducing psych@@ otic or man@@ ic symptoms and their re@@ occurrence is prevented . &quot;
the efficacy of ABI@@ LI@@ F@@ Y to prevent re@@ occurrence of symptoms has been studied in three studies of up to one year .
the efficacy of the injection solution was compared in two studies in 805 patients with schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia or similar diseases that suffered from increased un@@ rest over a period of two hours with a plac@@ ebo .
&quot; in another study , A@@ bili@@ fy was compared over twelve weeks to 347 patients with Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol , in another study the effectiveness of ABI@@ LI@@ F@@ Y and plac@@ ebo to prevent re@@ occurrence to 160 patients in which the man@@ ic symptoms have already been stabili@@ zed with ABI@@ LI@@ X . &quot;
&quot; the efficacy of A@@ bili@@ fy Inj@@ ection solution was compared to 301 patients with bi@@ polar disorder , which suffered from increased un@@ rest , compared with Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( another anti @-@ psych@@ otic ) and plac@@ ebo over a period of two hours . &quot;
&quot; in all studies , the change in the symptoms of the patients was investigated using a standard scale for bi@@ polar disorder or the number of patients who responded to treatment . &quot;
the company also carried out studies to investigate how the body absor@@ bs the enam@@ el tablets and the solution to absor@@ b ( decre@@ ases ) .
&quot; in the two studies with the injection solution , patients who received A@@ bili@@ fy in dos@@ es of 5.@@ 25 mg , 9.@@ 75 mg , or 15 mg were a significantly greater reduction in symptoms of increased un@@ rest than patients receiving plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; when applying for the treatment of bi@@ polar disorder , ABI@@ LI@@ F@@ Y reduced in four of the five short @-@ term studies of man@@ ic symptoms more effective than plac@@ ebo . &quot;
ABI@@ LI@@ F@@ Y also prev@@ ailed for up to 74 weeks more effective than plac@@ ebo @-@ recur@@ rence of man@@ ic epis@@ odes in previously untreated patients and when it was ad@@ ministered additionally to an existing treatment .
ABI@@ LI@@ F@@ Y inj@@ ections in 10- or 15 mg dos@@ es also reduced more effective than plac@@ ebo the symptoms of increased rest@@ lessness and were similarly effective as Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am .
&quot; the most common side effects of A@@ bili@@ fy to take ( observed in 1 to 10 out of 100 patients ) are extra@@ pyram@@ idal dys@@ functions , neu@@ rop@@ athy ( drow@@ sin@@ ess ) , drow@@ sin@@ ess ( drow@@ sin@@ ess ) , drow@@ sin@@ ess ( drow@@ sin@@ ess ) , vom@@ iting , nau@@ sea ( drow@@ sin@@ ess ) , vom@@ iting , nau@@ sea ( drow@@ sin@@ ess ) , vom@@ it ( drow@@ sin@@ ess ) , drow@@ sin@@ ess , in@@ som@@ nia ( sleep disorders ) and anxiety . &quot;
&quot; the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of ABI@@ LI@@ F@@ Y in the treatment of schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and moderate to severe man@@ ic epis@@ odes in bi@@ polar disorder , as well as the prevention of a new man@@ ic episode in patients who responded to the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , out@@ wei@@ gh the risks . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the committee came to the conclusion that the benefits of injection solution in rapid control of increased rest@@ lessness and behavi@@ our@@ al distur@@ bances in patients with schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia or in patients with man@@ ic epis@@ odes in bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder when oral therapy is not suitable to out@@ wei@@ gh the risks . &quot;
&quot; in June 2004 , the European Commission granted the company Ot@@ su@@ ka Pharmaceu@@ tical Europe Ltd . approval for the transport of ABI@@ LI@@ F@@ Y in the entire European Union . &quot;
ABI@@ LI@@ F@@ Y is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe man@@ ic epis@@ odes of bi@@ polar disorder and for the prevention of a new man@@ ic episode in patients who had predominantly man@@ ic epis@@ odes and their man@@ ic epis@@ odes addressed to the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the recommended starting dose for ABI@@ LI@@ F@@ Y is 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day once daily regardless of meals .
&quot; increased effectiveness in dos@@ es over a daily dose of 15 mg has not been detected , although individual patients can benefit from a higher dose . &quot;
&quot; the recommended starting dose for ABI@@ LI@@ F@@ Y is 15 mg once a day , regardless of meals as mon@@ otherapy or combination therapy ( see Section 5.1 ) . &quot;
efficacy of ABI@@ LI@@ F@@ Y in the treatment of schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar disorder in patients ≥ 65 years has not been proven .
&quot; with regard to the greater sensitivity of these patients , a lower initial dose should be considered if clinical factors justify this ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; if the C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 in@@ duction is removed from combination therapy , the dosage should be reduced to the recommended dose ( see Section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; the occurrence of su@@ ici@@ dal behaviour belongs to psych@@ otic diseases and aff@@ ective disorders , and was reported in some cases after beginning or after changing an anti@@ psych@@ otic therapy , also in treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( see Section 4.8 ) . &quot;
results of an epide@@ mi@@ ological study showed that in patients with bi@@ polar disorder there was no elevated su@@ icide risk associated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole compared to other anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics .
&quot; Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole should be used with caution in patients with well @-@ known cardiovascular diseases ( m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction or isch@@ em@@ ic heart disease , heart failure , hyp@@ ot@@ onia , treatment with blood pressure lowering drugs ) or hyper@@ tension ( including acute and mal@@ ign@@ ant form ) . &quot;
&quot; 3 Sp@@ ät@@ dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical trials , which lasted one year or less , there were occasional reports of dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia arising during the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole . &quot;
&quot; if patients treated with A@@ bili@@ fy occur signs and symptoms of a late dy@@ mium , it should be considered to reduce the dose or break the treatment . &quot;
&quot; if a patient develops signs and symptoms indic@@ ative of a M@@ NS or un@@ clear high fever without an additional clinical manifestation of M@@ NS , all anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , including ABI@@ LI@@ F@@ Y , must be dism@@ is@@ sed . &quot;
&quot; therefore , in patients with var@@ ic@@ ose inci@@ dents , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole should be used with caution in the an@@ am@@ nes@@ is or at conditions associated with var@@ ic@@ ose inci@@ dents . &quot;
&quot; 56 - 99 years ) with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in patients with psycho@@ sis associated with Alzheimer &apos;s disease , patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole had an increased risk of death compared to plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; however , there were in one of these studies , a study involving a fixed dosage , a significant relationship between dosage and response for undes@@ irable cer@@ eb@@ rov@@ ascular events in patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole . &quot;
&quot; hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia , in some cases extremely and associated with k@@ eto@@ aci@@ dosis or hyper@@ os@@ mol@@ ar coma or death , was reported in patients treated with at@@ yp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic agents , including ABI@@ LI@@ F@@ Y . &quot;
there are no precise risk ass@@ ess@@ ments for hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia @-@ related adverse events in patients treated with ABI@@ LI@@ F@@ Y and other at@@ yp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic agents that allow direct compar@@ isons .
&quot; poly@@ di@@ p@@ sie , poly@@ ur@@ ie , poly@@ ph@@ ag@@ ia and weakness ) are observed and patients with diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or with risk factors for diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus should be regularly monitored in terms of a wor@@ sen@@ ing of glucose levels . &quot;
&quot; weight gain is generally observed in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ic patients and in patients with bi@@ polar man@@ ia due to com@@ or@@ bi@@ di@@ ties , the use of anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , in which weight gain is known as side effect , or an un@@ healthy lifestyle and could lead to serious complications . &quot;
&quot; due to the primary effect of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ zo@@ l on the central nervous system , caution is necessary if Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole is taken in combination with alcohol or other central effective drugs with out@@ lying side effects such as sed@@ ation ( see Section 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; the H2 @-@ antagon@@ ist Fam@@ oti@@ din , a ga@@ stri@@ c acid blo@@ cker , reduces the absorption rate of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , although this effect is considered clin@@ ically not relevant . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical study involving healthy subjects , a highly effective C@@ YP@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ or ( Ch@@ ini@@ din ) increased the AU@@ C of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l by 107 % while the C@@ max remained unchanged . &quot;
&quot; it is expected that other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ YP@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 , such as flu@@ ox@@ et@@ ine and par@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , have similar effects , so similar dose reduc@@ tions should be made . &quot;
&quot; in C@@ YP@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 &apos; bad &apos; ( = &quot; poor &quot; ) metabol@@ ites , the common application with highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ YP@@ 2@@ A4 in higher plasma concentrations in Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l results in more than C@@ YP@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 exten@@ sible metabol@@ ites . &quot;
&quot; considering the joint offering of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole or other highly effective C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors with ABI@@ LI@@ F@@ Y , potential benefits should wei@@ gh potential risks to the patient . &quot;
&quot; other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 , such as i@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole and HIV prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , may have similar effects , so similar dose reduc@@ tions should be made . &quot;
&quot; after placing the C@@ YP@@ 2@@ D@@ 6- or 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors , the dosage of A@@ bili@@ fy should be raised to the dosage level prior to the beginning of the accompanying therapy . &quot;
dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em or esc@@ ital@@ op@@ ram or C@@ YP@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 together with A@@ bili@@ fy can be calculated with a moderate increase in ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole concentrations .
&quot; dos@@ es of 10 @-@ 30 mg of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole per day showed no significant effect on the sub@@ str@@ ates of C@@ YP@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 ( D@@ ex@@ tro@@ meth@@ orph@@ an / 3 @-@ Metho@@ do@@ morph@@ in@@ an ratio ) , 2@@ C@@ 9 ( War@@ far@@ in ) , 2@@ C@@ 19 ( Om@@ ep@@ ra@@ zo@@ l ) and 3@@ A4 ( D@@ ex@@ tro@@ meth@@ ion@@ an ) . &quot;
patients should be advised to notify their doctor if they are pregnant or plan a pregnancy during treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
&quot; because of the lack of data security for humans and the concerns that arise in the animal &apos;s re@@ productive studies , this medicine may not be used in pregnancy unless the possible benefit justi@@ fies the potential risk for the fet@@ us . &quot;
&quot; however , as with other anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , patients should be warned against dangerous machines , including motor vehicles , until they are certain that Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ zo@@ l has no negative influence on them . &quot;
the following adverse events occurred more often ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than plac@@ ebo or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects ( * ) :
&quot; the frequency of side effects listed below is defined according to the following criteria : common ( &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( &gt; 1 / 1.000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) . &quot;
&quot; schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia - In a controlled long @-@ term study more than 52 weeks in patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , a total decreased inci@@ dence ( 25.@@ 8 % ) of EPS including Park@@ in@@ son@@ ism , Ak@@ ath@@ isie , D@@ yst@@ onia and Dy@@ sk@@ in@@ etry , compared to patients treated with Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol ( 57.@@ 3 % ) . &quot;
&quot; in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled long @-@ term study more than 26 weeks , the inci@@ dence of EPS was 19 % in patients with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole treatment and 13.@@ 1 % in patients with plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in another controlled long @-@ term study more than 26 weeks , the inci@@ dence of EPS was 14.@@ 8 % in patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and 15.@@ 1 % in patients with O@@ lan@@ z@@ ap@@ in therapy . &quot;
man@@ ic epis@@ odes in bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder - In a controlled trial of 12 weeks the inci@@ dence of EPS was 23.@@ 5 % in patients with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 5@@ 3.3 % in patients with hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol treatment .
&quot; in another study more than 12 weeks , the inci@@ dence of EPS was 26.@@ 6 % in patients with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole treatment and 17.@@ 6 % for those under lithium treatment . &quot;
&quot; in the long @-@ term retention phase over 26 weeks in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled trial , the inci@@ dence of EPS 18.@@ 2 % for patients with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 15.@@ 7 % for patients treated with plac@@ ebo was treated . &quot;
&quot; a comparison between the patient groups under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and plac@@ ebo , where potentially clin@@ ically significant changes in rout@@ in@@ ely controlled laboratory parameters occurred , did not reveal medi@@ cally significant differences . &quot;
&quot; increase of CP@@ K ( cre@@ atine ph@@ osp@@ ho@@ kin@@ ase ) , generally temporary and asy@@ mpt@@ om@@ atic , were observed in 3.5 % of patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , compared to 2.0 % of patients treated with plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; side effects that may occur in connection with an anti@@ psych@@ otic therapy , and on its occurrence also reported in the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , include the mal@@ ign@@ ant neuro@@ le@@ p@@ tic syndrome , late dy@@ nas@@ tics and cr@@ amp attacks , undes@@ irable cer@@ eb@@ rov@@ ascular events and increased mort@@ ality in older demen@@ tia patients , hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials and since market launch , un@@ inten@@ tional or deliber@@ ate acute over@@ dos@@ ages with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole were observed alone in adult patients with estimated dos@@ es of up to 12@@ 60 mg and without death . &quot;
&quot; although there is no information about the efficacy of a hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis in the treatment of over@@ dose with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , however , it is unlikely that hem@@ ato@@ sis is beneficial in the treatment of over@@ dose since Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ zo@@ l has high plasma cutting . &quot;
it is assumed that the effectiveness of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ zo@@ l in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar disorder is medi@@ ated by the combination of a partial antagon@@ istic effect on dop@@ amine D@@ 2- and ser@@ ot@@ onin 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ a rec@@ ept@@ ors and an antagon@@ istic effect on ser@@ ot@@ onin 5@@ HT@@ 2a rec@@ ept@@ ors .
&quot; in vit@@ ro , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed a high aff@@ inity to dop@@ amine D@@ 2- and D3 recep@@ tor and ser@@ ot@@ onin 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ a- and 5@@ HT@@ 2a recep@@ tor as well as an even aff@@ inity to dop@@ amine D@@ 4- , ser@@ ot@@ onin 5@@ HT@@ 2@@ c@@ - and 5@@ HT@@ 7@@ - , alpha @-@ 1 @-@ ad@@ ren@@ ergi@@ c and hist@@ amine H@@ 1@@ recep@@ tor . &quot;
&quot; a dose @-@ dependent reduction of 11@@ c @-@ Rac@@ lo@@ pri@@ d , a D2 / D3 recep@@ tor lig@@ ands , a D2 / D3 recep@@ tor lig@@ ands , the nucle@@ us cau@@ dat@@ us and the Put@@ nam . &quot;
&quot; in three plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled short @-@ term studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) in 1,@@ 228 schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ic patients with positive or negative symptoms , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ zo@@ l showed a statisti@@ cally significant improvement in psych@@ otic symptoms compared to plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in a Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol @-@ controlled trial , 52 was the share of respon@@ der patients who adher@@ ed to the study medication in both groups ( Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole 77 % and Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol 73 % ) . &quot;
&quot; current values from measurement scales defined as secondary programs , including PAN@@ SS and Mont@@ gom@@ ery As@@ berg@@ - Dep@@ res@@ sions@@ wert scale , showed a significantly stronger improvement than Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol . &quot;
&quot; in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study more than 26 weeks in stabili@@ zed patients with chronic schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed a significantly higher reduction in the rate of decline , which was 34 % in the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole group and 57 % in plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in an O@@ lan@@ z@@ ap@@ in @-@ controlled , multin@@ ational double @-@ blind study at schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia over 26 weeks , the 314 patients included and in which the primary study target &apos; weight gain &apos; was , a weight gain of at least 7 % ( N = 18 or 13 % of the evalu@@ able patient records ) occurred in significantly less patients ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.6 kg ) with an average weight of ca . &quot;
&quot; in two plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy studies with flexible dosage over 3 weeks involving patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed superior efficacy in reducing man@@ ic symptoms over 3 weeks . &quot;
&quot; in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy study , over 3 weeks with a fixed dose of patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed no superior effectiveness compared to plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in two plac@@ ebo and active @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy studies over 12 weeks in patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , with or without psych@@ otic mer@@ cury , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed superior efficacy in week 3 and a conservation effect similar to that of lithium or hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol in week 12 . &quot;
&quot; in week , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole also showed a comparable proportion of patients with sy@@ mpt@@ om@@ atic re@@ mission of the Man@@ ia , such as lithium or hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol . &quot;
&quot; in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled trial of 6 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , with or without psych@@ otic characteristics which sometimes did not respond to lithium or val@@ pro@@ at mon@@ otherapy in therapeutic ser@@ um mirrors , the companion therapy with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole resulted in superior efficacy in reducing man@@ ic symptoms compared to mon@@ otherapy with lithium or val@@ pro@@ at . &quot;
&quot; 10 In a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled trial , over 26 weeks followed by a long @-@ term expansion phase over 74 weeks in man@@ ic patients receiving a re@@ mission with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole during a stabili@@ zation phase prior to random@@ ization , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole presented themselves with regard to the prevention of a bi@@ polar reco@@ il , mainly in the prevention of a return to the Man@@ ia . &quot;
&quot; based on in vit@@ ro studies , the enzymes C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 and C@@ YP@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 are responsible for de@@ hydr@@ ation and hydro@@ xy@@ lat@@ ation of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l , the N @-@ De@@ al@@ ky@@ ulation is cataly@@ zed by C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 . &quot;
the mean elim@@ ination period is approximately 75 hours for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole with extensive metabol@@ ites via C@@ YP@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and approximately 146 hours in &apos; bad &apos; ( = &quot; poor &quot; ) metabol@@ ites via C@@ YP@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 .
&quot; in Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , there are no differences in pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics between male and female healthy volunteers , as did a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic examination of schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ic patients with no gender @-@ based effects . &quot;
a Pop@@ ulation @-@ specific evaluation of the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics showed no indication of clin@@ ically significant differences with regard to ethnic origin or the impact of smoking on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and Deh@@ ydr@@ o @-@ Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole were similar in patients with severe kidney failure in comparison to young healthy volunteers .
&quot; a single dose study in subjects with different liver cir@@ rho@@ sis ( Child @-@ Pu@@ gh class A , B and C ) showed no significant effect on the liver function on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and Deh@@ ydr@@ o @-@ Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , but the study included only 3 patients with cir@@ rho@@ sis of the class C , which is not sufficient to draw conclusions on their met@@ abolic capacity . &quot;
&quot; based on conventional studies on safety har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated gift , re@@ productive toxic@@ ity , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity , and cin@@ ogen@@ ic potential , prec@@ lin@@ ical data could not detect any particular haz@@ ards for humans . &quot;
&quot; toxic@@ ologically significant effects were only observed in dos@@ ages or ex@@ positions which exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure in humans , so they have only limited or no significance for clinical use . &quot;
the effects included a dose @-@ dependent drug toxic@@ ity ( li@@ po@@ fus@@ cin @-@ pigment accumulation and / or par@@ ench@@ y@@ mal cell loss ) in rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg / kg / day ( corresponds to 3- to 10 times the middle Ste@@ ady @-@ State Ex@@ position ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended maximum dose in humans ) .
&quot; in addition , a chol@@ eli@@ thi@@ asis was established as a result of the elim@@ ination of sul@@ fate con@@ ju@@ g@@ ates of the hydro@@ xy@@ - metabol@@ ites of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in the bil@@ e of monkeys after repeated oral application of 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( 1 to 3 times of the middle Ste@@ ady State Ex@@ position ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended clinical dose or the 16@@ - to 81@@ fold of the recommended maximum dose in humans based on mg / m2 ) . &quot;
&quot; however , the concentrations of the sulph@@ ate con@@ ju@@ gate of hydro@@ xy@@ - ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole found in the human bil@@ e at the highest recommended daily dose of hydro@@ xy@@ - ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ zo@@ l not more than 6 % of the concentrations which have been found in the study over 39 weeks in the g@@ all of monkeys , and lie far below the limit values ( 6 % ) of the in vit@@ ro sol@@ ub@@ ility . &quot;
&quot; in rab@@ bits , these effects were observed following dos@@ ages which led to ex@@ positions of the 3- and 11 @-@ fold of the middle Ste@@ ady @-@ State AU@@ C at the recommended clinical maximum dose . &quot;
&quot; perfor@@ ated bli@@ ster packs for delivery of single dos@@ es made of aluminium with 14 x 1 , 28 x 1 , 49 x 1 , 56 x 1 , 98 x 1 tablets . &quot;
&quot; 15 Sp@@ ät@@ dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical trials , which lasted one year or less , there were occasional reports of dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia arising during the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole . &quot;
it is assumed that the effectiveness of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ zo@@ l in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar disorder is medi@@ ated by the combination of a partial antagon@@ istic effect on dop@@ amine D@@ 2- and ser@@ ot@@ onin 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ a rec@@ ept@@ ors and an antagon@@ istic effect on ser@@ ot@@ onin 5@@ HT@@ 2a rec@@ ept@@ ors .
&quot; 22 In a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled trial , over 26 weeks followed by a long @-@ term expansion phase over 74 weeks for man@@ ic patients who had achieved a re@@ mission with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole during a stabili@@ zation phase prior to random@@ ization , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole presented themselves with regard to the prevention of a bi@@ polar reco@@ il , mainly in the prevention of a return to the Man@@ ia . &quot;
&quot; 27 Sp@@ ät@@ dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical trials , which lasted one year or less , there were occasional reports of dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia arising during the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole . &quot;
it is assumed that the effectiveness of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ zo@@ l in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar disorder is medi@@ ated by the combination of a partial antagon@@ istic effect on dop@@ amine D@@ 2- and ser@@ ot@@ onin 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ a rec@@ ept@@ ors and an antagon@@ istic effect on ser@@ ot@@ onin 5@@ HT@@ 2a rec@@ ept@@ ors .
&quot; 34 In a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled trial , over 26 weeks followed by a long @-@ term expansion phase over 74 weeks for man@@ ic patients who had achieved a re@@ mission with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole during a stabili@@ zation phase prior to random@@ ization , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole presented themselves with regard to the prevention of a bi@@ polar reco@@ il , mainly in the prevention of a return to the Man@@ ia . &quot;
&quot; 39 Sp@@ ät@@ dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical trials , which lasted one year or less , there were occasional reports of dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia arising during the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole . &quot;
it is assumed that the effectiveness of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ zo@@ l in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar disorder is medi@@ ated by the combination of a partial antagon@@ istic effect on dop@@ amine D@@ 2- and ser@@ ot@@ onin 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ a rec@@ ept@@ ors and an antagon@@ istic effect on ser@@ ot@@ onin 5@@ HT@@ 2a rec@@ ept@@ ors .
&quot; 46 In a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled trial , over 26 weeks followed by a long @-@ term expansion phase over 74 weeks for man@@ ic patients who had achieved a re@@ mission with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole during a stabili@@ zation phase prior to random@@ ization , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole presented themselves with regard to the prevention of a bi@@ polar reco@@ il , mainly in the prevention of a return to the Man@@ ia . &quot;
the recommended starting dose for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole is 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day once daily regardless of meals .

&quot; the occurrence of su@@ ici@@ dal behaviour belongs to psych@@ otic diseases and aff@@ ective disorders was reported in some cases after the beginning or after the change of an anti@@ psych@@ otic therapy , also in treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( see Section 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical trials , which lasted one year or less , there were occasional reports on dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia arising during the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole . &quot;
&quot; clinical manifest@@ ations of a M@@ NS are high fever , muscle rigi@@ dity , changing levels of consciousness and signs of autonomous inst@@ ability ( irregular pulse or blood pressure , t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia , swe@@ ating and arr@@ hyth@@ mia ) . &quot;
&quot; weight gain is generally observed in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ic patients and in patients with bi@@ polar man@@ ia due to com@@ or@@ bi@@ di@@ ties , the use of anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , in which weight gain is known as a side effect and may lead to serious complications . &quot;
patients should be advised to notify their doctor if they are pregnant or pregnancy during treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole
the following adverse events occurred more often ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than plac@@ ebo or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects of the drug ( * ) :
&quot; in two plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy studies with flexible dosage over 3 weeks involving patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed superior efficacy in reducing man@@ ic symptoms over 3 weeks . &quot;

&quot; the recommended starting dose for ABI@@ LI@@ F@@ Y is 15 mg once a day , regardless of meals as mon@@ otherapy or combination therapy ( see Section 5.1 ) . &quot;
&quot; for the prevention of recur@@ rent man@@ ic epis@@ odes in patients receiving Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ zo@@ l , therapy should be continued with the same dose . &quot;
&quot; late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical trials , which lasted one year or less , there were occasional reports on dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia arising during the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole . &quot;
&quot; hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia , in some cases extremely and associated with k@@ eto@@ aci@@ dosis or hyper@@ os@@ mol@@ ar coma or death , was reported in patients treated with at@@ yp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic agents , including ABI@@ LI@@ F@@ Y . &quot;
there are no precise risk ass@@ ess@@ ments for hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia @-@ related adverse events in patients treated with ABI@@ LI@@ F@@ Y and other at@@ yp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic agents that allow direct compar@@ isons .
&quot; 92 In a clinical study involving healthy subjects , a highly effective C@@ YP@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ or ( Ch@@ ini@@ din ) increased the AU@@ C of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole by 107 % while the C@@ max remained unchanged . &quot;
dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em or esc@@ ital@@ op@@ ram or C@@ YP@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 together with A@@ bili@@ fy can be calculated with a moderate increase in ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole concentrations .
man@@ ic epis@@ odes in bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder - In a controlled study more than 12 weeks the inci@@ dence of EPS was 23.@@ 5 % in patients with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ -
it is assumed that the effectiveness of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ zo@@ l in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar disorder is medi@@ ated by the combination of a partial antagon@@ istic effect on dop@@ amine D@@ 2- and ser@@ ot@@ onin 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ a rec@@ ept@@ ors and an antagon@@ istic effect on ser@@ ot@@ onin 5@@ HT@@ 2a rec@@ ept@@ ors .
&quot; in an O@@ lan@@ z@@ ap@@ in @-@ controlled , multin@@ ational double @-@ blind study at schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia over 26 weeks , the 314 patients included and in which the primary study target &apos; weight gain &apos; was , a weight gain of at least 7 % ( N = 18 or 13 % of the evalu@@ able patient records ) occurred in significantly less patients ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.6 kg ) with an average weight of ca . &quot;
97 In a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy study lasting 3 weeks with a fixed dose of patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed no superior effectiveness compared to plac@@ ebo .
&quot; in a relative bio@@ availability study , in which the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of 30 mg Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole were compared with 30 mg Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in tablet form for healthy subjects , the ratio between the geometric C@@ max mean value of the solution and the value of the tablets stood at 122 % ( N = 30 ) . &quot;
&quot; 99 In addition , a chol@@ eli@@ thi@@ asis was established as a result of the elim@@ ination of Sul@@ fate con@@ ju@@ g@@ ates of the hydro@@ xy@@ - metabol@@ ites of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in the bil@@ e of monkeys after repeated oral application of 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( the recommended clinical dose or the 16 - to 3 times the recommended maximum dose in humans based on mg / m2 ) . &quot;
&quot; in rab@@ bits , these effects were observed following dos@@ ages which led to ex@@ positions of the 3- and 11 @-@ fold of the middle Ste@@ ady @-@ State AU@@ C at the recommended clinical maximum dose . &quot;
ABI@@ LI@@ F@@ Y Inj@@ ection Solution is used for rapid control of Agi@@ ti@@ ght@@ ness and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders in patients with schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia or in patients with man@@ ic epis@@ odes of bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder if oral therapy is not appropriate .
&quot; as soon as it is clin@@ ically appropriate , the treatment should be termin@@ ated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ zo@@ l injection solution and started with oral application of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole . &quot;
&quot; in order to increase res@@ or@@ ption and minimize the vari@@ ability , an injection into the M. del@@ to@@ ide@@ us or deep into the glut@@ eus maxim@@ us muscle is recommended under stra@@ pping adi@@ pose regions . &quot;
a lower dose of 5.@@ 25 mg ( 0.7 ml ) can be given depending on the individual clinical status taking into account the medicines used already for conservation or ac@@ ut therapy ( see Section 4.5 ) .
&quot; if a further oral treatment is indicated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ zo@@ l , see the summary of the features of the medicine to ABI@@ LI@@ fy tablets , ABI@@ LI@@ F@@ Y melting tablets or ABI@@ LI@@ F@@ Y solution . &quot;
there are no investigations on the efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole inj@@ ections in patients with Agi@@ ti@@ ght@@ ness and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders that were otherwise caused by schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and man@@ ic epis@@ odes of bi@@ polar disorder .
&quot; if a par@@ enter@@ al therapy with ben@@ zo@@ di@@ az@@ ep@@ ines is considered necessary in addition to the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ zo@@ l injection solution , patients should be observed with regard to extreme sed@@ ation or blood pressure drop ( see Section 4.5 ) . &quot;
studies on the safety and efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole inj@@ ections are not available for patients with alcohol or drug toxic@@ ation ( due to prescribed or illegal drugs ) .
&quot; Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole should be used with caution in patients with well @-@ known cardiovascular diseases ( m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction or isch@@ em@@ ic heart disease , heart failure , hyp@@ ot@@ onia , treatment with blood pressure lowering drugs ) or hyper@@ tension ( including acute and mal@@ ign@@ ant form ) . &quot;
&quot; late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical trials , which lasted one year or less , there were occasional reports on dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia arising during the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole . &quot;
&quot; clinical manifest@@ ations of a M@@ NS are high fever , muscle sti@@ ff@@ ness , changing levels of consciousness and signs of autonomous inst@@ ability ( irregular pulse or blood pressure , t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia , swe@@ ating and arr@@ hyth@@ mi@@ as ) . &quot;
&quot; poly@@ di@@ p@@ sie , poly@@ ur@@ ie , poly@@ ph@@ ag@@ ia and weakness ) are observed and patients with diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or with risk factors for diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus should regularly be monitored in terms of a wor@@ sen@@ ing of glucose levels . &quot;
&quot; weight gain is generally observed in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ic patients and patients with bi@@ polar man@@ ia due to com@@ or@@ bi@@ di@@ ties , the use of anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , in which weight gain is known as a side effect and may lead to serious complications . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , the intensity of sed@@ ation was greater compared to that after the sole gift of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , in a study where healthy volunteers Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( 15 mg dosage ) were used as a dispos@@ able in@@ tram@@ us@@ kul@@ ardi@@ al and which at the same time received Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( 2 mg dose ) in@@ tram@@ us@@ cul@@ arly . &quot;
&quot; the H2 @-@ antagon@@ ist Fam@@ oti@@ din , a ga@@ stri@@ c acid blo@@ cker , reduces the absorption rate of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l , although this effect is considered clin@@ ically not relevant . &quot;
C@@ YP@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 &apos; bad &apos; ( = &apos; poor &apos; ) metabol@@ ites can result in a joint application with highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ YP@@ 2@@ A4 in higher plasma concentrations in Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
&quot; other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 , such as i@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole and HI@@ V@@ - Prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , may have similar effects , so similar dose reduc@@ tions should be made . &quot;
&quot; after placing the C@@ YP@@ 2@@ D@@ 6- or 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors , the dosage of A@@ bili@@ fy should be raised to the dosage level prior to the beginning of the accompanying therapy . &quot;
&quot; with 106 Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( 2 mg dose ) in@@ tram@@ us@@ cul@@ arly , the intensity of sed@@ ation was greater compared to that after the sole gift of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole . &quot;
the following side effects were more common in clinical trials with the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l injection solution ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than plac@@ ebo or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects ( see Section 5.1 ) :
&quot; the frequency of side effects listed below is defined according to the following criteria : frequent ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1.000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) . &quot;
107 The following side effects were more common ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than plac@@ ebo or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects ( * ) in clinical trials ( see Section 5.1 ) :
&quot; in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled long @-@ term study more than 26 weeks , the inci@@ dence of EPS was 19 % in patients suffering from Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 13.@@ 1 % in patients with plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in another study more than 12 weeks , the inci@@ dence of EPS was 26.@@ 6 % in patients with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 17.@@ 6 % for those under lithium treatment . &quot;
&quot; in the long @-@ term retention phase over 26 weeks in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled trial , the inci@@ dence of EPS 18.@@ 2 % for patients with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole treatment and 15.@@ 7 % for patients treated with plac@@ ebo was treated . &quot;
&quot; a comparison between the patient groups under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and plac@@ ebo , where potentially clin@@ ically significant changes in rout@@ in@@ ely controlled laboratory parameters occurred , did not reveal medi@@ cally significant differences . &quot;
&quot; the increase of CP@@ K ( cre@@ atin@@ ph@@ osp@@ ho@@ kin@@ ase ) , generally temporary and asy@@ mpt@@ om@@ atic , were observed in 3.5 % of patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , compared to 2.0 % of patients treated with plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; side effects that may occur in connection with an anti@@ psych@@ otic therapy , and on its occurrence also reported in the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , include the mal@@ ign@@ ant neuro@@ le@@ p@@ tic syndrome , late dy@@ nas@@ tics and cr@@ amp attacks , undes@@ irable cer@@ eb@@ rov@@ ascular events and increased mort@@ ality in older demen@@ tia patients , hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
110 and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders were the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ zo@@ l injection solution associated with statisti@@ cally significantly greater improvements of Agi@@ ti@@ ght@@ ness / behavi@@ our@@ al disorders compared to plac@@ ebo and was similar to Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol .
&quot; in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled short @-@ time study ( 24 h ) with 291 patients with bi@@ polar disorder , as well as Agi@@ ti@@ ght@@ ness and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders , the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ zo@@ l injection solution was associated with a statisti@@ cally significant improvement in the symptoms of the Agi@@ ti@@ ght@@ ness and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders in comparison to plac@@ ebo and similar to the Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am@@ - reference arm . &quot;
&quot; the mean improvement of the initial value at the PAN@@ SS Ex@@ cit@@ ement Compon@@ ent score with the primary 2 @-@ hour end point was 5,@@ 8 for plac@@ ebo , 9,@@ 6 for Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am and 8,@@ 7 for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole . &quot;
&quot; in analyses of sub@@ groups in patients with mixed epis@@ odes or patients with severe Agi@@ ti@@ ght@@ ness , a similar effectiveness has been observed in relation to the overall population , but a statistical significance could be determined due to reduced number of patients . &quot;
&quot; in three plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled short @-@ term studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) in 1,@@ 228 schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ic patients with positive or negative symptoms , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ zo@@ l ( oral ) showed a statisti@@ cally significant improvement in psych@@ otic symptoms compared to plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in a half @-@ op@@ eri@@ dol @-@ controlled trial , 52 was the share of respon@@ der patients with a response to the study medication in both groups ( Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole 77 % ( oral ) and hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol 73 % . &quot;
&quot; values from measurement scales defined as secondary programs , including PAN@@ SS and Mont@@ gom@@ ery As@@ berg de@@ pres@@ sion@@ al scale , showed a significantly stronger improvement than Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol . &quot;
&quot; in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled trial over 26 weeks of stabili@@ zed patients with chronic schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( oral ) showed a significantly higher reduction in the rate of return , which was 34 % in the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - ( oral ) group and 57 % lower than plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in an O@@ lan@@ z@@ ap@@ in @-@ controlled , multin@@ ational double @-@ blind study at schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia over 26 weeks , the 314 patients included and in which the primary study target &apos; weight gain &apos; was , a weight gain of at least 7 % ( N = 18 or 13 % of the evalu@@ able patient records ) occurred in significantly less patients ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.6 kg ) with an average weight of ca . &quot;
&quot; 111 In a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled trial of 6 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar disorder , with or without psych@@ otic characteristics that were sometimes not on lithium or val@@ pro@@ at mon@@ otherapy in therapeutic ser@@ um mirrors , the companion therapy with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole resulted in superior efficacy in reducing man@@ ic symptoms compared to mon@@ otherapy with lithium or val@@ pro@@ at . &quot;
&quot; in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled trial lasting 26 weeks followed by a 74 @-@ week extension of man@@ ic patients who had achieved a re@@ mission with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole during a stabili@@ zation phase before random@@ ization , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole presented themselves with regard to the prevention of a bi@@ polar reco@@ il , mainly in the prevention of a return to the Man@@ ia . &quot;
the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l AU@@ C is in the first 2 hours after in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular injection 90 % greater the AU@@ C after offering the same dose as a tablet ; the system@@ ic exposure was similar between the two form@@ ulations .
&quot; in 2 studies with healthy subjects , mean time to reach the maximum plasma level at 1 to 3 hours after application . &quot;
&quot; the administration of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole inj@@ ections was well toler@@ ated by rats and monkeys , and results in no direct toxic@@ ity of a target organ after repeated gift at a system@@ ic exposure ( AU@@ C ) , which were 15 and 5 times above the maximum human therapeutic exposure of 30 m@@ g. in@@ tram@@ us@@ cul@@ arly . &quot;
&quot; in studies on re@@ productive toxic@@ ity following intra@@ ven@@ ous application , no safety @-@ related concerns were taken after mat@@ ernal exposure , which was 15 ( rats ) and 29 @-@ times ( rab@@ bits ) on the maximum human therapeutic exposure of 30 mg . &quot;
&quot; based on conventional studies with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( oral ) for safety har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated gift , re@@ productive toxic@@ ity , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity , and cin@@ ogen@@ ic potential , prec@@ lin@@ ical data could not recognize any particular haz@@ ards for humans . &quot;
&quot; toxic@@ ologically significant effects were only observed in dos@@ ages or ex@@ positions which exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure in humans , so they have only limited or no significance for clinical use . &quot;
the effects included a dose @-@ dependent side @-@ level toxic@@ ity ( li@@ po@@ fus@@ cin @-@ pigment accumulation and / or par@@ ench@@ y@@ mal cell loss ) in rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg / kg / day ( corresponds to 3- to 10 @-@ times of the moderate steady @-@ state exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended maximum dose of the steady @-@ state exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended maximum dose in humans ) .
&quot; in addition , a chol@@ eli@@ thi@@ asis was established as a result of the elim@@ ination of sul@@ fate con@@ ju@@ g@@ ates of the hydro@@ xy@@ - metabol@@ ites of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in the bil@@ e of monkeys after repeated oral application of 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( the recommended maximum dose of 1 to 3 times of the recommended maximum dose in humans based on mg / m2 ) . &quot;
&quot; in rab@@ bits , these effects were observed after dos@@ ages which led to expos@@ ures of the 3 and 11 @-@ fold of the middle steady @-@ state AU@@ C at the recommended clinical maximum dose . &quot;

&quot; the effectiveness of Abra@@ x@@ ane was studied in a main study where 460 women participated with metast@@ atic breast cancer , of which about three quarters previously had an anth@@ rac@@ y@@ cl@@ in . &quot;
the effect of Abra@@ x@@ ane ( in sole gift or mon@@ otherapy ) was compared with the drug containing a conventional pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el ( given in combination with other medicines to reduce side effects ) .
&quot; in total , 72 ( 31 % ) of the 229 patients treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane treated patients to the treatment , compared to 37 ( 16 % ) of 225 patients receiving conventional pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el . &quot;
&quot; considering only the patients who were treated for the first time for metast@@ atic breast cancer , there was no difference between the medicines and the wor@@ sen@@ ing of the disease and survival . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , patients who had previously received other treatments for their metast@@ atic breast cancer showed that Abra@@ x@@ ane was more effective than conventional pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el medicines . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it may not be used in patients who are breast@@ feeding or at the beginning of the treatment of low neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ al numbers in the blood . &quot;
&quot; the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) noted that Abra@@ x@@ ane was medicines in patients , in which the first treatment was no more effective than conventional pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el medicines and that unlike other pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el medicines , drugs must not be given to other medicines to reduce side effects . &quot;
&quot; January 2008 , the European Commission granted the company AB@@ RA@@ X@@ IS Bio@@ Science Limited to appro@@ ve Abra@@ x@@ ane in the entire European Union . &quot;
&quot; Abra@@ x@@ ane @-@ mon@@ otherapy is indicated for the treatment of metast@@ atic breast cancer in patients with the first @-@ line therapy for metast@@ atic disease , and for which a standard anth@@ rac@@ y@@ cl@@ in therapy is not indicated ( see also section 4.4 ) . &quot;
in patients with severe neut@@ rop@@ enia ( Neut@@ ro@@ sy count &lt; 0.@@ 50 x 109 / l over a period of one week or longer ) or severe sensory neu@@ rop@@ athy during the Abra@@ x@@ ane therapy the dose should be reduced to 220 mg / m2 in subsequent series .
&quot; in the case of sensory neu@@ rop@@ athy grade 3 , the treatment is to be interrupted until an improvement is reached at grade 1 or 2 , and the dose must be reduced in all subsequent cycles . &quot;
there is currently no sufficient data for the recommendation of dose adjustments in patients with mild to moderate im@@ pair@@ ment of liver function ( see Section 4.@@ 4. and 5.2 ) .
no studies were conducted with patients with imp@@ aired kidney function and there is currently no sufficient data to recommendation dose adjustments in patients with imp@@ aired kidney function ( see Section 5.2 ) .
abra@@ x@@ ane is not recommended for use in children under 18 years due to insufficient data for harm@@ lessness and efficacy .
&quot; Abra@@ x@@ ane is an alb@@ um@@ in @-@ bound nan@@ op@@ article form@@ ulation of pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el , which could have significantly different pharmac@@ ological characteristics than other form@@ ulations of pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el ( see Section 5.1 and 5.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; if an allergic reaction occurs , the drug should be removed immediately and a sy@@ mpt@@ om@@ atic treatment should be initiated , and the patient must not again be treated with pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el . &quot;
&quot; in patients no new abra@@ x@@ ane treatment cycles should be initiated , until the number of neutr@@ ons has risen again to &gt; 1.5 x 109 / l and the th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ te number has risen again to &gt; 100 x 109 / l . &quot;
patients with severe liver function disorders ( bili@@ ru@@ bin &gt; 5 x UL@@ N or AS@@ L / AL@@ T &gt; 10 x UL@@ N ) should not be treated with abra@@ x@@ ane .
&quot; while the cardi@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity was clearly detected by Abra@@ x@@ ane , cardi@@ ac occur@@ ren@@ ces in the indicated patient group are not unusual , especially in patients with previous anth@@ rac@@ y@@ c@@ line treatment or underlying heart or lung disease . &quot;
&quot; if patients suffer from nau@@ sea , vom@@ iting and di@@ arr@@ ho@@ ea after the application of Abra@@ x@@ ane nau@@ sea , vom@@ iting and di@@ arr@@ ho@@ ea , they can be treated with the usual anti @-@ methods and con@@ sti@@ p@@ ational methods . &quot;
&quot; abra@@ x@@ ane should not be used in pregnant women or women in chil@@ d@@ bearing age , which are not effective contra@@ ception , except for the treatment of the mother with pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is inevitable . &quot;
women in chil@@ d@@ bearing age should use a reliable method of contra@@ ception during and up to 1 month after the treatment with Abra@@ x@@ ane .
&quot; male patients , treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane , is advised to generate no child during and up to six months after treatment . &quot;
&quot; before the treatment with Abra@@ x@@ ane , male patients should consult with the possibility of irre@@ ver@@ sible in@@ fertility due to the treatment with Abra@@ x@@ ane . &quot;
Abra@@ x@@ ane may cause side effects such as fatigue ( very common ) and di@@ zz@@ iness ( common ) that can affect the per@@ v@@ acity and ability to serve machines .
&quot; the following are the most common and important inci@@ dents of side @-@ effects reported in 229 patients with metast@@ atic breast cancer , which were treated once every three weeks with 260 mg / m2 abra@@ x@@ anes at the pi@@ vot@@ al Phase III trial . &quot;
neut@@ rop@@ enia was the most con@@ sp@@ ic@@ uous important hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity ( reported in 79 % of patients ) and was quickly rever@@ sible and dose @-@ dependent ; leu@@ kop@@ enia was reported to 71 % of patients .
ana@@ emia ( H@@ b &lt; 10 g / dl ) was observed in 46 % of patients treated with abra@@ x@@ ane and was severe in three cases ( H@@ b &lt; 8 g / dl ) .
listed in Table 1 are the side effects that have occurred in combination with the gift of Abra@@ x@@ ane as mon@@ otherapy at each dose and indication in studies ( N = 7@@ 89 ) .
&quot; frequent ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1.000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) ; rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) ; very rare ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) . &quot;

pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is an anti @-@ mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ i substance that promotes the accumulation of mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules from the tube @-@ indicators and stabil@@ ises mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules by inhibit@@ ing their de@@ col@@ oni@@ fication .
&quot; this stabili@@ zation leads to an in@@ hibition of the normal dynamic re@@ organization of the mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ular network , which is essential for the vital intervention and the mit@@ otic cell functions . &quot;
it is known that alb@@ um@@ in transm@@ its the trans@@ cy@@ to@@ sis of plasma components into the end@@ othel@@ ial cells and in the context of in vit@@ ro studies it has been proven that the presence of alb@@ um@@ in promotes the transport of pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el through the end@@ othel@@ ial cells .
&quot; it is assumed that this improved tran@@ sen@@ dop@@ hel@@ i@@ ale transport is medi@@ ated by the g@@ p @-@ 60 @-@ Alb@@ umin@@ re@@ zep@@ tor and due to the f@@ ond protein aci@@ dic rich in c@@ yst@@ eine ) , pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el accumulation occurs in the tumor zone . &quot;
&quot; the application of Abra@@ x@@ ane for metast@@ atic breast cancer is supported by data from 106 patients in two mon@@ ochro@@ me , un@@ bl@@ inded studies and 454 patients treated in a random@@ ised Phase III trial study . &quot;
&quot; in a study , 43 patients with metast@@ atic breast cancer were treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane , which was given in the form of in@@ fusion for 30 minutes with a dose of 175 mg / m2 . &quot;
in the second study a dose of 300 mg / m2 was used as in@@ fusion for 30 minutes in 63 patients with metast@@ atic breast cancer .
&quot; this multi@@ cent@@ ric study was performed in patients with metast@@ atic breast cancer , which received a mon@@ otherapy with pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el every 3 weeks , either in the form of solvent containing pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el 175 mg / m2 as a 3 @-@ hour in@@ fusion with pre@@ medi@@ ation to prevent an allergic reaction ( N = 225 ) or in the form of Abra@@ x@@ ane 260 mg / m2 as a 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion ( N = 229 ) . &quot;
&quot; in the study , 64 % of patients had an imp@@ aired overall condition ( ECO@@ G 1 or 2 ) , 79 % had vis@@ cer@@ al metast@@ ases and 76 % had more than 3 metast@@ ases . &quot;
&quot; 14 % of patients had previously received chemotherapy , 27 % only had one adju@@ v@@ ant chemotherapy , 40 % only because of metast@@ asing and 19 % for metast@@ asing and adju@@ v@@ ant treatment . &quot;
&quot; 9 Results for general response rate and time to progression @-@ free survival and progression @-@ free survival and survival for patients receiving first @-@ line therapy , are shown below . &quot;
neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity compared to pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el was evaluated by improving one degree for patients who experienced a periph@@ eral neu@@ rop@@ athy level 3 at a time during the therapy .
the natural course of periph@@ eral neu@@ rop@@ athy as a result of the cum@@ ulative toxic@@ ity of Abra@@ x@@ ane after &gt; 6 treatment courses has not been evaluated and is still unknown .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of the overall pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el after 30@@ - and 180 @-@ minute in@@ fusion of Abra@@ x@@ ane with a dose of 80 to 375 mg / m2 was determined in clinical trials .
the active substance ex@@ position ( AU@@ C ) increased from 26@@ 53 to 167@@ 36 n@@ g.@@ h / ml analog@@ ous to a dose of 80 to 300 mg / m2 .
10 After intra@@ ven@@ ous administration of Abra@@ x@@ ane in patients with metast@@ atic breast cancer at the recommended clinical dose of 260 mg / m2 the pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el plasma concentration decreased in a multi@@ phase way .
the mean distribution volume was 6@@ 32 l / m2 ; the high distribution volume points to a far @-@ reaching extra@@ v@@ ascular division and / or turn@@ out of pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
&quot; in a study involving patients with advanced solid tum@@ ours , the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el were compared to intra@@ ven@@ ous 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion of 260 mg / m2 abra@@ x@@ ane with the values after a 3 @-@ hour injection of 175 mg / m2 of solvent @-@ containing pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el . &quot;
&quot; the clearance of pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el was higher after the Abra@@ x@@ ane @-@ Gabe ( 43 % ) than after a solvent containing pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el injection , and also the distribution volume was higher at Abra@@ x@@ ane ( 53 % ) . &quot;
&quot; in published literature about in vit@@ ro studies of human liver micro@@ some and tissue layers , pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is primarily met@@ ab@@ oli@@ zed to 6@@ α -@@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el and two smaller metabol@@ ites ( 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el and 6@@ α -3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ D@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el ) . &quot;
&quot; after a 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion of 260 mg / m2 abra@@ x@@ anes in patients with metast@@ atic breast cancer , the average value for cum@@ ulative ur@@ inary ex@@ cre@@ tion of the unchanged active substance was 4 % of the given total dose with less than 1 % of the metabol@@ ites 6@@ α -@@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el and 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el , indicating a far @-@ reaching non @-@ ren@@ al clearance . &quot;
&quot; however , only a few data are available about patients at the age of 75 , since only 3 patients of this age group participated in the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic analysis . &quot;
the chemical and physical stability was detected at 2 ° C - 8 ° C in original box and above light light protected over 8 hours .

this means that Ab@@ se@@ amed is similar to a biological drug that is already approved in the European Union ( EU ) and contains the same ingredient ( also called &quot; reference drug &quot; ) .
&quot; it is used in patients with normal blood iron values , in which blood trans@@ fusion complications may occur if there is no blood circulation in the blood and a blood loss from 900 to 1 800 ml is expected . &quot;
treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed must be initiated under the supervision of a physician who has experience in treating patients with diseases for which the medicine is indicated .
&quot; in patients with kidney problems , and in patients who want to make a blood donation , Ab@@ se@@ amed is inj@@ ected into a v@@ ein . &quot;
&quot; the injection can also be done by the patient or his super@@ visor , provided that they have received appropriate guidance . &quot;
&quot; in patients with chronic kidney failure , respectively in patients receiving chemotherapy , the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ binary values should always lie in the recommended range ( between 10 and 12 grams per dec@@ il@@ iter for adults respectively between 9.5 and 11 g / dl in children ) . &quot;
&quot; the iron values of all patients are to be checked before the treatment to ensure that there is no iron deficiency , and iron supplements should be ad@@ ministered during the entire treatment . &quot;
&quot; in patients receiving chemotherapy , or in patients with kidney problems , an@@ emia can be caused by a ery@@ thro@@ po@@ i@@ etal deficiency or that the body does not adequ@@ ately respond to the body &apos;s ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin . &quot;
ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin is also used before surgery to increase the number of red blood cells and thus reduce the consequences of blood loss .
&quot; it is produced by a cell into which a gene ( DNA ) was introduced , capable of producing ep@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa . &quot;
&quot; Ab@@ se@@ amed was used as an injection into a v@@ ein as part of a main study involving 479 patients , who suffered from kidney problems caused ana@@ emia , compared with the reference drug . &quot;
at least eight weeks E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o had been inj@@ ected into a v@@ ein before they were either converted to Ab@@ se@@ amed or continued to receive E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
the main indicator of efficacy was the change in hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in values between the beginning of the study and the assessment period in the weeks 25 to 29 .
the company also presented the results of a study in which the effects of ab@@ se@@ amed with those of E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o were examined with those of E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o in 114 cancer patients receiving chemotherapy .
&quot; in the study involving patients caused by kidney problems caused ana@@ emia , the ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in values of patients treated on Ab@@ se@@ amed were retained in the same measure as in those patients who continued to receive E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o . &quot;
&quot; in comparison , the patients who continued to receive E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o showed an increase of 0.0@@ 63 g / dl of the initial value of 12.@@ 0 g / dl . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effect of Ab@@ se@@ amed is an increase in blood pressure , which can occasionally lead to symptoms of encephal@@ opathy ( brain problems ) such as sudden , sm@@ elling mig@@ raine head@@ aches and confusion . &quot;
Ab@@ se@@ amed may not be used in patients who may possibly be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to ep@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa or any of the other ingredients .
&quot; se@@ amed as an injection under the skin is not recommended to treat kidney problems , since further studies are needed to ensure that this does not trigger allergic reactions . &quot;
&quot; the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that for Ab@@ und@@ amed , according to the provisions of the European Union , evidence was provided that the medicine has a comparable quality , safety and efficacy profile such as E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o . &quot;
&quot; the company that manufactures Ab@@ se@@ amed will provide information packages to the medical specialist in all Member States , including information on the safety of the medicine . &quot;
&quot; August 2007 , the European Commission granted the company Medi@@ ce Medic@@ inal Pharmaceu@@ ticals P@@ üt@@ ter GmbH &amp; Co KG granted approval for the marketing of Ab@@ se@@ amed in the entire European Union . &quot;
&quot; treatment of ana@@ emia and reduction of the trans@@ fusion requirement for adults with solid tum@@ ours , mal@@ ign@@ ant lymph@@ omas , or multi@@ ple@@ m my@@ el@@ om , which receive chemotherapy and where the risk of trans@@ fusion is due to the general condition ( e.g. cardiovascular status , pre @-@ existing ana@@ emia ) . &quot;
&quot; the treatment should only be performed in patients with moderate an@@ emia ( hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in &#91; H@@ b &#93; 10 - 13 g / dl &#91; 6.2 - 8.1 m@@ mo@@ l / l &#93; , in case blood @-@ saving measures are not available or insufficient , in planned larger operative interventions that require a large blood volume replacement ( 4 or more units of blood for women ; 5 or more units of blood in men ) . &quot;
&quot; for the reduction of external db@@ lu@@ t , Ab@@ se@@ amed can be used in front of a large electro @-@ orthop@@ edi@@ c intervention in adults with no iron deficiency , where a high risk of trans@@ fusion complications can be expected . &quot;
HB 10 @-@ 13 g / dl ) and an expected blood loss of 900 @-@ 1800 ml used not to participate in an aut@@ olog@@ ous blood donation program .
ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration is between 10 and 12 g / dl ( 6.2 - 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) except in pedi@@ atric patients with hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in concentration between 9.5 and 11 g / dl ( 5.@@ 9 - 6.8 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
&quot; symptoms and symptoms may vary depending on age , gender and total disease ; therefore , the assessment of the individual clinical course and condition of disease is required by the doctor . &quot;
an increase in ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in by more than 2 g / dl ( 1.25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) over a period of four weeks should be avoided .
&quot; because of the vari@@ ability between patients , individual hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in values can occasionally be observed in a patient or under the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration . &quot;
&quot; given this hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in vari@@ ability , a corresponding can management should be attempted to achieve the ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration of 10 g / dl ( 6.2 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) to 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) . &quot;
&quot; if the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value exceeds 2 g / dl ( 1.25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month or if the permanent hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value exceeds 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , the ep@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa dose is reduced by 25 % . &quot;
patients should be closely monitored to ensure that ep@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is used in the lowest permissible dose required for the control of ana@@ emia and ana@@ emia symptoms .
the present clinical results indicate that patients with initial low H@@ b value ( &lt; 6 g / dl or &lt; 3.@@ 75 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) may require higher maintenance dos@@ es than patients where initial ana@@ emia is less severe ( H@@ b &gt; 8 g / dl or &gt; 5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
&quot; the present clinical results indicate that patients with initially very low H@@ b value ( &lt; 6,@@ 8 g / dl or &lt; 4,@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) may require higher maintenance dos@@ es than patients in which initial ana@@ emia is less severe ( H@@ b &gt; 6.8 g / dl or &gt; 4.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) . &quot;
&quot; starting dose 50 I.@@ U. / kg three times a week using intra@@ ven@@ ous application , if necessary with a dose increase of 25 I.@@ U. / kg ( three times a week ) until the desired target value is reached ( this should take place in steps of at least 4 weeks ) . &quot;
&quot; ana@@ emia symptoms and sequ@@ enti@@ ae may vary depending on age , gender and total disease ; therefore , the assessment of the individual clinical course and condition of disease is required by the doctor . &quot;
&quot; given this hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in vari@@ ability , a corresponding can management should be attempted to achieve the ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration of 10 g / dl ( 6.2 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) to 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) . &quot;
patients should be closely monitored to ensure that ep@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is used in the lowest permissible dose required for controlling the ana@@ emia symptoms .
&quot; if after 4 treatment weeks the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value has risen by at least 1 g / dl ( 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) or the prec@@ ari@@ al number of ≥ 0,000 cells / µ@@ l compared to the initial value , the dose should be maintained three times a week or 450 I.@@ U. / kg once a week . &quot;
&quot; if the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in rise &lt; 1 g / dl ( &lt; 0,@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and the re@@ tic@@ u@@ loc@@ ytes of &lt; 4@@ 0,000 cells / µ@@ l compared to the initial value , the dose should be raised to 300 I.@@ U. / kg three times a week . &quot;
&quot; if after another 4 treatment weeks with 300 I.@@ U. / kg three times a week the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value has risen by ≥ 1 g / dl ( ≥ 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) or the re@@ tic@@ u@@ loc@@ ytes of ≥ 0,000 cells / µ@@ l , the dose should be maintained three times a week . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value increased by &lt; 1 g / dl ( &lt; 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) or the re@@ tic@@ u@@ loc@@ ytes of &lt; 4@@ 0,000 cells / µ@@ l compared to the initial value , a response to ep@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa therapy is unlikely and the treatment should be abor@@ ted . &quot;
&quot; patients with mild ana@@ emia ( hem@@ at@@ oc@@ rit 33 - 39 % ) , in which the precau@@ tion of ≥ 4 blood con@@ served is required , Ab@@ se@@ amed should receive a dose of 600 I.@@ U. / kg of body weight twice a week for 3 weeks prior to the surgical procedure . &quot;
&quot; the iron sub@@ stitution should start as early as possible - for example , a few weeks before the beginning of the aut@@ olog@@ ous blood donation program - that large iron reserves are available prior to the beginning of the se@@ amed therapy . &quot;
&quot; 6 The recommended dosage is 600 I.@@ U. / kg ep@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa , which should be given once a week over three weeks ( day 21 , 14 and 7 ) before the surgery and on the day of surgery ( day 0 ) . &quot;
&quot; ep@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa should be given pre@@ oper@@ atively 300 I.@@ U. / kg every 10 consecutive days , on the day of surgery and 4 days immediately afterwards . &quot;
&quot; alternatively , the injection at the end of di@@ aly@@ sis can be given over the hose of a fi@@ st@@ ula needle , followed by 10 ml is@@ ot@@ onic cooking solution to rin@@ se the hose and ensure sufficient injection of the medicine into circulation . &quot;
patients who are ill with any ery@@ thro@@ po@@ et@@ tin in ery@@ thro@@ bla@@ stom@@ a ( PR@@ CA ) should not receive Ab@@ und@@ amed or other ery@@ thro@@ po@@ et@@ tin ( see Section 4.4 - ery@@ thro@@ bla@@ stom@@ a ) .
&quot; heart attack or stroke within one month before the treatment , un@@ stable ang@@ ina pec@@ tor@@ is , increased risk of deep ven@@ ous thro@@ mb@@ oses ( e.g. an@@ am@@ nes@@ tically known ven@@ ous th@@ rom@@ bo@@ em@@ bo@@ lia ) . &quot;
&quot; for patients who are intended for a greater electro @-@ orthop@@ edi@@ c intervention and who cannot participate in an aut@@ olog@@ ous blood donation program , the application of ep@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is contra@@ indicated in the following pre@@ - , companion or underlying diseases ; severe cor@@ on@@ ary heart disease , v@@ ascular disease of the car@@ cin@@ oma or cer@@ eb@@ rov@@ ascular disease ; in patients with recently recur@@ ring heart attack or cer@@ eb@@ rov@@ ascular event . &quot;
ery@@ thro@@ bla@@ stom@@ a ( PR@@ CA ) Very rare was reported about the occurrence of an an@@ tic@@ ated PR@@ CA after years of treatment with sub@@ cut@@ aneous ery@@ thro@@ po@@ et@@ tin .
&quot; in patients with sudden loss of activity , defined as reduction of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in values ( 1 - 2 g / dl per month ) with increased need for trans@@ fu@@ sions , the re@@ tic@@ u@@ loc@@ y@@ cy@@ te value should be determined and the usual causes for non @-@ contact ( iron , fo@@ lic acid or vitamin B@@ 12 deficiency , al@@ umin@@ um@@ to@@ xi@@ k@@ ation , infections or inflamm@@ ations , blood loss and hem@@ oly@@ sis ) are examined . &quot;
&quot; if the Re@@ tic@@ u@@ lo@@ cy@@ te value , taking into account the an@@ emia ( i.e. the Re@@ tic@@ u@@ lo@@ cy@@ tes Index &quot; ) , is low ( &lt; 20,000 / mm@@ 3 or &lt; 20,000 / micro@@ litres or &lt; 0.5 % ) , the anti @-@ ery@@ thro@@ po@@ et@@ tin antibodies are determined and an examination of the bone mar@@ row should be considered to diagnose a PR@@ CA . &quot;
the data for immun@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity in sub@@ cut@@ aneous use of Ab@@ se@@ amed in patients with a risk of an anti @-@ induced PR@@ CA ( patients with ren@@ al ana@@ emia ) are not sufficient .
&quot; 8 In patients with chronic kidney failure , the upper limit of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration should not be exceeded in case of maintenance therapy . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials , increased mort@@ ality risk and risk for serious cardiovascular events were observed when ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ese @-@ stimul@@ ant active substances ( E@@ SA ) were given with a hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration of over 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) . &quot;
controlled clinical trials have shown no significant benefits derived from ep@@ ox@@ et@@ ine if the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in concentration is increased over the concentration required for controlling the ana@@ emia symptoms and the prevention of blood trans@@ fu@@ sions .
the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in switch should be about 1 g / dl ( 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month and should not exceed 2 g / dl ( 1.25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month to minimize the risk of an increase in hyper@@ tension .
&quot; in patients with chronic kidney failure and clin@@ ically evi@@ d@@ ent cor@@ on@@ ary heart disease or con@@ ges@@ tive heart failure , the upper limit of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration should not be exceeded in maintenance therapy . &quot;
&quot; according to the present knowledge , the treatment of ana@@ emia with ep@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa in adults with ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency , which are not yet di@@ aly@@ sis , will not accelerate the progression of ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency . &quot;
&quot; for the evaluation of the therapy efficiency of ep@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa , a 2 @-@ 3 @-@ week delay between ep@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa administration and ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin response should be considered ( patients who need to be trans@@ forms ) . &quot;
&quot; if the H@@ b increase is greater than 2 g / dl ( 1.25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month or a H@@ b value of 13 g / dl ( 8.1 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , the dose must be adjusted in accordance with section 4.2 , in order to minimize the risk of possible thro@@ mb@@ otic events ( see Section 4.2 Treatment of patients with chem@@ otherap@@ y@@ conditional an@@ emia - dose adjustment with the aim of holding the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ binary value between 10 g / dl and 12 g / dl ) . &quot;
the decision for applying re@@ combin@@ ant ery@@ thro@@ po@@ et@@ ine should be based on a benefit @-@ risk assessment based on the involvement of the respective patient who should also consider the specific clinical context .
&quot; in patients en@@ vis@@ aged for a greater elec@@ tive orthop@@ edi@@ c intervention , if possible , prior to ep@@ o@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa therapy , the cause of ana@@ emia should be examined and treated accordingly . &quot;
&quot; patients who under@@ go a major orthop@@ edi@@ c intervention should have appropriate th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis proph@@ yla@@ xis , as they have an increased risk of thro@@ mb@@ otic and v@@ ascular diseases , especially with a underlying cardiovascular disease . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it cannot be excluded that an increased risk of post@@ operative thro@@ mb@@ otic / v@@ ascular events can exist in treatment with ep@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa for patients with an output level of &gt; 13 g / dl . &quot;
&quot; in several controlled trials , ep@@ ox@@ et@@ ines have not been detected that they can improve overall survival in tumour patients or reduce the risk of progression progression . &quot;
&quot; 4 months in patients with metast@@ atic breast cancer , receiving chemotherapy , when a hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration of 12 - 14 g / dl ( 7.5 - 8.7 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) was as@@ pi@@ red &quot;
&quot; ep@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is used together with C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in , the blood levels of C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in should be controlled and the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ ta@@ sis should be adapted to the rising hem@@ atom@@ a . &quot;
&quot; in vit@@ ro studies on tumor tissues , there are no indications of interaction between ep@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa and G @-@ C@@ SF or GM @-@ C@@ SF regarding hem@@ at@@ ological differentiation or prolifer@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; an@@ thro@@ mb@@ otic , v@@ ascular events such as m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al isch@@ em@@ ias , m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ act , cer@@ eb@@ rov@@ ascular attacks , deep ven@@ ous thro@@ mb@@ oses , pul@@ mon@@ ary thro@@ mb@@ oses , pul@@ mon@@ ary thro@@ mb@@ oses , pul@@ mon@@ ary thro@@ mb@@ oses , ar@@ thro@@ mb@@ oses , and 11 blood cl@@ ots in artificial kid@@ neys were reported in patients suffering from ep@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa . &quot;
the most common side effect during treatment with ep@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is a dose @-@ dependent increase in blood pressure or the deteri@@ oration of an existing hyper@@ tension .
an increased inci@@ dence of th@@ rom@@ bo@@ v@@ ascular events ( see Section 4.4 and Section 4.8 - General ) was observed in patients with ery@@ thro@@ po@@ et@@ ines .
&quot; regardless of ery@@ thro@@ po@@ tin treatment , it can occur in surgical patients with cardiovascular disease after repeated blood donations to thro@@ mb@@ otic and v@@ ascular complications . &quot;
the gene@@ tically recovered ep@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is gly@@ co@@ si@@ fied and in relation to the amino acids and the carbohydr@@ ate content identical to the endo@@ genous human ery@@ thro@@ po@@ et@@ tin which was isolated from the urine of an@@ ag@@ ic patients .
it could be shown with the help of cultures of human bone mar@@ row cells that ep@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa specifically stimul@@ ates ery@@ thro@@ po@@ esis and does not affect leu@@ kop@@ oc@@ esis .
&quot; 389 patients with hem@@ o@@ bla@@ st@@ osis ( 221 multiple my@@ el@@ omas , 144 non @-@ Hod@@ g@@ kin@@ - lymph@@ omas and 24 other hem@@ o@@ bla@@ st@@ osis ) and 332 patients with solid tum@@ ours ( 172 breast cancer tum@@ ors , 23 bron@@ chi@@ al car@@ cin@@ omas , 22 prostate cancer , 21 g@@ astro@@ intestinal car@@ cin@@ omas and 30 others ) . &quot;
&quot; 1895 patients with solid tum@@ ours ( 683 Mam@@ ma@@ car@@ cin@@ omas , 260 Bron@@ chi@@ al car@@ cin@@ omas , 174 gy@@ nec@@ ological tum@@ ors , 300 g@@ astro@@ intestinal tum@@ ors and 478 others ) and 8@@ 02 patients with hem@@ o@@ blast dos@@ es . &quot;
survival and progression were examined in five major controlled trials with a total of 28@@ 33 patients ; four of these studies were double @-@ blind plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled studies and
in the open study there was no difference in overall survival between the patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin and the control patients .
&quot; in these studies , patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin was consistent with an@@ emia due to various more common mal@@ ign@@ om@@ ans , statisti@@ cally significantly higher mort@@ ality than in the controls . &quot;
overall survival in the studies could not be explained by differences in the inci@@ dence of thro@@ mb@@ oses and related complications in patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin .
&quot; there is an increased risk of th@@ rom@@ bo@@ em@@ bol@@ ic events in tumor patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ po@@ et@@ tin , and a negative effect on overall survival cannot be ruled out . &quot;
&quot; it is not clear how far these results are transferred to the application of re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ po@@ et@@ tin in tumor patients receiving chemotherapy with the aim of achieving a hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value below 13 g / dl , since too few patients with these characteristics were included in the checked data . &quot;
ep@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa provisions after intra@@ ven@@ ous application showed a half @-@ life of about 4 hours in healthy subjects and a slightly prolonged half @-@ life of about 5 hours in patients with ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency .
&quot; after sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection , ep@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa ser@@ um mirrors are much lower than the ser@@ um levels that are reached after intra@@ ven@@ ous injection . &quot;
&quot; there are no cum@@ ulation : the levels of ser@@ um remain equal , regardless of whether they are determined 24 hours after the first gift or 24 hours after the last gift . &quot;
( bone mark@@ s@@ ular fibro@@ sis is a known comp@@ lication of chronic kidney failure in humans and could be due to secondary hyper@@ par@@ ath@@ y@@ re@@ o@@ idi@@ tism or unknown factors .
&quot; in a study of hem@@ angi@@ oma patients treated three years with ep@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa , the inci@@ dence of bone mar@@ row fibro@@ sis was not increased compared to the control group with di@@ aly@@ sis patients ( which were not treated with ep@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa ) . &quot;
&quot; 14 In animal studies involving nearly 20 times of the recommended daily dose , ep@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa has led to dimin@@ ished federal body weight , to a delay in the oscill@@ ation and to an increase in the fet@@ al mort@@ ality . &quot;
these reports are based on in vit@@ ro findings with cells from human tumor tissue samples that are of in@@ secure Sig@@ ni@@ fi@@ ans for the clinical situation .
&quot; as part of the out@@ patient application , the patient can store Ab@@ und@@ amed uniqu@@ ely for a period of up to 3 days outside the fridge and not over 25 ° C . &quot;
&quot; the sy@@ ring@@ es are provided with gradu@@ ation rings and the filling volume is indicated by a bon@@ ded label , so if necessary , the dimensions of sub@@ sets are possible . &quot;
treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed must be led under the supervision of doctors who have experience in treating patients with the above indications .
&quot; 21 The recommended dosage is 600 I.@@ U. / kg ep@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa , which should be given once a week over three weeks ( day 21 , 14 and 7 ) before the surgery and on the day of surgery ( day 0 ) . &quot;
23 In patients with chronic kidney failure should not exceed 4.2 recommended upper limit of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration .
the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in switch should be about 1 g / dl ( 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month and should not exceed 2 g / dl ( 1.25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month to minimize the risk of an increase in hyper@@ tension .

&quot; during the treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed , there may be a slight dose @-@ dependent increase in the sperm count within the normal range , which is reg@@ a@@ ined in further treatment . &quot;
&quot; if necessary , your doctor will perform regular blood tests to check the number of blood plat@@ el@@ ets regularly during the first 8 weeks of treatment . &quot;
&quot; iron deficiency , dis@@ solution of red blood cells ( hem@@ oly@@ sis ) , blood loss , vitamin B@@ 12 or fo@@ lic acid deficiency should be considered and treated before the beginning of the therapy with Ab@@ se@@ amed . &quot;
very rare was reported about the occurrence of an anti @-@ cor@@ related ery@@ thro@@ bla@@ stom@@ a after months of treatment with sub@@ cut@@ aneous ( under the skin irrit@@ ated ) ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin .
&quot; if you suffer from ery@@ thro@@ bla@@ sts , it will termin@@ ate your therapy with Ab@@ se@@ amed and determine how your ana@@ emia is best treated . &quot;
&quot; therefore , Ab@@ se@@ amed must be given by injection into a v@@ ein ( intra@@ ven@@ ously ) if you are treated because of ana@@ emia due to kidney disease . &quot;
a high ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in value might be the risk of problems with the heart or blood vessels and the risk of death could be increased .
&quot; in case of increased or increasing pot@@ assium levels , your doctor may consider inter@@ ruption of treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed until the pot@@ assium levels are back in the normal range . &quot;
&quot; if you suffer from chronic kidney failure and clin@@ ically obvious cor@@ on@@ ary heart disease or st@@ ow@@ age due to in@@ adequate cardi@@ ac output , your doctor will make sure that your hem@@ og@@ lob@@ binary mirror does not exceed a certain value . &quot;
&quot; according to the present knowledge , the treatment of ana@@ emia with ab@@ se@@ amed in adults with chronic kidney failure ( ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency ) , which are not yet di@@ aly@@ sis , will not accelerate the progression of ren@@ al failure . &quot;
a 2 - 3 @-@ week delay between ep@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa gift and the desired effect should be taken into account for ass@@ essing the effectiveness of Ab@@ se@@ amed .
200 your doctor will regularly determine your values of the red blood dy@@ e ( hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in ) and adjust your se@@ amed dosage accordingly to keep the risk of blood car@@ p formation ( thro@@ mb@@ otic event ) as low as possible .
&quot; this risk should be carefully balanced towards the advantages derived from the treatment with ep@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa , especially if you have an increased risk of thro@@ mb@@ otic v@@ ascular events , for example if you have o@@ bes@@ e ( adi@@ pose ) or if in the past already thro@@ mb@@ otic v@@ ascular events occurred ( e.g. deep ven@@ ous thro@@ mb@@ lo@@ sis or pul@@ mon@@ ary bu@@ lie ) . &quot;
&quot; if you are cancer patient , remember that Ab@@ se@@ amed is like a growth factor for blood cells and may affect the tumor negative under certain circumstances . &quot;
&quot; if a major orthop@@ edi@@ c surgery is im@@ min@@ ent , the cause of your ana@@ emia should be examined and treated accordingly . &quot;
&quot; if your values of the red blood dy@@ e ( hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in ) are too high , you should not get Ab@@ se@@ amed because there is increased risk of blood car@@ p after surgery . &quot;
&quot; please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you take / apply other medicines or have been taken / used recently , even if it is not prescription drugs . &quot;
&quot; if you take C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( remedy for supp@@ ression of the immune system ) during your treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed , your doctor may request certain blood check@@ ups to measure the blood levels of C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in . &quot;
&quot; laboratory tests have shown no interaction between ep@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa and G @-@ C@@ SF or GM @-@ C@@ SF ( G @-@ C@@ SF and GM @-@ C@@ SF are a means to build up the immune system , for example for cancer chemotherapy or HIV ) . &quot;
&quot; depending on how your ana@@ emia ( ana@@ emia ) refers to the treatment , the dose may be adjusted for about every four weeks until your condition is under control . &quot;
your doctor will possibly arrange regular blood tests to check the treatment success and ensure that the drug works properly and your hem@@ og@@ lob@@ binary value does not exceed a certain value .
&quot; once you are well tuned , you receive regular dos@@ es of se@@ amed between 25 and 50 I.@@ U. / kg twice a week , spread over two equally large inj@@ ections . &quot;
your doctor will possibly arrange regular blood tests to check the treatment success and ensure that your hem@@ og@@ lob@@ binary value does not exceed a certain value .
&quot; depending on how the an@@ emia respon@@ ds to the treatment , the dose may be adjusted for about every four weeks until the condition is under control . &quot;
&quot; to ensure this and ensure that the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ binary value does not exceed a certain value , the doctor will conduct regular blood tests . &quot;
&quot; if it is necessary to shor@@ ten the treatment time before surgery , a dose of 300 I.@@ E. / kg may be given in 10 consecutive days before surgery , on the day of the operation and another 4 days after surgery . &quot;
&quot; however , if your doctor considers this to be appropriate , you can also learn how to splash yourself se@@ amed yourself under the skin . &quot;

Ac@@ la@@ sta is used to treat the following diseases : • Oste@@ opor@@ osis ( a disease which makes the bones crack ) both in women after men@@ op@@ ause and in men .
&quot; it is applied in patients with a high risk of frac@@ tures ( frac@@ tures ) , including patients who have recently suffered a sli@@ ght@@ less hip fra@@ cture as during falling ; • Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the bone , a disease that changes the normal course of bone growth . &quot;
&quot; in addition , patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get should take at least 500 mg calcium twice a day for at least 10 days after the treatment ; patients with hip fra@@ cture should obtain a large dose of vitamin D ( 50 000 to 125 000 IE ) or@@ ally or by injection into a muscle before the first in@@ fusion . &quot;
&quot; the administration of acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ( remedy against inflammation ) shortly after the application of Ac@@ la@@ sta can reduce the symptoms appearing in the three days after in@@ fusion , such as fever , muscle aches , flu @-@ like symptoms , joint pain and head@@ ache . &quot;
&quot; for the treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , Ac@@ la@@ sta may only be prescribed by doctors who have experience in treating this disease . &quot;
&quot; as the active ingredient in Ac@@ la@@ sta is the same as in Z@@ omet@@ a , a part of the data material for Z@@ omet@@ a was used to evaluate Ac@@ la@@ sta . &quot;
&quot; in the first study nearly 8 000 older women were involved in oste@@ opor@@ osis , and the number of spine and hip frac@@ tures was examined over a period of three years . &quot;
&quot; the second study included 2 127 men and women with oste@@ opor@@ osis over 50 years , who recently had suffered a hip fra@@ cture ; the number of frac@@ tures was examined over a period of up to five years . &quot;
&quot; in the case of Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , Ac@@ la@@ sta has been tested in two studies on a total of 357 patients and compared with Ris@@ er@@ ron@@ ate ( another bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate ) for six months . &quot;
&quot; the main indicator for the efficacy was , whether the sal@@ ary of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ ate gases in the ser@@ um ( an enzyme that builds bone substance ) in the blood again norm@@ alized or decreased by at least 75 % compared to the initial value . &quot;
in the study with older women the risk of vert@@ ebral frac@@ tures was reduced by 70 % compared to plac@@ ebo men ( without any other oste@@ opor@@ osis treatment ) over a period of three years .
the risk of frac@@ tures was reduced by 41 % compared to patients with Ac@@ la@@ sta ( with or without any other oste@@ opor@@ osis treatment ) .
&quot; in the study involving men and women with hip fra@@ cture , 9 % of patients under Ac@@ la@@ sta had a fra@@ cture ( 92 of 1 0@@ 65 ) compared to 13 % of patients taking plac@@ ebo ( 139 of 1 0@@ 62 ) . &quot;
most side effects of Ac@@ la@@ sta occur within the first three days after in@@ fusion and are less frequent in repeated in@@ fu@@ sions .
Ac@@ la@@ sta may not be used in patients who may possibly be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid or other bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate or any of the other ingredients .
&quot; as with all bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates , patients at Ac@@ la@@ sta are subject to the risk of kidney problems , reactions to in@@ fusion and oste@@ on@@ ec@@ sis ( dying of bone tissue ) in the jaw . &quot;
&quot; the manufacturer of Ac@@ la@@ sta provides information for doctors who prescri@@ be ac@@ la@@ sta to treat oste@@ opor@@ osis , as well as similar material for patients in which the drug &apos;s side effects are explained and indicated when they should contact the doctor . &quot;

&quot; patient information package should be provided and the following core messages include : • The package supplement • Con@@ tra@@ cing of calcium and vitamin D , appropriate physical activity , non @-@ smoking and a healthy diet • Import@@ ant signs and symptoms for serious side effects • When to access medical or nursing assistance &quot;
&quot; oste@@ opor@@ osis treatment • in men with post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women • in men with increased risk of frac@@ tures , including patients with low @-@ traumatic oste@@ opor@@ osis . &quot;
intra@@ ven@@ ous in@@ fusion of 5 mg Ac@@ la@@ sta is recommended once a year for the treatment of post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis and oste@@ opor@@ osis in men .
&quot; in patients with low @-@ traumatic hip frac@@ tures , the administration of the in@@ fusion of Ac@@ la@@ sta is recommended two or more weeks after surgical treatment of the hip fra@@ cture ( see Section 5.1 ) . &quot;
&quot; for the treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , Ac@@ la@@ sta should only be prescribed by doctors who have experience in treating the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get . &quot;
after a treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get with Ac@@ la@@ sta a long re@@ mission period was observed in patients who responded to the therapy ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; in addition , it is very advisable to ensure sufficient intake of calcium in patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , respectively twice daily , at least 500 mg of basic calcium , for at least 10 days after the administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients with a low @-@ traumatic hip fra@@ cture , an initial dose of 50,000 to 125@@ .000 I.@@ U. or@@ ally or in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular vitamin D is recommended before the first Ac@@ lac@@ sta in@@ fusion . &quot;
the frequency of symptoms which occur within the first three days after administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta can be reduced by offering par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen shortly after the application of Ac@@ la@@ sta .
patients with kidney dysfunction ( see Section 4.4 ) For patients with a cre@@ atin@@ ine clearance &lt; 35 ml / min Ac@@ la@@ sta is not recommended since limited clinical experience exists for this group of patients .
&quot; older patients ( ≥ 65 years ) A dose adjustment is not necessary because bio@@ availability , distribution and elim@@ ination in older patients are similar to younger patients . &quot;
children and adol@@ esc@@ ents Ac@@ la@@ sta are not recommended for use in children and adol@@ esc@@ ents under 18 years of age since data are missing for harm@@ lessness and efficacy .
Ac@@ la@@ sta is not recommended in patients with severe kidney failure ( cre@@ atin@@ ine clearance &lt; 35 ml / min ) because there are limited clinical experience for this patient population .
pre @-@ existing hypo@@ kal@@ emia can be treated with an adequate intake of calcium and vitamin D prior to the start of the therapy ( see Section 4.3 ) .
&quot; because of the rapid inser@@ tion of the effect of ol@@ ed@@ ron acid on bone um@@ bau , a temporary , sometimes sy@@ mpt@@ om@@ atic hy@@ post@@ cal@@ emia can develop , whose maximum occurs within the first 10 days after the in@@ fusion of Ac@@ la@@ sta ( see Section 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it is very advisable to ensure sufficient intake of calcium in patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , respectively twice daily , at least 500 mg of basic calcium , for at least 10 days after the administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; cancer , chemotherapy , treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , poor oral hygiene should be considered before an application of bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates a dental examination with appropriate preventive dental treatment . &quot;
&quot; for patients who require dental surgery , no data is available if the inter@@ ruption of the treatment with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates reduces the risk of oste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ sis in the jaw area . &quot;
clinical evaluation by the attending physician should be the basis for the treatment plan of each patient and based on an individual benefit risk assessment .
the frequency of symptoms which occur within the first three days after administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta can be reduced by offering par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen shortly after the application of Ac@@ la@@ sta ( see section 4.2 ) .
&quot; the inci@@ dence of cases of atri@@ al fibr@@ ill@@ ation in cases of atri@@ al fibr@@ ill@@ ation was increased ( 1,3 % ) ( 51 of 3,@@ 8@@ 62 ) compared to patients receiving plac@@ ebo ( 0,6 % ) ( 22 of 3,@@ 8@@ 52 ) . &quot;
&quot; oste@@ opor@@ osis Studies ( PFT , HOR@@ I@@ Z@@ ON - Recur@@ rent Fra@@ cture Trial &#91; R@@ FT &#93; ) was the overall frequency of atri@@ al fibr@@ ill@@ ation between Ac@@ la@@ sta ( 2.6 % ) and plac@@ ebo ( 2.1 % ) . &quot;
&quot; frequent ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , common ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasional ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) adverse drug effects are listed in Table 1 . &quot;
&quot; ren@@ al dysfunction Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid was associated with ren@@ al dys@@ functions associated with kidney function ( i.e. an increase in ser@@ um cre@@ atin@@ ins ) and in rare cases as acute ren@@ al failure . &quot;
the change in the cre@@ atin@@ ine clearance ( measured annually before administration ) and the occurrence of kidney failure and a limited kidney function were comparable in a clinical trial for oste@@ opor@@ osis over three years between the Ac@@ ella sta@@ - and the plac@@ ebo group .
a temporary increase in the ser@@ um cre@@ atin@@ ins within 10 days of application was observed at 1.8 % of patients receiving plac@@ ebo .
&quot; based on evaluation of laboratory findings , the temporary asy@@ mpt@@ om@@ atic calcium levels ( less than 2.9 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) were found in patients treated below the normal threshold ( less than 2.9 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) compared to 21 % of patients treated with Ac@@ la@@ sta in the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get trials . &quot;
&quot; all patients received sufficient amounts of vitamin D and calcium in the study on post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis , in the study to prevent clinical frac@@ tures after a hip fra@@ cture and in the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get studies ( see Section 4.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; in the study to prevent clinical frac@@ tures after a recently in@@ treated hip frac@@ tures , the vitamin D levels were not rout@@ in@@ ely measured , but the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D before administration of ac@@ la@@ sta ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; local reactions following the administration of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid in a large clinical study was reported on local reactions to the in@@ fusion body , such as red@@ dening , swelling and / or pain , reported ( 0.7 % ) . &quot;
&quot; oste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ ses in the or@@ tho@@ don@@ tic area were secre@@ tly treated , especially in cancer patients , about oste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ ses ( primarily in the jaw area ) reported with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates , including Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid . &quot;
many of these patients had signs of local infections including oste@@ omyel@@ itis and the majority of the reports refers to cancer patients after tooth extraction or other dental interven@@ ants .
&quot; 7 study with 7,@@ 7@@ 36 patients performed oste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ sis in the jaw area at a patient treated with Ac@@ la@@ sta and a patient treated with plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in the case of over@@ dosing , which results in a clin@@ ically relevant hypo@@ kal@@ emia , a balance can be achieved by offering oral calcium and / or an intra@@ ven@@ ous in@@ fusion of calcium glu@@ con@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; clinical efficacy in the treatment of post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis ( PFT ) The efficacy and safety of Ac@@ la@@ sta 5 mg once a year for 3 consecutive years ( 7,@@ 7@@ 36 women aged between 65 and 89 years ) with either a bone density value ( BM@@ D ) -@@ T score for the Sch@@ enk@@ el@@ h@@ eck ≤ -@@ 2,5 with or without signs of an existing spine frac@@ tures . &quot;
effects on morph@@ ometric frac@@ tures of the vert@@ ebral frac@@ tures increased significantly over a period of three years as well as after a year the frequency of one or more new vert@@ ebral frac@@ tures ( see table 2 ) .
Ac@@ cu@@ sta @-@ treated patients of 75 years and older had a 60 % reduced risk of vert@@ ebral frac@@ tures compared to plac@@ ebo patients ( p &lt; 0.0@@ 001 ) .
&quot; effects on hip frac@@ tures showed a constant effect over three years , resulting in a reduced risk of frac@@ tures in a 41 % ( 95 % CI , 17 % to 58 % ) . &quot;
&quot; the effect on bone density ( BM@@ D ) Ac@@ la@@ sta raised the bone density on the lum@@ bar vert@@ eb@@ rate , hip and dist@@ al radius compared to plac@@ ebo treatment ( 6 , 12 , 24 and 36 months ) . &quot;
&quot; 9 In@@ cre@@ ase the lum@@ bar density of the lum@@ bar spine by 6.7 % , the entire hips at 6.0 % , the thig@@ h neck by 5.1 % and the dist@@ al radius of 3.2 % . &quot;
bone hist@@ ology In 152 post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ otic patients treated with acet@@ sta ( N = 82 ) or plac@@ ebo ( N = 70 ) were taken a year after the third annual dose of bone bi@@ op@@ si@@ es from the pel@@ vis .
micro@@ computer@@ ised tom@@ ography ( µ@@ CT ) analysis showed an increase in tr@@ ab@@ ec@@ ular bone volume compared to plac@@ ebo and the preservation of tr@@ ab@@ ec@@ ular bone architecture .
&quot; bone substitute mark@@ ers The bone @-@ specific alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase ( B@@ SAP ) , the N @-@ terminal pro@@ pep@@ tide of the type I@@ - col@@ lagen ( P@@ 1@@ NP ) in the ser@@ um and the beta @-@ C tel@@ op@@ ep@@ ti@@ d ( b @-@ CT@@ x ) in ser@@ um were determined in sub @-@ groups from 517 to 1,@@ 246 patients in peri@@ odic intervals during the duration of study . &quot;
the treatment with an annual 5 @-@ mg dose Ac@@ la@@ sta has decreased significantly after 12 months by 30 % compared to the initial value and was held at 28 % below the initial value of up to 36 months .
P@@ 1@@ NP was significantly reduced by 61 % below the initial value after 12 months and was held at 52 % below the initial value for up to 36 months .
B @-@ CT@@ x was significantly reduced by 61 % below the initial value after 12 months and was held at 55 % below the initial value for up to 36 months .
&quot; vitamin D levels were not rout@@ in@@ ely measured , but the majority of patients received a starting dose of vitamin D ( 50,000 to 125@@ .000 I.@@ E. oral or in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular ) 2 weeks before in@@ fusion . &quot;
total mort@@ ality was 10 % ( 101 patients ) compared to 13 % ( 141 patients ) in the plac@@ ebo group .
effect on bone mineral density ( BM@@ D ) in the HOR@@ I@@ Z@@ ON @-@ R@@ FT study increased the Ac@@ lac@@ sta treatment in comparison to plac@@ ebo treatment the BM@@ D on the total ju@@ ices and thig@@ h he@@ als at all times .
the treatment conducted over 24 months compared to plac@@ ebo treatment to an increase in BM@@ D by 5.4 % in total power and 4.3 % at the Sch@@ enk@@ el@@ h@@ al .
&quot; clinical efficacy in men In the HOR@@ I@@ Z@@ ON R@@ FT study were 508 men random@@ ised , and 185 patients were assessed by the BM@@ D after 24 months . &quot;
the study was not designed to show a reduction in clinical frac@@ tures in men ; the frequency of clinical frac@@ tures was 7.5 % in Ac@@ cu@@ sta @-@ treated men compared to 8.7 % in plac@@ ebo .
&quot; in another study in men ( study CZ@@ I@@ 4@@ 46@@ M@@ 230@@ 8 ) , the annual administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta compared to the once weekly administration of Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate did not submit to the percentage change in the lum@@ bar vert@@ eb@@ ra@@ e by the BM@@ D after 24 months in comparison with the initial value . &quot;
&quot; clinical efficacy of the treatment of the patient &apos;s disease Pa@@ get of the bone ac@@ la@@ sta was examined in patients aged over 30 years with radi@@ ologically confirmed , above all light to moderate mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the bone ( medium ser@@ um mirror of the alkal@@ ine phosph@@ ate gases in accordance with the 2,6@@ fold to 3,0@@ fold age @-@ specific upper normal value for inclusion in the study ) . &quot;
11 The efficacy of an in@@ fusion of 5 mg of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid compared to intake of 30 mg of Ris@@ er@@ ron@@ ate once daily during 2 months has been demonstrated in two six @-@ month compar@@ ative studies .
&quot; in the combined results , a similar decrease in pain intensity and pain control was observed after 6 months in comparison with the initial value for Ac@@ la@@ sta and Ris@@ er@@ ron@@ ate . &quot;
patients who were classified as respon@@ der at the end of the six @-@ month main study ( responded to the therapy ) could be included in an observ@@ atory phase .
&quot; from the 143 with Ac@@ la@@ sta and the 107 treated with Ris@@ er@@ ron@@ ate , the therapeutic response was 141 of patients treated with Ac@@ lac@@ sta , compared to 71 of patients treated with Ris@@ er@@ ron@@ ate , during an average duration of the post @-@ observ@@ ations period of 18 months after the application . &quot;
&quot; multiple 5 and 15 minutes long in@@ fusion of 2 , 4 , 8 and 16 mg of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid in 64 patients showed the following pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data , which proved to be dos@@ is@@ independent . &quot;
&quot; after that , the plas@@ tici@@ zing seal quickly decreased from &lt; 10 % of the peak to 4 h and &lt; 1 % after 24 h , followed by a long @-@ lasting phase very low concentration , no more than 0.1 % of the maximum value . &quot;
rapid bi@@ polar dis@@ appearance from the big cycle with half @-@ life times t ½ α 0.@@ 24 and t ½ β 1.@@ 87 hours followed by a long elim@@ ination phase with a terminal elim@@ ination period t ½ γ 146 hours .
the early distribution phases ( α and β ) represent the rapid res@@ or@@ ption in the bones and ex@@ cre@@ tion over the kid@@ neys .
&quot; in the first 24 hours , 39 ± 16 % of the ad@@ ministered dose can be found in the urine , while the rest is mainly bound to bone tissue . &quot;
&quot; the total body clearance is independent of the dose 5,@@ 04 ± 2.5 l / h and remains un@@ affected by sex , age , race or body weight . &quot;
&quot; an extension of the in@@ fusion time of 5 to 15 minutes led to the decrease of the ol@@ ed@@ ron acid concentration by 30 % at the end of the in@@ fusion , but had no effect on the surface below the curve ( plasma concentration against time ) . &quot;
&quot; a dimin@@ ished clearance of met@@ ab@@ oli@@ zed substances by cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 enzyme systems is unlikely , because z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid is not met@@ ab@@ oli@@ zed in humans and because they are a weak or no direct and / or irre@@ ver@@ sible , metabol@@ ised inhibit@@ or of the P@@ 450@@ - &quot;
&quot; special patient groups ( see section 4.2 ) The ren@@ al clearance of the ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid cor@@ related with the cre@@ atin@@ ine Clear@@ ance , namely 75 ± 33 % of the cre@@ atin@@ ine Clear@@ ance , and in the 64 patients examined in the mean 84 ± 29 ml / min ( range 22 to 143 ml / min ) . &quot;
&quot; this results in an easy ( cl@@ c@@ r = 50@@ - 80 ml / min ) and a moderate ren@@ al dysfunction up to a cre@@ atin@@ ine clearance up to 35 ml / min , no dose adjustment of the Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid . &quot;
&quot; since severe kidney dysfunction ( cre@@ atin@@ ine Clear@@ ance &lt; 30 ml / min ) are only limited , no statements are possible for this population . &quot;
acute toxic@@ ity The highest non @-@ Latvian acting intra@@ ven@@ ous single dose was 10 mg / kg body weight and in rats 0.6 mg / kg body weight .
&quot; in dogs , single dos@@ es of 1.0 mg / kg ( based on the AU@@ C the 6@@ fold of the recommended human @-@ therapeutic ex@@ position ) were ad@@ ministered over a period of 15 minutes , good and without a ren@@ al influence . &quot;
&quot; chronic and chronic toxic@@ ity In studies with intra@@ ven@@ ous application , the ren@@ al toler@@ ability of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid in rats was ad@@ ministered by a 15 @-@ minute in@@ fusion in 3 @-@ day intervals , a total of 6 times ( a cum@@ ulative dosage corresponding to the 7 @-@ fold human @-@ therapeutic ex@@ position related to the AU@@ C ) . &quot;
&quot; long @-@ term studies with repeated application in cum@@ ulated exposure , which sufficiently exceeded the maximum of the intended human exposure , toxic@@ ological effects in other organs , including the g@@ astro@@ intestinal tract and the liver , and the intra@@ ven@@ ous injection point . &quot;
&quot; the most common finding in trials with repeated application was an increased primary spon@@ gi@@ osa in the met@@ ap@@ hy@@ sis of the long bones in animals in the growth phase with almost all dos@@ es , an inf@@ estation , which reflects the pharmac@@ ological , anti@@ res@@ or@@ tive effect of the substance . &quot;
&quot; in rats , one observed a ter@@ ato@@ gen@@ ic@@ ity in dos@@ es of 0.2 mg / kg as outer and internal ( vis@@ cer@@ al ) ab@@ norm@@ alities and such skel@@ eton . &quot;
&quot; no ter@@ ato@@ genic effects or embr@@ yo @-@ fet@@ al effects were observed in rab@@ bits , although the mat@@ ernal toxic@@ ity was pronounced at 0.1 mg / kg due to the reduced ser@@ um calcium level . &quot;
&quot; if the medicine is not used immediately , the user is responsible for the storage time after preparation and the conditions before the application ; normally , 24 h at 2 ° C to 8 ° C should not be exceeded . &quot;

&quot; July 2007 , supple@@ mented on 29 September 2006 , the pharmac@@ ovi@@ gil@@ ance system described in the module 1.@@ 8.1 of the application for authorisation is and works before and while the product is mark@@ eted . &quot;
&quot; Ris@@ ko @-@ Management @-@ Plan The owner of approval for the in@@ tranet under@@ takes to carry out the studies and the additional activities for pharmac@@ ovi@@ gil@@ ance , specified in the pharmac@@ ovi@@ gil@@ ance plan of the approved version 004 of the risk management plan ( R@@ MP ) in Modul 1.@@ 8.2 of the authorisation application and all subsequent versions of the R@@ MP approved by CH@@ MP . &quot;
&quot; according to the CH@@ MP Directive on Risk Management Systems for Medic@@ inal Products , the revised R@@ MP should be submitted together with the next &quot; Peri@@ odic Safety Update Report ( P@@ SUR ) . &quot; &quot;
&quot; a revised R@@ MP should be submitted • When new information is known , which could affect the current statements on security , pharmac@@ ovi@@ gil@@ ance plan or activities to minim@@ ise the risk . &quot;
&quot; Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid is a representative of a sub @-@ dance class called bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate , and is used to treat oste@@ opor@@ osis in post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women , oste@@ opor@@ osis in men and the mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the bone . &quot;
&quot; decre@@ asing blood levels of sex hormones , especially est@@ ro@@ gens , which are formed from andro@@ gens , play a role in the rather gradu@@ al loss of bone mass , which is observed in men . &quot;
&quot; in the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get the bone structure occurs too fast , and new bone material is constructed un@@ ordered , which makes the bone material we@@ aker than normal . &quot;
&quot; Ac@@ la@@ sta works by norm@@ alizing the bone structure again , thereby ensuring normal bone formation , giving strength to the bone once more . &quot;
&quot; if you are in dental treatment or need to under@@ go a dental surgery , tell your doctor that you will be treated with Ac@@ la@@ sta . &quot;
&quot; if you use Ac@@ la@@ sta with other medicines , please inform your doctor , pharmac@@ ist or nursing staff if you take / apply other medicines or have been taken / used recently , even if it is not prescription drugs . &quot;
&quot; for your doctor , it is especially important to know if you are taking drugs that are known to them to damage the kid@@ neys . &quot;
&quot; when using Ac@@ la@@ sta , together with food and drink , you are worried that according to your doctor &apos;s instructions there is sufficient liquid before and after the treatment with Ac@@ la@@ sta . &quot;
oste@@ opor@@ osis The usual dose is 5 mg once a year that is given to you by your doctor or the nursing staff as in@@ fusion in a v@@ ein .
&quot; if you have recently broken down the hips , it is recommended to make the administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta two or more weeks following the operational supply of the hip bridge . &quot;
&quot; the usual dose is 5 mg , which is given to you by your doctor or the nursing staff as in@@ fusion in a v@@ ein . &quot;
&quot; if Ac@@ la@@ sta works for a long time , you may need a further dose only after one year or longer . &quot;
it is important to follow these instructions carefully so that the calcium level in your blood in the time after in@@ fusion is not too low .
&quot; with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get Ac@@ la@@ sta can work longer than one year , and your doctor will inform you if you need a renewed treatment . &quot;
&quot; if the administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta has been missed , contact your doctor or hospital immediately to arrange a new appointment . &quot;
&quot; before stopping the treatment with Ac@@ la@@ sta If you are considering the completion of the treatment with Ac@@ la@@ sta , please check your next doctor &apos;s date and discuss this with your doctor . &quot;
&quot; side effects associated with the first in@@ fusion occur very often ( with more than 30 % of the patients ) , but are less frequent following the subsequent in@@ fu@@ sions . &quot;
&quot; fever and ch@@ ills , muscle or joint pain and head@@ aches occur within the first three days after the administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta . &quot;
&quot; currently it is un@@ clear whether Ac@@ la@@ sta causes this irregular heart@@ beat , but you should report it to your doctor if you notice such symptoms when you have received Ac@@ la@@ sta . &quot;
&quot; physical signs because of too low calcium concentration in the blood , such as muscle cr@@ amps or cra@@ w@@ ling or de@@ af feeling , especially in the area around the mouth . &quot;

persistent pain and / or not healing wounds in the mouth or at the jaw were reported above all in patients treated with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates because of other diseases .
&quot; allergic reactions , including rare cases of respiratory problems , hi@@ ves r@@ ash and angi@@ o@@ ede@@ ma ( such as swelling in the face , tongue or throat ) , was reported . &quot;
&quot; please inform your doctor , pharmac@@ ist or nursing staff , if any of the side effects you see significantly affects you or you notice side effects that are not listed in this information . &quot;
&quot; if the medicine is not used immediately , the user is responsible for the storage time and conditions up to the application ; normally , 24 h at 2 ° C to 8 ° C should not be exceeded . &quot;
&quot; in patients with a recently launched low @-@ traumatic hip fra@@ cture , the in@@ fusion of Ac@@ la@@ sta is recommended two or more weeks after the surgical treatment of the hips fra@@ cture . &quot;
&quot; before and after the administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta , patients need to be sufficiently supplied with fluid ; this is particularly important in patients receiving di@@ ure@@ tic therapy . &quot;
&quot; due to the rapid inser@@ tion of the effect of ol@@ ed@@ ron acid on bone um@@ bau , a temporary , sometimes sy@@ mpt@@ om@@ atic progression can develop , which is usually occurring within the first 10 days after the in@@ fusion of Ac@@ la@@ sta . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it is very advisable to ensure sufficient intake of calcium in patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , in accordance with at least twice daily 500 mg of basic calcium , for at least 10 days after the administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta . &quot;
&quot; in patients with a recently updated low @-@ traumatic hip fra@@ cture , an initial dose of 50,000 to 125@@ .000 I.@@ U. or@@ ally or in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular vitamin D is recommended before the in@@ fusion of Ac@@ la@@ sta . &quot;
&quot; if you need more information about your disease or treatment , please read the package insert ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) or contact your doctor or pharmac@@ ist . &quot;
&quot; A@@ comp@@ lia is additionally applied to a diet and exercise for the treatment of adult patients suffering from o@@ besity ( body mass index - BM@@ I ) of 30 kg / m ² or above ( BM@@ I of 27 kg / m ² or above ) and above , one or more &quot;
&quot; in addition , four studies have been carried out to over 7 000 patients in which A@@ comp@@ lia was used as a suppor@@ tive agent for setting up smoking compared to plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; the studies on the setting of smoking showed no uniform results , so that the effect of A@@ comp@@ lia was difficult to assess in this area of application . &quot;
&quot; what risk is associated with A@@ comp@@ lia ? he The most common side effects of A@@ comp@@ lia , which were noted during the studies ( observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients ) were nau@@ sea ( nau@@ sea ) and infections of upper respiratory branches . ng The full listing of side effects reported in connection with A@@ comp@@ lia reported side effects . &quot;
&quot; it may also not be used in patients suffering from an existing severe depression or treated with anti@@ de@@ press@@ ants , as it may increase the risk of depression and , among other things , can give rise to a small minority of patients suffering from su@@ icide . &quot;
&quot; caution is advised while applying A@@ comp@@ lia with medicines such as k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole or i@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole ( medicines for fung@@ al infections ) , k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( a remedy for the use of HI@@ V@@ - infection ) , tel@@ i@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or clari@@ thro@@ my@@ cin ( antibiotics ) . LN &quot;
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the effectiveness of A@@ comp@@ lia in terms of weight reduction in patients with o@@ besity or over@@ weight cuts

A@@ comp@@ lia is not recommended for use in children and adol@@ esc@@ ents under 18 years due to lack of data on efficacy and harm@@ lessness .
&quot; La Dep@@ res@@ sive disease or mood alter@@ ations with depres@@ sive symptoms were reported at up to 10 % , su@@ ici@@ dal thoughts of up to 1 % of patients receiving Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant ( see Section 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant may not be applied in depres@@ sive disorders unless the benefit of the treatment in individual case out@@ weigh@@ s the risk ( see Section 4.3 and 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; even in patients who - in addition to o@@ besity , do not have any noticeable risks , depres@@ sive reactions can occur . &quot;
members or other closest people are to point out that it is necessary to monitor the new occurrence of such symptoms and immediately obtain medical advice if these symptoms occur .
• El@@ der patients The effectiveness and harm@@ lessness of Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant in the treatment of patients over 75 years were not shown sufficiently .
patients with a cardiovascular event ( m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction or stroke ) less than 6 months ago were excluded from studies with Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant .

the following table ( table 1 ) shows the undes@@ irable effects in plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled trials in patients treated for weight reduction and related met@@ abolic diseases .
&quot; when the inci@@ dence was statisti@@ cally significant higher than the corresponding plac@@ ebo rate ( for adverse effects ≥ 1 % ) or if they were clin@@ ically relevant ( for adverse events &lt; 1 % ) . NG When evalu@@ ating side effects , the following inci@@ dents are basically laid down : &quot;
&quot; frequent ( ≥ 10 % ) ; frequent ( ≥ 1 , &lt; 10 % ) ; occasionally ( ≥ 0.1 , &lt; 1 % ) ; rare ( ≥ 0.0@@ 1 , &lt; 0.1 % ) ; very t l@@ ä &quot;
&quot; in a supplementary study , in which a limited number of persons were ad@@ ministered up to 300 mg , only slight symptoms were observed . &quot;
the patients had a BM@@ I ≥ 30 kg / m ² or BM@@ I &gt; 27 kg / m ² and an existing hyper@@ tension and / or dy@@ sli@@ pi@@ de@@ mia at the same time .
&quot; weight reduction after one year was for A@@ comp@@ lia 20 mg 6.5 kg , relative to the initial value , compared to 1.6 kg for the plac@@ ebo group ( difference -@@ 4.@@ 9 kg CI@@ 95 % -@@ 5.3 ; -@@ 4.4 , p &lt; 0.0@@ 01 ) . &quot;
patients treated with A@@ comp@@ lia 20 mg and 1.2 kg in the plac@@ ebo group ( difference -@@ 3.8 kg ; CI@@ 95 % -@@ 4.4 ; -@@ 3.3 ; p &lt; 0.0@@ 01 ) .
&quot; after 2 years the difference in the total weight reduction was between A@@ comp@@ lia and plac@@ ebo -@@ 4,2 kg ( CI@@ 95 % -@@ 5.0 % ; -@@ 3,4 , p &lt; 0,@@ 001 ) . E@@ IM &quot;
&quot; 9 Weight reduction and other risk factors in the studies in patients with no diabetes , in which a mixed population of patients with &quot;
&quot; with Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant 20 mg , an average waste of the tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de of 6.9 % was seen ( tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de 1.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) in comparison with an increase of 5.8 % &quot;
&quot; in a second study in patients with o@@ besity and previously untreated type @-@ 2- diabetes ( SER@@ EN@@ A@@ DE ) , the absolute change in the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c value ( with an initial value of 7.9 % for both groups ) after 6 months -@@ 0.8 for Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant 20 mg and -@@ 0,3 under plac@@ ebo &quot;
the percentage of patients with a H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c@@ - value of &lt; 7 % was 51 % in the Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant group and 35 % in the plac@@ ebo group .
&quot; mean weight change in the plac@@ ebo group was 3.8 kg ( CI@@ 95 % -@@ 5,0 , -@@ 2,6 p &lt; 0,@@ 001 ) . &quot;
improvement of the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c value in patients who had taken Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant 20 mg were about 50 % due to direct effects of Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant and about 50 % explained by weight reduction . n eim Ar@@ z

&quot; 5.3 Pre@@ clinical data on the safety of the following undes@@ irable effects , which were not observed in clinical trials , but which occurred in animals after exposure in the human therapeutic area , were considered possibly relevant for the clinical application : &quot;
&quot; in some , however , not in all cases , the beginning of the con@@ vul@@ sions seems to be associated with proced@@ ural stress such as dealing with animals . &quot;
&quot; Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant was given over a longer period prior to the mat@@ ing ( 9 weeks ) , which allowed a recovery from the initial effects of Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant so no unwanted effects were observed on fertility or cycle distur@@ bances . &quot;
the influence of Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant on pre@@ - and post@@ nat@@ al development was investigated at the rat in dos@@ es of up to 10 mg / kg / day .
&quot; in a study of rats for pre@@ - and post@@ nat@@ al development , an exposure with Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant in uter@@ o and lac@@ tation caused no changes in learning behaviour or memory . &quot;

summary of the EP@@ AR for the public The present document is a summary of the European public assessment report ( EP@@ AR ) in which explains how the Human Use Committee ( CH@@ MP ) evaluated the conducted studies to make recommendations concerning the application of the drug .
Ac@@ tos is used to treat type 2 diabetes ( also known as non @-@ ins@@ ulin @-@ dependent diabetes ) . • It can be used alone ( mon@@ otherapy ) in patients ( especially over@@ weight patients ) in which met@@ form@@ in ( a diabetes medication ) is not indicated . • It can be used together with another diabetes medication ( dual therapy ) .
&quot; it can be applied in addition to met@@ form@@ in in patients ( especially over@@ weight patients ) , which can not be satis@@ factory with met@@ form@@ in alone in the highest toler@@ able dose . &quot;
&quot; in combination with a sul@@ fon@@ yl@@ us or ins@@ ulin , the previous dose of the sulph@@ onic acid or ins@@ ulin can be retained with the start of the Ac@@ tos treatment except for patients with hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia ( low blood sugar ) , and the dose of the sulph@@ onic acid or ins@@ ulin should be reduced . &quot;
&quot; this means that the body &apos;s own ins@@ ulin can be better utilized and the blood sugar level decre@@ ases , making it better to adjust type 2 diabetes . &quot;
&quot; in more than 1 400 patients the efficacy of Ac@@ tos in tri@@ ple@@ therapy was examined ; in addition , patients received a combination of met@@ form@@ in with a sul@@ fon@@ yl@@ onite , in addition they received either Ac@@ tos or plac@@ ebo for up to 3,5 years . &quot;
&quot; in studies , the concentration of a substance in the blood ( gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in , H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) was measured , indicating how well the blood sugar is set . &quot;
&quot; Ac@@ tos led to lowering the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c value , suggest@@ ing that blood sugar levels were reduced by 15 mg , 30 mg and 45 mg . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the tri@@ ple@@ therapy trial , the effect of the additional administration of Ac@@ tos on the existing treatment with met@@ form@@ in and a sul@@ fon@@ yl@@ ated substance showed a decrease in H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c values by 0.@@ 94 % while the additional offering of plac@@ ebo led to a reduction of 0.@@ 35 % . &quot;
&quot; in a small study where the combination of ac@@ tos and ins@@ ulin was investigated in 289 patients , patients receiving accounts in addition to ins@@ ulin showed a decrease in the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c values of 0.@@ 69 % after 6 months compared to 0.@@ 14 % in the patients receiving plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects associated with Ac@@ tos were vision distur@@ bances , upper respiratory tract infections ( col@@ ds ) , weight gain and hypo@@ es@@ thes@@ ia ( reduced sensitivity to stimul@@ i ) . &quot;
&quot; Ac@@ tos can neither be used in patients who may possibly be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one or any of the other ingredients , or in patients with liver problems , heart failure , or di@@ ab@@ etic k@@ eto@@ aci@@ dosis ( high level of ket@@ ones - acid levels - in the blood ) . &quot;
it has been decided that Ac@@ tos will serve as an alternative to the standard treatment with met@@ form@@ in in patients where met@@ form@@ in is not displayed .
&quot; October 2000 , the European Commission announced the tak@@ eover of Ac@@ tos in the entire European Union to the tak@@ eda Europe R &amp; D Centre Limited . &quot;
&quot; the tablets are white to whi@@ tish , round , arch@@ ed and apply on one side the mark &quot; 15 &quot; and on the other side the in@@ scription &quot; Ac@@ tos . &quot; &quot;
pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one is also indicated for the combination with ins@@ ulin in patients with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus whose blood sugar is in@@ adequate with ins@@ ulin and is un@@ suitable for met@@ form@@ in due to contra@@ indications or int@@ oler@@ ance ( see Section 4.4 ) .
&quot; no data is available for the use of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one in patients under 18 years of age , so the application in this age group is not recommended . &quot;
&quot; in patients who are endanger@@ ed by the presence of at least one risk factor ( e.g. earlier heart attack or sy@@ mpt@@ om@@ atic cor@@ on@@ ary heart disease ) , the doctor should start treatment with the lowest available dose and increase the dose gradually . &quot;
&quot; patients should be observed on signs and symptoms of heart failure , weight gain or ede@@ ma , especially those with reduced cardi@@ ac reserve . &quot;
&quot; patients should be observed on signs and symptoms of heart failure , weight gain and ede@@ ma when pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one is used in combination with ins@@ ulin . &quot;
a cardiovascular outcome study with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one in patients under 75 years with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and pre @-@ existing advanced macro@@ v@@ ascular disease has been performed .
&quot; this study showed an increase in in@@ suffici@@ ency reports , which did not lead to an increase in mort@@ ality in the study . &quot;
&quot; in patients with increased output liver enzymes ( AL@@ T &gt; 2,5 x upper limit of the standard range ) or with other signs of liver disease , pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one may not be used . &quot;
&quot; if the AL@@ T mirror is increased up to 3 times the upper limit of the standard range , the liver enzymes can be re @-@ controlled as soon as possible . &quot;
&quot; if a patient develops symptoms that point to a h@@ ep@@ atic dysfunction , such as un@@ explained nau@@ sea , vom@@ iting , upper stomach complaint , fatigue , loss of appetite and / or dar@@ ker urine , the liver enzymes are to be checked . &quot;
&quot; the decision , whether the treatment of the patient is continued with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one , should be led to the prevention of laboratory parameters from clinical assessment . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one , a dose @-@ dependent weight gain has been detected that can be f@@ aded by fatty deposits and in some cases linked to a fluid retention . &quot;
&quot; as a result of hem@@ odi@@ lution , a minor reduction of the medium hem@@ og@@ lob@@ binary values ( relative reduction by 4 % ) and hem@@ at@@ oc@@ r@@ its ( relative reduction by 4.1 % ) occurred under the treatment with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on . &quot;
similar changes were observed in compar@@ ative controlled trials with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one in patients taking met@@ form@@ in ( relative reduction in hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in by 3 @-@ 4 % and the hem@@ at@@ oc@@ r@@ its by 1 @-@ 2 % and hem@@ at@@ oc@@ r@@ its by 1 @-@ 3.2 % ) .
&quot; as a result of increased ins@@ ulin sensitivity , in patients who receive pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one as oral bi@@ al or triple Combin@@ ation Therapy with a sul@@ fon@@ yl@@ us or as a secondary combination therapy with ins@@ ulin , the risk of dose @-@ dependent hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia . &quot;
&quot; after the launch was reported under the treatment with thi@@ az@@ oli@@ da@@ indi@@ a , including Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one , about a occurrence or deteri@@ oration of a di@@ ab@@ etic mac@@ ular ede@@ ma with a reduction in visual acu@@ ity . &quot;
&quot; it is un@@ clear whether there is a direct connection between the intake of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one and the occurrence of mac@@ ular ede@@ ma , but prescribed doctors should be aware of the possibility of mac@@ ular ede@@ ma when patients report interference of visual acu@@ ity ; an appropriate oph@@ thalm@@ ological examination should be considered . &quot;
&quot; in a summary analysis of messages of adverse events regarding bone frac@@ tures from random@@ ized , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3,5 years with more than 8.@@ 100 patients treated with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one &quot;
&quot; frac@@ tured frac@@ tures were 1.9 frac@@ tures per 100 patient @-@ years in the women treated with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on and 1.1 frac@@ tures per 100 patients , which were treated with a compar@@ ative medication . &quot;
&quot; in the Pro@@ active study , a study of 3.5 years for the study of cardiovascular events , frac@@ tures occurred at 44 / 870 ( 5.1 % ; 1.0 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) compared to 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ; 0.5 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) in patients treated with compar@@ ative medication . &quot;
&quot; patients should be aware of the possibility of a pregnancy , and if a patient wishes a pregnancy or this occurs , the treatment should be disabled ( see Section 4.6 ) . &quot;
&quot; studies on the investigation of the interactions have shown that pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one does not exercise relevant effects on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics or drug dynamics of di@@ go@@ x@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , phen@@ proc@@ ou@@ mon and met@@ form@@ in . &quot;
&quot; interactions with drugs that are met@@ ab@@ oli@@ zed by these enzymes , e.g. oral contra@@ cep@@ tive pills , cy@@ clos@@ por@@ in , calcium channel blo@@ ckers and H@@ M@@ G@@ Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors are not expected . &quot;
the simultaneous application of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one with Gem@@ fibro@@ zi@@ l ( a Cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8@@ - In@@ hibit@@ or ) resulted in an increase in the AU@@ C of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one by 3 times .
the simultaneous use of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one with ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a Cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C8 induc@@ tor ) results in a decrease of the AU@@ C of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one by 54 % .
this is due to the fact that under treatment with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one the resulting hyper@@ ins@@ ul@@ in@@ emia and increased ins@@ ulin resistance of the mother animal decre@@ ases and thus reduces the availability of the met@@ abolic sub@@ str@@ ates for the fet@@ al growth .
&quot; frequently &gt; 1 / 10 ; frequently &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ; occasionally &gt; 1 / 1000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ; rare &gt; 1 / 10000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ; very rare &lt; 1 / 10000 , individual cases : unknown ( not estimated from this data ) . &quot;
&quot; these lead to a temporary alter@@ ation of the tur@@ g@@ or and the refra@@ ctive index of the lens , as observed in other hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ em@@ ic agents . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one , AL@@ T recei@@ pts also frequently appeared on the triple of the upper limit of the norm range , however less often than in comparison groups under met@@ form@@ in or sul@@ fon@@ yl@@ har@@ n@@ stoff . &quot;
&quot; in an Out@@ come study in patients with advanced macro@@ sc@@ ascular disease , the frequency of severe heart failure under Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one was 1.6 % higher than under plac@@ ebo if Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one res@@ p . &quot;
&quot; since market launch has rarely been reported on heart failure under Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one , however , when pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one was used in combination with ins@@ ulin or in patients with heart failure in an@@ am@@ n@@ ese . &quot;
&quot; a summary analysis of messages of adverse events regarding bone frac@@ tures from random@@ ized , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3,5 years with over 8,@@ 100 patients in the groups treated with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on and over 7,@@ 400 patients in the groups treated with compar@@ ative medication . &quot;
&quot; in the Pro@@ active study period of 3.5 years , frac@@ tures occurred at 44 / 870 ( 5.1 % ) of patients treated with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on , compared to 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ) in patients treated with compar@@ ative medication . &quot;
&quot; when taking the reported maximum dose of 120 mg / day over four days , then 180 mg / day over seven days did not appear any symptoms . &quot;
&quot; Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on seems to have an activation of specific nuclear rec@@ ept@@ ors ( Per@@ ox@@ is@@ ome prolifer@@ ator @-@ activated Rec@@ ep@@ tor @-@ γ ( PP@@ AR @-@ γ ) ) , leading to increased ins@@ ulin sensitivity of liver , fat and skel@@ etal muscle cells . &quot;
it could be shown that pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one reduces glu@@ cos@@ al production in the liver and increasing periph@@ eral glucose utilisation in the case of ins@@ ulin resistance .
a clinical study with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on versus G@@ lic@@ la@@ zi@@ de as mon@@ otherapy was continued over two years in order to investigate the time to dis@@ continue the therapeutic effect ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ≥ 8.0 % after the first 6 months of treatment ) .
&quot; at the time after two years after the beginning of the therapy , a blood glucose control ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c &lt; 8.0 % ) could be maintained by pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one at 69 % of the treated patients ( compared to 50 % of the patients under G@@ lic@@ la@@ zi@@ d ) . &quot;
&quot; in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled trial for 12 months , patients whose blood sugar was in@@ adequate despite three months of optimization with ins@@ ulin was random@@ ised to pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one or plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in patients suffering from Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one , the average H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c was reduced by 0.@@ 45 % compared to the patients receiving ins@@ ulin ; a reduction in the dose of ins@@ ulin in the group treated with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one was observed . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials over a year , there was a statisti@@ cally significant decrease of the alb@@ um@@ in / cre@@ atin@@ ine quot@@ i@@ ent compared to the initial values . &quot;
the effect of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one ( mon@@ otherapy with 45 mg versus plac@@ ebo ) was tested in a small study of type 2 di@@ ab@@ etic patients in a small group of 18 weeks .
&quot; in most clinical trials , compared to plac@@ ebo , a reduction of the total plasma tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de and free fatty acids and an increase in HD@@ L@@ - cholesterol levels as well as slightly , clin@@ ically not significantly increased L@@ DL cholesterol levels were observed . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials over a period of up to two years , pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one decreased compared to plac@@ ebo , met@@ form@@ ine or g@@ lic@@ la@@ zi@@ de the total plas@@ mat@@ ri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de and free fatty acids and increased the HD@@ L cholesterol levels . &quot;
&quot; compared to plac@@ ebo , there was no statisti@@ cally significant increase in L@@ DL cholesterol levels under Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on , while met@@ form@@ in and G@@ lic@@ la@@ zi@@ d were observed . &quot;
&quot; in a study more than 20 weeks , Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one reduced not only the N@@ ü@@ chtern @-@ tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des , but also improved the post @-@ p@@ ran@@ dial increased tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de levels , as well as the tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de absorption as well as the h@@ ep@@ atic tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de synthesis . &quot;
&quot; in the Pro@@ active study , a cardiovascular outcome study , 5@@ 238 patients with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and pre @-@ existing advanced macro@@ ascular disease were random@@ ised in groups that received over a period of up to 3.5 years in addition to existing anti@@ di@@ ab@@ etic and cardiovascular therapy either pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one or plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; according to oral application , Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one is quickly res@@ or@@ ded , whereby the peak concentration of un@@ modified pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one in plasma is usually achieved 2 hours after application . &quot;
&quot; on this basis , the contribution of M @-@ IV corresponds to the effectiveness of the three times the effectiveness of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one , whereas the relative efficacy of M @-@ II is minimal . &quot;
&quot; in interaction studies , Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one has no relevant effect on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics or drug dynamics of di@@ go@@ x@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , phen@@ proc@@ ou@@ mon and met@@ form@@ in . &quot;
the simultaneous application of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one with Gem@@ fibro@@ zi@@ l ( a Cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8@@ - In@@ hibit@@ or ) or with Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a Cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C8 induc@@ tor ) increases or lowers the plasma concentration of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one ( see Section 4.5 ) .
&quot; following oral application of radio@@ active pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one in humans , the marker was found mainly in the case ( 55 % ) and to a less@@ er extent in the urine ( 45 % ) . &quot;
&quot; the average plasma elim@@ ination period of un@@ modified pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one amounts to 5 @-@ 6 hours , and all active metabol@@ ites are 16 - 23 hours . &quot;
&quot; the plasma concentrations of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one and its metabol@@ ites are lower in patients with reduced kidney function than for healthy subjects , but the rates of the oral clearance of the parent substance however res@@ emble themselves . &quot;
&quot; in toxic@@ ology studies occurred in mice , rats , dogs and monkeys after repeated administration of plasma volume enlargement with hem@@ odi@@ lution , an@@ emia and rever@@ sible ec@@ cent@@ ric hyper@@ tro@@ phy . &quot;
this is due to the fact that under treatment with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one the resulting hyper@@ ins@@ ul@@ in@@ emia and increased ins@@ ulin resistance of the mother animal decre@@ ases and thus reduces the availability of the met@@ abolic sub@@ str@@ ates for the fet@@ al growth .
long @-@ term studies ( up to 2 years ) induced increased inci@@ den@@ ces of hyper@@ pla@@ sia ( in male and female rats ) and tum@@ ours ( in male rats ) of the ur@@ inary bladder .
in an animal model of the family aden@@ omat@@ ous Poly@@ posi@@ s ( FA@@ P ) the treatment with two other thi@@ az@@ oli@@ d@@ index@@ s resulted in increased inci@@ dence of col@@ ont@@ al tum@@ ors .
&quot; the tablets are white to whi@@ tish , round , flat and apply on one side the mark &quot; &quot; 30 &quot; &quot; and on the other side the in@@ scription &quot; &quot; Ac@@ tos . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; frac@@ tured frac@@ tures were 1.9 frac@@ tures per 100 patient @-@ years in the women treated with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on and 1.1 frac@@ tures per 100 patients , which were treated with a compar@@ ative medication . &quot;
&quot; in the Pro@@ active study , a study of 3.5 years for the study of cardiovascular events , frac@@ tures occurred at 44 / 870 ( 5.1 % ; 1.0 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) compared to 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ; 0.5 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) in patients treated with compar@@ ative medication . &quot;
&quot; in another study over two years , the effects of a combination therapy of met@@ form@@ in were studied in each case with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one or g@@ lic@@ la@@ zi@@ d . &quot;
clinical trials over one year showed a statisti@@ cally significant decrease of the alb@@ um@@ in / cre@@ atin@@ ine quot@@ i@@ ent compared to the initial values .
&quot; in a study more than 20 weeks , Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one reduced not only the N@@ ü@@ chtern @-@ tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des , but also improved the post@@ p@@ ran@@ dial increased tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de levels , this both through an effect on tr@@ y@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de absorption as well as the h@@ ep@@ atic tr@@ y@@ g@@ liz@@ eri@@ de synthesis . &quot;
&quot; although the study lack@@ ed the objective of its primary end@@ point , which was a combination of total mort@@ ality , non @-@ fatal m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction , stroke , acute cor@@ on@@ ary syn@@ drom , leg amp@@ utation over the ank@@ le , cor@@ on@@ ary vas@@ cul@@ ar@@ isation and vas@@ cul@@ ari@@ zation of the leg arter@@ ies , the results suggest that no cardiovascular long @-@ term risks are associated with taking Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on . &quot;
&quot; the tablets are white to whi@@ tish , round , flat and apply on one side the mark &quot; 45 &quot; and on the other side the in@@ scription &quot; Ac@@ tos . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in a summary analysis of messages of adverse events relating to bone frac@@ tures from random@@ ized , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3,5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients receiving treatment medi@@ ation showed an increased inci@@ dence of bone frac@@ tures in women . &quot;
&quot; in the Pro@@ active study , a study of 3.5 years for the study of cardiovascular events , frac@@ tures occurred at 44 / 870 ( 5.1 % ; 1.0 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) compared to 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ; 0.5 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) in patients treated with compar@@ ative medication . &quot;
&quot; in a study more than 20 weeks , Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one reduced not only the N@@ ü@@ chtern @-@ tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des , but also improved the post@@ p@@ ran@@ dial increased tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de levels , this both with an effect on tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de absorption as well as the h@@ ep@@ atic tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de synthesis . &quot;

Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane is normally applied once or twice a day if a quick initial effect is desired along with a longer lasting effect .

&quot; Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane was studied in 294 patients with type 1 diabetes , in which the pancre@@ as cannot produce ins@@ ulin , and type 2 diabetes , in which the body is unable to use the ins@@ ulin effectively . &quot;
after 12 weeks the concentration of a substance ( gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) was measured which indicates how well the blood sugar is adjusted .
&quot; Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane led to a decrease in the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c mirror , suggest@@ ing that blood sugar levels were similarly lo@@ wered by another human ins@@ ulin . &quot;
Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane should not be applied to patients who may possibly be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to human ins@@ ulin ( r@@ DNA ) or any of the other ingredients .
&quot; in addition , the dos@@ es of Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane may need to be adjusted if it is ad@@ ministered together with a number of other medicines that can affect blood sugar ( the complete list is to be found in the package insert ) . &quot;
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane benefits out@@ wei@@ gh the risks in the treatment of diabetes .
&quot; October 2002 , the European Commission granted the company Nov@@ o Nor@@ disk A / S appro@@ ving Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane in the entire European Union . &quot;
pre@@ mixed ins@@ ulin products are normally applied once or twice a day if a quick initial effect is desired along with a longer lasting effect .
injection needle must be left under the skin for at least 6 seconds to ensure that the entire dose was inj@@ ected .
&quot; for example , patients whose blood sugar is significantly improved by means of an intensi@@ fied ins@@ ulin therapy , the hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia warning symptoms can be perceived and should be advised accordingly . &quot;
&quot; any change with regard to strength , brand ( manufacturer ) , ins@@ ulin type ( fast acting , bi@@ polar , long acting ins@@ ulin , human ins@@ ulin or ins@@ ulin analog ) and / or production method ( through re@@ combin@@ ant DNA to ins@@ ulin @-@ animal origin ) may cause a change in dosage . &quot;
&quot; if a dose adjustment is necessary when switching to Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane in the patient , it may be necessary during the first dose or during the first weeks or months after the conversion . &quot;
&quot; some patients in which hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic reactions occurred after a change of animal to human ins@@ ulin , reported that the early warning symptoms of hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia were less pronounced or different than with their previous ins@@ ulin . &quot;
&quot; when travelling over several time zones , the patient should be advised to take the advice of his physician , as such journeys may cause ins@@ ulin and meals to be used or taken at other times . &quot;
&quot; therefore , the doctor needs to consider possible interactions in the therapy and ask his patients to ask for medicines that are consumed by them . &quot;

&quot; however , hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia can develop gradually : • Easy hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ em@@ ias can be treated by oral intake of glucose or sug@@ ary foods . &quot;
&quot; di@@ abe@@ tics should therefore always have grape vines , swe@@ ets , bis@@ cu@@ its , or sug@@ ary fruit juice . • Heavy hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ em@@ ias with un@@ consciousness are treated with an in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of glu@@ c@@ agon ( 0.5 to 1.0 mg ) by means of an in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of glucose which is given intra@@ ven@@ ously by the doctor . &quot;
&quot; the effect begins within half an hour , the active maximum is reached within 2 to 8 hours and the entire duration of the operation is up to 24 hours . &quot;
the res@@ or@@ ption profile is based on the fact that the product is a mixture of ins@@ ulin products with fast or delayed res@@ or@@ ption .

&quot; in addition , the dos@@ es of Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id must be adjusted if it is ad@@ ministered together with a number of other medicines that can affect blood sugar . &quot;
&quot; October 2002 , the European Commission granted the company Nov@@ o Nor@@ disk A / S appro@@ ving Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id for the entire European Union . &quot;
&quot; when two types of ins@@ ulin are mixed , the amount of ins@@ ulin has to be absorbed first , then the amount of ins@@ ulin that is long acting . &quot;
&quot; 3 If a dose adjustment is necessary when changing to Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id , it may be necessary during the first dose or during the first weeks or months after the conversion . &quot;
&quot; when travelling over several time zones , the patient should be advised to take the advice of his physician , as such journeys may cause ins@@ ulin and meals to be used or taken at other times . &quot;

&quot; A@@ den@@ ur@@ ic is used in patients who have already signs of cryst@@ all@@ isation , including arthritis ( pain and inflammation in joints ) or lymp@@ h no@@ des ( &quot; &quot; stones &quot; &quot; i.e. larger ur@@ at@@ crystalline deposits which can lead to joint and bone damage ) . &quot;
&quot; if the ur@@ ic acid level is still more than 6 mg per dec@@ il@@ iter after two to four weeks , the dose can be increased to 120 mg once a day . &quot;
&quot; during the first treatment months , rheum@@ atism may still occur ; therefore , it is recommended that patients continue to use A@@ den@@ ur@@ ic for at least six months to prevent rheum@@ atism . &quot;
the drug is not recommended in children and in patients who had an organ transplan@@ t as it was not studied for these groups .
&quot; in the first study involving 1 0@@ 72 patients , the effectiveness of three different aden@@ ur@@ ic dos@@ ages ( once daily 80 , 120 and 240 mg ) was compared to plac@@ ebo ( spot@@ ted medi@@ cam@@ ents ) and Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( another drug for the treatment of hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ emia ) . &quot;
&quot; in the second study , two dos@@ es of A@@ den@@ ur@@ ic ( once daily 80 and 120 mg ) were compared to 7@@ 62 patients each with Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol . &quot;
&quot; in both studies , Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol was used in a dose of once daily 300 mg ; patients with kidney problems received only 100 mg a day . &quot;
the main indicator for the efficacy was the number of patients whose ur@@ ic acid levels were in the blood for the last three measurements below 6 mg / dl .
&quot; in the first study , 48 % ( 126 of 262 ) of patients who received A@@ den@@ ur@@ ic in a dose of once daily 80 mg , and 65 % ( 175 of 269 ) of patients once daily received 120 mg , in the last three measurements a ur@@ ic acid level in the blood of below 6 mg / dl . &quot;
&quot; compared to this , this was 22 % ( 60 of 268 ) of patients under Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol and in none of the 134 patients taking plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of A@@ den@@ ur@@ ic ( observed in 1 to 10 out of 100 patients ) are head@@ aches , di@@ arr@@ ho@@ ea , nau@@ sea ( nau@@ sea ) , skin r@@ ash and abnormal liver values . &quot;
&quot; in particular in patients with heart complaints in pre @-@ history , there may be an increased risk of certain side effects that affect the heart and blood vessels . &quot;
&quot; the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that A@@ den@@ ur@@ ic was more effective in the blood of ur@@ ic acid in the blood than allo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol , but also a higher risk of side @-@ effects related to the heart and blood vessels . &quot;
treatment of chronic hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ a@@ emia in diseases which have already led to prim@@ eval deposits ( including one out of the patient &apos;s history known or currently present po@@ ison@@ ing and / or arthritis ) .
&quot; if the ser@@ um acid level is still &gt; 6 mg / dl ( 357 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) after 2 @-@ 4 weeks ( 357 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) , a dose increase on A@@ DEN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 120 mg 1 x can be considered daily . &quot;
&quot; in patients with severe kidney function restriction , efficacy and safety have not been fully investigated ( Kre@@ atin@@ ine Clear@@ ance &lt; 30 ml / min , see Section 5.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; since children and adol@@ esc@@ ents have no experience , the application of Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at in this group of patients is not recommended . &quot;
&quot; since organ transplan@@ t recipients have no experience in organ transplan@@ t recipients , the application of Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at in this group of patients is not recommended ( see Section 5.1 ) . &quot;
cardiovascular disease In patients with isch@@ em@@ ic heart disease or de@@ compens@@ ated heart failure treatment with Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at is not recommended ( see Section 4.8 ) .
&quot; as with other har@@ n@@ sow@@ ing drugs , it may occur during the treatment commen@@ ced by acute g@@ out attack , because the lowering of the ser@@ um har@@ dening pi@@ eg@@ els initially can be mobil@@ ised in the tissue . &quot;
&quot; for mal@@ ign@@ ant diseases and their treatment , Les@@ ch@@ - Ny@@ han syndrome ) the absolute concentration of X@@ an@@ thin in the urine in rare cases increases so far that it comes to a de@@ position in the ur@@ inary tract . &quot;
&quot; during Phase 3 clinical trials , light ab@@ norm@@ alities of liver function were observed in patients treated with Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at ( 3.5 % ) . &quot;
it is therefore recommended to perform a liver function test prior to the start of the Feb@@ ux@@ o treatment and in the further course depending on clinical findings ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the@@ ophy@@ l@@ line Z@@ n did not have any interaction studies on Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at but it is known that the X@@ O in@@ hibition may lead to an increase in the@@ ophy@@ ll lens ( a in@@ hibition of the metabolism of the@@ ophy@@ l@@ line was also reported for other X@@ O inhibit@@ ors ) .
&quot; in subjects , the simultaneous administration of Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at and nap@@ ro@@ xen is 250 mg twice daily associated with an increase in the capital ex@@ position ( C@@ max 28 % , AU@@ C 41 % and t@@ 1 / 2 26 % ) . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials , the application of nap@@ ro@@ xen or other N@@ SA@@ R / Co@@ x @-@ 2 inhibit@@ ors was not related to a clin@@ ically significant increase in adverse events . &quot;
&quot; col@@ chic@@ ine / In@@ dom@@ et@@ ac@@ in / Hydro@@ chlor@@ thi@@ azi@@ de / War@@ far@@ in Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at can be used together with col@@ chic@@ ine or In@@ dom@@ et@@ ac@@ in , without a dose adjustment for Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at or the other active ingredient required at the same time . &quot;
&quot; in a study involving subjects , 120 mg A@@ DEN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 1 x daily a mean 22 % increase in the AU@@ C of Des@@ i@@ pr@@ amine , a C@@ YP@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 sub@@ strate , which indicates a possible weak inhibit@@ ory effect of Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at to the C@@ YP@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 enzyme in vi@@ vo . &quot;
&quot; an@@ ta@@ zi@@ da It could be shown that the simultaneous intake of an ant@@ acids containing magnesium hydro@@ xi@@ de and aluminum hydro@@ xi@@ de is delayed and a decrease in the C@@ max by 32 % , however no significant change in the AU@@ C . &quot;
pregnancy data about a very limited number of exposed pregn@@ ancies can not close to the side effects of Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at on pregnancy or the health of fet@@ us / new@@ bor@@ ns .
&quot; animal experimental studies do not imp@@ ly harmful effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development or birth ( see Section 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; patients should be cau@@ tious when controlling a vehicle , operating machinery or exercise of dangerous activities until they can reasonably be sure that A@@ DEN@@ U@@ RI@@ C does not adver@@ sely affect their performance . &quot;
&quot; a numer@@ ically higher inci@@ dence of cardiovascular events reported by exam@@ in@@ ers was observed in the overall figure of the Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol group in the Pi@@ vot@@ al Study of Phase 3 ( 1,3 vs. 0,3 Events per 100 patient years ) , although no statisti@@ cally significant differences were found and no caus@@ al connection with Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at could be detected . &quot;
the risk factors determined in these patients were arter@@ ios@@ clerosis and / or a m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction or a de@@ compression heart failure in the case of medical history .
&quot; frequent ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasional ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 to &lt; 1 / 100 ) and rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 to &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) side effects that could stand in the treatment groups with 80 mg / 120 mg Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at and which were reported in all Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at treatment groups more than once , are listed below . &quot;
&quot; di@@ arr@@ ho@@ ea , nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting are more common in patients who are simultaneously treated with col@@ chic@@ ine . * * In clinical trials no severe skin r@@ ashes or severe hyper@@ sensitivity reactions were observed . &quot;
&quot; 7 Open long @-@ term extension studies In the open long @-@ term extension studies , 906 patients were treated for up to 1 year , 322 patients up to 2 years long , 57 patients up to 3 years long and 53 patients for up to 4 years with Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at 80 mg / 120 mg . &quot;
the events related to treatment reported during the long @-@ term and longer @-@ term studies were similar to those reported in Phase 3 studies ( see Table 1 ) .
&quot; the following treatment @-@ related events were reported more than once in all Feb@@ ux@@ o@@ stat@@ s treatment groups and occurred in patients who received Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at 80 mg / 120 mg in long @-@ term compar@@ ative studies ( up to 4 years with an exposure time of &gt; 1,@@ 900 patient years ) , according to the information occasionally . &quot;
the following treatment @-@ related events were either not reported at all in the pi@@ vot@@ al studies of phase 3 for these dos@@ es either at all or with a lower frequency :
&quot; diabetes , hyper@@ li@@ pi@@ de@@ mia , in@@ som@@ nia , hyp@@ er thes@@ ia , show@@ y EC@@ G , cou@@ gh , short at@@ m@@ acy , skin disc@@ ol@@ oration , skin les@@ ions , les@@ ions , ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency , erectile dysfunction , increase in lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ te number , decrease in the number of white blood cells . &quot;
active mechanism of ur@@ ic acid is the final product of the pur@@ in@@ metabolism in humans and arises within the framework of the reaction vessel Hy@@ po@@ x@@ an@@ thin → X@@ an@@ thin → ure@@ a acid .
&quot; Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at is a powerful , non @-@ pur@@ ine @-@ sel@@ ective inhibit@@ or of the X@@ O ( NP @-@ SI@@ x@@ O ) with a K@@ i @-@ value for the in vit@@ ro @-@ in@@ hibition that is located below the nan@@ om@@ ol@@ ar range . &quot;
&quot; clinical study results The efficacy of A@@ DEN@@ U@@ RI@@ C was shown in two pi@@ vot@@ al studies of phase 3 ( AP@@ EX study and F@@ ACT study as described below ) , which were conducted with 1,8@@ 32 patients with hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ a@@ emia and g@@ out . &quot;
primary efficacy end@@ point was in each study the proportion of patients in which the last three per month specific Ser@@ um acid levels were &lt; 6.0 mg / dl ( 357 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
&quot; plac@@ ebo ( n = 134 ) , A@@ DEN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 80 mg 1 x daily ( n = 267 ) , A@@ DEN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 120 mg 1 x daily ( n = 134 ) , A@@ DEN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 240 mg 1 x daily ( n = 134 ) or Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg 1 x daily ( n = 10 ) for patients with a ser@@ um cre@@ atin@@ ine value to study beginning of &gt; 1.5 mg / dl and ≤ 2,0 mg / dl . &quot;
the AP@@ EX study showed a statisti@@ cally significant su@@ peri@@ ority of the treatment with A@@ DEN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 80 mg 1 x daily compared with A@@ DEN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 120 mg 1 x daily compared to the treatment with commonly used dos@@ es of Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg ( n = 258 ) / 100 mg ( n = 10 ) .
the F@@ ACT study showed the statisti@@ cally significant su@@ peri@@ ority of the treatment with A@@ DEN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 80 mg 1 x daily as well as with A@@ DEN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 120 mg 1 x daily compared to the traditional dose Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg .
&quot; patients with ser@@ um cre@@ ase values &gt; 1.5 and ≤ 2,0 mg / dl ) or 300 mg 1 x daily ( n = 509 ) were combined for the analysis . * p &lt; 0.0@@ 01 versus Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol , # p &lt; 0.0@@ 01 versus 80 mg &quot;
&quot; the lowering of the ser@@ um acid level on &lt; 6,0 mg / dl ( 357 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) was observed during the medical visit in week 2 and maintained over the entire course of treatment . &quot;
509 patients received Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg 1 x daily ; 10 patients with ser@@ um cre@@ ase values &gt; 1.5 and &lt; 2.0 mg / dl received 100 mg 1 x daily .
primary end@@ point in the sub@@ group of patients with kidney function restriction The AP@@ EX study evaluated the efficacy in 40 patients with kidney function restriction ( d . h ) .
&quot; with A@@ DEN@@ U@@ RI@@ C , the primary efficacy end@@ point was 44 % ( 80 mg 1 x daily ) , 45 % ( 120 mg 1 x daily ) and 60 % ( 240 mg 1 x daily ) of patients . &quot;
&quot; there were no clin@@ ically significant differences in the percentage of ser@@ um acid concentrations in subjects , regardless of their kidney function ( 58 % in the group with normal kidney function and 55 % in the group with severe kidney function disorders ) . &quot;
primary end@@ point in the sub@@ group of patients with ser@@ um acid concentrations ≥ 10 mg / dl Et@@ wa 40 % of the patients ( AP@@ EX and F@@ ACT study ) had a ser@@ um har@@ ness concentration of ≥ 10 mg / dl .
&quot; the data collected in two years of the open extension study of Phase 3 showed that a decrease in the rate of ser@@ um acid satur@@ ation was reduced to &lt; 6 mg / dl ( &lt; 357 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) , so that less than 3 % of the patients required a treatment against g@@ out delay in the months 16 @-@ 24 ( i.e. more than 97 % of the patients required no treatment against a g@@ out ) . &quot;
&quot; this was associated with a reduction in the note size , resulting in 54 % of patients a complete dis@@ appearance of the g@@ out notes by month 24 . &quot;
&quot; increased T@@ SH@@ - values ( &gt; 5.5 µ@@ s / ml ) were observed in patients receiving a long @-@ term treatment with Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at ( 5.0 % ) , and in patients who received Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( 5.8 % ) in the open long @-@ term compar@@ ative studies ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; in healthy subjects , the maximum plasma concentrations ( C@@ max ) and the surface under the plasma concentration time curve ( AU@@ C ) increased from Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at by administration of simple and multiple dos@@ es of 10 mg to 120 mg dos@@ is@@ proportional . &quot;
dos@@ es between 120 mg and 300 mg is observed for Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at an increase in AU@@ C that is larger than the dose @-@ proportional increase .
&quot; after taking easier or multiple oral dos@@ es of 80 and 120 mg 1 x daily , the C@@ max is about 2.8 @-@ 3.2 µ@@ g / ml and 5.0 @-@ 5.3 µ@@ g / ml . &quot;
&quot; however , no clin@@ ically significant change was observed in the percentage decrease in the ser@@ um acid concentrations , if this was checked ( multiple dos@@ es of 80 mg ) . &quot;
distribution The apparent Ste@@ ady @-@ state distribution volume ( V@@ pp / F ) of Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at is between 29 and 75 litres after intake of dos@@ es of 10 @-@ 300 mg .
the plasma era@@ dic@@ ation of Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at amounts to approximately 99.@@ 2 % ( primary bond to alb@@ um@@ in ) and is constant over the concentration width achieved with dos@@ es of 80 and 120 mg .
&quot; in vit@@ ro studies in human liver enzymes , these oxid@@ ative metabol@@ ites are mainly formed by C@@ YP@@ 1@@ A1 , C@@ YP@@ 2@@ C8 , C@@ YP@@ 2@@ C8 or C@@ YP@@ 2@@ C@@ 9 , and that Feb@@ ux@@ o@@ stat@@ glu@@ cur@@ on@@ id mainly comes from U@@ GT 1@@ A1 , 1@@ A8 and 1@@ A@@ 9 . &quot;

&quot; in addition to ex@@ cre@@ tion over the urine , approximately 45 % of the dose in the chair found itself as imm@@ utable Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at ( 12 % ) , acet@@ ate @-@ c@@ annab@@ ino@@ id of the active ingredient ( 1 % ) , its known oxid@@ ative metabol@@ ites and their con@@ ju@@ gate ( 25 % ) as well as other unknown metabol@@ ites ( 7 % ) . &quot;

these findings are seen as a result of a specific pur@@ in@@ metabolism and urine composition and considered not relevant for clinical use .
it was found that Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at has no effect on the fertility and reproduction performance of male and female rats in oral dos@@ es of up to 48 mg / kg / day .
&quot; mat@@ ernal toxic@@ ity occurred at high dos@@ es , which were about the 4 @-@ fold of the human therapeutic ex@@ position , accompanied by a reduction in the breeding performance and a develop@@ mental delay in the descendants of rats . &quot;
&quot; ter@@ at@@ ological studies in bearing rats with ex@@ positions which were about the 4.3 @-@ fold and in the carrying rab@@ bits with ex@@ positions which were about 13 times the human@@ ist exposure , did not take any ter@@ ato@@ genic effects . &quot;

primary efficacy end@@ point was in each study the proportion of patients in which the last three per month specific Ser@@ um acid levels were &lt; 6.0 mg / dl ( 357 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
&quot; the data collected in two years of the open extension study of Phase 3 showed that a decrease in the rate of ser@@ um acid satur@@ ation was reduced to &lt; 6 mg / dl ( &lt; 357 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) , so that less than 3 % of the patients required a treatment against g@@ out delay in the months 16 @-@ 24 ( i.e. more than 97 % of the patients required no treatment against a g@@ out ) . &quot;

&quot; AD@@ RO@@ VAN@@ CE is used for the treatment of oste@@ opor@@ osis ( a disease in which the bones are br@@ ittle ) in women after men@@ op@@ ause , where there is a risk of a low vitamin D mirror . &quot;
&quot; the patient must take the tablet with a full glass of water ( no mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before eating , drinking or taking other medicines ( including ant@@ acids , calcium and vitamin supplements ) . &quot;
&quot; in order to avoid irrit@@ ation of the o@@ es@@ oph@@ agus , the patient must not lie down until after the first food intake of the day , which should take place at the earliest 30 minutes after taking the tablet . &quot;
&quot; as al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate and vitamin D3 are already used separately from each other in medicines approved in the European Union , the company presented data from previous studies and published literature . &quot;
the company also conducted a study involving 35 men and 68@@ 2 post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women with oste@@ opor@@ osis in order to demonstrate the efficacy of AD@@ RO@@ VAN@@ CE regarding the increase in vitamin D levels .
&quot; after a 15 @-@ week treatment , the patient &apos;s share of low vitamin D in patients treated with AD@@ RO@@ VAN@@ CE was lower ( 11 % ) than those who took Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate alone ( 32 % ) . &quot;
the company also presented data that stated that the Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at dose contained in AD@@ RO@@ VAN@@ CE is exactly the dose required for preventing bone loss .
&quot; the most common side effects ( observed in 1 to 10 out of 100 patients ) are head@@ aches , pain of mus@@ cul@@ os@@ kel@@ etal system ( muscles , bones or joints ) and symptoms of the diges@@ tive apparatus like stomach pain , dy@@ sp@@ ep@@ sia ( di@@ arr@@ ho@@ ea ) , di@@ arr@@ ho@@ ea ( swal@@ lowing ) , driven abdom@@ en , dy@@ sph@@ ag@@ ia ( b@@ lower abdom@@ en ) as well as su@@ cking im@@ pulses . &quot;
&quot; in patients with any hyper@@ sensitivity ( allergy ) against Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate , vitamin D3 , or any of the other ingredients AD@@ RO@@ VAN@@ CE may not be applied . &quot;
&quot; it may not be used for diseases of es@@ oph@@ agus , in patients with hypo@@ cal@@ c@@ emia ( low calcium levels ) or in patients who can not stand or sit for at least 30 minutes . &quot;
&quot; Janu@@ ary@@ 2007 , the European Commission granted Mer@@ ck Shar@@ p &amp; Doh@@ me Ltd. to appro@@ ve AD@@ RO@@ VAN@@ CE on the entire European Union . &quot;
&quot; capsule form , white to broken white tablets , marked with the outline of a bone on one side and &quot; 710 &quot; on the other side . &quot;
&quot; AD@@ RO@@ VAN@@ CE is only available with water ( not with mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before the first food , drink or intake of medicines ( including ant@@ acids , calcium and vitamin supplements ) for the day . &quot;
follow these instructions carefully to reduce the risk of mal@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irrit@@ ation and associated side effects ( see Section 4.4 ) :
• AD@@ RO@@ VAN@@ CE should not be swal@@ lowed after rising up the day with a full glass of water ( at least 200 ml ) .
&quot; B. pep@@ tic ul@@ cer , active g@@ astro@@ intestinal ble@@ edings or surgical interventions in the upper Gast@@ ro@@ intestinal tract besides P@@ yl@@ or@@ op@@ last@@ y , only under special caution ( see Section 4.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al reactions , such as es@@ oph@@ ag@@ itis , es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al ul@@ cer@@ a and es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al ero@@ sions , rarely followed by es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al rop@@ es , were reported in patients taking Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate ( partially these were severe and required a hospital instruction ) . &quot;
&quot; this is why the doctor should pay attention to all signs and symptoms that refer to possible mal@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al reactions , and the patients should be pointed out when symptoms of op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irrit@@ ation like dy@@ sph@@ ag@@ ia , pain during swal@@ lowing or retro@@ stern@@ al pain or new or wor@@ sen@@ ing heart@@ burn burn the medicine and obtain medical advice ( see Section 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; 3 The risk of severe mal@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al side effects seems to be increased in patients who do not take the medicine properly and / or , after the occurrence of symptoms , refer to an es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irrit@@ ation . &quot;
it is very important that all dosage instructions are passed on to the patient and understood by the patient ( see section 4.2 ) .
&quot; during large @-@ scale clinical trials with al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate , no increased risk has been detected , rare ( after market launch ) stomach and du@@ oden@@ al ul@@ cer@@ a , among them some severe and with complications , reported ( see Section 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; oste@@ on@@ ec@@ sis of the jaw , usually associated with a tooth extraction and / or a local infection ( including oste@@ omyel@@ itis ) , was reported in cancer patients whose therapy regime mainly contains intra@@ ven@@ ously arranged bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; there are no data available , indicating whether to stop a bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate therapy in patients who require a s@@ lower surgical procedure to reduce the risk of oste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ sis of the jaw . &quot;
clinical assessment by the attending physician is decisive for the therapy planning for each patient on the basis of an individual benefit @-@ risk assessment .
patients should be instruc@@ ted that when taking a dose of AD@@ RO@@ VAN@@ CE the tablet should take the tablet in the next morning after having noticed their failure .
&quot; you should not take two tablets the same day , but take the intake of one tablet per week as originally planned on the intended week of the week . &quot;
&quot; other diseases , which affect the metabolism of minerals ( such as vitamin D deficiency and hyp@@ op@@ ar@@ ath@@ y@@ re@@ o@@ idi@@ smus ) , should also be adequ@@ ately treated prior to treatment with AD@@ RO@@ VAN@@ CE . &quot;
&quot; al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate foods and beverages ( including mineral water ) , calcium supplements , an@@ ta@@ zi@@ da and some oral medicines may affect the absorption of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate if taken at the same time . &quot;
&quot; therefore , after taking Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at , patients need to wait at least 30 minutes before taking other medicines ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 5.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; although specific interaction studies were not conducted , al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate was taken in clinical trials jointly with a variety of commonly prescribed medicines without clin@@ ically relevant interactions . &quot;
AD@@ RO@@ VAN@@ CE is intended for use in post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women and is therefore not applicable during pregnancy or lac@@ t@@ ating women .
&quot; animal studies with Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate do not indicate directly harmful effects with regard to pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al or post@@ nat@@ al development . &quot;
oste@@ on@@ nec@@ ro@@ sis of the jaw was reported in patients suffering from bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates ; most reports have been reported by cancer patients but was also reported in oste@@ opor@@ osis patients .
&quot; nevertheless , the ser@@ um calcium levels of up to &lt; 8.0 mg / dl ( 2.0 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and the ser@@ um phosph@@ ate up to ≤ 2,0 mg / dl ( 0.@@ 65 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) occurred in both treatment groups with similar frequency . &quot;
&quot; al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate intake of an oral over@@ dose can occur hypo@@ cal@@ c@@ emia , hyp@@ oph@@ osph@@ at@@ emia and side effects in the upper Gast@@ ro@@ intestinal tract such as stomach up@@ set , heart@@ burn , o@@ es@@ oph@@ ag@@ itis , ga@@ stri@@ tis or ul@@ cer@@ a . &quot;

&quot; the main effect of 1,@@ 25 @-@ D@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ xy@@ vitamin D3 is to increase the intestinal absorption of calcium and phosph@@ ate as well as the regulation of calcium and phosph@@ ate , the ren@@ al ex@@ cre@@ tion of calcium and phosph@@ ate , bone formation and bone res@@ or@@ ption . &quot;
&quot; in severe cases , a lack of secondary hyper@@ par@@ ath@@ y@@ re@@ o@@ idi@@ smus , hyp@@ oph@@ osph@@ at@@ emia , weakness of proxim@@ al mus@@ cul@@ ature and oste@@ om@@ al@@ az@@ ie and thus to a further increased risk of falls and oste@@ opor@@ osis may result in oste@@ opor@@ otic people . &quot;

&quot; after 15 @-@ week treatment , the average ser@@ um levels of 25 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ pro@@ vitamin D were significantly higher ( 26 % ) in the group under AD@@ RO@@ VAN@@ CE ( 70 mg / 2.@@ 800 I.@@ U. ) ( 56 n@@ mo@@ l / l &#91; 23 ng / ml &#93; ) than in the group under Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate alone ( 46 n@@ mo@@ l / l &#91; 18,@@ 2 ng / ml &#93; ) . &quot;
AD@@ RO@@ VAN@@ CE ( 70 mg / 2.@@ 800 I.@@ U. ) was reduced significantly after 15 weeks with vitamin D in@@ suffici@@ ency ( ser@@ um value of 25 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ pro@@ vitamin D &lt; 37.@@ 5 n@@ mo@@ l / l &#91; &lt; 15 ng / ml &#93; ) by 6@@ 2.5 % compared to al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate alone ( 12 % vs .

the effects of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate on bone mass and frac@@ tures in post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women were examined in two phase III studies of identical design ( n = 9@@ 44 ) as well as in the Fra@@ ktur @-@ Inter@@ ven@@ tions@@ - Study ( F@@ IT : n = 6.@@ 459 ) .
&quot; in Phase III studies , the average asc@@ ents of the BM@@ D combined with Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at 10 mg / day in relation to plac@@ ebo after 3 years 8.8 % on the spine , 5.@@ 9 % at the fem@@ ur and 7.8 % on the tro@@ chan@@ ter . &quot;
&quot; in the group treated with Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate , a reduction of 48 % ( al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate 3.2 % compared to plac@@ ebo 6,@@ 2 % ) was achieved in the share of patients with one or more vert@@ ebral frac@@ tures . &quot;
&quot; in the two @-@ year extension of these studies , the asc@@ ents of the BM@@ D of vert@@ ebral column and tro@@ chan@@ ter continued to maintain ; also the BM@@ D of the fem@@ oral neck and the entire body was maintained . &quot;
&quot; fit consisted of two plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled trials , where Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate has been taken daily ( 5 mg daily for 2 years and then 10 mg daily either over 1 or 2 years ) : &quot;
in this study the daily intake of Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate reduced the occurrence of at least one new vert@@ ebral fra@@ cture by 47 % ( al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate 7.9 % compared to plac@@ ebo 15.@@ 0 % ) .
&quot; res@@ or@@ ption Be@@ aches to an intra@@ ven@@ ous reference dose was the mean oral bio@@ availability of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate in women 0,@@ 64 % for dos@@ es between 5 and 70 mg after ni@@ ghtly fast@@ ings and two hours before receiving a standardized breakfast . &quot;
bio@@ availability declined accordingly to about 0.@@ 46 % and 0.@@ 39 % when Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate was taken one or half an hour before a standar@@ dised breakfast .
&quot; in oste@@ opor@@ osis studies , Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate was effective if it was taken at least 30 minutes before the first meal or drinking of the day . &quot;
&quot; in healthy subjects , the administration of oral pre@@ d@@ nis@@ one ( 20 mg three times a day over five days ) led to no clinical significant change in the oral bio@@ availability of Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at ( 20 % to 44 % ) . &quot;
&quot; 9 distribution studies in rats showed that Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate is temporarily distributed in past@@ oral tissue after intra@@ ven@@ ous gift of 1 mg / kg , but then quickly disper@@ sed into the bones or ex@@ cre@@ ted with the urine . &quot;
&quot; ex@@ cre@@ tion After intra@@ ven@@ ous administration of a single dose of 14@@ C @-@ al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate , approximately 50 % of the radio@@ active substance was ex@@ cre@@ ted within 72 hours with the urine and little or no radio@@ activity was found in the threads . &quot;
&quot; following intra@@ ven@@ ous administration of a single dose of 10 mg , the ren@@ al clearance of Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at 71 ml / min and system@@ ic Clear@@ ance exceeded 200 ml / min . &quot;
&quot; in rats , Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate is not ex@@ cre@@ ted by the aci@@ dic or bas@@ al transport system of the kid@@ neys , and therefore it is not assumed that it affects the ex@@ cre@@ tion of other drugs through these transport systems . &quot;

the mean maximum concentration in the ser@@ um ( C@@ max ) of vitamin D3 was 5.@@ 9 ng / ml and medi@@ an time to achieve the maximum level of ser@@ um concentration ( T@@ max ) 12 hours .
&quot; biot@@ ran@@ s@@ formation Vitamin D3 is quickly hydr@@ ated in the liver to 25 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ pro@@ vitamin D3 and then in the kidney to 1,@@ 25 @-@ D@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ xy@@ vitamin D3 , the bi@@ ologically active form , met@@ ab@@ oli@@ zed . &quot;
&quot; ex@@ cre@@ tion The average ex@@ cre@@ tion of radio@@ activity in the urine after 48 hours was 2.4 % , after 4 days 4.@@ 9 % . &quot;
&quot; characteristics in patients prec@@ lin@@ ical studies have shown that the proportion of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate , which is not depos@@ ited in bone , is rapidly ex@@ cre@@ ted over the urine . &quot;
&quot; although there are no clinical data about it , the ren@@ al elim@@ ination of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate as in the animal experiments is also reduced in patients with reduced kidney function . &quot;
&quot; therefore , in patients with reduced kidney function , a somewhat higher cum@@ ulation of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate can be expected in the bone ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot;

&quot; in addition , adult patients are ad@@ ministered to which a kidney or liver was transplan@@ ted to prevent rejection of the transplan@@ ted organ by the immune system . &quot;
&quot; since Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus and Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft are already in use in the EU , the company has presented the results from previously conducted studies with Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft as well as data from published literature . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the results of a clinical trial were presented to 6@@ 68 patients with kidney transplan@@ tation , whereas the application of Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft or C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in was compared . &quot;
&quot; the main indicator of the efficacy was the number of patients in which the transplan@@ tation was rep@@ elled after a treatment period of one year ( for example , exam@@ ining how often a renewed organ transplan@@ t or a recovery of di@@ aly@@ sis was required ) . &quot;
&quot; in addition , more recent studies have been carried out in 119 patients with kidney transplan@@ tation and 129 patients with liver transplan@@ tation and studied how Adv@@ agra@@ f is absorbed by the body compared to Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft . &quot;

&quot; in patients with any hyper@@ sensitivity ( allergy ) to tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , macro@@ li@@ de antibiotics ( such as ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin ) or any of the other ingredients may not be applied . &quot;
&quot; patients and doctors need to be cau@@ tious when others ( in particular some herbal ) medicines have to be taken at the same time , as the prescribed dose or the dose of the medication taken at the same time must be adjusted accordingly . &quot;

only doctors who are familiar with immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy and the treatment of transplan@@ t patients should prescri@@ be this drug or make changes in immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy .
&quot; because of clin@@ ically relevant differences in the system@@ ic exposure of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , this can lead to gra@@ ft rejection or an increased inci@@ dence of side effects , including under@@ - or over@@ immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression . &quot;
patients should always maintain the same tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus form@@ ulation and the corresponding daily dosage ; ren@@ ditions of form@@ ulation or regime should only be performed under the close monitoring of a physician experienced in the transplan@@ t ( see Sec@@ tions 4.4 and 4.8 ) .
&quot; as a result of switching to an alternative form@@ ulation , a therapeutic drug monitoring and appropriate dose adjustments must be performed to ensure that the system@@ ic exposure of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus remains . &quot;
the dosage of Adv@@ agra@@ f should be based primarily on the clinical assessment of rejection and toler@@ ability in individual cases and on blood @-@ level provisions ( see below &quot; Recom@@ mend@@ ations &quot; )
&quot; after switching from Pro@@ gra@@ f to Adv@@ agra@@ f , the tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus valley level should be insp@@ ected before the conversion and over two weeks of conversion . &quot;
&quot; on day 4 , system@@ ic exposure measured as tal@@ low , with both form@@ ulations similar to both ni@@ er@@ a- and liver transplan@@ ts . &quot;
careful and repeated checks of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus valley mirrors are recommended during the first two weeks after transplan@@ tation under Adv@@ agra@@ f to ensure proper substance exposure in the immediate post transplan@@ tation phase .
&quot; since Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus is a substance with low clearance , an adaptation of the advance can scheme can take several days until the steady state is reached . &quot;
&quot; if the condition of the patient in the first post@@ operative phase does not allow oral dosage of medicines , the tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus treatment can be initiated intra@@ ven@@ ously ( Pro@@ gra@@ f 5 mg / ml concentrate for the production of an in@@ fusion solution ) with a dose of ca . &quot;
&quot; duration of application For the supp@@ ression of gra@@ ft rejection , the immune supp@@ ression must be maintained ; consequently , a maximum length of oral therapy cannot be given . &quot;
dosage recommendations - kidney transplan@@ tation proph@@ yla@@ xis of gra@@ ft rejection The oral advance therapy should start with 0.@@ 20 - 0.@@ 30 mg / kg / day as a daily gift in the morning .
other dos@@ es can later be required as the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can change in the course of stabil@@ isation of the patient after the transplan@@ t .
dose recommendations - liver transplan@@ tation proph@@ yla@@ xis of gra@@ ft rejection The oral advance therapy should start with 0.@@ 10 - 0.@@ 20 mg / kg / day as once daily gift in the morning .
&quot; dosage recommendation - change from Pro@@ gra@@ f to Adv@@ agra@@ f must be converted to a daily intake of Pro@@ gra@@ f capsules on a once daily intake of Pro@@ gra@@ f capsules , so this change in ratio 1 : 1 ( mg : mg ) to take place in relation to the total daily dose . &quot;
kidney and liver transplan@@ tation After switching from other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants to Adv@@ agra@@ f once a day the treatment with the oral initial dose recommended in kidney and liver transplan@@ tation must begin with the proph@@ yla@@ xis of gra@@ ft rejection .
&quot; transplan@@ tation in adult patients , which are switched to Adv@@ agra@@ f , is an oral initial dose of 0.15 mg / kg / day once daily . &quot;
&quot; other gra@@ ft recep@@ tor Al@@ though there is no clinical experience with adv@@ anc@@ e- , pancre@@ atic and color@@ ect@@ al transplan@@ ts , Pro@@ gra@@ f was diagnosed in an oral initial dose of 0.@@ 10 - 0.15 mg / kg / day in an oral initial dose of 0.2 mg / kg / day and in an oral initial dose of 0.3 mg / kg / day . &quot;
dosage adjustment in special patient groups patients with limited liver function in order to maintain blood levels in the targeted area can be necessary in patients with severe liver function disorders .
&quot; since the kidney function does not affect the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , it can be assumed that dose adjustment is not necessary . &quot;
&quot; however , due to the ne@@ phr@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic potential of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , a careful monitoring of the kidney function ( including a regular determination of the ser@@ um cre@@ ase levels , a calculation of the cre@@ atin@@ ine and a monitoring of the ur@@ inary volume ) is recommended . &quot;
switch from C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in to Adv@@ agra@@ f When switching from a c@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in to a Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus @-@ based therapy caution is necessary ( see Sec@@ tions 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
recommendations on the level of tal@@ low in Voll@@ blu@@ t The dose should be based primarily on the clinical assessment of rep@@ ul@@ sion and toler@@ ability in individual cases with the aid of thorou@@ gh@@ bred Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus tal@@ levels .
it is recommended frequent checks of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus tal@@ levels during the first two weeks after transplan@@ tation followed by peri@@ odic checks during maintenance therapy .
&quot; blood @-@ level mirrors of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus should also be controlled after switching from Pro@@ gra@@ f to Adv@@ agra@@ f , dosage adjustment , changes in immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy or simultaneous use of substances which could change the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus whole blood concentration ( see Section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; since Adv@@ agra@@ f is a drug with a low clearance , adjustments of the dose may require several days until the Ste@@ ady State has entered . &quot;
the data in clinical studies indicate that successful treatment is possible in most cases when the level mirror in the blood does not exceed 20 ng / ml .
&quot; in clinical practice , the tal@@ el@@ ic level of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus in the first time after liver transplan@@ ts usually lie in the range of 5 - 20 ng / ml and vene@@ ers - and transplan@@ ted patients at 10 - 20 ng / ml . &quot;
&quot; during the following maintenance therapy of liver , kidney and heart transplan@@ t recipients , blood concentrations were generally used in the range of 5 - 15 ng / ml . &quot;
&quot; this has led to serious adverse events , including gra@@ ft rejection or other side effects , which can occur in consequence of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus submission or ex@@ position . &quot;
patients should always maintain the same tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus form@@ ulation and the corresponding daily dosage ; ren@@ ditions of form@@ ulation or regime should only be performed under close monitoring of a physician experienced in transplan@@ tation ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 4.8 ) .
&quot; 5 To treat adult patients with gra@@ ft rejection , which proved to be effective against other immune supp@@ ress@@ ants as refra@@ c@@ tory , there are no clinical data for the re@@ tar@@ ded form@@ ulation adv@@ anc@@ f . &quot;
&quot; for the proph@@ yla@@ xis of gra@@ ft rejection in adult heart transplan@@ t recipients and gra@@ ft recei@@ vers in childhood , there are no clinical data for the re@@ tar@@ ded form@@ ulation . &quot;
&quot; due to possible interactions , which can lead to a lowering of the tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus mirrors in the blood and a weak@@ ening of the clinical effect of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , the intake of herbal supplements containing car@@ ob ( hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) is to be avoided or other plant remedi@@ es during a treatment with the Adv@@ agra@@ f ( see Section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients with di@@ arr@@ ho@@ ea , a particularly careful monitoring of the tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus concentrations in the blood is offered , as the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus blood levels may be subject to considerable fluctu@@ ations under such circumstances . &quot;
&quot; in rare cases , under Pro@@ gra@@ f , a chamber or sep@@ tum @-@ hyper@@ tro@@ phy described in Pro@@ gra@@ f could be observed , which can therefore occur under the Act of Adv@@ agra@@ f . &quot;
&quot; other factors that increase the risk of such clinical distur@@ bances are an already existing heart disease , a treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , high blood pressure , kidney or liver function disorders , infections , fluid over@@ loading and oil . &quot;
&quot; as with other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants , the effect of sunlight or UV light should be restricted due to the possible risk of mal@@ ign@@ ant skin changes due to suitable clothing or use of a sun protection system with a high protection factor . &quot;
&quot; if patients who take the tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , symptoms for PRE@@ S such as head@@ ache , altered state of consciousness , con@@ vul@@ sions and vision distur@@ bances , should be a radi@@ ological examination ( e.@@ g . &quot;
&quot; in patients with rare her@@ edi@@ tary Gal@@ act@@ ose int@@ oler@@ ance , lac@@ t@@ ase deficiency or glucose @-@ gal@@ act@@ ose mal@@ absorption , special caution is required in patients with rare her@@ edi@@ tary Gal@@ act@@ ose int@@ oler@@ ance , lac@@ t@@ ase deficiency or glucose @-@ gal@@ act@@ ose mal@@ absorption . &quot;
&quot; simultaneous use of medicines or herbal remedi@@ es known as inhibit@@ ors or induc@@ tors of C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 , can affect the metabolism of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus and consequently increase or lower the blood values of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus . &quot;
&quot; it is therefore recommended to monitor the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus blood levels while offering substances that can change C@@ YP@@ 3A &apos;s metabolism , and adjust the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus dose to maintain consistent concentrations ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; a strongly distinctive interaction with anti@@ fung@@ ics such as k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole , flu@@ con@@ az@@ ole , i@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole , and v@@ ori@@ con@@ az@@ ole as well as with the Mac@@ ro@@ lid antibiotic ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin and HIV prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors ( z . &quot;
&quot; pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic studies showed that the increase in blood levels is mainly due to the increased oral bio@@ availability of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , caused by inhibit@@ ing g@@ astro@@ intestinal alter@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; highly dos@@ ed pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ one or meth@@ yl pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ one , as used in acute rejection , can increase or lower the concentration of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus in the blood . &quot;
effect of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus on the metabolism of other medicines Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus is known as C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 in@@ Hem@@ mer ; hence the simultaneous use of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus with medicines which are met@@ ab@@ oli@@ zed by C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 can imp@@ air their metabolism .
&quot; since Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can reduce the clearance of ster@@ oid contra@@ cep@@ tives , so that the hormone ex@@ position can increase is particularly cau@@ tious in decisions about contra@@ cep@@ tive measures . &quot;
the results of animal testing demonstrated that tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus potentially l@@ essen the clearance of pent@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al and phen@@ az@@ one and can pro@@ long its half @-@ value .
the results of a small number of transplan@@ t patients have no indication that under tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus in comparison to other immune supp@@ res@@ si@@ va there is an increased risk of adverse events with regard to the course and outcome of pregnancy .
&quot; in uter@@ o exposure , a monitoring of the new@@ born on possible harmful effects of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus ( especially with regard to its effect on the kid@@ neys ) is recommended . &quot;
&quot; there is the risk of premature birth ( &lt; week 37 ) and a hyper@@ emia of the new@@ born ( inci@@ dence 8 of 111 new@@ bor@@ ns , i.e. : &quot;
the side @-@ acting profile of immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ si@@ va is often not exactly determined because of the underlying disease of the patient and the simultaneous treatment with a variety of other medicines .
&quot; in the following , the side effects are performed after their frequency in descending order : very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 , ≤ 1 / 10 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , ≤ 1 / 1,000 ) , rare ( ≤ 1 / 10,000 , ≤ 1 / 1,000 ) , very rare ( ≤ 1 / 10,000 , ≤ 1 / 1,000 ) , very rare ( frequency based on the available data is not estimated ) . &quot;

cases of BK @-@ Virus @-@ associated ne@@ ph@@ rop@@ athy and J@@ C @-@ Virus @-@ associated progressive multi@@ focal leu@@ ko@@ encephal@@ opathy ( P@@ ML ) were reported in patients with immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression therapy including therapy with adv@@ anc@@ f .
it was reported on ben@@ ign or mal@@ ign@@ ant ne@@ oplas@@ ms including EB@@ V@@ - associated lymp@@ ho@@ prolifer@@ ative diseases and skin tum@@ ors in connection with the treatment with tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus .
&quot; due to its high molecular weight , low water sol@@ ub@@ ility and the high binding of ery@@ thro@@ cy@@ tes and plasma proteins , it can be assumed that tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus is not di@@ aly@@ tic . &quot;
mechanism and pharmac@@ o@@ dynamic effects at a molecular level are likely to convey the effects of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus through its binding to a cy@@ tos@@ olic protein ( F@@ KB@@ P@@ 12 ) which is responsible for the enrich@@ ment of the connection in the cellular nucle@@ us .
this leads to a cal@@ ci@@ um@@ dependent in@@ hibition of signal trans@@ duction path@@ ways in the T cell and thus prevents the tran@@ scription of a certain number of lymph@@ oma genes .

&quot; 175 patients transplan@@ ted , with 475 patients under@@ going pancre@@ atic transplan@@ tation and in 630 cases after a color@@ ect@@ al transplan@@ t as primary immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ant . &quot;
&quot; overall , the safety profile of oral Pro@@ gra@@ f in these published studies revealed the observ@@ ations in the major studies in which Pro@@ gra@@ f was used in liver , kidney and heart transplan@@ t recipients for primary immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression . &quot;
&quot; lung transplan@@ tation In an interim analysis of a recently conducted , multi @-@ cent@@ ric study with oral Pro@@ gra@@ f was reported over 110 patients receiving either Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus or C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in as part of a 1 : 1 random@@ ization . &quot;
&quot; chronic gra@@ ft rejection , bron@@ chi@@ oli@@ tis ob@@ liter@@ ate syndrome , was observed in the first year after the transplan@@ t ( 2.@@ 86 % versus 8.@@ 57 % ) . &quot;
&quot; survival rate after a year was 8@@ 0.8 % in the tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus@@ - and 83 % in the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in group ( Tre@@ ede et al . , 3rd IC@@ I San Diego , USA , 2004 ; Abstract 22 ) . &quot;
&quot; in the patients treated with tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , 21.@@ 7 % of the cases used to produce bron@@ chi@@ oli@@ tis ob@@ liter@@ ans compared to 38.@@ 0 % below C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( p = 0.0@@ 25 ) . &quot;
&quot; the number of cases in which C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in had to be changed to tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus ( n = 13 ) was significantly greater ( p = 0.0@@ 2 ) than the number of patients converted by tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus on C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( n = 2 ) ( Ke@@ en@@ an et al . , Ann Thor@@ ac@@ ic Sur@@ g 1995 ; 60 : 580 ) . &quot;
&quot; the number of cases in which no acute transplan@@ t rejection occurred after 6 months ( 57,@@ 7 % versus 45,@@ 8 % ) and after 1 year ( 50 % versus 33.@@ 3 % ) in the patients transplan@@ ted by the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus Group ( Tre@@ ede et al . , J Heart L@@ ung Transplan@@ t 2001 ; 20 : 511 ) . &quot;
in one study the frequency of the birth of a bron@@ chi@@ oli@@ tis ob@@ liter@@ ated syndrome was significantly lower in patients treated with tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus .
&quot; pancre@@ atic transplan@@ tation A multi @-@ cent@@ ric study with oral Pro@@ gra@@ f was carried out to 205 patients who , at the same time under@@ gone a pancre@@ atic and kidney transplan@@ t , who received a random@@ ised procedure tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus ( n = 103 ) or c@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( n = 102 ) . &quot;
the oral initial dose ( per protocol ) of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus was 0.2 mg / kg / day and was followed after reaching the as@@ pi@@ red level of 8 to 15 ng / ml on 5 .
&quot; the published clinical results of a mono@@ cent@@ ric study with oral Pro@@ gra@@ f as primary immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ant after color@@ ect@@ al transplan@@ tation showed a current survival rate of 75 % after 1 year , 5 % after 5 years and 42 % after 10 years . &quot;

&quot; factors such as low hem@@ at@@ oc@@ rit@@ es and low protein concentrations , which lead to an increase in the un@@ bound group of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , or a strengthening of metabolism caused by cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , should be responsible for the higher clear@@ ance rates observed after transplan@@ t . &quot;
&quot; this can be concluded that tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus is almost completely metabol@@ ised before ex@@ cre@@ tion , with ex@@ cre@@ tion mainly via the bil@@ e . &quot;
the system@@ ic exposure of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus ( AU@@ C@@ 0 @-@ 24 ) under Adv@@ agra@@ f was approximately 10 % lower than under Pro@@ gra@@ f .
it is recommended frequent checks of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus tal@@ levels during the first two weeks after transplan@@ tation followed by peri@@ odic checks during maintenance therapy .
&quot; 21 For the treatment of adult patients with gra@@ ft rejection , which proved to be a therapy resistant to other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants , there are no clinical data for the re@@ tar@@ ded form@@ ulation . &quot;
&quot; other factors that increase the risk of such clinical distur@@ bances are an already existing heart disease , a treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , high blood pressure , kidney or liver function disorders , infections , fluid over@@ loading and oil . &quot;

Adv@@ ate is used to treat and prevent bleeding in patients with hem@@ op@@ hi@@ lia A ( a her@@ edi@@ tary disorder caused by the deficiency of factor VIII ) .
the dosage and frequency of the application depend on whether Adv@@ ate is applied to treat bleeding or to prevent bleeding in surgical procedures .
&quot; patients with hem@@ op@@ hi@@ lia A suffer from a factor of VIII deficiency , causing blood cl@@ ots issues such as bleeding in joints , muscles or internal organs . &quot;
&quot; Oc@@ to@@ co@@ g al@@ fa is not extracted from human plasma but manufactured according to a method known as &quot; &quot; re@@ combin@@ ant DNA technology &quot; &quot; : &quot;
it is produced by a cell into which a gene ( DNA ) has been brought into the formation of the human co@@ ag@@ ulation factor VIII .
&quot; Adv@@ ate is similar to another in the European Union called Recom@@ bin@@ ate , but is produced differently , so that the medicine does not contain any proteins human@@ i@@ ties or animal origin . &quot;
&quot; in three additional studies of patients with severe to moderate hem@@ op@@ hi@@ lia A , including a study of 53 children under six years , the application of the drug was investigated to prevent bleeding and surgical procedures . &quot;
in the main study the efficacy of Adv@@ ate in the prevention of bleeding in 86 % of 510 new blood sep@@ is@@ odes with &quot; excellent &quot; or &quot; good &quot; were evaluated .
&quot; the most common adverse events of Adv@@ ate ( observed in 1 to 10 out of 100 patients ) are di@@ zz@@ iness , head@@ ache , py@@ re@@ x@@ ia ( fever ) and the formation of antibodies against factor VIII . &quot;
&quot; may not be applied to patients who may possibly be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to human co@@ ag@@ ulation factor VIII , Mouse or Ham@@ ster@@ one or any of the other ingredients . &quot;
&quot; in March 2004 , the European Commission granted Ba@@ x@@ ter AG approval for the establishment of Adv@@ ate in the entire European Union . &quot;
&quot; dosage The dosage and duration of the sub@@ stitution therapy depend on the sever@@ ity of the Factor VIII @-@ deficiency , on the spot and the extent of the bleeding and the clinical condition of the patient . &quot;
&quot; in the following here@@ tical events , the Factor VIII activity in the corresponding period should not fall below the specified plasma levels ( in % of the standard or I.@@ E. / dl ) . &quot;
injection every 12 @-@ 24 hours ( 8 @-@ 24 hours in patients under 6 years ) for 3 @-@ 4 days or longer repeat until pain and acute adverse effects are eliminated .
injection every 8 @-@ 24 hours ( 6 @-@ 12 hours in patients under 6 years ) repeat until the risk of the patient is over .
&quot; during the treatment process , a reasonable determination of factor VIII is recommended to control the dose and frequency of inj@@ ections . &quot;
&quot; individual patients can differ in their response to Factor VIII , different in vi@@ vo recovery and have different sem@@ it@@ ages . &quot;
3 proph@@ yla@@ xis for long @-@ term proph@@ yla@@ xis of bleeding in patients with severe hem@@ op@@ hi@@ lia A should be given between 20 and 40 I.@@ U. of factor VIII per kg of body weight at intervals of 2 @-@ 3 days .
&quot; if the expected factor of VIII @-@ plasma activity is not achieved or if the bleeding is not controlled with an appropriate dose , a test must be performed to detect an inhibit@@ or if necessary . &quot;
&quot; in patients with high inhibit@@ ors , it is possible that the Factor VIII therapy is not effective so that other therapeutic measures must be considered . &quot;
&quot; the passing speed should be directed to the patient , with a maximum injection rate of 10 ml / min should not be exceeded . &quot;
the formation of neutr@@ alizing antibodies ( inhibit@@ ors ) against Factor VIII is a well @-@ known comp@@ lication in the treatment of patients with hem@@ op@@ hi@@ lia A .
&quot; these inhibit@@ ors are always against the pro@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ atory activity of Factor VIII directed Ig@@ G immun@@ og@@ lob@@ ul@@ ins , which are quanti@@ fied in Be@@ thes@@ da units ( B.@@ E. ) per ml plasma using modified Be@@ thes@@ da as@@ say . &quot;
&quot; the risk of developing inhibit@@ ors is cor@@ related with the extent of exposure to the factor VIII , with the risk of the first 20 exposure stage is most dependent on genetic and other factors . &quot;
&quot; in pre@@ treated patients ( PT@@ Ps ) with more than 100 exposure stages and an@@ am@@ nes@@ tically known inhibit@@ or development , after switching from a re@@ combin@@ ant Factor VIII product to another , the re@@ occurrence of ( low ) inhibit@@ ors was observed . &quot;
&quot; due to the rare occurrence of hem@@ op@@ hi@@ lia A in women , there are no experiences about the use of Factor VIII during pregnancy and lac@@ tation . &quot;
&quot; the A@@ DR@@ s occurring in the largest number of patients were inhibit@@ ors against Factor VIII ( 5 patients ) , which showed a higher risk to the formation of inhibit@@ ors , head@@ aches ( 5 patients ) , fever and di@@ zz@@ iness ( 3 patients each ) . &quot;
&quot; very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 to &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 to &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) , very rare ( frequency based on available data is not estimated ) . &quot;
a ) The percentage of patients was calculated based on the sum of each patient ( 234 ) . the unexpected drop in the blood cl@@ ot@@ ting factor VIII @-@ Spi@@ eg@@ els occurred post@@ oper@@ atively ( 10 - 14 post@@ operative day ) in one patient under continuous A@@ DV@@ ATE in@@ fusion .
the blood cl@@ ot@@ ting was maintained throughout the time and both the factor VI@@ II@@ - mirror in the plasma and the clearing rate showed sufficient values again on the 15th post@@ operative day .
clinical trials with A@@ DV@@ ATE to 145 children and adults 2 diagnosed with severe to moderate h@@ amm@@ op@@ hi@@ lia A ( F@@ VIII ≤ 2 % ) and previous exposure to factor VI@@ II@@ - concentr@@ ates ( ≥ 150 days ) showed only one patient after 26 exposure stages with A@@ DV@@ ATE a low inhibit@@ or ti@@ ter ( 2.4 B.@@ E. in the modified Be@@ thes@@ da approach ) .
&quot; in addition , in none of the 53 pa@@ edi@@ atric patients with age of under 6 years and diagnosed serious to moderate h@@ amm@@ op@@ hi@@ lia A ( F@@ VIII ≤ 2 % ) , after previous exposure to factor VI@@ II@@ - concentr@@ ates ( ≥ 50 days ) a F@@ VIII @-@ inhibit@@ or was established . &quot;
previously untreated patients of an ongoing clinical study were 5 out of 25 ( 20 % ) treated with A@@ DV@@ ATE treated patients inhibit@@ ors by Factor VIII .
&quot; the patient &apos;s immune response to traces of contam@@ inated proteins was analysed by exam@@ ining the antibodies against these proteins , laboratory parameters and reported side effects . &quot;
&quot; a patient showed both a statisti@@ cally significant upward trend and a persistent peak of anti @-@ CH@@ O cell protein , otherwise there were no signs or symptoms indic@@ ted for an allergic reaction or hyper@@ sensitivity . &quot;
&quot; four patients were occasionally reported on the occurrence of Ur@@ tic@@ aria , Pr@@ ur@@ itus , skin r@@ ash and increased number of e@@ os@@ in@@ op@@ hil@@ er gran@@ u@@ loc@@ ytes in several re@@ peti@@ tive product positions within the study . &quot;
&quot; 7 As with other intra@@ ven@@ ous products , A@@ DV@@ ATE has been reported about hyper@@ sensitivity reactions from allergic type , including an@@ ap@@ hy@@ la@@ k@@ tic / an@@ ap@@ hy@@ la@@ k@@ to@@ i@@ tic reactions ( frequency not known ) . &quot;
the activated Factor VIII works as a co@@ factor for the enabled factor IX and acceler@@ ates the formation of activated Factor X from factor X .
all pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic studies with A@@ DV@@ ATE were performed in pre @-@ treated patients with severe or moderate h@@ amm@@ op@@ hi@@ lia A ( basic factor of the Factor VIII @-@ Activity ≤ 2 % ) .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic parameters stem from a cross @-@ over study with A@@ DV@@ ATE in 100 previously treated patients or &gt; 10 years and are listed below table 3 below .

&quot; based on the data available since the date of authorisation , CH@@ MP has continued to evaluate the benefits risk assessment as positive , but considering that the safety profile must be closely monitored for the following reasons : &quot;
&quot; therefore , the CH@@ MP has decided on the basis of the safety profile of A@@ DV@@ ATE that necess@@ it@@ ates a fil@@ ing of PS@@ UR@@ s every 6 months , decided that the authorisation holder should apply for a further prolon@@ gation process within 5 years . &quot;
December 2008 Gen@@ du@@ x Molecular Limited announces the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) officially that the company ref@@ uses its application for authorisation for the use of an Adv@@ ex@@ in for the treatment of Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i @-@ Cancer .
&quot; normally , however , the breast , the brain , the bones or the soft parts ( tissue that connects the other structures in the body , surro@@ unds and supports ) . &quot;
this is a type of virus that has been gene@@ tically modified so that it can carry a gene into the cells of the body .
&quot; the virus in Adv@@ ex@@ in is an &quot; A@@ den@@ o@@ virus , &quot; which has been modified in such a way that there are no copies of themselves and therefore cannot trigger infections in humans . &quot;
Adv@@ ex@@ in could have been inj@@ ected directly into the tum@@ ors and thus enable the cancer cells to re @-@ establish the normal p@@ 53 protein .
&quot; p@@ 53 protein , which is formed from the non @-@ defect in the human body existing p@@ 53 gene , normally contributes to the recovery of corrupt DNA and killing cells when the DNA cannot be recovered . &quot;
&quot; Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i Cancer , where the p@@ 53 gene is defective , the p@@ 53 protein does not work properly , and the cancer cells can continue to grow and share . &quot;
&quot; the company presented data from a study with a patient , with the Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer in the area of the under@@ growth , bone and brain . &quot;
&quot; after the CH@@ MP had examined the answers of the company on the questions posed by him , there were still some questions un@@ resolved . &quot;
&quot; based on the examination of the initial submitted documents , the CH@@ MP created a list of questions sent to the company on day 120 . &quot;
&quot; according to the CH@@ MP , it was not sufficiently demonstrated that the injection of Adv@@ ex@@ in in Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i @-@ Tum@@ ors benefits patients . &quot;
&quot; the Committee also had concerns regarding the processing of the drug in the body , the type of administration and the safety of the medicine . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the company had not sufficiently demonstrated that Adv@@ ex@@ in can be manufactured in a reliable way and that it is harmful neither for the environment nor for people who come in close contact with the patient . &quot;
the company did not take note of the CH@@ MP whether the withdrawal has consequences for patients who are currently participating in clinical trials or comp@@ as@@ sion@@ ate use programs with Adv@@ ex@@ in .
&quot; altered drug release &quot; means that the tablets are so composite that one of the effective ingredients is immediately released , and the other slowly over a few hours . &quot;
aer@@ ation is used to treat the symptoms of the seasonal allergic r@@ hin@@ itis ( ha@@ y fever caused by an allergy to pol@@ len ) in patients with nas@@ al s@@ mu@@ c@@ ous swelling ( stu@@ ffy nose ) .
&quot; in adults and adol@@ esc@@ ents aged 12 and older , the recommended dose of aer@@ on@@ ze is twice daily with a glass of water with or without food . &quot;
&quot; the duration of the treatment should be as short as possible and termin@@ ated once the symptoms , especially the swelling of the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a ( c@@ logged nose ) . &quot;
a treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended because the effects of the medication can be reli@@ eved on the con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose .
the main efficacy measurements were the changes in the sever@@ ity of the ha@@ y fever symptoms reported by patients prior to treatment and during the 15 @-@ day treatment .
&quot; during the study , patients carried out their symptoms every 12 hours in a journal and rated with a standard scale , how difficult the symptoms were in the last 12 hours . &quot;
&quot; when considering all ha@@ y fever symptoms except the con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose reported the patients receiving aer@@ on@@ ze about a decrease in symptoms by 4@@ 6.0 % , compared to 35.@@ 9 % in patients receiving pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine alone . &quot;
&quot; if only the swelling of the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a was seen , the patients under Aer@@ on@@ ze showed a relief of the symptoms by 37.@@ 4 % compared to 26.@@ 7 % in the patients who participated alone . &quot;
&quot; the most common adverse events of aer@@ os@@ ze ( observed in 1 to 10 out of 100 patients ) are t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia ( cardi@@ ac ch@@ ase ) , oral dr@@ y@@ ness , di@@ zz@@ iness , psych@@ omot@@ or hyper@@ activity ( rest@@ lessness ) , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , head@@ ache , fatigue , in@@ som@@ nia ( drow@@ sin@@ ess ) , som@@ n@@ ol@@ ence ( drow@@ sin@@ ess ) , sleep disorders and nerv@@ ousness . &quot;
&quot; aer@@ os@@ ols may not be used in patients who may possibly be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to dis@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine or any of the other ingredients , against ad@@ ren@@ ergi@@ c drugs or lau@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( another drug for the treatment of allergi@@ es ) . &quot;
&quot; aer@@ os@@ ols may also not be used in patients who suffer from a bot@@ t@@ angle glau@@ coma ( increased intra@@ ocular pressure ) , ur@@ inary post@@ ure ( hyper@@ tension ) , hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ i@@ osis ( hyper@@ tension ) , hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ i@@ osis ( hyper@@ tension caused by stroke ) , or have a risk of an hem@@ or@@ rh@@ ag@@ ic stroke . &quot;
&quot; on 30 July 2007 , the European Commission issued a permit for the transport of aer@@ os@@ ols throughout the European Union to the SP Europe . &quot;
&quot; the tablet can be taken with a glass of water , however it is swal@@ lowed whole ( i.e. without tear@@ ing , to break or ch@@ ew ) . &quot;
aer@@ os@@ ze should not be used in children under 12 years due to lack of data on harm@@ lessness and efficacy ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the duration of the application is as short as possible and should not continue after the symptoms .
it is recommended to limit the duration of application to 10 days because long @-@ term application can decrease the activity of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine with time .
&quot; after swelling of the mu@@ c@@ ous membran@@ es in the upper respiratory tract , treatment can be continued as a mon@@ otherapy when needed . &quot;
&quot; as Aer@@ on@@ ze contains pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine , the medicine is also contra@@ indicated in patients treated with a mono@@ amine oxid@@ ase ( MA@@ O ) inhibit@@ or or within the 2 weeks after completion of such a therapy . &quot;
&quot; this is due to the al@@ ph@@ am@@ im@@ etic activity in combined application of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine with other vas@@ o@@ con@@ stric@@ tors such as bro@@ mo@@ cri@@ pi@@ tin , per@@ go@@ lid , per@@ go@@ lid , cab@@ erg@@ olin , erg@@ ot@@ amine , phen@@ yle@@ phr@@ ine , eph@@ edr@@ ine , oxy@@ met@@ az@@ oline , nap@@ haz@@ ard etc . ) . &quot;
the safety and efficacy of this combination therapy have not been checked for this patient collective and the data are not sufficient to pronoun@@ ce appropriate recommendations for dosing .
the safety and efficacy of aer@@ os@@ ols were not tested in patients with kidney or liver function disorders and the data are not sufficient to pronoun@@ ce appropriate recommendations for dosage .
&quot; patients must be informed that treatment should be canc@@ eled in case of hyper@@ tension or t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia or pal@@ pit@@ ations , cardi@@ ac arr@@ hyth@@ mi@@ as , nau@@ sea or any other neurolog@@ ical symptoms ( such as head@@ ache or strengthening of head@@ ache ) . &quot;
&quot; patients with hyper@@ tension • Pati@@ ents with hyper@@ tension • Pati@@ ents with hyper@@ tension • Pati@@ ents with a m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction in an@@ am@@ n@@ ese , diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , bladder cancer or bron@@ ch@@ os@@ pas@@ m in an@@ am@@ n@@ ese . &quot;
&quot; aer@@ os@@ ols are at least 48 hours before performing der@@ mat@@ ological tests , as anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines otherwise prevent positive reactions to indicators for skin reactions or reduce their scale . &quot;
&quot; in the course of clinical trials with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in which ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were additionally ad@@ ministered , no clin@@ ically relevant interactions or changes in the plasma concentration of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n have been observed . &quot;
&quot; the results of the psych@@ omot@@ or test showed no significant differences between the patients treated with dis@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and the patients treated with plac@@ ebo , regardless of whether they were taken alone or with alcohol . &quot;
&quot; the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n has not yet been identified , so that interactions with other medicines cannot be completely ruled out . &quot;
&quot; Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n does not in@@ hi@@ bit in @-@ vi@@ vo C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 , and in vit@@ ro studies have shown that the drug C@@ YP@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 is not in@@ hibited and neither a sub@@ strate nor an inhibit@@ or of P @-@ gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ eins is . &quot;
&quot; the harm@@ lessness of the use of aer@@ os@@ ols during pregnancy is not assured , experience from a large number of affected pregn@@ ancies did not raise the frequency of ab@@ norm@@ alities compared with the frequency of the normal population . &quot;
&quot; since reproduction studies on animals are not always transferred to humans and on the basis of the vas@@ o@@ con@@ stri@@ ctive properties of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine , aer@@ ation should not be applied in pregnancy . &quot;
&quot; however , patients should be informed that in very rare cases it can come to a ligh@@ the@@ ade@@ dness which may result in an im@@ pair@@ ment of the traffic light or the ability to serve machines . &quot;
&quot; symptoms may vary between a CN@@ S depression ( sed@@ ation , ap@@ no@@ ea , dimin@@ ished mental attention , cy@@ an@@ osis , coma , cardiovascular collapse ) and a CN@@ S stimulation ( sle@@ e@@ pl@@ ess@@ ness , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations , tre@@ mor , con@@ vul@@ sions ) with possible let@@ ter@@ ings . &quot;
&quot; head@@ ache , anxiety , difficult mus@@ cular tension , muscle weakness and increased muscle tension , eu@@ ph@@ oria , arous@@ al , respiratory failure , cardi@@ ac arr@@ hyth@@ mi@@ as , t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia , pal@@ pit@@ ations , vom@@ iting , pre@@ historic pain , di@@ zz@@ iness , t@@ innitus , at@@ ax@@ ia , vision distur@@ bances and hyper@@ tension or hyp@@ ot@@ ony . &quot;
&quot; CN@@ S stimulation is particularly likely in children as well as at@@ rop@@ ine @-@ typical symptoms ( mouth @-@ dr@@ y@@ ness , pup@@ il star@@ re and - di@@ lat@@ ation , skin relief , hyper@@ ther@@ mia and g@@ astro@@ intestinal symptoms ) . &quot;
&quot; these include inhibit@@ ing the release of inflammatory cy@@ tok@@ ines such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human mast cells / bas@@ op@@ hil@@ es as well as inhibit@@ ing the expression of the adhes@@ ion molec@@ ule P @-@ sel@@ ec@@ tin to end@@ othel@@ ial cells . &quot;
&quot; in an adult dose study with adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurement parameters of the flight balance , including rein@@ forcement of subjective sleep@@ iness or the tasks associated with flying . &quot;
&quot; in controlled clinical trials , the recommended dosage of 5 m@@ g. daily did not cause increased inci@@ dence of drow@@ sin@@ ess compared to plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; the oral application of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine in the recommended dosage can cause further sympath@@ om@@ im@@ etic effects , such as an increase in blood pressure , t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia or manifest@@ ations of a CN@@ S arous@@ al . &quot;
&quot; 1,@@ 248 patients aged 12 to 78 participated with seasonal allergic r@@ hin@@ itis , whereby 414 patients received Aer@@ on@@ ze tablets . &quot;
&quot; in both studies , the hist@@ amine antagon@@ istic efficacy of aer@@ os@@ ze tablets , determined by the overall cor@@ es for the symptoms ( except nas@@ al s@@ mu@@ c@@ ous swelling ) , was significantly higher than under a mon@@ otherapy with pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine over the 2 @-@ week treatment period . &quot;
&quot; the efficacy of aer@@ os@@ ze tablets with regard to the swelling effect , determined by the nas@@ al s@@ mu@@ c@@ ous swelling , was significantly higher than under a mon@@ otherapy with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n over the 2 @-@ week treatment period . &quot;
&quot; the efficacy of aer@@ os@@ ze tablets showed no significant differences in patient sub@@ groups with regard to gender , age or ethnic affili@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; as part of a single dose study on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of aer@@ on@@ ze , des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n can be detected within 30 minutes after administration in the plasma . &quot;
&quot; after the per@@ oral application of aer@@ on@@ ze for healthy subjects over 14 days , the flow balance of the lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , 3 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine was reached on day 10 . &quot;
&quot; in the framework of a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic multi @-@ dose study , which was carried out with the form@@ ulation as tablet for healthy adult subjects , it was found that four subjects of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n were poor@@ ly metabol@@ ised . &quot;
a component interaction study shows that the exposure ( C@@ max and AU@@ C ) of Pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine after the sole gift of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine is bio@@ equivalent to the exposure of an aer@@ os@@ ze tablet .
&quot; based on conventional studies on safety har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated gift , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and re@@ productive toxic@@ ity , however , the prec@@ lin@@ ical data with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n can not detect any particular haz@@ ards for humans . &quot;
the combination possessed no greater toxic@@ ity than its individual components and the observed effects were generally associated with the ingredient pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine .
in re@@ productive studies the combination of lau@@ at@@ adi@@ n / Pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine was not ter@@ ato@@ genic in a dosage of up to 150 mg / kg / day and rab@@ bits in a dose of up to 120 mg / kg / day .
&quot; in March 2007 and in Modul 1.@@ 8.1 of the application for authorisation , pharmac@@ ovi@@ gil@@ ance system is established and works before and while the product is on the market . &quot;
&quot; anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines contribute to the relief of allergic symptoms , preventing hist@@ amine , a body &apos;s substance , can develop its effect . &quot;
&quot; aer@@ os@@ ze tablets rel@@ ieve symptoms associated with seasonal allergic r@@ hin@@ itis ( ha@@ y fever ) , such as ni@@ esen , running or it@@ ching nose and tear@@ ing or it@@ ching eyes while con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose . &quot;

&quot; tell your doctor if the following symptoms or diseases occur or diagnosed with the use of aer@@ on@@ ze : • blood pressure • heart ch@@ asing , pal@@ pit@@ ations • arr@@ hyth@@ mia • nau@@ sea and head@@ ache or a strengthening of existing head@@ aches . &quot;
&quot; if you are taking Aer@@ on@@ ze with other medicines , inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you take other medicines or have recently taken it , even if it is not prescription drugs . &quot;
&quot; in case of use in the recommended dosage , it is not possible to anticip@@ ate that aer@@ ation leads to ligh@@ the@@ ade@@ dness or decre@@ ases attention . &quot;
if you have taken a larger amount of aer@@ os@@ ze than you should inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you have taken a larger amount of aer@@ os@@ ze than you should .
&quot; if you have forgotten the intake of Aer@@ on@@ ze If you for@@ got to take a dose in time , take the application as soon as possible and apply the next dose at the intended time . &quot;

&quot; after the market launch of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n very rarely has been reported about cases of severe allergic reactions ( breathing , whi@@ st@@ ling breathing , it@@ ching stimul@@ us , hi@@ ves r@@ ash , swelling ) or skin r@@ ashes . &quot;

&quot; it is available as a 5 mg tablet , 5 m@@ g@@ - and 5 mg enam@@ el tablets ( sol@@ uble tablet ) , 2.5 mg / ml sy@@ rup and 0.5 mg / ml @-@ sy@@ rup and 0.5 mg / ml solution . &quot;
&quot; for children aged one to five years , the dose is 1.25 mg once a day , which in the form of 2.5 ml sy@@ rup res@@ p . &quot;
&quot; for children between six and eleven years , the dose is 2.5 mg once a day , either in the form of 5 ml sy@@ rup or . &quot;
A@@ eri@@ us was studied in eight studies with about 4 800 adults and adol@@ esc@@ ents with allergic r@@ hin@@ itis ( including four studies on seasonal allergic r@@ hin@@ itis and two studies on patients who also had as@@ thma ) .
&quot; efficacy was measured by identifying the symptoms ( it@@ ching , number and size of the quad@@ ran@@ gles , affecting the sleep and the efficiency of the day ) and after six weeks of treatment . &quot;
&quot; further studies have been submitted to demonstrate that the body evalu@@ ates the sy@@ rup , the solution for taking and the enam@@ el tablets in the same way as the tablets and the application in children is un@@ think@@ able . &quot;
&quot; in case of allergic r@@ hin@@ itis , when the results of all studies were taken together , the two @-@ week treatment with 5 mg A@@ eri@@ us at an average decrease of the symptoms ( symptom point ) was 25 to 32 % , compared to the decrease of 12 to 26 % in the patients receiving a plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in the two studies in Ur@@ tik@@ aria , the decrease of the symptoms after six weeks of treatment with A@@ eri@@ us 58 and 67 % was compared to 40 and 33 % in patients treated with plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; A@@ eri@@ us may not be used in patients who may possibly be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , Lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n or any of the other ingredients . &quot;
&quot; January 2001 , the European Commission issued a permit for the company SP Europe to appro@@ ve A@@ eri@@ us in the entire European Union . &quot;
&quot; a tablet once a day , with one or without a meal , to alle@@ vi@@ ate symptoms in allergic r@@ hin@@ itis ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent allergic r@@ hin@@ itis ) and ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
there is limited experience from clinical trials to be effective in the application of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in adol@@ esc@@ ents aged 12 to 17 ( see Sec@@ tions 4.8 and 5.1 ) .
the treatment of an inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic r@@ hin@@ itis ( occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks ) should be carried out according to the current course of disease and can be res@@ umed after the symptoms of the symptoms and res@@ umed during re@@ occurrence .
in the persistent allergic r@@ hin@@ itis ( inci@@ dence of symptoms to 4 or more days a week and more than 4 weeks ) the patient may be recommended during the allergy period .
clin@@ ically relevant interactions were not found in clinical studies with dis@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n tablets in which ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were additionally ad@@ ministered ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , intake of A@@ eri@@ us and alcohol was not increased by the performance @-@ reducing effect of alcohol ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
&quot; however , patients should be informed that in very rare cases it can come to ligh@@ the@@ ade@@ dness which may result in an im@@ pair@@ ment of the traffic light or the ability to serve machines . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials in various indications , including allergic r@@ hin@@ itis and chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , 3 % more adverse events were reported daily in patients with A@@ eri@@ us than in patients treated with plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; the most common adverse events reported more often than in plac@@ ebo were ti@@ red@@ ness ( 1,2 % ) , mouth @-@ dr@@ y@@ ness ( 0.8 % ) and head@@ ache ( 0,6 % ) . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical study with 578 adol@@ escent patients from 12 to 17 years , the most common adverse event was head@@ ache , this occurred at 5.@@ 9 % of the patients treated with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and at 6.@@ 9 % of the patients treated with plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in a multi @-@ dose study , which was ad@@ ministered up to 45 mg of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( nine @-@ time clinical dosage ) , no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed . &quot;
&quot; this includes inhibit@@ ing the release of inflammatory cy@@ tok@@ ines such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human mast cells / bas@@ op@@ hil@@ es as well as inhibit@@ ing the expression of the adhes@@ ion molec@@ ule P @-@ sel@@ ec@@ tin to end@@ othel@@ ial cells . &quot;
a statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described as part of a clinical trial with multiple dos@@ es in a dose of up to 20 mg daily for 14 days .
&quot; in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , in which des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was ad@@ ministered in a dose of 45 mg every day ( the nine times the clinical dosage ) was ad@@ ministered over ten days , there was no extension of the Q@@ t@@ c interval . &quot;
&quot; in a single dose study with adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n showed 5 mg no influence on standard measurement parameters of the flight balance , including rein@@ forcement of subjective sleep@@ iness or the tasks associated with flying . &quot;
&quot; in patients with allergic r@@ hin@@ itis , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in alle@@ vi@@ ating symptoms such as ni@@ esen , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , tear and red@@ ness of the eyes as well as it@@ ching on the pal@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the established classification in seas@@ on@@ ally and per@@ enni@@ al , allergic r@@ hin@@ itis can be classified depending on the duration of symptoms alternatively also in inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic r@@ hin@@ itis and persistent allergic r@@ hin@@ itis . &quot;
inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic r@@ hin@@ itis is defined as the occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks .
persistent allergic r@@ hin@@ itis is defined as occurrence of symptoms in 4 or more days a week and more than 4 weeks .
&quot; as shown on the basis of the overall cor@@ es of the questionna@@ ire for quality of life at Rhin@@ o @-@ con@@ jun@@ c@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us reduces the stress caused by seasonal hi@@ r@@ hin@@ itis . &quot;
&quot; the chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria was treated as a substitute for other forms of the Ur@@ tic@@ aria , as the underlying path@@ ophysi@@ ology is similar to the different forms , and chronic patients can be easily recru@@ ited pro@@ spec@@ tively . &quot;
&quot; as the hist@@ amine removal is a caus@@ ative factor in all age @-@ ari@@ al diseases , it is expected that dis@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n leads to an improvement in symptoms except for the chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria ; this is confirmed by the recommendations of clinical guidelines . &quot;
&quot; in two plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in improving pr@@ ur@@ itus and the reduction of size and number of squares at the end of the first dose interval . &quot;
&quot; like in other studies with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ini@@ ka in chron@@ ically idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , the minority of patients who did not react to anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines were excluded from the study . &quot;
an improvement of the itch by more than 50 % was observed at 55 % of patients treated with det@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in comparison with 19 % of patients treated with plac@@ ebo .
treatment with A@@ eri@@ us significantly reduced the distur@@ b@@ ance of sleep and vi@@ gil@@ ance as measured by a 4 @-@ point scale to evaluate these variables .
&quot; in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study , in which the patient demo@@ s were comparable with the general seasonal , allergic r@@ hin@@ itis population , a higher concentration of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was reached in 4 % of patients . &quot;
there are no clu@@ es for a clin@@ ically relevant cum@@ ulation after a daily application of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( 5- 20 mg ) over 14 days .
&quot; however , the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n has not yet been identified so that interactions with other medicines will not be completely excluded . &quot;
&quot; in @-@ vi@@ vo , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n does not in@@ hi@@ bit C@@ YP@@ 2@@ A4 and in vit@@ ro studies have shown that the drug C@@ YP@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 is not in@@ hibited and is neither a sub@@ strate nor an inhibit@@ or of P @-@ gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ eins . &quot;
&quot; in a single dose study involving des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in a dose of 7.5 mg , meals ( fatty , cal@@ orie @-@ rich breakfast ) did not affect the availability of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n . &quot;
&quot; clinical studies conducted with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and Lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n showed no qualitative or quantitative differences in the toxic@@ ity profile of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and Lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n .
&quot; based on conventional studies on safety har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated gift , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and re@@ productive toxic@@ ity , the prec@@ lin@@ ical data with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n can not detect any particular haz@@ ards for humans . &quot;
&quot; colour@@ less film ( contains lac@@ tose @-@ mon@@ oh@@ ydr@@ ate , hy@@ pro@@ m@@ less , titanium dioxide , Mac@@ ro@@ go@@ l 400 , Indi@@ go car@@ min ( E 132 ) ) , color@@ less film ( contains hy@@ pro@@ m@@ less , Mac@@ ro@@ go@@ l 400 ) , car@@ nau@@ ba wax , slightly wax . &quot;
&quot; A@@ eri@@ us can be taken independently of meals , to alle@@ vi@@ ate symptoms in allergic r@@ hin@@ itis ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent allergic r@@ hin@@ itis ) and ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
prescri@@ bing doctor should be aware that most cases of r@@ hin@@ itis in children under 2 years are caused by an infection ( see Section 4.4 ) and that no data are available which support a treatment of inf@@ ectious r@@ hin@@ itis with A@@ eri@@ us .
&quot; in addition to the exclusion of upper respiratory infections or anatom@@ ic an@@ om@@ ali@@ es , an@@ am@@ nes@@ is , physical studies and corresponding laboratory and skin examinations should play a role in the diagnosis . &quot;
about 6 % of adults and children between 2 and 11 years are met@@ ab@@ oli@@ zed des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and experience higher levels of substance ( see Section 5.2 ) .
the safety of A@@ eri@@ us sy@@ rup in children between 2 and 11 years that met@@ ab@@ oli@@ zes fully met@@ ab@@ oli@@ zed is identical to that of children who are normally met@@ ab@@ oli@@ zed .
&quot; this medicine contains sac@@ char@@ ose and sor@@ bit@@ ol , so patients should not use her@@ edi@@ tary problems of fru@@ ct@@ ose int@@ oler@@ ance , glucose @-@ gal@@ act@@ ose absorption or sac@@ char@@ ase @-@ is@@ om@@ alt@@ as@@ e- in@@ suffici@@ ency of this medicine . &quot;
clin@@ ically relevant interactions were not found in clinical studies with A@@ eri@@ us tablets in which ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were additionally ad@@ ministered ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , the effectiveness of alcohol was not increased while taking A@@ eri@@ us tablets and alcohol ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
the overall frequency of adverse events in children between 2 and 11 years was similar to the A@@ eri@@ us sy@@ rup group as in the plac@@ ebo group .
&quot; in clinical trials involving adults and adol@@ esc@@ ents in various indications , including allergic r@@ hin@@ itis and chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , 3 % more adverse events were reported in patients with A@@ eri@@ us than in patients treated with plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in a multi @-@ dose study of adults and adol@@ esc@@ ents , which were ad@@ ministered up to 45 mg of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( nine @-@ time clinical dosage ) , no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed . &quot;
&quot; children aged 1 to 11 years old , who came into question for an anti@@ hist@@ amine therapy , received a daily dose dose of 1.25 mg ( aged between 1 and 5 years ) or 2.5 mg ( aged between 6 and 11 years ) . &quot;
&quot; because the course of allergic r@@ hin@@ itis / chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria and the profile of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in adults and children , the efficacy data of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in adults can be extra@@ pol@@ ated to the children &apos;s population . &quot;
a statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described as part of a clinical trial with multiple dos@@ es in adults and adol@@ esc@@ ents in a dose of up to 20 mg daily for 14 days .
&quot; in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study of adults and adol@@ esc@@ ents , in which des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was applied in a dose of 45 mg every day ( the nine times the clinical dose ) was applied over ten days in adults , there was no renewal of the Q@@ t@@ c interval . &quot;
&quot; in controlled clinical trials , the recommended dosage of 5 mg daily for adults and adol@@ esc@@ ents did not have increased frequency of drow@@ sin@@ ess compared to plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; at a single daily dose of 7,5 mg , A@@ eri@@ us tablets in adults and adol@@ esc@@ ents led to no im@@ pair@@ ment of the psych@@ omot@@ or . &quot;
&quot; in clinical pharmac@@ ological studies in adults , the simultaneous intake of alcohol was neither an increase in alcohol @-@ induced performance of performance nor an increase in drow@@ sin@@ ess . &quot;
&quot; in adults and adol@@ escent patients with allergic r@@ hin@@ itis , A@@ eri@@ us tablets were effective in alle@@ vi@@ ating symptoms such as ni@@ esen , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , tear and red@@ ness of the eyes as well as it@@ ching on the pal@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; as shown on the basis of the overall cor@@ es of the questionna@@ ire about quality of life for Rhin@@ o @-@ con@@ jun@@ c@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us pills are effectively caused by seasonal allergic r@@ hin@@ itis . &quot;
&quot; in two plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in improving pr@@ ur@@ itus and the reduction of size and number of squares at the end of the first dose interval . &quot;
&quot; the spread of this fully metabol@@ ised phen@@ otype was comparable to adults ( 6 % ) and children between 2 and 11 years ( 6 % ) and in both populations larger in black ( 18 % adults , 16 % children ) than for Cau@@ ca@@ si@@ ans ( 2 % adults , 3 % children ) . &quot;
similar pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic parameters were observed in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic multi @-@ dose trial with the sy@@ rup formation of children between 2 and 11 years with allergic r@@ hin@@ itis .
the load ( AU@@ C ) by Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was about 6@@ times higher after 3 to 6 hours and the C@@ max 3 to 4 times higher with a terminal block time of approximately 120 hours .
there are no clu@@ es for a clin@@ ically relevant drug @-@ cum@@ ulation after a daily application of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( 5- 20 mg ) more than 14 days in adults and adol@@ esc@@ ents .
&quot; 12 In various single dose studies , AU@@ C@@ - and C@@ max values of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in pedi@@ atric patients were comparable with those recommended by adults who received the des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n sy@@ rup in a dose of 5 mg . &quot;
&quot; however , the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n has not yet been identified so that interactions with other medicines cannot be completely ruled out . &quot;
&quot; A@@ eri@@ us sy@@ rup is available in type III @-@ brown bottles with chil@@ d@@ proof poly@@ propylene connection cap with 30 , 50 , 60 , 100 , 120 , 150 , 225 and 300 ml . &quot;

&quot; immediately prior to application , the bli@@ ster must be carefully opened and the dosage of the Ly@@ op@@ hil@@ is@@ ats must be removed without dam@@ aging it . &quot;
clin@@ ically relevant interactions were not found in clinical studies with A@@ eri@@ us tablets in which ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were additionally applied ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; in clinical trials in various indications , including allergic r@@ hin@@ itis and chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , 3 % more adverse events were reported in patients with A@@ eri@@ us tablets daily than in patients treated with plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in a multi @-@ dose study , which were used up to 45 mg of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( nine @-@ time clinical dosage ) , no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed . &quot;
&quot; A@@ eri@@ us Ly@@ op@@ hil@@ is@@ at was well toler@@ ated in two single dose studies ; this was documented by clinical laboratory results , medical examinations , vital signs and EC@@ G @-@ interval data . &quot;
a statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described as part of a clinical trial with multiple dos@@ es in a dose of up to 20 mg daily for 14 days .
&quot; in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , in which des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was applied in a dose of 45 mg every day ( the nine times the clinical dose ) was applied over ten days , no extension of the Q@@ t@@ c interval demonstrated . &quot;
&quot; in controlled clinical trials , the recommended dosage of 5 m@@ g. daily did not cause increased inci@@ dence of drow@@ sin@@ ess compared to plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in a 17 single dose study with adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurement parameters of the flu@@ ids , including rein@@ forcement of subjective sleep@@ iness or the tasks associated with flying . &quot;
&quot; in patients with allergic r@@ hin@@ itis , A@@ eri@@ us tablets were effective in alle@@ vi@@ ating symptoms such as ni@@ esen , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , tear and red@@ ness of the eyes as well as it@@ ching on the pal@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; as shown on the basis of the overall cor@@ es of the questionna@@ ire for quality of life at Rhin@@ o @-@ con@@ jun@@ c@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us reduces the stress caused by seasonal hi@@ r@@ hin@@ itis . &quot;
&quot; 18 In a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics study , in which the patient demo@@ s were comparable with the general seasonal , allergic r@@ hin@@ itis population , a higher concentration of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was reached in 4 % of patients . &quot;

there is limited experience from clinical trials to be effective in the application of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in adol@@ esc@@ ents aged 12 to 17 ( see Sec@@ tions 4.8 and 5.1 )
&quot; immediately before application , the bli@@ ster must be carefully opened and the dose of the enam@@ el tablet should be removed without dam@@ aging it . &quot;
the efficacy and harm@@ lessness of A@@ eri@@ us 2.5 mg enam@@ el tablets in the treatment of children under 6 years have not been proven .
the overall frequency of the side effects between the des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine si@@ up@@ - and plac@@ ebo arm was the same and did not differ significantly from the safety profile identified in adult patients .
&quot; at the recommended dose , A@@ eri@@ us enam@@ el tablet proved to be a bio equivalent to the A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg conventional tablets form@@ ulation and the A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg Ly@@ op@@ hil@@ is@@ at for the acqu@@ iring form@@ ulation of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n . &quot;

&quot; the spread of this poor@@ ly met@@ abolic phen@@ otype was comparable to adults ( 6 % ) and pedi@@ atric patients between 2 and 11 years ( 6 % ) , and under bl@@ acks ( adults 18 % , children 16 % ) , the safety profile of these patients was not different from that of the general population . &quot;
&quot; in single dose crossover studies of A@@ eri@@ us enam@@ el tablets with A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg conventional tablets or A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg Ly@@ op@@ hil@@ is@@ at , form@@ ulations were bio@@ equivalent . &quot;
&quot; A@@ eri@@ us 2.5 mg tablets were not examined in pedi@@ atric patients , but in combination with the dose case studies in children , however , pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data for A@@ eri@@ us melting tablets support the use of 2.5 mg dosage in children from 6 to 11 years . &quot;

&quot; in an additional study , no side @-@ effects were observed in patients aged between 6 and 11 years at a single @-@ time dose of 2.5 mg of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n . &quot;
&quot; in the recommended dos@@ es , the plasma concentrations of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( see section 5.2 ) were comparable in children &apos;s and adult population . &quot;

&quot; in June 2008 , Nov@@ arti@@ s V@@ acc@@ ines and Diagnostics S.@@ r.@@ l. has officially approved the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) that the Company ref@@ uses to appro@@ ve A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov on the prevention of the avi@@ ary H@@ 5@@ N@@ 1 influ@@ enza in adults and elderly people . &quot;
&quot; A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov should be used in adults and elderly people to protect against flu , caused by the trunk ( type ) H@@ 5@@ N@@ 1 of the influ@@ enza A virus . &quot;
this is a special type of vacc@@ ine that should protect against a strain of the flu virus that could cause future pan@@ de@@ mic .
&quot; a flu pan@@ de@@ mic breaks out when a new strain of the flu virus emerg@@ es , which can easily spread from man to person because humans have not yet built immun@@ ity ( no protection ) on the other hand . &quot;
&quot; following the vacc@@ ine administration , the immune system det@@ ects the parts of the flu virus as &quot; &quot; foreign &quot; &quot; and forms antibodies against it . &quot;
this makes the immune system later able to make contact with an influ@@ enza virus of this common anti@@ body .
&quot; subsequently , the membrane cover of the virus with the &quot; surface anti@@ gens &quot; ( proteins on the membrane surface , which det@@ ects the human body as a foreign user ) , was cleaned , cleaned and used as a component of the vacc@@ ine . &quot;
inspection of some of the study sites showed that the study was not conducted in accordance with the &quot; Good Clinical Practice &quot; ( G@@ CP ) .
&quot; as a result , the scope of the clinical data base for evalu@@ ating the safety of the vacc@@ ine was not sufficient to meet the requirements of the E@@ MEA guidelines for pre @-@ pan@@ de@@ mic vacc@@ ines . &quot;
&quot; should you take part in a clinical trial and require further information about your treatment , please contact your doctor . &quot;
&quot; if you would like more information on the CH@@ MP recommendations , please read the scientific discussion ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) . &quot;
&quot; it is used in combination with other anti@@ viral drugs to treat adults and children over four years , which are infected with the human immun@@ o@@ deficiency virus type 1 ( HIV @-@ 1 ) , which is causing the acquired immun@@ o@@ deficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) . &quot;
&quot; for patients who cannot swal@@ low the capsules , as@@ gener@@ ase may be taken as a solution to take @-@ in , but this cannot be taken together with Rit@@ mon@@ avi@@ r because the safety of this combination was not investigated . &quot;
&quot; ap@@ gener@@ ase should only be prescribed when the doctor has checked , which anti@@ viral drugs used by the patient before , and the lik@@ el@@ ih@@ ood of the virus to respond to the drug . &quot;
&quot; the recommended dose for patients over 12 years amounts to 600 mg twice daily , taken together with twice daily 100 mg of k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and with other anti@@ viral drugs . &quot;
&quot; for children between four and twelve years old and in patients with a body weight of less than 50 kg , the recommended dose of as@@ pher@@ ase depends on the body weight . &quot;
as@@ gener@@ ase in combination with other anti@@ viral drugs reduces the amount of HIV in the blood and keeps them at a low level .
&quot; AIDS does not cure , however , can delay the damage to the immune system and thus also the development of HIV @-@ related infections and diseases . &quot;
&quot; A@@ gener@@ ase was studied in combination with other anti@@ viral drugs , but without Rit@@ mon@@ avi@@ r , in two basic studies of 7@@ 36 HIV @-@ infected adults who had previously not been treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; the drug A@@ gener@@ ase , enhanced with low dos@@ ed k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , was compared to 206 adults who used prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , with other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors . &quot;
the main indicator for efficacy was the proportion of patients with non @-@ det@@ ectable concentrations of HIV in the blood ( viral load ) or the change in virus burden after treatment .
&quot; in studies with patients who had previously had no prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , more patients had a viral load under 400 copies / ml than plac@@ ebo , but A@@ gener@@ ase was less effective than in@@ din@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; in children , A@@ gener@@ ase also reduced the viral load , but with the children who had previously been treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , only very few responded to the treatment . &quot;
&quot; in the study with adults who had previously been treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , the drug A@@ gener@@ ase increased the viral load after 16 @-@ week treatment as effective as other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors : &quot;
&quot; in patients with HIV , which was resistant to four other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , A@@ gener@@ a combined with Rit@@ mon@@ avi@@ r to a stronger viral load after four weeks than in the patients who continued their previous prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors : &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of A@@ gener@@ ase ( observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients ) are head@@ aches , di@@ arr@@ ho@@ ea ( di@@ arr@@ ho@@ ea ) , nau@@ sea ( nau@@ sea ) , vom@@ iting , skin r@@ ash and fatigue ( fatigue ) . &quot;
&quot; 2 / 3 A@@ gener@@ ase may not be applied to patients who may possibly be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , or any of the other ingredients . &quot;
&quot; ap@@ gener@@ ase may also not be used in patients , the St. John &apos;s wort ( a herbal supplement for treating depression ) or medicines that are also broken down in the blood and are harmful to high concentrations in the blood . &quot;
&quot; as with other medicines against HIV , patients who take ap@@ gener@@ ase are the risk of li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy ( changes in the distribution of body fat ) , oste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ sis , or an immune re@@ activation syndrome ( symptoms of an infection caused by the re@@ covering immune system ) . &quot;
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs used to treat HIV @-@ 1 @-@ infected adults and children over four years compared with the risks associated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors .
&quot; A@@ gener@@ ase is usually taken together with the phar@@ ma @-@ k@@ ine@@ tic amplifier Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , but the committee noted that the benefit of A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients who previously did not have prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors has not been proven . &quot;
&quot; A@@ gener@@ ase was originally licensed under &quot; extraordinary circumstances , &quot; as at the time of approval for scientific reasons only limited information was presented . &quot;
&quot; in October 2000 , the European Commission granted the Gla@@ x@@ o Group Limited to the company Gla@@ x@@ o Group Limited for the establishment of electricity in the entire European Union . &quot;
&quot; A@@ gener@@ ase is shown in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs to treat HIV @-@ 1 , prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors ( PI ) -@@ treated adults and children from 4 years onwards . &quot;
&quot; usually , A@@ gener@@ ase capsules should be given to the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic booster of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r together with low dos@@ es of k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 4.5 ) . &quot;
the use of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r should take place considering the individual viral resistance pattern and pre @-@ treatment of the patient ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the bio@@ availability of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r as a solution for inser@@ tion is 14 % less than am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r as a capsule ; therefore A@@ gener@@ ase capsules and solution are not inter@@ changeable on one milli@@ gram per milli@@ gram basis ( see Section 5.2 ) .
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase capsules is 600 mg am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r twice daily along with 100 mg of k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs .
&quot; 2 If amo@@ ase capsules are applied without the intensi@@ fying addition of Rit@@ mon@@ avi@@ r ( boo@@ ster@@ ling ) , higher dos@@ es of as@@ pher@@ ase ( 1200 mg twice daily ) must be applied . &quot;
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase capsules is 20 mg of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs up to a daily dose of 2400 mg am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r that should not be exceeded ( see Section 5.1 ) .
&quot; pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics , efficacy and safety of as@@ pher@@ ase in combination with low dos@@ es of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors were not investigated in children . &quot;
&quot; A@@ gener@@ ase is not recommended for use in children under 4 years , due to lack of data for harm@@ lessness and efficacy ( see Section 5.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; based on pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data , the dose of A@@ gener@@ ase capsules in adult patients with moderate liver function disorder should be reduced to 450 mg twice daily and in patients with severe liver function disorders to 300 mg twice daily . &quot;
&quot; the simultaneous application should be performed with caution in patients with mild or moderate cir@@ rho@@ sis , in patients with severe liver function disorder , it is contra@@ indicated ( see Section 4.3 ) . &quot;
ap@@ gener@@ ase may not be given at the same time with medicines which have a low therapeutic width and also represent sub@@ str@@ ates of the Cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 @-@ I@@ so@@ enzyme 3@@ A4 ( C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 ) .
herbal preparations containing car@@ ob ( hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) may not be applied due to the risk of reduced plasma concentrations and a reduced therapeutic effect of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r while taking am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( see Section 4.5 ) .
patients should be advised that as@@ gener@@ ase or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy does not lead to a cure of HIV infection and that they can continue to develop opportun@@ istic infections or other complications of an HIV infection .
the current anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including treatment with as@@ gener@@ ase prevents the risk of transfer@@ ring HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood .
&quot; usually , A@@ gener@@ ase capsules should be used together with low dos@@ es of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot;
patients suffering from chronic h@@ epatitis B or C and treated with anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy have increased risk of severe liver inci@@ dence with potentially fatal outcome .
&quot; for the case of simultaneous anti@@ viral treatment of h@@ epatitis B or C , please read the relevant information about this medicine . &quot;
&quot; patients with advanced liver function , including chronic @-@ active h@@ epatitis , show increased inci@@ dence of liver function disorders under an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy and should be monitored according to clinical practice . &quot;
simultaneous use of ap@@ gener@@ ase and k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r with flu@@ tic@@ as@@ one or other glu@@ co@@ cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ids that are metabol@@ ised by C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 is not recommended unless the possible benefit of a treatment out@@ weigh@@ s system@@ ic cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids effects including mor@@ bus Cus@@ hing and Supp@@ ression of the side ni@@ er@@ ase function ( see Section 4.5 ) .
&quot; since the metabolism of H@@ MG Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin is strongly dependent on C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 , simultaneous administration of ast@@ atin and sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin is not recommended because of the elevated risk of my@@ opath@@ ies including rh@@ dom@@ y@@ oly@@ sis . &quot;
&quot; 4 For some medicines which may cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects such as car@@ b@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cyc@@ lic anti@@ de@@ press@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under monitoring of the International Norm@@ alised ratio ) , methods are available to determine the active substance concentration . &quot;
patients who use this medicine at the same time may be less effective due to reduced plasma levels of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( see Section 4.5 ) .
&quot; due to the possibility of met@@ abolic interactions with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , the effectiveness of hormon@@ al contra@@ cep@@ tives may be altered , however the information is not sufficient to assess the type of interactions . &quot;
&quot; when meth@@ ad@@ one is given at the same time with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , the patients should therefore be monitored on op@@ pi@@ ate symptoms , especially if low dos@@ es of Rit@@ mon@@ avi@@ r are ad@@ ministered . &quot;
&quot; because of the potential risk of a toxic@@ ity due to the high prop@@ yl@@ eng@@ ly@@ col@@ ge@@ hal@@ ts of the A@@ gener@@ ase solution for inser@@ tion , this form of dosage is contra@@ indicated in children under an age of four years and should be applied with caution in certain other patient groups . &quot;
ap@@ gener@@ ase should be set in duration 5 if a r@@ ash of system@@ ic or allergic symptoms is accompanied or the mu@@ c@@ ous membran@@ es are involved ( see Section 4.8 ) .
&quot; in patients receiving anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia or an exac@@ erb@@ ation of an existing diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus was reported . &quot;
&quot; many patients had other diseases , whose therapy medications were required to be associated with the development of diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia . &quot;
&quot; B . higher age , and with drug dependent factors , such as a longer lasting anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and associated met@@ abolic disorders . &quot;
&quot; in h@@ amm@@ op@@ hil@@ es patients ( type A and B ) treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , reports of an increase in bleeding including spontaneous cut@@ aneous hem@@ at@@ omas and hem@@ o@@ thro@@ sis occur . &quot;
HIV @-@ infected patients with severe immun@@ o@@ deficiency can develop an inflammatory response to asy@@ mpt@@ om@@ atic or residual opportun@@ istic infections which lead to severe clinical conditions or deteri@@ oration of symptoms .
&quot; although a multi@@ fac@@ torial eti@@ ology is accepted ( including application of cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , alcohol consumption , severe immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression , higher Body @-@ Mass Index ) , cases of oste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ sis were reported in particular in patients with advanced HIV disease and / or long @-@ term application of anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) . &quot;
&quot; C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 sub@@ str@@ ates with low therapeutic width amo@@ ase may not be given at the same time with medicines that have a low therapeutic width , plus sub@@ str@@ ates of the Cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 @-@ I@@ so@@ enzyme 3@@ A4 ( C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 ) . &quot;
&quot; C@@ YP@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 sub@@ str@@ ates with low therapeutic width A@@ gener@@ ase with Rit@@ mon@@ avi@@ r may not be combined with pharmaceuticals , whose active substances are mainly conf@@ using via C@@ YP@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and for increased plasma levels associated with serious and / or life @-@ threatening side effects . &quot;
&quot; it has been shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes a 82 % reduction in the AU@@ C of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , which can lead to a vi@@ rolog@@ ical failure and resistance development . &quot;
&quot; in attemp@@ ting to compens@@ ate the reduced plasma levels by a dose increase of other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors in combination with Rit@@ mon@@ avi@@ r , very frequently adverse effects on the liver have been observed . &quot;
St. John &apos;s Wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) The ser@@ um mirror of Am@@ rit@@ avi@@ r can be hum@@ bled through the simultaneous use of herbal preparations with St. John &apos;s wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) .
&quot; if a patient receives St. John &apos;s wort , the Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r@@ spiegel and , if possible , check the viral load and susp@@ end the St. John &apos;s wort . &quot;
dose adjustment for one of the medicines is not required when nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r is ad@@ ministered together with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( see also E@@ f@@ avi@@ ren@@ z below ) .
&quot; 508 % increased , for C@@ max by 30 % , when Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was given in combination with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) . &quot;
&quot; in clinical studies dos@@ es of 600 mg am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r were applied twice daily and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice a day , which prove the efficacy and harm@@ lessness of this treatment schem@@ as . &quot;
52 % low when am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 750 mg twice daily ) was given in combination with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice a day ) .
&quot; the C@@ min values of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in plasma , which have been reached twice a day in combination of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg of Rit@@ mon@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) , are approximately 40 to 50 % lower than if am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) in combination with 100 mg k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is given twice daily . &quot;
&quot; dosage recommendation for simultaneous administration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and cal@@ et@@ ra may not be given , but it is recommended a close monitoring as the effectiveness and harm@@ lessness of this combination is not known . &quot;
&quot; no pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study was performed using di@@ dan@@ os@@ ine in combination with di@@ dan@@ os@@ ine , but is recommended for at least one hour due to the an@@ ta@@ zi@@ al component of Di@@ dan@@ os@@ in ( see An@@ ta@@ zi@@ da below ) . &quot;
&quot; therefore , in combination with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) no dose adjustment is required . &quot;
&quot; the treatment with E@@ f@@ avi@@ ren@@ z in combination with Am@@ rit@@ avi@@ r and Sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r is not recommended , since the exposure of both prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors would lower . &quot;
the effect of ne@@ vi@@ rap@@ in on other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors and existing limited data suggests that Ne@@ vi@@ rap@@ in may reduce the concentration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
&quot; if these drugs should be used at the same time , caution is necessary because Del@@ avi@@ r@@ din might be less effective because of the reduced or possibly sub@@ therapeutic plas@@ tici@@ zing bricks . &quot;
&quot; when these drugs are used together , caution is necessary ; a thorough clinical and vi@@ rolog@@ ical monitoring should be undertaken as an accurate pre@@ diction of the effect of the combination of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on del@@ avi@@ r@@ ine is difficult . &quot;
the simultaneous offering of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin led to an increase in the plasma concentration ( AU@@ C ) of Ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin by 193 % and thus to an increase in side effects associated with ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin .
&quot; if it is necessary for clinical reasons to admini@@ ster ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin together with as@@ gener@@ ase , a reduction in the dosage of ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin is advised to at least half of the recommended dose , even though there are no clinical data . &quot;
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic studies with as@@ pher@@ ase in combination with ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin were not carried out but the plasma levels of both drugs could be increased in case of simultaneous administration .
&quot; simultaneous usage of twice daily 700 mg F@@ os@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r and 100 mg k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol once a day resulted in an increase of the C@@ max of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole in plasma by 25 % and AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ τ ) to 2.@@ 69@@ x once daily without simultaneous use of F@@ os@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r with Rit@@ mon@@ avi@@ r observed . &quot;
&quot; other medicines listed below , including sub@@ str@@ ates , inhibit@@ ors or induc@@ tors of C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 , may lead to interactions together with a@@ gener@@ ase . &quot;
&quot; patients should therefore be monitored on toxic reactions , associated with these medicines , when used in combination with as@@ pher@@ ase . &quot;
&quot; based on the data of other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , it is advisable that ant@@ acids should not be taken at the same time as as@@ gener@@ ase as it can cause res@@ or@@ ption disorders . &quot;
&quot; simultaneous use of anti@@ con@@ vul@@ s@@ ants known as enzyme duc@@ tors ( phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , car@@ b@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine ) , with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r may lead to a degra@@ dation of the plasma level of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; the ser@@ um concentrations of calcium channel blocks such as Am@@ lo@@ di@@ pine , Dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em , Fel@@ odi@@ pine , Isra@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@
&quot; the simultaneous intake of as@@ gener@@ ase may significantly increase their plasma concentrations and ampli@@ fy side @-@ effects associated with PD@@ E@@ 5 inhibit@@ ors , including hyp@@ ot@@ en@@ sion , vision distur@@ bances and pri@@ ap@@ ism ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical study , in which Rit@@ mon@@ avi@@ r 100 mg capsules were given twice daily along with 50 µ@@ g flu@@ tic@@ as@@ on@@ pro@@ pion@@ ate in@@ tran@@ as@@ al ( 4 times daily ) over 7 days of subjects , the cor@@ ti@@ sol increased by about 86 % ( 90 % -@@ mean interval 82 to 89 % ) . &quot;
&quot; as a result , the simultaneous administration of asy@@ n@@ ase with k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r together with these glu@@ co@@ cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ids is not recommended , unless the possible benefit of a treatment out@@ weigh@@ s system@@ ic cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; H@@ MG Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors such as Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin , whose metabolism is strongly dependent on C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 , are expected to expect higher levels of plasma at simultaneous administration of a@@ gener@@ ase . &quot;
&quot; since plasma levels of these H@@ MG Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors can lead to My@@ opathy , including a rh@@ dom@@ y@@ oly@@ sis , the combined application of this medicine is not recommended with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; a more frequent monitoring of the therapeutic levels is recommended to stabili@@ ze the mirror , as the plasma concentrations of cy@@ clos@@ por@@ in , rap@@ am@@ y@@ cin and tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can be increased with simultaneous offering of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; therefore , as@@ gener@@ ase may not be used together with or@@ ally recorded Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am ( see Section 4.3 ) , while with simultaneous use of as@@ gener@@ ase with par@@ enter@@ al Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am caution . &quot;
data for simultaneous use of par@@ enter@@ al Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am with other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors point to a possible rise in the plasma level of Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am around the 3- to 4 @-@ cases .
&quot; when meth@@ ad@@ one is ad@@ ministered together with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , the patients should therefore be monitored on op@@ pi@@ ate symptoms , especially if low dos@@ es of Rit@@ mon@@ avi@@ r are ad@@ ministered . &quot;
&quot; because of the low reliability of historical compar@@ isons , no recommendation can currently be given , such as the Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r dosage is to be adjusted if am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is ad@@ ministered at the same time with meth@@ ad@@ one . &quot;
&quot; with simultaneous administration of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants together with A@@ gener@@ ase , an increased control of the IN@@ R ( International Norm@@ alised ratio ) is recommended because of the possibility of weak@@ ening or strengthening the anti @-@ thro@@ mb@@ otic effect ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; the effect of an additional administration of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on hormon@@ al contra@@ cep@@ tives is not predic@@ table , so alternative methods for contra@@ ception are recommended . &quot;
careful monitoring of the therapeutic effects and side effects of tri@@ cyc@@ lic anti@@ de@@ press@@ ants ( for example Des@@ i@@ pr@@ amine and Nor@@ tr@@ yp@@ ti@@ lin ) is recommended at the same time ( see Section 4.4 ) .
&quot; during pregnancy , this drug may only be applied after careful weighing of possible uses for the mother in comparison with possible risks for the fet@@ us . &quot;
&quot; in the milk lac@@ ing rats , am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r @-@ related substances were detected , however , it is not known whether am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r passes into mother &apos;s milk . &quot;
&quot; a reproduction study of pregnant rats , which was ad@@ ministered by the initi@@ ation into the uter@@ us until the end of the lac@@ tation period of Am@@ rit@@ avi@@ r , showed a dimin@@ ished increase in the 12 body weight in the offspring . &quot;
&quot; the further development of descendants , including fertility and re@@ productive capacity , was not affected by the administration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r to the mat@@ ernal animal . &quot;
the harm@@ lessness of as@@ pher@@ ase was studied in adults and children from 4 years in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs .
&quot; the side effects associated with the A@@ gener@@ ase treatment were mild to moderate , early on and rarely led to treatment . &quot;
many of these events are not clari@@ fied whether they are in connection with the intake of A@@ gener@@ ase or another medicine used at the same time or whether they are a consequence of the underlying disease .
&quot; most of the side effects mentioned below stem from two clinical trials ( PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 1 , PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 6 ) , in which prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors did not receive 1200 mg of ap@@ gener@@ ase twice daily . &quot;
&quot; events ( grade 2 to 4 ) , which were evaluated by the investig@@ ators as in connection with the study medication and performed in more than 1 % of the patients , as well as under the treatment of any laboratory changes ( grade 3 to 4 ) are listed . &quot;
&quot; anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy was associated with a re@@ distribution of the body fat ( li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy ) in HIV patients , including a loss of periph@@ eral and facial fat tissue , increased intra@@ abdominal and vis@@ cer@@ al fat tissue , hyper@@ tro@@ phy of breasts and dor@@ so@@ cer@@ vi@@ cal fat accumulation . &quot;
&quot; under 113 anti@@ retro@@ viral , non @-@ treated persons treated with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in combination with lam@@ iv@@ ud@@ ine / Zi@@ do@@ v@@ u@@ din over a mean duration of 36 weeks , only one case ( breast milk ) was observed ( &lt; 1 % ) . &quot;
&quot; in the study PRO@@ AB 300@@ 6 , at 245 N@@ R@@ TI@@ - previously untreated patients under Am@@ rit@@ avi@@ r 7 cases ( 3 % ) compared to 27 cases ( 11 % ) in 241 patients ( 11 % ) in combination with different N@@ R@@ TI@@ s over a mean duration of 56 weeks ( p &lt; 0,@@ 001 ) . &quot;
&quot; r@@ ashes were usually mild to moderate , ery@@ them@@ at@@ ous or ma@@ ku@@ lo@@ pap@@ ul@@ ously nature , with or without it@@ ching and usually occurred during the second treatment week and disappeared spont@@ an@@ eously within two weeks without the treatment with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r had to be broken off . &quot;
&quot; oste@@ on@@ ec@@ sis cases were reported in particular in patients with commonly known risk factors , advanced HIV disease or long @-@ term application of anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) . &quot;
HIV @-@ infected patients with severe immun@@ o@@ deficiency can develop an inflammatory response to asy@@ mpt@@ om@@ atic or residual opportun@@ istic infections at the time of initi@@ ating an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( see Section 4.4 ) .
&quot; with PI pre@@ treated patients who received 600 mg of ap@@ gener@@ ase twice a day together with low dos@@ ed k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) , were comparable increases of tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de and CP@@ K values that received chemotherapy together with low dos@@ ed rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , very often occurred . &quot;
&quot; in the event of over@@ dosing , the patient is to observe the signs of an in@@ toxic@@ ation ( see Section 4.8 ) if necessary , to initiate necessary suppor@@ tive measures . &quot;
&quot; Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r bin@@ ds to the active centre of the HIV @-@ 1 prot@@ ease and thus prevents the process of viral Gag@@ - and ga@@ g @-@ Pol@@ - poly@@ proteins with the consequence of a formation of un@@ ripe , non @-@ inf@@ ectious viral particles . &quot;
&quot; the anti@@ viral activity of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in vit@@ ro against HIV @-@ 1 II@@ I@@ B was studied both in acute and chronic lymp@@ ho@@ blas@@ tic cell lines ( MT @-@ 4 , CE@@ M @-@ C@@ CR@@ F , H@@ 9 ) as well as periph@@ eral blood lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes . &quot;
the 50 % inhibit@@ or concentration ( IC@@ 50 ) of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is in the range of 0.0@@ 12 to 0.0@@ 8 µ@@ M with acute in@@ infected cells and is 0.@@ 41 µ@@ M in cases of chron@@ ically infected cells
the connection between the activity of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r against HIV @-@ 1 in vit@@ ro and inhibit@@ ing HIV @-@ 1 rep@@ lication in humans is not yet defined .
&quot; in the treatment anti@@ retro@@ viral , non @-@ treated patients with the currently permitted F@@ os@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ mon@@ avi@@ r dos@@ es were observed - as with other k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r treatment schemes with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors - the described mut@@ ations rarely observed . &quot;
&quot; in six@@ teen of 434 anti@@ retro@@ viral , non @-@ untreated patients who received 700@@ mg F@@ os@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r with 100mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice a day in the ES@@ S@@ 100@@ 7@@ 32 study , a vi@@ rolog@@ ical failure occurred up to 48 , whereby 14 isol@@ ates could be studied gen@@ otyp@@ ically . &quot;
&quot; a gen@@ otyp@@ ic analysis of the isol@@ ates of 13 out of 14 children in which a vi@@ rolog@@ ical failure occurred within 59 patients with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , demonstrated resistance patterns that were similar to those in adults . &quot;
&quot; L@@ 10@@ F / I / V , V@@ 11@@ I , I@@ 13@@ V , K@@ 20@@ R , V@@ 32@@ I , L@@ 33@@ F , E@@ 34@@ Q , M@@ 36@@ I , I@@ 54@@ L / M / T / V , Q@@ 58@@ E , D@@ 60@@ E , I@@ 84@@ V , V@@ 82@@ A / I , I@@ 84@@ V , I@@ 85@@ V , L@@ 90@@ M and I@@ 93@@ L / M . &quot;
&quot; in the AP@@ V@@ 300@@ 03 study and its extension AP@@ V@@ 300@@ 05 ( 700 mg F@@ os@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r / 100 mg of k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily : n = 107 ) on with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors occurred in patients with vi@@ rolog@@ ical failure over 96 weeks , the following prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors : &quot;
gen@@ otyp@@ ic interpretation systems based on gen@@ otyp@@ ic resistance testing can be used to estimate the activity of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ mon@@ avi@@ r or F@@ os@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ mon@@ avi@@ r in patients with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors @-@ resistant isol@@ ates .
&quot; the current ( July 2006 ) AN@@ RS @-@ AC @-@ 11 algorith@@ m for F@@ os@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r defines resistance as the presence of mut@@ ations V@@ 32@@ I + 147@@ A / V , or I@@ 50@@ V , or at least 4 of the following mut@@ ations L@@ 10@@ F / I , L@@ 33@@ F , V@@ 82@@ A / C / F / G , I@@ 84@@ V and L@@ 90@@ M in combination with a gest@@ ed phen@@ otyp@@ ic resistance to k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and a reduced lik@@ el@@ ih@@ ood of a vi@@ rolog@@ ical response ( resistance ) . &quot;
&quot; the conclusions regarding the relevance of certain mut@@ ations or mut@@ ation patterns can be subject to changes due to additional data , and it is recommended to always draw up the current interpretation systems for the analysis of the results of resistance tests . &quot;
phen@@ otyp@@ ic interpretation systems based on phen@@ otyp@@ ic resistance tests can be applied in combination with the gen@@ otyp@@ ic data to estimate the activity of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ mon@@ avi@@ r or F@@ os@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ mon@@ avi@@ r in patients with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors @-@ resistant isol@@ ates .
companies that distribute diagnostic resistance tests have developed clinical @-@ phen@@ otyp@@ ic cut @-@ off@@ s ( divi@@ ding points ) for F@@ PV / R@@ TV which can be used to interpret the results of a resistance test .
&quot; each of these four with a reduced sensitivity to am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r associated genetic pattern creates a certain cross @-@ resistance to Rit@@ mon@@ avi@@ r , the sensitivity to inf@@ rin@@ avi@@ r , nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r and sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r remains in general . &quot;
&quot; there are currently data on the cross @-@ resistance between am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors for all 4 F@@ os@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r resistance paths , either alone or in combination with other mut@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; on the basis of twenty @-@ five anti@@ retro@@ viral , non @-@ untreated patients with which a F@@ os@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r ( one of 25 isol@@ ates ) , Dar@@ in@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 25 isol@@ ates ) , In@@ din@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 isol@@ ates ) , Sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 isol@@ ates ) and Ti@@ p@@ ran@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( four of 24 isol@@ ates ) . &quot;
&quot; conver@@ sely , am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r re@@ tains its activity against some other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors @-@ resistant isol@@ ates ; maintaining this activity seems to be dependent on the number and type of resistance mut@@ ations in the isol@@ ates . &quot;
early departure of a fail@@ ing therapy is recommended to keep the accumulation of a variety of mut@@ ations within limits which may have a det@@ ri@@ mental effect on subsequent treatment .
&quot; evidence of the effectiveness of A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice a day is based on the study PRO@@ 300@@ 17 , a random@@ ized open study , in which with PI pre@@ treated adults following vi@@ rolog@@ ical failure ( 100 mg twice daily ) and nucle@@ o@@ side miner@@ alog@@ y ( N@@ RT@@ I ) or a standard therapy ( standard of care , SO@@ C ) with a PI , predominantly with low dose Rit@@ mon@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; one hundred and six@@ ty ( n = 163 ) patients with proven virus sensitivity to a@@ gener@@ ase , at least another PI and at least one N@@ RT@@ I were included in the partial study A of PRO@@ 300@@ 17 . &quot;
&quot; the primary analysis showed the non @-@ su@@ peri@@ ority of AP@@ V / Rit@@ mon@@ avi@@ r compared to the SO@@ C PI group in the viral load ( A@@ AU@@ C@@ MB ) in the plasma after 16 weeks , with a non @-@ ser@@ m@@ ness threshold of 0.4 log@@ 10 copies / ml . &quot;
&quot; evidence of the effectiveness of untreated ather@@ oma is based on two un@@ controlled trials involving 288 HIV @-@ infected children aged between 2 and 18 , of whom 152 were pre @-@ treated with PI . &quot;
&quot; in the studies , A@@ gener@@ ase was tested twice daily , 20 mg / kg three times daily , 20 mg / kg twice daily , 20 mg / kg twice daily and 2@@ 2.5 mg / kg twice daily , whereby the majority of patients received 20 mg / kg twice daily . &quot;
it was not given a low dose of dos@@ es at the same time ; the majority of patients treated with PI had previously received at least one ( 78 % ) or two ( 42 % ) of N@@ R@@ TI@@ s ad@@ ministered together with ap@@ gener@@ ase .
&quot; after 48 weeks approximately 25 % of patients included in the study had a plasma HIV @-@ 1 @-@ RNA concentration &lt; 10,000 copies / ml and 9 % &lt; 400 copies / ml for a medi@@ an increase in CD@@ 4 cell count of 26 cells / mm ³ ( n = 74 ) compared to the initial value . &quot;
&quot; 19 Based on this data , the expected benefits of &quot; un@@ ble@@ ached &quot; a@@ gener@@ ase should be considered during the treatment optimization with PI previously treated . &quot;
&quot; after oral administration , the average duration ( T@@ MAX ) to the maximum ser@@ um concentration of Am@@ rit@@ avi@@ r is approximately 1 to 2 hours for the capsule and approximately 0.5 to 1 hour for the solution . &quot;
&quot; 508 % increased , for C@@ max by 30 % reduced , when Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was given together with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) . &quot;
&quot; administration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r with a meal leads to a 25 % decrease in the AU@@ C , but has no effect on the concentration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r 12 hours after dosing ( C@@ 12 ) . &quot;
&quot; therefore , the minimum concentration in the steady state ( C@@ min , ss ) remained un@@ affected by the intake of the food , although the simultaneous food intake affects the extent and rate of res@@ or@@ ption . &quot;
the apparent distribution volume amounts to approximately 430 l@@ tr ( 6 l / kg with a body weight of 70 kg ) and can be closed to a large distribution volume as well as an un@@ imp@@ eded penetration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r from the blood@@ stream into the tissue .
&quot; this change leads to a decrease in the total concentration of the active ingredient in the plasma , with the amount of un@@ bound am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r that represents the active portion probably remains unchanged . &quot;
&quot; while absolute concentration of un@@ bound am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r remains constant , the percentage of free active component fluctu@@ ates in dependence on the overall drug concentration in the Ste@@ ady State over the range of C@@ max , ss to C@@ min , ss . &quot;
&quot; therefore , pharmaceuticals , which in@@ duce or in@@ hi@@ bit or represent a sub@@ strate of C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 , must be given with caution when given at the same time with as@@ gener@@ ase ( see Sec@@ tions 4.3 , 4.4 and 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; the gift of A@@ gener@@ ase capsules , either 20 mg / kg twice or 15 mg / kg three times a day , results in a similar daily am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r exposure as in adults with a dose of 1200 mg twice daily . &quot;
am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is available from the solution 14 % less bio@@ available than out of the capsules ; therefore A@@ gener@@ ase solution and A@@ gener@@ ase capsules are not inter@@ changeable on a milli@@ gram@@ m@@ base .
&quot; the ren@@ al clearance of Rit@@ mon@@ avi@@ r is also neg@@ li@@ gible , so the effect of a ren@@ al dysfunction should be limited to the elim@@ ination of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
these regim@@ ens lead to Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r plasma levels comparable to those obtained on healthy volunteers after a dose of 1200 mg am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r twice a day without simultaneous administration of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
&quot; in long @-@ term studies on can@@ did@@ acy with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in mice and rats , male animals en@@ ig@@ ne h@@ ep@@ at@@ os@@ cel@@ ular aden@@ omas in dos@@ es containing the 2.0 @-@ fold ( mice ) or 3,@@ 8@@ - fold ( rat ) of exposure to humans , after twice daily gift of 1200 mg am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , correspon@@ ded . &quot;
the 21 underlying mechanism for the formation of h@@ ep@@ at@@ oc@@ ell@@ ular aden@@ omas and car@@ cin@@ omas was not yet elu@@ ci@@ dated and the relevance of these observed effects for humans is un@@ clear .
&quot; from the present exposure data on humans , both from clinical trials and therapeutic applications , however , there was little evidence of the adoption of a clinical relevance of these findings . &quot;
&quot; in a standard battery of in @-@ vi@@ vo@@ - and in vit@@ ro @-@ gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity tests , the bacterial reverse mut@@ ation test ( Am@@ es test ) , mice lymp@@ ho@@ m test , micro@@ nuclear test in rats and chromos@@ om@@ al ab@@ err@@ ation test in human periph@@ eral lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes , am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r was neither mut@@ iny nor gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic . &quot;
&quot; this liver toxic@@ ity can be monitored and proven in clinical routine by measuring AST , AL@@ T and the activity of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase . &quot;
&quot; until now , no significant liver toxic@@ ity was observed in patients , neither during the administration of A@@ gener@@ a nor after the end of the treatment . &quot;
studies on toxic@@ ity in young animals treated at the age of 4 showed a high mort@@ ality in both the control animals and the animals treated with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
&quot; in a system@@ ic plasma ex@@ position which was significantly below ( rab@@ bits ) or not significantly higher ( rats ) than the expected exposure to humans , however , a number of minor changes including thy@@ mus ong@@ ation and mar@@ ginal skel@@ etal changes have been observed , which point to a delayed development . &quot;
&quot; 24 When ap@@ gener@@ ase capsules are applied without the intensi@@ fying addition of k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( boo@@ ster@@ ling ) , higher dos@@ es of as@@ pher@@ ase ( 1200 mg twice daily ) must be applied . &quot;
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase capsules is 20 mg of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs up to a daily dose of 2400 mg am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r that should not be exceeded ( see Section 5.1 ) .
&quot; the simultaneous operation should be performed in patients with weak or mild liver function disorder , in patients with severe liver function disorder , it is contra@@ indicated ( see Section 4.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; 26 For some medicines which may cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects such as car@@ b@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cyc@@ lic anti@@ de@@ press@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under monitoring of the International Norm@@ alised ratio ) , methods are available to determine the active substance concentration . &quot;
ap@@ gener@@ ase should be set in duration 27 if a r@@ ash of system@@ ic or allergic symptoms is accompanied or the mu@@ c@@ ous membran@@ es are involved ( see Section 4.8 ) .
&quot; increased risk of li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy was associated with individual factors such as higher age , and with drug dependent factors such as a longer lasting anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and associated met@@ abolic disorders . &quot;
&quot; it has been shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes a 82 % reduction in the AU@@ C of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , which can lead to a vi@@ rolog@@ ical failure and resistance development . &quot;
&quot; 508 % increased , for C@@ max by 30 % , when Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was given in combination with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) . &quot;
&quot; the C@@ min values of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in plasma , which have been reached twice a day in combination of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg of Rit@@ mon@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) , are approximately 40 to 50 % lower than if am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) in combination with 100 mg k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is given twice daily . &quot;
&quot; dosage recommendation for simultaneous administration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and cal@@ et@@ ra may not be given , but it is recommended a close monitoring as the effectiveness and harm@@ lessness of this combination is not known . &quot;
&quot; the treatment with E@@ f@@ avi@@ ren@@ z in combination with Am@@ rit@@ avi@@ r and Sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r is not recommended , since the exposure of both prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors would lower . &quot;
&quot; when these drugs are used together , caution is necessary ; a thorough clinical and vi@@ rolog@@ ical monitoring should be undertaken as an accurate pre@@ diction of the effect of the combination of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on del@@ avi@@ r@@ ine is difficult . &quot;
&quot; if it is necessary for clinical reasons to admini@@ ster ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin together with as@@ gener@@ ase , a reduction in the dosage of ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin is advised to at least half of the recommended dose 31 , even though there are no clinical data . &quot;
&quot; the ser@@ um concentrations of calcium channel blo@@ ckers such as Am@@ lo@@ di@@ pine , Dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em , Fel@@ odi@@ pine , Isra@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , may be increased . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical study , in which Rit@@ mon@@ avi@@ r 100 mg capsules were given twice daily along with 50 µ@@ g flu@@ tic@@ as@@ on@@ pro@@ pion@@ ate in@@ tran@@ as@@ al ( 4 times daily ) over 7 days of subjects , the cor@@ ti@@ sol increased by about 86 % ( 90 % -@@ mean interval 82 to 89 % ) . &quot;
&quot; with simultaneous administration of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants together with A@@ gener@@ ase , an increased control of the IN@@ R ( International Norm@@ alised ratio ) is recommended because of the possibility of weak@@ ening or strengthening the anti @-@ thro@@ mb@@ otic effect ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
the simultaneous administration of or@@ th@@ o @-@ Nov@@ um 1 / 35 ( 0.0@@ 35 mg eth@@ in@@ yl est@@ radi@@ ol plus 1.0 mg of Nor@@ eth@@ ind@@ ron ) led to a decrease in the AU@@ C and C@@ min by am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r by 22 % respectively .
&quot; during pregnancy , this drug may only be applied after careful weighing of possible uses for the mother in comparison with the potential risks for the fet@@ us . &quot;
&quot; a reproduction study of pregnant rats , which was ad@@ ministered by the initi@@ ation into the uter@@ us until the end of the lac@@ tation period of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , showed a dimin@@ ished increase in body weight during breast @-@ feeding . &quot;
the harm@@ lessness of as@@ pher@@ ase was studied in adults and children from 4 years in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs .
&quot; in the event of over@@ dosing , the patient is to observe the signs of an in@@ toxic@@ ation ( see Section 4.8 ) if necessary , to initiate necessary suppor@@ tive measures . &quot;
&quot; the anti@@ viral activity of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in vit@@ ro against HIV @-@ 1 II@@ I@@ B was studied both in acute and chronic lymp@@ ho@@ blas@@ tic cell lines ( MT @-@ 4 , CE@@ M @-@ C@@ CR@@ F , H@@ 9 ) as well as periph@@ eral blood lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes . &quot;
the 50 % inhibit@@ or concentration ( IC@@ 50 ) of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is in the range of 0.0@@ 12 to 0.0@@ 8 µ@@ M with acute in@@ infected cells and is 0.@@ 41 µ@@ M in cases of chronic un@@ infected cells ( 1 µ@@ M = 0.@@ 50 µ@@ g / ml ) .
&quot; conver@@ sely , am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r re@@ tains its activity against some other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors @-@ resistant isol@@ ates ; maintaining this activity seems to be dependent on the number and type of resistance mut@@ ations in the isol@@ ates . &quot;
&quot; based on this data , the expected benefits of &quot; un@@ geb@@ oo@@ ster@@ tem &quot; a@@ gener@@ ase should be considered during the treatment optimization with PI previously treated . &quot;
&quot; while absolute concentration of un@@ bound am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r remains constant , the percentage of free active component fluctu@@ ates in dependence on the overall drug concentration in the Ste@@ ady State over the range of C@@ max , ss to C@@ min , ss . &quot;
&quot; therefore , pharmaceuticals , which in@@ duce or in@@ hi@@ bit or represent a sub@@ strate of C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 , must be given with caution when given at the same time with as@@ gener@@ ase ( see Sec@@ tions 4.3 , 4.4 and 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; also , the ren@@ al clearance of Rit@@ mon@@ avi@@ r is neg@@ li@@ gible ; therefore the effect of a ren@@ al dysfunction should be limited to the elim@@ ination of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; in long @-@ term studies on can@@ did@@ acy with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in mice and rats , male animals en@@ ig@@ ne h@@ ep@@ at@@ os@@ cel@@ ular aden@@ omas in dos@@ es that correspon@@ ded to the 2.0 @-@ fold ( mice ) or 3,@@ 8@@ - fold ( rat ) of exposure to humans after twice daily gift of 1200 mg am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
the underlying mechanism for the formation of h@@ ep@@ at@@ os@@ cel@@ ular aden@@ omas and car@@ cin@@ omas was not yet elu@@ ci@@ dated and the relevance of these observed effects for humans is un@@ clear .
&quot; however , from the present exposure data on humans , both from clinical trials and the therapeutic application , however , there was little evidence of the adoption of a clinical relevance of these findings . &quot;

studies on toxic@@ ity in young animals treated at the age of 4 showed a high mort@@ ality in both the control animals and the animals treated with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
&quot; these results indicate that in juven@@ iles the metabol@@ ites are not fully mature , so that am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r or other critical components of the form@@ ulation ( z . &quot;
&quot; A@@ gener@@ ase solution for inser@@ tion is shown in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs to treat HIV @-@ 1 @-@ infected , prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or ( PI ) -@@ treated adults and children from 4 years onwards . &quot;
&quot; the benefits of using Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r &quot; geb@@ oo@@ ster@@ ter &quot; A@@ gener@@ ase solution to take @-@ in was not covered either in patients treated with PI , nor patients treated with PI . &quot;
the bio@@ availability of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r as a solution for inser@@ tion is 14 % less than am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r as a capsule ; therefore A@@ gener@@ ase capsules and solution are not inter@@ changeable on one milli@@ gram per milli@@ gram basis ( see Section 5.2 ) .
patients should as soon as they are able to swal@@ low the capsules with taking the solution to take away ( see section 4.4 ) .
the recommended dose for as@@ gener@@ ase solution is 17 mg ( 1.1 ml ) Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight three times a day in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs up to a daily dose of 2800 mg of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r that should not be exceeded ( see Section 5.1 ) .
&quot; in addition , there must be no dosage recommendation for the simultaneous use of A@@ gener@@ ase solution for inhal@@ ing and low dos@@ ed k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , this combination among these patient groups must be avoided . &quot;
&quot; although a dose adjustment for am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is not considered necessary , an application of A@@ gener@@ ase solution is contra@@ indicated in patients with kidney failure ( see section 4.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; due to the potential risk of toxic reaction as a result of the high prop@@ yl@@ eng@@ ly@@ col@@ ge@@ hal@@ ts , as@@ gener@@ ase solution is contra@@ indicated in pregnant women and children under 4 years , in pregnant women , in patients with liver function or liver failure and in patients with kidney failure . &quot;
simultaneous administration may result in a competitive in@@ hibition of drug metabolism and may cause serious and / or life @-@ threatening side effects such as heart rhythm disorders ( z .
patients should be advised that as@@ gener@@ ase or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy does not lead to a cure of HIV infection and that they continue to develop opportun@@ istic infections or other complications of an HIV infection .
the current anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including treatment with as@@ gener@@ ase does not prevent the risk of treating HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood .
&quot; for some medicines which may cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects such as car@@ b@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cyc@@ lic anti@@ de@@ press@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under monitoring of the International Norm@@ alised ratio ) , methods are available to determine the active substance concentration . &quot;
ap@@ gener@@ ase should be set in duration if a skin r@@ ash is accompanied by system@@ ic or allergic symptoms or the mu@@ c@@ ous membran@@ es are involved ( see Section 4.8 ) .
&quot; increased risk of li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy was associated with individual factors such as higher age , and with drug @-@ 49 dependent factors such as a longer lasting anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and associated met@@ abolic disorders . &quot;
&quot; in h@@ amm@@ op@@ hil@@ es patients ( type A and B ) treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , reports of an increase in bleeding including spontaneous cut@@ aneous hem@@ at@@ omas and hem@@ o@@ thro@@ sis occur . &quot;
&quot; it has been shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes a 82 % reduction in the AU@@ C of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , which can lead to a vi@@ rolog@@ ical failure and resistance development . &quot;
&quot; 508 % increased , for C@@ max by 30 % , when Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was given in combination with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) . &quot;
&quot; the simultaneous intake of as@@ gener@@ ase may significantly increase their plasma concentrations and result in side @-@ effects associated with PD@@ E@@ 5 inhibit@@ ors , including hyp@@ ot@@ en@@ sion , vision distur@@ bances and pri@@ ap@@ ism ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;

the potential risk for humans is not known . A@@ gener@@ ase solution for inser@@ tion may not be applied during pregnancy due to possible toxic reactions of the fet@@ us ( see Section 4.3 ) .
&quot; in the milk lac@@ ing rats , am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r @-@ related substances were detected , however , it is not known whether am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r passes into mother &apos;s milk . &quot;
&quot; a reproduction study of pregnant rats , which was ad@@ ministered by the initi@@ ation into the uter@@ us until the end of the lac@@ tation period of Am@@ rit@@ avi@@ r , showed a dimin@@ ished increase in the 55 body weight in the offspring . &quot;
the harm@@ lessness of as@@ pher@@ ase was studied in adults and children from 4 years in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs .
many of these events are not clari@@ fied whether they are in connection with the intake of A@@ gener@@ ase or another medicine used at the same time or whether they are a consequence of the underlying disease .
&quot; in the treatment anti@@ retro@@ viral , non @-@ treated patients with the currently permitted F@@ os@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ mon@@ avi@@ r dos@@ es were observed - as with other k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r treatment schemes with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors - the described mut@@ ations rarely observed . &quot;
early departure of a fail@@ ing 60 therapy is recommended to keep the accumulation of a variety of mut@@ ations within limits which may have a det@@ ri@@ mental effect on subsequent treatment .
&quot; 62 Based on this data , the expected benefits of &quot; un@@ ble@@ ached &quot; a@@ gener@@ ase should be considered during the treatment optimization with PI previously treated . &quot;
the apparent distribution volume amounts to approximately 430 l@@ tr ( 6 l / kg with a body weight of 70 kg ) and can be closed to a large c@@ ous@@ ine volume as well as an un@@ imp@@ eded penetration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r from the blood@@ stream into the tissue .
the underlying mechanism for the formation of h@@ ep@@ at@@ oc@@ ell@@ ular aden@@ omas and car@@ cin@@ omas was not yet elu@@ ci@@ dated and the relevance of these observed effects for humans is un@@ clear .
&quot; in a system@@ ic plasma ex@@ position which was significantly below ( rab@@ bits ) or not significantly higher ( rats ) than the expected exposure to humans , however , a number of minor changes including thy@@ mus ong@@ ation and mar@@ ginal skel@@ etal changes have been observed , which point to a delayed development . &quot;

&quot; the application frequency and duration of the treatment with Al@@ dar@@ a depend on the disease to be treated . • In case of case @-@ specific cases in the genital area , the cream is up to a maximum of 16 weeks a week . &quot;
&quot; before bed@@ time , the cream is dil@@ uted to the affected skin areas so that it remains sufficiently long ( approximately eight hours ) on the skin before it is washed . &quot;
&quot; in all studies , Al@@ dar@@ a was compared with a plac@@ ebo ( the same cream but without the active ingredient ) . • Al@@ dar@@ a was tested in four basic studies of 9@@ 23 patients with war@@ ts in the genital area for 16 weeks . &quot;
• Al@@ dar@@ a was also examined in 7@@ 24 patients with small cell car@@ cin@@ omas in two studies where patients were treated for six weeks and al@@ dar@@ a or plac@@ ebo carried on either a day or five times a week .
&quot; the main indicator for the efficacy was the number of patients with complete healing of tum@@ ours after twelve weeks . • Al@@ dar@@ a was also tested in two studies on a total of 505 patients with ac@@ tin@@ ac ker@@ at@@ os . &quot;
&quot; in all studies , Al@@ dar@@ a was more effective than the plac@@ ebo . &quot;
the most common side effects of Al@@ dar@@ a ( observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients ) are reactions to the use point of the cream ( pain or it@@ ching ) .
&quot; clin@@ ically typical , not hyper@@ ker@@ at@@ ot@@ eric , not hyper@@ trop@@ hic hyper@@ trop@@ hic ker@@ at@@ os@@ os ( AK@@ s ) in the face or on the scal@@ p for immun@@ o@@ competent adults , if the size or number of les@@ ions limit the effectiveness and / or the acceptance of a cr@@ y@@ otherapy and other top@@ ical treatment options are contra@@ indicated or less suitable . &quot;
&quot; Monday , Wednesday and Friday or Tuesday , Thursday and Saturday ) before entering the bed and leave for 6 to 10 hours on the skin . &quot;
&quot; treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine cream can continue until all visible inc@@ lin@@ ers have disappeared in the genital or peri@@ anal region , or up to a maximum of 16 weeks per treatment period . &quot;
an inter@@ ruption in the treatment process described above should be considered when intensive local inflamm@@ ations occur ( see Section 4.4 ) or if an infection is observed in the treatment area .
&quot; if in the follow @-@ up examination 4 to 8 weeks after the second treatment period the treated les@@ ions are only completely healed , another therapy should be started ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; if a dose was om@@ itted , the patient sol@@ ed the cream once he / she noticed this and then proceed with the usual therapy plan . &quot;
&quot; I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine cream is applied in a thin layer and to be submitted to the cle@@ ans@@ ed , infected skin area , until the cream is fully absorbed . &quot;
&quot; in these patients , a treatment should take place between the benefits of a treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od and the risk associated with the potential wor@@ sen@@ ing of their auto@@ immune disease . &quot;
&quot; in these patients , a weighing occurs between the benefits of a treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od and the risk associated with possible organ rejection or gra@@ ft versus @-@ host@@ - reaction . &quot;
&quot; in other studies , in which no daily pre @-@ auth@@ y@@ gi@@ ene was performed , two cases of severe phi@@ mo@@ sis and a case with a circum@@ c@@ ision of leading stri@@ cture were observed . &quot;
&quot; with an application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream in higher than the recommended dos@@ es there is increased risk of serious local skin irrit@@ ation ( see section 4.2 . ) In rare cases , severe local skin irrit@@ ation has also been observed , which necess@@ it@@ ated a treatment and / or have led to temporary physical im@@ pair@@ ment . &quot;
&quot; in cases where such reactions occurred at the exit of the ureth@@ ra , some women had difficulty passing urine , which necess@@ it@@ ated emergency cath@@ eter@@ isation and treatment of the affected area . &quot;
&quot; for the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine , immediately following treatment with other cell @-@ based remedi@@ es for the treatment of external co@@ wards in the genital and per@@ anal region , no clinical experience exists . &quot;
&quot; limited data points to an increased rate of co@@ wards reduction in HIV @-@ positive patients , I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine cream has shown a lower efficacy in this group of patients with regard to the elim@@ ination of the co@@ wards . &quot;
&quot; the treatment of bas@@ al cell car@@ cin@@ oma with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od within 1 cm around the eyel@@ ids , the nose , the lips , or the hair approach was not examined . &quot;
&quot; local skin reactions are common , but the intensity of these reactions is generally decre@@ asing during therapy or the reactions are back after completion of the treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream . &quot;
&quot; if it is necessary due to the complaints of the patient or due to sever@@ ity of the local skin reactions , a treatment break can be made of several days . &quot;
the clinical outcome of the therapy may be judged after the regeneration of the treated skin approximately 12 weeks after the end of the treatment .
&quot; there are currently no data on long @-@ term cure rates of more than 36 months after the treatment available , other suitable forms of therapy should be considered in super@@ ficial cell car@@ cin@@ omas . &quot;
&quot; in patients with recur@@ rent and pre @-@ treated B@@ CC@@ s , no clinical experience exists , so the application is not recommended in pre @-@ treated tum@@ ours . &quot;
data from an open clinical study point out that in large tum@@ ours ( &gt; 7.@@ 25 c@@ m2 ) there is a lower lik@@ el@@ ih@@ ood of response to I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine therapy .
&quot; I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od was not examined for the treatment of acute not@@ ions on eyel@@ ids , inside the nose or the ears or on the lip area within the lip . &quot;
there are only very limited data about the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od for the treatment of acute in@@ cis@@ ions on anatom@@ ical positions outside the face and the scal@@ p .
&quot; the available data on the ac@@ tin@@ ac ker@@ ato@@ sis on the for@@ ear@@ ms and hands do not support the effectiveness of this purpose , therefore such an application is not recommended . &quot;
&quot; local skin reactions frequently occur , but these reactions usually take in the course of the therapy to intensity or go back after replacing the therapy with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream . &quot;
&quot; if the local skin reactions cause great dis@@ comfort to the patient or are very strong , treatment may be exposed for several days . &quot;
&quot; from the data of an open clinical study , patients with more than 8 active les@@ ions showed a lower complete healing rate than patients with less than 8 les@@ ions . &quot;
&quot; due to the immune @-@ stimul@@ ant properties , I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream should be applied with caution in patients receiving immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive treatment ( see 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; animal studies do not cause direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , chil@@ d@@ birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see 5.3 ) . &quot;

the most commonly reported and possibly or possibly with the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream in related adverse events in trials involving three times weekly treatment were local reactions at the site of the treatment of co@@ wards ( 33.@@ 7 % of patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od ) .
among the most commonly reported and considered prob@@ able or possibly with the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine cream related side effects include complaints at the application site with a frequency of 28.@@ 1 % .
the side effects reported by 185 with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od Cream from a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled clinical trial of Phase III reported side effects are shown below .
&quot; the most common , probably or possibly with the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine cream related side effects , in these studies were a response to the application location ( 22 % of patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od ) . &quot;
side effects that were given by 252 in plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled clinical trials of phase III with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine cr@@ è@@ me treated patients with ac@@ tin@@ ent ker@@ ato@@ sis are listed below .
&quot; according to the study schedule previous assessment of clinical evidence shows that in these plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled clinical trials of three times weekly treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od Cream , it frequently came to local skin reactions including ery@@ thema ( 61 % ) , exc@@ itation ( 30 % ) , exc@@ itation / dra@@ ining ( 23 % ) and ede@@ ma ( 14 % ) ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; according to the study schedule previous assessment of clinical evidence shows that in these studies with five times weekly treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od Creme was very common to severe ery@@ thema ( 31 % ) , severe ero@@ sions ( 13 % ) , and severe shr@@ ine formation and em@@ ulation ( 19 % ) . &quot;
&quot; in clinical studies to investigate the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od for the treatment of ac@@ tin@@ ac ker@@ ato@@ sis , Alo@@ p@@ eci@@ a was diagnosed with a frequency of 0.4 % ( 5 / 12@@ 14 ) at the treatment station or in the surrounding area . &quot;
&quot; acci@@ dental recording of 200 mg I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od , which corresponds to the content of approximately 16 bags , could result in nau@@ sea , vom@@ iting , head@@ ache , my@@ al@@ gia and fever . &quot;
&quot; clin@@ ically serious adverse event , which occurred after several oral dos@@ es of &gt; 200 mg , existed in hyp@@ ot@@ ony , which norm@@ alized after oral or intra@@ ven@@ ous fluid . &quot;
&quot; after the top@@ ical application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od , system@@ ic concentrations of alpha @-@ interfer@@ ons and other cy@@ tok@@ ines were detected in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic test . &quot;
in 3 pi@@ vot@@ al phases 3 efficacy studies could be shown that the effectiveness in relation to a complete healing of the co@@ wards during an I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od treatment over 16 weeks of a plac@@ ebo treatment is significantly superior .
&quot; at 60 % of the patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od , the co@@ wards healed completely ; this was the case at 20 % of the 105 patients with plac@@ ebo treated patients ( 95 % CI ) : &quot;
&quot; a complete healing could be achieved at 23 % of 157 with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od treated male patients , versus 5 % of 161 with plac@@ ebo @-@ treated male patients ( 95 % CI : &quot;
&quot; I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od &apos;s efficacy in five @-@ time application per week over 6 weeks has been studied in two double @-@ blind , plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled clinical studies . &quot;
the target tum@@ ors were hist@@ ologically confirmed single primary super@@ ficial bas@@ al cell car@@ cin@@ omas with a minimum size of 0.5 c@@ m2 and a maximum diameter of 2 cm .
&quot; the data presented from an open , un@@ controlled long @-@ term study after four years showed that about 7@@ 9.3 % &#91; 95 % CI ( 7@@ 3.7 % , 8@@ 4.@@ 9 % ) &#93; of all patients treated clin@@ ically were clin@@ ically healed and that remained for 48 months . &quot;
&quot; I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od &apos;s efficacy in three weeks of weekly application in one or two treatment periods of 4 weeks , interrupted by a four @-@ week , treatment @-@ free period , was examined in two double @-@ blind , plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled clinical studies . &quot;

the preliminary data from two combined observ@@ ational studies show a recur@@ rence rate of 27 % ( 35 / 128 patients ) for patients with clinical treatment after one or two treatment periods .
&quot; the permitted indications external co@@ wards , ac@@ tin@@ ac ker@@ ato@@ sis and super@@ ficial cell car@@ cin@@ oma usually do not occur in pa@@ edi@@ atric patients and were therefore not examined . &quot;

the efficacy of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od could not be shown in these studies in the dos@@ es examined there ( 3x / week for a period of ≤ 16 weeks respectively ) .
a minimal system@@ ic recording of the 5 % I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream through the skin of 58 patients with ac@@ tin@@ ent ker@@ ato@@ sis was observed in the three times weekly application during 16 weeks .
&quot; the highest drug concentrations in the ser@@ um at the end of the week 16 were observed between 9 and 12 hours and bow@@ ed 0.1 , 0.2 and 1.6 ng / ml in the face ( 12.5 mg , 1 bag ) , on the scal@@ p ( 25 mg , 2 bags ) and on the hands / arms ( 75 mg , 6 bags ) . &quot;
the calculated obvious half @-@ life was about 10 times higher than the 2 @-@ hour half @-@ time after sub@@ cut@@ aneous use in an earlier study ; this indicates an extended retention of the drug in the skin .
&quot; the data on system@@ ic exposure showed that I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od res@@ or@@ ption was low after top@@ ical application to MC @-@ dise@@ ased skin of patients at the age of 6 - 12 years , comparable to those in healthy adults and adults with ac@@ tin@@ ent ker@@ ato@@ sis or ultra @-@ fi@@ li@@ fic base cell car@@ cin@@ oma . &quot;
&quot; in a four @-@ month trial to color toxic@@ ity in rats , dos@@ es of 0.5 and 2.5 mg / kg KG were significantly reduced body weight and elevated Mil@@ z @-@ weight ; a study carried out for four months has no similar effects with the mouse . &quot;
a two @-@ year study of car@@ cin@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity in mice in three days per week did not in@@ duce tum@@ ors at the application point .
&quot; the corresponding mechanism is not known , but since I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od has only a low system@@ ic absorption of the human skin and is not mut@@ iny , there is a risk for humans to look at a very low level due to the system@@ ic exposure . &quot;
&quot; the tum@@ ors occurred in the group of mice treated with the active cream , earlier and in larger numbers than in the control group with low UV@@ R . &quot;
&quot; it may harm other people even if these have the same symptoms as you . − If any of the listed side effects you have significantly affected you or you notice side effects that are not stated in this use information , please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist . &quot;
● S@@ eig@@ ni@@ ces ( Con@@ d@@ yl@@ om@@ ata ac@@ umin@@ ata ) formed on the skin in the area of gen@@ it@@ alia ( sexual organs ) and anus ( anus ) ● Ober@@ fläch@@ liches bas@@ al cell car@@ cin@@ oma This is a common slow growing form of skin cancer with very low probability of spread to other parts of the body .
&quot; if it remains untreated , it can lead to distor@@ tions , especially in the face - hence early detection and - treatment is important . &quot;
&quot; ac@@ tin@@ ac ker@@ at@@ os are rough areas of the skin , which occur in people who were exposed to exposure to sunlight during their life . &quot;
Al@@ dar@@ a should only be used for flat ac@@ tin@@ ac ker@@ at@@ oses in the face and on the scal@@ p in patients with a healthy immune system where your doctor has decided that Al@@ dar@@ a is the most suitable treatment for you .
&quot; Al@@ dar@@ a Creme supports your body &apos;s immune system in the production of natural substances that help your body combat the super@@ ficial bas@@ al cell car@@ cin@@ oma , ac@@ tin@@ ac ker@@ ato@@ sis , or the virus responsible for infection with co@@ wards . &quot;
&quot; if you have used Al@@ dar@@ a cream or other similar preparations earlier , please inform your doctor about it before you start treatment . &quot;
&quot; in case of acci@@ dental contact , remove the cream by rin@@ se with water . o Do not use the cream in@@ war@@ dly . o Use the treated spot after applying Al@@ dar@@ a Creme not with a band@@ age or patch . o Falls reactions take place after applying Al@@ dar@@ a cream , wash the cream with a mild soap and water . &quot;
&quot; once the reactions are dropped , you can continue the treatment . &quot;
&quot; if this daily cleaning is not performed under the fores@@ kin , it can be used with increased inci@@ dence of swelling , th@@ inning of the skin or difficulties when with@@ drawing the fores@@ kin . &quot;
&quot; do not apply Al@@ dar@@ a Creme in the ureth@@ ra , in the vagina ( vagina ) , cer@@ vi@@ x ( cer@@ vi@@ x ) or inside the anus ( anus ) . &quot;
&quot; if other drugs have serious problems with your immune system , you should use this medication for no more than one treatment cycle . &quot;
if you have sexual intercourse with co@@ wards in the genital area intercourse is the treatment with Al@@ dar@@ a Creme after intercourse ( not before ) .
&quot; please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you use other medicines or applied recently , even if it is not prescription medicine . &quot;
breast@@ feeding your inf@@ ant during treatment with Al@@ dar@@ a Creme is not known as if I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od is su@@ prised in breast milk .
&quot; the frequency and duration of the treatment are different for co@@ wards , bas@@ al cell car@@ cin@@ oma and ac@@ tin@@ ac ker@@ ato@@ sis ( see specific instructions for each application ) . &quot;
&quot; apply a thin layer of Al@@ dar@@ a cream to the clean , dry skin area with the co@@ wards and rub the cream cau@@ ti@@ ously on the skin until the cream is fully absorbed . &quot;
men with co@@ wards under the fores@@ kin must withdraw the fores@@ kin every day and wash the skin area under them ( see section 2 &quot; What must you consider before applying algae cream ? &quot; ) .
please talk to your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you have the impression that the effect of Al@@ dar@@ a is too strong or too weak .
&quot; for 6 weeks , 5 days a week , a sufficient amount of Al@@ dar@@ a Creme will apply to cover the affected area and 1 cm around that area . &quot;
&quot; very common side effects ( expected for more than 1 out of 10 patients ) Frequ@@ ent side effects ( expected to be expected in less than 1 out of 10 patients ) , adverse side effects ( in less than 1 of 1,000 patients ) ) Very rare side effects ( in less than 1 of 10,000 patients expect ) &quot;
inform your doctor / health care professional or pharmac@@ ist immediately if you do not feel comfortable during the application of Al@@ dar@@ a Creme .
&quot; if your skin re@@ acts strongly to the treatment with Al@@ dar@@ a Creme , you should not use the cream to wash the affected skin area with water and a mild soap and communicate your doctor or pharmac@@ ist . &quot;
a reduced number of blood cells can make you more pr@@ one to infection ; it can cause you to create a blue stain from you or cause de@@ pl@@ ur@@ ness .
inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if any of the side effects you see significantly affects you or you notice side effects that are not stated in this use information .
&quot; in addition , you can feel it@@ ching ( 32 % of patients ) , burning ( 26 % of patients ) or pain in the areas you have applied Al@@ dar@@ a Creme ( 8 % of patients ) . &quot;
&quot; usually , it is lighter skin reactions that end up in approximately 2 weeks after the treatment of the treatment . &quot;
&quot; occasionally some patients notice changes to the place of application ( wound secre@@ tion , inflammation , swelling , red@@ ness , skin care , bu@@ bb@@ les , der@@ mati@@ tis ) or irrit@@ ability , nau@@ sea , dry mouth , flu @-@ like symptoms and fatigue . &quot;
&quot; occasionally , some patients suffer from changes to the place of application ( bleeding , inflammation , wound secre@@ tion , sensitivity , swelling , bleeding or dis@@ comfort ) , inflammation of the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a , c@@ logged nose , flu , or flu @-@ like symptoms , depression , eye irrit@@ ation , swelling of the eyel@@ ids , s@@ ore throat , fever , weakness or ch@@ ills . &quot;
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me is used for the enzyme therapy in patients with verified diagnostics of a Mu@@ cop@@ ol@@ ys@@ ac@@ chari@@ dosis I ( M@@ PS I ; α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase deficiency ) to treat the non @-@ neurolog@@ ical manifest@@ ations of the disease ( the symptoms that are not related to brain or nerves ) .
&quot; this means that certain substances ( gly@@ cos@@ amin@@ og@@ ly@@ can@@ es , g@@ ags ) are not degra@@ ded and thus accum@@ ulate in most organs in the body and damage them . &quot;
&quot; the following not neurolog@@ ical symptoms of the M@@ PS I can occur : enlarged liver , sti@@ ff joints that ag@@ grav@@ ate movements , decreased lung volume , heart and eye diseases . &quot;
treatment with al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should be monitored by a doctor who has experience in treating patients with M@@ PS I or other inher@@ ited met@@ abolic disorders .
&quot; the administration of al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should take place in a hospital or clinic with re@@ pa@@ iring equipment , and patients may need appropriate medicines prior to administration to prevent an allergic reaction . &quot;

&quot; the study mainly investigated the safety of the drug , but it was also measured its effectiveness ( by exam@@ ining its effect with regard to reducing G@@ MP concentrations in the urine and in relation to the size of the liver ) . &quot;
&quot; for children under five years , Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me decreased the G@@ AG concentrations in the urine by about 60 % , and half of the treated children showed a normal large liver at the end of the study . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in patients aged over five years ( observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients ) are head@@ aches , nau@@ sea , stomach pain , skin r@@ ash , ar@@ th@@ rop@@ athy ( joint pain ) , back pain , pain in the limbs ( in hands and feet ) , heat @-@ feeling , fever and reactions at the in@@ fusion site . &quot;
&quot; frequent side effects in patients under five years are increased blood pressure , reduced oxygen satur@@ ation ( a measurement size of lung function ) , t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia ( accelerated heart rate ) , fever and ch@@ ills . &quot;
&quot; Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me may not be applied to patients who may be highly hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase or any of the other ingredients ( an@@ ap@@ hy@@ la@@ k@@ tic reaction ) , not applied . &quot;
&quot; every year , the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( E@@ MEA ) will review all the new information that may be known , and if necessary to update this summary . &quot;
the manufacturers of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me will see patients receiving al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me regarding the reactions to the in@@ fusion and the development of antibodies .
&quot; in June 2003 , the European Commission granted approval to the company Gen@@ zy@@ me Europe B.@@ V. for the transport of all @-@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in the entire European Union . &quot;
Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is a re@@ combin@@ ant form of human α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase and is produced using highly combin@@ ant DNA technology using CH@@ O mamm@@ alian cell cultures ( Chinese hamster O@@ vary ) .
&quot; Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me is indicated for long @-@ term enzyme therapy in patients with backed diagnosis of a Mu@@ cop@@ ol@@ ys@@ ac@@ chari@@ dosis I ( M@@ PS I , α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase deficiency ) in order to treat the non @-@ neurolog@@ ical manifest@@ ations of the disease ( see Section 5.1 ) . &quot;
treatment with al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should take place by a doctor who has experience in treating patients with M@@ PS I or other inher@@ ited met@@ abolic diseases .
the initial in@@ fusion rate of 2 E / kg / h can be increased every 15 minutes in single steps to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h .
the safety and efficacy of dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in adults over 65 years has not been determined and no dosing schedule can be recommended for these patients .
the safety and efficacy of dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in patients with kidney or liver failure was not determined and for these patients no dosage schedule can be recommended .
&quot; with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , treated patients can develop in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions which are defined as any side effect associated with in@@ fusion or until the end of the in@@ fusion day ( see Section 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , especially these patients should continue to be closely monitored and the in@@ fusion of al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should only occur in an adequate clinical environment where re@@ vit@@ ational facilities are available for medical emer@@ gen@@ cies . &quot;
&quot; due to the clinical phase 3 study , virtually all patients are Ig@@ G antibodies against lar@@ v@@ ae , usually within 3 months from the beginning of the treatment . &quot;
&quot; patients who develop antibodies or symptoms of in@@ fusion @-@ related reaction must be treated with caution when using al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me ( see Sec@@ tions 4.3 and 4.8 ) .
&quot; since there is little experience regarding the recovery of the treatment after a longer break , the risk of hyper@@ sensitivity reaction has to be cau@@ ti@@ ously prec@@ eded after a dis@@ ruption of the treatment . &quot;
60 minutes before starting the in@@ fusion with medication ( anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines and / or anti @-@ py@@ re@@ tics ) to minimize the potential occurrence of in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions .
&quot; in case of mild or moderate in@@ fusion @-@ related reaction , treatment with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen should be sur@@ ged and / or reduction of in@@ fusion rate to half of the in@@ fusion rate in which the reaction occurred . &quot;
&quot; in case of a single , severe in@@ fusion @-@ related reaction the in@@ fusion must be stopped until the symptoms are reduced , a treatment with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen is to be considered . &quot;
in@@ fusion can be res@@ umed with a reduction in in@@ fusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the in@@ fusion rate .
3 are ( anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen and / or cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids ) as well as a reduction in in@@ fusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the in@@ fusion rate in which the previous response has occurred .
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should not be used simultaneously with chlor@@ o@@ qu@@ ine or pro@@ ca@@ ine because there is a potential risk of interference with the intra@@ cellular intake of lar@@ v@@ ae .
&quot; animal experimental studies do not imp@@ ly harmful effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth and post@@ nat@@ al development ( see Section 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; there are no data on new@@ bor@@ ns that were exposed to lar@@ v@@ asis over breast milk , is recommended , while the treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me is not breast@@ feeding . &quot;
&quot; the adverse events in clinical trials were mainly reported as in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions , which were observed in 53 % of patients in phase 3 study ( treatment duration of up to 4 years ) and 35 % of patients in the study involving participants under 5 years ( treatment duration up to 1 year ) . &quot;
adverse drug reactions in connection with al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me observed during the Phase 3 study and their extension in a total of 45 patients aged 5 years or older during a treatment duration of up to 4 years are listed in the following table : very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) ; frequent ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) .
&quot; in some patients with severe M@@ PS @-@ I @-@ related involvement of the upper respiratory tract and lungs in pre @-@ history , severe reactions arose , including bron@@ ch@@ os@@ pas@@ m , respiratory paraly@@ sis and facial ede@@ ma ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; children Un@@ wanted drug interactions in the context of al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , which were reported during a phase 2 study involving 20 patients aged under 5 years , with mainly severe exp@@ ir@@ ation and a treatment duration of up to 12 months , are listed in the table . &quot;
&quot; 100 E / kg intra@@ ven@@ ously once weekly ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intra@@ ven@@ ously once weekly , 200 E / kg intra@@ ven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intra@@ ven@@ ously every 2 weeks . &quot;
&quot; most patients were treated with a ser@@ o@@ con@@ version within 3 months after the beginning of the treatment , with a severe form of in@@ fusion in patients aged 5 and over ( average after 26 days versus 45 days in patients aged 5 and older ) . &quot;
&quot; until the end of the phase 3 study ( or until a premature departure from the study ) , 13 / 45 patients were not present through radio@@ immun@@ op@@ lan@@ c@@ itation ( RI@@ P ) as@@ say , including 3 patients , in which there was never a ser@@ o@@ con@@ version . &quot;
&quot; patients with low @-@ low anti@@ body levels showed a robust reduction in the G@@ AG mirror in urine , whereas in patients with high anti@@ body ti@@ ters a variable reduction of G@@ AG was observed in the urine . &quot;
four patients ( three in phase 3 study and one in Phase 2 study ) showed a mar@@ ginal to low neutr@@ alizing inhibit@@ ory effect on enzy@@ matic lar@@ on@@ id@@ as@@ e- activity in vit@@ ro which seemed to imp@@ air the clinical efficacy and / or reduction of G@@ AG in the urine .
the presence of antibodies did not appear to be related to the inci@@ dence of adverse drug reactions although the occurrence of adverse drug reactions typically coinci@@ ded with the formation of Ig@@ G antibodies .
the ration@@ ale for the enzyme therapy is in one for the hydro@@ ly@@ sis of the accumulated sub@@ strate and preventing further accumulation of sufficient restoration of enzyme activity .
&quot; after intra@@ ven@@ ous in@@ fusion , lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is quickly removed from the circulation and absorbed by cells into the lymp@@ ho@@ os@@ omes , most likely via Mann@@ ose @-@ 6 @-@ Phosph@@ ate rec@@ ept@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; the safety and efficacy of al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me were examined in a random@@ ised , double @-@ blind , plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled phase 3 study of 45 patients aged 6 to 43 years . &quot;
&quot; although patients were recru@@ ited for the study , which reported the entire spectrum of disease , the majority of patients from the middle phen@@ otype and only one patient showed the severe phen@@ otype . &quot;
patients were recru@@ ited if they had a forced exp@@ ir@@ atory volume ( FE@@ V ) of less than 80 % of the expected value and they had to be able to stand 6 minutes and walk 5 meters .
the primary end@@ points for the efficacy were the percentage change of the expected FE@@ V and the absolute distance in the 6 @-@ minute walk test .
all patients were subsequently recru@@ ited for an open @-@ label extension study where they received more than 3.5 years ( 182 weeks ) each week 100 E / kg of all dur@@ az@@ y@@ me .
after 26 weeks of therapy the patients treated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me showed an improvement in the lung function and the capacity described in the following table .
the open extension study showed an improvement and / or maintenance of these effects of up to 208 weeks in the Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me Group and 182 weeks in the plac@@ ebo / al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group resulting from the following table .
the decrease in the expected percentage of FE@@ V is clin@@ ically not significant over this period and the absolute lung volumes increased propor@@ tionally to the height of growing children .
&quot; from the 26 patients with a H@@ ep@@ atom@@ eg@@ aly before the treatment , 22 ( 85 % ) had a normal liver size until the end of the study . &quot;
&quot; within the first 4 weeks , a significant decrease in the G@@ AG mirror in urine ( µ@@ g / mg Kre@@ atin@@ ine ) was established , which remained constant until the end of the study . &quot;
&quot; in regards to the hetero@@ geneous disease manifestation between the patients , which was taken into consideration by using a combined repository ( expected percentage normal FE@@ V , distance in the 6 @-@ minute walk , range of the shoulder joint A@@ hi and visual acu@@ ity ) , there was generally an improvement in 26 patients ( 58 % ) , no change in 10 patients ( 22 % ) and a wor@@ sen@@ ing in 9 patients ( 20 % ) . &quot;
a year @-@ round open phase 2 study was conducted in which the safety and pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of all dur@@ az@@ y@@ me were examined in 20 patients at the time of their inclusion in the study under 5 years ( 16 patients with the severe exp@@ ir@@ ation form and 4 with the medium in@@ fusion form ) .
in four patients the dosage was increased due to increased Gag@@ - Mir@@ rors in Har@@ n in week 22 in the last 26 weeks to 200 E / kg .
&quot; in several patients , a size growth ( n = 7 ) and a weight gain ( n = 3 ) detected a normal mental development speed according to the Z score for this age group ( &lt; 2.5 years ) and all 4 patients with the middle course form showed normal mental development speed , whereas in the older patients with severe exp@@ ir@@ ation , there were only limited or no progress in cognitive development . &quot;
&quot; in a phase 4 study , studies on pharmac@@ o@@ dynamic effects of various al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me dosage schemes on the G@@ AG mirror in urine , liver volume and 6 @-@ minute test were carried out . &quot;
&quot; 100 E / kg intra@@ ven@@ ously once weekly ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intra@@ ven@@ ously once weekly , 200 E / kg intra@@ ven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intra@@ ven@@ ously every 2 weeks . &quot;
&quot; the dosage schedule with 200 E / kg intra@@ ven@@ ously every 2 weeks can represent a reasonable alternative in patients who have difficulty with weekly in@@ fu@@ sions , but it is not proven that the long @-@ term clinical efficacy of these two dosage schemes is equivalent . &quot;
&quot; the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( E@@ MEA ) will provide any new information that will be available each year , and if required , the summary of the characteristics of the medicinal product will be updated . &quot;
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic profile in patients at the age of 5 was similar to patients with older and less sever@@ ely affected patients .
&quot; based on conventional studies on safety har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in one @-@ time gift , toxic@@ ity in repeated gift and re@@ productive toxic@@ ity , prec@@ lin@@ ical data do not allow any particular haz@@ ards to humans . &quot;
&quot; since no compatibility studies have been carried out , this medicine may not be mixed with other medicines except those listed below 6 . &quot;
&quot; if the ready @-@ to @-@ use preparation is not used immediately , it is no longer than 24 hours at 2 ° C - 8@@ º C to store , provided the di@@ lution was performed under controlled and vali@@ dated as@@ ep@@ tic conditions . &quot;

&quot; within the given time , the owner of the authorisation has to complete the following program of study , whose results form the basis for the annual evaluation report at the benefit @-@ risk ratio . &quot;
this register will provide long @-@ term safety and efficacy information on patients treated with al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me as well as data on the natural progression of the disease in patients without this treatment .
&quot; in patients suffering from M@@ PS I , there is an enzyme called α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase that divi@@ des certain substances in the body ( gly@@ cos@@ amin@@ og@@ ly@@ can@@ e ) , either in a small amount or this enzyme is missing completely . &quot;
if you are allergic ( hyper@@ sensitive ) to any of the ingredients of al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me or if a severe allergic reaction to lar@@ v@@ ase has occurred .
an in@@ fusion @-@ conditional reaction is any side effect that occurs during the in@@ fusion or until the end of the in@@ fusion day ( see Section 4 &quot; What side effects are possible &quot; ) .
&quot; when using Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me with other medicines , please inform your doctor if you take medicines that contain chlor@@ o@@ qu@@ ine or pro@@ ca@@ ine , because there is a potential risk of dimin@@ ished effect of al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me . &quot;
&quot; please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you take other medicines or have recently taken , including prescription drugs . &quot;
instructions for handling - di@@ lution and application The concentrate for producing an in@@ fusion solution must be dil@@ uted prior to application and is intended for intra@@ ven@@ ous application ( see information for doctors and medical professionals ) .
the initial in@@ fusion rate of 2 E / kg / h can be increased every 15 minutes to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h .
&quot; in some patients with severe M@@ PS @-@ I@@ - conditional participation in the upper respiratory tract and lungs in the pre@@ history , however , severe reactions arose including bron@@ ch@@ os@@ pas@@ m , respiratory paraly@@ sis and facial ede@@ ma . &quot;
&quot; very common ( inci@@ dence of more than 1 out of 10 patients ) : • head@@ ache • nau@@ sea • pain • skin r@@ ash • joint pain • joint pain , joint pain , back pain , pain in arms and legs • elevated pulse • hyper@@ tension • less oxygen in the blood • Reaction at the in@@ fusion unit &quot;
&quot; the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( E@@ MEA ) will provide any new information that will be available annually , and if necessary , the package insert will be updated . &quot;
&quot; if the ready @-@ to @-@ use preparation is not used immediately , it is no longer than 24 hours at 2 ° C - 8@@ º C to store , provided the di@@ lution was performed under controlled and vali@@ dated as@@ ep@@ tic conditions . &quot;
preparation of the al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in@@ fusion ( using as@@ ep@@ tic technique ) • Dep@@ ending the number of di@@ lu@@ ent bottles to be dil@@ uted according to the body weight of each patient .
&quot; A@@ lim@@ ta is used together with cis@@ pl@@ atin ( another drug against cancer ) in patients who do not yet have chemotherapy ( drugs against cancer ) , and &quot; mal@@ ig@@ ne &quot; ( mal@@ ign@@ ant - cancer has already spread to other parts of the body ) . • advanced or metast@@ atic &quot; non @-@ small &quot; lung cancer , which does not attack the squ@@ am@@ ous cell cells . &quot;
&quot; A@@ lim@@ ta is used as sole therapy for patients who have previously not been treated , in combination with cis@@ pl@@ atin and in patients who have previously received other chemotherapy regim@@ ens . &quot;
&quot; to reduce side effects , patients should take a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid as well as fo@@ lic acid ( a vitamin ) during treatment with A@@ lim@@ ta and receive inj@@ ections of vitamin B@@ 12 . &quot;
&quot; if A@@ lim@@ ta is ad@@ ministered together with cis@@ pl@@ atin , before or after the administration of cis@@ pl@@ atin a &quot; &quot; anti @-@ course &quot; &quot; ( remedy for vom@@ iting ) and flu@@ ids ( to prevent a lack of fluid ) should be given before or after the administration of cis@@ pl@@ atin . &quot;
&quot; in patients whose blood pattern changes or where certain other side effects occur , the treatment should be pushed , canc@@ eled or the dose should be reduced . &quot;
the active form of p@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed slow@@ s the formation of DNA and RNA and prevents the cells from being divided .
&quot; the transformation of ph@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed into its active form is more easily accessible in cancer cells than in healthy cells , leading to higher concentrations of the active form of the drug and a longer active life in cancer cells . &quot;
&quot; for the treatment of the mal@@ ign@@ ant ple@@ ural end@@ othel@@ ial cell , A@@ lim@@ ta was examined in a main study of 456 patients who had previously received no chemotherapy against their disease . &quot;
&quot; in the treatment of non @-@ small cell lung cancer , the effects of A@@ lim@@ ta were compared to 571 patients with local advanced or metast@@ atic disease previously treated with chemotherapy with the effects of doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el ( another medicine against cancer ) . &quot;
&quot; A@@ lim@@ ta was also compared to gem@@ cit@@ ab@@ ine ( another medicine against cancer ) , both in combination with cis@@ pl@@ atin in a study of 1 7@@ 25 patients who previously had no chemotherapy for lung cancer . &quot;
&quot; patients treated with A@@ lim@@ ta and cis@@ pl@@ atin survived an average of 12.@@ 1 months , compared to 9.3 months at the sole administration of Cis@@ pl@@ atin . &quot;
&quot; in patients who had previously received chemotherapy , the average survival time with A@@ lim@@ a was 8.3 months , compared with 7.9 months in doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el . &quot;
&quot; in both studies , however , patients , in which cancer did not attack the squ@@ am@@ ous cell cells , had prolonged survival times in the administration of A@@ lim@@ ta than with the compar@@ ative medicine . &quot;
&quot; in September 2004 , the European Commission granted approval to the company Eli Lil@@ ly Neder@@ land B.@@ V. to appro@@ ve A@@ lim@@ ta in the entire European Union . &quot;
each water bottle must be dissolved with 4.2 ml 0.@@ 9 % sodium chlori@@ de injection ( 9 mg / ml ) which results in a resolution of 25 mg / ml .
the corresponding volume of the required dosage is extracted from the water bottle and dil@@ uted to 100 ml with 0.9 % sodium chlori@@ de injection ( see Section 6.6 ) .
AL@@ IM@@ TA is shown in combination with cis@@ pl@@ atin for first @-@ line treatment of patients with locally advanced or metast@@ atic non @-@ small cell lung cancer ( see Section 5.1 ) .
&quot; AL@@ IM@@ TA in mon@@ otherapy is indicated for the treatment in second @-@ line treatment of patients with lo@@ - , advanced or metast@@ atic non @-@ small cell lung cancer ( see Section 5.1 ) . &quot;
the recommended dose of AL@@ IM@@ TA 500 mg / m ² of body surface ( KO@@ F ) is given as intra@@ ven@@ ous in@@ fusion over a period of 10 minutes on the first day of every 21 @-@ day treatment cycle .
the recommended dose of cis@@ pl@@ atin is 75 mg / m ² KO@@ F as in@@ fusion over a period of 2 hours approximately 30 minutes after completion of the P@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed@@ - In@@ fusion on the first day of every 21 @-@ day treatment cycle .
&quot; in patients with non@@ small bron@@ chi@@ al cancer following previous chemotherapy , the recommended dose of AL@@ IM@@ TA 500 mg / m ² KO@@ F is given as intra@@ ven@@ ous in@@ fusion over a period of 10 minutes on the first day of each 21 @-@ day treatment cycle . &quot;
&quot; in order to reduce the frequency and sever@@ ity of skin reactions , a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid must be given the day before and on the day after the treatment . &quot;
&quot; during the seven days before the first dose of ph@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed , at least 5 dos@@ es of fo@@ lic acid must be taken and the intake must continue throughout the therapy period as well as for another 21 days after the last tel@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed dose . &quot;
patients must also receive an in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular injection of vitamin B@@ 12 ( 1000 mc@@ g ) in the week before the first tel@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed dose as well as after each third processing cycle .
&quot; in patients receiving tel@@ emet@@ ery@@ x@@ ed , a complete blood pattern should be created before each gift , including a differentiation of leu@@ k@@ oc@@ ytes and a plat@@ el@@ et counting . &quot;
&quot; alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase ( AP ) , as@@ part@@ ate trans@@ amin@@ ase ( AST or S@@ GO@@ T ) and Alan@@ ine @-@ Trans@@ amin@@ ase ( AL@@ T or S@@ GP@@ T ) should be ≤ 3 times of the upper limit value . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of a new treatment cycle , a dose examination must take place under consideration of the N@@ adi@@ rs of the blood pattern or the maximum non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity of the previous therapy cycles . &quot;
&quot; after recovery , patients must be treated according to the indications in tables 1 , 2 and 3 which are used for AL@@ IM@@ TA as mon@@ otherapy or in combination with cis@@ pl@@ atin . &quot;
these criteria meet the definition of the National Cancer Institute Common Tox@@ ic@@ ity C@@ rit@@ eria ( C@@ TC v@@ 2.0 ; N@@ CI 1998 ) ≥ C@@ TC Level 2 Ble@@ eding .
&quot; should patients develop non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ologic toxic@@ ity ≥ degree 3 ( except neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity ) , therapy must be interrupted with AL@@ IM@@ TA until the patient has the value before treatment &quot;
&quot; treatment with AL@@ IM@@ TA must be abor@@ ted if in patients after 2 dose reduction , an hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity or non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity grade 3 or 4 occurs or so@@ - continues at the occurrence of degrees 3 or 4 neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity . &quot;
clinical trials showed no indication that patients aged 65 years of age or above have an increased risk of side effects compared to patients at the age of 65 .
AL@@ IM@@ TA is not recommended for use in children under 18 years due to insufficient data for harm@@ lessness and efficacy .
in clinical trials in patients with a cre@@ atin@@ ine @-@ clear@@ ance of ≥ 45 ml / min there were no dose adjustments that go beyond the dose adjustments recommended for all patients .
the data layer in patients with a cre@@ atin@@ ine clearance of less than 45 ml / min was not sufficient ; therefore the application is not recommended ( see Section 4.4 ) .
&quot; however , patients with liver function restriction of &gt; the 1.5 @-@ fold of the upper limit value and / or trans@@ amin@@ ase values of &gt; of the upper limit value ( in case of liver metast@@ ases ) or &gt; 5.0 @-@ fold of the upper limit value ( for liver metast@@ ases ) is not specifically investigated in the studies . &quot;
patients must be monitored with regard to bone mar@@ row supp@@ ression and p@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed must not be ad@@ ministered to patients before their absolute neutr@@ ality has reached a value of ≥ 1500 cells / mm ³ and the plat@@ el@@ et number once again has reached a value of ≥ 100.000 cells / mm ³ .
&quot; dose reduction for further cycles is based on the Na@@ dir of absolute neut@@ ro@@ phil@@ es , th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ te number and maximum non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity as observed in previous treatment cycles ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; a lower toxic@@ ity and a reduction of grade 3 / 4 hem@@ at@@ ologic and ni@@ chth@@ on@@ mat@@ ological toxic@@ ity such as neut@@ rop@@ enia , f@@ eb@@ r@@ ile neut@@ rop@@ enia and infection with grade 3 / 4 neut@@ rop@@ enia was considered to be considered , when pre @-@ treatment with fo@@ lic acid and vitamin B@@ 12 had taken place . &quot;
&quot; therefore , all patients treated with p@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed must be used to apply fo@@ lic acid and vitamin B@@ 12 as a proph@@ yl@@ actic measure to reduce treatment @-@ related toxic@@ ity ( see Section 4.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; patients with mild to moderate ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency ( N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds ) such as i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen and acet@@ yl@@ s@@ ali@@ - c@@ yl@@ oric acid ( &gt; 1,3 g daily ) must be avoided for at least 2 days before the therapy , at least 2 days after therapy with p@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed ( see Section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; all patients , for whom a therapy with p@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed is fores@@ een , need to avoid taking N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds with long half @-@ value for at least 5 days before the therapy , and at least 2 days after therapy with p@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed ( see Section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; many patients in which these events occurred were appropriate risk factors for the occurrence of ren@@ al events , including de@@ hydr@@ ation , pre @-@ existing hyper@@ tension or diabetes . &quot;
&quot; therefore , in patients with clin@@ ically significant fluid accum@@ ulations in the trans@@ cellular space , a drainage of the result should be sur@@ ged from the tel@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed treatment . &quot;
&quot; 5 major cardiovascular events , including m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction , and cer@@ eb@@ rov@@ ascular events have been reported in clinical trials with p@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed occasionally when this ingredient is usually ad@@ ministered in combination with another cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic drug . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , the simultaneous application of atten@@ u@@ ated life vacc@@ ines ( except yellow fever , this vacc@@ ination is contra@@ indicated ) is not recommended ( see Section 4.3 and 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; as the possibility of irre@@ ver@@ sible cran@@ king of the re@@ productive capacity is made by P@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed , men should be advised in front of the treatment arm to obtain advice in regard to the locking of sperm . &quot;
&quot; in patients with normal kidney function ( cre@@ atin@@ ine clearance ≥ 80 ml / min ) high dos@@ es of non @-@ ster@@ o@@ idal anti@@ ph@@ log@@ is@@ tica ( N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds , such as i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen &gt; 1600 mg / day ) and acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ icy@@ lic acid in high dos@@ es ( ≥ 1,3 g daily ) lead to a reduced p@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed ex@@ cre@@ tion with the consequence of an increased occurrence of side effects . &quot;
&quot; therefore , caution is recommended if in patients with normal kidney function ( cre@@ atin@@ ine clearance ≥ 80 ml / min ) high dos@@ es of N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds or A@@ ce@@ - t@@ yl@@ sal@@ icy@@ lic acid are used in high dos@@ es . &quot;
&quot; ( i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ) or acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ icy@@ lic acid in high dos@@ es for at least 2 days before the therapy , at the day of therapy and mind@@ - tens 2 days after therapy with p@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed should be avoided ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; since there are no data concerning the interaction potential associated with N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds with a long half @-@ value such as pi@@ ro@@ - x@@ ic@@ am or ro@@ fec@@ oxi@@ b , the simultaneous use with P@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed must be avoided at least 5 days before the therapy , and at least 2 days after the therapy with P@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed x@@ ed . &quot;
the large in@@ tra @-@ individual vari@@ ability of co@@ ag@@ ulation status during the disease and the possibility of interactions between oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ an@@ cia and ant@@ ine@@ oplas@@ tic chemotherapy requires an increased monitoring frequency of IN@@ R ( International Norm@@ alised ratio ) when the decision was made to treat the patient with oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants .
&quot; there are no data for the use of P@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed in pregnant women , but as with an@@ de@@ - ren An@@ tim@@ etab@@ ol@@ ites , severe birth defects are expected in pregnancy . &quot;
emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed must not be used during pregnancy except if necessary and after careful weighing of the user for the mother and the risk for the fo@@ et@@ us ( see Section 4.4 ) .
&quot; as the possibility of irre@@ ver@@ sible damage to the re@@ productive capacity is made by P@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed , men should be advised before the start of the treatment to obtain advice regarding the sper@@ ma@@ contamination . &quot;
it is not known whether p@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed enters the mother &apos;s milk and undes@@ irable effects in the breast@@ fed inf@@ ant cannot be ruled out .

&quot; clinical relevant laboratory toxic@@ ity grade 3 and 4 was similar to phase 2 in the conden@@ sed results of three single p@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed mon@@ otherapy studies ( n = 164 ) , except neut@@ rop@@ enia ( 12.@@ 8 % compared to 5.3 % ) and an increase in the alan@@ ine trans@@ amin@@ ase ( 15.@@ 2 % compared to 1.9 % ) . &quot;
these differences are likely to lead to differences in the patient population as the Phase 2 studies included both chem@@ on@@ ai@@ ve and significantly pre @-@ treated breast cancer patients with existing liver metast@@ ases and / or abnormal initial values of liver function tests .

&quot; clinical trials often reported cases of co@@ li@@ tis ( including intestinal and rec@@ tal bleeding , sometimes fatal , intestinal per@@ fo@@ - ration , intestinal nec@@ ro@@ sis and ty@@ ph@@ li@@ tis ) . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials , patients with a tel@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed treatment were occasionally reported cases of sometimes fatal inter@@ sti@@ tial pneum@@ oni@@ tis with respiratory in@@ suffici@@ ency . &quot;
it has been reported on cases of acute ren@@ al failure in tel@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed mon@@ otherapy or in combination with other chemotherapy ( see Section 4.4 ) .
cases of radiation pneum@@ oni@@ tis were reported in patients who were treated before , during or after their p@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed therapy ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; AL@@ IM@@ TA ( P@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed ) is a ant@@ ine@@ oplas@@ tic anti@@ fol@@ ate , which performs its effect by refra@@ ining important fol@@ ly @-@ dependent met@@ abolic processes necessary for cell rep@@ lication . &quot;
&quot; in vit@@ ro studies showed that P@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed acts as an anti@@ fol@@ ate with several contact points by blocking the thy@@ mi@@ dy@@ lat@@ sy@@ th@@ ase ( TS ) , D@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ logical @-@ reduc@@ t@@ ase ( GAR@@ FT ) and gly@@ cin@@ amide ri@@ bon@@ u@@ cle@@ ot@@ id@@ for@@ - m@@ yl@@ transfer@@ ase ( GAR@@ FT ) , the fold @-@ dependent key enzymes of the de nov@@ o Bios@@ yn@@ thesis of thy@@ mid@@ in- and pur@@ inn@@ u@@ cle@@ oti@@ des . &quot;
&quot; EMP@@ H@@ AC@@ IS , a multi @-@ cent@@ ric , random@@ ised , easy @-@ blind phase 3 study of AL@@ IM@@ TA plus cis@@ pl@@ atin against cis@@ pl@@ atin in chem@@ on@@ ai@@ ven patients with mal@@ ign@@ ant ple@@ ural end@@ othel@@ i@@ oma showed that patients treated with AL@@ IM@@ TA and cis@@ pl@@ atin had a clin@@ ically significant advantage of a medi@@ an 2.8 @-@ month survival compared to those patients who were only cau@@ ti@@ led with cis@@ pl@@ atin . &quot;
the primary analysis of this study was performed in the population of all patients receiving the test medication in the treatment arm ( random@@ ised and treated ) .
a statisti@@ cally significant improvement of clin@@ ically relevant symptoms ( pain and dy@@ sp@@ no@@ ea ) in connection with the mal@@ ign@@ ant ple@@ ural end@@ othel@@ i@@ oma was shown in the AL@@ IM@@ TA / cis@@ pl@@ atin arm ( 212 patients ) compared to the normal cis@@ tic@@ ist arm ( 218 patients ) .
the differences between the two arms have been improved by improving the lung function parameters in AL@@ IM@@ TA / cis@@ pl@@ atin arm and a wor@@ sen@@ ing of the lung function over time in control .
&quot; a multic@@ enter , random@@ ised , open phase III study with AL@@ IM@@ TA versus doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el in patients with locally advanced or metast@@ atic N@@ SC@@ LC after previous chemotherapy was diagnosed with a medi@@ an survival time of 8.3 months ( Int@@ ent to treat Pop@@ ulation n = 283 ) and 9 months in patients treated with doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el ( IT@@ T n = 288 ) . &quot;
&quot; an analysis of the influence of hist@@ ology on the overall survival effect on the overall survival fell to favor of AL@@ IM@@ TA in patients with N@@ SC@@ LC ( n = 399 , 9.3 versus 8.0 months , adapted HR = 0.@@ 78 ; 95 % CI = 0,@@ 61 @-@ 1,00 , p = 0.0@@ 47 ) , in patients with squ@@ am@@ ous cell car@@ cin@@ om@@ hist@@ ology in favour of do@@ x@@ et@@ ax@@ el ( n = 1,@@ 56 ; 95 % CI = 1,@@ 08 @-@ 2,@@ 26 , p = 0,@@ 018 ) . &quot;
limited data of a separately random@@ ised controlled Phase 3 study show that efficacy data ( survival and progression @-@ free survival ) for p@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed are similar to patients with ( n = 41 ) and without ( n = 540 ) pre @-@ treatment by doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el .

&quot; the analysis of the influence of N@@ SC@@ LC Hist@@ ology to survival showed clin@@ ically relevant differences according to hist@@ ology , see table below . &quot;
&quot; CI = Con@@ fi@@ dence interval ; IT@@ T = intent @-@ to @-@ treat ; N = size of the total population a statisti@@ c significant for non @-@ su@@ peri@@ ority , with a total counter interval for HR ( = Haz@@ ard ratio ) clearly below the non @-@ le@@ gen@@ ness limit of 1,@@ 17@@ 645 ( p &lt; 0,@@ 001 ) . &quot;
&quot; patients treated with AL@@ IM@@ TA and cis@@ pl@@ atin were less trans@@ fu@@ sions ( 16.@@ 4 % versus 28.@@ 9 % , p &lt; 0.0@@ 01 ) , ery@@ thro@@ cy@@ te trans@@ fu@@ sions ( 16.@@ 1 % versus 27.@@ 3 % , p &lt; 0.0@@ 01 ) and th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ te trans@@ fu@@ sions ( 1.8 % versus 4.5 % , p = 0.0@@ 02 ) . &quot;

the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of P@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed as a mon@@ otherap@@ ic were examined in 426 cancer patients with different solid tum@@ ours in dos@@ es of 0.2 to 8@@ 38 mg / m ² in in@@ fu@@ si@@ - and over a period of 10 minutes .
emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed is mainly recovered in the urine and 70 % to 90 % of the ad@@ ministered dose will be found unchanged in the urine within 24 hours of application .
emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed has a total capacity of 9@@ 1.8 ml / min and the half @-@ value in plasma is 3.5 hours in patients with normal kidney fun@@ tion ( cre@@ atin@@ ine Clear@@ ance 90 ml / min ) .
&quot; in a study with Be@@ agle dogs , which had received intra@@ ven@@ ous bol@@ us inj@@ ections for 9 months , tes@@ tic@@ ular changes were observed ( dex@@ tr@@ ation / nec@@ ro@@ sis of the sem@@ ini@@ fer@@ ous epithel@@ ial tissue ) . &quot;
&quot; if not applied , the storage times and conditions after preparation are in the user &apos;s responsibility and should normally not exceed 24 hours at 2 to 8 ° C unless the preparation / di@@ lution has taken place under controlled and vali@@ dated as@@ ep@@ tic conditions . &quot;
&quot; dis@@ solve the content of the 100 mg injection bottles with 4.2 ml of 0.9 % sodium chlori@@ de injection ( 9 mg / ml ) without preser@@ v@@ ative , resulting in a solution with a concentration of about 25 mg / ml p@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed . &quot;

AL@@ IM@@ TA 100 mg of powder for the production of an in@@ fusion sol@@ der AL@@ IM@@ TA 500 mg powder for the production of a concentrate for the production of in@@ fusion sol@@ dering
&quot; AL@@ IM@@ TA is used in patients who do not receive previous chemotherapy , used to treat mal@@ ign@@ ant ple@@ ural end@@ othel@@ i@@ oma ( mal@@ ign@@ ant disease of the ri@@ b model ) in combination with cis@@ pl@@ atin , another drug for the treatment of cancer diseases . &quot;
&quot; if you have kidney disease or earlier one , please discuss this with your doctor or hospital , as you may not receive AL@@ IM@@ TA . &quot;
you will be performed before each in@@ fusion of blood tests ; it checks whether your kidney and liver function is sufficient and whether you have enough blood cells to get AL@@ IM@@ TA to 49 .
your doctor may change the dose or inter@@ rupt treatment if your general condition requires and when your blood levels are too low .
&quot; if you also receive cis@@ pl@@ atin , your doctor will ensure that your body contains sufficient water and you will get the necessary medicines to avoid vom@@ iting before and after the cis@@ pl@@ atin gift . &quot;
&quot; should a fluid accum@@ ulate around your lungs , your doctor may decide to remove this liquid before you get AL@@ IM@@ TA . &quot;
&quot; if you wish to use a child during the treatment or during the first six months of treatment , please talk to your doctor or pharmac@@ ist . &quot;
&quot; please tell your doctor if you are taking medicines for pain or inflammation ( swelling ) , such as drugs called non @-@ ster@@ o@@ idal anti@@ ph@@ log@@ is@@ tika ( N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds ) , including medicines that are not prescription ( such as i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ) . &quot;
&quot; depending on the planned error of your AL@@ IM@@ TA in@@ fusion and / or the extent of your kidney function , your doctor will tell you what other medicines you can take , and when . &quot;
&quot; please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you take other medicines or have recently taken it , even if it is not prescribed for prescription drugs . &quot;
&quot; a hospital , nursing staff or a doctor will mix the AL@@ IM@@ TA powder with ster@@ ile 0,@@ 9 % sodium chlori@@ de injection ( 9 mg / ml ) before it is applied to you . &quot;
&quot; your doctor will prescri@@ be cor@@ tis@@ one tablets ( according to 4 mg D@@ exam@@ eth@@ a son twice daily ) , which you must take on the day before , during and on the day after the application of AL@@ IM@@ TA . &quot;

&quot; it is applied in over@@ weight adults with a body mass index ( Body Mass Index - BM@@ I ) of ≥ 28 kg per square meter in conjunction with low @-@ cal@@ orie , gre@@ asy @-@ reduced nutrition . &quot;
patients who take All@@ i and do not receive weight loss after 12 weeks should contact their doctor or pharmac@@ ist .
&quot; if these enzymes are in@@ hibited , they cannot metabol@@ ise some fats in the food , resulting in about a quarter of the fats supplied with food un@@ di@@ gest@@ ed the intest@@ ines . &quot;
&quot; in a third study , All@@ i was compared with 391 over@@ weight patients with a BM@@ I between 25 and 28 kg / m2 with plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in the two studies of patients with a BM@@ I of ≥ 28 kg / m2 , patients who received All@@ i 60 mg received an average weight loss of 4.8 kg after a year versus 2.3 kg when taking plac@@ ebo . &quot;
the study with All@@ i in patients with a BM@@ I between 25 and 28 kg / m2 could not be observed for patients with relevant weight loss .
&quot; the most common side effects of All@@ i ( observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients ) are o@@ ily spots at anus , flat@@ us ( win@@ ch ) with stu@@ cco finish , stu@@ h@@ ld@@ pt , o@@ ily / o@@ ily chair , finish o@@ ily secre@@ tion ( rot ) , Flat@@ ul@@ ence ( win@@ ch ) and soft chairs . &quot;
it may not be used in patients who are treated with c@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( for preventing organ rejection in gra@@ ft patients ) or with medicines such as war@@ far@@ in to prevent blood cl@@ ots .
&quot; furthermore , it may not be used in patients suffering from a long @-@ term mal@@ absorption syndrome ( in which there is not enough nutrients from the diges@@ tive tract ) or chol@@ est@@ ase ( liver disease ) , and in pregnant women or nursing mothers . &quot;
&quot; in July 2007 , the European Commission granted the Gla@@ x@@ o Group Limited to the company Gla@@ x@@ o Group Limited for the establishment of Or@@ list@@ at GS@@ K in the entire European Union . &quot;
&quot; all@@ i is indicated for weight reduction of adults with over@@ weight ( Body @-@ Mass @-@ Index BM@@ I ≥ 28 kg / m2 ) and should be applied in conjunction with a slightly hypo@@ kal@@ or@@ ical , low @-@ fat diet . &quot;
&quot; all@@ i must not be used by children and adol@@ esc@@ ents under 18 , as there is not enough data for efficacy and safety . &quot;
&quot; however , since or@@ list@@ at is only minimal res@@ or@@ ted , no adjustment of the dosage is necessary for older people and in patients with reduced liver and / or kidney function . &quot;
• hyper@@ sensitivity to the active ingredient or any of the other components • Pre@@ mature treatment with C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( see Section 4.5 ) • Chronic mal@@ absorption syndrome • chol@@ est@@ ase • Pre@@ gn@@ ancy ( see Section 4.6 ) • Pre@@ mature treatment with war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants ( see Section 4.5 and 4.8 )
the probability of occurrence g@@ astro@@ intestinal symptoms ( see Section 4.8 ) can increase if omni@@ i is taken together with a fat @-@ rich single meal or a low @-@ fat diet .
&quot; as the weight reduction in diabetes can be accompanied by improved met@@ abolic control , patients who take a drug against diabetes before starting a therapy with all@@ i should consult a doctor or pharmac@@ ist , because the dosage of the anti@@ di@@ ab@@ etic needs to be adjusted . &quot;
patients who take all@@ i as well as medicines for high blood pressure or elevated cholesterol should consult their doctor or pharmac@@ ist if the dosage of this medicine must be adjusted .
it is recommended to take additional tail @-@ prevention measures to prevent the potential failure of the oral contra@@ ception in the event of severe di@@ arr@@ ho@@ ea ( see Section 4.5 ) .
&quot; in a study on interactions of medicines and in several cases with simultaneous use of or@@ list@@ at and c@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in , a reduction of the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in plasma level has been observed . &quot;
&quot; when applying war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants in combination with or@@ list@@ at , the Quick Values ( international norm@@ alised ratio , IN@@ R ) could be influenced ( see Section 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; in most patients treated with or@@ list@@ at in clinical trials up to 4 full years , the concentrations of vitamins A , D , E and K as well as the beta @-@ car@@ ot@@ ene were in the normal range . &quot;
&quot; however , the patient should be advised to take a supple@@ mental mul@@ tiv@@ it@@ amin supplement before bed@@ time in order to ensure adequate vitamin intake ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; after the application of a single @-@ time dosage A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ on was observed for a limited number of healthy volunteers , who at the same time received or@@ list@@ at , observed a minor decrease in the A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ one plasma concentration . &quot;
&quot; animal studies showed no direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see Section 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; the side effects of or@@ list@@ at are mainly g@@ astro@@ intestinal nature and are associated with the pharmac@@ ological effect of the drug , since the absorption of fat is prevented . &quot;
the g@@ astro@@ intestinal side effects were obtained from clinical trials with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg over a duration of 18 months to 2 years and were generally mild and temporary .
&quot; the frequency is defined as follows : very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) and very rare ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) , not known ( frequency based on the available data is not estimated ) . &quot;
&quot; the frequency of known side effects , which have been determined after the launch of or@@ list@@ at , is not known because these events were volun@@ tarily reported by a population of un@@ certain size . &quot;
&quot; † It is plau@@ sible that treatment with all@@ i can lead to anxiety , with regard to potential or actual g@@ astro@@ intestinal side effects . &quot;
dos@@ es of 800 mg or@@ list@@ at and multiple dos@@ es of up to 400 mg three times a day were ad@@ ministered over a period of 15 days to normal and over@@ weight subjects without significant clinical findings .
&quot; in the majority of cases reported after the launch of or@@ list@@ at over@@ dos@@ ages , there were either no side effects or similar side effects as reported at the recommended dose of or@@ list@@ at . &quot;
&quot; based on studies on humans and animals , a rapid recovery of possible system@@ ic effects caused by the inhibit@@ ing properties of or@@ list@@ at can be assumed . &quot;
the therapeutic effect continues in the l@@ umen of the stomach and the upper intest@@ ine by co@@ valent bonding to the active ser@@ ine rest of the ga@@ stri@@ c and pancre@@ atic eyel@@ ids .
&quot; from clinical trials it was derived that 60 mg or@@ list@@ at , taken three times a day , absorption of about 25 % of the food fat . &quot;
&quot; two double @-@ blind , random@@ ised , plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled studies on adults with a BM@@ I ≥ 28 kg / m2 demonstrate the effectiveness of 60 mg or@@ list@@ at , which was taken three times a day in combination with a hypo@@ kal@@ ore@@ al , fat @-@ induced diet . &quot;
&quot; the primary parameter , the changes in body weight compared to the initial value ( at the time of random@@ ization ) , was assessed as follows : as a change in the body weight in the course of study ( table 1 ) and as a percentage of those study participants who lost more than 5 % or more than 10 % of their weight ( table 2 ) . &quot;
&quot; although the weight reduction was observed over 12 months in both studies , the greatest weight loss occurred in the first 6 months . &quot;
average change in the total cholesterol amounted to or@@ list@@ at 60 mg -@@ 2.4 % ( initial value 5.8 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and plac@@ ebo + 2.8 % ( initial value 5.@@ 26 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
the average change of L@@ DL cholesterol was 60 mg -@@ 3.5 % ( bas@@ eline 3.@@ 41 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and plac@@ ebo + 3.8 % ( initial value 3.@@ 41 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
wa@@ ist circum@@ ference was the average change -@@ 4.5 cm with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg ( starting value 10@@ 3.7 cm ) and plac@@ ebo -@@ 3.6 cm ( initial value 10@@ 3.5 cm ) .
plasma concentrations of non @-@ met@@ ab@@ oli@@ zed or@@ list@@ at were not measur@@ able 8 hours after the oral administration of 360 mg or@@ list@@ at ( &lt; 5 ng / ml ) .
&quot; 7 In general , non @-@ met@@ ab@@ oli@@ zed or@@ list@@ at in plasma could only be spor@@ a@@ dic@@ ally and in extremely low concentrations ( &lt; 10 ng / ml or 0.0@@ 2 µ@@ mo@@ l ) and without signs of a cum@@ ulation . &quot;
&quot; in a study with o@@ bes@@ e patients that were ad@@ ministered the minimum system@@ ically res@@ or@@ ted dose , two main met@@ abolic metabol@@ ites , namely M1 ( in position 4 hydro@@ ly@@ sed Lac@@ ton@@ ring ) and M3 ( M1 after division of the N @-@ Form@@ yl Leu@@ cine group ) , were identified , which represented approximately 42 % of the total plasma concentration . &quot;
&quot; based on conventional studies on security sp@@ har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated gift , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity , can@@ did@@ ogen@@ ic potential and re@@ productive toxic@@ ity , prec@@ lin@@ ical data does not reveal any particular danger to humans . &quot;

&quot; please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if any of the side effects listed below may be significantly imp@@ aired , or you notice side effects that are not stated in this use information . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects are associated with the mode of action of the capsules , resulting in increased fat from the body . &quot;
&quot; these side effects usually occur within the first weeks of treatment , since at this time you have not yet reduced the fat content in your diet . &quot;
&quot; with the following basic rules you can learn to minimize the nutritional terms : • Beg@@ in some days , or better a week before the first intake of capsules with a fatty diet . • Learn more about the usual fat content of your favorite foods and about the size of portions you normally take . &quot;
&quot; if you know exactly how much you eat , the lik@@ el@@ ih@@ ood of you may exceed your fat limit . • Share your recommended fat volume ev@@ enly to daily meals . &quot;
&quot; save the amount of calories and fat you are allowed to take per meal , not to take them in the form of a fat @-@ rich main dish or a substantial tab@@ s , as you might have done with other programs for weight reduction . &quot;

excess weight has influence on your health and increases the risk of the emergence of various serious diseases such as : • hyper@@ tension • Diabetes • Heart disease • stroke • Cer@@ ective canc@@ ers • Oste@@ o@@ arthritis Please talk to your doctor about your risk of these diseases .
&quot; lasting weight loss , for example by improving diet and more exercise , can prevent serious diseases and has a positive impact on your health . &quot;
&quot; choose meals that contain a wide range of nutrients , and gradually learn to nour@@ ish yourself permanently . &quot;
&quot; energy is also measured in kilo@@ j@@ ou@@ les , which you can also find as an indication of the food packaging . • The recommended cal@@ orie intake indicates how many calories you should take maximum per day . &quot;
see the tables below . • The recommended fat intake in gram is the maximum amount of fat you should take with each meal .
&quot; what amount of calories is suitable for you can be found in the information below that indicates the number of calories , which is suitable for you . &quot;
&quot; if you take the same amount of fat as before , this may mean that your body cannot handle this amount of fat . &quot;
&quot; by resp@@ ecting the recommended fat supply , you can maxim@@ ize weight loss and at the same time reduce the lik@@ el@@ ih@@ ood of nutritional considerations . &quot;
&quot; 34 These reduced cal@@ orie intake should allow you to gradually and continuously lose approximately 0.5 kg per week , without fru@@ str@@ ations and dis@@ appointments . &quot;
&quot; the more active you are , the higher your recommended cal@@ orie intake . • &quot; &quot; Low physical activity &quot; &quot; means that you can walk daily 150 k@@ cal daily , for example by 3 km walking , 30 @-@ to 45 @-@ minute garden work or 2 km running in 15 minutes . &quot;
• For a lasting weight loss it is necessary to set realistic cal@@ orie and fat targets and also ad@@ here to them . • Sen@@ sel@@ ess is a food diary with information about the cal@@ orie and fat content of your meals .
&quot; the all@@ i program to support weight loss combines capsules with a nutritional plan and a large number of other information materials that can help you feed cal@@ orie and fat du@@ ets and give guidelines , physically active . &quot;
&quot; in combination with a program tailored to your type , this information helps you to develop a heal@@ thier lifestyle and achieve your goal weight . &quot;
&quot; Alo@@ xi is used for chem@@ otherap@@ ies , which are strong trig@@ gers for nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting ( such as cis@@ pl@@ atin ) , as well as in chem@@ otherap@@ ies , the regular trigger for nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting ( like cy@@ clo@@ phosph@@ amide , do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in or car@@ b@@ op@@ l@@ atin ) . &quot;
the effectiveness of Alo@@ xi can be increased by the additional gift of a Cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids ( a medicine that can be used as an anti @-@ cure ) .
&quot; the application in patients under 18 years is not recommended , since the effects in this age group do not have enough information . &quot;
&quot; this means that the active agent prevents the binding of a chemical substance in the body , 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin ( 5@@ HT , also known as ser@@ ot@@ onin ) , to rec@@ ept@@ ors in the intest@@ ine . &quot;
&quot; Alo@@ xi was studied in three basic studies of 1 842 adults who received chemotherapy , which are strong and moderate trig@@ gers for nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting . &quot;
&quot; chem@@ otherap@@ ies , which are strong trig@@ gers for nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting , showed 59 % of patients treated with Alo@@ xi in the 24 hours after chemotherapy , no vom@@ iting ( 132 of 223 ) , 57 % of patients treated with on@@ dan@@ set@@ ron ( 126 of 221 ) . &quot;
&quot; chem@@ otherap@@ ies , which are moderate trig@@ gers for nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting , showed 81 % of patients treated with Alo@@ xi in 24 hours after chemotherapy , compared to 69 % of patients treated with on@@ dan@@ set@@ ron ( 127 of 185 ) . &quot;
in comparison with Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron these values were 63 % for Alo@@ xi ( 119 of 189 patients ) and 53 % for Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron ( 101 of 191 patients ) .
&quot; in March 2005 , the European Commission granted approval for the company of Helsinki Bi@@ re@@ x Pharmaceu@@ ticals Ltd . a approval for Alo@@ xi &apos;s in@@ tranet in the entire European Union . &quot;
Alo@@ xi is indicated : for prevention of acute nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting in severe em@@ itting chemotherapy due to canc@@ ers and vom@@ iting in moderate em@@ ous chemotherapy due to cancer .
&quot; the effectiveness of Alo@@ xi for the prevention of nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting , induced by a strongly em@@ ous chemotherapy , can be ampli@@ fied by adding a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids given prior to chemotherapy . &quot;
&quot; since Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can extend the col@@ on of the col@@ on , patients should be monitored closely with an@@ am@@ ne@@ sty ob@@ sti@@ p@@ ation or signs of a sub@@ acute I@@ le@@ us after injection . &quot;
&quot; as with other 5@@ HT@@ 3 antagon@@ ists , however , caution is advisable in the simultaneous offering of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron with medicines that extend the Q@@ T interval or in patients with which the Q@@ T interval is extended or which tend to such an extension . &quot;
&quot; in addition to chemotherapy , Alo@@ xi is not intended to be used neither for prevention nor for the treatment of nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting during the days after chemotherapy . &quot;
&quot; in prec@@ lin@@ ical studies , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron did not in@@ hi@@ bit the activity of the five examined chem@@ otherapeu@@ tics ( cis@@ pl@@ atin , cy@@ clo@@ phosph@@ amide , cy@@ clo@@ ab@@ ine , do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in and mit@@ om@@ y@@ cin C ) . &quot;
&quot; a clinical study showed no significant pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic interaction between a single intra@@ ven@@ ous dose of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron and a Ste@@ ady stat@@ e- concentration of oral met@@ oc@@ lo@@ pr@@ am@@ ids , a C@@ YP@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ or . &quot;
&quot; a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic analysis based on a population @-@ based pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic analysis showed that the simultaneous offering of C@@ YP@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 induc@@ tors ( D@@ exam@@ eth@@ as@@ one and ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ) as well as C@@ YP@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ ors ( A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ one , chlor@@ pro@@ ma@@ z@@ ine , chlor@@ pro@@ ma@@ z@@ ine , ox@@ et@@ ine , ser@@ tr@@ aline and ter@@ bin@@ af@@ ine ) had no significant effect on the clearance of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron . &quot;
&quot; the use of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in human pregn@@ ancies does not occur , so Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron should not be used in pregnant women unless it is considered necessary by the attending physician . &quot;
&quot; clinical trials were the most common in a dose of 250 micro@@ grams to observed side @-@ effects ( a total of 6@@ 33 patients ) , which at least possibly associated with Alo@@ xi , head@@ aches ( 9 % ) and ob@@ sti@@ p@@ ation ( 5 % ) . &quot;
&quot; very rare cases ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) of hyper@@ sensitivity reactions and reactions to the meeting place ( burning , har@@ dening , dis@@ comfort and pa@@ ins ) were reported in post @-@ marketing reviews . &quot;
the group with the highest dos@@ es showed similar frequency of adverse events as in the other dosage groups ; there were no dose @-@ active relationships to observe .
&quot; no di@@ aly@@ sis studies have been carried out , however , due to the large distribution volume , di@@ aly@@ sis is probably not effective in case of an Alo@@ xi@@ - over@@ dose . &quot;
&quot; in two random@@ ised double @-@ blind studies , a total of 1,@@ 132 patients who received a moderate @-@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy with ≤ 50 mg / m2 Cis@@ pl@@ atin , Car@@ b@@ op@@ l@@ atin , ≤ 1,500 mg / m2 of cy@@ clo@@ phosph@@ amide and 250 mg / m2 of cy@@ clo@@ phosph@@ amide ( half @-@ value 4 hours ) or 100 mg of Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron ( half @-@ value for 7.3 hours ) received , which was given to day 1 without dex@@ am@@ eth@@ as@@ one intra@@ ven@@ ously . &quot;
&quot; in a random@@ ized double @-@ blind study , a total of 667 patients with a strong em@@ ous chemotherapy with ≥ 60 mg / m2 of cy@@ clo@@ phosph@@ amide and D@@ ac@@ ar@@ ba@@ zin and 250 or 750 micro@@ grams Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron were compared to patients who received 32 mg on@@ dan@@ set@@ ron , which were given intra@@ ven@@ ously on day 1 . &quot;
results of studies with moderate chemotherapy and the study of strongly em@@ itting chemotherapy are summari@@ zed in the following tables .
&quot; in clinical trials for the indication of chemotherapy @-@ induced nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting ( C@@ IN@@ V ) , the effects of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron on blood pressure , heart rate and EC@@ G parameters were comparable to the corresponding effects of on@@ dan@@ set@@ ron and dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron . &quot;
after the findings of pre @-@ clinical studies Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron has the ability to block the ion channels involved in v@@ entri@@ cular de@@ - and rep@@ ol@@ ar@@ isation and extend the duration of the action potential .
&quot; the study conducted by 221 healthy subjects was the evaluation of the EC@@ G effects of i.@@ v. adjusted pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in dos@@ es of 0,25 , 0.@@ 75 and 2.@@ 25 mg . &quot;
res@@ or@@ ption After intra@@ ven@@ ous application follows an initial decrease in plasma concentrations a slow elim@@ ination from the body with an average termin@@ al half @-@ time period of approximately 40 hours .
the average maximum plasma concentration ( C@@ max ) and the surface below the concentration time curve ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) are in general dos@@ is@@ proportional in the whole dose range of 0.@@ 3- 90 μ g / kg in patients and cancer patients .
&quot; following intra@@ ven@@ ous administration of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron 0,25 mg every second day for a total of 3 dos@@ es , the mean medium ( ± SD ) in 11 tes@@ tic@@ ular car@@ cin@@ oma patients ran@@ ged between day 1 and day 5 measured in the pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron plasma concentration at 42 ± 34 % . &quot;
&quot; from pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic simul@@ ations , the total tex@@ tual position ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) achieved during a daily intra@@ ven@@ ous administration of 0.25 mg of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron was comparable to the value measured after one @-@ time intra@@ ven@@ ous administration ; however , the C@@ max was higher after the exposure of 0.@@ 75 mg . &quot;
&quot; about 40 % are eliminated by the kid@@ neys and approximately 50 % are converted into two primary metabol@@ ites , which in comparison to Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron have less than 1 % of the antagon@@ istic effect on the 5@@ HT@@ 3 recep@@ tor . &quot;
&quot; in vit@@ ro studies to metabol@@ ise have shown that C@@ YP@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and , in less measurements , are involved in enzymes C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 and C@@ YP@@ 1@@ A2 on the metabolism of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron . &quot;
&quot; elim@@ ination After an intra@@ ven@@ ous single dose of 10 micro@@ grams / kg &#91; 14@@ C &#93; -@@ Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron were found about 80 % of the dose within 144 hours in the urine , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron as un@@ modified agent made about 40 % of the given dose . &quot;
&quot; after a unique intra@@ ven@@ ous bol@@ us injection , the total body was 173 ± 73 ml / min and the ren@@ al clearance 53 ± 29 ml / min . &quot;
&quot; although in patients with severe liver function , the termin@@ ale elim@@ ination of elim@@ ination and the average system@@ ic exposure with Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron increases , however , a reduction of the dose is not justified . &quot;
&quot; in pre @-@ clinical studies , effects were observed only after exposure , which are considered sufficient above the maximum human therapeutic exposure , suggest@@ ing a low relevance for clinical use . &quot;
&quot; 10 out of prec@@ lin@@ ical studies , indications that Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can only block ion@@ ic channels in very high concentrations , which are involved in v@@ entri@@ cular de@@ - and rep@@ ol@@ ar@@ isation and extend the action potential . &quot;
&quot; high dos@@ es of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron ( each dose correspon@@ ded in about the 30@@ x of the therapeutic exposure in humans ) , which were given daily over two years , led to an increased frequency of liver tum@@ ors , endo@@ cr@@ ine ne@@ oplas@@ ms ( in thy@@ ro@@ id gland , pit@@ u@@ itary , pancre@@ as , ad@@ ren@@ al mar@@ row ) and skin tum@@ ors in rats but not in mice . &quot;
&quot; underlying mechanisms are not fully known , but due to the high dos@@ ages and since Alo@@ xi is determined by humans for a unique application , the relevance of these results is very small . &quot;
the controller must inform the European Commission on the plans for the launch of the drug approved within the framework of this decision .

&quot; June 2006 , the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) approved a negative report in which the pro@@ hibition of approval for the marketing of the drugs provided for the treatment of h@@ epatitis C was recommended by Al@@ ph@@ eon 6 million IE / ml injection solution . &quot;
&quot; this means that Al@@ ph@@ eon should res@@ emble a biological medicine named Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A with the same medicinal ingredient , which is already approved in the EU ( also called &quot; reference drug &quot; ) . &quot;
Al@@ ph@@ eon should be used to treat adult patients with chronic ( long @-@ lasting ) h@@ epatitis C ( a liver disease caused by viral infection ) .
&quot; in a micro@@ sc@@ opic examination , the liver tissue damage damages , and the values of liver enzyme alan@@ ine amin@@ ot@@ ran@@ s@@ fer@@ ase ( AL@@ T ) are elevated in the blood standard . &quot;
&quot; it is produced by a yeast into which a gene ( DNA ) has been introduced , which stimul@@ ates it to the formation of the active substance . &quot;
&quot; the manufacturer of Al@@ ph@@ eon used data to demonstrate the comparison of Al@@ ph@@ eon with Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A ( substance structure , composition and purity of the drug , effectiveness , safety and effectiveness of h@@ epatitis C ) . &quot;
&quot; in the study on patients with h@@ epatitis C , the efficacy of Al@@ ph@@ eon was compared to the efficacy of the reference drug with 455 patients . &quot;
the study measured how many patients responded to the drug after 12 of a total of 48 treatment weeks and 6 months after treatment ( i.e. no sign of the virus in the blood ) .
( 44 @-@ 20 ) 74 18 84 00 Fax ( 44 @-@ 20 ) 74 18 84 16 E @-@ mail : mail @ eme@@ a.@@ eu@@ .@@ int © E@@ MEA 2006 Re@@ production and / or distribution of this document is Auth@@ or@@ ised for non commercial purposes only provided the E@@ MEA is acknowledged
&quot; in addition , concerns were expressed in detail that the data on the stability of the drug and the drug is not sufficient . &quot;
&quot; the number of patients with h@@ epatitis C , which responded to treatment with Al@@ ph@@ eon and Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A , was similar in clinical study . &quot;
&quot; after the treatment with Al@@ ph@@ eon , the disease fl@@ amed up again in more patients than with the reference drug ; moreover , Al@@ ph@@ eon had more side effects . &quot;
&quot; apart from this , the test used in the study to examine the question of what extent is the medication an immune response ( i.e. the body forms antibodies - special proteins - against the medicine ) dis@@ sol@@ ves , not sufficiently vali@@ dated . &quot;
&quot; it can be used to treat im@@ pe@@ tig@@ o ( a skin infection associated with cr@@ ust formation ) and small infected Laz@@ er@@ ations ( cra@@ cks or cuts ) , abra@@ sions and stit@@ ched wounds . &quot;
&quot; Al@@ tar@@ go should not be used to treat infections that have been det@@ ectable or pres@@ um@@ ably caused by meth@@ ic@@ il@@ ine @-@ resistant Stap@@ hy@@ lo@@ co@@ cc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) , because al@@ ar@@ go against this type of infection may not work . &quot;
&quot; Al@@ tar@@ go can be used in patients from the age of nine months , but in patients under 18 years the skin surface may not be more than 2 % of the body surface . &quot;
&quot; if the patient does not respond to the treatment after two or three days , the doctor should examine the patient again and consider alternative treatments . &quot;
it works by blocking bacterial ri@@ bos@@ omes ( the parts of the bacterial cells in which proteins are produced ) and in@@ hi@@ bits the growth of the bacteria .
&quot; in all five studies , the main indicator of efficacy was the proportion of patients whose infection was after the end of the treatment . &quot;
119 ( 8@@ 5.6 % ) of 139 patients under Al@@ tar@@ go and 37 ( 5@@ 2.1 % ) of the 71 patients under plac@@ ebo spoke to the treatment .
&quot; in the treatment of infected skin wounds , Al@@ tar@@ go and C@@ ef@@ al@@ ex@@ in showed similar response rates : if the results of both studies have been taken together with skin wounds , approximately 90 % of patients of both groups responded to the treatment . &quot;
&quot; however , in these two studies , however , it was found that Al@@ tar@@ go was not effective enough in the treatment of ab@@ sc@@ esses ( tissue @-@ filled ca@@ vi@@ ties in the body tissue ) or infections caused by MR@@ SA . &quot;
the most common side effect with Al@@ tar@@ go ( which was observed in 1 to 10 out of 100 patients ) is a irrit@@ ation at the job .
&quot; the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of Al@@ tar@@ go were out@@ wei@@ gh in the short @-@ term treatment of the following super@@ ficial skin infections : • Im@@ pe@@ tig@@ o , • infected small Laz@@ er@@ ations , abra@@ sions , or se@@ wn sor@@ es . &quot;
&quot; in May 2007 , the European Commission granted the Gla@@ x@@ o Group Ltd. to the company Gla@@ x@@ o Group Ltd . &quot;
patients with no improvement within two to three days should be examined again and an alternative therapy should be considered ( see Section 4.4 ) .
&quot; in the event of sensi@@ tis@@ ation or serious local irrit@@ ation by applying re@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin o@@ int@@ ment , the treatment should be abor@@ ted , the o@@ int@@ ment carefully wi@@ pes and an appropriate alternative therapy of infection is started . &quot;
re@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin should not be used to treat infections in which MR@@ SA is known as patho@@ gens or is suspected ( see Section 5.1 ) .
&quot; in clinical trials of phy@@ to@@ on@@ ically infected open wounds , the effectiveness of retin@@ o@@ ulin in patients with infections caused by a meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in @-@ resistant Stap@@ hy@@ lo@@ co@@ cc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) was insufficient . &quot;
alternative therapy should be considered if no improvement or deteri@@ oration of the infected area occurs after a 2 @-@ 3 @-@ day treatment .
the effect of the simultaneous use of retin@@ am@@ ines and other top@@ ical means on the same skin surface has not been investigated and the simultaneous use of other top@@ ical drugs is not recommended .
&quot; a clin@@ ically relevant in@@ hibition in vi@@ vo is not to be expected ( see Section 5.2 ) due to the low plasma concentrations , which have been reached by humans according to top@@ ical application on abra@@ ded skin or infected super@@ ficial wounds ( see Section 5.2 ) . &quot;
3 After con@@ current oral administration of 2 times daily 200 mg k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole the middle re@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) and C@@ max according to top@@ ical application of 1 % retin@@ o@@ ulin o@@ int@@ ment increased by 81 % on s@@ ne@@ edy skin of healthy adult men .
&quot; due to the low system@@ ic ex@@ position following top@@ ical application in patients , dose adjustments are not considered necessary if top@@ ical Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is applied during a system@@ ic treatment with C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors . &quot;
animal studies have shown a re@@ productive toxic@@ ity after oral dosage and are in@@ adequate regarding a statement on the effect on birth and red@@ dish / post@@ nat@@ al development ( see Section 5.3 ) .
&quot; retin@@ o@@ ulin o@@ int@@ ment should only be applied during pregnancy , if a top@@ ical anti@@ bacterial therapy is clearly indicated and the application of re@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is prefer@@ able to the administration of a system@@ ic antibiotic . &quot;
deci@@ ding whether breast@@ feeding continues / stopped or the therapy with Al@@ tar@@ go should be continued / stopped is to wei@@ gh between the benefits of breast@@ feeding for the inf@@ ant and the benefits of al@@ tar@@ go therapy for the woman .
&quot; in clinical trials involving 2@@ 150 patients with super@@ ficial skin infections that Al@@ tar@@ go , the most common reported side effect was irrit@@ ation at the meeting point , which concerned approximately 1 % of the patients . &quot;
&quot; re@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is a semi @-@ synthetic deri@@ v@@ ative of P@@ leu@@ ro@@ mu@@ ti@@ lin , a substance that is isolated by fermentation from C@@ lit@@ op@@ il@@ us pass@@ eck@@ eri@@ anus ( formerly Ple@@ ur@@ ot@@ us pass@@ eck@@ eri@@ anus ) . &quot;
the active mechanism of re@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is based on the sel@@ ective inhibit@@ ing of bacterial protein synthesis by interaction at a specific binding site of the 50@@ S sub@@ unit of the bacterial ri@@ bos@@ ome which diff@@ ers from the binding sites of other ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al inter@@ acting anti@@ bacterial substances .
data indicate that the binding site is involved with ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al protein L3 and is located in the region of the ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al P binding site and the Pep@@ ti@@ d@@ yl@@ transfer@@ ase center .
&quot; by binding to this binding site , P@@ leu@@ ro@@ mu@@ ti@@ line in@@ hi@@ bit the pep@@ tide transfer , block partial P @-@ binding interactions and prevent the normal formation of active 50@@ S ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al sub@@ units . &quot;
&quot; if , due to the local pre@@ val@@ ence of resistance , the application of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin at least some infection forms may appear question@@ able , couns@@ elling should be sought by experts . &quot;
&quot; there were no differences in the in vit@@ ro activity of retin@@ am@@ ulin to S.@@ au@@ re@@ us , regardless of whether the isol@@ ates were sensitive or resistant to meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in . &quot;
&quot; in the event of non @-@ response to the treatment of S.@@ au@@ re@@ us , the presence of tribes with additional vir@@ ul@@ ence factors ( such as PV@@ L = Pant@@ on @-@ Valent@@ ine Leu@@ co@@ ci@@ din ) should be considered . &quot;
&quot; res@@ or@@ ption In a healthy adult study , 1 % retin@@ am@@ ulin was applied daily with oc@@ clu@@ sion on intact and s@@ worn skin for up to 7 days . &quot;
&quot; from 516 patients ( adults and children ) , the 1 % ret@@ aph@@ ine o@@ int@@ ment received twice a day for 5 days for top@@ ical treatment of secondary trau@@ mati@@ zed wounds , individual plasma samples were obtained . &quot;
the sampling was performed on days 3 or 4 in the adult patients prior to medi@@ ation and in children between 0 @-@ 12 hours after the last application .
&quot; however , the maximum individual system@@ ic acceptance of people after top@@ ical use of 1 % o@@ int@@ ment on 200 c@@ m2 s@@ ne@@ ered skin ( C@@ max = 22 ng / ml ; AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) = 238 ng · h / ml ) 660 times lower than the re@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin IC@@ 50 for P@@ GP in@@ hibition . &quot;
&quot; metabolism The in vit@@ ro oxid@@ ative metabolism of re@@ ap@@ am@@ ines in human liver micro@@ som@@ es was primarily medi@@ ated by C@@ YP@@ 2@@ A4 , under small participation of C@@ YP@@ 2@@ C8 and C@@ YP@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 ( see Section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; in studies on oral toxic@@ ity in rats ( 50 , 150 or 450 mg / kg ) conducted over 14 days there were signs of adap@@ tive liver and thy@@ ro@@ id changes . &quot;
in vit@@ ro testing on gene mut@@ ation and / or chromos@@ om@@ al effects in the mouse @-@ lymph@@ oma test or in cultures of human periph@@ eral blood lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes and in the rat micro@@ kernel test for in @-@ vi@@ vo examination of chromos@@ om@@ al effects .
&quot; there was neither male nor female rats indication of reduced fertility at oral dos@@ es of 50 , 150 or 450 mg / kg / day , whereby an exposure to 5 times higher exposure was reached as the highest estimated exposure in humans ( top@@ ical application to 200 c@@ m2 of sc@@ aled skin ) : &quot;
&quot; in an embry@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity study of rats were found at oral dosage of ≥ 150 mg / kg / day ( according to ≥ 3 times the estimated human exposure ( see above ) ) , development toxic@@ ity ( decreased body weight of the fet@@ us and delayed oscill@@ ation ) and mat@@ ernal toxic@@ ity . &quot;

&quot; to indicate irrit@@ ation or other signs and symptoms in the treated area , you should quit the application of Al@@ tar@@ go and talk to your doctor . &quot;
&quot; do not apply any other o@@ int@@ ments , cre@@ ams or lot@@ ions on the surface treated with Al@@ tar@@ go if it has not been prescribed by your doctor . &quot;
&quot; it must not be applied in the eyes , in the mouth or on the lips , in the nose or in the female genital area . &quot;
&quot; when the o@@ int@@ ment comes from seeing on one of these surfaces , wash the place with water and ask your doctor for advice if symptoms occur . &quot;
&quot; after applying the o@@ int@@ ment you can cover the affected area with a ster@@ ile association or a gaz@@ ebo , unless your doctor has advised you to cover the area . &quot;
&quot; it is available in an aluminium tube with a plastic cap containing 5 , 10 or 15 grams of o@@ int@@ ment , or in an aluminum bag containing 0.5 g of o@@ int@@ ment . &quot;
&quot; Ambi@@ rix will be used to protect h@@ epatitis A and h@@ epatitis B ( diseases affecting the liver ) in children aged between 1 and 15 years , which are not immune to these two diseases . &quot;
&quot; Ambi@@ rix will be applied as part of a vacc@@ ination project consisting of two dos@@ es , whereby a protection against h@@ epatitis B may only be reached after the second dose is reached . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , Ambi@@ rix can only be used if there is a low risk of h@@ epatitis B infection during the immun@@ isation and it is ensured that the vacc@@ ination of two dos@@ es can lead to an end . &quot;
&quot; if a refres@@ her dose is desired against h@@ epatitis A or B , Ambi@@ rix or another h@@ epatitis A or B vacc@@ ine may be given . &quot;
vacc@@ ines work by assi@@ sting the immune system ( the natural immune system of the body ) as it can defend itself against a disease .
&quot; after a child has received the vacc@@ ine , the immune system det@@ ects viruses and surface anti@@ gens as &quot; &quot; foreign &quot; &quot; and produces antibodies against it . &quot;
Ambi@@ rix contains the same components as the vacc@@ ine which has been approved since 1996 and the vacc@@ ine approved Twin@@ rix children since 1997 .
&quot; the three vacc@@ ines are used to protect against the same diseases , however , Twin@@ rix adults and Twin@@ rix children are ad@@ ministered as part of a vacc@@ ination project consisting of three dos@@ es . &quot;
&quot; because ambi@@ rix and Twin@@ rix adults contain identical ingredients , some of the data that support the application of Twin@@ rix adults were also used as evidence for the application of Ambi@@ rix . &quot;
the main indicator for the effectiveness was the share of the vacc@@ inated children who had developed a protective anti@@ body concentration after the last injection .
&quot; in an additional study involving 208 children , the efficacy of the vacc@@ ine was compared with a six @-@ month and a 12 month distance between the two inj@@ ections . &quot;
Ambi@@ rix conducted between 98 and 100 % of vacc@@ inated children one month after the last injection to develop anti@@ body concentrations against h@@ epatitis A and B .
the additional study showed that the degree of protection from Ambi@@ rix was similar to a six and a 12 month distance between the inj@@ ections .
&quot; the most common side effects of Ambi@@ rix ( observed in more than 1 out of 10 vacc@@ ine dos@@ es ) are head@@ ache , loss of appetite , pain at the injection point , red@@ ness , fatigue ( fatigue ) as well as irrit@@ ability . &quot;
&quot; ambient may not be applied to patients who may possibly be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to the active ingredients , one of the other ingredients or ne@@ om@@ y@@ cin ( an antibiotic ) . &quot;
&quot; August 2002 , the European Commission granted the company Gla@@ x@@ o@@ S@@ mith@@ K@@ line Biolog@@ icals s.@@ a. a permit for setting up Ambi@@ rix in the entire region &quot;
&quot; the standard dose for pri@@ mm@@ ins@@ ing with Ambi@@ rix is made up of two vacc@@ inations , taking the first dose at the date of choice and the second dose is given between six and twelve months after the first dose . &quot;
&quot; if a refres@@ her is desired for h@@ epatitis A as well as h@@ epatitis B , vacc@@ ines can be vacc@@ inated with the corresponding mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ent vacc@@ ines or with a combination vacc@@ ine . &quot;
the anti @-@ h@@ epatitis B surface an@@ tigen ( anti @-@ H@@ B@@ s@@ A@@ g ) and anti @-@ h@@ epatitis A virus ( anti @-@ HA@@ V ) antibodies are based on the same size as after vacc@@ ination with the respective mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ent vacc@@ ines .
&quot; it is not fully assured whether immun@@ o@@ competent persons , who have responded to a Hepatitis A vacc@@ ination , need a refres@@ her chim@@ ney as protection , since they are protected by immun@@ ological memory in no more det@@ ectable antibodies . &quot;
&quot; 3 As with all injection vacc@@ ines , appropriate possibilities of medical treatment and monitoring should always be available for the rare case of an an@@ ap@@ hy@@ la@@ k@@ tic reaction following the application of the vacc@@ ine . &quot;
&quot; if a fast protection against h@@ epatitis B is required , the standard procedure is recommended with the combination vacc@@ ine containing 360 ELISA units form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated h@@ epatitis A virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant h@@ epatitis B surface an@@ tigen . &quot;
&quot; after pri@@ mm@@ aly@@ sis patients and persons suffering from disorders of the immune system , no sufficient anti @-@ HAV@@ - and anti @-@ H@@ Bs anti@@ body value is achieved , so that in these cases the gift of further vacc@@ inations may be necessary . &quot;
&quot; since an intra@@ der@@ mal injection or in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular administration in the glut@@ eal muscle could lead to a sub@@ optimal impot@@ ence , these inj@@ ections should be avoided . &quot;
&quot; however , in the case of th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ enia or co@@ ag@@ ulation disorders , Ambi@@ rix can be inj@@ ected without exception , since it can occur in these cases after in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular administration . &quot;
&quot; if Ambi@@ rix in the second year of life in the form of a separate injection , Tet@@ an@@ us@@ - , az@@ ell@@ ular per@@ t@@ uss@@ is@@ - , in@@ activated poli@@ omyel@@ itis and Ha@@ em@@ op@@ hil@@ us influ@@ enz@@ ae type b vacc@@ ine ( DT@@ PA @-@ IP@@ V / HI@@ B ) , or with a combined mesh m@@ umps vacc@@ ine , the immune response was sufficient to all anti@@ gens ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients suffering from immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy or in patients with immun@@ o@@ deficiency , it must be assumed that there may be no adequate immune response . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical study conducted with 3 vacc@@ inations of this form@@ ulation in adults , the frequency of pain , red@@ ness , swelling , mat@@ ri@@ dity , Gast@@ ro@@ ent@@ eri@@ tis , head@@ aches and fever comparable to the frequency observed in the earlier thi@@ omer@@ ang and preser@@ v@@ ative @-@ containing vacc@@ ine form@@ ulation . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials , 20@@ 29 vacc@@ inations were ad@@ ministered at a total of 10@@ 27 vacc@@ inations at the age of 1 to 15 years . &quot;
&quot; in a study involving 300 participants between 12 and 15 years old , the compatibility of Ambi@@ rix was compared with that of the 3 @-@ dose combin@@ ation@@ filler metal . &quot;
&quot; only exceptions were the higher frequency of pain and mat@@ ri@@ dity on a basis of calculation per vacc@@ ine Ambi@@ rix , but not based on a calculation basis per person . &quot;
&quot; after the gift of Ambi@@ rix in 50.@@ 7 % of the subjects , pain was observed , compared to 39.@@ 1 % in the subjects following the gift of a dose of 3 dos@@ es of combination vacc@@ ine . &quot;
&quot; after the complete vacc@@ ine cycle , 6@@ 6.4 % of the subjects who received Ambi@@ rix had been reported about pain , compared to 6@@ 3.8 % in the subjects who had been vacc@@ inated with the 3 @-@ dose seal vacc@@ ine . &quot;
&quot; however , the frequency of mat@@ ri@@ ght@@ ness was comparable to a high ( i.e. throughout the entire vacc@@ ine cycle at 39.@@ 6 % of the subjects who received Ambi@@ rix in comparison with 36.@@ 2 % in the subjects who received the 3 @-@ dose combination vacc@@ ine ) . &quot;
the frequency of pronounced pain and mal@@ ign@@ ancy was low and comparable to those observed after administration of the combination vacc@@ ine with the 3 dos@@ es vacc@@ ine .
&quot; in a compar@@ ative study of 1 to 11 year old vacc@@ ines , the presence of local reactions and general reactions in the Ambi@@ ri@@ x@@ gruppe was comparable to that which was observed in form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated h@@ epatitis A virus and 10 µ@@ g of re@@ combin@@ ant h@@ epatitis B surface an@@ tigen . &quot;
&quot; however , in the 6- to 11@@ - year @-@ olds , however , after vacc@@ ination with Ambi@@ rix was a more frequent occurrence of pain ( at the injection point ) per dose , not per pro@@ band . &quot;
&quot; the share of vacc@@ ines , which reported severe side effects during the 2 @-@ dos@@ es vacc@@ ine with Ambi@@ rix , or during the 3 @-@ dose vacc@@ ine with the combination vacc@@ ine with 360 EL@@ IS@@ A- units of form@@ al@@ in@@ ert h@@ epatitis B virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant h@@ epatitis B surface an@@ tigen was not statisti@@ cally different . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials conducted at the age of 1 to 15 years at the age of 1 to 15 years , the anti @-@ HA@@ V &apos;s ser@@ o@@ conversion rates were one month after the first dose and 100 % a month after the second dose of the second dose ( i.e. in month 7 ) . &quot;
&quot; ser@@ o@@ conversion rates for anti @-@ H@@ Bs were 7@@ 4.2 % a month after the first dose , and 100 % a month after the second dose , a month of 6 ad@@ ministered dose ( i.e. , in month 7 ) . &quot;
&quot; 7 In a compar@@ ative study conducted at 12- to including 15 @-@ year @-@ olds , 142 two dos@@ es of Ambi@@ rix and 147 were awarded the standard combination vacc@@ ine with three dos@@ es . &quot;
&quot; in the 289 people , whose immun@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity was measur@@ able , the levels of ser@@ op@@ rot@@ ection ( SP in the table below ) were significantly higher compared to h@@ epatitis B in the month 2 and 6 after offering the 3 tin vacc@@ ine higher than with Ambi@@ rix . &quot;
&quot; the responses reported in a clinical compar@@ ative study of 1 to 11 year @-@ olds one month after the full vacc@@ ination series ( i.e. , month 7 ) , are listed in the following table . &quot;
&quot; in both studies , the vacc@@ ines received either a 2 @-@ dose vacc@@ ine with Ambi@@ rix or a 3 @-@ dose vacc@@ ine with a combination sim@@ p with 360 ELISA units form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated h@@ epatitis A virus and 10@@ µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant h@@ epatitis B surface an@@ tigen . &quot;
&quot; for persons who were aged between 12 and 15 years old at the time of pri@@ ming , the persist@@ ence of anti @-@ HAV@@ - and anti @-@ H@@ Bs antibodies could be detected in the 0 @-@ 6 @-@ month vacc@@ ine at least 24 months after immun@@ isation . &quot;
&quot; the immun@@ reaction against both anti@@ gens observed in this study was comparable to that , after vacc@@ ination of 3 dos@@ es with a combination vacc@@ ine , consisting of 360 ELISA units form@@ al@@ in@@ activated h@@ epatitis B and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant h@@ epatitis B surface an@@ tigen detected in a dose volume of 0.5 ml . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical study at 12- to including 15 @-@ year @-@ olds , it could be shown that the persist@@ ence of anti @-@ HAV@@ - and anti @-@ H@@ Bs antibodies can be compared 24 months after immun@@ isation in the 0 @-@ 6 month vacc@@ ine scheme compared to the one in the 0 @-@ 12 months vacc@@ ine scheme . &quot;
&quot; when the first dose of Ambi@@ rix in the second year was given at the same time with the refres@@ her chim@@ ney of a combined di@@ ph@@ th@@ eri@@ e- , tet@@ an@@ us@@ - , az@@ ell@@ ular per@@ t@@ uss@@ i , in@@ activated poli@@ omyel@@ i@@ tis@@ - and 8 ha@@ em@@ op@@ hil@@ us influ@@ enza vacc@@ ine , the immune response was sufficient for all anti@@ gens . &quot;
a clinical study conducted with 3 dos@@ es of current form@@ ulation in adults showed similar ser@@ op@@ rot@@ ection and ser@@ o@@ conversion rates as for previous form@@ ulation .
the vacc@@ ine is to be examined both before and after the res@@ cis@@ sion on possible external particles and / or physi@@ c@@ ally visible changes .

&quot; the h@@ epatitis A virus is usually transmitted through viral food@@ stuffs and beverages , but can also be transmitted by other ways , such as by bathing in water contam@@ inated waters . &quot;
&quot; you can feel very tired , have a dark urine , a blas@@ ph@@ em@@ y face , yellow skin and / or eyes ( ja@@ un@@ dice ) and other symptoms that may possibly require a stationary treatment . &quot;
&quot; as with all vacc@@ ines , Ambi@@ rix can not fully protect against infection with h@@ epatitis A or h@@ epatitis B virus , even if the complete vacc@@ ine series has been completed with 2 dos@@ es . &quot;
if you / your child are already infected with h@@ epatitis A or h@@ epatitis B virus before administration of both vacc@@ inations ( although you / your child feel un@@ comfortable or ill at the time of vacc@@ ination ) a vacc@@ ination may not prevent a disease .
&quot; protection against other infections that cause liver damage or symptoms similar to those after h@@ epatitis A or h@@ epatitis B infection , can not be medi@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; • If your child has an allergic reaction to Ambi@@ rix , or any part of this vacc@@ ine , including Ne@@ om@@ y@@ cin ( an antibiotic ) . &quot;
&quot; an allergic reaction can be expressed through it@@ chy skin r@@ ashes , respiratory or swelling of the face or tongue . • If your child has an allergic reaction to an earlier vacc@@ ination against h@@ epatitis A or h@@ epatitis B , if you / your child have a severe infection with fever . &quot;
• If you want to quickly have a protection against h@@ epatitis B ( i.e. within 6 months and before the usual dose of the second vacc@@ ine dose ) .
&quot; at a possible risk of infection with h@@ epatitis B between the first and second vacc@@ ination , the doctor will advise you / your child from a vacc@@ ination with Ambi@@ rix . &quot;
&quot; instead , he / her child will recommend three inj@@ ections of a combined h@@ epatitis A / h@@ epatitis B vacc@@ ine with a reduced content of effective constitu@@ ents per vacc@@ ine ( 360 ELISA units of a form@@ al@@ in@@ ert h@@ epatitis B virus and 10 micro@@ grams of a re@@ combin@@ ant h@@ epatitis B surface anti@@ gens ) . &quot;
the second vacc@@ ine dose of this vacc@@ ine with reduced levels of effective ingredients is usually ad@@ ministered a month after the first dose and is likely to give you a vacc@@ ine protection prior to the completion of the vacc@@ ine .
&quot; if you / your child are weak@@ ened by illness or treatment in your / her body &apos;s immune system , or if you / her child under@@ go a hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis . &quot;
&quot; Ambi@@ rix can be given in these cases , but the immune response of these individuals on vacc@@ ination cannot be sufficient , so that a blood test may be necessary to see how strongly the reaction to vacc@@ ination is . &quot;
&quot; 21 Do you tell your doctor if you / your child take another medicine ( including those that you can get without prescription ) or if you have been vacc@@ inated , or if you have been given vacc@@ ine or immun@@ og@@ lob@@ ul@@ ine ( antibodies ) , or if it is planned in the near future . &quot;
&quot; however , it may be that in this case the immune response to the vacc@@ ine is not sufficient and the person therefore is not protected against one or both h@@ epatitis A and B viruses . &quot;
&quot; if another vacc@@ ine has to be given at the same time with Ambi@@ rix , it should be vacc@@ inated in separate places and as possible limbs . &quot;
&quot; if Ambi@@ rix is to be ad@@ ministered at the same time or shortly before or after an injection of immun@@ og@@ lob@@ ul@@ ins , it is likely that the reaction to the vacc@@ ine will nevertheless be sufficient . &quot;
&quot; normally , Ambi@@ rix pregnant or nursing women are not ad@@ ministered unless it is urgent for vacc@@ ination against h@@ epatitis A and h@@ epatitis B. &quot;
important information about certain other components of Ambi@@ rix Please inform your doctor if you have already indicated an allergic reaction to ne@@ om@@ y@@ cin ( antibiotic ) in your child .
&quot; if you miss the agreed date for the second vacc@@ ination , talk to your doctor and arrange a new date as soon as possible . &quot;
♦ very common ( more than 1 case per 10 inj@@ ected dos@@ es ) : • pain or dis@@ comfort at the inser@@ tion point or red@@ ness • Mat@@ eness • irrit@@ ability • head@@ ache • loss of appetite
♦ common ( up to 1 case per 10 inj@@ ected dos@@ es ) : • swelling at the injection unit • F@@ ever ( above 38 ° C ) • F@@ atigue • Ga@@ stro @-@ intestinal dis@@ comfort
&quot; other side effects , which were reported on days or weeks after vacc@@ ination with comparable combination or single vacc@@ ines against h@@ epatitis A and h@@ epatitis B very rare ( less than 1 case per 10,000 dec@@ im@@ planted dos@@ es ) are : &quot;

&quot; 23 Check your doctor or pharmac@@ ist , if any of the side effects you / your child affects significantly or you notice side effects that are not stated in this package . &quot;
Ambi@@ rix is available in packs of 1 and 10 with or without need@@ les and in packs of 50 without need@@ les .
&quot; based on the data , which have become known since the initial approval for the in@@ tranet , the CH@@ MP advoc@@ ated that the benefit @-@ risk ratio for Ambi@@ rix remains positive . &quot;
&quot; however , since Ambi@@ rix used only in a Member State ( in the Netherlands since May 2003 ) , the available security data for this medicine is limited due to the low patient ex@@ position . &quot;
ammon@@ ia can also be used in patients aged over a month with incomplete enzyme defect or with hyper@@ ammon@@ ium encephal@@ opathy ( brain damage due to high ammon@@ ia concentrations ) in pre @-@ history .
&quot; - split into several dos@@ es with meals - swal@@ lowed , mixed with food or fed through a Gast@@ ro@@ stom@@ i@@ esch@@ l@@ auch ( through the abdominal wall into the stomach @-@ leading hose ) or a nas@@ al probe ( through the nose into the stomach @-@ leading hose ) . &quot;
&quot; it was not a compar@@ ative study , because ammon@@ ia could not be compared with any other treatment or plac@@ ebo ( a pseu@@ do @-@ drug , i.e. without drug ) . &quot;
&quot; may also lead to loss of appetite , abnormal acid content in the blood , depression , irrit@@ ability , head@@ ache , fa@@ inting , fluid retention , loss of ache , vom@@ iting , nau@@ sea , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , skin r@@ ash , unpleasant body od@@ or or weight gain . &quot;
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that ammon@@ ia in patients with disorders of the ure@@ a cycle prevented high ammon@@ i@@ ac assets .
&quot; under &quot; exceptional circumstances , &quot; ammon@@ ia was approved because of the rar@@ ity of the disease at the time of admission , limited information on this drug was presented . &quot;
the use is indicated in all patients where a complete enzyme short@@ age has already been manifest@@ ed in new@@ bor@@ ns ( within the first 28 life days ) .
&quot; in patients with a late @-@ manifest form ( incomplete enzyme defect , which mani@@ f@@ ests itself after the first month of life ) there is an indication of the use when hyper@@ ammon@@ ic encephal@@ opathy exists in the an@@ am@@ n@@ ese . &quot;
&quot; for inf@@ ants , for children who are unable to swal@@ low tablets or for patients with si@@ p distur@@ bances , AM@@ MONA@@ PS is also available in gran@@ ulate form . &quot;
the daily dose is individually calculated considering the protein tolerance and the daily protein intake of the patient for growth and development .
&quot; according to previous clinical experiences , the normal daily dose of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9,@@ 9 - 13,@@ 0 g / m ² / day in children with a body weight over 20 kg as well as adol@@ esc@@ ents and adults . &quot;
the sub@@ stitution of cit@@ rul@@ line or ar@@ gin@@ ine in a dosage of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day is required for patients suffering from an early @-@ manifest@@ ed lack of car@@ b@@ yl@@ phosph@@ ate syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase or or@@ ni@@ thin@@ tran@@ scar@@ bam@@ y@@ las@@ e .
patients with ar@@ gin@@ ine poly@@ th@@ ase deficiency need ar@@ gin@@ ine in a dosage of 0.4 - 0.7 g / kg / day or 8.8 - 15.@@ 4 g / m ² / day .
&quot; AM@@ MONA@@ PS tablets may not be ad@@ ministered patients with swal@@ lowing disorders , as there is a risk for the development of o@@ es@@ oph@@ ag@@ us@@ ul@@ cer@@ a if the tablets do not immediately get into the stomach . &quot;
&quot; each tablet from MONA@@ CO@@ PS contains 62 mg ( 2.7 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium , corresponding to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per 20 g sodium yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate , which corresponds to the maximum daily dose . &quot;
AM@@ MONA@@ PS should therefore only be used with caution in patients with con@@ ges@@ tive heart failure or severe ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency as well as with sodium retention and de@@ formation .
&quot; since metabol@@ isation and ex@@ cre@@ tion of sodium phen@@ yl but@@ yr@@ ate take place over the liver and the kid@@ neys , AM@@ MONA@@ PS should only be used with extreme caution in patients with liver or kidney failure . &quot;
the importance of these results regarding pregnant women is not known ; the use of AM@@ MONA@@ PS during pregnancy is therefore contra@@ indicated ( see 4.3 ) .
&quot; with sub@@ cut@@ aneous administration of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate to young rats in high dos@@ es ( 190 - 474 mg / kg ) , there was a slow@@ down of the neur@@ onal multip@@ lication and increased loss of neur@@ ons . &quot;
there was also a delayed matur@@ ation of cer@@ ebral syn@@ ap@@ ses and a reduced number of functioning nerve damage in the brain and thus a disability of brain growth .
&quot; it could not be determined whether phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is ex@@ cre@@ ted in humans in breast milk , and for this reason the use of AM@@ MONA@@ PS during breast feeding is contra@@ indicated ( see 4.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials with AM@@ MONA@@ PS , at 56 % of patients had at least an adverse event ( AE ) and 78 % of these undes@@ irable events assumed that they were not connected to AM@@ MONA@@ PS . &quot;
&quot; frequency is defined as follows : very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) and occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1.000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) . &quot;
&quot; a prob@@ able toxic reaction to AM@@ MONA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by a 18 year old anor@@ ect@@ tic patient who developed met@@ abolic encephal@@ opathy in combination with lac@@ tic tin , severe hypo@@ kal@@ emia , cur@@ b top@@ enia , periph@@ eral neu@@ rop@@ athy and pancre@@ atitis . &quot;
a case of over@@ dosage occurred in a 5 month old to@@ dd@@ ler with an acci@@ dental dose of 10 g ( 13@@ 70 mg / kg ) .
&quot; these symptoms begin with the accumulation of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate , which showed a dose @-@ limiting neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity during intra@@ ven@@ ous dose of dos@@ es of up to 400 mg / kg / day . &quot;
&quot; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is a met@@ ab@@ oli@@ cal active compound , con@@ ju@@ g@@ ated with glut@@ amine to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine , which is ex@@ cre@@ ted by the kid@@ neys . &quot;
&quot; meth@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine can be compared with ure@@ a ( both compounds contain 2 nitrogen at@@ oms ) , phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore suitable as an alternative carrier for ex@@ cre@@ tion of excess nitrogen . &quot;
5 patients with disorders of the ure@@ a li@@ fec@@ y@@ cle can be assumed to be produced for every gram of sodium phen@@ yl but@@ yr@@ ate between 0.@@ 12 and 0.15 g phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine @-@ nitrogen .
it is important that diagnosis is made early and the treatment is immediately started to improve survival chances and clinical outcome .
&quot; the pro@@ g@@ nosis of the early @-@ manifest form of the disease with inci@@ dence of first symptoms in new@@ bor@@ ns was almost always inf@@ erior , and the disease itself performed in treatment with per@@ it@@ one@@ al di@@ aly@@ sis and essential amino acids or with their nitrogen @-@ free analog@@ ues within the first year of life . &quot;
&quot; hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis , the utilization of alternative ways of nitrogen ex@@ cre@@ tion ( sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate , sodium ben@@ zo@@ ate and sodium phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate ) , protein @-@ reduced diet and possibly sub@@ stitution of essential amino acids was possible to increase the survival rate of new@@ born children in post@@ part@@ al ( however , within the first month of life ) diagnosed with 80 % . &quot;
&quot; in patients whose disease was diagnosed during pregnancy and which were previously treated before the first appearance of hyper@@ ammon@@ ic encephal@@ opathy , the survival rate was 100 % , but even in these patients it came with many to mental disabilities or other neurolog@@ ical defic@@ its . &quot;
&quot; in patients with a late @-@ manifest form of the disease ( including female patients with the hetero@@ zy@@ got@@ ic form of the or@@ ni@@ thin@@ trans@@ scar@@ bam@@ y@@ las@@ e deficiency ) , which recovered from hyper@@ ammon@@ ic encephal@@ opathy and then permanently treated with sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate and a protein @-@ reduced diet , the survival rate was 98 % . &quot;
already existing neurolog@@ ical defic@@ its are hardly rever@@ sible even in treatment and in some patients another deteri@@ oration of the neurolog@@ ical condition can occur .
&quot; it is known that phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate is oxi@@ di@@ zed to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate , which is con@@ ju@@ g@@ ated in liver and kidney with glut@@ amine , with phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine . &quot;
&quot; the concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at and its metabol@@ ites in plasma and urine were obtained after offering a single dose of 5 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate in so@@ ber healthy adults and in patients with liver cir@@ rho@@ sis , hem@@ og@@ lob@@ al metabolism and liver cir@@ rho@@ sis of up to 20 g / day ( not controlled studies ) . &quot;
the behavior of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate and its metabol@@ ites was also examined in cancer patients following intra@@ ven@@ ous administration of sodium yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate ( up to 2 g / m ² ) or phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate .
&quot; after an oral single dose of 5 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate in tablet form , 15 minutes after the intake of measur@@ able plasma concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate were found . &quot;
&quot; in the majority of patients with ure@@ a @-@ cycle disorders or hem@@ og@@ lob@@ bin@@ opath@@ ies , there was no phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate in the plasma after different dos@@ es of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at ( 300 @-@ 650 mg / kg / day up to 20 g / day ) . &quot;
&quot; in three out of six patients with cir@@ rho@@ sis of liver cir@@ rho@@ sis ( 20 g / day oral in three single dos@@ es ) , the mean phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate concentrations in the plasma level were five times higher than after the first gifts . &quot;
ex@@ cre@@ tion The medication is ex@@ cre@@ ted by the kid@@ neys within 24 hours of about 80 - 100 % in the form of the con@@ ju@@ g@@ ated product Phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine .
&quot; following the results of Mic@@ ron@@ u@@ cle@@ us tests , sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate had no cla@@ ir@@ cular reactions in case of toxic and non @-@ toxic dos@@ es ( examination 24 and 48 h after oral administration of a single dose of 8@@ 78 to 2800 mg / kg ) . &quot;
&quot; AM@@ MONA@@ PS Gran@@ ulat is taken either or@@ ally ( inf@@ ants and children who can not swal@@ low up tablets , or patients with si@@ p distur@@ bances ) or a Gast@@ ro@@ stom@@ i@@ esch@@ l@@ auch or a nas@@ al probe . &quot;
&quot; according to previous clinical experiences , the normal daily dose of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day for new@@ born babies , inf@@ ants and children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9,@@ 9 - 13,@@ 0 g / m ² / day in children with a body weight over 20 kg as well as adol@@ esc@@ ents and adults . &quot;
&quot; the concentration of ammon@@ ia , ar@@ gin@@ ine , essential amino acids ( in particular bran@@ ched @-@ chain amino acids ) , car@@ nit@@ ine and ser@@ um proteins in the plasma should be kept within the normal range . &quot;
the sub@@ stitution of cit@@ rul@@ line or ar@@ gin@@ ine in a dosage of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day is required for patients suffering from an early @-@ manifest@@ ed lack of car@@ b@@ yl@@ phosph@@ ate syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase or or@@ ni@@ thin@@ tran@@ scar@@ bam@@ y@@ las@@ e .
&quot; AM@@ MONA@@ PS Gran@@ ulat contains 124 mg ( 5,@@ 4 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per gram sodium yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate , equivalent to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per 20 g sodium yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate , which corresponds to the maximum daily dose . &quot;
&quot; when rat whi@@ st@@ les were exposed before the birth of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate ( active metabol@@ ite of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate ) , it came to les@@ ions in the pyramid cells of the brain bar@@ k . &quot;
&quot; a prob@@ able toxic reaction to AM@@ MONA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by a 18 year old anor@@ ect@@ tic patient who developed met@@ abolic encephal@@ opathy in combination with lac@@ tic tin , severe hypo@@ kal@@ emia , cur@@ b top@@ enia , periph@@ eral neu@@ rop@@ athy and pancre@@ atitis . &quot;
&quot; meth@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine can be compared with ure@@ a ( both compounds contain 2 nitrogen at@@ oms ) , phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore suitable as an alternative carrier for ex@@ cre@@ tion of excess fat &quot;
&quot; on the basis of studies on the ex@@ cre@@ tion of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine in patients with disorders of the ure@@ a cycle , sodium phen@@ yl but@@ yr@@ in can be produced between 0.@@ 12 and 0.15 g phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine @-@ nitrogen for each gram . &quot;
already existing neurolog@@ ical defic@@ its are hardly rever@@ sible even in treatment and in some patients another deteri@@ oration of the neurolog@@ ical condition can occur .
&quot; after an oral single dose of 5 g sodium phen@@ yl but@@ yr@@ in in gran@@ ul@@ ate form , 15 minutes after the intake of measur@@ able plasma concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate were found . &quot;
&quot; during the duration of the shelf life , the patient can store the finished product once for a period of 3 months at a temperature of not exceeding 25 ° C. &quot;
&quot; this procedure includes the small measuring spo@@ on 0,@@ 95 g , the middle measuring spo@@ on 2.9 g and the large measuring spo@@ on 8.6 g sodium b@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; if a patient has to receive the medicine via a probe , AM@@ MONA@@ PS can also be dissolved in water before use ( the sol@@ ub@@ ility of sodium yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate amounts to 5 g in 10 ml of water ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients with these rare diseases , certain liver enzymes are missing so that they can not ex@@ crete the nitrogen @-@ containing waste products , which accum@@ ulate after eating proteins in the body . &quot;
&quot; if your laboratory studies are conducted , you must tell the doctor that you are taking AM@@ MONA@@ PS because sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate can affect the results of certain laboratory studies . &quot;
&quot; if you are taking AM@@ MONA@@ PS with other medicines , please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you take other medicines or have recently taken it , even if it is not prescription drugs . &quot;
&quot; during the lac@@ tation period , you may not use AM@@ MONA@@ PS since the medicine can go into breast milk and harm your baby . &quot;
&quot; in rare cases , confusion , head@@ ache , taste disorders , dis@@ comfort of the ear , dis@@ orientation , memory distur@@ bances and deteri@@ oration of existing neurolog@@ ical conditions have also been observed . &quot;
&quot; if you notice any of these symptoms , contact your doctor or emergency room emergency treatment for the purpose of initi@@ ating appropriate treatment . &quot;

&quot; an@@ gi@@ ox is used to treat adult patients with &quot; acute cor@@ on@@ ary syndrome &quot; ( AC@@ S , reduced blood supply to the heart ) , for example with un@@ stable ang@@ ina ( a form of pain in the thor@@ ax with different thickness ) or m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction ( cardi@@ ac attack ) ( an an@@ om@@ al measure of electro@@ cardi@@ ogram or EC@@ G ) . &quot;
&quot; an@@ gi@@ ox is used to prevent blood cl@@ ots in patients who under@@ go a PCI , and in@@ fusion can be continued up to four hours after the procedure . &quot;
this can help patients with ang@@ ina or heart attack to maintain blood flow to heart and increase the effectiveness of one PCI .
&quot; nearly 14 000 patients participated in the main study of AC@@ S treatment , in which the effect of an@@ gi@@ ox in case of some gift or in combination with a gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ ein II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or ( GP@@ I , another drug for preventing blood cl@@ ots ) was compared to the conventional combination treatment with He@@ par@@ in ( another anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant ) and a GP@@ I . &quot;
&quot; during the PCI , patients often have a st@@ ent ( a short tube that remains in the arter@@ ie to prevent closure ) and they additionally received other medicines to prevent blood cl@@ ots , such as Ab@@ ci@@ x@@ ima@@ b and aspir@@ in . &quot;
&quot; in the treatment of AC@@ S , An@@ gi@@ ox - with or without a gift of GP@@ I - was as effective as conventional treatment in the prevention of new events ( deaths , heart attacks , or vas@@ cul@@ ari@@ zation ) after 30 days or a year . &quot;
&quot; in patients who under@@ went a PCI , An@@ gi@@ ox was as effective as He@@ par@@ in in terms of all indicators , except for severe bleeding where it was much more effective than he@@ par@@ in . &quot;
&quot; an@@ gi@@ ox may not be used in patients who may possibly be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din , other mil@@ ud@@ ine or any of the other ingredients . &quot;
&quot; it may not be used in patients who recently had a bleeding , as well as in people with severe hyper@@ tension or severe kidney problems or cardi@@ ac infection . &quot;
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that An@@ gi@@ ox is an acceptable replacement for He@@ par@@ in during the treatment of AC@@ S and during one PCI .
September 2004 approved the European Commission for The Medic@@ ines Company UK Ltd . approval for the in@@ tranet of an@@ gi@@ ox throughout the European Union .
for the treatment of adult patients with acute cor@@ on@@ ary syndrome ( un@@ stable ang@@ ina / non @-@ ST @-@ raising inf@@ ar@@ ction ( IA / N@@ STE@@ MI ) ) in case of emergency intervention or if early intervention is provided .
the recommended starting dose of an@@ gi@@ ox in patients with AC@@ S is an intra@@ ven@@ ous pin of 0.1 mg / kg followed by an in@@ fusion of 0.25 mg / kg / h .
&quot; if a PCI is performed in a further row , an additional bolt of 0.5 mg / kg should be given and the in@@ fusion can be increased to 1.@@ 75 mg / kg / h . &quot;
&quot; according to the PCI , the reduced in@@ fusion dose of 0.25 mg / kg / h can be recorded for 4 to 12 hours after clinical needs . &quot;
&quot; immediately before the procedure , a pin of 0.5 mg / kg should be given , followed by an in@@ fusion of 1.@@ 75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the operation . &quot;
&quot; the recommended dose of an@@ gi@@ ox in patients with one PCI consists of an initial intra@@ ven@@ ous pin of 0.@@ 75 mg / kg body weight , and an intra@@ ven@@ ous in@@ fusion with a dose of 1.@@ 75 mg / kg body weight / h at least for the duration of the surgery . &quot;
&quot; the safety and efficacy of a single bol@@ us @-@ offering of an@@ gi@@ ox was not investigated and is not recommended , even if a short PCI procedure is planned . &quot;
&quot; if this value ( ACT after 5 minutes ) is reduced to under 225 seconds , a second bolt of 0.3 mg / kg / body weight should take place . &quot;
&quot; in order to reduce the occurrence of lower ACT values , the re@@ con@@ stituted and dil@@ uted medicinal product should be carefully mixed before applying and the bolt dose can quickly be given intra@@ ven@@ ously . &quot;
&quot; once the ACT value is more than 225 seconds , further monitoring is no longer required , provided that the 1.@@ 75 mg / kg in@@ fusion dose is ad@@ ministered correctly . &quot;
&quot; in patients with moderate kidney function restriction ( GF@@ R 30 @-@ 59 ml / min ) , which are subjected to a PCI ( whether treated with Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din against AC@@ S or not ) , a lower in@@ fusion rate of 1,4 mg / kg / h should be used . &quot;
&quot; if the ACT @-@ value is under 225 seconds , a second bolt of 0.3 mg / kg is to be ad@@ ministered and the ACT 5 minutes to check once again after the second bol@@ us dose . &quot;
&quot; in patients with moderate kidney damage , which were included in Phase II@@ I@@ - PCI study ( RE@@ PLA@@ CE @-@ 2 ) , which led to approval , the ACT value was 5 minutes after offering the bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ ine @-@ bol@@ us without dose adjustment at an average of 366 ± 89 seconds . &quot;
3 In patients with severe kidney damage ( GF@@ R &lt; 30 ml / min ) and also with di@@ aly@@ sis @-@ based patients An@@ gi@@ ox is contra@@ indicated ( see section 4.3 ) .
the treatment with an@@ gi@@ ox can be initiated 30 minutes after the intra@@ ven@@ ous administration of un@@ frac@@ tional He@@ par@@ in or 8 hours after the sub@@ cut@@ aneous administration of low @-@ molecular He@@ par@@ in .
• severe kidney damage ( GF@@ R &lt; 30 ml / min ) and for di@@ aly@@ sis @-@ based patients
&quot; patients are carefully monitored during treatment with regard to symptoms and signs of bleeding , especially if Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din is ad@@ ministered in combination with another anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant ( see Section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; even if the majority of ha@@ emor@@ r@@ ha@@ ge of arter@@ ial pun@@ cture points occur in existing PCI patients , patients suffering from perc@@ ut@@ aneous cor@@ on@@ ary intervention ( PCI ) can occur in principle throughout the treatment . &quot;
&quot; in patients who are taking war@@ far@@ in and treated with Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din , a monitoring of the IN@@ R value ( International Norm@@ alised R@@ atio ) should be considered to ensure that the value after replacing the treatment with Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din improves the level prior to treatment . &quot;
&quot; based on the knowledge of the active mechanism of anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants ( He@@ par@@ in , War@@ far@@ in , thro@@ mb@@ oly@@ tics or th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ te aggreg@@ ator inhibit@@ ors ) , it can be assumed that these active substances increase the risk of blood . &quot;
&quot; in the combination of bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ ine with plat@@ el@@ et ag@@ gregation inhibit@@ ors or anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants , the clinical and biological hem@@ o@@ sta@@ sis parameters can be checked regularly in any case . &quot;
&quot; animal experimental investigations are in@@ adequate in relation to the effects of pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , chil@@ d@@ birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see Section 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; 46@@ 12 were random@@ ised to Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din alone , 46@@ 04 were random@@ ised to Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din plus G@@ PI@@ I@@ b / II@@ I@@ a In@@ hibit@@ or and 46@@ 03 were random@@ ised to either un@@ frac@@ tional He@@ par@@ in or E@@ no@@ x@@ apar@@ in plus G@@ PI@@ I@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or . &quot;
&quot; both in the Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ ine group and in the compar@@ ative groups treated with He@@ par@@ in , it was more common in women and patients over 65 years more often than in male or younger patients . &quot;
severe ble@@ edings were defined according to the A@@ cu@@ ity and Tim@@ i standards for severe bleeding such as in the foot@@ notes of table 2 .
both light and severe ble@@ edings declined significantly less often than in the groups with He@@ par@@ in plus G@@ PI@@ I@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or and Bi@@ vali@@ d@@ din plus G@@ PI@@ I@@ b / II@@ I@@ a- In@@ hibit@@ or ( see table 2 ) .
&quot; an A@@ cu@@ ity heavy bleeding was defined as one of the following events : intra@@ cran@@ ial , retro@@ per@@ it@@ one@@ al , intra@@ ocular bleeding or bleeding in the point zone , reduction of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in levels of ≥ 3 g / dl with well known bleeding point , re@@ operation due to bleeding , application of blood products for trans@@ fusion . &quot;
&quot; other , less frequently observed bleeding loc@@ aliz@@ ations , which occurred in more than 0.1 % ( occasionally ) , were &quot; other &quot; point points , retro@@ per@@ it@@ one@@ al , g@@ astro@@ intestinal , ear , nose or throat . &quot;
the following indications on side effects are based on the data of a clinical trial with Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din at 6000 patients who under@@ went a PCI .
&quot; both in the Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ ine group and in the compar@@ ative groups treated with He@@ par@@ in , it was more common in women and patients over 65 years more often than in male or younger patients . &quot;
both light and severe ble@@ edings declined significantly less often than in the comparison group under He@@ par@@ in plus G@@ PI@@ I@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or .
&quot; following side effects , which are not listed above , were reported after extensive use in practice and are summari@@ zed according to system organ classes in Table 6 . &quot;
&quot; in case of over@@ dosing , the treatment with Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din can immediately termin@@ ate and the patient is closely monitored with regard to signs of bleeding . &quot;
&quot; an@@ gi@@ ox contains Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din , a direct and specific th@@ rom@@ bo@@ inhibit@@ or , which bin@@ ds both the cataly@@ tic center and the an@@ an@@ vil @-@ region of th@@ rom@@ bo@@ in , regardless of whether th@@ rom@@ bo@@ in is bound in the liquid phase or on a bar@@ k . &quot;
&quot; binding of Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din to thro@@ mb@@ in , and hence its effect , is rever@@ sible because thro@@ mb@@ in on the one hand spl@@ its the binding of Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din @-@ Ar@@ g@@ 3 @-@ Pro@@ 4 slowly , thus regener@@ ating the function of the active centre of thro@@ mb@@ in . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din was treated with ser@@ um of patients with in@@ duction th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ enia / he@@ par@@ in@@ duction th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ enia / he@@ par@@ in@@ induced th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ enia ( H@@ IT / H@@ IT@@ TS ) . &quot;
&quot; in healthy subjects and in patients , Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din shows a dose @-@ dependent an@@ tic@@ o@@ ag@@ ul@@ atory effect that is demonstrated by extension of ACT , a@@ P@@ TT , PT , IN@@ R and TT . &quot;
&quot; if a PCI was performed in the patient below , an additional bolt of 0.@@ 5mg / kg bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ ine should be given and the in@@ fusion for the duration of the operation to 1.@@ 75@@ mg / kg / h should be increased . &quot;
in the arm A of the A@@ cu@@ ity trial in@@ frac@@ tion@@ ated He@@ par@@ in or E@@ no@@ x@@ apar@@ in was ad@@ ministered in patients with un@@ stable ang@@ ina / non @-@ ST @-@ raising inf@@ ar@@ ction ( IA / N@@ STE@@ MI ) in patients with un@@ stable cor@@ on@@ ary syndrome ( AC@@ S ) .
patients in arm A and B were also random@@ ised to obtain a G@@ PI@@ I@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or either before the start of angi@@ ography ( at the time of random@@ ization ) or the PCI .
&quot; in the A@@ cu@@ ity study , the characteristics of high @-@ risk patients , which required angi@@ ography within 72 hours , were spread ev@@ enly across the 3 arms . &quot;
&quot; approximately 77 % of patients had a recur@@ rent isch@@ emia , 70 % had dynamic EK@@ G@@ - changes or increased cardi@@ ac biom@@ ar@@ kers , 28 % had diabetes and approximately 99 % of all patients under@@ went a angi@@ ography within 72 hours . &quot;

&quot; A@@ pi@@ dra is used to treat adults , adol@@ esc@@ ents and children over the age of six with diabetes who require treatment with ins@@ ulin . &quot;
&quot; A@@ pi@@ dra is inj@@ ected sub@@ cut@@ aneous ( under the skin ) into the abdominal wall , thi@@ gh@@ s or upper arm or as a continuous in@@ fusion with an ins@@ ulin pump . &quot;
diabetes is a disease where the body does not produce enough ins@@ ulin to regulate glucose ( sugar ) in the blood or the ins@@ ulin is not able to work effectively .
&quot; ins@@ ulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in diff@@ ers very slightly from human ins@@ ulin , and the change means that it works faster and has a shorter effect than a short @-@ acting human ins@@ ulin . &quot;
A@@ pi@@ dra was used in combination with a long @-@ effective ins@@ ulin in patients with type 1 diabetes in which the body cannot produce ins@@ ulin in two studies with a total of 1 549 adults and in a study with 572 children aged between four and 17 years .
&quot; in type 2 diabetes , in which the body of ins@@ ulin is not able to work effectively , A@@ pi@@ dra was studied in a study involving 8@@ 78 adults . &quot;
the main indicator for efficacy was the change in the concentration of the substance gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) in the blood that indicates how well the blood sugar is set .
&quot; in the first study involving adults with type 1 diabetes , a reduction of 0.@@ 14 % ( from 7.@@ 60 % to 7.@@ 46 % ) compared to a reduction of 0.@@ 14 % in ins@@ ulin levels was observed after six months . &quot;
&quot; in adults with type 2 diabetes , H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c concentration was 0.@@ 46 % after six months with A@@ pi@@ dra in comparison to 0.@@ 30 % in human normal ins@@ ulin . &quot;
&quot; A@@ pi@@ dra may not be used in patients who may possibly be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to ins@@ ulin @-@ ulin or any of the other ingredients , or in patients who are already suffering from hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia . &quot;
the dos@@ es of A@@ pi@@ dra may need to be adjusted if it is ad@@ ministered together with a number of other medicines that can affect blood glucose levels .
September 2004 approved the European Commission of San@@ of@@ i @-@ Av@@ entis Deutschland GmbH for appro@@ ving A@@ pi@@ dra in the entire European Union .
&quot; A@@ pi@@ dra is used as sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection either in the abdominal wall , thig@@ h or del@@ ta muscle or sub@@ cut@@ aneous by continuous in@@ fusion in the area of the abdom@@ en . &quot;
&quot; due to the reduced Glu@@ con@@ e@@ ogen@@ esis capacity and reduced ins@@ ulin change , ins@@ ulin needs to be reduced in patients with a limitation of liver function . &quot;
&quot; any change of activity , the brand ( cook@@ er ) , the type of ins@@ ulin ( normal , N@@ PH , zinc @-@ delay , etc . ) , the type of ins@@ ulin ( animal ins@@ ulin ) and / or the method of production may result in a change in the ins@@ ulin demand . &quot;
&quot; 3 A in@@ adequate dosage or abor@@ tion of a treatment , especially in patients with ins@@ ulin @-@ dependent diabetes , can lead to hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and di@@ ab@@ etic k@@ eto@@ aci@@ dosis ; these conditions are potentially life @-@ threatening . &quot;
the conversion of a patient to another type of ins@@ ulin or ins@@ ulin from another manufacturer should take place under strict medical supervision and can necess@@ itate a change in dosage .
the time of occurrence of hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia depends on the active profile of the ins@@ ulin used and therefore can change during conversion of the treatment scheme .
&quot; the substances that increase blood sugar lowering activity and increase the inc@@ lin@@ ation of hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ em@@ ias include oral anti@@ di@@ abe@@ tics , angi@@ ot@@ ens@@ in converting enzyme ( ACE ) inhibit@@ ors , dis@@ op@@ yram@@ ide , fi@@ br@@ ate , flu@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , pro@@ po@@ xy@@ ph@@ s , pro@@ po@@ xy@@ ph@@ s , pro@@ po@@ xy@@ ph@@ s , sal@@ icy@@ lat@@ s , and sul@@ fon@@ amide antibiotics . &quot;
&quot; in addition , under the effect of sympath@@ etic elements such as beta lo@@ ckers , cl@@ oni@@ din , Gu@@ an@@ e@@ thi@@ din and reser@@ pin , symptoms of ad@@ ren@@ ergi@@ c anti@@ gene regulation can be weak@@ ened or missing . &quot;
&quot; experimental studies on re@@ productive toxic@@ ity showed no differences between In@@ su@@ - ling@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ ine and human@@ ins@@ ulin in relation to pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see Section 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; it is not known whether ins@@ ulin @-@ ulin is su@@ pers@@ eded into human breast milk , but in general ins@@ ulin is neither absorbed into the mother &apos;s milk nor is it absorbed into oral application . &quot;
&quot; the following are listed in clinical trials which are known from clinical trials , group@@ ed according to system organ@@ classes and classified according to decre@@ asing frequency of their occurrence ( very common : ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ; rare : ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ; very rare : &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) ; not known ( frequency based on availability data is not estimated ) . &quot;
&quot; cold wel@@ d@@ iness , cool and p@@ ale skin , fatigue , nerv@@ ousness or tre@@ mor , anxiety , unusual exhaus@@ tion or weakness , confusion , lack of concentration , ligh@@ the@@ ade@@ dness , excessive dog , head@@ ache , nau@@ sea and pal@@ pit@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy is missed to continuously switch the injection unit within the injection range , may occur in the sequence a li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy at the injection point . &quot;
&quot; severe hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ em@@ ias with un@@ consciousness can be treated by an in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of glu@@ co@@ agon ( 0.5 to 1 mg ) , which is given by an appropri@@ ately trained person , or by intra@@ ven@@ ous dose of glucose by a doctor . &quot;
&quot; after a glu@@ co@@ ag@@ ulation , the patient should be monitored in a hospital to determine the cause of the severe hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia and to avoid similar epis@@ odes . &quot;
ins@@ ulin reduces blood sugar levels by stimulating the periph@@ eral glucose absorption ( especially by skel@@ etal mus@@ cul@@ ature and fat ) as well as by inhibit@@ ing glucose production in the liver .
studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that in sub@@ cut@@ aneous GA@@ - of ins@@ ulin levels of action occurs faster and the active duration is shorter than with mild normal ins@@ ulin .
&quot; in a study involving 18 male individuals aged 21 to 50 years with type 1 diabetes , ins@@ ulin @-@ ulin @-@ related met@@ ering range from 0.0@@ 75 to 0.15 &quot; &quot; / kg &quot; showed a proportional increase in the glucose level , just like human@@ ins@@ ulin . &quot;
ins@@ ulin sensitivity has twice as fast effect as normal human ins@@ ulin and achiev@@ es the full glu@@ cos@@ ity effect about 2 hours earlier than human ins@@ ulin .
