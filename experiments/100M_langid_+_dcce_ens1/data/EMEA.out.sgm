<seg id="4">"it is available as a 5 mg, 10 mg, 15 mg and 30 mg tablets, 10 mg, 15 mg and 30 mg enamel tablets (tablets that are dissolving in the mouth), as a solution to take (1 mg / ml) and as an injection solution (7.5 mg / ml)."</seg>
<seg id="5">"• Bipolar-I disorder, a psychic disease in which patients have manic episodes (periods of abnormal mood) alternating with periods of normal mood."</seg>
<seg id="6">ABILIFY is used to treat moderate to severe manic episodes and prophylaxis of manic episodes in patients who have responded to the medicine in the past.</seg>
<seg id="7">The injection solution is used for rapid control of increased restlessness or behavioural disorders if the oral dosage of the medicine is not possible.</seg>
<seg id="8">"in both diseases, the solution can be used for insertion or melting tablets in patients with difficulty swallowing tablets."</seg>
<seg id="9">"in patients who are taking other medicines at the same time, as well as ABILIFY, the dose of ABILIFY should be adjusted."</seg>
<seg id="10">"this impairs the signal transmission between brain cells by" neurotransmitters, "i.e. chemical substances that enable communication of nerve cells among each other."</seg>
<seg id="11">Aripiprazole probably mainly acts as a "partial agony" for receptors for neurotransmitter dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamin (also called serotonin).</seg>
<seg id="12">"this means that Aripiprazole is like 5-hydroxytryptamin and dopamine, but in less measure than the neurotransmitters to activate the receptors."</seg>
<seg id="13">"as dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamine play a role in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, Aripiprazole contributes to normalizing the activity of the brain, thereby reducing psychotic or manic symptoms and their reoccurrence is prevented."</seg>
<seg id="14">The efficacy of ABILIFY to prevent reoccurrence of symptoms has been studied in three studies of up to one year.</seg>
<seg id="15">The efficacy of the injection solution was compared in two studies in 805 patients with schizophrenia or similar diseases that suffered from increased unrest over a period of two hours with a placebo.</seg>
<seg id="16">"in another study, Abilify was compared over twelve weeks to 347 patients with Haloperidol, in another study the effectiveness of ABILIFY and placebo to prevent reoccurrence to 160 patients in which the manic symptoms have already been stabilized with ABILIX."</seg>
<seg id="17">"the efficacy of Abilify Injection solution was compared to 301 patients with bipolar disorder, which suffered from increased unrest, compared with Lorazepam (another anti-psychotic) and placebo over a period of two hours."</seg>
<seg id="18">"in all studies, the change in the symptoms of the patients was investigated using a standard scale for bipolar disorder or the number of patients who responded to treatment."</seg>
<seg id="19">The company also carried out studies to investigate how the body absorbs the enamel tablets and the solution to absorb (decreases).</seg>
<seg id="20">"in the two studies with the injection solution, patients who received Abilify in doses of 5.25 mg, 9.75 mg, or 15 mg were a significantly greater reduction in symptoms of increased unrest than patients receiving placebo."</seg>
<seg id="21">"when applying for the treatment of bipolar disorder, ABILIFY reduced in four of the five short-term studies of manic symptoms more effective than placebo."</seg>
<seg id="22">ABILIFY also prevailed for up to 74 weeks more effective than placebo-recurrence of manic episodes in previously untreated patients and when it was administered additionally to an existing treatment.</seg>
<seg id="23">ABILIFY injections in 10- or 15 mg doses also reduced more effective than placebo the symptoms of increased restlessness and were similarly effective as Lorazepam.</seg>
<seg id="24">"the most common side effects of Abilify to take (observed in 1 to 10 out of 100 patients) are extrapyramidal dysfunctions, neuropathy (drowsiness), drowsiness (drowsiness), drowsiness (drowsiness), vomiting, nausea (drowsiness), vomiting, nausea (drowsiness), vomit (drowsiness), drowsiness, insomnia (sleep disorders) and anxiety."</seg>
<seg id="25">"the Committee for Medicinal Products (CHMP) concluded that the benefits of ABILIFY in the treatment of schizophrenia and moderate to severe manic episodes in bipolar disorder, as well as the prevention of a new manic episode in patients who responded to the treatment with Aripiprazole, outweigh the risks."</seg>
<seg id="26">"in addition, the committee came to the conclusion that the benefits of injection solution in rapid control of increased restlessness and behavioural disturbances in patients with schizophrenia or in patients with manic episodes in bipolar-I disorder when oral therapy is not suitable to outweigh the risks."</seg>
<seg id="27">"in June 2004, the European Commission granted the company Otsuka Pharmaceutical Europe Ltd. approval for the transport of ABILIFY in the entire European Union."</seg>
<seg id="28">ABILIFY is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe manic episodes of bipolar disorder and for the prevention of a new manic episode in patients who had predominantly manic episodes and their manic episodes addressed to the treatment with Aripiprazole (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="29">The recommended starting dose for ABILIFY is 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day once daily regardless of meals.</seg>
<seg id="30">"increased effectiveness in doses over a daily dose of 15 mg has not been detected, although individual patients can benefit from a higher dose."</seg>
<seg id="31">"the recommended starting dose for ABILIFY is 15 mg once a day, regardless of meals as monotherapy or combination therapy (see Section 5.1)."</seg>
<seg id="32">Efficacy of ABILIFY in the treatment of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder in patients ≥ 65 years has not been proven.</seg>
<seg id="33">"with regard to the greater sensitivity of these patients, a lower initial dose should be considered if clinical factors justify this (see Section 4.4)."</seg>
<seg id="34">"if the CYP3A4 induction is removed from combination therapy, the dosage should be reduced to the recommended dose (see Section 4.5)."</seg>
<seg id="35">"the occurrence of suicidal behaviour belongs to psychotic diseases and affective disorders, and was reported in some cases after beginning or after changing an antipsychotic therapy, also in treatment with Aripiprazole (see Section 4.8)."</seg>
<seg id="36">Results of an epidemiological study showed that in patients with bipolar disorder there was no elevated suicide risk associated with Aripiprazole compared to other antipsychotics.</seg>
<seg id="37">"Aripiprazole should be used with caution in patients with well-known cardiovascular diseases (myocardial infarction or ischemic heart disease, heart failure, hypotonia, treatment with blood pressure lowering drugs) or hypertension (including acute and malignant form)."</seg>
<seg id="38">"3 Spätdyskinesia: in clinical trials, which lasted one year or less, there were occasional reports of dyskinesia arising during the treatment with Aripiprazole."</seg>
<seg id="39">"if patients treated with Abilify occur signs and symptoms of a late dymium, it should be considered to reduce the dose or break the treatment."</seg>
<seg id="40">"if a patient develops signs and symptoms indicative of a MNS or unclear high fever without an additional clinical manifestation of MNS, all antipsychotics, including ABILIFY, must be dismissed."</seg>
<seg id="41">"therefore, in patients with varicose incidents, Aripiprazole should be used with caution in the anamnesis or at conditions associated with varicose incidents."</seg>
<seg id="42">"56 - 99 years) with Aripiprazole in patients with psychosis associated with Alzheimer's disease, patients treated with Aripiprazole had an increased risk of death compared to placebo."</seg>
<seg id="43">"however, there were in one of these studies, a study involving a fixed dosage, a significant relationship between dosage and response for undesirable cerebrovascular events in patients treated with Aripiprazole."</seg>
<seg id="44">"hyperglycemia, in some cases extremely and associated with ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar coma or death, was reported in patients treated with atypical antipsychotic agents, including ABILIFY."</seg>
<seg id="45">There are no precise risk assessments for hyperglycemia-related adverse events in patients treated with ABILIFY and other atypical antipsychotic agents that allow direct comparisons.</seg>
<seg id="46">"polydipsie, polyurie, polyphagia and weakness) are observed and patients with diabetes mellitus or with risk factors for diabetes mellitus should be regularly monitored in terms of a worsening of glucose levels."</seg>
<seg id="47">"weight gain is generally observed in schizophrenic patients and in patients with bipolar mania due to comorbidities, the use of antipsychotics, in which weight gain is known as side effect, or an unhealthy lifestyle and could lead to serious complications."</seg>
<seg id="48">"due to the primary effect of Aripiprazzol on the central nervous system, caution is necessary if Aripiprazole is taken in combination with alcohol or other central effective drugs with outlying side effects such as sedation (see Section 4.8)."</seg>
<seg id="49">"the H2-antagonist Famotidin, a gastric acid blocker, reduces the absorption rate of Aripiprazole, although this effect is considered clinically not relevant."</seg>
<seg id="50">"in a clinical study involving healthy subjects, a highly effective CYP2D6 inhibitor (Chinidin) increased the AUC of Aripiprazol by 107% while the Cmax remained unchanged."</seg>
<seg id="51">"it is expected that other highly effective inhibitors of CYP2D6, such as fluoxetine and paroxetine, have similar effects, so similar dose reductions should be made."</seg>
<seg id="52">"in CYP2D6 'bad' (=" poor ") metabolites, the common application with highly effective inhibitors of CYP2A4 in higher plasma concentrations in Aripiprazol results in more than CYP2D6 extensible metabolites."</seg>
<seg id="53">"considering the joint offering of ketoconazole or other highly effective CYP3A4 inhibitors with ABILIFY, potential benefits should weigh potential risks to the patient."</seg>
<seg id="54">"other highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4, such as itraconazole and HIV protease inhibitors, may have similar effects, so similar dose reductions should be made."</seg>
<seg id="55">"after placing the CYP2D6- or 3A4 inhibitors, the dosage of Abilify should be raised to the dosage level prior to the beginning of the accompanying therapy."</seg>
<seg id="56">Diltiazem or escitalopram or CYP2D6 together with Abilify can be calculated with a moderate increase in aripiprazole concentrations.</seg>
<seg id="57">"doses of 10-30 mg of Aripiprazole per day showed no significant effect on the substrates of CYP2D6 (Dextromethorphan / 3-Methodomorphinan ratio), 2C9 (Warfarin), 2C19 (Omeprazol) and 3A4 (Dextromethionan)."</seg>
<seg id="58">Patients should be advised to notify their doctor if they are pregnant or plan a pregnancy during treatment with Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="59">"because of the lack of data security for humans and the concerns that arise in the animal's reproductive studies, this medicine may not be used in pregnancy unless the possible benefit justifies the potential risk for the fetus."</seg>
<seg id="60">"however, as with other antipsychotics, patients should be warned against dangerous machines, including motor vehicles, until they are certain that Aripiprazzol has no negative influence on them."</seg>
<seg id="61">The following adverse events occurred more often (≥ 1 / 100) than placebo or were classified as possible medically relevant side effects (*):</seg>
<seg id="62">"the frequency of side effects listed below is defined according to the following criteria: common (&gt; 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10); occasionally (&gt; 1 / 1.000, &lt; 1 / 100)."</seg>
<seg id="63">"schizophrenia - In a controlled long-term study more than 52 weeks in patients treated with Aripiprazole, a total decreased incidence (25.8%) of EPS including Parkinsonism, Akathisie, Dystonia and Dyskinetry, compared to patients treated with Haloperidol (57.3%)."</seg>
<seg id="64">"in a placebo-controlled long-term study more than 26 weeks, the incidence of EPS was 19% in patients with Aripiprazole treatment and 13.1% in patients with placebo."</seg>
<seg id="65">"in another controlled long-term study more than 26 weeks, the incidence of EPS was 14.8% in patients treated with Aripiprazole and 15.1% in patients with Olanzapin therapy."</seg>
<seg id="66">Manic episodes in bipolar-I disorder - In a controlled trial of 12 weeks the incidence of EPS was 23.5% in patients with Aripiprazol- treatment and 53.3% in patients with haloperidol treatment.</seg>
<seg id="67">"in another study more than 12 weeks, the incidence of EPS was 26.6% in patients with Aripiprazole treatment and 17.6% for those under lithium treatment."</seg>
<seg id="68">"in the long-term retention phase over 26 weeks in a placebo-controlled trial, the incidence of EPS 18.2% for patients with Aripiprazol- treatment and 15.7% for patients treated with placebo was treated."</seg>
<seg id="69">"a comparison between the patient groups under Aripiprazole and placebo, where potentially clinically significant changes in routinely controlled laboratory parameters occurred, did not reveal medically significant differences."</seg>
<seg id="70">"increase of CPK (creatine phosphokinase), generally temporary and asymptomatic, were observed in 3.5% of patients treated with Aripiprazole, compared to 2.0% of patients treated with placebo."</seg>
<seg id="71">"side effects that may occur in connection with an antipsychotic therapy, and on its occurrence also reported in the treatment with Aripiprazole, include the malignant neuroleptic syndrome, late dynastics and cramp attacks, undesirable cerebrovascular events and increased mortality in older dementia patients, hyperglycemia and diabetes mellitus (see Section 4.4)."</seg>
<seg id="72">"in clinical trials and since market launch, unintentional or deliberate acute overdosages with Aripiprazole were observed alone in adult patients with estimated doses of up to 1260 mg and without death."</seg>
<seg id="73">"although there is no information about the efficacy of a hemodialysis in the treatment of overdose with Aripiprazole, however, it is unlikely that hematosis is beneficial in the treatment of overdose since Aripiprazzol has high plasma cutting."</seg>
<seg id="74">It is assumed that the effectiveness of Aripiprazzol in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder is mediated by the combination of a partial antagonistic effect on dopamine D2- and serotonin 5HT1a receptors and an antagonistic effect on serotonin 5HT2a receptors.</seg>
<seg id="75">"in vitro, Aripiprazole showed a high affinity to dopamine D2- and D3 receptor and serotonin 5HT1a- and 5HT2a receptor as well as an even affinity to dopamine D4-, serotonin 5HT2c- and 5HT7-, alpha-1-adrenergic and histamine H1receptor."</seg>

<seg id="77">"in three placebo-controlled short-term studies (4 to 6 weeks) in 1,228 schizophrenic patients with positive or negative symptoms, Aripiprazzol showed a statistically significant improvement in psychotic symptoms compared to placebo."</seg>
<seg id="78">"in a Haloperidol-controlled trial, 52 was the share of responder patients who adhered to the study medication in both groups (Aripiprazole 77% and Haloperidol 73%)."</seg>
<seg id="79">"current values from measurement scales defined as secondary programs, including PANSS and Montgomery Asberg- Depressionswert scale, showed a significantly stronger improvement than Haloperidol."</seg>
<seg id="80">"in a placebo-controlled study more than 26 weeks in stabilized patients with chronic schizophrenia, Aripiprazole showed a significantly higher reduction in the rate of decline, which was 34% in the Aripiprazole group and 57% in placebo."</seg>
<seg id="81">"in an Olanzapin-controlled, multinational double-blind study at schizophrenia over 26 weeks, the 314 patients included and in which the primary study target 'weight gain' was, a weight gain of at least 7% (N = 18 or 13% of the evaluable patient records) occurred in significantly less patients (i.e. an increase of at least 5.6 kg) with an average weight of ca."</seg>
<seg id="82">"in two placebo-controlled monotherapy studies with flexible dosage over 3 weeks involving patients with a manic or mixed episode of bipolar-I disorder, Aripiprazole showed superior efficacy in reducing manic symptoms over 3 weeks."</seg>
<seg id="83">"in a placebo-controlled monotherapy study, over 3 weeks with a fixed dose of patients with a manic or mixed episode of bipolar-I disorder, Aripiprazole showed no superior effectiveness compared to placebo."</seg>
<seg id="84">"in two placebo and active-controlled monotherapy studies over 12 weeks in patients with a manic or mixed episode of a bipolar-I disorder, with or without psychotic mercury, Aripiprazole showed superior efficacy in week 3 and a conservation effect similar to that of lithium or haloperidol in week 12."</seg>
<seg id="85">"in week, Aripiprazole also showed a comparable proportion of patients with symptomatic remission of the Mania, such as lithium or haloperidol."</seg>
<seg id="86">"in a placebo-controlled trial of 6 weeks with patients with a manic or mixed episode of a bipolar-I disorder, with or without psychotic characteristics which sometimes did not respond to lithium or valproat monotherapy in therapeutic serum mirrors, the companion therapy with Aripiprazole resulted in superior efficacy in reducing manic symptoms compared to monotherapy with lithium or valproat."</seg>
<seg id="87">"10 In a placebo-controlled trial, over 26 weeks followed by a long-term expansion phase over 74 weeks in manic patients receiving a remission with Aripiprazole during a stabilization phase prior to randomization, Aripiprazole presented themselves with regard to the prevention of a bipolar recoil, mainly in the prevention of a return to the Mania."</seg>
<seg id="88">"based on in vitro studies, the enzymes CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 are responsible for dehydration and hydroxylatation of Aripiprazol, the N-Dealkyulation is catalyzed by CYP3A4."</seg>
<seg id="89">The mean elimination period is approximately 75 hours for Aripiprazole with extensive metabolites via CYP2D6 and approximately 146 hours in 'bad' (= "poor") metabolites via CYP2D6.</seg>
<seg id="90">"in Aripiprazole, there are no differences in pharmacokinetics between male and female healthy volunteers, as did a pharmacokinetic examination of schizophrenic patients with no gender-based effects."</seg>
<seg id="91">A Population-specific evaluation of the pharmacokinetics showed no indication of clinically significant differences with regard to ethnic origin or the impact of smoking on the pharmacokinetics of Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="92">The pharmacokinetic properties of Aripiprazole and Dehydro-Aripiprazole were similar in patients with severe kidney failure in comparison to young healthy volunteers.</seg>
<seg id="93">"a single dose study in subjects with different liver cirrhosis (Child-Pugh class A, B and C) showed no significant effect on the liver function on the pharmacokinetics of Aripiprazole and Dehydro-Aripiprazole, but the study included only 3 patients with cirrhosis of the class C, which is not sufficient to draw conclusions on their metabolic capacity."</seg>
<seg id="94">"based on conventional studies on safety harmacology, toxicity in repeated gift, reproductive toxicity, genotoxicity, and cinogenic potential, preclinical data could not detect any particular hazards for humans."</seg>
<seg id="95">"toxicologically significant effects were only observed in dosages or expositions which exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure in humans, so they have only limited or no significance for clinical use."</seg>
<seg id="96">The effects included a dose-dependent drug toxicity (lipofuscin-pigment accumulation and / or parenchymal cell loss) in rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg / kg / day (corresponds to 3- to 10 times the middle Steady-State Exposition (AUC) at the recommended maximum dose in humans).</seg>
<seg id="97">"in addition, a cholelithiasis was established as a result of the elimination of sulfate conjugates of the hydroxy- metabolites of Aripiprazole in the bile of monkeys after repeated oral application of 25 to 125 mg / kg / day (1 to 3 times of the middle Steady State Exposition (AUC) at the recommended clinical dose or the 16- to 81fold of the recommended maximum dose in humans based on mg / m2)."</seg>

<seg id="750">Actos is used to treat type 2 diabetes (also known as non-insulin-dependent diabetes). • It can be used alone (monotherapy) in patients (especially overweight patients) in which metformin (a diabetes medication) is not indicated. • It can be used together with another diabetes medication (dual therapy).</seg>
<seg id="751">"it can be applied in addition to metformin in patients (especially overweight patients), which can not be satisfactory with metformin alone in the highest tolerable dose."</seg>
<seg id="752">"in combination with a sulfonylus or insulin, the previous dose of the sulphonic acid or insulin can be retained with the start of the Actos treatment except for patients with hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar), and the dose of the sulphonic acid or insulin should be reduced."</seg>
<seg id="753">"this means that the body's own insulin can be better utilized and the blood sugar level decreases, making it better to adjust type 2 diabetes."</seg>
<seg id="754">"in more than 1 400 patients the efficacy of Actos in tripletherapy was examined; in addition, patients received a combination of metformin with a sulfonylonite, in addition they received either Actos or placebo for up to 3,5 years."</seg>
<seg id="755">"in studies, the concentration of a substance in the blood (glycosylated hemoglobin, HbA1c) was measured, indicating how well the blood sugar is set."</seg>
<seg id="756">"Actos led to lowering the HbA1c value, suggesting that blood sugar levels were reduced by 15 mg, 30 mg and 45 mg."</seg>
<seg id="757">"at the end of the tripletherapy trial, the effect of the additional administration of Actos on the existing treatment with metformin and a sulfonylated substance showed a decrease in HbA1c values by 0.94% while the additional offering of placebo led to a reduction of 0.35%."</seg>
<seg id="758">"in a small study where the combination of actos and insulin was investigated in 289 patients, patients receiving accounts in addition to insulin showed a decrease in the HbA1c values of 0.69% after 6 months compared to 0.14% in the patients receiving placebo."</seg>
<seg id="759">"the most common side effects associated with Actos were vision disturbances, upper respiratory tract infections (colds), weight gain and hypoesthesia (reduced sensitivity to stimuli)."</seg>
<seg id="760">"Actos can neither be used in patients who may possibly be hypersensitive (allergic) to pioglitazone or any of the other ingredients, or in patients with liver problems, heart failure, or diabetic ketoacidosis (high level of ketones - acid levels - in the blood)."</seg>

<seg id="866">"Actraphane led to a decrease in the HbA1c mirror, suggesting that blood sugar levels were similarly lowered by another human insulin."</seg>
<seg id="867">Actraphane should not be applied to patients who may possibly be hypersensitive (allergic) to human insulin (rDNA) or any of the other ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="868">"in addition, the doses of Actraphane may need to be adjusted if it is administered together with a number of other medicines that can affect blood sugar (the complete list is to be found in the package insert)."</seg>
<seg id="869">The Committee for Medicinal Products (CHMP) concluded that Actraphane benefits outweigh the risks in the treatment of diabetes.</seg>
<seg id="870">"October 2002, the European Commission granted the company Novo Nordisk A / S approving Actraphane in the entire European Union."</seg>
<seg id="871">Premixed insulin products are normally applied once or twice a day if a quick initial effect is desired along with a longer lasting effect.</seg>

<seg id="873">"for example, patients whose blood sugar is significantly improved by means of an intensified insulin therapy, the hypoglycaemia warning symptoms can be perceived and should be advised accordingly."</seg>
<seg id="874">"any change with regard to strength, brand (manufacturer), insulin type (fast acting, bipolar, long acting insulin, human insulin or insulin analog) and / or production method (through recombinant DNA to insulin-animal origin) may cause a change in dosage."</seg>

<seg id="876">"some patients in which hypoglycaemic reactions occurred after a change of animal to human insulin, reported that the early warning symptoms of hypoglycemia were less pronounced or different than with their previous insulin."</seg>
<seg id="877">"when travelling over several time zones, the patient should be advised to take the advice of his physician, as such journeys may cause insulin and meals to be used or taken at other times."</seg>

<seg id="887">"diabetics should therefore always have grape vines, sweets, biscuits, or sugary fruit juice. • Heavy hypoglycemias with unconsciousness are treated with an intramuscular or subcutaneous injection of glucagon (0.5 to 1.0 mg) by means of an intramuscular or subcutaneous injection of glucose which is given intravenously by the doctor."</seg>
<seg id="888">"the effect begins within half an hour, the active maximum is reached within 2 to 8 hours and the entire duration of the operation is up to 24 hours."</seg>

<seg id="2671">"after the treatment with Alpheon, the disease flamed up again in more patients than with the reference drug; moreover, Alpheon had more side effects."</seg>
<seg id="2672">"apart from this, the test used in the study to examine the question of what extent is the medication an immune response (i.e. the body forms antibodies - special proteins - against the medicine) dissolves, not sufficiently validated."</seg>
<seg id="2673">"it can be used to treat impetigo (a skin infection associated with crust formation) and small infected Lazerations (cracks or cuts), abrasions and stitched wounds."</seg>

<seg id="2699">The active mechanism of reapamulin is based on the selective inhibiting of bacterial protein synthesis by interaction at a specific binding site of the 50S subunit of the bacterial ribosome which differs from the binding sites of other ribosomal interacting antibacterial substances.</seg>
<seg id="2700">Data indicate that the binding site is involved with ribosomal protein L3 and is located in the region of the ribosomal P binding site and the Peptidyltransferase center.</seg>

<seg id="2965">"Apidra is used to treat adults, adolescents and children over the age of six with diabetes who require treatment with insulin."</seg>
<seg id="2966">"Apidra is injected subcutaneous (under the skin) into the abdominal wall, thighs or upper arm or as a continuous infusion with an insulin pump."</seg>
<seg id="2967">Diabetes is a disease where the body does not produce enough insulin to regulate glucose (sugar) in the blood or the insulin is not able to work effectively.</seg>
<seg id="2968">"insulin lulisin differs very slightly from human insulin, and the change means that it works faster and has a shorter effect than a short-acting human insulin."</seg>
<seg id="2969">Apidra was used in combination with a long-effective insulin in patients with type 1 diabetes in which the body cannot produce insulin in two studies with a total of 1 549 adults and in a study with 572 children aged between four and 17 years.</seg>
<seg id="2970">"in type 2 diabetes, in which the body of insulin is not able to work effectively, Apidra was studied in a study involving 878 adults."</seg>
<seg id="2971">The main indicator for efficacy was the change in the concentration of the substance glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) in the blood that indicates how well the blood sugar is set.</seg>
<seg id="2972">"in the first study involving adults with type 1 diabetes, a reduction of 0.14% (from 7.60% to 7.46%) compared to a reduction of 0.14% in insulin levels was observed after six months."</seg>
<seg id="2973">"in adults with type 2 diabetes, HbA1c concentration was 0.46% after six months with Apidra in comparison to 0.30% in human normal insulin."</seg>
<seg id="2974">"Apidra may not be used in patients who may possibly be hypersensitive (allergic) to insulin-ulin or any of the other ingredients, or in patients who are already suffering from hypoglycemia."</seg>
<seg id="2975">The doses of Apidra may need to be adjusted if it is administered together with a number of other medicines that can affect blood glucose levels.</seg>
<seg id="2976">September 2004 approved the European Commission of Sanofi-Aventis Deutschland GmbH for approving Apidra in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2977">"Apidra is used as subcutaneous injection either in the abdominal wall, thigh or delta muscle or subcutaneous by continuous infusion in the area of the abdomen."</seg>
<seg id="2978">"due to the reduced Gluconeogenesis capacity and reduced insulin change, insulin needs to be reduced in patients with a limitation of liver function."</seg>
<seg id="2979">"any change of activity, the brand (cooker), the type of insulin (normal, NPH, zinc-delay, etc.), the type of insulin (animal insulin) and / or the method of production may result in a change in the insulin demand."</seg>
<seg id="2980">"3 A inadequate dosage or abortion of a treatment, especially in patients with insulin-dependent diabetes, can lead to hyperglycemia and diabetic ketoacidosis; these conditions are potentially life-threatening."</seg>
<seg id="2981">The conversion of a patient to another type of insulin or insulin from another manufacturer should take place under strict medical supervision and can necessitate a change in dosage.</seg>
